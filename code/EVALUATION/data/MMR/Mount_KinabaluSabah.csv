0,Popular spot for climbing. Well maintained area with lovely view.,"Nice climb. I did 1N/2D trip to the summit and it was intense though was fun at the same time.The path are well maintained and relatively easy though there is no up and downs but constant climbing to the summit and the vice versa.I went there in early March 2020, and my guide said there are usually 100 climbers every day - I met quite a lot of foreign tourists - they are mostly in groups."
1,Ups and downs (pun intended),"I booked 3 days 2 nights climb with Amazing Borneo Tours. It was my first mountain climb and it was the most beautiful, special, magical and difficult adventure of my life. I consider myself to be in a good shape, but the altitude really affected my physical condition. Luckily I invested in a good pair of hiking boots, which was a big advantage. I was picked up at noon at my hotel. We went to Kinabalu National Park for the registration.Next morning we were brought by bus to Timpohon Gate (1866m), where we started the ascent each one with a private mountain guide. On our way up to Laban Rata Hostel (3272m) where we were supposed to sleep, we passed several shelters, where we could have a rest and eat lunch. In Laban Rata I started to feel a slight altitude sickness late afternoon. After dinner I went to bed, but I couldn't sleep properly, as I slept in a dormitory, where people were constantly entering the room, so I ended up getting only a few hours sleep, before getting up at 2 am, climbing the last part of the mountain in order to reach the summit before sunrise.This was one of the toughest parts of the climb, also considering the fact that my expensive gloves got wet, so my hands were freezing. On some particularly steep sections I had to haul myself up specially strong ropes. The view at the summit was simply spectacular. Looking down on the clouds was so awesome. An unforgettable million- dollar moment. The descent was difficult, but I was happy that I got hold of 2 walking sticks which helped me a lot. The climb was magical, starting at the lowland rainforest of the tropical zone, to the temperate zone until the last and alpine climate zone. Experiencing such different vegetation was truly special and unique.However, I wasn't satisfied with my guide, who was unmotivated, disinterested and unknowledgeable about the flora. I inquired a specific mountain guide prior to my climb, and I was promised to be provided with him.I paid a lot of money for the climb, and I didn't get neither a knowledgeable, nor a social/motivated mountain guide. I consider at least 3 important aspects of being a good mountain guide. The social, the psychological and the knowledge about the vegetation and wildlife. He seemed to be more occupied with his cell phone. A couple of times he told me to go ahead, and then he would catch up. He caught up after a couple of hours which isn't acceptable at all. When we made breaks at the shelters, he would sit in another place, as if he couldn't care less. I mentioned these aspects to him, but still he didn't change his behavior. He didn't know anything about the vegetation, which was very disappointing to me, as I am a true Nature Lover.  A mountain guide should always be beside the climber to give her/him the sufficient psychological support/encouragement, as it is a tough climb.In spite of this disappointment, I highly recommend the climb to this spectacular and sacred mountain. I felt satisfied with the length of the experience. You can also book the 2D/1N climb. I suggest NOT to climb the mountain in the rainy season, as the rocks get very slippery."
2,BORNEO G ADVENTURES TOUR,It's was brilliant experience once u reach the summit.was very lucky the weather was good although it was monsoon season.Such a great way to see one of the oldest rainforest in the world.
3,Was für eine Erfahrung ,"We did a 3D2N climb to the summit. Was an amazing expereince. The climb was tough, but people and facilities were good along the way and the views from the top were stunning."
4,Highest Peak in Southeast Asia,Great arrangement with personal pickup from your accomodation. We did the climb over 2 days with one night on the mountain.  We were both in good physique  but had a tough time the last hour on the first day. It is worth every single step to the summit. The views are truly breathtaking and it is amaizing to see how the nature changes the higher you get. Up is hard down is harder  One more thing. Prepare for aching muscles from hell a few days after you get down again. But over all. Worth every single step.
5,Amazing park ,"We did the 2d1n climb and booked with Amazing Borneo Tours. Highly recommend them as they were great and very professional, we received heaps of information prior the trip so we felt well prepared. I was very nervous about the climb itself as I had never done anything like it before and I am also a bit scared of heights. The four hour climb up to Laban Rata and the accommodation was hard. I thought this part was going to be fairly easy but it is steps all the way up as well as rocks...exhausting. Arriving to the accommodation and having the staff there bring you a cup of hot tea was the best. Waking up at 2 am for early supper, the rain was pouring down. The climb to the summit cannot take place if it is raining so we had to wait another hour before the ranger gave his ok to go. (There is a 3.30 cut off).This climb usually takes 2-3 hours, but as it was slippery after the rain we had to walk slowly. I was worried about this bit, especially about climbing in darkness. (BYO head torch). It was actually amazing. You have ropes all the way up basically and yes, it does require some serious use of both arm muscles (for holding on to the rope and pull yourself up) as well as leg muscles.Reaching the summit was amazing, what a feeling sitting up there and watching the beautiful views. Stunning!Going down from summit was not a problem, however, after breakfast the four hour descend to the gate was hard. Legs aching and it felt like it was taking forever getting down.All in all, highly recommended this climb. Yes it is hard, yes it is a bit scary climbing in darkness, but the reward up there makes it worth it and the feeling you have after accomplished it is amazing. Make sure to bring lots of snacks to keep energy levels up and extra set of clothes in case of rain."
6,Borneo highlight Mount Kinabalu,"We did it fantastic 2 day climb we had prepared well and took advice on equipment, It was far more challenging than we thought but great fun. TIP read up about mountain, take correct clothing &equipment, wear Marino wool base layer for summit v cold. Going down is harder than going up !!!!  PS We are both in our fifties &first climb for us !!"
7,Learning experience,Climbed for the 7th times and still it was very exciting especially when you go there with friend! The only thing we don't like is the weather (raining) which no one to be blame for this. Highly recommend for all traveler who like adventure and ready to be physically and mentally challenge by the Mt Kinabalu. Book your trip now (safest 5-6 month ahead) and enjoy the hike!
8,"Climbing the Mount Kinabalu, with problems",We did the 2 day Kinabalu climb to see sunrise from the top. Hard work but the guide was great. Worth the hard climb. Advice- take walking poles for the decent!
9,Moonscape!,the climb was pretty hard but doable and fun. the view at the top is astonishing and base camp accommo and food is good. its the getting back down that hurts!
10,Im the 6th one reaching the peak!,"We did the 2 day 1 night climb it was so hard but worth it, I am a 33 year old man with reasonable fitness although I do smoke and found this climb very hard it took us 6 hours on day one to get to hotel this was due to some of the heaviest rain I have ever seen it was like walking up a water fall. The path is steep from the start and does not get any easier all steps and rocks all the way! On day 2 up at 2am to start climb in the dark so bring a head lamp and warm dry clothes. This part of the climb is even harder as it is so steep don't let this review put you off it is an amazing climb just be prepared bring spare warm clothes as it is cold at the top waiting for sunrise you should probably train for this climb as I did not and found it quite hard."
11,"Do not underestimate, but great experience","It is kinda hard to get to low peak, but I made it! Remember the journey, also hiking in the dark. Switch off the headlight, lay down on the mountain and enjoy the stars. It is not all about the destination but also the journey. Enjoy the journey, once in a life time."
12,Mount Kinabalu: The highest point that I've ever been,"It is not an easy climb, but worthwhile. Mountain Trails & Tours arranged out trip and they did a great job on this."
13,The peak,Absolutely beautiful hike! Gripping at times and felt like I was dying because the altitude did me in but what an amazing view. Tranquil and serene. Would do it again if I had the chance despite my panic at having to shimmy across a cliff edge.
14,It’s Worth It,First mountain climb which was awesome... The view was spectacular even though I only climbed till Laban Rata.... It was a fantastic experience n thick clothing are a must. Difficult tiring climb but worthwhile all the pain... Must be mentally strong not to give up......Must try!!!!!
15,Worth the effort!,A nice place for tourist as it was very tall and it also took me hours of going up the mountain. I also bought a Mount Kinabalu T-Shirt for my husband.
16,A great hiking experience,"We did the 2 day 1 night climb and it was an awesome trip.  We went with Amazing Borneo and it was well organised and our guide was great.Do make sure you are a little prepared though.  You do need good waterproofs, head torch and cold weather gear otherwise you will be very uncomfortable.We are pretty fit and found the walk was fine, we were just a bit slow on the last few hundred metres at the summit but made it in good time to see the sunrise.  But a lot of people didnt make the summit to see sunrise and some not at all as they were just too slow.  i think you do need to be a little fit to really get the most out of it.Food in our packed lunch and at the guest house was fantastic, you definitely wont go  hungry.Overall totally worth the trip."
17,Challenging Climb with the Best Reward – An Unforgettable Sunset,First time visiting our local mountain and it was majestic. Would loved to have climb it but restrained due to long knee injuries.Made a point to stay nearby in Kundasang and watch its beauty. Heard you have to be well prepared mind and body as its a challenging trail up to the summit.
18,THE CLIMB!,"Amazing. Well worth the effort. Disappointing to not make summit but there was extreme weather and the gate to the peak was closed for safety reasons. We stayed at Pendant Hut - highly recommend as the people were nice, we stayed in the small room (only 8 people) so it was quiet and warm, and there was free tea, coffee, hot water (I think you have to pay for hot water down at Laban Rata)."
19,2D1N Amazing Borneo Tours,"The 2D1N climb of the mountain is one of the best things I did whilst in Borneo. It is hard work, and the altitude (4000m at the summit) can be a problem for some people, but the views and the sense of achievement were completely worth it. The overnight stay in the Laban Rata is overpriced and a terrible (dorm room) night's sleep, but there's not really any way round this (unless you are extremely fit and do the whole mountain in one day). Book through Sutera Lodges - they own all the accommodation, so going through any other site will just add commission and admin fees onto your costs. We paid about £120 for the 2D1N package. An absolute must-do."
20,A strenuous climb rewarded with a stunning view!,Memorable experience. Took the timpohon route which is 2.2km more to reach the peak. Started climbing from Laban Rata at 2.30am and arrived the peak at 5.30am to watch the sunrise. View is absolutely magnificent. Challenging climb in the dark but to have the experience of being at the peak is definitely worthwhile!
21,Ascending Mt Kinabalu,Pain afterwards in every part of my legs but it was so worth it.Stunning view from the top and a real achievement in my opinion if you finished the climb.The moment when you arrive above the clouds is hard to describe.I realised how high it was when i flew back from Sandakan and passed the mountain half way.Def. go for a good massage afterwards!!
22,2D1N Must-Do Hike,visited this mountain march 2015.its a challenging hike and its definitely a worth while hikenumber 1 thing to do in sabah
23,Beware of Scam Tour Operator,"We did the 2D1N climb via Amazing Borneo and I highly recommend them. Our guide Cornelius Sanan was very helpful. As I had trouble with some altitude sickness when I did the Inca Trail, he set a good steady pace which meant I didn't have any problems reaching the summit just in time for the sunrise. What I wasn't ready for was the 3km (800m descend) followed by 6km (1400m descend) on day 2 after reaching the summit. My legs were like jelly by the last two kilometres and I had to take it slow after a minor sprained ankle but I am glad I made it. Recommendations:- Rent a walking pole or a pair. You might not need it as much going up but helps with the descend especially if you have knee pain etc- Pack as light as you can. But still have enough for water and essential clothing.- Laban Rata has towels and 2-in-1 shampoo/body wash so save space and weight and not bring it with you.- Definitely do some preparation, not just up and down stairs but some rougher terrain with steeper steps."
24,The Magnificent Akinabalu,"Beginner's can try but it is quite a challenge, this was my first ever climb and it was amazing! It can be a bit costly but it was just... GRAND!"
25,Mount Kinabalu,"Loved the whole thing (well except maybe for the 6.5KM of steps)Well worth it and has to be done. If you leave kinabalu without climbing the mountain, you will forever feel like you have to returnAs I did!"
26,"Incredible experience, but one not to be underestimated!",Best xpedition ever to Mount KK. Enjoyable and full of stamina of walking and climbing.Hope to  return to complete what not finish.
27,Inner peace ,"It is just two-day trek/climb, not very easy I must say (and I have comparison to for example climbing Kilimanjaro) but when you are at the top... there are one of the most awesome views in the whole Borneo not to say in this part of the world! If you are lucky having a good weather (as we had) you may see even Philippines. But be prepared for ten thousands (I didn't count but I wouldn't be surprised if it is true) steps and then using ropes to get to the highest point. Early booking is needed because of the limited rooms in Laban Rata Lodge, especially if you want to stay in the main building with no need to go down and up for every meal (even at two o'clock in the morning just before leaving to the top)."
28,Second successful climb to summit. ,"Beautiful views once you get to the top (even though our morning was very cloudy & you couldn't see the sunrise) but be prepared to work for it.....especially if it's raining (which it was for my ascent AND descent). I wouldn't suggest this hike for anyone who isn't somewhat physically fit unless you train prior to the hike because the majority of the climb is straight uphill, whether it be stairs or rocks and once you get to approx the 7.5km point where there's pretty much no vegetation, it's flat rock with a few spots that require use of the rope. I saw a few people get sick & turn around all throughout the hike. In addition to the hike, we also did the ""walk the torq"" ferrata which is worth it if you have the option. It takes about 2 hours and it's exhilarating with great mountainside views! Even though we were pushed to the point where we thought we would never make it, I wouldn't change my experience for anything!"
29,Tough but manageable trip to Mt KK,"Amazing trip to Mt Kinabalu. Day 1 of the ascend was steps and straight up from the park gate to the Panalaban Base camp. Day 2 begins at 2am from Panalaban Base camp to the summit (4095m), climbing steps, and on all fours through the boulders. Towards the top we're guide ropes where we pulled ourselves up.The weather was good, and the views from the summit were stunning. Try this highest peak in Asia at least one time, unlike other higher mountains where one can hike, walk the slopes etc. Mt Kinabalu is every step we take, we ascend a little. Its a ""vertical marathon"" you might say...."
30,Fantastic tour to Mount Kinabalu and Poring Hot Springs,I booked a climb online with Amazing Borneo tours. Was a very easy and efficient booking process . I was given 2 options for days I could go and once booked communication was excellent. Picked me up from my Hotel and as I was by myself I had a personal guide up the Mountain. Day one was a good hike to base camp where meals were provided and bunk beds. Day 2 started at 2am with the climb to the summit. I did suffer from mild altitude sickness but managed to summit and soon was back to normal once I descended. Descent was tougher in some respects due to fatigue bit all very well organised and safe. Highly recommended !
31,"Mount Kinabalu spectacular view from Kundasang, Sabah",the route to the peak is very steep for normal person. I suffered heavy rain when on the summit. The decending route becomes extremly sllipery and dangerous. I saw lots of people fell off around me. My Via Farrata Low's Peak Circuit activity was cancelled due to heavy rain. Such a Pity.
32,Spectacular but challenging,The climbing was amazing. You have to deal with natures great forces. Reached the summit in the early morning because the weather was not ok for the nightwalk.
33,Touching heaven ,I was very disappointed that i was unable to complete my 1 day climb due to that my guide kept disappearing.  I had made it to all check points and then on the last where we had lunch my guide went missing for 1.2 hours. I was 2 kms from the top & told by another guide that I would now have to go down.  I had heard that the guides do not like to do the climb in a day however I should have been given a guide that was able to complete the climb as i had trained for some time to complete. This was something that i wanted to check off my bucket list but will now not be able to do so.
34,3rd time summit at mt kinabalu,"I went for th climb on 11 Aug 2013. I started at 9am from the Timpohon gate. Reached te Layan Layng Hut (2,702m) at 1.30pm. I climbed slow and it rained along the way. Had my lunch of a hard-boiled egg and some bread, because I was robbed of my piece of chicke by a squirrel!!! Reached Pendant Hut (3,289m) at 3.30pm. Rested before having dinner at Laban Rata Hut (3,727m) at 6pm. Slept from 7.30pm to 2.00am in the hut, it was very quiet except for the strong winds howling outside. Continued to climb at 2.30am to the summit, passed the last check point Sayat Sayat hut  (3,668m). Finally after some strenous climb, touched Low's Peak (4,095m) at 6.15am. Climbed back down to the hut at 8.00am. Strong winds and heavy rain came, so we waited till 11am. Started the climb down in that kind of weather. Reached the bottom at 4pm. I MADE IT!!!!"
35,Wow,"We had a fantastic 2 day climb up Mount Kinabalu with Downbelow Adventures. The 2 day climb was perfect length for us. With a 6:30am departure from KK, we started hiking 9:30 and reached Laban Rata hut after 5 hours on endless stair climbing. The hut was beyond our expectations with electricity, showers w towel (quick n cold), variety of buffet food, private room for our family of 4, bottled water, and great views. We started summit climb at 2:30am, reaching the peak in 3 hours then watching a glorious sunrise. After a 2nd breakfast at the hut, we headed down. My husband injured his leg just below the hut (we think a cruciate ligament tear) and slowly descended another 3 km below our guide called the rescue team which piggy backed him down the final 3 km in rain on slippery rocks and stairs - incredibly strong guys! I highly recommend walking sticks for the downhill for stability and lessening the wear and tear on knees and thighs and ponchos to cover body and backpack during afternoon showers."
36,Icon,"I climb Mount Kinabalu for the 3rd time and each time never follow group but alone with a mountain guide company. However I have to buy the climb package 2d1n from local agency but i didnt take their transfer as driving from Kota Kinabalu to Mount Kinabalu park is a breeze and very scenic view.Once registered at the Park Office, collect pack lunch from the restaurant, then joint the sic coach to Timpohon Gate. Climb start at 9.30am well somewhere around there. Dont wear thick clothing but put your sweater and long pants inside your back pack. You will sweat and feeling uncomfortable for the first 10kms. Chocolate bar and 100plus and water and fruits can be really useful. I love to stop whenever i like to take rest and takes pictures. Love those quietness and cold breezy wind and occasionally looking up to sky see the mount kinabalu top..though sometime my view covered by the foliage. Beautiful. Managed ro reach Laban Rata at 3pm and took rest and have dinner..take bath also. Next day woke up at 1am and start climb again. Wheew..what a day but the rewards was great This is a long story but I shall climb for 4th time soon."
37,Mount Kinabalu Hiking,"We did the 2D1N package for the hike. We had the best weather too as it was clear on both days and we took in a glorious sunrise at Low's peak. The view is breathtaking and I recommend this to anyone.A couple of things to remember:1) Balaclava's might not look cool, but they'll definitely help with the wind chill at the top when your face is exposed2) Hydrate every chance you get. Some hydration satchets are good to carry and mix in with your water3) Bring gloves for the summit.4) If it's not raining, a t-shirt and shorts will suffice when going up to the resthouse. 5) Altitude sickness prevention tablets are useful. The risk of getting it might be low but you don't want to be that person who ends up getting it when there are measures to prevent it."
38,Mt kinabulu hike,"My first mountain climb (end of April2015 Timpohon Trail) and it was exceptionally amazing and stunning. We are just a group of 3 ladies with a mountain guide. Before my climb, i did a research on what it is going to be like in youtube and articles, but somehow was mislead by pictures and videos, as the trail route was really a painful and tough experience, for a city girl lifestyle like me. Luckily those slight running, pre-climb (about 10km/ 3days per week) did paid off. Rented a walking stick at the main gate for RM10. From Timpohon gate to Laban rata (6km), took us about 3hrs plus++, so many steps after steps and huge rocks to cross over/ Dinner, a buffet style was good, lots of variety / Rest till 2am (We got a private room in Laban Rata, just for the 3 of us, not a dorm style) / Continue our hike to the summit (2.5km), which took us almost 4hrs. During our climb to the summit, everything was too dark and we depend on our head torch to move forward. Again steps after steps. The ascend 45degree incline climb or walk i guess to the summit and the strong wind, will slow you down and my legs almost give way due to sheer exhaustion and muscle cramp. Upon reaching the summit, i couldn't believe that i reach the summit and almost cried because of both exhaustion and satisfaction feelings. The view was extremely awesome and feels like im on a cloud nine feeling, all of my tiredness seems to go away. Walking down back to the main Timpohon gate, can be very tiring as well, as we need to continue down after resting from a summit climb to laban rata to timpohon gate, all to be done in one day. Walking stick do come handy for the downhill hike. Nevertheless Im so lucky to have such a good weather, good friends and my wonderful guide (Duin Limundok) who didn't leave me behind and push me all the way to the summit. This is really a no joke climb for someone who is not so fit as me. Mental, perseverance and determination is really what i need for this climb. If given another chance, i would definitely want to hike up to mount kk again and try Mesilau Trail instead. Now i would really understand of why people would congratulate you when you reach the summit."
39,Must go - Mt. Kinabalu an icon of Sabah,"We stayed 2 nights, accommodation was surrounded by trees and bush, birds right beside our balcony. Lovely walk without climbing the mountain"
40,Breathtakingly Beautiful Mount Kinabalu,"of us ventured for a day climb to reach kinabalu summit. It was the second time I was doing the climb, but the first time I was trying a day climb. The day climb was fairly challenging since the rangers require that you reach Laban Rata at 12pm and the summit by 1pm. If you do not make it by then, they will require you to turn around. We rented a car at the airport and spent the night at Kota Kinabalu. Then we set off at 5am and reached the park slightly before 7am. We had not booked anything and the guides quickly settles all the paperwork. All in all, with the two guides, the park entrance and the climbing permits, it cost us about RM600 for 3 foreign persons (RM200 per person), well below the ""cheapest"" RM2,550 for 3 people quoted by the cheapest travel agency. The guides asked for a day climb permission from the rangers which was immediately granted. The climb to laban rata was grueling and seemed endless, especially the last 2km where the thinner air is being felt. The two other climbers in our group were not really prepared for this level of effort and we took quite a few to drink and rest on the way. There are plenty of rest areas on the way up equipped with toilets and water. There are signs informing climbers that the water is untreated, but we filled our bottles with it and never got any problem. We reached Laban Rata guest house at 11:30am and took a quick bite with the food we had carried with us. Looking at the derelict state of this guest house I was glad I did not stay there, especially for the outrageous price of about 800Ringgit per person. This guesthouse is rusting away with no apparent maintenance and falling apart at the seams. The inside is damp and in bad need for a deep overhaul. Yet, the owner continues charging the full monopoly pricing. Anyhow, we pressed ahead, towards the summit. The guides warned us that we were fairly late and that we may not reach the summit. MY climbing companions were exhausted and gave up about 1km after Laban Rata. They turned around with one of our guides and I pressed on with the other guide. By 1pm, I was in sight of the summit, but unfortunately, the guide asked me to respect the cut off time, so we turned around. I rejoined my climbing friends at laban rata and we all went down in two and a half hour. We did not have the time to reached the summit, still it was a magnificent day and a huge effort rewarded with a remarkable landscape. It also bolstered our friendship and teamspirit with my climbing buddies. The experienced lived on as we relived the climb over a good meal in kota kinabalu but with our tired and painful legs legs for the weeks following the climb. Also, I havent saif my last word and will be back for another 1 day climb attempt..A keenly recommended experience."
41,Experience Mount Kinabalu ,Just been there at the chrismas eve and the view was amazing! Very difficult climb for me from Laban rata to low's peak but the starry sky and beautiful sunrise worth the climbs! Takes me 5 and a half to climb to Laban rata and another 4 and a half hours to the low's peak. The total time for climbing down was 5 hours
42,"Walker not Climber, loved it.","On Sept 17, 2013 I climb to 3929m or just short of the top in on day. I arrived the day before and took care of my Park registration. I spoke to the Park Ranger over the phone and told him that I climb the hills of Penang Island Malaysia regularly. I arrived at about 6:30 the next morning and staff arrived early and I paid all my costs and taxi fare to Timpohon Gate. My guide and I started the hike at about 7:05 and I arrived at Laban Rata at 10:00 on the nose. Virtually no stopping along the way at all otherwise would not make it. After 15 minutes of 'rest', I started towards the top. The higher the elevation the more difficult it became to breath - very difficult. I reached the sign post of 3929 at KM8 at 12:30. The weather had been great all morning but clouds where forming at the top and the guide insisted we turn back. As they have the last say, I relented. I reached the Timpohon Gate at 16:30 a half hour before closure for a hiking time of 9.5 hours. I was a bit stiff the next day but not too bad as I was quite used to climbing hill stairs at Botanical Gardens in Penang. I was very satisfied for reaching the point I did although I could have finished the climb as there was sufficient time. The deadline for reaching the top is 13:00. The guide had other day and night jobs and this was an extra. I am 61 years old."
43,Great View From Nabalu :),"Did a 1-day up & down summit hike in January 2014, 3 of us paid 450RM each to an agent in KK, including everything (including TWO guides) except a night in the Mountain View Guesthouse 500m outside the park entrance (70RM for a triple room, wifi, hot shower, clean)The good:-Well-maintained, clear path to the summit-Spectacular views-Sense of achievement-Little or no rubbishThe BAD:-Rip off tour agents in Kota Kinabalu-Rip off Sutera Laban Rata Guesthouse-Completely useless guides - & we had to pay for TWO guides between 3 of us. There were no guides to be seen when we started our climb at 7:30am. One eventually did catch up with us after a few kilometres, lectured us about deadlines for the climb, then walked BEHIND us (not GUIDING us) most of the way up before he gave up close to the summit.-Rip off permit system - the 4 permits/day rule only does not apply, it is a scam to make tourists use agents (who pay off the park rangers & guarantee a permit) or book an insanely expensive 2 day/1night tour. There were 8 1-day climbers the day we climbed (4 of us made it to the summit)-Reached the summit just before 12pm, so it was somewhat cloudy - it is usually clearer in the morning"
44,Mount Kinabalu climb,"Good experience even though we were unlucky. Anyway based on average statistics, total closure of the summit climb happens about 10 – 15 times a year. Click the link to see what happened. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoWeQaGc3CU"
45,MAJESTIC VIEWS !!!..........HOPEFULLY !,"We climb via mersilau trail, it was indeed fascinating and scenic path. It wasn't easy but was easier than the timpohon trail. Spend 6 hours to reach laban rata and had our lunch at the resthouse. Didnt really get to sleep as we were too excited. Waking up in the morning 2am to make summit hike. It was chilly due to no trees on the top and need to take deep breath as the air was thin. Nevertheless, it's all down to your determination to make it to the top. We made it before 6am :)"
46,CLIMBING KOTA KINABALU...WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.. DON'T DO IT,Since we are not capable of hiking 2days and 3 nights we just took picture from a afar but still it was very great view...
47,Sun rise at Mt Kinabalu,"Was a local from KK, climbed mt kinabalu was my first achievement back in 2005, the experience was unforgettable for a 13yr old kid. Recently climbed again with my buddies. It was a challenging experience but worth giving a shot tho. Reaching the summit just in time to see the sunrise and enjoy view was so breathtaking, it's  so beautiful. It's really a good climb for those who appreciate nature and loves peace and quite. But of course it's very very tiring. Oh btw, you can drink the water which flows from the rock (upon climbing frm Laban rata)."
48,Overpriced,"Worth the hike for sure! Its not that tough, fairly easy, not high altitude or anything. Beautiful view from the top, very rainforresty on the path. Wear good comfy worn-in shoes you dont mind getting dirty.."
49,Great Mountain Climb but Overpriced,"The hike is steep upwards but with proper staircase. Not too taxing to the legs but the reducing oxygen level can be vexing to some. So things to prepare include:1. Plastic glove - the top will be cold and moist. You would't want to wet your hands and suffer cold numbness. Wear a plastic glove underneath a proper hiking glove fit cold temperature. 2. Can be hot during the day because the terrain is rather exposed so wear sunscreen or proper covering if you have sensitive skin and dont want to have darken skin. 3.  3 sets of dry clothing - shirt, thermal, track suit, socks, under wears.4. Shoes with good cushioning - going down is painful because of the staircase - you have to take big steps and often shock your knee. A good shoe helps to reduce the impact. 5. Windbreaker - The summit climb may be windy. 6. Headlamps - To be used during the summit attack often around 2am in the morning. The view is amazing - worth all the precautionary preparations."
50,Breathtaking view at the peak ,"The first 6km up to the rest house I found easy, I'm an experienced hiker and have climbed mountains before, so that was no problem. Some people really struggled with this and got to the rest house late. It rains at about 3pm most days, so you really want to be inside by then. We saw unfit people turn upto the guesthouse after 4pm completely soaked and exhausted. So my advice is to train (a lot), run up stairs, go for long hikes, get your fitness levels up. Don't be naive, this is a real mountain, not Disney Land. The fitter you are, the more you will enjoy yourself.Secondly, take decent clothes, don't wear cotton or denim like a total numpty, wear breathable quick drying fabric to keep you cool. Start the hike in a set for hot weather, then change into a set for cold weather. Set off for the summit attempt in a base layer and wind proof and have gloves, wolly hats, fleeces and scarves in your backpack for the summit, it's really cold and windy up there, so be prepared.Thirdly, the start of the rope section is steep, if its raining, it will also be as slippy as an ice rink, proper hiking boots are required. I saw people in converse sneakers, they have no grip whatsoever! If it starts to rain when you are at the top, you will have to walk backwards holding into rope to lower yourself down steep rock faces. Like abseiling but without a harness. Some people turned back because they were scared of heights. It's only a few shorts sections, but there is a real risk of slipping and hurting yourself.The mountain upto the rope part is easy, if you are fit, just a lot of steps. The last section is a challenge and should not be underestimated. Getting down is hard in your knees, hiking poles and knee supports are good. I saw lots of people being carried down because their legs couldn't take it anymore. This is just stupid, get fit before you take on a 4000 meter mountain.It was a fabulous experience, but to get the most out of it, you must be prepared, and remember that this is a tourist attraction, but it is also a mountain. You are at the mercey of Mother Nature who can dump a biblical amount of window rain on you at any moment, so preparation and proper gear is key.Now go and get yourself fit, get down to the outdoor clothing store and get kitted out in proper gear, and get ready for an experience of a lifetime!"
51,Hard work!,Very picturesque ascend. Very natural. The guides were really fit and they can help the climbers carry their belongings with very cheap rate considering the difficulty of the climb. Around 10myr per kg. Please adhere to the instructions of the Guides. Dont forget your camera. And please ask a local for the 1myr bill as one of the peaks is on the bill. Take picture with the 1 ringgit bill at the said bill. Ask the guides and they will show you. The sunrise is just magnificently breathtaking.
52,Spectacular but elusive !,"We did the hike over 2 days (overnight at Laban Rata lodge), to be at the top for sunrise. The hike is fairly challenging but very do-able if you are in decent shape. It is also do-able all in one day if seeing the sunrise isn't a priority.Well worth the visit, and a great experience to get to the top."
53,Great climb but don't come during the rainy season! ,"I would recommend the Mt K climb as the overall experience is great.Would recommend some downhill/stairs training before you go as I found the descent a bit of a killer, and it wasn't just me.Would recommend getting private rooms with bathroom as the communal showers were cold, this will not enhance your experience...Good place to stay afterwards if you want a remote and chilled place to stay is Magic Mountain Guesthouse, please see my review as well as several others."
54,An epic hike - should be on every hikers list,I climbed Mt Kinabulu and despite being tough a times reaching the top before sunrise was amazing. The Sutera lodge served up great food and was a comfy place to stay.
55,"Climbing:OK, descent: tough!","Climb up - tough but doable - beautiful sceneryClimb down - very toughGreat feeling when reaching the top. Make sure you rent a walking stick, available at the entrance (RM10) and keep you toe nails as short as possible. Needless to say that you need to be fit for this climb. Start training way in advance. Don't forget that you're going up to 4,095 mtrs - air gets thinner. Bring enough clothes so you can change. You'll have an amazing experience!"
56,Amazing ,We take the car just to have the nice sight seeing at the mountain foothill. Road is quite slippery after heavy rains. Have to pay for entrance into the park but very minimal for adult and child.
57,Not to be missed,"I had a wonderful and remarkable experience in Mt Kinabalu Low Summit Climb!! Try out the mountain Torq, thrill and fun, it was awesome!!"
58,breathtaking views at the top ,"I climbed it through the Mesilau trail which is so much further. The flora and  fauna were great like pitcher plants. Finally, reached Laban Rata at about 4pm. The hike was very difficult and was fully soaked with sweat. The next day started the climb at 2am. I didn't get any sleep but I managed to reach the peak at about 6 am, took photos of the sun rise. The scenery was phenomenal , breathtaking beautiful. Do some training like climbing up stairs every alternate day for 2 months. We were lucky that it didn't rain too heavily although shower of rain is expected throughout the hike, so do bring deposable rain coat."
59,Worth Climbing,"A super tired, super Hard trip i have ever tried!! but all the tired will gone when you climbed up finally! the view is super nice!!althought i'm not a ""climber lover"", but this is a really good experience for me! this is the 1st time so near with the natural LoL!anyway, i recommended this place to everyone who are love natural!!"
60,Into thin cold air.,"One of the best mountain climbing I’ve experienced so far. It is a two days one night climbing through Timpohon trail. Climbing starts in the morning at 9am from the main entrance.  If you are a spirited shutterbug, bringing extra batteries or high capacity powerbank, and a SDHC card is a must. Be ready with raincoat as it will usually rains in the afternoon. It took me much longer time to climb up to Laban Rata, (stop point for overnight) with all the photos snapping going on along the trail. Some of my friends reached Laban Rata as early as 1.00pm. All the surroundings, wildlife and lushes green & colourful flora are extremely amazing. The accommodation in Laban Rata was not luxurious as expected but the food was more than adequate. The next morning as early as 3am, we continued our climb. Be prepared with freezing temperature and make sure to bring enough warm clothing, gloves, scarf and torchlight. Manage to reach the summit before sunset but due to the clouds, the view of sunset was not that pleasant. But successfully reach to the highest peak of was one of the best feeling and feels like a great achiever!"
61,Check your fitness,The climb is not for the faint hearted. We couldn´t walk for 3 days afterwards. It was definately a challenge but an amazing one. The view at the top was expectacular and amazing. The summit was beautiful. We saw an amazing sunrise at the top and within seconds the clouds were gone and you could see into the distance. It was a beautiful day I will never forget.
62,Worthy challenge ,"It is expensive trip but the view is spectacular. You must be fit to reach the top. First day climb, you just need normal sports attire. Second day morning you must be prepared for the cold with wind cheater, water proof gloves and a beanie or cap when u reach the peak."
63,Difficult and amazing ,"Toured Sabah with G adventures, as with all tours could of done with a couple of days in some places but the itinary was great ,got to stay with a fantastic malayan family in Mesilou ,our host and guide Amrin was top dollar,our G adventures guide Leroy led the trip well (needs to be more forceful when travellers keep interupting him) throughout.maybe if your not so mobile a couple of the hikes may be beyond your remit.DO YOUR HOMEWORK ,if you want 5 star accomodation comfortable beds ,hot showers everyday DON'T go to a jungle."
64,Enjoyable semi-tough hike and nicely maintained national park,"Its worth to visit the mountain once, the view is breath taking, if you going first time to 4000mts plus altitude, this is the best place to fight your altitude sickness. The steps were like never ending, the facilities at Laban rata was very nice, good overnight stay.Highly recommended!!!"
65,At least once a life time,"mountain viewing, really cooling place but sometime can be hot. go up and see in the morning will be the good timing. those who like adventure, you can join the mountain climb with the a professional guide."
66,Hard but amazing!,"One of the first climbing the summit with the new trail. It was lovely, and great view and scenarie. The trail is great with small huts in the way up. You can fill you water bottle with UNTREATED water. Recommended you to bring some cleaning tablets. The climbing is a bit challenging. Three days after my legs are still sore."
67,So amazing!,"AMAZING! It is definitely hard but I made it with pretty severe asthma by walking slowly and taking a lot of breaks. Everywhere you look the views are breathtaking. We were lucky enough to have perfect weather when we climbed the summit and that sunrise is one of the most beautiful things I have seen in my life. Make sure to bring extra dry layers for the summit, it gets really really cold before the sun comes out."
68,Strenuous yet rewarding ,"Initially I did not want to climb as it is quite expensive but seeing people preparing for the climb listen to them after the climb and watching the great view of the mountain peak from the my hostel I finally decided to do it. I booked with Jungle Jack (backpacker) who was able to get me the permition and he arranges the rest (for RM1380) including tow nights at his hostel with all the meals. I really recommend to everyone to think twice before you decide to climb. I am in good shape and I took me first day nearly 4 hours (with lunch break) to reach Laban Rata and the next day about 2 hours to get to the top. But due steep stony surface, lack of the oxygen it is really hard job and you well feel your legs for another 3-5 days! But if you are not well trained first day can take 5-7 hours and they you can be exhausted that you can give up the to climb to the top as many people did. The first 4 KM from Timpohon gate is mostly stairs and good path with signs and info table every 0,5 KM with shelter. And toilet but due to the lack of the water currently closed. Your guide usually suggest taking a lunch break at KM 4 shelter, do it and rest well before the last 2 KM. Thea are harsh. Not stairs but shapeless stony path and high altitude contribute to the ordeal. You will start to count every single step. I stay at Laban Rata Resthouse Bunk Beds. There is a hot water all day, coffee and tea just during the meals time. Food nothing special but not bad. No hot water available just cold one. Beds in dorm room very comfortable. The next day after early morning breakfast we set off to final 2,5 leg of the climb. This section with some new trail after earthquake starts with wooden step and not difficult. The harder climb starts after the check point when the rial is steep with ropes. You can use them or just walk zigzag. Do not get fooled the summit can be deceptively just stone throw but it is still far away. I advise you not to arrive at the top to early otherwise you will wait for sunrise in freezing weather. The sunrise is breathtaking (on clear day). To get down without break at Laban Rate for the second breakfast  takes about 5- 7 hours. The check out is at 10 AM. Do not expect to see many animals, they are really shy. But a good guide can direct you to a pitcher plant. I am glad that I took the challenge and enjoyed my climb."
69,Great climb with Amazing Borneo Tours,"Recently did the two day climb (overnight stay on the mountain) and cannot recommend this highly enough. Booked at the ferry terminal in kk, where there are plenty of operators. I was picked up at my hotel at 6am and driven to the park entrance (about 2.5 hours). From there i was introduced to my guide and away we went. I am very fit and got up to the guesthouse in around 3.5 hours. It is a very strenuous climb. It is uneven and good footwear is important.Once at the guesthouse you get to relax, enjoy the incredible views and meet fellow travellers. Don't plan on much sleep or a hot shower.Woken at 2am for the assault on the peak, there is a lot of muffled excitement and expectation. You head off with as many clothes as you can put on....and dont forget a head lamp.This is when the adventure really starts. Again, the climbing is strenuous, but unbelievable. In the darkness you traverse a granite valley that the morning light will reveal with incredible delight.Most of the climb is rope assisted. In the steeper parts I would count out 50 or 100 steps and then have a short break. The summit is very rocky and you get to look back at what I will not be able to put into words.Take the best camera you have. I have never taken photos like the ones I took at mt Kinabalu.The descent back to the guest house is amazing. Take at least an hour or so to get ready for the 6km descent back to the park entrance. Your guide may hassle you to leave quicker. It is your climb and take the time you need.The track down is very tough and very easy to slip. This two day adventure was incredible in the true sense of the word. No trip to Borneo is complete without visiting mt K.Don't plan to do too much the following day. Your legs will be sore !Cost 1270 myr...."
70,Panoramic vistas for days!,"We did the climb as part of a Gadventures tour. The hike up was hard but if you are fit and you pace yourself it's ok! Expect the hike to take 4-5 hours for the first part and another 3 hours for the second part up. It's all steps and upwards. It's only 9km from base to summit so it's all uphill.The views at the top are very rewarding and a once in a lifetime experience.Downhill is hard work too, especially if you have a tendency for sore knees.Highly recommend but make sure you have a few days after of relaxing as walking may be tricky for a few days and don't forget to stretch after the hike!"
71,The peak is amazing..but 2100 Ringgit for actually a one day trek ??!!,"I did not make the top, turned back by ropeway after Laban Rata. Stunning views. Others in my group did make the top and their photos of sunrise are superb. 2 days before our climb nobody was allowed to the top as winds 80KPH, and day before gate above Laban Rata was closed after some went through , because of rain. A challanging climb but this 57 yr old made it to Laban Rata in 5 hours , took 3&1/2 hours down. Knees were fine ( but I used 2 walking poles and highly recommend them). Really good guide for our group, paced things well."
72,Mount Kinabalu is indescribable,"This is my 3rd time climbing Mount Kinabalu. The only similarity, all 3 times it wasn't really plan and no preparation.I was handling back to back group at Kota Kinabalu in Jun 2014 and in between i found I have  2 days gap, hence I push my friend Yunus Sampek to get me 1 seat and 1 bed at Laban Rata. My happiest moment when told it is available, thats when I ruah out to purchase more warm clothing, head gear, head lights, hand glove, thicker sock. I drove myself to Mount Kinabalu HQ. Once get registered and all documentation done and selected my mountain guide, collect my packed lunch, mini coach transfer to Timpohon Gate.I wore short and T- shirt when climbing from Timpohon Gate, i nenevr start from other starting point due to time constraint. I carry my backpack using my laptop bag, this works well for me. I took my breakfastI sweat a lot but whenever i stop, mt sweat easily evaporated as I never wear thick clothing. I took my own sweet time when climbing to Laban Rata as am alone and making some light chat with my guide. I also tought him how to take good pictures. I reach Laban Rata at 1530hrs, i rate myself not bad as no exercises or training at all before climbing.No hot water, super cold and feeling like froze bite after took cold wayer bath as cannot imagine whole body sweated and how to go to bed without washing body. It took me more than 30 minutes to regain my body heat.Midnight 1.30am woke up and early breakfast. 2am joint many others some slow trek, some walk fast. 5am reach the top, satisfied. Took many pictures.I will come again for sure. It is really worthwhile. I will also try Mount Everest based camp. Thats my dream in the making."
73,Wonderland Above The Clouds,"We drove for many Km with the mountain in sight. Managed to see it early morning in very clear weather. Also stopped at the tourist viewing area. I guess to really appreciate it, I should have climbed to the top ;-)"
74,A magical adventure on a Sacred mountain,"A spectacular experience. Just becasue it is not a very long walk to the summit (8 km) do not get disillusioned, this is a very hard climb. It is mainly uneven stairs or rocks that sort of make stairs. The summit climb consists of ropes and narrow ledged so do be aware of that. Coming down will destroy your knees.But apart from that, as long as you are well prepared, the views from the top are breathtaking. Well worth the effort!"
75,Climb of a lifetime,"We climbed via Mesilau Trail. It was longer, yet it offers better view than Timpohon Trail. And they'll also give you 2 certs for that :pIf you get to the peak during a clear day, them you're lucky! The view is great, it's nice to just sit and relax for a bit when it is not so cold. The top of the moutain has several peaks, and some of them have really nice facade, like undulating waves. It's gorgeous up there."
76,Out of this world!!!,"Even tough two days later I still have trouble walking it was completely worth the effort and pain! The hike is beautiful and really an achievement to be proud of if you make it to the top. That said, here's some things you'll want to consider before going:1. You will climb an equivalent of 515 staircases to get to Laba Rata (base camp) and almost 200 more to get to the top. After that, you usually descend the 715 staircases in a couple of hours. If you have weak knees bring walking sticks. I eventually found one in the bushes and without it I think my knees would not have survived, and I am a healty trained 35 year old.2. Things I brought and did not use: insect repellent, a towel and shower gel (only cold showers, you'll want to suck it up and shower once you get back down because it is cold enough as it is at the top).3. I saw a woman who had put her stuff inside her backpack in seperate plastic ziplock bags. Great idea! Even though I covered my backpack with a poncho, heavy rainstorms will get through and you'll end up with a backpack full of wet clothes. 4. Only bring water for your first day. You can refill at the base camp. You can also buy snacks there (prices are European).5. If you suddenly get altitude sickness (I did even though I have been at higher heights and have never experienced it before), take some aspirine immediately and slow your pace. 2 excedrins and 1 panadol extra (they sell those at the base camp store) did the trick for me.6. I was happy I had not only brought warm clothes but also a beanie and gloves. It gets really cold at the top before sunrise!7. Buy a proper poncho. We brought a 5 Rm version but it ripped as soon as we put it on. Spend a little more so you can really protect your clothes getting all wet before you're even at base camp.8. After getting back to KK, reward yourself by getting the mt Kinabalu treatment package at the Jari Jari Spa (Suriah Sabah shopping mall). They're amazing! Have fun!"
77,Climb to Mt. Kinabalu - One of life best moments!,"I stayed in the Rock hostel and it was a twin room so only shared with 1 lady and went well. The hostel is five star as there was a lounge with lovely huge fireplace large balcony covered with table etc, free tea , coffee and nice towels and huge lovely bathroom with great hot showers."
78,Worth the climb,"We got lucky with amazing weather which is one thing to consider. The hiking is hard and constant but if you have good fitness you can do it in a good time. The hostel is really great, comfortable bed and great buffet. The hiking in the morning is hard going, especially the higher sections but the views are amazing."
79,"Mount Kinabalu 23/3-24/3, 2018","An enjoyable climb at the time but do not think that the summit can be reached in the 1 day trek unless you are incredibly fit. This trek is a killer on the calfs, thighs and knees but well worth the experience if you can put up with the pain afterwards.... Be careful of altitude sickness also which hit me hard early on in the trek."
80,Hard but 100% worth it,As much as the trip up the mountain is a liitle bit slow and dangerous if you are Australian and patriotic then up the mountain you should GO and definitely go to the War Memorial as many Australians fought here and that is why when you tell a local where you a from they automically smile and gravitate towards you.....Take time to sit thru the presentation and then stroll around the mountain and have a genuine meal up there!!!!!! Just soak up the atmosphere
81,Great park,"Must do in Kota Kinabalu!Its a very good meditating process climbing up the mountain - there are always ups and downs in life, if you believe you can do it, you can do it! Love that,People are cautious in keeping the mountain clean with no rubbish.Suggest you, Do research before going up, Quit smoking and drinking for a week before your climb,Find the right buddies! Would love to climb the other mountain in near future"
82,A amazing experience. It is also very difficult to climb!!,"20th highest peak in Asia, but a fairly easy climb. I've known seniors & children both do the climb in a day & 1/2. I did it in a day. Breathtaking sunrise setting at the top."
83,Mt Kinabalu climb,"Personally , Its OK and if you like a challenge . Got mescals to take pain and climb steep steps. Its for for you. Take your chance with the weather. And be prepared to get wet. I was a bit shocked as a company ripped me off. getting there is the most expensive part. Talk to the locals. travel light. And keep you coat with you and anything els at all time, I had my perter storm coat stolen up at the top lodge. Was not happy.  Big advice. Practice walking um and down steep steps. Its the down journey theta the painful part. Wonderful views and fresh air. Not for those who get altitude sick. Remember ! Do not go diving the day before.! And remember a small water proof camera. Not like I did, Take my slr and some lenses. WAY WAY TO HEAVY. I got ripped of near  over 1000 rm when I fist came, To find I can go for a 2 0r 300 ."
84,Worth every step,"Climbing the mountain was extremely difficult, the pendant hut was unheated as stated and very cold. Got up at 2am (pointless) got to the top by 5 and was so cold we could not wait for the sunset. Climbed the Torq wqy coming down was an amazing experience although tough. Good luck!"
85,highest mountain in borneo and malaysia,"I'm glad can reached the peak of the Highest Mountain in South East Asia. The view is amazing and breathtaking. The weather is really good despite its slightly raining during climbing. The air is really cooling and refreshing, far from pollution. The track is a bit dangerous with rocks and slippery ground/stairs. You have to wear special climbing shoe or in my case, i wore local climbing shoe that i've purchased for about MYR 10 a pair. Alongside the climbing, you can see flora, fauna and waterfall. My mountain guide, Mr. Abbie is very friendly and helpful. This place is really worth visit for those who love adventure."
86,Physically Taxing and Very Rewarding,"The hike to the summit was amazing and breathtaking.  The park control of the number of hikers makes it even more delightful.  A must do, but be prepared for sore legs."
87,Awesome Climb!,"Just completed this climb/walk to the summit of Malaysia's highest mountain. Very very enjoyable even if a long hard slog  on clear paths( motorways). The evening views from the wonderful pendant hut the evening before our 1am start for the summit were stunning, as were the views from the top of sunrise the next morning. We calculated getting on about 40000 steps for the last day so be warned LONG! but not difficult. Would recommend if reasonably fit."
88,Magnificent Mountain View & Most Friendliest Mountain In Malaysia,its an amazing experience. the group really had a lot of fun. its worth and we are going to climb it again next year! recommended!
89,Harrowing but magnificent climb,really like to climb to the top for my next visit! fresh air of the mountains! canopy walk and poring hot springs really interesting excellent nice refreshing
90,Worth to go up,"A little nervous to climb this mountain being in my back yard but let me put it straight, it is not climbing, it is steep hill/rock/mud walking for 6 hours each way! I booked through a friend, can't remember the company name but we drove ourselves there and they arranged the permits and others and managed to start trekking around 10.30am which lasted around 6 hours. Slowly but surely we got to Laban Rata and had a huge buffet meal - pretty good actually but a can of coke was RM10.00 and a beer at RM25.00. Had to walk another 50 metres to get to my resthouse but i would pay more next time and stay at Laban Rata - 50 metres is a huge difference after 6 hours walking. Left for the summit at 2.30am - nice and slow made it to the summit at 5.50am just before sunrise. So many people rushed passed us and we overtook them as they were tired and the lack of oxygen gets everyone so my advise is go nice and slow and eventually you will be rewarded. Summit was amazing, everyone fights for the picture with the sign post.Trekking down seemed easier as with every step you get more oxygen. made it to Laban Rata in 2 hours and then 4 hours back to the headquarters. I couldn't walk for 4 days after but i am ready to go again"
91,Not much improvement since 5 to 10 years ago,"The climb is tough but managable if youre fit- we did no training beforehand and made it within the time required. After the summit we did the lows peak via ferrata which was amazing! Not for people with fear of hights as you climb on massive steep sheer rock face - but absolutely thrilling! Mountain Torq is really professional with great guides and very safe! The kinabalu climb is very expensive though and they seem to pretend you have to decide and book immediately when they propose a date, though when we were there the hut ( pendant hut) wasnt even half full! Doing the via ferrata and coming down right after makes it extremely hard work though - we were totally exhausted but its well worth it. If you have a bit more time you can also do it 3 days 2 nights, which seems like a nice option so you have a bit more time to enjoy it!"
92,Just taking picture of the view,"Hike is not easy.  I did the 1 night/2day hike option..where you get picked up at 620am by the travel agency, drive 2 hrs to KK park, start climbing at 9am...and then reach the Laban Rata lodge in the afternoon.  The hike was tough but doable (I highly recommend that you get the Laban Rata Lodge. The other lodges are farther away..and after a long days' hike you probably will not want to hike another 100m even.).  The 230am summit hike was brutal though. It's windy, cold, and long. It's really not for the faint hearted..but the summit was worth it. Please dress in layers, take gloves, and a head lamp!"
93,Mt Kinabalu hike,"Great climb and the views are so rewarding! We did return via ferrata, Low's Peak well worth it! Not the easiest walk especially if you have altitude problems and never done long walks before."
94,INCREDIBLE ,"I went there 4th and 5th May 2015. It was so tough for me to climb... On the1st day, we climbed up to accommodation region and it took over 5 hours. And on the 2nd day we got up 1:30 midnight and started to climb to the summit. What I was so glad was food there. The 1st night's dinner is buffet style and we can eat great food a lot. The food made us warm."
95,Breathtaking,"Have now done the climb twice - it's easier the second time but still not an easy climb and you do need to be fit. Overall the climb is very well organised from the moment you get into the park to the moment you leave and the effort involved to reach the summit is very rewarding - be warned, it's freezing at the summit when you arrive there around 530am!"
96,The pinnacle,"This climb was way harder than I thought it would be. There is no preparation for the altitude and fitness has no bearing on your resilience to the breathlessness of 4000meters.Having said that, this is a very achievable summit and there are all types of people climbing Mount Kinabalu every day from primary school children to smokers to seniors and even people who are quite overweight! They all managed it.My advice is to GO SLOWLY. It is not a race and the slower you go, the more chance your body has to adjust to the altitude. Take walking poles for the walk down - you don't need them so much going up. And take a wind/waterproof jacket for the summit as it is FREEZING up there (around 0 degrees) with biting cold wind.Laban Ratna - the guest house on the mountain where you stay - is TERRIBLE! No heating in the dorms, no hot water at all (and it is cold up there...), tiny dorm rooms with bunk beds but this is a small price to pay for the opportunity to climb the summit of the highest peak in SE Asia. On the upside, the food included is pretty good and plentiful so eat up because you'll need it! And don't leave any leftovers out of respect to the porters who carry all the supplies up the mountain and carry all the rubbish back down daily.  I booked with Mountain Trails Tours who were excellent. The 2Day 1 night trip cost me 950RMB. This is pretty much the going rate and saves you all the hassle from organising it yourself which only saves you around 30% when you add up all the transfers, accommodation, guides, food etc. Mountain Trails were punctual, friendly and their transport mini van was spotless and very comfortable. They matched our group with lovely climbing guides who were so patient and caring. I felt very safe the whole way.It is totally worth the effort and is a very satifying experience."
97,Mountain is calling again,"we took the tour from the hotel in the morning and had a lovely drive, road was windy but we say vegetable sellers along the way and got  myself some strawberries.nice place full of visitors that morning. lot of photography going on but I must say if  you dont go and see mt kinabalu, you aint seen KK at all. it is so wonderful and weather nice and cool too. well kept esp the national park. friendly people"
98,Be prepared for the elements,"We went on the 3day/2 night Mount Kinabalu summit hike with 'Amazing Borneo"" tours Firstly their website advertises the climb for people aged between 7 - 80 yrs old!!! Well this is ridiculous as this gives you the impression that its an easy climb. We are family of 6, our children are aged 20, 16, 13 and 10 years old. Both myself and my husband are active and fit and we found the climb extremely hard. The first day is just 5-6 hours of climbing straight up the mountain with a zillion steps, some so large my 10 year old had to get a helping hand up. We knew my daughter and husband could possibly suffer from altitude sickness on the second day and we wanted to buy the oxygen canisters which they advertise, before we started, but they had run out!! What type of place runs out of essential climbing necessities?Nevertheless, we over nighted in the Pendant hut as we were going to do the Via Ferrata, walk the Torq after our summit the next day. With very little sleep as everyone is basically on bunk beds in a huge dormitory , we were woken at 1.30 am so that we could start the ascent at 2 am.It would take about 4 hrs if you are lucky.There are so many people starting at the same time that there are literally queues going up a mountain in the dark. After about an hour of climbing both my 10 year old and my husband were vomiting and feeling violently ill. If they had some oxygen it might have helped. Then we were told that they have NO emergency medication at base camp, so were their conditions to deteriorate any further their lives would be in danger especially children as their tolerance is low. So disappointed they and to turn back. This seems to be more of a money making expedition than actually giving people the true facts. The rest of us trudged on and this is where it gets so hard, breathing is hard as air is so thin, putting one foot in front of the next even harder. There are also some extremely slippery cliff side areas where had my 10 year old been there  n the dark I would have feared for her life.We did have  avery nice guide with us an she was very knowledgeable. So listen to your guides and don't veer of the path, it could be very dangerous.We finally made it to the summit at sunrise and we were fortunates that it was a clear sky, this does not happen very often I am told. It was really beautiful and the view was amazing. It is quite majestic up there at 4095m and as the sun comes out, the colours and shadows are truly brilliant. Just wish they would have given us the correct information so that we could have been more prepared then all of us could enjoyed the experience."
99,Hike in the dry season for best chance of summit,"I lived in Colorado for 2 years and climbed many 14ners there but Kinabalu (13,400ft) was better than any of those. There was such a diverse environment like I thought I was above the tree line, but then all of a sudden I was walking though a jungle again. A lot of it is walking through a rain forest and there are loads of ""natural"" steps. The hike down was way harder because of all the steps, but these aren't your normal steps. A lot of them are carved into the dirt floor, or made from roots from trees. They are very inconsistent in height and width. Some places above 11,000 feet requires the use of a rope to pull yourself up the rock face. I wasn't expecting that, but it made it more fun and challenging. Some people turned around when they saw you had to use this rope to climb. The bad thing about this was we were climbing in a group of about 75 people who were all staying at the Laban Rata lodge so there was a 10 minute line of people waiting to get on the ropes.I would recommend staying at the Laban Rata lodge for 1 night. Its a really nice place and is owned by the same guy who owns and operates the 5 star Sutera Harbour Hotel so the rooms and facilities are very nice. Includes dinner and breakfast. So you stay a night and then wake up at 2AM to hike about 3.5 hours to the summit. I summited at 5:45AM just as the sun was rising. The summit is small and not a lot of room for loads of people. There is a dinky fence that keeps you away from falling a very long way. A woman crossed this fence and died a few days before we summited. It bucketed rain coming down and the trail gets harder to walk because a lot of the trail is rocky and the wooden steps gets slippery. Some of the trail turned into a creek even. It was such a great experience though, harder than I imagined but such a fantastic climb! Book in advance as you need to get permit which are limited."
100,Prepared for yourself,Be prepared for lots of steps! We were told the trek to the summit would take 8 hours return. It took 3.5 hours which was a tad disappointing. Took us 4hours return in a mini van to get to the start.
101,Very rewarding ,"As this was my first mountaineering i was enjoyed rock climbing so much.The hike up is not strenuous if you are reasonably fit but should not be attempted with nagging whining partner who's is doing it because you want to get there. The rock bowl at the top is spectacular and makes easy walking under firm ground after the tropical ascent earlier.The mountain is beautiful. We firstly drove all the way up, where there's a viewing platform (and another one half way) with a magnificent view of Mount Kinabalu. We then drove back down to the resort/restaurant, where we walked in and got handed a trail-map of the surrounding jungle. We did to walks, one river walk (you can barely see a river), and the mountain view trail (barely a view either - there is a lot of jungle).It is definitely needed however a beautiful and non stressful journey worthy of enjoying every minute and absolutely amazing views. Such good value for money.I hope you will find it useful."
102,"A challenging climb, truly awesome.","Wanted to climb but couldn't do it due to the recent earthquake. Nonetheless, we visited the area n did some sightseeing ard the foothill of the mountain, the sceneries were beautiful n locals were warm n cheerful, indeed a place worth visiting. Stayed a night at Kundasang area, nice cooling weather, peaceful n quiet. Will visit again n conquer the mountain!"
103,So worth it,"Get yourself trained up before the trip though it is a relatively easy to follow trek, but the uphill steps definitely need lots of stamina and determination.The trip takes 2 or 3 days depends on whether you want to spend a night at the Park HQ or not, it is advisable to do so to accommodate to the altitude.Pack your day bag with plenty of water (1.5 liter at least) and some energy bar, it helps to restore stamina faster. And a set of clothes for changing when you reach Laban Rata as your mountain guide/porter might not reach the guest house at the same time, in our case our mountain guide reached at 6pm as he has to cover the last person, so we could take shower and have clothes to change even our bag carried by porter not reach yet.It is our first trek to Mt. Kinabalu so we choose the shorter route, Timpohon route (8.7km) is approximately 2km shorter than Mesilau. We started the trek at around 9am with a flight of steps lead downwards (but it will become your last nightmare on your journey back) in the beginning. There are plenty of resting place at average 1km distance or less, most of us reached 4km at around 1pm and had our quick lunch. We reached Laban Rata slightly less than 3pm and we had a very quick shower before it's getting colder at evening as there was no hot water provided in the guest house. After we reached Laban Rate and it started to drizzle, after 3 days we spend in the mountain range, we noticed that the rain normally come in after 3pm.The ascent starts around 3am the next morning, head lamp is a must for you to move around in pitch-dark. After Sayat-sayat check point (at 7km), the summit welcome you with a steep granite plateau elevated more than 440m in 1.7km distance. The ascent getting tougher as thin air and oxygen-deprived make every step so exhausted, we have to stop every few steps to catch our breath before we reached Low's peak at around 6.30am, we only managed to meet the dawn at Tungku Abdul Rahman Peak as we started our trek too late (should start at 2am). The temperature at the peak is at freezing point but it's getting warmer when the sunrise.The view from the peak is magnificent and all the thoughts we had during our ascent ""i never wanna come again"" vanished and every single effort is worthwhile.The descent is relatively relax, only that it's tough for the knees. We reached the HQ park at around 4pm and thereafter transferred to KK town."
104,Incredibly Beautiful but too many people!,"Mesilau trail is tougher (2 km longer distance and has a steep descent before going up again) than the way through the Timophon gate, but is more scenic and a lot less monotonous in terms of things to see. But it is tough, and my group of 5 took about 6 hours to get to Laban Rata which is already relatively fast. Laban Rata rest house is a cosy place, offering just basic accommodations. No hot water though, so bathing is an icy experience! the climb up to the summit is tougher, I thought. We started at 2.45am or so, and made it for sunrise at Low's peak, then we made our way back down to Laban Rata and reached at 8.30am for breakfast. We then made our way down, to Timophon gate this time round, in just under 3 hours. All in all, a reasonably tough physical challenge, but was very enjoyable."
105,The Climb of the honeymooners untrained.,"Did a 2D 1N tour with KINABALU TOUR GUIDE. My first ever mountain hiking. Reno is an extremely nice tour guide! Also, friendly and nice chatter Jackz! They are both awesome. The view on top of the mountain is so beautiful. But unfortunately it was raining that morning and I cant see the sunrise! What a waste! Beware that there is no hot water at Laban Rata. Overall it was all good! My first big achievement on 2014 :DDDD"
106,My tips for Mt Kinabalu,"well it was more effort to book the climb and accommodation than to climb the mountain. it is a rip off what they charge people to climb the mountain and they push you all the way so its not a very relaxing trip, its very physical and you will need a day or 2 to recover, glad we had walking poles. also dont leave valuables in the secure area at the start of the walk, i had friends tell me that had gear stolen so i took all valuables with me though they still managed to steel stuff. still it is worth the effort"
107,Not as simple as I thought !!,"we spent 10 days at various locations far and close to the mountain. We didn't climb it, 1. we're not climbers, 2. Not rich enough, 3. not Malaysian . i love mountain vistas and it looks great from everywhere except the jungle path below - you cant see it."
108,be careful to book via ferrata! WHY?,"We hiked Mount Kinabulu in a day and just wanted to share with any others interested that is is possible and an amazing experience, I suppose if you consider yourself 'very fit' and have experience of walking up mountains. In Kota Kinabalu it was hard to find out any info on a one day hike and many tourist operators say you can't do it - but you can, at the moment anyway. You have to go to the National Park headquarters at the bottom of the mountain the day before you want to hike and meet with a park ranger. He should then give you a permit and your good to do it the next day (so long as theres not too many people wanting to do it then - limited number of permits). We were lucky with amazing weather and clear views all day. It was very challenging and we had to keep our pace up - didn't need to be fast but couldn't hang around either. We did it in 8.5 hours and were exhausted by the end and very sore a few days after. But don't be put off doing it if you want to - it is achievable (if you are very fit) and don't let people put you off it. It was an incredible challenge and experience. BUT to let you know - people at the mountain are saying that the one day hike is going to be stopped soon (in a month or so?), mostly because they make less money and some people don't make it. BUT the good news is apparently they are planning to make the 2 day hike cheaper in the future - so that you can book 2 days without having to pay a huge price to the Sutera lodges people..though I think this might mean taking your own food and not sleeping at Sutera.. not sure. Amazing experience!"
109,Climbing the mountain is one of the most rewarding things ever,My girlfriend and I attempted to climb the mountain yesterday (2 days 1 night package). It is relentless and it is worth stressing to people of 'average' fitness or inexperienced at climbing or hiking that you may well struggle with this if our experience is anything to go by! We read a lot of relatively positive reviews so we attempted it but after 3km we headed back down as it was too tough! Massive respect to anyone who has attempted and completed this climb.
110,Mt Kinabalu National Park is one of the most splendid spots in Borneo; Must Must Visit,"the views at the peak were breathtaking at sunset , the hike is actually very pleasant. the decent form the peak is the hardest , i would recommend taking two sticks to assist with the descend"
111,Unbelievable sense of achievement!,"We decided to climb this mountain as a bit of fun! Moderate fitness required....really pretty good fitness plus stamina required.  A lot of stairs, relieved to reach Labenrata, in bed by 615 exhausted. Up at 130am to summit....did not make sunrise and was physically tough due to altitude. Absolutely beautiful worth the trouble. Unfortunately what goes up must come down...and many hours later, with very sore knees arrive back at Timpohon Gates.  You will need several days to recover.  Tips....travel as light as possible and if you can pay your guide to carry your bag. Take plenty if snacks and water.  Enjoy, once in a life time experience."
112,Amazing place,"its not as easy. tips for other travelers, do rmb to bring some medication especially altitude sickness pill and painkiller . will help along the way. and the summit is real cold so thick winter clothing is advisable ."
113,Extroadinary plants.,"the view is simply amazing, unfortunately it rained heavily during the first day of the climb and i got soaked to the bone, but it did give me the chance to see some really cool worms and frogs and leaches that i wouldnt have otherwise seen. also during the climb i was stuck in a cloud so it limited the views going up, but it all cleared up on the 2nd day and it was well worth the climbMAKE SURE TO GET A WALKING STICK it will be your best friend. a poncho is a must"
114,Be fit and prepared and you'll love it!,"We didn't climb the mountain but spent 2 days walking around the trails. The staff in the visitor reception are really helpful. The liwagu trail was great which runs along the river, as it has lovely views and some great wildlife. We got transport up and walked down this trail, which suited us. At the top of this trail (the beginning of the summit trail too) there is a platform where you can feed squirrels which is fun, and has incredible views. On some trails we managed to get a bit lost and didn't not find them as well marked as we had hoped. The buffet restaurant there is ridiculously expensive but the Liwagu restaurant is more reasonable and beautifully designed."
115,Awesome walk - but don't underestimate it!,"The climb was tough but definitely worth it. You can start the climb between 7-9am, we chose to start at 7. We climbed to the peak in a single day, climbed down to the hostel on the mountain, and then climbed the rest of the way down at 2am the following morning.It is possible to climb to the hostel and then do the peak at 2am the next day. It is good to ask your guide about the chance of being able to see the sunrise because often the clouds shield a good view of it.Also, if you opt to do the 2am climb to the peak, be aware that you will be ascending with the crowds, possibly making it less enjoyable. We were much happier to go to the peak without having to go through crowds of people which is one reason we did the full hike in a day."
116,Definitely a must! Buffet food at lodges. Amazing views,"Did the trek September 2012 my partner and I, it is the most fantastic experience . It's tough but with reasonable fitness it's achievable, it's like walking up your stairs 2/3 steps at a time for 4+ hours, at altitude, and that's only to Laban ratan (half way house in time not distance) we are both in our mid 50s and reasonably fit we do plenty of walking, we got to Laban ratan 3 and 3/4 hours, think the secret is to take short rests do not sit down and continue as soon as breathing gets back to normal, the longer you have at Laban ratan, the more time you have to acclimatise to the high altitude, making to summit the next morning achievable, walking in pitch black, other than your head torch across granite slopes and a few rope assisted climbes, ideally the earlier you can set off for the summit the better as you will miss the crowds, we were the 2nd to reach the summit that morning, and we sheltered to await the sun rise, your guide times it just right so as not to be waiting too long as very cold at the top, the sun rise is amazing and well worth the effort. Then it's the hike down, just as hard or harder than the hike up. It's a fantastic experience with dramatic views and a real sense of achievement.Ps, it's freezing at Laban ratan, no heating but adds to the experience Good luck if you give it a go"
117,A bit of a slog but impressive views,"We did the 2 day, 1 night Mt Kinabalu climb to the summit in April 2013. A great experience, well worth it and something you will never forget.Firstly be prepared - it is not impossible but it is so much easier if you have trained and done stairs and/or hill work. It was sad seeing people really struggling so that they couldn't enjoy the experience. We had trained well and were a bit sore for a few days afterwards, but nothing to stop us getting around and enjoying the rest of our holiday.Also be prepared weather wise - it could rain and it is cold at the summit.You need wet weather gear in case of rain and have it well enclosed/protected in your back back, otherwise all your clothes will end up soaked and there is no way of drying them. Prior to going to the summit there had been quite a bit of rain and the granite rock was slippery, particularly coming down. We had hiking boots and slipped a little, but the people in runners were continually on their behinds! So possible in runners but not ideal.We got to the summit at about 5.25am well before sunrise and once you stop moving it is cold until the sun rises. So layers are required, a good covering beanie and warm gloves are a must. The gloves are also needed for holding the rope when climbing on the granite rock in some sections and must be gloves that are waterproof.Luckily we didn't suffer from altitude sickness although I got a throbbing headache at 3000m. Fortunately after some dispirin it went away and I think spending time at Laban Rata helped acclimatise. Plenty of water and not going too fast are what everyone recommends. We each drank 2 litres of water getting to Laban Rata. There is good drinking water at Laban Rata where you can fill up.Now to the walk.It took us 4.5 hours to get to Laban Rata on the first day leaving at 9.30am - a steady walk with lots of steps but you get to rest at huts along the way. We kept our rests to about 5 minutes other than 20 minutes for lunch. Our guide could see we were going ok and he wanted to finish before the rain started. I did the walk in t-shirt and shorts and was very comfortable, and we arrived at Laban Rata at 2pm and although a shower would have been nice we weren't up to a cold shower. We had a nice cup of tea, chatted to people and watched people come in wet as it had started to rain heavily.There is nothing to do at Laban Rata but the time went quick as everyone is pretty excited and anxious about the summit climb. At about 5pm the evening meal came out - everyone was hungry and enjoyed a great meal with plenty of food.     We tried to go to bed about 7.30pm but our dormitory of 6 didn't settle down until about 9pm. It was strange trying to breathe at 3400m. It was actually warm in the dormitory and we didn't need the 2 blankets provided. After not much sleep and listening to he rain, everyone started getting up at 1.30am. We had a nice light breakfast and our guide started us going at 2.40am. Fortunately the rain had stopped and it was a clear night. I was wearing long pants, shirt, light jacket, good beanie and gloves and felt very comfortable whilst walking - but I knew I would need a jumper once I got to the summit.      The walk was steeper and rope was required in many sections, but it was exciting walking in the dark seeing a trail of headlamp in front and behind. As we got closer, it got harder as you breathed harder, but I never felt that I wouldn't make it. The headlamps in front of us started to get very steep and we knew we didn't have long to go. Once at summit at 5.25am there was a great sense of achievement and everyone was taking photos, but then it started to get cold. We shivered until about 6am but luckily were able to stay up at the summit. The sunrise was spectacular and the peaks started to appear. The view was immense and we could see the lights of KK and the coast. We could also see what we had climbed in the dark and it was a bit scary. We started down at 6.30am and got back to Laban Rata at 8.30am. The views were spectacular going down and there were some tricky sections to tackle. the breakfast was superb, including lovely pancakes.After packing we left at 9.15am as our guide again was worried about beating the rain. The walk down is a bit of an anti climax, other than encouraging the climbers just starting coming up. After about 3.5 hours we were back down and ready for a rest.My wife found the walking sticks she had hired at Timphoon Gate particularly useful coming down.All in all, a great experience well worth doing, and we were satisfied to have achieved it as we had never been that high before."
118,Hard but worth it! ,"We did this climb a few years ago and it is a great experience, we trained for it but did struggle a bit near the summit Make sure you have boots that are suitable for climbing as coming down can put a lot of pressure on your toes if you don't have the correct foot ware.  We didn't pre book just turned up got a guide and of we went, guide does carry most of your kit."
119,Not a walk in the park...,"My third time climbing the mountain, the climb was still physically and mentally challenging and the mountain still never cease to awe me. One thing changed though is that Sutera Sanctuary Lodge has increase the price of accommodation again and also stopped providing hot water for shower and room heater due to ""environmental"" reason since 3 years ago. I had them the last 2 times and I paid a lot cheaper price for accommodation. I opted for the 2 days 1 night package as I thought the 3 days 2 nights was just an excuse for them to make more money. No need to stay at park HQ the night before the climb, you can get cheaper and better accommodation in KK.It is the kind of thing you have to do once in your lifetime, but it is probably not worth doing it again. I have done it 3 times and I think I have been ripped off enough by Sutera and I am finally calling it quits. The mountain deserves a 5 stars rating but I am only giving it 4 because of overcharging by Sutera."
120,All side amazing,"This is the best hiking in MalaysiaPath are clear, Guide are very helpful and majestic view from the topFor only 2 days you will be at 4095.2 Meter.... The only problem is its getting more expensive every year and monopolize by the private company.... However recommend to go at least once in life time."
121,Wonderful hike to the summit,"It’s about 9 kilometers to get to the top and in general it’s done in two days. For an athlete one day would be possible, but it’s not a walk in a park. Well, literally it’s a walk in a park, but still requires a serious effort. There are several huts and they need to be booked beforehand as it’s a popular destination. One local said one week earlier is usually enough if you have a specific date on your mind; we booked one month earlier for Christmas eve and all the huts were full. There were the mandatory Swedes, but also loads and loads of locals, Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, Polish, Italians, Americans, Canadians even some Finns and you name it. Easiest way is to take a package to cover climbing permit, hut and food supply. We used Dive Downbelow and service was great. Packages include guide, but the track is pretty straight forward so you don’t really need them to guide you. It’s more like an insurance if you have any trouble getting up or down; as it was a case with many a traveller. Huts are at 3200 meters and there’s a restaurant and shop as well. So you don’t need to pack piles of protein bars and water with you (prices are on the high side thou). Most rooms are dorms, but there are also VIP options with a private room and a hot shower. First six kilometers up to the huts are is like walking up stairs. There are plenty of covered resting points with toilets, garbage bins and also rain water is available (you need to clean it before drinking). Hiking starts around 09.00 and you’ll be at the huts around 1500. When you get to the huts you’ll get your room and there’s a buffet at  16.30 that runs quite late as people arrive at different times (that’s the basic package). The rooms can be chilly, but there are couple of blankets. Better have a separate, full body sleeping gear and a cap to keep warm. As it’s pretty fast process most people feel some mountain sickness; headache, dizziness, nausea, .. For most people it passes during the night as 3200m is a great height for acclimatization. Just remember to drink loads of water (not beer). Breakfast starts at 0200 and climb towards the peak at 0230. It’s cold and pitch black. I had a t-shirt, a warm fleece and a waterproof jacket and it was quite ok if you kept moving. Our luggage was lost by the flight operator, so we had to improvise a bit with some of the gear. Luckily it wasn’t raining on the morning as I wasn’t as waterproof as I like to be. Gloves are mandatory as there are loads of ropes and the wind can be really chilly; even people with gloves complained that their hands have been frozen numb. Head light is a must as well. I bought a pair of gloves from the park entrance and we found super cheap headlamps in Kota Kinabalu (bag with our own climbing gear had found it’s way to our hotel as we got back from the mountain). If you go too fast you have to rest all the time and then you get cold as there is no cover for the wind. Small, slow steps so that you can breathe normally is the best way to go; then you can keep a steady pace and stay warm. Summit track is 100% fun. It’s rocks and easy ropes, some hands on climbing, but all technically easy. It rains a lot on the mountain so rocks can be slippery. You need to have shoes with a good grip. For the height 4095 is not too bad; I am very apt to mountain sickness and I felt a growing headache while climbing and couple of pangs of dizziness. They passed while we sitting on the peak and waiting for the sun. Sunrise and view are amazing, definitely worth the trip. As with most climbs getting  down is the hard part. With the proper visibility and ropes getting to the huts is quite ok. There’s a second round a breakfast waiting and loads of happy people. The days have taken their toll and people were looking at their visibly trembling legs. As getting to the peak is the exciting part people tend to forget that there are still 6 km of stairs waiting for them. So better enjoy a long breakfast and do some stretching before heading down. We passed many people with cramping thighs and other problems. My own knee was put back facing forward this February after a skiing accident and it started give out serious trouble after couple of kilometers of stairs. Rest of the way was limping down sideways and mind you, we still were not slowest. There’s not such trouble that passing out from exhaustion in the van, a lovely Christmas dinner (there was a Santa Claus with turquoise kohl), a few tiger beers, a few GT’s and Panacod wouldn’t fix."
122,Amazing Borneo Tours,This mountain is slightly taller than mt Fiji and it is more tough. The hike is very beautiful and guide friendly. Sunrise is best. I love their culture.  It is good to prepare well and I learn alot from my tour agant. I booked with Amazing Borneo and they are very kind and professional.
123,Not beginner level altitude mountaineering,"Take around three hours to there,and u must challenge to climb.u must enjoy all the way,the staff and mountain tour guide are friendly and helpful."
124,Wonderful spot for trekking,"It's a very hard hike to the top but the views from there are extremely rewarding. There are way too many people doing the climb so it gets a little bit uncomfortable at times, like a traffic jam in a big city!"
125,A Rewarding Climb,"Your fitness level will be equal to your enjoyment!The hike to base camp was fantastic, amazing scenery that changed from jungle to tundra to rock. Our guide Andy was a wealth of knowledge about fauna and flora as well customs and legend.Descending hikers were all so pumped about the view from the top, which was really very encouraging for some in our group who were struggling. A really great vibe from most of the hikers.Your guide will assess you abilities and speed so as to able to calculate your departure time from base camp so your able to reach the summit before dawn. If you don't reach the security check point by 5:30am you will not be allowed to continue!We left a member of our group here due to his increasing shortness of breath, he stated even from this point the view and sunrise is breathtaking. (Toilets, water and shelter at this location)From the summit the slow reveal as the sun pushed back the darkness, was word failingly majestic. Pictures don't do it justice. You'll appreciate the darkness of your ascent, hiding the sheer enormity of the climb revealed on your decent."
126,More challenging that expected. Fitness and proper gear needed,"Booked through Amazing Borneo for the 2D/1N trek. Had THE BEST guide called Joe who spoke great English, was very friendly and chatty but most importantly ensured my safety was paramount. Had prepared myself for it to be hard - which it was, but no harder than expected. Hardest part is simply having the energy to cope with tiredness and altitude sickness while climbing the final 1.5kms very early in the morning. Worth it at the top though. Rest house had great food and HUGE mugs of hot chocolate which were perfect after the first day. Beds in dorm surprisingly comfortable, but only criticism was that there was alot of noise heared during the night - more the other guests fault than the rest houses. I got very lucky with the weather and had no rain for any of the trekking time. Wonderful experience overall, highly recommend it."
127,"Amazing, challenging experience","I ask for a ""1 day climb"" to save some bucks (a lot actually) and it was harder than  i thought, but i was lucky with the weather, the most important thing!I showed up at the HQ at 6:45, tourist weren't there yet so i paid the fees fast (100rm for climbing permit, 7rm for insurance and 128 for the guide) and rode to tympon gate (1800m high) where the climb starts.After 2h10' of steep forest climb i reached Laban Rata where the guide allowed me 20' break, bring your own drinks and food, coz in there is very expensive (nescafe 11rm!)after about 2 more hours i reached the top (before 12 noon) and i took 30 minutes rest in the silence that only a mountain peak can give you.This is the other benefit to climb in one day, if u join the 2 day climb you will enjoy the summit with other 200people!!!it was just me and the guide!!!Descending is very painful for tigh muscle, toes and knees but the rising oxygen percentage is goint to give you back energy the lower you are.we reached the bottom around 3:30 pm and went back to my room for early rest.Before the climb you will sign a form where you will accept to turn back your climb if you can't reach Laban rata before 12 or the peak before 1pm, and in case of rain also u will be required to turn back (after 3600m is just rock, very slippery if wet)Once back allow yourself a overnight rest since it will be hard to do anything else after this day climb.i was staying at ""mountain rest house"" just 300m downhill the HQ gate, 30rm for private room with sunset view and walkable distance to HQ gate."
128,Much harder than we though,"We booked with Dive Down below who were great. Good transfer from hotel to Mountain. Take heaps of photos, need to take your own lunch as the supplied lunch is ordinary. Plenty of water and a poncho. Also hire a walking stick, this is essential for the walk down the mountain. Accommodation fantastic and buffet style food. Guide was very helpful. Awesome experience"
129,Amazing climb,"Would recommend fitness training prior attempting. Incredible experience with priceless views and sense of achievement at the summit! Guides are great to learn from, only able to talk when resting or descending. we were happy to tip guide at end of climb. Walking pole significant help (can hire for 10ringit at timpohon gate - get in early). Food is incredible and endless buffet, although packed lunch little sustenance so strongly recommend taking your own high calorie snacks. Extra food/ drinks very expensive to purchase at Laban Rata. Take extra 50ringit for room key deposit.  Thermals, wind proof jacket, gloves and beanie ESSENTIAL for summit climb (freezing temperatures dangerous otherwise). You can hire jacket and gloves for 20ringit each at laban rata. Also need headlamp!!! Expect painful descent and plan rest days following. Bus to sandakan from headquarters not reliable (often full already) - easier to bus back to KK. Great experience!!!!"
130,Amazing hiking!!!!,"We climbed Mt Kinabalu as part of a group trip. The first day walking is hard uphill steps most of the way in humid conditions. You get sweaty quick so pack light and take lots of water. You can hire walking sticks which are a must for the way up and down. Porters pass carrying water, sheets, food, gas etc and run back down to go again. Accommodation at Laban Rata is good and a decent sleep is needed before the final climb at 2.30am. The trip to the summit is hard and you do need gloves for the ropes needed to pull yourself up. Warm clothes are essential for the summit.Such an amazing adventure and a hard descent but worth it. Guides are amazing and look after you all the way."
131,My first international climb,"I joined a 2 day climb to Mt Kinabalu via Amazing Borneo Tours who provided a great local guide Mr Julius. It was both physically and mentally challenging throughout 2 days and 2 nights. Staying in a shared room with five other strangers was new to me but travelers shared their valuable experiences of climbing with me. First day was raining and it was like climbing on waterfall treks. With a pair of good climbing shoes (luckily not trainers), I really enjoyed the ascend up to 3000m. I thought I saw gardens made in paradise along the ascend. It was an amazing sight. Next morning at 230am, I had the most unforgettable experience climbing bare rocks. It was so scary at first due to the sheer slope and darkness. Instead of hanging on a line of rope which was slippery and I did not wear a proper pair of gloves, my guide decided to be my live rope. We held hand in hand, navigating hard rocks until the top. It was one of the most terrifying experience but I was very proud at the end I made it to the top safe and alive. And this experience was worth it. Having said that, the most challenging part was descending down all the way to the bottom from 11am to 4pm. I was tired, my knees were wobbling and my big toes were bruised. My shoes were not helping this time but luckily I had two walking sticks which saved the journey. Painstakingly, I made it down. Full of pride, full of awe and full of hopes. I will definitely recommend this climb to physically fit people with a pair of good shoes, gloves and walking sticks! Could not walk properly for 3 days though."
132,"If you only do One thing while in Kota Kinabalu, So this","It was a challenging but rewarding trip. It was good that i did not know the differences in the 2 trails- Mesilau is 2km longer than theTimpohon trail. I thought Mesilau was better & gradual until on the day itself, our guide told us the fact that though Mesilau trail was more scenic, it is more challenging than Timpohon (due to the ascending & descending nature of the route).We managed to reach layang2 at around noon time before heading to laban rata.The last 100m was horrendous as each meter seems like 500 meters.The best experience at gunting ladahan was bathing in icy cold water & i had to wear 2 jackets to nap.We reached the low's peak at 430am after embarking at 2am.It was super cold but the thought of seeing the sunrise brought some warmth for us.Overall, it was a great trip!"
133,Definitely a ONCE in a lifetime experience,Mt view was great and tree top walk. Hot springs a joke!! Tub with a tiny tub and only got to our ankles after half a hour. Need a lot of time to fill the tubs. Horrible squeaky bus for 3 hour trip spoilt the journey
134,Beautiful views,When visiting KK a must do is to visit Mount Kinabalu. We were hoping to do the 2 day 1 night climb but unfortunately half way up the mountain altitude sickness got the better of me and we had to turn back. I would suggest being quite fit to climb it as we were a bit surprised with how steep it was. The staff were so wonderful when I got sick and went out of their way to assist us.
135,Worth the climb!,"I took the Mersilau trial and was captivated at how scenic this trail was. Although it is 2 KM longer than the Timpohon trail, it is worth the time and effort. For first time climbers take the Mersilau on the accent and Timpohon on the decent. You won't regret it! I enjoyed every minute of it and I'm sure you will too."
136,Beautiful mountain!,"I was initially going to book 2 days climb but given the price, I decided to come back to Sabah with a budget planned for this climb: around MYR 800 in total. However I found out at the last minute that the climb could be done in one day without reservation at a price of not over MYR 300 (MYR 100 permit, MYR 128 guide, MYR 7 insurance, MYR 33 transportation, MYR 15 park entrance). The difference is that with the 1 day climb you are taking a gamble as if it starts raining or if you can't make it to the lodge by 12pm and to the top by 1pm (almost impossible to make it from the lodge to the top in 1hour), then the guide will force you to turn back. Therefore not only you have to race against the time but also against the weather. I decided to take a chance (14th of August 2013: not the ideal season to climb) and I reached the top in 4h40min.It wasn't cold but hot because you are constantly moving (day time). In fact I was wearing a tank top the whole time up to the top. Thank god I had gloves which are needed to grab the rope especially when it's wet. I had bad shoes: running shoes and it was really dangerous (slippery) especially on the granite. My bag was really light, I didn't even need to take water but a small bottle is recommended in the event you really need to wet your throat. I had only a pack of biscuit which I shared with my guide and it was enough. I didn't need to eat on throughout the climb because I had a big breakfast but when I reached the top, my body really needed sugar. I didn't exercise before although it is recommended - I am not what we call fit but I am strong minded and I already decided from the start that i was going to make it to the top (unless it rained).You will need a poncho to protect you and your bag from the rain. Also, don't take too many breaks as time is crucial and counted. If you start taking 5 minutes per break, you've already wasted lots of time. I personally took about 10 breaks of not over 30 seconds each.Take some instant coffee in your bag as you can use the hot water to make a coffee at the lodge (without paying extra fees). The instant 3 in 1 coffee at the lodge is at MYR4. The small bottle of water is at MYR 9 (due to the fact that these are carried all the way to the lodge). Also, there is a resthouse at 2 minutes walk from the park for MYR20 the night. You can also share a taxi or take a van or bus from KK to Kinabalu park for only MYR 20 each way. Last taxi is at MYR from the center. Last Bus from Kinabalu to KK is at 6.30pm. It's all flexible.I would recommend the climb in one day to people who likes to challenge themselves as there is a time limit. It's better to do the climb during the recommended season. I think it's March, so you don't have to race against the rain. I would also recommend to climb solo unless you know your partner is really fit as you would have to wait if your friend or partner can't follow, thus jeopardizing your chances to get to the top.Remark: We were 6 x people checking in the morning (2 x couples and 2 x solo climbers including me), 2 x guides made it to the top, the two couples didn't make it.Climb in 2 days:- You will reach the top for sure even tough it rains (they will allow you) or even tough you are slow. Based on my experience: shoes with rubber are very important. I fell down on the granite on my way down and had to hold onto my guide to descend as it was raining and granite/stones/rocks were slippery.Special thanks to Lasius who I would recommend to anyone, he is fantastic and can speak good English. He is also entertaining and easy to get along with. Good luck to all, it's a fantastic experience :)Hinda Z."
137,Pray for good weather,"You can read reviews of hikers saying its beautiful and kinda difficult and say I can do this. I am very active 40 year old. I will tell you honestly its the hardest thing I have done but most rewarding. Walking in a park everyday will not benefit u. Its like doing wide lunges vertically for hours and hours on end.anything from 4-6 hrs. So if you are not fit dont kid yourself. You will not find this enjoyable. Having said all the above, rhe experience for me has been wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who can take on the challenge for mind body and soul. Definitely go with mountain torq for via ferrata."
138,"Questionable tourist development, a place to avoid","It's a nice park to do other hikes as well but I think it's over rated and like the most parks in Borneo the hikes are steep, no good for somebody with bad knies. If you want to see birds or ather animals go somewhere where it is less busy. Poring hotprings is better also intrance to the Kota Kinabalu reserve. If you go therd go early."
139,Worst Hotel Ever,"We didn't underestimate this mountain at all but we were so lazy to do regular exercise for the climb. We only managed to have 10k jog/walk twice a week before the climb. We thought of cancelling the climb because we were not prepared at all. Because of the cost, we decided to still pursue the climb. God, help us. The mountain sure looked intimidating when were staring at it. We walked at our own pace and just kept on pushing ourselves. With the help of trekking poles and painkillers, we arrived at Laban Rata before the dinner was served at 4pm and ultimately at the Low's Peak summit just in time for the sunrise. What an achievement for us as couples! It was really not the mountain we conquered but ourselves. :) When we were going down, we thought of how the heck did we manage to climb this? Yes, go for it. You can do it too! God bless."
140,My Spiritual Climbing and best memory ever in Sabah!,So beautiful.  Did an organised tour with English speaking guide.Get up close to all the natural flora from that area.  Recommended.
141,Amazing experience highly recommended ,I did the mersilau-timpohon trail. Loved the mersilau trail as it is scenic and beautiful though it is a longer route to the summit. Totally dislike the timpohon trail - it is more stoney and more stairs.Summit climb is challenging but if you are well prepared with some good training on both legs & arms and appropriate clothes - it is achievable.
142,Great views of the mountain from the road,"Totally worth it. The toughest part is probably the descent, the roped part is so well guided that is no where near and hard as we were led to believe. But book some chill out time afterwards to let your legs recover."
143,We needed a good few days to recover 😌,"My group started to hike 10.30am from timpohon gate. The first 2km was slow and easy. December is a raining season in sabah, remember to bring raincoat or poncho if u wanna hike around this time of year. Mentally and physically challenging hiking experience. I reached laban rata at 3.15pm. Had dinner buffet starting 4pm until 7pm. The next day we began our hike to summit at 2.30am and i reached 6am at the top of mount kinabalu to see the most beautiful sunrise. Make sure u use waterproof glove and a proper attire to the top. 😊"
144,Well worth the effort!,"The beautiful mountain of Malaysia. View is amazing from the top.I been to Everest, Manasalu, Annapurna in Nepal and Been to India for climbing some peak too, The first i thought it is hard but not at all. The accommodation is quite hard to find but if you book early no problems :)"
145,"Awesome experience, worth the cost","We are a 25 year old couple of average fitness and found this a perfectly achievable climb. As this is touted as being one of the most accessible mountains in the world to climb then there are a lot of people who are seemingly unprepared for it and can be seen crawling to Laban Rata at about 7pm, but who cares. Whether you make it up at 1pm or 10pm, or make it to the summit or not, it doesn't matter as it's such a great achievement. I found there was a bit of snobbery from more experienced climbers. We made it up in just over 6 hours, walked incredibly slowly and took breaks at every resthouse. We saw loads of people powering past us, not taking breaks, but they were the ones suffering at the top, not us. My partner had altitude sickness and didn't make it to the summit, and in fact I saw a lot of people suffering along the way to the top so my only suggestion is sip lots of water throughout the climb and take some panadol before bed. The view is unlike anything I've ever seen in my life, was incredible! Our biggest problem was the descent. Maybe we took it too slowly as for a few days after words we could not walk down stairs or bend over! Accomodation was awful but there was actually a rather nice selection of food which was a surprise. I'd always recommend contacting Sutera Sanctuary Lodges directly to book as you save yourself an absolute bundle of cash when I heard what others had been paying. So pace yourself, keep hydrated and you'll have a great time!"
146,"Beautiful mountain, terribly overpriced","We are reasonable fit 30s couple. Timing for us was:First day, Timpohon Gate to Laban Rata - 8am - 2.30pmSecond day, Laban Rata to peak - 3am - 6amPeak to Laban Rata 7am - 8.30amLaban Rata to base 9.30am - 2.30pmldWords cannot describe how brilliant the views are from the top. The great challenge of the climb followed by the beauty of sunrise from the ""top of the work"" felt so rewarding. Our guide, Robert was excellent. We felt safe with him and he played amajor part in encouraging my other half to make it to the top. The cost is expensive and probably prohibitive for many but if you can afford it then ,ake the most and go for it. Make sure you a rte prepared for rain and clouds and inundation come in abround 10.30-11 each morning in Novemeber and December."
147,"A stunning climb, but cut short","Mt Kinabalu is a great challenge if you are moderately fit. I did the two day climb with a friend and found it rewarding, without it being too difficult. I had initially thought that it may have been out of my fitness level, but I was reassured as I climbed up the mountain and watched some of the people come bouncing down from the day before. We arrived at the Laban Rata huts by late morning and had the rest of the day to hang out and recover. The accommodation at Laban Rata is pretty good. It is typical hostel/backpacker style accommodation with buffet food. The only negative was the hot water system wasn't working while we were there, and after having a shower I got the impression that they use ice melt as their water source. Most of the people I spoke to didn't shower while staying here. I also had no issue with being cold at night even without the rooms being heated, each bed has a thick duvet.We got up early the next morning to make the final climb to the summit. The summit climb is slow going as every one leaves at once and there are sections that require climbing up slopes with the aid of ropes. We arrive to the summit earlier than expected, which was unfortunate as sitting around in temperature below 0 degrees Celsius isn't one of my favorite pastimes. I would suggest having a chat with your guide and discussing what time they recommend leaving for the summit. Also, bring gloves, I forgot mine and it was a lesson I wont soon forget.Once the sun has come up its time to head back down the mountain. This is when you get the best views as it is no longer dark and you get the views of the sun coming up. It is also the hardest bit. Climbing down the uneven path will make your muscles ache and I was glad to get to the bottom.I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a challenge and a bit of an adventure. It is expensive in comparison to other activities in Borneo, but well worth it. For less active people I would recommend regular walks in the weeks leading up to climbing this."
148,worth visiting sabah again,"Mount k is the highest peak in southeast Asia.I took the mersilau route and 3 days 2 nights package, in which spending one night relaxing in mersilau park. I prefer the mersilau route compare to timpohon although it was further. There are more scenic view and enjoyable compare timpohon.You have to check weather when you planning your climb as bad weather may disappoint you. It's an awesome experience for me and would definitely go again."
149,Awesome View.,"It’s a bit challenging for beginner mountain hiker. But it should take this experience for your next hiking level. More getting higher, you can enjoy the place of quietness and cold weather. You can experience how local people keep the hiking path to clean and maintainability. Every hiking guide pick up every rubbish they found on the way. That’s really impressive attitude and how much they appreciate their natural resources. There is really amazing cloud sea view when you get to the peak of the mountain. So that you should go to reach at the peak before the sunrise too high. Please do not forget to bring your sunglasses, that will protect you from brightening sunlight."
150,Well organized trek route in the world,"I have just climbed Mount Kinabalu with Borneo Trails. Actually it was my very first time to climb any kinds of mountain in my life. It made me so nervous and so inquisitive about every single details of this climb, but thanks to Borneo Trails who patiently answer to my every questions, I was so ready to take on this challenge before the climb date. One of the tips I would say to those planning to climb Mount Kinabalu is bring your trekking poles. Trekking poles helped me a lot on the way down. My friend didn't take kind advise from Borneo Trails seriously and suffered from sore muscles the next few days. You can rent trekking poles at RM12 from Park HQ."
151,Prepare for a good work out,"Climbing the mountain was a wonderful experience. It is not an easy climb, but doable if you have a normal level of fitness. We left at 8 am and were at the lodge at 12.30. Next morning we left the lodge at 3 am, and spend at least an hour overtaking the large groups of slower walkers. After that it was a great hike up to the peak, with a nice meditative feel to it and arrived about 30 minutes before sunrise. We took plenty of short breaks. If you want to avoid overtaking the groups in the morning, leave around 2 am, but be warned: you'll freeze your butt off on the summit, waiting for the sun to rise. The whole trek is pretty straightforward and the paths are well-maintained. Harder bits have stairs or ropes. It may be harder if it is rainy. Descending puts quite some load on your knees, so plan to take plenty of breaks or bring a walking stick for the descent. Also bring warm clothes for the summit and some powersnacks (we loved Nips). We booked through Sautura Sanctuary Lodge and paid 1300 RM for 2 people, including all permits, insurance, guidefees and the accomodation and meals at Laban Rate (actually were placed in a lodge about 10 minutes uphill from it). The meals are very good, a bit too good even, since they could have cut greatly on the costs by providing a bit simpler meals. The dorms are very basic, however and there was no warm water or heating (and no discount for the lack of it). The price for the lodge is extortionately high. And the porters and guides only get a very small amount, so someone (Sautara) is making a lot of money from it. I have no problem paying the park fees, since these are clearly well spend, but the pricing of the lodge is a disgrace. The trek is great, though ;) We went to the Park headquarters the night before the trek and stayed in the guesthouse just beside it on the main road (Mountain lodge or something like that). Great value for money (RM 40 for a double). This also makes that you can leave early and beat the crowds."
152,Make sure you train!,Go hike this mountain if you've never done this before. Booked with Amazing Borneo Tours and had a guide which came along to assist the hike. Do not worry about travelling solo as this is a very popular tour that you meet other hikers too.The stay at Laban Rata is pretty good and simple with buffet food included as part of the tour package. View from the summit is totally worth it and be prepared for altitude sickness if you get it.This hike is not for the weak so ensure you do some exercise months before hiking.
153,"Climbing Mount Kinabalu, Sharing What I Learnt on my Climb","managed to get to the top and the came down. as we were on a tight schedule to catch a flight to KL we had to almost race down which had a toll on the legs the next day. Definately worth seeing the sun rise although only about 10% of all the climbers managed it. The rest made it to the top but not for sunrise. I would suggest, sleeping normally and the taking your time the next morning AFTER breakfast unless you are in your 20's."
154,Be Mesmerized by Nature.,"I had no mountain climbing experience and this is my first mountain ever! 6 months prior to the climb, i got myself busy jogging and did high impact aerobics 3-4 times a week. High impact aerobics consume a lot of energy and this is a good exercise i would suggest if you are not planning for any hill/mountain trips before climbing Kinabalu.We use Mesilau trail to Laban Rata and it took about 8-9 hours if you go in slow pace like me. The view during the climb was superb! Check helipad and bongsai garden area for nice photos!!! During this 8-9 hours climb, i brought 2L isonotonic drinks, some chocolates and dates for energy. I would like to remind you, there will be many squirrels at the rest huts and they were aggressive too (they were looking for food). After 5km walk, i decided to rest on the stairs to topup some energies and there were no squirrels there :DAfter had some coffee and dinner, i took some rest and start climbing to the peak at 2.45am. It was all stairs for 700 meters up. And then rope climbing 500 meters up to Sayat Sayat checkpoint. Arrived Sayat Sayat at 4.30am. If you arrive Sayat Sayat after 5am, you are not allowed to continue climbing to the peak! The rope part at danger zone was the worst part for me as i lost a lot of energy. With strong wind and low temperature, some may experience dizziness and hard to breath. I just go slow and maintain my breath and reach the peak with slow pace at 6am. The view from the peak is really mesmerizing!! There were group of people dancing (Sumazau) to Gunung Kinabalu song and it was fun. Do not forget to record them in video if you are Sumazau-ing at the top of Kinabalu too.Well, going up is a true excitement. Going down is a true disaster!! Follow the rope and hold the rope when you are going down. Need to be extra careful and watch your steps when you go down. You will never realize that you will be going down and it is really steep! I didn't believe myself that I have been climbing that steep! This is the time when you feel your legs all sore. And you will swear you will not come here again (because i did!). Do not swear too soon because once you are already going down to the Timpohon Gate, you will miss the climbing moment again. And to my surprise, i am planning for Kinabalu climb again next year! Because i miss Mount Kinabalu already."
155,The regional namesake,"Initially tried to book through the hotels in the area but it was very expensive ranging from 350 dollars up !! .. as I was already there I decided to go to the national park to find out if there is another option - the staff at the reception was quite friendly asked me to come the next day at 7:00 to try my luck which I did and in the end the price I got was - 200 MYR for park entrance fee - 7  for Insurance and 212 MYR for the one and only hostel at the top plus we had to pay for the guide around 230 MYR - as the guide can be shared among 5 - I was lucky enough to get 3 other where ended up splitting the cost among us 4 ( 57.5 MYR) each. So in total it was around 114 USD ( which was fine compared to what I got)As I did not have the gear , the staff recommended me to buy a 'adidas kampung' as they call it (which is a rubber boot ) which was quite good from the shop in front of the park. There was no place I could rent a jacket or head torch and they said I can rent it from the top which was a big mistake - a 1.5l water bottle cost 4 dollars plus the head torch cost 6 dollars and the jacket cost 6 dollars ... so better get down than up :-) and u have to pay in ringet.You have to be really fit to do this climb ... the first 6 km to the hostel is at an average speed over 6 hours and from 4km onwards it's pretty steep. Once u get there u are exhausted especially when u get caught in the rain. The same night at 1:30 am u wake up to have supper and leave to reach the peak before sunrise which is about 2.5km which is quite a challenge as it is dark and u really have to use the rope to climb on certain areas - with my slow pace and tiredness it took me close to 4 hours to get there therefore I did not get even 5 minutes to rest at the peak as we have to cover 8.5 km staring away to reach the bottom before it gets dark.I was nearly dead by the time I reached the hostel from the first 2.5km ... only got 30 min to rest and had to leave immediately for the next 6km ... I struggled and was so slow as my knees were all wobbly - kept falling down especially when the rain did not stop at all.After the first 3km i just could not move and my guide helped me - they are like sherpas - for them to carry a 55kg person is like nothing so they quote prices as they want. So for me they said it is 300 MYR per km so if it's 3km it's 900 MYR which is around 214 dollars which was very expensive for me ... so they made a deal where the guide help on difficult bits and I told him I had only 60 dollars to spare so help me out where he feel it's necessary.The guides were very reliable and helpful and they respect you --the view was amazing but I think two days is not a safe number of days to do such a hike - plus the prices on the top should be visible at the bottom to be sure we carry enough money.  Plus Insurance policy must be clear , by that way we do not have to bargain with the guides . A proper listing of the things needed should be handed over or must be visible to those who are planning to go up ."
156,Lifetime highlight with kids in tow,"our guides name was Richard. He was a very lovely man with alot of local knowledge. The climb was not easy.The 2am climb was so hard, due to lack of sleep . No warm water for showers at Resthouse. My overall experience was amazing though. My legs ached for days after but the climb was worth it all."
157,Some tips for the hiking,"The only reason for the one day attempt to summit was, that I did not get any accomodation/ two day package at the Sutera Harbour office. To get the one day permit is really easy, just go to the park entrance the day before and fill in all the forms. The next morning you go there again, pay your guide and start your trek. My guide was pretty useless as he didnt talk and didnt care about me at all, but aksed for more money during the trek. The trek itself was the hardest thing ever, I cried in the end coming down. My legs were too tired. And I couldnt really enjoy it as I had to rush up and down. But a two day trek is well worth it I guess."
158,"Yes, you can do it too!","It was my friend's 3rd time to climb this mountain. The previous 2 visits he went up via Timpohon Trail and this time he decided we should try out the other route together - the Mesilau Trail. The first night was spent at the outskirt of the mountain which was the Mesilau Nature Resort. Personally I like the resort very much. It is managed by Sutera Harbour and I think the place is well-kept and clean. I was putting up the night at the Crocker Range House which housed the 6 of us. We had dinner that night and breakfast the next morning before I set off for my maiden mountain climbing trip.Mesilau route is about 8km away from Laban Rata, a resthouse where we will spent the night at before our early morning hike up to the summit. By early I mean waking up at 1am for breakfast and setting off at 3am. Timpohon trail on the other hand takes about 6km up to the rest house. It is a very straight forward route, just going up and up. The Mesilau route I took had uphills and downhills. I would say it is worth trying out this route if you prefer something more challenging and better scenery viewing.The journey up to the summit takes about 3-4 km (sorry can't rmb much). There is a hut upstairs for those who aren't able to make the journey to the summit and able to rest there. You can even sleep inside while waiting for your team mates. This second part of the journey requires some arm strength as you'd be using it for rope climbing. It is not for the faint-hearted as a slip of the gripping may result in you falling off the cliff! But most people are able to get pass that don't worry. You'd have to check out at Laban Rata by 10am, have a quick breakfast, and you're expected to get off the resthouse by then. Timpohon route is the only route used for going downhill. And I must say it's really a breeze (compared to Mesilau route). Watch out for your knees, I brought knee guard and a walking stick with me and I must say they're really helpful when going downhill.Make sure you have dehydration salts with you, ample of water, some energy bars, walking stick (I strongly recommend you get one), poncho, cap for the day hike. As for the night hike, just add headlamps, warm clothing will do. Oh yes, don't bother showering at the Laban Rata Resthouse. It's too cold for anything. Bring powders and wet wipes.Have fun guys! I enjoyed mine, I hope you do too."
159,Of Two Minds,Very tiring hike of 11h but once you have reached the peak at 6:30am in the morning you are extremely proud of yourself and are enjoying the best view of all! Would do it again in a heartbeat.
160,Astounding views from the summit,"The one day trek was a great experience. Definitely challenging both physically and mentally but possible and much cheaper to organise yourself than through a tour company. We emailed Sabah Parks directly, about 2.5 weeks out. It took  them 2 weeks to respond to the email but we got confirmation for the one day climb straight away. When we got to the park the day before the climb, we signed the papers and they  told us to be at the office at 6:50am to pay and set off. The cost was roughly 375 ringgit between us including park few, insurance and guide fee (who you pay 128 of the 375 separately after the climb).It took us 5 hours to reach the summit. Getting to Laban Rata took us just under 3 hours and we had a 10 minute break. By that time the clouds had already started forming so we set off to beat the weather. It got harder from that point. The air is thinner and the steps are steeper, so our pace slowed. We got almost to 8km of the 8.7km track and it started to rain. The visibility became much poorer and the temperature was definitely dropping.Our guide was enthusiastic and really wanted us to reach the summit so we pushed on. We reached the summit at 12:30pm (you have to reach the summit by 1pm), took some photos quickly and headed back down. It was raining heavily by this stage and it was a slippery road down. It took us a lot more time to reach Laban Rata going down as it did going up and not without a few falls and some puddles in our shoes.Overall, I would recommend this day trip to anyone that's fit. We only decided to do the one day climb a couple of weeks out and managed to squeeze in 2 long walks to get some km in our legs, about 20km each walk,  2 stair sets and 2 gym sessions, each with 8kgs on our back and maximum incline on the treadmill and stairs as some training. We were pretty fit beforehand and I was 2 months out from a torn meniscus, but the more training you can do before this climb the better.  It was our first climb so in hindsight, I would have done some more training, especially stairs. Also, remember to do as many stairs down as you do up, you have to get back down the mountain too!Our packs on the day had high energy snacks (chocolate, lollies, bananas), a bottle of water (there are water stations at every hut on the way up to fill up. They say the water is untreated as a warning. We drank it and were fine), a camera, a poncho, a spare pair of socks and a spare t-shirt. Hiking shoes are a must, as is a warm, waterproof jacket - you'll need this at the top!). We also recommend walking sticks, especially useful for coming down which is hard on the knees!"
161,Worth the hike!,"This was our challenge after diving Komodo.  An exhaustive first day climb and up at 0200 to hit the peak before sunrise.  My friend and I were the first at the peak, the temperature plummeted as we rose higher, so take some warm clothes and a torch.  We hid in the rocks to hide the cold.  The sunrise was spectacular.  The walk down was far more difficult on the knees as we did it with no night break.  Once tried, once enjoyed, once suffered, once was enough."
162,"If you like climbing mountains, this is a must do!","We did the 11.00 guided walk, this was very short (max. 1 hour). The guide pointed the plants we saw on our way. After, we visited the botanical garden. This was a nice and cool area. The weather changed rapidly and soon there was some heavy rain. We hardly saw the mountain because of the clouds. From Kota Kinabalu, we went to the park by car. This was a 2-hour trip (1 way)."
163,Too expensive - a rip off,"Well worth a day trip out, wouldn't like to climb to the summit if you are not very fit though. Some exception scenery to be photographed."
164,Not as hard as people make out! - here are all the tips!,Did a day tour with Borneo Eco Tours who I would absolutely recommend as the company is brilliant to deal with. Stopped at a market on the way up to Mt Kinabalu which had lots of beautiful fruit and vegetables and a bit of touristy souvenirs. Then continued to Mt Kinabalu park where we went on a guided walk through the jungle where our brilliant guide was able to point out plants animals and insects and give us lots of information on them. Rest of the day tour involved Poring hot springs. Great way to get a quick look around if you are short on time
165,More difficult than you think!,"Unbeatable experience, anyone can do it. Whole variety of people trekking up and down the mountain from young athletes to chilled out walking groups in tracksuits. Bear in mind though it is not easy: it is a solid uphill hike and your legs will ache for a while after you get back down. Well worth the trek, money and cold though! Remember to take warm clothes for the top - it gets cold and windy up there. The food at the summit camp is also very good and wholesome, exactly what you need to replenish. You will not have the best night's sleep but who cares?!Book well in advance i.e. 3-6 months in advance."
166,Wow,"Just returned home from the climb. You must train for this 2 day 1 night climb. Sure, you'll see the mountain guides do this effortlessly in one day so it depends on body type. On our descent we saw a lady being piggy backed down as her legs were too tired. The climb up was enjoyable and you see different vegetation.Some reviewers brought young children for the climb and I'm not sure how they do it as some of the steps at 4km onwards are huge. This is not for those doing it for the first time. My legs are aching after 4 days because of the descent. There are some people who skip through the descent, sure footed as a deer. But not me. I went down 2hrs slower than my friends and during practice I was faster than them when the ground was even. I reached the Timpohon gate at 410pm. I'm comforted that there were others who reached at 7pm. That's 6hrs for 6km for descent and it required no aerobic exertion at all. But because I didn't know how to place my steps. This is when you know why many bloggers  call mountain guide an unsung hero. My porter guided me and held my hand and told me where to step. She's qualified as a guide. Yes. This is 50 years old and carrying 20kg of our bags.  It's important to engage your guides and respect them."
167,A fun and scenic climb. ,"Sadly we did not make it to the top because storm force sleet made it unsafe to go further than Laban Rata hut at 11000ft. A 6km/ 4 mile walk from the gate to the hut seems easy enough until you think that you climb nearly a mile vertically. There is no scrambling,the path is well maintained, but some of the steps have very deep treads which are hard to haul yourself up and take their toll on calf and thighs on the way down. The climb gets steadily harder as you ascend as tiredness and thinning air take their toll. We perhaps ill- advisedly invested in waterproof and breathable coats. But no coats are breathable enough to cope with the sweat produced in the climb. You are almost better accepting the wetness or buying the ponchos for a couple of quid that the porters wear and you can get at the park entrance. They are loose enough for air to circulate and keep the worst of the rain off you and your ruck sack if needed. Be prepared for the cold of a mountain top even if you are only a few hundred miles off the equator. I got to Laban Rata in shorts and t-shirt and sat down with family to drink hot chocolate and did not really pay much attention to my daughters remark about how I was steaming. There is no heating in the dining area and within about 30 minutes had lost enough heat to be on the verge of hypothermia. We escaped the worst of the rain but there were people following who got soaked and had no change of clothes and we saw and helped a number of people who were grossly unprepared for the conditions.  So despite the hassle of carrying it, do bring a change of clothes as there are no drying rooms or fires to sit around unlike in Alpine mountain huts. As a family we are moderately fit and covered the 4 miles in 5 hours - considered at the faster end of average. We found it harder than Inca Trail but mostly because it is so much more concentrated. It is not a walk in the park but plenty of people get to the top so it is by no means out of reach. My wife and I experienced aching thighs and calves for 3 days after - testament of descending a mile high staircase. But show the mountain some respect and make sure you are prepared."
168,"Great view , average dificulty",Very good trip! We enjoyed the trip despite the long drive.We would recommend this a place to other tourist. a must visit place while you are in borneo.
169,6 months on...,"We did this hike in July 2013. It was challenging but very do-able if you are in good shape. It is a steep climb so if you are not used to this would be worthwhile to train ahead of time. We booked through Dive Down Below, a diving company that offers the tour. Prices were reasonable compared to other tour groups and we were the only people in the van going to and from the park. They were super friendly, including calling us on the hike to make sure things were going well! You really don't need a guide to do this hike but nice to have one. Because we booked late there was only space at the Pendant Hut and we signed up for the Mountain Torq activity, easy route. Main advantages: stay in Pendant Hut which is much quieter than Lebun Rata, avoid a good section of the steep downhill. Not a good idea if you are scared of heights. We didn't know what to expect in terms of difficulty from TA reviews. We started the hike around 9am, were at the hut by 130 pm. Second day we started around 3 am for the sunrise. Ended up getting there a half hour early, did the Mountain Torq, ate breakfast and got to the bottom around 230 pm.Mountain sickness: we took prophylactic ibuprofen, no issues. We did see some people get sick though, especially on the way up in the dark.Footware: decent running shoes ok, hiking shoes even better. Poles are worth renting for the way down."
170,Wonderful scenery and fresh cool air ,"even some of the reviewers said about the costly price but I got happy experience totally. Value for money climbing. I’m a smoker, not really fit to get the summit. It is not good for backpacker because will be expensive trip for solo. Good idea if you plan with some friends!"
171,Easy if you are a mountain goat............,Most of the road to Kinabalu mountain are getting betterDisliked: the hot spring was a bit disappointment due to some hot spring bath are spoil and not all are fully function.
172,Hard but worth it... ,you need to train up before visiting this mountain. if not will have difficulty going up and down the mountain as the trail is not easy to climb and there are hardly handles to hold on to....
173,Incredible climb for an incredible view!,We spent a long time travelling to the location and to get there and be told by our driver not much to see as lots of cloud cover and not worth getting out.  Check the day before going to see if visibility is good.  Went on to see the hot springs.  Do not expect an open area to swim as the are more like baths with hot water in them
174,"Tough climb, not great ","14 of us join a 3 days 2 nights tour for hiking mount kk. We started our journey on 5 April 2013 and climb down on 6 April 2013. We used the Mesilau trail as our path to the summit. Sadly, when i walked for 4 km, I felt some uncomfortable in my stomach. Next I kept feeling dizzy and shivering. I can't remember how i walk to the laban ratan crossroad. My mountain guide explained to me that I was having hypothermia. Due to the serve of the shivering and kept fainting, I was requested to stay in Layang-layang hut for emergency rest. Luckly I felt better the second day. I felt great for my team members able to climb to the peak and take good photos. It took me 6 hours to walk from layang-layang to timpohon gate.A million thanks to my boyfriend who accompany all the way. Millions thanks to our mountain guides, Ah Tong, Willy and Adin. They really take good care of us. Advice:- have a medication check before hiking if you have any sickness history-prefer enough warm clothes- need lots of training before hiking this mountain-always respect the nature The total cost per person is RM840."
175,Achievable for relatively fit people and well worth the reward,"We climbed in April 2012 & we found this to be the hardest thing physically we have done.The climb is marked with 500 metre boards all the way up, so you can see how far you have come. It is encouraging to know how much further you need to go.On the way up, it is basically all up with lots of steps made from rocks & tree roots, not many flat bits, however there are rest stations every 1-1.5km so you can sit & rest.Make sure you get your legs used to climbing stairs. This would be the best exercise for this trip, stair climbing!After staying in the lodge overnight. You start at about 2.30 am to climb the last bit. There are 700 metres of stairs (predominately wooden). Then there is a rope that you can use for the last 2 kms up the rocks, but i reality you only ever use it at the very start of rope section & in one or 2 other places, as you can generally manage without it.Fantastic views over Sabah when on top, but if you can get there on sunrise, you can get some magnificent photos.My wife & I found the climb down the hardest, with the last 4 klms extremely hard as our legs were turning to Jelly from all the going down the rock stairs.Great couple day adventure."
176,Great view when you are up there,"Me and my friends took the 2d1n package to hike the Mt Kinabalu. It was a very good hike. Easily done by most of the people. We started from Timpohon Gate and were awarded with beautiful scenery along the way to Laban Rata. Toilets and rest huts were available along the trail. The buffet meal at Laban Rata was very good. Certainly a reward after 6-7 hours of hiking. We stayed at Lemaing Hut. The dorm was very excellent. We managed to summit the peak of Mt Kinabalu. Some of us had AMS, maybe due to fast ascend. The view from the top was amazing. Certainly worth every sweat. We were also provided with certs after successful climb. Overall it is a must for anyone who loves hiking and climbing."
177,Most physical and mental challenge I have ever done,"I found this to be an extremely challenging. It's a two day hike to the top, with a mountain lodge two thirds the way up.The first day starts at 8:30am from Timpohon gate (1,866m). From here you have a 6km trek up the mountain, and I mean up! There are very few flat or downhill sections to rest. You should get to the resthouse by about 4pm, depending on fitness level (3,272m). We stayed in Laban Rata. There is a full kitchen there with hot food starting at 4pm. A small shop also sells drinks, snacks, water etc.Day two starts at 02:00am with a hot breakfast in the lodge. At 02:30 you set off for the final 3km. You have until 5:30am to get to the last checkpoint. After this, they may not let you continue due to time constraints. Once/if you reach the top (4,095m) spend about 15-20mins to enjoy the sunrise view, take some photos, and then head back down to the lodge where another hot meal is waiting for you. After you've filled your belly, you have to climb down the thousands of steps all the way back to Timpohon gate. You'll cover 12km in the day."
178,We managed to summit but boy the walk out afterwards...,"Booked our spot on the website however the website was not that clear about the add on activities outside of the summit climb. Please note this is a pricey climb and over night stay. We had originally chose the Via Ferrata - walk the Torque 2 Day and 1 night stay, but when this was explained to us on the day of arrival at base camp, we switched to Via Ferrata Low Circuit Peak which was more challenging. This added on a couple of extra hours to the experience and an extra $$$. Accomodation was dorm style in a room of 16 people. cafeteria style buffet malaysian food which was really good. You hike to base camp which is 6.5km - it is a steep incline, taking about 4-5hours to climb so make sure you get some altitude pills if you are sensitive. After an early 5/6pm dinner you sleep until 2am then from 230am- 530am you climb in the dark to the summit. Wear layers its chilly, and head lamp a must, decent comfortable hiking boots, beanie and gloves. Its windy and cold on the top. The sunrise if you are lucky to get a clear day is gorgeous. But the descent from the summit is breathtaking, the barren rock formations on a clear day above the clouds is magical. Via Ferrata route is rockclimbing cliff edge - glad we did it, but definitely a novelty and for a good photo opportunity. Spent 3-4 hours extra harnessed in and on cables. the guides were fantastic and safe- Adrian lead us through the via ferrata climb. And Joseph was our guide for the rest of the trek up and down the mountain as well as our porter for all our extra gear we didn't want to carry on our backs. Fantastic service and so friendly. after Via Ferrata we went back to basecamp packed our things and then came back down the mountain. 4-5hours later we were exhausted and sore. It was a great experience. If I was to do it again. I would have done the summit and stayed longer to see the full sunrise then possibly Walk the torque. Overall great experience, great people, good food. and ok accommodation considering where it was situated. Amazing Borneo took good care of us. and didn't feel too crowded. The hike up is a combination of rocks, tree roots and man made steps. We were blessed with a fabulous blue sky 2 days. Memorable climb"
179,Best hiking experience ,"Climbing the mountain was very hard, but a great achievement! Unfortunately it rained when we got to the top so we couldn't watch the sunrise."
180,A (Very!) Challenging Climb!,"Amazing experience to be at the top at sunrise with a clear sky. I loved it and recommend it. HOWEVER: The price you pay is exhaustion and probably freezing your fingers off. The first day is heavy, but the morning hike to the top was almost brutal to me. Keep yourself hydrated, fed and manage your layers all the time. I now understand why people ""conquer"" mountains, it does not want you there and it will do a lot to scare you away. The hike is 8.5 km in total, but takes insane amounts of time. You start of around 1800m, in 6km you hike up to 3300m and the last 2.5km you go to 4095m. The altitude increase alone is impressive enough, the short distance will make it more impressive to have done it."
181,A spectacular sight of Mt.Kinabalu @ Sunrise,"Booked through Borneo Calling - very responsive rep Mr Jackz Lee. Assigned mountain guides were professional n experience....encourage my fellow team mates along the way 👍We trained for almost half a year...still is a tough climb, but we gain a lot from it 💪🏽"
182,Better bring trekking poles,"Ok, I'm 51, and made it, reached the summit around 5.10 am. It pays to be a little fit ;)Was a little worried before the climb as I only had a couple of months of hill training (only one hill which is only 800m asl). Experience it once...at least ;) Food is fine at Laban Rata. Staffs were friendly. Will be back ;)"
183,Worst hike I've ever done,"Wonderful experience, with sunrise view on the top of the mountain! Highly recommended (but maybe less so for low-budgetters, as you have to pay entrance fees, guide, climbing permit etc.)Trekking shoes and warm clothing recommended."
184,Via Ferrata ,"We hiked up mount kinabalu on 5th June. We had no plan for climbing it due to pricey cost and unclear procedure, but since Borneo Trails offered all-inclusive package to us at affordable price we decided to take the chance! I must rave them for making way for our last minutes booking with reasonable price! What we paid to them was well rewarded with the breath-taking sun-rise from the top of mount kinabalu! I highly recommend you to take your chance to climb mount kinabalu if you can afford to! For budget traveler, I may suggest you to contact Borneo Trails. They may help you out with the arrangement and cost-saving!"
185,One of the hardest challenges of my life,"it's no doubt about toughness to reach the low peak summit of mount kinabalu , with limitation of only no more than 260 hikers per day allowed into the kinabalu park. However, the scenic view on the peak is very breath-taking. Making you proud about getting it from your endeavour. there are many varieities of scenes , flora and fauna during the way to the pinnacles , so it's unquestionable about how much it worths your efforts."
186,Challenge yourself,"It was a longish drive from our hotel, aprox 2 hours very picturesque scenery, being a Saturday there was a lot of traffic on the road. We were very fortunate to have a very knowledgeable travel guide Assia and a very friendly and funny driver Gerard to entertain us along the way.We stopped along the way and had a rare treat of seeing a rare Rafflesia flowering plant in full bloom, it was nearly a meter in diameter, they only flower for a few days and are very rare , my wife was stoked.The mountain is cloaked in clouds so to get a view of the peak is indeed lucky.We stopped at the thermal springs where I soaked my feet while the rest of the party went for the rain forest walk.By late afternoon the area was surrounded by fog so we had a slow drive back."
187,"Wanna hike triple peak in Sabah? Mount Kinabalu, Mount Trusmadi and Mount Tambuyukon",Excellent day at park and water springs. Interesting information centre and walk round the World Heritage Park. Springs were not quite as we had imagined- just put our feet in rather than swimming. Also went on Canopy walk- also good although view a little disapponting.
188,Refresh for my soul,"I read a lot of articles and blogs around this climb/trek before attempting to climb Mt Kinabalu with my wife, one thing that stuck in my mind was the Wikipedia site and the line ‘Low's Peak can be climbed quite easily by a person in good physical condition’ take this with a pinch of salt as I would not use the word ‘easy’ when talking about the overall ascent and descent. Usual stuff: we are both in our 30’s and reasonably fit, we don’t smoke but we like a beer, we are not avid fans of fitness but we did make an effort to visit the gym for a few months before and we did a lot of walking around Singapore, a few weekends of 12-15k hikes around MacRitchie etc. We made sure we researched the equipment we would need to make things easier on the hike itself and found that the Camelbacs (2Ltr) and the walking poles were essential, also waterproof boots (North face gore-tex boots), I took a 30L bag and my wife a 22 so plenty of room for layers and energy bars.We started off on the first day and were soon peeling the layers off, shorts and tee shirt are all that’s required at the lower altitudes, we had fleece and waterproofs also but with the spots of rain we just used the cheap $1.50 ponchos to see us through day one, the first day is not really that challenging but its still a 5 or so hour hike up a rock track, water was streaming down at times so the boots were really coming into their own, overall a pleasant day.The next day is standard, up at 2am and a spot of breakfast if you can eat at that time, I cannot so I just had a energy bar when we got moving. The first part is a wooden staircase leading you up a steeper part of the mountain, it soon becomes more like the terrain you would have encountered on the first day, rocky and winding with tree roots, gradually as you get higher it becomes more desolate until you are just on bare rock face, there’s a rope to guide you but as long as you are careful with your footing you will be fine. I read some posts that this part has a sheer cliff face in one side, that’s a bit dramatic, if you lost your footing you would certainly not fall off a cliff so don’t believe everything you read. After walking and walking and walking you can start to see over the top of the flattened mountain surface, you then see the summit……….WTF its still miles away ;-) but you are soon up there and taking photos and chilling out (or waiting for your wife). You are now sat firmly above the clouds with the sun rising, what a place to be!Now comes the hard part, both mentally and physically. You walk a few hours to get back to the place you started from at 2:30 am the same morning and again try and eat if you body allows you to, after that you need to be checked out by 10:30am, awaiting you is the pleasure of walking the 5-6k back to the starting point, its hard on your knees and you have to concentrate on your footing, I actually remember every step and my body reminded me of each step 3-4 days after.Sense of achievement, of course it’s great when you are up there and its great to reflect on, I would definitely say the climb is worth it and it makes you realise how insignificant we are against mother nature.Don’t forget your head torch and if you can beat drinking 5 Heinekens at Laban Rata the night before the climb then good on you ;-)"
189,Anyone who says it's easy it's not. But do it anyway !,"The hike up took 3 hours of steps , but others not used to hiking took 5 . Basic dorm with bunk beds in our hut night before 230 am. departure to top for sunrise.Can follow rope the whole way as guide was useless , his headlight being seen intermittently far ahead. He was trying to race up out of pique for  two of us not following him for 5 hours up. At least it was quiet and beautiful in the moonlight with the pack of 120 hikers 30-40 minutes behind. Reached top in 2 hours and glad of warm jacket during hour wait for sunrise. Amazing light and view , well worth the trip. On way down used the short  ( 1 hour) Via Ferrata - which was disappointing , having done one before in Canada. This one was obviously not installed by climbers , and the whole time was spent holding onto the cables , rather than the rock. Hike down the mountain from huts was torture on the thighs , and only took 15 mins. less than ascent. Luckily had 2 days to recover at Poring Hot Springs , as getting up was difficult for the following 3 days.  Would be a fantastic hike were if not for the descent."
190,Pushed to all kinds of limits,It started with positive thoughts and it ended with suicidal thoughts. It was wet in the way up and very hard going. It's easily physically and mentally the hardest thing I've done. The lodge was basic and cold. With no water due to a water drought and no towel to dry myself it was freezing at the lodge. Good food was available and the overpriced drinks were worth the price when you see how they get all the stuff up there. I call it altitude tax. But if you see the lads and ladies carrying the stuff up then you appreciate paying what you do!! The climb to the summit is dark. A good torch helps. Mine was poo so didn't help. Our guide we renamed to 'happy' as he was the most miserable turd I've ever met. Didn't talk didn't smile just walked 50m behind us. When you get to the top there are loads of tools with selfish sticks tacking pictures of themselves and there mates. Worst invention ever. When the sun does rise and you have to decent you realise that the climb up was actually very dangerous. The climb down is just as If not harder than the climb up. Overall a great experience. Would I do it again. No f*****g way. Be prepared to walk like john Wayne for a few days and dread the sight of a set of steps for at least a week.
191,Beautiful scenery hike ,"We took 2 days to climb 4,090 m Mt Kinabalu in Sabah/Borneo with our very fit 9 and 11 year old children. It took about 4 hours of steady uphill and stair climbing on the first afternoon for the 6 km from Park HQ to Laban Rata hut, accompanied by our lovely local guide. We hadn't been keen to pay the Guide Fee but it turned out to be well worth the expense for the local knowledge, enthusiasm, gentle encouragement and raincoats offered at 3 am the next morning.The night at Laban Rata was chilly but the food was ok and we found other guests to chat to. Went to bed very early in order to rise again at 2:30 am. We all had mild headaches caused by altitude sickness but nothing a little paracetamol couldn't cure. The 2 km climb to the summit only took us 2 hours due to our speedy kids so we arrived in darkness but were able to enjoy the view as dawn arrived and we trudged back down past everyone else still climbing up. There was a rope to guide us to the summit where there was only enough room for a handful of people to rest so we only stayed a couple of minutes.It was freezing cold and we didn't have anywhere near enough warm clothes. Our feet were wet as we climbed in socks and sandals or running shoes. If you have waterproof and warm gear then make sure you take it!The view was magical and well worth the climb and I'd do it again, though not sure the kids would agree. I tried to book without going through Sutera Sanctuary Lodges but it seemed impossible. The accommodation and food were all ok though 2 of us had bad food poisoning after the post-climb buffet lunch and my daughter had diarrhoea on the way up, maybe from the buffet breakfast before we climbed? Who knows. Lucky there was a toilet stop about every kilometre. We took water, chocolate and biscuits for the climb but didn't really need the extra food as Sutera Sanctuary Lodges fed us well.Climbing back down the 8 km took about 4 hours, which was pretty quick, but we jogged some of the way. The kids were in the middle of our cross country running season so they were fitter than most of the adults we saw climbing. Our legs were a bit jelly like and sore the next day, but that didn't stop the kids sprinting up the steps to the finish of the walk. We still talk about the climb regularly and what an amazing experience it was. All other climbs we have done since pale by comparison and it's set a bench mark any other climbs that ""are not as challenging as Mt Kinabalu""."
192,A beautiful and rewarding experience,"This is a reasonably tough bit of mountain hiking.  The ascent profile isn’t friendly, on the first day you go from ~1800m to just over 3000m, well into the range where you will experience the altitude.  The next day is a 2am start to summit by 5:30am at (4095m), and in most itineraries a complete descent back to the bottom at 1800m the same day.The top section is bare rock slab or boulders.  You’re in the dark (and thick cloud when I did it), following the white rope on the ground.  I summited in a cloud. No views.  There is a section steep enough such that you need to pull up the rope whilst maintaining your footing.  I did hear a girl slipped at this part in previous years, and slid over the edge and died, though this may be rumour only, but it came from one of the guides.This shouldn’t be your first experience at altitude, and for those it was, they suffered miserable mountain sickness in a few cases I saw.  Also, given the terrain at the top, you should have some time in the mountains under your belt.Proper walking boots are a must, I’m on the fence on approach shoes.  Trainers/ sneakers are asking for trouble.  You also need sufficient clothes to keep you warm at this altitude, proper waterproof gloves, a decent headtorch and waterproof jacket.This is not a cheap trip.  A pass to the park and guide are compulsory.  I did my trip through a tour which adds cost for sure, self-organising all components is possible but probably tricky.All in all I enjoyed my trip up the mountain, but having done a lot of this type of thing before I could see it for what it is.  Others who were not as well prepared (gear, experience and fitness wise) didn’t enjoy it as much.Altitude poses a real risk and the only solution to the symptoms (mountain sickness, and the more serious High Altitude Pulmonary Edema [HAPE] and High Altitude Cerebral Edema [HACE]) is to descend.  The financial and personal incentive to not do this can be compelling, but remember it is not only your health you risk, but that of the people who inevitably take on the task of your rescue.  Helicopter landing areas are spaced along the track in a few places before the huts.  Make sure your insurance covers this eventuality.The food at the Laban Rata huts is good, and there is opportunity here to restock on your water.  Everything brought up here to sustain this tourist attraction is carried up on the heads of low paid porters, show then due curtosy.  It is often the case that guides food is not part of their employment, they pay for it themselves at the huts.  Buy them dinner.It is a shame if what I heard is true.  Since the access/ ownership to the park was sold to a (? Chinese ?South Korean, I heard both) , prices have gone up and it has become much more restricted for Malay’s to climb the mountain, as the aim is to take the tourist money and get them up.Enjoy your time on this amazing mountain, but do it sensibly."
193,"Amazing experience, stunning views - well worth the climb","My friend invited me to climb the mountain last April, this was not my first time to climb however this was the first time for them, and I love this place so much because of the weather. I recommended them to take the Mesilau trail since there wanted to have the challenging trail ever. It takes us four and half hours to reach Laban rata which the place to get some rest before continuing the journey to lows peak the next morning. About 5.30 am we were ready to continue the journey, remember to bring only equipment you need to peak leave the rest at the hostel. About noon time we have ended our climb and leave to Poring hot spring to rest our leg. Overall it was satisfied climbing trip and will be back if any chance to get there."
194,Great Hike,Book my trip in June and did the climb in Aug. The route to the guest house was quite simple to trek. Simple does not mean it is easy. There are really lots of steps throughout the journey. It was a challenge to your legs. The key is to have some training prior to this hiking trip. The trip up was great with nice scenery. As you got higher and higher...the temperature also dropped. I still remember i couldnt sleep at night in the guest house as it was really cold. The thermometer shows 7 degree C. Phase 2 of the hiking require us to walk in the night up to the summit. Please ensure you have a good head touch...proper shoes...a gortex jacket if possbile (might be wet weather on the summit). It begun with some simple steps..but after that Every steps we took was cold and challenging. It seems like an never ending slope...and we just have to walk and walk. The sky was actually filled with stars...but too tried to enjoy. :p But eventually when we reached the summit. IT IS ALL WORTH IT!! Standing at the Low Peak was a great achievement. And the sunrise was the best reward for taking up the challenge. The view was amazing...as he are above the clouds. Going down is PAINFUL..esp your knee. Ensure you have a good walking stick and if possible some knee guard/protector. Overall...it is a trip you must attempt at least once in your life. :)
195,Beautiful scenery,"What an amazing experience, although the 2 days is not for the feint hearted or the unfit. The trek takes around 5 - 6 hours to get to base camp depending on fitness levels. You then have a meal and sleep until 1:30am, then climb often using ropes laid on the floor to provide extra traction to the summit to watch the sun rise. It is cold outside but very beautiful. You then walk a 0.5 - 1 hours down to the start of the Via Ferrata. We took the longer route 4 - 5 hours, it was amazing, views above the clouds, then the second half cleared to blue skies. You have a very light lunch at base camp, then walk 4 - 5 hours back down. An amazing experience, well worth it, but it is 4095m high, so some will suffer from altitude sickness, especially as you do not have time to acclimatise fully."
196,Mount Kinabalu,we climb up to the canopy walk. awesome view at the canopy walk. the hot spring was good but I expect it to be better
197,How to do Mount Kinabalu for the cheapest price.,"The view was excellent.,Took lots of pictures of the mountain & the weather was great & cool."
198,A Great View,"It is not easy--I have done plenty of hikes above 14,000 feet but this one was the hardest.  I have never seen so many steps in my life.  Accommodations are basic--toilet and bath are down the hall and sometimes a long line.  Food was some of the best I had seen in 2 weeks of travel.  It is noisy in the main Leban Rata Resthouse where everyone eats"
199,ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!,"We did the 2 day 1 night Mount Kinabalu climb as a bit of a last minute decision the week before we flew out to Borneo. The climb is hard work, especially in the heat and humidity but it's definitely do-able. We both go to the gym but I wouldn't say we're super fit. We made it to Laban Rata in just under 5 hours on the first day, to the summit in just under 3 hours and then back in just over 2 hours, before climbing back down in about 4 hours. Laban Rata is a great rest stop. It's really basic but clean and everyone's doing the same thing so it's really friendly and a good laugh in the evening. The food is really good and after walking up a mountain the cold shower is actually quite refreshing! You'll see people carrying your food and drinks up the mountain to Laban Rata whilst you're walking up so you really won't mind paying for a can of coke when you get there!I've never climbed anything in my life but we made it. Most of the climb is a steep walk up a path made of large steps, boulders etc. Make sure you take a head torch and some warm clothes for the summit. It's really cold at the top and quite exposed so you need a hat and warm clothes. There are a few bits that are a bit hairy where you have to use a rope along rock face to climb up, but your guide will help you. The climb back down will hurt your knees so be prepared and don't plan to do too much the day after your climb. You'll be able to spot people who've just finished the climb in your hotel for the rest of your holiday when they gingerly walk into the bar! Overall a great challenge and good fun."
200,How to cut the costs in half,"One of the Mountain that inspire us to climb, trek and hike. This climb is a must for mountaineer surely you will never forget. only thing don't climb during rainy season coz they will not allowed climber to climb the summit and if you get only one night to stay in laban rata sorry better luck next climb no refund. need to train before climbing. Total cost/fee 210 usd not a luxury package."
201,I love Mount Kinabalu,"well what can I say, hard work but worth it. start training now, find the nearest/largest tower block and climb for a few hours up and down, it is mostly stairs and will take it out of you. but well worth it. wondeful"
202,2 days trekking around the park ,This is my first time to climb the mount Kinabalu and me and friend stay at Lemaing Hostel. The Lemaing Hostel got no working heater even it is there! So we have to boiled water. But I just used the cold water instead as there is a lot of ppl wanted to take bath! The journey from Timpohon to Laban Rata was really good and I have no problem with it. But from Laban Rata to the peak you we have to be more extra careful with the steps. At last I reached at the peak at 7.00 am. The food at Laban Rata is so good but you have to be early because not enough table to eat. I have to shared table. with another group. I really recommend anyone who loves nature and adventurous journey to try climb Mount Kinabalu.
203,great mountain experience,"It was a great experience to go up to the peak even if had bad weather. If you pay the fee for Mt Kinabalu track you get the guidance lots of food, and shelter. The service is not the best, but nature is unforgettable. The track up and down is not too hard, even if its raining I recomended to every age to go for it."
204,Avoid day trip from KK,"Alright the one day climb is hard, but definitely not impossible, in fact the level of achievement you get is worth the leg battering by itself and the views (weather permitting) is just the icing on the summit :)30 years old and 20 a day smoker, i hardly train and not very fit either but what i do have is a lot of heart and will power. This by itself should get you to the peak in time, i went with my older brother and friend who train everyday running and gym. Before we set out i was complaining that we should have gotten the two day climb as it gives you time to acclimatise, take it easy and more importantly see the sunrise.Unfortunately all the rooms were booked, so off we went on the one day climb, i really thought i would let the team down, imagine my surprise when i was the only one to make the peak at the allocated time of 1pm!!!Its a hard climb and your legs will feel like jelly by the time you get down, the knees take a battering so i would suggest wearing knee protectors which i didn't but in hindsight will next time.Mentally you have to be strong, 4 times i felt like giving up but willed myself to carry on, a bit of advice is to go strong on the first 6kms up to laban rata (base camp) only take 5 mins rest in the 1kms shelter stops as when you get to laban rata you can give yourself a 15min rest before going up the thinning air summit.For me this was the hardest part, as the lack of oxygen made climbing so much harder, i was able to get to raban lata in two hours leaving at 8 and reaching at 10 am.The last two kms actually took me 3 hours to get to the peak, you really need to push yourself if you are not used to physical activity.. The human body is very hardy and the only thing that weakens it is the mind so make sure you are mentally strong and give yourself little goals.For example every time i wanted to quit, i would aim for a boulder or a rock a few metres ahead of me and make it my goal. This way you get to climb higher all the time without feeling overpowered by the summit.slowly but surely you will get to Low's peak, in little achievable measures and once you do WOW what a sense of accomplishment and spectacular views.Gear1. Breathable trousers i.e north face columbia climbing gear2. long sleeve t-shirt3. Light but sturdy northface jacket 4. very important thick socks and climbing shoes5. waterproof or water resistant shoulder satchel to store away jacket when too hot and to carry 1.5 litre bottle of water. Although i drank loads and even had to resort to drinking mountain water as i ran out of water.6.Light gloves to hold rope with (i didn't have but yet again in hindsight it helps)7. Sugary sweets and dried fruit like mango will help boost your energy and also loads of chocolate, forget taking meals as this will only add more weight and make you lethargic when digesting them.8. LOADS and LOADS of heart and willpower DON'T GIVE UP unless you are suffering from altitude sickness or really bad cramps. I got them but managed to rub them away with my hand seriously its all in the mind.9. JUST DO IT as Nike says :)Remember what goes up must come down, so have some reserve in you to be able to come down the mountain. This is where your knees will take a pounding so take your time and be sure footed, a tumble down the hill can be life threatening especially if it starts raining and gets windy like it did to me. You will see streams of water just rushing past you and can be daunting, this is where good shoes come into play, GRIP, GRIP, GRIP.If you go in a group the guides will stay with the slowest of the group, this meant i found myself going up to the summit alone and without a guide. Do not fear as the route is well marked and the sense of accomplishment of doing it on your own is a reward you will always have and cherish.One day climbs mean you might not see anyone else whilst going up the summit, don't let that deter you as eventually one of your guides will meet you halfway down the mountain when you descend.Once up, admire the views, take photos and have a good 15 mins rest before descending, in my case i had a good shout and self promoting before descending to give me the courage to descend as it is a little scary alone :)Anyways all in all i did the climb and descend in 7 hours which i have been told isn't too bad for a beginner. I wish all of you the best of luck if you are doing the one day climb, you won't have much time to admire your surroundings but you will appreciate how strong you can be if you set your mind to it.Laising LiuGibraltar I LOVE KK"
205,To touristy comercial and to expensive to go up the mountain.,"Due to booked out main lodge, stayed in the lodge run by the via Ferrata organisation just up the hill. Cost more because the excursion is included but itself a great experience. Well organised guide system, many easy stops on the way up. The huts are basic for a very brief sleep & a bit cold. Make sure to take plenty layers + head torch. You see plenty of lightly equipped poorly prepared walkers - you CAN make it with little experience, but it is a slogThe descent is the real killer on the legs, and you need to allow 2 full days for the whole excursion. Views at sunrise are spectacular"
206,Would climb again!! ,"Did the climb with my 14 year old son and made it to the summit at 645 am on December 29. It's a really tough 2 day climb. The second day is quite brutal; 3-4 hours upto the summit and then walk 9 down. A total of about 10-12 hours walking. The steep descent on a very rocky track is really hard and my legs are hurting 3 days later ! I am pretty fit , have climbed Kilimanjaro and have a fair amount of experience of walking in the hills. Still thought this was hard and not really spectacular."
207,"It is hard, but worth it!","may be it really costly to climb this mountain, but when u really get to the low peak, it actually worth for it. Sometimes i still thinking to climb again."
208,Torture. But it's worth it. ,Amazing trip with amazing organiser to achieve my mission.Thank you Mr Sabastan (mountain guide) and Mr Yasi (personal guide) for their patient and encouragement.
209,"On a clear day, its magnificent!","Fantastic trip and definitely worth the effort.  Amazing Borneo Tours were excellent and can't speak highly enough of our guide Joseph Kolis.  He was professional, friendly, knowledgeable, compassionate and a great companion during our 2 days on the mountain.  The climb was definitely tougher than expected, especially the trip down.  Excellent food and accommodation at Laban Rata.  Prophylactic altitude sickness medication definitely recommended.  Considered preparation (including gear) important, particularly for the summit climb.  Thanks again Joseph - you were an absolute star."
210,amazing montane forest,"A whole day trip for us coming from Nexus resort. Obviously extremely high and while it was hot and sunny, by the time we neared the top (lookout areas) it was quite cool and the air had become very thin!"
211,Day tour from KK,I did the 2D1N Kinabalu climb and was floored by how great the experience was. Everything was very professional and executed really well. The food in the park is amazing. Especially at the resthouse considering it's all carried up 3000m by people. I was surprised at the freshness and selection; better than my hotel's buffet. I met some great people and a had a fun/challenging climb.
212,Exhausting but what an achievement ,"It was not easy but it was full of fun and adventure. A Must TRY! If you are adventure seeker and enjoy the nature, this is a place to start with."
213,Challenging but worth it! ,"Climbing Mt Kinabalu was the highlight of my recent Asian trip. It's very accessible and achievable, and I also felt very safe climbing it. It's a really well organised mountain hike (even better the ones in Victoria, Australia!). Mountain guides are not optional, and greatly appreciated. You can also hire porters (which can sometimes be your mountain guide) and walking poles, which I would recommend for those who are even a bit apprehensive about the hike. The stairs are steep but actually easier than I expected. For those who exercise regularly and are generally fit, this should be challenging but not TOO bad (I exercise about 3-4 times a week, for 1-2 hours mainly doing cardiovascular activity and pilates). For those who don't exercise, please start training! There were a few people who were only halfway up the mountain at 4pm, and were really struggling!If you appreciate your mountain guide, I suggest tipping them. Our mountain guide (who I unfortunately can't remember the name of!) was just... exceptional! I can only give him the highest, highest praise. Kind, patient, ever helpful, and without doubt my most favourite person in Sabah!Warning: Beware of altitude sickness, which can be pretty bad. My friend vomited 4 times and was so weak by the end of it, she had to be carried down the mountain in the last kilometre. We took Stemetil, which I didn't find particularly helpful myself. Would be beneficial to ask a travel doctor about your options.Also, my recommendation is to bring sports tape and tape your knees before climbing back down the mountain. I found this extremely helpful, and think I would have really struggled if I didn't do this.Food at Laban Rata is excellent. BRING ENERGY SNACKS to eat along the way - you'll need it!Water: We brought along 2 litres each which was more than enough to take us to Laban Rata. Once we were there, it's easy enough to refill the bottle with clean water."
214,How to climb mountain Kinabalu on your own,"Start at Timpohon gate check point and group of 6. most of us without training. Just went jogging for 2-3times and we really go climb highest mountain in our country. We took 7hours+ almost 8hrs to reach laban rata guesthouse. This tell us, never give up !! It just matter of times ! This is the MUST see place in Malaysia especially for those Malaysians. Food is good, maybe we all hungry :) I advised you take 4days3nights package. A day stay in kinabalu park, a day up overnight in laban rata, 2nd day stay one more night after came down from peak ! So you got plenty of time to rest and enjoy the nice view on top. Lots of people give up halfway .. When on the way to summit. Maybe they worry later they still got long way to get down from top. Take another 5-6hours ?! So... Better rest at guesthouse will do ... Cause nice view also can enjoy here. I personally think of that too ! Finally... near yet so far ! Never reach peak ! So.. Dont challenge to others.. Challenge to yourself ! Take your time to get there(summit).4d3n is the best.You will get a color cert if you compleated your climb to low's peak(summit), but if u are not.. U get only non color cert. porter fee about MYR 80-125/10kg depants on which route you follow. Please dont bring too many things ! Bring only necessary cloths n items.  My perfect trip .. which can climb, get to know the teamwork of my group and trust. What a wouderful trip. Ps. Get a pair of kampung adidas shoe @ MYR 8 in KK Market"
215,Amazing climb,"Although the climb was tiring, we enjoyed every moment of the trekking holiday. Indeed climbing Mt KK is a wonderful experience"
216,Amazing charity climb,"We loved the entered experience from start to finish. We book this with Amazing Borneo Tours and were very happy with their service. We got picked up from our hotel in KK and dropped at the  Mountain where we received our lunch packs, ID tags and were introduced to our guide (we got our own guide). Our guide was absolutely fantastic. You can lock your bag at the Park Entry. The bottom part is quite well prepared lots of steps (a bit over prepared for my liking but makes it easier for some). Toilets on the way up are a bit disgusting, but I guess thats part of the experience. You‘ll see lots of squirrels when having short breaks :)Note the lunch pack wasn‘t great so if you are picky in terms of food maybe bring your own lunch. Also, bring lots of müsli or chocolate bars for energy… you will need it! The dinner at the Laban Rata Restaurant was surprisingly good! It was a buffet with a great selection of food. We went to sleep almost immediately after as we had to get at and walk again around 2am.Now, you definitely need a head torch for this climb as its pitch dark and there are many dangerous areas on the way to the peak. My husband had a bit of altitude sickness so I definitely recommend bringing some pills for that. Also, dress really warm the second day when you head for the peak…. it is absolutely freezing up there and as soon as you stop moving you will FREEZE! The wind up there is ice cold and we could‘t staying longer than a few minutes right at the top. It quite crowded at the peak and it was still dark when we reached the summit.We decided to walk just a little down and out of the cloud to see the spectacular sunset! WOW! Unbelievably beautiful! The alpine terrain and view is stunning (see pics).I definitely recommend wearing some proper mountain shoes with a good grip as it quite wet in parts and you don‘t want to slip.It‘s incredible seeing the skinning porters carrying insane amounts of stuff up and down. Some with broken flip flops. Then others carrying people down… it‘s crazy and just goes to show it‘s all in the power of the mind. Mount Kinabalu combined with the Lows Peak Circuit was probably the toughest physical challenges yet, but so amazing. We signed up for the Low’s Peak Circuit via ferrata experience. I am so happy we did it but it‘s harder than you think. There are many parts that are quite intimidating. I am quite scared of heights and am actually not sure how I managed to make it all the way. I think its the adrenaline and the fact that I really wanted to do it and if I showed any sign of fear my husband would have opted out. The scariest parts definitely at the beginning and then the first 2 free hanging 'bridges' that move while you walk and its quite tricky to get into it. I signed us up for this not realising that this is 7.5km and takes about 4 hours (3.5 hours it took us). Our via ferratta guide Jai was very good and keeping us focussed.One thing to keep in mind is that you start the via ferratta at 6:30am after you have been walking for about 4 hours already. A lot of people pulled out the day before at the training. I highly recommend you to challenge yourself and do it as it‘s an experience of a lifetime, but if your minds not in it don‘t signed up because you won‘t get your money back if you change your mind. Also please note, a lot of the steps, handles, hooks and whatever you call them are quite far apart. I think we only managed well as we are both very tall (181cm and 196cm) and could therefore reach each handle and next step.By the time we got back to the Pendent Hut after the circuit we were exhausted and didn't know how we would make it all the way down, but we did. The next 4 days we stayed at a Resort to relax which is definitely a must. We struggled to climb up and walk down stairs for about 4 days. Every muscle in your body will hurt if you do the via ferratta as well. It is so worth it!!!!"
217,Bagus Sekali!! ,weather too cold and no water heater at laban rata. cannot take bath. but i achieve the mount low's peak.
218,Beautiful mountain and great for children ,"So my friends and I decided that we will check out KK and also climb the mountain. My friend found the only available travel company online called Borneo Global Backpackers Lodge & BGB Country Tours & Travel. We paid for this hike just shy of 3 weeks before the actual date and it was   late. So please book your tour atleast a month in advance to get competitive pricing.So the morning of the hike, we were picked up from our hotel which is in the city centre at 5.30 am. We then set out and the drive was about two hours to the foot of the mountain where we had breakfast and about 9 we set to the entrance of the park where we met our guide. So we started hiking about 9.30 am. At the entrance of the mountain we can rent hiking a pair of hiking poles which is utter saviour and Im glad I rented them for 20 RM for a pair. You can also buy plastic disposable raincoats for 5 RM   You can carry your own backpack which we did or you can get a porter to carry it for you for 10 RM per kilo all the way to the top and while descending its only 5 RM per kilo. Please carry enough water just for the day as you can fill up your empty bottles once you reach Laban Rata. The water is boiled and cooled and its safe. If not you can buy a 1.5 lt bottle for 15 RM. Also carry protein bars and nuts as the packaged food its so so. Day 1 hike is 6km in total is doable as there is a longer time frame for one to get to Laban Rata. Even if one takes 8 hours its fine as you will make it for dinner.  80% of the first leg of the journey is in the shade and the its quite pleasant to hike. There is no humidity. The first 4 kms were easy and anyone can hike up and its not tough. The last 2 kms to Laban Rata is rough as its rugged and its not paved. You will also begin to feel the altitude from this level, so this stage requires a bit of physical strength. We reached the Laban Rata at about 3.30 pm. We lazed around and finally at 5.30 pm, lunch or early dinner was served. It was buffet and the spread was pretty decent. After which I managed to take a freezing shower as there is hot water. Ensure to stay in the main building above the restaurant as there is internal heating inside which will be good. The rest od the guest houses dont have internal heating. We had a dorm room with 6 beds and it tends to get stuffy one the door is closed.We were tired and we tried to fall asleep by 8.30 pm as we had to wake up at 1.30 am for the second leg. For this journey one has to be in good physical shape and shoes with very good threads as this involves steep climbs and  one has pull oneself up using ropes. You would needs a good windbreaker jacket with a hood or a beanie and a pair of thick gloves. We started our hike at 2.45 pm with headlamps and to be honest I was glad I was hiking in darkness as you cannot see anything around you which makes it less scary. This 2.7 km hike took us 3 hrs and we made it in time for the sunrise. A lot of them didn't make it to the top in time for the sunrise.But once you make it to the top its worth your effort. The descent is pretty easy except in some paths and thats when you realise how steep and egdy certains parts. We reached Laban Rata at about 9.00 am. My advice is eat breakfast and leave right away that way your legs dont feel the pain. We rested for 2 hours and left only at 11 am which made the descent of 6 km much more longer and painful. We made it down in 4 and half hours but it was hard on our knees.We got our certificates at the exit of the mountain and we got dropped at our hotel back."
219,Organising the trek from KK,"We were a group of three and did the standard 2 day 1 night trip. The total climbing distance is 8.5 km from Timpohon gate to the summit. Day 1 - you start at around 10-11am and it takes about 4-5 hours to cover 6kms and reach the guesthouses for the night stay. The food would surprise you if you have set expectations right from food at the top of a mountain. Eat early and sleep early.Day 2 - starts at 2 am. Have a quick bite and head to make it to the summit. The last km to the summit is not a hike like rest of the trip so far. There are ropes you need to use while climbing albeit entirely non-technical. The aim is to reach the summit before sunrise, have a look and head back. Most people spend hardly any time at the top - its windy and very cold!Once back down you have another breakfast before you start your decent and are back at the base by around 2-3 pm. Have lunch and head out. A highly recommended 3 day weekend activity for people in SE Asia."
220,Feels like a never ending staircase workout but the sunrise and sunset views are worth it,"The group i was with, we climbed the mountain, and i would highly reccomend that everyone who is in Sabah, to climb this mountian. It is easy trecking majority of the way up to the lodges where you spend the night. After that it does become more scrambling, and you need to have some level of fitness to complete the very top. Amazing views and kind guides, the guides do seem to tell us different answers, but you can usually work out the answers yourself. Families can go up, groups can go up. You will have to book guides and fill in paper work. And could be outside peoples budgets, but its such a great achievement once you complete it, its well worth the money, travelling and sweat."
221,Better set your pace slow  ,"Great experience, simply a must do and really quite achievable with moderate fitness. The summit climb since the 2015 earthquake is longer than on most advertising and although many state that no fitness is required, I would disagree some level of regular strenuous activity is definitely needed however a beautiful and non stressful journey worthy of enjoying every minute and absolutely amazing views. Such good value for money."
222,Not just for climbers,"Over two days this is challenge to someone of ""average"" fitness. It is steady going on the way up and monotonous on the descent, down, down, down..... A great feeling reaching the summit and seeing the sun come up. A little chilly but not too bad."
223,Conquerable mountain for anyone!,"It's a strenous climb! Take it slow & steady, no rush when comes to nature.. Enjoy all the scenery in Mesilau Trail. Do not carry too much stuffs - Set change of warm clothes, socks, wind-breaker jacket, apples, raisins, isotonic drink / water bottle, disposable raincoat, cap is a must. It's best to hire a porter to carry your bag except cash. What awaits U, majestic clouds-caped mountain with crisp fresh air, a sense of accomplishment.. If U couldn't reach or face disappointment, take to heart you're blessed & fortunate to have the privilege climbing Mount Kinabalu ^^"
224,Excursion,"This was really tough but so worth it! I didn't make it right to the summit, just to the base of it, the altitude really got to me so we decided to settle with the top of the mountain just not the peak! My partner stuck with me and the rest of the party made it the few extra hundred metres to the summit. I consider myself reasonably fit but really struggled for the last few hundred metres with fatigue and breathing. I now realize that it was the altitude effecting me.The climb in the dark was very scary to start with and I have got to say that I was totally unprepared for this part of the climb. Hauling myself up the mountain face in the dark by a rope was not something I was expecting. Once you start you have no option but to continue as there is a long line of people behind you. You need a bit of upper body strength here to haul yourself up. I have got to say that the trek down the mountain was as arduous as the climb up,and I nearly cried every time I saw a stair for the next few days!My advice is do some training, lots of walking up and down hills and stairs. There are SO many steps, man made and natural, they seem to never end.Take warm clothes, it does get very cold at the top of the mountain, but layer them so you can add and then peel off.Take it easy, it's not a race and you will need your energy for day 2.This was such an amazing experience, the view was incredible and the comraderie with other climbers fantastic. I both loved it and loathed it."
225,Awesome,"What a great adventure - moving from the lower levels where it's around 28 degrees, gradually working up paths and steps and granite boulders, base camp just 5 degrees, 3AM start to hit the peak at 5AM (little early for sunrise!) to enjoy the minus whatever weather at the top!! But the view on the way down of the valley and the island, the sun peaking through the mist and the clouds, even the pain for the next few days was worth it.A real sense of achievement and easily achieved in a day and a half!!"
226,"Summit climb, Mount Kinabalu",Beautiful mountain and suitable for young children to visit . Sunrise were so beautiful . Definitely will come back again .
227,Breathtaking. ,"Did the 2night/3day tour with Borneo Adventure.  First day spent in Kinabalu Park on trails and in botanical gardens.  Spent night in Hill View Lodge which was better quality than expected and woke early to clear view of mountain.  Left Timpohon Gate at about 9am and after 4 hours arrived at Laban Rata.  First four kilmometres was mainly steps and not too tiring but last 2k was tougher, it felt harder on the way down!  Rest of afternoon to rest before ascent early next morning, food at LR really good considering it's been transported by porter up the mountain.  Early night, everyone seemed to be in bed before dark.  Quick jam sandwich before leaving at 2:45am in long line of climbers some determined to get to the summit well before daybreak.  More steps from LR then onto the ropes for section before Sayat Sayat and then another steep section beyond there.  Felt precarious in the dark but descent in daylight was ok, although it is steeper than it looks on photos.   Arrived at summit at 5:50, perfectly clear and incredible views as sun rose.  After photos back to LR which took about 1.5hrs.  After breakfast and brief rest it took about 4hours for return journey.  Harder on knees than ascent but great sense of achievement on arrival back at Timpohon Gate.  We had fantastic guide (Dawat) who provided lots of advice and pointed out flaura and fauna, he also gave us as briefing of what to expect on summit day.  Some complained that their guides didn't really engage with them but we could recommend ours.  Some soreness in calf and thighs for a couple of days, we trained for six months beforehand and couldn't imagine doing it without proper preparation and equipment, there were some who looked like they were going for a gentle walk in the countryside.  We now look back and reflect on this as a wonderful experience and the summit views will stay with us for forever."
228,A must do activity in Sabah,"Although not an easy task to scale the mountain but worth trying. Once on the peak, the spectacular view and breathtaking scenery are worthwhile."
229,Simply amazing ,"It was an awesome experience climbing Mount Kinabalu as this was my very first climb of any sorts. never thought it would be such a daunting task as a trained very lightly for 3 months which was a mistake. It is important to climb hills where there are plenty of steps as you will be glad you did. Using a treadmill or exercising on a cycle may help build stamina but it is oif little use done over 3 months. Hill climbing is better as advised by the Mountain Guide. Use a walking stick or two and I am glad the Guide insisted I use one during climb in Mt Kinabalu. It was a 'life' safer. It eased my climb especially on the way down. One is good but 2 walking sticks are better. A Guide can only take 6 climbers in a group. Fast climbers can go on ahead but the Guide will stick with the last climber at their pace. Once you are fit, you will enjoy the climb from the start till the end. I was lucky not to get a headache due to the altitude (being very slow going up) so adjust and do not rush. Get an oxygen can as it might come in handy. It clears your headache quickly. Breakfast was early at 2am so you need to adjust to that. You can stay an extra night in Laban Rata if you are in not hurry to climb the very next morning.The view at the top is absolutely magnificent and you can enjoy the morning Sun as you make your descent. I was reluctant to leave the beauty of the Mountain. A rain coat is an absolute must as it rains at approx KM4 - KM5 going up and coming down as well. Drink water as it helps you in your climb. Eat chocolate bars, bananas and raisins as it is more appetizing considering the fatigue and limited rest areas which is at every kilometer. I am glad I sought the advice of other climbers as it really prepares you if yiou are a first timer. I have seen people of all ages going up and coming down without much fuss so if you are planning to do it - go for it. Have a great climbing adventure!!!"
230,Beautiful trail. Disney squirrels included.,"I went twice times for the Mount Kinabalu Climbing and it is a MUST place to go every year! I admit it that climbing the Mountain was very hard, however trust me when you reach up to the peak and when you saw the sunrise, you will get such a sense of achievement that is unbelievable until words can't explained it! It is truly an amazing experience, worth of time and money to climb the Mountain. For the guide and meals, everything was good and just nice. We stayed at the Gunting Lagadan dorm and for me it was a just nice place to take a rest for 1 night. :-)If you want to try this out just be careful of the altitude sickness as it hit some of my friend. Also, do bring enough warm clothes and socks. :-)"
231,A must do climb,"We trained for 2 months before embarking on this climb.Personally, I feel that this climb is not for the faint hearted or someone who hardly exercise. On Day 1, we started off at around 9am and reached Pendant Hut at around 4.30pm. There is a shelter at approximately every 1km complete with 2 washrooms and 1 big tank of untreated water for you to fill up your bottle.It would be best to travel light. But we decided to engage a porter after our driver questioned our ability to carry the 2 bags up. So we decided to pass 1 of our 7kg bag to the porter and alternate the other 6kg between the both of us. It was a wise move as the climb up was not easy.Lights were off around 8pm+ at Pendant Hut and we woke up near 2am. It was quite hard to sleep much over there as it was a dormitory.We embarked at 2.30am. It was cold. But, it will be better to wear layers as it will get warmer as you trekked. Walking stick, headlights and gloves are recommended.We trekked at a very slow pace as the air was thin and we were feeling very very sleepy. Energy bars do helped and I kept popping sweet every now and then to keep my throat moist.The trekking involved climbing up certain slopes using ropes. The last portion to the summit was really crazy. I was on all fours trying very hard to climb using my bare hands up to the peak!By then, the sun was already very bright and sunny. BUT i was glad I DID it! Now that you are on the very top, please do not think that descending is easy. It was tough. If not, tougher as by now, your knee joints would be very sore!We went back to Pendant Hut to have our ""breakfast"" at around 10-11am+. We departed the hut at 12.45pm.We tried our very best to descend as fast as we could but the sore knee joints and thighs were against us! We trekked till the night fell and once again, we have to rely on our headlights on the last 600m out. We reached the Timpohon Gate by 7pm!All in all, this is a trek that requires strong determination and perservance. You must keep telling yourself that you can do it! All the best to all the future trekkers! =)"
232,Climbing Mt Kinabalu with a child,"My first climb so I can't comment on how it compares in terms of difficulty, but doable for someone who hasn't trained specifically for this but maintains relatively fit. Recommend planning and booking months (4 at least) ahead as the demand is pretty high and it's hard to get dates you want as it gets close. Also check for rainy seasons. Really hard to describe seeing the starry night when you start the hike to the summit at 2+am as well as the glow over the flatter area near the summit and nearby peaks as the sun rises - nothing short of magical, the view is definitely worth it. Be prepared to do the entire hike with no sleep at all - possibility of sharing a dorm (mine at Pendant Hut had 14 beds) with people who snore so it could be a sleepless night. Energy gels and bananas are lifesavers. I recommend the Via Ferrata too if you don't have a fear of heights (..still winged it anyway!), but do wear a long sleeved top even if it's warm - less than 2 hours on the Via Ferrata and my arms were badly sunburnt. Food up there is surprisingly decent - remember that everything you consume/use up there has to be carried up by porters."
233,Adventure in Borneo!,"endless stairs and slopes, from Laban Rata to summit, all  views are amazing, especially the sunset and sunrise!! Sandy  stars in the sky!!!!"
234,great,"I have climbed Mount Kinabalu four times - started from Timpohon gate (3x) and tried Mesilau Trail (1x). The climb requires great mental strength, physically trained-legs (Yes, it's strenuous!) & fit lungs (at certain level you may pant for breath due to high altitude / low oxygen level). Despite the struggle, I have seen beautiful sunset from Laban Rata Resthouse, while the whole majestic mountain became bronze in colour due to sun rays. Ever climbed in February, the trail was blooming with various colors of flowers, plants & wildberries amidst the cold temperature. It's amazingly beautiful to see colours surrounding the greyish mountain. The best part was staying in Sayat-Sayat Hut (it's no longer available for climbers to stay), gazing outside to the sky and counting countless trillions of twinkling stars; after climbing under strong wind & heavy rain. The satisfaction of being at the top of Mount Kinabalu, is surely indescribable. It's a part of great accomplishment in life. For mountain climbers, this should give a go! You'll never regret of your own unique personal experience. Just be open minded & accept the challenge. Still, I hope the charges / fees can be lower for people to enjoy their climb and the trip shouldn't be rushed / not confined to 2-day-1-night for unpredictable weather of the mountain. It's taxing on the physical body for climbing for 4-6hours before reaching resting house / huts. All the best efforts for the Management to re-consider suggestions from different ones."
235,No walk in the park,Mount Kinabalu climb - I had booked through amazing Borneo travels. They charged 1190/person in 2017. Exercise for 2 hours 1 hr in morning and 1 hr in evening for 1 month prior to your climb and make your body fit. It is a bit over priced but worth it. I had only done half way but it was still worth it.
236,The Must Climb of Asia,"Mt. Kinabalu is unique and beatifull mountain. But the climbing system on the mountain is a shame. Sutera Sanctuary Lodges terribly overpriced the accomodation on Laban Rata hut and there is no chance how to avoid their business it you want to ascent the mountain. There is no freedom on the mountain at all. If you are lucky enough to get a spot for the climb you must follow the business rules - take useless local guide, pay terrible amount of money for the accomodation in the hut and to the agency (Amazing Borneo or similar) which is useless as well. Food on the mountain is like a banquet, too much of everything. But the most important stuff for trekking in higher elevation is missing - drinking water is not included in the price of the feast. Real mountaineerers would cry what was done with this amazing mountain. Now is probably the most expensive 4000metres peak in the world..."
237,Overpriced,"Though I been climbed Mount Kinabalu for fifth times with family but it never make me feel bored. My little girl has been climb since in the age of 7  years old. Until now she has been climbing 3 times.   Is not the certificate we collected but the beautiful scenery and awesome fresh air at the summit of Mount Kinabalu. We feel very proud to stepped at the summit of Asia. We have planned to climb again on Dec 29, 2012."
238,One of the best experience and amazing view on top,"Train hard, totally worth it. Its breath-taking at the top for the Sunrise. Pathways were paved for even for recreational climbers with ample pit stops. Not easy I must admit.Guides were professional and assisted in many ways."
239,Do not underestimate the mountain!,"2 days 1 night is enough to scale up the mountain. Make sure you had the fitness.Depends on the weather, it could go from sunny breeze to cold icy top. Plan your timing. Recommended to ascend on mid-February to end-August.Register yourself at Kinabalu National Park. and had the climbing permit approve prior to your climbing day. Guides and porters available."
240,Beginner trail but still enough challenge,"We are very fit distance athletes, cycling and running aged in late 30s. We went with Amazing Borneo Tours who offer one day climb packages. We started at 7:30 with our guide and the rules say you must reach the overnight checkpoint by 10am to continue to the summit by 1pm at the latest.We climbed steadily with a few very short stops and reached the checkpoint by around 9:30am. From the checkpoint most of the walking is on the cliff face following a rope which can be used to pull yourself and steady. We reached the peak at 11:30am, and admittedly quite tired and getting out of breath. We did however drop our guide a number of times and to the top :-). Hence, we took 4 hours for the climb and 3:30hrs to descend. My wife is very fit but a little unsteady and cautious descending. However, we made it the entire way back by 3:00pm, so plenty of time to spare.Based on our experiences, considering we are not rock climbers by any means we feel that very fit people can certainly do the climb in a day. We climbed in shorts and t-shirt only carrying a light jacket for the very top where the wind blew and the temp dropped. We ate a couple of energy bars and water only.Hope this helps anyone thinking of doing the climb in a day"
241,Easy climb with fantastic views,"This is the hardest challenge I have tackled in a while and the legs are still sore 5 days later. We climbed via the Timpohon trail which begins the first 2-3km with gradual climbs broken up with flat sections to regain some energy. From about 4km to the rest stop at 6km is very difficult with relentless, steep climbing up rock steps that really take it out of you. The rest at Laban Rata (or Pendant Hut for Mountain Torq) is a relief and the earlier you make it up the more time you have to relax before early tea and bed at 8. It took us 4hrs to climb from base to Laban Rata (6km), then up at 2am to climb the last 2-3km to the summit. My partner began to suffer from the altitude and demand of the morning walk and headed back to bed early on. The walk to the summit is extremely tough with strong wind, using rope to pull yourself up rock faces and waiting for the chain of people in front trying to move up makes for a slow, painful start to the morning. The wind was very strong at the top and visibility was poor so a few of us got 200m short of the summit and waited on the flat for the sunrise. Everything seems much easier with light - and seeing the way back down makes the descent much easier that the ascent. I took on the Via Ferrata to descent to Laban Rata which was great fun. After breakfast we powered down the mountain to get back down as quickly as possible (to finish the pain as quickly as possible 😊). We took just over 2hrs to descend but to be honest we moved pretty quick and if we weren't as sore we would have spent time appreciating the view and flora of the mountain. This is by no means easy and if you aren't used to long hard walks this will hurt and try to defeat you. Having said that through all the pain and wish to get off the mountain; there is something about taking the challenge on that will leave you with a better understanding of yourself and what you can push yourself to achieve. The views from Laban Rata, with a hot tea or coffee in hand, are very humbling and calming. As everyone says, this will seriously test you mentally and physically but if you're keen: everyone seems to take something special away from the challenge! Good luck 😊"
242,Very good and like it.,"Went there in September , 2014. The guide was super awesome and accommodation was ok with awesome food! However, it was a bit crowded. We did the Via Ferrata and it was a pretty awesome experience which I recommend. You don't really have to be that fit to get to the top. I was pretty unfit and a smoker I was also going straight after 8 days of trekking in Nepal with a sore body and managed just fine."
243,Almost awesome,"Didn't climb Mt. Kinabalu but saw it from the distance and it looked majestic, with its irregular peaks rising through the mist. There should be great weather to see this sight clearly, and I thank God, I was blessed to see it even though the weather was generally wet."
244,Amazing hike!!,I have climbed mount Kinabalu twice using Timpohon gate and mesilau trail. It was an awesome trip on The way uo to The mountain.beautiful view along The way and mountain trees and inci weather.IT Is a must go place!!
245,Hard but awesome experience,We had never climbed a.mountain before and didn't know what to expect. Yes it was tough and challenging but the reward of coming up to the summit was worth.it! Make.sure.to get a English speaking guide.
246,Fantastic experience,"This is the first mountain climb I have experienced. It was amazing, there were times I wondered why we had booked the trip, as the climb was very strenuous due to the altitude. However when the summit is reached just before sunrise and you see the view its well worth it and all the pain and breathlessness no longer matter. You are literally on top of the world! The route itself is well laid out with wooden steps in places and ropes to help pull you up the steep mountain side over the last 500 meters or so. There are little shelters in the first section of the trek at approximately each KM for the first 6km of the trek (usually covered on day one) there have water stations (water tablets needed before drinking) and a flushing toilet! The walk back down the following day (from summit to  power station start point) was tough and walking poles really are essential for stability. Would I do it again ..... without a thought!"
247,Awesome but really hard job,"Wow. This place is special. The hike is amazing. IT is hard. But with a normal fitness you'll be fine. Just make sure you take your time. Make small steps with a consistent phase for you. The sunrise is amazing. So beautifull. Ofcourse you need to have luck with the weather. But the summit is at 4095m, so most of the time you are way above the clouds.Do make sure you take enough clothes with you. Becaus iT is really cold at the summit. Although it feels warm at basecamp. Goodluck."
248,nice nature conservation area,"Beautiful well maintained track. Technically, it was an easy climb as certain parts of the trail have stairs, toilets, mineral water reservoirs, etc. First timers will find it hard as the body needs to acclimatize itself during ascend/descend. Seasoned mountaineers will find it easy. Still, this is an enjoyable climb. If it rains heavily, no climbs are allowed since it will be very slippery.Dinner at Laban Rata is awesome. Eat a lot for your energy and body heat, you will need it later for the climb to peak.I would really recommend to descend via ferratta. Note: It was the highest in the world. I would assure you that it was safe. No worries."
249,"Extortionate, overly controlling and unfair","We climbed to the summit of Mount Kinabalu with Amazing Borneo tours. It was hard work but definitely worth it. The hardest (and probably most fun) was climbing to the summit at 3am on day 2 in the pitch black with just a head torch and a guide rope. But the views on the walk down (once the sun had risen) were incredible. Make sure you book a nice hotel for a few days after though, exhaustion and severe muscle ache will come to find you."
250,Beautiful,"We did the canopy walk and I don't particularly like heights, but I was glad I did it, the only thing I would say is you do need to be relatively fit to do the walk up to the canopy, if you have any unsteadiness in the legs it is not for you."
251,Majestic Kinabalu,"did lots of research and because i was planning to climb the mountain during public holidays in China, it was SOOOO expensive... instead, my boyfriend and I went on a mountain biking trip with Bike Borneo so we got to do exercise, stay in homestays with villagers, and SEE the mountain as we cycled around it. it was great! just an idea if you are unsure about the price/effort!"
252,"Tough, and worth it","Honestly, I didnt really do any training before the climbing. Well 2 days before the expedition, i went jogging and the day after went swimming for an hour and that's it. It was pretty nerve wrecking as most stories i heard involved 'cramps', 'super cold', and 'mountain sickness'. Being a first timer, i could only pray that everything will go well. If u dont have a pair of hiking shoes, u can stop at pekan Nabalu and buy these shoes called adidas kampung. Plain rubber shoes with spikes but really, really good. So we started the climb at Mesilau gate.The view was absolutely stunning! Half way it started to rain and the higher we climbed, of course it got colder. 6km later we reached the intersection called Layang-layang meaning we still had another 2km to reach the main checkpoint: Laban Rata. The route after this... is a lot tougher. I say u've got to have the determination. and the endurance of course. otherwise it would be hell for u. I reached the rest house around 8 hours later, with sore feet and torn ligament. Well not really. The lunch provided was good. I hit the sack at 8pm, knowing that i had to wake up at 130am to continue the climb. So yea we started climbing for the summit at around 3am. i have to say i really love this part. it was pretty steep and it is advisable for u to hold the rope during climbing, in case of sudden gust of strong wind. Reached summit at 6am, the view was super stunning!!! that's when i thought, this is all really worth it. While descending, please ask your guide to bring u to the 'mata air'. Gorgeous view!! And this is the time when u realise that u've been climbing some crazy steep mountain! thanks to my adidas kampung, i didnt really have any problems slipping or anything. Right after having my breakfast, we headed down for the Timpohon gate straight away as the check out time is 11am. The route was a lot easier then Mesilau but it was kinda boring. All trees and.. well manicured tracks. But since i was already limping, it wasnt really a big deal. So yea i really had fun climbing mountain for the first time ever. I had to walk very very slowly and was kinda traumatised to see staircase a few days after the climb, but really, it is all worth it words cant even describe it."
253,Not easy but worth it ,Weather wasn't the best but area very nice and pretty. Much cooler up there. Don't forget the bug spray!
254,THE HIGHEST PEAKS IN EAST ASIA -4095.2M,"did the 2 day trip with my family of 4 including son 17 and daughter 15.  we are an active family but this trip was challenging and not for the faint hearted.  the kids loved it. day 1 is 6 to 7 hours to the mountain hut. although it's trail walking the incline is very steep.  day 2 is awake 02:30 and leave 03:00 to summit by 06:00 for sunrise then all the way to the base with a meal stop at the hut en route.  the reward however is a view from the top that will put a smile on your face for the rest of your life.  it was a true adventure and i really enjoyed meeting walkers/climbers from all over the world.  we had and needed raingear but also had small packable umbrellas which were very helpful.  even the best raingear is hot and stuffy -  a great accomplishment - and after 4 days, our legs didn't hurt anymore......"
255,Expensive but worth of money,"Very beautiful mountain, worth every step to climb, be warned the top is mostly obscured by clouds so if you see the top clearly its a bonus. Great treks at the base definitely worth exploring just watch the leeches. Be sure to take a raincoat and a jacket at the base also well needed. The restaurant at the mountain is expensive, if you leave the park at the entry gate and walk across the street there is a great, cheap local restaurant you can eat at."
256,"4th Time, New section on the climb and still as enjoyable!","National park booked with borneo trail. Herman our guide for the day was ace, very knowledgable and wore us out"
257,Great for birding but too over-developed,"Mount Kinabalu is amazing. The ascent is tough,after 6 km walking through staircases and slippery stones, you will reach the huts (we stayed at the amazing Laban Rata). At night (2 am) you will start the climbing until the top (2.7 km),not difficult but hard (some ropes at the beginning are maybe necessary,but nothing special). You catch the amazing sunrise over that granite mountain,wonderful!! Then you start the descent,after had breakfast at the hut. The most difficult part is this one: the last 6 km down will seriously stress your ankles,knees and legs. There is not a pair of shoes better than the others: the porters carry on the shoulders 35 kg using flip-flops!! My suggestion is to use mountain boots,I saw people going better with them (less risk of slipping..).Enjoy that mountain,enjoy your effort to conquer the top.God Bless the porters!"
258,Amazing experience,We booked to climb Mount Kinabalu about almost a year ahead before the earthquake. The climb took 2d1n and require you to stay at Laban Rata before continuing summit attack early in the morning. There are several guesthouse/shelter at Laban Rata to suit you preference cost but Laban Rata guesthouse really amazing and comfy to stay. The new route to Sayat sayat offer difference experience compare to previous route before the earthquake. This was my second hike climbing kinabalu and it was so tiring and requires lot of training but you will reward amazing scenery at the summit.
259,Beautiful views but you need to be fit to climb the mountain!,"We book this trip 6 months prior and start hiking training every weekend. The hike on day 1 is very manageble if you're generally sporty and exercise regularly, we finished it in 5 hours. However, after reading laban rata at 3200M and needed to wake up at 1.30am to catch the first round breakfast before reaching the submit, the real climb just starts. It requires a bit of climbing in a relatively unpleasant weather condition - very windy and cold. I felt great after reaching the submit by 5.30am, nice scenery and sunrise and need to start walking down hill. Walking poles are strongly recommended as it helps you a lot both uphill and downhill. This is definitely once in a life time experience, highly recommend anyone to do that. Just pace yourself, nothing is impossible - the youngest participate was a 4 year olds Malaysia kid and the olderest is a 94 years old Japanese woman!!"
260,Don't miss it! I love it!,The hardest is the last 3 kms of the descentThe climb in the dark on the second day is a godsend as one can't see how steep it is.
261,Beautiful,"We went there with my friends to celebrate my Birthday on the top of the Borneo! Two of us are experienced hikers and climbers, the other two had no hiking experience at all, only gym. So as you can imagine we had our reservations. None of us ever been that high up in the mountain, so the concern was not only about getting to the top physically but also we worried about high altitude sickness.First day was great! It was sunny and we were in high spirit! It was tough on our legs at times when high up boulders carved as steps begun towards the end of the trail. Also gasp for air has made us to slow down. However, we made it to the top by 2pm ish and we started hiking at around 10 am. Note: packed lunch provided by organisers was terrible. Cold and old sandwich with coleslaw:((( So bring your own packed lunch and through the one they give you in a bin!We stayed at Pedant huts. The facilities are basic but it was warm. We had troubles sleeping that night because the walls are paper thin and you can hear every noise. So bring some sleeping mask and ear plugs if u have sensitive sleep. The food served at the dinner was tasty and great! Full of carbs!!! Which is what we all needed before our final accent to the summit. The views from the balcony at the restaurant are jaw dropping!!! While admiring the views, we stuffed our bellies and went to sleep at 7pm. Woke up at 1am and had our breakfast. Breakfast was quite basic, just some toast and jam. I would rather have a bowl of porridge! You can bring your own if u want, the hot water is provided.So we packed only essentials to the rucksack to lighten up the bags and begun our assent. The most difficult parts were long straight stairs at the beginning and then before the summit, the white rope and straight long walk up. Don't walk straight. Zig zag instead. We were blessed with the weather again! The sky was clear, slight wind and not a cloud! The views at night were mind blowing!!! We got to the summit at the right time just as the sun was beginning to rise;))) we were over the moon that all of us made it to the top! Although myself and a friend of my started to feel a bit strange at the last push to the summit but we drunk plenty of warm water and rested when we needed. So nobody developed high altitude sickness, which was great!The views from the summit are so rewarding!!! It was amazing!!!! However, I must say that if you don't exercise and not a hiker, think twice before attempting this mountain. And definitely follow your guide advises. They are there to make sure that you are safe and sound!Otherwise, if you are thinking of whether to do it or not, DO IT!!:))))"
262,Nothing beats the view,"this mountain is stunning, unfortunately we didn't have the time on this trip to climb but would definitely do next time.  We only spent one night here, but would like to spend a couple.  The park is so huge that the Poring Springs side and canopy walk take a day, so we didn't really get enough time to explore the other side.Some great little eating places on the road up and had the best Tom Yum up there that we had on our whole trip : )"
263,scale MT KK and walk the Torq,"We climbed through Downbelow Adventures and it was fantastic. Our guide was so friendly and helpful, and the accommodation was a 4 bed dorm room and was very comfortable. The food itself was fantastic was you consider everything has to be carried up the mountain. In terms of the climb itself, it was HARD. I've ready lots of reviews that say you don't need to train. I disagree with this. It was physically and mentally tough. I haven't climbed any other mountains - so maybe if you have this is quite an easy climb. I didn't make it to the top, I stopped at the check in point 1.6km from the summit and sent my partner the rest of the way. It wasn't a very clear day and while he was proud he made the summit he didn't get to see the sunrise.A few other notes on the climb - It is very very cold. Layers are your best friend here, because as you climb you heat up. It is also very wet, my socks and shoes were soaked. I wished I had a third pair of socks I could have changed into before the climb down. Make sure you take ponchos and a headlamp. It is very dark in the morning. I'm not sure if they do this every day - but they had homemade cupcakes you could buy the day we climbed so if you are celebrating a birthday you can still have cake! There is also a postbox up there, and you can buy stamps and postcards at the rest house."
264,My first Mountaineering,"Full trip was planned under Sutera Habour, and it cost me around RM 390, excluding tour guide, certificate & transport fee. We start our journey around 8 in the morning and safely arrive Laban Rata rest house at 2:30 pm, served with meal after check in. It was heavy rain after we arrived, temperature drop and no heater supplied in the bathroom, freezing!!! I rest around 5:30 pm & start my next journey at 2:30 am after supper. It's quite tough for me to climb up to the low peak, because it's hardly to breath & route become slippery & dangerous along the way. The ""will power"" must strong enough and I keep telling myself ""I can do it !!!"" Sunrise on the top is extremely beautiful, we arrived on the top around 6 in the morning, & return at 7:15 in the morning after photo shooting. The return way, most probably can arrive at Laban Rate around 8:30 am & touch the ground before 3pm.   It is well worth the effort at 4095M, 8.7KM. And I'm really brave enough to attempt to reach her. I MADE IT!!!!! Here I need to special thanks to my super nice tour guide, Mr Kuinten Bin Gangok. He is very a responsible person and very on time. We have a very nice adventure with him."
265,Rewarding hike with breathtaking far reaching views. Take and drink plenty of water!!!!,Did the Timpohon trail - challenging for someone who went without any training. Views from the summit was spectacular! Extremely cold. Altitude sickness prevented many from reaching the summit.
266,Nice Hike,"We did the trek over 2 days and loved it! In brief: The hike to Laban Rata took us around 5 hours (taking in the view along the way) which is well worth it for sunset over the clouds and a chance to acclimatise. Laban Rata was OK, very basic, drinks (especially water) are very expensive. We got up at 2am to head for the summit, making it in good time for a spectacular sunrise. At this stage our guide was very helpful in guiding us as to where to step up the rocks and using the rope. Back down for breakie at LR, food is ok, nothing special; but you are up a mountain! Don't expect a nice shower, the water is ice cold; all part of the experience! The last few hours through the jungle to the park HQ was very long and hard on the knees so be prepared. Overall the trip was majestic and well worth the hike and the cost! Highly recommend it for anyone up for the challenge!"
267,Day out in the mountains,"I brought foreign friends and family with kid to Mount Kinabalu National Park.I am quite disappointed cause no activity for kid, not much maintenance same as 5 to 10 years ago. The environment is good and worth to go but no improvement on the facility. No explanation on the plants or species at the garden.There is road map on the garden but no details information."
268,Summit Mount Kinabalu,"Yes, the views are spectacular (both from ""base camp"" and the top). It is a great experience. But I was shocked at how the whole thing is pretty much entirely stairs. Makes it REALLY hard on your legs and knees. So if climbing mountains is your thing, it may be really worth the trip. But if you aren't really prepared, this may be more than you want to bite off. I think pretty much anyone could make it, but you may have trouble walking for days."
269,Amazing,"We had two perfect days with the weather on our climb and it definitely is a tough climb. My wife and I are both young fit and healthy and found it a good test and legs were aching for a few days after. Well worth it when you get up towards the summit, views are amazing and so peaceful there.Try to get an experienced guide who can point some things out along the way"
270,Stunning views and amazing experience,"This was my first time as far as trekking goes and i had amazing time. Mount Kinabalu is going to be the first of many for me now. the view at the low's peak is breathtaking. i couldn't do via farata, will try and incorporate that if i do mount Kinabalu again"
271,Picturesque Granite Formation,"We wanted to climb Mt Kinabalu (family trip, 5 persons), as a friend of mine did it 20 years ago. He told me about the wonderful walk and the incredible views. As we spend some time in Borneo, and do a lot of trekking and mountaineering, we were thinking  to go there.We tried several agencies (as it is mandatory), and the cheapest price was 2000 USD for the entire family !!! For a 2  days tour on a mountain with a trail!!It must be unique on earth . We just came back from Mount Everst Base Camp Trek and we spend approx. 1500 USD for the family for the 2 weeks...  In the Alps one can do as many 4000 m  he wants for free... Price seems to be heavily overcharged and probably the best way to stop this trend is to boycot such places. There many other great things to do in Borneo, that are fairly priced."
272,Spectacular ,"We booked the trip through amazing Borneo & it really was amazing! They pick you up from your hotel & issue you with a pack lunch, bottle of water, identity tag & guide then take you to the starting point where for 10ringett you can hire a walking stick (I would happily have paid more & was sad to part with it at the end) The climb is hard & if like me you are a slower walker insist on setting the pace, otherwise you feel like you are holding the group up. The first 4km is steps & big steps at that, some came up to my knee if not higher which is where the stick comes in. There are rest stops every km with flushing toilets and your guide will let you stop for as long as you like. After the first 4km the ground becomes rocky which I found easier to handle than the steps although difficult when raining as they turn into a river. Laban rata is a welcome sight & provides comfortable beds good food & big mugs of tea & coffee. Extras are expensive up there but the porters carry it all up 30kg at a time so if you want a beer after the climb you will appreciate the cost! Dinner is plentiful & we were ready for an early night. 2am comes round after a good nights sleep & more food is provided. It was then head torches on & off into the dark for the climb to the summit. This is easier in the dark, as you can't see the ledges, but frustrating as you can't see the top! Altitude can be a problem, I found it hard to breathe & felt sick & nearly gave up with less than 500m to go. Thanks to our guides patience I made it to the top before it got too busy & just as it was gettoing light. The views are incredible & well worth the climb but be prepared to battle with other climbers for your summit picture & appreciate the views & your achievement from a little lower down. Don't be disappointed if you miss sunrise or don't get one like us as the views are still incredible. When your ready it's back down to Laban rata for breakfast & then it's off down the mountain in time for afternoon tea & the bus back to your hotel.  Overall; Freendy our guide was patient & cared for our safety. I took a few slips & he was always ready to catch me. Use the equipment list & go prepared. Waterproof gloves are a must for the night climb as the ropes may well be wet. Disposable ponchos are also good as you can throw them on to cover both you & your bag without carrying too much extra weight. Also a bit cooler than a Mac. There is no hot water at Laban rata so be prepared with wet wipes for a quick freshen up. Deodorants explode up there due to the pressure, so don't bother carrying it up. Both me & a room mate covered our room with ours - both roll on but apparently sprays do the same. Dorms are mixed & climb groups are kept together. We were a group of 2 & shared with another couple. Don't bother with taking nightware up everyone sleeps in their clothes & take layers for the night climb. By the time you near the top it's freezing so you need to be able to add or remove easily. 500ml of Water is provided & there is fresh water to refill bottles with at Laban rata. Warm socks are also a must for over night as you won't feel like walking round in your walking shoes. Take a high energy snack for the climb up as the pack lunch is sandwiches & a piece of fruit. The climb down is hard but our guide didn't rush us. Have tiger balm at the ready for aching legs. Steps were a challenge for me for a good 3days after but KK residents seem to be used to seeing people struggle following the climb & are happy to help you. I has an amazing trip & it was well worth the pain for the sense of achievement. Go prepared for all weathers with a spare change of clothes & a book for Laban rata as there is no entertainment up there, but most importantly take a fully charged camera & determination. Come back proud to have reached the summit of the 20th highest mountain in the world!!"
273,Stunning cloud forest,"Like most of the other climbers experience,they do enjoy the climb to the summit of this majestic mountain.Beautiful scenery and very challenging for most climbers."
274,An Amazing Trek to the Top of Borneo,"I decided to climb Mt. Kinabalu solely to do the via ferrata.  It was really difficult and though I'm proud of having done it, I will not do it again unless a porter carries me up and down the mountain.  Did this fairly last minute with no training as a relatively active 20-something.  At that time, I was snowboarding, skating and playing ice hockey regularly.  But none of that helped with the steep trail or the altitude.  Near the peak, I constantly felt out of breath and had to rest every few minutes even though I wasn't really exerting myself.It is very interesting to see the change of environment as you up hiked up the mountain.  You go from lush rainforests to barren red dirt to jagged rocks.  You also notice the flora and fauna changes every km you walk.  Then suddenly you realize you're above the clouds!  It's a little surreal.Facilities at Laban Rata are basic.  However, I had never been so happy to reach a plain hut with shared accommodations and freezing showers (brain numbingly cold).Dress in layers as the bottom of the mountain is hot and humid but the peak is freezing cold.  A  balaclava, a toque, a fleece layer and a waterproof jacket are essential for the peak.  Do not underestimate good hiking shoes!  I wore running shoes and found the rocks very slippery in the rain and/or morning dew.  My guide grabbed my arm at multiple downhill areas to stop me from slipping and possibly going off the cliff.  Also, remember the sunscreen if you are fair skinned!  You're super close to the sun with very little atmosphere to protect you.Grab a massage or a nice long soak in epsom salts afterwards if you can.  Don't be like me and hop on a plane to my next destination upon decending.  I was so sore and walking funny for 2 weeks afterwards.Oh, and definitely splurge on the via ferrata course.  It was the best part of the whole climb!  Hanging off the side of the mountain above the clouds away from the crowds of hikers.  Can't beat the feeling and the view (even better than at the peak)."
275,One of The Best experience of our lives!!!,"Nice nature sanctuary with great views.The road is a bit narrow once you enter the park so you need to be very careful on your driving,"
276,Climbing mount kinabalu via new ranau trail,Definitely worth the hike. Spectacular view of sunrise from the Low's peak. We chose to spend a night at Laban Rata to be able to witness this and we were also awed by the Rock formation from Sayat-Sayat checkpoint way up to the summit.
277,Be prepared to pay a fortune. ..,I am not very fit but decided to climb Mt Kinabalu. I meant to train for it but didn't. I quit smoking 2 days before the climb to give myself a better chance. Bloody hard climb but completely amazing and fulfilling. Still can't quite believe I made it to the top. A crazy adventure that has shown me that I can do anything if I put my mind to it!!!!!!!!!
278,Lovely view,"A lot of web sites say this is easy if you have moderate exercise a week,not true you must put in the work for this climb,it takes 4 to 5 hours to get to the hostel and its all up hill and it is steep,the night climb takes its toll and this is when you need youre guide, trust him he knows,this takes 2 to 3 hours again its steep and the lack of sleep and air will affect you,again put the miles in back home climb every hill you can,no hills travel and practice we did and it does pay off we passed lots of people who failed or took hours to complete the climb,it's hard work but the sense of achievement is brilliant,but coming down is even harder your legs will hurt badly,again put the work in it will pay off don't let me put you off go for it and you will feel absolutely on top of the world."
279,Hardest thing I've ever done,"Even if the weather was not on our side during the climb, this was a unique experience, could do with no steps all the way that really push you to the limit specially on the way down."
280,Mountain climb,"Gorgeous scenery, quite a distance from centre of KK. Need to hire a car or go with a tour company. Car hire is cheap. but packages can be pricey."
281,Exceeds your expectation on every turn,It's too expensive. We were not aloud to climb to the top beacuse the weater was too heavy. No refund at all.
282,slow climbing and enjoy the view,"Went with Go Go Sabah who provided a great service, high quality guides pat good value for money. Could have been a little more organised with sending us a full itinerary.The mountain was epic - if you're reasonably fit but haven't been specifically training you can do it, but it is tough! Amazing scenery, fiery glorious sunrise and morphing clouds made for a magic summit experience- but the cherry on top was really the sense of personal achievement.Bring thermals, good shoes, rain jacket, changes of clothes, and HEAPS of plastic bags in case of rain. If you have bad knees, bring a walking pole, a stick, or check if your guide might have one. Really helped coming down."
283,A nice short challenge,very nice weather and atmosphere plenty of forest and greenery...needs 3 days to stay here at least....
284,Our experience of a day climb starting in Kota Kinabalu,We only went to the base with the kids but the 2.5 hour journey there offered plenty of breathtaking views of this mini-beast. The weather changes by the hour so the scenery can dramatically alter  as you wind up and down the mountain roads. We started the day in bright sunshine and ended up in thick fog with a driver who obviously knew every twist and turn of the road as we headed home at breakneck speed!
285,Outrageous Money Making Rip-Off,My girlfriend and I did this climb with no prior training over two days and one night. The first day was terrible due to the weather but we had a cloud-free morning on the trip to the summit and got some amazing photos. Approximately 4-5 hours of walking during the first day and 10-11 hours of walking on the second day. I would definitely recommend a raincoat and gloves as well as a couple of sets of clothes and plenty of water and snacks. Climbing is at your own pace which was great. We booked through Mountain Trails and Tours and can definitely recommend them. Cost was approximately $800AUD for two people booked from Australia including transfers - you could get it cheaper booking in KK but we wanted to secure a spot given then only allow so many permits on the mountain per day
286,wow,"My 23 YO son and I decided to climb Mt K K. He is 23 and I was a fit 59 YO. First thing to say is that it is a tough climb. It is not easy. First you have potential altitude issues at 4000 metres. Secondly the summit climb is very tough. The first stage is a 1 day climb to Laban Rata guest house, about 2/3rds the way up. We went the Mesilau route up and Timphoon track down. We really enjoyed one of only 2 private rooms with hot showers. Do yourself a favour and book the private rooms. You need to do this many months in advance and through an agent. We used Borneo-Eco Adventures with Quester Wong who was terrific. Accommodation the night before, Laban Rata plus organising and the climb and transport was MYR 1400 per person.At 0200 hours in the morning we made for the summit with headlamps. You have limited vision and a lot of hanging onto ropes and crab crawling on rocks. We summited just on sunrise at 0545. It was worth the pain and effort. The view was stunning. 2 reasons to go at that time. To see the sunrise and have a couple of hours of clarity because often the clouds come in later and you have no view. Going down was harder. Rocks are very slippery as the ground is very smooth granite. After breakfast at Laban Rata you commence the knee jarring trip down which takes another 6 or so hours. If you do this climb be prepared. Be fit. Take warm clothing for the summit. Take waterproofs and altitude medication - in case and know what to do with it. This is a tough 2 day climb and not a stroll unless you are super fit. Do your research. But it's worth the effort."
287,Great birdwatching and nice stay in the Park HQ,"Fantastic hike up the mountain, with an awesome sunrise view at the top of the mountain. Walking poles are a must for the descent, your knees will fall to pieces otherwise."
288,Feeling so refreshed,"I met some very cool people on my trip up mount Kinabalu that made this a slightly more enjoyable experience and saved my sanity, but everything else was terrible. The hike to the hut on day one is boring with limited viewing opportunities. If its raining the track becomes a stream, progressing into a river the further up you get. Once at the hut there is nothing to do but drink over priced beverages until dinner. There was no heating in the hut or the dorm we stayed in, which was another 10 minute hike up the mountain. Our clothes were wet and we had no means to dry them in the cold damp buildings, no hot water available in the showers to ward off hyperthermia and the toilets quickly became ponds with the Malay habit of spraying the toilets and no one mopping up the water the whole time we stayed.In summary it was cold, wet, boring and very poorly run. I would not recommend this to anyone, even in good weather"
289,I Miss You Mount Kinabalu...,It's definitely a tough climb to the summit not to be undertaken unless you are feeling fit & well.But the summit is amazing and even though your legs will hurt the next day it's worth the plob.
290,doable,"My wife and I had the opportunity to climb Mt Kinabalu last month. It was tough but definitely worth all the pain and aches. On the first day, the 6km climb up to Laban Rata via the Timpohon Trail is not so hard, climbing on mostly gravel/laterite steps with rest huts along the way. It is only after the 4th km, the climb becomes harder as it is steeper and the air thinner. The advice is to climb slowly and steadily, it is not a race and speed is not important, reaching our destination is. We must allow our body to adapt to the altitude. Upon reaching Raban Lata, the atmosphere is totally different, Cool air, serene surrounding, just beautiful. At night, take the opportunity to admire the stars in the sky and the lights in the valley below, if weather permits. Get as much rest as possible before the second half of the climb early the next morning. The 2.7km climb to the summit starts at about 2 am, it is pitch dark and having a headlamp is very essential. Again, climb slowly and steadily. Do stop to catch our breath if necessary. There is nothing to see in the darkness except the trail of lights indicating  the climbers ahead and follow the white rope up to the summit. The hard rock surface can be slippery and sharp. Besides having a pair of good hiking shoes, a pair of thick waterproof gloves is a must have. When we finally reach Low's Peak (4095m), the sense of achievement is overwhelming. The scenery and the sight of sunrise is amazing. The descent is in fact harder and more dangerous than the ascent. It hurts your legs and toes (trim your toenails). As it bright by then, we will be able to see the steepness of the climb and wonder how we manage the climb up earlier. It is a long descent but when we finally receive our certificate for the climb, the feeling of self-satisfaction will soothe the aches. It is indeed a fantastic experience! We yearn to do it again."
291,Tourist,The dormant volcano view was unique n worth trying thou the eateries qued up at this beautiful natural site are a Dampener..
292,Can't miss it,"We have just got back from Climbing Mount Kinabalu. I am pretty fit (run 40-60kms per week and cycle and do yoga etc) but I still expected to struggle and was worried about the altitude. We set off from Mesilau gate after 10am (having flown into KK just the day before and spent the night there). We walked up at a steady pace without really stopping much. There was a mix up and we had no packed lunch anyway so no real reason to stop. We reached Laban Rata after just over 5 hours. The climb is not easy but if you get into a rhythm and your legs and lungs are used to working it is really not bad. Laban Rata was great and we were fortunate to have the one private room in the main building with hot water and heating. Dinner was delicious and much needed. Due to our fast first day ascent our guide told us we only had to start our summit hike at 3am (not 2am, YAY) as that would give us plenty of time to reach the summit by sunrise. We had a reasonable sleep from about 7:30pm - despite the thin air and pouring rain outside - and woke fairly easily just after 2am very glad to see the weather had cleared overnight. By 3am we had eaten and were ready to go. We followed our guide in the dark and kept a steady slow pace (although we passed loads of people) and carried on to the top without really stopping at all. We reached the top at 5:25am.I felt fine and wasn't really affected by the altitude at all.  Sun rise came and was beautiful but having stopped we got very very cold and sitting still in the wind was not nice so we opted to head back down. By 7:40 we were back at Laban Rata. We spent an hour having breakfast, chatting and packing up and then headed back down. I was the first off the mountain taking just 2.5 hours to descend. My legs feel like they have worked and my ankles are a bit stiff but otherwise I feel good. I loved it and would definitely recommend it. Do prepare for it and make sure you are fit and used to using your thighs, calves and that your knees are strong. Byt if you are fit and healthy it is a great and very satisfying experience!"
293,Wrong time of year to visit.  Only a few orchids to be found.,"One of the hardest things I have ever done but worth it! Reaching the top for sunrise was magical! To date the most memorable experience of my life. My partner almost made it to the summit but altitude sickness got the better of him so he slept in a basic hut which they have near the summit for people who feel unable to reach the top. He slept there and waited for me to go and return from summit. He said it was absolutely freezing in hut. On the hike up the landscape turns from tropical to alpine to moon like near the top. Views on the second day were absolutely stunning. Make sure to bring a hat, gloves and warm jacket because it gets really cold on the second day, particularly near the summit. I loved hiking in the dark on day two, we hike up one behind one another with our headlights, it’s so peaceful up there. Was very exciting that all these people are awake for the same thing to get to the top. Can go up in trainers, my guide said it’s less about good shoes and more about balance. So no need to splash out on fancy mountain boots. It’s not essential. I went up with new balance trainers. Pleasant stay at Laban Rata rest house. Cosy accommodation and atmosphere with great views and nicely presented and prepared food and drink. They have board games to play. Water for shower was ice cold. But I heard others had warm showers so maybe there is hot water for showers but just limited. Pace yourself to avoid altitude sickness. Anyone can make it to the top you just need to believe that it's possible and take it at your own pace. Cardio workout like jogging and running up and down stairs will help prepare. It's a very expensive mountain to climb but it’s worth it if you have the money. I really enjoyed seeing a mix of people from all over the world including Malaysians themselves hiking the mountain. Was one of the best experiences of my life and would recommend it to everyone who likes a challenge. Mount Kinabalu is the reason for my new found fascination for mountains and desire to climb others around the world!"
294,"Awesome climb and views, great sportive challenge to do it in one day!","1st day in the National Park: you walk up from 1850 hm to 3300 hm. depends on weather: warm, lot of sweat ant it takes aprox 4-5 hours. the sleep is very flat in this height. you walk from 2.30 at least three hours up to the peak and reach in 3 to 31/2 hour. Cold. windy. nice view and sunrise. now you have booked via ferrata? 1,5 hours to the entrance of via ferrata and than 3 to 4 hours back to the lodge in 3300 hm. short break an down in 4 to 5 hours or maybe six to the entrance of the NP. you have to be in a very good condition to stand it! if you are not sure you can do it, so don`t book it because you dont get any refund!!"
295,"Tiring Climb, Spectacular Views, & Totally Worth it!","I am a first timer for trekking/climbing. This is my first time writing a review, hope it helps anyone out there. Sabah is a really great place with very warm and friendly locals. Mount kota kinabalu is a must-go in my opinion. I would definitely visit sabah again.While climbing the mountain, we met climbers from the age of 7(Caucasian boy) to age of 70.It is definitely physically and mentally challenging , but a reasonably healthy person would be able to complete the climb. Be mentally prepared to meet endless of staircases and up-slope for 6-8hours. I can't walk properly the next morning after completing the climb, calf and thigh muscles are aching badly. Me and my buddy only did jogging 2-3 times a week for 2-3 months before climbing. Advisable to do staircase training before going.It is advisable to train before going for the trip. Being physically prepared will let you have a more enjoyable time while climbing. We were focusing all our strength on climbing and couldn’t enjoy the scenery fully.There are 2 starting point for the climb. The mesilau trail and the timpohon trail.The Mesilau trail is 2km longer than the timpohon trail, but it offers a greater scenery as compared to the timpohon trail. While climbing the mesilau trail, we pass by hanging bridges, ""waterfalls"" and open areas that are picture worthy.Timpohon trail does not have these. Timpohon trail mainly consists of staircasesFrom the airport to kota kinabalu park is 2hours car ride.We reached our accommodation at mesilau around 5pm. It is already quite cooling when we reach mesilau(around 2000m above sea level). Buffet dinner is served at 730pm.There is a buffet breakfast in the morning. Advisable to eat more as you will need a lot of energy for the climb. After the breakfast, we meet our climbing guide Zul at 830am. We moved out immediately after he gave us a short briefing. Most locals there are able to speak simple English. My attire from Mesilau to laba rata was running shorts, plazma skin for thighs (abrasion prevention) and dry fit T shirt. I would recommend not wearing too many layers for the first part of the climb.  It took us 6-7hours to reach laban rata. Note: Remember to water proof everything in your bag. It rained when we were climbing. Keep your poncho/ rain coat / wind breaker at accessible place so you can take it out easily and wear it fast when it starts to rain. Try not to get wet, it becomes really cold.We sleep around 7pm after having our dinner at laban rata. Woke up at 130am to have our buffet breakfast before starting our summit climb at 230am. I would recommend to start earlier for the summit climb. Almost all climber will start at 230am but there is only one trail to the summit and we got jammed up at the starting point when we left laban rata. Can checked with your mountain guide if hes ok to start at 2am or 130am. Note: You can leave things you do not need for the summit climb at laban rata and come back to collect it after the summit climb. Check out timing is 1030am at laban rata. We reached the summit around 6 am. Sun will start to rise around 5 to 530am. It’s a pity I missed the sunrise but the view was still breath taking. Attire for the summit climb is very important. I wore long-john , sweater, track pants, wind breaker ,winter gloves and snow cap. Wind breaker is the most important, the wind at the summit climb is very cold and strong. Wearing many layers will not help, unless you have a wind breaker.  I would recommend water proof gloves because the ropes will be wet. My gloves were not water proof and I regretted it because it was so cold when my gloves get wet from gripping the ropes. It is also advisable to get a scarf /mask, so that you can cover your face from the cold wind.After taking some photos at the summit, we make our way down to laban rata for breakfast.  We reach laban rata around 9am. Moved out again at 1030 am after eating breakfast at laban rata. This time we took the timpohon trail. Going down was much more easier.  I would highly recommend knee guards for the trip down. It is very strenuous on the knees for the downward climb. We end our climb at timpohon gate at 3pm. From there, we took bus back to Kota kinabalu park HQ and have our lunch before leaving for the hotel.I would highly recommend Kampong Adidas ( A local rubber studded-shoe) for the climb. It only cost me 6 ringgit to get a pair. Ask the locals where you can buy the shoes before going to kota kinablu park. It is water-proof and easy to wash and dry. The terrain is quite muddy and the rocks are slippery but kampong Adidas have very good grip on the rocks. I think Water-proofed shoes are great idea because it gets really cold when your feet are wet. The only bad point about kampong Adidas, there is no ankle support. Walking sticks is highly recommended for climbing up/down. Wooden walking sticks could be purchased at 5RM at the mesilau trail. Not sure for timpohon gate. The only bad thing about the wooden walking sticks is you cant bring it for the summit climb. It is too long to be kept in the bag. Some part of the summit climb will require you  to use both hands to hold on to ropes. Even if you do bring walking sticks, you would not be using it much.Headlamps is essential for summit climb, because you will be climbing in darkness and hands on rope."
296,Tough climb but worth the experience,"Both me and my girlfriend have been climbing the mountain. We have both a good fitness. I think it is needed to enjoy the climb. Otherwise you   will make it to the top, but it will cost you some efforts.. :)Start early during the 1st day, otherwise you are climbing the last part in the burning sun. With an average pace and rest at every shelter (6 or 7 of them) it will take app 5/6 hours. We stayed at Pendant Hut. Dont expect much (meals, dorms, shower). During our stay there was no water because it didn't rain for 3 weeks. So no showers (otherwise they are cold) and almost no water to wash your face or flush the toilets. You can buy bottles of drinking water (4RM) at the Laban Rata hut (few minutes walk downhill). They also have other drinks or food, but except for the water this is not cheap. The 2nd day you will start early (app 02.30) so you will be on time for the sunrise. Amazing!!! Afterwards you will go back to the hut for breakfast. And do the last part back to the park HQ. This is the tricky part if you do not have an average fitness level.For us, Dutchies is was not cold during the night climb. At the top it was a bit windy and gloves are needed. But do not bring too much clothes. The climb will keep you warm :) You also need good gloves to have grip when you climb with the ropes (to the top and return).In the dorms it's good to have something to cover your ears. Otherwise it's almost impossible to sleep. It's very noisy!!You can only climb the mountain with a guide. Book at KK (Kota Kinabalu) and you will pay 50% less. But you have the risk everything is fully booked. So our advice is to book in advance (or you have some time to wait..). Some of the guides are really good and tell details about the surroundings. We booked with Amazing Borneo tours, everything was well arranged except for the guide. He was really crappy... He spoke little English, cared nothing about our safety (my girlfriend fell a few times, he never helped her, nor did he ask if she was ok). He was either talking to his buddies, texting on his phone or just abscent de whole time.We enjoyed the climb and can recommend it to everyone!"
297,Great Mountain,It was one hell of a hike for the 4 of us last week. But we managed to reach the summit and it was all worth it.I am sharing my trip from my blog should you guys need further information on my travels and expenses the incurred during the travel to Mt Kinabalu :http://pinparadise.blogspot.com/2014/03/mount-kinabalu-borneo-malaysia.htmlHappy climbing !Prana
298,Beautiful Mountain,"For non-professional hiker liked me, this was the most tough trip ever for me. The first day need 5-hour walking up continuously from 2000 sq feet to 4000 sq feet high, it was really a challenge for both physical power and reaction to high altitudes.After taking a few-hours rest at the dorm, I still decided to start my trip climbing up to summit at 2:30am. As there's no tree can survive in such high altitudes, we need to use ropes to help us ""climb"" up in super windy and dark environment. Unluckily, the day i climb up to summit was coludy and we cannot see the amaxing sunrise moment, but we can still see the beautiful nature scene!!To summarize, its really a tough trip and you should be prepared to be exhausted after near 20-hour hiking in 2 days!!"
299,A Breath-taking Experience! Literally and Metaphorically =P,"Climbed Kinabalu on 12 April 2017. We were very fortunate with clear weather. Apparently if the weather is bad, you have to turn back and get no refund. It was expensive, I paid NZD500 in advanced and then when we got to the park, there were more costs involved. However, it was all worth it. The guides were excellent, the food was good, the staff were friendly and helpful. A really professional and well run organisation. A definite must do if heading to Sabah"
300,A wonderful experience ,"Firstly.. don't under estimate the climb! As amateur hikers (NEVER hiked before) we had no idea what we were in for.It was tough to say the least.We researched through Lonley Planet and Trip Advisor but it never really describes how crazy it is.We stayed at Sutera Lodge for the 1st night which were ok just damp in rooms due to being in the rainforest. We shared the cost with another couple for a tour guide and bus to the Timphon gate.The first 6km to Laban Rata were tough so we thought at the time, it was raining heavily the whole time and even with layers of water proof gear we got drenched! Take warm rain proof clothes but if it's raining prepare to get wet anyway!The trail changes from muddy and wet to rocky etc and a lot of stairs.The second day to the summit was unbelievable!We were lucky enough it was open the night before it had been closed due to rain.The walk to the summit for us was crazy hard. Climbing on rock faces with ropes etc can't even explain how scary and hard and mentally and physically straining it was.Reaching the summit was amazing although knowing what you have to climb to get back down played on our minds.Overall it was amazing and scary and unbelievable and it's honestly too hard to describe how it really is unless you do it.Just don't under estimate how hard it is climbing 4000m in the rain and on rocks!worth it for sure if you are physically able!"
301,Tallest moutain in South East Asia,"We have just completed this climb - 2 adults and boys age 13 and 15. We booked the 3day/2night climb directly with Sutera Sanctuary Lodges, the mountain operators, saving several hundred dollars to that charged by the tour companies. We arranged our own transport from our KK hotel (200 RM) and secured a guide when we got to the park . The guide was the only negative about the trip - although a nice enough person he wasn't much of a guide, spending most of his time looking at his phone. Accommodation at Hill Lodge at in the park exceeded expectations - we had 2 rooms/ensuite that were more than adequate - comfortable beds and great food was had at Balsam Lodge. The climb up was tough but do-able for a family of average fitness. Nothing really prepares you for the endless steps though - thousands and thousands of them. Our guide happily informed us that the climb is 70 percent steps/boulders - many of which are above knee height. Tip: rent a walking stick at Timpohon Gate for 18 RM - the best investment you will ever make! Accommodation at Laban Rata Rest House again exceeded expectations - we were given 2 rooms/ensuite again but most rooms were 6 shared/bunks. Considering that everything is brought up on the back of a porter being paid 4RM per kilo the facilities in the rest house were great. There is a small shop there selling chocolate and soft drink etc and the buffet meals provided were excellent. As for the final ascent we rose at 2am ready for supper and preparation for the climb. Unfortunately it had been raining heavily all night and it was touch and go if we would be able to ascend further. 3am the rain stopped and armed with disposable ponchos and head torches we started to ascend. The altitude makes for a slow and steady crawl but the exhilaration of the night climb is beyond words. The temperature drops quickly and soon the layers are on and gloves. Tip: take two pairs of gloves as one pair will get very wet from holding the ropes. We didn't and regretted this as we began to lose all feeling in our hands. The descent was tougher than the ascent purely because of heavy rain, cascading waterfalls off the granite and tired legs - that's when the walking sticks really come in to their own! Despite there being no view at the top, the overall experience more than made up for this. If you're going to do this climb, make sure you stop to take the time to look around you. Take it slow and steady ... the flora and fauna are truly beautiful."
302,Spirits of Mount Kinabalu,"We made it to the summit with my 10-year old boy. We trained for about 10 weeks before the climb, climbing mountains on the weekends and a few walks during the week.  The trail starts with shorts and T-shirt. Advised my boy Josh to take it easy, look for the small steps instead of the big ones, ""baby steps"" all the way, conserve energy. He made to Laban Rata after about 5 hours but he was tired.  He had a headache and no appetite. After some panadol and a quick rest (and SMS-ing mum - mobile reception was good at the lodge) he felt much better.  He didn't manage much food, which I knew would make tomorrow harder.  We slept early ready for the 2am start. He woke up feeling good and had some food at the early morning supper and we hit the trail just after 2 which the other 100 people. The crowded trail help slow everyone down as often we would wait for for a group to pass before we would get going again. About the 7.5km mark Josh ran out of energy. The freezing cold wind meant we could not stop for long.  We rested breifly and had to either go up or down.  Josh was determined to continue, so our guide and my friend assisted him while I helped be the wind break and get him to drink water every 20 steps or so. We pushed on for the last km or so and about 100m from the top, the sun rose over the horizon and the wind settled down. Everything was much easier once the temperature warmed up the the mountain lit up. We made it to the summit about 15 minutes later and queued for our photo with the sign. Definitely needed the ski gloves, down jacket, bennie, windbreaker and warm pants.  It is bitterly cold and very windy just before sunrise.  We started the decent after about 30 mins at the summit and slowly made it back to the rest house at about 9am. We had a big breakfast and set off again at 10am after checking out.  It took us about 3.5 hours to decend. Definitely appreciated the walking sticks on the way down. We were exhausted afterwards and we all slept in the car on the way back to the hotel. I suffered the next day, not just aching legs, but also a fever and a bad tummy. The fever passed after 24 house but the legs took about 3-4 days to recover."
303,Extraordinary View & Experience ,"We had to do the climb again as we have not done it since it was reopened in December 2015 after the earthquake of June 2015.We booked direct through Sutera Sanctuary Lodges who operate the accommodation at the Park Headquarters and on Laban Rata (where you will stop after the first day's trek). One day treks are not allowed anymore until further notice. Initial stages of our communication with Sutera Sanctuary was not easy but we found no problems once we got through and we communicated through emails and phone calls.For those not familiar with the process, Sutera Sanctuary runs the accommodation. One may choose to stay out of the park headquarters, which means you will book a 2 day 1 night programme with the Sutera Sanctuary people. We booked a 3 day 2 night programme, which meant that we got to stay at the park headquarters.One would have to have a booking with Sutera Sanctuary for a climb programme (whether direct or through another agent) to be able o climb. There are two parties at the park. I shall relate our experience so that you will get an idea of what to expect especially if you are doing it independently of any other operators.We arrived at 12 noon on 2nd March and after lunch at the capital, made our way to the park headquarters. It took about two hours and a bit. Taxi or van hire is about RM500 return (they pick you up two days later for the return journey to the capital) but we had our own vehicle this time. Driving there was a breeze with the GPS. En route, as we usually do, we stopped at village about half an hour from the park, where there are fruits stalls etc.Check in at the Sutera office was a breeze. We stayed at the Hill Lodges which is quite a distance from the Park office and getting down to the coffee house for meals will be a bother unless you have your own transport or have some arrangement. If you are staying at the hostels, then it is within a 15 minute walking distance.After checking in for the accomodation, we then went next door to the National Parks Office to pay our permit fee and guide fee. We are Malaysians and thus pay less - about RM50 for the permit. The guide costs RM230 per guide (for a max of six people). We did all this on the day of arrival because we did not want to do it the next morning when there would be a frenzy of activity at the Park office. The guide will be assigned the morning of the climb. If you need porters, tell your guide and he will direct you to a group of porters waiting near the Park office. Or, your guide may offer to carry your stuff so that he can earn the extra fee. Either way, porter's fee up to Laban Rata and back to the Park office is about RM10 per kilo. Take note that the porter does not carry your stuff beyond Laban Rata where you will spend the night on day 1 of your climb.For ease of reference, here is the various sections of the climbPark HQ -Timpohan Gate (start point)Timpohan Gate - Laban Rata (rest place after day1)Laban Rata - Sayat-Sayat Hut (last checkpoint) - SummitHere is our experience:Day of arrival: Our Hill Lodge sleeps two to a lodge and faces the mountain. Good views in the evening and early morning. There is a briefing done by the Sutera Sanctuary people at the coffee house at 6pm, just before dinner. Dinner was ok. Don't expect five star hotel stuff but it was sufficient. On our 3 day 2 night programme, we were given 7 meal vouchers which you must present at various points:Dinner at Park HQ on day of arrival; Breakfast at Park on climb day 1; Packed lunch on day 1 of climb; Dinner, early morning tea (at 2 am!) and breakfast at Laban Rata; and finally lunch at the Park HQ.Day 1 of Climb:Breakfast was adequate. Loaded up our water bladders. recommended 2 litres but we took three litres. Got our packed lunch and off we went after meeting our assigned guide, who decided he will be our porter as well and got our tags (**Remember to have your tag at all times or you will be denied entry at the various checkpoints). One will have to pay about RM12 for transport to the trail-head at Timpohan Gate.Timpohan Gate - Laban Rata (about 6 km) took us about 4 hours. Three hours would be very fast and anything between 4-6 hours would be the norm. There is no point reaching Laban Rata early as your room/ accomodation may not be ready.There are huts along the way where one can rest but don't expect the toilets at these huts to be too tidy. Be warned: At Laban Rata, drinks and stuff can be very expensive. You will understand why when you see the people carrying up heavy loads of supplies to Laban Rata. A 1.5 litre mineral water bottle costs RM14 (which is more than on the last huts in the Mt Everest region!), a cup of hot choc about RM20 and a can of beer costs close to RM40!What we noticed this time is that hot water from the dispenser is still free. Dinner was at 6pm and by 8 pm, everybody was asleep. We had a VIP room on this trip (there are only 2) and it sleeps two, has toiletries, towels, a portable heater, attached bathroom, tea making facilities and an entire hot water tank in the bathroom to yourself. People living in the dorms at Laban Rata will always be told that there is no water or no hot water supply in the baths.We had a peek at some other huts, notable the new Lemaing Hut nearby. It is a dorm with more than 10 beds in a room but we noticed electric showers. Whether they worked, we don't know.Day 2 of ClimbBy 12 am the next day, people started to wake up at Laban Rata and early tea was at 2am. Quite a spread for 2 am! We started only at 3am and by that time most people would have already started.Laban Rata - Sayat-Sayat Hut - Summit:  The section from Laban Rata to Sayat-Sayat Hut is new and was mostly made out of wooden steps. This new route adds about 400-500 meters to the trail but seems easier as it had less rope sections and one did not have walk along ledges as in the past. As a result, there are less 'bottle-neck' sections where one may have to wait for others to pass first.Tip: Our trek up to the summit took about 2.5- 3 hours (about 3 km and a bit). If you know your speed, it may not be advisable to start too early as this would mean that you will have to wait it out between rocks and crevices to shield yourself from the cold/wind while waiting for sunrise. We wore three layers - a dry-wick baselayer, a technical jumper and a waterproof jacket.We had a fantastic day and the sky was as clear as can be. The peak was packed with people and of course, there was some inconsiderate people who will just hang around the top and thus not affording others with a good photo take. Also, we observed that despite past fatalities, some people were still climbing over the wire fence onto unstable rocks fringing Low's Gully.Our favourite section was from the peak back to Sayat-Sayat Hut. No reason to rush as it was so beautiful walking down. Trek poles on this morning of the climb would be more of a bother than assistance as there are many sections where hands are needed. However, we still had a trek pole with us just in case.With the sun, we could clearly see the parts which got sheared off during the Earthquake. At Sayat-Sayat Hut, you will have to show your tag (up and down) and you will be asked whether you would like a certificate at the end of your climb - go ahead, have one!). The walk down from Sayat-Sayat Hut back to Laban Rata on the wooden steps is very scenic and is along a ridge. Don't worry about a fear of heights - there are no scary sections unlike the old route. All quite safe. On the old route, one could not see much of a view. So, this is a plus point.Back at Laban Rata (after about 2 hours) from the summit, breakfast was served and one is expected to check out by 10am.Laban Rata-Timpohan Gate-Park HQ:Took under 3 hours but I must admit that we were rushing it a bit because some of us had a return flight to catch that very same evening. If we took 3.5-4 hours, that would just about be right. Lunch was served from 12-4pm back at the Park HQ café. It is good that they now open for lunch until 4pm because most would only reach down after 2pm.The weather was the best in my 4 climbs and I would certainly do it again. The downside is the price involved in the entire endeavour. One could fly to Indonesia from Kuala Lumpur and do a volcano (which is an equally exhilarating if not a more 'wild' experience) at a lesser price BUT there is something special about Mt Kinabalu.Am thinking of another trip soon!"
304,A Truly Special Place,"We just went for an unaccompanied day walk from the Mesilau gate. Wonderful scenery and biodiversity even if the first kilometre is a bit tough going. If you love nature and exertion, go and do some climbing in the park even if you are not doing the summit climb. Well worth it."
305,Mount Kinabalu and sabah,"We hiked to the summit in two days. The path to the top is quite easy, but very exhaustive. We stayed at Lemaing hostel, which is normally only available for Malaysian citizens. By doing this we paid 200 ringgit for the accomodation instead of the 600 that is usual for foreigners. Bring warm clothing as the top can be freezing. Definitely go here if you are in good shape!"
306,God's Mountain...,"Note to self: Always do some research before going hiking at any mountain more than 3000 meters.Me & wife were attempting a 1st time climb via the Mesilau trail which was 2km longer than Timpohon trail, the objective is to start the hike at 8.30AM and reach Laban Rata by 5pm. We only managed to reach at 6:30pm.The final 1km to Laban Rata was just too punishing for us, fatigue kicked in due to the altitude, and the cold wet weather battered our willpower in every step that we took. It even crossed my mind that I just want to lay down and sleep and stop climbing.We encouraged each other, and rested 1 minute for every 20 steps up, in the end we made it to Laban Rata and felt so grateful while eating the fried rice and hot Sabah tea in the small and warm coffee house.After our light dinner, we napped until the next morning at 2AM, we decided not to go up the peak, as we gotta save some energy for the descent later at 10AM. We got down and reached Timpohon gate at around 3PM, it was a more relaxing and healing journey as we passed by the never ending mossy mountain walls and enjoy the light foggy breeze in the jungle.I shall never forget the experience of walking above the clouds via the Mesilau trail, it was very scenic and felt sort of like in the Lord of the Ring movie. Just more training is required whomever wants to go up by Mesilau.With gratefulness, I shall climb again to enjoy the sunrise at Low's Peak."
307,Must Visit,"Travelling with family I couldn't stump the excessive tour charges to climb the mountain so we opted for some treks in the National Park instead. The trails are well signposted but are nothing to write home about, the two park restaurants are ridiculously expensive (eat at the one opposite the entrance). The best part of the day was driving the scenic road from KK."
308,"So amazing, all I can say!","The mountain never failed me with it amazing view and green surrounding. WIsh i can climb the mountain again one day. The weather was good at that time, an advantage for that day climber."
309,tough but doable,I climbed the mountain twice and loved the experience + nature surrounding you.You should be reasonably fit to be able to climb the mountain.The journey can be reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllly tiring and challenging to your physical and strength especially when going up.The guides and porters are very helpful and experienced climber too
310,Mt Kinabalu v Mt Rinjani,"My gf and i signed up for the 2d1n Mt KK ferrata climb package with a Singapore based travel agency. The ferrata climb package included a one night stay in pendant hut. It is a dormitory with common toilets and bathroom. The dorm comes with sleeping bags which are clean and definitely warm enough for the night.All accommodations at Laban Rata are non-heated and w/o hot shower with the exception of  Laban Rata Rest House which is much more expensive.  Our trip was in early Feb which was outside the peak period. The good thing about climbing during the non-peak season is that the prices are slightly lower and it is not so crowded. Feb is towards the end of rainy season. It was drizzling throughout our climb but still manageable with poncho. We attempted the Low's Peak ferrata circuit which took us more than 4 hrs to complete. The ferrata activity looks frightening but it's actually very safe.  The essence of a modern via ferrata is a steel cable which runs along the route and is periodically (every 3 to 10 m) fixed to the rock. Using a via ferrata kit, climbers can secure themselves to the cable, limiting any fall. However it is a strenuous activity especially when you do it just after the summit climb. The greatest obstacle is height phobia. If you are of average fitness and not afraid of height, you should be able to move pretty fast down the ferrata line and complete the circuit within 2-3 hrs. My gf who has some height phobia inched forward slowly which resulted us in taking more than 4 hrs to complete. This is my second visit to mount KK. The first time was about 5 years back. The package is getting more and more expensive. The industry or maybe tourism authority is making good money out of it. It is definitely one of the most expensive recreational mountain to climb in Asia. However the ferrata being one of the highest in the world is really a highlight in itself and shouldn't be missed."
311,Earthquake closes mountain,"Climbing to Laban Rata is not particularly difficult, it's really nice with beautiful flora and diverse ecosystems on the way...Waking up at 1:30 the day after is a bit tougher but you will surely be very excited so that will help! Final climbing to the top is not that hard, but we did not have enough warm clothes so we were really frizzing at the top, dont make the  same mistake and be sure to have enough layers...The view is an amazement, we were absolutely speechless. Oh, and if you are not part of a large group travelling with agency , dont hesitate to ask your guide to leave a bit earlier than the rest of the people, you will avoid queueing at some point of the trek  when there are ropes for example...We did this and really appreciate to trek without stopping every time.The toughest part was definitely the descent from Laban Rata, not technically difficult per se ( you're basically descenting what you ascented the day before) but boring, endless and not legs-friendly...We did another mistake as we just left for the descent after the breakfast at L. Rata, it's surely better to take your time and rest a bit before leaving,but we had a bus to catch at the HQ...So overall I would say it's pretty feasable,not technically hard, but i doubt everyone can make it as the park seems to promote,for example we did pinnacles in Mulu 2 years ago, whereas it is commonly admitted that  they are much more difficult than Kinabalu , we both thought that Kinabalu was more exhausting (the descent, again!) at the end even if less technical , and we are good trekkers, but maybe we did not have enough rest after climbing to the top...."
312,A time to pray,Just came back from the climb at My Kinabalu (08 march 2017). For my experience to all climbers. Please bring a pair of fresh new trekking shoes.  Because for my case. My Timberxxxx trekking shoe sole came out during the climb. For my suggestion also bring along some cable ties in case the same thing happened​ like me. You can use it for temporary securing your shoe sole and continue the climb. Standby a pair of slippers too. You can use it as your last option if your footwear give way. For my case. My trekking shoe sole totally ripe off during the last 2km of descending. I have to walk 2km with my bare foot with 3 layer of socks to prevent my foot get hurt to my destination. Running shoes for the trail is okay but not so good during bad weather. Tracking pole is also advice to bring along because it is good during descending. Bring along some paracetamol in case you have attitude sickness. For my case I took more than 8 tablets during this climb. ( 2 tablets each time). Bring the rain coat with the head's string attach because it can secure around your head and will not block your view during the climb. And for other things else you can download​ the checklist (Things to bring for the climb at Mt. Kinabalu). Before I end here. Wish you have a wonderful climb.
313,Altitude makes it hard going,"Me & 2 of my mates made the one day climb on 9th Aug 2014. It took some time to persuade the Ranger but it worked out. I did that via couple of emails and phone calls prior to our arrival.It took us 2:30 to reach Laban Rata, cca 30 min break and another 2:30 to reach the top, 30 min on top then going down in cca 3:00 with 30 min break at Laban Rata again. All in all starting around 8 morning coming back before 17. Solid one day hike.I would consider us as reasonably fit but not athletes or pro sportsmen.I read some reviews here that you can manage it in around 5hrs up and down which I really doubt as the best time by professional is around 2:50 as far as I remember the board at the entrance to the park.2 day hike will make the trip really comfy as you might end up walking only half days."
314,An Amazing Experience,"To be frank me and my hubby decided not to spend 250+ usd per person for 2-days climbing. Instead spend it to surfing and diving. Well, nobody told us 5 pm the gates to the mountains are closing. We arrive appr 3:45 pm and i almost cried to persuade the guard to let us in for just 45 min. Not so much, ya? We run as fact as we could to see the max we can. I like a lot Carson's fall - little waterfall yet very beautiful and relaxing. The problem started the higher we went - the steps of the staircase were uneven, slippery and solid. If i were not in the sport - i would die there (remember, we tried to run). U are not able to see Mount Kinabalu as there are many trees. Rain started. The temperature go down. brrrr....... We reached the sign 2300 m and decided to went down. What i can say - i was proud of myself, i was delighted to see some macro world on the walls. If i had chance to go to mountain - would i go? No. But it's up to you to decide."
315,Top of South East Asia!,A must to climb it - experience of a life time.  Absolutely breathtaking sunrise at the top!
316,"Amazing experience, too expensive","The journey to the peak of Mt KK is tiring and it requires lots of hardships and determinations. When you are the summit, all the hardships that you have been through is all well worth. The wonder of nature is amazing! Go for it!"
317,Botanical Gardens,"This was my third climb up this beautiful mountain. Went up with my teenage kid. Couple of mistakes I did unfortunately. Our tour agency picked us up from our hotel at Kota Kinabalu rather late and by the time we reached at Kinabalu park at the foothills it was already 10am - a compounding mistake followed. Typically it takes about 5 hours to reach Laban Rata. Unfortunately  it was raining all the way there. Shoes were all wet and cold and the journey got further delayed.When we reached the dorm at Panalaban it was rather late with dinner almost towards the end. (It  closes at 7am. And they don't provide WATER for their buffet dinner. You have to pay additional!)Also there is NO hot water to bath. Same thing since my first climb in 2010. 'Sigh'Although we tried to continue with our second phase of our trip to the summit at 2:30am, we had to turn back as we had altitude issues as we did have enough time to acclimatize.And it rained again on our way back as well!Overall a great experience despite the poor weather. Will do it again anytime."
318,Hard Work,"We climbed to the summit on a four-day trip. The views along the way are gorgeous, but the climb is rough and very difficult. I would suggest you train superbly well for such a climb, because it wrecks havoc upon knees and leg muscles. The weather is unpredictable, so come prepared with WATERPROOF clothing and lots of warm clothes as well. There is no warm water at Laban Rata resthouse, so come prepared to expect a cold night with freezing water and even colder temperatures. Waking up at 1.30am in the morning for the final hike to the summit is worth it, even though it was cloudy and damp when we went. If you're lucky, you get to witness a beautiful sunrise. Regardless, the views from Low's Peak are amazing. The guides and staff are wonderful, patient and quite accommodating. Experience of a lifetime!"
319,"More of a ""Climb"" than a hike","Once in my life time we wanted to climb a mountain which is 4000 m (over 13000 feet) high.Mount Kinabalu is very ""easy"" to climb, you can do it in a one or two days trip. You'll have to book in advance as there is a limited number of hikers allowed per day. You have to hire a guide and the tours are quite expensive.But anyway ... it's worth the money. We booked a couple of months before the trip started. In Sabah there is not a ""real"" raining season but still there is a high season where it is best to climb the mountain to have a clear view. As our tour operator recommeded to prepare for this trip, so we did. And I can recommend this too! We did the two-day-tour at the beginning of April.Prepare for this trip, you will need it! It's a really hard trip (and I have climed already a lot of mountains). The path is well prepared and almost every km you have a shelter (and a toilet with flush!). The first day you walk ""only"" 7 km, but the path is quite steep and you will have to take a lot of ladders and climb ""stairs"". Don't rush as you will need your energy on the second day. Take some energy food with you like bananas or nuts.When we reached Laban Rata it was already raining a bit and it was cloudy and foggy so we didn't see anything of the mountain. At Laban Rata you have to check in your rooms, the huts are not heated. There are showers, but also with cold water. We had a four-bed-room. It's very cold up there but you have enough blankets.The restaurant and the view at Laban Rata is excellent. The food is freshly cooked and buffet style, you can eat as lot you want.Go early to bed as you will have to get up at 2 am! On the second day you will descend in the middle of the night. You can have breakfast if you want. It can be very slippery, so take good hiking shoes with you!You'll need good torches and warm cloths (the temperature is about zero degrees!). A white rope will lead you up to the peak and at some points you need this rope for climbing.You will definitely recognize the height and the way to the peak is very exhausting. But worth it.At the top you'll wait for the sunrise. It's very windy and very cold up there. But it's worth the trip.We were lucky and we had good weather and a beautiful sunrise.The way down on the second day is the worst part. You'll have to take all this steps down and you knees will definitely hurt.It was one of the best trips I did in my life.What I can recommend:Book in advanceTake some energy food with you for the first dayWear hiking bootsHire hiking sticksTake a good torch and warm cloths with you"
320,Awesome Experience!!! Bucketlist Check!!!,"A fantastic experience, and one which anyone with reasonable fitness can achieve.  Its the only mountain I have climbed with a rest area complete with flushing (squat) toilet every 500 metres or so.  The climbing is steep but take it slow and enjoy the experience.  The push from Laban Rata in the night is great, and the ropes, although a little daunting to start with, are very safe.  Mountain guides are superb - ask for Sapinghe if you can!"
321,Excellent adventure - Kinabalu Low's peak,"We enjoyed the hike this time round as we were more ready physical and mental.  Take AMS pills if you are worried of getting altitude sickness. After registration at National park, we were transfer to Timpohon gate to start our hike at 8:30am. We hired a porter to carry our bags. We took 4+ hours to reach Laban Rata.  Took nap and had dinner at 5pm.  Went to bed at 8pm and set out at 2am for hike to the peak.  Despite rainy year end weather, we were blessed with cleared sky all the way to Laban Rata and subsequently to the peak.  The view from the peak was simply magnificent .."
322,"An Awesome Experience. Mental, Patience and Perseverance Hike","Nothing but love for this majestic mountain.. climbed 3 times over the years and still can't get enough of it.1st climb, rushed to summit, didn't really get to enjoy the scenery so I came back for 2nd & 3rd just to take in the beauty. Will go for 4th, 5th and so on when opportunity arise.Always will be my favorite spot in Borneo."
323,A Stunning Challenge,"Food at Laban Rata was v good considering the location. The climb is easyif you take it steady and do not rush or over dress. Too may people in Down jackets, we wore shorts and T-Shirts."
324,must visit! Or at least once in a life time!,"Incredible views. Hike of my life.Be wary of the tour guide companies - the cost. You need to reserve a date beforehand and I reserved 2 days beforehand - I paid a lot more then most people because of it...I did the 2 day 1 night package.I have asthma and was able to complete it, but I would lie if I said it wasn't an intense hike. The altitude was pretty bad for me and I was using my inhaler more than I've ever used it before, but there were people along the trail that reassured me. At some points the trails were packed with people and at other times I was the only one there. My asthma was kicking my butt - the altitude was the main reason - but besides that, the hike isn't very difficult.To climb to the summit I recommend doing 2 days. My tour guide was pretty useless, but I think it's required to have one. I recommend not going with a large group also - it will cost more, but it's more difficult to travel in large groups.I didn't have any professional equipment - I had good sneakers with grips on the bottom - important. It was cold on the top and I didn't pack heavy clothes, so I was freezing at the summit. Not much preparation is needed for this hike.But I strongly recommend the 2 day hike because you can see the sunrise. It was the most beautiful sunrise I've ever seen in my life."
325,"So many steps, but worth it.",What a beautiful landscape of a mountain top. Moonscape. Subhanallah. An amazing experience indeed. Beautiful scenic 6km trek from Timpohon to Panalaban/Laban Rata and an amazing 2.7km hike to the summit to catch the sunrise! It's all worth it!
326,Great experiences and views,"Inside the Mt.Kinabalu park is indeed pretty boring nothing exciting or interesting as the garden looks pretty miserable. But having paid the park entrance fee here, one should retained the park ticket if they are planning to visit the Hot Spring at Ranau or Mesilau Park (the new entrance for Mt. Kinabalu climb, only 8 km to the peak). Visitors should take the opportunity for photos shots of the mountain at the market area stop with tower view point 8 km away from the Mt.Kinabalu park. As we do not have a better sight as we reach the park itself. Unless by chance you are in Mesilau (which is a long way in from Kundasang Market area, not accessible without transport) and the weather permit! Also to take note that foreign tourist are charged with different park fees. For climbers - the night stop are runs by Sutera Harbour Resort pretty over priced and a 3 months advance booking!! It was easier and much less expensive when it was run by the Sabah National Park!"
327,"1 Day Summit, Incredibly Challenging, Incredibly Worth It!","Climbing to the top of Mount Kinabalu is one of my wishlist since my first sight in 2014 from the Kundasang view. My opportunity was come to hike to the peak last week.. Honestly, without prior intensive training and preparation, I was quite scared if my body cant adapt the toughness of Kinabalu. However, the climbing was quite amazing. Tired is not an excuse anymore because along the way to Laban Rata, the scenery and fresh air was quite beautiful and speechless.. Our luck might be not so good since we are not allowed to hike to the peak due to weather are so bad. Waiting until 0330 am with full of hope. However, we need to obey with the safety restriction from Kinabalu Park Rangers. For others who are planning to hike, just prepare yourself with full of mentality strength. Keep your stamina at least to control your breath constantly. Hiking pole is additional equipment that helps a lot for your hiking journey. You can rent the pole at Kinabalu Park with only RM10. Keep updating also the temperature and weather forecast at Kinabalu Park. It might help you to be prepared for the worse temperature at the peak that might fall below 0 degree celcius. Lastly dont forget your camera. Keep it charging for beautiful moment to be captured up there especially when you are hike with your love one. For myself, I am looking forward to repeat this trip in able for me to reach the peak. So if your group have any empty slot to fill in, just let me know. HAHAHATQ."
328,Definitely a must do for South east asians,"stay at basecamp near mount.kinabalu, and start to climb at 10 AM, took arround 5-7 to reach labanrata, place with nice food, to summit ussually start at 2 PM, reach 3-4 hours later and enjoy sunrise at top of kinabalu."
329,Great summit challenge and views,"I was very satisfied with Amazing Borneo Tour service starting from the planning session and continuing through reservations, invoicing and during my stay in Malaysia. Service was very good, punctual and friendly. The guide in Mt. Kinabalu was a true professional, helpful and with good sense of humour and the drivers were very friendly, too.Mt. Kinabalu was fantastic. Easy and relaxed (well you gotta be in shape, though) and the scenery was fantastic during the sunrise!"
330,Beautiful & wonderful experience,"It was challenging. It was cold. But the view, was breathtaking. Literally. Its a cherished memory for years to come."
331,spectacular,WARNING: We bought a pair of trekking shoes at Tech City near Jesslelton Pt in KK and they fell apart before we reached base camp.The climb is tough but the sense of achievement is worth it. My girlfriend and I decided to do this trek as part of our travels through SE Asia. It was truly a fantastic experience but I won't be planning on any similar treks for a while!Advice: - Bring 2 pairs of spare clothes. It rained on both the ascent and descent so our spare pair got wet- There is a Sports Direct in KK for any last minute equipment purchases- Take altitude sickness tablets- Take pain killers (headaches can happen at base camp due to the reduction in oxygen)- Hire walking sticks- Bring spare plastics bags to wear around your socks if your shoes get wet- Use salt replacement sachets at base camp- Go at whatever pace you're happy with- Enjoy the sunrise at Lowe's Peak
332,Amazing. ,I decided to climb Mt Kinabalu at the last minute and was worried as I'm not a gym person or in bad shape. An average guy.  It was tough going up but tougher going back down but the views and atmosphere was just fantastic.  Go light and only take what you need.  But go.  It's a fantastic experience but be prepared to be sore afterwards if you are not used to climbing.
333,amazing experience,"It's only 17km of walking over 2 days - how hard can that be? Answer - pretty damn hard when you get up at 2am with very little sleep, and head up towards the summit in the cold and dark. One of the hardest things we've done, and the reward at the top made it worth it. Accommodation down at Park HQ was dated (needs refurb) but a big space and incredible views of the mountain. Laban Rata (on mountain , 2nd night) was slightly ahead of what we expected of a mountain hut with dorm accommodation, but still basic."
334,"Mesilau trail go, Timpohon trail back","Climbing Mt Kinabalu through the Mersilau route was such an amazing experience,the fantastic view of the surrounding valleys,the flora and fauna and being rewarded with the sight of Mt Kinabalu as you reach the top of the route is enough to take your breath away."
335,A Mountain that is Simply Breath-Taking,"I came down from the summit yesterday, my legs are very stiff today but it was well worth it. So I stated in Grace Hostel in Kinabalu Park the night before the climb to get a good rest. My friend and I started the climb early with our guide at 0745. We were first on the mountain and that was great as there wasn't any big crowds, just a few of the porters going on ahead of us and a few people coming down. It rained a lot of the way up but when I got to Laban Rata it was glorious sunshine and some great views up the mountain and of the cloud below. Dinner is not served until 5pm do I was glad of the instant noodles and snacks I had taken up with me. Our room had two bunk beds in and an extra blanket each. It was all clean the bathroom just next door. We had a shower but no hot water. By the time everyone was there in the evening the water was off even for the toilet, so glad I showered early. We went to bed by 1930 as we had a 0230 start to the summit. It was a challenge to get to the top. Ropes across the rock face to pull yourself up on, you need a head touch and plenty of warm clothes, it was very cold sitting at the summit waiting for sunrise even with our thermals and coats on. The views were amazing. It was worth it. Back to Laban Rata for breakfast and then down the mountain. A great way to spend a couple if days. I am quite fit and exercise regularly and didn't struggle as some creating up the mountain, the hardest part for me was getting down. You really need to do some training before so you can enjoy the walk."
336,Nice view through Mesilau route,"Amazing and spectacular view, beautiful scenery. Place to relax to enjoy the scenery and to those loves challeging activity as well."
337,Still can't walk 3 days later,"It is a wonderful experience for you, if you're a mountain hiking lover.There is nice scenery and cooling weather for sure but you should went to a few times of mountain hiking before that for training yourself to get used to it.Moreover, food is necessary especially some snacks or maybe sandwich with meat/ eggs is recommended. For experienced mountain hiker, that will be a good place to relax your body, enjoy lots of sweating throughout the whole journey but you will be have a remarkable outcome afterward. For recommendation, if you are not a experienced hiker, you should try other lower mountains for few months before you challenge Mount Kinabalu as it is for experience or expert in mountain hiking."
338,Great Treks,The multi day trip up the mountain is too pricey for what you are getting. Cold water in the lodge which they are fixing for years now...
339,"Amazing experience, fantastic views",Must do-photos don't capture the mountain-best to go on a tour as they give you alot on information and the journey from kota kinabalu is about 2 hours of windy roads.breathtaking views
340,Peak of my Holiday,"Such an incredible journey! So glad we did the hike.It's not easy. I recommend training! Path is well trodden but it's steep and the steps are relentless at times. It's an expensive adventure. Sutera resorts charge a fortune for the accommodation at Laban Rata but it's so worth it.Hostel itself is grubby and cold showers are unfortunate however all you need is some food and bed and it definitely delivers on that.Do take ear plugs as its noisy creaky floorboards and slamming doors.Food was nice and filling, and endless cups of tea were welcome.Would love to have the opportunity to climb again even though the aching legs takes ages to disappear afterwards."
341,Direct Booking to Climb Mount Kinabalu,"A challenging, but enjoyable climb taking you from the jungle starting point through different ecosystems and geological features to the bare rock summit. Don't summit too early or you'll be sat on a cold, fairly exposed windy mountain top until sunrise! Waterproof gloves and upper body strength are v useful for parts of the rope-assisted route to the summit. I used walking poles up to Laban Rata and found them restrictive for the climb (most of the ascent is either wooden steps or uneven rocks), but v handy for the descent (takes a lot of pressure off your legs and knees). The buffet dinner at Laban Rata was v good - eat plenty!!! They turn the lights off in the entire building at 6pm to encourage everyone to sleep early in prep for the early ascent 0230/0300!"
342,360° degree view if you could make it to the peak!,"I climbed Mt Kinabalu with my mum and we both agreed that it's not an easy mission but definitely doable and definitely worth it! You do have to be match fit but not the terminator to complete this trek. Reaching the summit was one of the most memorable moments and biggest achievements of my life. The track is very well maintained and a guide isn't really necessary but it's mandatory, our guide was mr Wilson and he was bagus! The accommodation at Laban Rata is nice and the food provided is great. There's no hot water showers so don't be let down when you get there just have a quick cat shower. They also have secret beers behind the counter! I'd suggest just to take a package tour which includes almost everything you need for the trek with a couple of small payments on arrival. I'm a travel agent and I tried to shop around but it was a waste of time because the whole treks run by the one company. I'd also suggest to book an extra night post tour at the Pouring Hot Springs to relax and rejuvenate. It's not the cheapest trek but  definitely 100% worth it! Essential things to take with you are a camelbak and lots of water, some hydration powder, energy bars, some decent hiking boots, enough warm clothes, small money for extra water and a cheeky beer at Laban Rata, water proof clothing ""I had a water proof jacket but not pants and it rained the last 2km on the first day which made it a tiny bit uncomfortable.""If your up for the challenge then go for it, I promise you won't be disappointed!"
343,a dream come true..,"Stair stepping for  8.5kil not only up but down in your  ""f""s is tough work. Although it was an achievement without the walking sticks I would have been carried out!I exercise 2 hous a day jazzcize and walking -but beware this is tough but achievable!  The food the base camp is terrible - wonder bread diluted soup  over cooked vegies even though porter carry up items everyday -which is so much more respectful than the quality or cook- I would be shot by chefs around the world to  c all this locals cook a chef.  But I guess this is what you expect at laban ratan camps???This guide great  concerned and helpful.The faculty was ok expensive for all  guest levels but we bought up to private room heat and hot water which no one  else seem to get in hostel bathroom.  Which I don't understand as they paid for this but ""always seem to have an issue"" truly the cost even In hostel is expense give everyone  1hot shower and heat!The second day climb in dark is hard but view is beautiful.The walk down is the hardest part.  I gave it a four star because the experience and accomplishment plus view from the top and helpful guide."
344,Challenging but worth it,"Had an amazing experience climbing Kinabalu. Yes it was tough, but if you're reasonably fit it is possible, a lot of it comes down to determination, and whether or not you get affected by the altitude. Just a few tips for those doing it, as this is the info I needed beforehand and couldn't find!- In low season (I climbed in March) you don't need to book in advance. As long as you can be flexible on dates, you can turn up at the park and book - you may not be able to climb that day, but I met lots of people who just showed up and either climbed that day or the day after.- You do NOT have to book through sutera harbour, and if you do, it will cost a lot more! They charge 781 ringgit for accommodation and food at Laban Rata. There is another cheaper guesthouse on the mountain, you can stay there for a quarter of the price. My friends just asked for the cheap hostel when they turned up on the day, not sure who you would contact to book in advance. Meals aren't included, but you can buy food at Laban Rata - it's pricy, but cheaper than paying for Sutera Harbours package! - You can rent all the gear you need from Laban Rata, jackets are 25 ringgit, gloves are 20 ringgit, and you can also rent head torches. Walking poles can be rented at the bottom for 10 ringgit each.To be fair to sutera harbour, the guesthouse is really nice, comfy beds and the food is great. It's just unreasonable to charge such an inflated amount, and make out that they are the only option, when there is a cheaper alternative."
345,Climbing a mountain over the Easter Long Weekend,"Dont get me wrong the top of the mountain is nice and it  is definitely a challenge which will leave you ""proud"" and quite swore for a couple of days (unless you are very fit). The problem I most point out is that it is very very pricey for what you get. The hostel is very basic (laba ratan), beds uncomfortable and the food is average.Essentially, if you have been to the Andes, Nepal or even the alps in Europe you wont get particularly impressed with this mountain especially considering huge price tag."
346,Swore i'd never do it again..did it again.,"I hired a car and drove there from the center of KK. It is very far from the city about 100 kms. It took 2 hours to go there, if you go by bus probably only one way trip would take at least 3 hours. The road was very scenic and it was so easy to drive. Malaysian people were very helpful, they happily showed me the directions. I drove to the gate, took couple of pics. That was all.Weather was chilly, i saw some little guest houses inside the national park. It is good if you live in a flat country. For me spending only 2 hours there was enough."
347,Spoilt by unexpected downpour but an amazing experience nonetheless,the ascent and descent is very tough particularly if it rains overnight. the accommodation is basic and you must push for Laban Ratan - not any of the other dorms which are even more basic than LR.
348,Physically well prepared is important,"great view, start slowly on the first day and get plenty of rest the night before as most people seems to give up when reaching Laban Rata. the next morning hike for the summit is adventurous. try to make early start around 2am so that u can catch the sunrise. bring plenty of chocolate"
349,Extremely Corrupted Business at Mount Kinabalu,"It was good to hike there, everithyng is already well managed. From the entrance fee, guide, and the tracking is already good. But it comes a great amount of money for you to spend for hiking here."
350,Climb it or skip it,"i am closer to 60 than 50 and i managed to reach the summit at 5:30 (after a 3 hr trek) to wait for the sunrise.......just about everything has been said about the Kinabalu, my contribution is that age matters little, but fitness counts for a lot....however....descending really killed the knees... how does one actually train for that ?big smiles :)"
351,Amazing view!!,"We went in a group of 4 with 1 local guide. We stayed one night at Sutera Santuary Lodges for 1 night inside the Kinabalu National Park before our hike up the mountain.The hike to Laban Rata from Timpohon Gate is 6km  and was advised to reach before 7pm to ensure that we can have our dinner. The Laban Rata Restaurant serve the buffet dinner from 4.30 pm to 7.00 pm. if you missed the timeline, you will have to fork out your own money for dinner. We choose to stayed a night at Laban Rata  in Gunting Lagadan Hut which is a building with dorm rooms inside. There was no heater & heated water. The hut is located 150 metres from the Laban Rata Restaurant which you have to hike up to check into the room. We would prefer to stay at Laban Rata Rest house, but it was fully booked. So do booked 6 months ahead if you want to stay nearer to the restaurant to avoid the climbing up. We reached at 3 pm & waited for our dinner to start. Then we hike up to our room to sleep. We woke up at 1.30am & hike down to the restaurant at 2am for our supper. Luckily the weather was permitting so we start our 2.7 km ascent to the top at 3am. We have to reach the Sayat Sayat check point by 4.30 am to continue our climb to the summit which we did, whew! The ranger of the checkpoint will close the gate subsequently.Thanks to our experienced guide, Marcellus! We reach the top at 6am & rest for 1/2 hour before we descent down to Laban Rata restaurant for breakfast (the stop serving breakfast at 11.30am). The climb has amazing view of the mountain granite with the morning sun light. After breakfast, we continue down the 6km trail which is the tough part because by this time your knees will be protesting against the stairs down to Timpohon Gate. All in all its satisfying to complete the whole hike up & down Mount Kinabalu.Tips:1) make sure you come suitably clothed - beanie, scarf, gloves, surgical gloves, a water proof jacket, long sleeves shirt, thick socks, head lights etc2) a good pair of hiking shoes. Some of us are wearing the anti-slip kampung adidas (cost RM 7.50)3) do bring energy bars & chocolates since the you will need to snack in between your hike. Think 2 bottles of 500 ml water should be sufficient.4) do take short break in between hike to take a sip of water/a bite of snacks.5) you will need hiking stick for the climb up to Laban Rata because some of the staircase are as high as your knee."
352,How to get the 2days/1night-tour the cheapest way!!,"The view is fantastic on top of the mountain. Shooting stars at night, me and my son enjoyed it very very much"
353,Climbing Mount Kinabalu was a real challenging experience.,The scenery is beautiful. I didn't feel tired climbing this beautiful mountain. The temperature is cold but pleasant.
354,"If this is your first mountain climbing, do not underestimate it!","Unfortunately I didn't make the summit due to altitude sickness, but those that did said it was worth the very very difficult and tough climb in the early hours of the morning."
355,challenging,"The climb was tough but amazing. Start early from Kinabalu Park, we were on the trail by 08.00 am. You can hire a porter at the start to carry an extra bag for you if needed. It costs MR 13 per kg and they weigh your bag at the start. We just had some warm clothes for the next morning and a change of underwear so our guide said he would be our porter too. We paid him as the porter and also tipped him as the guide. It took us 3 hour 45 minutes to get to Laval Rata. You are given a packed lunch which we ate when we arrived at Laban Rata but there are rest stops every 1km where you can eat. Each rest stop has a toilet (bring your own loo roll) and water but it is not filtered so if you are relying on that you will need purification tablets. We had a camel pac and so got water at the start and topped up in Laban Rata for day two. Make sure you stretch well when you get to Laban Rata. Day two you set off at 02.30 ish and it took us 2 hours 15 minutes to the summit. It was freezing so make sure you have a hat, gloves and warm clothes as well as a head torch. The climb to the summit is pretty tough with parts where you are relying on ropes to pull yourself up. It's a great climb but just go at your own pace. The journey back down from the summit took two hours and is awesome as the sun is coming up over the valley below. It then took us two hours from Laban Rata down to the end. Going down was much harder and also really slippery as it had rained so much the night before. An awesome climb, do some training before and bring some chocolate!!"
356,Definately an experience of a lifetime!,"Better to do a 2 day trek. 1 day trek is too difficult to complete, especially with the arbitrarily imposed time limits."
357,Insane in a negative way...,Need this long time break n close to the nature. Bird insects plant wild animals u name it. Oh and fresh air
358,山登り醍醐味を味わう,"First of all we were immensely & pleasantly surprised at the standard of accommodation available to Trekkers/climbers, it lead us into a false sense of security for the days ahead....The registration process was a bit complicated as you bounced from one process to the next however the staff were helpful and all our needs were satisfied. The bedrooms (with communal living area) were basic but more than clean & adequate and well beyond what we expected given the extreme location and circumstances. The following day we checked in with our guide and set of up the challenging mountain with varying weather conditions meeting a wide range of walkers on route! Food and water is supplied at all times, offering a range of simple Malay dishes plus packed lunches for the mountain. you receive a paper voucher system in order to claim your resoective meals.All in all a tough but rewarding experience made better by the facilities at the mountain HQ and the hotel and/or lodge above."
359,"Just visiting, no climbing","I wish I had done this climb earlier as the price difference is huge. But absolutely no regret. It was absolutely worth it when we got to the top. We booked the 2 days 1 night package. Since I'm not in very good shape, to me the climb was difficult but achievable. The highlight of our trip is the Via Ferrata activity, we signed up for the Walk the torq circuit. It was frightening and exhilarating at the same time. I highly recommend adding the walk the torq activity besides the climb. We took the timpohon trail this time since it's our first, definitely will go back for 2nd climb using Mersilau trail."
360,The Climb of a Lifetime!!!,We visited Mount Kinabalu on day tour.  We had a great guide who showed us many different plants while doing a short trail in the park.  We saw the smallest orchid in Borneo (second smallest in the world). Because we were on a tour we only spent a short time in the park. I definitely would have liked to stay longer.
361,Solo Climb Enjoy the Quietness,"My husband and his brother climbed Mt K in one day, they filmed the climb.  They worked hard and said their guide very fantastic!"
362,testing for your physical endurance and mind.,"Now I have failed on higher mountains than this, Island peak and then Elbrus, being tall I cant do altitude, thats my excuse any way. We traveled here with Intrepid travel, the accomodation was good though we did not stay long. The climb is split into 2 legs, the first day is a long slog to the lodge up an uneven path, which is ok, if you struggle on this bit you wil suffer on the next. The accomodation at the lodge is basic if you have a dormitory, but clean and more than adequate, we traveled with a group that were very nearly 'new age' so the room smelled a bit of Tai Chi and Tiger balm. The restaurent is buffet style and there is always a rush at the start of meals. Depending on how well you did the first day will determing how early you start your ascent, I started at 0200, and missed the sunrise by 30 minutes, but at least I finaly summited something, it seems for every year I get older I lose another 250m, 2 items I found essential,first gloves not for the cold but for the ropes and secondly a small bottle of whiskey to celebrate with. Our guides Mr Pinga his son and nephews were excellent, literaly carrying one of our party down. The only down side was the shuttle bus back to centre, ours driver was acranky old git who would not put his paper down for less than 6 people, unless you were young and blond of course, another driver wanted to take us but our git had seniority."
363,Good Hike_But don't book via ferrata in advance,"We booked 1 day non-summit hike. Based on a tour operator's description of the tour (Most suitable for anyone age 10 & above with reasonably good fitness level who wants to have some experience of Mount Kinabalu climb while enjoying the beautiful scenery of this World’s Heritage) we thought it would be more like a pleasant stroll with a guide who would tell you about local flora and fauna. Wrong! Your guide just follows you, probably making sure that  you stay on a trail or don't break your leg. What awaits you is a beautiful scenery and endless stairs. Ascending these various stairs is very difficult but you need even more strength going down - your knees will hurt a lot. I wish we either booked 2 days package or just visit Kinabalu Park.  1 day tour felt like we have not achieved anything."
364,My first mountain climbing experience,"What a time consuming and boring day tour. My family & I strong got the feeling of being cheated!!!!!We woke up early in the morning, 8:30am get on the coach for about 3 hours more. Arrived the Mt Kinabalu tourist centre, taking couple pictures and staying for 30 minutes with nothing to see at all!!! What the purpose we are here?!?!?!?! Totally no clues!!!!Then another 1:30 hour to Poring Hot springs. Gosh~ as we got there, it's 1:00 already! After a terrible lunch the tour guide brought us in the park. Just for the canopy walk! What's wrong with u tour guide? My mom & dad are 60+ with high blood pressure, you haven't explained anything then just asked us to walk up the hill for 30 minutes on a muddy and broken dangerous path to the canopy walk. What's more? I have brought along two little children whom aged 4 & 6 as well. My little one scared to death while he was on the canopy!!!!! How can I carried him on the canopy bridge at this point?????We all are very upset about what's going on with this tour. About 5:00pm we got back to bus and takes 3:30 hours back to Hotel.Whole day bottom stick on the chair on the coach!!! For a 30 minutes nothing to see walk and a scary and terrible canopy walk.Don't ever think of this day tour!!! U will be regretted"
365,Climbing Mt. Kinabalu,"The climb reviews are pretty brutal.My experience of Mount Kinabalu is limited to the breathtaking views from Nabalu, the last township before reaching the mountain. The place offers a peek at the (sometimes elusive) mountain peak - majestic and beautiful!There's a market area as well for essentials, souvenirs and local produce."
366,Great experience,"This trip has been plan by me and my church mate since 4-5 years ago. We engage amazing borneo, their guide was wonderful and helpful. We had survey a lot regarding the climb, first 5km was ok, we make a lot of stop each 500meters, we are a team of 8 so we plan to have a team bonding till the top.from 5.5km onwards to hostel was the most suffer for me. This is when the training for month payout.The sad part is due to climax change, water supply was limited, there is time frame to shower, and there is no heater as well.Second day, 2.30am after breakfast, we take 2 panadol each and electrolic ""boost energy if not mistaken"" and went to the top. Reach top around 5.40am all 8 of us manage to take photo before the sun Fully rise.Stay about 15-20 minute, we take as much photo as we can and start going down. The sun was too bright, although 6.30am. We reach back the hostel at 8.40am had our breakfast again, 10,30am we start climbing down to the starting point. By 1.55pm, i was at the Starting point, my leg has serve his usefulness for the day. GGIts was a great experience and we enjoy a lot. cost of Hiking RM1050, so each km RM110, each step is money and effort. Think of this, go all the way, don't give up. everyone can go.* remember panadol is importance. if possible bring some energy drink, its helps a lot when you had no more energy."
367,Great even if you don't do the big climb,"I've read many reviews before climbing up, here are some info I had difficult to find out. I left from Tympohon Gate with shorts and t-shirt with long sleeves. I kept that up until Laban Rata without being cold (and usually I am always cold). I only had to put my raincoat when it started raining. Rains are common but no one is able to say when they come and how long they will last. First 4km of the trail are relatively ok, lots of stairs of different size (which makes the ascent more difficult). Last 2km before Laban Rata become more challenging. Food and service at Laban Rata is great! I cannot say a single complain. We spent the night at the dormitory. I was a bit afraid of cold as there is no heating but blankets (plus one extra) are very warm and I had no issue with that. I even slept in my pj. On second day I left at 2:45 and especially the first kilometre I had to push myself through the crowd which was slower than me. The trail is narrow all the time. The last 1,5-2km are on the granit. You cannot see much but it is not that dangerous. We were lucky about the weather as no rain on the second day. Long trousers were enough. I left with t-shirt with long sleeve and was gradually adding some extra layers (one fleece jacket + wind jacket). Once the sun got up and I started my descent, I was removing the layers and reached Laban Rata again with t-shirt only. What took me 3hours up (Laban Rata - Low's peak), took me only 1hour down. After a good breakfast we wanted to leave rather sooner than later in order to avoid any possible rain in the afternoon. What took us 5-6hours up from Tympohon Gate to Laban Rata (my boyfriend was slowing me down a bit), took us around 3,5hours down. I confess it was much easier to move in a faster tempo (nearly running) than walking slowly. I felt my quadriceps. The following 36hours after the climb I slept a lot, I barely ate and I had some serious difficulties to take the stairs down :D ... but I don't regret it. The experience was really nice. Great sunset at Laban Rata, amazing sunrise at Low's peak.Shall you have any questions, don't hesitate to drop an email :) I will gladly answer it. Cheers and good luck!!"
368,Unforgettable Experience :),"This is something you should attempt if you are in Sabah and wanting a challenge. I would say the climb was hard (especially the last 2 km after layang layang resting point- I highly recommend stopping there) but it wasn't as 'tough' as my friends who had previously climbed Mt Kinabalu made it out to be. But I am reasonably fitter than them. It took me around 4.5h up to Laban Rata, I was told it normally takes around 5-6 hours. The dinner was quite good, especially when the porters bring everything up but it is very asian orientated. At around 2a you wake up to get ready and have breakfast (basic toast) for the climb to the peak. On the day I went we didn't leave till around 4:15a because of the rain. We got to Lows Peak at around 6:45a and just caught the sunrise. The via ferrata was well worth the experience (took 3 hours). If you are afraid of heights Lows peak isn't for you as there is a part of the climb where the climb up the edge (feels like it is nearly vertical) with only a rope and no safety. You have a second continental breakfast once you reach the rest house again. Then its back down to the bottom, it took me 4 hours to get down with the heavy rain. I think it normally only takes 3 hours. If you know where to step (as in with large steps find the stones which 'break' the step) it isn't too bad on your knee but my thigh was very sore for 3 days. I think this is something you should at least do once but it is quite expensive, would I do it again- undecided. You can organise it yourself but it is so much easier with a tour company."
369,"""Good place to start mount climbing experience""","I had previously climbed Mt Kinabalu four years ago. The experience is pretty amazing and well worth the time and effort, the only thing that still haunts me about this was the price. I paid through the teeth for tour guide only to discover that if I had organised it myself, it would have been a fraction of the price. Fast forward four years and I'm back again to conquer this oversized hill in one day. Turns out that this option is no longer available. So in order to justify my trip, here is the break-down of the prices quoted by the park HQ inside the park if you just rock up there yourself:Accommodation up the mountain: RM100 (without food)Permit for the park: RM100Insurance: RM7Guide: RM150 (this can be split between a max of 3 people)Entrance fee: RM15Optional:Transport to/from start of summit trail: RM17 each way (start of trail is allegedly 4.5km from park HQ) (you could always walk back if you still have any energy left) Food up the mountain: RM130 (includes 3 meals) (you could probably stock up on food in KK if you want to avoid this and you only really need dinner and breakfast on the mountain, you should be back down in time for lunch on day 2)Certificate: RM10Obviously this doesn't include transport to the National Park from KK or elsewhere but there are frequent buses from KK for around RM20. Prices might also vary due to the season.In summary, you could probably climb the mountain for around RM389, assuming you're not sharing the guide, but bringing your own food and walking down to the HQ in the morning. One of the problems with this method is you're unable to book it in advance. Thus getting a free bed for yourself or others is a wee bit of a gamble, but when I was asking about prices there was a bed available most days. There is also some cheap accommodation withing walking distance outside of the park. As a side note, there is lots of amazing trails at the bottom of the park filled with wildlife to explore on your own. All of which are clearly signposted and not too tasking.Enjoy."
370,Once in a lifetime experience!,"We did not climb the mountain but hung around the foothills. It was a nice rolling expanse of land and we were impressed by the number of churches there. Overall, a very rustic and nature-filled experience. But, the town was small and the only air-conned place was Kentucky Fried Chicken!"
371,Breathtaking,"I bet all of you had read about how tedious and physically challenging it is to climb up Mount KK. The first part is full of stairs and steps, and it is really taxing on the knees. It seems like the longest time ever to reach the mid-mountain rest point due to our bodies draining out rapidly. It is really a mind over body activity. Once you reached Pendant hut, you almost can't feel your legs anymore and temperature drops and it is freezing cold to take any shower (no hot water heater though they said there is). Have a quick dinner buffet and then collapsed quickly on beds by 7pm. Gotta wake up at 1am and get ready by 2am to set off to the summit. You can imagine how weak the body is to survive all the way up to the summit in the middle of the night. This part of the climb is not any easy and certain points are rather dangerous where you are almost walking alongside the cliff walls. By 6am, most people will reached the summit and enjoy the sunrise over the horizon. The feeling of greatness is beyond words. You have to do it for yourself and you will be personally so touched by your own achievement. The journey down all the way to base camp is a pain. Your legs are really painful and weak by now. However, you will constantly be amazed over what you had covered and conquered. It may seems suffering but it will be one of those achievement that you remembered for life."
372,Challenging but definitely worth a try!,I've actually completed the trek/Hike up in 2010 but have never did a review. so here is a short one.It starts with very painful and agonizing walk up countless of steps. but you will be rewarded with a very beautiful view up the peak should there be a clear sky. did not expect such a cold temperature and there exist such a beautiful scenery in Malaysia. i still think of it every now and then.
373,Unforgetable,"if you have more than 3 days to spend it would be enough (climb the mountain) or just go and take some photo around there, the mountain. if it not rain it will be best"
374,Beautiful mountain,"You can just do the base walk if you do not wish to tackle the Climb, it takes about an hour."
375,I didnt like it.,"This was my first mountain to climb and I have to say it wasn't easy.You start with a 6km climb up the steep stairs and rocks. There are signs every 500m and also shelters to rest. Took us 5,5hrs!Once you get to the lodge (3200m), get a table at the balcony for watching the sunset later - there was no rain and the view was spectacular.After 2am you begin the climb to the summit (4095m) and with a bit of luck you can watch sunrise from there.Don't underestimate the return trip! 6km down the rocks after having spent the whole day climbing is tough (3hrs 45mins).Our mountain guide, Claudius, was excellent - always cheerful and supportive with a nice words to say to everyone.BOOKING:We booked everything on the day! Sutera offices at Kinabalu park open at 7am so we tried our luck. As January is a low season, we had no problems whatsoever. They have an office in KK as well. We spent the previous night at a hostel that's walking distance from the park also without pre booking (there are a few). COSTS:Park entrance: RM15Climbing (incl.accommodation & 5 meals): RM350 - low season discount which they won't mention unless you ask!Permits: RM100Insurance: RM7Guide: RM150 (shared cost)Transportation within the park: RM17 each way (shared cost)The experience is worth the cost. Do come prepared though - it's harder than it seems!"
376,Challenging yet overwhelming experience,"My girlfriend and I booked a two day climb with the VIA Ferrata included on the way down through Amazing Borneo tours.We were picked up from our hotel in K.K. and taken straight out to the park. The bus driver arranged all of our passes and our mountain guide. We then walked for several long hours up the mountain through the pouring rain. I'm told it always rains on the lower part of the mountain. I suggest wrapping everything inside your bag in garbage bags even if your pack has a rain cover. The rain cover is not enough trust me! Nothing worse than getting to the cabin and all of your spare clothing is wet. We arrived at the hut in the early afternoon, the staff were really nice and helped us get settled in. We left very early the next morning and completed the climb up the mountain. There is nothing like getting there at sunrise, it was amazing.We then descended to the 8km mark where we started the 3-4 hour low's peak VIA Ferrata. I wouldn't recommend doing it unless you have a fair bit of stamina as doing it after the climb is hard! We had an amazing Ferrata guide named John. My girlfriend really wasn't comfortable with the heights but John was brilliant with her. He provided advice, jokes and some music. The experience wouldn't have been the same without him. The effort was well worth it as the views were so much better than on the summit. We had an great time."
377,Challenging but worth it!,"I booked the tour through Amazing Borneo. A Great company. This will be for a two day tour which will include all your transport to the mountain and back to the city, your overnight accommodation, all food, minimal water, your guide and climbing permit. The first day was quite a tough climb. We trekked about 6km, up through the clouds to Laban Rata. The Laban Rata people fed us with good food before we call it a night. We crash early and we were up again at 1am for our dawn hike. This was a really tough climb. There was only 3km from Laban Rata to the top, it was dark and some sections were so steep you needed a rope to pull yourself up. I got to the peak, tired but satisfied. Then the long walk down Mt Kinabalu. Do get a good leg massage or check in to a good hotel after the climb to reward yourself. It's a perfect way to end a rather exhausting climb.All the best!"
378,Hardest yet greatest thing I've ever done,"Mount Kinabalu was the first mountain we climbed and it was an incredible experience. You need to be a little fit to be able to climb and summit before sunrise, but the hike is very doable. Bring warm clothes as it is very cold at night but also have a light shirt underneath as you will get sweaty and warm during your walk. We were lucky it didn't rain but I suggest you bring waterproof clothes. Very important to bring warm gloves, not only because it freezing cold near the top but you will need to use ropes to climb and the gloves will protect your hands. Make sure you have water and snacks for the road, as you will need the extra energy. You will get a guide that will walk with you, he knows a lot about the area and the different vegetation, make sure to ask him lots of questions. You get to experience different types of nature, depending on the heights you reach.The camp is super basic and there is no hot water, but there is nothing more refreshing than an ice cold shower right. The food is really good, especially the breakfast that is waiting for you once you come back to camp after you have reached the top. The views from the top at sunset are spectacular. Its is truly an amazing experience that is difficult to explain. You get such a sense of achievement that is unbelievable. Make sure you bring a camera!Do it!!"
379,Tips for climbing Mount Kinabalu,"The entire journey (summit and descent) was incredibly challenging but absolutely worth it! To be honest, it was the hardest physical challenge in my life to descend the mountain. We were very lucky to have good weather at the summit and the entire experience is highly dependent on the weather.Day 1: We started at 9am and reached the lodge at 2pm. This part of the hike is challenging and consists of what feels like 1000 staircases with some flat walking areas.Day 2: We woke up at 1:30 am and ate breakfast. We departed for the summit around 2:45 am and it took about 3 hours to reach the peak. Then it took another 3 hours to descend and reach the lodge at around 8:45 am. Afterwards, we had to descend back to the original starting point and that can take an additional 3 to 5 hours depending on your knees and remaining strength. We departed the lodge at close to 11:00 am and arrived at the bottom at 4:00 pm. The descent is not to be underestimated! Recommendations: 1. Bring hiking poles for the descent. 2. Bring earplugs and a sleeping mask for the overnight stay3. Have a waterproof backpack cover and rainjacket/poncho and/or umbrella4. Warm clothes for the 3am 2nd day climb are an absolute must!5. Bring gloves for the summit6. Headlamp is a must for the summit7. Don't forget snacks!"
380,Sacred Pilgrimage,"We are in our late 50s - but were lucky to pick perfect weather to climb up to Lowes Peak & watch a beautiful sunrise. Approx 20 hrs of very solid trekking with very little sleep - walking from about 2500' ASL to over 10,000' and then down again. It was lucky we trained before we went and also that we were healthy. The pain in our legs for a few days after was totally worth it."
381,Great place to hiking,"An adventurous climb. Love its natural greens, its cooling temperature reduces the stress of reaching."
382,Go hike and experience the summit,"We hiked a few of those trails in the park and loved them. There are 10 trails to explore with different length and difficulty. You can get a map which describes the trails in the information office.Beside hiking on your own they offer a guided walk, Botanical Garden (guided), Video Show and Kinabalu Natural History Gallery. All those activities have extra fees beside the RM 15 entrance fee to the park (foreigner fee). We had lunch at the Balsam Buffet Restaurant within the park. We can not recommend the place. It was RM 38 p.P."
383,difficult and rewarding,"Everyone should touch nature every now and then, this is a great place for it. Did not climb to the peak but enjoyed the trails around the park entrance"
384,Expensive,"the national park restricts the number of permits so best to book in advance, we had a lot of trouble 3 months out finding a weekend, we instead we had to walk it during the week. We made all our arrangements through Malaysia.com tourism, they were helpful they sorted everything out and paying in advance is good because it avoids stuffing around with monies when in the park. We arrived late in the evening and stayed at shangri la hotel in Kota Kinabalu. Clean, quiet, air conditioned and close to food. We got picked up next morning, 2 plus hour car trip to national park. We meet our guide and got passes sorted. First day the climb was really pleasant and not overly difficult. Reached Laban rata guesthouse in early afternoon. Accomodation was basic with bunk beds ( we stayed in 4 to a room) however it was clean and food was decent. The tempreature drops in evening and there is no heating so pack comfortable warm clothes. Next morning up at 2 am for little snack and start climbing to peak weather was very cold (3 degrees) it takes a couple of hours to reach the peak for sunrise. Fabulous view from the peak but physically challenging. Afterwards head down the mountain back to Laban rata for breakfast followed by base of mountain. There are plenty of water tanks along the way to fill up your water bottle.recommend to pack a good rain jacket and double bag your clothes, it poured for a couple of hours while we were trekking and it is nice to have dry clothes to change into. Recommend to pack snacks for decent because it can take several hours to reach the base and Laban rata only provide you with breakfast. Also recommend walking pole/s particularly for for going down the mountain as it tough on your knees. Reaching the peak is physically challenging but it feels great to know I conquered the mountain! It took me a couple to walk comfortably after the climb, it was physically taxing on my legs and knees."
385,Heaven amongst 2 days of hell,"It was tiring but AWESOME... Such a great challenge and experience in life! We were lucky to reach the peak on time to view the sunrise (so beautiful), as there was not rain and the cloud was clear (its not easy to find such good weather at the peak).Here my two cents....Be prepared yourself before you climb the peak....First thing first, you need exercise and training to get fit and good stamina. The 1st challenge is going up to Laban Rata from the KK National Park - Remember less oxygen the higher up you go, so reserve your energy that can help you to continue your climb the next day. Don't rush, don't challenge others or don't panic when you face some difficulties - Just climb according to your pace, stay focus and believe you can do it!  Energy drink and energy bar may help. At Laban Rata - Don't expect you have a wonderful bed, service etc.. like a vacation hotel. This is mostly a place for climbers to stay a night or two to rest and recharge their energy in order to continue with their 2nd climb to the peak. You may consider to stay 2 nights to have more rest, enjoy the weather and natural scenery here.  The air is getting thiner, so even the fittest can encounter discomfort or altitude sickness - Some climbers vomite, fever, drowsy etc. In any such situation like this, seek doctor advice. Do not continue the climb!The 2nd challenge is reaching the peak from Laban Rata - The climb starts about 2-2.30am. So, you need to have dinner and rest much earlier. Most climbers getting weaker towards the peak - An experience and good mountain guide knows how to overcome this through right breathing and walking/climbing methods, lead you to better path etc... even motivate and support you along the way!  However, the guide will stop you if the situation is getting worst, and bring you down/back to the laban rata or park. The final challenge is climbing back down - You need to be careful as it is not as easy as you think!Knee support guide will definitely help.I suggest you visit and stay a night at the ""hot spring"" after the climb to relax and enjoy the natural hot water and forest scenery! Some helpful tips:-1. Starts from Timpohon Gate - Shorter climb and short time. But more challenge with higher slope.2. Starts from Mesilau Trail -  Farther distance and longer climb. But lesser slope and nicer scenery.3. Climbing Glove is helpful for certain spots during the climb.4. Book the trip much earlier especially during the peak - May-Jul. And find room with heater and hot water.. as not all hostle has the facilities.5. Find out more information and necessities for the climb.6. Rain coat is needed and prepare ""back-up"" shirts in case you get wet.7. Water proof cover or water proof bag as it always rain on the way. Otherwise, all your necessity will get wet.8. Don't be surprise - cheap rubber shoes is more comfortable and better for the climb to the peak rather that the expensive hiking shoe - you can get it easily at the KK town ( it cost less than RM8).9. Muscle relief pills may need for you to continue the climb, as you may discover pain - muscle and/or join.10. Most people get a blood blister under their big toe nail - make sure you cut your toenails, have correct fitting footwear and a good/proper tactic walking down the mountain. 11. Good and reliable travel guide/agency that can advise you do and don't12. Experience and good mountain guide is important!"
386,A Must Visit Mountain,"So it's not a strol in the park but is definitely do-able if you have a moderate level of fitness.   It's a beautiful climb and the views from the top are just spectacular.   Be warned, as so common in Asia, when it rains it goes for it.  The guides we had were fab and so helpful.   The hut was much nicer and cleaner than I had expected."
387,Mount Kinabalu on a budget,"This is what you will be mostly doing if you decide to climb. It is not very difficult physically, but what made it a disappointment for us is that the trail is not the one you can take and look around to enjoy the views. You have to follow the trail. Otherwise you may easily break you leg. I've been to Kilimanjaro and Nepal, and those were much more exhausting experience. But it was very rewarding for the views, and everyday changes in nature, and surroundings. Here you just go up and down in one and a half days, and you hardly understand why the hell you needed it."
388,A place you must see,Well worth the trip to get a good view of the mountain and it's lush surroundings. Very tranquil and a wonderful photo opportunity.
389,I am a mountain climber now!,"It's a hard climb, but once you done it, it is definately worth it! To Laban rata it's almost only staires, and then to the summit it is also a rope section which is quite hard! Bring warm clothes in a plasticbag to the summit, as it is very cold up there!"
390,Amazing and do-able for everyone,"I did this trip with my 16 year old daughter and we loved it. The climb was tougher than I expected as the guide books had said it required a moderate degree of fitness...? It was well worth the effort though, and although my daughter didn't say so at the time she now looks back and is glad she did it. The stay at the hostel was an experience in itself, good hearty food though, just what you need. Sunrise was beautiful. What an amazing country, so full of contrasts - mountain climbing in snow gear one day, crashing through tropical rainforest the nest and lying on a sun drenched beach the next..great !!"
391,Views to die for,"We decided to climb this majestic mountain last year, and have been preparing for 6 months. Training is essential even for a fit-looking hiker. We decided on Mesilau trail which is 2 km longer than Timpohon. I personally preferred Mesilau as the scenery changes every now and then with breathtaking views to keep you motivated. Timpohon are more of jungle trekking for 4 hours, with endless steps that I thought to be horrifying and tiring.From Mesilau (1,900m) to Laban Rata (3,272m) is a 8.2 km hike. Jungle trekking in the beginning, few river crossings, tree root steps, some build in wood plank stairs, and vegetation is visible through out the whole hike. Which some other foreign hikers informed us that it is actually surprising to see the amount of plants at that altitude in comparison to the Alps. We had our pack lunch as part of the package with Sutera Nature Lodge, which consist of a set of sandwich and an apple. Lunch was scheduled at 5 km point. After that there's an abundance of pitcher plants, and even wild raspberries which are edible and they are tasty. Our guide advised me to take paracetamol after lunch to prevent altitude sickness, and I am really glad I listened to him. In fact, he was my main motivator throughout this hike. Both trails eventually meet at 5.2 km point (Altitude: 2,745m), and 2km away from Laban Rata. This last 2 km, was unexpectedly tough for me, perhaps, lack of view and endless uneven rocky steps all the way up to the lodging. The view of Laban Rata was extremely welcoming after a long day's hike. Food and supplies is at exorbitant price as all the supplies are brought up manually by porters who had to carry extremely heavy load up the trail on daily basis. Dinner is usually included in hiking package where local dishes are served in buffet style. Dinner is served between 4.30-7.30 pm only. Hence, if you reached later than that time, you will have to pay for your food.After dinner, it is advisable to rest as soon as possible as the next hike will start at 2.30 a.m. During our stay there, hot shower was not available. Therefore, be prepared to not shower as its extremely cold  (2-10 degree celcius) at night. Sleeping time was indeed precious as we need to recharged for the last push to the peakAt 1.30am, everyone will wake up for supper/breakfast for the final hike an hour later. Do prepare sufficient clothing as the temperature at the peak is around 0-2 degree Celcius. The distance from Laban Rata to Low's peak is 2.7 km. Gloves with good grip is needed as there will be a section of roping along the granite (300m long) which is extremely dangerous if you are not careful. There will be a final checkpoint at 1.0km point where hikers need to show their tags as the proof. Last 1.0 km will be hike on granite with guiding rope. While it is not as dangerous as the previous section, the strong cold wind can be very intimidating. My condition was really bad at that time that my guide had to give me his windbreaker to keep me warm. Sunrise on the peak is between 5.30am - 5.45am. It is important not to reach too early as it is freezing cold. After 3.5 hours, I reached the peak and took the only picture with the sign to proof my achievement. 2-3 mins is all you have as there are huge throngs of hikers that gathers around the sign. After that, it is time to head back to Laban Rata for breakfast before heading down. Checkout has to be done before 10.30am or else, there will be extra charges.Many has said that the trip down is the hardest part, as your legs will be exhausted by now. Hiking stick is helpful to reduce the impact on your knees and ankles. Knee guards and ankle guards is essential for many to reduce the chances of injury. The journey down will take roughly 3 - 4 hours depending on your fitness level. Best piece of advise is to go slow and easy as it can be a living hell for some.My hike down was easier than the trip up, and it took roughly 3 hours to reach Timpohon gate. After checking out at the counter, we were transported back to Kinabalu Park HQ to collect out certificates which is 10 minutes drive away.To sum up the whole experience:- Tough but awesome hike for normal people like me. Fit hikers can do the 1 day hike to the peak.- Guides are extremely helpful and friendly, remember to listen to their advise.- Do not pack too much as the weight will weigh you down on the hike. There are options of course, where you can hire porters to carry your luggage (RM 10-15/kg). - Bring your camera with handful of batteries - Planning is important in the whole trip to save your pockets from burning. This is some place that I will definitely come back to hike even though I am still suffering from the muscle soreness as I am writing this."
392,The Lowes peak circuit via Ferrata is a thrill!,"I had a fantastic experience climbing mt kinabalu.I agree with a previous review, this is not as easy as some make out. I am a fit 30yr old, with little mountaining experience. The first day was good, lots of stairs though. Altitude was ok, but it did make it a bit tough to sleep at night.The second morning - climb to the summit, started with us at the back of the pack. Expect traffic jams for the first 30 mins, but it clears after that, so don't get frustrated. There are always the odd person that refuses to pull over, but you get that everywhere.I must admit it did catch me by surprise the ropes, and when you shine your flashlight down it looked quoted daunting when you could see the ground! certainly got the blood pressure up! But when the sun came up, it wasn't as bad as I had thought.I had a great group, we all booked individually, and had all been fed the line 'your the last in this group' etc etc. I had quotes ranging from 1000 to 1500 ringit from several different tour operators for the same thing.Some climbers seemed to have organised everything separately, ie tour guide and accom. I would recommend this, as then you know what you are getting. Unfortunately, our group had different paces so made it a bit stop start, but they were great so didnt detract on the day at allThe accommodation has no muesli bars, only chocolate, so suggest you stock up!There were a few dads that took their young boys. The only one I saw post, suffered heavy altitude sickness. Maybe a bit tough an event if you want to do the early morning sunrise."
393,definitely a nice getaway,I did my first climb to the summit on 2008 and now again on April 2019. Mesilau Trail on the first and Timpohon now. Both equally good. The hike to laban rata took me 4.5 hours and it was challenging especially the final 2km after lunch stop. The hike to the summit at 2.30am was different from my first hike. Its longer and tougher now. It should be due to the earthquake on 2018. Awesome experience. Highly recommended. Kudos the the guides.
394,exhausting but great trip,On the day we went to see KK mountain it was clear with blue skies and we saw everything in its glory. Fantastic stop over on the way down the mountain to taste wild boar as cooked by the locals
395,A Must Climb,"Firstly, I climbed this mountain in September 2012, with a friend. I booked through Amazing Borneo Tours. I still remember exchanging emails and phone calls with Walter and his friendly staff from the tour agency. The tour was very well conducted, no complaints there. I remember too our mountain guide, Petrus, and the porter, a lady (I think she was Petrus's wife). Both quiet, gentle people who helped us make that climb. Difficult? Not really. Certainly very tiring, but safe if you follow the rules and listen to the guides. Stick to the path, don't wander, don't desecrate. In short, respect the mountain. Just after the highest checkpoint, I became very drowsy and had an immense desire to lie on the rocks and snooze. Altitude sickness had kicked in despite taking Acetazolamide. Petrus waited patiently behind me while I made the ascent, stopping briefly every 10-15 steps. I reached the summit 15 minutes after my friend. My descent later was fast, this time the porter stayed with me, while Petrus stayed back with my friend. When we returned from our trip, friends teased us with statements like ""well, if you guys made it up there, it must have been an easy climb"". My answer would always be the same...""actually, you could die up there in that mountain"". Since my climb, I've developed a fondness for Mt. Kinabalu. A sceptic at first, my trip up the mountain made me feel that it could indeed be the realm of mystical, powerful spirits. I continued to follow-up on recent developments in Mt. Kinabalu, and grieved when a tourist died there in February 2014.This may not be the right forum to bring up what I have to say next, but I've long since given up on Facebook and other forms of social media. My mild surprise on hearing news of the earthquake in Sabah turned into anxiety when I heard that climbers were trapped on the summit of Mt. Kinabalu. Still, I knew the summit was a large plateau, and the 200-odd climbers would be safe there. I was horrified the next morning when I heard that some climbers were killed during their descent. My initial impression was that the fatalities would have occurred along the via ferrata. News trickling in from the Malaysian media suggests that some descending climbers were also hit by boulders just before the highest check-point, Sayap-Sayap Hut. It's now more than 48 hours since the first quake, and the Ranau district has experienced several aftershocks. There were 3 this morning alone, 2 measuring more than 3.5 on the Richter scale. I was also surprised to hear that 40 years ago, Ranau was rocked by an earthquake of similar magnitude, but with no incidents in Mt. Kinabalu. The route to the summit is no longer passable, and all mountain routes will be CLOSED to climbers for at least 3 weeks. Clearance work has already commenced to re-establish old trails. My heart filled with sorrow when I heard that a total of 19 climbers and guides were killed, a significant number of whom were children. Heroic tales of guides risking life and limb to rescue climbers come as no surprise to me, I would expect no less of them. SAR teams are trying their best to bring everyone back. Sadly, some may remain interred forever on the mountain. My prayers are with them and their families. May the Aki watch over them."
396,Conquer the Summit!!,Actly no any early idea to go there..but coz of my business plan cancel we just move from town to tis plc....

397,Great views at the top,"There are 11 members join this trip. The trip took place on June'13. This was my 2nd attempt to climb the highest mount in Malaysia. My 1st attempt was completely failed because of bad weather and physical condition (not fit). We took 3d 2n package whereby we had to stay at kinabalu park for the 1st night, gain some energy and had a good sleep before the big challenge tomorrow. On the next morning after had a quite light breakfast, the van took us to somewhere near Kudasang. The start point is totally not located in Kinabalu Park. It is about 3km from Kinabalu Park. At the first place we thought that Mesilau trail is easier trail than timpohon but it is not true, the trail required your physical and psychology strength. The distance to Laban Rata is 8km compare to timpohon trail which only 6km. On the way up our team has been separated, I'm the last one together with one more guy, the others were speed like a bullet and reached Laban Rata in about 5 hours only, I reached Laban Rata 5 minute before 7pm, it took about 10 hours, luckily there was no rain and we safely gathered at Laban Rata to take another step to the peak. We started our mission in next morning at 2.30am, it was dark and head lamp is required, we were line up in one row towards sayat-sayat hut, the temperature is very cold, 0-4 celcius.The oxygen is very thin and we get tired very easy. I checked in at sayat-sayat hut at 5.30 am and have 30 minutes before the sun arise. From sayat-sayat, I can see the south peak, that is the peak printed at the back of Malaysia's one ringgit note. But my mission is to step my foot at top of low's peak so I have to walk across the south peak, it was a very tiring and longest distance ever, I took almost 1 hour to reach at the bottom of low's peak, there is another task to be done, to reach the low's peak we need to climb another 100m up. It is so worth it, I manage to reach low's peak and I'm very proud because all the members managed to reach the low's peak, well done guys. After enjoy the beautiful view we start to decent to Laban Rata, after had our breakfast, we start walking down to timpohon gate, the journey is quite challenge, all the muscle is starting to pain. I don't to wait anymore, I pushed myself and I'm the 2nd person who reached the timpohon gate and I took about 3hours. Well done to meIf someone who interested to climb kinabalu, my advice is take timpohon trail do not take mesilau trail, trust me....."
398,Spectacular climb,"Climbed Mt K with our fit family, children aged 10 and 13. The climb itself is manageable, but the altitude can affect even the fittest, as we discovered after about 4 hours. Daughter took another 2 hours to finish the last 1.5 kms as she struggled to get enough oxygen and started to suffer from altitude sickness.Made it to Laban Rata, only to find that our accommodation was another 10 minute climb ( a lot when youre exhausted and vomiting). Were kept awake half the night by inconsiderate people staying in the lodge- loud voices in the middle of the night when you only get about 4 hours sleep anyway before being woken up to climb to the summit.Surprised to find Laban Rata provided great food and even a bar, as everything is carried up by porters. buy water up there as you cant trust the tap water.Two of family made it to top and loved it- bit slippery in the rain so take shoes with good grip. No photo opportunities as its usually only clear 2 or 3 times a week."
399,CLIMB,"Surprisingly less challenging than expected for 2 very fit people, a lot of up & down traffic and traffic jams On the very narrow paths on the way up, a horrible night's sleep thanks to 2 very annoying & disrespectful room mates, very cold and windy at the top BUT(!) great guide, beautiful jungle, good food, friendly staff at Labanrata (lodge on the mountain), great leg exercise, and the view at the top is AMAZING!!! All in all, more than worth it!"
400,One of the best climbs in South East Asia if you take the Via Ferrata,"The climb organisation started a few months earlier. We booked the climb through a company named Amazing Borneo and they were indeed amazing. They picked us at the hotel by 06:30hrs. Insisted on getting our passports, even though we had scanned them a copy earlier. We reached the base at 08:15. We signed in and given an id to be with us till return and then served as a momento. We were driven to the start of our epic journey. We scanned our id and with back packs and bottles of water started our trek. Our local guide was Janus. No foreigner is allowed to climb without a local guide. The trek involves a climb to the Laban Rata hut, which is the guest house where we stayed overnight. It is only 6km from the start. The start is at an altitude of about 1500m. The path is mainly granite and mud with wooden stairs as needed. The climb is steep and relentless. The first 4 km went by with my heart pounding and catching up with my friend usually about 10 minutes ahead of me and my guide usually a couple of steps behind me. It was a slow and steady slog. We stopped at all the rest places which were a km apart. We had lunch at 4 km stop. The weather was very kind and pleasant but I believe it’s not unusual to be raining all the way through or boiling hot. Lunch was a boiled egg, cheese sandwich, fried chicken, an apple, biscuit and water. After demolishing it and regaining some strength we started on the last 2km. The climb is steep relentless and unforgiving to anyone who has not trained. We finally made it in 5 hours and boy were we glad to see the hut. We were given the key to our room. We shared a bunk bed and there were 3 other such beds in the room. The view of Mount Kinabalu was amazing and beneath us we could see the clouds floating away in the distance. We were given a towel and even though there was supposed to be hot water, we showered in freezing water. Guessing the top 4 get the water heated by solar cells. Dinner was served at 16:30 and we were famished with a slight headache. Plenty of water, tea etc to drink. We were finished by 5:30 and in bed by 6.  There were 2 other couples who were in our room. The heavens opened up about 7. Thunder and lightning followed and stopped about 11. We were reminded that if weather was bad, no one goes up. Woke up at 1:30, after a brush and wash, we had a quick bite and started the big push. We wore a beanie, warm clothing in layers and rain proof poncho and the head torch. The climb was different with the torch. A lot of wooden stairs to start with. This is a near vertical climb up. There were places where we had a white rope and you climb up the mountain with it. A ranger check point at 7 km. There is gentle path up for about 200m while walking through some stunning scenery including “donkeys ears”. The final 250m is like an assault course. We made it at 05:40. We waited for sunrise. It was already getting bright by then and the scenery unfolding in front of us seemed to be like an empty canvas that was being painted upon. Glittering lights of Kinabalu far down below which suddenly vanished when the sun cake our. The clouds entwining the mountain and some looked like they had been impaled by the sharp mountain top. Every one of us went up that mountain for a reason. I hope they found what they came for. The sense of achievement, scenery, labour and toil certainly inspired us and we spoke about our next trek then and there. We descended to the hut by 08:30, breakfast. Food was excellent. There was bread, rice, noodles, fruits tea and coffee. Food was awesome at 3272m. Pit stop rest and we set off down the mountain. The first km was fine and then fatigue set in my thighs. Even though willing it, my muscles would not listen to me. With 2 sticks in hand, I made it down in 5 hours. The average is 3 and a half. The rain came pouring down, it did cool me down and that helped. I cannot emphasise enough how much I struggled to get down. Sheer will power, and not wanting to be stranded got me down. Lack of preparation I am sure played a big part. Funnily, I had not lost my sense of humour even though my legs were on fire. 2 days later, I still am not confident walking down steps. I learnt a lot about myself on this journey but I learnt more to respect this awesome mountain. It may not be that high, but it is still a hard tricky mountain. You may not get the opportunity to see the top due to bad weather. Coming down is probably the worst.  Practice or perish but it’s an amazing journey. Hope you enjoy yours. I know I did mine."
401,its a memorable expierence,"My son had his term break for about 10 days and we climbed Mt. Kinabalu, that is my husband, my 6 and a half year old son and me. I had to make my booking sometime in January this year as only a limited number allowed into the park to climb. The track from the Mt. Kinabalu Park to Laban Rata (3,272M/10,735 feet), which is the base camp is 6km. Throughout the climb my son suffered from altitude illness. To top it all, it rained and we had to climb the last one kilometer to Laban Rata in the dark.My son impressed me with his perseverance and endurance. We reached Laban Rata at 8pm. Had to hit the sack after a quick meal as I had to be up by 2 am to climb to the peak. The 2.72 km climb to the peak was challenging and a little scary as we were climbing in the dark with only our head lights for illumination and over some sheer rock surfaces. I was a little scared at times and was glad that I did not drag my 6 and a half year along as I do not think that he is physically matured enough for the climb to the peak 4,095.2M/13,435.7ft).I was rewarded by the most awesome sunrise ever and fabulous view. I was blessed as it was a clear day and no threat of rain.The climb down was of course excruciating as I did not train before the climb.Mt. Kinabalu is one of the easiest to climb. The path is well marked out.It is a well kept park. Sabahans keep their island clean and beautiful and are proud of their heritage. They are such nice people and I enjoyed my stay even in the city, Kota Kinabalu. Stayed at Sutera Beach Hotel which was absolutely beautiful and comfortable.There is a lot to see and do in Kota Kinabalu. I had but a couple of days and my aching body limited my activities.However, the Mari Mari Cultural Centre is a must and snorkling at the islands. I missed a ride on a steam train through some villages and the Timpohon springs and etc...Hopefully there will be another time!Should you come to Malaysia, do set aside time for Sabah and even Sarawak, it is absolutely beautiful."
402,Harder than I thought!,"The Mount Kinabalu climb is fantastic and wonderfully rewarding. It is a 'must do' walk for anyone looking for a challenge. For me I found it tougher than other major treks I have undertaken (Mt Rinjanai, The Inca Trail, UK three peaks) but I am reliably informed it is not a patch on Kilimanjaro. What made it a particular challenge for me was the altitude sickness that hit me very low down at 2200m which made the first day very tough indeed. That said my wife was not affected at all by the altitude even on the summit but found the very rough terrain and constant relentless upwards pull very tough on the knees. Good walking shoes with strong grips are a must, not trainers or pumps as the soles are too thin and the rough track will bruise your feet very quickly. We did the two day one night trip. You start at 1800m and reach Laban Rata after 6km and 1500m climb. The first day is tough with the last 2km being the steepest and roughest. The base camp is surprisingly well equipped seeing as *everything* has to go via porter. Also if you have a Celcom sim card you get excellent mobile phone and 3g coverage. You start day 2 at 2am after breakfast and make for the summit. Make sure you take plenty of warm clothes. It starts at 5 degrees centigrade and gets a lot colder on top with a wicked wind chill. After sunrise it does warm up quickly and you may need sunblock for the descent as the sun is very strong. Photography wise there is very little in the way of wildlife anywhere on the hike although the views you get while descending from the summit are superb. Make sure you have a wide angle lens to do them justice. After breakfast you make the 6km decent back down which is very tough on the ankles, knees and hips. A stout pole is recommended. A great trek well worth the effort for the amazing rewards."
403,Summit closure due to bad weather.,"It was our 2nd attempt to climb in May 2012. The first time was in 2010, I did not do enough study on the whole trip, ended up sick at Leban Rata. Can't continue on the next day. But this time, I hiked everyday rain or shine for 2 months. And I did it together with my husband. Just share what I did. We arrived in Kota Kinabalu around 4pm, rented a car self drive to the Park. Reach the park around 6.30pm due to heavy rain. Had a good rest that night. 2nd day was a big day. After breakfast headed to Timpohon gate around 9am. We started our amazing journey. The weather was good to us. Our 2 friend came along but 1 was left behind and I need to accompany her. Do remember if you are going to bring friends along, do make sure them are as same speed as you. Our belonging was with our mountain guide. At that time it was 1kg RM8. I carry my camera and small beg pack with water and some energy bar. My husband carry some rain coat,glove and some medication and my tripod and also pack lunch box and some cloths for changing. Do remember to drink water on your way up and finish your lunch box too, so that you do not need to carry it. 1km away from Leban Rata, my friend's husband was there, and I ask him to wait for her as I saw that she was not feeling well. My husband and me went ahead, it started pouring. We put on rain coat and continue for 30 minute. We saw the hut, but we still need to hike up to get the keys from the reception which was 300 meters away. No problem, did that. The restroom was outside and no heater. We need to boiled hot water to take a bath. By the time we did that, our friend still can't be seen. Later they joined us at the hut. Dinner served at 5pm, later was heavy pouring. I was affair that we may not be able to hike to the peak. But thank God, the weather was good. I woke up 2am to prepare myself for the hike, the sky was clear and I can see the stars and moon. We had a light meal before our hike at 2.30am. Then the journey began, on stairs. We do need the head light as it was dark. Can't see anything ahead of us, just follow the people that was ahead of us. We reach the gate of Sayat-sayat check point, where we need to show them our pass. and continue to hike for 1 more kilometer. I saw a lot of people turning back, lack of proper wearing. It was about 4-10 degree Celsius at that time. As I hike, the high altitude sickness started to hunt me. But I manage to finish it and step on the peak.Do remember to eat this time, the 2.7km is much difficult than the 6km hike. After taking photo, we need to start going down for breakfast. Pack our cloths and check out before 11am. It was raining all the way down. Reach the base at 3.30pm. Register ourselves and buy the certificate of achievement. Ended our amazing journey."
404,Short visit,"Me and my girlfriend decided to climb Mount Kinabalu last minute and got the last two spots for the dates we wanted. We’re not exactly athletes but we train 4-5 times a week so are generally pretty fit but still found it hard going. Day 1 feels like a slog, especially the last few hundred metres but the summit climb on day 2 is physically harder, especially as it’s dark and you’re tired from little sleep & day one’s exploits. For all the effort, the payoff is well worth it as the sunrise and view from the summit is insane. The whole trip is pretty well organised and our man Wilson who guided us the whole way up and down was top class. For anyone with a pair of lungs, this should be on your to do list. For anyone coming straight from the couch, maybe go for a few walks round the park and then get it booked."
405,"VERY Hard, but worth it for the view!",only down side is long drive each way. organised trips are available.long drive up mountain roads and can be off putting if you do not like hights
406,WOW!!,"It took me 21 hours (2 days 1 night) to be at 4,062.6m above sea level, Malaysia First Heritage Site. 6km to the Laban Rata Resthouse and 2.5km to the summit. Back and fro make it 17km. Some part are absolutely steep that I can poke my nose into it. The longest hike I ever been to after Mount Fuji 3,776m. I took longer time to reach due to altitude problem, I guess after all I am just a hooman being that belong to the ground.Hiking Mount Kinabalu is not a joke, you need to physically prep yourself which I don't. Basically I stop exercise after my shoulder injuries (7 months ago) Thanks to my teammate Jane, Mak and Issac -the caring ones. They can't help me to finish walking the 17km, they absolutely the reason why I go for the summit.Thanks to those passerby who are kind to share me their stories and how to hike with less energy, or keep me accompany when I am way behind my team due to altitude problem. Go at your own pace, you will see different things.Thanks to the nature, provide the best weather thought-out 21 hours of hike. The tree trunk and rocks are gentlemen enough to assist my elevation and decent. I must say this trail is clean and well maintain. Hardly see rubbish laying in the ground. Overall I like it. Time to prepare for my next hike."
407,Good place for mountain hiking,"Many companies travel companies in KK help last minute travellers, just stay one night there, go around and check. Ask your hotel about an orange building where they all are located. It will cost around 1300-1600 MYR. The trick is to find accommodation at the Basecamp, there are 2 companies who have the monopoly there (one is Sutera Sanctuary, SSL(private and superexpensive) and Sabah National park, SNP (government and 1/3 of the price). They are just 50 m away from each other. You can’t climb Mt. Kinabalu if you haven’t reserved any room on the mountain (Laban Rata(SSL) or Lemaing Hostel (SNP). Camping on the mountain is not allowed, neither is a Day Climb.It is VERY easy to do your own climb: find a number/mail (as it changes all the time) to the Sabah National Park and book the accommodation at the basecamp through them. They will provide you even with the pass, and a guide if you wish. If not, having an accommodation booked at the Basecamp, just show up at the Park HQ and within 30 min they will match you/add you to some group.The prices, in MYR as per June 2016 for international climbers:Room at the basecamp: SSL - 700, at LH - 200Room at the NP - from 50 and up, there are MANY, check!Climb permit - 500Guide - 200-250 for a small group. Porter - 13/kg weight, its so much worth it,and do NOT bring a lot of stuff, you will regret it! I can recommend Bill BilvoyeztmaisolTransport from KK - National Park - 20 in a minibus (2 hours)The best would be to return back to KK same day when you come down from the mountain, you will die for a nice hotel than at the NP!Enjou your hike!"
408,well worth the drive,"Mount Kinabalu is an amazing place that had shown how great of God's creation.We did 3 days 2 nights trip on last week. The place we stayed was at Grace 1. There is 3 double decker beds which can fit 6 pax in the dorm. The weather is nice and cool.If u visit to Sabah, do arrange some times to drop by at this place. For me, i am very sure will be back for second time."
409,Wonderful to climb up to the peak of Mt. Kinabalu,"The climb is harder than most reviews make out. We are fit with walking playing a key role in our lives but the constant uphill battle is relentless. We did the Mesilau trail and that's much harder. The view from the summit is amazing and the scenery on the way up is beautiful as you make your way through the dense jungle to the bonsai trees to the shrubs and eventually to the bare summit. The Laban Rata resthouse is basic, but functional with smaller dorms than we expected. This trip is certainly not for the fainthearted and impossible for the less active. It's certainly doable though with it being more mentally tough than physically with the final summit attempt happening at night. All in all tough, a good experience for any novice climber or hikers, but not as easy as most places tell you!"
410,Best Feat of My Life,"Mt Kinabalu is part of a beautiful nature reserve and the climb to the guesthouses (about 3/4 of the way up) is nice and not too difficult (though does take several hours). The climb to the summit, which I did on the second day, is TOUGH! I really regretted not having done more to prepare myself for it. All in all, glad I did it, but be warned, it is no walk in the park. Also, don't forget gloves, a warm jacket and a head torch."
411,So challenging and rewarding,"It's definately worth for the tears and sweat. Opt for Mesilau Trail for way up~ You could see beautiful flora and fauna, scenery and fresh atmosphere!"
412,Lows Peak Summit Trail with wife and young son,"Enjoyed 2 times enough, some my reason. Well okay be positive.When i can visit many times, if my friends visit so i guide them :)"
413,Great via ferrata experience but will not repeat the climb,"The climb up mount kinabalu is a great hike and the views are spectacular. However, the cartelization of the permits has resulted in inflated prices and at 1000RM there are many better hikes to do in SE Asia."
414,not for the faint hearted.... when you climb it....,"We took the Timpohon route, which is the shorter but steeper option, our goal being the Lagadan hut at 3323m where we would spend the night. As we slept at sea level the night before, I was a bit concerned about altitude sickness, which luckily proved to be unnecessary. The weather forecast was rather bad, but we were told that the weather on the mountain is unpredictable anyway, as it is so close to the shore.The moment we stepped out of the car we could feel a difference in the climate. While the coast was at cosy 30+ degrees, up here the air felt cool and chilly although we were wearing jumpers. The mountain itself was hidden behind a smoke screen of could and mist, so there was no telling what lay before us. The track started quite steep and kept climbing at a steady pace. Luckily our bags were rather light as we only packed lunch and some additional clothing layers for the top, and all in all the going was easier than expected.The rain came 2 hours after we started. It was a drizzle at first, which soon turned into solid rain. Gradually that initial rain turned into a torrential downpour with gusts of wind strong enough to blow trees over. Later we would find out the mountain was hit by a typhoon while we were climbing. We did anticipate rain, and we were equipped with good soft shell rain jackets and rain ponchos, but there is no equipment out there that would have kept us dry in a mayhem like that. What made the situation worse is that the few shelters that are scattered along the track are completely open to the sides, which made them all but useless. Gradually, the track turned from a steep path into an icy waterfall that at times would reach over our knees. We were still hours away from salvation, and the going was though, to put it mildly.A lot of people were caught completely off guard. We passed and older gentleman in sandals and shorts, shaking violently while a group was hugging him in an attempt to slow down hypothermia. I was starting to feel first signs of hypothermia myself. I thought about putting on some additional layers, but I was feeling relatively fine as long as I kept moving, so I decided against it, hoping that my thermal underwear and my fleece will stay dry for the next day, safely tucked away in my bag.We arrived at the Laban Rata hut around 3pm, not a minute too soon (this was not our hut, but we would find that out later). Nikki passed straight trough the door, walked to the nearest table and had a short cry on the floor. It took my body a couple of seconds to realize that I wasn't being pummeled by the weather anymore, then I had a look around. And what a sight that was. All around us people were sitting wrapped up in thick blankets. A middle aged man was running around in his underwear, doing squats while trying to stop the shaking. A girl was asking apathetically if anyone had some dry clothes to spare. Some people were crying - not exactly scenes you would expect on a tropical island. I joined Nikki at the table and sat down, exhausted. Then I started shaking myself. She got up to get me some hot water, but my hands were shaking so badly that I spilled every single drop before I could bring it to my mouth.Our hut was approximately 100m further up the mountain, and just the thought of getting out there again was harrowing. Once we reached the hut we took off all of our clothes and crawled into the sleeping bags, as there was no heating, fire or hot water. We were supposed to get up at 3-4am on the next morning to go for the summit, but Nikki decided against it, which I could understand very well. My plan was to get up and decide then and there. If the weather conditions were too dangerous, the gate to the summit would be closed anyway. Hopefully.I got up at 3:40am after a short and uncomfortable night. Tired and a bit confused, I went to the lounge where I found some other ghostly figures that probably looked just as out of place as I did. Outside it was still pitch black and the wind was howling savagely. I examined my clothes that were hanging nearby. They were as cold and wet as on the previous day and I started asking myself what I was doing there.Around 4:30am the guides reluctantly announced that they were going to open the gates, but they would not be able guarantee our safety and should the weather take a turn for the worse we had to get down straight away. I put on every single piece of gear I had, turned my head torch on and prepared myself for another beating. Outside the situation wasn't as bad as it seemed while we were in the hut. Although it was still raining and there was quite a bit of wind, it was nowhere near the disastrous proportions of the previous day.Physically the climb wasn't too hard, although one could definitely feel the higher altitude. It followed multiple sets of steep stairs which would later be replaced by a barren granite slab, with a couple of almost vertical rock walls in between. A thick white rope was layed out from the start of the rock wall and followed up the track all the way to the top, serving as a hand hold and guide. After a while the rain stopped and was replaced by a thick fog that reduced the visibility to only a couple of meters. Together with the lack of oxygen and the first light of the breaking dawn, the surroundings soon turned into an unreal and eerie place.The summit was quite anticlimactic. Crowded, cold and completely engulfed in fog, the only thing indicating that we were on Borneo's highest mountain was the signpost reading ""Low's Peak - 4095.2m"". I took the obligatory photo and headed back down. The sun was starting to rise and seemed to burn some holes through the fog, finally opening the view to the valley bellow."
415,fantastic,"At first, I looked at the peak and shouted many impossible words. But in 2008, I managed to set afoot on this mountain. It was rocky and full of trails. But with many guides helping tourist to reach the top, it became an easy task for tourist to choose this destination as their top choice. At the last base camp, I feel that the price of the food is reasonable. I know that ferrying up the food to this part of the peak requires a lot of effort and strength. However, an adventure is an adventure. So it has to sum well. The ending to the light is reaching the peak at 2am in the morning to see the sunrise. During numerous occasions, a lot of travellers prefer to rest at the base camp. A few manage to get out of bed to watch a spectacular sunrise which will be kept as a beautiful memory in their head."
416,Fairly good experience,"Do not book your climb through Mountain Trails Tour and Travel Sdn Bhd. I booked the hike for my group of 7 climbers six months in advance, with deposit paid. 2 weeks before my hike, this tour operator informed (lied) me that the park was closed on my hiking date (the park was actually open). I was not able to climb the mountain, my holiday plans ruined, and deposit very difficult to get refunded."
417,I am on the Top of the World.. Satisfaction!!,"I went on the Mount Kinabalu climb as part a 3D2N package organized through Amazing Borneo. My package included the via ferrata option, which I discussed in a separate review.First of all, the package is a bit expensive but not outrageously so, especially if you consider the the mountain huts, the rest shelters and the guides. I have been trekking all over the world (Alps, Blue Mountain, Karakoram, Yosemite, etc) and if you consider the cost versus comfort, Kinabalu comes out quite well. One thing that was disappointing was the park HQ area which did not have much on offer except room and food.As I said the infrastructure is pretty impressive. The trails are well kept and there are signposts every 500m. There are 7 rest huts on the way to Laban Rata, which provides basic protection from the elements and they all have toilets and fresh water (except for the 7th hut). The mountain huts are pretty good considering the location - not just shelter but water, sleeping bags, cooked food, electricity! It's not a resort but it's deluxe as climbing goes.Fitness required:The Kinabalu climb is marketed as a holiday to the general public and I think some unprepared people take the challenge. From Timpohon Gate to Laban Rata is 1,400m in altitude gain over 6km or about 23% gradient. From Laban Rata to Low's Peak is 820m over 2.7km or 30%. An don't forget the climb back down the mountain. Altitude sickness starts to kick in at 2,500m and everyone will be affected by 3,500m, although it is rare to have serious problems under 5,000m. Furthermore you will get less than 6 hours of poor quality sleep. This is a pretty serious exertion, especially If you are carrying a pack.To test yourself, walk up 20 flights of stairs and come down slowly without stopping, and repeat. If this is too much then you need more fitness.What to take:I read about the facilities available but I carried a lot of emergency stuff with me just in case eg GPS, compass, space blanket, tarp, hammock, rope, prussic, water treatment, etc. I was mostly worried about really heavy rainfall and getting lost. However these were all redundant. In retrospect, the only thing I don't regret is the space blanket. Also I would advise that people take ponchos instead of fancy waterproof jackers. It gets very humid so even the most breathable jackets will be uncomfortable. Ponchos are available at Kinabalu Park HQ but they are porr quality and expensive. All the guides carried umbrellas, which is a very good idea if you are not carrying a big pack.Don't forget sunblock - uv at altitude is severe even on overcast days.BiodiversityFit people can and do make it to Laban Rata in 4 hours or less. I find that such people are missing the point of the Kinabalu climb. For me it is the change in the environment and the biodiversity on the way up. You really should take the time to appreciate the change from jungle to montane to cloud forest and finally alpine tundra. After all Kinabalu got the World Heritage Site for biodiversity, not for the sunrise view from Low's Peak. Besides there is nothing to do at Laban Rata if you get there early and the slower pace will reduce the altitude sickness.Similarly there is no need to rush the climb to Low's Peak. Getting there an hour before sunrise mean you will just be shivering in the dark.Finally be careful going down. Going down is always more dangerous than going up. You will be more tired, less focused and less able to balance yourself."
418,Very over priced,"Being as a Trekking Guide as well as a Tour and trekking operator  in Nepal Himalaya, I have heard a lots about the beautiful of mount Kinabalu  and national park in Malaysia.  I have organized many  trekking trips in Himalaya of Nepal to Malaysian friends and groups, hearing from them about Kinabalu, made me jealous to be there once,  I am dreaming to trek around Kinabalu national park and climb up Kinabalu. some of my Malaysian friend also inviting me to trek together.Once for sure will see you there friend  !Madan NeupaneTouch The Himalaya Treks and Expedition Pvt. Ltd.Nurshing Chowk, Thamel Kathmandu Nepal."
419,Well worth the effort Just Do It,"While it is a less technical mountain to climb, you will enjoy this experience much better if you prepare for it physically. You will be rewarded with what you achieve if you train prior to commencing this climb.The first day consists of 6km upwards with steep steps and rocks to climb, but when you stop at the rest huts you feel like you are floating above the clouds.April is a great time of year to go as it is dry season and the views were incredible. While there is always cloud cover that drifts around the mountains, they would come and go quite frequently to reveal the peaks and the national park below.There are many tourists that come in this time of year too, but as I traveled solo it was a great way to meet new people and share the excitement and challenges together. A mix of locals climbing and overseas travelers.The summit day is a very early start, but you get treated to an early breakfast, followed by a second breakfast after reaching the top and coming back to the restaurant.The skies were clear the day I reached the top - 4th April - and there was barely any wind near Low's Peak.The sunrise was beautiful and at the top of Low's Peak you have 360 degree views of the surrounding peaks, with a nice orange glow when the sun starts to reach the surrounding mountain tops.A very rewarding experience to reach the top, and while it feels like a long way back down to the base of the mountain, the local forest is beautiful and peaceful to walk in. You get an official certificate when you get back to civilization which makes the experience even more worthwhile.If you are into physical challenges and love the outdoors, this would be something that I would recommend. They also do a Via Ferrata climb if you have a couple extra days to spend on the mountain.Accommodation is in huts with bunk beds, basic, but a great place to rest your tired muscles."
420,Top experience!,OMG - the internet says moderate fitness is required - define moderate! Recommend to train with LOTS of uneven steps and get knee supports. But AWESOME to do!
421,Best Guide,"It's not a leisure one day return hiking trail. Please do train yourself up before attempting the climb to the 4095m peak. However, the experience during the two day one night climb is so worth that you must enjoy the scenery along the trail."
422,Needs to be done,"I climbed Mt Kinabalu in July with three friends. It was undoubtedly a terrific hike, with beautiful views, great experience and one of my favourite trips in Malaysia so far. We were fortunate to get two dry and mostly sunny days. The hike itself is challenging!! We read a lot about it online, and I think promotional sites underplay the difficulty of this hike. We were of average fitness and we found it very hard. No technical skill, mountain experience or (much) special equipment needed but the sheer effort of the hike was very taxing. On day two for instance, it took us 4 hours to hike up to the summit (was FREEZING with strong winds but luckily no rain), 2 hours to hike down to the huts, then 6.5 hours to hike out to the end - that was 12.5 hours of hiking in one day over 12kms of very difficult terrain. You will come to hate stairs!One thing to bear in mind is that there are very limited options if you are injured. There are helipads and stretchers available for serious issues (like broken legs) but if your leg muscles give out on the descent the only option is to grit your teeth and push on. Our guide helped carry backpacks (which was lovely and we tipped him handsomely for it) but ligament damage and jelly legs had to push on. Apart for that, we genuinely thought it was an amazing experience and worth the (considerable) effort. If you're up to it, definitely do it."
423,worth the effort,"I went to Mt Kinabalu on the day tour, so I just visited the  visitor centre. In the visitor centre, they demonstrated the history of Mt Kinabalu and some dioramas were interesting. But only hanging around the area, I felt so refreshed by mystic plants and fog. I'd like to climb up to the top of the mountain next time!"
424,Go prepared,"We booked almost 6 months in advance with Sutera Sanctuary Lodges and everything was perfectly taken care of. The climb was amazing, with incredible different landscapes all the way up.On the first day, and starting from Timpohon Gate, you will be sleeping at Laban Rata (3.272m), walking for 6Km and climbing 1.400m. If you have the time, it makes sense to spend the previous night at Kinabalu Park (1 1/2 h from Kota Kinabalu), so that you can have an early start the next morning, well before the groups coming directly from Kota Kinabalu to begin the climbing on the same day. This also allows you to arrange your permits and guide the day before, as well as enjoying the trails in the Park, involving better acclimatization prior to the climbing.With an early start, you will be in Laban Rata around 14h, relaxing and enjoying the views until they start serving dinner at 16:30h. The food was excellent and plentiful. Around 20:00h, it is time to go to bed. If you book in advance, it is worth to try to get one of the private rooms (which doesn't only mean privacy, but more important, hot shower and heating in the room, none of these available in the dorm rooms). You will be up at around 02:00h in the morning for an early breakfast before starting your climbing to the summit at 03:00h (2,7Km and climbing 800m). It is steep but the rope is very helpful, you are about to reach the roof of Borneo at 4.095m! We were lucky to have a clear sunrise and could enjoy the views. On the way down, you will be stopping in Laban Rata again to have breakfast and pick up your things. Back to Kinabalu Park, and transfer to KK. If you like hiking, do not miss Mount Kinabalu!"
425,"Be prepared and know your limits, don't underestimate this!","I have hiked the mountain before and returned specifically to descend 'via Ferrata'. If you love challenging yourself with heights and views it is amazing. We did the longer course forgetting it was an extra 5hrs on top of the normal hike down, but it was definitely worthwhile for the difference in cost. The walk the torq course seemed similar on a smaller scale which is better if you have any doubts!"
426,Be well prepared if you want to climb to the top without suffering,"Fantastic experience. Very challenging (much more than we expected being relatively fit) but well worth the effort. Make sure you wrap up warm (as we didn't) and come fully prepared. Amazing views from the top, will remember for a long time."
427,TYH Borneo Tour & Travels,I was lucky with the weather and only had one hour of rain on my final descent.  I did the Low's Peak via ferreta and it was an awesome experience.   I would love to do it again.  Guides were excellent and their focus on safety made me feel very comfortable.
428,Good challenge to yourself !,"Did a 2D1N (2day1night) climb of the peak incl. Low's peak via ferrata on the way down.Was very exhausting, and if the travel agency would have told us at the time of booking, would have preferred to stay up in Laban Rata for 2 nights to enjoy the place/view and take it a bit more easy (also as there were empty beds available). In doing all in only 2 days, it felt very squeezed in.Besides the great experience, the booking process and the price really annoyed me a lot and made us hesitate:- Price: its the government that sets the prices and all tour agencies collude and stick to them. Its intransparent how the price is really composed, as usual in Malaysia locals pay significantly!!! less, and little of the high price arrives at the people who work there (e.g. the climbing guides). Thats really a shame and the authorities/government should change that, as it seems that only very few people at the head of some tour operators earn themselves a golden nose at the moment.- booking: i travelled extensively, but this is about the worst booking process i ever came across. Its intransparent and lenghty, and not all agencies seem to have access to the same accomodation/permit inventory. TIP: write an email to ALL agencies you find on the web in Kota Kinabalu, and dont believe them if they say that you can only do the summit WITH the via ferrata. Respond that you heard of a friend who just cancelled his booking (obviously on a closer date to when you want to go), and ask them if they can now offer you those spaces. Most often, they will ""suddenly"" have spaces available earlier...The government should create a single webpage on which all climbers can see availabilities & book their climb!"
429,The Other Review: Be very prepared,"We did it end of December 2012 in a 2 days/one night overstay at Laban Rata guesthouse via Timpohon gate paying usual fees via travel agency.It was pouring all day. It is exhausting. We are fit - running 3 times a week, serious workouts, BMI below 23, aged fourty around;). It always goes up, only, in total, perhaps 150 m no elevation walk. Please do not underestimate, around 40% give up due to bad preparation. See other websites for hints on right equipment and guesthouse (clean and basic).. Wrap your clothing , esp. for second day in extra plastic bags in your backpack -even you think its already well packed ;) I got almost frost bites. Ask, if night ascent not possible due to bad weather, well, guides might tell you, to give another try at 6am during daylight - might be even better than night! Take gloves for managing the ropes on last stretch (2,5km). Guides somehow lack of understandable English. Check guides beforehand, its possible, dont allow rush. Take some days to relax your muscles after descent, youll be surprised how painful it is. All after all: do it - nothing for the fainthearted..."
430,Typhoon while you climb,"A highlight of our trip to Borneo. The key limitation is accommodation on the mountain, and bookings are done 6 months in advance. We went as part of an Intrepid Travel tour package, and they took care of everything for us. There's plenty of advice on this mountain on the net, so do your research to make sure you're prepared. Amazing photos at the summit and on the way down from the summit. People of all ages climbed, but be sure to improve your fitness in advance."
431,Unlucky with weather,"Successfully climbed mount kinabalu is unforgettable moment and nice view to take a photo. Mt. Kinabalu Peak is so popular and listed at 20th most prominent in the world. There is 2 track to start climb, from timpohon gate or mesilau gate. Mesilau treks more challenging compare to timpohon but mostly hikers like to start from mesilau gate because your can see more beautiful of Borneo flora and fauna. Meals are provided but if didn't enough don't worry there is cafe at laban rata (Rest place before hiking to summit) don't forget to bring more cash. U can bring instant noodles in cup and 3in1 drinks,hot water is provided at the cafe so you can save money because the meals are quite expensive.  Take your time and go easy but don't too late because if you reach the last check point (sayat-sayat) at 5.00~05.30am their will not give you permission climb to the low's peak. Have a nice day and enjoy your time.... Welcome to Sabah,Borneo."
432,Mount Kinabalu in 1 day,Extremely expensive for what it is. The actual climb and hotel you stay in are okay. Unfortunately we didn't get to summit due to inclement weather. I understand and respect the guides decision as there are people of all abilities climbing the mountain. However the price is extortionate for what is a pretty basic climb. I could of spent a week climbing in Italy for the same money. If the price more truly reflected the experience then I would recommend but at the current prices I would avoid.
433,1 day climb,Educational trip maybe helped by the fact I had a great guide named Andy lee for exotic Borneo. Downfall being that by the time you get there it's usually hidden in cloud hence the name the shy mountain. Regardless I still enjoyed the trip got a great view at the view point on the way toward the mountain.
434,"Beautiful, varied landscape. Hard.","Great view via mesilau to laban rata and wonderful view all d way to the summit peak. Great time to practice your perserverance, determination and patience while climbing up. It was a wonderful moment with myself and friends."
435,Great experience,"First 2 attempts, I made it to the 8km mark. Only a handful of my group reached the submit. This 3rd attempt we were more prepared. And most importantly I MADE IT to the top!1) Request to stay at base camp before the morning ascend. ( this will help to climatize your body)2) book your stay at laban rata itself.. ( very important and more convenient to eat at the restaurant, get warm water etc etc)3) walk a constant pace.. try not to stop .. We booked our tour with amazing borneo.. They have really good guides. :) Ronnie , Sufrie , Mike and RobbieDo note to drink plenty of water when you are ascending and descending.. This will prevent altitude sickness . I carried 2litres of water up to laban rata, 1.5 litres up to the peak and 1.5 litres back to the base camp. At Laban Rata, there are beds with clean sheets, with clean toilets. Plentiful buffet food . Porter service are available at a small fee depending on the weight of your bags.  Things I broughthair dryer - in case of rain.. so that we may dry our wet clothes. Wet Wipes-No Hot water available for shower just wipe yourself downUniqlo Wind breaker - water proof act as a rain coat too Thermal - for sleeping ( thermal top I brought up to submit just in case I need the additional warmth)1 uniqlo long sleeve - wear for submit  1 singlet - 1st layer in case too warm, I can take off some clothes.. ( no worries its darn cold up there)1 yoga long pants.1 uniqlo water proof /wind proof pants..1 Head torch ( for submit climb in darkness)beanie.Daiso Heat Pack ( works wonders , cheap and good ) thick socksKumpung adidas purchased at the base camp for 20 RM. Guarantee not slippery. ( however size is a problem .. smallest size is 36.. and its too big for me )snickers and m&m( gives energy while climbing up and makes ur climb less miserable)Descending is as painful as ascending if not worse. Overall Excellent experience...excellent  ^.^ will miss it ~"
436,Experience the magic of Mt Kinabalu,"This marks my second ascent to Mt KK as I did not make it to the summit by sunrise two years ago. I made it this time round! Mt KK wasn't an easy feat. I completed the climb with no trainings prior, but will be great if first attempters can do some trainings to strengthen your legs to prep for the endless stairways. Booked our tours with Amazing Borneo. Recommended guides: Ronnie, Sufrie and Roby.Things to have from HQ - Laban Rata: a pair of good grip shoes (sports shoes will do), 1.5L water, energy bars (chocolates too), hand sanitizer, wet tissues, walking stick (to rent at HQ at RM10), no need thick clothing for ascent to Laban Rata. Mt KK started off with gradual and man-made steps for first 2km or so before the natural steps get steeper and more challenging after that. After resting at Layang Layang rest stop near 4km, the paths transform to boulders and rocks. There will be a rest stop at 5km, and onwards are more rocky steps all the way to Laban Rata rest house that sits at 6km. Hydrate yourself along the route to prevent altitude sickness. Take sips instead of doing water parade every single time as the latter may give stitches.Had decent buffet dinner and stayed over at Laban Rata. As temperature fluctuates around single digit degree C, we merely wipe ourselves instead of bathing. To keep warm, I wore Uniqlo heat tech top and bottom underneath. Try to request to stay at Laban Rata, it makes life easier when the restaurant is below and ease bottle refilling trips. Other lodges require 5-10 mins walk from Laban Rata.Summit climb gears: headlamps (a must), 2 person can share 1 bottle of 1.5L, a small backpack with minimal belongings, beanie, gloves (bought from Daiso, so after the rope burns I can just throw away), heat tech, long sleeves, jackets and 2 heat packs in the pockets.Summit climb starts at 2.30am. Grab some light breakfast before that at the restaurant, but don't overeat as you may feel nauseous afterwards. Start promptly, so that you can make it to the summit before sunrise. We did not walk very fast, but maintain our pace throughout and short catch breaths in between. Try not to rest for too long, as your body temperature will drop and you will feel terrible in the cold. Air gets thinner as you climb, just regulate your breathing and keep to a comfortable pace. Summit climb consists of manmade steps and rock-steps for less than 1km, before reaching a 'rope course' where you need to run up the steep slope with the help of rope. You will also rely on the rope to cross some rocky areas. After that, it will be rock plateau throughout till you reach summit slightly after 8.5km mark. There is a check point with toilet at 7km, make sure you reach before 5am else they will reject your climb and advise you to U-turn, that's what we heard. The summit is narrow, need to be careful and not cross over the barriers. Always listen to your guides, they were great help throughout. Head back to Laban Rata for breakfast and change out to lighter clothings (like what you wore from base to 6km) for the descent to HQ. We depended on mental strength most of the time. Trick - Mind over Body. It's a good trip to get to know yourself better, and definitely a YOLO thing to do. Our legs were sore for close to a week, so be prepared for some muscles torments post Mt KK climb!Documented a more elaborated post on http://huimineology.blogspot.sg/2014/06/mount-kota-kinabalu-finale.html"
437,Totally worth it,"I booked the 3D2N trip with the long Via Ferrata at two days notice with AmazingBorneo who were wonderful.The walk (not a climb!) up the mountain is an arduous slog with dehydration and altitude being the main difficulties. Stop the dehydration and the altitude becomes easier. Its a well maintained path with many wooden steps in places. The route to the top from the sleeping huts is largely over large exposed slabs.I was lucky with the weather. No rain, little cloud that was low down, and a clear moonlit walk to the top (didnt even need the head torch after getting out of the trees).Had the place to myself for half an hour, as the guide was cold and went down a little, before others arrived.The Via Ferrata on the way down was well worth it. Did the long one - Low's Peak Circuit. It isn't strenuous so if you are worried about the effort involved because you are breathless on the climb up, don't be. Was a bit of a rest really, with stunning views (in my good weather which you wont always get!) while dangling of the rock face for impressive pictures."
438,Climbing Mount Kinabulu in a day,"Before the climb, i heard lot of feedback that you need to train your stamina, and strength in order to conquer the highest peak in Southeast Asia. This is my first climb and frankly, i almost give up when you thought that the certain spot are the finishing line, but is not!  So to me, the most important are endurance and determination besides the strength and stamina. I just couldn't describe my feeling when look at the breathtaking view from the peak.As i failed to witness the daybreak moment, i told myself that i will go again in future!"
439,Worth the effort to reach the top!,Although a challenging climb for those who do it the sense of achievement and views at the summit are well worth it. Our guide Julius was brilliant and the cloud forest that you walk through is good enough to distract you from your burning thighs. The hut we stayed at before the top was quite basic but did the job as we only slept in it for a few hours. Well worth doing.
440,Day trip to Mount Kinabalu and Poring Hot Springs,"Mount Kinabalu has got to be one of the most interesting mountain climbs one can do. The guides could not be better and will let you climb the mountain ahead of them if they think you are trust worthy. It is one of the best outings in Sahba. Very friendly people and a great 2 days f excitement and beautiful views.A tour well worth it. The Shangrila resort is also a picturesque part of the world, very relaxing place with beautiful white sand beaches."
441,Physically challenging but great sense of achievement,"You can't miss this experience if you are in the region. This climb appeared to be much more popular than we thought. No chance of getting lost as the paths are maintained well and clearly marked.The hike was not that difficult or technical and we were able to get to the mountain hut by lunch time. There was only one place where dinner was served and everyone from all the huts around came to eat. We were so impressed by the variety and quality of the food they served given this place being at the top of the mountain. The mountain hut was pretty much basic, but clean and sufficient to stay and sleep for several hours before getting up early in the morning to head for the summit for sunrise. It gave us lots of fun memories and we really enjoyed it."
442,Amazingly challenging!,"The view was simply breathtaking & awesome.On the whole the trip was extremely well organized. Plenty of food, facilities up to par. We had an awesome guide Mr Abbie bin Intang who turned out to be a local celebrity. He was amazingly patient with us & kind.The only complaint we had was rubbish was not collected regularly along the Mesilau trail. We counted at least 10 bottles thrown into the bushes & overflowing garbage bins at the shelters."
443,"Walking above the clouds, 30 kilometers in 30 hours","For beginners who wish to climb up Mt. KK, I would propose to use Mesilau route although there is an extra of 2 km from Timpohon route. But the scenery is really wonderful and we saw many unique plants that grow along the paths at highlands. I have made a right choice to go my first attempt climbing Mt. KK using this route. The beauty of the scenery will boost me to go for second attempt to climb Mt. KK."
444,Amazing feeling.,"The climb is challenging even for those who have trained for it but the slog, aching muscles, early morning wake ups are all worth it for the incredible experience that Mount Kinabalu throws at you.The organisation of the park authorities are excellent and at no time do you feel unsure of where you are supposed to be heading or how. You are logged in at the park, issued a guide which is compulsory, checked through the gates and allowed to walk at your own pace but reassured that your guide is watching your back at all times.It's a two day climb the first stage a 6 kilometres hike up to Laban Rata Lodge where you will be staying the night. This first stage takes you from the flora and fauna of the Borneo jungle all the way up to scrub bushes as you ascend. At every 0.5kilometres there is a rest stop some with toilet facilities and water but note that the water is untreated. Sterilisation tablets highly recommended if you intend to use. The last two kilometres to the lodge is the most challenging being rugged terrain and a continuous upward climb. This section is usually completed in five hours.Laban Rata Lodge is functional with an excellent buffet dinner provided and the same for breakfast. You will not starve. Since everything has to be carried up to the lodge by porter who are amazing what they carry, prices at the shop for water, hot drinks, chocolate etc tend to be more expensive. There is no hot water although they do tell you that it is connected to a solar power unit but can not guarantee sunshine. Hence the water which is fed from the mountain is freezing cold. Dormitory style rooms with bunk beds, small but ok for the time that you spend in them.The final stage to the summit starts at 3.00am and this can be a long slog as everyone is climbing a narrow trail path and the opportunity to overtake slow climbers is limited especially for the first 2 kilometres. It does get better towards the top. The climb takes about 3 hours with the aim to reach the top for sunrise. This is incredibly beautiful but not always guaranteed. We were lucky as the conditions were perfect but two days before this section was closed due to bad weather. However on the way up the view of the valley below, the lights of KK in the distance are not to be missed in your goal of keeping one foot in front of the other climbing upwards. Equally as the morning light approaches stopping to take photographs is a must as by the time you walk down you are naturally in daylight. Warm clothing is recommended for this section but for the first stage from the park shorts, t- shirt is good enough. Good shoes definitely. The weather can change rapidly so again a water proof jacket or a cheap plastic Mack which can be bought easily in KK is a good idea. Go for a size larger than you normally wear as it can be draped over your rucksack as well as yourself. Climbing Mount Kinabalu did not disappoint. Rugged, changeable, spectacular there are not enough adjectives to describe it. If you planned on doing it, and are fairly fit you will enjoy the challenge. Life changing experience."
445,Amazing experience!!!!!! Via ferrata is incredible!,"What an experience!!!Let me start by saying I love walking and speed walk around 13 kilometres a day but nothing prepared me for this.I booked an overnight climb through Borneo Calling who were extremely courteous, efficient and helpful.Pick up from hotel at 6.30am and drive of 2 hours. We arrived to be allocated a guide (mine was Joeythine bin musin - really amazing guy. Very patient, helpful and encouraging the whole way), drop off luggage, hire a walking pole (10ringitts - worth every cent) and given our pass which was to be worn at all times.The walk started off quite comfortably but my breathing became quite laboured. The stops along the way were welcome. Lunch break (they provided some fried chicken, apple, hard boiled egg, sandwich and water before we left) at the 4 kilometre point and the real fun started.... the rest of the climb to Laban Rata Hut was quite taxing but my body still managed well. Overall the climb took me around 5 hours.Had a shared room with bunk beds (there were 3 of us in the room). Rooms aren’t heated but the bedding is very comfortable and warm.I did not use the shower - I was very cold  and freezing cold water wasn’t very appealing.Dinner started at 4.30pm. Consisted of pasta, chicken, beef, lamb, noodles, soup, fruit. It was very good considering where we were and plentiful.The view at sunset is simply beyond spectacular as you have clouds below and above you.There was an minor earthquake overnight but all was ok.Next morning supper was provided at 2.00am. Toast, cereal, French toast, etc. I decided to just have toast as it wouldn’t be too heavy on my stomach.The climb started at 2.30am and for me it was hard. I was struggling to breath and was literally stopping every few steps. My body still wasn’t tired it was just the breathing that was hard. Some of the climb I found extremely physically challenging. It was freezing at the very top (even though I had on plenty of layers I couldn’t stop shaking) and I really didn’t appreciate my achievement or the view. I just wanted to get down. Had my obligatory photo, sun came up and off we went. Once I could actually see the walk in day light I was glad it was dark when I climbed up or I might not have been able to keep going mentally.The views however are spectacular and once I thawed out a bit I did start to enjoy myself again.Breakfast at the hut (great fried rice) and off we went again back down to the bottom. It had rained below the hut the night before which made for a very slippery walk down. This is when my body finally couldn’t cope any more - I was exhausted and every step was a major effort.Declined lunch at the end of the climb, just wanted to get back to my hotel.This is my first ever mountain climb. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute and am overwhelmed by the body’s and mind’s strength and perseverance.Get good hiking boots, dress for the weather (you will need a light jacket as you climb further up on the first day),  pack light, take snacks with you (muesli bars, lollies). I found it useful to pay my guide to carry my winter clothes for the morning climb, again my pole was a god send.Loved every second.Happy to answer if anyone has any questions - message me."
446,A climb worth trying!,"Climbing the Kinabalu is an amazing experience but you have to be prepared: we saw a lot of people with the wrong clothes and very basic shoes. On the summit you reach 4095m so it's proper mountain and not a family trail!The ascent is not technically hard (looooooots of stairs) but it's rather long. Be prepared to walk 4h from the gate to the hut, have a short or no sleep, then leave at 3am for 2.5 to 3h climbing. Then after a few pictures it's time to go down with a little stop at the hut for breakfast! It's almost 14k in 30h.Wear good shoes and warm clothes for the summit (nearly freezing and strong winds at the time we were)."
447,Wow! We can climb mountains!!!,"This mountain climb is definitely worth doing. What will make it the most enjoyable is if you are reasonably fit and get good weather. The rainy season in Borneo is from October to March. I climbed on 8th November 2016 and was very lucky to get perfect weather for the sunrise at the summit on the 9th November. It was my first time doing the sunrise thing where you get up stupidly early and climb to the summit of a mountain in the dark to see the sunrise. I didn't get why you would want to do that to yourself before, except maybe to give yourself the best chance of clear weather at the summit. But now i get it. It was surreal climbing up in the dark and seeing the stars so clearly and the lights of the villages below and Kota Kinabalu in the distance. The peaks around us were just shadows only visible because of blocking the stars. And then they all start to materialise as day breaks and we reached the summit. It was an awesome 0 degrees too, evidenced by a puddle being frozen. I love the cold and it was a refreshing break from the tropical weather in the valley and on the coast. So things that you might want to know: - if you go between October and March you don't need to book. I did because I didn't know better. I had one travel company tell me 3 months before that the dates I wanted were booked out. But I managed to get the booking with downbelow adventures for about A$500/1500 RM all included - that's the 2D/1N hike with a guide (included transfers from Kota Kinabalu, which i didn't need, park entrance fees, dorm room bed and 5 meals). But I stayed the previous night at poring hot springs and nature resort and found that they had a price about half of what i paid. That may not have included all the fees but would be no more than 1000 RM all up if it didn't. I guess I paid more for a travel agent and the security of knowing I had a booking, but there was a spare bed in my 4-bed dorm. - on my 2D/1N climb I met my guide at the main gate at Kinabalu park, which is around 1500m above sea level. We then drove up to the Tiphonon Gate which is at 1866m. We parked there and started the climb. The guide gave me a packed lunch, which consisted of a basic 3x half sandwiches, one apple and two small packets of biscuits. One bottle of water too and i brought more. I found about 2L of water was enough for me for the climb. We climbed to 3250m where the Laban Rata hut is. We set of at about 945am and arrived at 2pm. I was lucky to have a guide all to myself so i could go my own pace (My booking was for up to 3 or so people per guide). Then my guide left me and said ""see you at 3am tmrw"". The dinner buffet in the common area in the hut is served from 430pm til 7pm so i had some time to kill. There are some games up there and i found some people playing cards so i joined in. We were in the cloud at this point but at around 4pm it started to clear and we could the peaks above us, followed by an awesome sunset. - I tried to sleep at 8pm (it's like a hostel - they provide a towel and bedding) but the hut was quite noisy all night so I recommend to take ear plugs! I got up at 220am and had some supper in the common area: the third meal included in the climb (from 2-330am!). We left at 3am and got to the summit (4095m a.s.l.) by 515am. Then started descending at 615am to arrive at 8am back at the hut for the buffet breakfast. I was keen to get back as early as i could so i left at 850am with my guide and got back to the Tiphonon Gate by 12. The last included meal was the buffet lunch there.- For other things that you should take with you (e.g., good hiking boots, beanie, head torch, sunscreen, hat, etc.) get in touch with a travel agent/guide company and they'll tell you."
448,A great experience,"It's not that difficult a climb compared to other mountains - there are steps which are not in good shape and if it rains it will probably be slippery, but the top of the mountain is all granite ""plains"" which I haven't seen to that extent before. Very cool and very worth it.I would hesitate before going choosnig to do the ""mountain torq"" climb as part of the actual climb - we were COMPLETELY out of energy when we reached the bottom of the mountain again on the second day. 13 hours climbing down. Our legs were shaking!Do the 2 day climb, not the 3 day one (which just means you will spend a day at the bottom of the mountain - spend it somewhere else I would suggest)"
449,Tough Climb in rough conditions,This mountain is stunning. Great views and beautiful pristine montaine vegetation. For anyone who loves a challenge or who is a lover of nature - you will never forget this amazing place. I am so happy that I went and did this!A word of warning. Pack warm clothes for the ascent. Its freezing cold and you will need proper gloves. Skiing/ snowboarding gloves recommended.
450,One day to summit trek,"I have been hiking many mountains in Southeast Asia. There is nothing compared to Kinabalu. Comparing their incredible view with the effort, this mount is worth spending your time. You can make it in 2D/1N.  Each check point has water source, toilet and trash bin.  It's also good for newbie since there is no need to camp. The Laban Rata base camp is quite good, having place for showering, bed, food and toilet. On the way to summit can be challenging and required slightly technical (pulling the rope, ladder) but should be manageable. Enough read? Let's go there.. this will be one of the best experience in your life.I used AmazingBorneo. Their staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and good service mind.  I did my first KK in December 2015 and will do again in May via Ferrata with the same company."
451,Day trip and hot springs,"My friend and I climbed Mt Kinabalu in Aug 2017 and loved it! But be warned, lots of people don't love it, so you need to be prepared. That means, get all the right kit and gear ready for the hike, including boots, rain jacket, warm layers, gloves, hat, water bottle, snacks, and walking poles (these saved me on the way down). It also means get fit and strong, you won't enjoy the hike if you are struggling and unfit. I trained for approx 6 weeks prior to doing the hike and have medium levels of fitness.I definitely recommend staying the first night at Mt Kinabalu Park HQ near Timphoon Gate, it helps your acclimatise and means you can sleep in on the day you start hiking instead of travelling from KK town. The hike begins at Timphoon Gate and then proceeds for 6km to the Huts. Get ready for 6km of uphill jungle trekking with steps, rocks and more steps. Its slow going, so expect to be hiking for 5-6 hours on this day. Shelters are located along the way pretty regularly and they have toilets and tank water so you can refill your water bottles (but bring water purifying tablets). You then stay at the Huts for your night on the mountain, either Laban Rata or Pendant Hut depending on your package. Try and get some sleep this night as the next day is a long one! We stayed at Pendant Hut and woke at 2am to begin the summit section. Again, expect rocky and steep trails, and of course its dark so a head torch is a absolute must! It takes anywhere between 2-3 hours to reach the summit, and your guide will pace you so you will make it for the sunrise. And what a phenomenal view you will see when the sun comes up! Its amazing and truly spectacular, one of the best I've seen. This is when layers are key, its cold up there, and can get very windy. Next is the long hike back down the mountain. We did the ferrata activity as well on the way down, which made it a super long day for us (15 hrs hiking total, 0200 until 1700). So again, be prepared (mentally as much as physically) for long days walking and you will be fine. Its tough, but rewarding, I'd definitely recommend it!"
452,A Great Experience- Guide Francis is brillant,"I did the climb 12 days ago and I can honestly say it was the most difficult gruelling task I have ever endured. The last km to Laban Rata was hard I felt so near but so far.  Whilst sitting at the base camp at 2am drinking as many cups of coffee I could manage I kept thinking ""what the hell am I doing"". I'm more of a sun lounger type of women in her early 40's who thought it would be a good idea to climb whilst on holiday in Borneo with my boyfriend.  I'm not super fit but of reasonable good health my boyfriend is much fitter but we were in pure pain the days following the climb.   Walking down stairs and your legs would just collapse underneath you as there was no strength left in them. We met a Australian man who had also climbed the following day he was extremely fit probably Late 50's who said he'd done ultra marathons and climbing mount Kinabalu was up there with that type physical endurance he also suffered with altitude sickness luckily we didn't, just a bit of feeling light headed. I am so happy that I managed to get to lows peak I honestly thought I couldn't do it when I saw the it as it's another 0.5 km climbing up more boulders but I just kept going and I did it. When I reached the top and saw the sun rise it made it all worth while.  We made it down to Timphon gate at 12:40 my feet were in bits blisters and bruised toenails.I had never felt exhaustion like it, coming down the mountain my legs had a mind of their own over the last 2km my feet and knees were going in different directions.  I wouldn't do it again but I'm so glad I did😄.  Good luck to anyone else who attempts it."
453,Dreaming to climb up Kinabalu.,"This was my first mountain climb and probably my toughest. A two-day climb, it was steep and riddled with stairs almost the entire way up so make sure you are physically prepared! Things to consider: pack warm clothes for your pre-summit sleep, it's still cold in the hut despite the heating, and freezing while you're waiting for the sun to rise in the morning. There's no hot water in the hut but plenty of food to eat at the end of day one, which you will devour after your climb. The view from the hut and also the summit was one of the most beautiful I have seen, well worth it just to look down on the world from above the clouds and couldn't recommend more. Loads of great photo ops on the way down, if you have a good guide like us he will point out all the best places to take shots and become your personal photographer. Lastly, the way down was super painful for my knees so beware and bring medication if you also suffer from sore joints. You will need it."
454,An amazing and unforgettable experience,I still cannot believe I made it to the summit. Such an incredible experience and the guide was very friendly and helpful. In the end I was so happy I had achieved such a challenging and incredible quest. A must do but it is important to train beforehand so your legs aren't as sore and tired after the trek.
455,Surprisingly Excellent Climbing Experience and Facilities,"I did the summit trail as part of an Intrepid tour through Sabah. I won't pretend the climb was easy - it was INTENSE, but it was the most unreal and rewarding experience of my life to date."
456,Exceptional Trekking Experience,"We booked a day trip from our hotel in KK and we visited Mount Kinabalu (day visit, we weren't climbing) and Poring Hot Springs. The drive from KK took about two and a half hours and it was a good drive and we enjoyed getting out of the city centre (which for me personally I wasn't so keen on). The views from various spots was great. However, we actually only got to walk around the botanic garden and didn't get to do any more exploring. I was hoping there would be some other short trails that we could walk around so if you're planning on visiting then it may be worth checking with your guide, which is what I should've done. Lunch near to the hot springs was included in the day trip and that was good! The canopy walk within the hot springs ground was good fun although long queues. The springs itself was a little disappointing. It may have been because it was so busy (religious holiday the day we visited) combined with all of the tourists so we didn't bother going in. We walked to a small waterfall which was nice and away from all of the noise and children. If you're in KK then worth visiting but I wouldn't go back."
457,Mt Kinabalu  climb. Fabulous!,The views while climbing the mountain are breathtaking and worth the climb. The sunrise from top the mountain is a lifetime experience and something you will remember.
458,A major disappointment,If you love nature and hiking..this is a MUST DO trip and amazing experience that you will never forget..I was told it is not difficult to climb this mountain..even beginner can do it but they never told me it would drained away ALL your energy after the climb...perhaps I should thank my friend for not telling me the truth..otherwise I might back off from this wonderful trip...my advice is to take your time to enjoy the journey..feel the nature that is so close to you...it is okay to feel the pains because everyone experience the same...do hire a porter if you have a lot to carry...a good tour guide is very important because he will push and provide a lot of support to complete the trip.
459,Biodiversity is the point,"I was making a 3 day trip out to KK from the Philippines and got obsessed with trying to figure out the logistics of climbing Mt. Kinabalu. I couldn't really afford the 2000 RM most websites were stating for a solo foreign pax like me, but reading some reviews I got hope that I could book the climb for cheaper at the park office.I woke up at 5:30am January 29 (monday) in KK and walked to Padang Merdeka hoping there would be a 6am shared van to Kinabalu Park.  Not much was going on at 6am, but walking through the area, a few drivers would ask me where i'm going.  I passed on a guy who offered to take me there privately for 120 rm.  I eventually met another driver who had plans to pick up other people along the way and told me 25 rm, but we have to wait for 1 other person. After waiting for about 10 minutes, he said we can go now if I pay 45 rm so I agreed.After 2 short stops along the way to Kinabalu park to pick up other customers, I arrived at the park around 8:30am. I made my way to the park office and asked if I could climb today and stay at the cheaper Lemaing Hostel. There didn't seem to be a problem and they charged me 419 rm which included the permit, hostel, and 3 meals. Score!  They were going to assign me my own guide, but I asked if I could share one.  They said I can wait for some more people to show up but i have to start the climb by 10am. Outside the office, there were several groups and I saw a pair of climbers who looked like they were by themselves. I offered to pay half the guide fee if we could share and they graciously accepted.The hike up was taxing, but I had trained walking incline on the treadmill with a 5kg weight in my backpack for 2 weeks.  The hike was not bad and I reached the hostel just before the rain.  This was crucial since, walking the next day with wet shoes and socks would have sucked.At the hostel, it was cold, about like 5c. There were quite a few people in the hostel and not so easily accessible hot water, so I didn't bother trying to bathe. I scarfed down 2 plates of dinner at the buffet at 4:30pm and passed out by 5pm.  Sleep was not the best as it's a shared hostel, cold, and I felt really filthy. Woke up at 12am cuz I couldn't sleep anymore and prepared for the push to the summit. Breakfast at 2am, and we started hiking at 2:30am. I reached the summit at 5:20am and caught a beautiful sunrise on top of Mt. Kinabalu. Excellent weather and visibility that day.Back down 3km to Laban Rata for another breakfast and then down 6km back to the park headquarters.Total Damage:45 rm taxi ride to the park15 rm park fee419 rm permit, lemaing hostel, 3 meals25 rm for snacks10 rm hiking pole rental12 rm locker storage at park26 rm gloves I bought at laban rata20 rm for 1.5L water and hot tea at laban rata55 rm buffet after hike at park10 rm certificate that I climbedTotal: 637 rm ~ $166 USDYou can cut some of those expenses as some were optional. The packages people buy include the buffet after the hike, packed lunch, and certificate.  But if you do it a la carte like me, there's the prices.Notable comments1. This was pretty tiring for me and not just the hike itself.  The waking up early 2 nights, crappy sleep, the cold shared hostel, wet bathroom floor, no toilet paper are not stuff I am rather comfortable with. I'm a bit spoiled.2. It rains every day here for a bit of time.  Wet shoes kinda suck the next day when reaching the summit3. It's cold at the top. You NEED gloves and a jacket. I wore shorts and i was fine though.4. Bring a flash light or headlamp5. I think the hiking pole is a must, but several/most people, didn't use one."
460,"Beautiful, but way overpriced","I was somewhat unclear on if climbing Mt. Kinabalu in 1 day was a realistic possibility.  Having done just 3 weeks ago, I can say that most of the reviews here are true.  Trekking up the mountain in one day is definitely feasible.  Just to reiterate a few points laid out below...1) Get to the park office at 7AM.  My group of 3 did not have reservations for climbing the mountain beforehand nor did we call the park office to confirm there was space for the day we intended to climb.  We did, however, get into the park right when it opened thanks to the convenient location of our hostel that we crashed at the night before (D'Villa).  At the office, we had to insist that we were able to do it and that we've were told by a reliable source it was possible.  5 minutes of that and we were signing the forms to climb.  I consider my situation somewhat lucky so call ahead of time.  The place fills up with 1 day climbers quickly (especially weekends) and 2-3 people per guide is ideal because of the cost.2) The climb itself is arduous, which is compounded when you climb in one day.  There is a time limit to reach Laban Rata but the more trying time cut-off is the second one that requires you to summit by 13:00. For reference, I'm an avid triathlete/marathoner, 26 years old, and was able to complete bottom to top to bottom in 8.5 hours.  That being said, I was exhausted afterward.Some may say that you need gloves to complete the last push for the summit above the tree line but if you're doing the one day climb, chances are that the ropes won't be that cold by the time you reach them (which is the main reason why people bring gloves) so don't worry about them.  Bring plenty of water and power bars.3) It does, however, get chilly at the top even for a single day climb.  I wore an under armor long-sleeve underneath by t-shirt the whole day and would choose that again.  4) It will most likely rain and be cloudy when you reach the summit.  My group reached summit and within 5 minutes was subject to a great amount of rainfall.  Made the trip down the mountain much more dangerous so I would advise to bring a good rain jacket and shoes that grip well (but nothing too trek-serious is required)All in all, it was a fantastic experience for a group of travelers looking for an economic alternative to staying at Laban Rata.  Enjoy"
461,tough but rewarding climb,Amazing views but cloud rolls in each afternoon during December so best set off early. Mountain roads twist and turn but go through some beautiful countryside.
462,Worth a climb at least once in your life,"It was so good when we managed to climb up to the summit,  (known as the Low's Peak) height at 4,095 metres (13,435 ft) above sea level, which is some 6 metres (20 ft) less than the previously thought and hitherto published figure of 4,101.  metres (13,455 ft).[3]"
463,Rewarding and Fulfuling,"We booked our trek through Amazing Borneo tours who sorted everything including transport, permits, mountain guide and accommodation.  The trek starts with lots of steps and a rocky terrain and a 6k trek.  You will need a walking stick, good shoes and take everything in your rucksack to stay one night and lots of water.  Lunch was provided but watch out for the squirrels! The views are amazing as you make your way up through the clouds up to base camp Laban Rata.  A buffet dinner is served with local food and then it's bed time in preparation for an early set off off for the summit. You will need warm clothes, gloves, hat, jacket and head lamp as the trek for the summit starts at around 2.00am in order to reach the top for sunrise. This part of the climb includes more steps, lots of rocks, parts where you use of rope to climb and pull yourself up.  Towards the top it's tough on your legs as it's a steep incline. As you climb the temperature drops significantly so wrap up.  Make sure you stay with your mountain guide for the best route. When you get to the top take lots of pics and wait your turn to take that special one right at the summit. Take in the view and then it's time to trek back down.  Tip: use energy gels, power bars and nuts to get you through when energy is low and the lack of sleep is catching up with you! Once back down to base camp it's time for some tea and toast before the rest of the journey back to the bottom.  This was a truly unforgettable experience with a massive sense of achievement of climbing the highest mountain in South East Asia!"
464,My Amazing Son,"Went there on a day trip. As non-climbers, you can scrambel across some short treks in the jungle, and check out the botanical garden. Great vistas of the summit if you are lucky."
465,Summit Mount Kinabalu-Not for the faint hearted!!,"If you are in Kota Kinabalu and enjoy a physical challenge I highly recommend doing this climb.  I really wasn't prepared for the difficulty since I knew it was just two days, one night and I am a relatively experienced climber (Kilimanjaro summit and Aconcagua camp 3).  It is a short climb but it is intense.  Unlike longer climbs there are very few ""breaks"" where you are not engaged in steep climbs.  And as you get higher you really do feel the altitude and lack of oxygen.  The climb to the summit begins around midnight and the average person gets to the summit in time for the sunrise which is truly spectacular.  The return is also stunning (depending on weather) but is probably (at least for me) the most difficult on the body because your knees will take the brunt of the impact.  Everyone stays in dorms which are adequate (they could use some cleaning but you won't care since you will be exhausted and just want to go to sleep).  The guides are luck of the draw.  Some are great and others really don't care.  I had the latter and every time I needed to stop for a break he would ask if I wanted to go back down.  Maybe there was something lost in translation though so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on that one.  Make sure you bring WARM clothes.  It get VERY cold as  you get to camp and also at night.  I wore everything I brought and was still freezing.  But be careful and limit how much you bring.  My backpack was 15kg and I was exhausted carrying that up.  If you are traveling solo and want to join with others make SURE to get there early.  I made that mistake and ended up having to pay for my own guide.  One final note...you will enjoy it much more if you are well trained.  I wish I had not taken it as lightly as I did because a focused training program would have allowed me to be less tired and better enjoy the climb."
466,I am in awe,"Mount Kinabalu is like a 9km set of stairs with decreasing oxygen as you ascend. Summiting at sunrise is stunning, genuinely, but if you do the lows peak via ferrata I’d recommend staying another night at pendant hut before descending. Amazing experience, IT band will hopefully recover soon."
467,Amazing view i have never seen before!!,"We all felt we achieved something special in climbing Kinabalu and watching the sunrise. Its a great experience, a solid 4-5 hours climb up to the rest house - numbers are limited on a daily basis. The mountain has well maintained paths, its clean and litter free, and the trip was well organised.  The final ascent is steep but don't go too early as it is cold at the top. The descent is rapid and left us hobbling around for days with stiff legs even though we are quite fit.  We climbed with 12 and 13 year old boys without any difficulties. A great family adventure."
468,Can't get enough of it..,A great visit to a great place. Heaven for mankind. Must see place if you visit Sabah. Best of God's creation that one must not missed.
469,Magnificent!,"Reaching the summit was indescribable. The journey upwards for 1.5 days was a struggle but the surrounding nature and positive energy made it possible to appreciate the whole experience. It feels very satisfying when you reach the top, you are up in the clouds, literally. The guides are inspiring and very caring. I definitely recommend"
470,Brilliant 10/10!,"Climbing Mt Kinabalu should not be taken lightly, it is definately a real challenge and especially for a young child. My daughter is 9 yrs old and fit and healthy and this trek tested her at all levels. I highly recommend you train before tackling the climb, your child will need to be resilient and determined because day 2 is a physical and mental challenge. Here are a few things to consider. Firstly there is no ATM within 10km of the Park, so go prepared and with a fat wallet of ringett. The nearest ATM is 10km which is about 40 ringett by taxi. When you arrive you wll be hit with numerous fees ie 15RM park entrance, 10RM for kids, climing will cost around 300 RM for two people and then there are the guide fees of $460 for an adult and a child. We went with lost of cash and got caught out by the fees. We stayed first night in Sutera but I seriously suggest you dont, it was a rip off despite the lovely location and views. There are a few places just outside the Park entrance where you can stay and taxi are cheap. We climbed with lots of warm clothes in anticipation and it still wasnt enough for my daughter, so go prepared, esp if it rains or is windy. The first day is hard but achievable, take water but tere are spots to get water along the way despite what Sutera tell you so you buy their water. We used poles and it was much better on the knees. The climb took us 5 hrs to Raban Lata. This lodge is very comfortable and the food is fine, there is a small shop to buy some basics including bottled water. Warm showers are available but when we were there many did not have such luxury. The summit climb starts at 0200 hrs and is very challenging, be prepared for a tough walk and its hard on children. My daughter had a headache, was cold and found it very tough but she pushed on and summitted. There are steep sections and some require ropes to help climb up the faces. There is no doubt that this is a real challenge for children and I found myself challenging whether I had asked too much of my daughter on sevral occasions - this is not for the faint hearted. Summitting was breath-taking and the views are just amasing. But the 8km descent is very hard and you need to pace yourself but moreso your child. I suggest some disolvable panadol for the headache as this debilitates a child, I also suggest taking energy bars and electrolite tables to dissolve in water to help with energy levels. We played word games all the way down and this helped distract her from the difficulties, take the time to rest at each hut if it suits, we decided on every second hut to keep pushing forward. From Raban Lata to the bottom took us another 5 hrs. Poles are a must, taken enough food for the descent because after breakfast you dont get any food to go back down, we prepared for this with scroggin but were starving by the time we got back to the Park entrance. There is a cafe in the Park and across the road, as well as a shop to buy junk food."
471,before i get too old,"This was a combined trip with the hot springs.  Nice drive and interesting to see the countryside once you got out of the hectic traffic of KK.  There was a brief look at an information place, then a short walk and over a catwalk.  The longer catwalk was under repair but the…"
472,Once in a lifetime experience,"I've trekked a few trails and summits but this has more constant steps than most.You must also be prepared to get very wet and with little or no means of drying out clothes or shoes at the lodge. Some of the trail turns into a shallow fast river when it rains, and it is rain forest so it should rain. But it's walkable. If it has been cloudy for some time you probably will not get a hot shower as they're solar.To avoid the que for photos at the summit I would start the ascent climb no later than 3am, that's if you want to try and catch the sunrise.The cost of the climb is expensive compared to others in Asia but you've got no choice if you want to climb the highest in Malaysia. If like us you struggle to get a confirmed booking your only other choice is to go through Jungle Jacks Backpackers and hope Jack can arrange for you. We had to wait two days to get a cancelation slot through Jack.Enjoy"
473,What an incredible adventure!,Went with another pal during early July with Amazing Borneo. To my understanding they offer higher end itinerary so the transports and stays were great. Not the cheapest but peace in mind.We booked for 3D2N package via Ferrata (lows peak circuit). Got picked up at our hotel in kk and to our first night stay at Kinabalu pine resort. Great place to stay but poor food selection(don't really get to choose. It's pre booked). Second day we start our ascent to pendant hut and everything was nicely organised for us. Dinner was a walk away from our place but it was SO good (and HEATED SPACE). Note that pendant hut is a non-heated dom so be prepared! Third day hike to the summit was simply amazing. Via Ferrata route on the way down was breathtaking. But be prepared to use up every ounce of your energy to descend down to timpohon gate afterwards. Incredible spread for lunch back at HQ (maybe I was too hungry:p).Our guide (Safrey) was absolutely wonderful. He was patient with us and helped us take some wonderful shots which only the locals would know as they're slightly off the white guiding rope (or you've done your research).Definitely recommend shoes with good grip (kampung adidas will be an excellent candidate -super cheap) as some places gets slippery. And warm clothing is a NECESSITY. Would definitely be back for another climb.
474,South East Asia Highest Mountain,W went on a day trip from KK and visited the Botanical Garden and Poring Hot Spring. A waste of time and money.I guess the best thing to do is to climb the mountain or do some day trekking if you do not have two days.
475,not completelly visit before see and come to mt kinabalu,"If you are into hiking, this is a great challenge.  We did this as a one-day up & back which is a pretty good physical challenge.  If you are doing it as one-day, make sure:1) Make sure you get to the park right at 7AM when it opens as there are time cut-offs (11:00AM at Laban Rata & 1PM at Sayat-Sayat)2) There are a limited number of day climber slots available, but no one seems to know the exact amount.  I talked to four different tour companies who said there were no slots before finding one who would take us.  Turns out, we were the only three on the day we did the climb.3)  This is a great hike in a great jungle and alpine environment on a truly big mountain (we could see it easily from ~100 miles away on Turtle Island).4)  You can overnight at Laban Rata Hut, but book early and be prepared to pay.5)  Advantage of day climb is that you don't see very many people.  You have the trail mostly to yourself except for occasional hut hikers coming down from the hut."
476,Great climb with nice scenery but getting more expensive to climb ,nice cool clean air. scenic drive. nice view of the mountains and surroundings. A pity  we had 2 kids or else I would have entered and climbed a little.
477,Be well prepared for the trip especially for 1st time Female Hikers! 2D1N trip.,"I done a few treks and this is very difficult. Almost as difficult as Torres Del Paine in Argentina.The issue is that you are ALWAYS going up. There is hardly any flat run where you go horizontal. The first 3 km is not too bad. Then at the 3km mark the trail turns into brown stones. Large stones and you step on them non stop going up. Tiring because they are not stairs, they are stone blocks of uneven height and stepping onto uneven surface. So you have to balance yourself all the top. Which is tiring without you realising it. You start at 9am or so. I arrive with most people to the lodge around 3pm. The mean of the normal distribution. Some ppl I heard arrive at 7-8pm when it is dark. This is really not good because the next day you have to wake up at 3am to start climbing again. And you need a good rest. The 2nd day is prob even harder, because you go up the summit then come down to the lodge. Have a quick lunch then make your way down backtracking your progress of the first day. I think by the time you go up to the summit and come down you are half dead with exhaustion. The lunch was a welcoming break but no way enough to prepare you for the long descent. My knees were shattered. I physically could not take one more step down without pain. It was painful going down every step. My toe nail had internal bleeding because on the way down you keep on bashing your big toe against the inside tip of your shoes. It was a painful experience. Advice: Do not come here in the wet season. The stones are slippery and I cant imagine what a crap experience it will be for you. On my way down it was raining. And it was quite unpleasant. But by then I didnt care because I was wet, stinky and sweaty already. But if it was raining on the way up, you will be slpeeing in wetness. The showers in the lodge is COLD. they are exo friendly and the heater is powered by solar panels. So no sun no hot water. I didnt take the cold shower. Went stinky for 2 days. I didnt care. You NEED A WALKKING STICK. I took one. And I wish I took two sticks. It will help you a lot on the way down where you can use your hands and arms to take some of your weight with every step. What else? YOU DO NOT NEED INSECT REPELLANT. I took one according to lonely planet and it was heavy. Every little thing becomes heavy when you are doing a long trek like that. FINALLY, YOU NEED TO KNOW IF IT RAINING THE SUMMIT WILL BE CLOSE. THIS MEAN YOU WILL GET THE HUT AND SLEEP THE NIGHT BUT YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO CLIMB TO THE SUMMIT BECAUSE THE STONES ARE SLIPPERY AND THE GATE TO THE SUMMIT WILL BE LOCKED. THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT COME HERE IN THE WET SEASON. BECAUSE YOU RISK PAYING $$$ ON FLIGHT, $$$ ON ACCOMMODATION, GO STINKY AND SWEATY UP THE FIRST DAY THEN TO BE TURNED BACK DOWN BECAUSE IT IS POURING. DONT DO  IT. COME IN DRY SEASON.Good luck. And dont take naked photos of yourselves like those stupid american youths who made the headlines. You will be castrated and zeus will strike you with lightning. Have respect."
478,Toughest but most worthwhile trek of my life,"First time climbing and didnt know what to expect. Good to do some research before setting off. Juz prepare the essentials. Its cold up there, bring winter clothing. If you are not a seasoned climber, engage the porter. The guide and porters were amazing. They made the trip colorful and memorable! Try to go with friends with the same level of fitness. Its definitely a great experience. Just do it and stop thinking about it!!"
479,Great trek,"Visited there about  a year ago, cold,bring jackets. As I did not plan to go up the mountain, I visited as a non-climber and walked around the area  a bit. The Mountain is always misty and it is hard to get a peak at the top(unless you are lucky), lots of lodges nearby to cool and relax.From KK it takes about 1.5 hours and the roads are great.."
480,An unforgettable experience,"Climbed Mount Kinabalu in January, took 2 days and 1 night up in Laban Rata. The climb up was extraordinary, beautiful flora (moss, ferns) and scenery on the hike up. The hike is very enjoyable, but got a bit challenging up the last kilometer to Laban Rata, as it is very steep and the air gets thinner. At this point, the weather turned sour, and the mountain was engulfed in clouds, blocking all views. This bad weather continued on, as well as pouring rain throughout the night, This sadly led to the cancellation of the final leg of the journey, to Low's Peak summit. I can only imagine how beautiful it is up there on a clear day. According to the guide, cancellations due to bad weather happen about 30days a year, mainly concentrated during the rainy season (Nov-Feb). We were just passing through at the time, so we climbed it anyway despite knowing the risks. I still give it high ratings as it's a stunning mountain, with breathtaking views and a satisfying climb. Will reclimb it the next opportunity I get.-Guides are mandatory-Raincoat and warm clothing-proper waterproof hiking shoes-waterproof bag cover, very likely to rain-there is decent reception at Laban Rata, for certain carriers (i was with Digi)-empty bottle, many chances to refill bottle along the way-ALL you can eat buffet at Laban Rata, one of the best bits-you have to be adequately fit to climb the mountain in good time"
481,"15 hour climb, memories for life","The hike will take 2days. We started around 9:00am on the first day. We walked up around 8km to the dormitory. We reached the dorm around 2:30pm. The second day, we started at 3:30am and reached the peak before the sunrise and the view from the top is magnificent!I would recommend to go up to the top as it is worth."
482,Worth every sweat!,"Was inspired by my friend and his wife to make this climb. Made arrangement way back in Feb with this company Green Trekkers. The owner Mdm Wong is super efficient. She managed all our expectations and more. Now about the climb. Please train. It is not that easy. The easiest part is from Timpohon to Raban Lata. We started at 8.30am and reached there at 1.30pm. The climb is mostly steps initially and as you climb higher, the paths become more treacherous with boulders etc.Food at Laban Rata is good. But it was impossible to have a good rest because of the wooden structure the hostel is made of. Every step and voices can be heard from the rooms even when it is locked. There is no hot water supply. The water is freezing cold!The ascent to the summit at 3am is very tiring. Hard to breathe in thin air. Had to rest every 10 steps or so. But the sunrise is breathtaking. Please take lots of pictures.The descent was tough for us too. The knees really felt like jelly by the time we reached Timpohon. Would we do it again? Not in the near future. Must train up if you want to enjoy the climb"
483,Exhausting but rewarding trip,"This was my third high altitude trek in last two years and one of the best and the memorable trek for me. With the support of Amazing Borneo we Five SL memeber crew have summited the Kinabalu during early march. One of the best and well organized trek route in the world. It was a 2 day trek for us. Enjoyed every step. First day it will take approx 4-5 hrs to reach the base camp for a small pacer. After having the dinner at 5.30pm you can witness the south East Asias best sun set from the base camp. 2nd Day summit climb starts at 2.30am. Early you starts, easy for you. Since you will climb in the dark won't be able witness the steep of the summit. But you will go stunned after seeing the route and the view while return. Sunrise was amazingly awesome and manage to take a lots of photos. Our guide Mr.Khan from Amazing Borneo team was very supportive and helpful. Perhaps very nice fellow, very humble and funny person too.Few tips for those planning to summit:1. Keep your own pace when you climbing, no matter for no one you don't need to increase the speed. 2. Don't carry much item, keep your back pack free and one water bottle would be sufficient as you get water supply almost every km.3. Rain court is a must4. Avoid taking altitude sickness medicine. Consume lots of water whenever you get time and train and make your self used to high altitude.5. Start your summit climb early as possible so you can have the amazing sunrise view and also avoid the congestion.6. Take rough gloves to handle rope. Stick would be also very helpful.7. Try to sleep early as possible after having the dinner at base camp.8. Head torch is must.9. Respect other fellow climbers on the go and avoid spending much time at the summit point.10.  Spend at least 1 hour at the summit as you don't get the view very often .Happy summiting! We thoroughly enjoyed our trip and wish you'll good luck."
484,excellent really enjoyed travelling,"Climbing Mount KK will not only test your physical strength but your mental strength. There are plenty of blogs and reviews that will tell you what to do and etc. but I found out many other things when I did my climb in May. 1. Spend money on a proper raincoat and windbreaker. Hiking 5 hours in the pouring rain in a RM5 raincoat will not suffice.2. Bring a hair dryer - it is useful in drying your wet clothes and everything that is wet. 3. Bring extra shoes - shoes does not dry fast. 4. Bring a BAG LOAD of happy thoughts and motivating material, you will need something to push you on the arduous hike up and down.5. Bring everything you need in case you get physically injured - knee and ankle guards, painkillers. 6. Know where are the rest stops and toilets on the trail so you can control your bowels and bladder. And when you are climbing to the summit (Laban Rata to Low's Peak), think about conserving energy for the hike down. Going down the mountain is equally physically challenging and mentally draining (you'll just want to be out of the jungle asap). My friends who exerted themselves on the Summit and injured themselves SUFFERED on the climb down Timpohon."
485,An absolute must when visiting Borneo,"This is literally uphill the whole first day so it's bloody tough but so rewarding. I wouldn't recommend it if you're not fit because we saw a lot of people struggling due to lack of fitness combined with altitude. The walk to the summit is awesome - combination of stairs, ropes and rocks but it's just so rewarding once you reach the top. The trek down is a breeze in comparison to the way up. We stayed at the Rock hostel and Laban rata on the way and they're both good hostels with your standard Buffett (fried rice, fried noodles, various meats etc) so you won't go hungry. Definitely recommend it if you're up for the challenge!"
486,Pick and choose wisely,"I think no one who has ever done the climb regretted climbing it. 2 things I learnt from the 2-day Mt Kinabalu expedition: 1. No matter how fit you are, you will struggle through the Mt Kinabalu climb (because everyone I encountered climbing up and on my way down all looked like they are struggling) 2. Anyone with average level of fitness can climb Mt Kinabalu, as long as you have a strong mind. The hike up to Laban Rata (did mine via Timpohon Trail) was not without struggle. Imagine hours of going up stairs, scaling over rocky terrain after rocky terrain. By the 4km, I was exhausted but it was either climbing 4km down back to the base or 2km up to the resthouse so I towed on. The terrain from the 4km mark onwards was a little rougher, no more steps but rather huge slabs of rocks. Along the way, fellow climbers (doing their descent) did not hesitate to give a friendly smile and told us to ""keep going"", ""only 2 more hours"", ""best of luck"" etc. I think their words of encouragement and smiles kept me going. Upon reaching the Laban Rata resthouse, we were told there would be no water in the facility due to the drought and water rationing. So it was wet-towel shower and powder bath for us all. We rested for a while, woke up for dinner at 5pm, then rested somemore before supper which is served at 2am. Unfortunately for us, the restaurant was rather full when we went down at 2am and so we had to queue for food, wait for a table to be available and by the time we set off, it was 3am. There was also a bottleneck at the mountains as we begin our cimb, coupled with fatigue and the very rough terrain (steep slopes and having to climb up a pretty long distance by pulling ourselves up via rope) plus the queue at the summit to take the shot-de-rigueur, we missed the sunrise (sunrise at 545am but we reached at 6am). So advice here is to start the summit climb early (2.30am). At one point, after the checkpoint, I had to take breaks every 30 steps or so because I was so tired. Do factor that into your timing if your fitness is average like me. And did I mention how beautiful the starry skies are as we climbed to the summit? I have never seen so many stars in my life before. That itself (and seeing the sky glow with the sunrise) made the exhaustion worth it. The climb down from the summit to Laban Rata was slightly easier, buoyed by high spirits after reaching the summit. The challenge for me personally was the descent, as my knees are rather weak. So hiking sticks are a must, though I think 1 instead of 2 is sufficient (use the other arm to grip to something more stable like rocks or tree trunks). It took me a longer time to descend than to ascend, because my knees were hurting so much just after 2km. So do wear a knee guard if you have weak knees, and try to train for the descent instead of just the ascent. Gear wise I went up with Salomon trekking shoes, dri-fit singlet and dri-fit long pants, armed with a light fleece jacket, uniqlo heat-tech top and socks (for resthouse as it was not heated and for summit which can be rather cold) and a goretex jacket. And a hiking stick, of course. Backpack I found that my 22L Black Diamond bag (which has pocket for water reservoir and tube) did a good job of containing everything whilst not being too heavy, though I have groupmates who went up with smaller bags. Ziplock bags proved to be very handy in ensuring everything stays compact. Training wise I only began the month before the climb, going to Bukit Timah weekly to train. It gives you a pretty good idea of the terrain you will get in Mt. Kinabalu, just bear in mind that Bukit Timah is only 100 over metres high and Mt. Kinabalu is 4095 metres high. In other words, the first 4km terrain is similar to Bukit Timah, just that it goes on and on and on, and the last 2km and climb to summit is mainly boulders and rock surfaces. It helps to train on staircases too, by taking 2 steps at one go. And don't forget to train for the descent!"
487,Amazing,"After reading other travelers reviews before attempting the hike to the summit of Kinabalu,  I thought it was going to be a relatively moderate hike.This however was not true, and is not a good hike for those that are out of shape or not accustomed to altitude. The hike itself…"
488,Once in a lifetime experience,"We did the 2D1N MOUNT KINABALU CLIMB WITH FERRATA (LOW'S PEAK CIRCUIT). This was one of the most incredible experiences. We absolutely loved it. We booked through Amazing Borneo Tours and were happy with everything. We got our own guide who was really good and walked with our pace. The lower part of the mountain is very well prepared with wooden steps (lots and lots of them). You go through different types of terrain and the scenery in parts is amazing. A highlight was definitely watching the sunrise from the peak…. spectacular. Bring warm clothes, it is absolutely freezing and very windy at the top!  To those fussy eaters bring our own lunch and snacks for the climb as the lunch food provided is basic and not the best, but we were very positively surprised by the dinner at the Laban Rata Restaurant. The food there was really delicious. My husband had a huge headache from the altitude so don‘t forget to bring some pills if you know you will struggles with the altitude.When you arrive at the Pendant Hut…have a shower immediately if you want hot water… I was one of the last and had to shower with ice cold water :(Although I am very afraid of heights, I loved the Low's Peak Circuit via ferrata. Lots of people actually decided not to go ahead and do it when they arrived to the spot. It‘s quite intimidating when you first start the abseil but then the adrenaline kicks in and although very scary its such an incredible experience. What we didm‘t realise is that the lows peak circuit takes about 3-4hr so for those that know they won‘t be able to manage this after the hike to the peak go for the shorter option or skip it altogether cause if you pay for it and then decide not to do it you won‘t get your money back...I highly recommend planning in a few days to relax after the climb. Your whole body (especially your legs) will be sore after this climb and the long via ferrata… Walking up and down step the days after seemed impossible :)"
489,Wonderful Hot spring,The best place ever for hiking. No any other hills or mountains I hike before can compare with Mount KK. Hiking was comfortable as the air was fresh and cool. You will notice there different kind of plants in different altitude during your hike. Saw many Korean aunty and uncle able to make it to the peak of Mount KK. Don't give yourself excuses and train hard. Must visit here at least once in a life.
490,"Challenging, rewarding, worth every muscle ache and drop of sweat!","The climb was tiring for a normal level of fitness person like me - did not train much before attempting this feat, but I wish I had, because after km 5, was dreading the uphill climb!!! The ascent to the peak was challenging for me, but the view of the sunset over a sea of clouds was magnificent and worth the agony getting there. Winds were strong throughout the ascent, so be prepared for negative temperatures (who knew it could be so cold in tropical Malaysia?!). A must do in Sabah, but train before you go, so suffering is minimised. Tip: Bring some teabags/milo/coffee and sugar to Laban Rata and enjoy a nice hot drink when you arrive (tea at the rest house is RM12.80, USD4, and hot water is free!)"
491,Amazing !!!!,A great day out and ideal if you are wanting to escape the hunidity and in need of some relaxation. Would have preferred a better map and and hence able to explore with more confidence. Botanical gardens were a little disappointing.
492,Reached the summit on my 1st attempt,"My wife and I (both 48 and relatively fit) both made it to the summit which was one of the most amazing experiences of our lifetime. You have to rise early (2am) but you're in bed early the night before because you are knackered after the 6km climb to the guest house (we were in bed at 7). Be ready for the walk out - 11km in one day, 2.5km to summit, 2.5km back to guest house and then 6km down. It was a struggle but we made it. And now all we remember is the summit :)"
493,Bit of heaven n hell but worth every second,"We didn't get to summit Mount Kinabalu due to the damage to the trails following the earthquake earlier in 2015 but we did get to trek in the foothills and it was amazing. We were surrounded by fruit trees - durian fruit, jack fruit and star fruits were in abundance.  We came across a beautiful waterhole and had a swim in the gently flowing water which was refreshing after the hot trek.Some parts were very steep but if you're relatively fit and take things at your own pace and wear good walking boots then you should be fine. My two young boys at 11 and 9 managed it well although we were only trekking for a few hours and didn't get too high.Mount Kinabalu is a must see if you are visiting Borneo, I would highly recommend"
494,3rd attempt to Mt KK,"The hardest thing that we have ever done in our lives. We are distance runners and cyclists but still the climb (and the descent) was extremely hard for us. (This was also my love's 5th mountain.)They advertise that no training is required but it really is amust. It's a good thing that we trained by going up and down 40 flight of stairs but still it was not enough. Try to actually climb hills or other mountains. The terrain is really tricky and dangerous and the climate so unstable. One minute it's sunny and the next it's raining hard. It's very, very cold up there. Make sure to bring fleece jackets and thermals because the rooms don't have heaters. Bring a raincoat and extra gloves. The climb to the summit is 8.7km. The trail is a combination of very few  clear paths and combination of mud stairs, rock stairs, wooden stairs and big rocks. Some parts are very steep that you literally have to be on all fours. It was already raining hard when we reached Pendant Hut, we were soaking wet, cold and dead tired that we slept after the briefing. Hence, we were not able to have our dinner (which was a hassle to take as well because he venue is at Laban Rata).The accommodation is very bare, no heater and it was so cold up there. Hardship aside, the mountain is very very beautiful indeed. The environment is protected and it is just green all over. We're so happy to have reached the summit. Nothing beats preparedness!"
495,"Very good walk, few things to consider","Climbing Mt. Kinabalu is great experience if you are fit, otherwise can probably become a nightmare (as we could see on the faces of many fellow climbers). We were lucky with the weather both days, so we were rewarded with the beautiful sunrise which we enjoyed so much even though it was really cold. It was so windy that even five layers of clothes didn't help much, especially when we had to wait almost an hour for the sun to come up. On the second day we started climbing at 3am (among the last), but it was still too early and we had to wait for the sunrise quite some time. Luckily the guide was really patient even though it seemed he was freezing as well. Don't forget to spare energy for the descent as it was much tougher then going up, especially for the knees."
496,No regret!!,"There were 2 main reasons to Climb Mount Kinabalu in One Day. 1. Money2. Challenge Apparently the cheapest you can get it for 2 Days 1 night is RM640 (US$206) per person. We paid RM375 for 2 people including all Fees, Permits & a Private Guide! (US$60 each)Make sure you contact, ideally call Park HQ 2 days in advance (more in Peak Season) to book your Guide. The ClimbThe climb is tough! But don't be put off by people telling you it's impossible unless you are extremely fit. I don't smoke, or drink much but neither do I do lots of Excercise! & I completed the climb up & down in under 7 Hours. I am 21 & my boyfriend is 24 but there were people of 40 who made it too! If you are up for the Challenge, want to save yourself some money & do believe you can do it in one day, you should give it a go! Make sure you check with Park HQ the weather forecast for the afternoon of your climb. You may well get caught out by rain & will have to turn around, no refund! But you don't pay until the morning of your climb. However this could happen during a 2 day climb aswell! We had a really amazing time! You could too! Marte & Max (Dutch & Welsh)"
497,A big rip-off unless you do it in one day,"Awesome ever changing views from tropical to sub trop ending with massive granite outcrops. The sunrise was amazing and worth the wait. Don't climb too fast, waiting for the sunrise at the peak is not fun as temperature was 7 degC !"
498,Amazing!,"Very exciting but challenging, one of the best trips ever"
499,My biggest mental and will effort ever!,"The trek itself was pretty exciting on the way up , not much to see other than your usual nice views and the occasional banter with climbers heading down .Once at the summit its the sense of achievement that makes it worth while .The trek down i found a bit harder and not as fun .Overall worth doing ."
500,Superb experience - and with a 9 yr old,"it is a fantastic place. great mountain for the fit and younger, many trails for older folks and not so fit, at least enjoy the fresh air and look out for beautiful birds. I will come again."
501,Physically demanding but worth every ounce of pain,"Having heard from others who have climbed Mount Kinabalu before and reading about how this is one of the easiest mountain to climb despite its height (this is because there are mainly steps and ropes etc for beginners/amateurs like me), I did a 2 days 1 night climb up Mount Kinabalu recently. This was an interesting but tiring experience. Climbing to 4,095 metres above sea level was no easy task, even though we started at Park HQ Timpohon which was approximately 1,800m above sea level, but I had trained for it. My only concern was altitude sickness given how high this mountain was. But thank God I only had a minor headache which dissipitated when I started climbing to the peak from Laban Rata where we stayed for the night. We started the climb to the peak from Laban Rata around 2.30am so that we could be at the peak to watch the sunrise (not that everyone managed to make it to the peak in time for the sunrise though - it is more important to walk carefully and still reach the peak rather than trying to rush for the sunrise and risk injury). I booked my tour package with Kinabalu Heritage Tours and Car Rental which turned out to be a good move and dealing with Sabrina and Charles was great. My mountain guide Fazali (Faizal??) Jhony was really helpful, carrying my backpack for me (for a fee as per the scheduled rates), and taking photos for me. He even showed me where to find pitcher plants and showed me where to walk/climb where I ws unsure (being able to speak Malay was an advantage). Reaching the peak gave a sense of achievement  And the view along the way was great"
502,"""Climbing Mt Kinabalu is tough- but achievable""","We had a lot of rain, fog and general coldness and yet the views were still great.  Above the tree line the landscape looks like what you'd expect on Mars.  We did the 2 day/1 night climb to the peak without Via Ferrata.  I wasn't well conditioned or prepared so the hike and logistics were more painful than they had to be.  My sense is if we had better weather, had been in better shape and brought all of the right clothign and equipment this would have been a once-in-a-lifetime awesome hike.  As it was, I'm enjoying the experience more in retrospect than while I did it.  In my mind I knew it was an awesome time but it was hard to appreciate with all of the strain and discomfort and I've got a high rusticity tolerance.CONDITIONINGDay 1 was 6 hours of relentless up hill starting from high altitude and going to to 1500M higher altitude. Day 2 started at 230A and was 4 hours of fairly renuous, technical climbing (ropes and lots of scrambling).  The fatigue, altitude, minimal sleep, darkness and cold combine for a bit of peril. I learned I have sub-par balance which mean I had to be especially cautious and vigilant in the dark on the way to the peak.  The hike down was without question the 2nd most painful (Thorung La was 1st but not by much) I've experienced so far.  Getting back to Laban Rata took 2.5 hours and required more concentration than the way up.  The clouds cleard on the way down so the view was spectacular.I expected the hike down from Laban Rata to be easy which is probably why it sucked so bad.  It was definitely the hardes part of the hike for me.  We walked most of the 6K in pouring rain and my legs were toast.  As we passed hikers coming up it made me feel sick to think of what they had ahead of them for the next 24 hours.  We took the exact same path down that we took up but I'm almost positive it was twice as long and 3 times as steep on the way down.  The 1 smart thing we did (despite my arguing against it) was spend the night prior to the hike at altitude near the park.  There are much better hotel options in KK but I'm glad we traded a nice, reasonable hotel in KK for a lousy, over-priced lodge near Tymphon Gate at high altitude.  The altitude was challenging but probably not nearly as tough as it would have been had we driven out from sea level the day of the hike.CLOTHING & EQUIPMENTIt was wet and cold and I didn't prepare well for that.  First, I didn't pack with rain in mind so all my cloths were soaked when we reached Laban Rata, which is very cold and has no heating plus there's not way to dry anything.  If I had simply packed everything in plastic bags I would have been comfortable.  2nd big miss was not packing gloves.  It was near freezing during the early morning hike plus you have to climb ropes and use your hands to scramble up the mountain.  By the time I reached the top I couldn't feel my fingers and my hands were blue.  3rd miss was a waterproof cover for my pack. I've never used walking sticks but I bet they would have made walking the stops and rocks signficantly easier on my quads and joints.  If I could do it again I would have brought a set.SCENERY AND ATMOSPHEREWe had fog at the peak so we didn't get a sunrise but the view on the way down was nothing short of aweseome. As you walk down you can see a chunk of Borneo through the clouds out to the sea with a mixture of mountains, forests and towns.  The face of Mt. Kinabalu that you're walking is severe and desolate which is unique vs. any landscape I've seen. The hike to/from Laban Rata is wet and mossy.  It reminded me a little of hikes on teh Olympic Pennisula.  I think it would have been very enjoyable had I not been so sore, tired, wet and cold due to poor training and prep.All in all, I can't say I really enjoyed the Mt. Kinabula hike.  I'm glad I did it but it pretty much sucked for all but a couple of hours while I was doing it.  The couple of hours were great but not great enough to justify the huge mass of suckiness that surounded them.  I've done several epic hikes over the years, a couple for which I was similarly poorly prepared, but this is the first I'd say I didn't enjoy.  That said, if I had trained for 3 weeks in advance and planned well I'm confident it would have been a delightful experience even with the foul weather we had."
503,A Achievable Feat Worth Recollecting,"Go there take time. make the long jungle trail. we did the trail on our own. you will be surprised by nice nature but literally no animals and insects at higher regions. its a bit challanging because the trail is a ... trail. a lot up and down small steps or no steps. if you are keen on climbing do the mountain climbing tour, take warm clothes gets really cold up there. going up and down is fast. you go to a basecamp stay there over night and start early morning to go to top. not too exhausting. after that you climbed the highest mountain in SE Asia."
504,Reached the summit at Mt Kinabalu,"This is my second time climbing Mt Kinabalu and this time, I managed to reach the peak. Yay! Four months of weekend jogging finally paid off and this time I didn't let the cold and leg pain hinder my climbing. For first time climber, I urged you to walk slow and steady, but don't take more than five minutes rest in the shelter. The view as you ascend will change, so take lots of picture. Unfortunately, only one complaint I would like to make which is guests in Gunting Lagadan Hut (mainly Chinese) tend to talk too loud at night, and this can easily disturb other sleeping guests. The early morning climb can be difficult to some people as you will battle with chilly wind, leg pain and breathing difficulty as you ascend. So my advice is walk slowly and take few breaks because when you reached the summit, you can sit there as long as you want to enjoy the sunrise. The peak can be crowded, and I urged climbers to be patient and courteous with each other. Have patient with other climbers if they take too long to take pictures or suddenly cutting your line. There's no need to be unkind and muttering your complaint.Be sure to check out Low's Gully as you ascend because the view awed me."
505,"Rent walking sticks, bring raingear - and be FIT!!!","It was tiring, but the view and experience was well worth it.. Being prepared makes the experience that much more enjoyable, so train for it."
506,Be prepared!,"Mount KK was my first solo trekking trip. Nevertheless , i have done extensively research before i embark on this trip As many other have said ,be prepared physically (at least some uphill practices for an average Joe with decent fitness will do)and mentally or prepared to get pwned by mother nature. The mesilau trail is recommended for photo taking as the trail covers across more different type of terrains & much easier to trek compared to Timphon trail which consist of only up slope flight of steps.The road to/from summit is difficult but you can the following things to distract yourself.1. throw away your watch2.focus only on your goal - to get the summit.3.dont monitor your trail progress-  but stop by to appreciate nice scenery and remember to take pictures around you before continue your journey4.stop to rehydrate- and don't sit too long as you may get leg cramps5.progress slowly when you at higher ground to catch your breath n prevent yourself from getting AMS. you are not joining competition so don't rush to play catch up . after all, you are challenging nobody but yourself.6.have a chat with your friendly n helpful mountain guide along the way if they can communicate well in English. it always good to understand their culture from locals. besides they are always happy to share with you their experience as a guide.If you are a nature lover or adventurous type, wasting yr lower limb  is a just small price for the challenge( to overcome all odds) and the achievements you get to the summit for a glorious sunrise in your life.As the saying goes take nothing but photographs , leave nothing but footprints, keep nothing but memories- I highly recommend this mountain for first-timer who want to challenge themselves.just get ready your body and your mind,equipment list and you be fine.Having said that , I would like to say hi to the 4 thai ladies who shared the same room with me during 20  to 21 June .Lastly , kudos to my mountain guide , Mr Henry for his professionalism . He has been a  great companion during my trip especially the last 1 km downhill."
507,Best mountain I've ever hiked!,"The views are breathtaking, the landscape changes significantly throughout the climb, however it is not cheap to get the permit and license to reach the summit."
508,Thought it would be easy but I was wrong,"Lovely scenery, good walk up through the rainforest to a canopy walk.  Amazing to see such a variety of vegetables grown on the mountain sides - not what we would have expected."
509,Going up is the easy bit,"Me and my girlfriend did this hike on the 4th & 5th of January 2017. We are both mid 30's, she is fit but I am a little out of shape. Still made it to the summit in decent time and without any training. It's not as easy as some people make out but it's also not as hard, the first hour of each day are the hardest and the altitude can cause a few problems with breathing and heart rate - but the views and the feeling of achievement are well worth it. A few tips, be smart with your layers. It's very hot at the bottom and cold at the top. A thin rain coat is advisable as it can be raining when in the hot parts. Ear warmers would have been great as the wind is chilly on your ears near the top but you can still feel hot so might not want to wear a hat. You need 2L of water from bottom to Laban Rata (rest house 2/3rds up) 2L from Laban Rata to Summit and 2L for the descent. Get some good hiking boots with ankle support, it's very easy to roll an ankle on the way down. Take plenty of high energy snacks, you will need a boost every 1 km - cashew nuts, energy bars chocolate etc. Finally man up and get cracked on, YOU CAN DO IT !!!! :)"
510,This is how we spent our wedding anniversary! [Climbers batch 13-15 Sept 2013],We went there on the 2nd of July 2018.it was a wonderful trip. Went there early at 7am plenty of parking available in the park. The receptionist was late on that day to register us for the mountain climbing but it was OK. Plenty of rest stops available on the way up to the top. Beautiful weather and scenery. Mountain guide was professional enough to guide us for the entire journey from the bottom to to the top and to bottom again. The view on the top was amazing. Worth all the trouble going up. Thumbs up!
511,"Pretty easy if you are fit, but muscles will ache later","Me 50y, wife 45y and children 13 and 15 did this trip in aug 2013. We left the gates at around 8.45pm and arrived at about13.45pm which we understand is about average considering our group. We had good weather this stretch and although a hard climb we enjoyed it. Rest of the climb was about the same as others described. Laban Rata dorm is only so so, but well organized. The climb from Rata to the top is tough and in the dark. When you descend this stretch indaylight you see how dangerous this can be. It was raining on the slate rocks and it was slippery. My wife was scared going down, I helped my daughter down, so it was a good thing our guide helped my wife. If you slip and fall you are dead. Ofcourse there is a rope you should hold on to, but you must be able to pull up your bodyweight. Expect to slip a couple of times descending, also from Rata downwards. There have been several accidents on the mount. Its a hard climb, come well prepared (headlight, footwear, raincoat, gloves, hat). If you are fit and take care, you should be ok. If you scare easily and are not prepared, think again. If you make it up and down, its an experience never to forget. Afterwards we had many laughs because we had so much muscle ache for about 4 days. We could not reach our shoe laces and even the curb seemed so high we had to step on it sideways."
512,amazing,"Myself and my wife did this as part of a 3 month trip.This is a must do in Borneo and well worth the money.  The views and the change in scenery on the journey up makes all the effort well worth it.  Also the sense of achievement at the end adds to this.The guides are a bit mixed, when he felt like it ours was helpful and gave us information, however once we passed another group he would happily just wander off and chat to their guide and disppear before catching up with us.I am generally fit and play a lot of sport but had been away for 3 months of drinking and little exercise so was slightly worried that I would struggle.  More importantly I also have a chronic knee injury which means I struggle to do too much without a rest.  However, personally although its not something I would describe as easy there was never a point where I even considered we wouldnt make it to the top and thought it would be harder than it was.  We also took many breaks and still were back at the bottom several hours before the first bus was due to leave as were several others.  So even if we were really struggling we would have had about 6 hours etc more till the last bus left to get down.The altitutude does become to be a problem near the top but for me the change in tempreature was more of an issue, the bottom being 35 degrees and the top close to freezing, so packing the right clothing is very important."
513,The summit climb isn't to be joked about,"We went there in Oct 2011. The weather is just nice. We went up using the Mesilau Trail,it's an 8km climb. I'm a very slow climber, so when we started climbing at 8.30am, i only reach Laban Rata at 6.30pm.  The Mesilau Trail has beautiful scenary and i never regret using the trail eventhough it's a long way up.  When i reach there, i ate at the cafe (Sutera Habour) and the food was nice.  We slept at the dorm in Gunting Lagadan and woke up at 2 am to start climbing to the top of Mount Kinabalu. But i was half way up, but i cannot continue and had to go down. I was upset but i think i got altitude problem, that prevents me from breathing properly. so after all my friends reach the top,they went down back to Laban Rata, we had our breakfast before going down the mountain. We used the Timpohon Trail which s only 6km down. The Trail was a bit steep and there are a lot of stairs. We started going down at around 11am and reached Kinabalu Park at around 3.30pm. We had our late lunch at the Kinabalu Park Cafe and that's the end of our journey. As from my experience, i really encourage visitor to climb the Mount Kinabalu because it's a life-worth experience."
514,Woweeee - don't under estimate the climb !!,"I came across a photo of the view at the summit a few months back and I was ""Wow! I wanna go there!"" And so I did.I booked my trip with Amazing Borneo. It's a fantastic tour agency. They were efficient and quick to respond to my queries that I sent via email. Their driver that picked us up was also really friendly and outgoing. He shared with us his knowledge and experience of the area. His friendly engagement with us got my friend and I into a really good holiday mood. We ascended the mountain via Mesilau trail. It was about 2km longer but the view and experience was wonderful. It was also much less crowded than Timpohon route. We met only about 10 other hikers for the 6km stretch.There are a few great picture points along the way; waterfalls and views of the mountain. There were many ups and downs along the route and the high altitude made us take many breaks along the way. Our 60 year old guide showed no signs of fatigue or breathlessness throughout and was patient with our slow pace. In all, It is worthwhile to take the Mesilau trail for its scenery.It took us about 8 hours to reach Laban Rata Resthouse. Meals at the lodge were buffet. The variety was reasonable given the fact that the lodge was inaccessible by vehicles and all the food had to be carried up by porters. There were choices of rice, noodles, 2-3 types of meat and dessert. We had early breakfast at 2am before setting off for the summit at 3am. At night, temperatures fall to below 10 degree Celsius and it gets even colder towards the summit with the strong winds. Warm clothing is necessary. A head lamp is also essential to illuminate your path as you require your hands to hold on to the rope to pull yourself up along steep areas.It took us about 3 hours to reach Low's peak. The view from above was spectacular with the rising sun shining over the sea of clouds. There's a sense of achievement as you take a photo with the sign ""Low's peak"" at the top.In conclusion, it was a great experience and I would strongly recommend to friends to try it. Especially for those staying in the Southeast Asia region, it is just nearby and doesn't have to be an expensive holiday. It's a proud memory that you would never forget."
515,"Amazing, book far in advance","We did the 2D1N and signed up for the Via Ferrata. We are both pretty fit, but not experienced climbers.It's tough! I felt the altitude by the end of the first day - fortunately was better the next day. We had a time constraint the 2nd day, which is a BAD move - we made it down by 1.30pm, but we were exhausted. We didn't do the Via Ferrata in the end.However, doing the Via Ferrata means you stay in the Pendant Hut, which as far as I could tell is the nicest place to stay - free tea & coffee, hot showers and guest crocs/slippers to wear. So I would pay the premium again! There are 2 Via Ferratas - a long and a short, so be specific when you book!"
516,One-Day Climb - All you need to know,"Was a nice trip, but easy to go and therefore would be no guide needed. However you are obliged to go with a guide."
517,Oh the pain!,"Hiking hill or mountain is not my cup of tea. Somehow back in 2014, i took the challenge to hike with my sister taking the Mesilau trail (before the quake ). The first 0.5km is easy .. as we ascend to the top, we sound more and more like Bart Simpson ( repeatedly saying “ Are we there yet?” 😅😅). After being Bart, we ask ourselves .. why are we torturing ourselves??? Almost giving up but our mountain guide encourage us not to give up, just keep moving, moving, moving( hmmm.. he sounds like Dory from Nemo 🤣🤣)......At last we made it. No words can describe, just climb and see for yourself. 😘I still remember what my mountain guide ( we are close friend now 😝) told me, he said after this you gonna climb again because you will miss the mountain. I said neh.. I won’t. True enough I do miss Mount Kinabalu. Now climbing/hiking/ talking about Mount Kinabalu .... my favorite!!!.p/s: Do wear proper clothing/gear before you climb. It’s cold up there."
518,Kinabalu in a day,"It takes a couple of hours to get there but worth it, especially if the flower is in bloom, a visit to the hot springs a out an hour further on is well worth it good to put your feet in the hot water."
519,Tough.,"A long overdue post. But the arduous-ness of the climb and tough weather (gail wind and torrential rain) is what makes this trek memorable. Do not, i repeat, do not underestimate this mountain. You need to train before coming here. Do stairs climbing (best to carry weights) and running reguarly before you attempt this mountain. Hire a porter (your guide could double up as one) to carry some of your belongings while you carry the essentials needed for this trek (water, poncho,light snacks,warm clothing that you can layer on along the way). Try to enjoy the scenery along the way, the terrain changes as you scale upwards. When feeling breathless or nauseous, do slow down to allow your body to acclimatize. The 2nd day climb from laban rata to the peak is even tougher as you wake up at 1am to do the trek in pitch dark. Invest in a good headtorch. The rocks can be slippery. Wear what the local people wear - kampung adidas, a black rubber boots. It has saved me from many potential slips and falls. In spore,you can buy kampung adidas opp Army market. Invest in warm clothings. I wore a long john, t shirt, sweater and a wind breaker. This is simply not enough. I had frost bite on my hands and was shivering non shop. A once in a lifetime experience. Do this when you are young. Although age should not stop you either as i saw young kids and elderly in their 50-60s going more steady than I do."
520,Great intro for amateur hikers,"Once arrival and paid different fees (and they are many), we started the climb. For some info on their reservation have a guidebook. So we divided the sum by the number of participants which was very advantageous especially Ue guide is useless. In fact there are more security guards for the morning and the final ascent. They are however very friendly and give us nice info if we take the time to look. The accommodation is rather basic but clean enough. There are blankets for the night so no problem cold. For cons, the climb to the summit the next morning very early, really expect very warm clothing and gloves. We were particularly frozen forcing us down and thus leave the top quicker than wanted and desired. Even the camera was acting up. Important thing: the shower is frozen! The food is good and plentiful. The climb is quite difficult especially the last kilometers. The descent is also difficult. Prepare before you do this activity ;-)"
521,I did not give up!,"amazing,easy to booking save time and money,trasport in time and comfortable, staff friendly and helpful.the arrangement and schedule of trip are in time no need to wait,the food are very nice especially the hot soup,saladarenice too."
522,This is worth what you paid and all the effort you putting in,A view is a view but not this one. This is a staggering view. We drove up and enjoyed view and restaurant/coffee house. However- it is not uncommon to miss view and summit due to cloud. All tall places have the same issue. It can be sunny at the bottom and cloudy at the top. Just have to take your chance.
523,don't underestimate the mountain!,"We climbed Mt Kinabalu in September, as part of a 2 day, 1 night package which included a Via Ferrata climb. The package was booked with Amazing Borneo (separate review on that company).  In short it was amazing and we couldn't recommend it highly enough. Full details below!The first climb - the climb took us approx 4 hours in total. We were told that this was slightly quicker than average. We wanted to move slightly faster as we had to arrive by 3pm for the Via Ferrata safety briefing (otherwise we couldn't do it!). The scenery, climate, and views change constantly, and this helps pass the time on the climb.  There are different animals and plants along the way. There are 7 shelters along the way, for you to stop and take a break. We missed the first 2 shelters as we wanted to crack on, but in hindsight there is no hurry and plenty of time to take 10-15 at each stop. Overnight stay - the overnight lodge is basic, but comfortable and fit for purpose. We had a nice surprise of a hot shower, having expected no hot water. Because we did Via Ferrata, we stayed in a smaller lodge slightly up the mountain; anyone doing the regular climb stays in the bigger main house. We stayed in bunk beds in a room of 8 people. Sleeping bags were provided.  You are sent to bed early with lights out at 8pm, but by that point everyone is ready for bed anyway due to tiredness and anticipation. The only advice we have here is that it was very cold overnight, so take layers to keep you warm (e.g. Some trousers, jumper or fleece, warm socks etc). The summit - we set off at 3am.  The weather sounded horrendous from the lodge. There was some doubt as to whether we would be allowed up to the summit at all, but once we set off we realised it wasn't as bad as it sounded. The climb to the summit was, at first, just a queue of people climbing stairs. But after a while the landscape spread out and before long we couldn't see any other climbers, lights or torches at all. The climb was dark, steady, wet and windy. But the feeling is great when you turn off your torches and you stand in silence, you cannot see or hear a thing expect for the whistle of the wind. The weather was cloudy but this cleared at be summit for around 45 mins. The views at the top are amazing. Words and photos cannot put into perspective the sheer, vast landscape. It was well worth the climb and the best thing we did in Borneo. We sat at the top for almost an hour, just soaking up the views. Via Ferrata - as part of our package we did a Via Ferrata climb. This is essentially a playground on the side of the mountain, e.g. Abseil sections, rope ladders, rope bridges, steep climbs, etc. But you are always clipped in with cables and always with a guide. The course is fun but very safe. By being clipped in you have 2 safety nets to hold you at all times. We did the beginner course, Walk the Torq, and this was ok for someone with a fear of heights!  It is well worth doing as an added extra, if you have the time. The descent - we raced down in under 2 hrs 45 mins, but really felt it the next day(s) in our legs. We would definitely recommend taking it much slower, and using the rest points!Fitness - realistically anyone with at least an average fitness level can do this. We would consider ourselves quite fit (run and cycle a lot) and we found it fairly easy. I think even if you don't exercise regularly and aren't massively overweight you could do it. Ultimately you have as much time as you want to complete the climb, so can go very slow and do it in 8-9 hours if you want. But this isn't suitable for children, the elderly, or people with bad injuries/health problems. Altitude - it seems like altitude sickness affects everyone differently.  We saw one person being carried down the mountain on a stretcher, which our guide told us was due to AS. And whilst on our way up we met a couple on their way down who said they got bad AS overnight and didn't even bother trying to reach the summit. But of all the people we climbed with everyone was generally fine. Obviously being at altitude gets your breathing and goes to your head a little bit, and almost everyone got this. We likened it to a mild hangover. Anyone who has been skiing at 3000m+ will have felt it. It seems like the only ways to avoid/minimise AS are:- staying at altitude before the climb, if you have time to do the 3D 2N package;- climb slower, so you slowly acclimatise to the altitude (we didn't do this!).Gear and equipment - we were told to limit our bags to 6-8kg, and so were worryingly weighing and repacking the bag the night before. We left with 7kg each, and ended up using every item we took with us. Essential gear is:- waterproof coat and trousers (in case of rain) and waterproof gloves;- warm hat and face cover for the 3am summit (it's cold and windy at the start!);- warm jumper, trousers and socks for the the sleep;- head torch;- walking boots (sports shoes may be ok, but if rainy and slippery waking boots would be much better).Food and drink - basic lunch, dinner and breakfast is provided, but we recommend taking some energy food to keep you going (e.g. Cereal bars, dried fruit, nuts, chocolate, sweets, biscuits). Water is available at the 7 stations, but is unfiltered so you may want to take purification tablets. We took a camelbak pouch which worked really well. Weather - the weather changes from sweltering heat, to damp and humid, to cold and raining, to ferocious wind, and everything in between. So that's why you have to go prepared. Also be prepare that if the weather is too bad you may not be allowed to summit. This is a risk you have to take. Summary - well worth the climb, an amazing experience and stunning views, the best thing we did Borneo. But make sure you go prepared."
524,Good experience,"If you are reasonably fit & bonkers enough to hike all the way up to 4095 meters just to see the sunrise & breathtaking mountain views, then you got to go climb Mt. Kinabalu at least once in your life.  We all have different reasons why we climb but if you like nature or just some physical challenge or both, don't give this a miss unless you're just trying to be suicidal by climbing with no preparation whatsoever.  Nope, you can't climb thinking you can run away from your mother's nagging to take a bath or brush your teeth.  I've seen fit grannies here reaching the summit faster than a lot of younger people.  P.S.  I want to be like them when I grow up.If you're decided to go, book with a reputable tour company offering those 3 days 2 nights or 2 days 1 night climb package which usually include round trip transfers, park entrance fees, guide fee, lodging up Mt. Kinabalu, meals and climb certificates.  The more like-minded people you can gather to go with you, the lower the prices get and the more fun it gets on your trip.  Next for at least 3 months before the climb,  physically train, train, train for at least 3 times a week.  Walk, cycle, run up hills, climb all the stairwells you can trespass, take a hike, just go get moving.  If you can work up your VO2 max to above average levels  then the hike will be much easier.  I trained mostly on the road, in the gym or in the building stairwells.  From less than 3 kilometers on my first month of preparation, I could only manage to work up my runs to 11 kilometers non-stop before getting so bored by the 3rd month, haha.  Still, I think it improved my lung capacity a whole lot which consequently gave me an easy hike and preventing the dreaded altitude sickness.Now don't be put off by the amount of fitness needed to achieve a successful hike.  A lot have done the climb and they are of average fitness.  Being much fitter will just give a better advantage.  Just walk slowly, one foot ahead of the other over & over again.  Walk consistently, fast enough to still be able to talk to your friends and rest 2 to 5 minutes when you reach the trail huts or pondoks which you will find every half kilometer or so.  If you find it hard to catch up with your companions, don't worry.  This shouldn't be a contest.  The guide always stays with the slowest person in your group.  If you really want to slow your group down you can holler at them and tell them you want to take their picture so they'll stop in their tracks.   Most of all, start early and take your time to enjoy the views. One thing about guides, it's like Russian roulette.  You never know what kinds you're gonna get - young and experienced, old and experienced, quiet or chatty, very little or good English, shares a lot about local knowledge or none at all.  Our guide was very young and quiet but he smiled a lot.  I would prompt him a lot of times by asking which is the easier way, how further do we have to go, show me the orchids and pitcher plants, etc.  At times when he seemed not to understand me, other guides would butt in and answer for him.  Overall, he did okay and we were not putt off.We booked the 2 days 1 night climb package.  The first day of the hike is a walk up to 6 kilometers from Timpohon Gate to Laban Rata or 8 kilometers if you'll take the Mesilau route.  You need to wear an ID issued by the park at all times on the trail.  It takes on average, 5 to 7 hours to finish the hike on the first day from Timpohon to Laban Rata.  Weather can go from hot to cold, dry to wet so dress appropriately.  I did not find any mosquitos.  I dressed in gym pants, a light vapor wicking t-shirt, thick socks and a good pair of hiking shoes.  I put my light rain poncho within easy reach.  It did rain in the afternoon but it was only for about an hour.  Always waterproof all the contents of your backpack.  Bring extra plastics for waterproofing and segregating your stuff.  The trail was very wide than I'm used to in my other hikes.  It looked so easy but it seemed like a never ending trail that only goes up, up, up.  Don't go hungry.  Eat your trail food like chocolates, nuts, dried fruit, etc.  Drink lots of water.  This helps prevent headaches.  You may refill with mountain spring water at the pondoks so you don't have to carry heavy loads of water.  I only brought a 500 ml container and kept refilling without putting any water purifying tablets.  Luckily, I didn't get any stomach upset.  Packed lunch which is usually a sandwich, fruit, egg, some meat & bottled water is often provided in the tour package.At the end of the hike up to 6 kilometers from Kinabalu Park's Timpohon gate, you will reach the  lodging houses of Mt. Kinabalu.  Most hikers were booked at the biggest lodge, Laban Rata.  Our tour operator booked us at Pendant Hut which is a bit higher than Laban Rata.  Like most lodges there, the rooms are dorm types with double deck beds you share with 6 to 10 other people.  Each bunk bed has a pillow, sleeping bag & sleeping bag liner.  I find Pendant Hut cozy.  The staff there were wonderful.  They were welcoming, helpful & easygoing.  There was hot & cold drinking water provided round the clock.  For some reason, my packs of Milo tasted better here.  Croc-like slippers were also provided.  Shower rooms & toilets were shared at the end of the dorm rooms' hallway.  Given the dorm like setting, this is considered luxury for a hiker's standards as you don't have to pack your own camping tent, sleeping bag and cook set.There's also the option of doing the Via Ferrata activity if you're booked at Pendant Hut.  There is a briefing about this activity at Pendant Hut around 3 to 4 pm of day 1.  It's another awesome thing to do on Mt. Kinabalu but you need to make it to their cut-off time of getting to the meeting point around 8 am from the peak the next day to be able to join.  The activity consists of walking on thin ledges or small footholds on the rock face, clipping on and off carabiners.  Too bad I missed the 8 am cut-off because we took our sweet time at the summit area.  There's no refund if you miss this as part of your tour package.  We ate the buffet dinner early as provided by the tour operator at Laban Rata.  The sunset views there was just spectacular.  Food was okay.  You could also buy other supplies you may have forgotten like gloves, balaclava, batteries, etc.  We went to bed at 8 pm in most of our next day's outfit.  We woke up around 1:30 am, had warm coffee, lots of bread and jam.  It wasn't very cold when we left around 2:30 am to continue the climb to the summit which is another 2.7 kilometers away.  I wore long sleeved thermals, a vapor wicking shirt, a very light windbreaker, trekking pants, beanie, headtorch, a pair of waterproof gloves and the park issued ID.  I packed a fleece jacket & scarf in my backpack in case it gets any colder later on the trail, a light rain poncho in case it will rain, some trail food, water, foldable walking stick for the descent, first-aid kit & my camera.On the way to the summit in the dark, there will be some scrambling over rocks and hauling yourself up on some parts of the white rope which serves as a marker that you're on the right track.  Around this part of the hike, a lot also turn back due to dizziness and altitude sickness.  Careful, don't touch the vomit you may find on the trail.  The landscape turns to mostly granite with little plant life beyond the Sayat Sayat check point.  It's like you're on the moon.  You'd find some hikers sitting down very still, catching their breaths, wondering why, why, why they signed up for this and taking in the view of distant city lights, silhouettes of mountain peaks, the sky filled with so many stars and the dawn about to break.We reached the highest point, Low's peak around sunrise.  It's a very small place that can fit 4 to 5 people at a time so traffic around here gets heavy.  Just take some quick pictures that you've made it here then go down and give way to others coming up for their turn.  Take more pictures somewhere below the peak.  It's all very scenic around this area. Starting the descent, making use of the walking stick really helped my knees and my toenails.  Minimizing the impact, the walking stick prevented death to the toe nails or blood blisters.We descended back to Pendant Hut for more breakfast provided there.  We ate chicken sausages, mashed potatoes, beans & more bread.  We than gathered our stuff and walked back all the way down to Timpohon gate.  We were then transferred back to Kinabalu park headquarters where our tour operator's driver drove us back to KK city.In spite of sore legs for the next 3 days, I am very happy I did it and wouldn't mind doing it all over again.  I guess if you really love something, you'll try your utmost to overcome all the difficulties associated with doing it.  Prepare and remember to pack your awesome attitude so you can best enjoy it all."
525,Mt. Kinabalu Climb with Focus Humanitarian Challenge 2013,"We are a couple in our early sixties and completed the climb 2 days ago without any problems. We are reasonably fit but have not climbed at altitude previously. A few months of uphill climbing will make the trip more comfortable for anyone.We are from Tasmania so are very aware of mountain conditions and were well prepared. Warm clothing for the Summit, hydrate well and have some snacks and gels which taste pretty awful but give an instant boost.Contrary to some reviews we found the  accommodation clean and comfortable. The food was great considering everything is walked to Laban RataA tip for booking the 3 day 2 night trip is to ring Sutera Lodge direct and book with them. They own all the accommodation at Park Headquarters & Laban Rata and were very helpful with my booking process. We just hired a guide and payed for the transport to Timpohon Gate at Headquarters.It was MUCH cheaper to do it this way versus a tour company. It was approximately $600.00 for 2 nights acc, 7 meals and extras for both of us. I was quoted over $1000 each through a company!From our arrival at Kinabalu Park Headquarters everything flowed very smoothly. We stayed the first night at Hill Lodge which was good standard.Of course there are many people climbing this mountain every day but I expect this would be similar for any famous peak."
526,Good climb. Great guides and support available,"A well organised walk, although you don't really need a guide as it's a very straight forward route. Fantastic views once you gain the summit in the early hours. It's a short walk  (, as mountain treks go) but don't let that fool you, the 1st day was harder than any of the days on Mount Kenya!Don't bother with the ""via ferrata"" (sp?) on the way down, it's the most pathetic and boring one you'll ever do. Clearly added on to make a few more quid. It was that easy that most of my group really didn't feel the need to latch themselves onto the wire, (although they did to stop the guide having a fit!)"
527,Great Place,"We booked our trek through Amazing Borneo Tours and were lucky to have one guide, Joseph, for two people. Jospeh made our trip really memorable, he was friendly, knowledgable and kept us informed throughout the trek. The hike is constantly steep but there are little huts along the way to take a break; and a couple have toilet facilities. The lunch Amazing Borneo tours provided us was plenty and tasty so we didn't need much of the sweets we brought along with us. The facilities at Pendant Hut are basic - the bunk beds are comfortable, there are tea and coffee making facilities, there are showers but no hot water. I'd recommend taking water purifier tablets to use in the filtered water they provide. Dinner was prepared in Laban Rata guesthouse and was a great buffet (especially considering everything is hiked up the mountain). It's difficult to sleep at that altitude and were already awake when the knock on the door came to wake us up at 2.30am. After a light breakfast we started to tackle the remainder of the mountain which was steeper than the day before. We lucked out with great weather and reached the summit before sunrise, and when it came up it was spectacular and well worth the climb. The hardest part of the climb is descending the many, many large steps to the bottom. Take warm clothing, waterproof clothing and water purification tablets! Whilst the climb was spectacular we were saddened to see more infrastructure being built to accommodate more people hiking the mountain, but other than that it was worth the hard slog!"
528,Mount Kinabalu Climb,"Mount Kinabalu can be climbed on a two days/one night trek. The trek is great and, if lucky, the views could be amazing at sunrise from up there.Worth getting in touch with Sutera directly at their offices at Wisma Sabah, Kota Kinabalu; sometimes possible to save money and avoid paying the online published prices."
529,Stupendous!,Lovely chalets with nice view of mountain.I really love the food while staying in Kinabalu Park.Will come again in future
530,1 Day Summit Hike,"Made 2 attempts and reached the peak on my second try in 2014 having made it only up to Laban Rata on the first try in 2013. If you want to attempt, you have to have a good fitness level and be in good health. This mountain is no joke. Expect a little rock climbing too.To anyone complaining about having to need and pay for a guide to climb, please do not underestimate this mountain. The peak is like nothing you have ever seen and is dangerous to do without one. A german girl actually died from falling and cracking her skull open the week before we went- for not listening to her guide."
531,Expensive treat,Have always like the drive up to the foot hills of Mount Kinabalu. The scenery is awesome and the air is so very clean and fresh. The view of  Mt Kinabalu from the Desa Cattle farm is truly spectacular. Not to be missed
532,Sabah Holiday,"Mount Kinabalu is a National Park, is a good place to relax and good trail to move around and going up to the summit."
533,Amazing experience,"first the logistics:Flew into kk april 18,2013 around 2am. Checked into bunibon lodge, clean, simple, hostel in great location, walking distance from seafood market. Next day, I went to sutera harbour in wismah sabah (walking distance to bunibon lodge) and obtained my permit to climb kinabalu next day! Cost of RM577 for 1 nt including lodging, permit, insurance, lunch, dinner, 2 supper, buffet breakfast afternoon tea. I have gluten allergies and they can accommodate that too..I had to arrange Guide and transportation costs to split with other climbers, three of us so I paid RM55 (plus RM 577 and Entrance fee is RM15). mt kinabalu hike: we did mesinau trail (which is for masochists only) and it was MF TOUGH. The hike is mostly vertical on a steep incline (like 85% of it)tips: TAKE ONLY NECESSITIES to first part of hike then the same for summit climb. MAKE SURE YOU GET A FE W HOURS SLEEP. our dorm mate snorted like a hog so we were awake half the time. I am not kidding. so take some sleeping pills or earplugs just in case.head on back to see the summit at 3am WITH YOUR HEADLAMP AND FRESH BATTERIES! I was so frustrated, my batteries practically died close to the summit. grrrr because this probably a once in a lifetime exoerience.Rewards: Waking up at 2am  is not a reward but to see the spectacular beauty of the summit and experience the night /sunrise climb is an experience that will never be forgotten! It’s like being in a different world where there are only few humans (then they look like aliens at night with the headlamps). TAKE THE CAMERA and most important, still have fun."
534,Must Visit!!!,Went with my wife and another couple.  It was an overnight trek and the experience was just amazing.  I had some experience in trekking but this was by far something I hadn't expected.  It wasn't an easy trek at all but the exhilaration you get on reaching the top beats any other experience.
535,Must visit,"i did it slowly without any training and I wouldn't say im fit, but its not really recommended. the trip from the start to laban rata was all steps without a view. the last part was cooler with climbing with ropes and such."
536,Beautiful scenery,"You will need to book in advance to get the climbing permit, if you want to have cheaper rate, you should find more friends to join your climbing trip. Wind jacket and rain coat is necessary."
537,"Amazing experience, but it's tough even if you're fit","So my friend and I attempted the 1 day ""hardcore"" summit.  He was a college D1 athlete and I consider myself quite active.  We departed early in the morning with 3 other guys.  There is a point you must reach by a certain time or they don't allow you to go any further.  My friend and I made the cut, the other 3 didn't.The climb is mostly steps until the last portion, it is brutal, it makes you want to quit, and it is rushed.  However the moment you reach the summit, the last few hours of hell are totally worth it!"
538,Spectacular,Lovely scenery but not much to do at the base of the mountain unless you are planning on trekking. Lovely drive up though.
539,Mt Kinabalu from a safe distance,"We bought a package with overnight stay at Laban Rata, a few km from the peak. It was fully booked weeks ahead but when we went into the office of the company in Kota Konakinabalu, all four of us got a package just two days ahead, and a fair bit cheaper than the online price as well. The package was 2D/1N and included some food pack for the way up, as well as dinner and breakfast at the resthouse in Laban Rata. The food pack was horrible, but the other food good. The room was really simple, but fully functional. The climb to the peak wasn't too easy and expect to have a hard time if you'r too out of shape, but you'll make it if you're of average shape. It's worth every effort, the sunrise on the peak is absolutely stunning! Just remember though; bring warm clothes! We figured we'd be used to some cold, coming from Sweden and all, but standing at the peak 6 am in the morning with only thin trousers and a wind jacket was a mistake and I've rarely been freezing as much in my life."
540,amazing trip,"Well what can I say apart from wow what a mentality and physically demanding but satisfying thing we’ve done. Before we set off on this what seems mission impossible, I read loads of reviews. Stating the difficulty and you have to train.Well let me tell you I’m 29 years old smoke drink and eat what my taste buds telling me and we made it. It’s a hell of a journey and if your determined and want it enough you’ll make the summit and what a view may I add.Our guide Apsom was very good. Felt at ease and quite the wise old man. A message for those people who do attempt it which I advise is along your journey you see “porters” these guys walk up down the mountain for a living with food, tools and materials on there back just have look at them if require inspiration.Challenging physically and mentally but when reached the top thought to myself not bad for a fat lad and what a tripHope this inspires people to do this and not think you have to be some super athlete I’m living proof you don’t have to be"
541,amazing,"I went to climb Mount Kinabalu with a friend in the end of March but we ended up only at the Laban Rata Guesthouse at 3,273 meter without heading to the summit of 4,095 meter. It was because I didn’t feel well after exposed to the chilly wet fog during our 6-km hike from the starting point (1,866 meter) to Laban Rata. We started the climbing at about 9 a.m. when the weather was sunny and the temperature was nice at about 20°C. As we went higher, the temperature dropped. The path of the first 4 km was not difficult but the weather became foggy and windy when we reached Lowii Shelter (2,267 meter/2 km). As we were already wet by our own sweat, the wet fog became chilly though we had our waterproof jacket on. The last 2 km to Laban Rata was rocky and we needed to put a lot of effort in moving our steps.  The sun re-emerged when we reached Paka Shelter at about 3,000 meter where was just 0.5 km to the Laban Rata, but we were already exhausted. It took 8 hours when we finally reached Laban Rata at 5 p.m. The light was good and we enjoyed very much seeing the Donkey Ears in front of the blue sky. After dinner, we went to bed early before 8 p.m. However, chill and fever took turns to strike me before I could fall into sleep. We woke at 2 a.m. as scheduled for the summit climbing. But, after discussing with my friend about my situation, I decided to give up the climbing. My friend also preferred to stop as she felt tired. The next morning, we started our return journey at 8 a.m. The path going down was much easier and it took only 4.5 hours when we reached the starting point at 12:30.When I reviewed my trip, I found that I was already unwell before going to Malaysia due to the workload in my job. That was why I was easily conquered by the chilly wet fog. So, next time when I plan for another climbing, I would take care of my health before starting the journey to secure a better chance of a successful climbing."
542,Mount Kinabalu,"Sublime, amazing, incredibleThis is probably the highest mountain you can climb without training or serious gear. The summit is nearly 4100m and places you above everything you experience in every day life. It’s like you’re touching heaven.Words fail to describe the experience so I won’t go further but to say if you can make this trip you should.Tips:Able bodied people of all fitness levels can make this climb. The guides will go as fast or as slow as you. You will need to be warm at the summit at 6 am so regular cold weather gear won’t cut it. Bring an extra couple of layers, hat, good gloves, balaclava or good scarf and thermals. A small hot thermos of tea or heat pac would be gold if you can fit it in!For the summit estimate your speed from the previous days climb so that you don’t arrive too early (we got there an hour and a half before sunrise and got really cold)."
543,a hardcore climbing experience,"I should know better than to try to summit in the off season but I was in Borneo so had booked my Summit Climb through Amazing Borneo. They are a fantastic operator so I will be returning with them. The actual climb to the Base Camp is not that hard. It’s just a long upward climb over well defined trail that is mostly stairs. There are a number of rest stops along the way and the final 2km is steeper and you then have some small bouldering to get to your overnight spot. We had lousy weather - completely fogged in all the way up I only saw the trail and that’s it. When I got to Base Camp the wind picked up and was gusting/howling all night. We had one of two heated rooms but there is no hot shower in the room (water is cold even though they say it is solar heated).  The food is average but plentiful but the eating room is not heated so you better eat fast because it gets cold fast. We met at 215am and the park ranger said the summit had been closed the previous 8 days and they wanted to wait another 30 minutes to decide. Finally they said they would open the summit “for now but may close it at any time and to talk with your guide if you wanted to go up”. Many guides did not want to go to the summit. Mine told me he did not recommend it due to high winds, falling temperature and the cloud had descended on the summit so no view. I wanted to go but ultimately decided not to since I can return during dry season (feb-April/May). I later heard a number of people were sent back by rangers as temps went down to 0 Celsius and some people got hypothermia.  One group of young Australians did go up but they looked terrible at the bottom (many were limping).  I had come here after getting to Everest Base Camp and Kala Pathar so it was discouraging to come down after getting so close. I just did not have a good feeling about it. And I learned my lesson to come during optimal climbing time so will be back next year. You can leave your non essential items at Laban Rata and get them on the way down (checkout is 1030). Use walking sticks on the way down (after Laban Rata not on way to summit). I had no problem coming down and recovered quickly. If you can afford it get the heated private room. It was nice and quiet with a coffee/tea maker, ensuite shower and bathroom and a heater. They also provided towels, washcloths and slippers. The room had two single beds and was very comfortable.    The early breakfast at 215 is not that good so if you need fuel bring some energy bars to supplement. They also sell snacks etc there.  I also noticed they are building another place across from Laban Rata and I’m guessing it will be complete in 6 months maybe. That would open up the mountain to a lot more people. Be prepared on the final 2km it is difficult at times to pass people so you could get stuck behind a larger less fit group and you won’t be able to pass them."
544,Hard walk with a fantastic view.,"This is going to be a long review, you have been warned. :) I climbed this majestic mountain on the 7th of February and just returned back from the unforgettable trip yesterday. I was with 5 of my friends (all with different levels of fitness), but we all managed to reach Low's Peak! The climb was a humbling experience to me and although I kept asking myself throughout the climb what I was doing there, it was definitely worth it in the end. On the day of the climb, we took a taxi from KK and head straight to Kinabalu Park. There are many drivers willing to take you, but they would likely want to wait fot the vehicle to be full before moving. You'd have to wait or else, just pay for the remaining empty seats.At the Park Headquarters, you will have to take care of your climbing permits, insurance, guide and transportation to Timpohon Gate. We booked our accommodation at Laban Rata with Sutera Sanctuary Lodges, which was included with meals. We then pick up our packed lunches at Balsam restaurant before setting off to Timpohon.At every shelter along the way, there are restrooms provided. You can also refill your water bottles. However, drink at your own risk, as it is untreated water. The climb was not easy for me. I have trained for several months prior to the climb by jogging, trekking up hills and stairs. I was not prepared for the altitude sickness. I started to experience short of breath and increased heart pace at the Layang-Layang Hut (around 4km into the climb). The last 2km to Laban Rata was very hard for me as I had to stop and rest frequently. Luckily, my guide was there to assist and encourage me along the way. The trek up was not so bad. Do bring along a hiking stick as it helped me a lot to climb up the huge steps and rocky trek. The scenery was incredibly beautiful and I get to catch a glimpse of the mountain squirrels and a few pitcher plants.I was the last in my group to reach the resthouse at 5pm. Dinner buffet was served at 4.30pm to 7.30pm. I had a quick dinner and immediately retire to bed around 6pm. If you're a light sleeper, I'd suggest bringing along ear plugs as the other climbers were very noisy, even well after 9pm. I did managed to get some sleep before the noises of people getting ready filled the air.We then went for supper, which starts on 2am. The queue was long and I only managed to grab a few bites of nasi goreng and a cup of coffee. At 2.30am, we were then given a briefing by our guide before we start our trek to the summit. Remember to bring along your headlamp, some light snacks (a chocolate or energy bar) and a bottle of water for the final ascend. The climb up was slow at first, as you have to wait for the others in front to move. The ropes were pretty hard for me. Be sure to have gloves with good grips on. Otherwise, the palm of your hands will suffer.I managed to reach the checkpoint just 15 minutes before it closed, so I was in good spirits until I realised there is still a long way to go. Took me another 2 hours to reach Low's Peak and almost gave up along the way.I was among the last to leave the summit and the sun was already up by then. I did not apply any sunblock prior to going up. As a result, my face hurts now because of the sunburn. Do remember to bring sunblock or at least a mask to cover up your face. The descent was equally as hard as the ascent up the mountain. The trek is slippery and muddy as it rained during our descent down to Timpohon. Overall it was an unforgettable experience, one that I would do for once in a lifetime. The view along the mountain trek is beautiful and the green scenery was a nice change from the cityscape. The view when I was up at the peak was even more breathtaking. The sky was full of stars and you get to see an amazing sunrise. I might go back someday and do it all over again via the Mesilau trail."
545,Not as easy as you think,A sad story about this mountain. You can walk it and follow the trail of the death march. A lovely beautiful place with a sad history.
546,Highest Peak in South East Asia,You must build up your stamina first before you climb this mountain. We only went to the bottom of this mountain. The view from the mountain is stunning. Must go early because after 9am the cloud will cover the mountain top so you will not be able to see the whole mountain top.
547,Long trip for not much,"Its been a hard climb but the moment you reach the top, it pays up every strength you have contributed. A lot of training is required before the climb."
548,Breathtaking,"This was a fair drive from town, however a great day out.  Most guides will stop up the hill for you to get many, very cheap souvenirs.  There is plenty of stall holders to choose from and fresh fruit is also cheap and available here.  Take some small money to shop for sure.   Once up to the mountain you will experience the lovely flowers and natural fauna on show, the hot springs (don't swim here as it is definitely not clean and man made so not a fantastic attraction).  Keep walking and brave the canopy walk.  It is a hot steep climb with many stairs but very worth it.  Once you are up and walking along one of the four suspended bridges you won't feel too high as the trees and forest are all around you.  It was very monsoonal in town, but not up here.  It was lovely and hot.  If you get a chance to see the waterfall it is a nice cool spot, but mind the leaches.  You may even get to see the special Raffia flower as they are known to grow in the local town below the hot springs.  We saw one and there was another 3 or 4 due to bloom in the next year.  It was a bit of an expensive fee (RM 30 each) to see a flower that took 5 years to grow then another 1 year to bloom, but look at it as a donation to the village, they are not rich people and I am sure this fee will help them greatly.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for you if you actually get the chance to see one.  I would recommend a day going up to the mountain.   We did not climb the mountain as you must book, be very fit and have a few days to do it."
549,Beautiful and awesome mountain to climb.,"Mount Kinabalu visitors here often talk about going up the hill.  The climb is not easy and this is why I have not tried it.  My cousin, when he was around 30, went up for the climb but he did not wear proper shoes and so the friction got him to lose a nail on the way down when the the not-fitting-well shoe kept brushing against his nails.  So for me, I had a psychological barrier to overcome.  But my suggestion is that for non-climbers, one can also enjoy the Mount Kinabalu National Park well too.  One can rent the cabins there which sleep easily 6 to 8 people.   It is worth getting up early to see if you can spot the sunrise, which we did, and see the rising sun lighting up the tip of Mount Kinabalu (we were fortunate to have no cloud that early morning until later in the morning) and the range there was marvellous.  One can also join a walking to see the flora there, especially different varieties of orchids and pitcher plants, big and small.  There is a golf course at the foot of Mount Kinabalu.  The course condition was so so but the scenery was fantastic, as one can imagine."
550,The sense of achievement make the sore legs worth it!,"A very long day, but interesting both from scenic point of view, and also the botanical gardens, markets, Poring Hot springs, and rafflesia flower which were included in the tour. The flower only flowers infrequently, so we were fortunate it was flowering when we went there. It cost RM 20 to see it on top of the tour price. There could have been more time at the Springs, but then the day was quite long. Lunch at a local restaurant was excellent."
551,Grueling hike - don't go unless you are mentally ready to challenge yourself,"I was dreading this part of our trip having read so many reviews of how impossible this trek is.  It's really not that bad.  I'm going to give some practical tips!I'm 30, female, just above average level of fitness- absolutely hate cardio but lift weights in the gym.  In the lead up for about 2 weeks I went on a crosstrainer most days for about an hour and a few 2 hour walks on cliffs other days.  I should have done more - and would recommend it just in case for others, as I seem to have a good natural level of fitness.  I was totally fine though!  You don't really hurt until after the climb - myself and my partner who would be strong and fit from playing football were very stiff for about 4 days afterwards - so don't plan lots of active / walking thing - and you'll never want to see another step in your life.The climb itself starts at about 830 and in the first day you do 6 km, of 70 percent steps - but it's really fine!  Slow and steady wins the race.  We'd met people previously who told us they took off and didn't stop at all at rest stops (every kilometre) and were absolutely wrecked for the last km/ 2 and killing each other.  There's no point rushing! You're proving nothing to anyone, and there's nothing really up at the hostel so you'd just be bored! Enjoy the walk!  Saying that - we were still there by lunch time.The next morning you're up at around 230 to start the final ascent which is steeper, and dark so you need a headlamp.  It is pretty cold, especially if you go fast and then are waiting at the top of the mountain for sunset - it's freezing!  (more on clothing later)Then back down for breakfast and back down.  I don't see the need for sticks unless you're scaredy or unsteady on your feet - my OH found it harder than me, but I just took off back down pretty quickly and kept the feet moving and it was fine! (I'd altitude sickness from the very start of the climb so wanted to go back to normality.It's really gorgeous, and get out of the hostel for sunset as there are beautiful views!We stayed in a shared dorm - booked late and it was just what was left.  It' fine, like a hostel, but as most people are sick (everyone was up in our room to go to the toilet at least once) it' very cheap to get a private room and worth it if you  are a light sleeper.Sidenote: that couple we met never got to do the final ascent as it was too dangerous!SO IMPORTANT - MEDICATION:I got altitude sickness pretty much as soon as we started climbing - by the 2nd km I had the most severe diarrhoea.  Make sure you have toilet paper, and rehydration sachets, plenty of water, and tablets for diarrhoea - although nothing helped - I couldn't eat until I got back down off the mountain.  I survived on nibbling on protein bars, jelly beans and nuts.  Tried just boiled rice at the hostel but didn't hold it.  My OH got very bad cramps during the night as it appeared most people did, and I met a few others who got it as soon as we started the morning climb - and so many people who did not have medication! Or had rehydration things but couldn't stand the taste - taste it before you go! I had OROS lemon and lime and it was fantastic and much appreciated by others.Clothing: I did it in October, I'm Irish and I just wore gym gear and bought some boots for 32 euro on sports direct! They were perfect and I think you definitely need boots for ankle support and grip.   So many people were wearing heavy tracksuit bottoms as it doesn't feel that hot, but I was in shorts and the envy of many! Most ended up stripping down at the first stop.  For the morning climb and way back down I wore leggings. Other than that - you just need long sleeve layers and a light rain jack and trousers. Pack your backback before you go - just bring a schoolbag - you've to carry minimum 2 litres of water - I think it was even 3.  Everyone just changes from their first set of clothes into their second when they get to the hostel, sleep in them and get up and climb in them.  You're only in bed about 7 - 2.  Your bag needs to be light, and I recommend bringing your own nibbles for the climb up as the packed lunch was pretty crapTraining:Get some long walks on uneven ground / mountains and cliffs in.  You do need to be above average levels of fitness.  HIIT classes such as spin will help!The people who bring you up are lovely - have a nice tip ready for them at the end.  They get paid so terribly!You aren't allowed go up by yourself - book in advance.  They don't have any supplies you'll need such as head lamp or suncream etc.  So make sure you're all ready to go!  They have snacks etc and it's not V expensive"
552,The ride to mt Kinabalu was impressive,"Climbing Mt Kinabalu was amazing... we started the climb from Mesilau rather than Timpanon which is longer but more diverse. The climb up was tough and the stay at Laban Rata was very welcome. Fitness is very handy and I guess altitude sickness comes down to the individual... our group was pretty lucky and 8/10 made it all the way. Climbing to the summit early the next morning was amazing - even in the rain and dark. Make sure you have waterproofs and thermals - when you are sweating in the heat at the bottom it's hard to imagine but it is cold at the top. I'd recommend taking energy bars, honey and electrolytes and plenty of choccie - you can buy supplies at Laban Rata but it is expensive (understandably though - some porter had to carry them up there!). That said, travel as light as possible unless you are planning on hiring a porter to carry your stuff. Save a bit of energy for the long downhill and make sure you have plenty of second breakfast at Laban Rata before the last descent. If you are worried about fitness train up before you go - climb plenty of steps!!!!"
553,Appreciation as high as this mountain,"Great views and a walk in the tree canopy, then a dip in the hot springs. Full day trip from Kota Kinablu.  Pick up and drop off from the hotel"
554,Mount KK,"My brother and I did the Mt Kinabalu trek in September 2017. It is a decent ascent, beginning at 1800m, hiking to basecamp at around 3800m (there abouts). Suggestions, pace yourself, take sips of water, don't rest too long at the stops. Take your time along the trail. There is a lot of orchids, pitcher plants, birds in the understory. Many hikers just rush, aiming to get to base camp, missing a lot along the way. Keep packs waterproof. It rained the entire hike to base camp. Take an umbrella. We did. It saved us. You don't need this on summit day. It's too windy."
555,Totally worth it,"I just climbed this mountain with 2 colleges and 15 of our students (13-16 years old). We all thoroughly enjoyed the hike. It has a steedy incline in which there is very little flat but very interesting terrain. There are sheltered huts to stop at, have a drink and something to eat along the way. Most of the stops have a toilet and drinking water, just take toilet paper and water purifying drops. We did it over 2 days though I would have prefered to summited first day and then stay at Laban Rata overnight, have breakfast then decline. It took us 5 hrs on the first day from HQ to Laban Rata, we got up at 1.30am had supper and started hiking at 3.00am it took 2 1/2 from Laban Rata to sumit. The kids spread out going back down to Laban Rata taking about 1 to 1 1/2 hrs. We had breakfast, go our gear and headed back down to the main gate taking about 3 hrs. We live in a town which highest hill is 960 m, so this mountain just amazed us. The view is absolutely amazing, to think you climbed something to see it was so self rewarding. I would love to climb it again. To make it easier on yourself, train 3 months prior to comming. We hiked every weekend for at least 6 hrs and found Mt Kinabalu very achievable. Wear good shoes, have a backpack with a brace, bring snacks that work for you and 2L water. We climbed the first day with our sleeping bags, cool weather clothes and shared out toiletries in which we shared. It is cold at Raban Lata so a shower is the last thing you want, we took wipes. They sell snacks and hot drinks at the top, so take money if you want more than a coffee or tea or pack snacks. Climb slow and steady, its a personal achievement not a race, we had many people race pass us then stop puffing whilst we passed them. On the second day start the climb from Laban Rata not rugged up. I wore merino tshirt, thermial and wind jacket, as we went up i put on gloves and hats then whilst at the summit waiting for the sun to rise put on a fleece. Don't miss it, it is definatley worth the effort!"
556,Fantastic!!!!!!!!! A great challenge!,"We just did a basic trip to Mount Kinabalu, botanical gardens a must for plant and orchid fans. A lovely lunch at the gardens and a stop at a local market."
557,Couldn't make peak due to weather - otherwise great,"It's a must to climb Mt. Kinabalu. We stayed outside the National Park the first night (much cheaper - possible if you contact the Sanctuary Lodges by e-mail) and went up to the Sanctuary Lodge on the first day of climbing. Our guide was good (Cornelius) and the climb was pretty tough. The hardest part was the altitude-sickness - perhaps if you stay more than one day outside the National Park to adapt. Sanctuary Lodges are basic and not that comfortable, but you're only there to eat and get a few hours of sleep. The food was great! In the middle of the night, day 2 of climbing began in pitch dark. But once you reach the summit, it's all worth it! The view is amazing, and everyone should have the chance to know what it feels like to stand on the top of a mountain. The trip down is pretty tough and long - you make it the same day. The buffet at the end is again great. One piece of advice: It is FREEZING up there at the lodge/summit, so bring plenty of warm clothes. It was an amazing experience and it's a must if you visit Borneo."
558,Nature at it's best,"Our 3rd trip to Kota Kinabalu and we made it this time to see the often cloud covered Mt Kinabalu. National Park good,"
559,Beautiful Scenery,"This is a beautiful mountain but as with other mountains, you’d have to train enough to be able to enjoy climbing it. We climbed Kinabalu for two days, we started at 10am on Day 1 and got to Laban Rata hut at 430pm. We were slow due to lack of training on carrying our backpacks. We changed clothes in probably my nicest accommodation (while hiking) and had dinner early at around 530pm. We tried to sleep at 830pm but probably due to loud snoring of our bunkmates and the 3,300 m elevation, we were not able to sleep well. At about 3am, we started heading to the summit and we got to the summit at 7am. The trek from the hut to the summit are mostly rope-assisted. The views en route and from the summit are amazing. It felt like I was in a different planet. The huge granite boulders were quite a sight to behold. We started the trek down on Day 2 at 1045 and we got to Timpohon gate at 530. Because of our very tired knees, we were struggling to get down.  If I can give one advice if you plan to climb KK, do cardio and do ramps. So that you can still enjoy the sights and not just pant your way through."
560,Pristine and green...,Booked the all day tour from our hotel. Lots of interesting stops on the way. Great way to see a lot of the island.dont forget your mossie spray. Our guide Joseph was excellent.
561,What a Mountain!,"A 2 day Trek with a guide to Climb Mt Kinabalu is a must do if you are in Borneo and fit enough, a 3 day tek with 2 nights on the mountain is probably more sensible, but what the hell life is to short to hang around.Hitting the summit at 5.30am in time for the sun rise at 5.45 was a very special and magical moment and worth all the effort. Leaving the mountain hut at 3am for a 2.5 hour climb to the summit in the dark with only a head torch was a big part of the experience, then the sun comes up and the views are just stunning. Tropical at the base, freezing at the top with a few heavy rain showers so take clothes for both extremes.  Tick another one of the bucket list."
562,Tough but worth it,"The mountain and surrounding areas are amazing. It is tough to climb it, but absolutely worth it. I would recommend going to Jungle Jack's Backpacker if you haven't booked anything, as I don't know which strings he pulls, but he always get everybody to climb the mountain. Gis price is 1380RM including 4 nights at his accomodation, which does include 3x food a day as well. And it is quality food. Jack himself and the lasies are amazing bytheway!"
563,Climbing mount kinabalu is a MUST!!,"I went up the mount twice, once through the Timpohon Trial and another time through the Mesilau Trial. Timpohon Trial is shorter but steeper compared to the Mesilau Trail, but both are equally challenging. Be sure to be equipped with an extra pair of sandal for descending as one could suffered from scrapped nails due to persistent frictions from wearing shoes. Also bring a climbing stick, a pair of gloves (to grip a rope at the mount top) and a high lumen torch. As precaution, bring an extra pair of socks and two small plastic bags in case the shoes are soaked due to bad weather. Change to the dry socks and wrapped your feet with the plastic bags before wearing your wet shoes again. Voila!"
564,Do it!,"Although I would have loved to climb this mountain, a visit to the canopy walk and soaking my feet in the hot springs were good enough.  A day trip to this beautiful part of Kota Kinabalu was just two hours drive from the city.  Driving through the flora and fauna near the botanic garden area gave me a feeling of being in the alps.  The fresh air, cool weather and holiday lodges contributed to this feeling.  Do not miss the walk on the four roped bridges.  Exhilarating!  End the fun with a dip at the waterfall.  On our way back to the city, we stopped at some fruits stalls, browsed and bought some."
565,One day climb Mt Kinabalu,"I will never forget this experience ever! I am not quite fit so make sure u be ready and have stamina before u go hiking. We take Mesilau trail which was longer than Timpohon trail but the view are amazing. Worth it! When u reach Laban Rata that was like one achievement u should be proud of yourself. Next early in the morning, continue journey to summit plateau and make sure u reach to the Low's Peak and Gunting B Lagadan signboard :) Anyway u will enjoy the trail when u descent from the mountain via Timpohon. Its really worth the pain and greatest experience"
566,Experience of a lifetime,"After reading reviews about how expensive it is to climb Mount Kinabalu i nearly decided not to do it.However i followed a thread on tripadvisor from someone who was looking into doing the trip and he said it was worth checking out a tour company in Kota Kinabalu called ""Downbelow"" who had a couple of specials for end of April 2016.I managed to get a space on a trip that was 2 days time. (Very Lucky)I contacted them and they had a 2D/1N for MYR 960 or a 3D/2N which was 1 night at Pouring Springs then 2D/1N climbing Mount Kinabalu for MYR 1060.I took the 3D/2N package as it was such a good deal and included meals, Mountain Guide (Person not map), transport, accommodation and all other fee's (excluding drinks and snacks) which could be purchased at Laban Rata (Night Stop)I started the climb with my own guide and we walked up to the accommodation at Laban Rata which is 6 km of ascending and we reached here at 1.30pm having a couple of stops on the way up.I was shown my bed in a dorm room which would sleep 6 people ( 3x bunk beds) with blankets and towel. The bathrooms were shared with 1 mens & 1 ladies at opposite ends of the corridor.There is no hot water so most people avoided having showers as the water was one of the coldest i'd come across.The rest of the day was free time to socialise with other climbers and to have dinner about 7pm which was a buffet.  The food was good and there was something for everyone. Beers soft drinks and snacks etc could be purchased from the shop but be warned its all very expensive, however when you see the porters carrying all of the food and supplies up the mountain twice a day you can understand why its that price.The next day is an early start so a breakfast at 2am then head off on the climb to the summit at 2.30 and i arrived at 5.30am in time to watch the sunrise. The climb can be slippery and steep in places but it was worth every moment to reach the summit.You get the chance to have your photo taken at the top and then move a couple of feet from the summit to watch the beautiful sunrise over Sabah and the other peeks.When you have finished you walk back to Laban Rata stopping to take pictures of the wonderful views and then to collect your belongings and have breakfast before having to check out at 10.30am.I had breakfast and started the descent at 9.45am and reached the finish point at 1.15pm.The walk back down the mountain was ok but my legs were very tiered and felt like jelly at the end.This was an amazing climb with beautiful views a great guide and lots of photo opportunities.I would advise taking as little as possible as its a strain to carry to much up and down the mountain. I took my camera, 2 x 1.5 ltd water, fleece, lightweight jacket, gloves, Head Tourch, Running shoes with good grip / or trekking boots and long pants if you feel the cold at the top ( i wore shorts as i didn't find it too cold) & chocolate snacks or sweets.The price of my trip MYR 1006  included:Day 1:  Transport from Kota Kinabalu to Pouring Springs, 1 nights accommodation, Evening Meal, but didn't include activities at the Springs which is extra.Day 2: Transport from Pouring Springs to Mount Kinabalu Park, Climbing Permit, Mountain Tour guide for 2 days, Evening Meal, Bed in Dorm Room.Day 3: Meal before leaving for the summit at 2am,Climb To Summit and return to Park,  Breakfast, and transport back to Kota Kinabalu, and climb certificate on completion of climb.***Always check with tour operator whats included as all packages are different****""Downbelow Marine and Wildlife Adventures"" were very professional and i would highly recommend them but there are also many other tour operators.There is also a high demand for this trip so i would always try and book in advance."
567,Stunning view,"Although there wasn't enough time to hike it, we heard great things about the mountain. We enjoyed the views we had of it from KK,as well as our local resort island."
568,"Mount Madness, Mental, Magnificent, Majestic","It's not easy, It's challenging but its achievable very easily. Me and My wife enjoyed climb up and down. Joy when achieving this is big. Guides are really friendly - especially ours - Ananias Makim. But Please remind - Eventhough they have rate per kilograms to bring up - then It's not recommended to overload guide :-) Me and my wife had 22 kg with us plus guid own bag - so around 30 kg guide plans to walk up - I personally preferred to take part of load on half way up first day already to my own shoulders. Guide gives recommendations good, make supper good pictures and take care your safety. Panalaban sleeping is not private ut clean and okay, people are quiet and respect each others, food is really good up there 3270 meters... So what can I say - Challenge Yourself. :-)"
569,great experience but weather....,"Kinabalu is an amazing experience and a great challenge. The route is well looked after with regular rest stops up to the overnight rest house at 3300 metres. The early morning start is tough but when you get to the top the experience is worth it! Having done Kiliminjaro, I wasnt expecting this to be too hard, but it was much more difficult than expected. Very steep and when you add rain, and the freezing cold up the top, its tough. Not recommend for people who are not used to hard trekking. But a must-do if you are in Borneo and an aventurous type. Dont forget ski gloves for the top."
570,Fantastic if you make it to the top,"The hostel in the mountain is basic, but the food is good. Porters have to carry all supplies up to the hostel! They really take care of you. No hot shower is available. When it rains, it is wise to have spare clothes with you. There is no heating, so having  warm clothes  with you is advisable."
571,Picturesque,"So we paid around 500 USD for 2D2N package (you cannot pay less - 2D1N 400 USD packages are probably the cheapest options). 85% of the hike goes through a dense jungle. There are no views, just stone steps and the jungle, what makes the hike a bit boring. I have to admit the last 2 kilometres of the hike before the peak are mesmerizing, however you will not see any views,as you need to set off from the hostel at 2 am when it is still dark. Only on your way back you can enjoy an amazing panorama. If this is worth paying so much money, I would have some doubts. Also you will be given a guide, even though you don't one - the route is well-marked and you will not get lost on the way. It is just another way of how the locals make their money. The path is congested wth hikers. They plan to expand the hostel from 130 beds to 200 - I dont know how all those people will fit on the hiking stairs...To sum it up - even though Kinabalu is a famous and beautiful mountain, the price for the hike is simply too high. It is NOT value for money. There are amazing hikes in the mountains of that height, which cost you nothing (e,g. in Taiwan) or very little (e.g. in Ethiopia)."
572,mount kinabalu climb,We missed out on getting a permit so therefore just did a day hike part way up. The day pass will allow you to climb up to Layang Layang. The tours offered for a day trip hike from Mesilau Gate up to Layang Layang and then down to Timpohon Gate and charge between 450 - 780 MRY per person depending on the number in your party. We were happy to just go from Timpohon Gate up to Layang Layang and then back down to Timpohon Gate. The trail is very clear and therefore no guide is needed. We therefore opted to hire a taxi for the day. He charged 400 MRY to drive us to Timpohon Gate and pick us up from the same spot 6 hours later - much cheaper than the tours!Be aware of the effects of the altitude. Even though Layang Layang is only at 2700m I still struggled with the altitude on the climb up.
573,Great hike,"INTRODUCTIONBeing the most prominent mountain in the region, it’s almost a must-do to climb Mount Kinabalu. Be aware that the view and the landscape of the Mount Kinabalu area is certainly not as impressive as the scenery of a mountain range like the Alps, but the climb is still a nice physical challenge. In order to do the one-day climb, you should be physically fit. The usual thing to do is going up and down in 2 days. Yet, the catch is that a private company owns the monopoly on the accommodation at the ""base camp"", resulting in 170$ for 1 night in a 20 bed dormitory without heating. Crazy! For that money one can stay for 1 month in a usual Malaysian backpacker’s hostel. There has to be another way! Remember: Leave nothing but footprints. Take nothing but pictures. WHY A ONE-DAY CLIMB?- It’s a nice physical challenge: More than 2,000 height meters in about 4 hours and then all the way back down.- You don’t have to stay at the not very comfy basecamp and wait for the sunrise- A two-day climb can easily cost more than 1000 RM, a one-day climb is around 200 RM (100: permit, 50: guide if shared with one other person (guide is compulsory and you can’t share him with more than one other person) , 7: insurance, 30: taxi to Timpohon gate, 15: park entrance)- If there are really bad weather conditions, it’s more likely to reach the top as a one-day hikerEQUIPMENT: - Water: 2 litres for a one-day climb are surely not too much- High energy food: the prices at the base camp for drinks and snacks are very high- Warm cloths: The nights at the basecamp are cold, thus 2-day climbers need really warm cloths. As a one-day climber you will come into sweat anyway, but still don’t forget that the temperatures can drop down to 0°C. Hat and gloves are nice to have, but not essential.- Windproof jacket: It can become extremely windy up there. Take a wind proof jacket with you. I only had a rain poncho with me and used that as protection against the wind (with a string to fasten it properly). - Shoes: Don’t wear sneakers. The last 2-3 kilometers consist of bare stone which becomes very slippery when wet. Our guide was quite new in his job and wore his fancy sport shoes - almost broke his neck. The next day he went shopping to buy kampong adidas. I wore running shoes for the first part of the mountain which has a lot of stairs and then changed to kampong adidas at the base camp. Kampung adidas are rubber shoes that look a little bit like adidas football shoes and are preferred by most of the porters and guides. You can buy them in KK, for instance, and the best ones cost as much as 10 MR. However, bear in mind that shoes larger than size 10-11 are difficult/impossible to find in Asia.OUR EXPERIENCE (under exceptionally bad weather conditions):To obtain a special 1-day permit, you have to talk to the park ranger, because only the strongest, most handsome and striking men receive this honor. Of course, I got one. (well, actually everyone who shows up simply gets the permit - can’t confirm that only four persons are allowed each day, since we’ve been five) Thus, together with a friend and a mandatory guide I started the climb. Because we had to reach the summit before 1pm, my friend and I stepped on the gas right from the beginning and outdistanced our guide soon afterwards. During our way upwards we met a lot of descending hikers. None of them had reached the summit. In fact, we knew that our odds were very small, given that the previous 3 days not a single person was allowed to climb beyond the base camp due to storms around the peak. During peak season and usually also off-peak season the weather should be better though.After waiting some while at the base camp, finally also our guide arrived. At his request, the park ranger (another one) opened - to our surprise - the gate to the summit for us. Yeah! From now on the temperature fell to almost 0 degree, plus rain and 80 km/h wind. Luckily there was a rope marking the path, as the visibility was very low due to lots of fog. Once again we left our guide behind, and my friend went up like a mountain goat, also outpacing me.  At 12.40 I reached the summit. Good feeling. We were the first ones that week (and likely the only ones). The only problem at the summit was that I had not meet my friend, though there was only one way for both up and down. Even when I met our guide during descending again, he had not seen him either. So we were very worried, of course. Fortunately, we met him at the base camp again. He explained us that when he arrived at the summit, he thought that this was not the highest point of the mountain given the sign saying ""Low's Peak"". He did not know that the peak was named after a British called Hugh Low, and therefore left the official path to search for the presumed ""High Peak"". Fun fact: The whole hike took us about 8 hours. The record of the annual Climbathon is 2h 12min - just insane! NATIONAL PARK AND BOTANICAL GARDENEven if you don’t want to do the climb, the national park at the foot of Mount Kinabalu can still entertain you for a few hours. The botanical garden is excellent (take part in the free tour!) and there are nice tracking paths. Nevertheless, don’t expect to see a lot of exciting flora and fauna outside of the botanical garden, though this area is renowned for its biodiversity."
574,Excellent natural experience,"Flew into Kota Kinabalu Malaysia 9/9/2010.  Permits for hiking the mountain on 9/10 and 9/11 2010.  Flew from Singapore.  Permits pricey compared to Mount Whitney California permits.  The trail was VERY well marked.  Hired a guide - an age nineteen local who did not complain that I hike MY PACE not the crowds'.   Very accommodating to carry gear.  Disappointed in amount of trash in spite of trash bins.  The hostel inside the park was excellent.  Very clean and well maintained with comfortable beds.  The scenery is knock your socks off.  Lush, tropical.  The mountain is steep.  Only 3 Americans on trail - one from Sarah Lawrence WI, one from USA living in Japan for eighteen years and me.  After about 9 hours there is a chalet on the mountain for food, sleeping, bathing.  Awoke at 1:00 a.m. to do the summit.  Slick granite rock, rope required.  Rangers give talk night before.  At my talk ranger explained 9 had died climbing at that point in time.  Hired help carries 100 pound packs on their heads to the chalet with supplies.  As in Nepal no North Face gear or MBT hiking boots - flip flops carrying huge heavy bundles.  Nepal outfitters said this is a good mountain to climb to train for Everest.  Saw my first and only Venus Fly Trap in this park.  Muscles in front of thighs were sore for 3 days afterwards from coming down."
575,My highest dream,Well marked path through interesting fauna with the largest pitcher plants that I've ever seen. The weather was cool and dry on the day we climbed so that was quite perfect. The climb is fairly steep and we were quite exhausted since we didn't really prepare for the climb. Training before attempting the climb is highly recommended!
576,Brilliant day,"Hike up to Laban Rata wasn't that difficult if you have training before the hike. Along the way you can see different type of beautiful wild plants. At Laban Rata you will be able to see beautiful sea of clouds. The next day hike up to peak then hike down the the foot hill is a bit tough. Important note, be prepared for high altitude sickness, besides headache some might have diarrhea. So bring along diarrhea medication and ORS. Lack of mineral  salt may cause your muscles cramps. Arrange your trip during dry season. It's difficult to hike up when rain. This is a very beautiful mountains to hike."
577,Amazing view.,"This is more of a warning than a review for people who decide to do a one day climb. It is very hard! We are I'd say average hikers, average fit, did 4,000m before but in more days. We climbed as a couple, started at 7:15 and made it to the top at 12:30, great weather all day. We could not make it any faster. The last 2.7km from Laban Rata are equal to the first 6km in my opinion. It took us almost the same time. we were at 10am at LR all happy how much time we have for the last bit, but the altitude is a killer then. 8 people started that day the climb and only 4 of us made it to the top. We were lucky enough to meet a swedish duo father-daughter who were very fit and nice and I think it helped us to climb together at the end and see them reach the top ( honestly I thought of giving up just before the top). It is now day 2 after our climb and we still find it painful to go down the stairs.The lack of information at the start from the park office is astonishing. I recommend to read Linda's review below, it was useful for us and get ready for some hard work!"
578,Stunning views from Laban Rata to summit,"As you walk closer to Laban Rata, the view is just so beautiful.  I have a bad day on the way to Laban Rata as we all caught in the rain.  Wet shoes really made me felt so cold.  But as you reach the top on the mountain, everything seems to be worth."
579,Mt Kinabalu Park & Mountain,"A fascinating sight, traditonal home of dead spirits and often completely obscured by clouds and which makes driving, let alone walking, extremely hazardous. We visited only for a short time on our way back from Ranau to Kota Kinabalu but the mountain is always with you wherever you go."
580,Awesome. Very well maintained trail and park facilties.,"We trained every weekend for 5 months, but the sheer scale of the achievement has not yet sunk in. 3 of us are in our 50s and were inspired by an 80 year old we met on the way up who had made it to the summit.  We were not fast and took over 6 hours to get to Labanrata day one.  Get as much rest as you can there as you will need all your energy to get to the summit and trek back to Timpohon gates.  We are still in awe of what we achieved and all made it to the summit, but not for sunrise and were happy to go slow and steady.  Our guide was a Godsend and we would not have reached the top without him. Take the time to enjoy the view at the summit and as you decend as the odds are high that you won't be back. I also take my hat off to my wife who kept me going when I hit the wall 1.7 km from the summit.  She was my rock. My best advice would be to travel as light as practicable, keep drinking plenty of fluid and eating snacks. Our motto was that if you take one step at a time, you will climb a mountain."
581,The most tough hiking trip ever for me,"Last February 2012 (22nd to 26th), My cousin, Eja & I went for Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia for a unforgettable journey of climbing to the highest peak in South-East Asia. The journey up took us the whole two-day. Quite tiring, cause of the cold weather & altitude effect really strucked me..as i never really did training to climb. Unlike my cousin who were very durable & more adventurer, she climbed up with a single breath!..meaning not having so many pitstops..maybe the excitement in her nerve swiped away all those trouble i ws having! myself, like having a nightmare & sweat dream, at the same time..liked being in heaven & hell at the same time... but we had a good time & met very nice new Singaporean & Philippino Friends!"
582,Terrible,"Did it almost on impulse - booked a flight on the 8th of January, got ret for return tickets from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu, arriving at 8 pm on the 4th of February. Slept overnight at Kota Kinabalu at Best Western Kinabalu Daya Hotel which was basic and adequate for a night. Went shopping for altitude sickness pills (Cosway) because I've experienced it before and it wasn't very pleasant. Bought very reasonably priced wind-breaker, thermal gloves and a walking stick (all which came in very very useful) at Tong's. Shopped around for a taxi - spoke to a taxi driver (Ibrahim) outside Wisma Merdeka and got a good price for return from Mount Kinabalu. Checked out of the hotel, had lunch at the Chinese economic rice store at Ang's Hotel. Spoke to another taxi-driver, confirmed to self that Ibrahim gave a better price so I went back and took his car. At the last petrol station before Mount Kinabalu, I bought a family sized bar of Cadbury's Black Forest Chocolate and this would later ""save"" my life. Chocolate is extremely expensive at Laban Rata - a small bar costs 8 Malaysian Ringgit and I bought 56 RM worth of chocolate because I really needed the energy given going up and coming back down (I gave 20 RM worth to my guide as he was very kind and I like sharing food with people). Ibrahim also stopped midway up the mountain so that I could take pictures. He mentioned that the markets are meant for tourists and the souvenirs are rather expensive but I was only interested in the view and I told him I would visit the markets when we are on our way down. At Kinabalu Park, I requested for a room of my own, rather than staying in a hostel. I was given a rather nice one at Hill Lodge. The only downside to this was having to call for the shuttle van at least fifteen minutes before they arrive to drive you back to the headquarters - where the restaurant and reception is. WIFI is also only available at the reception. I paid for a package that included full boarding and the additional charge for a single room/ as opposed to sharing for each night was 200 RM. However, I also requested for a room by myself at Laban Rata and that should have come up to 400 RM but I got it for 300 RM. Was it money well-spent? Completely. The only odd expenditure was a ""key deposit"" which was 50 RM - in case the key was lost, this deposit was forfeited. Was the buffet at Balsam Restaurant satisfactory? So-so. I really enjoyed the room at Hill Lodge and could see myself just spending a few days at such a place for pleasure. This was not meant for this trip however - post-breakfast, I stored whatever I didn't need at Laban Rata at Kinabalu Park. This cost 20 RM. My guide David was also my porter and each kilogramme costs 8 RM. I gladly paid for this because I had to conserve energy for a physical test I had not trained myself for. We started at 10 am and I got to Laban Rata by 5 pm. David was most patient as I was out of breath quickly in the first two hours of the trek but I was also a very determined climber. Because it was a great deal of stair-like steps (as opposed to rocks and boulders) I kept focussing on getting up the next step - looking up and noting how many of them there are would more likely discourage you in the beginning so, just pace yourself by your own standards. At Laban Rata, you have an early dinner and you go to bed really early because of the following reasons. It gets cold after dark (in fact, it is cold even before dark). You start the climb at 2 am the next morning and you will need to be up and have a quick breakfast before the climb. I stayed in Buttercup 1 and the room was nice and toasty after 8 pm (that's when the automated heater turns on) There was also an automated water heater but I didn't use it. Instead, I boiled a kettle of water and wiped myself down with lukewarm water and a hand towel. It was an uneasy night as the other guests in the shared rooms outside were quite rowdy at times. Starting the climb at 2 am was tough. Tough because you were crawling around in semi-darkness and although Mount. Kinabalu is really unusual (it doesn't have many creepy crawlies) you do have the anxiety of not seeing clearly miles ahead of the next step you take. This portion of the climb makes a mounted head torch a necessity and this could be cheaply purchased at Tong's or rented exorbitantly at Laban Rata (the same price except you'd need to buy batteries for the one you buy at Tong's). I brought my walking stick with me but this became useless closer to the summit so be warned that you will have to carry your walking stick at some point, so make sure you get one that can be kept without hassle to your backpack.  Closer to the summit, I began to feel rather sick. I was also freezing although I had on a turtleneck, a fleece jacket, the windbreaker coat. I suspect my tights didn't quite make the thermal protection I needed and I was stopping, and my knees were shaking, and I almost wept at the cold and exhaustion. David was patient, stopping every time I needed and asking me each time if I was ok. And I wasn't. But I was so close. And so David held my hand and showed me steps which were not so steep and he guided me, and encouraged me and I was there. At the summit. Taking pictures of the daybreak, thanking David and absolutely grateful that I had the resources to be there. And only when you're up there at the peak, do you look down and realise what a tedious climb you have attempted in the dark. And you realised... unfortunately, that you were going to have to go down the entire mountain, in a day. I arrived at the peak at 6.30 am and I got back to Laban Rata by 10 am. I collapsed in bed but not before setting an alarm because the check-out was at 10.30 am and if you were late, they would charge an additional 100 RM! So, I checked out and started down the mountain with David. The climb down the hill was EXHAUSTING. My knees hurt like mad, I kept asking how long more we had to go because my toes were hurting from accidentally kicking the loose rocks. But I finally arrived at Kinabalu Park at 4 pm. Uncle Ibrahim the taxi driver was there and we went to town with other two climbers I had met and I fell exhausted into bed when I got to my hotel.I didn't train for this. And I saw a man with an amputated limb doing this so, don't be doubt yourself too much. Prepare for the necessary and then just take each step at a time. PS, I had perfect weather for my climb."
583,"amazing summit, horrible decending",Only saw the mountain from a distance when I was on a boat and when I later flew past it in a jet.  But I have to say it was so beautiful and incredibly majestic (not to mention HUGE!) that I was disappointed that I didn't have time to go climb it.  Absolutely spectacular!!
584,Mountaineering in SE Asia,"A highly strenuous and taxing climb to the summit of Mt Kunabalu on a 2day, 1night trek. Our guide, Mr Jerry was fantastic, highly knowledgeable, patient and capable. We felt very safewith his guidance! The climb itself is very tough (and I compete regularly in triathlons!) and not to be undertaken lightly! The altitude has a massive effect although awareness of the dangers if altitude sickness don't seem to be highlighted enough. Food at the Laban Rata guesthouse was superb and the lodge was very comfortable. The climb to the summit was difficult (very steep!) bit well worth it watching the sunrise when we arrived! It is very cold at the top- I needed thermal top, fleece, ski jacket, gloves, hat etc and was just about warm enough at the top! Good walking boots a must. Highly recommended but go well prepared!! :)"
585,Tough but fun!,"This is probably the toughest mountain to climb in Malaysia partly due to its height. Physical fitness is of utmost importance as the climb is tough. Morning climbers to the peak face cold wind and thin oxygen. There has been some realignment of the tracks after the quake a few a few years ago. On the whole, to ardent hikers, reaching the summit is truly a great achievement. Our group included a priest and he held a mass below the summit. It was an extraordinary experience."
586,Worth every inch,Tough climb but well worth it! The view from the summit as the sun rose is something I will remember forever. The guest house was clean and the food quite good for being buffet style but it was our guide that made it extra special. Bonny not only pointed out flowers on the way up but he also assisted in making the trek down a bit easier on the legs. We arranged this through a travel company called Down Below and warmly recommend using them as it makes it so much easier to book.
587,No need to be a mountain climber,"Seeing the mountain is a highlight and it is good to say we have seen it. Downside is it is about a 3hr drive from KK to get there, then 3hr return if it is a cloudy day the mountain hides so you wouldn't even see it. The national park walk on our tour was only for an hour and you really didn't walk far. Would leave the decision up to individuals if they are keen to see the mountain, and put up with the travelling."
588,Too difficult for 1 day trek,"It is a bit of a relentless slog, more so on the way down than the way up. Effectively an easy climb as you are climbing steps most of the way to the top, Its worth doing it  with an overnight stay as that allows you the opportunity to watch sunrise over Borneo (and the Philippines if you get a clear morning). The views are absolutely breathtaking and you meet all sorts of people on the way up. Just remember to pack a wooly hat and warm jumper!"
589,A challenge well worth it,"for those who want to enjoy the mountain view, this is good area,good for spend a weekend in this area with family.can be reach by two hours driving from kota kinabalu.on the way back to kota kinabalu can buy vegetables in kundasang.three times visiting mount kinabalu,and still interesting."
590,Mount Kinabalu in one day,It was breathtaking. We had a guide which was organised by the hotel we stayed at and our guide Jeffrey was just awesome. I think he said he had been up Mount Kinabalu about 4 or 5 times himself. The views were so beautiful and would recommend it to anyone.
591,A day at Mt Kinabalu,"Trekking up the mountain takes a few months training. But all the hard work is worth it once you are at the top of the mountain looking over the surrounding scenery. No matter how hard is the climb, you must not give up or else you will regret."
592,Worth the effort,"The only reason I haven't given Mount Kinabalu 5 stars was because our summit hike was cancelled due to bad weather, which was out of everyone's control. It was just disappointing to have come so far. I also had the via ferrata option booked (through Amazing Borneo), and of course we were unable to get any of our money back (but we knew this when we signed up for it). The hike itself was tough. And it didn't help that it rained pretty much the entire time. Be prepared. Do some training and bring the right gear (I definitely did not bring enough clothes). Also, if you don't already have some sort of cover on your backpacks- INVEST IN A PONCHO. I learnt this the hard way when I got to the rest hut and all my stuff that weren't in zip lock bags were soaking wet (including my beanie, gloves and neckwarmer). Rent a walking stick for 10RM at the base. It will save you on your descend. Our guide, Julius, was lovely and very patient with us. He followed behind the person I was travelling with and also offered to carry pretty much everything of hers just to help her get to the rest house. We stayed at Pendant Hut, which was located above Laban Rata (the main rest house), as we were in the via ferrata program.This was a little annoying because you had to trek down a little for the buffet dinner (pretty decent food!).I didn't have any issues with the altitude as we were ascending, as I had taken Diamox (altitude sickness tablets). Slowing down and taking deep breaths really helped me. I did have difficulties getting to sleep that night though (felt difficult to breathe, always thirsty etc.) Probably got about 1hr of sleep max. I can't wait to do this climb again and reach the summit. When I do, I would probably pick a better season (when it is less likely to rain), not book a tour or via ferrata (I have spoken to a few others who just showed up at the base and paid for everything), revise my packing list and do more training before I go!"
593,magnificent,"My gf and I scheduled a 3D2N trip with the monopoly SSL directly. We just completed the trip yesterday and I believe it will be the best activity we have in Sabah. The first night we stayed in Mesilau Nature resort. There is nothing much you can do there, so we were right in not arriving there so early. Well we could even skip it and just do a 2D1N trip but by spending 1 more night, we dont need to be rush with the traffic and the climb in same day.Getting to Mesilau, we first took a mini van (25RM each) from the bus station in KK (next to Merdeka Field). Not too hard to find. It's the cheapest public transport i suppose, but they started only when the van is filled up with people. We waited 30 mins. It took around 2 hr 10min to KK national park Head Quater. Alternative is to take a taxi. After some registration at the HQ, we were transferred to Mesilau, which is included in the package.Dont expect much from the Mesilau resort. From perspective of its location, i can say their amenity and food is good. But if u compare it with hotel in the city that at the same price range, u would well be disappointed. Again, there is nothing to do there. No wifi no mobile internet. Just take an early good night sleep and prepare for the next day climb. I used to hike very often but stopped last three months due to work. Without much exercise recently, it made the hike pretty challenging. We started at 8:30am, and arrived Laban Rata at 2:30pm. That is sth more than 8km. There is heat water at the time we visited. I read from some other blogs that no heat water for shower. So if u want to make sure u better check with SSL. There is a mini store which sells snacks and drinks. RM26 for a can of beer. Again due to its location i find the price very reasonable.The last part of the climb was started at 2:30am. It took us 2 hrs to complete the final 2.8km climb. Some part was quite technical but do it with caution then u will be find. Very cold at summit around 2~3'c when we arrived. The landscape near the summit is special, scenary and the sunrise is great. It worths the climb for us.We went down via Timpohon trail. Be prepared for high and slippery steps going down. I believe the Mesilau trail is a bit harder than the Timpohon trail. People says there are more things to see, e.g. flowers, scenary....in Mesilau trail. We didnt find things very special there but afterall we didnt want to repeat the same trail in both way so that is fine. In the return trip to KK, we found 2 other climbers to share cost of a van. 4 of us total cost RM120. Feel free to msg me if u want more info."
594,More dangerous than described,"I am not a hiker nor an outdoor person but when my boyfriend said he wanted to climb Mt Kinabalu, I agreed to do it as well. Months before the climb, I started working out to prepare me for the climb because I wanted to make sure that I'm fit to climb it. I thought that I would be able to climb the summit. I mean, it's just 8.72 km of hike, right? And it's still located in the tropics so a few layers of warm clothing can suffice. The only major concern I had was elevation/altitude. So I told myself that I'll just hike slowly but surely, make sure I steady my breathing and acclimatize myself. Unfortunately, I was about 1.5 km short from the summit. I stopped a few hundred meters from the last stop because it was too cold and I was too scared. There's a section of the summit hike where you'll be climbing at an angle and you will have to pull yourself up using a rope - with no harness. I thought it would just be for a short part of the hike. But, no. Most of the last 2km+ that you need to climb to reach Low's Peak is the rope section. Add the bitter cold (I'm from a tropical country so people from temperate countries may have a different opinion of the temperature) and the rain, my acrophobic self was imagining all the crazy stuff that can go wrong. Nevertheless, I'm still happy that I tried to push myself to do something challenging. And that experience will forever make my KK trip one for the books."
595,First Hike of My Life,"To hike mount kinabalu was my childhood dream. Its because that's the highest mount in South east Asia.10th March 2015 the day I can't forget. Me and my twin brother started to hike up. The weather at kinabalu park was very cool and refreshing. When we started our journey to the Laban Rata, first 6km to rest house was just awesome because we had energy. Scenery & environment on the way was just peaceful. We enjoyed the journey to Laban Rata guesthouse. Next day 2am hike up to the Low's peak. This is not a joke. Whoever wish to hike up mount kinabalu, please do physical and endurance training. Its because the 2.7km trail to the peak is very challenging. The temperature was -2°Celsius when we hike up. We can see some frozen plants. It took us 3hours to reach Low's Peak and the sunrise view was magnificent. No words to describe. We love the expedition. Make sure get a good hiking boots with winter jacket and thick gloves. Headlight is also very important equipment."
596,Hard work but made it,Did this as part of trip to Poring Hot Springs.  In hindsight wouldn't bother going to just the Park.
597,the mountain,"You have to climb Mt Kinabalu to experience the magic. The mountain is majestic, the view is picture perfect, the weather is cooling, its really amazing. Recommended for all wannabe trekkers. However, you must train hard and well in order to enjoy the climb. Although we have been climbing Mt Kinabalu frequently, we still want to go again. Awesome!"
598,A tough climb,"This ended up costing us about $200USD each for a 2 day trip.  A bit pricey for what you get.  The 'mandatory' guides are just babysitters, don't expect much English or any information about your surroundings.The climb up in the early hours in the morning would have been nice if it weren't clogged with hundreds of tourists with no concept of night vision.  Be prepared to walk towards high powered head torches all morning as they take breaks on the side of the track and shine at your face as you walk past them.The walk is not too difficult if you have climbed mountains before.  Well marked and plenty of toilets and fresh water stops along he way."
599,Kinabalu and Other Attractions in Sabah,"My whole family loved the outdoor experience of climbing up some of the trails of Mount kinabalu.  I only wish the children were older so we could have done the trail to the summit!!  The mountains are surrounded by clouds (I hear most days), but this adds to the beauty in a way.  There are some beautiful waterfalls along the way as well.  I wish we'd known about the accommodations inside the park, because we would have stayed there in order to start out earlier."
600,Never regret to visit the mountain :),"I approached this trek with some trepidation as a 62 year old ""walking"" fit person. I read the warnings carefully, but like everyone else I felt they were cautiously pessimistic to the worst case. My idea of camping is staying in a motel, so the communal sleeping in a hut and being woken up at 2:00 a.m. was my greater fear. The climb, and it was a climb, whether it was irregular sized steps, picking your way through stones or at the top feeling your way along the granite, was constant. There was no easy piece. 14 of our colleagues set out, all 14 made it to the Panalaban Huts, 4 with some difficulty, 2 with a little more difficulty.The website suggests you will do this 6 Km climb, 3272m ascent, in 4-5 hours. KM 1 took us 39 mins, KM 2 took 41 mins and KM 3 (2,445m altitude) took 43 mins. We stopped for lunch here - as recommended for acclimatization - and waited for our colleagues to catch up. KM 4 took 75 mins. the incline had increased and our Guide intimated we had got too cold at our last break, it was hard. KM 5 took 79 mins. and KM 6 took 73 mins. We took breaks that got longer after 3 Km. By the time we reached the Hut, it had taken us nearly 6 hours, including our lunch break, to get there.Dinner was good, nourishing,  soup and Spaghetti Neapolitan. The hot tea was spectacular. Beer was available, but no takers. Bed at 8pm in a room with 13 others, that was not a pretty experience. At this point we lost 6 of our 14.Woken up at 2:00 a.m. for our breakfast, tea, toast and peanut butter! We set out at 2:45 a.m, this was a tougher climb in full darkness and rain. KM 7, (381m ascent) took 75 mins, KM 8,(276m ascent) took 72 mins and KM 8.7, (166m ascent) took 51 mins. 6 of us hit the summit at 6:03 a.m. 2 had turned back. We spent 10 - 15 minutes taking various photo's admiring the view, feeling a sense of achievement. Then we went back down! What took us 198 mins to get up this 2nd leg, took us 145 mins to come down. It was not any easier and a little more treacherous going down hill. We arrived back at the hut at 9:30 a.m. We rested for 30 mins and had a slightly better breakfast at the Hut.At 10:15 we started our descent in earnest and what had taken us close to 6 hours to come up, took us 4.5 hours to come down, and it hurt.This was a fantastic experience. It was hard. It is doable. The sense of achievement for a walker was tremendous. The pain lasted 3 days."
601,Perfectly achievable for anyone of average fitness,"Truly a challenge to overcome the physical drain, the rain did not help but definitely an unforgettable experience!"
602,Mountain Torq and Summit,We went with a tour (of only 5 people) and found the place fascinating. Rafflesia in flower was a pleasant surprise. On a day visit it woukd be difficult/expensive to get there for the best wildlife spotting times. The canopy walkway at Poring is impressive.
603,"Mountain climb excellent, accommodation poor.","Did a day trip to the park. Was disappointed with the musuem, and the World Heritage gallery was closed. There was an additional charge for the botanical garden."
604,Be prepared!,"I started from Timpohon gate and I solemnly declare that I underestimated the trail and had overestimated myself. They marked the trail every 0.5km and after the 1st km I was struggling. After the 1.5km mark, you will climb a torturous series of stairs and leave you gasping for air when you reach 2km. By then, you will consider turning back but get on ahead, more challenges awaits.Technically, after the 2km, you are more about climbing stone steps than stairs. When approaching 4km, you will be climbing rocks, so to speak. But the trail is singular, it is almost impossible to get lost there. It is considered well maintain despite the quake that happened.Alas, the mountain had lost a large chunk of its face in the earthquake so you can actually see white spots on the mountain, which signifies fresh rocks. I stopped at Laban Rata and spent a night there. Here's a few tips.1. Along the stony steps, try to walk in zigzag motion to save energy. 2. If you can get to the summit, great! If you can't, the best view is the helipad...not the one used as a volleyball court at Laban rata but about 500m descent from Laban Rata, there is a small trail that lead to a flat circular ground....which is a helipad...there you get unobstructed view to the mountain and the sun."
605,Great Nabalu!!,"I had too much adventure and fun to even dislike anything while i was in Sabah. Food was awesome, the people was awesome.It was an adventure of a lifetime."
606,Spolit by the circus that is the climb to the summit,"Not worth paying the entrance fee if you arent climbing the mountain as there isnt much to do inside the park, you can get great views past the entrance down the road, there are a few bush walks but the dont go far and some where shut off"
607,Plan and be prepared,"If you are thinking about climbing to the summit of Mount Kinabalu you really need to put in some training first to totally enjoy the experience. It's a challenging climb done in two stages but please don't consider it just as a walk in the park. The trip is based over a three day visit. The first day you travel to the Mount Kinabalu national park which is approximately a three hour journey from KK. The journey as you start to wind your way up the mountain is spectacular. There are several ways to do this trip but check that this first stage does include return transportation as several companies only start the excursion from the national park itself. I booked through Suteria Resort which runs the lodges in the park. The first night I spent in one of the lodges and wherever you stay please remember that there is a huge temperature difference between coastal KK and the park area. Warm clothing will guarantee you a good nights sleep. The next day breakfast early as the climbing time starts from 6.30am until 10.00am. The registration is very efficient from booking a guide or a porter if you need one, collecting your pass and insurance and transportation to the gate. Safety is well in hand and the staff very well trained to ensure that you are taken care of. I started at 8.30 am. Hire a climbing stick which only costs RM10 but well worth it as a good support up and down. From 0.5Km onwards you start to climb uphill which is on a narrow path and can be very physical in places. There are several rest stops on the way providing toilet facilities which are clean. This first stage covers 6.5Km to Latan Rata lodge. Depending on your fitness you should estimate anything from 3 hours onwards (extreme case some climbers were still arriving at the lodge at 9pm). All food is provided and is excellent but if you buy drinks etc be prepared to pay higher prices than you would elsewhere as everything is carried up by porters. Your guide will explain to you the safety features and requirements for the second half of the climb after your dinner. Early to bed as you are up by 2.00am for a light breakfast and on your way. This is done in total darkness so buy a headlight before leaving KK and gloves to hold onto the guide ropes. Take water with you as altitude sickness can effect some people and good hydration helps. This second half is the most challenging as for most of it you are hoisting yourself on guide ropes or stepping up over rocks as you ascend. Take your time and be sure to look back at the lights of KK and the towns in the valley below. Stunning. The climb itself covers 2.5Km and you aim to be at the top to greet the sunrise at 6.00am. The last 500 m is hard but once you get to the summit everything is forgotten as the sun rises giving you the most breathtaking views of the mountain and the far distance beyond. Unbelievable. After about 20 - 30 minutes you start to work your way down in daylight and you are happy for being ignorant of what you now see before you which you knew nothing about on your way up. arriving at the lodge you have another breakfast which believe me you will need and a break before starting your final climb back down to Timpohon Gate. Going downhill presents it's own challenge safety being one of them so good grip shoes really helps. Again take your time and enjoy the scenery around you, remember it's not a race and if you have prepared yourself for this journey beforehand you will enjoy the experience. Some people I encountered on the way down were really suffering from aching knees or calves. At the end of it you will either feel relief that you are back in one piece or total exhilaration of what you have achieved. Is it worth the hard work? Definitely and if you have achieved this journey congratulations. I am still riding on a high and feel that nothing is impossible. Enjoy."
608,tough but enjoyable climb via the Mesilau Trail,We hired a taxi for the day to take us to KK national park. This is about an hour and a half from the city but is definitely worth it. It s a beautiful area - the canopy walkway is amazing and the whole area is well kept with great scenery. Poring hot springs s VERY hot and there are 2 waterfalls to walk to. There are also lovely botanical gardens ( extra cost)
609,My 1st G14 mountain,"Extremely corrupted and unhealthy booking system created by Sutera Sanctuary Lodges. They are fully booked 365 days in a year because the slots are given to travel agencies for making more profits. You are not allowed to climb the mountain without paying the expensive dorm bed. Even you are a marathon or experienced trails runner, you are not allowed to hike in one day. Climbing this mountain at such a high cost is contributing to CORRUPTION. A reason why many locals do not go up but the foreigners do. Nature should be FREE for everybody on earth to enjoy but not be used as profit making tool by any individual. Think twice before booking. Think about whether you are making a positive or negative impact to the Malaysians in the long run.Mount Kinabalu is NOT the only mountain on earth. Stop corruption!"
610,"Gruelling, but worth it.",The view scenery is beautiful and i always recommend my friend this is the place we must go once in a life time.
611,great hiking trails for non climbers,"I'm 46 years old and of average fitness. I found the first day's walk up to the Pendant Hut very tiring with the unending steps. When we got level with the Laban Rata guesthouse and had those 3 or 4 flights of wooden stairs to do to get to our own hut, I was at the limits of my stamina. However, recovery was speedy and I was able to come back up them much quicker in the pouring rain after dinner. I honestly don't believe I slept at all between bed at 6.45pm and getting up at 1.30 a.m., and I had my doubts about my capability of reaching the summit. Yes, it was hard, but everyone found it hard to a lesser or greater degree, and, although the rest of my family (including my amazing 10 and 12-year old kids) could go at a faster pace, I was in better shape than some, and reached the summit by sunrise through determination. My hands were painfully cold as the ropes that you use to haul yourself up (easier than walking!) were wet and my gloves got soaked. The wind was bitterly cold and I didn't even have the energy to wipe the condensation off my glasses, but I am still on a massive high, even 10 days later, from knowing that we all, as a family, made it to the top!We did the Walk the Torq circuit of the via ferrata on the way down, which added interest to that early part of the descent. None of us is scared of heights so it was well within our capabilities and was very enjoyable - using your brain as well as those weary legs. The views back up those sheer granite rock faces were spectacular too.By the time we got to the bottom of the mountain, 4 hours later, I never wanted to see another step in my life. I felt like my knees would never recover - yet, strangely, I was absolutely fine from the next day onwards: a little stiffness but nothing major at all. If I'd tried to get a bit fitter for this climb, I'd have found it easier, but it does prove that it's do-able if you maintain a reasonably active life."
612,Awesome views,6th Dec visitWe were told at the park headquarters that one day climb permits are 'unavailable until further notice'No need to book in advance we arrived by bus at 2pm with no booking and could climb the same day.Because you HAVE to do an overnight stay it costs a small fortune - around €250On arrival at the park you pay:Sabah Parks Office:Permit       106RMInsurance 7RMGuide          150RMSutera Sanctuary Lodges:Mountain accommodation/food package 670RM upwardsThe above costs are the minimum and compulsory.  The guide price is per group so can be shared. We were told by the locals in KK the prices have soured since the earthquake even for them.
613,1day climb,"We day-hiked Kinabalu on July 31 and had a spectacular time.  Day-hike you say?  How?  Ok, well it started as we decided late that we wanted to hike Kinabalu.  We arrived in KK with no reservations or plans.  We showed up at the Sutera Lodge office in KK near Wisma Merdeka and found that we could book a 2D1N trip for 1301 RM all-inclusive (for 2 people).  Much better than any prices we saw through tour groups, but still pricey.  So we went to the park headquarters at the base of the mountain.  We chose to stay at the mountain resthouse right outside of the park (200m past it on the left) which had bunks for 20RM/person or private rooms for 60RM/night.  We chose the private room.  After talking to a few people at the resthouse, we found you can sign up to hike Kinabalu in 1 day.  We went to the park office inside the park and talked with them.  Six people max are allowed to try this in any given day.  It's not advertised or possible to sign-up online.  Sometimes you can call to reserve a spot but I hear it's rarely given over the phone.  Reason being is the ranger looks you over to verify if you are fit enough to try it.  So if you don't have plans, just show up and try for this option.  Being athletic, it was an easy decision to let us go.  Do NOT try this if you are not fit - you won't make the time cut-offs (start at 7, must be at Laban Rata around 10 and summit by 1 pm).   We got a late start at 7:30 as there were many things to pay on the morning of in addition to renting poles at the Timpohon gate.  We missed the 10 am cut-off (10:30) but were up in 3 hours, so the guide talked with the rangers and they let us continue on.  We made the summit by before 1:30 and were easily back down to the gate by 5 pm.  Sunny but very windy (60-80kph winds) and we were successful.  The early hiking was pretty hard with the steps, but that was all made up by the fun we had using the ropes on the steep granite pitches above Laban Rata.  Stairs were rough going on the way down.  Take hiking poles if you know how to use them.  Good enough weather allowed us to hike in basic gear.  My wifed hiked in trail runners, hiking pants, merino long-sleep and gore-tex jacket.  I hiked up in nike free's (sandals on the way down for more cushion), shorts, dri-fit t-shirt and rain jacket, and a hat to keep the sun off.  Total cost for two of us to hike Kinabalu was 375 RM.  Included all fees, taxi to/from gate, guide fees, etc.  We brought our own food for the hike (granola bars, snickers, and water).  We also gave our guide Duhisin a 100RM tip as he was awesome and really helped my wife up (it was her first high mountain summit).  He held her hand to steady her as the altitude took it's toll above 4000M.  Tip 1 - mountain resthouse is worth the stay.  Heated showers plus decent food.  Tip 2 - for a great post hike meal, stay inside the park and go to the fancy restaurant (not the buffet).  There's a free shuttle from the hotel.  It's a little pricey, but the steak and spaghetti are awesome."
614,Mt Kinabalu Climb,The air is very fresh and quite cold. The food there are not very good .Bring along own food if staying in apartments so can cook.Try staying at the bottom of the mountain so can see a very clear view of the mountain peak.
615,"Experience of a lifetime, but research before you go","April is supposed to be a dry and good month for the climb. We reach Laban Rata with a water rationing even as the mountain has not been getting good water supply for the past couple of months. However, our climb on 5th April was hindered by heavy rain which was unexpected. Some faster climbers got to the summit before the rain worsen while the rest of us were stranded and prevented from climbing further for saety precautions. The overall climb wasn't easy. On day 1 everything was fine and good. We had a good time overcoming each 500m. Day 2 attempt to climb to summit was fine too except for weather. But the fatigue sets in on the way down the mountain AFTER Laban Rata. Perhaps, we rested too long after defreezing ourselves at Laban Rata.Food at Laban Rata is mere fuel. I didn't have appetite due to the altitude but the RM13 cup of milo is real saviour! Mighty hot and satisfying. After the climb up, we appreciated everything they have there as every porter painstakingly carry every items climbers need to the lodging and restaurant. Thus the RM13 is fully acceptable to us. We stayed in a heated room with a tub of water and warm beds - but you have to expect people to walk throughout the night somehow so dun expect a good night sleep. Some climbers we met told us they never really sleep at all! I had 2 good sleep cycles, i think."
616,Gruelling climb worth every step for the achievement!,"The highlight of our 2 weeks in borneo!!!! Take a head torch, gloves and warm clothes - you need them. But the lighter your backpack is the better so dont go overboard. We booked with climbingmtkinabalu.com which were the cheapest company we found and still provided excellent service. My friend and i were in a group with 6 others and 2 guides, you can all go at your own pace so theres no pressure. Parts were difficult but the satisfaction of reaching the top was a once in a lifetime experience! We were worried about the difficulty after seeing some reviews but just do it!!!!!!!!"
617,I made it!,"Spectacular moonscape granite on the top, but a long, hard slog to get there and no real view to speak off - simply clouds all around below when we went... and an even more painful slog down - hard on the knees/ligaments!"
618,Stunning and worth the challenge,"Tough but challenging, worth a visit in a lifetime. The climb to Laban Rata (halfway accomodation before the peak climb) was okay, but you need to be physically fit and train climbing stairs. The climb to the peak was really not easy, you have to be a very persistant person, if not, you give up easily half-way to the peak. Bring a motivator along with you to climb, encourage one another not to give up and you're on your way to reaching the peak. I managed to encourage, push and pull my wife until we reached the peak. Once you reach the peak, the satisfaction was beyond words. Until today, we still feel that the climb was worth everything. Anyway, the accomodation at Laban Rata was so-so, water heater was spoilt, very cold to shower without heater, probably you have to rub your bodies only if heater not working."
619,"A must-do if in Sabah, Borneo","The Mt Kinabalu non-summit walk is the easier part of the walk - KM0 to KM4, but is still fairly steep and hundreds of steps. Wear appropraite footwear and bring an extra layer as it does get surprisingly chilly at KM4. We were very lucky it didn't rain, but it is very common so bring waterproofs/umbrella.It took 2.5hrs to get to KM4, and 2hrs to get back down.Wish we had done the 2d/1n summit climb as felt bit disappointed to go all that way (1hr+ transfer) just to do 5 hrs walk, and everyone else seemed to be doing full trek.But its not always guaranteed that you will be able to go to the summit on day 2 if it is bad weather."
620,Difference between 1 day and 2 days climb of the Mt Kinabalu,"If you love the outdoors and want to climb a mountain, start with this. Most exhilarating 2 days of my life, make sure you do the top (Mt Kinabalu), the tip of Borneo (where the South China Sea meets Sulu Sea) and tap (water rafting) when in Sabah."
621,Worth the trip,"I climbed Mt Kinabalu during my trip to Kota Kinabalu. My fitness level is relatively good for my age (late 40's) though I am not an experienced trekker. The conclusion first, it is true that anybody can climb this mountain as a mountain guide leads you the way (hiring a mountain guide is mandatory). However, you should really maintain your walking pace and be extra careful when descending. I slipped and fell a couple of times on a slippery slope and heard a couple of people got injured and ended up being carried on guides' back (and paying a lot of money for the transport). The booking process was a hassle, as they restrict the number of climbers to 135 per day. You have to book accommodations in advance (a day trip is not permitted. You have to spend at least one night in one of the mountain lodges). Many people make reservations through tour operators but I directly contacted Sutera Resort, which manages all mountain lodges inside Kinabalu Park, and made reservations for a bunk bed in Laban Rata Resthouse (this is the most expensive dormitory I have ever stayed in my life...and I didn't even get hot shower because of the rainy weather).Since I had time, I stayed at a hotel near the park entrance a day before the climb. I recommend this pre-climb stay in the area to acclimate and start the climb earlier (the weather is better in the morning , at least it was that way in June). This climb is super expensive for foreigners. However, the sunrise view at the mountain top was truly breathtaking and I am very happy that I did it!"
622,Challenging but completely worth it!,"A fantastic experience. I couldn't recommend enough. It's a tough few days, but the reward of getting to the summit at sunrise is wort it.There are a load of tour companies offering climb packages which work out expensive. I arranged it direct instead, which was easy and half the price. All you need to do is contact the accommodation place on the mountain and get that booked. You can then rock up by 10am on the day and sort everything else out there in a matter of minutes (guide etc). You can either stay near the mountain the night before, or in KK. I did the latter and got a taxi to the mountain in the morning (it takes about 1.5 hours). I then got a public bus back to KK the next day for peanuts. Easy!"
623,Experience of a lifetime,"Step training, step training, step training.  I cannot emphasise that enough and rent the hiking pole if you don't have your own, they are a life saver.  If like me your are not super fit, get the porter to carry your bags up.  Tried the Via Ferrata and loved it but if you do it after climbing Low's Peak just be prepared for an exhausting day."
624,Mount Kinabalu,"For me it was a experience  "" a once in lifetime"" - and I didn't make it! My wife did, and she was very happy. In the meantime, some years later we wished to try again, but it was sold out for the next 6 weeks! - You have to do early bookings!; - this was some years ago, but I guess it's can be still a problem today. That's life - what happened? well, we arrived Laban Rata after the first day, everything ok, no problems and after a shower and a good dinner it was  early bedtime this evening.  A good night sleep, a new day with an very early breakfast and a relaxed start for this short climb up on the summit to reach the sunrise, I thought. Still dark outside, headlight on and suddenly after just half an hour it was a totally stop for me!? Both the breath and the legs refused to work anymore. No experience at all of climbing at such altitude, what went wrong? After a short stop, it felt like everything was fine again. A discussion with my wife and our guide - I told them, they have to continue and I will go down slowly to the rest house after a long break. The guide was looking after me for 10 minutes more and then I was alone, maybe only some 300 - 400 m below the summit and waiting for the sunrise down there, with my water bottle, only :) It became a beautiful day later and we went slowly down the mountain again to Timpohon Gate,  after some cups of coffee , + many breaks and many pics.Two more unforgettable days in Sabah, thank you so much :)"
625,Difficult & Rewarding,We did it alone without a tour. We left from Kota Kinabalu and get there by small bus! When you get there you have little shop but we recommend you to buy some snack before! There are many trek more or less difficult but all of them are awesome :) we spend a very good day there!  Kinabalu Mount have to be done!
626,It's hard!,"We attempted to climb Mount Kinabalu in August 2018, and an average climber would be able to reach Laban Rata Resthouse in about 5 hours (though some people were able to do it in 3 hours). My fitness tracker estimated that we had climbed 340 equivalent floors and 18,000 steps to reach the resthouse. The stay at Laban Rata was comfortable though there was no indoor heating at all. However we were unlucky, and were not able to do the summit climb due to bad weather (the summit had been closed for 7 consequent nights). The best time to climb is April and May during the summer months instead."
627,Bit Boring,"I'm fairly fit and healthy but still suffered a little from altitude sickness. I was grumpy up the last section to the summit but when I got there and the sun came up... WOWOn the way down we did the via ferrate, definitely recommend itIt can get cold and wet towards the top so be prepared."
628,"Unbelievable Experience, Amazing Views, Not to be Missed!","I was there post-earthquake and some trails were closed for safety reasons. During that time, we were only allowed up to Laban Rata at 3,100 metres. By the time you read this, Mt Kinabalu should be fully open again, restored to its former pre-earthquake grandeur. The hike up comes with beautiful coniferous plants and to visitors' convenience, sufficient toilets and pit stops were built along the trail.Being a prime tourist attraction in Malaysia, the paths aren't as rugged as I thought it would be, if that's what you're looking for. However it was a challenging climb, and more so this being my virgin hike! I was walking side to side for a couple of days."
629,Possible to Climb in 1 day?  YES!,"Glad to be able to reach Low's Peak of Mt KK (4095.2m). The landscape of the submit is spectacular. The rocks formation are so beautiful.We went in a group of 8pax and we booked a 2 days 1 night climb with Amazing Borneo Tours. They provided us with 2 guides. Both guides were very professional. Some may think that we do not really need a guide but there are some areas of the climb that the guide really help us to descend the rocky areas safely. We are ladies on an average age group of 28 to 33 years old and this is the first trekking for most of us. Prior training like walking, jogging, cycling, yoga and walking upstairs 2 months before the trip is useful. The first day trek from Timpohon Gate to Laban Rata (6km) took us around 5.5 hrs to 6.25 hrs (9am to 3.15pm). The second day trek from Laban Rata to Low's Peak (2.5km) took us around 3.25 hrs to 4 hrs (2.30am to 6.30am). The descend from Low's Peak back to Laban Rata took us around 2.5 hrs (6.30am to 9am) and from Laban Rata back to Timpohon Gate took us around 4.5hrs to 6hrs (10.30am to 4.30pm). None of us suffer from any sever high altitude sickness as the pace that we ascended the climb is not too fast.* Tips: Using 2 walking sticks is really a very good support from Timpohon Gate to Laban Rata (vice verse). You do not need to use the walking sticks from Laban Rata to Low's Peak as your hands need to be free to hold the rope on some area. Sleeping in the unheated dormitory is almost impossible as it is very cold at night. Try to keep yourself warm and bring lightweight winter clothes as layering. A good wind breaker is essential as the wind is very strong when you hike to Low's Peak."
630,Kinabalu via Mesilau,"when you rich the top for sunrise at 5,30 in the morning all your efforts will be repaid with the beautiful view and strong amazing feeling.Keep this feeling with you as long as you can, live intensely the moment and enjoy it becouse after that moment you will start to descend, painful descent, and if while you are going down you find a knee, is probabily mine, bring it back to me.please."
631,Be prepared for a challenge,Worth every cent! Most packages offer online might seem expensive but the view and experience is priceless! Our guide was amazing and super patient. We'll definitely be back for another climb!
632,This was nearly the hardest thing I have ever done,"Having climbed Mt Rinjani in Lombok Indonesia last month, I am now writing a review to compare these 2 mountains. I climbed Mt Kinabalu in late June 2012.  The main differences for me were:1) Scenery: I found that Kinabalu's main view was of course at the summit. At the rest stops there was not much to see but knowing that I am at cloud level always excites me. Perhaps the climb was tough therefore I could not enjoy the view much? At Mt Kinabalu, I also did Mountain Torq's Via Ferrata (which I highly recommend for the adventurous. Do not attempt if you have acrophobia as you might see your life flash before you) as this allows access to the restricted parts of the mountain that is not accessible via a normal descent (which means you get to literally balance off a rockface and enjoy the amazing views).Mt Rinjani, on the other hand, has a lot of wildlife to see throughout the climb, not just a great view at the summit.There are also mountain ranges, crater, lake, waterfalls, hot spring, river crossing, bridges etc. At the campsites of Rinjani you also see heaps of litter. 2) Altitude:Mt Kinabalu is 4095m while Mt Rinjani is 3726m high. I think that is not much of a difference.  However, climbing Kinabalu in 2 days means one would gain a lot of altitude quickly. I suffered from altitude sickness - constant headaches just before arriving at accommodation, loss of appetite so I did not have dinner at all, vomiting, giddy spells, unable to sleep at night, and the guides even advised to carry me to lower altitude. The next morning I was fine and made it to the summit. I learnt my lesson... so for Mt Rinjani, I opted for a 4 days climb. I also brought effervescent electrolyte tablets which I consumed at a rate of 1 tablet every 1.5 hours but drank that only during the climb. Bring warm clothing, gloves and beanie as the weather is unforgiving at the summit. My friend who wears spectacles said to avoid wearing contact lens for the summit climb as it can get very dry. 3) Terrain:There are more stair-like steps in Mt Kinabalu and relatively steep as well. That means when descending, your knees are most vulnerable unless you have very long legs and use your walking pole efficiently. I find that taping the knees help. Mt Kinabalu requires good pacing and momentum. Mt Rinjani was mostly gentle slopes, little stairs, rocks and boulders, gravel, volcanic ash. I felt Mt Rinjani needed more technique, a little bit like rock climbing knowing which rock to step on to help you push off and reduce power output etc. One would more likely sprain their ankles climbing Rinjani than Kinabalu.4) Facilities:At the accommodation for Kinabalu (Laban Rata), there are proper toilets and shower rooms but it is cold water and you can eat at the restaurant. Bunk beds are the way to go. You may also charge your electronics here. For Rinjani, you live in tents and earth is your toilet. Meals are prepared by your guides normally and usually from scratch. I went fishing by the lake with our guide and porters and that was our lunch. There is the lake, small waterfalls and hot spring to make you feel cleaner. No socket to charge your electronic appliances here so don't go trigger happy when using your camera. Overall, both mountains are exceptionally beautiful and remember that not many people are able to enjoy the views from above unless they climb it. Reward yourself with some seafood in the city after Mt Kinabalu climb and relax by the beach at Gili Islands after Mt Rinjani."
633,Amazing experience!,"Its about the only cool place on the island most of the year round so is a respite to the heat and humidity everywhere else.  the whole area has a very special specific eco system, plants creatures so get out there and experience.the climb up Kinabalu is long with steps and steps and steps.  There are regular rest stops and bathrooms which is a great benefit and prevents pollution of the areas. The 2am start on summit day is supreme as is the climb htough the dark.  Don't get up there too early as it gets real cold quick if you are sweaty from the climb.  the sun breaks horizon just after 6am and supplies great vistas.  then its best to start heading the long long way down.Even the fittest will have burning quads and calves by thye end of the day and for several days after.Its an exciting rewarding climb - be prepared for the cold and wet, take a walking pole this helps massively coming down and be mindful if you have any leg or knee problems and make you chopices wisely."
634,Must do Experience!,We had tour guide Keddy and he made all the difference.He was knowledgable and helpful.The experience was lovely too.
635,Its worth it and just do it!,Mount Kinabalu is undoubted one of the best destination for climber and trekker.  Climbing Mt Kinabalu is not an easy task.  Elevation gain is around 1500m in one day.  Not so much problem with altitude sickness but good fitness is needed to attempt the climb. It is recommended to take the 3 days package as this will allow you more time to acclimatize to the altitude.  Have a nice rest at the foothill is a bonus. Acommodation is widely available at the foothill and Kinabalu Park. Climb begin on next morning and overnight at Laban Rata (3300m). Summit day on next morning and normally start at 2:30 am as to catch the sunrise when reaching the summit. View on mount Kinabalu is absolutely stunning and breath taking.  The descent is even harder after you spent all your energy on the summit attempt.  Do remember to visit Poling Hot spring.  It is a real bonus after a long hike.
636,Fantastic experience!,"We took a bus from KK up to the national park, stayed at D'Villa Rina Ria, for two nights, and explored the area, then caught the bus on to Sandakan. We are a moderately fit 66 yr old and a very fit 63 year old who are experienced bush walkers. We weren't interested in slogging up to the top of the mountain, but wanted to do some walking in the national park to experience the jungle, and for Lan to look at birds. We arrived late morning, and the cloud was already down on the mountain, so we couldn't see the peak. Nevertheless we entered the park, and did some preliminary exploring. There is a loop road of about 2-3 km, and this passes the very pretty botanical garden, so we walked through that too. We also got a map of the walks and planned the following day. We decided on a loop of about 6 - 7 km, beginning with the Kiau View Trail which starts at the park gate. At the end of that, when we hit the power station road we would walk up it for about a kilometre, before turning right and returning via the Mempening Trail. The day dawned bright, and after walking the 800 m up to the park gate, we headed into the bush at about 7.30am, admiring the magnificent view of the mountain  from the viewpoint on the way. The walk started very steeply, and even though it hadn't rained heavily the night before, the trail was wet and muddy, so we had to tread warily and negotiate carefully. After a while it levelled off, and we were able to enjoy the peace of the jungle as we walked. There were supposed to be views from this trail, but they had long ago been overgrown. We made slow but steady progress along this enjoyable walk, and after about 2 hours, emerged onto the power station road. This is pretty steep, and the walk up it was tough going (reminding us why we hadn't climbed the mountain). After perhaps a km, we came to the clearly marked entrance to the Mempening Trail and headed down it. While there was again lots of mud to negotiate, this was a great trail which worked around the sides of hills and across ridges, slowly descending to the rivers far below. The first real bird activity was down near the bottom of this trail, and Lan was excited to see  green magpies, Bornean treepies, a rufus woodpecker, speckled laughing thrushes and more. This trail met the Silau Silau Trail at the river, so we turned right and followed that for a few hundred metres before emerging onto the loop road we had walked on the day before. It was then just a tough trudge back up the hill to the park centre. By the time we dropped onto our chairs at the very good restaurant opposite the park gates, we had been walking for five hours including stops to chat to the couple of people we met, looking at birds, and the occasional rest in the few huts along the way. Sadly, the cloud had again descended on the mountain so we were not able to see it again, but we were very satisfied after an enjoyable morning's walk."
637,"Great Mountain, good resort, great retreat","This is my ninth hike up the mountain over the last 20 odd years. I call it a hike because it is actually 'a hike' rather than climb. Even at the steepest point where you use the rope to pull yourself up, the guides are actually walking up. I am active and do between 10-15 hours of exercise weekly including daily run/fast hike. I would not call this an easy hike. No, I am not one of those super human that summit the mountain and go down in 2 hours plus. If you are one of those, this review is not for you.The trail is all uphill and if you think it's going to get easier on the way up, think again! 6km to the rest house. This is the place you rest for a few hours before continuing summit push next morning as the one day summit trip is no longer available at this point in time. All the facilities are very basic as you can read from other reviews. The food is surprising good though or maybe I was hungry after the hike. The girls at the reception where you buy the food make you feel like you owe her something. Not only she is not friendly and ask me 'what you want?' as I approached to by a can of Coke Zero, there was no 'thank you' or another word from her other than grabbing the money of my hand. I guess this is monopoly right? You are pretty much at the middle of nowhere, take it or leave it! Who cares about customer service up here? The accomodation is pretty basic. Like backpackers lodge. Don't expect any luxury. I was carrying 20kg backpack up to this point (the rest house), so the summit without backpack (you can leave it in the rest house at your own risk) seems relatively easy. Although I was counting roughly, out of the 130 booked to go to summit that day, I can see the most 50 summits that day. So don't underestimate how hard this hike can be. It took me 4 hours return trip to summit and back to rest house including a short break at the summit. The summit is a very small piece of real estate, do what you have to do and get out of there before you get squashed by other tourists. Forget about waiting for sunrise at summit. There is a flat spot a few hundred meters down where you can have the whole open space to yourself and enjoy the same sunrise and even lie down! Believe me, this will be the best thing you ever done in this trip rather than shifting every two minutes at the summit for another tourist to take pictures. Summit sunrise is overrated and over crowded. Ask the guide and he should be able to tell you where this open space with sunrise view is. Going downhill is easier on your cardiovascular system but hard on your leg. The steps are very uneven and slippery. Get a pair of good hiking boots with ankle protection stiffer sole that can allow you to hike on hard uneven sizes rock. You can use a joggers, in my opinion joggers are not safe as the terrain is quite ruggered. The trail is well tracked but one slip and sprain your ankle, there goes your holiday - which I have witnessed in the past. Enjoy the hike!"
638,"Be prepared, and enjoy.....","It's worth to visit the Poring Spring at the Kinabalu Park, where with RM3 for Malaysian and RM4 for non-malaysian, one can enjoy the greenaries and nice view...once enter the park, there are a few attractions...the most worth it one is the Canopy Walk at the poring spring (additonal RM3for malaysian and RM4 for non malaysian and RM5 per camera). It is worth the climb.. one have to climb a short distance/path to reach the beginning of the canopy walk hut but all the sweat is worth it when one reach the canopy walk and enjoy the scenic view from the top...however other attractions such as the spring itself was abit disappointed, the butterfly farm in there is also not worth the addtional payment to enter, there are also a tropical garden and orchird conservation center which one has to pay extra to enter, however, there seems to be no visitors and with only of us, we dare not enter the attractions..as it's too tranquil and quiet for our comfort. Also there are two water falls, quite a walking distance(from 1km to more than 3km) from the entrance...so if want to go, better go in a group and one are advice not to go to the waterfall after 2pm, as it will be too late to hike back to the gate which closes at 6.30pm,. overall, if you have not much time to spare, just the Canopy Walk is worth the trip there..."
639,Nice and refreshing,"Go to the Junction lead to Mesilau, there is a very big open space, which give you the magnificent view of the whole span of the mountain and the valley in Mesilau"
640,Prepare and enjoy!,"The trip up is rather long. The mountain was very overcast so you couldn""t see much."
641,"Tough But Challenging, Worth A Visit In A Lifetime","Do not trust the guidebooks saying it is an easy climb. Especially if you have any knee or spine problems. If you do not have your own hiking poles do not hesitate and rent them at the entrance to the park. Your knees will thank you for it!The head torch for night climb to the Low's Peak is a must as well as warm clothes, as it can be freezing cold at the top. The gloves recommended for the rope climbing part.As I mentioned, it is tough but the sunrise views on the top are simply breathtaking and compensate for all your effort.If you have not reserved  your climb in advance try directly with Sutera Sanctuary Lodges in Kota Kinabalu, their office is located at Wisma Sabah building. We were lucky and managed to book our climb for the next day. Moreover, they have good prices, we have paid MYR 650 per person."
642,worth a visit if you are in the region,"Our climb was fantastic! It was organised through a travel expert who also arranged for our local guides. We were instructed to bring appropriate footwear and clothing and for good reasons - you will need it. It's surprising to see how many people hike and climb the mountain in their gym gear. While that may feel alright in the lower region of the mountain, once you get past Laban Rata the granite surface can get slippery  - you definitively want footwear with a good grip. This is equally important on the way down. The descent can be equally challenging. The descent is particularly harsh on your toes and you want to make sure that your ankles have proper support too. If you are buying new footwear, make sure you wear it in before the climb. Wear hiking socks too. Raincoat is a must and do wear lots of layers.While it is true that you don't have to be exceptionally fit to climb Mount Kinabalu, please note that this may not be your usual Sunday hike. I would recommend this climb only to those who have a regular exercise regime in place, otherwise you may find that you are genuinely struggling, and the last thing you want is doing something you don't enjoy or worse, something that jeopardises your health and wellbeing. I really enjoyed the climb to Mount Kinabalu but have to admit it was hard work, especially climbing at night. We were lucky to have with us outstanding local guides who know the mountain and looked after our group very well. Standing atop of Mount Kinabalu is the most amazing experience, and watching the sun rise above the clouds makes the climb even more rewarding and memorable. If you come prepared, hopefully too it will be pain free."
643,Nice View,The Via Ferrata Walk the Torque was an additional adventure in itself. Demanding enough without being too difficult for the reasonably fit. The lesser used Mersilau trail that we descended by was another scenic back to nature hike. My second time in Kinabalu. Will be back!
644,Are you fit. And way the fee.,If your are preparing the treck the mountain .. then go for it .. it is one of the heights peak of SE asia.  Normally the trek is a bit tiring .. but normal bodied people should make it comfortably .
645,Inexpensive buffet with great harbor views and air-conditioning,"Accommodation inside the park is a monopoly and 10times the price of accommodation outside - its a clear exploitation by the hotel company but this appears to have been the case for a while.  Unfortunately, there is nowhere else to stay if you decide to climb over 2days instead of one (very tough to do in one day and liable for poor visibility later in the day).  Whilst the food is good at the lodge, the facilities are fairly basic for the money (no hot water available) but as long as you know its going to be a bit of a rip off and just concentrate on the mountain climbing then it's fine."
646,Majestic Mt Kinabalu,"A steady 4-5hrs uphill from Timpohon Gate will get you to your overnight accommodation. We were first there and enjoyed an (unexpected) cool water shower in the Pendant Hut.A detailed and informative briefing on the via ferrata routes by the Mountain Torq guides was followed by a lovely buffet dinner at Laban Rata Guesthouse.Then it was early to bed to get some much needed rest before the 0130hrs wakeup, some toast and tea, then a 0230hrs departure.The 3 hrs to the summit was steep and slow with traffic jams (140 people on the trail at once), but still had plenty of time to reach the Low's Peak summit 4,095m before dawn and watch the amazing sunrise.Plenty of time to walk around the summit area and check out the various peaks, see the amazing vistas and get back down to the Low's Peak Circuit Via Ferrata start point at 3,776m by 0730hrs.4 hrs of great moderate grade via ferrata, including 3 different bridge crossings took us back to the summit trail and return to Pendant Hut for second breakfast around 12 midday.It was a slow 4.5 hrs trip back down the mountain for us as our legs were suffering by then.All up - a very enjoyable experience. Amazing views (clear at sunrise), mild weather (15 degrees at Pendant Hut and approx 8 degrees at summit), persistent rain in the afternoon on the way down.Amazing Borneo were very good in getting us to / from the mountain and organising guides etc.Mountain Torq run a very polished via ferrata operation.Tips- 1. do plenty of pre-trip training, 2. travel light, 3. keep well hydrated and be self sufficient with nutrition, 4. have suitable layers of clothing, including a good quality outershell / raincoat."
647,Challenging but worth every ounce of effort!,It took the majority of our party about 4 hours to get to Laban Rata and a further 3+ hours the next morning to get to the peak.
648,Be Prepared,"Our climb up Mount Kinabalu will never be forgotten. Every step of the way was memorable, exciting and challenging. It's a climb so you wont find many (if any) flat points but there are lots of opportunities for rest along the way. And it's well worth stopping because the trail is full of interesting plants, trees and creatures. The trail is well maintained. Our arrival at Laban Rata was met with surprise - what a great place! Nearly at the top of the mountain, you have all the creature comforts one could hope for. Clean linens, towels, proper showers, great food and a stunning view. Our guide was friendly, helpful and we learned a lot about the area. The climb to the peak is absolutely an amazing experience...a string of headlamps silently trekking along the face of an incredible iconic mountain. The only safety risk is wary legs so taking your time is advisable.....as the greatest test is the walk down. At the bottom, the feeling of accomplishment is indescribable and your leg muscles won't let you soon forget the experience. Don't plan on doing much of anything after the hike except treating yourself to a good feed and somewhere nearby to rest your tired limbs. We had a great stay pre- and post- hike at quiet J. Residence which is a very short walk from the Park's entrance. Overall, this experience is not to missed on any trip to Sabah."
649,Nice cooling place.,"Mount Kinabalu was my first mountain I ever climbed and it is definitely worth the experience. As most people, I underestimated the mountain too, it is more challenging that you probably think. But it is more about your stamina, endurance and mental toughness. After all, you are not in a hurry to climb up, just take your sweet time, enjoy the views and take rest when needed."
650,Breathtaking View.,And maybe the most spectacular one too!Visited Kinabalu National Park in November. A beautiful park and a spectacular view. Really enjoyed it. Did not do any of the hiking tours though; that I will do next time even though the climb is rather demanding.
651,Arduous slog with sense of achievement.,"Mount Kinabalu. A name I will never forget. My first trek and mountain. I booked through amazing borneo and they made everything so smooth, easy and reliable. For a start you need to know that climbing this monstrous rock behemoth is not an easy task, in fact it is really quite difficult. I am a 19 year old male, in good shape and a high fitness and I still found it really tough. The main thing is to pace yourself, remain confident, don't rush and drink plenty of water. If you do all of those things and come well prepared, KINABALU will just be the name of another trophy on your wall."
652,Fantastic experience,It was majestic looking and amazing. I wish we could've scaled it to the peak. But we were both mentally and physically unprepared. The view from the foot of the mountain itself was already breath-taking.
653,Hardest clmib EVER,"For a reasonable fit person, the 6km trail hike via Timpohon gate should be under 8 hrs up to the Laban Rate rest house. It will start with a reasonable easy 2 km then gradually steeper slopes from 2km mark to 4km mark (main rest point @ Layang Layang rest house). After Layang Layang checkpoint, comes the wonderful super steep 2km slope climb towards the Laban Rata rest house @ 6km mark. We are blessed with wonderful weather without any major rain throughout our trip and was given a eagle view on the kampong Kundasang at slightly below 5km mark.If you go by an adventure group, your group will provide you with lunch (in our case, it is a packed sandwiches with banana and egg). I was very luckily to be given advice by a local to carry eggs instead of energy bars just the night before. The eggs are savers as they replenish energy faster and easier to eat also. Bring along rehydration salts/sugar packs just in case, I only know realized that we are losing so much water and salt from the high altitude climb while ascending.For pit stop resting, try not to rest more than 5 mins per pit stop especially the weather tends to turn cold fast after 4pm and the skies will turn black after 6.30pm. The air will turn cold and thin as you climb higher so do be prepared against the cold winds especially in higher altitude as there will be lesser and lesser trees after 5.5km.As for the resting area, our group are given an awfully cold hut so for anyone who are awfully scared of cold - PLEASE BRING YOUR OWN SLEEPING BAG/ THERMAL BLANKETS JUST IN CASE. This is really not a joke unless you managed to book the heated rooms. Our hut was pretty cold to sleep in so not everyone can sleep well except for the Korean couple who bought their own sleeping bags to sleep on their beds in our hut.I had the unfortunate case of having my monthly timing clash with the climb and I didn't not seek for doctor to defer it as I thought it was nearing the end but the day I ascend, the flow was awfully heavy and I can say it is REALLY REALLY tough with every step ascending upwards. My ascending trip took me 10 hours - I only reached the rest house after 7.15pm! If that is not scary, there is a case of a girl being ported up in my group after 9.30pm! That's why I strongly advise every girls who wants to climb to make sure your relative is not visiting you during the trip or seek medical help to delay it if possible.I did not make it to the peak of the submit in order to rest. But it took me more than 8 hours to descend in my condition. I think almost everyone in our group had their kneecap in pretty bad condition. But this won't stop me from trying to reach the submit again when my health returns."
654,"Once in a lifetime experience, but once is enough","Mt Kinabalu is the highest peak in SE Asia. It takes 5 hours on the average to climb to the base camp where you spend a night there. You make the climb to the summit at about 3.00am in the morning so you can see the sunrise. What an awesome sight from the summit and even on the way down, the sunrise is so beautiful."
655,Deserves title of 'Majestic',The key icon of Sabah.  A must visit site.  Dominating the view for 100km around.  The tallest peak between Himalayas and PNG. Entrance fee very low (RM 3 for locals or permanent residents and 15 for foreigners).  Key limitation is restriction to only 100 permits to climb the mountain a day and a 6 month waiting list.  However permits are available at shorter notice through travel agents.  Even without climbing the peak there are many trails open to visitors on the lower slopes passing along rivers and through forests with some great views.  It is also possible to drive  or walk up 4 km of road from the park HQ to the gate to the peak. There is also a botanical garden and a natural history museum which are both worth  visits
656,worth the slog,"We decided to embark on an adventure and challenge ourselves along with our 9yr old son. Well we certainly did the later!. This was one of the most challenging trails I have ever experienced. The trail itself resembles a steep river bed and actually turns into one following the rains - which happens most afternoons. The sections where you have to pull yourself up via a hand rope is quite grueling and can be quite dangerous in the dark when your headtorch malfunctions :( The dormatory accommodation for the c.5hr semi-sleep is pretty basic and I would recommend ear plugs to block out the snoring of the fellow climbers.Warning: the trail map that indicates ""refreshments"" every 2.5km or so acti"
657,Magnificient View at the top,As long as you take your time you should not suffer! We did the climb as part of our honeymoon and it was fantastic. It is hard but totally worth it. Try and get to the top if you can. Wonderful.
658,Best mountain in Southeast Asia.,"The best birthday gift and it will be the moment in my life, book through Amazing borneo.The first 6km is ok, the hard part is the second part where start at 2.30am up to submit. We took the new trail - Ranau Trail, which have a lot of stairs. Is dark , lack of oxygen and tired.But is worth when you had reach the ground where 1km more to the Low's peak. Low's peak is not as low as you think. =) The other hard part is when descending the total 8.5KM in 1 day.Great hike."
659,My Kota kinabalu experience,A crazy hike but well worth it....even if you can only go for the day. The park is beautiful and the air is great.
660,Heaven on Earth,A must to visit &/or climb if time permit - an icon of Sabah ‘land below the wind’. Local claim its rising 5 cm every year.The flora|fauna beneath the mountain are just amazing & fresh air. And also the world smallest orchid besides many others.For best view of the mountain be there before 10:00am or else view a foggy mountain 🤗Will rate 5 when I get on top!
661,Beauty of Mount Kinabalu and the islands,"The two day climbing of Mount Kinabalu is not for the faint of heart nor for the weak of body. It can be compared to 6 straight kms of stair climbing followed by 3 kms of negotiating a steep and slippery moonscape by clinging on to a white rope - the latter during the night. I did not train for this serious hike and regretted that. The following gear is essential: above all rent walking sticks, or at least one, to assist you in the descent. I was literally walking with my hands the last 3 kms. Further you need warm clothing for the heights above 3500 meters, good raingear (we had tropical rainshowers both going up and down, the only place it rained during our holiday in Sabah), gloves for holding on the white rope and occasionally the rock. A bright headlight for walking in the dark with both hands free. High energy foods. A water bottle which can be refilled at a number of rest stops along the way. Preferably also light and quick drying synthetic sports clothing rather than cotton shirts and jeans in order to quickly get rid of transpiration. And everything as light weight as possible - the many bearers you see lugging goods to Laban Rata up to full propane gas tanks are rewarded a generous 7 ringgit per kilo, so that tells you how heavy the lifting is.Upon reaching the top at a literally breathtaking 4095 m above sea level, you are rewarded with stunning views and you can take turns to take a photo at the summit this is where being slow is an advantage, since at least you get there at daylight. And finally stick to trodden path and listen to the guide. Talk at the summit was also about the German tourist who fatally fell from the mountain in early February by straying from the white rope near the summit. No need to let this incident keep you from doing the climb, many hundreds of people return safely at the base every day, but continuous focus and vigilance are called for."
662,"Amazing view, beautiful summit!","The mountain is beautiful and magnificent and if you were to visit the mountain park to take pictures of the mountain, you would need to be there around 6am to 8am Malaysian Time. This is the time where there is less clouds or mist. There are other sites which you can observe more of the splendour of the mountain as when you are driving away from the mountain the view of the mountain is better than at the park surprisingly. From the park the mountain appear smaller, reachable and scalable whereas from the other sites it really looks great, magnificent and scary i.e. too high for you to ever reach its peak. One such site is the Poropok View, KM 47 Jalan Ranau. Besides the mountain you should also visit the hot spring at Pot Poring.  This place appears clean and organised. Quite fun really and I can see children really loves it, dipping their bodies into the hot spring water. I enjoyed myself there too.The other must visit places in Kota Kinabalu is the Islands. The 3 islands I have visited are Sapi, Mamutik and Manukan. You can actually visit these 3 islands all in one day but you need to be there early and be at the ticket counter at 8.30am (I was told). You can actually visit these Islands yourself by buying the ferry tickets from Jesselton Point on the very same day. I quite like Borneo Ferry Tour and Travels. I was late, reach there somewhat 9 to 10am so we only manage to go for 2 islands for RM40.20 per pax - the last boat back from the Islands  is at 4pm.  I regretted I didn't do snorkelling there though as they do have many types of fishes near the beaches for you to see. (Note a lot of people tend to prefer going to Sapi Island).We stayed at Gaya Centre Hotel in Kota Kinabalu town, and this hotel is clean and comfortable and have excellent and friendly staff - good value for the price we paid.  I did online purchase of the room through Booking.com to get a discounted rate. This hotel is the centre of all the activities such as Jesselton Point, New Shopping Mall Suria, near the night markets, 15 to 20 min walk to philipino markets, wet market and gaya sunday market. Near the philipino market they sell this fish ball cracker which is quite tasty i.e. this is for human consumption - although it looks like the fish food you would give to those lovely gold fishes.We actually spent one night at the mountain park (Rock hostel), then proceed to Pot Poring the next day with kundasang as well before reaching the Kota Kinabalu town to stay for 2 more nights at Gaya Centre hotel. I totally enjoy myself at Kota Kinabalu and hope you do too."
663,You gotta make the summit !!,"What an amazing experience!! My sister, her friend and my boyfriend went up on a 2-day overnight hike, staying at the Laban Rata lodge. We'd read that you get a bit ripped off booking through tour  companies, so we booked accommodation directly through the lodge and then just bought all the mountain passes, tour guide and gear there. My boyfriend and I are of reasonable fitness while my sister and her friend were not very fit. We all made it to the lodge on the first day quite well, admiring the change in landscape from rainforest to more of a NZ type bush!! A really decent feed welcomed us as Laban Rata then it was straight to bed at 6pm - a) because you're exhausted from 4.5 hours walking and b) you're up again at 2am to reach the peak for sunrise!Unfortunately my sister got altitude sickness and couldn't get much past the lodge. Funnily enough, while my boyfriend and I were fitter, the altitude got to us the closer to the top we got and our less fit friend powered to the top as she was less affected. No matter that the last 20 metres took us a solid 20 mins to climb, the sunrise was ah-mazing!! We were above the clouds and above the world!! Climbing down was really hard work, and altitude sickness got us a bit on the way down. I would recommend keeping an extra day up your sleeve in case you do get altitude sickness (we've never climbed high mountains before), and then you can stay the extra night to acclimatise and get to the peak. An absolute must-do in Borneo, the money is worth it!"
664,Uh-mazing!,"We hiked up the mountain as part of our honeymoon and it was my favourite part of our trip.The guides go at your pace so you don't feel pushed at all. Whilst we were one of the first groups to make it to the guesthouse for the night it was still a tough climb as it does feel like you are climbing up hill nearly all the time (this sounds obvious for a mountain but I mean there aren't many flat ridges etc!)Once at the guesthouse the accommodation is quite basic and there isn't much to do apart from admiring the views. The food provided was much better than we were expecting, given that everything has to be carried up!To reach the summit you have to get up at 2am (we tried to go to bed early to get some rest but it was quite noisy) and then you leave at about 3am to start hiking after a small supper. When we hiked there was a thunderstorm so it was simultaneously one of the scariest and best experiences of my life! A lot of groups turned back as the heavy rain made the path way into waterfalls of mud but we kept going. You also get to a point where the path changes to rock and you need to hold on to ropes- so I would advise packing some waterproof gloves with you to protect your hands and stop them getting cold if it is wet. Unfortunately because of the storm we didn't see a sunrise when we got to the summit but we did see forked lightning flashing through the clouds below us which I thought was just as good.Another word of advice- the climb down should not be underestimated. This is where we felt the most pain because the steps are quite steep and we were walking like cowboys for at least 3 days afterwards!!"
665,Once in a lifetime experience!,"Very popular and perhaps amongst the most important reasons to visit Kota Kinabalu. Will definitely recommend that everyone who plans the track, ensure he or she has good fitness levels as trek can be gruelling and the difficulty between completing the trek and not completing is just good the level of fitness."
666,Beautiful view,"Actually I have been here 3 times since I was a teenager. I grow up in a small village near to the National park and my dad is a Mountain Guide for years. Ever since I was a child I always ask him if I can join him one day but the day never came as he is retire and I was move to future my study. Once I reach to Malaysia Radio Station at the middle of the trail when I am 16 years following my mother and I promise one day I will reach the top peak. I studied oversea and once a year I will back hometown and still the majestic of the mountain still never lose it magic. I grown up looking at the mountain and everytime I always mezmerize by its majestic and legends. Every year there is world class marathon organize here but I have never have a time to see it.Last 3 years ago I went climbing with my best friend but still I did not make it to the top as i fell sick.. I just make it to the Laban Rata, the last camp before the climbing the top on the dawn. Its all started of wrong outfit. I didn't use the windbreaker jacket and I got cold and flu for a week.The next year I tried again and this time I prepared my windbreaker and all necessary out fit. There is two trail to reach the top.. Mesilau trail which is longest and Timpohon Trail for the more easy step. I choose Mesilau Trail to get two certificate. The secenery is just amazing. It feels like you are out of the planet.. The flora is just different and so do the cloud formation.. You won't believe your eyes.. The wind is quite hard and it is very cold so you better prepare the right outfit..good trekking shoes, raincoat, wind cap, ear cover and extra gloves and shock will help. The air is quite thin so it is a bit hard to breath. Your stamina also nees to be fit cause it was quite challanging trail. Bring some energy food and drinks also help. But don't overpack or you will end up to exaust to bring all your stuff. Bring light clothes only. All toilteries such us towels, tooth paste, soap and brush teeth was provided at the accomodation. Same goes to the dinner, supper and brakfast.We depart from first gate at 8.30am and reach the Laban Rata accomodation at 6pm. Rainy season may bring extra difficulties for those low stamina. After having dinner we go to bed to get energy as peak climbing will be start before dawn. At 1.30 am all people will have a supper and gatering at the gate. At 2.30 am everyone was slowly start climbing the rock using torch light and follow the rope trail. It is very cold that I cant feel my fingger. Gloves will help to hold tight to the rope. It is still very dark..but it already amaze me..the moon and stars look more brighter.. Even the air is thinner and look look like the way never ends most people are encouraging each other which make me try harder. Before the sun rise we made it to the top and see the sun rise perfectly. We spend a few hour at the top as it is not permitted to stay long up there due to cloudy. When we going down I wondered how did I get up here in the dark when thr trail is actually this way..the journey is totaly worth it.. Its like you are already at the top of the world.. No words can describe the wonders of the sorounding. Majestic and amazing.."
667,Mount kk,But we all conquered it....not for the feint hearted!!An amazing experience though....although you won't be saying that when you get up at 1.30am to climb to the summit!
668,Mount Kinabalu One Day Summit,"After travelling from Kota Kinabalu to the national park we stayed in the lodgings there before heading off first thing in the morning - before sunrise. I recommend an early night at this stage as you WILL need your energy. To get the best out of the journey you should be prepared and have done as much training as you can. The climb is tiring but the views all the way up are fantastic. When you arrive at the 'top' (where we stayed again for one more night) there is a great buffet dinner which we took full advantage of. Food is fantastic. Again, an early night is recommended as we set off before sunrise. The walk in the morning was quite daunting due to the pitch black - so take a torch (preferably a head torch). The walk was exhausting and felt at some times like it was never ending but DO NOT GIVE UP. Reaching the top at sunrise was the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen in my life. As we reached just above the clouds we could see lightning below us, stars above us...then when we reached the top the beautiful sunrise. I can't express how fantastic this experience was for me. The walk down you'll be happy to know is MUCH quicker, though I found it painful on my knees, so take it slow! Go back to the lodgings where you stayed the night before and take advantage of the breakfast there - heavenly. and then as you make your way down pass on messages of luck to those coming up- you'll know how motivating it is once you've done it. ALL THE BEST! :)"
669,“Amazing experience”,"Hiking Mt. Kinabalu had been on our wish list for many years and finally we did it !  We managed to sustain and hike up all the way to Low's Peak and came down still in one piece though totally exhausted.  We also participated in the Via Ferrata activity ""Walk the Torq"" (basic level) - a new experience to us.Overall, the management of the Park was good with designated guides and help for carrying extra luggage.  Available facilities exceeded my expectation - a variety of hot food (meat and vegetables) and drinks for dinner, continuous supply of toasts for breakfast, provision of a number of sheltered huts and toilets along the hike, etc.  We stayed at Pendant Hut for the night, the dormitories were clean and neatly organized to serve the hikers' basic needs, with toilets and bath at the basement.There was only one minor issue which I would like to bring up was that as participants for the ""Walk the Torq"", we had to attend the briefing at 4:00 pm at Pendant Hut but as our Organizer was still on her way up, we were not aware of where the briefing would take place.  It would help us ""not-so-fit and exhausted hikers"" if there was announcement or a notice posted at the entrance to the Canteen to direct us to the briefing location.  Bearing in mind that one had to climb a very, very long flight of stairs in order to reach Pendant Hut, which was really an extremely difficult task for those who just barely managed to reach the Canteen on time."
670,Awesome view and scenery,"Visiting Sabah is not complete without a climbing trip up to the Mt Kinabalu Mountain. As you ascend up to the top, you can see many beauty of nature differ from each level and sunrise from the top is superb!"
671,superb place to be,"We went to Mount Kinabalu to see orchids growing in the wild so did treks rather than climb the mountain.  We did see orchids, nepenthes and other flora and fauna and had a wonderful time. Will be going back for more. Had a brilliant guide who knew his way around."
672,"INCREDIBLE experience, but not for the faint hearted, unfit or those with vertigo.",The views down to the ocean are far reaching on a clear day. The hike up is not strenuous if you are reasonably fit but should not be attempted with nagging whining partner who's is doing it because you want to get there. The rock bowl at the top is spectacular and makes easy walking under firm ground after the tropical ascent earlier. The accommodation halfway is very basic and I recommend some sleep to enjoy the early wake up call and long day ahead. Remember you climb to the top and then all the way down. Book a descent hotel on return you will feel like you earn it. Good luck it is worth all the effort.
673,Mother of all mountains within Malaysia,"I'm reviewing the one-day summit hike only. I hiked Kinabalu in late September, 2013. I was one of only three hikers to attempt the one-day summit hike, though the two-day conventional hike was sold out. The good: It's great exercise! Hiking to the summit and back in one day is challenging. It took me 8 hours of pretty fast hiking (9 hours when you include the two 30-minute breaks I took to eat at Laban Rata). Needless to say, you need to be in pretty good shape or you won't make the cut-off times (and you will hate life). While I hated life for a good chunk of the hike, as a relatively fit, experienced hiker, I would have been disappointed to have to end Day 1 at Laban Rata, which took me just four hours to reach.It's not at all crowded. There were only two other day hikers on the mountain the day I hiked. While you will see the occasional porter on their way up to, or down from, Laban Rata, the experience is pretty much the opposite of what I imagine the 2-day hike to be. You can pack light. No need to carry warm clothing for a nighttime hike. I carried a shell rain jacket, an extra T-shirt, and some thin gloves. It was warm at the top, though I needed to wear all my layers for some of the hike when the wind cooled it down.It's cheaper. After paying for a guide, a pass and transportation, I'd put my total expenses around US$100. The 2-day deal is closer to $300. The bad:It's a long, arduous hike. If you don't exercise regularly, then forget about it. You will basically be climbing stairs for the better part of a day. Also, some people aren't suited to altitude. The other two hikers I met turned back before the last 1.5km when one developed a migraine headache. Though I imagine the same thing would have happened if they'd opted for the two-day hike.No sunrise. I've seen photos of the sunrise view from on top of the mountain and they look spectacular. While I saw some pretty great views on the way up and at the top, the sunrise would have been better. Overall, I'm glad I opted for the one-day hike as I didn't have much money and the two-day hike is significantly more expensive. Both options have their merits, though for most people the two-day hike is a no-brainer and worth the added cost. **Whichever hike you decide to do, take my advice and ensure that you have enough water to reach the top after leaving Laban Rata. The final water station ran out of water as my guide was filling his bottle, and we then had to share a meagre amount of water between us on the part of the hike when we needed it most. Given his lack of a reaction when the pipe ran empty, my guess is that this happens frequently. For those attempting the one-day hike, I would advise that you carry a second water bottle with you, leaving it empty until you reach Laban Rata and then filling it there rather than relying on the unreliable last water station."
674,Fantastic Adventure!!!!!!!,"We skipped the overpriced tours (190 ringgit!) and got a share taxi for 20 ringgit per person instead; approx 2 hour drive up the mountain, scenic drive but be wary of fast overtaking cars (inevitable in Malaysia). Did a short 60-80 min trail, pleasant though slippery due to recent rains - wear proper shoes and be wary of leeches; pretty botanical garden though small; finding taxi back was a bit more tricky got one for 120 ringgit and he careened down the slopes so brace yourselves! overall very pleasant though not much to do if you are not a serious hiker"
675,Amazing from a distance,"We had the 2 night package - the first night in Grace Lodge and the second at Laban Rata with the final climb to the summit at 4am on the morning of Saturday 22 December.  It rained for most of our ascent to Laban Rata but cleared up for the last, long kilometre.  Our guide pointed out to us a couple of maroon Langur's monkeys in the trees.  The air's a little thinner after 2700 metres and the last km of track probably took us an hour.  We got some great sunset photos from LR after the first day's climb.  After a false start at 2:40am in the pouring rain, we actually walked through the gate when it was opened at 3:45am.  The granite was slippery and the gardening gloves were perfect for the wet rope.  It was not an easy ascent and many people turned back but our guide, Primus, was brilliant.  As dawn approached, the last triangle of granite took about fifteen minutes and, as the rain started again, all I managed were a few photos of Primus and me at Low's Peak (4095.2m); sunrise happened somewhere behind the clouds.  We left the summit at 6:25am  We descended quickly in the driving rain and reached LR again at 7:45am.  From there, the descent to the park HQ was in torrential rain along what was quickly becoming a river bed.  We eventually made it back by 1pm in time for the 2pm bus to Sepilok (on an air conditioned bus in completely wet clothes!).  I could barely walk for the next two days, especially not downstairs.It was a great experience and although I can't say I enjoyed it as I was doing it, I really felt a sense of accomplishment.  I'm three months short of fifty years old - if I can do it, anyone younger than me can!!"
676,Fantastic experience,"I've done a few climbs and walks, and would consider the whole family as being relatively fit. This climb has some special considerations you'll need to be aware of, it is quite a bit more difficult than it sounds. You have a choice of different routes (Timpohon Gate start and Mesilau), and you pretty much go up and down the same way. Timpohon much shorter. The ground for most of the way up and back is very uneven and relatively rocky in parts with heaps of stairs. The stairs only become a problem after a while when you are a bit tired and the unevenness of the rise/fall starts to become annoying. Going up and back in a couple of days is about right, but the second day is about 2Km to the top for sunrise then about 8Km back down. The down part is the issue. You are a little tired after starting at 0200, and by the time you get a fair way into the decent, those unneven drops become relatively painful. My daughter and I were the only ones to do the climb, and we were pretty sore by the end (not to mention knackered). Our guide Veronica was a million bucks, if you can sign her up, you will have a far better experience, she jumped off track to take photos, took slightly different, more even routes (in the dark) once we were on the way, and gave my daughter hand pretty much all the way down - she is a must if you have a family. We did Machu Picchu (Inca Trail) a few years ago and that was a pure delight compared to the up and down here, for only a reasonable sunrise and view. The altitude wasn't a problem, but you do need lots of water - its pretty hot until you get to about the 3Km level. Good luck if you're attempting the climb, be prepared for all types of weather and physical conditions. I think this confirms for me that I need something to look at and a little variety in the path, rather than the straight up and down."
677,National Park and Poring Hot Springs Tour,"we booked this amazing trip with amazing borneo in early March. and fortunately there were some permits available for the april end hike.(Do book your hike as early as possible, there are limited daily hiking permits which run out pretty soon!) and better go during the dry season！ before the trip we had some regular training back in Hong Kong to help us get fit enough for this hike. Needless to say, the view on the top is stunning and mesmerizing, we made it in time to watch the sunrise and soak in the sunshine! (Tips: wear waterproof windbreaker, glvoes and shoes with good gripping for the overnight summit hike)however after the earthquake in May 2015, i guess no one would be able to see the donkey ears as they used to be. The highlight of the whole hike is the via ferrata adventure. eye-popping scene of the mountains and the clouds.. <The route’s thread-like tightrope walks and swinging planks will have you convinced that the course designers are sadistic, but that’s what makes it so darn fun – testing your limits without putting your safety in jeopardy. … >the earthquake struck a week after our trip, unfortunately our mountain guide, Robbie could not escape the death..he was killed by a rock dislodged in the quake..We were so devastated by the news and could hardly believe what had happened..  Without his help and care, we would not be able to enjoy and conquer mt KK so wonderfully. We raised about 200USD$ for his family online and we hope his soul rest in peace in heaven."
678,Majestic Mt KK,"this is the highest mountain that I have climbed and the entire experience was wonderful.  there is so much to see, with views changing every 20-30 minutes as you climb. The top of the mountain is one massive rock and the views are awesome. It is cold at the top and the…"
679,Scary Beast of a mountain!,Nice trek. Easy access. Good restaurants and food. Safe even for self hikes. Proper markings and directions.good memories to bring back.
680,"Amazing journey, stamina is a must!","Before I climbed Mount Kinabalu I had a look on this website and was terrified that I wouldn't be fit enough to complete the climb.  Now that I have successfully completed it I can say that yes, it's tough, but so long as you practice some kind of sport regularly and have a reasonable level of fitness then I don't see any reason why someone couldn't complete this challenge.Prior to the climb I hit the gym about once or twice a week, and sometimes didn't go at all.  Yes, if I was super-fit it would have made the climb a little easier but I really belive that the main thing you need to build up is stamina - it's not like running a marathon, you can walk really slowly and take lots of rests but you need to have the stamina to keep going - that and preferably a decent guide (as mine had to practically drag me up the summit at the end! ;) )To summarize the climb, I found the first day hard but totally doable.  I even started to wonder what all the fuss was about - why people on this website said it was so hard?  Most of the first day was spent climbing up stairs but there will still some flat parts too and shelters every 500m with benches and toilets so it's really well done for tourists.  On the second day however I soon realised why people say the climb is so tough! Setting out at 2am, you first climb up loads of steep steps followed by a steep rock face which you climb but hauling yourself up with a rope! Once you start this part there's no turning back as you'll have queues of people behind you...so you really need to have some upper body strength as it's pretty tiring! After that part it's a steep long slog to the top.  When we went it wasn't too cold outside but I can imagine that at some times of the year it must be freezing.  The sunset at the top was spectacular and well worth the effort.  Once we'd reached the summit we then had to climb back down to Laban Rata..this was tough on my knees so I was glad I used walking sticks or I don't know how I'd have done it! Once we got back to the restaurant we were completely exhausted and the last thing we felt like doing was walking another 6km back downhill! The last 3 km of the climb seemed to last forever and we no longer cared about the beautiful scenery or the great experience of walking in nature...we just wanted to go home to bed!I literally couldn't walk for 2 days afterwards but can honestly say that the sense of achievement and the beautiful photos we got out of it made it all worth it!  It's tough but anyone of reasonable fitness can do it in my opinion.  However it did make me think twice about signing up for kilimanjaro which is another challenge on my bucket list...as I sat freezing my a** off at the summit I did think to myself ""doing this at -20°c would really not be fun!"" ;-)"
681,Breathtaking Experience!,"First the good: The 5/5 rating is for the mountain. This mountain was the reason I came to Borneo, and it didn't disappoint. It was a 2 day, 1 night trek, commencing at 2.30am on the second day to make it to the top just in time for sunrise. And the view at the top was incredible. You could see the sea and Kota Kinabalu like they were in the same city, not 70 miles away.   Now the ugly: A permit is required to climb the mountain and a mountain guide. Sutera Sanctuary Lodge hold the monopoly on these permits and also on accommodation. The company are nothing short of a disgrace in terms of ripping you off, but it was one of the neccessary evils I had to swallow my pride for. I believe I got one of the best deals out there, and it still cost about 130 British Pounds."
682,Worth the pain,"I can now see why your company is called Amazing Borneo, after 3 trips to New Zealand this has got to be up with my best trip ever I have just completed the 3d/2n mount kinabalu track. I have to say it was excellent from the booking experience and patience of nastashyia helping me get the right package, though to the hotel pickup... On time by David and a clean and quiet minibus. Day 1The booked lodge was grace hostel, a really nice place with really good beds,only issue was that the lodge is a quiet place and could do with some books, board games or radio/tv in the common room to keep guests entertained Day 2 started with a trip to registration and everything was organised very quickly, the introduction to my excellent guide and mentor for the climb Julias, he spoke excellent English, had a great sense of humour and kept me going for the duration of the next 2 days. The climb was challenging but very enjoyable and after numerous stops enroute we reached Laban Rata and my guide Julias got me a room in a nearer hostel to save me a further 500m trip what a great guy he is. Day 3The next morning up at 0100 breakfast was great and set off at 0230 for the summit, a really tough accent at that time of the morning made the summit just after 0545 for the sunrise, but a,little cloudy,  It was a fantastic experience and cannot believe my guide has done this thousands of time, his record is up and down in 4 hours WOW, mine was about 12 hours ++ It was amazing to see all the porters coming up the mountain carrying upto 40 kg on their backs and you really appreciate the effort that goes in to providing you your meals, everything is carried up and down by hand... At the end of the treck zul from Amazing Borneo was there to drive us back for afternoon tea and then straight back to the hotel in KK, where I must say I was exhausted but really pleased with my Borneo experience. I would highly recommend this trip for anyone of all ages (I am mid 50,s) but here's my top 7 tips to make it more enjoyable, take the time to do it in 3 days, unless your really FIT and have trained for it. 1 book with amazing Borneo2 make sure you have 2 walking poles.. there are heaven sent..3 make sure you get your guide to carry your pack, best 100 rm you'll ever spend ... Trust me4 wear good strong walking boots some did it in flip flops...mmmnn5 take 2 ponchos as it will rain several times and they rip so easy6 take some cheap slippers/ flip flops for the rest times 7 take nothing but photos and snacks and leave nothing but footprints and memories It took me 2/3 days to recover with really tight thigh muscles... ohhh the pain and the next day i was a trip on the north Borneo railway, another great trip that amazing Borneo do... This was an great way to let the train take the strain.. All in all I would give the trip 11/10"
683,one of the most beautiful walk i've done,"my husband and i went out for a look before committing to even a day climb. they say you dont need to be fit. well i totally disagree with that. we took the Ranua mini bus cost 20 myr each one way. trip took 2 hours, at the entrance to the park you have a 10 myr park fee each. the man in the ticket box couldn't speak english, the map is basic and extremely hard to follow. limited signs which makes getting around difficult. we missed the botanical gardens the first time round. when we did find it (entrance behind the two big buildings together about 15/20 min from the park entrance wasn't worth it all. only saw a handfull of orchids, even though i had prepared our trip for all weather conditions i was more worried about the bus trip down the mountain. we did however have a break in the clouds and for the first time in sabah i finally saw Mt.Kinabalu. breath takingly beautiful, it was short lived and the clouds rolled in. we decided to leave early and get to KK before the skies opened up. make sure you take plenty of water sun screen hat and warm clothing you can feel the temperature change half way there it dropped approx 10 deg and may have dropped further when the rain hit. we got some beautiful shots and we didn't have to venture too far into the park. well worth just heading out there for a couple of hours to decide whether the climb is really for you"
684,Good Trip,"OK so to begin with, it's worth me saying I booked my trip with Amazing Borneo and they were just that - amazing! I booked the 3 day/2 night package and stayed at the park the night before the hike which was amazing because I got upgraded from a hostel dorm to a private suite - yay!On the day of the climb, Julie met me at the lodge and introduced me to my guide Roni and we jumped into a minibus and headed off to Timpohon Gate. This is the start of your trek and there's a lodge where they check you in with your pass.Now, I've run half marathons and this trek was only 8.7km so I naively thought I would find this a breeze...ha ha ha.There are around 5 stops along the route where you can take a water break and have a sit down on some benches. With Amazing Borneo you get all your food included so we stopped at 4km to have our packed lunch.At 6km you reach your accommodation for the night and it's essentially a hostel. As a guide it took me 4 hours to reach this point and there's a large communal area where you have dinner and can just generally chill out with the other people trekking. I shared a dorm with 3 other people and it was nice to get to know other people sharing this experience! At 3am we set off to reach the summit which took me roughly 2 hours and it wasn't that windy so after having photos at the top we went down to 8km and watched the sunrise from the top which was amazing. I have to say after setting off in the dark where you can just see the light from your headtorch, the whole mountain comes alive in the sunlight and you get to see the rainforest on one side, the mountain on another and KK in the distance! I got back to the the lodge at 7.45am and had breakfast before setting off back down the mountain at 9am. It's so much harder going down so I would recommend hiring a walking stick for around 10MR to help you. It took me just as long to go down as it did to go up! It was really hard on my knees so was glad to have the stick to help me.My tips would be to take spare clothes as even if it doesn't rain, the water from the mist makes your clothes damp and damp mixed with sweat makes you smell sooo bad! I would also recommend taking ibuprofen/painkillers with you as the altitude can give you headaches. Amazing experience though and so glad I've done it!"
685,Toughest challenge of the trip!,"It was simply a fantastic experience. Although I was travelling on my own, you build up a real sense of camaraderie with the other climbers which you will absolutely take away with you. Although billed as a climb requiring no specific skills, it's no walk in the park and you need to be reasonably fit. Try to go during the dry season, it rained a little over night when I was there and that made the trek down much more difficult (going down us harder than up by the way!). I urge you to read the advice in advance and make sure you take everything that the tour companies suggest! It might be 30'c in KK but trust me at 2.30am when your pulling yourself up to the summit, you'll be grateful for the thermals and the head torch!! Getting to the summit on day 2 was amazing. Stunning views and a real sense of achievement. If you feel like giving up -don't ! It will be worth it when you make it to the top!!"
686,The pain!!!!!,Beautiful God's creation. Make sure you wake up early in Kundasang to watch its stunning view. You can view this mountain anywhere in Kundasang but after 10 a.m the wheather start to be cloudy and towards late evening its always raining in Kundasang. Make sure you have the stamina to if plan to hike the mountain. There are also few easy track for hiking in Kinabalu Park.
687,Challenging but worth the visit,I trained for months prior to my climb but nothing can really prepare you for what lies ahead. A difficult terrain and the effects of high altitude will start getting to you at about the 3km mark but it is all worth it in the end. Just pace yourself; it's not a race. Some may think that going down will be easier but you will feel it in your legs for a few days after. My best advice is to dress in layers and remove as required. It can be quite chilly for the overnight climb at 2.30am so make sure you have proper clothing. A must do if you are looking for a physical and mental challenge.
688,Couldn't describe more when reached the top!,"This famous mountain, with its 4095m Low’s peak as the highest in SE Asia, had been on my bucket list for decades. I am glad that I finally made it. The national park offers excellent lodgings and food at around the entrance and at the mid-point (~6km), where almost all stay for one night before the summit attempt early next morning. After reaching around the 8km mark, a beautiful sloped plateau opens up with the famous peaks (Low’s, South, St. John’s, etc) lying around. The final ascent to the Low’s peak is pleasant, yet maybe crowded though. The view on top is excellent and unique —comparable to the Rockies, Kilimanjaro, Elbrus, etc , and next only to the Himalayas,  in my humble opinion. Beware that the descent to trail head (from 4095m to about 1800m in 8.7km) is quite punishing — mostly because of the countless steps instead of sloped trails. Almost all of us (many are experienced hikers) had some degrees of sore thighs, knees, and/or ankles the next day. I actually don’t remember anything like this for say the last two dozens of >3000m peaks I climbed ... honestly! Not sure what exercise one can do to alleviate the pain either... maybe a little better mental preparation is of some help..."
689,Awesome mountain with beautiful nature...,"Myself and my friend climbed Kinabalu on the 2D1N package. To be honest I had no idea what was in store, apart from meeting a few people a week or so previous who said they ached, a lot! I wouldn't consider myself an unfit person but this mountain really did make me feel so. The relentless steps and heat made it very difficult. If it wasn't for my friend I wouldn't have made it. There were rest stops every 1-1/2 KM which offered basic toilet facilities and untreated water. we git boiled water from our guide at the 4KM mar, it was yellow but it was much needed and never made us ill at all. The accommodation at Laban Rata is fine and the food is lovely. Amazing for how far up it is. We delayed our early morning start on day 2 due to bad weather, eventually getting going about 3.30am. We were about 1/2 hour from the top at sunrise which was amazing. When I turned and looked around behind us once it was light I could not believe I made it all that way. Coming down was difficult as it had been raining and the granite was very slippery. We had some very comedy moments during our descent, including falling over, getting jumped on by the local squirrels and telling people on the way up that they 'were nearly there!' All in all this trip was fantastic (even though I would not have said that when I was doing it), I am so pleased I have conquered Kinabalu as it was a highlight of 2012 for me. If you are thinking of doing it just DO IT!!! You will never forget it. It is hard but definitely 100% worth it! We did your trip through Dive Downbelow, Alice was the contact who arranged it. The guide named Sepilus, was fantastic, a very friendly, gentle and encouraging chap who was kept us going. PS I could barely walk for 6 days afterwards, so be warned - you WILL ache for a good few days!!!"
690,Amazing hike up & down Mount Kinabalu,"Stunningly beautiful climb - really worth doing. The ascent to the summit in the early hours of the morning is particularly incredible - traversing the rockface under the stars - and the sunrise and views are beautiful.It's hard work, but perfectly achievable for anyone of average fitness.Needs to be booked a long way in long way in advance, however, due to the shortage of places at the Mountain Lodge. For the cheapest prices, book direct with Sutera Sanctuary Lodges, rather than through a tour company."
691,Pure mountain climbing,"Unfortunately i wasn't able to climb due to the recent earthquake, but still manage to enjoy the scenery and surrounding area around Kinabalu Park and Kundasang. Overnight at one of the resort in Kundasang, and i truly enjoyed the nice cooling weather and quiet peacefulness."
692,Absolutely amazing and beautiful,"Beautiful national park, well marked trails and facilities. A birder's paradise, recommend Liwagu trail and hiking down from Timpson gate if short on time."
693,Climbing Mount Kinabalu in 1 Day,"My wife and I have just attempted the Mt Kinabalu climb with the Amazing Borneo Tour. I think this company really lives up to its reputation of being “AMAZING”. We received VIP treatment throughout and it was way above our expectation. Given our age (60+) they specially assigned a strong guide (Shafik ?) to us. He is strong yet courteous, patient and always pointing to us the hazards in front of us. He carried our belongings and followed us throughout the journey at our pace. We will strongly recommend all our friends to choose Amazing Borneo Tours for the Mt Kinabalu Climb and we shall try out some other KK nature packages offered by this company."
694,The unforgetful climbing experiance,"Read this long review only when you want to know how it is when you have bad weather conditions! We were picked up from the hotel and climbed all the stairs up to Laban Rata. We started at 9 and arrived there at 1pm. It was sunny and we could sit outside relaxing. We took a shower (cold) in the dorm resthouse and went to the main building where they served dinner buffet. Being fast is not a good idea because we had to wait quite long for the dinner and up is not much to do. After dinner we went to bed. Mattresses were completely used and it was very cold. We rented a sleeping bag because there were just thin blankets, not warm enough. All people slept with their entire clothes. Despite ear plugs I could hear people talking very loud and not respecting sleep hours. We woke up very early. Unfortunately it was raining. We almost arrived the peak but had to return because the stream of the water became stronger and we were completely wet. We did not see anything. Strong wind and wet clothes made the highlight to a nightmare. All people had to return. We were about 100 people at the ropes climbing down at the rocks and always had to wait for slowly climbing people. Freezing was the next horrible thing. We could not warm up because it was cold everywhere, there is no heating. The only warm place was the kitchen. We were still freezing after breakfast that's why we decided to leave fast and climbing all the stairs down. There was only one enjoyable moment. The sun soaking moment after arriving. I envy all people who had good weather and could enjoy the view from the top."
695,Great Climb,"Firstly, I'm not going to lie, its a slog.Day 1 is a relentless uphill climb for about six hours to get to the hut. Day 2 involves another 2+hr climb to the top (in the dark). I'm used to walking and pretty fit. If you are not you will probably struggle.Secondly, altitude sickness is possible. 2 of my group didn't climb above the overnight hut. As its forest all the way to this point, you basically see very little views if you end up stopping at this point.Thirdly, there is the permit hassle. BUT...great walk. Superb views. Not, however, quite as good as Mount Rinjani on Lombok, Indonesia."
696,Extreme One Day Climb,"It is one of the easier, yet highest climbs in the SEA region. This factor alone makes it super popular amongst climbers from across the world. I went in March and it wasn't very cold at the summit, just chilly thanks to the wind chill factor.It's best to do the climb through an agency as they will arrange your transport, accommodation and a guide. The guide in our case turned out to be a kid who wouldn't give a s**t about anything and barely followed us around like a mute observer. Apart from that, no complaints.You don't need to be super fit to do the climb. What you must do for sure is to take the Via Ferrata on the way down. Descending vertical faces tied to a harness definitely challenges your fear of heights (if you have any)."
697,Climbing Mount Kinabalu,"Mt. Kinabalu is not for the slackers; this mammoth requires lots of mental & physical endurance. If that's not how you describe yourself not to worry, you can visit the tourist center and get to know this gem in Borneo. Stay and discover the culture of the near by town & enjoy Mt. Kinabalu whether you climb or not."
698,1 day non-summit walk,"gave a true glance of what Borneo has to offer. Natural plants, wildlife . Fantastic views. Food markets. Plants and flowers. Time to seeKinablu moutain and trek if you want"
699,Love it!,"Well, if you don't train for this Trek you will find it very tough (as I did).......Being a light jogger I presumed it would be enough training, but I was wrong. Anyone contemplating this Climb, please do some stair training for at least 4-6 weeks prior. (I only did the stair training 2x)But what a fantastic view and experience at the top of this 4,095M mountain....mind you there are many who do not reach the peak, due to the cold, altitude or muscle fatigue (fitness). But I was one of the lucky ones to experience the top just after sunrise, where the temp was around 0...... so please take warm clothing, gloves, beany, scarf etc.....Highly recommend to any of you who like to trek or who are up to a challenge of the mind and body!It is a 3 day 2 night tour, with all meals included, however we found that those extra Tim Tam biscuits and chocolate bars we brought along were life savers for the energy factor along the way......Total climbing time for me was 10 hrs up and 5 hrs down....mind you my FIT friend did it in 6 hrs up and 3hrs down......Going down is probably more difficult than going up for some.Get fit and book your Climb.....you wont regret it!"
700,A great experience,"I found Judith at Amazing Borneo Tours very helpful in organizing my visit to Sabah, including a ride on the old steam train to Papar, the climb of Mt Kinabalu and a three-day trip to Sandakan to visit Turtle Islands Park, the Orang Utan Rehabilitation Centre and the Kinabatangan River. Between excursions the Klagan Hotel was an excellent choice with quality accommodation in the city centre. For Kinabalu, Masnani Paiman was a superb guide. She was patient with this slow 80-year-old climber determined to reach the summit. The wonderful rock above the trees is worth the effort to get there. Since now I am almost as slow descending as going up, we arrived at the Timpohon Gate half an hour after the 6 p.m. deadline. However, Siti Maslia and Hilary Mimis of Amazing Borneo met us and drove us to the Park entrance. There Siti arranged supper at a restaurant and Hilary drove me back to Kota Kinabalu.These extra services were very welcome and beyond anything I had expected from my contract with Amazing Borneo.Don MortonVictoria, BC, Canada"
701,Excellent Track but OMG... its not so easy,"7 of us, youngest being 9 years old and oldest 50 years old arrived at kinabalu HQ on 30 Nov 2015. We stayed at Sutera Harbour Lodge for 1 night. Beautiful rooms with 4-5 star facilities. View of the mountain was spectacular. Buffet dinner was above average.We started the hike from Timpohon to Laban Rata (LR) the next day with 3 guides who were also our porters. The hike was pleasant, weather was nice and cooling, and sceneries after km5 were amazing. Facilities and cleanliness along the path was well maintained. We reached Laban Rata after 5 hours.Lunch & dinner at LR were above our expectations. They have hot showers too. We have 1 dorm with 8 comfortable bunk beds to ourselves. We started climbing towards the peak at 2.30am via the new ranau trail. We climbed up many steep wooden stairs built into the rock face of the mountain but it was manageable. Certain area requires us to pull ourselves up with the ropes provided. Path was clearly marked by the new white ropes. We reached the peak at 6.15am with a lot of help from our guide as the last bit of the climb was extremely rocky & steep. The area at the peak was narrow thus only 5 climbers were allowed at anytime. The descent was more difficult and am glad that our guides were there to assist. Without them, the hike would not be so pleasant & smooth. Many thanks to Ramin@Mayor Bigul, Frederick Alim & Christopher for keeping us safe!"
702,"Exhausting, but Worth It.",A real challenge especially as you get closer to climbing and seeing just how big it is
703,Hard work but worth it!,"The climb will test you physically and mentally, but if you make it to the top you will be rewarded with an incredible view.  The climb is mostly stairs and rocky terrain with a section of ropes near the summit that you may need to use to go up or down.  The views of the stars during the pre-dawn ascent are great.  I highly recommend doing this climb if you are in Sabah."
704,"A must see place of ""Great Importance""","First let me say ""WOW""!!! Taking on the challenge of climbing Mt. Kinabalu was the most physically demanding task I have ever done. This Is coming from a person who played sports all of his life. I am 50 years old. I am in very good shape. However, there was nothing I could do to prepare myself for this challenge. I live in Houston, Tx. The topography of Houston is very flat. So my training consisted only of cardio and weight training. Well, my training worked. It was an extremely hard trek, but my training and God helped me to finish. It's well worth it because the views from the peak are breathe taking. I had opted to do the Via  Ferrata activity. It's an activity that requires you to use harness to cross 3 bridges, a wire walk and a climb down the face of Mt. kinabalu. It was well worth the time, money and effort!! The other climbs from all over the world. I met a ton of great people. My guide up and down the mountain was very helpful and encouraging. Climbing Mt. Kinabalu is a bucket list item. Check it off!!!"
705,Painstakingly Heaven,"It's normally a 2d/1n hike, but the prices are ridiculous, so me and 2 guys decided to do it in one day. Shouldn't be too hard right? Wrong!!! It was by far the toughest hike I've ever done and I've climbed mountain a lot higher than this. The first stretch to Laban Rata is hard, but manageable. The only problem is you have to be there before 2 or they won't let you climb to the summit. The summit didn't take too long, but i still had to stop every few metres to catch my breath because of the altitude. Going down was what killed me. The path is not exactly smooth and by the time I made it to the summit I was already pretty tired and my legs were slightly wobbly. But halfway down they turned to jelly. It took ages to get down, but eventually I made it.It was a great experience and the summit was definitely worth the effort. But unless your super fit, don't do it in one day. I'll be much more enjoyable with a bit of time to spare to take photos and have a rest. Hardest, most challenging and most memorable hike I've ever done."
706,Great trip,I went there because I wanted to see what kind of animals i will find at night and day during my stay. This place is amazing for birders and froggers
707,Amazing climb to the summit,"Probably one of the hardest things i've ever done. Relentless, steep and challenging but extremely rewarding. Reaching the top just in time for the most amazing sunrise made all the pain, cold showers and expensive warm beers totally worthwhile!"
708,Nice day trip,"This was my 60th birthday present to myself and it was the best present ever!  I did the 3D2N tour with Amazing Borneo and it was amazing.  The track is very good, relentlessly uphill, hard work (especially at 2.30am) but truly magnificent.  The views are awesome and it was stunning to find yourself above the clouds.  My guide was a gem, encouraging and helpful.  Couldn't be happier with the whole experience."
709,Breathtaking,"limbing Mt Kinabalu (4095.2 M) is challenging if you are only moderately fit. I did the two-days climb with my colleagues of 30 people and found it rewarding.We started our eight-kilometer climb from Timpohon gate at about 09:45 am (1890m). The first 4 km of the trail was quite reasonable, compared to the second half of the climb, which was more challenging. There was plenty of climbing but most of it was up regular sets of wooden or stone stairs built into the trail. We walked slowly to conserve our energy. We stopped for our lunch break (sandwich) at Layang-Layang Hut (4km). The climb after Layang-Layang was far more strenuous and tiring. The altitude was also starting to affect us. Our group arrived at the Laban Rata huts (3273 M) at 02:45pm (took 5 hours to reach) and had our buffet dinner from 4-7pm. We stayed at the Gunting Lagadan Hut. It is another short walk from Laban Rata rest house. It is a typical backpacker style dormitory without heating or hot water for bath. Most of the people I spoke to showered in the freezing cold water. We also had no issue with being cold at night. Each bed had a thick quilt and most of us wore thick socks and clothes to help with the cold at night. We got up at 01:30 am; had a light supper and were on our way to make the final climb to the summit at about 2.30am. The climb up to the summit was slow as everyone had to leave together. Moreover, there were times when we were required to climb up steep slopes with the aid of ropes. We arrived at the summit at 06:30am, which was perfect for us to see the sunrise. At sunrise, the views from the Mt Kinabalu's summit at Low's Peak are spectacular, making all the effort worthwhile. I would suggest bringing gloves, headlights, waterproof jacket, long pants and snacks as it was very important for the climb to the summit. Once the sun has come up its time to head back down the mountain. This is when you get the best views as it is no longer dark and you get the views of the sun coming up. It is also the hardest bit. Climbing down the uneven path will make your muscles ache and I was glad to get to the bottom. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a challenge and a bit of an adventure."
710,4100 m,"The climb to Laban Rata is 6 kilometers or around 10,000 feet in elevation. We started at around 9:30am and reached the lodge in Laban Rata at 4pm. Climbers will have to stay at the lodge to rest, and the climb to the summit will start at around 3AM the next day. From Laban Rata, climbers will negotiate the steep 2.7 kilometers to reach the summit."
711,VIP Treatment,"I just got back from Mt Kinabalu and I can recommend it for anyone interested in a bit of hike in the mountains. Just be warned the national park really makes money with this, so expect to pay a lot. I travelled solo and didn't know anyone to hook up with to share a guide, so I ended up hiring one alone. I did try to ask at the visitor centre if there were other groups leaving about the same time that I could join and they said no. Well, later in the day, upon arriving to my hut room, it turned out there were three people there, also traveling alone, who would have loved to share a guide. So the NP could definitely improve their guide hiring procedures.Anyway, the hike up is strenuous, but if you have done high altitude mountaineering before, just an easy walk. During the trip, I saw a lot of people in their sneakers or Converses or whatever, and they really seemed to be in pain when returning down (the walk down gets to you knees unless you're used to trail running or hiking), so really, bring good shoes! It's not your usual walk in the park + it might rain, and when it rains, it really soaks everything and things get slippery."
712,Experience worth it,"This is one of the world's epic hikes - there is a max of 135 persons a day, so there is plenty of space. Day 1 is grueling; day 2 is wonderful on the rock dome and for sunrise. Hiked with my 12 year old daughter."
713,Challenging and fulfilling,"Traffic can be quite chaotic and rush periods mean a slow crawl, so if you book trips, facto this in as you will not end up returning at the hotel till much later than scheduled."
714,No more wooden sticks!!,"Recommended hot spring, many individual pools and no need to share with other visitors. Silver necklace become gold necklace :D... (for a short period only)But bathroom water is very cold :pRecommended local driver +60146785719 Steven."
715,Realxing Trip,Spectacular walk.  You want to have a reasonable level of fitness though and have comfortable shoes and a spare change of socks for when it rains
716,Challenging!,"I absolutely loved the entire process of booking my climb and executing it with Amazing Borneo. Right from the start, the staff have been very very helpful and efficient. The entire process was without flaw and I faced no inconvenience whatsoever. Everything went as per schedule and I was very satisfied. Special mention for my guide, Ronnie. He was the best. His communication, motivation, interpersonal skills, they were all very impressive. I could not have asked for a better guide. He made my climb to the summit and back down easy and enjoyable. Kinabalu has been a life changing experience for me and has made me realise that nothing is impossible. I will highly recommend your company to all prospective climbers. Well done! Thank you.I hope i get the opportunity to use your company again in the future."
717,great,"If this is your first ever mountain climbing trip, and people told you that it will be a friendly climb, do take it as a pinch of salt as it will be totally different from what you hear.However, it is TOTALLY worth it! TOTALLY! Ascending Mount Kinabalu marks my first mountain climbing in my entire life. A handful of my friends told me that it is a friendly climb and not that bad compared to other mountain.If this is your first climb, do take note that:- Bring at least 1500 millilitres of water if you are perspire a lot.- Bring some energy salt and some candies.- I wore a running shoe for this climb and I regretted it. Get a proper climbing shoe as the rocks can be slippery while descending. I nearly twisted my ankle twice.- A good climbing bag is important as it will distribute the load it in well. - Have a rain coat in your bag at all times.- If you have doubt with your abilities, hire a porter.- Walking stick is a MUST for first-time climbers.- The summit is cold, bring a few heat packs to warm yourself. - Camera, best if it is with panoramic function. You will need it when you reach the summit!  =) I myself did not make it to the summit due to altitude sickness. I have problem gasping for air and having a slight migraine when I am at the 2,500 meter mark and I stop at the 3,668 meters. However my friends are able to make it up and the pictures taken at the summit is are astonishing! Do hydrate well (this is important), eat well and rest well at the Laban Rata (base camp). Lastly, patience, and steady pace will get you to the top eventually! Good luck! =D"
718,Long day Travelling,"We started this one from Kota Kinabalu where we were staying. Sadly, in 2015 there was an earthquake in the mountain area, so the trail to the top was closed and/or booked out for months. I believe they introduced a six month outage after the earthquake, which is why it is getting a bit harder to book a tour up the mountain. Not to worry, the Kinabalu mountain site is fantastic and beautiful nontheless. There are multiple ways to get there from Kota. You can take a bus, or a different bus, or a mini Van, book a tour or even hire a cab to drive you up there. We opted for the self drive option. Renting a car is extremely cheap and we enjoy the freedom of being on our own, having no schedule to keep and being able to go where ever we want to go. We rented our car from close to our house, retrieved it within 20 minutes, and started going. If you opt in for the self-drive option, don't believe the rumours that I found on the internet, with regards to the road being crappy and mostly gravel, the way is hard to find and so on - all rubbish. Here's what you need to know:* There is in deed no gas station in the 30-40 km to the mountain. However, you are in a car. That thing drives 500-600 km without having to gas up. So don't worry, you will make it down.* The streets are just fine. I have been driving on way way worse before. They are all paved up to the very entrance to the trail leading up the mountain. So no worries, it'll be fine! * It is not hard to find. In fact, you barely have to take a turn going to Kinabalu. But if you are worried, rent a GPS. If you are worried and smart and have time and reading this article: take your phone and download Maps.me. This is an open source offline mapping solution, that is completely free. You can then download the map of Malaysia with full routing and this will bring you anywhere you want to go. So thanks to Pip, our lovely Airbnb host, we decided to drive ourselves. Small tip: If you don't know what to do, ask a local. Airbnb is great for that. Pip basically helped us organise everything we wanted to do in Kota, without having to ever book a tour with any of the offices around.  The drive takes around 1-2 hours, depending on traffic. Going up the mountains, the trucks may slow your voyage since they are having a hard time climbing the mountains. That is actually a good thing, because it gives you - as the driver - time to look at the spectacular surroundings. The entrance to Mount Kinabalu national park is hard to miss. There are numerous signs,  and once you get close to the entrance, you'll notice all the Jeeps going that way, loaded with tourists. Just follow them, you won't loose it. The GPS - just by the way - brought us there as well without a hiccup.The mountain is beautiful. We firstly drove all the way up, where there's a viewing platform (and another one half way) with a magnificent view of Mount Kinabalu. We then drove back down to the resort/restaurant, where we walked in and got handed a trail-mapof the surrounding jungle. We did to walks, one river walk (you can barely see a river), and the mountain view trail (barely a view either - there is a lot of jungle). We had a great time trekking, and once again (in case you read my review about trekking in Penang): Totally doable in Flip Flops! even after rainfall. In fact, the easy ability of washing your feet when you don't wear shoes, left me as the only person not being covered in mud at the end of it :) (Disclaimer: While I do not bring shoes to anything - for whatever reason - I do recommend bringing shoes with you)"
719,Loved it! Was easier than I expected too!,"This park is one of the world heritage. The park is quite big. You can go to this place by mini bus from kinabalu town. In jalan padang, after atkinson clock tower, around 500m away there's a minibus stop. Take the minibus to ranau and ask the driver to drop you in the park.The schedule of the minibus is one hour at the time, takes around 2 hours to get there, maximum 15 person at a time. And the minibus stop in some point to toilet break. Don't forget to ask the driver to pick you up around time you want to go back to the city.Big sign of this park is in front of the park. You can buy the ticket for 15myr (foreigner) and you can take the map in the office in the back of souvenir shop.If you like to full explore of the park can take days, but if you only have limited time, you can explore the short rute.Along the way you can see a lot of big trees. The air is so fresh. Don't forget to bring water with you. And snack to fill your energy."
720,Worth the pain for the amazing sun rise lit views,"I highly recommend giving this mountain a go.The view from the top is breathtaking and gives you a feeling that you are in heaven :)The first part of the climb is pretty alright as it is mostly walking up stairs and jungle path and you get to enjoy the lovely mountain breeze and view.I recommend resting when you reach your resting quarters as around 1 am you'll be climbing the second part which imo is slightly tough and depend on your determination.The air will be thin, it will be cold and its hard to see. A good method I use to keep myself going is to use music from my ipod to keep me going.Once you reach the top, you feel you have conquered the world :)"
721,hard climb,You need to pay expensive fees for everything. To go up to the peak you need to pay at least 600RM and also book with 3 month early. Really??? It is a mountain! The essence of the mountain is completely destroyed. No recommended at all.
722,"Worth the 20,000+ stairs!","WOW what an experience. Absolutely worth every second of it, Money can't buy such pleasures. It was a steep ascent to the dormitory and our guide helped us and motivated us all the way we had plenty of pit stops and time to click pictures. The dormitory was basic but had all of the needs for a good climb to the summit e.g. snack bars , fizzy pop. I was surprised they even had a dormitory up there as when I climbed Rinjani we slep in tents with no showers or proper toilets. But this had lovely warm showers and clean toilets. The summit is well worth the climb and it is rewarding to witness sunrise. Well worth the trip we went with "":Amazing Borneo"" a extremely well organised company,"
723,Mt Kinabalu Climb DIY,"One of the best places to visit for lovely crisp fresh mountain air. Mount Kinabalu starts its climbing trek from the Timpohon Gate at an altitude of about 5000 feet. The climb requires a certain degree of fitness, but it can be achieved by almost anyone who is physically able. For those who do not wish to climb its slopes, there is still quite a lot that can be achieved at National Park, one of the entry points to scaling this majestic mountain. National Park offers public amenities such as restaurants as well as forest trails which lead you on to a nature discovery tour. There are also flower gardens as well as villas that can be rented for an overnight stay. All in all, National Park and Mount Kinabalu have quite a lot to offer. An ideal place for a weekend visit or stayover."
724,Amazing walk above the clouds,"I am returning to Mt Kinablu again after 16 years. I would say that the park people had maintained the place well. The road and villa are well kept, if a little old. The damages from the recent earthquake are not evident from this trip. I joined the Amazing Borneo Tour company for the 2 days 1 night climb. The package include buffet style breakfast at HQ before the climb, packed lunch and buffet dinner at Laban Rata rest house where I stayed overnight. Early morning meal before the summit at 2 am and full breakfast after summit. The park no longer gives permit for a day climb, which is very sensible as I feel that for most people with average fitness, the climb is strenuous and 2 days is needed for a safe journey. Having a guide is important as the guide is experienced to monitor fitness of climber, especially for inexperience climbers, signs of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) can be subtle and missed, leading to severe health complications. I didn't experience AMS but noticed that many others did. My guide Roger is excellent in his pacing for my climb. The tour package includes a colourful certificate for a successful climb. Overall, its one of the easily accessible above 4000m mountain in the South East Asia region."
725,Worth the effort,"We stayed here for a nights last few year, must book the room before u come, else they dont allow to enter the gate. We had a fantastic time. The rooms are simple ,small , clean whilst also having amazing views. We woke up to at midnight 2am to rush the sun rise around 6am. We were real upset to leave and can't wait to get back."
726,Mount Kota Kinabalu One of Asia's Gem,"It will be hard, but all the pain will be worth it. The sights and views are beautiful and breath-taking on Day 1 and on Day 2, those get blown out of the water. You will be sore days later."
727,Awesome,"We did not pre-book with a tour group but arrived at the Park the day before I wanted to walk up to the summit  (and back in a single day). Booking in was easy. I went to the Park office and gave my details and was booked in with a guide for a 7am start (guides are compulsory). The morning of the walk I met my guide, paid my money, got driven to the walk start by my wife, and we started walking. There is a hut every km with water available at each, the track is well marked, and the terrain is not too bad - climbing skills are not necessary. However you do need to be fit, particularly if you wish to get up and down in one day. It was sunny at the bottom but became cloudy and windy especially in exposed areas. On the way up my guide kept expressing concerns about weather conditions. About half the people we met coming down had not made it to the top because of the weather. It began raining and got colder as we went past the second checkpoint, and at 3900 metres (about 1 km from the top) my guide said we had to turn back or we would be at risk of hyperthermia. It was only 11am, but visibility was poor (around 10 metres) and it was very cold with strong winds (about 50 km/hr). I was very disappointed, but turned around and made it back to the bottom by 1.30.Suggestions? Don't take too much water - it is available every km or so. Dress appropriately; a light top for the steamy conditions at the bottom; a wool thermal is great for the cooler higher regions, and a wind and rain proof jacket is vital. Fancy hiking boots are not really needed - I did it in runners and was fine. I used gloves for the rails and ropes - I'd say they are vital (even the guides have them).The overnight hut is warm and comfortable and there is food available, so there is no need to take great quantities of food. It is possible to do it without a group and in one day - just make sure you are very fit and practice going up and down stairs for a few weeks, and check in the day before prepared for a 7am start if you want to do it in a day.All up a great experience - the 2 negatives were that I didn't make to the summit, and that we stayed in the Liwagu Suite at the Kinabalu Park Hotel and it is totally overpriced!"
728,A fantastic climb,"My friends and I decided to climb Mt. Kinabalu through the Timpohon trail. The trek took us 6 hours on average speed. It is not an easy climb but definitely worth to try especially for those who love adventure and nature. You need to prepare physically and mentally as well to be able to reach the summit. Of course, there is the convenience of having a porter on the side and a hotel to rest past midway of the climb. The mountain guides were supportive as well. The only thing from the downside is the food in the hotel so don't expect much. But overall, this is a great experience for me. Be sure to reach the summit before sunrise to witness a spectacular view from above. Your fatigue will definitely be compensated once you are on the top and enjoying the great view of Kinabalu. Worth recommending."
729,Mount Kinabalu Half Day Climb is possible!!,"My daughter and I climbed together and it was a truly incredible experience. Sunset on the first day was the most dramatic and beautiful ever experienced. The first day forest was complete contrast to the stark beauty of the summit. Yes it was hard, particularly the night climb, but never felt insurmountable. Excellent guide and organisation with Amazing Borneo tours.Recommend walking sticks for way down and it is very cold at top."
730,Climbing Mt Kinabalu with Kids - Fantastic!,"To put this review into context, my wife and I are seasoned English Lake District fell walkers and bag 20-30 peaks per year.We chose to book a package to climb the mountain through Borneo Eco Adventures. A 3 day 2 night package with the first two days on the mountain with a night at Laban Rata and the second evening / third morning at Poring Hot Springs to relax (well needed).We were picked up promptly as agreed at our hotel in KK at 7am and were driven to the Mt Kinabalu Park HQ. Our registration and getting our permits only took 5 mins. There was also a facility for RM10 per item to leave at the HQ so we left a case here for storage in a locked area.We met our guide who could speak good English and were driven to the Timophon Gate starting point. Guides are mandatory on the mountain (typically 1 guide to 2-3 people). At this point I will add that the guides are really worth listening to. They have climbed the mountain hundreds of times before. We saw people thinking they knew better over the two days which either went off far too quickly and were sick with the altitude, got tired too quickly and didn't make the summit or that fell and hurt themselves.The walk in total is 8.5 km. 6 km on day one up to Laban Rata, then a 2 am start the next day for a 2.5 km trek to the summit, decent back to Laban Rata for breakfast and then completion of the remainder of the decent.Day One: The trail is very well defined and starts with lots of steps. As the day goes on these steps become bigger and steeper and eventually give way to rocks as the rock changes. There are stopping points every 1 km or so with fresh mountain water available. We chose to take water purification tablets to be on the safe side. Our guide encouraged us to take it very slowly for reasons I pointed out earlier. He also insisted at the 4 km point Layat Layat that we took an extended break for lunch to help us adjust to the altitude. From this point onwards (approx. 3000 m in altitude) the air seemed to thin very quickly, tiredness set in and breathing got more difficult. The last 1 km was hard work. It took us about 5.5 hours to reach Laban Rata but there was no rush since there is nothing to do when ypu get there.Laban Rata: A simple mountain hut. There were 4 of us in a room, two bunk beds and it was very cramped. There was no hot water for showers but from my perspective an ice cold shower when I had been hot and sweating all day was just what the dr ordered. There is no need to carry ridiculous ampunts of food and drink up the mountain as there is awell stocked shop up there. Yes the prices are slightly inflated (still not expensive when compared to uk prices) but when you see the locals walking EVERYTHING from food for meals to cans of beer and 40 kg gas canisters up there on their backs then I don't think they are unreasonable at all.Food was decent and plentiful. Laban Rata provide a buffet evening meal between 4.30pm and 7pm, with tea or coffee or water. Breakfast is served from 2am until 3am before the summit climb, and second breakfast 7am - 10am before the main decent. All in with the stay at Laban and you will need the food. We didnt get much sleep at all, it was very noisy, but it does allow you to leave as much gear as possible in your room for the climb to the summit which makes it easier.Day Two: We agreed with our guide that we would meet for breakfast at 2am and begin walking at 2.45am. Head torches are a must. It is slippery steep ground and there is some scrambling involved using ropes. I would also recommend gloves to protect your hands on the roped sections and a hat. It was 4C on the summit when we reached it at 5.45am. Sunrise was officially 6.15am but from 5.30ish the light starts to change and the views were amazing, unforgettable. We had good views on the way up, with sunset from Laban Rata a particular highlight but nothing can prepare you for the breaking dawn over the other jagged sub peaks of Mt Kinabalu, the awesome appearance of Low's gully below your feet and the view back down what you have just ascended - spectacular. It was busy at the top with approx. 100 people getting to the summit at the same time so be prepared to jostle for position for photos and to wait in line to have ypur photo taken at the summit plaque! A point of note here - yes you can climb the mountain in one day but a) you will not see tbe sunrise on the summit, b) you will not see sunset from Laban Rata and c) cloud builds as the day goes on so the summit is actually engulfed with very little visibility for most of the day other than dawn and dusk. This is a regular daily occurence. That's the easy bit done. The decent to Laban Rata took about 1.5 hours. It was steeper than it felt going up and the ropes were necessary as the rocks were slippery with dew / light rain. Some people choae to ignore their guides when descending these rope sections and we saw one particularly bad fall which could have been alot worse. We collected our remaining stuff from Laban Rata, had our breakfast and then continued our decent the same way we went up. The descent took about 3.5 hours from Laban Rata back to the Timophon Gate. It was hard on the knees. The guides are willing to carry rucksacks if necessary and ours gave my wife a walking pole to assist her. We didn't give him our bags but we saw other guides carrying 3 rucksacks plus their own which seemed a bit ridiculous. There were alot of spent people at the bottom with very sore legs especially knees and blisters. I felt my legs for 2-3 days afterwards but it was well worth it.A not to be missed trip with spectacular scenary. An unforgettable experience but please take the advice of your guide!"
731,So far So GD,"Walk starts at 8:00 a.m.  The walk up to the base camp isn't so difficult, especially if it is dry; it is not steep.  There were 2 ways to get there; Mesilau walk is the longer tougher route but I don't think it's that much difference; you only need to past through 1 hr of staircase climbing at the begining and the rest is normal walk.  Bring at least 1.5L water, you can replenish along the way.  Enjoy your walk and no need to hurry because dinner isn't served until much later (after 5 p.m.).  Sleep early and get rested because the last leg climb in the dark can be tiresome.  You will past through wooden staircases, and the rocks until you reach the roped section.  Don't worry, it's not difficult and only for a short stretch.  Then, the steep walk on the base rock all the way to the peak; you'll wonder when you are gonna reach there.  Low oxigen level and the cold can be challenging, but keep on going even if it's only 10 steps at a time.  Reaching the peak is the reward and gives you a sense of accomplishment (for novice climber).  Nice view too, very alien, of rocks and low hanging clouds.  Best to hire a guide to help carry knapsack and boost your confidence.After coming down, if you haven't been to the rapids, try the introductory level at the Kialu river."
732,Climbing,"I think Mount Kinabalu is touted as a mountain that anyone can climb.  I guess this is kind of correct, but it's not actually as simple as they make out, evidenced by the number of people who don't make it to the top, despite A LOT of people starting out in the pitch black from the mountain huts near the top.  Sure, the altitude isn't that high, the distance isn't far, and the paths are easy to follow (most people with any walking experience would happily do this without the required guide).  However... there are short sections of the climb to the summit which are difficult for some people... especially when it's wet, and people don't have the right shoes/clothing.  I saw so many people attempting the summit who simply should not have been doing it.  They were struggling with the rope sections (on the way up and down) moving incredibly slowly (or not moving at all) holding everyone else up/making people come off the ropes to go around them.  People trying to climb in plimsoles/Crocs etc.  Seriously!It's actually a very frustrating experience for anyone with any level of fitness as you get stuck in long, very slow-moving queues of people on the way to the summit (sorry to stereotype, but noramlly Asian women) who are unfit/frightened and shouldn't be there (I'm female so feel I can say this!).  Kind of spoils the experience with the frustration of it all.Anyway, that aside - it can be good fun once you escape the crowds a bit.  The guesthouse at Laban Ratan is pretty good - get there early to bagsie yourself a good table in the dining area.  SO much food which is fab, comfy beds with plenty of bedding (a bit noisy, but you're getting up at 2am anyway).  Only complaint would be how expensive all the extras are at the guesthouse.  I know people have to carry everything up the mountain, but still, a rip-off.If you're fit you can easily get to the summit by sunrise starting out at 3am (you'll have to do some serious over-taking moves though!) and then you can get back down to Laban Ratan for breakfast not long after 7pm.  The trek back down from Laban Ratan is hard on the knees because it's pretty much constant stairs.  Think we did it in 2hrs which was at a fast pace, but most fit people should be able to get back down in 2.5/3hrs, then it's a 2hr drive back to KK.Overall a good experience, but not a climb I'd rush to repeat as it's just too crowded, and the morning circus of people trying to get to the top just spoilt it for me.  Still worth doing once though!"
733,Fitness vs willpower,If you want hundreds of choices of good food with cheap prices US($2 to $3).  Go to the food court in the Gallery Shopping Mall.  It is about 500 m from the ferry terminal towards town on the waterfront.
734,"Fantastic, but do your research on tour companies","This was the first tour of 6 done through ABC Tours (Reviewed separately).My personal opinion is this is not a trip to be done because you are in Borneo as part of a tourist thing to do. The brochure does state you do not need experience in mountain climbing but need to have a good level of fitness. A bit of an under-statement I think. The trek is a 6 Km hike that reaches an elevation of 3700 metres. It is very steep in places, especially the last 2 Kms. I would say a high level of fitness would be a better description. And have youth on your side. I did this with my wife in April and the weather was about right. There was good cloud cover that kept the heat down to bearable. It also rained on the way up but that wasn't a hindrance at all. There are some decent views on the way as well. We noticed them on the way down as there was too much cloud cover on the way up to see them. Due to the nature of this tour I would not recommend it as a tourist experience. However, if you like mountains and are fit then it would be a good one to tick off your bucket list due to the altitudes reached. Unfortunately we were unable to do the Sunrise walk and the Via Ferrata the next day. The decent was probably just as bad as the Ascent as again due to the steepness. I’m not saying not to do it but I’m not going to recommend it as I do not want to mislead anyone."
735,Plan well....,"This is worth doing if you come to Kota Kinabalu.  It's better to have done some physical preparation, but the experience of a climb is hard and unforgettable."
736,Hard but awesome!,I hiked up Mount Kinabalu on 15th June and felt so sick right after I reached Kinabalu park. It was wise decision of me to book entire tour with local tour agency (Borneo Trails) for this time since all I needed to do after climb was hop into their van and rest. It's not advisable to rush and tire up yourself unnecessarily. It would just lead you to sickness and ruin your next trip afterwards. (It happend to me.)Up in the mountain is freezing cold despite the warm weather in Kota Kinabalu. I appreciate the driver for patiently waiting at Kinabalu park from the mid day. I would die if he was not there when I arrived and I had nowhere to rest.
737,Mt Kinabalu vs Mt Rinjani,"Mt Kinabalu your beauty never fail us..its was last August when with my colleague and her Kinabalu  Pink Ribbon group from the aged of 42 - 62 years old . and they are all breast cancer survivor. We start around 9am and we reach Lemaing around 3pm . FYI  they are more fit then me and I proud of them . If they can do it anyone can ... we really enjoy our climbing, We start at 2am the next day and we reached at the peak around 6;30am and the view was Beautiful...."
738,Hard hard hard!!!!,"I came to Sabah largely to climb Mount Kinabalu. I was disgusted to find that one company has monopolised the climbing of the mountain. The price is OUTRAGEOUSLY extortionate. Why have they decided that they own a mountain? It's unfair to make people take a vastly overpriced guide if they do not need it. BOYCOTT for the sake of other travellers, backpackers and humans. You do not own the Earth. It belongs to everyone. Stop robbing people of the chance to enjoy what the Earth has to offer. Your behaviour is appalling"
739,Tougher than it looks,"I climbed Mt Kinabalu on 26-27 April 2013. It was my second attempt, the first being last Sep 2012, when on leaving Laban Rata on the morning it hasd been pouring with rain all night. After climbing for about 1.5 hours, the rangers closed the mountain as it was too dangerous.This time around the weather was more kind. I did reach the summit but it was pretty hard work. The air was so thin that I had to stop often to catch some energy. I am a pretty fit 61yo and jog regularly but at high altitude, it's a different balll game.I suggust for anyone to have a go, but be prepared. You can get there. Take wet, hot and cold clothering so you can layer off as appropriate.Take lots of water to be fully hydrated as well as energy bars. Its a long walk. If you suffer from headaches or high altitude sickness, you may like to carry Diamox.You may need to get back to Laban Rata to check out at 10.00am. It may be an idea to arrange for your gear to be ""checked out"" just in case you are slow. I heared of several groups turning back and not been able to summit as they would have been late in getting back to Laban Rata.Enjoy the challenge, listen to the guide especially in the rope section at night.Have fun!"
740,It is a place must go,"Climbed it when i was a kid.. can still remember all those breathtaking moments.. well, some of them.. only problem is, need to arrange for it in advance.. few months a head at least.. but that was back than.. not sure for now.. evrystep on the way up was a wonderful experiance.. the views, the fresh air evrything.. lots of rare plants, birds, flower.. by d way its home for the largest flower in d world.. the rafflesia.. even the drive from Kota Kinabalu was enjoyable.. lots of things to see.. lots of interesthing places to stop by..there, we got a very helpfull porter n guide.. be sure to spend some time in the nearby town-Kundasang or ranau and have a taste of the local rice wine ""lihing"".."
741,Great experience - just do it,"I knew what I was getting in for so I hesitate to complain. I will try to be objective in this review. First I was going along because it was my husband who wanted to do this climb, for me it mattered not. I knew this wasn't going to be your typical hike. The first half is all stairs and yes I knew that before hand. What I wasn't expecting was the fact that you couldn't see anything during your hike. There were a few points where if the weather was clear (which it was not) you might have been able to glimpse a beautiful view of something. However it rained the last 2 hours of our hike and the first 2.5 hours were cloudy so the first day essentially became a stair master challenge as that is all you could see in front of you. It was unfortunate but no one can control Mother Nature. That said, there still were not ample opportunities for views.  On the upside our guide did try and point out the local flora and fauna and I was thankful for that as when you can't see a darn thing except stairs it is nice to have a few distractions.  Unfortunately we were not staying in Laban Rata but at another hut about 200 m away.  The hut we stayed in had pros/cons. The bedsheets were crisp and clean but the curtain on the window was mouldy and gross.  I know it is a mountain hut in the tropics but really, why can't they change the curtains or wash them once in a while. When your sleeping the curtain is at face level, hence the mould is too....urg.  Sleeping was next to impossible. It was like summer camp with people running up and down the halls all night long. You could hear people throwing up in the bathroom which was way down the hall from us. Bring earplugs that is imperative.  Ahh... but finally we get to climb at 3 am in the morning. We didn't go down for breakfast but instead had some energy bars prior to the climb. Second day more interesting in that hiking in the dark was quite the experience. Again our guide was great. So many people were trying to go straight up and our guide was making us weave back and forth. In the end we would pass all the people who were passing us going straight up as they were climbing too fast and furious and had to break to catch their breath.  Getting to Low's Peak just before Sunrise was great. However, if I were to be brutally honest it was slightly anti-climatic. Yes it was beautiful but for me it wasn't worth the effort.  Overall it was a challenging climb but that's it.  Perhaps if the weather was better the first day and we could at least of caught glimpses of something it would have maybe been worth the stair master challenge and a sleepless night but again that is luck of the draw. At least the second day was clear and for that I am thankful.   Just for all those who are thinking of doing this climb I would strongly suggest poles.  I am 5'7 and 55 years old and my hiking poles not only saved my knees coming down but helped me in climbing the stairs which were of various heights.  Hiking with poles in general requires less energy.  Final thoughts, it wasn't my climb it was my husbands and that likely played a part on how I viewed this experience. He enjoyed it way more than I did but he wanted the challenge. If you want the challenge I say go for it. If you want to enjoy lots and lots of incredible views and vistas along the way but still have a challenging hike then in my not so humble opinion pick a different trail or a different mountain somewhere else in the world."
742,WELL WORTH THE CLIMB!,"We have heard about this mountain before. Its the highest in South East Asia, and a great mountain indeed for climbers around the world. But we are no climbers, we came to see the mountain actually.We drove from Kota Kinabalu on a rental car, and put a night at the foot of the Mountain. Later we enter the Kinabalu Park. There is a small fee to enter. The park is very nice and there are many accomodations and restaurant, however in the park itself, you could see the mountain at all. I think we drove around 8 kilometers in the Park before we decided to get out and get some pictures away from the foothill.If you are lucky you could get some very good pictures of the summit at places further away, such as Kundasang and even Ranau. There is also a nice attraction at Kundasang, the war memorial which you may visit. Anyway look at the pictures to understand more of Mount Kinabalu."
743,An amazing experience.,Something a normal fit person should do when wisiting kk. Wonderfull but oooo so hard. Two days is absolutely enough if you are normal fit and i think you know if you are able to do it in one day. But do not forget that the thin air makes a huge difference on the endurance!!!
744,A Good Walk At The Base,"Talk about the beauty when you reach the top...Keep going up and the reward is definitely worth the price you are paying to climb this mountain.No pain no gain. Once you reach the top, your breath shall be taken away!!I've reached the top and no regret!!visited: May 2013"
745,Majestic Mount Kinabalu,"experienced hiker - been up kili, kalar patar, inca trail, atlas mountains etcKota Kinabalu is the PITS... REALLY BADIts a dull, boring, massive stair climb. There is ONE viewpoint on the way up.. just stairs in a corridor of trees.The lodge that they force you to stay at on the way up is like a bad prison. The dorm rooms are disgusting (the food was good but their buffet has no drinking water so they can fleece you for a fortune rehydrating yourself with their expensive water - PATHETIC).The jail (sorry... lodge) should have a good view but the single pane glass windows are constantly covered with condensation so you can't see a thing. They even lock the viewing gallery decking so you can't go out on it.There is no hot water (they can't be bothered to install gas showers so they blame the freezing cold water on lack of solar power - PATHETIC).They force you up at 2:30am even though the summit climb from the lodge is only 2700 feet (about 3 hours return) so could start at dawn. They do this so they can get rid of you and make space for the next bunch of Muppets who have agreed to pay the TOTALLY EXTORTIONATE prices for climbing their stairs.  (each person 2000RM = c.$460 for one night in this jail).Your guide will not know anything and will not give you any advice whatsoever - he will just follow you up the stairs and then hold his hand out for a big tip at the end.Trust me ITS NO WORTH IT, I'm British, in my 40s and I've hiked all around the world, this is the worst by far. Just go to a skyscaper near you and climb the stairs all the way to the top a few times over and you will get more rewarded than this rip off.Despite charging you a fortune - everything and I mean everything you want is extra charge... a towel in your $460/night jail cell... well of course that will be an extra charge.. you like toilet roll in the loo? forget it! Its cold and run down, a horrible place to stay.  Be a muppet - go and pay them a fortune for nothing and see it for yourself."
746,Hard work but totally worth it.,"This amazing Mt Kinabalu - its a must do at least once in a life time !!! Fortunately, this was not my first time - i have never tired adoring the view  all the way from Timpohon to Low Peak . The hike is not easy especially the second part, ascend to summit. I strongly to recommend to prepared physically ( training ) as early as possible. another advice - try to gather more information before climb - such what to bring and etc"
747,i tried so hard to make it to the summit crawling on all fours like a dying dog,Mt Kinabalu park is a UNESCO world Heritage site. Feel very cool when the time we visit as is rainy day.Visited to the botanical garden.
748,Great trip,"Well organised, expensive, but worth every penny.Walking up is no fun... one girl staying in my dorm cried the whole way to the summit... but once you are at the top of the mountain the views are so amazing it is totally worth the money and effort involved in getting there.  We had crazy strong winds, but clear weather with full moon on one side and sunrise on the other.  The guides are brilliant, totally competent and professional they make you feel really safe.  Take panadol for the headaches from the altitude.   And make sure your shoes fit properly so you dont lose toenailes after the walk down.  The guides carry walking poles that you can use to save your knees if you need it.  And dont underestimate how freezing it is up there - hats and gloves are a necessity!!!!  The more you train obviously the more you enjoy it, but its definitely doable with just average fitness.  The food up there is pretty good, and the accommodation is in dorm rooms but clean and absolutely freezing in the non-heated hut.  They provide blankets for free.  Overal an awesome trip. I did the climb by myself so had a guide just for me, was brilliant.  Did the mesilau route on the way up and timpohon on the way down, 2 km longer and steeper but much prettier and nice to see both sides of the mountain."
749,Mt Kinabalu Mountain Torq,did not climb it but surely one day will.. begin at the foot of the mountain already make the desire of  want to be on top of the mountain become greater.
750,Wonderful place!,"Say hello to the most gruelling trek which takes you such a high - a high which no alcohol or anything else can ever give you!Trek - extremely challenging. There are two parts of the trek. A, from the start till Laban Rata [where you stay overnight] and then you rest for the night [max 4 hours] and start an early morning trek, around 3 or 4am and you go up the mountain to the summit. Stay - Laban Rata [ensure you get this one] is quite ok. Food is average, stay is also average but manageable. What else do you expect up the mountain? :)Experience - Totally worth all the pain. Pre-Requisites - Try and train a bit. Do a little running and keep yourself physically fit. Buy necessary gear. You cannot trek this with normal Nike or Reebok shoes. You need the trekking shoes. There is so much pressure on your feet while you do the trek and this shock cannot be absorbed by normal sneakers. If you are not someone who enjoys the cold, make sure you wear warmers. Carry a rainproof jacket - when the rain hits, it hits you hard. So, shoes, warmers, jackets - a must. Journey - Beautiful. And tiring. You have many stops and you can break at each of these points - but make sure you arent there for too long! Quicker you finish, more rest you get before the next trek.Aftermath - Your thighs and your butt are going to hurt a lot. But hey, no pain, no gain, right?Have a wonderful trek!"
751,Physically very demanding but totally worth it,"The view of mount kinabalu from our hotel was spectacular! on a clear day you will be able to see the granite on the peak of the mountain.  However , not many attractions nearby and gets really boring at night.   The canopy walk at the park is worth trying! So is the Poring hot spring.  Desa dairy farm is nearby but nothing interesting.  Gets to watch the milking process behind a wall of glass instead of experiencing it. There some vegetable stores about 10 mins drive from desa farm and you can satisfy your taste buds on different types of local fruits! If you are lucky, might be able to see the blooming Rafflesia.  Cost about Rm10 /person.  We manage to see them on our way to the Poring hot spring."
752,Tough Climb,"All 11 of us requested Suning to be our guide again for this trip and he has brought along his brother. The two of them helped so many hikers especially on descending, at the rope section. Strongly encourage you to prebook him as your hiking guide. You can make request to Ms Christina Lam from Sutera Harbour when you make package booking. To our horror, the shop no longer sell wooden hiking sticks! Without the trusted wooden hiking sticks, coming down will be really tough, especially if it rains, and true it did. Those metal hiking sticks that some of my friends brought already broken on their way up, too flimpsy compared to the reliable stout wooden sticks. Suning has kindly search as many sticks he could find from the guide quarters and loan them to us. Indebted to his kindness. Remember to bring your hiking sticks when you next visit the mountain.Some of my friends experienced knee pain after hiking up, so do wear ankle guard and muscle rub. Via Ferrata could be fully booked when you decided to book them upon arriving. My two friends nearly got refused participation if not some people didnt turn up for the compulsory briefing. The activity can take sometime as well.Descending is the most dangerous part. Rope section needs both hands and a strong heart. My friends saw a caucasian who fell a few flights of stairs due to slippery staircase in the rain. I wore adidas kampong in order to avoid slipping, at the expense of lack of cushion and a fallen out toe nail after that due to constant impact. Near the summit, a woman went unconcious and have to be carried down by the guide to Laban Rata lodge. The guide ran down and shocked all of us, including our guide, cos he didnt use the rope when he ran down. The cost for rescue like this is RM300/km, which has be pre-agreed before the guide willing to carry you down on his back, or use stretchers.It was a fun and memorable hike on a full moon night i must say. Do try it. Book a package by calling Ms Christina Lam, and request Suning to be your guide and you are assured they look will look after you nicely."
753,Awesome,"We booked a tour through the hotel and it was well organised and we had an excellent driver.  I wouldn't recommend the Poring Hot Springs as they have just been made into outdoor baths with hot and cold water taps, just wait and have a bath in the hotel.  I would suggest organising a day trip just to Mount Kinabalu to explore the many trails around the park."
754,Best To-Do in Kota Kinabalu,"This is an excellent couple of days out of a visit to Borneo, but beware it is not easy!!!I booked my trip with a friend through a tour company and although more expensive, they do sort everything for you. We were picked up from our hotel at 6.30 in Kota Kinabalu and then driven the 90 minute trip to pick up our passes and guide. The driver sorted all of this for us and then took us to the start of the trek. Lunch was also provided and we were off by 8.30am. The 6K trek to the lodge is actually quite pleasant when it's a nice day. Don't get me wrong, it is tough but if you take it slowly, it'e quite bearable. It took us just under 6 hours and we didn't have too many people passing us, so I thought this was a reasonable time. We stayed at the pendant lodge which had food waiting for us when we arrived (sausages, mashed potato, toast and baked beans) and hot tea and coffee. The lodge itself was nice, with bunk beds and warm sleeping bags. I had a sleeping bag liner too incase the bags they provided were dirty, but they were clean, fresh and very cosy. Buffet dinner is provided at the main lodge and then you'll find that most people drift to bed around 19.00 or 20.00 since you need to get up at 2.00 to start your climb to the summit and this is a climb rather than a trek. There are parts where you will be pulling yourself up with a rope and others where you will be clambering on your hands and knees to get up there. It is tough, but the sense of achievement when you reach the summit is amazing! Be warned though, it is incredibly cold and windy. My hands especially were really cold and I wished I had taken my ski gloves.The trek back down to the lodge is good and the views now the sun have come up are amazing, but the trek down the 6KM after the lodge are incredibly painful. I understand its better to do this at a bit of a jog, but my friend wasn't too well and so we walked and every step sends a jolt through your legs, but again the sense of achievement once you walk through that gate is incredible. Would I do it again??? Never!!!!!!"
755,"Not a walk in the park, but amazing experience!","The first part of the trek to the top of Mt Kinabalu starts at the Timpohon Gate were you proceed down to a beautiful water fall then the climb begins the trek takes in lots of stairs, rocks and rest areas a bit of early advice take every thing slowly. Over night you will say at Laban Rata in bunk style beds small tip if your room is not full grab an extra mattress off another bed makes your bed more comfortable and a better night sleep,the next morning your adventure to the top will start around 2:30 am. Take it easy take a good head torch and take warm clothing for the peak it can be cold. It is not until after sun rise you appreciate the beauty of Mt Kinabalu Simply Amazing"
756,A great climbing experience,"If you ever get the opportunity to climb Mt Kinabalu, then do it, it is an amazing experience. The weather will play a huge role and can make or break your good or average experience, luckily when I climbed it (May 2012), the weather the entire two days was fantastic, but luck of the draw!!!Be sure to get organised and make sure you have the right gear as this too will make your experience good or average/bad - especially good shoes with good grip, I wore Salomon trail running shoes and it was great, no issue with support and grip..Before you go, try to speak with people that have done it before so you only take the gear that you really need.."
757,Worth the effort!,"The trails were safe. Only one path all the way to the top. Rested at Laban Rata. Although the cafeteria was not pleasing, somehow the top of Mount Kinabalu was a splendid place enough to make one forgets about the living condition at Laban Rata.It was not really a tough mountain to climb. Still, one needs to be in average shape and have a good mind power to make it to the top. Early morning walk could be accompanied by beautiful stars when it is not cloudy."
758,Mountain Climb,"Via Ferrata package is very bad package, it was double the standard price but accommodations and foods were lower the standard package. No worth the money. Join the normal package will do, the via Ferrata guide also not so friendly."
759,didnot go up but around bottom was fine too,"Husband and I extremely ENJOYED this tropical adventure! Seriously, never ever underestimate Mount Kinabalu. It was a hard climb. It was EidulFitri break so we both 'did not have much time' to continue our regular training lol. Needless to say we were anxious to start our climb. The terrain was constantly taxing our balance skills and leg muscles. Huts and untreated fresh mountain water are like our life-saviour. Be careful of the slippery rocks. Enjoy the view. Greet the fellow climbers. Be patient. The walk was exhausting and felt at some times like it was never ending but please oh please do not give up! All in all this is a very rewarding, awe inspiring climb. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3Special note: Dear roommates SHINSUKE & DAISUKE from Japan, if you read this, please contact us @ azli.suraya@yahoo.com. It such a regret for not asking for your contact details. Thank you for your warmth & kindness."
760,get a good set of legs,"Stayed in the lodge in a 2 bedroom villa complete with kitchen, lounge/diner and balconies.  Only problem it was very cold, needed light coats. The restaurant could only be reached by a shuttle bus, very efficient.  Food very basic canteen with a poor vegetarian choice.  The walk around the mountain was stunning."
761,One day kinabalu climb,"My husband and I hiked the Kinabalu maintain one week before the earthquake. Our thoughts go to the people affected by the earthquake.We were deeply saddened. We organized our hike through Amazing Borneo and they were AMAZING. Go prepared. You need all the things suggested. We took pain killers and altitude sickness pills and did not have any problems. Do not start too fast. Look around and enjoy the nature. The climb was the hardest thing I have ever done physically. But, at the same time it is one of the most magnificent thing I have ever experienced. It was a very special experience for us."
762,Mental and Physical Challenges,"Before I climbed, I watched videos on YouTube on how to best experience Mount Kinabalu. Truly, this is a magnificent place on earth. The summit feels like from another planet with its cold rocks. It will numb your fingers without gloves. This is no easy climb and not recommended for beginners. This is for the experienced class, considering the difficulty of the terrain especially climbing via a rope with only your headlight to guide, and on your sides are cliffs covered by pitch black darkness. You have at least a healthy heart to be able to handle the ordeal. Bring muscle pain relievers with you. Also beware not to drink from any water source along the way, it gave me abdominal pains and diarrhea. Reach the summit before sunrise to get the best pictures with less crowd."
763,Awesome experience!!,"Mt Kinabalu isn't easy. In fact when we were ascending from Laban Rata it was windy, cold and threatening to rain. Trusted our guide that he had the best judgement of it all, and thanks to him were one of the first to reach the summit. He basically hurried us along and I think that helped. Thinking too much wouldn't have done us any good as it was more a mental challenge for us than a physical one.The weather going up the last 2 km over the steep rockface was something else. At some point I thought maybe I died and was in hell paying my dues. Most who reached the summit that day felt the same, and in fact less than half of the climbers that day made it. The rain was not just getting in our face and eyes, but they were soaking us all wet. Even with ponchos my feet and hands were soaked through waterproofs. In 0-5 degree weather this was no joke especially when I needed my limbs to be at their best, and not stiff and bordering on cramping. Having hiked overseas where we had cold windy and wet English weather, we thought we've experienced it all but no. I realised that this is not to be underestimated because of its height. Ben Nevis in Scotland is just 1344m ASL and this is over four thousand. The wind didn't help. I was mostly hanging on to the rocks for dear life. And the visibility, oh my I could hardly see the peak when I was approaching it. People get lost up there despite having a rope to follow, and before this trip I couldn't understand why. Now I know why.All in all, this was an extraordinary trip because unlike most hiking trips in Malaysia this was more a battle against the elements. Physically it is do-able but unless you persevere against what may feel like the end of your life you will not make it up there. We hardly saw a thing from Low's peak but the sense of achievement and grandeur cannot be rivalled by any other mountain I've conquered."
764,Decent Hike,"My wife and I climbed Mt Kinabalu on 9 and 10 May 2015. We used the Mesilau route. We are fit and run about 50km per week to stay healthy. We are in our 40's. There were many 20 somthings on the track and we were some of the older people on the track. It is tough. We were above avarage with our tempo and it took us close to 6 hours. Mesialu is only 2km longer but it takes about 1-1and half hours longer than the Timpohon.Allow yourself 1 hour per km. The dorms are fine but noisy. No hot water. The shower feels like ice, but we could not go to bed dirty! Remember earplugs. Food is great.It might be worth it to concider taking ibubrufen 3 times a day. Works well for muscle pain. Also concider getting a prescription for Acetacolamide 125mg twice daily. It helps for prevention of acute mountain sickness ( altitude disease). There were a number of people getting sick on the last day towards the summit... They had to return and missed out on the amazing sunrise. You need to on your way no later than 02h30 am otherwise you will miss the sunrise which was at 05h45."
765,"Say never to the Day tour: ""Mt Kinabalu & Poring Hotsprings""",Just came back from a trip to Mt Kinabalu. It was the most beautiful place. The air was cool and crisp. My husband and his friends had a most enjoyable climb to the summit of the mountain while I stayed back and relaxed at the foothills. We stayed at the Rose Cabin. While the hotel itself was a disappointment the view from our room was breathtaking. We could see the mountain clearly. Make sure you wake up before dawn to walk around and catch the view of the mountain at dawn.
766,Try Road Signs!,"In April this year my wife and I (both in our 50's) climbed Mt Rinjani, a trip inspired by having climbed Mt Kinabalu the previous April. This review is our comparison of the two.Are the trekking companies similiar?We climbed Mt Kinabalu with Amazing Borneo and Mt Rinjani with Rudy Trekker. Both companies were above expectations and really couldn't be seperated. They both will not be the cheapest you could go with but they are certainly among the very best for service, communiction and efficiency. Which is the highest climb?Mt Kinabalu is certainly the highest at 4100 odd meters while Rinjani is 3700 odd. What we found interesting is that despite the 400 meter difference in height the climbs are actually very similiar as far as climbing heights are concerned. Rinjani starts at 1100m and climbs to 3700 while Kinabalu starts at 1500 and finishes at 4100. The night climbs are roughly the same and roughly over the same time frame.Were the climbs similiar?Mt Kinabalu has a lot of stairs, is well defined and includes a number of railings or ropes to assist walkers. Views are reasonably limited due to the vegetation until you reach Laban Rata. Mt Rinjani has next to no stairs or railings. There is a fair amount of erosion on some sections, as a result new pathways have formed to avoid those scrambling sections. The climb is open and provides views the entire way. As far as safety is concerned Kinabalu is a standout with everyone on the mountain very conscious of climber safety.Which climb was hardest?We both have no doubt that Mt Rinjani is the hardest. Both are hard but the final attempt to summit at Mt Rinjani is the difference. The reason being is that the path leading to the top is made of scree and the best description I can give is that it is like a carpet of very tiny irregular shaped marbles. These marbles do not compress very well and because of the degree of slope you do find there is a high degree of slippage with each step. We used walking poles with the baskets on and attempted to drive them through the scree surface to solid ground, sometimes that worked but not very often.  Which view was the best?We had spectacular weather for both climbs but the view from the top of Mount Kinabalu wins hands down. That doesn't mean the view from Mt Rinjani was not worth it there is just way more postcard like snap to take on the Kinabalu climb.Which climb was the most pleasant?We enjoyed the Mount Kinabalu climb the best, home comforts at Laban Rata certainly played a part in that and the fact that it is a highly organised climb on a well defined track with a high level of safety helped. Suggestions and Recommendations?Prepare to freeze at the top, it was surprising how many people come under prepared. Train for stairs if doing Mount Kinabalu but include stamina training for Mount Rinjani. Walking poles are essential. Visit a Doctor before leaving home and obtain an altitude sickness prescription. We both had slight headaches on the Kinabalu climb, it seemed nearly every one involved suffered to some degree even the guides. On Mount Rinjani we didnt see any noticeable sufferers but then the heights are certainly different. Get a good guide - we heard many stories and witnessed many who simply did not come prepared or who did not care.Would we do either again?If there was a choice to make - Mount Kinabalu   We have written this review a few days after the earthquake, our thoughts are with those who have suffered, it has saddened us both deeply, Mount Kinabalu was a very special time for us. We are however very pleased to hear that in time the climb will be reopened, it is an amazing experience and one that we would not hesitate on doing again."
767,A GREAT ADVENTURE GETTING TO THE SUMMIT,"Tiring and long, only for those with best physical ability, but well worth the experience!"
768,Kinabalu Park Day Trip or Overnight,"I haven't seen the Himalayas but after seeing the Crocker Range, I would die happy. This mountain range is spectacularly beautiful and Mt Kinabalu is its crowning glory. We had the vantage point of the 7th floor of the Mt Kinabalu Hotel (forget the spa bit as it doesn't really rate a mention). The peaks of this mountain  have a fascinating appeal whether partly couded or completely clear. Without the hype of all the tourists hell-bent on climbing her back, you can potter quietly all day around the other walks and even on the road from the park HQ to the power tower and back (the same distance as the climb up Mt Kinabalu (8Km) but without the life-threatening stress on bodies not primed for this kind of strenuous activity. The whole park is really a gorgeous place for its variety of forest, bird life, flowers and riverine aspects. The display centre is really worth a visit for 3R - excellent value! The two days in the Park were glorious - sunny with fresh breezes. Strange phenomenon though is being on a high hill on a high floor in the Mt Kinabalu hotel and experience an entirely different climate. For the three nights there the wind howled and rattled the windows. The tall pines were almost bending over to the ground. Weather changed moment by moment. It was wild and exhilirating but COLD. Being in this hotel made you feel as if you were at eye level with the mountain peak. Regardless of the state of the hotel, the experience was awesome.    I was however glad to move on to the swelter of Poring. Now for food - very important - opposite the park headquarters there is the best value for money and good food we found anywhere in Borneo (even for vegetarians). It is the cafe/restaurant overlooking the valley and just over the road from the park. You can't miss it as it is the only one there. PS the fee to enter the park is only 15R and the best value ever."
769,Don't miss it,"I climbed Mt. Kinabalu in one day with my wife because Laban Rata was all booked for our available dates and we found it to be quite expensive and time-exhausting to stay overnight for the 17.6km journey, so we gambled and attempted it in one day.  Thankfully, we had a window of terrific weather that permitted us to make the summit before 1:00pm after starting at 7:40am.  Unfortunately it was quite cloudy, cold, and windy at the summit but the views coming down were excellent.  It was very challenging to make the time-cuts, but certainly worth it.  If you're experienced, want to avoid the crowds and waiting in the dark for the sunrise at the summit, all while saving a few MYR along the way, I highly recommend climbing in one day.  You'll need to apply early (7:00am - 8:00am) the day before you climb, and pray for good weather.  Bring pants, light thermal layer, rain gear, light winter cap & gloves, you'll need them for sure.  For two people we paid 415MYR total for park entry, climbing permits, insurance, one guide, round-trip shuttle from HQ to Timpohon Gate, and bag storage at HQ.  We also tipped our guide Johny because he was awesome and a great asset to our victorious climb.  Enjoy the journey!"
770,Mt Kinabalu Canopy walk,A must when you come to kota kinabalu. Enjoyed our ride there. Stopped at the little stalls. Picked a fe sovenior for friends and nice fresh strawberries.
771,Not easy,"It took me 6 hours to reach Laban Rata via Mesilau, but it was worth the effort as the trail was much nicer than via timpohon. Most of the hike was just climbing up well laid steps. The last 2 hours or so gets steeper and you might want to reach early before it starts pouring. Accommodation in  Laban Rata was basic, the food was ok. You dont get hot showers up there and it would be like taking iced bath. The night hike from Laban Rata to the peak would be done in large groups and there's nothing much to see in the dark until the sun starts rising. Standing above those clouds as the sun rises has been the most majestic view i've ever seen. Being there at the summit was a personal gratification. Ascending down to Laban Rata was actually much tougher. I ascended down through timpohon and was glad that i took the trail up via Mesilau. Overall a great hike."
772,Great place,"This is an amazing opportunity for all who take it. Don't under estimate how hard it is, but in saying that almost half our crowd looked over 50 so big ups to them! Any one can do it. Take your time, most people have their own guide which are there to help and our guide was awesome he let us do our own thing and only helped when asked. You push yourself to your own limit and the views and pictures are beyond this world. The up mountain accomodation is good, no hot water but that's fine. Food is great and buffet so feed your faces!! Take lots of warm clothes for the summit!!! And leave a week to recover! :)"
773,Mount Kinabalu in One Day!,"We booked our tour package through Best Borneo, and they were pretty decent. Though it really broke my heart when I heard the guide was paid only MYR 120 -  that's around 40USD. Which is very sad, since we paid about USD 700 for the package for 2 people.My husband and I are quite fit, but we have never done any kind of trekking. Day 1 6:30 AM: Pick up from our hotel.8 AM: Reached Sutera lodg, where we were given packed lunch - sandwiches. We also dropped off our luggage that we were not planning to carry up the mountain for MYR 10 per suitcase.9 AM : Timphoon gate - 6 KM climb, mostly steps. Super tiring, carry lots of water. Need to keep hydrated. Lots of huts with toilets along the way. 1:30 PM: Reached Laban rata. We were pretty quick and one of the first few to reach laban rata. Rooms were not heated, and food was not being served until 4:30 so we decided to sleep for a bit.4:30 PM: Had lunch and took pictures7 PM: went to bed to get up early.2 AM: Woke up and had breakfast. By 3 AM we were ready to start the climb to the summit. We had not carried many warm clothes. Which was a mistake. And even bigger mistake was not carrying gloves. I was wearing a top, and 2 thin thermals and a wind cheater, yet shivering, so my guide gave me his raincoat. But since we did not have gloves our hands were frozen, and I had never felt that kind of burning sensation in my hands, they were frozen and numb. Be prepared for freezing temperatures nearing the summit, and extremely strong winds.6 AM: We made it to the summit, and never felt so proud of ourselves. It was amazing. 6:15: Started the climb down, which was much harder, and very slippery in some places. And my guide had to hold on to my in a certain section, and sort of carry me down with him, along the rope. Make sure your shoes have really good grip.7:30 AM: We made it to laban rata, and decided to relax for 1 hour before breakfast.8:30 AM: Had breakfast and checked out by 9 and started the 6 km climb down.12:30 PM: Reached the Timphoon gate! One word of caution, my phone was stolen at Laban rata. It was also my fault that I left it on the bed in the morning before we went to have breakfast (just before checkout), and didn't realise it was missing until we were 2 km down the mountain later. So I am not sure if my dorm mates took it or the house keeping, but my phone was gone. So be careful with your personal belongings.Overall an amazing experience that will leave you feeling like a big achiever :)"
774,Summit to Low's Peak [4095.2m],The trip to Mount Kinabalu will make you want to go back for more.  .. more adventure... more respect for nature and environment.
775,Spectacular setting,"A place that is accessible to anyone of average fitness and enough determination.Getting everything settled for you is really easy since there are many tour agents available.Get to the top, and enjoy probably one of the world's most beautiful sunrises."
776,Summited with my 10-year old :),"Mount Kinabalu National Park tour component was rushed.  Poring Hot Springs is not a natural spring experience - the water is channelled into tiled baths.  The canopy walk is very good but you need to be fit and have lots of water.  Provided lunch at the Cottage Hotel is not the best, although good in that we didn't get ill.  An experience."
777,Cooling,"As many things in Borneo, this place cannot be done independently anymore. The government has brought a new regulations since the earthquake, extremely increasing the price to enter mount kinabalu park. A new 100 RM permit fee + 7 RM for insurance per person + a mandatory guide for 150 RM per day, on top of the 15 RM entrance fees. This is even if you just want to trek the easy trail going half way up. The earthquake seems a good excuse to make more money. The new permit fee has nothing to do with safety issues, the excuse of the earthquake doesn't make any sense. As many things in Borneo, prices are ridiculously expensive and unfortunately people keep paying. It is a pity for backpackers who want to discover Borneo's nature in a affordable way. Let's hope it will stop many people going so they can realise this is not a good way to do tourism."
778,Awesome Experience,"Come and join the adventure. It is really worth all the sweat, pain, and hardship once you reach the peak. This club (Kelab Pendaki Cap Kapal Sabah- can be found in facebook page) can satisfy your needs to hike those mountains. Less leisure but full with great memories.Every mountains has its own speciality, experience and rate it by yourself.- Back to Nature-"
779,Breathtaking,"We had been reading reviews of the mountain trek for quite some time, and had been training by walking up hundreds of stairs and hills and thought we were pretty fit.  We are no spring chickens (60 and 53) but thought we had the fitness and determination to make it to the top.  It is a slog, relentless climbing and no respite.  We took about 5 hours to make it to Laban Rata, as one of us was suffering from altitude sickness and felt pretty bad from about 2500 metres.  After a 2.30 AM start, the altitude sickness proved too much for one of us who turned back, the other making it to the top at about 5.30AM.  Be prepared for some hand and feet climbing on the rope section and also at the final ascent to Low's Peak.  The view from the top is amazing and worth the pain.  The walk down is a case of jelly legs, but the views are inspirational.  It's all worth it in the end, but put in some training, do it with a back pack.  We drank five litres of water on the way to Laban Rata, that weight plus the toiletries, jackets, headlamps, etc meant we were carting about about 10 kgs extra which is really telling on the slippery rocks and steps."
780,Worth it But Challenging!,"I climbed this mountain with my girlfriend in late June 2019. To climb, you need a permit, insurance, a guide, and a bed booked near the summit on the night of your climb – these are all compulsory. Compared to my climb of Mt. Fuji in Japan, I initially found the prices and all things required to climb surprising, especially given that it was a far lesser developed country. We had booked directly with Sabah Parks. Please note that there are many sites out there using Mount Kinabalu in their domain address that are not official! These are also substantially overpriced. Despite being compulsory, a guide is definitely not needed for this climb – I think this is a way of UNESCO trying to increase employment in the area. In short, the difficulty of the climb is quite tough physically, especially given the altitude sickness that ensues (very hard to prepare for), but definitely possible with a bit of willpower. We stayed in Hotel Eden54 prior to our climb, meaning that we left from Kota Kinabalu centre in the morning of our climb. Many people opt to get to Kinabalu Park the night before – this may have been a better option. If you are leaving from KK centre, you can get a shuttle bus heading towards the direction of Ranau in the early morning, but this will only leave once full. If you want it to leave early, you need to pay for the empty seats, which we ended up doing unfortunately. We met many who managed to get a Grab (Malaysian Uber) to the mountain, but no one accepted our requests (primarily because they cannot find someone to drive back to KK centre once they drop you off). We arrived at the Park HQ around 9:30am and the last time to start a climb is 10:30. However, time tends to fly at HQ with all the admin or paperwork; I would definitely recommend getting here earlier. As there were only two of us and we were the last to start the climb, we had no choice but to split a guide between us, which ended up being quite expensive. I believe it was around £50 for the guide fee. This however came with significant advantages, the main one being that we did not have to wait for anyone else and that we could go at our own pace. Our guide Andy was very friendly, he gave us many tips and facts about the mountain and its climb. He had completed the climb over 1000 times despite being very young. The climb to the very top is just over 8.5km and you sleep at Laban Rata at around the 6.5km mark. The first 2km are a breeze. I would say the first 3.5km are comfortable, the later on the hike it gets, the more the degree of incline increases. Every 700 or so metres there is a checkpoint with a toilet and some shaded seats where we could also meet some of our fellow climbers – only around 100 do it a day so you will meet many of them! At the early stages of our climb, we saw many of those who were on their way down. It was sad to see that they were all in a miserable mood – it was too cloudy to see anything close to a sunrise. After the 3.5km mark, the intensity starts to take its toll; the air is thinner, you’re probably going to be drenched in sweat and you will tackle long period of rocky inclines that never seem to end. Please do not take the first 3km as a proxy for how long the rest of the hike will take. 4.5-6.5km felt like years. As the degree of incline is so high, you cover distance so slowly and every time you see an update citing that you’ve covered another 50m in 10 minutes, it’s a bit of a slap in the face.We nevertheless made it to Laban Rata around 4pm, this is probably above average considering that we passed the climb turnstiles at 11am. Within Laban Rata, we slept at the Panabalan Hostel. There is also the Lemaing Hostel, but this is reserved for Malaysian nationals. Panabalan was fantastic, we each had our own single bed, with a metre distance away from the next. This was so different to Mt. Fuji where we were piled like sardines. We slept from 16:30 to around 18:00 before going to the canteen for dinner. The canteen food is amazing. All-you-can eat system- just perfect after a long hike. Food was very nice- ginger beef the best for me. At around 21:00, we saw the sunset which was just beautiful. It led us to accept that if it was cloudy in the morning, at least we saw a great sunset. Sleep was not difficult for us but everyone we had talked to the morning after said they could not sleep at all. It gets very cold in the rooms so be sure to bring lots of clothes. There is also no hot water, so if you want to shower it’ll be cold one.  We woke up around 1:00 to have a light breakfast at the canteen, and then resumed the climb at 2:00. May be worth noting that the altitude sickness at this point was quite intense for me, despite having gone skiing several times. The final 2000m climb is hard and everlasting. There are periods of long steep straights that never seem to end. For the final 1500m there is often a rope to support you, but going on all fours seemed less tiring. The final 1000m was the hardest for me, hard to breathe and you had to concentrate hard to watch where you walk as well as climb up. We got to the top perhaps a little too early. We took a photo and then waited around 20 minutes for the sunrise to start. It is freezing cold at the top so make sure to prepare an extra layer. The skies decided to be very clear for our morning, which was such a relief. The sunrise is absolutely beautiful and really felt surreal. We probably spend a total of 45 minutes at the top before we started to get too cold – you can still see the sunrise as you descend.The descend in general did not feel to challenging. The main source of pain will be the knees. I guess it will feel a lot harder and more painful if you don’t get the sunset. You also get a great breakfast at Laban Rata before climbing all the way to the bottom.Overall, this was an unforgettable experience. I would say it was harder than I expected, especially given the relatively modest difficulty ratings online. If you are in decent shape, you will definitely be able to do it. If anyone has any questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch. Best of luck!"
781,Great day trip,"Take a trip to the national park.  It is absolutely worth the time and cost.  Hike the mountain if you can.  If not, hiking around the park is highly recommended.  Don't fret the leeches.  A little blood...big deal."
782,Beautiful View,Need to be physically prepared for this climb. Make sure you pack light (there are compartments where you can leave your stuff at the base center). If it's the first time you definitely need a guide to check your pace. Enjoy!
783,Nice mountain view,"what can i say... climbing it was a dream come true..the lovely trail, the scenic view, the struggle to reach the top... all of it, i would dearly treasure forever."
784,good,Mount Kinabalu was my first climb and I now know it won't be my last. The mountain pushes your physical and mental endurance but the stunning reward is totally worth it!
785,No Walk in the Park but worth the Very Considerable Effort,"This challenge demands at least 3 months of physical preparation. If you intend to do via Ferata, avoid the Mesilau route as it is not only longer in distance and time taken to complete, but it also takes a toll on the knees as the path descends a few times. The Timpohon route is challenging enough. Also staying at Timpohon is logistically more friendly."
786,Great and tough experience!,"It was too easy to underestimate the climb. Just don't.Great experience all round if you're into hiking.But I just can't believe how some visitors set out on their climb. Some useful tips:- wear proper gear especially proper hiking shoes- be in good fitness condition. Do not underestimate- you will need water and food. You'll be hungry- bring warm clothes and nothing like a good pair of gloves. It is cold up there- it is best if you can have a porter carrying your luggage. You'll enjoy the journey better- you will most likely get wet. Have a poncho handy- get started early in the morning- a good torch is important- get hiking sticks, really helpful- don't rush the climb, breathe. Breathe strongly as you get higher, oherwise, it will be very uncomfortable- bring towel for your shower. There wasn't any left when I got up- bring a pair of slippers. You'll need it in the shower and for walking around in the dorms- the pillows and sheets provided in the dorms I stayed were unclean"
787,nice view and cold place,Make sure you're ready to take this on... it's a steep mountain and the terrain is not all smooth.. don't wear flip flops and bring yourself a bottle of water
788,Don't go just half way,"i have been here for two times. July 2010 and 2014. In 2010,im tottally not prepared well. Im not fit at all.  Our starting point is in Mesilau, quite nice view but bit tired painful n cold.  That time rain n too windy. I use the wrong shoes. In the middle of way ,my shoes can not use anymore n i hv to say goodbye to my adidas running shoes..  But thanks God i bring my crocks..  So i used crocks until i reach the #LabanRata...  I took about 12 hours to reach there.. Im cold, hungry n in pain.. Thts why we need more preparation. Second time i been here on may 2014, i prepared a lot i training everyday and i choose better shoes..  I climb again for second time, the weather was good and this time our starting point was at Timpohon.. But maybe because im too excited,  i forgot to get breakfast and i have gastric my tummy ache all the time... Horrible... My second time also just stay at Laban Rata waiting for my friends back from lows peak.. Sad.. When i can do for thrid time? I duno..i hope i could reach the low's peak soon..."
789,An amazing experience,"joined a group of friends (9 of us) for this trip. I must say I'm not very fit but I made it to the top. I had no experience in hiking whatsoever, no training prior to climbing so if I made it I'm sure everyone else can too.I'm always the last one to reach. to Laban Rata it took me 10am-5pm. didn't sleep at all the night before climbing the peak cos I'm not used to having shared rooms with other people.. it was very noisy. still we all got ready at around 130am. start the hike at about 3am(we were a big group, so it took some time for everyone to get ready). again I was the last in the group, couldn't catch my friends in front cos I had trouble breathing lol for about 10mins. after that it was okay. my guide was with me (not most of the time, he always appeared and disappeared as he pleases lol but I had no time to care). met many people along the way struggling to climb, it will be very nice if you get to encourage each other.I got to the peak at 6am just nice to catch the sunrise- beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. I must say I couldn't believe that I made it this far! stayed there for about 1hr - wear warm clothes.. head torch and GLOVES, MUST! very cold and chilly up there.along the climb up to the peak.. wow just wow. I've never seen such beautiful sky before- full of stars! definitely take some minutes to rest and look up, youll know that this is worth it.as I was going down, tough. the rocks are no fun.. got down at 730 and reached Laban rata for food and check out around 10am.1045am.. back to Timpohon Gate. man I feel sorry for my legs. this was the craziest part, as I took too much effort walking up and down the past hours - I had no energy whatsoever to walk down the stairs. it took me 7hrs of walk to reach. my friends reached at about 3 or so. actually the entire hike up and down I was alone.. it was abit scary and lonely. my guide offered me if I wanted to be carried (with payment of cos) I said no. I'd rather walk on my own.. don't wana embarass myself. so my conclusion is this is worth it, I'm not sure if there's second time for me but for be meantime, I have cramps everywhere - no. if you have the chance, DO IT. it was an experience, it is worth your time.having a good guide is very important too, make sure you have the ones that's always with you to encourage you, unlike mine.. he always complaints that I'm too slow and we will never reach. confidence and determination are essential, make sure you NEVER lose them!"
790,A perfect walk..,"We woke early to clear blue skies on the morning of our climb. We got to park headquarters and the tension was building. After planning and a bit of training and reading other people's experience, it was finally our turn. Mount Kinabalu was looming above us ready for more footprints to be left on its tracks. Many of the blogs I read claimed it was do able for most of reasonable fitness. Running 10k 3x per week I thought this would put me in good stead. You have to attempt this with respect for the challenge, mentally and physically prepared and lots of chocolate in your bag! It was well worth the effort and the aches that came after. The view and scenery was breath taking the whole experience was fantastic and I would recommend to anyone up for the challenge."
791,nice,"love sabah and sabahan people, the most genuine people in the world. The mountain guides are the toughest little buggers ou will ever meet."
792,Unique fauna and natural beauty but be prepared for the climb!,"The millions of steps you have to climb and descend absolutely kill your knees, however it does give you a sense of achievement. The food provided is actually pretty good, sadly not much can be said for the accommodation. Laban Rata is cold with no hot water and one dares not inspect the mattresses too closely. Don't expect a good nights sleep here."
793,Wow-what an achievement!,"We spent almost an entire month adamant that we weren't going to climb mt Kinabalu due to the costs, which are undoubtedly excessive, but then if you have tried to organise any kind of excursion or tour in Sabah then you will know already that everything is expensive! Actually, compared with some other things we wanted to do but were priced out of (Maliau Basin, Salt Trail etc) this ended up seeming decent value for money at 1335 ringitt per person through 'River Junkie' tours as part of a flash sale. I mean, at least we got a bed and five meals included in this right? Meals were excellent too by the way, and to all complaining about being charged for water at Laban Rata, if you had simply asked you would have been pointed to free filtered water dispensers in the adjoining building...Another facepalm is people complaining about the 'corridor of trees' most of the way up, and a lack of viewpoints... It's a climb through dense forest, it's part of the mountain, what do you expect? Should they cut the trees down so you can have a prettier view on the way up? Even though you get plenty of mind blowing views further up? Oh and the stairs aren't uniform enough for some i see... This is a very, very well constructed and maintained path. You are almost spoilt in fact by how easy they have made this ascent! Anyone that has done any kind of fell walking or mountain trekking will find this climb a breeze, and also the descent. If the porters can manage with some of the insane weight they carry then i think you can manage to negotiate a slightly high or uneven step every once in a while...So is it worth it? I thought it was ace, so i'd say yes. It IS still expensive for what it is, but you will end up doing absolutely nothing in Borneo if you are unwilling to splash out a little. It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip, and a rewarding experience that i'll remember for a long time. Thought i'd got away with the sore legs too but i'm suffering now, 2 days after coming down haha...On a last note, don't underestimate the altitude! Go slow and steady, several people went green before the summit and i myself developed a headache with the occasional moments of dizzyness. Altitude sickness is apparently quite common on this ascent, especially if you live at sea level, as there is no acclimatization period! Staying hydrated helps."
794,1st climbing trip,"It's hard! And we are relatively experienced hikers! You need to be fit and well prepared. Essential items:Head torchWaterproof jacket and trousersChange of clothesFleece/jumperHat, scarf, clothesThermal topSnacksDecent walking shoes/bootsMedicationFlip flops (for overnight stay)Dry bagRucksack coverWe did the two day hike. On the first day we were allocated our guide Frederick, who was excellent, through Amazing Borneo. The 6km hike to Laban Rata is an unrelenting climb, going up 1450m, although the path is not technically challenging. Frequent huts and loos are located along the path. Day 2 is the real challenge. The remaining 900m of ascent happen over 2.7km, so it's very steep and as we set out at 2.30am it's also very dark! Lots of it is roped and in some places there is no way to get up without hauling yourself up the rope. At this point you can also feel the effects of the altitude, getting your breath back is very difficult and your heart never stops pounding. The top is freezing cold so if you stop for any length of time you will need extra layers. We made it up there for the sunrise but many people didn't and even 70-80% make the summit at all. The descent with the rope is harder than the way up as you can see the sheer rock face you are walking on! It can be very slippy so decent shoes are a must and closely follow your guide as they know the best routes. Descending the whole mountain in half a day knackers your legs, we can still feel the effects a week later so don't plan to do anything too strenuous in the days after! Overall, it is a brilliant experience but don't expect it to be a walk in the park and you have to be mentally tough to make it to the peak and back!"
795,Only one way to the top!,"Climbing Mount Kinabalu is definitely one of the best things that i've done in my life! No joke, those 2 days are one of the most tiring days of my life ever...The view at the summit is really picturesque! Worth every single drop of sweat and muscle ache! And the sense of accomplishment is really awesome! I would say training is required though. A certain level of fitness is essential as it’s really not easy! It’s basically like climbing stairs non stop for at least 6-8 hours, and then another 3-4 hours climb to the summit. Training by climbing stairs with 5-7kg weights at least 2 months prior would be really useful for preparing for this trip!For us, we chose to rent the walking stick..really glad that we did so! It really helped to take pressure off the knees, especially when descending the mountain. Oh also, don’t forget your sunblock! The sun there is merciless! Actually you can find our full honest experience on climbing Mt Kinabalu on our website below. We’ve included plenty of useful tips for keen trekkers too! And not forgetting the amazing photos that we took while climbing! Enjoy!http://sunriseodyssey.com/experience-climbing-mount-kinabalu"
796,Stunning Flora and Fauna,The local guides will try to sell you a mountain/hot springs trip. Tell them no to the hot springs. It will be the most disappointing 4 hours of your trip. The mountain is great but get there early. The amount of trash throughout the day will be very disappointing for an ecological world heritage site. I have traveled all over Asia and have never seen so much trash everywhere.
797,To The Top of The World,"Mount Kinabalu is truly a marvel. I could spend months exploring just this mountain and if I hit the Lottery big I wouldn't hesitate to move very near byOrchids, wildlife, magnificent views, random waterfalls.   That is the Eden partThe hell part is if you do the climb   Its one of the  most rewarding things i have done but don't let them lie to you. It is not a vigorous hike.  It is a mountain climb.  Its tough.  It hurts.  Its the world's 20th highest mountainAnd I would return in a heartbeatAnd"
798,Train up before heading here!,"I booked with a local tour company (mttrails) who were very good and organised. They picked me up at the hotel in KK and got us to the mountain the night before hiking.I'd prepared with some emergency running and walking up office block stairs, but in all truth I was not as fit as usual. As such the walk was harder than I thought. Took 4 hours to get to the Pendant Hut. It had been raining pretty hard early in the morning and during the hike. But we were in good spirits so no worries. On the way up we chatted with groups going down. 2 items, the weather had denied the majority of people getting up and 2 it was freezing up at the huts. So with that in mind hot water filled drinking bottles were employed which worked well. But if you're stuff got wet on the way up it didn't dry out. A vision is the laban rata hut full of people wearing beanies/blankets etc. Some ill prepared people without spare clothes and plastic bags/bag liners would have suffered.Pretty much from 3pm onwards the rain began ""properly""!! The previous rain was nothing in hindsight. Anyway with that and the wind it was obvious the summit was off. So up at 2am, some toast and tea, then back to bed until 8am. Hiked down in full rain, watching people hiking up with no spare clothes! Anyway my main takeaway is that it is not clear (and I suspect intentionally) how often the summit is off limits. If you hike to the huts then there is no cancellation refund on bookings I'm thinking Via Ferrata here. Anyway still worth the risk, but carry stuff with you and wrap it in plastic etc. to keep it dry. I bought an emergency poncho for 5 ringitt or so at the timphon gate. Was worth a heck of a lot more."
799,2Day1Night Climb of Mount Kinabalu,"My girlfriend and I wanted to climb mount kinabalu in June 2016 and were in Kota Kinabalu trying to find the best deals to do it. Our budget was good, but even then which is the supposed off season we found the prices of the tour groups to be far greater than we had imagined. 1,100 Malaysian Ringitt each was the cheapest we could find. But we were quoted in some places near 2,000 per person. GOOD NEWS. I essentially said to our hostel who were trying to help us that we wouldn't be able to do it at those prices but really wanted to do it and the woman reluctantly but kindly said that we could 'try' and turn up and book them at the base of Mount Kinabalu through the park office. We decided to try it and turned up the day before we wanted to climb (2D1N), we went straight to the park office and booked a guide, the park permits, accomodation on the mountain (including meals) for around 550 Malaysian Ringitt each. What's best is this price can go further down if you decided to share the price of the guide with others. There were only two of us and we decided we'd prefer that so we could go at our own pace and even though the weather was on and off, it was clear enough for us to be able to summit. Just doing this saved us anything between 1,000 to 3,000 Malaysian Ringitt.The impression was given that there are a few spaces available to those who have the extra time to go or who are tempted to risk it. Our guide said that there were about 100 people trying to summit when we went up and we were told they only hand out 125 permits a day. Although it did seem dubious as the tourist industry (tour groups) don't seem all too helpful or moveable. It felt like it benefitted all included in KK tourism for this not to be known. Obviously you need to be aware that there is a potential time risk for this, but the financial benefits can be huge so if you have an open time frame then, especially in the off season I'd recommend it. Spaces can be made available near the time too due to people pulling out and illness.WHERE TO STAYWe stayed at Dvil'a Rina Ria lodge. Staff were friendly and they have a dorm and reasonably priced private rooms with ensuite shower too, we had breakfast included. A private double bedroom was 120 RM for two which was cheap for the area and better standard of rooms. They also have a food menu. Portions vary in quality and size. This isn't luxury if you're like the finer things in life, but ideal for setting up base camp for the night and to rest after climbing up and down the mountain. Will do practical travellers nicely. Wifi is available and good but only in dining/communal area. You can at times buy clothes in D'vila Rina Ria lodge which is one of the hostels by the entrance of the national park. They had gloves, beanie hats, torches and trousers all well supplied when there, although I wouldn't rest on this laurel. In terms of getting there, you can get a small bus which takes you to the entrance of the park (and within walking distance of the nearby hostels) from Kota Kinabalu quite easily and for a good price too. ONWARD TRAVELBuses go from the base of the mountain near one of the hostels to Semporna too from outside D'vila Rina Ria Lodge. Or from outside the park entrance, minivan buses do go back to Kota Kinabalu."
800,Incredible experience,"We arrived to Kota Kinabalu with the intention of climbing Mt Kinabalu but had not prebooked a tour. We did a bit of research (the hotel tour desk was rubbish) and enquired at a few places. The prices seemed to be fairly consistent when you looked at what one company offered over the other with a lower price. We chose to go with Amazing Borneo with a view to book the via ferrata once we arrived at the hut. The Amazing Borneo transfer picked us up right on time (arrived 5mins early) and took us to the first checkpoint where we met our guide. Lunch packs and tags given, and we got onto another van to take us to the start gate. Hiring walking poles is about RM10/stick. The terrain is fairly standard to start with with some uneven steps and rocks along a worn trail. The weather wasn't great but it's steep all the way up with few downhill or flat parts.  Be warned - just because it's a 2 day hike doesn't mean it's easy!! I had been traveling for the 2nd 1/2 of last year and had climbed Mt Kilimanjaro and Meru, but my drop in fitness and the weather meant I enjoyed this trek much less! It's doable and I certainly wasn't the slowest, but it's just less enjoyable when you are struggling. Also, if you are looking at doing the via ferrata, wait until you get to Pendant Hut before booking as we couldn't prebook (booked out apparently) but were able to get a spot once we arrived for the briefing. The weather turned bad on summit day and they cancelled due to bad weather so we got our money back, but the people who had prebooked did not qualify for a refund. It was a nice surprise for us.Amazing Borneo were a great company to book through - we had all transfers, all meals while on the mountain and a buffet lunch at the end, and a nice certificate to prove we had done it! The guides were great - very very patient. They do walk behind you, but the terrain isn't too hard to navigate - they'"
801,"Not easy, unless you're a porter/guide","It's an expensive decision to climb Mt. Kinabalu for a budget traveler. But the right one. The climb:I'm in reasonable shape, a heavy smoker though, without any prior 'climbing' experience - in brackets because you shouldn't expect to actually climb. It was challenging and I had sore legs for a day or two, but if you can handle the altitude and have stamina you'll definitely be able to do it. If you choose the two-day-trip, which I recommend, the first day is a 3 to 5 hour walk on paths from flat and easy to steep and over rocks to Laban Rata: the 'base camp'. They didn't have hot water there so expect to skip your daily shower. On the second day you start early at about 02:00 am to reach the summit before sunset. Leaving even earlier is a good idea because there is not much space at the summit and it fills up quickly. I guess there were about 100 to 120 people 'climbing' with me that day. Slightly worried by the crowd I started to go faster and faster and finally reached the summit at first and had it all to myself for about 15 minutes. A beautiful yet somehow scary experience. It's freezing cold, windy and dark up there, so be prepared (hat, gloves, jacket, face mask, torch light). Wear your clothes in layers, when I went back down from the summit the temperature rose from freezing to extremely hot, so I took off my clothes piece by piece. By the way: The view on the way down is breathtaking.The planning and costs:Long story short: I finally decided not to book via travel agency or the Sutera Website (which wasn't possible on short notice anyway) and just showed up at the Sutera Office in Kota Kinabalu. They had accommodation for the next day and compared to what other people told me I got away quite cheap. I think it was about 750 Ringgit for everything (including snacks, transport etc.). Of course that's only an option if you're flexible (in my case an euphemism for 'unprepared') and willing to take the risk of having to cancel your precious climbing plans.If you're arriving from KK and want to start your climb on the same day make sure to leave early. The minivans only 'leave when full' and full is up for interpretation. It took one hour and a 'bribe' to convince the driver to leave. Or take a taxi."
802,Spectacular view!,"Ah yeah, so this was SO much more difficult than we expected it to be!This was the most difficult physical activity we have ever done in our lives.We each go to the gym 5-6 times a week so moderately fit. This was not enough preparation!You have to climb thousands of steps and rocks in a short period of time and covering a lot of distance and height - and it's hot. I had a sinus infection which didn't help and I do not recommend climbing a mountain with a sinus infection! Anyway, it was hard... so hard.We finally got to the huts. We signed on for the via ferrata so hat to walk up another hundred steps to get to our gut. We were told there was solar hot water showers but the couple before us had long showers so we had icey cold showers... wasn't expecting hot water so not overly disappointing.The via ferrata lodging was pretty basic. Haven't slept in a dorm room since my back packing days but the people in our room were really quiet and more ""mature"" so it was fine.The food for dinner was pretty good and there was plenty of choice. You could look down on the clouds from the restaurant which was beautiful.The next day we woke up at 1:30amto head to the summit - oh my god, it went on forever! You could see head torches in the distance and it looked miles and miles away... and it was freezing!! Dress warm and with layers. So bloody windy too.The sun was coming up at the summit which was beautiful. When you get to the summit you literally have to climb up rocks with your hands and queue for a photo with the sign - not at all what we expected but we were so happy to be there. And with no altitude sickness (people were being sick up the top)!Coming down was still super cold and windy but with beautiful views. You almost have to abseil at some points but fairly easy coming back to the huts. It rained hard the night before so was quite slippery though.You stop for breakfast, pack up your stuff then head down the mountain... you think that will be easier but no - not easier - super tough and your legs give way. It does get easier mentally though!There's a big lunch set up at the HQ when you finish but we just wanted to get to our hotel and have a bath so left straight away.We did our climb with Amazing Borneo and our guide was Joe - both great experiences.Be prepared that you won't be able to walk properly for three days after. The positives: beautiful scenery and you have the satisfaction of having climbed a massive mountain!"
803,MK Park,"Since this was one of our highlights in our trip to Borneo, we booked our climb through Borneo Trails in advance and got ourselves geared up for this climb.  However, it was pretty easier than we thought. This mountain is recommendable for any of my friends, I'd like to praise the governmental body to maintain this trail very well. But, the pain in the butt is that it's bit pricey for budget travelers like us! Fortunately, we were able to find good deal in our research, but we encountered many tourists who paid much more than what we paid for this climb. I hope this mountain will be improved in price and open for any climbers including budget travelers in future!"
804,Beautiful scenery,"If you are reasonably fit and/or want a challenge then this is the best reason to visit KK.  It's about a 90 min drive from town to the park HQ.  We did the two day trip ( the 3 day trip is unnecessary in my opinion) so were picked up at 6am from our hotel by Amazing Borneo tours.  At 830 we met our guide Rony (an absolute superstar) and were driven to the starting point.  We surprised ourselves and made it  to Laban Rata in 4 hours (I'm 37 and of questionable fitness).  I have to say that the accommodation there is appalling, but we were up at 230am and ready to go.  It got congested for the first part out of Laban Rata but we motored past people and were at the summit for 530am and the sunrise.  It was AMAZING.  The journey back to Laban Rata took 90mins and after breakfast it was another 3 hours to reach the starting point.The next day our legs ached.  2 days later they were agony!!!  But it was worth the pain."
805,"Very tough, incredibly rewarding!","While most visitors of Kinabalu Park are coming to climb the mountain, the park itself is excellent place to hike in tropical rainforest. There are plenty of trails available from couple of hours hike to whole day - if you want to hike most of trails around the park you will need at least two days. Due to its high elevation, it is significantly cooler than at Kota Kinabalu, especially after rain which brings additional pleasure point.Number of trails are soaked with water and this is the case after rain - you need to wear appropriate footwear and not sandals."
806,It ain't Nepal!,"About Mt.Kinabalu climbing, you'll find lots of good information in internet. I'd like to talk about it little like participating in a marathon. 1. Plan early. Number of climbers allowed to Mt.Kinabalu is limited per day. When you start planning, what you have to do first is checking the availability of the climbing package on the intended schedule. If possible, it's better to avoid peak holiday period so that you may have better flights and accommodations reasonably. (We are 4 person aged 48-61.) I'd like to recommend to stay accommodation nearby Timpohon Gate before the climbing day. It should be good to avoid altitude sickness, it's cooler and you can sleep till late. Also, you can enjoy good view of Mt.Kinabalu in the morning. By the way, there are many discussions about the climbing packages price. In my opinion as a working person, you may just choose a well-known tour operator. The difference of package price among operators is not big compared to flights and accommodations. (We also don't know how to appreciate the price difference among such packages, anyway.) 2. Sustain your interest and prepare well. You need enough physical and mental strength. If you have more, you'll enjoy more. Try to keep your body fit especially in cardio and legs before going. 3. Bring minimum equipment, however, wear familiar shoes with good grip. You can buy even essential equipment like gloves, torchlight or simple raincoat at Laban Rata Lodge. (You should bring some cash.) But, a pair of good shoes is necessary on the rocky stretch. 4. Start in slower pace. Please start climbing slower than the pace that you think of. It's a long way, and, higher you go, steeper the path becomes, thinner the oxygen is. 5. Replenish before feeling thirsty and hungry. It's like a marathon. Try to keep your energy and condition well not to exhaust. 6. Plan to keep some energy to enjoy descending, too. In the popular 2-3days packages, after getting up at 2am to summit, you can't rest till 4pm except 2hours rest at Laban Rata lodge area. People gets injured during descending due to low-concentration, shaky tired legs and falling down. We saw few rangers carried such injured middle-older aged climbers. Enjoy the wonderful scenery and the accomplishment. === I'd like to recommend the package of Amazing Borneo Tours. The price might not be the lowest among many packages, but, their website and operating procedures seem to be highly reliable. Both Sales staff and Mountain Guide are nice. Everyone, have a good Kinabalu climbing. That's good! You gotta go when you can!"
807,Spectacular Views,"""One step at a time"". I recited this line for like a million times when I was on my way to Laban Rata. I was with a friend plus 2 more amateur climbers (first time to climb a mountain). We had to take a package from an agency in Kota Kinabalu because if you don't, you might not have any accomodations when you get to Laban Rata.We had to pay 820 RM/each for a 2day-1night climb inclusive of 5meals, bunk bed, guide, insurance & certificate. So far, the agency that we hired had the best package rate.We started the climb past 10 in the morning.  I did not  not really prepare for the climb and I underestimated the mountain. My bad! I had difficulty breathing while climbing and had to stop for a break like a thousand times. Good thing there were a lot of huts along the way where you can rest or eat and chat with  other climbers. We got to Laban Rata past 5pm.We were starving so we went straight to the buffet! The best buffet I ever had at 13000ft.The Sabah tea & coffee was also really addictive. I can't get enough of it. While the rest of the group went to their rooms since we are in for an early start the next day, we stayed at the dining hall just talking & drinking tea & coffee. When we went out past 6pm, it was really dark outside. We did regret staying too long in the dining hall since our accomodations were at Gunting Lagadan - 500meters or so from Laban Rata. We climbed guided by the light of our headlamps and the evening stars. Quite romantic though. Since we got in last, we had the top bunks. I had a hard time sleeping because when I move, the bunk bed would squeak and the room was a bit hot. Past 2am, we woke up to the sound of chaos. Everybody was packing up for the climb to the summit. I can barely move. I had to take pain reliever. We went down to the dining hall to have our breakfast. The ascend felt like going up a never-ending flight of stairs to heaven. I almost gave up. Whenever I felt like quitting, I'd stop & look at the clouds which was beneath me now & turn off my headlamp so I can also see all the stars. It was inspiring and gave me that extra energy to keep up with the rest of the climbers. There was also this part where you had to climb with ropes. In the dark, you can't see how dangerous it is. But you are actually climbing the side of the mountain where a fall is fatal and would cost you, your dear life.I did not suffer from any AMS. I just had difficluty breathing and walking. After like 2 steps, I'd rest. That's how diffucult it was for me. At KM 8, I stopped. I wanted to get to the peak.To reach the summit. The mind was really willing. But the body was not. I may not have the energy to go down if I used it all up to get to the peak. Plus, I might be the only one left in the summit since I got there last. I just took pictures of the south peak & the different stone formations - donkey ears, etc.  The climb down was much EASIER! It took me 2 hours to get to Laban Rata to have my breakfast. At past 10 in the morning, we started our descend to Kinabalu Headquarters. Contrary to my ascend, I only had 2 stops. I was looking forward to that buffet waiting at the headquarters.Took me a total of 3hours to reach KM 0. When I got my certificate printed in black & white, I was a bit disappointed with myself. I got have been given a colored certficate.LOL.Overall, it was one hell of a climb but worht it! I am happy I was able to do it this year &  I don't mind doing it again sometime in the future."
808,Mountain was good skip the hot springs,"TRAVELLOR BEWARE!  Traveller beware when booking directly! If you choose to book directly to climb this spectacular mountain (highest in SE Asia) you should beware of some pitfalls.  I decided to book directly some 12 months in advance of a three week holiday to Peninsular Malaysia including the eastern Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.  Key to visiting Sabah was an attempt on climbing the mountain.  I understand that the mountain park is owned by the Sabah government who are responsible for the park management, but that all food and accommodation facilities in the park are owned and managed by ‘Sutera Sancturay Lodges’ a private company based in the Sabah capital who hold a monopoly on food and accommodation within the Kinabalu National park.   There is a formal liaison between the Park management and the hotel group in that a permit is required to climb the mountain that will not be issued without a firm booking reference from Sutera Sanctuary Lodges for accommodation at their Laban Ratan facility just below the final ascent location.  The National Park maintain and police all routes up the mountain and provide official guides that must be booked on the day of your climb to accompany climbers. (This is necessary following several fatalities in past decades).   The Sutera Sanctuary Lodges also provide an expensive accommodation facility just within the entrance to National Park as well as running a large buffet restaurant within the park entrance complex.  This lower level accommodation is not essential to climbers but is half the cost of the required and monopolist Laban Ratan accommodation facility. The high cost for the one star Laban Ratan facility includes for a packed lunch on the day of your climb and meal vouchers at Laban Ratan and at the entrance restaurant following your descent.  I established that the Sutera Sanctuary Lodges booking facility for 2015 bookings would not be open prior to an unspecified date in September 2014. I duly applied again in September 2014 for accommodation for both the night before my scheduled climb in April 2015 on and the night at Laban Ratan on the day of the climb.  In due course I was given a firm booking subject to Sutera receiving from me a credit card withdrawal authorisation form (they had emailed to me).  I duly completed the form and posted it recorded delivery well in advance of the Sutera Sanctuary automatic cancelation date if they haven’t received payment.  When challenged they subsequently confirmed receipt of my authorisation form duly completed.  However when we arrived the day before our scheduled climb we found to our consternation that our booking had been cancelled without notice.   The young local staff had no idea why and contacted the Sutera official with whom I had made the firm booking several months before.  Her response was that she had received my authorisation form but that the deposit monies for whatever reason had not appeared in their accounts (and indeed they had not been withdrawn from my account which I had not noticed) and that she had consequently cancelled my booking.  The same credit card was successfully used by other international businesses at that time for deposits/ advanced payment on other hotel bookings (and all collectively well within my credit limit).  When I protested to the official that she had not emailed to tell me of any deposit payment difficulty nor that they had cancelled my firm booking, she calmly replied that they didn’t consider it to their responsibility to inform customers of any payment difficulty (or of any failure on their part to apply for deposit credit payments) nor to notify customers of any booking cancellation they might subsequently make.  We are supposed to inform ourselves! The problem I surmise is that they are a monopoly and demand to climb the mountain is very high.  This private company must make huge profits from this lucrative tourist attraction but have not reinvested much to improving their very poor facility. I had to reschule my climb which mant cancelling a trip to Sarwak. And in a separate Trip Advisor review I cover the one star and low hygiene facilities that Sutera Sanctuary Lodges provide at Laban Ratan and in the restaurant at the base of this spectacular mountain.  It is a pity that the Sabah government has done nothing yet to break the Sutera Sanctuary monopoly."
809,Gorgeous sight,"This mountain is undescripable. You have to experience this for your self. There are so many species of orchids and plants that only grow here. The sounds and smells of the forest is amazing. I Wish we had been able to hike all the way to the top. The trip to the top is only a two day hike, but I had my six year old son with me, so I'll have to do it next time Im around."
810,A hike to the limit.,Anyone can do it as long as you have either the fitness or willpower to overcome the muscle soreness. It was a life-time experience to see the sunrise at the summit.listen to your guide who could really provide good advice for your climb easier.
811,"If Johanna can, so can you!","Like many reviewers have stated, you must be fit and know your limitations when making this climb.  I won't reiterate how awesome this is but it is a once in a lifetime event!  Let me give you a few tips we wished we had known.  DO NOT climb the same day as you were at sea level.  I repeat do not....stay closer to the Mount the day before you climb.  The reason for this is that your body has a chance to adjust to the different altitudes and you won't feel so exhausted.  Listen to your guide.  Our guide suggested we leave earlier in the morning than regular because we were slow climbers.  Beware of altitude sickness.  I wish I would have had something for it or a scopolamine patch, it would have made it much easier.  ABOVE ALL DO NOT GIVE YOUR PACKS WITH YOUR WATER AND SPARE BATTERIES TO THE FITTEST PERSON TO CARRY!!! That person may go ahead so they can get pictures of the sunrise for the rest of us and then you realize you have to climb in the dark because your flashlight batteries have died and the person with all the stuff is climbing ahead!  Be sure to dress in layers and bring a HIGH QUALITY raincoat...remember it is a rainforest."
812,Lovely views,"Yes, you're going to be tired and sore and exhausted and maybe even cold, but the hike to Low's Peak is definitely worth it. The view is absolutely stunning - no picture does it justice. But do try to figure out if you're sensitive to high altitudes before the hike if you have a chance. Even very fit individuals had to stay at the lodge or head down because they began to get headaches or felt nauseous.Oh, and in case anyone is wondering, there are bathrooms and potable water stations along the way. The bathrooms tend to lack toilet paper, so try to bring some tissues with you. And the water comes from the mountain, which weirds some people out, but I drank it the whole way down and felt fine."
813,Worth the Experience,"This was to be a highlight of our one month trip to Borneo, but in reality it was a big let down. I'd done loads of research and as an experienced trekker and  mountaineer I was really excited by the prospect of climbing this great mountain. Despite the high cost I thought it would be worth it. I was wrong! Our guide was a waste of time. In fact he barely even walked with us. There are so many people on the trail too, so it feels like walking down a high street. It pretty much is non stop steps all the way to laban rata, so if you like climbing stairs for 3 or 4 hours then you may enjoy it. After a sleep we got up at 2.30am for breakfast and a leave time of 3.30am for final ascent. It had been raining a lot through the night and so we we eventually picked up from our guide that we may not be able to go up. The lodge was chaotic, with no clear communication. Some groups left, only to return later. We went back to bed when it became clear it wasn't happening, though there were mixed messages told to various people that we may be able to try later. At 6.30am we got up to clear blue skys. Many of us thought we were on for the ascent, but after 2 hours if poor communication and mixed messages, we eventually headed back down the mountain. As someone who has climbed a lot of mountains I would say Mount Kibabalu is a poor experience, over-priced, awful guides, no communication and to top it off endless steps up over crowded trails. There are so many great mountains in the world I will not be returning to Mount Kinabalu!!!"
814,climbing Mount Kinabalu in one day,"Mt Kinabalu National Park has a number of walking trails into the forest-areas where you are literally completely surrounded by thick foliage and vegetation, accompanied with various jungle sounds and noises to give you the exact experience of being deep inside the Borneo rainforest. The variety of the trees and foliage is a treat to see. In fact, walking so deep inside can get a bit creepy for city-folks who are totally unaccustomed to the jungle sounds. That is exactly why its recommended. The park itself is well-maintained and has all facilities. If you take a day-long package tour, then your transport is taken care of. If you travel by yourself from KK, take a KK-Ranau bus from Merdeka bus stand (every hour), its about 2 hours to the National park stop. While returning, flag down a Ranau-KK bus from the opposite side of the road, but remember these buses run till 3 pm or so. Overall, a highly recommended sightseeing spot"
815,Hard but wort it!,"As soon as we got off our plane from Brunei the first question we were asked was ""Did you see the mountain?"".....no Dude....it was dark......lot's of local pride.....to us it was just another mountain....."
816,Simply amazing! Well worth the effort!,"When hiking this mountain, you definitely must train for it, especially if you are over 30 years old and don't do strenuous exercise regularly. Going up steps is a good form of training for this hike. The actual ascent is about 2300 meters. Most ordinary hikers would do this hike over 2 days. Day 1 - start the hike at around 10AM and reach the mountain hut by around 3PM-4PM. When you get to the mountain hut, take a rest, have dinner, at the restaurant which serves buffet style. We had been here 2 times and found the food to be very good. I say this is because we were hungry from the climb and the plentiful of fresh mountain air. Dinner is served quite early, around 5PM. After dinner, you would want to try to sleep because you would set off for the summit by around 1AM-2AM.  Day 2 (1AM) The hut operator would feed you some light refreshment before setting off. It takes around 4 hours to reach the summit, in time for the sunrise. All these if the high altitude and the thin air has not affected you. During our first climb, we had very strong wind and made the summit very cold and we couldn't stay too long at the summit. The clouds kept blowing into us, obstructing the views most of the time. However, our 2nd time up the mountain, some 3 years later, we were really rewarded with a clear and calm morning, no wind and we could even see all the way to Kota Kinabalu. The clear morning despite pouring rain when we hiked up from the gate to the hut and arrived at the hut completely drenched. After the excitement of going to the peak, you then want to get down to the hut for your breakfast. We reached the hut at 10AM in time for the last batch of breakfast because other hikers had returned earlier than us. After breakfast we then packed our bag and started the descent by 11.30AM. As we have a friend who was very slow, most people are not good coming down mountains, we did not reach the gate of the national park until about 5PM. Very tiring but well worth it. There are some strange looking plants and trees up there and the stone and rocks of Mount Kinabalu are just stunning and spectacular and the feeling of being on top of the world and God's creation down below you made the hike an exhilarating one."
817,Tough climb but great satisfaction!,"My wife and I climbed Mount Kinabalu whilst on our honeymoon in Sabah. We booked our tour through AmazingBorneo.com. The whole experience from start to finish was fantastic. The climb itself isn't overly difficult to start with, just steep. You spend the first day climbing from Timphon Gate to Laban Rata lodge; it's around 6/6.5km and consists mainly stair climbing. The day starts at about 0830 with most people finishing at 1400. It's a very social route as there's another 100 or so people climbing per day. There's a rest stop every KM complete with toilet and seating. There's a shop at the start and at Laban Rata so there's plenty of opportunities to get snacks and drinking water. We had a guide, Fredney, who was absolutely fantastic; ensuring our safety and providing us with little snippets of knowledge al the way up. On the second day you do the 2.7km climb to the summit. This is the tough part. You start at 0230 so it's pitch black (a blessing in disguise), and you spend a lot of time climbing with ropes. Plenty of rest stops along the way again so not to worry. The aim is to reach the summit before sun rise (0540 for us) so there's plenty of time. When you eventually get to the top it's absolutely sensational. You can see for miles, and the views are akin to what I imagine being on the moon is like. You tend to stop for photos for about an hour at the top, and then you start the climb down, which in total takes 5-6 hours in itself.All in all the experience is incredible. It's not overly physical, but it takes a lot of determination to get through. It's absolutely worth it when you get to the top though. Absolutely beautiful."
818,Mt Kinabalu,"The price for locals is different from foreigners. Government cheaper tickets always seem sold out but private operators always have it. If booked via tour operator they will pick u from your hotel between 6 to 6:30 and bring you to the registration point by 08:00. Once formalities over you should get a card which u carry on your outside at all times and the ascent day 1 to laban rata starts around 0900. If u are good at climbing stairs ( man made or rocks, it is step after step ) you can do this 6kms hike where we gain approx 1.4kms elevation. People do it anything from 4-6hrs. @ laban rata you would get supper from 16:30. Post supper time to clean , repack and sleep as day 2 ascent starts at 02:00am. This section is approx gain in evevation of 700m over 2.7kms. First section is again stairs ( difficult) and last section ( last kms) is inclined rock face. Summit beauty with sun rise is amazing. Descent on day 2 is full 8.7kms down with a stop over at laban rata for breakfast and checkout. Coming down the stairs for so long need some exercised quads. Best of luck"
819,Kinabalu Park,"We didn't book ahead, so we had to pay a lot more and we had to do it in a single day which was extremely hard work and to be honest I wouldn't want to do it again like that. Imagine climbing 9 km of stairs, and that's basically what your doing. It was pretty cloudy at the top, but you could still some amazing views and it was completely worth the effort, I would recommend booking well in advance for a better price and also so you can stay in the lodge overnight and spread the climb over two days."
820,Just go! You will be sore but it's worth it.,"Mt Kinabalu has a beautiful and varied landscape. Near timpohon gate there is lush jungle, which shortens to small bushes higher up with a sprinkling of pitcher plants that get larger up through 3,000m, and then more conifers near the top before switching to sheer rock face and mosses. The 1000m climb on day 1 is straightfoward, while the second 1000m climb in the dark on day 2 we found very difficult in part because of the thinness of the air and in part because of the ropes and scrambling, which are even scarier on the way down. We were extremely lucky to have an almost cloudless sunrise, with the exception of the smaller puffy clouds that lie quite a bit below the summit and made the view more beautiful without obstructing it – we could see down into the valleys 3,000m below, The night at the hostel is not much fun – the rooms are miniscule, crowded, stuffy, and ours had mold all over the walls and ceiling. I suppose you could shower but given how cold it is at 3300m and that the ice cold water isn’t heated, I’m not sure why you’d bother. The food was pretty good though."
821,"Great experience, fantastic view!","There seems to be a monopoly on climbing the mountain- only one official company is permitted to lead people up the mountain, and it's pretty overpriced for such a short trek (you can climb the mountain in 2 days, to the top and back). Its beautiful though."
822,Nice place ever,most of the focus around the park is to climb to the summit. however there are a number of excellent hiking trails around the headquarters that do deserve attention
823,Awesome,"at mesilau nature resort at the foot of the mount kinabalu. here everything is nice from the weather to the rooms. food is good and not short of choices. the surrounding nature is almost perfect except for some rubbish that has been haphazardly thrown by some unscrupulous visitors.  the directional signs are not very clear and when you need to call the resort, the broadband is out!  it was a terrifying experience in the depths of the jungle especially when you self drive and think arriving in the evenings are good? when it is dark, it is definitely dark. remember to arrive there before noon if you self drive and the roads and direction, minus the signs, are obviously thinkable. all in all, it is a highly recommended destination for a quiet and refreshing stay, an excellent breather away from the polluted cities. being a resort and tourist destination, one small comment is that the tourist destinations around the vicinity should be open throughout the week rather than closing on fridays for religious reasons and half days on saturdasy and full off or rest days on sundays does not make good for such an excellent destination. give it some thought and tourists will come in abundance if such matters are well taken care off."
824,World's Highest Via Ferrata on Mount Kinabalu,"The climb to summit is divided into 2 stages, from its park to Laban Rata & Laban Rata to summit. The stage 2 journey starts around 0230 in time to reach the summit just before sunrise.  Early reservation & fitness training is a must before you embark on the challenge."
825,Mount Kinabalu/Poring Springs Tour,"The mention of Mount Kinabalu conjures up different images for different people. The highest peak in South East Asia, she stands tall and majestic like a proud Governess overlooking the inhabitants and visitors in the 'land below the winds', Sabah. Due to her history and magnanimity, Kinabalu Park is protected as a World Heritage Site. My trek up this mountain was in April 2014 with a group of cross-cultural climbers. Malaysians, German, Singaporeans, Vietnamese, Indonesians.....after months of training we were all psyched up to do the climb of our lives.The 2D1N adventure started off on a great note. I was definitely on an adrenalin rush and it kept me going on the 1st day en route the Mersilau scenic path. Our group of 10 started to slowly disintegrate and before I knew it I was all alone with no guides and trekkies in sight. I got abit scared as I peered down to the deep chasm just beside the wooden walkway.I walked a good 30 minutes all by myself and it was a very surreal experience. Surrounded by the cool embrace of Mother Nature, and guided by the spirits of Mount Kinabalu along the way. I bumped into a local guide and he was kind enough to accompany me and spur me whenever I felt like giving up.The trek up, reaching the summit and trek down was like a reflection of my life. Bursting with limitless possibilities at the start, but along the way get sidetracked and sometimes stumble from challenges, distractions and sudden curve balls. I persevere, I feel like giving up, I get motivators, I get distracted, I curse myself for putting my body through this physical torture, I break into ecstasy upon reaching the summit, I lose all sensation of my body after the descend.....The recent quake that hit Sabah was scary. Was it force majeure or something else?I pray that climbers of the past, present and future will continue to honor this great dame of Sabah. Tread carefully around her crevices, respect her weathered surface.....and thank her for her protection and guidance."
826,Im not a hiker so it was tough but such an amazing experience - worth the sore muscles!,"The most difficult thing about Mt. Kinabalu is booking the Laban Rata accommodation before you leave!  I coudn't believe how hard they make it online to book direct.  I recommend email the Sutera Sanctury Lodges directly (the people who own Laban Rata Resthouse on the mountain) and get a quote directly from them.  That's what we did and when we had paid all the little bits (guide, park entrance fee, accommodation, meals etc) it came to roughly £120 each which I think is around 610RM.  Try this email address - reservations@suteraharbour.com.myThe whole trekking experience was really good and you get chatting on the way up and down to other people.  We were lucky as we met some great people who we then hung out with when we got to Laban Rata!Top tip is bring a pack of cards or something light so you can have some entertainment at Laban Rata when you arrive because on the first day of the trek you leave the base around 9:30am and then arrive at Laban Rata approx 1-2pm.  They serve you dinner at 4:30pm - 7pm and apart from drinking tea and coffee and chatting there isn't anything to do.  It is also unfortunate that the showers are cold, which is not what you fancy when you are already cold when you get there!  Also, believe what they say about taking warm clothes because you will get cold!!  When you start the final ascent at around 2.30am (after a massive first breakfast!) you will be wearing all your clothes and you'll be glad you have them with you! Definitely bring some waterproof gloves because you will be using some ropes to get up the steeper bits and you will be glad of keeping your hands warm and dry.  The websites tell you the important things to bring but do not forget to bring a headtorch either as you start the final ascent in the pitch black of the night! I found this part of the trek hard but it was well worth it when you reach the top and the sun starts to come up and you are greeted with amazing views that you didn't even know were there while you were climbing up only hours before! Do not worry about doing this climb because you can take it at your own pace and there is no pressure.  We met a couple of Aussie gals and one of their dads who were doing the trek and he was in his 60's I think.  He found it tough at places, but he enjoyed it too.:-)"
827,Glorious sight,"I am a hiker.  I've hiked the Inca Trail, the Milford Track, the Highline Trail, many Yosemite trails including Pohono and Clouds Rest and literally hundreds of other trails.  This is the worst hike I have ever done.  It is short, but the stairs are so high that the hike winds up being very painful, and I'm 6 feet tall so it should've been okay for me.  There are few viewpoints, and there is not much in the way of wildlife along the way to take your mind off how steep it is.  It was clear by the time I got to Laban Rata that I was not interested in any more of the hike, so I spent the night there, got a nice night's rest, and went down when the remainder of my group returned from the summit.  All of us had stiffness and pain for 5-6 days afterward, and I've never completed a hike, especially not one this short, that left me feeling that way.  I truly don't understand why people travel from around the world to do this hike because no one should ever do it.  Please, do the Inca Trail instead if you want a high altitude hike that challenges you.  It's much longer, but you have amazing views the entire way and then you get Macchu Picchu at the end."
828,Tough but worth it,"Went to mt kk on a company trip coinciding with the merdeka weekend. Poetic indeed. There were 38 of us, about 7 didn't make it for various reasons but can be summarized as follows-underestimating the mountain and how challenging the hike truly is. It's about mental fitness as much as physical- you need to get used to going through pain barriers else you will suffer and possibly endanger yourselves throughout the climb. Overall it was indeed beautiful up there - and the mountain is so majestic, so imperious, so significant that I feel humbled just being there. MasyaAllah! For climbers be well prepared gear wise(bing headlamp, raincoat, warm undergarments, thermal better, enough high energy food to snack on, sip water sufficiently all the way up, gloves for the rope part as well to fend off cold, painkiller medications, comfy shoes that grips the surface.. Oh by the way, tea and coffee at Laban rata outside the buffet time is really expensive so bring your own tea bags and coffee powders ... some list of basic item  you need) and do train well... Know your limits... This is no child play. Respect the mountain and it will respect you back. Good luck!"
829,One of the highlights on our 5 months souteast Asia trip,"We visitrd late January 2013 arriving late afternoon as a group of 16 orchid enthusiasts from Perth. Earlier in the day we had the opportunity to take some good photos of Mt Kinabalu ringed by cloud with the top 300 metres showing.Overnight we stayed in the Mt Kinabalu Lodge and throughout the night we were woken by heavy rain. The next morning we went otside for photos, the whole landscape was covered with mist and hard to see further than 10 metres.After breakfast our tour bus took us further down the mountain and most of us took a 2 hour walk along the park trails, soaking wet but the raingorest was superb. Well worth the effort.After the walk we all went to the restaurant within the Park Headquarters for a wonderful lunch."
830,"Amazing Borneo Tour / Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia",These folk should try using road signs. They work really well in other places where you are trying to encourage tourists. Also stop overselling everything. The Poring Hot Springs should be called Boring. The Butterfly House is closed on Mondays! No mention on website or anywhere.The Tropical garden is a nice walk but not worth charging for. The Orchid Garden is probably the best with some nice orchids - Paph Roschildiana = VG; Othere so so. Nice paths are being laid made from  quality pavers. Flowering about 15% overall in April 2013
831,Wonderful view,"The climb was organised for our group of 65 individuals from around the globe, mostly young, adult professionals. Simon Amos of Fieldskills Adventures was responsible for our groups climb, 3-day mountain biking with Bike Borneo, and 2-days Whitewater rafting experience. The mountain climb started from Mesilau Lodge (longer route) up thru Loban Rata and summit up & back Straight down to the Tempohan ? sp, Gate. Advisable to stay at higher altitude such as Mesilau to acclimatise. Climb was a 2 nights, 3 day affair. The experience was exhilarating, challenging and endurance testing. It was the best experience when you consider all the activities were done in a space of 7 days. the crews were professional and would recommend them anytime.Great Bucket list challenge"
832,Just do it!,I got an unforgetable moment with my best friend in mount kinabalu. The view is very nice. Challanging for us but worthed. We will always remember that.
833,Long way out,Just read a 6.0 Earthquake has closed down the mountain for at least 3 weeks with many casualties. I am supposed to be hiking it exactly 3 weeks and 1 day.  Really hoping they can reopen it by then.  Crossing my fingers.  Just letting everyone know on this website.
834,Tough but rewarding,"Living in KK for years, I still couldn't believed I had reached Mt. Kinabalu. All my life I would never forget the sight of Kundasang lights twinkling below during my night-morning ascent to the summit. It's definitely a sight to behold till you die. The expanse of the summit plateau is just breathtaking. I remember thinking to myself this feels just like a dream. The joy, excitement you felt is just undescribable. -sheena"
835,Excellent two day Kinabalu climb,local handicraft is more expensive in KK city. not many restaurant to dine in. becareful when buying fruits and vegatables from the stalls at the roadside. on the surface they may look good but the inside is already rotten.
836,Back to nature,"Conquering Mt Kinabalu has to be the most physically and emotionally taxing experience I ever had to go through (well, second to my puppy love experience. hahaha). But the view at the top and the whole journey were so worth it. My sister and I conquered this beautiful mountain on May 13 and more than anything else, it was one great learning experience. Read about our insights here: http://onelightsuitcase.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/reflections-climbing-mt-kinabalu/And if you're planning to organize this yourself, here's my DIY. Ditch the travel agency route. You can easily organize this on your own. It will be waaaaay cheaper, and you'd feel more accomplished.  Hope you find it helpful!http://onelightsuitcase.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/mt-kinabalu-climb-diy/"
837,Beautiful mountain climb,"By no means a massively challenging summit, but definitely an interesting one. At times a rope may be necessary to climb up the steeper bits of the mountain face. The scenery from the peak once the sun has come up is astounding. The food at Laban Rata is excellent - book through Jungle Jack on facebook for the best price and a proper experience in the national park area. You'll save a few hundred ringgit and be rewarded with his fantastic hospitality."
838,Amazing!,"Mount Kinabalu is South East Asia's highest mountain and unfortunately is closed for the next 2-3 months whilst mrjor repair work is carried out on the summit trail leading up to the half way houses (Laban Rata) and repair work can also be carried out to the accomodations which were destroyed during the devastating earthquake that struck North Borneo on the 5th June 2015.19 lives were sadly lost on the summit during the earthquake which measured 6.1 on the richter scale. Unfortunately, the earthquake struck at the busiest time of the day for climbing the mountain with climbers going up or coming down. Sabah has never traditionally been an earthquake hot bed or location though it does get 2-3 tremors a year which are not really anything significant in size compared to what it experinced on the 5th June 2015.Since then, it has had 80 tremors and minor earthquakes since then as the techtonic plates perhaps are moving about and resettling.For now, the mountain is closed though you can still visit the Park HQ for a day trip or to stay at the resort there. Things are still carrying on as normal in that respect.The Mesilau Resort is not accessible as the entire road leading up to the resort and it's bridges are very badly damaged. This resort will be closed for the immediate future whilst they repair this and this will take at least a year or so I think.As far as the western media coverage of the disaster, and in relation to the expat tourist who went naked on the summit, much of it was taken out of context.However, some youngsters do forget when you are visiting another country, you are responsible for ensuring you respect the culture, the people, the traditions and not to act stupid the way these youngsters did. Some of them were caught, arrested and spent 4-5 nights in jail, went before a magistrate, were fined and then deported there after.I think the 4 nights in jail was a wake up call for them and hopefully, this matter is now closed.If we did the same thing in any western country (i.e walked around naked in the city),we would also probably get arrested for public indecency.We all choose our destiny's with our decisions in life."
839,"Mount was good, but town small","I had a brilliant time on this hike. My mobile phone was stolen by a staff member at the guesthouse (see Laban Rata reviews) but the climb itself was beautiful, painful and exhilarating.I would like to recommend my guide Francis Yabie, he seemed a little bit older than some of the other guides but really experienced, knowledgeable and trustworthy. I'm sure the other guides are good too, but I'd like to say a few words about mine. I was doing the climb solo and believe he is the reason I reached the peak and have no great soreness afterwards as he advocated a steady pace (we were still the first to reach the peak so it wasn't actually that slow but he would pull me up for going too fast when he knew we still had a way to go)My shoes were not appropriate for the granite that makes up the majority of the peak climb and I kept slipping as it's rainy season, making me very nervous, but Francis lent me his shoes and helped me in the really steep bits. He really wants to make sure you feel safe and also teaches you the best technique for doing things like the ropes bit.Apparently you can request your guide so if you're a first time mountain climber ask for Francis!"
840,Hard work but definitely worth it!,"It is once impossible to get accommodation in Laban Rata and this has squash the dreams of numerous people who has trained so much and long to climb the mountain but unable to do so as there is no space left, to these day it is still the same!! But now you can still experience the climb .. Half Day Climb (which can only go all the way up to Layang Layang Hut) unless you are 150% physically fit within 1 day and before 12 noon reach the summit of Mount Kinabalu.If you can't do the full climb then this would be the next best thing to do!! It's worth the experience and you still have to start off the same as the rest of the normal climbers as all climb need to depart before 11.00am for safety purposes. Even though you only going to do the half climb you still need to prepare the normal preparation and that is getting yourself a packed lunch or snacks, a good comfy hiking shoes & a raincoat or poncho (as you never know when it will rain like cats & dogs)."
841,No Views - But Superb!,"We climbed mount Kinabalu at the end of May. It was a wonderful, but physically exhausting experience. I would highly recommend climbing this beast, and pre-climbing training is a necessity! The views are breathtaking from top to bottom! Do not book through Sutera Harbour Lodges directly, or you will pay over double of what the average person spends. If you have booked through this company, be prepared to pay all the extras on arrival and all expenses are cash only."
842,Strenious climb under ardious conditions,"This is a spectacular park with lovely places to stay.  Best of all, it's cool.  Lots of unique birds and mammals.  Hire a guide and climb to the top."
843,Unforgettable climb,"Anyone who says this is easy or not so hard must be super super fit. I'm early 30's and I'd say average fitness. I trained on the stepper in the gym at least 4 times a week for a couple of months before the climb. But nothing could have prepared me for that climb. The first day to Laban Rata was hard but manageable and almost enjoyable. Good walking shoes are a must, as is a walking stick. I saw many people in trainers, but it rained for most of the day so the feet must've been soaked and so much more chance of slipping on the uneven surface.Stay at Laban Rata was fine. We arrived after 5 hours exactly of climbing, having set off at 9am. Dinner is served from 4-7pm and you can buy snacks and drinks too (including beers). We opted for the private room which had 2 beds and hot water until 4pm. Very much worth the extra as we were told by others the hot water for the dorms is dependent on solar power so most ended up with cold showers. We also had a heater in our room. We set off at 2:30am for the ascent to the summit. We were lucky with the weather as it was very mild. We had a base layer, t shirt, fleece and coat but quickly ended up taking off the fleece and coat. Almost from the get go I really struggled. The first part is pure steps uphill. People set off at different times and very quickly I realised I was getting past by almost everyone I saw at Laban Rata. I just couldn't get my breath and felt so sick the whole time. But I had to push on. I'd made it this far I had to get to the top. When I thought I was almost there and could see the top of a hill I asked the guide is that the top. Oh no. Still 1km to go. I could have cried. The Sun started breaking through the clouds about 5:30am and at that point I knew I wouldn't make it to the top to see sun rise. But I got to see if from the side of the mountain and still had a stunning view. I somehow reached the summit at 7am, almost 2 hours after my husband (I told him to go ahead as I knew I was struggling so much). I broke into tears the moment I got to the top out of sheer overwhelming happiness I'd made it. I was 3rd last out of everyone who set off, although some people didn't make it. I was so happy I managed to do it after the struggle I had. This was pure determination. You need to have this to make it to the top. If you are a quitter. Don't attempt this climb.It was great on the last stretch as people were coming down the encouragement people gave me. That helped to push me on. My guide was also so patient.After only about 10 mins at the top we had to start the descent. We arrived back at Laban Rata at 10am with a short stop for breakfast and check out at 10:30. Going down was another torturous experience. I've never experienced so much pain. My legs kept buckling, and I was in agony. Every 500m sign seemed to be miles away. We eventually got to the bottom at 5pm. An absolutely agonising 2 days. However, I am so proud I pushed through and managed to make it.Not for the faint hearted and certainly not for those who give up easily. A huge achievement for myself but definitely not one I would rush to do again!Definitely need the following;Good walking shoesWalking stickHead torchWarm clothes - number of layersCamelback - for easy water drinking"
844,leisure climb,"Prior to the hike, many of the websites we read stated one should be ""reasonably fit"" in order to climb. I'm not sure what that actually means; however, I can say that my husband and I run about 10 miles a week, and this was definitely one of the most difficult physical activities we have ever done, much harder than a half marathon! It is straight up and straight down. The trip up was hard on the lungs and the trip down was hard on the muscles and joints. This was the first high altitude hike we have done.With that said, it was INCREDIBLE! The scenery is beautiful the entire time and the sense of accomplishment is awesome. We hiked on December 21. Laban Rata is above the cloud line and we had the most incredible sunset!We woke up just before 2 am and were delayed until 3:30 am due to rain on the summit. Once we received the go ahead we climbed through the dark clinging to ropes and sloshing through the trail. We made it to the summit just as the sun was rising and the storm rolled in. There was frigid wind and pouring rain until we were off of the granite and downpours all the way down the trail.If you are attempting to hike during the rainy season, the best advice we can give is to have waterproof gloves, as the ropes on the summit hike are saturated if it is raining and your hands will be quite cold. Also, it is best if you have waterproof jackets, pants, and shoes. It was surprisingly cold on the summit and dry clothing will make a huge difference. And yes, with all of that said, we are wondering when we will have another chance to hike to the top!"
845,Majestic,"It was definitely the experience of my lifetime. I've dreamed about climbing this mountain since the first time I was privileged to lay eyes on it. This was when my family brought my siblings and I for a short stay in Kundasang resort when I was around 5.The journey is tough so definitely be mentally prepared too. Also, go with a group of friend who will support you all the way through. It's really the team spirit and constant motivation for each other that counts. At the end of the day, for us, it wasn't about who reached the summit first but rather, the fact that every single person in the team made it.Our only regret was we didn't take enough pictures. The view was so breathtaking."
846,The highest point in South East Asia,"I Came, I Saw, I Conquered...  Still can't believe I made it to the top. Great view, start slowly on the first day and get plenty of rest the night before. To the summit at 2:30am is very tiring reach at peak 5:30am. Hard to breathe in thin air. Had to rest every 10 steps. Excellent track but OMG.. its not easy. It was an ambitious journey, a journey to conquer one of the highest mountains in South East Asia and the highest in Malaysia. It was also a great experience, learn how to control yourself, not to give up, to keep your mind positive, and focus. It definitely was not an easy journey, so have a good preparation is a wise decision, ensure that you are fit enough or you'll be back with swollen muscle or injured yourself.( I was swollen muscle for 5days)  It's a 9km climbing, and at night it's super cold. The view is marvelous and it's worth the pain. It's like a gift after hours of climbing. Try to stop and enjoy, focus is good but if you are too intense with the climb you lose the precious view.Self preparation: energy bars, head light (to climb at 2-2:30AM),jacket and pants, please don't wear jeans, hiking shoes, socks, warm clothing and beanie hat, small towels and toileteries, gloves, Panadol (in case of altitude sickness), biscuits/chocolates.ensure the bag is not over weight, it will slow you down and kill your back. for walking stick, you can rent it for MYR10.Looking forward for second climb..."
847,tranquil,"I’m not going to sugar coat this. It was the hardest most challenging thing I have ever done. However it was also the most amazing experience and the biggest achievement I have accomplished (and I didn’t even reach the top!)I need to put this in perspective for you – I’m 4ft 11, fit (I go to the gym 4-5 hours a week) and petrified of heights - I found this so so hard and felt completely unprepared. Saying that my other half does not go to the gym, is a smoker albeit has a manual job day in day out and he made it to the peak, it took him a lot longer but he did it. There are no flat paths its all steep uneven steps / stones (which perhaps felt like mini mountains because of my little legs?). I felt like I was in Jurassic Park, I’m so glad I got to do it – a rare part of the world untouched my man (I realise the fault in that statement as there were hundreds of people doing it but you know what I mean!), the scenery and sounds were amazing. Pure Jungle.We did the 2 night tour with the over night stay halfway up. I say over night you get a few hours sleep as you wake up at 2am to climb the last bit to the peak to watch the sunrise. I suffered with the altitude where I kept waking up gasping for breath and at one point started panicking and thinking I needed to get back down. I overcame it.The way up was long and hard and very very wet. Torrential rain like you have not seen. We were basically climbing up a waterfall.Advice;Train before hand, I wish I had done more outdoor walkingWaterproof clothesComplete change of clothes (including socks and pants – EVERYTHING gets wet)Carrier bags – these saved my feet from having to go back into cold, wet hiking boots.Extra warm clothes – it’s freezing at the top. If you are scared of heights be prepared. I got so close to the peak but made the fatal error of looking back. Damn it’s high. There are clouds and lightening BELOW you. I panicked sat myself down and couldn’t go any further.Gloves – at the top it is very steep and there are ropes to pull your self up a lot of the wayHead torch – its pitch blackTake a look around and enjoy the sceneryI wish I had made it to the top but I don’t think even if I did it again I could. Even a Canadian couple who we were with who were keen hikers said it was very scary and windy at the peak and spent 5 mins up there then came back down.Oh and there’s the way down – this is no walk in the park and you have to do it in the daylight so you can see the sheer drops and scariness. It took 3 or 4 hours to come back down.I realise my review is seeped in negativity and I didn’t mean for that to happen but I wanted to give a frank honest review – something I felt I didn’t come across when researching before I went. As hard / scary as it was I can’t express how AMAZING it is. Do it do it but just be warned / prepared.Oh and I couldn’t walk properly for 3 days afterwards. Coming down the stairs – forget about it."
848,a must see and do,"Best experience for me. This is a starting point of my other journals. It's such a tough way from the base to Laban Rata.Anyway, everything there is worth enough. Next day morning is more tough on the way to the summit. But everything at Low's peak is much more incredible. It's still in my memory. I already got it, Kinabalu mount."
849,All is worth it when you make it to the top!,"Preparing for this trip is a bit confusing, as it seems that anyone can do it, and not much gear is needed.  Also arriving at the main gate, the park seems something of a Disneyland, with big roads and all you can eat restaurants.  The hike is hard, and you should not be disarmed by all this.  Train a bit to get your fitness up and be prepared for a cold night at the top especially during monsoon season.  However if you take a little time to prepare, this is a wonderful experience to see the sun rise from the top.  Check out this little article I wrote and pictures of the climb here:http://www.nomadic-by-nature.com/summiting-mount-kinabalu-in-a-monsoon/"
850,Breathtaking (both while climbing and on the top ;-),"I've given this one star based almost solely on the outrageous price it costs to climb Mt kinabalu, but also the high risk you might not even make it to the summit for sunrise. I climbed together with my girlfriend, opting for the 2D1N budget climb with Amazing Borneo Tours.The good points here are that the tour company and whole operation is very slick and well run; the food is great despite the café relying on locals carrying food up to 3,000m; and ultimately it's a good climb, with lots of different vegetation and great views. What I can't seem to understand is why it costs so much money. The path is very well laid out and hence there is no need for a guide. Moreover, I'm fairly certain all that money you pay doesn't go to those who deserve it most, e.g. the hard workers carrying food up to the cafe at Laban Rata. Additionally, if you pay that much money you then expect a very high level of service. Despite the both of us taking acetazolamide, my girlfriend reached 3,600m and showed severe signs of altitude sickness - headache, nausea, lethargy etc and became so lethargic / ill that she couldn't talk and required my guide and I to support and walk her back down. To my surprise the guide wanted us to continue onwards to the top - I had to insist we go back down before she got worse. Poor advice from a guide who should know better and no apparent access to steroids. In my opinion you'd be better off finding other peaks to climb for much less money - at only 800m mount santubong in sarawak is almost incomparable to the 4000m giant of kinabalu, but it's free to climb and has a fun rope & ladder section near the top - taking cost into consideration, I'd recommend Mt santubong every time."
851,Tiring but amazing!,"You will struggle, groan, moan and curse your way up but once you reach the summit, you will marvel in awe at the out-of-this-world landscape and scenery that no words can accurately describe. The feeling is incredible , and so is the sense of pride and achievement that you have overcome so many obstacles (exhaustion, pain, the cold, the rain) to come this far.Many others have written about what to expect from the accommodation and the climb, so I will not elaborate on that. But some tips :- good trekking shoes are essential- you will be walking on rocks of all shapes and sizes most of the time; so a good grip is important- hiking pole (one is sufficient) and knee guards are very helpful- have your waterproof gloves and jacket with you during the day climb as well - it gets chilly when it rains - good to have the headlamp with you during the day climb  in case you reach Laban Rata late (the day turns dark quite early) - and also for the descent to the starting point (Timpohon)- 2 bottles of 500ml water is sufficient for the day climb; don't gulp them but drink in sips. Even better if one of them is the sports isotonic drink (eg 100plus, Gatorade)- carry as little and as light as possible- walk at your own pace- train, train train !Lastly, have fun and take loads of pictures ! This is one experience you will never forget !"
852,Mountain climb,"We only had one day, so trekked to Laban Rata and back, but it was worth it. There are markers every 500m, which helps a lot. Laban Rata is at km6. The first 2km are easy, km 2 - km 4 are nice, but it gets steeper and tougher from km 4 (Layang Layang shelter) to Laban Rata. But also the views get amazing as the terrain opens up (it's a trek through a forest up to km 4). We are average in fitness, but found the ascent relatively easy (we did it at 1 km per 30 minutes, which is about twice quicker than average). The descent seemed to take forever and the legs hurt for a good few days afterwards. All in all, great trek and definitely worth the effort if you like mountains.There are toilet facilities and shelters every few hundred meters.Good tip: there's a great restaurant just in front of the entrance to the kinabalu park, just across the street, next to the bus stop/car park. It serves cheap authentic food. They also do packed lunches (15 MYR for a sandwich, egg, apple and bottle of water). You can also stock up on dry food and drinks there."
853,walking down was harder,"We did the Mt. Kinabalu during a trip in Borneo. We arranged it on the spot, which was no problem. Early morning you're dropped at the 'foot' of the mountain, and your guide will escort you up. Halfway you have a long pitstop at Laban rata, a cabin where you buy some food and soup, and enjoy a little rest, before your hit the summit just after midnight. We didn't really prepare, and still managed to hit the summit without any problems. So there's no need for extensive preparation, you just need to be a bit in shape. The way down, is the tough part, where you twist ankles, and are just tired. The top (summit) was impressive (but cold, so don't let the tropical beach temperatures in Borneo deceive you). Great trip!"
854,Very good climbing experience with my son,"We went with Absolute Borneo who lived up to their name and were absolutely fantastic. We were picked up by a guide and driver and as we were the only 2 who had booked with them, we got our own private tour. The guide was full of interesting information and amusing anectdotes which filled the time taken to get to the mountain. We even ahd to pick up some stuff for the climb so they were happy to source what we needed at nearby villages, even showing us around these places and bargaining on our behalf to get ridiculously cheap prices.On arrival, they organised everything so we just ahd to wait around whilst it was sorted and they put us on the bus to the gate (everyone has to use the provided bus) and we met our guide and started the climb.We had a light drizzle for most of the walk but the canopy gave us ample cover. It took us 5.5hrs at a slow but steady pace and by the time we got to Laban Rata I was stuffed.I am 42, M, did a few 'training' bush walks in the preceding weeks and play indoor soccer once a week. That was the extent of my training. So Iw as stuffed on arrival but not completely ruined. The food was decent and plentiful. We had to share with 2 others and the beds creak and I got very little sleep (maybe an hour). The night climb was cold but not too bad (until the top) and we had a perfectly clear night sky. The walk was slow and tiring but if you stick to a small step zig zag walk, you will be able to just go on and on. We made it to the top just as the horizon was going purpley orange and we had an amazing sunrise and perfect view (see the pics).A many other people have said, the walk down was the most painful. My legs were gone by 1/3 of the ay down so the rest was just auto-pilot. MAKE SURE YOU GET A WALKING STICK!!!! It will help no end when descending. Don't take it on the climb up to the summit from Laban Rata, you won't really need it and it will just get in the way. Also, make sure you have warm gloves! Mine weren't and my fingers were numb and sore for 2hrs of the climb back down.The real pain doesn't start until then next morning. I took a good 7 days to recover fully. You can still walk from day 1 but any stairs are a no-no. Even small ones and gutters. After completing it, I would've said the pain was not worth the sense of accomplishment. 2 months later, i may be slightly changing my tune...maybe."
855,Very good trip,"... but seeing the sun rise at 6 in the morning from the summit was worth it, though very cold  (+2) and windy (> 10 m/s). You start by hiking the first day, approx 6 km and 1500 m ascending. Stay at ok lodge, with nothing to do. Next morning at 3 you start first hiking by feet, then by rope approx 3 km and 800 m asc. You'äll spend just minutes at the summit if it's cold. On the way down you will see the rests of the earthquakes that hit the mountain the last two years 15/16, last one killing 18 people.Traveled with Downbelow, great touroperator, great mountain guide!"
856,"Mt.Kinabalu, the majestic...","If you book via internet or telephone they make you pay a lot more than you have to!!The cheapest way to get up the mountain is to book the tour at the official sales office of ""sutera sanctuary lodges"" (they own all accomodations up the mountain).The offices is situated in Kota Kinabalu at the groundfloor of the Wismah Sabah Mall (Lot G15, Ground Floor, Wisma Sabah, 88000 Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia). It is the building in KK that looks like a huge ""L"". If you go to one end of the ""L"" you will find the office right at the end on the left side. Don't book in one of the other travel agencies around there, because in the end they all book it through that office, but charge you extra money!!We paid for the 2D/1N tour about 430 Ringgit - including accomodation, lunch day 1, dinner day 1, short breakfast day 2, breakfast day 2, lunch day 2, insurance, park fees. Then when you arrive at the park in the morning after registration you only have to pay the transport from the office to the startpoint, which was about 20 Ringgit per car. The next day you have to pay the taxi back to the office again.And you have to pay the guide at the office there as well: The guide is 150 Ringgit for 1-3 persons or 175 Ringgit for 4 persons and more. There is always people there that want to share a guide! In the end we were 5 people so it was only 35 Ringgit per person for the guide.And of course you have to organise the transport from KK to the national park. With the minibus it takes about 2 hours to get there, so that we decides to go to the national park one night before to start climbing early the next day. The hotels in the national park are really expensive, but you can book a normal hostel directly outside the park for a normal price and just take a taxi into the park the next day (5 min drive).So all together we paid per person:- bus-transport KK to national park the day before climbing and back after the climbing (I can't remember the price, but it was quite cheap, together maybe around 50-60 Ringgit)- one night outside the national park (normal hostel price)- 430 Ringgit for the tour- about 15 Ringgit for the two taxis between start point and registration office- 35 Ringgit for the guideThis doesn't even come close to the 1300 Ringgit you have to pay online!!I hope this post, makes it possible for more people to experience this great trip! :)It was definitely one of the best things I did in life, but please only go up if you're fit enough to do it. And you should think about buying altitude sickness tablets before. You can get them really cheap (about 18 Ringgit) in KK in the pharmacy and they really really help!! We saw a lot of people that were forced to give up because they got sick and we didn't even got a headache :)"
857,Awesome trekking,"We visited as part of a tour. Found very few flowers besides some very unusual Orchids.It was fun to see them, but wish for much more to see. Luckily we didn't pay extra as it was part of the tour."
858,Absolutely fantastic,"From the outset - we didn't make it to the top. Our kids were 7, 10 and 12 at the time and the 12 year old set off with the group very early in the morning but turned back due to the cold. My other two were suffering from altitude sickness so I looked after them Funnily enough, I reckon I could've made it to the top but being the mummy, I stayed with my kids. No regrets. We had planned this well in advance and arrived ready on the day but alas, we had to take accommodation on site and start the next day. Our guide was gorgeous and most helpful. We bought a 'stick' to help us get up the top. With a knee replacement, every step up for me was with my good leg and every step down was with my bad one. Hence I hurt my hips somewhat.We all trekked well to the top and were overtaken by many other walkers who made it in 6 hours. We took over 8. Once we hit 3000m we all slowed down.However, we did stop alot on the way to take in the stunning orchids, the butterflies, the animals and birds.We met some lovely people along the way and on our return it was gorgeous to connect with some people from around the world.The accommodation just below the summit was good, clean and plenty of food. I spent the night with my son who was vomitting from the altitude. He is definitely not a mountaineer in the making.THe food at the lodge below the summit is basic but good and frankly, many people were vomiting in the night so don't get too stressed.A walking stick is ideal and once you hit 3000m you will need it. Your guide is your best friend so please take one as they cost very little and have alot to offer.We were passed by so many people who were out to hit the top time and that's fine but they were rude and disrespectful to my kids, saying things like 'kids shouldn't be here'. My kids today still relish in their achievement and aspire to other great things. So go suck an egg you egotists."
859,The last real adventure in Asia...,"Climbing Mt Kinabalu was always something I wanted to do and I was glad to be able to do so. (More or less, bad weather forced us back 300m from the summit, the heavens opened up right there and then)1.Book early. Apparently slot get filled up fast. Being Malaysian gets you access to cheaper accommodation like Lemaing Hut which was pretty decent though it's still really cold and there was no hot water. (Unless you boiled the kettle to make your own warm bath). Got a good local agent who sorted the whole hike for me. (PM If keen on details.)2. Train and go at a slow steady pace if you have to, unless you wish to develop debilitating cramps on the hike up. If you can't carry your pack please do get a porter.3. There is no more drinking water provided at Laban Rata Resthouse (Where you have your meals). So either bring your own up or buy it at inflated prices up there. 4. Bring Altitude sickness meds, painkillers and deep heat rub to soother aching muscles5. Get a good quality raincoat/poncho. A waterproof windbreaker and waterproof gloves. As i mentioned it poured as we were nearing the peak, and we nearly froze as we were soaked through. Don't let that happen to you. 6.Rent a hiking pole or buy one. It's only rm10 from your porter and start climbing early. 7. Make sure you pack light and pack adequately. It is pretty cold up at laban rata what more the summit ascent in the wee hours of the morning. That's all I can remember from my experience of climbing Mt Kinabalu. It was an epic climb with great friends. Go in a group. Leave no man behind."
860,A unique experience,Spent a number of dayswalking the trains of Mt. Kinabalu during our many trips to Borneo. This is a must on anybody's top list of natural parks to see anywhere in the world.
861,fantastic views,"missing the good old timewhen everyone can climbeven a blind, special needs, athmatic, poor peoplenow they still canas long have big pocket!"
862,Fairly easy climb,"A few years ago they privatized the hut and every accomodation in the park. They are all owned by the same company. Since they have the monopole they let you climb it only if you book the first night in the park, the second one in the hut and if you eat at their restaurant. Add to this the entrance fee to the park, the climbing fee, the insurance and the guide fee and you happen to pay around 250-300 USD for a two days trip. Considering you are sleeping in a 60 people dormitory only until 2am and that the guide is absolutely useless (if you are used to hike and if you are fit) that is very very pricy!This is why we couldn't afford to do it in two days and decided to do the one-day ascent. Don't look for it, they don't do any advirtisement about it. You can only book it in the park office. We came the day before to do all the formalities and if they are not really keen on letting you do it insist a litlle bit and show them you know what you are doing and it's alright. You can only start the hike at 7am like this they are sure the only way to see the sunrise from the top is paying a lot...We arrived around 6.30am at the entrance park, met our guide and took a minivan to the furthest place you can reach by car. We started our hike around 7.15am and reached the hut at 9.45am. We left the hut 15 minutes later and reached the top at 12.30. The descent took us about 3 hours and a half.You have to be quite fit and mentaly strong to do it in one day. My friend and I are 23 and we practise sport regularly. We don't do any competition or high performance sport and we didn't train at all for this ascent. We were really really exhausted when we reached the top. The second part from the hut to the top is very tiring since you are lacking oxygen. This day only 5 people including us managed to reach the top in one day. You have to reach it before 1pm for two reasons. The first one is that you need to be back at the entrance of the park around 5pm and the second one is that after 1pm the top gets very cloudy and you don't have any visibility. Your guide won't let you continue if you are too slow. That is probably his only role since the path is so well indicated and safe that nothing bad can happen to you unless you do it on purpose and there is no way you could get lost. In addition the guide knew nothing about the flora or fauna. However they are mandatory...The one-day ascent costs around 50 USD per person if you are 2, a little bit more if you are alone since you don't share the guide fee.I was very glad to have done this hike! Firstly for the scenary which is awesome. You are going through two kinds of forest and then it is just rocks. Secondly for the physical effort which was definetly the hardest I've done in my life and was a good challenge. I wouldn't pay for the two days ascent but the one-day was worth the price."
863,day trip,"if you are a nature kind of person, this is the best place to go...if sound of the bird chirping, and smell of the forest, really taking you back and relax, forgetting about the sound of the car horn and traffic jam. I would recommend to go here and I would go again myself in the future."
864,IF YOU ARE IN BORNEO AND FIT ENOUGH THIS IS A MUST DO.,"The friendly people that you meet along the way and the help that you get from your mountain guide. Robert Tiam is a very skilled and helpful mountain guide.Would want to do it again, if possible."
865,"Just amazing, it's like being in another planet up there! :)",The Mount Kinabalu National Park offered a range of walks for all abilities which enabled you to see a wide range of Flora and Fauna under the forest canopy.
866,Exquisite mountain,"As a local Sabahan, other Malaysians keep asking whether I have climbed the Mt Kinabalu before. Well having successfully climbed it in August 2017 (one of the wettest periods of the year) I can finally tell them.Prior to the climb I barely did any training except swimming every week. I recommend more training than that. On the day we collected our ID cards, met our guide (who was also our porter) and took a taxi from Kinabalu Park main entrance to Timpohon gate. We started off at Timpohon gate at approx 7.30 am having stayed in a lodge in Kundasang the night before. The climb to Laban Rata (Panalaban) took 5 hours with breaks in between. For this part of the climb I would advise people to not pile on too many layers. Other than your most essential items (waterproof jacket, stick and water) you should pack the rest and let your porter help you carry them. It is very humid and the climb gets steeper and more difficult the last 2 km to Laban Rata.Upon reaching Laban Rata, we stayed in one of the hostels owned by Sabah Parks which is cheaper but lacks many conveniences (towels, heating, personal space). We had to boil water to bring into the bathroom to have our showers but that was better than cold showers. There were 14 of us in one room sharing one bathroom and all the beds were bunk beds. We had dinner at 6pm and went to bed by 8pm. Woke up at 1.00 am to get ready for the climb to the peak. Breakfast at 1.30 am and we immediately started hiking up at 2.20am. There isn't a clear time to start heading out so long as your guide and you are ready and the weather is good enough to start. Bring warm and waterproof clothes, water, walking stick, headlamp and camera. The next hour or so will consist of wooden stairs and stairs cut out into the terrain. The goal is to reach the final checkpoint before 5.30 am to ensure you get to see the sunrise. From that check point it is another hour or so hike to the peak. I reached the checkpoint at 4 am and they had to scan our ID cards. I then reached the peak slightly before 6 and was able to catch a beautiful sunrise. Seriously having the sun light up the mountain, the path you have climbed, the village below the Mountain and even Kota Kinabalu in the distance was just a pure feeling of awe and disbelief!Going down back to Laban Rata was alright except that somehow the path had become more muddy and slippery after the rain. After resting at Laban Rata and having breakfast, we set off at 10am back down. This was of course the worst part because it puts so much strain on your knees and hips in bracing your body. To add salt to the wound, it started raining really heavily. A week after the climb,So now when other Malaysians ask me if I have climbed Mt Kinabalu, I will smirk and tell them 'it is more than just a climb, it is an experience'."
867,A natural jewel in South East Asia,"Having previously climbed Kililmanjaro, I thought Kinabalu would be a less taxing ascent.The fact that the return ascent in done in two days means it tougher than it first appears. It might be wise staying near the park headquaters beforehand because otherwise you are going from sea level to 3000+ metres in one day (which can be alot of attitude gain in one go).The trail from the gate to rest huts is pretty much relentless, especially after the Layang Layang pondok (where most people stop for lunch). There is a waterfall shortly after the start, but that is about it, it's then steps and rocks all the way.That said being at the summit for sunrise was brilliant, and plenty of great photos taken.We also did the Mountain Torq Via Ferrata, and I thoroughly recommend it. We did the Walk the Torq, as we hadn't done Via Ferrata before. Once again the photos look brilliant, and you are really safe.The real hard part is the descent from the huts. You have been up since 2:30am to the summit for 6am, then perhaps 1hr 30mins on teh via ferrata on the way down then stopping for breakfast at the hut. It can take 4 hours to get back down, and it real pressure on those knees, hiking poles recommended ."
868,Yes!!! i did it...,"It was an ambitious journey, a journey to conquer one of the highest mountains in South East Asia and the highest in Malaysia. It was also a great experience, learn how to control yourself, to be humble, not to give up, to keep your mind positive, and focus. It definitely was not an easy journey, so have a good preparation is a wise decision, ensure that you are fit enough or you'll be back with swollen muscle or injured yourself. At least go through 1-3months exercise before you climb. It's a 9km climbing, and at night it's super cold. The view is marvelous and it's worth the pain ;) It's like a gift after hours of climbing. Try to stop and enjoy, focus is good but if you are too intense with the climb you lose the precious view.Myself and a friend engaged Amazing Borneo for the climbing activity, they prepare end to end, from the permit, guide and our stays at Laban Rata. Amazing Borneo appointed a really good guide for us, Mr. Moidin, he was very patience with my catching breath sessions and took care of us, kept us safe from any danger that might happen. The book the trip is quite simple, we email the team from Amazing Borneo and they are fast in replying back the email. Using MYR to proceed with the payment will be cheaper than make the payment in other currencies. Avoid rainy season, it makes your journey tougher. For logistic preparation: energy bars, head light (to climb at 2AM), waterproof jacket and pants, please don't wear jeans, hiking shoes (boots is better), socks, warm clothing and beanie hat, small towels and  toileteries, ensure the bag is not over weight, it will slow you down and kill your back. for walking stick, you can rent it for MYR10."
869,Highest peak in South East Asia,Spectacular scenery and interesting visit to the Botanical Gardens. Mount Kinabalu is an awesome site.
870,You want to be pretty fit to make it to the top!,"I came to Borneo with my boyfriend during our trip to South East Asia. We had everything arranged by Borneo Trails before hand and it made our trip stress-free throughout. We stayed in Kota Kinabalu for a night and then hopped in the van to the dense rainforest with the stunning mountain. We stayed overnight in Rock Twin share before waking up in the morning to scale the mountain. The climbing was tough for us and tiresome. After the first day we stayed at Laban Rata resthouse halfway up the mountain which for a mountain lodge was pretty clean and well managed. Around 2am in the morning we woke up and had an early morning meal before we left, met our guide and then trekked up to the top. At the top we saw the sunset which was breathtaking. We stopped by resthouse once again to have a quick breakfast and rest before going all the way down to the starting point. It was brilliant experience indeed!"
871,Adventurous.. Scenic.. A must to conquer!,"Reached the peak 3 times already. 2004, 2010 and 2012. Believe it or not, we're booked for another one in 2014! I seriously enjoy the climb, the scenery is fantastic, and once youve passed the sayat-sayat huts where only barren rocks remains, you feel like youre on another planet. Its an out-of-this-world kind of experience. Very exhausting but worth the effort.Anyone with adequate fitness can climb this mountain. No mountain climbing skills is required but you really need to train hard by walking up staircases, small hills and slopes because you need those muscles to be ready."
872,Fantastic Experience,"The Hike to Mount Kinabalu is fairly easy compared to Rinjani and Bromo/Semeru. I did it without much preparation. Climbing 30 to 40 story building by stairs 3 times a week with a bag pack will help you get ready for the trek. Plus some running ofcourse. If you are not active do this for 2 to 3 weeks and you are good to go.KK is like climbing a million stairs in 24 hours and coming down. Coming down is fast but your knees might pain so be ready and carry knees guards/ Bands etc if you need.. its exhausting..but fun and worth the hike. The view and feeling when you get to top is awesome. For beginners, Make sure you buy a good hiking boot from columbia etc, and make sure it's one size bigger. Wear it for few days and walk around and break the shoe it as its new. Else you will get blisters during the KK hike. Also please cut your toe nails before the hike properly. Else your might bleed or hurt your toes. I don't recommend sneakers or running shoes.Carry panadol as you might get headache due to altitude sickness. but its beareable. Everything on laban rata canteen is super expensive so please carry 4 to 5 energy_ protein bars with you and almonds and nuts or chocolate. It's gets quiet hot and i saw people vommiting due to dehydration. Carry a Hat as it's hot, and the Sun will burn you. Eating these nuts and energy bars as you go up will help plus drink lots of water.At the summit it's cold like 2 to 3 degrees + add wind chill to it. Layer up else you might freeze. Follow these recommendations and you will have a good time. i was carrying vodka too.. it was fun to take few shots at the top. All the best."
873,Cherished Memory,"We shared a taxi with two other travelers to get to the park. The price works out to be the same as taking a bus. The views of the highlands and mountain on the way was specular. We saw the magnificent view of the peak several times in the car, but not in the park! (I found out later that it is easier to get the view of the mountain at the other side of the park, at a parking lot near poring hot spring).  As we did not climb the mountain, we only trekked several short trails before the Timpohon Gate. They were ok.  We got a good feel of being in a tropical jungle, and the trails are quite nicely maintained. We hiked up to the two only viewpoints that were available before the Gate, but it was too foggy both times. It seems to be rather normal for the weather be foggy up there most of the time.As mentioned earlier, if you are not on a tour, you should consider sharing a cab to go there and back, cos the public bus is not on time and taking a cab can save you some time with almost the same cost."
874,"Most physically demanding thing I've done, but the sense of achievement is amazing","We booked a few days in advance, so were hit with a fairly expensive rate, 1400 RM for a 2D 1N climb.Some places recommend a 3D 2N climb, but we struggled to see what you would do with that extra day! Took about 3 hour to get to the accommodation, then an hour to the summit on the next morning.The tours all take you to the summit just before sunrise and the views are sensational. Really makes it all worth it."
875,Amazing Experience,"Low cloud cover kept messing with our admittedly poor photographic skills, by the time you get ready, the clouds move to wreck your view. There is no doubt that this is an awesome view, but be patient."
876,Beautiful Sunrise,"I've hiked much smaller mountains in New York State in the US (Adirondacks). This mountain was the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life. I am not fit or strong, but I was able to make it to the guest house for the night. We couldn't continue to the summit because the weather was so awful unfortunately. The mountain is mostly stairs, which I wasn't used to. It is steep, long, and difficult. Wear good shoes (waterproof if you can get them), parka, warm clothes, quick-dry or waterproof hiking pants, and keep a poncho in your backpack. Also carry some snacks. There are some snacks available at the bottom before climbing the mountain. Bring LOTS of water, as there is no clean water until you get to the top. Carry a GOOD back-pack with a strap across the chest and around the hips. I brought a crappy pack which is probably why it was also so difficult for me. Although the mountain was so challenging, it was the best thing I've ever done and I REALLY recommend it. You will feel so strong and invincible. Also, we saw some cool fat red leeches (they don't feed on humans). Another thing: There are lockers at the bottom of the mountain for storage, but they cost a small extra fee."
877,Loved it,"As a not-so-fit person I found this challenging but doable. By the end of it you never want to see stairs again. Standing at the top watching the sunrise did make it all worth it. I found the descent much easier though quite hard on your knees. We booked through our backpackers in KK, so although still expensive, cheaper than some online companies. We were collected from our backpackers in KK and returned there. One thing about the guides is that they stay with the slowest person in your group. They don't really tell you much about the flora and fauna if that's what you're expecting (maybe just our guide?). There is drinking water and a few toilets along the way.  Also, you can hire headlamps and warm jackets from Laban Rata so no need to carry it all up."
878,Wow!!!!!,"We climbed in one day.  Why?  Well, we were turned off by the outrageous prices at Laban Rata, not to mentioned they were fully booked 2-3 months ago for our mid-August climb.  All things pointed to tour packages.  But it was a national park, so why do we need a package?!?  So, here's what we did:  Monday AM we went to park and filled out paperwork after speaking to Mr. Diken, the park ranger.  He ok'd us to climb the following day, starting at 7:00am when the park opens.  Can you start earlier?  We wanted to, but they wouldn't allow us.  Guides are mandatory at 128 MYR for 1-2 people for day-climb, and round-trip shuttle to and from HQ and Timophon Gate (5KM away) is 33 MYR.  Our guide Johny had climbed 800+ times before and he was awesome.  Guides are easily arrnaged, they have more guides than permits to climb every day. We started hiking at 7:40am, made it to Laban Rata in 3 hours, relaxed for 10-15 minutes and made it to the freezing summit by 12:50pm!  It's required to reach Laban Rata by 12pm and summit by 1pm, however, it took the full 2 hours to get from Laban Rata to summit.  We got down Kinabalu back to the gate at 4:50pm.  So, was all this worth it?  YES!  We were sore for 4-5 days after the hike.  It's super challenging.  There were several moments where we didn't think we make the cutoff(s).  The altitude really sets in after Laban Rata.  It took determination and planning, but, if you're looking to avoid an expensive night at Laban Rata and waiting 2-3 hours at the dark, windy, frozen summit for the sun to rise, then try for 1 day hike.  The biggest gamble is the weather.  It rains a lot so if possible, stay by the park 2-3 days and pick the best day to climb, it'll be worth it!  Cloudy at the summit with visibility only 10-20m but about 400m below the summit, the views were incredible.  We had great weather.  Having done it now, I don't know if I'd go back.  It was the hardest hike/climb we have done.  Stoked we did it, but wow, very hard given the altitude change, weather, distance, and time restraints."
879,Tough but worthwhile,"As a young couple with average fitness, we were looking forward to climbing Mt. Kinabalu. However, we were also concerned whether we would make it (especially me). But we did and it was absolutely amazing. Everything is well organized and worked out. One would find the way up easily without a guide, but it is definitely helpful and necessary to have one for advice and in case someone does not feel well. We were very lucky with the weather and saw the beautiful sunrise on low‘s peak! Warm clothes are really needed up there since it gets very cold in the wind.The overnight facilities are very basic, but the food was really good with a lot of different things to choose from.In my opinion the whole trip could be a little cheaper for the services you get (still have to buy additional water, pay for luggage storage etc.). But the money and the effort was definitely worth the experience and the view.My advice: warm clothes, enough water and power drinks as well as power bars, good shoes with grip, stretch your legs sufficiently and have fun!"
880,Trek,Last year I took part in Expedition Mt Kinabalu to raise awareness for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. What a great climb for a great cause. I checked with organizer and Sabahan Catherine Jayasuriya and she is doing the climb again Aug 5-7 and she has spaces. Otherwise the mountain is booked out. Sign up!
881,Worth the effort,"Booked the trip by email on the Amazing Borneo Tours website. There is a lot of information on the website to prepare you for the climb. The staff were also very helpful with their emails.I took the 2D1N option. Picked up in KK at 6.15am and started the climb at 8.45am in a group with 4 others. Arrived at Panalaban at 2.15pm. Rest until 2.40am to walk the final 2.7k to the summit which we reached at 5.45am in time for sunrise at 6am. The morning was tough, thin air, a little altitude sickness and some rock climbing!! Returned to Panalaban by 8.10am and left for the 6k walk back down at 9.30am. You can leave your kit that you don’t need to summit at the lodge and collect for the way down. Reach the base at 1.45pm ready for the 2 hour transfer back to KK. Guide was great.The website says ‘moderate fitness’. You need to prepare as it’s all steps and very uneven ground. Tough but very rewarding but you do need to push yourself. Don’t take to much kit, when it rains, it rains so make sure you have everything in dry bags inside your backpack.I would recommend, it’s a great experience."
882,VIA Ferrata lows Peak with Amazing Borneo.,"Don't be fooled, this is not an easy climb, but it's well worth the effort!My husband and I are of a 'descent' fitness level, we took our climb to Laban Rata slow and steady, which felt like hours and hours of endless stairs and steep rocky paths, taking us approx 7 hours to make it to the Lodge. Along the way we enjoyed the flora and fauna, the amazing views and met lots of other climbers. We stayed the night at Laban Rata. The accommodation and food are excellent considering everything is carried up by porters. We woke up at 2am and began our climb to summit. It was very dark and had rained heavily through out the night making the steep, rocky path very slippery. Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it to the top, I had to stop at the most difficult part, the steep ascent via rope because I kept slipping on the wet granite and felt light headed from altitude sickness. Our wonderful mountain guide walked me back to the lodge... holding my hand the whole way and catching me numerous times when I almost slipped!! and then he went back to catch up with my husband who made it to the summit. Coming down was extra hard work as the path was very wet and slippery, not to mention it is hard on your knees, plus we'd been up since 2am so we were pretty exhausted!All in all, I highly recommend the climb and here are a few tips for those looking to embark upon the adventure! Tips:1. wear quality hiking boots, you will need the extra grip if it rains and the boots will support your ankles (particularly on the way down).2.  use walking poles or a walking stick, I would never have made it without it! We hired a walking stick at the park.3. save your knees by following a 'zig zag' instead of going straight, this especially helped me on the way down.4. cut your toe nails before the hike... trust me it helps!4. pack light, it's a long way up so the less weight you have to carry, the easier it will be!"
883,A fantastic two days,"Early taxi pick up from Kota Kinabalu (0530) after some bargaining night before 120 Ringgit - then a race to the national park arriving early. Were told by the park that registration is only open 0700-0900. Turned out we were the only day climbers that day - others opt to stay overnight.At registration we were told a couple of lads from Czech republic were also climbing & if we wanted to share a guide. Having paid for the climb (100 Ringgit +6% =106 per person and 7 Ringgit per person for insurance), guide (175 Ringgit for 4-10 people & 150 Ringgit for 1-3 people) & travel (34 Ringgit/4 people)  to the start we joined the other two in the waiting area. 5k up and back ascending about 1.3k. Many steps. Amazing flora & little (visible) fauna. Amazing view the few minutes when there was no cloudy/mist. 12 Ringgit hot drinks up top. Need to take a waterproof jacket. Leaving at 0730 we arrived at the top around 1200. Coming down leaving 1240 arriving at between 1500-1630 (depending on how good your knees like descending). Decided to get a coach back. Bus stop is out of the main nation park gate across the road (next to a cheap cafe that does good coffee). 20 Ringgit per person to 5km outside of Kota Kinabalu (suburbs) then 2 Ringgit per person minivan to Kota Kinabalu central. There was a direct bus to KK central but we just missed it so took the next one heading in the direction."
884,"A real mountain climb, 1 day can!","Early to reach Kundasang from Kota Kinabalu, would only mean you will be blessed with the amazing sight of the beautiful yet “shy” Mount Kinabalu. She will hide herself among the clouds, slowly and surely by mid morning."
885,It's the climb!,"Worth it!!!Try to get a two-day pass a long time in advance or go hunting for passes in the different hostels in Kota Kinabalu if you are flexible on time.If you don't get a pass for a two day climb and you're fit, go to the park, meet the park ranger and fix a pass for a one day climb. You'll need to go up and down in one day which is hard but still worth it. You won't have sunrise pictures but you'll have climbed the highest mountain in South-East Asia and you'll still have enjoyed great views if you're up before the clouds.Bring enough water and food because it's really expensive to buy stuff at Ladan Rata (hostel/rest place on the way up) and make sure to take a rest there both on the way up and down, you'll need it.Also bring some warmer clothes. Even if you do it it one day, the second part gets colder, even with a nice and bright sun. Oh, and don't forget sunscreen so you don't burn (even through the clouds)!!The only reason I didn't give a max rating is because we paid a lot for the guide but he was sick, couldn't follow and thus couldn't explain us anything...The poor man needed to work to be able to support his family so we didn't make a case out of it but make sure yours is healthy before going up!Enjoy the climb, enjoy the views and have a good time!"
886,once in a life time adventure,"I always love coming here...the orchids, trails and nature is none like other...its not too cold either. Each time you stop to see the waterfall or nepenthes its like taking a breath of fresh air. Proud that this is part of the UNESCO world heritage !"
887,Amazing Experience,"We decided not to pre book this trip months in advance as most guidebooks suggest but to only enquire about availability upon arrival to Kota Kinabalu. This was a good decision. We went in the Sutera office in KK and gave them a 7 day period during which we are able to climb. They had two dates available. We took the 1st of January. We were very happy with the price which was about half of what we expected after reading travel agencies' websites. We paid 1300 ringgit for 2 people including absolutely everything apart from transportation from and to the park entrance. We had our own guide, all the meals, accommodation, climbing permit and insurance, park entrance fee.Food and drinks at the Laban Rata guest house are incredibly expensive but you will understand why when you see people carry up everything on their backs. So it is best to have the package that includes food. You can get drinking water and hot water free though so bring your teabags and instant noodles with you.We took the local bus from KK to Ranau. This runs every hour and costs 20 ringgit per person. Since it takes 2 hours to get there from KK it is advisable to stay the night before the hike around the park entrance. We booked Rina Ria lodge which was surprisingly spacious and had a balcony with amazing views. Also it had very friendly staff and a cheap and good restaurant. The hike was very tiring, especially the second day on which we hiked altogether 8 and a half hours. And yes we also ached for days after the hik :) but it was all worth it! The view from the top was amazing and we were lucky to have clear weather to see the sunrise."
888,Stand on top of SE Asia!,"This is for everyone who doesn't want to pay double for getting to the top of mount Kinabalu.To do the trek I would say you need around 3/5 fitness level. This being said I've seen 60-70 year old man and woman doing it within given time limits.It's most common to do it over two days but if your level of fitness is really low you can spread it across three days.The tours prices you can book are around 1300 ringgit and I'll show you how to cut this price in half (all of the information is valid for foreigners, Male people pay around half of this price). First your have to start with booking accommodation. This can be done in the morning (if you're lucky like me) at the park itself or by calling Sabah Parks few days before (information can be easily found online on their internet page). The cheapest option costs 240 ringgit and includes three meals (lunch at 4pm, dinner at 2am and breakfast at 8am). This mean that you should get some additional food for the trek up and some snacks. Water refill is available every kilometer so it's sufficient to take a, small bottle with you. The park entrance fee is 200 ringgit and a guide which you have to hire is another 230 ringgit per person.On top of this you have to add: park entry ticket (15 ringgit), transportation to and form the start of the trek from park entrance (35 ringgit) and transportation to the park itself (40 ringgit return). The busses leave the city center at 7am and take around two hours to get to the park (you might try to get into a taxi of someone that booked a tour and pay the driver directly which can save you a waiting time). Taking all costs into consideration you will be paying: 240 + 200 + 230 + 15 + 35 + 40 + 40 (snacks, water and some food to go) = 800 ringgit.It's really not hard to do it yourself and you can save decent amount of money."
889,"What a mountain, what a climb!","Having trekked up a few mountains in the past, I was expecting this mountain to be similar, and knew it would be hard, particularly since I wasnt in the fittest state I had ever been in. Still, I was looking forward to it, as it is always exhilirating when you reach the top. Regretfully, we experienced torential rain for the entire 4h 45min walk on Day 1, with high winds and low visibility, meaning I was soaked (even with a goretex jacket) and cold within 45min. At least this kept the temperature down, but it was the most unpleasant conditions you could imagine to walk in, with water cascading down the walking path like a small waterfall. However, the weather wasnt the biggest challenge for me - it was the steep incline of the walk itself - there are hundreds upon hundreds of steps - mostly naturally formed, which when combined with the atrocious conditions made this the toughest walk I have done on a mountain. You have to have a certan level of fitness to walk this - if this is your first mountain climb, it could well put you off doing others in the future as it is so tough.Anyway, we reached Pendang hut in mid afternoon - wet and cold and exhausted. I had a luke warm shower which was nice, and multiple cups of tea - I could feel my fingers about60 min later. It cleared up about dinner time and we had stunning views across to KK which was nice! It reamined clear for the rest of the night so we all got up at 1:30am to do the summit. Unfortunately, 30min into the accent, it rained again (heavily) and the mist came in, meaning we had to descend - no summit was reached on our climb, or the previous days...). Up again at 6:30am for a nice breakfast, and we descended the hill - with no rain! but overcast conditions. Unfortunately, I had strained tendons behind my left knee on Day 1 which meant a slow (and painful) descent, but my guide very helpfully gave me a knee brace to wear, and provided me with walking sticks (a real help !). I saw lots of squirrels at one stop, some neat fauna, and a lovely big red leech, with some good views at a handful of spots along the way. So - it became more of a physical and mental challenge rather than an experience to climb and enjoy the views, but I would recommend it to others, as in good weather, I think it would be fantastic!Tips:1. Book through Amazing Borneo Tours - very well organised and they take care of everything!2. Prepare for the worst weather!3. Make sure you have a pack liner for both inside and outside of your pack.4. Take 2 sets of spare clothes.5. Make sure you are physically prepared for a 4 - 5 hr climb up a steep incline on Day 1 - it is not easy!!!!"
890,Enjoyable,Mount Kinabalu is such a beautiful mountain! It's shrouded in beautiful mysteries. The climb was like a sacred pilgrimage. It was so peaceful to be on top of it.
891,alternative to mountain summit!,"What a way to celebrate my 50th birthday... climbing Low's Peak of Mount Kinabalu, SE Asia's highest peak!!! It was indeed an adventure for me being my first mountain to climb in my entire life!!! Everybody was surprised since ithis is not an easy climb for first timers! But yes... I did it!!! It was simple beautiful up there!!1 It's the highest peak that is doable even for a newbie like me as long as you're fit and detrmined to finish inspite of the long uphill climb! Indeed it was a smash!!! Take time out to climb Low's Peak and experience a once in a lifetime adventure!!!"
892,Amazing experience!,"My wife and I trekked Mount Kinabalu on the 2nd day of our trip to Borneo and I'm happy we decided to do it early on into our trip as it took us 3 days to recover!We're not experienced hikers, and we have to say that the trek was probably the most difficult thing we've ever done. The first day took about 6 hours to reach the lodge and the views are stunning. After a few hours sleep we got up again for the 2am (!) start to reach the peak for sunrise, the view from the peak was absolutely stunning!The 10 hour trek down was very difficult and took a lot longer than anticipated. Our guide was very helpful and I don't think we'd have made it without him!"
893,Amazing experience and love to conquer it again & again...,"I have been planning to go to Mount Kinabalu for almost a year, and take the oppurtunity to go with my old frens. They were 12 of us.We divided into two groups - The FAT team and FIT team.FAT team will starts via Mersilau and for 3days2nights packageFIT team will starts via Timpohon (I'm in this group) and 2days1night packageThe walk from KM0 to KM1.5 was fair then it starts to more steep all the way up to laban rata. It tooks us almost 7 hrs to reach Laban Rata...while team FAT took them almost 9 hrs. Had quick dinner and we move on to our dorm in Gunting Lagadan (200-300Meters from Laban Rata). In between the climb it was raining...a bit of challenging but it was fun...Nothing fancy abt the room, can fit in 4 people (not recommend for tall/big size figure). had to wake up around 2am for quick supper at Laban Rata..before off for another ~2.5km to Mount Kinabalu's peak. once reach on top, the view was so spectacular!!! Its really worth it, for all the efforts.."
894,Fantastic Experience,"This is NOT as easy as some of the websites make it out to be. BUT, it is doable by most people, as long as you are prepared to go a little bit out of your comfort zone physically. We did the 2D1N tour, and the view and sense of achievement on reaching the summit at dawn made the 8.7k absolutely worth it."
895,Great experience and majestic view,"Words can't express the feeling when you are at the peak of South East Asia where clouds are floating like an ocean around you. Thanks to Amazing Borneo for the amazing experience and service, my guide Henry did a wonderful job in guiding us till the peak. There are 2 trails to the rest house Laban Rata before you take the rest for the midnight hike to see sunrise, I would strongly recommend the Mesilau rather than Timpohon trail as you have more sight seeing of the wonderful nature, although is longer trail but you will be getting an extra certificate for that. Here's a helpful advice, try to reach the rest house before 4pm so that you still can enjoy a hot shower bath, anytime after that will be shower in cold water. Enjoy your adventure!"
896,Harder than expected but a fantastic experience.,A photographer's paradise and great for hiking. Hire a car and explore at your leisure. Take lots of food and drink and spend the day exploring the beautiful trails that snake their way round the park.
897,"Fantastic experience, well worth the aching legs!","Did it on February 3rd, 2013.  These are the most up to date prices for it (all in ringget):  15 for the park entry fee, 100 for a climbing permit, 7 for climbing insurance, 128 for the guide (this can be split between up to two people), 33 for the shuttle to the trailhead from park entrance (return fee included, this one is notrequired but recommended).  The bus from Kota Kinabalu is 20 one way, a dorm bed inside the park near the visitors center is 90 (I stayed 2km outside the park and only paid 30).  If you do the 2 day one night through Sutera Harbour (they are the ones who operate all the lodging inside the park) you get one night at Laban Rata, food, shuttle to tarilhead, permit, insurance, guide, and entry fee for 753 for one person.  1345 for two, 1938 for three, and 2552 for four.  Now for the actual climb, it will save you some time in the morning if you go to the office and fill out the paperwork the day before you start your climb.  You don't have to pay any of the fees (except the 15 RM entry fee) until the day of your climb.  They let a maximum of four people attempt it per day (I was the only one on my day), If you have three or four people then you will have to pay for two guides (this is only for the single day climbers).  They told me that if was raining at 6:50AM then don't bother even bother showing up to climb because they won't let you go.  You can not start the climb before 7:00AM (that's when the park opens), as it was even though everything went smoothly for me I didn't start hiking until 7:30AM.  They have several turn around times for the climb, you have to reach Laban Rata NLT 12:00, and you have to reach the summit NLT 1:00PM or else your guide will turn you back.  That being said if it takes you until noon to reach Laban Rata you have no chance to reach the summitbefore 1:00.  My guide recommended 10:30AM as the target time to reach Laban Rata in order to reach the summit in time.I like to think that I'm a little fit (thru hiked the AT 2010, PCT 2012) and it took my 2 1/2 hours to reach Laban Rata and another 2 1/2 hours from there to the top.  Only took 3 3/4 hours to descend all the way back to the bottom.  I was in time to catch the 5:00PM bus back to Kota Kinabalu that very night.  If you want to spend the night at Laban Rata it will cost over 500 RM per person.  Although it rains almost everyday, its usually only during the afternoon, at least this time of year.  The distance round trip is about 17.4 km and the elevation gain is about 2,200 meters."
898,Borneo's Himalayas,"In a place like Sabah which is packed with marvelous things to do, I think that Mount Kinabalu is perhaps the most memorable. Our first view of the mountain was at a rest stop on the way from KK. We were looking out at a series of high peaks below a layer of cloud and asked out guide which was the one we would be climbing. He replied ""No, not the little ones, the big one"" and pointed stright up in the air. To our amazement there was a hugh peak above the cloud layers looming terrifyingly over us. We must have all looked stunned becase the guide burst out laughing and told us not to worry becase if we needed a stretcher down they charged 350 Malasian ringets a kilo body weight (about £70/kg, or $50/pound).We stayed overnight and next morning met our climb guide. He made sure we had all the required kit and added walking poles to what we had. We then started to climb and managed the section to the overnight accommadation at 3200 meters in about 5 hours. The views along the way are spectacular when you can take enough time off form trying to find your stepping places to look. The climb is a mixture of slopes, steps and scrambles. It is tireing but quite doable even if you are nearly 70 like me. The guide will carry your pack if you want. This is not an imposition on them as there is a fixed charge of 5 ringits a kilo and they like the pay. Amazingly you see porters passing you carrying loads of 30kgs up to the overnight accomodation so that you can get fed. The huts where you stay are fairly basic but fully adequate and the food at the restaurunt is filling in the way needed for continung the climb.Be prepared for a 1.30 call for an early first breabfast to be away by about 2.30.  The next part of the climb is in darkness so you dont get the views on the way up. They warn you about the cold on the top but nobody belives it so evrybody ends up desperately cold waiting for the dawn. It is only about freezing but the wind chill factor is what is so killing. If you do the climb take a woolly hat and gloves. Our fantastic guide gave his gloves to my daughter becase she was suffering.  You get the views on the way down to the huts again.After breakfast you start the major journey back down. I found this much more difficult than the way up. This is where walking ples are a must. by the end I could hardly keep my balance becase my legs were so tired.The feeling of achievement is wonderful and all the excersions worth while. You will remember it for ever. Fit in a climb if you possible can, you wont regret it."
899,"Tough, but definitely worth it!","Mt.Kinabalu is gorgeous..no doubt..but in recent years they have increased the price of climbling to such a high amount that..really its beyod most people..i met many malaysians who have and will never climb it because of the huge price for it.I paid 2100 ringitt being a non-malaysian, keep in mind if it rains the next morning u are not allowed to climb the peak..and no refund..thats a huge amount.also amazing borneo charges for drinking water when u stop for the night at 20 ringiit a small bottle..although i was happy with my climb i feel the malaysian govt is overall treating tourism as a golden goose and not looking at it long term, im glad i did it..but dont think il be coming back to malaysia to travel with other options in S.asia available."
900,The stair way to heaven (or hell),"Come on! This is Mount Kinabalu. The 4th highest peak in Asia! If you're in the region, how can you possibly not want to climb it?!So its tough for some but believe me, the sheer awesomeness of the mountain, the breath taking and jaw dropping views makes it worth every sweat.Do it!"
901,"Yes it's tough, but you can do it!","My first views of Mount Kinabalu were at the lookout at Nabulu, towering over other mountains and the villages on or near it`s slopes. Viewing Mount Kinabalu unfortunately is very much influenced by the weather, that can change very quickly. Some research into best times/months to visit would enhance your trip. Highly recommended !"
902,check out what your in for before you commit,"A week before the trip, I had some bad flu and thought I might not be able to ascend to summit. Since I was already there and gave my best. It's more like a steep hike than climb. Fortunately there wasn't much rain and I actually recovered during the climb. Awesome above the clouds view and was pretty surprised that Laban Rata served great buffet dinner! Strongly recommend any reasonably fit person to do this."
903,great natural park,"Literally this is a 'walk in the park' but metaphorically... nuh-uh. It can be sold by tour companies as a fairly straightforward hike, however the incline is severe, the steps are a killer, and the altitude is definitely a factor. Do some training beforehand and take some walking poles (they can be rented at the park) to help lessen the impact of the steps on the descent. If you do that you might be rewarded with a spectacular view at the summit. Well worth the effort but maybe a little overpriced these days."
904,Climbing and climbing,"Yeah... The view is breathtaking.... Beautiful scenery and you can sight many beautiful birds and no doubt it’s like heaven for bird lovers. There are few restaurants as well where you can have meals. There is also a small shop to purchase souvenir. And most importantly, make sure you have an Umbrella with you or a Rain coat… You never know when its going to be rain over here…."
905,Extremely hard,"It costs on average at least RM1500-RM2000 to climb Mount Kinabalu on a per person basis.The cost, about RM500 is absorbed by the park services via permits, guide fees, insurance and bus transfer fees to/from the entrance to climb the mountain and back.The vast majority of the amount paid to climb the mountain goes towards Sutera Sanctuary Lodges who run the rest house at Laban Rata and charge a ridicilous amount on a per person basis to stay there and you are forced to buy meals from them (DINNER/BREAKFAST/BREAKFAST).The mountain climb is great but a hard climb so do come prepared and make sure you also come with the right gear and right shoes as the weather can change very fast and it can be nice and sunny one minute, cold, wet and rainining the next with temperatures dropping to 1-3 degrees celcius.Temperatures on the summit are also iffy..it can be a cool morning or a super cold morning so be aware.The climb itself takes about 5-7 hours from the main gates up to Laban Rata covering about 8 kilometers of uphill climbing and then a further 2-3 hours to cover 3-4 kilometers to the actual summit.You stop at the laban rata for a rest and dinner/breakfast before climbing to the summit at 2.00am or 3.00am (depending on if your guide thinks your fitness and speed is too slow) to get up to the summit before sunrise.There is a cut off time of 7.00am for all climbers to get up to the summit.The climb down is by far the tougher part of the entire journey as your knees and ankles are sore and tired from the previous day's climb and take a bit of a battering on the downhill section all the way to the main gates.I highly recommend hiring a porter to carry your main pack and for you to carry only the basics you need on your back. We went up this week and temperatures were in the 40 degree celcius mark due to a heat wave climbing up. But it rained in the afternoon and temperatures dropped down to a cool 18 degrees celcius before we got to laban rata."
906,"Oh, the summit!","Like most people, I've read the reviews but wanted to give my own perspective. Today is Sunday and I did my climb on Wednesday/Thursday and my legs still ache now! I'm no fitness freak but I'm not a couch potato either, I run 30-40km per week, cycle 100-160km per week and swim up to 6km per week but this climb uses your legs in a different way to normal activity. The climb is technically simple, no abseiling, yes, there is a rope to assist in the climb to the summit but if your shoes/boots have really good grip, you'll only need to use it a couple of times and your guide will advise you of this. Make no mistake though, the climb is physically very demanding for most, I left Laban Rata at 3am, one of the last and made it up for sunrise, there were many that left before 2:30 and didn't, you are talking of nearly 7500ft of ascent on a 5mile walk, for perspective to U.K. climbers snowdon is 3000ft in a roughly 4 mile walk. The steepness dictates that virtually all the walk is defined by a large number on stairs or rock/boulder step sections in order to gain altitude and this is what takes its toll on your legs, so if you want to prepare, go to the gym for a few months prior and do some strength work an the knees. Do not underestimate the walk back down, that was the hardest part for me. With regards to weather, choose your time of year to climb, all the locals told us it was monsoon season in July and it rained in Kota Kinabalu nearly every day we were there, the summit on the day before and after me were cloudy so I was lucky on my climb to get good viewsFinally, just to respond to some of the negative reviews, yes the shop is relatively expensive and the food selection isn't the greatest, but, everything you eat and drink has to be carried up the mountain by a man or woman, no vehicles, no pack animal, no helicopter drops so don't expect cheap prices and a massive selection to eat, the food is perfectly adequate for the 24-30hrs you're up there, I took additional high5 bars and SIS hydration tablets to add to water to help boost energy/re-hydrationThe sensation you feel as the mountain reveals its form at sunrise is truly amazing, make sure you go into this climb with your eyes open"
907,gruelling climb,"If you are fit and well enough and are planning to visit Borneo you MUST climb Mt Kinabalu.   The best experience of our holiday and one of the best experiences of our life.Every climber or group is issued with a guide and it pays to listen to him/her - they are experienced with the mountain.Don't take up too much gear - you don't need it.   Just a change of hiking clothes and warm gear for the summit plus a rain coat for if it rains.  It didn't rain for us.  Plenty of water as it gets hot.The food is nice at Ratan Laba but just a tip - if you are gluten free take your own bread with you or you will be hungry.  It is a wheat lovers paradise up there.   Yes there are eggs, rice and fruit and that's about it.   All the sauces etc are thickened with wheat/gluten and the Malayans don't understand the meaning of GF.  That is all good as long as you are prepared.    I coped but was sick for a couple of days - ate the rice noodles oops - I was really hungry....Take warm clothes for the summit - good pair of gloves.  Don't leave too early for the summit - trust your guide as to his estimation of your fitness as to when to leave.  We stayed up on the summit for an hour waiting for the sun rise and it was freezing.Take a pair of walking sticks.    Don't argue with me just do it - unless you are an elite trail runner you are going to get the shakes.  Your quads and calves will thank you for it at the bottom of the mountain.Oh and the lunch at the bottom of the mountain - forget it - better off refuelling somewhere else.Take a good camera and memorax as much as you can.  You can never take too many photos.   The scenery blows your mind.   What an experience.    The easiest way to climb into high altitude and so worth it.Finally - we went to the pharmacy and purchased high altitude (Diomox) tablets to help us with the climb.  The climb is an expensive exercise and we wanted a security blanket that we would be ok.   And we were - I have a heart arrhythmia and even then I did not have a problem at all.   Well worth it.     And the expense of the climb was worth it too - it provides the community with employment and keeps the park in good condition.  So worth it on so many levels.Go on - do it! ;)"
908,a must do of everyone at least once,"We booked a car for all of us and just drove a long the way to Kinabalu park, where we can also see the peak of the Mount Kinabalu. I was so surprised that the road was in a very good condition and not crowded. There are a lot of hotels along the way, and we stopped in Kinabalu park to have lunch.The weather was cool and windy up there, please remember to bring your jacket. The view is so beautiful, with hills, valley, jungle around that gives you the feeling that you are somewhere in Europe rather than in Asia.Next time I visit Sabah, I will stay at least 4 days in Mount Kinabalu area itself so that I can explore more this area!"
909,Great for enegetic walking,"Browsing through my album, I saw my Kinabalu trip album. And thinking of doing a review. The trail is currently close due to maintenance after recent earthquake. 1. Book your trip in advance. The package will include 3d2n stay in Sutera Harbour lodges. You can choose either to stay in A. Kinabalu Park (1st night) and Laban Rata (2nd night) or B. Laban Rata (1st night) and Poring hotspring.(2nd night)..The package will include accommodation, insurance, meal and guide. Porter services are not included in the package. You shall inform the park if you need porter.For B, you can either depart from city early in the morning directly to Kinabalu park or stay at surronding homestay which cost you less that rm50 per night/head.You will spend only 1 night at the mountain.2. Clean trails. The toilets need improvement though..It smell very bad..3. A lot of rest shed along the way... People will usually stop by at Layang2 hut for lunch...4. DAY 1 :Average pace : 6 hours from Kinabalu park to Laban Rata5. DAY 2 : Average pace. 3 hours from Laban Rata to summit and 4 hours from Laban Rata to Timpohon Gate. Make sure you arrive at Sayat2 gate before 5am.6. Beginner trail. But still mentally and physically challenging.7. Dont proceed to summit if : you are experiencing AMS, you are too tired which will lead to bad decision or judgement. Several people injure themselves because of this or it is raining and you are wearing not suitable shoes. 8. Enjoy the vieww!!!9. I am hoping to come back after the trail is open again to public!"
910,Best thing in Borneo,"I've summited Mount Kinabalu three times in the last ten years, and it is certainly one of the best activities I've ever engaged in, in any country I've been to. It's a relatively easy hike for the reward of the spectacular views from the summit, though one should certainly make sure they are up to the physical challenge of the climb. That being said, I'm not in great shape and I've managed to drag myself up to the summit three times.One downside is that in recent years the facilities have been privatized and taken out of the hands of Sabah Parks and given over to Sutera Harbour Resorts, which has jacked the prices by a staggering amount while doing absolutely nothing to justify the price increases. In the years since the transfer of ownership, the facilities have become run-down and filthy, and the washrooms no longer have hot water, which is problematic when it's only 10 degrees outside. Furthermore the food has gone downhill and there is no heat in the rooms, which again, after a long hike, both are nice to have.Despite all of that, it's still an amazing experience, with spectacular views and nature, helpful, friendly local guides, and a relatively easy hike, given the rewards at the top. If you come to Borneo, don't miss Kinabalu, but please, keep your clothes on at the summit!"
911,Summit,"We went to the park, not to climb, but to visit the botanical gardens. The collection includes many endemics. The walks are paved and some information signs are present__in English."
912,Mt KK in a day,Unless you get within range of Mt Kinabalu by about 8am you are unlikely to see the peak.  Usually it is shrouded in cloud later in the day.  The botanical gardens at the base of the mountain were a bit disappointing as not much out in flower but just bad time of the year.  Interesting visitor centre covering the mountain's climbing history and flora and fauna.
913,Mission accomplished,I will always come here with my parents to relax and to enjoy ourselves during the holidays. We like the view of Mount Kinabalu as well.
914,Brilliant,"The climb up Mount Kinabalu can either be considered easy or tough, depending on how much you love climbing stairs but the stairs here vary: it can be 'natural' stairs which are stepped ground/soil, wooden stairs, or rock face. It takes on average 6 hours to get to the Laban Rata/Pendant Hut base camp from the start point. Walk in a zig zag manner, take sips of drink and snack on something that will give you a power boost at every rest stop if you can, and utilise a walking stick! If you do intend to do via ferreta the next morning near the peak, you must reach base camp before 4pm. Do have a hearty dinner while looking at the sunrise at Laban Rata and sleep early (8pm) as you have a long day the next day. The journey to the peak starts around 2am the next day and it'll take you about 3 to 4 hours, depending on your fitness level. The terrain? After a long flight of stairs, the journey ahead is all inclined rock faces. My advice is to go slow but steady to avoid getting altitude sickness (a lot of people were vomitting about an hour after the climb as they were rushing up just to see the sunrise). Even if you can't catch the sunrise at the peak, the view is amazing from wherever you are since you're more than 3,000m above sea level!If you need help with your load, your guide can double up as porters for a fee but I'd rather you book a porter before the trip as your guide is already carrying his own load. There is also the option of leaving your luggage at the headquarters (near the entrance) for a small fee and only bringing only what you really need (valuables, jacket, drinks and snacks) for the hike."
915,Amazing Experience,"This trek was soooo much harder than I ever imagined. But soooo worth it! We were very lucky with the weather on the first part of the trek to the hostel. It's very steep in places and there's a lot of stairs. There is, however, a lot to look at and there's something magical going from jungle to mountain rocks. After resting for a few hours at the hostel it was time to dot he hardest part. We had very high winds so I think this made it all the more challenging. Be warned, you will need warm layers, a decent wind breaker, a head torch and warm gloves with grips! I wasn't prepared very well for the cold and that was the worst part for me..my hands were in agony. There are also ropes to pull yourself up a near vertical rock face (where the gloves come in). Reaching the top to watch sunrise was amazing and made it all worth it. Try not to think about getting back down..as daunting as it is just do it! Muscles heal and memories last forever !"
916,Awesome hiking experience,"Our family of four (two adults and two kids, aged 12 and 14) climbed MtKinabalu in July this year. It was really an experience we will remember! We booked the 3D2N climb via Amazing Borneo, which arranged the transport, permits, lodging/food and a guide. The first day we drove from Kota Kinabalu to Kinabalu Park and rested there. The next day we used 4.30 hr from Timpohon Gate to Laban Rata, just in time before the rain at 1400. After a nice shower (only cold water available, so we used the kettle to heat water), repacking and an early dinner, we went to sleep at 1900. Well, at least we rested some hours :-) At 0145 we woke up and had some breakfast. I should have avoided the heavy food, I did not feel quite well after eating. Still, who would, at this time of the day? At 0300 we headed for the summit. We used 2.30 hr, and were at the top 30 min before sunrise at 0600. After putting on more clothes and taking pictures, we headed back to Laban Rata. We used the same amount of time on the way down, mostly because there were a lot of nice photo opportunities. After one hour at Laban Rata (repacking and breakfast no.2), we started the last leg at 0930. At 1300 we were back at Timpohon Gate. Happy, hungry and tired. In fact, I fell asleep by the table in the restaurant at Kinabalu Park!Since this climb was part of a longer vacation/family trip, including several other activities and sunbathing, we used some time thinking about what to bring and how to organize the luggage. We had one checked luggage and one small backpack (cabin size) each on the flights to Borneo (4+4 items). Two of the checked luggages were large backpacks and two were suitcases. We repacked and left one suitcase at the hotel in KK, and we left one large backpack and the other suitcase at Kinabalu Park. We hired a porter, who carried the last large backpack (10 kg) to Laban Rata. In this backpack we put clothes for the summit climb and a minimum of toiletries for all four of us (approx 2.5 kg for each person). In addition to this, we carried a small backpack each with some food, water and raincoats. Amazing Borneo has a list of what to bring on their homepage, on which we made some small changes. Here are my recommendations.From Kinabalu Park to Laban Rata:Wear: Running shoes, hiking pants, singlet/T-shirt, walking pole. Apply sunscreen before you start to go.In a small backpack: packed lunch, 1 litre water, energy bars/chocolate/nuts, sunglasses, thin woolen T-shirt (short sleeved), breathable raincoat (lightweight goretex or similar), lightweight waterproof trousers, ID-tag and passport, money/credit card, camera in a separate plastic bag, toilet paper, pain killers, plaster. Use plastic bags inside the backpack and/or a waterproof bag outside the backpack. We did not need insect repellent. In the large backpack (carried by the porter): lightweight towel, toothbrush, earplugs (important!), one pair of underwear, woolen socks, another pair of running shoes, trousers, 2 thin woolen shirts (long sleeve) and a fleece, woolen long-Johns (for the kids), hat, gloves, scarf/buff, head torch, batteries.From Laban Rata to the summit and back:Wear: Running shoes, woolen socks, hiking pants, woolen long-Johns (kids), thin woolen shirt (long sleeve), breathable raincoat, head torch.In a small backpack: 0,5 l water, energy bars/chocolate/nuts, sunglasses, waterproof trousers, two thin woolen shirts and one fleece, hat, gloves, scarf/buff, ID-tag and passport, camera, toilet paper, pain killers, plaster. Use plastic bags and/or waterproof bag to protect from rain.Bear in mind that, as we live in Norway, we already have this gear for our everyday living. You do not need to buy expensive raincoats for this trip only. Concider, though, to buy some woolen underwear. Warm even when it gets wet from sweat. Do not go to extremes when it comes to shoes and headwear: do not use Converse/sandals/flip-flops, but you do not need heavy boots meant for Himalaya either. And you certainly do not need a thick balaclava+fur hat. We have seen it all. Running shoes, woolen socks, a light hat and a thin woolen buff or a scarf will do.Have a nice trip!"
917,Top of mountain is amazing,"if you want to experience the best of nature, Mount Kinabalu is highly recommended. The trail is not that very hard and established. the guide was also good that everything you need to know will be explained. I went up through JUNGLE JACK, and it provided the best experience. You will be provided with a comfortable place to stay and as well as all you need to bring in the climb will be provided. The place to stay in the mountain is also good, it is much advised to bring extra protection for the cold and be physically prepared before starting the climb. when conquering the summit in the morning, leave unnecessary things in the room so that you will not carry anything when you climb. Dont forget to bring camera to document everything."
918,great flora and stunning views,"Words cannot even begin to describe the enjoyment I endured indulging in the sheer beauty of Kinabalu National Park! The incremental change in vegetation as you climb from Park HQ (1800m) to Laban Rata (3200m) in one day is incredible and definitely kept the camera memory cards full! Walking along the trail through the misty lower montane rainforest to stunted alpine vegetation at higher elevations was a challenge trekking through thin air and some steeper trails. The options for the climb is to either push your bodies limit to climb in 2D1N but after spending 3D2N up on the mountain I realised that it helped break up the treks without having to summit and then walk all the way back down in one day. Keep an eye out for pitcher plants (Nepenthes), habituated montane bird species (including some endemics!), incredible flora and expansive views all the way from the coastline to inland Sabah. I recommend to stay with Pendant Hut as they were one of the only properties that offered drinking water, snacks, and informative climbing briefs. Will definitely be climbing Mt. K again soon!"
919,Unforgetable...!!,We kept to the easier walks and the botanical gardens and found this a remarkable place. The orchids and pitcher plants highlighted how precious is this place.
920,Great views,"First of all some info about pricing. There's two ways of booking the trip up the mountain: 1- you go to the park entrance and pay all the different fees yourself (park permit, food, accommodation, guide,...). You risk that the park permits are already distributed. That being said, when we climbed (february) it wasn't crowded at all and easy to arrange everything yourselves + you'll probably save around 400 MYR for 2 people. We didn't risk it and payed about 1.600 MYR in total (excl. Guide fee and transport to start point)We did the climb in two days (some do it in one day... But that's just crazy.. Unless you're in great shape). At the end if the first day you reach the base camp (Labun Rata). Accomodation at the base camp is basic (and not worth it's money).. But, the food is pretty good and you have a bed (and that's all you want at that moment).The second day we woke at 2am and started the final ascent to the top (4.095m). Us two and around 90 other climbers, pitch black and seeing nothing but a long row of headlights from your fellow travellers... A unique spectacle. We reached the top right before the most beautiful sunrise we've ever seen. Even though going down took us another 4,5 hours and our legs (especially the knees) were refusing to cooperate, we did it with a big smile on our face :).Although no specific mountaineering skills are required, it's an exhausting entreprise.This one, we will never forget. It was worth every step, rain shower, cold shiver and sore muscle."
921,Just do it,"This is without doubt the most physically demanding thing I have done but it is also the first time I have tried to climb a mountain. My 14 year old daughter did it with me. There is no doubt it is hard work and you should have a good level of fitness before trying it or at least be use to walking a lot. If you can make it to the top for sunrise, you will be in for a treat. It really is spectacular and something I will remember forever! A good tip is to make sure you have anti-inflammatory tablets/pills for afterwards. My knees and calves for a good 3 days were in bits."
922,OK trip,"Mount Kinabalu is recognized as a World Heritage Site and is worth the effort to reach the summit. Only 180(?) visitors are allowed on the mountain in one day, and each visitor requires a guide, whether it be individually or as a group. A stay at a rest house near the base is often recommended for acclimating, but it’s not necessary. (We stayed in the city). At the base, the guides walked us through storing our luggage, registering and getting our identification tags. We were then driven up to the trailhead where we needed to check in, with the help of our guide. We started hiking the Timpohon Trail at 9am. The journey was 6km of uneven, sometimes rather big, steps. It’s a steep climb with occasional (little) flat patches. No switchbacks. There are rest stops along the way (with toilets without toilet paper). At the end of 6km (we arrived at 4pm), everyone spends the night at the rest house with dinner at 4:30-7pm. We got up at 1:30am for supper and started hiking toward the summit at 2:30am. The hike is arduous and involves ropes at some points. Sunrise was at 6am, but not everyone made it to the summit by that time. The winds were strong at the summit, so those who summit took a breath, took a few photos and started heading down. We took tons of photos a bit below the summit. We returned to the rest house, had breakfast, rested a bit and headed down the mountain. Day 1- 6km visitor center to rest house Day 2- 6km round trip to/from summit + 6km down to the visitor center = 12km Bring rain ponchos and headlamps."
923,"Hard work, but well worth the effort!","It bucketed with rain when we did this, up and down. By great luck, it broke overnight and we were able to summit on a beautiful sunny morning, only for it to start raining again in time for our return from the Laban Rata huts.Yes the climb is expensive. No point moaning about it if you do want to do the climb.We found the food at LR to be fine, plentiful, and the staff friendly. Yes, drinks are expensive but some poor porter has to carry them up on his or her back. There is always plenty of hot water available - can't you survive a day without a beer? The buffet is good, hearty, and well-prepared.If you hike regularly or do other regular physical activity you won't find this difficult, unless the altitude affects you, but even so we found our legs pretty stiff for a few days afterwards. The rope sections are easy for anyone with a bit of confidence - young local school groups all go up and down so if they can do it, chances are you can! Still, I saw one guy fall on the way down because he was going too fast. He was lucky not to be hurt - take it easy!If you are not as fit as you might be, then the way to prepare for this is to put a load on your back and walk up flights of steps day in day out. The accommodation at LR - in the main hut, at least - was clean and comfortable. No hot water and nowhere really to get stuff dry, so bring a dry change of clothes with you."
924,Discovering Mersilau,"Yes!! We DID it??!!!It's the first time my husband and I have ever given mountain climbing a go??!!! And it's everything, AND more, than what's already been said about it??!!As other reviewers have mentioned, it's an expensive excercise, but you know what, money can't buy the great feelings of achievement!!!So, if you would like to go, just pay the money and do it??!!!!We booked with  Down Below Marine and Wildlife adventures without any problems. My husband is 61, and I'm 55 and I am SO very proud of us??!!!We like to think we are 'reasonably' fit for our ages, but the climb DID put us to the test??!! We didn't break any 'records' for the time it took, but on a personal level, it was very rewarding!! Yes, it's up, up and MORE up!!! Those steps, rocks, tree roots etc are seemingly endless???.......Finally standing in front of the ' infamous' Laban Rata was just AWESOME!!! ....... But then, there were the EXTRA steps up to Pendant Hut for our overnight stay!!......... But we got there!!!...... :) :)Pendant Hut is well organised, dorms with bunks, clean liners in sleeping bags (not that you will get a lot of sleep??!!) The bathroom is (cruelly??!!!) downstairs and it's even possible to have a warm shower, but of course there is no heating in the building!!! All shoes remain at the door and you just look for a pair of 'crocs' to wear while you are inside.For dinner that night, it's necessary to go back down to Laban Rata, but Pendant provides a snack before the climb to the summit, and a good breakfast after your return!! And cups of tea and water etc. Considering where you are, and the fact that EVERYTHING must be carried up, accommodation and food is fantastic!!!It's up by 2am, a quick bite, then your guide shows up, and off you go!!!You just join the que of head torches heading up the the boardwalk steps, and of course it's not long before the division between the fittest begins!! Everyone is very courteous, you become aware of people behind, and just stand to the side and let them pass!!! (In our case, that was MANY??!!! Ha! Ha!)Needless to say, we didn't make it right up to the summit in time for the sunrise, but that doesn't lessen the achievement!!!In fact, there are advantages for not getting up there early - the actual summit is a very small spot, so much so, it's necessary to line up and take turns for 'that photo'!!!And we didn't rush down!!! It's such an effort to get there, it's good to be 'in the moment' and take everything in??!! Ah yes!..... The getting down!!!.......For a start, I just couldn't believe we had climbed up and up and up??!!!And again, the going down became endless??!!...... Oh, the knees, they really took 'a beating'??!!!  I hobbled down like 'old grandma', but I DID it???!!!!Just remember, prepare properly (walking a lot of hills with a pack), other basic fitness excercise and of course some medication!!!! Ha! Ha!   We have experienced altitude in another country, so we used diamox, and I unfortunately suffer nausea with the altitude, so anti nausea meds for me were a must!Plenty of Glucodin too!!! Oh yes! A couple of voltaren at bed time back in KK, did wonders for tired aching muscles!!!!We were blessed with great weather, just a bit of drizzle on the first day, and again in the afternoon on the way down to Tymphon gate. Hi to all that climbed on 01/07/14!! Especially to the lovely Taiwanese couple and also another lovely couple from(?) that slept opposite!! And also the lovely couple from Hawthorn that we met in the bistro at Kinabalu park!! All those hours of effort paid off!!!! Hooray!!!!Would we do it again???.............Probably not??!! ............But there IS a volcano in Lombok that  looks like an interesting trek??!!!..........."
925,Worth the effort,"If you want to see Mount Kinabalu, you need a good guide. We found Yusuf (+60109264377). He was the 3rd fastest to the top in 2013. This man is in his mid 40's and still fit. He is rated No# 3 in Kato Kinabalu as a guide. We laughed all day to his dad jokes. He also supplied beer for the trip. The mountain is a site to see and beyond belief. It takes 2 hours drive to get there and 2 back. If you want to climb to the top, allow 6 hours and you need to be fit. That makes it a 12 hour day. The price ranges from RM500 and up per day for a group of 4.Thanks again Yusuf."
926,Visit to the park and short hike,Beautiful from so many angles. Waiting to get a glimpse of the peak as it is so often shrouded in cloud
927,Challenging but incredible,only a small bit of advise.. DO NOT let people tell you it's easy.. it is far from that. My wife and I are very fit and excersise regularly.. this climb was a definite challenge. it is not a high mountain standing at less than 14000 feet.. but its very technically challenging. and you MUST come prepared with the right equipment.. simple things like rain protection.. cold weather cloths as the top can get near 0c degrees.. also gloves for the tough parts of the climb.. water proof gloves... proper outdoor climbing/ extreme hiking shoes and so on.
928,Beautiful and picturesque mountain trek,"It has always been a dream to attempt to scale Mount Kinabalu, the highest peak in South East Asia and I am so honoured to have gotten the chance to. The ascent was not an easy one, and required a lot of training, stamina and mental strength. But the scenic view along every step of the way up to the summit, especially witnessing the sunrise and sunset, along with encountering the wildlife such as squirrels, really made me feel one with the nature and really made the entire experience worth every step. I went with Amazing Borneo and I must commend them for their professional and friendly services. They customised the entire hike according to my requirements and preferences and their guides were helpful and kind, making my climb a much more enjoyable one. Kudos to them!"
929,"Fabulous climb, here's what you really need to know","Great birding. Look up trip reports and e-bird information for more up to date info and lists. There's quite a few hiking trails of varying levels of difficulty. It's it too overdeveloped (paved roads throughout, many resorts, hotels, and hostels (all very expensive). The accommodation options are monopolized by Sutera lodges. We looked at their prices, in the low season of all times, and were very surprised as the cost. Stay outside the park and pay the $5 daily entry fee."
930,Mind over matter.,"This trip was on my list of things to do and I am glad to be able to strike it off my list.For all you guys planning to make a trip, let me share with you how I went about it.Firstly, decide when you want to go. For my party of five, we initially wanted to go in early April 2013. FYI, the entire climb has been privatized and is run by Sutera Sanctuary Lodges. In early December 2012, I called them and found that it is really not easy to get slots for five. We eventually settled with early March. After you have secured the climb, then you can book your air tickets.To get up to Mt Kinabalu, you have a choice of two routes: Timpohon Gate or Mesilau trail. The route via Mesilau is 2km longer. Do not think that because it is 2km longer, the route will be more gradual. No, sir. This trail has got more ups and downs because it goes through two ridges. This is definitely not an easy trail. I would actually recommend trying to get the Timpohon Gate route to conserve your energy.So, the package offered by Sutera is usually a 3D2N package. We felt we were fit enough so we chose to go via Mesilau. No, actually, we had no choice that's why we went via Mesilau. On the first day, we went to Kinabalu Park to get registered before heading over to Mesilau Nature Resort for the night. We chose the basic package which meant staying in hostels. The rooms are basically two double-decker beds. It gets quite cold especially at night. There are no heaters in the room but thankfully there is hot water. Dinner is provided and it is delicious.The next day, you get up to have breakfast before heading to the trail office. There, you will meet your guide who will bring you up to where you stay the second night, which is at Laban Rata. Here, you can hire porters who will charge you RM 10 per kilo. We hired porters to bring 20 kg of stuff up for us and believe you me, you want to have a porter.As I mentioned earlier, the Mesilau trail is very challenging. However, it is a very scenic trail as you cross several bridges, rivers, waterfalls. You also cross a helipad which gives you a great view. The distance from Mesilau Nature Resort to Laban Rata is 8km, but from Timpohon Gate it is 6km. The two trails merge at the 6km mark from Mesilau Nature Resort.Laban Rata is basically where you will stay the second night. Well, to be technically correct, Laban Rata is actually one of the buildings that you might stay. There are several buildings available which you will be assigned to. The mess hall/canteen/restaurant is at Laban Rata which makes it popular because you do not need to trek to your accommodation. Meals are served buffet-style and there is plenty of food to get your energy back up. We did not stay at Laban Rata but from what I hear, although the canteen area is heated, the rooms are not.We stayed at a dorm 150m up the route from Laban Rata called Gunting Lagadan. The 150m hike is tiring enough to make you not want to make unnecessary trips between the canteen and your Gunting Lagadan. Rooms in Gunting Lagadan are very small. There is only space for two double decker beds. As you can imagine, it gets very cramped and some people choose to do their packing/unpacking out along the corridor. The dorm is co-ed so you have showers for men and women. Water is NOT heated. In fact, it is freezing cold. Most people will try to get to bed by 7PM before it gets too cold and to wake up at about 2AM for the hike to the peak.Breakfast is served at Laban Rata at 2AM. We chose not to have breakfast because of the hike. So we had some dry rations i.e. biscuits and chocolates and made some hot coffee/Milo. As it will be pitch black, do bring a head lamp. Also, bring a jacket and gloves. You may not need so many layers of clothes initially but it gets colder as you head further up. The first 700m of the hike is similar to the previous day. A lot of steps. Then, you get to the ropes. By this time, the area is pretty much void of any vegetation. It is just granite and rocks. At some points you need to get on all fours to climb up. If you have moon light, the view is awesome up there. You get to look down at the lights in the town. See a trail of headlamps following you. See the clouds below you with some trees peeking through them. And up ahead, you will see the various peaks of Mt Kinabalu.You will know when you reach the top. This is where you need the many layers of clothes because you have no protection from the wind. We managed to time our climb pretty well, arriving at about 520AM with the sun rising at 550AM. Unfortunately, it was cloudy on the horizon so we did not have the spectacular sunrise we were hoping for.Once all the photo-taking is complete, it is time to head down. With daylight, you get to appreciate how high you really are and how steep a climb it was. We got back to our dorm at about 915AM, packed our stuff and headed to Laban Rata for breakfast. After breakfast, it was time to head down via Timpohon Gate.Apart from the obvious, I would recommend bringing the following:Poncho, headlamp, gloves, panadol (in case of altitude sickness), hiking pole, Milo, biscuits/chocolates, beanie.Last, but not least, bring a positive attitude and have enjoy the trek."
931,Scary but good fun,"Clean, cool weather made it nice. No hot water at Laban rata was tuff."
932,mixed feelings,"I apologise in advance for the length, but reaching summit has been a five-month goal of mine.My husband and I visited Kota Kinabalu 18 months ago. I remember meeting someone who had climbed the mountain and they looked knackered. “Why on earth would you choose to climb a mountain?” I thought.Fast forward to January 2012 My health was way below average, I was obese, my blood tests revealed I was at risk for Type 2 Diabetes and in general I didn’t do much exercise, unless you count walking to the fridge! So my new year’s resolution was to do something about it. Imagine if I could climb a mountain?!Pre-climb TrainingStarting February, I joined a gym started going four times a week. (I did cardio/weights twice a week as well as hired a Personal Trainer twice a week). On the weekends I would do the odd zumba class or walk the Steps up in the Dandenongs, Victoria. When I first did the Steps, I stopped four times including on the way up from the car park. Towards the end of June, I was walking up and down the Steps, three times non-stop with a 10kg weight in a backpack. With this new health regime, I managed to lose 15kgs.  I knew I was still overweight, but was a lot fitter and healthier than five months prior. Bring on that mountain!The Night BeforeWe hired a car through our hotel and made our way to the National Park. The drive took us around 1.5 hours. We were upgraded to the Lodges and stayed in a nice room with a warm shower. There were two reasons we chose to stay at the park, to acclimatise our bodies to altitude and to make an early start the next morning. Timophon Gate to Laban Rata ResthouseThe distance from Timophon Gate to Laban Rata is roughly 6km. They say on average it takes between 4-6 hours to Laban Rata, it took us 7 hours. I led the entire trip, as my husband is much fitter than I. Our guide, Alian, suggested the slowest person lead. I have no doubt my husband would’ve done it in far less time. The first three kilometres is through nice rainforest, similar to the Dandenongs. We had lunch at Layang Layang Hut. We found the next two kilometres hard. The steps were much higher and we were starting to feel sick. We had headaches and I was feeling nauseous. My husband vomited twice, he says it was a dodgy lunch, but it could have been altitude sickness. It was also this time that it started to rain.Laban RataWe stayed in the Buttercup Room which had two beds, a heater and a warm shower!! We managed to sleep and feel rested. To summitWe woke at 1.45am, ready to start at 2.30am. We dressed in thermals, tshirts/long pants, warm jackets, gloves and beanies. I found it really difficult to eat breakfast. I managed to swallow two slices of white bread, with some water. My husband ate noodles, eggs and bread. We put on our head torches and popped a few aspirin (just in case) and started. The walk started with a bunch of man-made steps. Some people decided to return to Laban Rata as they were feeling the effects of altitude sickness. We then had to use ropes and pull ourselves over rocks. I had one scary moment when I fell, but my trusty guide, Alian, was there to support me and help me figure where my next step should go. I must admit the next few hours were a bit of a blur. I was walking very, very slowly. Around 6am, we were almost at the 8.5km mark and I said to my husband, “Enough. I’ve had enough”. He convinced me to keep going and to reach summit was amazing! We had clear skies, a little bit of wind, however within 20-30 minutes, clouds started rolling in. We made it down to Laban Rata by 10.30am. We flew through the last 30 minutes as we had to check out and grab some breakfast. My legs were like jelly! (BTW it is 100RM per hour for late checkout from 11.30am) The staff were packing up breakfast, however managed to cook some eggs, pancakes and rice for us. I found it extremely hard to eat. Each mouthful I had to take a sip of water to force it down.We left Laban Rata at 11.45am and started our trek down. The first two kms we were both upbeat, positive and greeting all the climbers coming up. Around the 3km to go mark, I was tired, exhausted and feral. I was well and truly over it and just wanted a warm shower. Why couldn’t they have a flying fox down? It took us just over five hours to reach Timophon Gate.I don’t think I have ever pushed my body so hard. I am so proud of what I have achieved in the past five months and am still amazed that I climbed the 20th Most Prominent mountain in the world!! Other bits and piecesOur guide took a backpack with a change of clothes for 64RM. I believe each kilo is 8RM.A pair of walking poles is a must! They saved our knees – no pain at all.Preclimb training: Squats and lunges. Step onto a chair or an exercise bench – that’s the average step height.Snacks: Bananas (high in potassium), nuts and mars bars were nice treatsWater: we went through about 5 litres each. We mixed some with Hydralyte, for added energy.Waterproofing: Pack items in plastic/zip lock bagsToilets: at each rest point there are western toilets. Make sure you take some tissue/toilet paperAfter the trek: Grab a (free) hot shower at the Grace Hostel. Towels can be hired for 10RM. We drove home refreshed.It took two-three days for the pain in our legs to subside. My husband had sore calves, I had sore quads. I also managed to get a blood blister under my big toenail, which I am going to get the doctor to drain. Make sure you cut your toenails and have correct fitting footwear. On the way up I retied my shoelaces twice. On the way down, I should have done this more often."
933,A photograher's paradise,"Leave nothing but Footprint.Take nothing but Photograph.Leave nothing but memory.You either enjoy it the first time round, or give yourself a few reasons to do better the next time round. but to think about it, why not just do it right the first time?I highly recommend that you getA good Pair of Gore-tex shoe, a set of OuterShell in case it rain. (honestly no one know the weather but they are saying October is the best) A good Water resistant bag with rain cover attach to it.lastly, A good camera to capture all the moment."
934,Memorable Experience,"Climbing Mount Kinabalu is the best moment in my life. It is like a dream come true for me. First & foremost, to climb Mount Kinabalu you must register with Sabah Park at least 6 month from your climbing date. So,my advise is don't buy your flight ticket yet, confirm your climbing date with Sabah Park first.Me & my team members book a 2days1night stay at PanaLaban (previous name Laban Rata). Our package includes stay at Lemaing Hut+Dinner+Supper & Breakfast.On our 1st day climb we manage to start at 8.30am after our guide Mr Johny (Sabah Park Guide) give a short brief about trail to PanaLaban.We must walk about 6km to reach PanaLaban. There are shelter every 1km of walking.1) Pondok Ubah2) Pondok Kandis3) Pondok Lowii4) Pondok Mempening5) Pondok Layang-layang (we lunch here)6) Pondok Villaosa7) Pondok PakaMe & my team manage to reach PanaLaban at 4.00pm. Then we go directly to Lemaing Hut for check-in. We go for dinner at 4.30pm & then rest. Me & my team wake up at 1.00am for supper & get ready for the next climb to the peak. After a short brief with our guide, we start hike at 2.45am. We must climb & walk about 2.6km & must reach Sayat-sayat checkpoint before 5.30am. After a long hike & walking, we manage to reach Sayat-sayat at 5.00am & continue hike about 1.6km to the peak.We finally reach the peak 6.30am. There is magnificent & amazing view for us to watch. I really thanks to God that all of my team manage to reach the peak & enjoy the happiness together. This is a best moment for me & will be memorable for lifetime."
935,Harder than Expected,"We stayed at Perkasa Hotel, Kundasang, Sabah for the spectacular view of Mount Kinabalu and also another awesome view at Pekan Nabalu. Best tine to view is between 6.30am to 8.00am."
936,Tough going!,"Hiking Mt. Kinabalu: This review is written for hikers who have an above-average level of fitness and wish to enjoy the pristine outdoors and hopefully avoid some of the congestion and noise levels that are so much a part of Asia.Mt. Kinabalu (13,435 ft) is the highest peak in South-East Asia. Located in the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of Borneo, the mountain is a granite massif that rises from the tropical rainforest to above treeline and into the clouds. The mountain is part of a national park and therefore has a visitor's center, set hours and charges a fee. They also require you to hike with a guide. The park opens around 8AM and it is recommended that you arrive before they open so that you can get your permit and be on your way before the crowd. It also allows you to be a little selective in choosing your guide.The trail is very well-built although it is very steep with tall steps that help you gain altitude faster but make for a less enjoyable hike. It is however, a very popular outing among school and activity groups. During the high season, it gets extremely congested which makes it difficult for faster hikers to make headway due to the narrowness of the trail.The best months to climb, weather-wise, are February, March, April. It is best to avoid the school holidays for schools in Malaysia and neighboring Singapore. Most people take 2 days to summit. The first day is spent walking up to the guest house at Laban Rata where there is lodging and food. The guesthouse is a 2-storey concrete building with all the modern amenities so there is no need to bring your own sleeping bag, tent or food (other than snacks for the hike up). Most hikers start out at 3 or 4AM to hike up to the summit to watch the sun rise.For those who are fit, I recommend hiking to the summit on day 1 to watch the sunset. The benefit of this is that you will most likely be the only one on the summit at that time and not have to share that precious little piece of real estate with 50 other hikers, including teenagers with their electronic devices, smokers and residents of overcrowded Asian cities to whom yelling is considered normal conversation. After viewing the sunset, it is a an easy, leisurely walk downhill to the guesthouse to spend the night. Be sure to have a headlamp for each hiker. The next morning, you can have a leisurely breakfast and hike back down to the visitor center while the crowd is still descending from the summit."
937,Most memorable experience on mountain climbing,"If you love hiking, you should not miss Mount Kinabalu. You can see many beautiful fauna along the way from Timpohon Gate to the top of the mountain. Some of them is rare to see another place. Please do exercise before coming here. It is not easy as you think even the national park arranges the good condition of stairs for tourists. I deduct 1 stars out because of the too expensive room rate at Laban Rata Resthouse. Do not miss the above cloud experience!"
938,Great fun.,"When booking from Australia we had some troubles trying to locate a company that had vacancies. Rightly so, the Malaysian government limit the amount of climbers on the mountain. (In my opinion, when you are at the top, it's to many.)Don't bother trying to find cheaper companies to climb with, it's a set price. You can however ask for added extras, such as free shuttle pick up from hotel.Allow time to register at the base and meet your guide. My advice, start the climb as early as you can on both mornings, the track becomes rather congested. On the second morning try and stay infront of the mass crowd as it makes it safer when climbing the ropes section and the view is not obstructed. If you wish to have a hot shower in the overnight lodge, be the first one in, as the hot water is very limited. You only require a standard winter jumper and maybe a wind cheater in your back pack, a beanie and gloves are a must. If you have a camel back, it would be helpful although not essential. The most important advice, hold the rope where it is provided, we watched a Korean man almost meet his maker after falling a substantial way, break two limbs and lose a few teeth. If you hold the rope you will be fine, however if you have a fear of heights it will be rather challenging in parts. Pretraining- steps and more steps. The hardest part on the body was the return walk, constant impact on joints. Do not plan anything other than a nightime massage and spa on the final afternoon."
939,An amazing physical and mental challenge. Worth it!,"was a really good day out, but make sure you bring a light t shirt to put on and maybe a hat, the sun is very strong and can get very hot."
940,Very good trip and excellent guide provided.,They charge foreigners more than the locals to enter the park. Make sure you keep your ticket as you can use it to enter the Pooring hot springs.
941,Great Experience well worth doing,"We started at 9.15 on the first morning and made it to Laban Rata by 3pm, our group consisted of 8 people between 14 and 65 years old. The next morning we left at 2.15 and made it to the summit by 5.50, and the sun rose at 5.58. The climb is strenuous. I am fit and in my forties, and I trained for this climb.  This is not technically challenging, although it is steep and there are parts you need to pull yourself up by ropes. It seems neverending in some places. The trick is to go slow. The trip back down in one day is a killer on the knees, we used trekking poles. Overall, an amazing experience. Dont expect to sleep at Laban Rata, there s carousing in the halls, and when they shut that down, it returns outside."
942,The most beautiful mountain sightseeing trip!,"I'm approaching 30 and in decent enough shape, and when I had a few extra days to enjoy myself between jobs I decided to attempt Mt. Kinabalu.  I expected a challenge and thought it would be no problem to conquer the mountain in a single day.  Don't trust what you read in guidebooks: this mountain is HUGE, DAUNTING and TERRIFYING.  The first 6k of the climb to Laban Rata is relatively doable but you'll be panting and your legs will be burning.  The first section took me just over 3 hours.  The next 2.5k moves up hundred of stairs until you reach a sheer granite cliff which slides at a 45 degree angle into oblivion.  A strong rope provides the needed support to clamor up the steepest sections.  Don't look down or your heart will race even faster.  To crest the summit required another 2.5 hours for me from Laban Rata.  The top of the mountain was like nowhere I've been before.  Most incredible was the silence - all you can hear is the wind and the sound of your heart beating in your ears.  It was surreal, moving and truly memorable.  Unfortunately, the descent was, in a word, awful.  Each steps pounds the ankles and knees, and I could feel my legs becoming weaker and weaker.  It took another 4 hours to descend; I admittedly wasn't using any hiking poles which probably could have made it a little easier.  Overall I would say that if you are young and truly want to test yourself, this is quite a journey.  I'd say you need to be above-average in terms of fitness level and that you're ready to conquer your fears.  It's an unbelievable accomplishment but I can't recommend finishing in a single day given how strenuous the descent was.  One reviewer said ""Only do this if you are young and crazy!""  I have to agree."
943,Kinabalu park,"Fantastic experience... highly recommend but don't underestimate how difficult it is. It was definitely not a ""walk in the park"""
944,It's awesome..I will climb again on 29 Dec 2012 for the sixth time,"I ascended to Laban Rata (3272.3 m) of Mt. Kinabalu via Mesilau Trail. My mountain guide said normal fit people would take around 8 hours to reach Laban Rata. But I took 10 hours to reach Laban Rata. I did carry around 7-8kg backpack from Mesilau. Whilst in Mesilau trail, I didn't really feel the pain of carrying that weight since I'm quite used of backpacking in long distance. But hiking on extremely steep 1.5 km trail towards Laban Rata with that weight, it's draining my energy & I can feel the bagpack was pulling me downward. Anyway, the Mesilau trail is very unique. We can see a lot of Nephentes species (monkey cup), chip-munks & beautiful flowers. The scenery at each shelter along the trail were also wonderful.1.5 km from the Timpohon/Mesilau junction towards Laban Rata is extremely steep.Advice for those who want to hike this trail:1. Wear comfortable, hard soles shoes (it must be light). or else, when it's raining your shoes will soak.2. Always bring your torchlight & make sure it's functioning. Because you may reach Laban Rata when it's already dark. My torchlight not functioning when I was about 500 m from Laban Rata (in darkness). It's really dangerous with the steep trail. (God must have save me, phewh!)3. Pack lightly. Carry only about 2-3 kg. Others, leave it to porter (of course with a sum of money). I would recommend you to bring glucose sachets instead of isotonic drinks. You may need extra energy with little weight. My sister not used to carry 5-6kg backpack & she took 11 hours to complete the trail in pain (with help from our mountain guide who help to carry her backpack)4. Don't rush to hike, take about 2-3 minutes at each shelter to breath properly for height acclimatization. You may not want to vomit anything while hiking.When you're descending through Timpohon trail:1. Take breakfast early 1-2 hours before descending. 2. Wear thick socks, because the way down was extremely steep. It was raining heavily when I descended from Laban Rata. If you're not careful, you can suffer scrapped nails.Because this is my 1st time hiking Mt.Kinabalu, I didn't make to the summit because I haven't see the Timpohon trail yet. This is indeed my best hiking trip. My cup of tea is still to ascend towards Laban Rata through Mesilau. Next time what I can do differently, maybe engage a porter to carry my stuffs & try to the Summit."
945,Amazing life achievement - You believe you can... you can!,"Strenuous and trying, but at the end of the day, it is the mental preparation that brings me up to the apex. The physical pains and strains, could not be compared to the success and satisfaction at the peak."
946,The Everst trip is off,"We were a group of reasonably fit people, Katie, Sarah, Hennie and myaelf, ranging in age from 24 - 51. We organised our trip through Best Borneo and were very happy with the service provided. I couldn't imagine having to organise a taxi back to KK after the gruelling descent! We arrived at Timpohon Gate at 10 and started climbing on the via Ferrata. It was a shock to realize how the steep climb begins immediately. Keep your raincoat in an accessible place, because it will rain! A big rain poncho to cover you and your backpack is good. By the time we reached Layang Layang 2 hours later, I could read only concern in our lovely guide, Yarbis' eyes whenever he looked at me! I had serious misgivings about reaching the summit! We reached Laban Rata 4 hours later. You won't believe how long it takes to walk 1km! We loved Laban Rata. The 4 of us shared a room with clean bedding and the shared bathrooms were clean. The food was tasty and plentiful. There was no hot water, but that didn't matter to us :-) the views were spectacular! When I looked up, my heart was in my mouth and we discussed my remaining at Laban Rata while the rest of the group climbed to the summit. I decided to try at least. The climb to the summit turned out to be the highlight of the trip. We set off at 2.50. We took it slowly initially. Gloves and a warm hat are important, but you don't need too many warm clothes - 2 layers and a good jacket will do. The rope part of the climb is a welcome change to the monotony of the first hour of stairs. It took us just over 3 hours to get close to the summit. After that, it's a manageable rock climb of about 70m or so to the top. The views and sunrise are amazing from anywhere near the summit, so don't put pressure on yourself to be on the summit before sunrise. The climb down to Laban Rata took about 2 hours with photo stops. We had  breakfast and started down at 10. The first 2kms were bearable, but after that it seemed to take an eternity between each half km. Mild injuries became extremely painful with each step and it was a rather miserable 4kms to the end. Am I glad that I did it - a resounding yes! Would I do it again? Probably not..."
947,beautiful site,"Rest in peace for those who perished.Mount Kinabalu is definitely a magical place. You'd go from tropical rain forest below, to barren landscape near the summit.On the first day, try conserve your energy as much as possible. No rushing. Because the next day is when the real challenge begins. When you wake up at 2am in the morning for the summit, with barely any sleep because of the high altitude, you'd wish you had not competed with the guy ahead of you. (Me? I did no such thing.) But for those who signed up for the Via Ferrata circuits, you need to be there for the safety briefing by 4pm.Try not to eat a lot (buffet dinner hurray!) and turn in early. It might be hard to fall asleep. For me and my friends, we could feel our heart pounding almost constantly. And whenever I'm about to fall asleep, I felt like I couldn't breathe and woke up gasping for air.The night climb is not too bad, almost easy in the beginning. But once you've passed the check point, it gets harder and harder. At one point I couldn't walk 50m without stopping to catch my breath. By the way I was quite confident with my body since I ran a lot, but it doesn't really matter I guess. It's just how your body reacts when deprived of oxygen. I saw a few guys walking in a zig-zag fashion on the bare rock rather smoothly, but i didn't look into that afterwards. Might be worth trying.There's an interesting trick I'd encourage you to try. While standing along the bare ridge, find a corner away from the crowd, or it just so happened that there's a considerable distance between you and the ones ahead and behind you, turn off your head lamp. And just be still.Try reach the summit before 630am. That's around the time of sunrise. Franky it was not really that special. I would say the whole experience is worth more than that.Afterwards, its either the normal descend or the Via Ferrata circuit. For those who have signed or planning to sign up the Low's Peak Circuit, you are looking at a 4 to 5 hours cliff hanging fun. Plus a trek trough the wood-with-no-road. Awesome! (I must not be the only one who suffered!)When you finally get back to Laban Rata, you'll find everybody gone, and their left over lunch. Your lunch I mean. Embrace another 4 hours descend and don't throw up on the bus home. (I swear this really wasn't me!)Anyway, thanks for reading such a long review and have a great time there."
948,Well worth visiting,"I have to admit, when my husband and I read the reviews of people saying it was a tough hike, we kind of ignored them. We both run triathlons and marathons and just figured that we were in better shape than most of the reviewers (sorry!!). So if you're like us - just know that it's hard! I wouldn't go so far to say that it's as physically challenging as a marathon, but it's no walk in the park either.Here are some tips in no random order:* You MUST book the Laban Rata hut ahead of time. We booked 4 weeks in advance and some of the days were already full. Just call them and they'll email you the ""official"" reservation form. * Definitely pay a little bit extra to hike up Mesilau. You have to drive an extra 40 minutes (that's why you pay a little more) to the trail head, but the it's really worth it. 1) the scenery is way cooler, 2) there are less people, 3) you'll go down the normal way so this way you can see both trails. * It's COLD at the summit at sunrise. I had a thermal, a fleece, a soft shell and my rain jacket and I was still chilly. Bring good outdoor clothing.* Gauge how long it took you to get to Laban Rata compared to the estimated time. If you were  a lot faster, don't be afraid to leave later than everyone the next morning. You do not want to get to the summit too early and be stuck waiting there for sunrise. We were there for 25 minutes huddled at the top with everyone wishing we had started hiking later.* Going down is BRUTAL on your knees. If you can get hiking poles or a stick to absorb some of the shock, do it. And don't make too many plans for the next couple of days. Seriously, your knees will thank you.* Skip the hot springs. They were really weird and far from a relaxing post-mountain climb.* Have fun! The scenery was seriously unbelievable."
949,My trip report of Mt Kinabalu (v. long - sorry),"The views were breathtaking and if you enjoy mountain climbing, you will absolutely love it. Porters are available if you would like to pay them to carry some of your things up the mountain. I decided not to climb to the summit as I was happy with the level I had reached but others in my group loved the experience. I found the descent easier than the climb which was probably due to technique rather than fitness as lots of people found going down the mountain hard on the knees. Our legs were sore for a few days afterwards!"
950,An awesome experience,"By far, the most extraordinary thing that I've done in my 29 years of existence! Definitely worth-it! You should bring with you DETERMINATION, FAITH,  and ENDURANCE. Yes it is doable  even for inexperienced climbers but you definitely need to be fit. We registered for a 2-day hike that starts from 7 am. Then depending on your pace, you'll reach PANALABAN HUTS for dinner and rest, until you make the last ascend to the summit around 2:30 after supper. SUGGESTIONS:- warm yourselves up before making the climb. Jog everyday or at least have a brisk walk.- travel light.- bring headlamp, waterproof gloves, or waking sticks.- never forget to bring cameras, to record your once in a lifetime experience!- they said march is the best month to climb.- August is a rainy season.- Amazing Borneo is recommended.- they'll issue a certificate"
951,Altitude affects even the fittest,Just stop here on the way to poring. Amazing kinabalu!!! Allah creatures!!! Fresh air n smells like rempah. I play with docile squirrels...so happy.
952,Glad I Did it Now That I'm Done,Mount Kinabalu is the highest mountain in Southeast Asia and is one of the most popular ‘bucket list’ destinations in the world. Conquer the mountain give yourself a hard-earned pat on the back!
953,Best part of the trip,"Our family (me, my wife and 2 teenage sons) are absolutely thrilled to have made it to the top of Mount Kinabalu together to witness the majestic sunrise. We started our journey on 31 March and made it to the summit at sunrise on 01 April 2013. Here is a brief account of our journey together with our ""tips"" which, hopefully, will be useful to other fellow travelers who are planning to go.Travel from KK city to the park HQ will take about 1.5 hours and we arranged our transport  (to and from) through Sutera Sanctuary Lodges (SSL) who operate all the accommodations at Laban Rata. In fact, we made pretty much all the arrangements (including park permits, mountain guides, packed lunches etc.) through SSL. I'd like to take this opportunity to extend a big THANK YOU to Tisna of SSL ; she was extremely helpful, patient and responsive to my many questions over the phone. I strongly recommend you call and speak to SSL directly to make all the arrangements & bookings directly as they are really professional and useful.We arrived at the park HQ around 9 am and proceeded to the registration desk to confirm all the details including meeting our mountain guide who also doubled as our porter (to carry many of the things we will only require after we arrive at Laban Rata). After picking up our packed lunches from the restaurant at the park and taking a short bus ride to the starting point, we embarked on our great adventure at 10 am from the Timpohon Gate.Our journey from Timpohon Gate to Laban Rata took about 5 hours and we took every opportunity to take short 3-5 minute rests at every ""pondok"" (rest huts) along the trail. These pondoks are typically spaced about 700m - 900m apart and we kept ourselves well hydrated during each break (some of these breaks also served as a lunch break or a chocolate break !). The ""toughest"" stretch along the trail to Laban Rata is immediately after the pondok at Layang-Layang but it is also the home stretch to Laban Rata so keep your spirits up ! We arrived at Laban Rata at 3 pm & promptly proceeded to check-in for the night. TIPS : (a) Bring a good collapsable walking stick with you, (b) about 1.5 liters of water per person should be enough for this journey, (c) take it slow and steady, (d) no need to dress in warm clothes for this leg of the journey, (e) take the time to read the signs at each of the pondoks as they give you very useful information on what to expect next and (f) enjoy the view plus the flora & fauna.After settling into our room and cleaning ourselves up (only my youngest son braved the cold showers though !) and getting changed into clean clothes, we proceeded to have an early dinner at 5 pm in order to allow us to get to bed earlier that night. The food was very welcome, tasty & nutritious especially after the 5 hour hike up to Laban Rata. We walked around briefly after dinner and took many photos of the spectacular views of the clouds below us and the pending sunset but we were tired enough to hit the sack at around 6:30 pm to prepare for our 1:30 am alarm call ! TIPS : (a) expect the resthouse to be pretty noisy with all the excited climbers until about 9 pm when most people will be trying to sleep, (b) don't bother with bringing pajamas, just sleep in your clean climbing clothes, (c) bring toilet paper with you, (d) bring some panadol with you to help with any headaches that might be caused by altitude sickness.We woke up at 1:30 am, got ourselves ready for a quick breakfast and then met our guide at 2:45 am. You will need warm clothes (we each donned a t-shirt with a down ski-jacket plus long climbing pants, waterproof ski-gloves and a beanie), a head-torch, our cameras and a small bottle of water but did not bring the walking stick with us (big mistake !). The first part of the climb is pretty ""standard"" with stairs and some rocky stretches to walk up and we took it slow and easy as we had heard that the final part of the climb is the toughest and to allow our bodies to adjust to the early hours, the cold and altitude. It is after the Sayat-Sayat checkpoint where things got really hairy & interesting, requiring us to climb narrow ledges holding on to ropes AND the trail seemed to get even steeper ! As we started to see the first signs of sunrise peaking out at around 5:20 am, we started to pick up the pace to get through the final 500m which was bloody tough !  We finally made it to the summit at 5:40 am in time to witness the majesty & wonder of natures daily painting. The summit was pretty narrow (hello ?!) and therefore everyone was trying to stake our ""their""  piece of the summit to take the customary pictures etc. TIPS : (a) persevere on if you are in good health, (b) enjoy the night sky and landscape as it really makes one feel as if one is on another planet, (c) after taking important photos of yourself at the summit, climb down about 10 meters and take advantage of the ample space below to sit down and soak it all in (including snapping many many wonderful pictures of the sunrise and alien landscape below), (d) enjoy watching the view as the sun rises and just ""chill"" !  We started our descent from the summit at 6:30 am and this, for me, was the toughest part of the entire journey ! I wished we had brought our walking sticks as my knees were starting to feel jelly-like as the tough climb up and descent started to take its toll. We finally reached the Laban Rata rest house at 8:30 am and proceeded to get some more breakfast  and re-hydrate ourselves. After that, we collapsed our beds for a short nap before packing up and checking-out by 10:30 am. We started our final descent at 10:30 am after re-filling our water bottles in the dining room and was very glad for our walking sticks to help us along the way. We reached our starting point, Timpohon Gate, at 3 pm and hopped on the bus to take us back to the park HQ where our previously arranged taxi was waiting to take us back to KK. The next 2 days proved to be tough on our knees (muscles tight and aching) but it was a thoroughly enjoyable adventure made immeasurably more meaningful since we conquered the mountain together as a family. This will be a truly memorable event for us all and well worth the effort and pain.  TIPS for the ""older folks"" like me : (a) get fitter, (b) walk up 20 stories twice a day for at least 10 days before the climb, (c) Stop and smell the roses, (d) Enjoy !"
954,2  walking sticks -great guide,"I myself used to live in KK when I was very young.  My parents have carted us all the way up to the Mt Kinabalu resort many times when we were young. Back then, the roads were terrible and only 4WDs were capable of reaching Mt. Kinabalu Resort.This trip, the roads up were great.  The resort somewhat looks the same, but the air is very fresh and clean, and the view is still stunning.  We didn't make the climb to the peaks, and stayed only in the resort, which is still a great place to get-away.  The restaurant is managed by Sutera Harbour resort, so the food is still 5-star hotel class.  There's a botanical garden to view various species of plants and trees.  Theres also a few trails for us to walk into this cooling rainforest.I will recommend this to everyone going to Kota Kinabalu.  It's only 1h45min drive from KK town."
955,"Very expensive climb, but nice experience.","Obviously one would fare off better if they were in great shape. As someone who is young and in medium shape, I still found this extremely hard. We took the Mesilau trail,  the harder of the two. It was tough and mentally challenging as it seems like you aren't getting closer to base camp. The summit in the morning was more exciting but challenging. Not only are you lacking in sleep and in high altitudes b you ate climbing over boulders in the last 200m,after you've climbed uphill for 2.7 km. The accomplishment feels great and the views are stunning as well. However, just make sure you're doing what makes you happy. You can see great views from so many places on the rock face. Enjoy the sunrise. Bring sunscreen, water, and warm clothes for the summit. It is freezing up there and although you may only be there for a little bit before descending and warming up again, you'll want the layers while watching the sunrise. If staying at Laban Rata, beware of the exorbitant prices of the snacks and the lack of warm water."
956,Do the via ferrata if you're not afraid of heights!,"Our day at Kinabalu Park was spent hiking trails and visiting the Botanical Garden. We visited on a Monday, so it wasn't too crowded, and in fact, we had several trails to ourselves running into no one. Try to get a map of the trails when you enter the park as trekking them can be somewhat tricky, particularly when some parts end up being closed."
957,tough but is kind a life achievement.,"Make sure to visit Mt. Kinabalu - it is a heritage  site. The efforts at educating and preserving nature is palpable. Visit the botanical garden, the canooy walk, the poring hot spring, the 2 falls and take a peek at the Rafflesia. Day trip is enough for these activities. But minimum overnight if you'd want to visit the summit.  Suggest to have a local guide with you to maximize your visit. Some activities are not for those with medical condition ie canopy walk, hike to falls etc"
958,A summit at last,"Climbing Mount Kinabalu is probably one of the most physically (and perhaps mentally) demanding things I have ever done. A friend and I did a 2-day climb in March 2014 with very little advance planning. We were fortunate to have amazing weather, as the people who summitted the previous day had a miserable time.People joke that the climb from the base to Laban Rata (where you'll stay the night if you're doing the 2 day hike) is nature's stairmaster and they aren't kidding. It's basically 6km of high rugged steps,  intermingled with some light bouldering. We made it up in about 4 hours, with more frequent stops the higher we went. At the guest house they'll feed you -- and the buffet food is surprisingly good -- and you can buy snacks, beer, and other non-essentials that the hardy porters trek up the mountain. We watched the sunset and then crashed in the dorm-style beds we'd reserved.The second day you get up at 2AM, pound down some more food, and set off for the summit. It's dark, so you'll need a headlamp. And some decent gloves for the climb. We were fortunate as mentioned that the weather cooperated, because the ascent was dry and we had no problems with the vertical climb, which was not nearly as difficult as I was expecting them to be. After the rope section there is a 0.5-1km section (just below Low's Peak) where you'll scramble up boulders.The sunrise at the top, on a clear day, is absolutely breathtaking. No pictures or words will ever be able to capture what that experience feels like. So I won't even try. But I will say that it makes the physical torture you'll be putting your body through worth every moment. Also, as a practical matter, make sure to take some warm clothes to layer on in a backpack; you'll be sweaty after the hike and once you stop moving you will get very cold. I packed a fleece, and was fine.Once the sun comes up, your guide will prompt you to start the descent. At this point you'll be able to actually see what it was that you scaled in the darkness, and it'll blow you mind. I have some issues with heights and sheer drops, but none of what I saw was an issue for me personally on the way up or back down the summit. I saw a few others who felt differently though. ymmv.Back at Laban Rata they'll feed you again. And then you'll start the stair descent to the base. This is where things got brutal for me. I had tweaked my right knee and ankle a little coming down from the summit and by about 2km into the 6km descent I was having trouble trusting my footing. I wasn't in any real pain, but my legs just weren't cooperating. I had to rely very heavily on the walking stick (definitely rent one at the base), and hobble down the remaining 4km. By the end of it both of my legs were pretty wrecked and I could barely stand / walk on my own without the stick. It was excruciating, awkward, and felt like it was never going to end. But it did. Take it slow, and be careful and responsible. And listen to your guide.If I was smart -- and if I were you -- I would have trained better for this. I'm reasonably fit by American standards, and run 3x a week, so I thought I'd be fine, but you'll be using muscle groups that don't normally get this sort of a workout. Get on the stairmaster, do some leg presses, etc. My calves and quads burned with every stupid painful step for like 3 days afterwards.If you're serious about doing Mt K, train for it. You won't regret it."
959,It was very tough but rewarding,"This was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. I think from what I know now, I would have saved my money as it was very expensive and spent it elsewhere. We are reasonably fit, adventurous people, but step after step straight up the mountain for kms and then to get up in the dark and freezing cold for the final climb. Then its step after step back down, followed by 2 days of sore legs…. I would recommend it if you really really like a challenge or are really fit or if mountains are your thing, otherwise if you want an enjoyable holiday possibly miss it out."
960,Every angle has a different wonderful view of the Mountain,"It's not for people who are typically sedentary. It's a lot (lot!) more difficult that we thought it'd be (and what is advertised/said) -- and we had trained by stair-climbing months before that. Having done the climb now, we reckon you actually need to train with A LOT by hill walking with various ascending (and descending) undulations -- have attached pix for your reference; some parts are steeper than this!p/s ... you should bring/rent trekking poles."
961,"Awesome Climb, Great Experience","We came to Borneo during our family holiday to South East Asia. We stayed in Kota Kinabalu for a night and then went on the bus to the beautiful rainforest with the wonderful mountain. We stayed overnight in a small lodge before waking up in the morning to climb the mountain. We had a short bus journey to the bottom of the mountain where we met our guide who was a very nice man and he carried our bags which was nice. The climbing was hard and tiresome on the first day. After the first day we stayed at a small lodge halfway up the mountain which for a mountain lodge was pretty good and had very nice food. At two in the morning we woke up and had an early morning meal before we went out, joined our guide and then had an amazing climb to the top. At the top we saw the sunset which was absolutely amazing and then had to go all the way down. We stopped off to have a quick breakfast before going all the way back down to the bottom. We had thoroughly enjoyed our experience and made some good friends. A brilliant experience."
962,completely new experience,"I walked up on 18th & 19th August 2018 with my husband and two teenage boys aged 14 and 16.  Because one son was under 15 we needed two guides which did make it a bit more expensive.  My husband is super fit and does loads of triathlons,. I am not very fit, 47 years old and have been working on my fitness a bit to prepare for the climb.  One core fit class per week and regular 30 minute runs there times per week for the past few months.  We also climbed a couple of hills in the UK in May and June.  My sons are not terribly sporty but one rows regularly and the other does fencing twice per week so they are reasonably active.  We choose to do the Via Ferata package on the shorter ""Walk the Torque"" route.You need walking boots, about 1.5 -2 litres of water per person to get to the overnight stop, sun cream, insect repellent, energy snacks.  There are a number of shelters with toilets and interested water on the way up.  If you don't want to carry 1.5 litres water per person you can take water purification tablets and refill your bottle with untreated water on the way up.  I had walking poles which I found invaluable but none of the rest of my family used them or feel they needed them.  I think if you are over 45 and not super fit then they are very useful.We were booked with River Junkie who provided a packed lunch.  This consisted of a cheese spread sandwich, a honey sandwich, a chicken leg, a hard boiled egg, a carton of chrysanthemum drink, a small pack of crackers and 500ml water.  We took 1.5litres of water person and with the water from lunch this made 2 litres per person total.There is plenty of treated water at the overnight stay area.We started at 10am.  The climb is one long staircase.  Every step is uphill and most of it is steep.  It is a long slog and there are not many views on the way up.  All of us were suffering from headaches and shortness of breath by km 5 and the last km up to Pendant hut was gruelling.  I had to stop for a rest very frequently.  We had to reach pendant hut by 4pm or we would not be permitted to do the Via ferrata the following day.  I have to confess I was in bits for the last very steep 500m to pendant hut at 6km and didn't think I would be able to continue the following day.  My husband was a hero and carried my pack for the last 500m and we arrived at p endant hut at 3pm.  My sons and most people in the via frerata party arrived at the hut at 2-2.30pm.  after a cup of tea and a rest we had the via Ferata briefing at 4pm  Then we had a very good meal in the restaurant at 6pm.  I realised I had not brought enough warm clothes so rented a warm jacket at the restaurant for R24 which was well worth it but they didn't have much choice and I would not recommend depending on this.  We went to bed until 1:45am.  I had a horrific headache due to the altitude and again wondered if I would be able to make it up but decided to try.  We had a breakfast of toast and tea or coffee at the hut.We set of at 2:30am with everyone else so it was busy and very steep.  The path began in a similar way to the previous day.  Stairs and steep rocky paths and then became steep smooth rocks with a rope showing the route.  You can use the rope to help pull you up but it is not essential and you can shuffle to one side for a rest when you need it and let people pass.  It was very challenging.  The weather was good - windy and cold but not raining.  You need  a warm hat, warm gloves, a t shirt, a long sleeved top, a warm fleece and a warm waterproof coat and warm gloves and long trousers to be comfortable plus a head torch and spare batteries.  You can leave a lot of stuff at the hut because you will come back after the summit.  We took 1 litre of water each and lots of energy snacks eg two tracker bars each.I nearly turned back half way up. I was just so exhausted and couldn't care less about the summit or the via ferrata at that point.  However I decided to just continue slowly at my own pace and take each half km at a time.  I eventually made it at about 5:40am where there was rather a queue to take p photos so we left the summit at around 6 very cold.  The sun came up around 6 to reward is with spectacular views.  We made it back to the start point for the via Ferata (which is at the last chasing about 1km from the summit) at about 7am. Cut off time was 8am so there was no real rush.The Walk the Torque via ferrata was good.  I had been very nervous of heights for many years but my family all wanted me to join them on this so I did a tree top ""go ape"" trail in the UK. I would suggest if you can do that then walk the torque will be fine for you.  The longer Low's Circuit looked much more challenging and I definitely couldn't have done it but a rock climber could have done it easily. Walk the torque involved a 15- 20 minute walk which was gently downhill from the hut  to the start.  Then a bit of traversing steep slopes while clipped onto a cable.  Best thing is to hold the cable and lean out or lean back as if abseiling to descend steeper rocks. We then went over an edge about 10 feet high and did a lot more traversing steep rocks  then we want Ed across a cable while holding another cable above - best to lean out here. Then the hardest part for me was climbing a ladder where I had to face outwards and have my back to the rock face. Legs got a bit shaky here. Then we climbed up a rock face back to the point where we started the ferrata ( lower than the hut at the checkpoint. Don't leave anything at the checkpoint hut where you harness up because you won't go back there). There are no points where you are overhanging cliffs or huge drops on any of the route.  We finished at 9 am but we were quite slow and others do it in 1.5 hrs.There is plenty of treated water at the overnight stay area.We then walked down to Pendant Hut where we had spent the previous night and had more breakfast and a rest before setting off at 11:30am which is checkout time.The journey down was tough and we took 500ml water and had no more snacks left.  We should have taken more water and more snacks.  It was very tough on the knees.  My sons made it down at about 230 and I made it down for 3.15."
963,Amazing,"If you are in KK, you must at least visit the base of Mount Kinabalu if you are not going to climb it.  The views from the basecamp are spectacular.  If you take a day tour just to the base, skip the stupid hot springs...not worth it!"
964,So tough but worth it,"We are seasoned travellers and this is the worst Hotel we have ever stayed in. The bed linen was disgustingly filthy and underneath the pillows were old dead insects. I then removed the filthy pillow cases only to discover the most disgusting putrid pillow that should have been thrown out years ago. As it was too late in the night to change rooms I removed the filthy cushions from the cane chairs and ""slept"" there.  Looking forward to a hot shower we were greeted by cold water and no flushing toilet. Senior Management should be ashamed of themselves for taking RGT from any person staying here."
965,Best spot to watch a sunrise,"At 5.40am, I reached Low's Peak, the highest point of Mount Kinabalu. So it took me around 2 hours and 40 minutes conquered the glorious Mount Kinabalu which is not bad at all. I could feel the coldness and wind struck into my bones. It was nearly 0 degree Celsius and I was shivering and my hands were freezing. When visibility was clearer, the surrounding view bolstered my waning strength. It was stunning and otherworldly, it quite literally takes one’s breath away. I couldn't even begin to describe the view from the top as the first rays of sunrise peek their way from behind the clouds. At this point, all tiredness and muscle soreness were forgotten. The breath-taking view from the top is indescribable, with a souffle of clouds floating around."
966,another capitalist products,"We booked our Mount Kinabalu trip via an agency. Of all the agencies, our agent charged the cheapest and she was hands on with the tour she organizes.Our hike was lovely. I can't remember if it rained. I think it did but we already have reached the cabins. I must say that it's a experience of a lifetime. Not for the faint hearted and definitely for the strong willed. The view when you've reached the higher part of the hike is lovely. Don't forget your windbreaker, good pair of gloves and pants. It is very chilly and windy in the summit.I definitely recommend this to my friends!"
967,Climbing the mount is 'a-must',"Mt kinabalu has been on my to-do list for quite some time now. I decided to just fork over the money and get it over with. The climb itself is fairly easy for someone who is decently fit, and has done trekking before. However, I was disappointed at how crowded it was at the top, with hundreds of people bunching together at the summit and along the trail to the summit. I also unfortunately experienced poor weather during my climb which resulted in freezing temperatures. The mountain itself is still incredible, but perhaps overhyped. If you have done trekking in the Himalayas or alps, you may be underwhelmed. For what I paid, If I could go back in time, I would not have done it. But now that I have, I'm glad to be able to just cross it off my list."
968,"Exhausting, but totally worth it","I can't add much that hasn't already been said. It was tough but so worth it. One step at a time will see you get there and what a sense of achievement to make it. Amazing Borneo arranged it all and it was smooth sailing. Can be wet and very cold and higher up, and you'll need warm and strong gloves for hanging on to thick rope so go prepared. Laban Rata lodge has a small shop but only takes cash. We had some heater problems in the room but Douglas the manager sorted it out on the spot and was super friendly and a pleasure to talk too."
969,Amazing!,"The view of the mountain is unbeatable against a clear sunny sky. But then again, during cloudy weather, the urge to see it is even more.You can get to My Kinabalu National Park either by the interstate bus from Inanam Bus station (6 miles away from Kota Kinabalu) or simply follow a local tour.Stop by Akinabalu market to shop for souvenir or taste the local bird nest. And when you do get to the National park, tke your time to walk in the park and take in the cool air. There is a nice restaurant right within the park where you can try local food. Shop for more souvenir while there.On your way back to KK from Mt Kinabal, ask to top by Rumah Terbalik, the only Upside Down House in Asia at Tamparuli town"
970,Worth every sweat!,"First things first, let's talk about the cost. I paid SGD500 for the 2D1N package. Which I felt slightly pricey. I hiked with a group of 9 people ranging from 20-25 years of age.I did zero research for this trip. Only to have a shock when I was told that the hike up to Laban Rata Guesthouse was 6KM long. I had no difficulty climbing despite carrying roughly 6kg on my bag, consisting of food, water and my clothes. The lunch they provided for the first day hike was pathetic. It was cucumber sandwiches and a fried chicken. I recommend that you bring sufficient high energy food up. There is tap water but bring along a pill if your body isn't used to drinking brown water. There's no shops throughout the climb. Waterproof everything. The rain is your worst enemy. Wet and cold is the worst combination. Our guide wasn't that friendly and encouraging. I had to be the one who kept the morale high for the group. I had an excellent hike to Laban Rata guesthouse. There will be buffet meals provided part of the package at Laban Rata guesthouse. The food is edible. There are provisions sold such as water, alcohol, but they are slightly pricey. So bring extra cash. There's no hot water for shower. Toilet is clean. Bunkbeds are creaky. I couldnt sleep well the night. We had to be ready by 230am the next day for the climb to the summit. Breakfast was provided. WATERPROOF EVERYTHING BEFORE THE CLIMB TO SUMMIT. Bring along a headlight as it is super dark. Unfortunately for us, the rain was too heavy and we had to turn back to laban rata. The hike down back to base camp will destroy your legs. Bring along Ibuprofen or Tiger balm. Everyone will be given a certificate of achievement. Overall it was a satisfying climb. Train for it and always expect the worst. Have a good climb."
971,Nice!,I like to be away from the maddening crowd and good information offered here.  I dislike a lack of accurate information about the train travel from Beaufort to Tenom and visa versa ( often the trips are cancelled without prior notice)
972,Canopy Walk at Poring Spring is worth the climb..,"The tranquility of the surrounding area around Kinabalu Park HQ never cease to amaze me.  Though I have been guiding for over 20 years and have been here countless time, just to spend the day walking around the many Nature Trails and enjoying it (wet or dry) is worth it.  Birding at this area is really worth staying overnight.  You don't have to stay within the park as it is getting too costly, but lots of clean affordable places just outside within a walking distance of approximately 1km to 5 km.  Beware though of unscrupulous lodging tenants who do not tell you the condition of some of the budget ones, until it is too late for you!"
973,Very very Beautiful Forest,"It is quite natural to be a bit apprehensive about your own ability to climb the mountain, or perhaps even to consider an attempted climb. But if you have booked your trek with one of the major tour organizers, you would have had to obtain the services of an approved mountain guide at the Park HQ. Our guide was a very pleasant & helpful man by the name of Juru. Excellent guy & guide!The ascent starts with a short descent to Carson Falls and after that a long (endless?) stretch of steps with a hand rail besides them. My first view of the steepness of the path was almost discouraging but each step takes you closer to the summit! Read the many online descriptions of the trail to prepare yourself mentally.All climbers are required to end their first day at Laban Rata Resthouse & restaurant. When you get there, you would know that you have proven to yourself that you can achieve more than you thought you could before you began the ascent. The restaurant serves delicious soup in a huge bowl, and that may be the best first thing you should treat yourself to (own cost). Dinner which is probably included in your package will be available later in the evening.Overnighting at Laban Rata will be cold, especially with strong winds blowing, so be well prepared. We stayed at the Pendant Hut which was another 10 mins higher up and had to negotiate a set of stairs while being subjected to the wind.Whether you continue to the summit the next morning depends on the weather - if it rains and the granite is wet and slippery, it is likely the Park authorities will not permit any climbing at all. My group had this fate and we ended up descending without the opportunity to complete our ascent. We had the ""extra"" experience of descending in wind & rain, for almost half the way.All in, any attempt at climbing Mt Kinabalu is worth doing. Take it easy, take it as far as you can go. If you make it all the way... fantastic! Those who have made it says it was definitely worth it! (By the way, for those who are interested - we took 5 hours to get up to Laban Rata and about 4.5 hours to get down in the rain.)"
974,Climb the highest mountain in South East Asia,"Hiking under the storm. From wet socks to slippy trails. The sound of raindrops, big or small, bouncing off leaves and trees on their way down to earth coupled with the hypnotic sound of the rain bouncing off your hood. A great adventure with good friends and endless stories to share. Sometimes the best things in life are unexpected. We will certainly come back again"
975,Hardest Climb Ever Done,"""The Park"" is not just that. It is a ""world"" in  itself. Don't expect trimmed hedges and flower beds. It is WILD and 2000 m altitude is just the starting point... You can roam as little or as extensively as you want.. All the way up to Mt Kinabalu (6090 m) That is 6 kilometer above Kota Kinabalu (since it is at the rim of the ocean). I spent lovely 3 hours walking the trails -along rivers, through original rain forest. Next time I go further up ;-)  Serious trekkers take 2 days (with one night in between in a guest house on the slope of the mountain) to go up and come back..  but serious ""Runners"" (as in international mountain running events) hold the record at 3 hours (for the round trip) - See for yourself in what category you fit :-) Mt Kinabalu Park is a great ""Jewel"" among the nature preserves, and definitely a place to go once you are in Borneo.. We stayed at ""Pine Resort"" in Kundasang, and it was an O.k place. Friendly, helpful staff, flexible management (we changed the room), and on a hillside nestled in between real PINES."
976,Fabulous,"It's just unimaginable that a marvelous sight of Mt.Kinabalu appeared in front of us as captured by our team-mate early in the morning , and such a spectacular view can be described idiomatically in Chinese 日照金山 （神山）You can refer to a series of photos captured by Wa Pak as follows:"
977,Climbing Mount Kinabalu,"I am shocked.what is going on in the world that you are not allowed to climb a mountain on your own.I've been hiking in the alps and in nepal.been in Norway and the andes.why,why are people forced to pay for a guide.if people need them,okay.but not to give people a choice is ridiculous and insane.and what is even worse,backpackers such as myself can't even afford it cause the cheapest way to get up there is 250euro in a bigger group. You people are destroying everything due to stupid capitalism.this is killing spirits and the joy you get through nature.thanks a lot. Next step is to get minibusses up there for the lazy one's that are dropped off for the perfect picture."
978,The summit was amazing,One of the first things i was interested in borneo was a hike on mount kinabalu. A host told me there is a limit of allowed visitors and i have to book month befor. On tripadvisor i found a perfect offer to do this very spontaneously ;) The managament was that simple and i got an instant contact via whatsapp to start the climb in the next days. It was a absolutely privilege to me and i am very thankful about the quickly organisation. Thanks a lot.
979,One hell of a climb but definitely worth it!,We tended to walk the trails and along the roadside early in the morning and late in the day. We saw most of the endemic birds and had great mountain views albeit some trials are still closed after the earthquake.Best birds for us were Whitehead's Broadbill and Trogon and the Bornean Fruithunter
980,Beautiful Mountain,"Like a few of the other reviewers, I went with the travel company Intrepid. Must admit that they were rather good:Climbing Kinabalu? You don’t climb-you walk. On the upper slopes there are some ropes which you can utilize. I found the climb to be pretty straight forward and I got to the top at least 45mins ahead of the rest of my team. I watched the sun come up over the South China sea all on my lonesome. I am no superman, but have trekked and climbed in Nepal, Pakistan and South America. In saying that, a lot of people do not make it to the top. The height-just over 4000m can be a little too much for some people. The descent can be hell on the knees.A visit to Poring Hot springs after the climb is a great way to soothe the tired muscles."
981,"Wonderful views, well-maintained","I'll be honest there was moments when I was asking why am I doing this to myself. But when you get to the top and the sun starts to rise and you are stood above the clouds you quickly develop goldfish memory and forget the agony. But I'm a weakling. Normal people may be fine. It's 4095m high it took 2 days to climb and 4 days for my legs to recover and walk like a functioning human again. The relief and dread when you approach the final staircase on your way back out is indescribable. But it's worth it! Also the last 2k walk up is in the dark, so it's nice coming down after sunrise and seeing it for the first time properly. The landscape is stunning and ever changing but I won't bore you with that, your eyes will tell a better story than I or my iPhone could ever attempt. We did it with Jungle Jack (I suggest giving him a call 010 947 7509) one of the cheapest guides around and we spoke to a lot of people. Ranges from 1000rm to 1380rm depending on how flexible you are and your negotiation. You also get a night at his  place at the end of the climb, where he pretty much feeds you continually like an old Greek grandmother. Probably the highlight of Malaysia for me. If you're on the fence, it really is worth it."
982,Good experience,"You absolutely won't regret this experience, so I'll skip the description and try and give some valuable tips.NOT for everyone, would only recommend for reasonably fit people, probably the equivalent of 10,000 steps and the way down hurts the most (although much quicker)Beanie, Windproof warm jacket, gloves, pants and shoes ESSENTIAL!Food is 4x normal price at the top of the mountain so pack enough snacks, The meals up there are all you can eat but if you get to Laban Rata at say 1pm and they don't serve dinner till 4.30pm you'll be hungry.Definitely take a walking stick. You can buy one at the 1st gate for 39MR or Hire one for 10MR, your knees will thank you for it on the way down.You can leave your bags at the bottom for 10MR and you can pay your guide to take a bag for you (Price per kg). You can also hire gloves and jackets for 20MR each if you don't want to carry them up.If I did it again I'd bring warmer clothes and more snacks, eating too much at the buffet could be a bad move before the big night climb to the summit"
983,Worth the walk!,"This has got to be one of the most challenging and amazing things I've ever done in my life, it was so tough mentally and physically but more than glad I did it. There are lots of reviews offering advise and whatnot and all I can add is that it's totally worth it, it's easy enough for a reasonably fit person to do it, just be prepared for your legs to be in a lot of pain for a week afterwards."
984,Glad I did it,"If you have ever wondered what it feels like to look upon the clouds from above, then this is for you.The mountain is very accessible but be warned, the climbing is steep and you do need to condition yourself before taking on this hike. You'll be rewarded with an awesome sense of achievement and wonder, changing terrain, beautiful landscape, visits from birds and squirrels.  The sense of reward will live with you forever whether you made it to the summit or not.I climbed with a friend; two males both over 50. We booked through Amazing Borneo and our guide was experienced, helpful and patient wth us. We attempted the summit at dawn on day two, but agreed to turn around and head back down to our dorm' for a sleep. Others older than us made it to the Low's Peak, but not everyone on the mountain was prepared to try the summit climb. Whether you do or not, the journey of exploration is still worth the effort.The set up is excellent, from the moment you arrive at the Park HQ to the end of the adventure. Safety is a priority, but yes, you sign indemnity and climb at your own risk. There is no doctor up there so make sure you are satisfied with your health report before attempting this strenuous activity. You climb to beyond 14,000 feet if you do summit and this has implications as the oxygen is thinner, particularly first thing in the morning, and your heart works harder to feed the oxygen to your muscles."
985,One with Nature,"Let me start of by saying this: I am not fat, I am not lazy I am not completly unfit but climbing this mountain made me want to die. From about 30 minutes into the climb until the moment I got into the car after 2 days of climbing, it was pure hell.The views from the top were utterly amazing, but the tens of people pushing to get a photo at the summit made me fear for my life as if I was going to be shoved to my plummiting death over the cliff side. Needless to say the ""danger zone"" did not evoke feelings of job after already climbing for 8 hours.If you are a keen climber or walker or love to be punished then yeah, give it a go. Otherwise I'd give it a miss."
986,Magnificient Kota Kinabalu,"Mount Kinabalu is one of the highest mountain in South East Asia, boasting 4095 meters above sea level(13,435′ ft.) it is not a mountain to be underestimated.This is my third major climb and I couldn’t sleep at all because of excitement,I have chosen the route going down via ferrata which i added to my adrenalin journey.The climb takes two days, the first day is going up to the pendant hut starting at 9:00 AM which is 6 km non-stop trekking that took me 3 and half hour to reach. The last 1km of the climb was steep and grueling.When you reach pendant Hut (base camp for Mt Kinabalu) There will be a compulsory briefing at 3pm for all trekkers who will be doing the ferrata route. During this briefing, the trainer will teach you how to put on your harness as well as what you’ll have to do during the ferrata route itself.I summited at 4:40am and sunrise was at 5:30am. The view was rewarding. Merely viewing the sunrise was worth every sore, sweat and fatigue I felt that day. I was blessed with clear skies to witness the most beautiful sunrise ever. It was a moment between me and nature. A moment that I’ll always remember for as long as I live."
987,Must do if you are in Borneo,"Four words: God damn worth it.To be honest, I'm overly overweight, didn't do any simulation tracking nor equip with the proper hiking / climbing gear when I was at the foot of the mountain. To make it even worst, there is this 10-kg bag on my bag because I think it is far too expensive of the porter charges - not a very wise choice.All I'm saying is that, as long as you really want it, the peak is yours. And believe me, it will all be worth it."
988,Exhilarating,"Mount Kinabalu National Park is located some 2 hours drive from Kota Kinabalu. Although the  road journey is only about 2 hours, it recommended to stay overnight in one of the many holiday resorts, home stay accommodation or even a 3 star hotel. Those who seek physical…"
989,Very impressive scene,"Mount Kinabalu is at a distance of 2 hours from the town of Kota Kinabalu and is accessible by buses and taxis from the town center. Besides a host of activities, trekking and mountain climb are the most popular. Since the mountain is easilly accessible, youdo not need any special skills, or training for the same. Amateurs like me can tread your way all along till the tip of the peak. I suggest that you stay close in the vicinity for better acclamatization."
990,Absolutely definitely worth every penny,"I don't know what to say, but seeing this magnificent mountain really makes me realize that the best things in life are free! We did not do mountain climbing but seeing this mountain from a perfect angle is really breath taking. This is the highest peak in southeast asia and I'm very honored to see this creation in my own eyes. Nature has it's own way in letting us appreciate what it can offer! Kinabalu mountain is the perfect landmark for this country. Malaysian people must be very proud and thankful to have such gift that you can't see from other places."
991,Watch your step,"Seriously, I've always miss Mount Kinabalu. I don't know why, but it seems like some kind of refreshing when being at the top of the summit, seeing the amazing view of Sabah. Oh, I just love it! Gonna climb it for the second time.  :) Actually you don't really need to be physically fit to climb it as long as you are mentally strong knowing that you can do it to the top! Hahaha.."
992,"If you are climbing Mount Kinabalu, come prepared.","Now that a lot of time has passed, I can say that I'm glad we did this. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done. And my husband and I weren't best friends by the time we got back to the bottom. I've done a half marathon before and this was so so much more difficult. The first day was pretty hard but the people coming down were telling us ""this is nothing. You wait"" which was slightly terrifying. They weren't wrong though.It's freezing in the accommodation so sleep is an impossibility but I think that's to be expected. The food was good though! But it means getting up at 2 to get to the summit is even more exhausting than it otherwise would be.It's a real test of physical and mental power. But it's nice that everyone is battling together. And it's lovely at the top. Going down, I was very slow. It's quite slippery and I was nervous. But going slowly makes you seize up. And by the end, my legs were like absolute jelly.Luckily, we'd booked a lovely beach resort where we rested for the next 6 nights. And boy did we need them! It's hard but do-able and you'll need some recovery time!"
993,Mount Kinbalu - awesome - must do!!!,"Kinabalu Mountain, part of Sabah Park, located at 88km away from Kota Kinabalu town, is  Malaysia's first World Heritage Site designated by UNESCO. You have to plann this trip before starting climbing because you have to get a permit for this.When I planned climbing Mount Kinabalu, I knew just about its altitude on the top, but, because I was born and grew up in a mountain town, going quite often on the mountain, I thought it would be a similar experience. But shortly after beggining the route, I had to find out that it does not compare to any other previousl lived experiences. If you want to get to the top and catch the speechless sunrise, must climb the route in 2 days. Is a great effort of will, mentall and physicall, but once you reach the top, you realize that everything had been through doesn't matter. Only your success and splendor of sunrise which is a speechless show. Take next to you some more clothes, specially for early morning when you feel the cold more intense after sweating during climbing. And do not forget the motto of Laban Rata hut (2700m): ""Be prepared to be challenged physically and mentally by Kinabalu Mountain."" These are not just simple words!Easy acces from Kota Kinabalu city by public transport. As accomodation you can try KinabaluParklodge.com‎ or any other near by resort."
994,Tough but worthwhile,"If you've never in your life done something worth reminiscing when age catches up with you in the later part of years; and still at present possess some form of physical capabilities with no contraindicating medical ailments, then scaling Mount Kinabalu should be on top of your bucket list. Know for once that Mount Kinabalu is by far one of the most well-charted terrain from base to peak and there should be no reason for the difficulties in navigating. The challenges and the obstacles would come from the climb and descent itself coupled with the ongoing thinning of air pressure as you scale higher on. These poses an ongoing threat to deny your climb, but reinforced with the strong will and determination, there should be no reason why you won't be able to scale to greater heights - pun intended.I will bore you not of the details of the climb, but provision those who are interested to read more about my own experience from my links below.For more animated reviews of the mountain and its challenges - here's five links to my personal blog for those interested:-http://sckhsmg2008.blogspot.com/2014/02/mount-kinabalu-climb-preparation.htmlhttp://sckhsmg2008.blogspot.com/2014/02/mount-kinabalu-climb-day-one.htmlhttp://sckhsmg2008.blogspot.com/2014/02/mount-kinabalu-climb-day-two.htmlhttp://sckhsmg2008.blogspot.com/2014/03/mount-kinabalu-climb-descent.htmlhttp://sckhsmg2008.blogspot.com/2014/02/mount-kinabalu-peaks.html"
995,"Hard work, book ahead","Book early! Try to book directly through http://www.suteraharbour.com/v4/index.php?option=com_content&id=109&Itemid=57 (yes this is expensive, but this way you are directly dealing with the owner!), we left it too late (3 months before the trip- Sutera Sanctuary Lodges said they no longer had space) and used North Borneo Budget Tours (the cheapest deal I could find and I would recommend them- everything ran smoothly!) The walk is incredible! It took my friend and I 4 hours to ascend to Laban Rata. We then had time to relax and acclimatise before waking up at 1.30am (breakfast at 2am) and meeting guide at 2.45am. The morning walk is quite tough with lots of ropes to help you climb up and you must be prepared with your clothes- waterproofs, warm clothes (temperature at the peak approx 2 degrees centigrade), waterproof gloves to use the wet ropes, sturdy walking boots. We took 2 hours to walk the final part of the mountain and managed to arrive in time for the incredible sunrise! Even if you don't make it in time for sunrise, you'll definitely feel a sense of achievement when you're high above the clouds! The walk down feels very long, but you'll get there eventually! Absolutely loved it, a must do if you're in Malaysia!"
996,Low's Peak via Mesilau,"Mount Kinabalu is the highest peak in Borneo’s Cocker Range.  The mount is 4095 metres in height. Mount Kinabalu is known for the range of diversity it offers. The mount has a wide variety of different species of ferns, birds and mammals. The mount is visible from the Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park. Kinabalu is visited by thousands of tourists every year. The tourists climb and trek along the mountain top. The climb is easy and does not require any special equipment. The view from the top is spectacular. The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is also a nice place to visit."
997,Must Do,初心者です途中の山小屋に一泊。6時間登り続けて やっと到着。The mountain lodge was just fine but the room was too cold and no heater. You better bring a portable heater. The foods average. 3:30am leaves for summit with a porter (you can hire a porter from the office) Cold .... Windy.... Dark .... But reach summit was 200% satisfaction.
998,Amazing Mount kinabalu,"Was für eine Erfahrung ...Wir haben den Mt Kinabalu kurz vor Weihnachten bestiegen - eine tolle Erfahrung aber leider auch etwas frustrierend:We (3 adults 1 kid with 7 year) started to the summit of Mt. Kinabalu on Dec 21st 2019, on the first day everything went well an we reached the basecamp/hostel after the planned 5 hours. In the next night we also started as planned around 2:30am. Shortly after, a light rain started that got heavier and heavier. Anyway, we passed the last checkpoint and made our way towards the summit - until, suddenly, less than 1 hour to the summit, people were returning. The reason was that the rain was so much that the guides judged as not safe and strongly requested everyone on the mountain to return. Hiking with a 7 year old kid, and seeing the situation on the way down (a lot of water and water streams we had to cross) I 100% agree to decision of the guides.But this is why we did not made it to the summit but only to approx 4060 m (according the certificate we received)."
999,Majestic!,"Mount Kinabalu lies in the Crocker Range in the province of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. It is the highest peak in Malaysia rising to the altitude of 4096 meters (13438 ft.) It is surrounded by Kinabalu National Park, a designated world heritage site due to its incredible diversity of plant and animal life. The trail itself is beautiful and the views from the upper regions of the trail and from the summit are stunning! I enjoyed this hike so much that I thought I would write about what I experienced in the hope that it might help others enjoy this incredible experience.Regulations- All hikers must have a National Park guide and a permit. Only a certain number of people are allowed to hike each day and permits for weekends, holidays etc. often sell out well in advance. Plan ahead and get your permits. Since the earthquake in 2015 that killed 18 hikers and guides the park no longer allows hikers to hike to the peak and descend in one day. Most hikers hike to Laban Rata on day 1 and spend the night in the lodge. Then they wake up early on day 2 and summit in time to see the sunrise and then descend that same day. There are numerous tour companies online that can make all your reservations (permit, guide, lodging etc). This makes everything much easier.Trailhead- There are two trailheads but most hikers use the trailhead at Timpohon Gate. It is 2km shorter than the trail that starts from The Mesilau Nature Resort and has less vertical elevation climbing. My advice is to start early. It is cooler and you have a better chance of being at Laban Rata before the typical afternoon rains start.Trail distances/ Vertical Elevation Gain-	1. Trail head to Laban Rata 3.7 miles- 1407 meters vertical elevation gain (4616 vt. ft.)	2. Laban Rata to Summit  1.8 miles- 822 meters vertical elevation gain (2700 vt.ft.)	3. Total:  5 ½ miles (one way) to the summit, 11 miles round trip.Vertical Elevation- The elevation at Timpohon Gate is 1866 meters (6122 ft.). The summit of Mt. Kinabalu is 4096 meters (13,438 ft.). The difference is 2230 meters (7316). There are very few ups and downs on this trail. It is basically straight up.Trail- The first 4km of the trail is not as steep as the other sections of the trail. After Layang Layang the trail to Laban Rata steepens considerably. There are wooden and rock stairs on the steeper sections. Above Laban Rata there are numerous long sections on bare granite rock. Ropes and cables are set up to help you climb the steeper sections safely. If you typically hike in trail sneakers and the trail conditions are good they will be fine. If the trail is wet/muddy or if you just want to play it safe then waterproof boots are appropriate.Water- There is a rest station set up approximately every km on the trail from Timpohon Gate to Laban Rata. Each station has water that does not have to be treated. From Laban Rata to the summit there is no water available. You must carry all you need from Laban Rata to get you to the summit and back to Laban Rata.Laban Rata- This shelter is located about 3km from the summit and is where you will probably spend the night. It has a huge common area that is very comfortable. The bunk rooms each have 2-4 bunk beds (4-8 people) in a room. The rooms are basic but clean. All bedding is provided.The food is served buffet style. There is a good selection of food available and the quality of the food is very good. There are drinks and snacks for sale. A few basic items like torches can be rented.  There are showers.  My recommendation is to take one as soon as you arrive at Laban Rata. The wait time for showers can be long in the late afternoon. Overall, Laban Rata exceeded my expectations and I really enjoyed my stay there.Weather- Mount Kinabalu has typical mountain weather (not predictable and can change fast). Bring what you need for strong sun (lotion, sunglasses, some type of shade hat etc.), potentially cold temperatures and wind near the summit (warm hat, gloves, jacket) and a raincoat/poncho.Climbing Times- Of course this depends on many factors such as trail conditions, weather, pack weight, physical conditioning etc. The estimates below are appropriate for most hikers.Timpohon Gate to Laban Rata 4-6 hrsLaban Rata to Summit 1 ½-3 hrsSummit to Laban Rata 1-2 hrsLaban Rata to Timpohon Gate 2 ¼- 4 ½ hrsPace. My advice is to start slow. There are numerous steep sections on this trail that can really tire your legs if you try to walk too fast. If at any time you feel the pace might be too fast for you it probably is. Slow down. You will enjoy yourself more and you will have a much higher probability of experiencing the majestic views from the highest peak in Malaysia at sunrise!Conclusion: - I can not stress this enough. Anyone is reasonably good hiking condition can do this hike and experience this adventure. Hiking Mt. Kinabalu was the highlight of my time in Borneo. I hope that you enjoy it as well. Please feel free to contact me with any questions."
