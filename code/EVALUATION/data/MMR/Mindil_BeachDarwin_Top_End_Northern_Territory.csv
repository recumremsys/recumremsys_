0,Lots of hype probably didn't help,Unfortunately less tourists during this COVID time means a smaller market and a little underwhelming after hearing so much about it. Sunset still pulled us through!
1,Markets,Sunset was very pretty at this location but don't expect to get any photos of a quiet beach. The markets nearby have great variety and many food options.
2,Pool pleasure,Had thought that there would more handicrafts etc was more devoted to food and very touristy in terms of what was for sale (understandable)
3,Thumbs up!,"The night markets on Thursday and Sunday nights only, is worth the visit (if not for the variety of food), it's a must for the sunset."
4,Love the mindil beach markets,Markets were a bit under whelming but Covid can be blamed for this.Still a great Darwin Sunset at the end of the day.üòé
5,Sunday night markets !!!,We deliberately extended our stay to attend these markets and so glad we did. Crowds are massive it‚Äôs like an event on the Darwin social calendar. Heaps of food vans and so many stalls. Don‚Äôt overthink it just make your plans and head to these markets and enjoy the experience. Graham and Diana - Blaxland Blue Mountsins
6,COVID 19 ,"The market is great for food lovers, not so much for those looking for souvenirs. Had we researched prior to our visit, it is likely that we would have skipped this venue."
7,market,Mindil beach is magic with the sun setting.Although a struggle to find a park we enjoyed the atmosphere.Lots of food stalls although not a lot of healthy options.There are many other stalls selling different goods and entertainment.Most people go to sit on the beach and eat and watch the sunset.Gets very crowded but a must see in Darwin if possible.
8,SUNSET MARKETS,"How good are these markets? Visiting from Sydney it was amazing to see how many market and high quality food stalls there were! No price gouging, free water fill by the beach, and then that sunset! Must do!"
9,Stunning sunsets,"Since my last visit, Dec 2016 there seems to be more vendors, that is food vendors.  A good selection and good quality of native art and crafts.  Exceptionally busy as there was a promotion of car racing, although no cars, just the drivers, whoich seemed to draw and thrill the crowds."
10,Beautiful Sunsets,The market was lots of vans and stalls of fried food.  Could do with fresh eyes to offer more draft and local goods
11,A Darwin ‚Äúmust do‚Äù,"Will not be as crowded if avoid market nights (Thursday and Sunday from April to October) but the market experience is also highly recommended. A lovely beach for a pleasant stroll end to end. Sunsets will rarely disappoint. Safe for kids to swim, chase tiny crabs, collect shells or build sandcastles. Plenty of parking and toilets on site."
12,Amazing markets,Excellent place to spend a Thursday night visiting the markets. The dust on the beach is captivsting
13,Mixed feelings,So enjoyed the Sunday night market you can eat so many dishes from around Asia very reasonable prices the highlite to the market was the sunset on Mindil Beach
14,Must see,Beach and markets - a first for me with the crowd clapping the sunset.  A good range of food to sit back and enjoy the market atmosphere
15,A pretty beach,The vip area is great we were well looked after and had seat and table pre sunset and could tour the market at leisure They gave an esky to cool our gin ! Wonderful sunset and the beach atmosphere fantastic
16,Love of Mindil Beach Markets,"The Mindil Markets are amazing to see the all different cultures to come together selling items, listening to somegreat loca music and the sunsets are to die for. We  suit the markets every time we come for a holiday.!"
17,Spectacular Sunset,We were very spoilt to be treated to a private area at the Mindil Markets as part of a corporate group.  It was nice to have tables and chairs to return to to eat and drink.  We were given Mindil Money to go and buy whatever food we wanted from the large range of food van which is a great idea and then as the sun began to set we could sit at the table to watch or just pop over the dune to the beach to get a better view of the beautiful sunsets the Northern Territory are famous for.
18,fine,Sunday afternoon markets were mostly food which was great to watch the sunset eating yumy food. The aboriginal influence was everywhere.
19,Top market experience,Our trip north would not have been complete without a trip to the Mindil Beach Markets and the glorious sunset.   The market had many special craft stalls and food stalls you would not believe.
20,The best sunset ever,"Enjoyed the sunset on my first visit to the markets, highly recommended the Thursday night markets! Close to the city but then again everything seems close in darwin"
21,Meditative moments and serene vistas,Our hotel had a complimentary shuttle to the markets as it gets crowded with cars. There were so many food trucks and so much food to chose from. Some very nice jewellry and a stall of bag tags made from old dictoraries which were great. Got my nephew some camel jerky. The sunset from there was lovely and a nice way to cool down after a hot day.
22,Sunset Paradise.,"The food stalls are never ending , with something for everyone. Market stalls and Nik nacks to purchase. Free music entertainment and you can buy your dinner and sit in the beach to watch the sun set. Although the water looks inviting remember the salt water crocks are about so don‚Äôt be tempted to splash around, you risk loosing a limb doing so. Still a must see while in town ."
23,Fabulous!,Swimming is a big no no due to the crocodile risk. But Thursday night markets are a must. Very popular and somewhat crowded. Take a chair or picnic rug so you can relax with dinner and then go down to the beach to watch the sunset. The variety of food is astounding. Many stalls with a large variety of merchandise. Michiko's nature paintings are amazing ...she also paints on site.. Also a good place to watch Aboriginal artists at work and buy very reasonably priced paintings in different sizes.
24,Beautiful ,"The markets are very extensive, lots of people, lots of food choices, but highlight is sitting on beach waitin for sun to go down."
25,Definitely check out Mindil Beach!,Like the Palmerston and Parap markets just more stalls. The beach has brown sand and WA has hundreds of nicer beaches.
26,A sunset at Mindil,Be there for sunset. Good variety of interesting stalls and food choices. Great atmosphere. A must do if visiting Darwin in dry season.
27,Sunset is best,Needs vendors spread out further and more of them. Hard to move around such large number of people in small area.
28,Very quiet,After grabbing a bite to eat ( the food is inexpensive but unimpressive). The best part Mindil beach is the Sunset.  As Aboriginals sing and play simple instruments the sun sank slowly below the horizon and the audience on the beach enjoyed the best show in town!
29,Excellent resort and service,Nice market with lots of food and merchandise. Bonus watching the sunset from the beach. I think the market is on Thurs and Sun during dry season.
30,Morning Walk,"Great night at the Thursday evening market. The atmosphere is electric, the food stalls amazing, nearly every country‚Äôs cuisine represented, activities for kids, brilliant Psychic Medium Suzie Gibbs. Must never forget the beautiful Darwin Sunset a highlight of the evening, perfect location, sit on the sand and see the amazing colours!"
31,Sundowner on the beach,"Enjoyed a really great Thursday Mindil markets. A great buzz, lots of food including multiple coeliac friendly gluten free dishes. Magic subset over the ocean."
32,Best Sunset Vantage point,"Mindel Beach markets are worth visiting not just for the vast array of foods to sample and local products but the sunset is magnicent. The pictures I took on my mobile phone are awesome. I will be framing some for sure. Relaxing, friendly atmosphere."
33,Great place for an evening eating experience,If you visit Darwin you must visit the markets which are pretty nice and while they are the same as many take your food and drink over to the beach for a spectacular sunset not to be missed.
34,Beautiful Sunsets,"The mindil beach markets are awesome! Worst thing about it is making a choice of which delicious foods to eat then rolling back to your car you're so full !! Take plenty of cash as the crafts , clothes and jewellery are beautiful and some stalls give a discount for cash."
35,An ordinary beach.,"The markets are a popular tourist attraction. In all honesty I think things are a little overpriced. Food wasn‚Äôt fantastic and all averaging between $10-$20. (Also it‚Äôs on the beach. Have a look at the dust and sand on the displays, surely that ends up in the food.)The locals rave about the sunset there, but I come from Perth, I see that same, even better, sunset from there. If you live on the east coast and don‚Äôt get to see the sun setting over the ocean. Then it‚Äôs worth the hustle. Gets very crowded after 6pm and very long waits on food. Catch an uber or taxi from the city and get them to drop you off and pick you up in one of the adjacent streets. Just walk across. Cause it‚Äôs a long traffic jam to get out, and will cost you extra $. Sky city casino is just next door, so you can go for a few drinks or a gamble if that‚Äôs your thing. (Sandbar) is a great place to have a few at the casino. With a live band or singer, dance floor and a great outdoor smoking terrace."
36,Great market.,We went on a Sunday night and it was very busy. parking is a challenge! Predominantly food trucks with a good variety. Still quite a number of stall selling everything from didgeridoos to toys.
37,Sunset to die for ,"Best time to go when the markets is on. Great food, great beach and great sunsetThere are so many food stalls and arts and craft. There are also some entertainments."
38,Amazing place for sunset - but very busy!,"Went here on recommendations from friends and from TripAdvisor.  The actual market was average (more food than goods to purchase - bit of a disappointment after the market at Port Douglas - just wanted to buy some trinkets and it really had nothing much).  HOWEVER, the sunset on the beach was just wonderful and had many people waiting to watch it.  The crowd (and there were many there) clapped when the sun actually set - so that was something different.  Would go again just for the sunset."
39,Mindil Beach Highly Recommended,One of the mandatory stops to enjoy sunset on the beach especially if the market is on! (Be aware not recommended to swim) Love it
40,NICE BEACH.,"Mindil beach markets probably the best you will find especially if you are a food buff. great selection , then dine on the beach and watch the most brilliant of sunsets, definitely an absolutely must in the top end !"
41,Mindil beach markets at sunset,Went to Mindel beach market on my recent holiday to Darwin. It is a very large market and has plenty of food options the sunset is worth a look on the beach can get very crowded. Thursday night is the quieter of the nights to have a look.
42,Food and more food,went to Mindil beach the day of the beer can regatta. Was a bit disappointed as the build up was more than the experience. Markets are like any other markets and lots of food stalls
43,Over rated!,"Lots of food options but much of it is not much different to the standard food court offerings.  The ""craft"" stalls were very disappointing and its a fairly ordinary place to watch the sunset.Walk along to the casino and grab a beer, sit on the terrace instead."
44,Best sunset,the thing that i like here is not the beach but instead the hustle and bustle in the market of course
45,We will miss our regular Thursday and sunday,If your into food from all over the world and street entertainment this is the place to be on a nice warm night.  Pick your favourite food and then settle down on the beach and watch the sunset!
46,Julie,"We visited Mindil Beach in afternoon for the Markets (Thurs and Sunday).There was plenty of variety in the food stalls and those we tried had great food.There were other clothing, leather and jewellery stalls beside  misc. others.Live entertainment was also provided.Beach faces west so there is opportunity to witness a fantastic sunset too."
47,Fantastic Place To Watch The Sunset,"Lots to see, do and eat at the Mindil beach markets. Food from all nationalities and the usual market stalls. Sunset so beautiful, a great place for families and couples."
48,mindil beach,"Right beside Mindil Markets, I would rather the beach.  A nice beach bu Darwin standards with good swimming and sunbathing.  Last time we were there a crocodile was sunning itself on the sand. Not too many swimmers that day!"
49,Amazing markets,Yes a market with local wares and close to beach. My advise is don't swim there ... crocs a possibility and the locals don't use it. Perhaps a good place for 'street food' but few 'healthy choices'.
50,Great Markets,We went to the Sunday night markets which are extremely well supported. I think most of Darwin were there. Many tourist went to watch the brilliant colours of the sunset over the water. There was great variety of food to choose from as well as entertainment. Well worth a visit if in Darwin.
51,Perfect Way to End a Tiring Day,"We were lucky enough to get to the Mindil Markets twice during our visit to Darwin and it is a must do for so many reasons. The food is fresh, ample and meets every taste there could be. Fussy eaters are covered as are savoury and sweet eaters. Drinks are freshly juiced but you can bring your own. There is some seating but if you byo chairs you can sit anywhere. There is live entertainment which included acrobats from the Darwin festival and the Navy band playing at sunset on the beach when we were there. Amazing....Market stalls sell a range of clothing, jewellery, skin care, massage - like most markets but the food is mostly separate from the rest so you can tour one area then find your dinner in the other. Everyone is really calm and friendly, sharing chairs and tables as they empty but the real show starts when the sun starts to go down.  Most people go down to the shore and watch the evening performance as though it was theatre, even a round of applause once the last flicker of sunlight dips below the horizon.It is one of the many iconic feel good Darwin experiences and I will go there again next time I‚Äôm in town just because it makes you happy to be in the top end."
52,Afternoon Delight,Highlight of our trip. Love markets but was so consumed with the view and atmosphere I almost forgot there was a market on. Food vans aplenty and great variety and value. The sunsets here are spectacular.
53,Gorgeous ,Stunning sunsets and the markets are awesome! Went back more than once during stay - so much mixture of cultures and tasty cuisines on offer
54,Sunset over Darwin,"Arrived in time for sunset, which was a great social event. Market not so much.. very crowded and we didn't see anything we wanted. Had a good paella tho, which we ate on the beach."
55,Sunset in paradise,"Heard about it but had no idea how popular it is among tourists and locals alike.A huge variety of quality food trucks, rather than try and list them all, let's say 15 international cuisine varieties and multiples of several.Lots of market stalls to buy souvenirs and trinkets as well as clairvoyant, massages, buskers etc.Then the sunset - and this happens daily!!  There are probably certain weather conditions that make one more spectacular than another, but even a normal one is impressive, add in the market, food trucks and buskers and it becomes the must see Darwin experience.The market is seasonal, the sunset daily."
56,Great food market with interesting stalls ,Had a wander around the markets at Mindil Beach. Lots of different food choices and things to see. Very busy
57,market day,"The sunset and markets were what I went to see, not disappointed.I was amazed at the number of people there, hundreds.We had food and it was great, very good."
58,Nt sunset,"Enjoy a meal from the Mindil Markets while watching the sun set over the water. This is always a novelty for an East Coaster. Mindil Beach does not have the best surf or the whitest of sand and can get quite busy during peak and market times, but it is a beautiful place to sit and relax if you time it just right."
59,Market ,Great fun night on the beach walking through the local wares of the market and sampling different foods which were yum. To finish off the night we sat in the beach watching the amazing sunset. Great atmosphere. A must do while in Darwin
60,A must see for visitors ,The night market at Mindel beach is an interesting event it on Thursday night from 5to9 pm packed to the brim and can be hard to get a parking spot . We went about 7.30pm and it was easier but then ur time is limited as they close at 9pm. If ur earlier the sun set is beautiful. Lots of good food and loads of different jewellery.
61,Everything we had imagined ,"It was far too crowded for me to enjoy,  like most Darwin outdoor events there were dozens of food stalls, hope you don't mind sitting in amongst the enormous crowd too eat. Get there very early,  eat and then go to one of hundreds of other empty places to watch the sundown. You might get a clear view here from wast deep water."
62,Thursday Night markets,Our favourite place for a nice snack and sunset picnic during the dry season..Great food..some entertainment on most nights...Great people watching
63,Amazing place. .,"We enjoyed the ambience of the many eateries on offer however not as many craft stalls as expected.  After purchasing our meal and sitting on the lawns to eat it, we were politely told to move on as our little dog with us was not permitted."
64,"Lovely place for a Sunset visit, lots of food available","Great market, lots of food from food vans, local artists and entertsinment.  It gets very busy so go early"
65,"First trip to the ""Top End"".","Luckily we were in Darwin on a Sunday night, so were able to visit the markets on Mindil Beach. The markets were extensive, with lots of options for a variety of local products, and plenty of food options. There was some entertainment - not sure if this is a regular feature - but the big bonus was having dinner on the beach, along with literally hundreds of others, watching another of those Darwin sunsets!"
66,Market and Sunset,"Brought the family for the Sunday markets hoping to get some good local buys. Markets were a mix of local items plus your usual stuff you can get anywhere. You are spoilt for choice with food offerings and it was hard to pick what to eat, food vendors also require cash. Sunset one the beach was great but packed. Clean toilets. Get there early for easy parking. Parking is free"
67,Do you like crowds?,The sunset is spectacular. Absolutely stunning but the markets need an overhaul. Many stalls are old and run down.
68,Darwin's popular sunset market - don't miss it. ,"The market stalks are mostly food - everything we had was delicious. There are a few other stalls, eg jewellery. The sunset is beautiful but be prepared for crowds on the beach!"
69,Magical sunset,"Plenty of food at the markets and the sunset is spectacular.We were told there is crocs in the water so be careful. It maybe a myth, but swim at own risk lol. Pull up a spot on the sand and watch the sun set."
70,Mindil beach evening ,"This is an ordinary beach, which is located quite far from the city center.The hype surrounding this beach (and its markets) is totally exaggerated, and we could not find a particular appeal to it."
71,Evening market ,It is an amazing spot to watch the sunset - plus the market on every Sunday and Thursday. We enjoyed dining there and shopping.
72,Such a lovely place to have diner!,Cable Beach Broome is better but still worth a visit especially when Markets are on. (Sunday and Thursday late afternoon/evening only in dry season I think).
73,Markets and then sunset! Yay,"Visiting the Mindil Beach Night Markets, buying dinner and eating it on the beach watching the sunset is an unforgettable event. The casual calm atmosphere as everyone is doing the same activity as you makes for a special event."
74,Best market,"Mindil beach is a nice looking beach, great for taking photos, and great to see the sunset. BUT WHATS THE POINT IF YOU CANT SWIM IN IT. Can someone answer me that ?"
75,A must do in Darwin,"Markets were disappointing, overpriced and not a lot of variation. Food stalls were very expensive. It was lovely to go onto the beach and watch the sunset . Very popular must have been thousands there."
76,"Sunset, people galore, and food food food","We were only overnight in Darwin and were recommended to go to the Mindil Beach Night Markets - lucky for us it was a Thursday! We got ourselves some food from one of the many food stalls and wandered off to the beach.  Amazing beach, and what a sight with so many people there - we were blown away - especially when the sun went down. What a good market it was too, many and varied! Watched a diggery doo player, saw a stocky cracking his crocodile whip and listened to a magic man trying to sell his wares - it was all there!  This is definitely a must do while in Darwin."
77,Foodie extraveganza,"Aussie Bogan Kitch. OK, so the sunset is OK but the beach is very average. The markets have heaps of really crappy, poor quality souvenirs, t-shirts aimed squarely at bogan Aussies and the food is mostly bain-marie Chinese with copious amounts of battered chicken and spring rolls. I guess there's not a lot going on in Darwin, so a visit here is mandatory. We very underwhelmed and certainly wouldn't bother wasting another 10-minutes visiting this place. Parap Village Markets Darwin are a much better, more cultured experience."
78,Very Popular,These markets are a must visit. the smells of food from a round the world tempts your taste. Only open on Sundays due to Covid.
79,VERY PLEASANT OUTING.,"Lots of fun, great food, great vibe, amazing sunset!!  The two guys doing the fog and drumming set were amazing. We are vegan and had one of the best laksa! Watching the sun go down on the beach is spectacular!!"
80,Gorgeous Sunset,Mindil beach offers the most stunning sunsets. I normally tie in a mindil beach visit with going to the markets so there is always a lot of people around however you can easily find your own space to stand and watch the sun set over the ocean.
81,Sunset at Mindil Beach,"Mindil markets on territory day were fantastic, live entertainment, great food stalls, fireworks, fantastic night, just remember to bring cash as most stalls do not have eftpos or credit card facilities"
82,Variety of food,Attend often during the dry season. Very laidback atmosphere with lots of variety of food outlets and stalls.
83,Amazing food aromas,Excellent meal at the Ski club and sunset drinks - very casual - a fun place to cool off watch the sun go down
84,Mindil Markets,"Came here for the sunset as had been told it was a must do...Very impressive beach with lovely white sand, gets very packed closer to sunset but definitely worth the visit.Mindil markets there on Thurs and Sun so you can grab your dinner and enjoy the sunset"
85,Somewhat over rated,"Mindil Beach during March is very quiet and peaceful. Thus, it is a great meditative environment. I dumped my cats' cremated ashes here four years ago, so I paid homage to them during this recent visit. The beautiful mangroves and calm tides are soothing to the soul.  This paradise also honors the great Aboriginal communities."
86,Interesting markets with fantastic sunset views,We walked to the market from town and arrived before sunset. So many people on the beach enjoying the sunset it was a great experience. Loved every minute of my time here and will definitely be back.
87,Markets and beach,The Mindil markets were ok however they didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. I found them to be a lot of food and not to much local goodies to buy. Food was ok and get in early as parking it had to find close by. Food and drinks are a good price
88,"Beautiful sunset, great roof stalls","Was lots of fun, a bit toutisty lots of great food stalls and some local crafts. Fantastic atmosphere."
89,Sunset ,"We went to the Thursday Markets to end our trip out. A busy little market, more ready to eat food than crafts etc, but some very interesting smells and appetising aromas. We ate at the road kill cafe, to experience crock etc.Watched a Beautiful sunset with our coffee on the beach. Great night, good public transport to/from town."
90,Bustling beach for sunset ,"The most delicious food, you won‚Äôt be able to resist the smells wafting around, the entertainment and THAT sunset! A must do on a trip to Darwin."
91,Best mixed Asian market food and sunset.,"First time in Darwin, markets are very nice, food is fantastic with lots of choices.  Plenty of stalls with art, clothes etc.  Sunset views are great.  99% of stalls are cash only.  There are places to sit to eat and entertainment.  It‚Äôs only abut 2 km from the CBD if you like to walk or bus/taxi available.  If you visit Darwin you should go at least once"
92,"Sunset on beach great, market OK",Really good selection of food with sunset whilst sitting on the beach. What more could you ask for in the Top End?
93,Fun. Must do,"Love the atmosphere at the Mindil Beach markets. I‚Äôm not convinced about recommending grabbing some dinner and eating on the beach, while watching the sunset. The beach was so busy I experienced a man walking past my dinner and kicking sand all through it, so maybe eat before or after heading to the beach lol."
94,Sunset was amazing ,"Great spot, although very crowded. Lots of food options and then nice beach to watch the sunset. Good parking available and easy to find."
95,Markets are a must do,"An absolutely incredible place for a sunset, so beautiful. The market makes it even more fantastic, lots of great places to eat, drink and shop."
96,Fish dinner,"Decent for a quick dinner after viewing the sunset which was pretty nice. Markets were nothing to shout about, typical Australian markets fanfare, though variety was great. Got 1/2 a dozen oysters amongst other asian food. Half of those oysters were not fresh sadly."
97,A Darwin highlight - must see/do,Market looking a bit tired and commercial since the last time we visited. Plentiful food stalls though and most are well priced. The rest of the market I found a bit disappointing- still the sunset is amazing!!!!
98,A must see in Darwin,Markets and local characters were an experience to behold. Lots of very yummy food options. Art and craft also good and of course Mindil Beach sunset - however any beach on Fannie Bay is equally as spectular to watch sunset - love a good sunset over water.
99,Missed the markets but still beautiful for a sunset,Great little big market lots of food selection no second hand junk like other markets prices reasonable and can wander down to the beach for the amazing sunset
100,Sunset Is Out of this World ! ,"This is THE place to be to see the amazing sunsets. On Thursday and Sunday the Mindle markets are on, you can buy all types of food, bring a big appetite. Craft markets also. But the sunset is the best part of the night. Big bright reddish/orange sunsets absolutely beautiful"
101,Wonderful array of food choices from Asian to middle eastern ,"There are many weekend markets in Darwin: Rapid Creek, Nightcliff, Parap but nothing can beat the setting of the sun over the waters of Darwin Harbour on a balmy Sunday evening. Mindil Beach night  market is twice weekly (Thursday and Sunday) from Anzac Day in April to the end of October. There's only a few left this season. A huge variety of foods are available along food alley dominated by Asian cuisine but with a wide offering of other types and styles including Mexican and Greek, finger food and pizza, fresh juices and smoothies and fresh mango. Many of the vendors from the wonderful Saturday Parap market are offering their wares, creations and services including art, jewellery, clothing, aboriginal artifacts and massages. And there is entertainment at a couple of locations. This was my fourth visit over the years. There's always a crowd and the locals come equipped with chairs, rugs and picnic tables. There are some tables and chairs for visitors and others close to the entertainment. But it's all about the beach and the sunset over the harbour. Parking can be a problem on really busy nights but tonight was not one of them."
102,Night market at a Mindil Beach,"This is a seasonal place and we managed to visit on the last week before the annual closure. It‚Äôs located on the beach foreshore, lots of parking and easy access from the CBD. Whatever your food desires you are sure to find it here. Stroll along and check the stalls out before making your choice. Reasonable priced this is the place for an early evening feed. Recommended Sri Lanka curry and Laksa. Enjoy"
103,A nice night out! ,A must do for Darwin. Great value and food brilliant. Go and try. Transport easy by public bus or hotel shuttle.
104,Sunset viewing area,"Amazing sunset and lots of great food choices. Personally, I thought the market itself was overhyped!"
105,Mindil Beach Markets,"We went to Mindil beach markets and you are spoilt for choice for something to eat as there is food stalls galore,I had the Buffalo burger,yummy.you can then go and watch the fantastic sunset on the beach."
106,Sunset place ,"Great beach, we went to the beer can regatta & markets heaps to see , plenty of food stalls & handy crafts"
107,Sunset markets and sunset ,A fantastic array of inexpensive food options in a relaxed setting by the beachGet a cheap feed and sit and watch theSunset. You might wish to bring a rug orTowel to sit on as seating is at a real premium. Tried some fab Sri Lankan curries washed down with a fresh mangoLassi. A Darwin dry season must.
108,Disappointing ,"While in Darwin it is a must see to check out Mindil Beach. It is located very close to the Casino. The views are spectacular, but not many people go here to swim in the water, but it is most definitely worth checking out. I was here during the wet season in the summer so this could be another reason why people were not in the sea."
109,Mindil Beach,"My go to place for sunsets. Even better when the markets are on , just make sure you lock your vehicle and hide personal items"
110,Mindle markets,Visited here to see sunset and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. A beautiful stretch of beach facing west so really benefits from its position if you‚Äôre searching for a great sunset. Grab a drink from the Sand Bar in the casino and then wander down to the beach through the resort gardens. Memorable experience
111,Mindil markets,"Soft powdery sand, clean beach and a great spot for sunset. Head there on market day to get some fantastic food from all over the world!"
112,A great place to visit for some really scrumptious food.,Thursday and Sunday's are the busy days due to the amazing markets. The beach is covered with families getting a spot to see Darwin's day end. The sky goes a beautiful colour as the sun disappears under the horizon.
113,Great Afternoon Evening,"This main beach is accessible from the city but it's a bit of a walk. The beach itself is nice but there's hardly any shade and - good to know - it's not safe to swim due to jelly fishes, sharks etc."
114,Great evening market place,My wife and I primarily visited Darwin for the Mindil Market after hearing rave reviews of it. Obviously what comes with the Market is the sunset on Mindil Beach. It‚Äôs a great place to catch a sunset BUT there are other locations which give just as good a view (with less sand in your feet). At the  lookout next to Darwin high school you can get some great pics of the sunset and also at the casino (with grass to sit on) is great. The photos show Mindil Beach from the lookout and also a sunset from there
115,Just do it. ,Nice beach to watch the sunset and markets on a Thursday/Sunday are big with lots of locally made items for sale. Entertainment and food.
116,Little Dissapointed,This beach has a really lovely sunset The musicians were very good particularly the digeridoo player and the whip cracker other than that we wernt overly impressed on the market food or variety of stalls
117,Great Beach,If a view of the sunset is what you are chasing then Mindil Beach is the a place to go.  The beach is packed on a Thursday and Sunday when the Mindil Beach Markets are on (Great for an international feast or local wares)  the sunsets need to be seen and each day is different.
118,"Great market, the VIP area not really worth it","Was surprised at the scale of this event- massive variety of food from many cultures, local produce at fair prices and a large, happy crowd which oddly clapped as the sun disappeared below the horizon.Was a bit surprised however that at an iconic event like this, that there were no outlets selling beer or wine. Nevertheless it was a really enjoyable evening and a must do."
119,VIP at market for sunset,Great food stalls and sunset . I could not decide on what I wanted to eat after walking through the whole markets as every stall offered something different and smelt amazing . So much choice . A must do in Darwin ... don‚Äôt miss out on this one .
120,Wonderful markets,"Been multiple times to watch the sunset, quite a lot of people there during the dry season but its still a really lovely place to visit! Can even bring a beer! Absolutely beautiful!"
121,Great beach with night markets and sunset views,"If you can get to the markets, they have a great atmosphere.  We were only able to get to the beach for sunset this time but it was so beautiful"
122,Amazing beach!,Sunset is stunning from Mindil. Grab a blanket and sit on the beach. Markets on Thurs and Sun 4-9 in dry season but still great (and quieter!) on other days.
123,Stunning ,"Lots to see and do at the markets, enormous selection of food, friendly stall holders with some really interesting products. Then you can enjoy eating your dinner while watching a spectacular sunset"
124,How breathtaking,Hands down the best place to view a Darwin sunset - the night markets are right next to the beach too so watch the sunset then grab dinner at one of the many food stalls.
125,As good as they say,"Great selection of food, the aroma through the market was amazing and the choices were plentiful. Wonderful sunset, lots of entertainment a  fantastic evening. Would highly recommend this market when in Darwin."
126,Lovely beach especially at sunset,"We went along to the twice weekly Mindil beach evening market, huge range of stalls of local art work and international food choice. Very popular, great atmosphere and a fun way to spend a few hours. Spectacular sunset too!"
127,Mindil Beach Sunset markets,The sunset on the beach was spectacular but moreover the amount of people who congregated there was unbelievable!!! The markets are ok but not anything special
128,Don't get all the fuss - clearly most visitors haven't been to decent markets,Great beach to view the timeless Darwin sunset and get some amazing photos. Don't forget to visit when the market is on with its eclectic fare and food to die for!
129,Gorgeous sunsets,"Sunday night 4-9pm mindil holds good and wares markets filled with local and foreign food, there was something for everyone. Plus live band entertainment and fire twirlers"
130,Beautiful sunset,Stop here in the dry for a brilliant Darwin ocean sunset. The Mindil markets are a must see in a Thursday and Sunday evening
131,Visited the market x2!!,"We arrived at the markets very early to get a good parking spot so we were able to have a good look around before the crowds. It was my first time and I couldn't believe all the stalls of goodies and food, we.  were spoilt for choice. The music was fantastic and the didgeredos had big crowds around them. Around 6.25pm we moved on to the beach and watched a glorious sunset with the rest of Darwin it seemed. From there some more music and a bite to eat then I picked up some early Christmas presents for my family. It was a win win evening. Would I go again? In a flash,  when my feet and legs have recovered though."
132,Great Food Market and Bric Brac,"A great night at the market (only selected times, not every night ) with a vast selection of international foods. Great sunsets, nice beach. Very relaxing!"
133,Just another market,"Fantastic market with lots of great food and art/craft/souvenir stalls, plus live music. No alcohol, but you can BYO. Come early and grab a spot in the lawn or beach to watch the spectacular sunset. We paid to sit in the VIP area but it wasn't really worth it, apart from the provision of an esky with ice for you to put your drinks in. If you have your own esky or don't need one, I wouldn't bother. You can't see the sunset from the VIP area anyway, and it's literally just a fenced off bit of grass with some trestle tables."
134,Well worth a visit,The markets were interesting and a huge choice of food stalls. But the best part was watching the sunset from the beach. There were so many people!!
135,Great sunset,"Grat market easy to get there by local bus but not so easier getting back especially on the Sundau.Heaps of food choices to enjoy on the beach and watch the sun go down.Excellent entertainment and a variety of stall of craft, clothes ,massages etc.Well worth it just to have your tea there! Reasonably priced, if you cant find something you like you must be fussy :)"
136,The sunsets are amazing!,"It was a pity but food was bad and very much a let down , putting it down to the virus. Only good really, went there many years ago and it was banging"
137,Mindel Beach Sunset is the best,"Love these markets! Some stalls take Eftpos but most are cash-only. Make sure you bring cash, there are 2 portable ATMs on site but queues where long. Make sure you move onto beach to see sunset with all the other people!"
138,Darwin visit,Wandered to the beach from the Casino Resort to view the famous Mindil Beach sunset.It didn't disappoint. Absolutely stunning.
139,"Awesome!! Stunning sunset, great markets!","Went to the market and beach for yhe sunset. Lots of people there but heaps of room on the beach! Sunset was pretty but there was low cloud, so the sun disappeared behind that. Lovely clean beach and soft sand, could definitely spend the day here!"
140,Romantic,Great place to grab variety of good food...crocs souvenirs..listen to some live music played by locals and lastly catch the sunset by the beach! Bus no. 4 goes here and goes in a loop to the city centre. Fare is A$3 valid for 3 hours; which means you can hop on and off the buses within the next 3 hours. üòä
141,Stunning sunset,we returned many times for not only the spectacular sunset but the  atmosphere with stalls from many different cultures represented.
142,Mindil Beach,"The mindil market is great. Good food stalls so you can catch a bite to eat and go and watch the sunset. It‚Äôs very busy so I would advise to get there early to get a park. The also have some entertainment in the form of music ect. I bought some souvenirs for the family which were unique and overall a good night. If you find it hard to deal with crowds don‚Äôt go, but I would recommend the experience."
143,Mindil beach,"1st time at Mindil Beach Night Market. What a fantastic experience, magnificent food and atmosphere with great array of goods. We brought our own table and chairs (and esky) which made it the perfect night. Tried a little bit of everything we liked and it was all good. The Sunset completes the night. A must for anyone visiting Darwin. My advice is get there early if you need a parking spot."
144,Market,"Best markets we have been to in Australia. Great food, wonderful atmosphere and lovely arts and crafts."
145,Sit with many for a relaxing 30-60 minutes and let your cares drift away...,Busy evening market with large range of food stalls. Some art and craft stalls. Great people watching.
146,What a Sight!,Went to the Mindel market for the first time. Wow so busy and so much different food. Loved it. Then watched the magnificent sunset on the beach with thousands of other people a great experience.
147,"Beautiful sunset, Typical market","Every boys trip to Darwin we frequent the Mindil Markets on the Thursday evening and it never disappoints. Here you will find street foods from all different cultures. After four visits still have not tried half! South east Asian, Greek Italian, all sorts of sweets and when you finish eating there are also trinkets, arts and other items to buy. There is a live band who play a medium rock with didgeridoo the prominent instrument, great listening to, definitely worth the visit"
148,Average,"Perfect place to watch the sunset. On Thursday night, visits the market, buy something very Darwinish, buy food from one of the many food vans, eat on the beach while the sun goes down."
149,Stunning sunset views,Went to the markets on Thursday there was quite a few food stalls some good choices the market stalls were not that great not a lot of them and a few the same thought it would be a lot bigger
150,Mindel markets,Had a great time. Beautiful atmosphere. Plenty of great food and lots to buy. Top entertainment. The weather was great the beach lovely
151,Nice spot for sunset,I was surprised by the number of food trucks. There is a lot of great food and it‚Äôs relaxing be able to sit on the sand and watch the sun set while eating dinner. The music and atmosphere on a warm night was pleasant. Some stalls are pricey but I picked up a painting at a great price.
152,Great Sunset,"Not recommended for swimming but bthis beach is a lovely place to take a walk, especially in the evening as the sun goes down. A better view of the sunset would be hard to find."
153,Sunset on the beach,"Amazing sunsets, visited  with the family. Take a blanket, some child beer and watch the sun go done while sitting on he grass. ( Put on some bug-spray !!)"
154,Loved this experience,Absolutely lovely lots of great food stallsAnd souvenirs..Purchased great fridge magnets there The sunset is so beautiful I thought I was in heaven...
155,Best sunsets ever!,"A Darwin icon, this market has dozens of food stalls, craft stalls and live entertainment. It can be crowded but there a VIP area where you can sit (for a price ) away from the crowds. The sunset is not to be missed."
156,Beautiful sunset,The beach itself is great although at sunset it does get quite busy. The sunset is great too. The sand is quite fine and the beach is compact.The markets were pretty ho hum for me. Lot‚Äôs of stalls and food outlets but a lot sell the same or similar stuff. Worth going to see at least to say you‚Äôve been there and done that and tick it off of the bucket list.
157,A must do ,"Went to Mindil Beach on a Sunday before and after attending the craft market. Watching a magical sunset and thought to myself, ""yes Im glad I took the time to come here"""
158,Fabulous sunsets!,"Nice beach, but a bit too murky in the water for my liking.  Very quiet and plenty of little crabs and shells on the beach. Lifeguard there and no scary ‚ÄúCrocodiles‚Äù warnings, so we braved the water and it was warm. No shade and no chairs, so didn‚Äôt stay long."
159,Great sunset,Never fails to impress.  Such a cool market with so many different food stalls.  BBQ octopus while watching the sunset was the bomb. Love these markets.
160,Nice spot to watch the sunset,"In addition to attending the market and being forced to choose which one of many meals you will have to limit your ‚Äòtea‚Äô to, take time to sit and listen to music, browse people‚Äôs wares at the many stalls and end up on the beach for the sunset looking west from a very northerly view point. What a relaxing way to spend a few hours from nearby Darwin City."
161,Gorgeous visit at sunset.,Mindil Beach is a lovely place to catch the sunset (as long as the clouds stay away) and then go on to the food market there in the evening.There's lots of stalls with different food offerings so you're bound to find somethiing you like. There are a few other shops scattered around but it's mainly a food market.
162,Pretty Beach,The beach is lovely and well worth a visit but the majority of people who come here are for the Mindil Beach markets (I believe). The markets are mainly food but many of the outlets charge ridiculous prices for a meal where you have to stand or sit on a rock to eat. Cheap eats can be found by hunting around but i will wont ever go back there.
163,Do not miss these markets,"We had a couple of visits to the Mindil markets and really enjoyed it. The sunset is amazing, the food was great and there was a large variety to choose from. Lots of good local produce available. We also really enjoyed the musicians playing the drums and Didgeridoo.Well worth a visit."
164,Magnificent sunset,"Don't believe I have ever seen so many people on a beach at sunset. Good vibe and you can byo which is nice, especially coming from Sydney were that is a major crime"
165,Sunset views,"Wow, this was so much bigger than one can imagine, hundreds of Market Stalls, lots of food vans/trucks/stalls to choose from, entertainment, and a superbly beautiful sunset. The hardest part was deciding what to eat and the easiest, despite the thousand or more people, was deciding where to sit and watch sunset from."
166,Evening market,"A tropical market (in season) with the added bonus of a beach sunset. Well worth considering for food and local fare. Like Bali but in safe and clean Australia, same climate, good choice of food and no humbugging."
167,Beautiful sunset,The sunset is good but apart from that it‚Äôs a muddy beach you can‚Äôt swim in. I guess if you enjoy a long walk along a long beach that could work.
168,Great Atmosphere and huge variety of food,Need to be there by about 4.30 for good car park and easy entry. Blanket or camp chairs are a great idea so when you select your dinner from about 30 different vendors across so many cultures you can sit and enjoy it. BYO is fine. No liquor on sale. The squid was so fresh and tender. Just fantastic. Lots of other crafty stalls. Great 2-3 hours.
169,The beach is terrific but,"Amazing kaleidoscope of people, food, tents, animals, entertainment at the weekly Markets. Then there was the beautiful beach, where an enormous crowd attended to watch the sunset.  Some danced to it, some clapped, The experience was and is now, memorable"
170,Great Sunset,it was great to go to the Mindil beach markets for the amazing sunset. There are stalls selling all different kinds of things to buy.They also have food stalls so you can buy something to eat. If you get there early enough they also have entertainment.
171,Bucket List Tick,The place to watch the sun sink below the horizon. Lively when matched with the Thursday and Sunday markets. Just Magic.
172,Great Darwin culture,"Have visited Darwin many times over the last 30 years and a visit to Mindil Markets and to view the Sunset is always a must do on every visit, The variety of food stalls is amazing and they really highlight the diversity of Darwins population. Market stalls are always worth a browse and the sunset has never let e down. Go see for yourself."
173,So much to see! ,A must see in Darwin. Join thousands of people at the markets and on the beach at sunset but don‚Äôt forget your insect repellent.
174,Very beautiful ,"A lovely spot  in a beautful location,  where one can check out the craft stalls or just  sit and enjoy tasty food that is on offer from many food venues. - There is enough parking and is free ."
175,Amazing sunset spot,"Meeting some old friends at the grassy area behind the dunes. Great choice of foods for all the family. Bring your own chairs, and go down to the beach to catch the sunset."
176,Great food market and lovely sunsets,"A short beach with beautiful sunsets. It‚Äôs also pleasant during the day but unfortunately you can‚Äôt swim. Every Thursday and Sunday there is a market with lots of different types of food. Also you can buy clothes, jewellery , art etc."
177,Nice sunset ,We arrived early and had space to look at all the stalls. Went back after dinner on the beach and it was madness with lots of people everywhere. It was great to get several different dishes and eat on the beach watching the stunning sunset. Great way to end your day in darwin
178,Beer can regatta,Nice beach with no one on it - can‚Äôt swim in the sea due to saltwater crocs & box jellyfish both of which can prove fatal. Sunset viewing area with a weekly market
179,Great night Market.,Good sunset and vibe. Plenty of people about. Good time to just relax and chill out. Mick‚Äôs whips entertaining.
180,your mad if you dont go,"One of the best markets in Australia, a must place to visit and have dinner while in Darwin. A variety of food stalls at good prices and entertainment too. Be prepared for this place to be very busy and arrive in time to see the sun going down out at sea."
181,Friday night lubch,Nice markets. Great food. Fantastic sunsets. Well worth a visit. Friendly stall holders. Something for everybody.
182,Markets are a must do,Lots of fun and great food choices.  Grab a meal and sit on beach to watch the sunset. A must to do in Darwin
183,Love beach sunsets,A must when in Darwin - visiting the Mindil Beach markets and experiencing the amazing sunsets. The variety of foods available was extraordinary and the crafts were unique to the Territory.  A great visit.
184,Great spot to see some local products ,This is a really  great place to watch the sunset and if there on a Sunday or  Thursday evening you can also do the markets.
185,Best sunset with crowds ,Went just for a look as friends have raved about itSunset was just beautiful You can actually watch the sun actually going down.If you blink you miss itThe colours are stunning
186,Great sunset,"Great sunset view, but the sea does look a bit croc-y so I didn't get too close.For some reason people clap when the sun goes under the horizon - funny to watch as someone from the west coast!"
187,Wow,The Mindil resort is great if you are looking for a place to relax and enjoy some sun and cocktails by the pool. It has a beautiful quiet lagoon style pool with beach and lovely swim up bar. I would recommend they have a more child friendly drink options such as milk shakes and slushies by the pool and also being able to have a coffee there would be nice too. Not everyone is after alcohol all of the time but other than that it‚Äôs a lovely resort  with easy access to the markets and beautiful sunsets.
188,Sunday market the place to be,"We have been in the past and it was about the same, the food variety was great. The entertainment wasn't as good we felt so we left early. Having said that if you have never been to the evening markets here please make an effort even if it is just to see the fabulous sunset."
189,Mind beach,Heaps of food to choose from. Fab sunset and well worth the visit. You can‚Äôt do Darwin without visiting the markets.
190,Mindil Sunset Markets,Fantastic watching the sun go down with friends sat on the beach with freshly made food from the beach Market and a cold beer. Sublime.
191,Great markets and stunning sunset,Really enjoyed this market and the sunset was awesome.  The variety of food was amazing. Had a ball. The stalls were great too and well priced.
192,Great Market on Sundays,Was a really nice place to wander around we had finger food from a number of places and most pretty good also brought a few items of clothing .
193,Amazing sunsets,"Popped over to Mindil Beach just before sunset for a walk and then up to the Night Markets. Nice beach, warm and shallow. Night markets are 70% food and 30% trinket trash."
194,Beautiful sunset,"Beautiful spot to sit and watch the sun  go down, only downside is that because it's so nice, there are thousands of people some nights. #anxiety"
195,Sunsets supreme ,A great place to watch the sun disappear and a 'must do' on your trip to Darwin!   Drop in at the Mindil Beach Markets (April - October) for one of the best experiences in the Top End.
196,WHATS THE POINT,Markets on Thursday and Sunday evenings which have food stalls and other accessories to purchase. Sunset views are stunning.
197,Watch out for miggies ,Mindel Beach market operates each Thursday and Sunday and is well worth a visit if only to see the sunset.  There is a good variety of food and craft stalls available.
198,Stunning sunset ,"Great market with plenty of different types of cuisines and the usual market stuff, great location to sit on the beach while eating your food and watching the sunset"
199,"Sunset on the beach ok, but the market didn't work for us","On our way to our hotel from the airport we took a 5 minute diversion to check out Mindil Beach.  It was great to dip your toes in the sea, and in the afternoon there wasn't a lot of people around so we had great photos of the beach without a lot of people in the shots!Mindil also gives you great shots looking out towards Timor/Indonesia without land on the other side in the way (as is the case from Darwin CBD sea views)."
200,Great spot,Definitely a place to stop and have a look!  When the market is on grab some great food and watch the magic unfold. Have been many times üòç
201,Amazing Sunday Night Sunset and Market,Never disappointed when we come to Darwin. Mindil Beach is one of the first places we go-to.  The ambient sunsets are so dynamic to view when there is storm is brewing.
202,Great,"Awesome. A staple of Darwin‚Äôs Dry Season experience, it never ceases to impress. Great street food - something for everyone. We‚Äôve been coming here for over a decade, and will keep coming back for years to come!"
203,Sunset,"What‚Äôs not to like about this market... it‚Äôs iconic, it‚Äôs on in the cool of the evening, plenty of stalls and eateries, the to watch the sun go down.... it‚Äôs amazing ..."
204,Amazing sunsets ,"We visited these markets on a Thursday night and they were popping.  Darwin has a great community, a great culture seemingly more open and relaxed to the bigger Aussie cities. Its generally a great vibe. Tip: get cash out if you want to buy food, that was only mistake and limited our options.The sunset is amazing! A must if visiting Darwin. Check times as i think these markets only run on thursdays and sundays."
205,Darwin trip ,"Lots of people crowd the beach for the sunset, then lots of people crowd back to rebrowse through the markets before crowding the roads to leave. Wasn't anything special, was expecting more local made items, very little of these."
206,A Great Evening at the Markets,"I don‚Äôt go to this beach other than when there is something on. The Beach has regular sunset markets Thurs and Sun in the dry season. Cracker night on 1 July is always the best place. They have the market set up, live music and a huge display of fireworks which lasts for 30 mins, they are spectacular. Their are other events like fun runs and beer can regatta. At public events there is people guiding the traffic to carpark which take the stress out of trying to find a park. Otherwise on market night you find your own, but there is heaps of room. If you visiting Darwin and staying in the city, it‚Äôs easy to catch a bus. Mindil Beach is the best place to see a sunset, the main event. Highly recommend a visit whilst in Darwin."
207,Sunset was great!,We were last in Darwin nearly 30 years ago and i had fond memories of Mindil Beach and the sunset market. These days  the food on offer is what you‚Äôd find in any food court so of average quality and nothing different. We didn‚Äôt even bother to eat here. The merchandise stalls were ok but there seemed to be more food vans than stalls selling things. Again nothing worth buying. I‚Äôve heard the Parap market is good so will try that one next time. Sunset was nice but you can view that from anywhere on Fannie Bay with less tourists around.
208,awesome sunset,"Not just your average market. It has a great variety of food, atmosphere and soul. Make sure you visit and allow time to chill.Perfect for the gift to take home"
209,Great Night Markets,"This is THE place to observe a lovely Darwin sunset. Try and do so on either a Sunday or, more particularly a Thursday when the Mindil beach markets are on. Lovely market with lots of stalls and yummy food outlets. The bus takes about 10 min to get back into the city."
210,Get there in time to see the sunset!,I love the markets and watching the sun going down at Mindil Beach. We have been here every time we go to Darwin and still love going and seeing the different arts and crafts on show.
211,Magnificent ,Nearly everyday I go to Mindil to watch the sunset. I recommend anyone to go when the markets are open
212,Fun evening ,Really lovely beach went there to have a few beers and watch the sunset! Really chilled and a nice vibe we also went to the markets afterwards which was cool.
213,Must do markets!,A nice place to visit. Lots of market stands with food from all of the Asian area. Some market stands with local artifacts tot be bought. The beach is nearby to enjoy the Sunset.
214,Amazing sunset,"Awesome variety of foods and clothes for women men and children, lots of colourful outfits for the ladies to choose from. prices varying. Some cool nick nack stuff and entertainment too :)"
215,Best markets around with a bonus sunset,We arrived on a Sunday and went straight to the Mindil Beach Night Markets!!! Grabbed all sorts of delicious meals to go over the sand dune and watch the sun go down over the Timor Sea! And when it finally dips from view everyone on the beach applaudes the occasion!! Awesome
216,Must seethe markets,"Of course anyone visiting Darwin is keen to experience this much touted attraction. Our friends were no exception, but they were most disappointed with what was on offer, re the stall merchandise and the repetitive food that was available. They were blown away with the applause of the crowd when the sun set, as they did not believe it was that outstanding on that particular evening!"
217,Too many people for the designated area. ,"How good is this, a sundowner on the beach, people come from around the world to see this, and this was winter"
218,SUNSET you haven't seen this one!,Have the best street food. Found a travelling artist who paints while you watch. Amazing talent. The sunset was spectacular.
219,Rather bland,"Went for the sunset, stayed for the oysters and laksa! Super delicious. We went peak tourist season so there were people everywhere but didn‚Äôt have to wait long for anything. Sunset was as brilliant as promised. I did find it odd when people clapped the sun but otherwise a good experience."
220,Great place to see the sun set,"Enjoyed a beautiful sunset on the beach then walked into the market to get tea, finished off with walking the market"
221,Overrated,We went to Mindil Market and then watched the sunset. well worth the visit and the sunset was breathtaking.
222,Night Make,"We went to the Thursday night market and were amazed at not only the popularity of it, but at the variety of stalls providing crafts, etc.  There was also an amazing array of food stalls, providing anything you every wanted in cuisine.  Of course, the evening was 'topped off' when we joined the many thousands on the beach to watch the sunset - a truly amazing experience and one to be recommended highly."
223,Mindi beach Darwin,"Great food choices, lots of interesting market stalls and enjoy the most awesome sunset sitting on the beach."
224,Great evening market,covid had made this a different experience. Went from the market to the sailing club for a drink. Sunsets along her are really great.
225,Mindil markets ,The huge variation of food at great prices & the local band playing . We loved all the different souvenirs that were cheap & attractive & the atmosphere was fantastic !
226,Spectacular,Wide variety of foods mainly Asian As well as locally made wares suitable for gifts. BYO alcohol as none available for purchase
227,Mindil Beach Markets and Sunset a must,Mindil beach is so beautiful especially at sunset. There are lovely restaurants all around and some of them are overlooking the beach. IL Piatto is an Italian restaurant overlooking the sea. The food was amazing and the view incredible.
228,Nice beach,Always visit here. Really interesting market. Delicious food  and all different. The sunset is spectacular from the beach. very close to the Casino.
229,Territory day,"If you want to see the best sunset of your life it is here, great location to see it, long expansive beach behind the casino."
230,Beautiful sunset,One of those special Australian experiences is watching the sun set with other locals on mindil beach in the dry season.
231,Busy but fun ,"Just want to sit and watch the world go by then sitting and watching the sunset here is a must do, we had a great time"
232,Food feast & great sunset,"The sunset was beautiful.  The markets were very busy but lots of different things to look at.  The food was amazing, actually too manyChoices lol."
233,Markets and sunset,"We had never visited Darwin and arrived on a Sunday afternoon-what an amazing introduction to this wonderful place! Fantastic, delicious, inexpensive food from across Asia. Wonderful arts and crafts. Nice, fun people of all ages. Add one of the most beautiful sunsets I've seen and you have a ""must do"" experience. Not a lot of Americans come to ""the top end""-this area was a great surprise. Wish we stayed longer and want to come back!"
234,Sunsets & markets ,Best in darwin we went to all and these r the best and it shows its packed. Food selection amazing! Great stalls. Sunset amazing! Add it too ur list when in darwin its a must!!
235,Great beach,"I took a walk to the beach from my hotel. It was a very hot day and there was no shade on the beach so I couldn‚Äôt stay very long. The tide was also very far out, but probably best due to the jellyfish! Got some nice pictures of the beach."
236,Mindil Beach Markets,By far the best markets in Darwin and possibly the best markets I've ever been to. The sunset is always beautiful. The variety of food in incredible.
237,First time st Mindil Markets,Visited the marlets on Sunday afternoon East transport from Darwin city on the bus route no. 4. $3 for three hours.The markets were well set out with lots of variety to choose from. Prices reasonable. The food trucks offered a good variety to choose from. Prices reasonable
238,Best place for Sunset,"Came just before the sunset, plenty of car park space just near the beach. Watched the sunset and enjoyed the atmosphere. Do bring your own seats or beach towels to seat on the sand."
239,Night out,Wonderful place to see the sunset. Eat dinner and take a moment to reflect on our beautiful country. Mindil market is a bonus.
240,Great place to relax and take in the atmosphere,Mindil Beach is a place that i will always remember. The sunset is something I have never seen before. Night market is on Thursday and Sunday nights where you can grab your dinner and sit on the beach to watch the stunning sunset.
241,Always fabulous at sunset,We went on market night Thursday.It was the busiest place we went to in Darwin.Sooooooo  many food vans to choose from. There are also market stalls to visit.Recommend you get your food first and sit on the beach front to watch the sunset. The food area was super crazy busy after the sun went down.
242,Wonderful,"Although we came while they were doing renovations and painting, the deal and services provided were excellent. The Vue was a good place to eat and rhe food was plentiful.Highly recommended once they finished the renovations."
243,Awesome sunset,"if you can go when the market is open, grab yourselve some great food from one of the food trucks , and settle yourself down to watch the sunset.Well worth it."
244,Divine sunsets and great market,Sitting on the beach with a cold drink in hand among hundreds of other people doesn‚Äôt sound very calming. however it is. Everyone is quiet and contemplative and focussed on time passing through the different stages of sunset. The drummer and didgeridoo player stopped while the sunset and it was quite awesome. There are many different food vans to buy yourself something to eat.
245,Beautiful sunset and markets.,"Great views of sunset over the water. Easy bus ride or cycle from the city. From May to October on Thursday and Sunday from 4pm to 9pm the markets are here. Great for food, clothing, souvenirs, free live entertainment. Darwin food scene is a multi culture experience in itself - Indonesian, Malay, Greek, Japanese to name a few. The locals and tourist very friendly. Plenty of parking and Ubers."
246,Nice beach a bit of a walk away from the city,Must See. A great market on Thursday's and Sunday's. Mother nature sure turns on the charm with the sunsets on the beach
247,Beautiful location,"We wandered down to have dinner, watch the sunset and check out the store holders.The walk from our hotel The Cav was only about half an hour and as the sun was going to set soon it wasn‚Äôt even hot and was a comfortable walk.We ate some delicious Thai treats for dinner from a lovely hawker stall and it was the perfect street food.Once we ate we walked 30 metres to the warm sand to view the setting sun and what a view it was. It was bright, stunning and so lovely to watch.We then wandered around the market stalls and had a wonderful time doing so.I would recommend a trip to the beach and markets if you are in Darwin as that view is sensational."
248,Sunset ,Enjoyed the Sunday sunset markets at Mindil Beach and finished the evening watching the sun set over the Arafura Sea...just stunning!  Lots of different cuisines on offer and a few varied stalls...mainly clothing. The sunsets are a definite must-do any night of the week!
249,Beach Markets,"Just go..but dont forget to stay for the sky change when the sun is below the horizon..Any day anytime this beach is great, plenty of rock pools, walking area and miles of beach sand. Clean public amenties and nice lawns dotted with palm trees. A quick walk fron the botanical gardens."
250,Great Atmosphere,This is a really gorgeous place to watch the sunrise or sunset. There were people everywhere and the atmosphere was quite lovely.
251,Always a good Sunset,"As a Darwin local, came here every year for about 20 years. Now that I live away, I still crave the avocado smoothies, fresh coconut juice, spring rolls and oysters. Definitely a must-do for foodies... great atmosphere and sunset. Perfect for families, teens or solo-travellers, everyone welcome!"
252,"Nice sunset, brilliant atmosphere ",Beach markets open Thursday and Sunday evenings. Best local foods with heaps of choices. Try the freshly shucked oysters at the oyster van they are to die for. Lots of smaller stalls with tourist souvenirs and local handcraft. Well worth the visit.
253,Nice evening out,To all of my fellow sun set viewers please put some RID or other decent repellant on before standing or sitting on the beach at sun set. Otherwise you to will be among the hapless tourists in the chemist the next morning looking for something to stop the itch. The council could put up some signs but they don't.
254,Sunset delight,Great markets to attend   Lots to see. Lots of food to choose from. Much entertainment. A beautiful sunset to watch whilst sitting on the beach.
255,Yummy Mindil Markets Thursday,"Awesome place to go for the sunset (its quick!). My tip is to head to the beach first, watch the sun go down then head into the markets for food and stalls selling interesting things"
256,Mobile markets,"Stunning location, amazing infinity pool. Food excellent and Sangria was fabulous. Very laid back atmosphere"

260,Great market,Bring chairs if you want to set up on the beach to watch the sunset and get a good spot. It gets really crowded so worth going early. There‚Äôs often busking/shows as well which are worth watching for tourists :)
261,Amazing Sunset ,"We had heard so much about about this beach so decided to check it out. We parked for free in the Casino parking lot then went down. Tide was out so we did a bit of beach combing, picking up sea glass as we found it. Some locals with their dogs on the beach. Toilets and spot to wash feet available off the beach."
262,It‚Äôs a beach,"There were almost too many food trucks to choose from. Our family of 4 took sooo long to decide who wanted what, yet it was an absolutely fantastic problem to have. Not only were the food trucks amazing, the local merchants with their products were also a lot of fun to talk with and make purchases from. Highly recommend a visit to the Mindil Beach Markets on Thursday and Sundays."
263,Memory makers,"Great spot to watch the sunset!There were literally thousands of people on the beach watching the sunset, and behind the sand dunes were dozens and dozens of food stalls selling everything you can think of; Japanese, Thai, Indian, Kebabs, Fish and Chips, Italian....you name it.Great atmosphere and a must see on your stay in Darwin."
264,Sunset Scenery,Nice place to sit on the sand to watch the last rays of sun. Recommend to bring your own picnic or buy food at the market.
265,Stunning place to watch for the Sun‚Äôs green flash,"Probably best place to enjoy sunset. Night markets attract many people. Affordable food and souvenirs are available in abundance. Closes 9pm.Interesting fact, there hundreds of crocodiles inhabiting this area. Don‚Äôt go into water... alone"
266,Nice,Back again to visit one of my favourite places.  Great music and entertainment plus all the amazing stalls and dare I say it some of the best food in Darwin.Love it every time We come here.  Just chilling teying the food and waiting for tge sunset.  Might ve a little cloudy for a great one but any sunset is worth it .  Come see you will love it
267,Markets of food,Beautiful sunset great market very organised for parking. More of an international food cuisine market which is fantastic still there are lots there to buy jewellery whips dresses bags listen to the local music. Although people flock to the beach for the sunset there‚Äôs enough room for everyone and that‚Äôs worth another picture we went at 3.30 to have a look before it got busy.
268,Sunsets,"It was a great experience. Right on the beach, sat in back of 4wd's and beach chairs to watch the sunset and have a beer & wine with friends. A highlight of our time in Darwin."
269,Great night market,"This is a beautiful eating area, and we sat down and watched the sunset go down in all colours it was truely lovely.  The Casino also is there very small but the most gorgeous Pool Bar. The Markets all over Darwin are amazing."
270,Very busy,A great spot to watch the sun go down over the ocean. Pack a picnic and enjoy with the crowds. Lovely
271,Perfect place for sunset and spicy papaya salad.,"We went to the beach sunset and the market on one of the final evenings of the season.  Make sure you schedule you trip to Darwin to include this fun event.  Music, food, crafts, and more!"
272,Food Trucks Galore at Mindil Beach Market,"Beautiful sunset fantastic food great market. Atmosphere was great,food variety in different cultures amazing"
273,Must visit!!!,A not to be missed Darwin experience. Savour top end delights as you watch the sunset over the ocean.Take chairs or a blanket and soak up the atmosphere.
274,Casual ,Mindil Beach is a must see location in Darwin. It is best if you can get there on Thursday or Sunday evening when the markets are on. There are heaps of taxis during the markets to get you back to town so you don't need to worry about getting stuck there. The sunset is spectacular.
275,Really nice evening out,"Great spot to catch the sunset ! Cool people hung out celebrating bdays , anniversaries , couples just having a nice romantic moment , families creating memories ! There‚Äôs this amazing food market happening every Sunday with the most amazing vibe ! It‚Äôs really worth the visit give it a go !"
276,Mindless Market and sunset,Beautiful beach to watch the sunset. Parap sunset market is held here every Thursday and Sunday so it'll be very busy at the beach area near to the market. Lots to see and buy in the market. Huge variety of food stalls.
277,Must do,You can find every kind of food you would like to and you can eat while you listen a free concert or watch a beautiful sunset. This market is a good opportunity to taste new flavour and meet locals people.
278,Very special place ,"Great variety of foods, took me ages to decide. Purchased a couple of arty top end pieces, reasonably priced. There was enjoyable live entertainment. Then the highlight was the sunset on the beach. I took some wonderful photos but you have to go right down the beach as there are a lot of people doing the same"
279,It‚Äôs ok ,"Grab a bottle of Red and some street food from the plethora of international vendors, and enjoy a stunning sunset on the beach.Perfect."
280,Nice sunset,We visited the Mindil Beach Market and sat down at the beach to watch the sun going down. It was so so nice. Afterwards we grabbed something to eat from one of the food options at the market. Very tasteful and hard to decide what to eat. We loved it!
281,"Street food,",What a great place to view the beautiful Darwin sunset!The colours were stunning and we were amazed by the number of people who turn up to view this amazing sight!
282,Very zen,"We were there in the evening for the sunset, when the Mindil market was on on Sunday. The tide was low and the beach was just amazing, we did not swim- but dipped our legs and soaked into the atmosphere. The sun set here is just amazing. A must do, if you are in Darwin."
283,Mindel beach night market,"Great to visit at any time of the year, an easy walk from the centre of the city, it's bustling when the markets are on."
284,Market needs refreshing,It hard to say what atracts you to a beach. For it will always be the sea an not that strip of sand. At home I live near the beach  yet it is the sea and its sound I miss most when I am gone. This beach is fine but its the sea that makes a beach.
285,Amazing markets and beautiful sunsets.!,"Gotta do it. Lots of people but so glad we went. Culture, relaxed, beautiful. We went to the markets on Sunday night, had some food and then watched the sunset with a billion others. Great night"
286,Sunset over the sea,We went to the markets and bought tea to eat while we watched the sunset from the beach. There was an amazing range of food choices. Servings are big and are reasonably priced. There are  other stalls that sell a wide range of goods.
287,Revisit,This place has the most amazing sunsets I have ever seen . It's a must visit if you ever in Darwin australia..there is an artisan market also good stalls o Friday night's which are worth a visit. Potato see and do while there
288,Mindel markets,We went here to see the sunset it was truly amazing lots of people sat on the beach and waited for it and it was well worth waiting for .
289,Foodies heaven,We walked onto the beach with our dogs at about 4.30pm. The sand was clean. The beach was almost empty. There were lifesavers but they were not busy. The surf was up. Not quite Sydney standards though. Maybe 15cm waves. The water was very warm. The view extends to the horizon so it is a lovely spot to watch the sun set into the sea.
290,Great for sunset,"Most amazing sunsets over the water.  We stayed at the resort and watched them every night, each one was stunning I could never get tired of it.  Unless it was Market night. The market is mental, unbelievably busy.  It does have some cool local stuff."
291,Pleasant atmosphere ,Great place to visit the mangoes are the best. Loved trying lots of things. Chicken satay  quinoa salad yummy frui salad so sweet.
292,Very busy,Had dinner Friday night. Listened to music and wandered around. Looked at art and craft. Beautiful sunset On the beach.
293,Beach is nice but there are just as good locations to catch a sunset,"We wandered through the markets, sampling some delicious foods- octopus, crocodile, Sri Lankan curries, oysters. Spoilt for choice. then sat on the beach and watched the glorious sunset"
294,The place for sunsets.,Not really much to say. Fantastic sunset. Sit on the beach or the grass. Maybe bring something to eat or drink. Easy free car parking. Pictures say it all...üëåüëç
295,Fantastic ,Loved the sunset. Very spectacular. Grabbed some Thai and just sat with my wife and watched it fade into the sea
296,Mindel Sunset Markets,"We're so glad we arranged to catch up with a friend here while we were traveling around Australia.I'd actually never heard of this market, but was I surprised.So much to see, do and eat!We really enjoyed watching the sunset here and the stall holder's were so welcoming and happy.If you haven't been here yet, put it on your list of things to do, you won't regret it."
297,Sunset viewing are fantastic here,well what can i say ... the sunset... go and see it for  yourself... as for the markets ... love love love .... found some great deals... and is a foodie feast .... what to eat .... so much to choose from
298,Don‚Äôt forget a towel & snacks!,"Head out over the dunes, pull up a rug, grab some nibbles & relax! The kids run around, have a ball building sand castles, the sand is very sticky (baby powder helps to dry you feet and get it off rather than washing).. the tide can get very high but a beautiful spot to visit time and time again!"
299,Night Markets are okay.,The sunsets are amazing and well worth the visit.  Make sure you hang around that little bit longer to see the afterglow. Markets nearby operate Thursday and Sunday evening through the dry season
