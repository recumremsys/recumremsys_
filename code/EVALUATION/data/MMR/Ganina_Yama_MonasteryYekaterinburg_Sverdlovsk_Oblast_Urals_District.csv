0,story of sadness,this is one of the reason I travelled to this area. whole the family of Nikolai the 2 were berried in this place on 1918
1,one of Russia's youngest monasteries,"1 of the main reason for visiting Yekaterinburg was to visit this site and for a bit of a Pilgrimage of the Romanov history. It certainly is a beautiful setting for this collection of Monasteries, but such a horrible way for a Royal family to be assassinated and their bodies just disposed of. It does seem like a bit of a theme park because of how new all of the buildings are. It was lightly snowing the day we visited, and they still had barricades around the site of the old mineshaft where the dismembered bodies were thrown down. Take your time to slowly wander through this site and remember the significance of why this place exists. Visit the museum in the basement of 1 of the buildings. Do your research before visiting here and you will certainly feel the significance of this site."
2,Sacrifice place,"This is very significant monastery in Russian history. This k I land accept remains last Russian King, his wife and children. It is very important place for Russian people."
3,A striking Russian Orthodox Church,"Very cold day we went  to see the site and it was very astonishing to just imagine ..we like the place we took photos and I am glad I visited the site ,we even went inside one of the Xrams to burn a candle .I recommend to visit the place ,its a MUST."
4,Romanov site,"I really could not imagine, how important it is nowadays in Russia to honor the memory of Romanov family. Hundredthousand people coming on the day they died to see the places where they were killed and hidden afterwards. But, yes, even I had strong feelings there.Absolutely a place to go this monastery area out of city."
5,One for the history buffs!,This is an interesting visiting especially if you are into the history of Russian Tsarist period.  But generally sad to see how a family were butchered like this.
6,Fascinating and beautiful,"Nice sad plase, where was killed last king of Russia.  Here many forests, flowers , homes in  russian style, in which all day and nigth pray by souls family Romanov"
7,Story of Nicholas II,"We visited this set of churches in a pretty park with Konstantin from Ekaterinburg Guide Centre. He really brought it to life with his extensive knowledge of the history of the events surrounding their terrible end. The story is so moving so unless you speak Russian, it is best to come here with a guide or else you will have no idea of what is what."
8,Interesting place for a cultural visit,Just outsude of town this recently built monastery/memorial to the holy last tsar family was built in the beginning of 2000 in the old russian way of not using any nails. There are quite a few churches on the grounds but only one was opened to visitors as we were there.
9,Amazing experience!,This place was beautiful and very peaceful set in the forest. The churches were amazing but the reason for it's existence invites debate. Where the Royal family's bodies disposed of here or another place near by? It is interesting that an ideology that does not support aristocracy has allowed this place to be built to remember the Royal family.
10,Easy to come for a morning day out,A visit to Yekaterinburg can not be considered as completed if this place not visited whether you like Monarchy or not.At the day of visit some chapels where lucked. The chapels are small but impressive inside. Men should step in with bare head but ladies shall cover hair. What you sense from the wooden churches in Siberia and Ural is a nice mixed smell of incense and wood and pleasant warmth in contrast to the outside which almost uniform cold white in winter.Comprehensive information can be found on many website.
11,A very significant site,"It is amazing how they could find the place where the Tsar family was buried. The monastery itself is amazing, full of peace and completely surrounded by nature. One of the most interesting places I have visited in Russia."
12,"Sentimental, emotional site","Beautiful simple chapels in peaceful forest, in November snow. Excellent museum. Very respectful exhibits and memorials. Educational on the tragic history."
13,A MUST!!,"Our guide Ekaterina and driver Alex took us here today.  Very informed guide with great English.  The buildings are stunning and evoke Russian nostalgia.Whether the Romanov family ended up here or not, the story is certainly a key part of Russian history and folklore.Well worth a visit, women must wear a skirt and headscarf, (provided).  Thankyou Ekaterinburg Guide Center!"
14,Beautiful and informative.,Been here before and it looks like it increase in size with churches for each of the Tsar family members. A place to visist if you are in Yekaterinburg
15,Great visit,Part of the story of the family. Part of the story of Russia. This place is charming and exploitive all in one action. There are beautiful chapels but still there the pits. Women have to wear skirts below their knees and head covering because it is a monastery. Glad went. But wouldn't do it a second time.
16,Must visit,"You'll get a feeling of how emotional this place is. It is hard to swallow that Tsar Nicholas II and his entire family was shot and dumped and buried under a road. Why such a horrific act and not just keep them under house arrest? How cruel of the old regime.I feel so sad for the Tsar and great respect this place which was built in their memory. At last after a century, they are dignified.You must visit this place to feel the emotion. It is a must visit if you take the Great trans Siberian Railyway."
17,A must for those interested in Russian History,"Im not very religion person, but this place is more than churches (not for everybody). It has interesting history, it is very nice and quiet place."
18,A must see near Ekaterinburg,"I would definitely recommend visiting this monastery if you are in Ekaterinburg. We visited with tour guide Olga from the Ekaterinburg Guide Centre.  Olga was very knowledgeable and a good story teller. She told us about the discovery of the bodies of the Tsars family and how they were killed. It was very moving but the beauty of the monastery and the peaceful setting made our trip interesting, rather than depressing.  The wooden buildings have been lovingly crafted. It was quiet when we visited so we were able to absorb the atmosphere appropriately. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Russia."
19,Tranquil and historic,With it 7 churches each dedicate to a member of the Romanov family this monastery built on the site of the mine where the bodies of the Romanov family were hidden is quite magnificent.   The atmosphere does much to express the feeling of the monks who have made this place a memorial to the murdered Czar and his family.  It is a quiet and respectful place and well worth a visit.
20,Part of History,"Not far from the city, this set of 7 wooden churches is a place you should not miss. Best in summer."
21,A bit of a non-event,"After visiting the ‘show pony’ that is Church On The Blood we were unfortunately taken here as part of our tour. Now, for the nay-sayers who might be reading this review and shaking their heads in disbelief, yes, I consider myself religious and yes, I have travelled fairly extensively. The Monastery, as you obviously know, is located on the site (supposedly, although that is a story for Yeltsin and the church to discuss) where the Romanov family bodies were dumped after their murder in Yekaterinburg. Unfortunately, as with The Church on the Blood, there doesn’t seem to have been any thought it maintaining any dignity behind the churches here. It does seem to have been ‘Disneyfied’ as we all agreed (and, interestingly, several others who have reviewed the site) and the churches seem almost artificial on the site, almost like attractions rather than a place of dignified contemplation and reflection. There is a decent museum in the main chapel, although of course the iconic souvenir shop is in the chapel as well."
22,Important from historical perspective,"A beautiful place recreated from the style of yesterday. I find it strange that the family are now all saints, seems an anathema. However that does not detract from the beauty of the place."
23,Impressive and heartbreaking,"About 20 km. away from Yekaterinburg, quite new and relatively peaceful place within the forest. From the one hand - this is a spiritual, kind-of holy place consisting of a group of Russian monastyrs (temples) which are sacrificed to Romanov Family, from the other - there isn't much historical or architectonical value (of course there is a positive feelings being inside the temples, but for me, it doesn't have much in common with an real Orthodox Religion, but is more attracted to tourism and new wave of religion present in Russian politics in our period of time)."
24,Nice!,"The monastery offers great insight into Russian orthodoxy and the history of the Romanovs. The architecture there is amazing and well worth the visit for that alone. As impressive as the churches are, the museum about the life of Nicholas II and his abdication is the standout part of the tour. It is very informative and easy to follow, although non-Russian speakers should book a tour guide."
25,Tacky & Terrible,Unique architecture and recent history of the place makes it special. The churches inside are beautiful and the priests very helpful to even non Christians not so familiar with the customs and procedures. Ladies need to wear a wrap and have their heads covered.
26,One of the most interesting places you will ever visit,This is a very peaceful and tranquil place to visit and very poigninat when one remembers what took place here. Wall boards explain to the visitor the story and background history. I am not completely sure of the sainthoods granted to the last Tsar and his family but i have no doubt that they were good people who were caught up and swept away in unalterable and tragic circumstances. It is a sobering place to visit.
27,Nice park with many churches all very recent,"A lot of people have gone to a lot of trouble to create this tourist park. I tend to back brief places to think about the design process. This looks and feels like a tourist centre driven by a committee and with poor curation + they had a friend who was a builder who skimped on the architect. Other countries would follow ICOMOS principles and tried to create something with authenticity. Half of our group went on a sit down strike as we just didn't like the fakeness. We were not a bus load of redneck Americans and we expected more when travelling across the world. Also some of the feminist women objected to having to scarf up while the men walked in sandals and shorts. if you get caught in a group , Just go the the photo exhibition . It is quite good."
28,"Spiritual Disneyland, didn't work for me","This place is notorious for being the burial site for the Royal family bodies.  In the 19th century a guy called Ganya tried to establish a mining business here. He went no further than digging several pits, as he went bankrupt. But this place was named after him - Ganina Yama, which means ""Pit by Ganya"". When the Bolsheviks were looking a secret place to bury the bodies in July 1918 relatively close to the city,  this place  seemed ideal for them.  Now it is a monastery with the number of church equal to the number of the Royal family members buried here.I got to the monatery on Sunday morning by uber.  There is a city bus, but I couldn't find it where it was supposed to be.  The uber ride one way cost me 220 rubles.  It was minus 36 C.  I attended the Sunday service, then I had breakfast in the church refectory.  The food is good there.  The place is so serene and quiet, that it seems sinister.I got a free ride back to the city by chance.  I was asking the lady in the church shop about the bus, when one of the customer just offered a free ride.  A real Urals hospitality!!!"
29,Unusual tribute ......,"This was one place on my Trans-Siberian voyage that I will never forget! A beautiful, somber and historic place."
30,Intersting place,"This huge complex is dedicated to the memory of the Romanovs. The entire family was shot in a house in Ekaterinburg, and their bodies were brought here for disposal. All family members are considered saints by the Russian Orthodox Church.  There are many churches, including one for each family member, and a museum.  If you don't speak Russian, you definitely need a guide to show you around.  In fact, I would recommend a guide even if you DID speak fluent Russian!  As we were on a group tour we had an excellent local guide, who explained everything to us. There are several buildings, and it would take about three hours to see everything properly.  This place is an absolute must for history buffs!  Also for photo buffs!  The whole place is very very photogenic.  If you are not particularly religious, the heavy emphasis on religion might put you off, but I would still urge you to take the trouble to see this complex.  Very easy to negotiate in a wheel chair or stroller, wide paths between buildings.  One small tip for women: if you are wearing pants (as many in our group were!), you will need to borrow a sort of sarong-like garment, which you wrap around.  A bit undignified, so I would suggest that ladies wear long skirts while visiting this place!!  Another suggestion: history buffs ought to read up about this place before coming here."
31,Pretty spot with a history ,"Although I have my doubts about the saintliness of the Romanovs, this is a wonderful place to visit, especially in the winter. Each of the chapels is built in a different style and there is none of the gross commercialism too often found at such sites."
32,Rainy day visit,Expecting a place that pays deep respect to the events that happened. We were disappointed by cheaply and newly built wooden churches. The spiritual element is not really there as it seems like it was just built a couple of years ago with little care to detail.The outside bathrooms are an experience... Try to avoid them if you can!
33,Spent the Sunday morning here,"The monastery/churches are located in middle of a tall pine wood. The place is unbelievably beautiful, specially if it is rainy (despite its inconveniences). But it is not a common touristic place to go. Go if you feel you are spiritually motivated to do it. It is a place of reflexion, on what happened there, on the way the royal family was murdered, on the changes it brought to the country, etc. It is also out of this world if you happen to arrive at the time of one service, in some of the little churches. The chants, the smell of what they burn, is deeply moving."
34,Ok for church lovers,"The site consists of churches built in memory of the Romanov family, nothing more that I could see. I could not find any information in English and it seems that the site is of religious significance for some but I am not sure that it offers much for tourists. It would have been great to have some signs in different languages. Nevertheless the churches are pretty and it is not too far out of the city. We took an Uber out to Ganina Yama but could not find one to take us back. We had to call the hotel to order a regular cab to come out and collect us."
35,Invites debate,"Ganina Yama was a must do as part of my personal pilgrimage to visit sites relating to the end of the Romanov Dynasty and the beginnings of Soviet Russia. The mine is the site where the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, his family and a couple of servants were dumped after their murder in a cellar in Yekaterinburg,and an attempt to destroy them with acid and by burning. After the fall of the Soviet Union a monastery has been built on the site using traditional building techniques. A lovely peaceful place with a dark history. Especially moving is the grove surrounding the entrance to the mine shaft, filled with beautiful white lilies and a commemorative walk lined with photos of the Romanov Martyrs"
36,Nice quick visit,"Very spiritual place set in woodlands about 20k from Yekaterinburg. Seven monasteries, all different in design commemorating the demise of the Romanov family. Well worth a visit."
37,Visually stunning!,"As one part of the history claims, here is where the bodies of the Romanov were buried. So it is a good historical place. You can easily get here using an app like uber. To go out you may hitchhike as there is a big road just within a walking distance. No signal. And free of charges. The bad part is that they are still building some cathedrals so you are not able to see everything"
38,A serene place to be,"Monastery built in the 1990s over the place where Romanovs’ bodies were dumped after their murder.  Remains are now in St. Petersburg.  Peaceful grounds, monastery and memorial at their first gravesite."
39,Interesting but Weird,I've read several different historical articles about this place and my expectations were quite different from how it actually was when I went there.There are brand new wooden churches and a whacky new restaurant..Oh and don't forget to visit the outside washroom before you leave.. You'll be surprised..
40,Short trip to a must see site,"This is a very significant site in Russian history and is certainly worth a visit for that reason. According to the “official” version of history, this is where the bodies of the Romanovs were brought and thrown down a disused mineshaft. A more recent version claims that their bodies were burnt here but were then taken elsewhere for burial (see the Memorialto Romanovy in TripAdvisor). Anyway, this site is very significant and you will see many people coming here to pay homage to the Romanovs and to the various icons that are here. The actual monastery looks a bit like a theme park which is unfortunate in my view. If you are interested in the Romanovs and their demise, this is a must see location. Women must wear a headscarf and skirt. Men must not wear shorts (or they will have to put a skirt on to cover their legs.)"
41,Nice place,This place is overrated. It's a sami large complex of buildings. Most of them were closed when we visited the place. It's far from the city so you have to take an excursion or a taxi. Excursion was 650 RUB per person and taxi was 1500. The only difference is that with taxi you pay 100 RUB to the guide at the spot. You can get your excursion or cab from the parking in front of Vokzal.
42,"Very Interesting place and must to visit place ,",A nice museum village with a monastery. A good museum but only in Russian. Better go the the Yeltsin museum. You have to dress properly to get inside and I think it's not very interesting without a guide.
43,Following tragic history of Tsar Nicholas and his family,Great setting.People are not too friendly.Interesting Cathedrals and setting.Yummie cafe of home-made kvas and all tasty pirozhki and salads.Great tea.One issue - toilets are not great.
44,Very saint place,"Friends took us from The Church on the Blood (the site where the royal family were murdered) into the forest where the thugs had tried to dispose of the bodies, by burning, acid and burial.There were seven new churches there ,one for each member of the royal family. The whole was surrounded by a stockade on which could be found photos of the family. The likeness of the Czar to the Duke of Kent was remarkable, so much so that at the canonisation of the family people thought the Duke was the Czar reincarnated. Beautiful Russian Orthodox choral music pervaded the area making a truly magical effect, something never to be forgotten"
45,A complete morning visit,"The first place the Bolsheviks threw the bodies of the Romanovs, down a mind shaft. I was there a week and 100 years after the murders. The Rimanivs grow in stature every year."
46,Overrated ,"This place is outside the city and a little inconvenient to get to. But, I thought it was worth the visit."
47,Seven chapels in a forest,Our guide was Maryana - she speaks excellent English. Our driver took us out to Ganina Yama where we spent time at the holy sites. We weren’t rushed and Maryana gave us lots of details as we walked around the grounds. Back to Yekaterinburg and the Church of the Blood and the nearby Romanov Museum. Tour is well worth doing- we got such an insight into the history of these places thanks to our knowledgeable guide.
48,A bit of religious disneyland.,If you a wearing shorts you have to put a kind of dress that you entwine around your waist and women must have also a scarf. After killing the Romanov family and their servants the bodies were taken here and thrown into a pit. At the area there are seven chapels all made of log. There is also a monastery and the monks take care of the place.
49,A lesson of history,"I Think Tsar Nicholas II and his family would have approved this very calm but beautiful memorial to remember their terrible murders and  their bodies first being thrown down a mine shaft here, in haste.   Since then the 7 churches for each family member have been built in the woods and a monastery established.  Each church us a little different and the bronze busts of the family are exquisite, especially the one of Tsarina Alexandra, Queen Victoria's granddaughter.  Long skirts and head scarves are provided for female visitors, photography permitted outside but not in any building.Quaint cafe serving coffee, tea and local delicacies.Recommend."
50,Not far good museum,Definitely worth the trip to visit the site where the last Tsar´s family was buried. I saw it in the Winter and it was impressive.
51,Worth the trip when in Yekaterinburg ,"Great place to attend and do a few hours.  It will take approx. 25-30 minutes from the train station.  Uber Taxi is about 180 rubles.  I only spent about 20 minutes or so here.  I'm quick on seeing things as a ""did it, saw it, will read up on it later"" as I negotiated the Uber wait and paid him rubles for wait and return trip."
52,nice sad place in forest,Very sobering to see the first place the Romanov bodies were dumped. Surrealness surroumds it. A must for any Romanov follower.
53,Great excursion,A very interesting site rather well maintained. It is always nice to experience and learn about historical events that way. The churches are worth the detour. The female visitors should remember to come covered.
54,Another not-to-miss,A must see for history buffs and for those who want to respect the memory of the Romanovs. This place is a little tricky to get to independently (I got an Uber/Yandex there and hitch-hiked back) but is well worth the effort. There is a canteen there that sells delicious food too.Some people complain this place is tacky or some sort of spiritual theme-park. I certainly did not get this impression.
55,Suprising,"If you have an interest in history and in particular the end of the 300 year Romanov dynasty then this will certainly be of interest.Ganina Yama is the site where the Tsar Nicholas II, his wife and 5 children's bodies were brought to be burned, buried, basically hidden from sympathisers. It is about 30km to the north of Ekaterinburg.It is all relatively new. When the Communist regime finished in 1992 there was nothing here. Now the Orthodox Church has built a monastery and enshrined it as a respectful, beautiful place in memory of the Tsar and his family.Tips - you can get a tour from Ekaterinburg that will cost about 600 roubles (not extortionate) BUT you can catch the Metro to машиностроителей station (it is the 3rd to last heading north on the green line) for the cost of 43 Roubles each (about 50p). If you turn left out of the Metro you will see a bus station (where buses turn round so it is not that small but it is very basic). The buses run about every 2 hours (there is one at about 11:23). You need bus number 223 and it costs 82 Roubles (approximately £1). There is a timetable posted on the window of the small enquiry office at the bus station or you could Google it for different times. Roughly an interesting hour later you will arrive at Ganina Yama, entrance to the monastery is free. My partner and I spent 2 hours there as it is not a huge place. We caught the return bus at 14:48, check the timetable as you alight the bus!Overall this is a beautiful and serene location that has a mark in history. I recommend seeing it as follow up to Church of the Spilt Blood (the church that has been built on the site of Ipatiev House where the Bolsheviks actually murdered Tsar Nicholas II and his family). Enjoy!"
56,Beautifully maintained monastery in a countryside setting.,"The story surrounding this site is terrifying, but the site is beautiful. The churches are placed within the woods and blend beautifully. The pictures on the surrounding wall gives insight to the lives of the Romanov family. Women are expected to cover their heads and wear appropriate length skirts - these are provided free of charge."
57,"A nice, peaceful complex to stroll around.",Came here with a friend by taxi.  The buildings were peaceful and it was a nice setting.  There was an excellent display of family photos from the first part of the twentieth century.  It was a sombre experience as I came with a Russian friend who did not want to come here on her birthday.   There was nothing in English which for me was not a problem.  Execution or murder the end result was the same - children dead before they had a chance to experience life.
58,Peaceful,"We felt we had to go whilst we were in Yekaterinburg, and we're happy that we went. However, be aware that this is a working monastery and not a tourist attraction! It is obviously a very holy place for Russian Orthodox Christians and we felt out of place walking around taking pictures. It is an interesting place in a very pretty setting, but we don't feel like we need to go back. P.S. Make sure to go to the toilet before you come visit - the previous comments tell no lies!"
59,Mixed feelings,Magnificent setting among forest and parkland vegetation. Buildings exemplify  the exquisite timber craftsmanship seen also in other parts of Siberia. Churches are quite magnificent. Afternoon tea yummy and very Russian with cottage cheese cake. Excellent commentary by Guide Mariana.
60,Wonderful place,"Took the local train out from Yekaterinburg to the station nearest the monastery, about 3 kilometers away. There are buses that run from the station, but we ended up walking after a helpful local pointed out the direction (there are no signs). Takes around two hours or so to go in to the different churches and cathedrals (there are about 7 in the monastery complex). There are few signs and none in English, so you should have a good sense of the history of the site before going. Overall, a very peaceful place in the middle of the woods, which contrasts with its gruesome history. There is a cafe and small store that sells food (soups, pies, salads) and souvenirs.There are several tours and tour guides that arrange transport to and from the monastery, which I would recommend if you don't speak Russian. We caught the local bus back from the monastery grounds to Yekaterinburg's city center, but had to wait for about an hour and a half for it to show up."
61,Didn't expect disneyland,"The reading place of the Romanov, who seem much more popular a century after their murder then my recollection from school. Anyways there gardens are very nice and the various churches interesting to visit. Our guide had a lot of things to say about each object, but send to have read history from a different book then mine 🤔."
62,Tips for English speakers.....,"Yes, the forest is beautiful. But that is. The churches are just churches and have a similar style, so nothing special. People mention a wall with photos and history but I couldn't find it. Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy the visit, although I was really interested in what had happened there. I wouldn't recommend to go there unless you are a religious person."
63,Honouring the last Czar of Russia,"After the women in our tour group put on maroon skirts, we wandered through the rainy, serene monastery honoring the place where the Romanovs' bodies were thrown into a mine shaft, now considered holy ground-- although Romanov descendants doubt the DNA evidence. It is an interesting place, with monks moving quietly along the paths. Beware the bathrooms."
64,Worth the trip if you have interest in Imperial family,Visiting this place was sobering but also very interesting I was struck by how quiet it was and peaceful despite what had taken place there
65,"beautiful, thoughtful, worthwhile","Went out here on a Sunday so there were a lot of people there.  We found a web site called bears with bailalaikas that gave us the bus times to get there.  But when I asked our hotel receptionist about the bus she looked askance and suggested a taxi.  Since it was only 225 roubles we said fine. Weather not very good but the chapels were pretty, there were plenty of toilets and a rather basic cafe. They were having a service in one of the chapels but everyone was milling around and we went in and listened to the chanting/singing.  The photos of the royal family were down in the underneath of the main chapel.  Not having a Russian sim in my phone we asked the hotel receptionist to get a taxi to pick us up two hours later.  The taxi was about 30 minutes late and we thought we were going to need to take the bus back.  But it might have been that the receptionist was using Uber and they didn't have a taxi sign on them.  So you don't know who the taxi is.  Maybe tell the receptionist to tell the Uber driver how to recognize you."
66,"Emotive, tragic but quite splendid",I Came here by taxi. The buildings were peaceful and it was a nice setting.There was nothing in English which for me was a problem.great experience
67,Commercialization of the Romanovs,Located on a lovely wooded area 16km north-east of Yekaterinburg.A very woody and serene area if you want to enjoy a quite and peaceful day out.
68,Interesting,"Built to honour the Romanoff family, the murdered Tsar and Tsarina of Russia and their family. It is widely believed that the military ordered and carried out this murder without the knowledge of the Bolshevik Government who had not wanted the crime of regicicde to be laid at their door. The purpose of the murder was to discredit the revolutionary government and thus make it easier to facilitate a military takeover of government. The family have since been  created 'Saints' by the Russian Orthodox Church."
69,"Strange, solitary monastery honoring the slain Romanovs","It was not too complicated to get there. We took a local train from Yekaterinburg to Shuvakish. We afterwards walked for 45 minutes in the forest next to the road, to get to the monastery. Since the weather was nice it was nice and good to get away from the exhaust fumes. The place itself is very beautiful and a beautiful tribute to the murdered family. Just outside the monastery there is a small shop to get snacks and drinks. We waited for the bus, which should pass there 6 times in the day and had nice locals that explained us the way back. Of course it would have been possible to take the train back but we would have had to wait 2 hours. I think it's just one of these places you have to visit when you around the region. Unfortunately, no explanation in English."
70,A bunch of new wooden churches - not inspiring,"The place where after they were murdered, the last czar & his family were dumped here and where their bones would be found later. There is a monument on top if this spot. Order a taxi through Gett or Maxim and its about a 500 ruble roundtrip adventure. The monestary is very clean & up to date. They have a little cafeteria with simple food if you are hungry but no decent toilets - so go before you come here. Its about 30 min each way outside of the city. Ladies: as usual in a Russian religious are you need to have your knees covered & a scarf - otherwise you'll have to borrow what they have. Eh."
71,Sombre but very interesting and very beautiful.,"A truly beautiful and serene yet very sad place. You can travel there quite cheaply on a local bus.Even if you are not religious, you cannot help but be moved by a visit there.Ladies, wear a dress or skirt and take a scarf or similar headcover, otherwise you have to don one of their skirts and head scarves."
72,Only for praying,"Place of historical importance, relaxing way to pass an afternoon. Walk amid the little wooden churches, breath some fresh air, learn about the zar and his family with some guide."
73,Unique Place,"If you do make a trip out to here, you will see some beautiful countryside, particularly where the monastery is situated. Very modern buildings, spotlessly clean. A serene place to take stock and if you have a guide, get some appropriate local history. This complex is dedicated to the Romanov family."
74,Churches in organic setting,"You must visit this complex if you are in Ekaterinburg. Don't mind the half an hour distance, it is well worth it.Tip: Arrange or book your return taxi upfront as there is no internet over there. I asked a favor from the owner of the cafe outside to call a cab for us"
75,Visit to this stunning place,"I wish I'd seen this site 10 or 15 years ago, before the addition of gift shops, restaurant, hotel, churches, statues, etc. It was hard to visualize the tragedy with the mine shaft, now covered with grass, in the midst of what seemed a profit-making venture."
76,Best seen in the winter,Short drive from the city. Nice building on a relatively small plot - so easy to walk around. Typical Russian architecture and landscape. Could probably be quite crowded - try to avoid peak periods.
77,Strange,Such a beautiful place. It was covered in a thick covering of snow when we were there which added to the experience. It was very peaceful and serene and really gave you a feel for the tragedy of the Romanov murders. You can get an uber taxi to here from the city centre for fairly cheap - would recommend.
78,An emotional experience,"The 'official' site to which the bodies of the imperial famly had been brought to, after their murder in the night of July 16th, 1918, is Ganina Yama (Ganya's pit) at the then already abandoned iron mine of the Four Brothers. For this reason the Russian Orthodox Church gave the orders in the year 2000 for the construction of a monastery dedicated to the Holy Imperial Martyrs (Passion Bearers). Quite a bit of controversy though surrounds the final remains of Czar Nicholas II and his family. One week after the execution of the last Romanovs the White Army had retaken Yekaterinburg (and kept it for 1 year) and order was given to investigate the killing of the last czar. It was then that Ganina Yama was declared as the place, where the bodies had been deposed, either thrown into the pit or destroyed.Clandestine excavations in 1979, thus still in Soviet times, at a place called Porosyonkov Ravine, a few kilometers away from here, brought to light remains that by DNA analysis were said to be from the imperial family. This was though not accepted by the Russian Church.To get to Ganina Yama it is best to take a taxi. I had it combined with the Europe-Asia border marker, a 20min drive from here. The holy site is located in the northwest of Yekaterinburg near the village of Koptyaki by lake Iset.There are seven wooden churches here, one for each member of the family. Under the main church, dedicated to Czar Nicholas II, is a museum, just as at the Church on Blood, the site of the murder, in Yekaterinburg. Around the Ganina Yama pit is a covered walkway with enlraged photos of the members of the imperial family.Women have to wear skirts and scarves, but these are - in purple color - available at the entrance gate. By the parking is a small café in a tent and an information board, also in English, with a depiction of the place, showing all the about 20 different buildings here. All the other information boards further inside though are only in Russian. At the site are also an icon shop and public toilets. Since Ganina Yama is in the middle of a forest, there can be quite a few mosquitoes in summer."
79,The place of tragedy.,"You can reach here easily via a car (we booked an Uber ride), but getting out was not as easy, because of the lack of Internet reception in the area. We managed to ask the locals for help, and saw a bus schedule at the notice board near the entrance. So, don't worry if you visit early in the day like us, because there would still be a public bus service to bring you to a metro station at Yekaterinburg City.As what other reviewers might have mentioned, the place looked like a theme park attraction, and we could cover the grounds in probably 20 minutes. Add in probably another 20-30 minutes to look at the gallery exhibits at the basement of the church."
80,Ganina Yama Monastry,"Went here on a tour and thought it was a bit like Disney land. The site seems to have been hijacked by the church to make money. A few kilometres away is another unassuming place, dependent on which version of events you believe, this is where they found the remains of the Romanovs now in St Petersburg."
81,Peaceful monastery set in beautiful birch forest,"Though the temperatures were freezing, we explored this monastery and enjoyed all the history unfolding before us.  The wooden buildings were great for photography and we were there during Maslenitza - so we were invited to enjoy them as they celebrated pancake day with yummy blini pancakes."
82,Original burial site of the Romanovs,"After Nicholas II (the last Russian Emperor) and his family  were shot by Bolsheviks in Ipatiev's house (At this place now the Church on Blood in Honour of All Saints Resplendent in the Russian Land is standing), their bodies were brought to ""Ganina Yama"" gold mine and buried in it. When the Soviet Union was gone, their bodies were re-buried in Peter and Paul fortress, in Saint Petersburg (former capital of Russia).And at the place of this Gold Mine now the Monastery is  functioning. There are seven churches (upon the 7 members of Nicholas II family), and the photos of the Emperor's family are exhibited. Most of the buildings are made of wood, but after a few fires took place, the new churches there are built of stone.The overall impression of the wooden monastery in the pine forest is absolutely great, and especially great - in winter, when everything is covered with snow. So don't miss it.A tip: In Russian orthodox curches the women must wear a shawl (a kerchief), or a hat in winter, for their head was covered, and a long skirt (a bit lower the knees)."
