0,Lovely,I didn't go here this time round but I did five years ago I would think it's the same because it's a museum it's beautiful lots to see worth visiting.
1,Wonderful garden with a view to Bosphorus and amazing palace ,"it was a really nice place and a must seen place at Istanbul.you can feel you are travelling in history and there are many places to see , many equipment like closets , beds , ...also you can see the room which great Mustafa Kamal Ataturk the person who established modern turkey spent last hours of his life in.notes: have your passport or any national id card with yourself and at the entrance of the palace they give you some headset and audio guide(they are free ) which can be very helpful . it has several languages but they dont give you if you dont have your id card .the only problems about the place was :1- there was a very long queue and  you should wait at hot weather to enter the palace . if you have credit card with yourself you can avoid waiting in the queue.2- many places were closed and you could not visit . they were repairing these parts."
2,Worth seeing!,I‚Äôve been lucky to have seen loads of palaces and their interiors but this one is best so far! ProIt‚Äôs breathtakingly beautiful. Each room nicely done and just so many times we said ‚Äúwow‚Äù ConsCan‚Äôt take photos inside!!
3,Very beautiful palace,It is a copy of European palaces nothing exciting.If you have visited  one in Europe don't bother go to this one.ticket is 14 euros Feb 2020
4,Get the audio tour,I visited the place with my family. It was a nice place and had some really nice and antique collection. Worth going to the place!
5,"Beautiful, just stunningly beautiful.","I was skeptical about visiting yet another palace in Istanbul but went following the advise of many and definitely do not regret going. Its one of the best that I have seen, the gates to the Bosphorus feels like gates to heaven! The history of the place is very indicative of old Turkey. It has amazing architecture and design complimented by beautiful furniture. Must visit while cruising the area"
6,Visit this Palace even if you only have an hour!,Beat historical place with huge treasurable history this place the first thing i fall inlove with in turkey ‚ù§Ô∏è
7,A must do! ,If you are looking for a typical palace you have seen in other parts of Europe this is one of thoseHas a lot of French influence and many chandeliers and those are made by English It has a nice setting of a seaside and a landslide entrance and exits are on both sidesLooks more a European palace but do go most of it is in 1860 or something
8,Visit Topkapi Palace first - buy the Combo ticket,"Been in Istanbul so many times and this was the first time I visited Dolmabahce Palace. I like the tour altough somehow I expected more. Many corridors parts of Palace were under restauration and closed for visitors.I general Museum has a lot to offer, nice history and way of live in last century.Main remark- Toilets are not well maintained!"
9,Live like a sultan. ,"My wife and I have been to Istanbul four times before this trip and for one reason or another have only made it to the Dolmabahce Palace on this trip. It was worth the wait and anticipation. Fortunately it was a relatively quiet day without too many people but the setting in sunshine is great. We took the main palace and the harem, the interior is stunning."
10,Best sightseeing at Istanbul,"Finally visited this palace after 6 years of living in Istanbul, It's a nice place to visit if you don't know what to do on a weekend, but then again it's like any other royal palace. A bunch of rooms with royal sofas and chandeliers. The reason I gave it a 4/5 is that they didn't charge me the local student fee as I do have a Turkish residency here, but charged me as a foreigner. The museum card was also invalid."
11,Wonderful place,"Really enjoyed visiting here, did it with a guide as part of an organised experience. The great hall is a must see!"
12,Well kept Palace worth visiting ,"I visited the place during mid Feb 20, its truelly worth visiting place for those who love history, archtecture, decor etc etc.There are 3 different zones in the palace & you have to buy 3 seperate tickets for each I forgot names of sections but I do remember that for main palace from which sultan was taking care general adminstration affairs was prices 60 lira for entry ticket & other 2 zones were 90 & 40 respectively. for the adminstrative zone you dont need any tourist guides because with the ticket you will be given a gadget which gives audio guidence once you tap it to board in any of the room which have wifi sign on it. Audio's were so much in detail & infrom the detail history of almost all objects in the room. Photography are not allowed inside the palace. One more important thing, inorder to get a gadget you need to submit your passport at ticketing sections which you take back in return at exit otherwise they keep 200 lira per gadget as security deposit which is refundable at exit gate."
13,Dolmabahce Palace,"It is well worth the trip from the old city.  It is mostly European in style with some Islamic influence.  I also visited the Harem, which is good if y have the time, else you can skip it. The clock museum is not much of a museum, very little items and an be skipped if short on time."
14,"A must see of Ottoman Extravagance, Opulence and history at the Yildiz / Dolmabah√ße Palace.",We loved seeing this but my favourite part were the gates leading out to the water (where the ancient ships used to dock).  They feel quite ethereal... I could have stayed there all day.
15,Feel like a royalty üëë,"Great place to visit , showing history in details as if you were living at that time, highly recommend"
16,Absolutely beautiful,"We've been to several palaces over the years, and this might have been our favourite besides Hampton Court Palace outside of London. The Grand Ceremony Hall literally took my breath away. I have never seen a more impressive room anywhere. There are some beautiful marks of craftsmanship throughout the palace with lovely floors, furniture, and even a 4.5 tonne crystal chandelier. You have to see the Crystal Staircase in person to appreciate how beautiful it is. Make time to see this if you go to Istanbul. One word of warning though, go at opening as the queue gets very, very long quickly."
17,"Truly superb, incredible and amazing","If you are a fun of the Ottoman empire style in architectural buildings and furniture, then this is the place to be! The palace is the largest in Turkey, and the most modern one ever built in the country, order to stand equally impressive next to the ones in Europe at the time it was constructed.Despite the heavy rain on the day of our visit, a lot of people were standing in line outside for an hour or so until they could enter. Both the outside and the inside of the palace are equally impressive, for the size of the building as well as the riches and the vibe of opulence in the air.Even if you don't have the time to stand in the line to see the inside, I would recommend to at least see the palace's main entrance when you happen to be in Besiktas area."
18,Well preserved historic building,This palace is well worth a visit . We had to queue a little and luckily we had cash . Inside is absolutely beautiful - you aren‚Äôt allowed to take photos inside which is a shame - although everyone sneaked a few including me ! It must be even nicer in summer with the gates onto the Bosphorus !
19,Very impressive ,"The staff there is rude, very rude...  I didn‚Äôt notice the there is sign of no photo inside when the sign of camera is not in solid black I used to see (in thin line).. I saw ppl taking photo and i took one out of nothing to do... there was a woman coming up to say no photo please.  I responded.  And then I heard another guy shouting at me ‚ÄúNo photo, China‚Äù... you could still shout at me when I have responded to the woman,  but it‚Äôs no point to state my nationality.."
20,Full tour,"We did this tour last week and although it was a bit crowded, you were able to see everything and there was plenty to see. I think without a guide you really won't know too much about what you are seeing. Can't take photos inside, but I understand why. We loved it. The cafe there has excellent coffee too."
21,Dolmabahce Palace,"Beautiful Dolmabah√ße is closed on Mondays and Thursday‚Äôs. We went on a Sunday and it was the only day available to us and the queues were very long. I would suggest going early in the morning if that day is your only choice. They only have three kiosk to buy tickets from. The tickets are to the Dolmabah√ße palace and you would have to pay extra to visit the Harem which is where Attaturk died. There is also a clock Museum which has clocks made by Ottoman Mawlawi clock masters English and French crafted clocks. The Glazed Pavilion was being restored so we really couldn‚Äôt see. There is also an Aviary. The palace itself is very big and it gives you an insight to how the Sultan lived. The beautiful furniture, Art work, porcelain, crystal and gold and silver dinnerware sets are stunning. Beware they don‚Äôt like pictures taken inside. I only sneaked a couple a bought a book at the exit but that really doesn‚Äôt give it any justice. There are cafeteria on sight not to expensive."
22,Nice Palace - bad photo policy,"Try to reach early as  there can be a really long que for the entrance. It's was more beautiful than I expected it to be ,great history and architecture. One must take a guide or an Audio guide(available at the entrance, Id is a must if you want audio guide )to have a better understanding and experience"
23,Fantastic experience,"This was a pleasant surprise! Not many people when we visited and the palace and grounds a gorgeous! We didn't buy the harem add-on, clock tower was also nice and be sure to sit on one of the benches by the gates near the water, the views are magnificent!"
24,Largest Palace in Turkey - Dolmabahce....,"The price to visit was 90TL to see everything which I strongly recommend , its pricy but all worth it. The Palace is heavy guarded by Police and guards upon your arrival you are are instructed to take cover your shoes with plastic covers. It's highly maintained. The Palace shares a rich history of Sultan. It's a huge palace that shows you the Sultan empire and history, it also the home of were Ataturk former President of Turkey died. It boasts magnificent insides and it's stories unfortunately you are not allowed to take pictures inside the Palace. It also has a small gift shop were you can get some nice sourveneirs of the Palace. If you love history I would suggest you visit the Palace."
25,Amazing ,"This is my first time visiting this place, having no idea of what I was going to see.The nearest stop to the palace is Kabatas, either ferry across from Kadikoy or tram line T1 last stop.  We opted for the latter as not sure how choppy the waters were going to be. A short walk (less than 5 mins) from the tramline and we were there.  We got there quite early (about 10ish) so the queue was not too long for tickets. Ticket options are 60 tl for palace, 40 tl for harem or 90tl for both. We did not know he they only accept cash only, be prepared.Once inside the palace is very grand, ( oh yeah you are asked to put on plastic shoe covers before entering ) lots of chandelier, high ceiling, so many rooms and doors you could get lost. There was a section with blue and clear glass windows which overlooks the sea view.  There are selection of drink are, clocks, furnitures,etc.Amazing floors and ceilings in the palace, not so grand in the Harem except sultan quatersPhotography is forbidden inside the palace and harem. Toilets are available both outside and inside the palace.Definitely worth going to see"
26,Opulence !!,One of the best sites we have ever visited in istanbul. It was a big fault skipping dolmahce palace.Inside u have to wear some plastic bags in your feet and u cant take pictures its forbidden.the architecture is stunning especially the ceiling.Oustide there is a big garden with the sea under the fence.It is not crowded as much as topkapi.Very beautiful palace
27,Pristinely Preserved Opulence,"I loved the palace and compared to other landmarks in Istanbul I liked the fact that they include the audio guide in the ticket price. It makes your experience very valuable. This palace is a bridge between the old Ottoman Empire and the new republican era, as it was the residence also of Ataturk until he passed away."
28,A jewel crown,"This is an amazing place to visit in Istanbul, a great old Palace that you should definitely go to during your visit"
29,Nostalgia and the history of a nation,This was one of my favorite sights. I got there to line up before it opened and I used an audio guide to learn all about the palace. I recommend getting the extra pass to see the Harem as the tour groups don‚Äôt go in there and I was alone as I wandered through. Pictures are not allowed inside and is strictly enforced. It took me about 1.5 hours to cover both buildings and by the time I was leaving it was packed with school children and tourists. Make sure to check out the aviary. Do not go to the cafe outside the gates it has the worst customer service.
30,Mixed feelings ,Our Tour guide told us to visit this palace because this palace was build by the time when ottoman empire was finishing. we went there during Bhosphorus and it was really very good palace.
31,Interesting and impressive palace,"This was a stop on one of our tours and it was magnificent. But it was very full and crowded and many people did not listen to the instructions by the staff to not take pictures inside. It was beautiful and the gardens were lovely to walk around in after. We had the audio tour but most of the time my earphones kept falling out and wasn't syncing with the next stop. And then in some cases, the audio carries on for long but the inside was so full, I couldn't stay in the room for too long. I do think it's a good idea to go and see though."
32,Amazing,We visited the Palace as a family and it was absolutely stunning. I recommend going early as the queue can be quite long
33,The new palace,You should see here really it was very good place if you come istanbul have to sew this place really fantastic!
34,WOW!!,This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. The palace is enormous and the outdoor/gardens were beautiful. Photos do not do justice to this palace. Viewing it from a ferry on the Bosphorus provides another view of just how large this place is. The only downside was the restriction on taking photos inside. The rooms were gorgeous.
35,Very beautiful Palace,"I recently went to Turkey, Dolmabahce Palace was not on our itinerary, by the end of our trip we had a couple of hours to kill, so we decided we wanted to visit this palace. We all were surprised to find out the beauty of this place. I went to Versalles a couple of months ago and believe me, knowing Versalles, you will find this palace to be completely amazing, not to big to get lost in it but with many treasures to be found. I really want to visit again, I hope I can go in April 2020."
36,OH HOW BEAUTIFUL,"This place is amazing, I really recommend visiting both Salamlek and Haramlek. Personally, I visited only Salamlek since I had limited time, you will see an amazing palace with hundreds of rooms and manually made furniture. Unfortunately, photography inside is prohibited. In order to have the guide device, which explains the palace, you should have either a passport, 200 Turkish lire or USD 100, at the end of the tour, you will return back the device and take back your passport or money."
37,100% worth to be visited,"So following the advice of a guide from free walking tour, me and my friend decided to visit this palace instead of Topkapi sarayi. And we were really glad we did! Palace, kept in all her glory, with amazing furniture, curtains, lights, even dresses in harrem, was really great to explore! So we waited to get a ticket (around an hour), but it was well worth it!"
38,Beautiful and a must see!,"Don't be fooled by some of the photos, there are no longer guards standing outside or inside by the huge entrance doors. lots of parts are under renovations, yet ticket prices are not lowered. But it's a must see place because of its history."
39,Glamorous palace,The ventilation system is top tier the air tastes amazing me and my wife slept on the sultans deathbed it was slightly musty but it was a great experience overall
40,Royal History reloaded,By far my favourite location in Istanbul. No photographs are allowed inside so it was a wonderful treat to walk around with no ones heads in their phones...mine included. The main room took my breath away! Stunning and as no photos to be seen it was a wonderful suprise.
41,Ottomans ministry,"We just found out that this palace can only be visited by visitors that under the group tour. So as we currently are traveling under ""backpacker style"" can not come inside, only able to take picture infront of the palace. If you follow the ""Bosphorus Tour"" you may also be able to see this palace from the strait"
42,Beautiful ,"This hyped up to be something spectacular but somehow doesn't live up to it. The gardens are superb but it is very busy. 90tl for the palace and harem and audio packs are free, 200tl refundable deposit or passport/driving licence. The ticket office is cash only, doesn't take cards at all You are basically rushed round the palace and harem and have to follow the designated route. It gets crowded and very hot. Some rooms you cannot see everything and there are no descriptions so without the audio tour which in itself is not so good.Some parts look like they need a good clean."
43,gorgeous palace,This is a must visit for anyone coming to Istanbul. I really enjoyed the tour of the palace and felt like I was taken back in time.
44,I expected more,"Come here to see a magnificent display of wealth and grandeur.  Plan to do a lot of walking,  it is huge.  I went to the haram first, then the clock museum,  aviary and last the palace itself. The grounds are beautiful and right on the water,  but living there meant you were behind gates all around.  Plan about 1-2 hours to visit,  and 45 min to wait in line for a ticket."
45,You need to  see it!,"Don't miss the site. it helps you to feel a touch of Haram life in Ottoman's time.there is also a room,, where AtaTurk spent his last hours. somehow touching and thrilling."
46,Worth visiting ,one of the most amazing place i have ever seen in my life! you need almost 3 hours to visit here. dont forget your camera!
47,A must see in Istanbul,"Its a very good place to visit in istanbul , you can spend a couple of hours there knowing new things about the history of istanbul , look at the things presented there and buy some souveniers , it takes about 3 hours to finish the tour and its 5 mins walk from kabatas tram station"
48,Luxurious interior palace by the sea,This place is just very nice . It is unbelievable!!! Lota of history and soul . I took my 3 children and they were is awww and amazed by its beauty.  Highly recommend also should visit the Hareem and the oil painting in the back !!!
49,So luxurious - drip drip,"If I knew what it was, I will never have gone inside. The Sultan has stolen billions from the empire, including my Country to build this Palace. The price of 12 Euros is expensive to see some chairs and curtains, paintings are not original, they are brought from other parts of Europe."
50,Very impressive,"It‚Äôs a recently built palace in the 19th century so not an ancient Ottoman palace. However, the palace grounds and building were beautiful despite the fact that most of the intricate details on their interior‚Äôs ceiling and walls were painted on instead of real carvings. So the palace cannot be compared to the palaces in Europe. They had a small museum showcasing the utensils, cutleries and kitchenwares from the ottoman empire if you are into that.Other than that, the palace was mostly about state rooms for meetings and gardens."
51,Very well structured tour of the place,We visited this Palace as it housed all Sultants of IstanbulThe place has lots to see in each room of how they lived Recommended
52,Beautiful ,"as I remember that guide told Dolmabahce Palace is largest palace in Turkey and built by Ottomans. They have own guide and when you buy entrance ticket, guide also included and no need extra for guide. Best location, Bosphorus view."
53,Worth a visit.  Quite impressive.,Our tour guide gave u a very good introduction! We used audio guides and it was perfect since we could visit each room of the palace at our own pace and pay attention to every detail explained. The gardens were just great!!!
54,oppolent palace on the bosphorus,We found the palace a bit disappointing. Most of the rooms look very similar and the guards in the palace can be a bit rough.
55,The a Grand reception hall at the end of the main palace is breathtaking in scale and opulence ,Quite an experience internally and externally in the grounds. Not allowed to take photos inside. Tour inside takes you a certain route to see in the various halls and rooms. Kids enjoyed the experience. Grounds outside enjoyable with views to the sea. Worth getting the audio headset
56,A Must to Visit,"Really a good visit.  Avoid the lines, come early.  But we really were amazed by the amount of history it covers"
57,Boring,To do with a lot of superb historically and wonderful place. Must visit the sultan harem it is more than enough to discover the wonderful life last ottoman sultan
58,Visit was ok,We went to the Dolmabache Palace on our last day and felt it was worth the steep entrance fee (90 TL for the main palace and the harem). We went on a rainy day so it was a great option to hide from the bad weather and it meant that the crowds had been driven away so the place was refreshingly quiet. The palace itself was a showcase in lavish design and splendour. We enjoyed seeing the various influences from Europe and further afield and the stunning rooms all showcased impressive decor and intricate objects. The free audio guide was extensive and very useful. It tells you about the history of the Ottoman empire and its ruling Sultans. We spent about 3 to 4 hours exploring the whole palace in detail.
59,Exquisite,We bought the combo ticket which got you into multiple attractions and this was on it. It saved a few lira doing it the his way.We were there in March 2020 so there was no Covid restrictions.It is an another amazingly beautiful building in Istanbul that must be seen. I personally loved the sea gate and the view out over the Bosphorus straight and watching the shipping go past.The whole place from the gardens to the buildings was lovely. Its hard to describe. You need to see this when you are in Istanbul.
60,Excellent audio tour,"Really enjoyed our visit. Even though it's less known than Topkapi, we actually ended up liking it more. The decorations made us feel like we travelled back in time. They don't take the museum pass but if you're a student the discount is very interesting (we ended up paying 20tl instead of 90, the normal place)"
61,A Magnificent visit!,"This palace feel a bit like a maze. It is very big, it has many lovely gardens and you must see the Harem. I suggest you take one full day to properly see it."
62,Luxury,"After Top kapi , this becomes the 2nd best museum in the cityThey still keeping everything as it is  Strongly recommended"
63,Magnificent but don't go in August,"It was raining day and I decide to visit Dolmabanche Palace.. I was really surprised how wonderful this Palace is. .Splendid rooms, but lSultan's library (oh my God what beauty), music room with so amazing instruments to bathroom all in marble. .Even stairs aer out of world with Chrystal glass columns. Amazing place. From Palace and  fantastic garden you have a  view at Bosporus. Such a  wonderful position by the sea. It is  necessary to see a Topkapi Palace, older palace and than a  new one- Dolmabanche Palace. Take time for a visit. With garden you need a few hours."
64,Palace,"It's a beautiful building well kept but the firing is pour, juts basic furniture that does not allo wthe visitor to see the big picture. Next door paint museum probably kept all paintings that would be great in here."
65,Great building pour interior and some under refurbishment. ,"How the royals lived!!! The place is very well maintained including the carpets , thanks to making visitors wear plastic over their footwear. Taking of pictures was prohibited and many managed to still click them. The Gardens with ponds and turkeys are lovely and i wish we could spend more time outdoors . We were lucky to catch a turkish millitary band performance in front of the palace. The band looked every bit part of the palace with it's fine music , grand costumes and lovely singing."
66,Breathtaking!,I visited the Dolmabahce Palace on Friday and I was amazed with the vast history and  valuable things the Palace hold. I hope new Monarchs around  the world should follow suit of building Beautiful Palaces like this.
67,Mesmerizing Dolmabahche,Amazing placeI advice you to get the free headphones at the door and listen to the explanations while you walküòç
68,Great Place,"The palace is reminiscent of the palace in France, Versailles. It is well appointed and worith the price of admission. However, the lines too get in are very long, so plan to get in line before it opens in the morning."
69,Stunning! ,Beautiful amazing place ! I recommand it. Better to visit Dolmabahce in Spring or Autumn because in the winter is cold and windy. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk spent last years of his life here. You can also see the portraits of last six sultans lived here.
70,Visit Dolmabah√ße Palace-An Oppulent Collection of Crystal Chandeliers,"I often wonder, when you see immense, opulent places like this, how the little people felt. This goes on and on and especially impressive in terms of the many and magnificent crystal chandeliers throughout."
71,Amr,The palace and it's grounds are not only beautiful but enormous. We only toured the main palace and without the guide ropes leading you around the palace it would be easy to get lost in it's extensive number of rooms. The main hall is amazing with grand chandeliers and marble columns. You can't take photos inside but it's worth a visit. The palace is right beside a tram stop which makes it easily accessible from the city centre. They provide a free audio guide although unfortunately mine stopped working half way around. The gardens look out over the strait which in the summer makes for some nice photos.
72,Well worth 2hrs visit ,Om my God my dreams going to be true by visiting this place thanks god for making this amazing trip in my life
73,Not as good as Topkapi Palace,"I guess European furniture was admired and copied.  Architecturally is quite Baroque, overloaded even."
74,The largest Turkish Palace!,"Amazing place with lot of history. It may take 3 to 4 hours to visit, very easy to reach and the entrance is for about 16$(not sure though). It s a must see when in Istanbul"
75,Mesalliance: Europe in Turkey,"the grandeur of the main palace is well worth seeing - my  husband called the Grand Reception Hall, seen at the very end of the tour, the most beautiful room he‚Äôd seen anywhere. The grounds make for a beautiful stroll. Several small museums featuring clocks, plateware, paintings. Nondescript aviary. Harem rooms costing an additional fee were all pretty mundane. Arguably architects may swoon over the architecture of the Palace complex."
76,Best ventilation system ever,The grounds and views are amazing but I found inside disappointing and you were unable to take pictures inside. To hire an audio guide you needed photo ID which we didn‚Äôt have so maybe if we had a guide our experience might have been different x
77,Amazing,Today was an awesome sunny day to view this palace. This spectacular Sultan palace built in European style is magnificent. The crystal scare staircase is brilliant and the ceremonial Hall is spectacular. The immense size and beauty of this Hall is difficult to describe.
78,Dolmabahce,"Splendid palace! Highly recommend making the journey there to walk around and definitely use the audio guide! Learnt so much from that and the narrative was very clear. My wife and I went for the ‚Äúfull‚Äù ticket which was 90lira. This includes the main palace and Harem. This would be the ticket to get as you learn not  only what went on in the main palace but the living quarters in the Harem of the Sultan‚Äôs wives and Mother Sultan.All in all out of all the attractions we visited this one was where we felt we learnt the most, and was very interesting to learn about Royal Sultan history."
79,Historical and Exquisite,"I really enjoyed my visit and morning walk in this beautiful art creation. There is a lot to see, the gardens were magnificent, the interior of the palace was stunning with an obvious Western Europe influence but balanced with the Oriental style of design. Very interesting to see, your eyes just enjoy and admire the beauty of everything. The students pay 20TL which was very good. It's definitely worth the time and the money."
80,History Speaks for itself,What a great piece of property. Definitely their lives did not have a problem at all. Once you enter you will realize they grandiosity is a synonymous of this place. Definitely a place to return and take the proper time to enjoy.
81,Atat√ºrk's bed,"We didn‚Äôt really know what to expect from our visit, but it exceeded out expectations. The queue seemed really long outside but moved quickly, as it was just for security. Really good value and definitely worth a visit."
82,Easy to explore and lovely location,"Def worth your time. This palace replaced the topkapi palace and is  huge and extravagant throughout, set right on the waters edge. Takes about 1.5 to 2 hours to see fully. Lovely gardens too."
83,Interesting history and gift shop is good,"This place reminded me of Versailles, only in Turkey! Beautifully preserved and the ballroom will have you in awe. You can't take photos inside but the private hamam is cool. Definitely see this place if you've time."
84,AMAZING,We don‚Äôt have a admission of pictures when you look around inside of palace.But outside is also well organized and has nice view.You would be interested in this place.It‚Äôs been 3hours to look around all palace rooms including harem.Well the ticket price is quite expensive but you‚Äôre not student.I wanna recommend this place to who visit to Istanbul.Ï¢ãÏùÄ Í∂ÅÏ†ÑÏù¥Îã§.

85,Get your camera and smartphone camera ready !!!,"If you want to know the history of Istanbul you must visit , it shows the 16 to 18th century of the sultan residence, they had amazing structure and they achieved so much.. I was really impressed about the structure and the artistic and detail perfection of their home.. its shows how strong they were in teh early 19th century.. A must for istantbul"
86,Splendor!,"The palace and gardens show the enormous wealth of their founders.  But after seeing the first 30 or so beautifully decorated rooms and hallways    the other 200 were "" overkill""   to me.    But if you enjoy furniture and storys on their use   it definitely is a must see"
87,A bit disappointing,"My husband, friend and I visited here. It was a wonderful day trip. Good walking shoes is needed. One could take a guided a tour, which is done in many different languages. One could wander around alone or with your own group individually. There are different kinds of packages to purchase. The whole package which gives you access to all, clock museem or to Harem only etc. You choose at the front before paying to go in. There are bathrooms (clean I must say) available to the public and cafe for anyone after or during tours. I really liked this!"
88,Beautiful !!,If you are planning to visit Istambul you must see this palace!!! You have to reserve 3-4 hours to visit it and it is worth!!!! Check out the calendar before you travel so you can plan and don‚Äôt miss it because it is close on Mondays!
89,What a Palace,It‚Äôs a beautiful well preserved palace. Worth a visit for a few hours. It has a lovely cafe by the sea
90,Witnesses on the great architectural history of Turkey,There was no enough information about history and it was too crowded. I dont know why photo is forbidden to take
91,Nice place with worst staff ,After visiting Topkapi palace which gives an ancient peep into Turkish Empire Dolmabahce Palace is a truly modern palace that brings the east and the west together. The Architecture gives you a feel of European palaces and a touch of Asian class. The location of the palace just at the bank of Bosphorous adds several feathers to it's beauty. If you are visiting Istanbul don't miss to visit this 19th century architectural marvel.
92,Absolutely stunning ,"Probably the highlight of my trip, I simply cannot forget the grand hall and the chandelier that adorned the middle of the hall. Most of the bedrooms overlooked the Bosphorus as well as the palace itself. Gorgeous gardens, regal rooms full of period drapery, furniture and floor coverings. Paintings adorning the walls and a good selection of the Sultans personal items on display. Remember to pick up an audio guide in your respective language. Very enjoyable experience highly recommended. Your trip to Istanbul isn't complete if you haven't visited the Dolmaba√ße Palace"
93,Must Visit,Went to Istanbul for a break....be warned most attractions are under MAJOR renovations for next 2 to 3 years.  Therefore found things like blue mosque etc very disappointing...however this palace was a little gem.  Amazing bling.  There is some renovation but not too much.  Well worth a visit. As normal take cash as places in Istanbul don‚Äôt take cards.  Also for free audio guide you must hand over driving license or passport as deposit...
94,A must visit,This palace is really beautiful and it worth the visit. the location of it is very beautiful and i recommend to spend some quite time sitting there and watching the sea.
95,Must see in Istanbul ,Very beautiful palace from outside and inside . It was very close to our hotel ( grand Hayatt ) so we managed to go there 1 hour before closing time to avoid the traffic .Rooms are nice and it shows the beauty of the buildings during the ottoman sultan reigns .
96,Beautiful place ,Great place e to visit.Very well preserved and has the opulence of the Sultans .The only problem are the lines to buy tickets and to get inside.
97,Worth visiting ,"The palace it's very beatiful. The gardens are full of flowers. I recommend visiting the palace in the morning. It's not so crowded. Also, you can only pay cash tickets, but in the yard are ATMs."
98,See how the other half live,If you are in Istanbul you must see Dolmabahce palace. I recommend you to visit this atraction at the morning before the croud started.
99,Interesting visit ,"I do not see Dolmabahce Palace as home to some of our sultans. I only think of it as the place where Mustafa Kemal, the Father of our Nation, died. May he rest in peace forever! Looking at his room and the bed with the flag was an experience I will never forget."
100,Stunning,"The best ventilation system ever, plenty of subways because of the Arabs which is great and the water fountain helped me and my  50 year wife finally get ready for her first time"
101,Visit to the Palace Meuseum,"Does not fell right, European (close to Italian architecture) in the middle of Turkey.... really? Yes, the palace is quite nice, but it, IMHO, is a total dissonance with the Istanbul spirit.  Worth visiting anyway, Guided tours were not helpful, especially off season."
102,Royalty ,"Well worth the trip out there. We got a taxi, very cheap üëçBeautiful grounds and buildings plus added bonus of breeze as it‚Äôs right by the water.One of two highlights in Istanbul."
103,Historical,"The palace is so beautiful and an underrated place in my opinion. We missed out on the painting museum and the glass pavillion because of restoration, but id was still worth every penny. If you are visiting Istanbul definitely don't miss out on this!"
104,Palace with Unbelivable View,"What a place! A must see.Give yourself at least 5 hours, it is worth it. The place is an architectural dream and the gardens are beautiful.Plastic bags are given to you so you can cover your shoes before you enter. So not a good idea to wear heels or platforms.He tickets to the harem are extra but well worth it."
105,Luxury at its finest,"By any yardstick, it is worth the visit. It is easy to reach. and the ques are  long, but orderly, However one can buy a fast track ticket, which is costlier than the normal one-and gain the entry right away.The grounds, the park are very well maintained and prepare you for whats inside. The opulence , and the grandeur inside is only to be seen to be believed. Unfortunately , no photography is allowed inside the palace. Audio guide sets are available, on payment, But included if you have bought the fast track ticket. It will require you to keep some ID as a deposit though .The small cafeteria is very reasonably  priced snacks and well spread out to sit and relax before or after the palace tour itself."
106,The bestttt to see,"Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have a chance to get inside the palace, anyway, seeing the palace fine arch details from outside and quality that stays until now gives insights on Turkey‚Äôs empire bright days. Deserve to see and to passing by."
107,Gorgeous Palace,"Amazing place , worth the time , effort and money .Dont miss the visit for any thing and make sure to go early as it takes time ."
108,Over the top!,the most luxurious palace that builted in Europe and led almost to economical crisis the empire. just wait to reach the main ball room and reception hall. you will start dancing a walse
109,most amazing Heritage,placed beside the sea looking great even from out side. the garden and the building it selves looks good and the architecture is very nice the paintings inside and the whole things was really good specially the library full of old books looks Georges. very easy to be reached by tram.
110,Amazing place,"Oh how I regret not getting the free audio tour, great palace with great luxuries, massive palace worth the visit."
111,Memorable visit.,"A lot has been said about this palace: great location, impressive building and views. One thing that particularly impressed me was the every modern and well though through audio guide. I‚Äôd advise you to take one."
112,The last palace of the ottaman empire,"this venue is a MUST to visit, so beautiful and so historical, the palace, the harem and the garden. I really recommended everyone to visit this palace"
113,Fascinating window to life of Ottoman Sultans,I am still dreaming about this palace! Do not hesitate to visit it! It is easily to access and you will find out the sultans‚Äô way of living.
114,Amazing place to visit ,It was by far the most beautiful palace I have ever seen. The hour wait outside was so worth it. Go early! Enjoy!
115,Very impressive palace,"Must visit this Elegant   Magnificent Palace , Top of the line decor with elegant style all the way through the palace."
116,A must see if in Istanbul!,"Try to go as early as you can to the palace to avoid the long ques as it's one of the main attractions of Istanbul . It's a must see, as it takes you to how the Ottoman emperor was living around the 19th century. Strictly no photos or videos inside."
117,Stunning. ,The palace is so remarkable. Another symbol how Ottoman Empire used the money when things were going downhill. It resembles the Versailles in many ways. The palace is on the Asian side and just by the ocean. Remarkable views.
118,Beautiful place a must see when in Istanbul,The palace is so beautiful. It has relics. The best palace to visit because of its art and architecture.
119,A must visit for the art and architecture,A very beautiful place indeed. Not to be missed when in Istanbul. It‚Äôs located in Be≈üikta≈ü area. Very crowded and long queues (although the queue moved at a quick pace). So best to visit early morning. The tickets are of different prices for certain sections of the palace ranging from 40 to 90 lira. The 90 lira ticket includes everything. You would need to deposit 200 lira if you want the audio tour set. It‚Äôs a beautiful sight on the inside.
120,Truely stunning,A beautiful palace with lots of history. A nice insight on how they were living at that time. Proximity to the Bosphore gives an extra value.
121,Amazing and very well organised ,"This place is HUGE.  Easily one of the biggest palaces in the world.  The rooms, and  furnishings are very impressive. Photos are not allowed inside the palace.  Our local agent in Istanbul (Efendi Travel) had organised guided tours of the city for us, but inside the palace our small group (we were only three couples, a total of six people) was merged into a larger group, and led around by a palace guide.  Some kind of guidance is an absolute must, if you wander around on your own, you would waste a lot of time and still not see all the important areas, rooms, etc... This palace is relatively new, it was built in the mid 1800's.  Several historical events relating to recent Turkish history took place here, (Ataturk died here), the guides will explain everything.  I repeat: it is huge, it is much better to be guided through this complex than to strike out on your own with an audio guide.  You can seek clarifications from a human guide, not from a recorded audio guide!  A word of caution: little kids, or for that matter, even teenagers, may be bored with seeing room after room.  Also, if you do not have a passion for history you may find the whole thing quite uninteresting.  The location of the palace on the Bosporus is fantastic.  The views from outside the palace, of the Bosporus, are  stunning.  Some people may even find the outside more interesting than the inside!  You can get great photos from outside.  Incidentally, there is a huge cafe just outside the palace, the location could not be better, on the banks of the Bosporus.  Food is good.  Just outside the palace is the Dolmabahce Mosque.  A small, but really beautiful mosque.  Well worth seeing.  Don't miss it!  Photos allowed inside this mosque."
122,A must visit,Dolmabah√ße Sarayƒ± the place were you can learn about the Ottoman Empire and the great architects of all time.
123,"Yes, this is a most see one Istanbul!","Amazing history, especially the mix of old Ottomans lives there and Mustafa Ataturk who passed away in this palace. Very interesting place that must see."
124,Must see,"Whatever I say about this palace is not enough. I had no expectations, I knew roughly what it represented, who was livin there and how old it was, but its appearance and interior were breathtaking. As if time had stopped, the rooms were perfectly preserved, which delighted me. After some time of the tour, one can see exactly how life worked in the palace then. Photography is not allowed in the palace, which may be a plus, soo you can to enjoy and observe with pleasure. Photos are allowed in the courtyard which is impressive. The gates are magnificent. The decorations, the details all are perfect. Entrance fee if you want see all rooms is 90tl, , the harem costs 40tl, the rest of the palace is 60tl, if purchased separately, Students with ISIC card pay 20tl,I think, and children up to 6y are free. It doesn't work on Mondays. It takes a minimum of 2-3 hours for everything to be visited and inspected."
125,A must-see place is Istanbul,The place is truely beautiful. Gets very busy with tourist in the season. I recommend to visit both Palace and Harem if you have the time. A lot less people visit the Harem. You Will see Ataturk dead bed in the Harem. The combi ticket for both places is 90 ¬£.
126,A MUST SEE in Istanbul!,Don‚Äôt even think of kissing this. Get their early to avoid long queues. No need to spend extra for Harem. Pictures not allowed and even stopped harshly by the staff. Why the pics not allowed if it‚Äôs a public space? Sorry dudes. I can‚Äôt rely on my memory only to recall this wonderful place
127,It will leave you in AWE!!!! Best part of Istanbul,"1.  The palace is a very great beautiful architecture no matter it is exterior or inside.  2.  Please note that photography is not allowed indoor.3.  The self-audio tour is free of charge and I would recommend you get one for your tour.  It provides you much more information than the leaflet that is available at the entrance.  You would need your driving license or your passport as a guarantee for the audio equipment.4.  You can visit the main building by 60 TL, or 90 TL for the palace and two exhibitions.  I spend more than 2 hours in the main building.5.  It can be very crowded.  So if you want to enjoy it more peacefully, come early.  It opens from 9am to 4pm except it is closed on Monday.6.  There are gift shops and coffee shops inside the palace."
128,Elegant and Magnificent,"We went to the Palace and got ourselves the audio tour guide which was quite good. The Palace and the Harem are very well kept and it was educational. We got to understand the life of the rulers and wives and the role of queen mothers. Got to see the opulence, chandeliers, wardrobes, furniture, crystal ware..."
129,Well ,This palace has something special which is despite being Ottoman it has that mixture with European styleLots of late events of Ottoman Empire and early years of Turkish state happened there It has also furniture So it is a must see in Istanbul
130,Visit to Dolmabache,"If you use the ferry service on the Bosphurus you can see the palace as you pass by, of course though seeing the palace on the inside is worth the visit.  Easily accessible by tram from the centre of Istanbul or if on the Ferry you come off at Besiktas, turn left on the main road and walk down to the entrance.  We must have gone in the low season as whilst there was a queue to get the ticket it wasn‚Äôt very busy in the palace, often having some rooms to yourself.  Of course in summer this will be a different story.  The ticket can be bought for the main palace building and the harem (Sultans private living quarters) for 90 TL per adult, I thinks it‚Äôs worth it.  The walk round is quite long and you will see many rooms filled with ornate designs on the ceilings and some very fine furnishings.  I would allow at least 2-3 hours as you may well decide to take a coffee break between seeing the palace and the harem.  Also can take plenty of pictures outside but not inside, although I took some cheeky snaps.  The grand hall is something to behold.  The harem also has the last resting place of Ataturk, the well respected and loved leader of Turkey in Years gone by.  The gardens are large and beautiful, alongside the Bosphurus, doesn‚Äôt get much better than that."
131,Honestly the highlight of my trip,"In order to better understand and get the right timeline I suggest visiting the Topkapi palace first (read that review), as it was the first Sultans' residence before Dolmabahce.Dolmabahce Palace was built in mid 1800's right on the Bosphorus straight, to replace the previous Sultan's seat.Comparing the two, I find the Topkapi more authentic, as it's pure Ottoman design.In Dolmabahce you can notice the western influence from that era with many Baroque and Rococo details combined with Ottoman, yet is a nice mix.In total, 6 sultans and Ataturk resided here and it's a perfect place to explore.Make sure you buy the Combo ticket - for Palace and Harem. It costs 1200 TL, around 15$, as in the Harem is the famous room where Ataturk passed away.Also don't skip the Clock room and Crystal Hall (both in separate bldgs) as they contain remarkable items.The only reason for 4 stars is that taking pics is prohibited for some reason ???, so mine enclosed were taken secretly, pls don't mind the lower quality therefore."
132,"""A must place to visit in Istanbul"" Dolmabahce Palace","Big, beautiful, old style history and opulence all wrapped up in one walkable locale. This is a fun place to visit and a great one for photographs. A professional guide can usher you through it in 90 minutes or less and it is time very well invested. A premium stop for all the right reasons."
133,ENJOY THE GRANDEUR,The palace and grounds was very beautiful. It was definitely worth the money. Only drawback is you cannot take any photos inside.
134,Where Mustafa Kemal died,One of the best palace i have ever see The garden? Fantastic. Please.visit the harem and rember you buy ticket only in the entrance.you can not buy inside in case you change your mind..we book a tour and thebguide does not tell us about that..I was angry because was fat the entrance and i did not have the time. The best place ever..And visit the harem in this palace but also to.top kapi
135,Stunning in every way,"Dolmabah√ße Palace was a wonderful surprise. I didn‚Äôt expect to see such grandeur. It is beautifully situated on the banks of the Bosporus and is very well preserved. The main greeting rooms are very ornate and are amazing. There‚Äôs also a crystal staircase and stunning, crystal chandeliers. Visiting this palace was the highlight of my trip to Istanbul. A definite must see. It was also very easy to get to by tram."
136,Beautiful Place along the Bosphorous,"This palace is out of control! I‚Äôve never seen anything like this. Bacar√° glass railing, the chandeliers, the marvel bathrooms and every detail that sultans brought from all over the world. This gives the word ‚ÄúSultan‚Äù another meaning in my life. I never imagined the wealth they had until I visited this place. Photos not allowed but you can find them in google"
137,Visit to Dolmabahce Palce,The palace is beautiful. Amazingly huge. The things inside are pretty. Only complain you cant take piks inside !!! But otherwise amazing place with amazing history. Must visit if you're going istanbul.
138,Palace visits,You should visit the Dolmsbah√ße Palace if You intend to understand the lifestyle of the Ottoman dynasty in 19th and early 20th century.
139,"Amazing Palace, steeped in history and a must see in Istanbul!",Loved our visit to this beautiful palace in Istanbul!Be sure to pick up audio guide to take in all the details.  Great location on the Bosporus Strait
140,Dolmabahce with its relaxing atmosphere ,"It‚Äôs a must see if you r visiting isthanbul. Very beautiful palace . Remember to take cash for buying tickets, as card payment is not available. Monday the palace is closed for tourists."
141,Can only be visited by group tour,"The palace is located along the Bosphorus and the scene was AMAZING! The palace itself was beautiful and since no photography was allowed inside, it was a really nice walk without having people shoving cameras around (and occasionally hitting my head cause I'm short). We travelled with low mobility elders which would usually be difficult and slow but we did not face difficulties here, no problem going up stairs. We came late so managed to enter only the official part of the palace. And if you have purchased a museum pass, this is not covered in the pass so you will have to buy separate tickets for here. For the official building it cost us about 60TRY each adult."
142,Awesome!,In case you are visiting Istanbul with your friend or the loved one make sure to visit here. There is a cafe nearby just beside the Bosphorus Strait with a stunning view. You can order tea with Baklava or other chocolate pies.
143,Not to be missed,"Ottoman Empire at its best is presented inside that magnificent Palace . From the minute you walk in and the rooms of the Sultan to the Dinning area , the tour will end at the the huge important hall where the sultan received the ambassadors and leaders from around the world . The views from the place on the Bosphoros are breathtaking and explains why this particular location was picked . The busiest part of the palace is the room where they keep prophet Mohamed belongings alone with his early companions , the line is about 30-45 minutes but if you are interested in learning about religions then they ya worth the wait and if you are Muslim then you better stand in the line because you are about to see amazing things that will put tears in your eyes Have nice comfortable shoes because you are going to walk a lotttttttttt."
144,A glimpse into late Sultanate life,"It's further out from the centre of Istanbul then the other attractions, but worth a visit. Take the tram all the way to the Kabatas station, then walk 10 minutes to the palace. We opted for the Palace and Harem, costing 90 lira. No need to pay extra for the audio guide, but you have to leave your ID or 200 lira.I preferred the Topkapi palace, but it's different, so go see both.The Crystal museum was closed, but the clock museum is included in the price.No photos inside."
145,A More Intinate Palace,"Wonderful place, full of opulent furniture and decoration! Too bad you are not allowed to take any photos!"
146,Historical place,"Due to paucity of time, had a quick visit for an hour only.Amazing... exciting... beautiful.. splendid.. architecture... artefacts.. decorations..Can not take pictures inside. They give headphones which automatically get triggered in different sections in different chosen languages explaining the details of those sections of the palace.Ganesh J"
147,Magnificent Baroque Palace,"Nice place for eastren culture, the eara of oteman empire sultansHas many antiques and wonderful architecturesIt represent the whole sultans life detailsAlso there is the painting museum with very beautiful paint"
148,Grandiose Turkish history worth viewing,"One of the most beautiful palaces I have been to. True to its location of bank of Bosphorus it has elements of both East and Western collections. Beautiful Bohemian crystal chandeliers and other articles, French vases and European vases and Chinese collections"
149,The splendour and grandeur of the Turkish Sultans,"One of the most beautiful palaces I have visited ... The history is rich, and detailed explanations can be found in every corner of the palace.However, a very long queue should be taken into account when planning the day of the visit, or pre-order, with a small fee. .I must note that Istanbul in general, and its various sites, despite its size and the amount of people present at any given moment, are very clean and welcoming."
150,Beautiful,"It probably doesn't have the big gardens of Versailles, but the building itself in my opinion is way better and beautiful than the one in France.It's an exquisite to observe this jewel of the Ottoman Empire heritage."
151,You must see this,One of its kind architecture this palace is just next to the sea and has a unique architecture. The interiors are a must visit they will give you a plastic to wrap around your shoes to preserve the interiors of the palace. It is just amazing
152,Definitely worth a visit !,It is a huge luxury palace with many wings it provides a clear view about how the old Ottoman Sultans live.There is a long line for security check and for ticketing.Last chance for check in is 4 pmWeekly day off : MondayTickets : 60 Tl for all the wings of the palace except Harem wing ( this will cost you extra 40 Tl) .Museum card is not applicable here.In order to receive a personal guide audio system you have to leave a passport or any other official document as a guarantee till the end of the visit.
153,Tourist Visit.,"It's a big and well designed palace, full of history and elegance of the ottoman empire. I suggest when visiting this magnificent palace, you should buy the ticket with the full access to the harem. It's worth it."
154,Just over the top decor,"Very interesting place.  Much better with a guided tour to get the whole picture.  Lots of interesting things to see and learn about a piece of Turkey's history.  For some reason, staff are obsessed with people not taking pictures inside.  They should allow pictures without flash (most cameras today can handle low light conditions). Anyway, an absolutely beautiful and interesting place to see and visit.  Make some time to sit in one of its cafes just facing the strait and enjoy a snack and tea or coffee.  It will round up the experience to a perfect day or afternoon."
155,Book tickets in advance :-),"very intersting museum that shows how the sultan's all family (himself, his wife and his mother hehe lived)to see the bed room, the halls, the bathrooms - it was beautiful but there  were 2 things that were dissapointed: first is that for the painting room need to pay extra money (20 lire) , it doesnt include iwth the museum, ticket (90 lira). the second thing is the toilet is not clean!!!"
156,The jewel of the Bosphorus.,As you walk through the palace you will see how the sultan and his family lived. Best exhibition of furniture and typical for this period staff. Probably the most beautiful palace I've seen and definitely more beautiful then Versailles. Unique architecture and design!
157,Beautiful Palace ,"I walked to this palace from my hotel near Taksim Square in about 15 minutes. An audioguide is included with the entrance fee, although you have to leave your passport or cash to get it. I found the information on the audioguide really interesting - there was so much history I didn't know about. I got a ticket for the palace and the harem as well. The palace was very ornate and there were some surprised including amazing chandeliers made in Britain!"
158,Beautiful place ,"Design, architecture, paintings,crystals, Bosporus they combine a place from fairytales. It explains the ottoman fame without words"
159,Dolmabahce Palace,This is a highlight of all sights in Istanbul. The palace itself is a treasure. Very interesting guided tour. Not crowded due to tours.
160,MUST DO!!,"The palace is great, must to see if you visit turkey. Pictures are not allowed, the ticket is 90 TL. Amazing view of Bosphorus and a lot of beautiful details of the palace's history are presented inside, you can take an free audio guide from the palace's entrance (where the tickes are scanned for the second time)"
161,Grandeur!,Lovely gardens and if you like bling you'll enjoy the gold in every room of this palace. Lots of room to take in (many many chairs). No cameras permitted so you've got to take in the sites by eye and remember. If you just want a brief look at the lifestyle and bling then I'd suggest just the Harem rather than the full palace. Lovely views out on to the river.
162,Where more is not enough,Do yourself a favour and go to this palace - it is worth it! The gardens are beautiful and not to mention the building architecture! Absolutely loved walking through the palace - the decor and paintings are simply stunning! Just so sad that you pay all that money and cannot take photos. Surely this can be changed? Not sure on the reasons for no photos.
163,Magnificent palace full of history,"The palace has great security and Covid restrictions are greatly enforced.No photo or video allowed and they mean it, don't try it.The tour although informative with the portable free phones, Inside it is very warm almost hot, unfortunately I  felt like getting out as soon as possible."
164,Grandeur,"worth the visit.  I would recommend going later in the day but all the tours show up in the morning.  If you arrive post 3 pm (15:00), the lines were non-existent."
165,A must see ,"This palace is great in any respect. Most impressive though was the moment when we were standing in front of the bed in which the Father of the Nation died. Very solemn, very impressive, much more so than the brilliant rest of the building."
166,Wonderful ,"Highly recommended, you follow a path demarcated for you and you have no idea which part of the building you're in from the inside but you can see and learn so much. Definitely get the free audio guide with you to have a bit more context"
167,Definitely worth a visit,This was the sultans palace with all the splendor and decor.We took the free audio guide included in the the tour and it was adequate.
168,The Versailles of Istanbul,A fantastic place for a daily visit. You can spend a whole day here. The halls are full of unique furniture and pictures. The garden is extremely beautiful! Better visit it early in the morning because of the long queues!You will enjoy it!
169,Stunning and spectacular ,"Palace from Ottomans to new Republic of Turkey. in everywhere history.No need guide, because when you buy ticket, you can enter the Palace and they have own guide to tell about Palace. Must see...."
170,Buckingham Palace who ??,Such a beautiful historic palace. Has a super cozy and nice cafe near the art gallery. Highly recommended.
171,Very luxurious and well conserved,"Not as huge as topkapi palace but different. I liked this better than topkapi because audio guide is free, and gives very useful information around the palace and its history. Lots of rooms, artefacts, furniture, paintings etc to appreciate while guided by the audio guide where to go next, what to pay attention to. You get a sense of the past inhabitants lifestyles. No pictures allowed though."
172,Awesome!,"This is one palace where opulence is taking to the highest level I think. The ceilings,chandeliers, tapestry, furniture, crystal staircase, all of it ...... UNBELIEVABLE!!! You cannot possibly miss out on visiting this beautiful palace. The view of the Bosphorus, stunning!!!"
173,Magnificent Palace,"Absolutely worthfull! You can‚Äôt see Tokapi, without seeing after Dolmabahce palace. Then you will have a complete overview about sultan‚Äôs life style. And it s really outstanding!!"
174,Beautiful palace,"The palace is not associated with the Ministry of Culture so the Museum Card is useless here.  90TL to visit everything (the apartment + haram + something I can‚Äôt remember and didn‚Äôt go due to time strain).  You can‚Äôt take photos inside, which I found ridiculous.  If the old palace would allow you to take photos inside, why the new palace wouldn‚Äôt?  I can't think of a good reason other than trying to sell visitors the guide book?  Audio guide is quite poor too, it didn‚Äôt give much more information than what‚Äôs on the display boards.  If they allow us to take the photos, then the ticket price is tolerable.  Saying this, this palace's decoration is way over the top.  You can imagine why Ottoman Empire's finance got into trouble after they built this palace."
175,A huge sultan palace,"Dolmabahce Palace is a must see. Amazing all around, from outside and inside. I was stunned by 2 of the halls in the palace so much that I stood still for several minutes and couldn‚Äôt move on. I wish they would permit photography. My only complain is the weather inside the palace. We were there in August. It‚Äôs extremely hot and they don‚Äôt have any ventilation system and they also for some reason keep most of the windows shut. We got roasted inside."
176,Opulence at its best ,"This Palace is amazing! The Harem slightly less so. Two things to suggest: we would have been interested in how the workers in the place lived, the kitchens, living quarters etc. And second, the Painting Museum on site ought to be included in the cost of admission to the grounds...which is quite steep and not included in the Museum Pass"
177,"Enchanted, delighted, amazed...",Here is the one of beautiful palace in istanbul and Ataturk was lived here and died at 09.05 in 1938.there are many rooms for different purpose and all of them furnished and are very nice.there are a crystals museum which is amazing.architectural of this palace is very nice.
178,Really Stunning,"Very elegant palace, we walked through the beautiful garden's we walked on the crystal staircase - glamourous ...amazing. The Sultan's marble hammam is incredible with see views through the windows. In the Harem you walk through the room where Atat√ºrk passed awayFinally we enjoyed Lunch at the nearby cafe. My husband was delighted when We came across the Besiktas stadium the other side of the traffic when leaving the palace."
179,Beautiful ,One of the best places to see in Istanbul! I recommend to hire a personal guide and customize your excursion to include all the places you want to visit in one or two days.
180,beautiful palace,"The palace is very good and modern. Interiors is like other European palaces but best part is, it‚Äôs location on Sea. It‚Äôs very for taking pics. Otherwise nothing special I side the palace as u are not allowed to take pics and not take movie. For the entrance cost one can god for a good restaurant"
181,Beautiful palace - extortion ticket price though,Simply beautiful. Covid-19 precautions in place. Fantastic audio guide was free and had trigger points that identified where you were and told you about that specific area. Lots of security and staff should you need them and the building and views are incredible. We had a lovely time. Thank you
182,One of the most beautiful palace I‚Äôve ever seen ,The type of place you have to visit if you appreciate ancient art and artifacts. The craftsmanship of everything you see will astound you.
183,Beautiful Dolmabah√ße Palace ,It is a great atmosphere to be there with the smell of history. You can get a wonderful view from the seaside.
184,Beautiful Palace on the Bosphorus,The place is amazing. Get ready for a long tour! Also a great tip for ISIC card holders (students) - the entrance fee is 20TL instead of 90!
185,One of best things in Istanbul ,One of my favorite sites in Istanbul. Dolmabahce Palace is absolutely stunning. I highly recommend to anyone visiting Istanbul - this is a must!
186,Beautiful,Classic display of art and architecture. Could sure add/ open up some more areas . Audio guide system  is  very good .
187,Lots of rooms,"An excellent history. A visitor should get the audio guide to enhance the tour.My family and I enjoyed the visit. It shows how Turkey ""bridged"" the medieval to the modern ages. Political history of the Ottoman empire very well depicted."
188,Must See when in Istanbul,The white palace is beautiful and amazing. It gives the atmosphere of luxury. There‚Äôs a cafe nearby where visitors can see the beautiful sea.
189,very interesting museum,"The most important part of your appreciation of any building, museum or palace is the people working there. In my case, I've been there on the 10th of August, I found out myself with a rude selling tickets clerk( the 1st one to the right) who was representing the definition of unprofessionalism( super rude), not talking about the ticket price ( the highest we faced in our 10 days stay in Istanbul), passing by the lady who gave the audio guide (you can easily feel that she hates her job), the people working inside the palace(their job is limited to stare angrily at people and ask them to not take pictures).The good part of this is that I did although the tour, as I was already on my last day and so far to go back to my hotel. The palace is huge and represents many periods of Sultans lives as well as other periods/ the audio guide provides valuable information in different languages.PS:I need to say that the last person that we encountered on this palace, was the man who retrieved the audio guide items and gave us our ID back, was the only bright side of this human contact experience, he was welcoming and apologizing when I said that I'm surprised that somebody is smiling here."
190,VERY BEAUTIFUL PALACE,"This palace was built in 1856 and reflects the wish of the sultans of the period to open towards the culture of western Europe, while at the same time overtaking the other sovereigns in luxury. The decorations, the furniture and especially the huge crystal chandeliers in each room, are a display of opulence to show the place the sultan had. It is truly something to behold. After the official rooms, the harem rooms seem a little underwhelmed, as they are more simple. Also, we went in the morning and there was practically no line."
191,Almost too big,Up close to the Sultan's hunting home.  Really get a sense of the luxury of the furnishings as its still intact.
192,Little Topkapi,"Dolmabahce Palace is perhaps quite underrated/understated compared to the other places of interest in Istanbul. The palace overlooks the Bosphorus, and is a sight to behold. If one is staying near sultanahmet area, just get on the train towards kabatas station and get down at the last stop. From the station it is a 7-10 mins walk. There are essentially 2 sections to the museum, The palace itselft & The Harem. combined ticket prices was 90 Lira/person. Bought separately, i think it was 60 for the Palace & 40 for the Harem section. Also theres a picture gallery for which the ticket can be bought separately. I'd say just visit the palace & skip the harem section as it just contains the rooms of the Sultan's wives/mother.Coming back to the palace, i thought it was the most visually striking palace i've visited (i've visited kensington, buckingham palace). The interior and the exterior is worth the admission price and one can take beautiful pictures outside the castle.One thing to note, it is closed on Monday(i think) and they only admit a certain quota of guests everyday so better go there early."
193,OTTOMAN SPLENDOUR,"Amazing palace in IstanbulIt's very huge palace with a small detail big hall with amazing decorationYou can spend 4 , 5 hourDont miss it I really recommend"
194,Stunning,Fascinating. Worth it to pay full ticket to get full access and earphones with commentary. Need at least two hours. Lovely cafe outside on shores of river.
195,Great palace,Beautiful visit but check the hours before you go. The Harem closes around 4pm and the rest 6p.m if you want To see everything start with the Harem
196,delightful,Beautiful outdoor grounds as well as a well preserved interior. Audia guide for all visitors. Takes you through the rooms of the palace in a coordinated fashion.Mandatory to wear masks during the whole tour. Security officers enforced this rule where possible. Overall lovely experience. Would recommend.
197,Magnificent palace ,Fantastic scenery palace. Ottoman Sultan's palace and Ataturk. A lot of best spots for OOTD and portrait. Don't forget to take rest at cafe that serves nice coffee and cake.Very recommended. entrance fee 90 lira
198,beautiful and well organized,Amazing place to visit. Highly recommend it. Harem part is a must see. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.
199,Beautiful palace,Highly recommend to go. You can combine with a trip for breakfast to the breakfast street in Be≈üikta≈ü. Enjoyed the Pisis and pancakes before a stroll in the palace. When done with visit walk to the ferry dock and go to Uskudar for a stroll along the Bosphorous then grab a taxi for dinner in Kidikoy Ferry run every half hour or so. Kidikoy is super fun and less touristic.
200,Probably best palace on the world,"Appalling organisation - totally unclear that individuals could enter much more quickly than tour groups and didn't need to join the long queue.Really very little of interest to see inside. The palace is very new, and most of the contents were off-limits, or better examples of the European artefacts could be seen elsewhere in Europe (and probably cheaper).Not particularly well-conserved (I wonder what they do with all the entrance fees). Exception crowded - with little attempt to control the number of people (perhaps the concept of timed tickets is too difficult). I was surprised by the insistence to weat plastic overshoes to protect the carpet. This presented a slipping hazard and was totally unnecessary given that the carpet was not of any historical relevance whatsoever.I did think the architecture was interesting - but best seen from a ferry crossing the harbour.I really wouldn't waste time and money visiting this palace"
201,Great Experience,"It is a nice experience to see how the last of the Royalty lived. Not as extravagant as some countries, but inspiring nevertheless. Very friendly staff."
202,Good palace,"Gorgeous place where you can feel the encient Istabul. The palace is adorable, beautiful and full of positive energy."
203,Beautiful and well maintained,"This place was a 5 minute walk from Kabatas tram line which is on the T1 tram link, same as the  Sultanahmed tram line.Firstly I have to say wife and I were blown away by this place, the outside surroundings was sooo pretty, and the inside was even more gorgeous. We were lucky to go end of September as it was very quiet inside the Palace.My wife was just in awe, I don't want to give too much away but I would definitely recommend visiting this palace while in Istanhbul even if you only have an hour!Personally I would say in total you need about 90mins-120mins. They have a couple of small museums outside the Palace too along with cafes. From what I recall we paid about 90 lira per adult (¬£10), well worth it."
204,Loved this tour,worth all the money spent. Colourful interiors . Massive halls with lavish paintings especially ceiling. Sad camera not allowed
205,Most awesome place ,This palace is beautiful and a must visit in Istanbul. The grounds are expansive and stunning overlooking the Bosphorous strait. The inside is exquisite!!
206,Nice Palace,"Impressive. You need a few hours to go through it, especially as you may need to let pass some noisy groups. The combined ticket is worth it."
207,helps your soul to travel through history,"You will find many people visiting the palace. Take your time, do not do it if you do not have pleanty of time."
208,"Well worth the visit, but a guide really helps",Bring cash and wear comfortable shoes! I spent 3 hours in the palace. You listen to audio commentary that tells you the history. You're not allowed to take pictures. It is beautiful inside and gives you an insight of how the Ottomans lived. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you're a footie fan across the road is Be≈üikta≈ü football stadium!!
209,A family visit to Dolmabahce Palace,"Amazing opulence, huge, ornate, spectacular. Arrive early to miss the crowds of tour groups. Well worth a visit to see how the Sultans lived."
210,Just Another Palace,"Very magnificent and beautiful, gives a feeling of time traveling üòä Audio guides are provided for free, the routs are well organized. They preserved original interiors, including even curtains and carpets. Worth visiting"
211,Excellent visit,"This is a must see, just amazing opulance especially the chandeliers which are eye watering.No camera's aloud, dont forget to get a post card from there shop."
212,Rich heritage,The palace is an amazing design and example of ottoman region. Located right on the Bosphorus it is idyllic and lovely!
213,Amazing Palace,We did a whole walk trough the garden with beautiful view to the Golden horn. The palace and the harem are very interesting. Both caffe‚Äôs inside are nice and pleasant.
214,Gates to the Bosphorus,"This is totally a must see palace! Totally Impressive! The gold, the decoration, the furnitures! Beyond!"
215,Baroque palace in Istanbul,A couple of hours are rarely enough. Many subtleties. A great many stories... Dolmabah√ße palace takes you to a totally extraordinary world with its enchanting climate.
216,the best palace,"An incredible piece of architecture idyllically placed along the Bosphorus. The audio self guided tour is excellent with plenty of interesting information and gives the time to tour at your own pace. Some people rushed through each room while we took our time to savour the rich decoration and wealth of treasures in each room. We took four hours to thoroughly see the harem and the selamlik (two hours each). It could be done much quicker but we enjoyed every moment. Be prepared for lots of visitors jostling to see the same things; but by allowing plenty of time means if you have the patience you can find the lull between fellow tourists.  My only complaint is that no photography is allowed within the Palace, not even with no flash.  If your wish is to live in a decadent Palace then visit here and daydream for a while."
217,2nd best place in the city ,"See this perfectly preserved palace that epitomizes Ottoman princely living. The furniture , decor and carpets are original/restored, which really allows you to see the opulent end of the Ottoman Empire, to which the construction of this palace contributed. There is an audio tour, but we visited with our tour guide, who was able to tailor the tour to our interests and provide us with the level of detail we wanted."
218,Wonderful palace,This is a palace where the last of the Sultans of the Ottoman empire resided.  The palace is spectacular for its ornate and plush interiors and the most outstanding of all is the staircase with crystal pillars supporting the bannister. The Sultans bathing and dressing room was unique as well and outstanding for its opulence. There is an an excellent audio guide which is a must use or else you will not have access to the detail.
219,Splendid,"An amazing palace where many sultans lived with their wives and families. A huge garden surrounds the palace with an outstanding sea view. The rooms are more modern than other palaces like topkapi. The rooms are very luxe. It is not allowed to enter with your shoes, you will have to cover your shoes with bags. Not allowed to take photos and the guards keep yelling at you each time you try to take few. Very recommended. Souvenir shop with high quality items is available. I got from there the clock tower status and some sultans magnets :)"
220,Gorgeous  but too much of the same,Such a beautiful palace full of history and great pieces of art . We took the tour inside the palace and it was interesting. Loved the huge doors facing the water
221,It is grand and luxury personified.,"first of all I bought prepaid tickets with skip-the-line in order to save time. If you do like us, be there just 10 min before opening time which is 9am, and you can easily buy the tickets at the ticket store without the queue. The audio guide is for free for anybody. You cannot take pictures. The palace is quite big and the sultan wanted something like the european palaces, he got it but it is even too much of everything inside. Than you see many rooms, all with chairs, tables and chandeliers, therefore after 5-6 in my opinion you have enough. There are some big rooms which are really impressive. You can buy a ticket just for the palace or palace + harem. When you go out from the palace tour, there are signes to reach the harem, which looks like a smaller palace, again full of rooms with tables and chairs and some bedrooms. To be honest it is impressive but, being european, to me it is also kitch and a little boring"
222,So beautiful,"For the size of this palace, it is extremely well conserved. Tours are very organized: there are indicators everywhere, and you can even get an English interactive audio tour for free (a little device with headphones -- recomend bringing your own headphones). Luxury is all over this place: from the most expensive Turkish carpets to beautiful ceiling and jewelry."
223,Amazing design and views,"The extravagant and beautiful Dolmabahce palace is definitely worth a visit. The exterior has gardens, fountains and beautiful views. The palace has offices, ceremonial halls, beautiful staircases and more. The ticket for the Harem section is an additional fee but worth it. This has the living quarters for the Sultan, his wives and mother.Attaturk also lived here later and you can view the room where he passed away. There is a free audio tour ( very informative) included with the ticket but there is a cash deposit or passport deposit required. I opted for the cash deposit  although many people had bought their passports."
224,Stunning palace worth a visit to see how the other half lived!,Dolma bahcha was the main administrator of the ottomans sultans from 1850 until 1920..Very huge....
225,Palace Delight,"This spectacular palace on the Bosphorus straits is a must. Built in the 19th century it is a wonderful example of baroque, roccoco and neo classical styles with opulent furnishings providing an insight into the lives of the sultans that lived there.There are spectacular chandeliers in the rooms, now electrified but it must have been a huge job when the palace was lit with candles; beautiful rugs and furniture. It is well organized to walk through the many rooms.  No photography is allowed in the palace. Also visit the harem set apart from the main palace which gives an insight into how the sultan's wives lived. The gardens are beautiful and very well maintained.  A great visit."
226,Surreal,We took the ferry from Eminonu to Besiktas so that we could get the views of the palace from the sea and certainly were not disappointed. The Palace complex is vast and the headphone guided tour gives a great insight of the life of the sultans that resided there as well as the working life of the kitchens and harem. The artefacts on display are amazing but be warned photography and filming is not allowed it some areas - do not be tempted to try even if others are.
227,Incredible palace and crystal everywhere ,"A magnificent and mesmerising masterpiece. The haram is extremely luxurious. Everything is well maintained by the Turkish government. It takes almost a whole day if you really want to know about it. Best thing, you will get an audio support free of cost. Don't miss to visit."
228,Great day out to learn about the life of the Sultans,"Intersting visit to the Dolabahce palace the last palace of the ottoman empire. You can see the bedroom that Atuturk died, the harem and the fixtures and decoration of a palace which were decorated about one hundred years ago"
229,The lifestyle we all deserve! ,"Beautiful palace, visitors have access to some sections inside which are certain to dazzle you. The rooms, furniture, art etc. are in mint condition. The audio guide works very well and gives you a good perspective of what you see inside the palace. It's such an amazing structure, so well kept. You can spend about an hour easily checking out the palace from inside. If you are into architecture then maybe two hours. It's a nice place to visit if you have some free time at hand."
230,Gorgeous palace,"it is about 2 blocks from the tram Tophane stop. when you exit the tram keep the water on your right and walk about 2 blocks. I arrived about 9:20 and got right in. Bypass All of the tour groups and on the left is the ticket office. after getting your ticket go to the entrance and get your shoe cover and enter, again bypass the tour groups standing around. Inside no pictures are allowed but I saw numerous people taking pictures when the employees were out of sight. Outside pictures are allowed and it is reminiscent of Versailles. Inside you feel very small due to the height of the ceilings and doors. it is an ornate look into history. I highly  recommend visiting even though it is not on many tours."
231,it looks a copy of european palaces,"The magnificent grounds, fountains, exterior and waterfront setting on the Golden Horn are certainly remarkable. But inside, it gets even better. Almost all the ground and first floor rooms seem to be open and full of the original furniture and art work. The chandeliers alone are jaw-dropping. Get there early! The short security screening line-up belied the hour-long wait for entry, as this is limited depending on the number of visitors to the palace at any one time to preserve it."
232,Vast and beautiful ,"Unfortunately, we couldn't enjoy this marvelous sample of decorative arts as well as we hoped (too many occasional visitors aso). But the impact still stands, regarding rhis wonderful building, mixing the civilizations and cultures."
233,Catch a glimpse into the magnificent wealth of the Ottoman Empire,My guide was amazing.  He pointed out all of the beautiful features of this amazing palace.  Thoroughly enjoyed this visit!
234,Awful Place,The palace is very well preserved. The walkways are well designed to follow a clear journey through the vast building. Rooms have very diverse and rich decorations. It‚Äôs very interesting to see a wide variety of room uses - one wonders how can a residence probably have so many different spaces but in the end it all makes sense.  The location by the sea adds an extra layer of beauty.  Enjoyable.
235,Glamorous palace and beautiful view on the sea,"Dolmabahce palace is a response of Ottoman empire to the Austrian and French for a grand palace similar to Versailles in Paris or Schonbrunn in Viena. Built in 19th century by Sultan Abdulmecid with Baroque style, the inside is similar to the palaces in Europe. Interior from chandeliers, furniture and everything is imported from Italy, France, and UK. Just for the advice, no need a private guide in this place since visitor has to use audio guide for the guide. A must visit place in Turkey."
236,Disappointing really.,"It took me about an hour and a half to go around the palace. I was lucky that there was less tourist crowd when I visited at around 2 pm weekday. In the main palace, once has to wear plastic to cover shoes nd taking pictures inside the palace is not allowed. Make sure to get your free audio guide before you start your tour of the palace and you will be needing to surrender an ID. The rich culture and history of Turkey are explained when one goes from one station after the other. It was reallly nice that they were able to preserve their rich collection of antiques and paintings."
237,Amazing place ,"Beautiful palace providing the visitor with an accurate idea of a Sultan‚Äôs life, nearby the Bosphorus. The tour on itself culminates in a very impressive room."
238,"Great palace, beatiful gardens and must see Harem",Took the metro from Sutanahmet. Only 5mins walk from stop. This Palace us well worth a visit. Around ‚Ç¨16 entrance fee but you can upgrade your ticket to view the Harem. (worth it) The Palace grounds are stunning as is the Palace itself. There are coffee shops in the grounds as well as an interesting clock museum. Definitely take the time out to visist this amazing place.
239,Grande,"This place is breathtaking. Inside of the object- so luxurious and beautiful. Outside too. Simply, amazing."
240,A priority to visit,An amazing palace in terms of both grandeur and scale. The Harem wasn‚Äôt open but the main palace was very interesting. We got there shortly before it opened and joined short queues for security and tickets - even so the palace was quite busy. Sensibly they don‚Äôt allow photography inside which keeps people looking and walking rather than posing!
241,Breath taking palace,"Built in the mid-1800s this palace was ordered to be built by Sultan Abdulmecid I and took 13 years to complete.  It was 90 Lira to enter the Dolmabahce Palace.  The place was grand, beautiful rooms within the large palace, remember to look up at the impressive ceiling art work.  Ensure you spend enough time here to enjoy it, and include the harem apartments as well."
242,Beautiful grounds,"this palace was the most interesting landmark to visit. enchanted place, the galleries, furniture, Crystal chandeliers, carpets are just amazing.pay attention to the central heating setup as well as the design of the heaters in each room."
243,A pleasant tour in this beautiful and historical palace,"I‚Äôm so in love with Dolmabahce. It may not have the grandiose of palaces like Versailles but it‚Äôs simplicity makes it unique. It has a sense of peace that I cannot explain. Make sure to end your visit with a cup of coffee in the garden facing the Bosphorus, absolutely fantastic. Can‚Äôt wait to go again"
244,Exquisite  Place,"a european style palace built in the mid 19th century to rejuvenate the fading image of the empire. very oppolent with its european furniture, baccarat crystal banisters, gold, silver and glass combinations.ticket line would be long and slow visit it either early or around 3 pm"
245,Beautiful palace worth a visit,"This is a beautiful palace of monumental size. The rooms that showcase the personal items (porcelain, china, glassware, etc) used by the occupants of the palace are of a quality and craftsmanship like I have seen in no museum before. It was astonishing to see the craftsmanship and art. Beautiful palace inside and out."
246,Stunning!,"WOW, just WOW.... PLEASE don't miss visiting Dolmabahce Palace. You are not allowed to take pictures inside so we can't show you the inside but PLEASE take our WORD and visit it, you WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY when you will visit it.Ticket price for Official Part & Harem is combined price: TL 90 (USD 15.50 or EUR 14.20). Separate prices are TL 60 and TL 40 respectively. Take the combined one.I was planning to skip it but on our last day, we didn't have anything to do so we decided to give it a shot and we are glad to make that decision.Topkapi Palace was good but this Palace is AWESOME!!!!!If any Palace can rival Versailles Palace, then it is Dolmabahce Palace.It is truly Opulent, Magnificient and it will leave you in AWE!!!"
247,A masterpiece of beaux-arts,"This palace is mind blowing in terms of size and beauty.  Numbers can be limited at busy times. The audio guide was incredibly informative and easy to use. The wealth of the ottoman sultans is unimaginable.  Took a whole day for the visit. Some criticism, the cafe staff are very grumpy. The toilets leave a lot to be desired in terms of numbers and cleanliness. The palace is so so beautiful"
248,Here you can feel the encient Istanbul,A few hours are never enough. Hundreds of details. Thousands of stories ...Dolmabah√ße palace takes you to a completely different world with its charming atmosphere.
249,Well worth the trip,The audio guide is free and very informative. The grounds are stunning and I would recommend taking your time here and seeing the harem and the whole palace grounds. To really understand the insane wealth of the Ottoman Empire nothing really explained it better to me than to see this Istanbul palace.
250,A typical French influenced palace,"You can get there with the tram and then after a short walk , you are in the  courtyard of the palace . Inside , you can admire a lot of interesting items with historical value .Don't miss it !"
251,nice nice nice,"Fascinating and stunning palace, well worth the visit. The ticket price is split into the main palace and the Harem and doesn‚Äôt include the art gallery within the grounds which is frustrating but seemingly common in Istanbul tourist attractions.The site on the Bosphorus is superb.Not to be missed."
252,Fantastƒçno,"A more western and magnificent palace in Turkey1. As the largest palace in Turkey, the Dolmabah√ße Palace is the largest palace in turkey and probably the most contemporary and modern palace comparing to Topkapi palace.2. While the building is influenced by western architect, it also retains some turkish architecture style. For example,there is a mosque inside the palace. 3. No matter what architecture style the palace has adopted, it is just absolutely magnificent in the interior and exterior. 4. Though photography is not allowed inside, remember to bring your camera and take pictures in its exterior. It is worth taking, You can also see beautiful views across the island."
253,Beautiful ,It is important for Ottomans last years and Turkish Republic's firts part. Founder and hero of Turkey Atat√ºrk was lost his life there. You can breathe these years. It has luxury and a great see view.
254,Cristal Glasses,"The visit to the palace include the palace itself, beautiful gardens and stunning view to the Bosporus. Very interesting place to visit, has also an audio guide."
255,Amazingly beautiful,"Dolmabahce Palace is absolutely stunning, both in location and in the beauty of the structure. The French architecture is awe inspiring, as are the beautiful artefacts like vases and stools and chandeliers inside the Palace. I absolutely enjoyed my visit here."
256,Far exceeded my expectations,Words cant describe how beautiful this palace is its very hostorical place with great art hand craft high ceiling with mind blowing big rooms with antique gold plated furniture just awesome
257,Beauty,"Wow! What a drop dead gorgeous palace!!! Simply breathtaking! Especially the Grand Ballrooms of the Sultan. From exploring this palace, it seems to me that the Sultan's mother had a very prominent role in Turkish society judging by her expansive and lavish living quarters/apartments; more than the Sultan's wife/Queen. I'm really glad I went before opening time, so I was one of the first people to get in, (the 3rd actually). Was able to explore the place in just under 2 hours, though I rushed a bit. The lines to get in are crazy here. There were like 3 tourist groups from Japan, 2 groups from South Korea and 1 from China. By the time I was leaving, tourist buses had filled up the entire parking lot, and lines had snaked round the whole building, so quite glad I avoided the rush. Highly recommended, even though Topkapi Palace tops my list for must see places in Istanbul. Dolmabanche Palace is more glitz and glamour, but Topkapi is more historical and educational."
258,Museum ,"majestic and worth a visit. we enjoyed the Harem side of the castle the most, as well as the coffee shop by the sea."
259,Cant Miss,This place was incredible. Every single room here was amazing and every detail was not left unnoticed. You need to go here when in Istanbul. This place will blow you away.
260,Tour,"Historical  place , good architecture , restaurants , parks ,gardens , shoping centers  around ,good environment"
261,Outstanding!!,"Ayia Sofia church, Basilica cisterna, and then Dolmabahce Palace are the 3 places tha you have to visit. Excelent like a Europian palace for sure an Europian architecht have make it."
262,beautiful palace,"This is an outstanding palace which shows off the fine craftsmanship enjoyed by the sultans. The crystal chandeliers, staircase and candelabra from England were a highlight.  The gardens and the palace‚Äôs position alongside the Bosporus is also fab. The audio tour which is covered by your entry fee is very good. The T1 tram terminates a 10 min walk from the entrance. Allow 1.5 to 2 hours for the visit."
263,Worth the visit,"Very nice historical place , Beautiful gardens ,Huge palace need a few hours to see all places , price ticket different depend on how many building to see & it will be lessprice if choose combined ticket ."
264,Dolmabache ,The collection of period furniture and art effects is impresive.  The audio guide make is easy to follow and understand the life in the palace. I would not miss. It.
265,Spectacular!!!,"Absolutely beautiful. One of the last great palaces of the Ottoman empire. So huge and opulent, you can see why it bankrupted the Ottomans!"
266,Turkish Baroque masterpiece,"Dolmabahce Palace built in 19 th century is one of the most glamorous palaces in the world. You just to Go Early with our private guided tour we went at 9 before all the big groups we had zje entire rooms all for ours elf  . also during the weekday. Things I enjoyed in the palace : the crystal staircase - glamourous ...amazing , The Sultan's marble hammam is incredible with see views through the windows.The Harem are the rooms where Atat√ºrk passed away"
267,Vast and beautiful ,"Fabulously ornate palace, oozing with opulence.  Must have cost immense fortune to build in the mid-1800s; impossible in today's world.  Beautiful from all angles, including from boat on the Bosphorus."
268,Excellent architecture ,Spectacular ottoman palace situated in the best place of Istanbul along Bosporus. Interesting building from architectural aspect with amazing views
269,Sultan's palace with stunning European architecture,"Extravagance, opulence and lots of history. A palace where time has literally stood still. Six sultans and a president resided there at different times in history. It is one of the biggest and most extravagant Palace with the biggest chandeliers and gold gilded ceilings. I do recommend that one takes a form of ID (passport or driving licence) with them or will need to pay a returnable 200 TL for the modern touch-phone which is used to direct you around the palace. It‚Äôs very informative and much enjoyed by the kids, so there‚Äôs no need for a guide. On the way to the Harems‚Äô section you will see a click museum and a wonderful little farm with swans, chickens, peacocks and waterfountains. Outside the Harems‚Äô section there is a small cafe area before visiting the Arts museum.As you leave the palace, there are 2 cafes side by side by the Bosphorus, one on the grounds, where you will see 2 large iconic canons similar to those used in the siege of Constantinople, and the other Milli Saraylar cafe outside by the beautiful Dolmabah√ße Cami/mosque. So much to see you‚Äôll need at least 3 hours comfortably to take in all the beauty and hear all the stories."
270,"So beautiful,so big,so time consuming","The Dolmabah√ße Palace is the most spectacular of the symbolic structures of the Ottoman Empire's transformed identity in the 19th century. The palace is structurally divided into sections and we could visit all of them. The southern wing is reserved for the men and contains the public representation rooms; the northern wing - (the Harem)- served as the private residential area for the Sultan and his family. The two functional areas are separated by a big ceremonial hall and a high dome.  In both sections, each of the halls had a colour theme. Everything in this palace spells opulence and grandeur. The palace overlooks the Bosphorous providng breathtakingly beautiful views of the strait. Flash photography not allowed. But carry a good camera to click pictures in the frontside and Bosphorous side of this palace.There is a good cafe in the back side. Toilets are squat-style.On a trip to Istanbul, I would highly recommended visiting this place."
271,A place to see. History is summarized here,One of the most grand Ottoman era structures open for public. Both the Harem and the official palace are worth visiting
272,The staff needs to be trained,"A luxurious, spacious, historic Palace with great furniture, rugs and art from all over the world. Perfect!"
273,Amazing place,Lovely gardens and amazingly stunning rooms.  well worth the visit to see the glamours rooms so elegantly adorned.
274,Beautiful palace..,So huge and amazing. A great place to spend a few hours and enjoy the views of Bosphorus and the luxury of the palace.
275,Absolutely stunning,"The palace itself is worth visiting, if only for views of the magnificent sea gates and palace facades. The audioguide is worth listening to, and the harem section of the tour does an excellent job of showcasing more intimate sections of the palace. There is no photography allowed in much of the palace- a shame as the salons and crystal staircase are amazing works of art- and visitors must wear shoe covers that were slippery on the carpets. Definitely a must-see, and easy to reach by public transport."
276,Amazing,"The Highlight of the visit is the ceremonial hall, with the heavy Chandelier presented by Queen Victoria to the Sultans, the ceremonial hall is awe inspiring complete with 3D effect paintings, it is very ornate and one can look at it for hours, outer restoration is not good and it looks very modern and neo. however banquet halls, ceremonial halls are very good, all in all pretty interesting and worth a visit"
277,The most beautiful place in Istanbul (for me),"Opulent palace full of amazing chandeliers and glass, beautiful staircases and grand rooms. Worth seeing to get a sense of a later era than topkapi. Free audio guide. On the downside the toilets were dirty when we were there, it is expensive at 120TL per person (about 17.50) for the palace/harem ticket and not covered by the museum pass. When we arrived we were told it was open until 5, but when we went to visit the harem we were told we couldn‚Äôt get in as it was half 4. No warning of this when we bought the ticket and when we asked for a refund on the unused part of the ticket given that they wouldn‚Äôt let us in for a quick walk around, we were told we couldn‚Äôt get one as the ticket office was closed. Felt a little ripped off. No photos allowed inside and it is hard to understand why they don‚Äôt allow non-flash photography like other sites."
278,My visit,"Visited Turkey in early March, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.  At that time, the virus had not spread to Turkey yet so there was no screening or mask requirements.Visited Dolmabahce Palace in early March.  The palace is beautiful but photos are not allowed inside due to visitor flow control, so I was told.  For this, I give it an average rating.  Photos are allowed outside.Recommend to visit once, but I will not return due to the stupid photo restrictions."
279,New Palace,"This luxurious palace is on the bank of bosphorus strait .At first, we enter the admission gate , tge clock tower in luxurious style is the first object ,catching my attention. It's built in European style ,then we walk pass the fountain and the garden . Main building is not allowed for taking photos inside it's interiorly decorated with glassware , stoneware from famous european manufacturers.it takes 40-45minutes to see/watch/inspire grandeur, fabulous life of Sultan at that time."
280,Interesting site- but no photography,"It is a historical palace built year 1843. Its architect and 45000 meter square construction on a 110000 meter square land is glamorous. It lies directly at the side of the Bosphor. You need a whole day to explore it. But take care you have to wait in line to buy your ticket and sometime the ticket window closes if the visitors exceed the number that is allowed per day. For those who like to visit historical landmarks  ,  this is the right plaice. It has a coffee shop before you enter by the seaside where you can take your break and have your cold drinks, coffees and desserts after your visit."
281,worth seeing but save your money re Harem building,"Gorgeous palace with a beautiful garden. Contains several parts such as the main palace, harem, painting museum, etc. some of which are not included in the ticket, so pay attention to that. No photos inside, but you can take photos in the garden."
282,The palace is as all the palaces in West Europe. It worth to visit it. It is nice to go there by boat.,"Sultan's palace with harem building, ticket  price for visit this 90 turkish lira per person. Usual palace, will not surprise you if you have been in english, portuguese, russian, swedish or spanish royal palaces.Harem not interesting, includes some rooms for sultan's wifes. We can visit just sultan palace and it will enough, tucket price for sultan palace just 60 tl"
283,MUST VISIT,"One of Istanbul‚Äôs highlights, the palace is located in the Besiktas district. Built around mid 1800s, this palace is enormous! No cameras are allowed inside but you can take pics outside the perimeters and the garden. You have to wear one of those plastic booties on your footwear. (Yes they recycle.) There is a fee to enter. I bought a package tour at the airport with the entry/admission fee included. If you go on your own, it looks like it would cost more. The inside can take a few hours to tour. The path and foot traffic are well coordinated and marked leading you from entrance to exit in a flowing manner. There are impressive chandeliers and authentic Turkish d√©cor to make you awe. There is an audio device that you can use for orientation and to listen to the story and history, free upon request. Outside, there are about 16 of the gates to the right overlooking the waters. Learn some history. I believe this is also called Alem Validen Mosque."
284,Stunning,Wonderful place to visit. We have visited palace and garden. There is beatiful view from garden. It worth to visit and take great photos.
285,Classy ,"On the banks of the Bosphorus, the palace presents a curious mixture of styles. Already in 1700s the Ottomans discovered European architecture and art, these exchanges intensified in the 1800s: the designers of this period were therefore inspired by the Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical.The palace was built in the mid-nineteenth century, in the last period of an Ottoman empire in serious economic crisis: the then sultan spent a fortune to dare visitors to the illusion of a still prosperous empire.It is a huge complex that contains 285 rooms, 4 large living rooms, 6 galleries, 5 main staircases, 6 Turkish baths and 43 lavatories.The interior decorations are the work of French and Italian artisans, with ample use of gold (45 tons) and silver, as well as glass, especially in the winter garden: Camli Kosk.The chandelier in the Throne Room is the largest in Europe, with 750 lamps, weighing 4.5 tons.Easily accessible from the center (surface T1, get off at the Kabatas terminus); for reasons of security and conservation of the building, the number of visitors is limited to 3000 people per day, a limit frequently reached. Prepare for long queues at the ticket office."
286,Must see Ottoman Palace ,"Dolmabahce is really beautiful. And the location is just perfect. You can see the Bosphorus in all its glory from one side of the building and bustling new city of Istanbul (Taksim area) from the other side. The architecture of Dolmabahce is an amalgamation of old and new style of Turkish architecture and that's what makes it so beautiful and grand.The entry fees for Dolmabahce is 60 Lira for the main museum and another 40 Lira for Harem (the living quarters). You can club these for 90 Lira special price. This museum is not included in Istanbul or Turkey museum cards.Reaching here is fairly simple. If you are staying in Taksim area then you can simply walk here. It's around 2 Kms from Taksim square and it's a flat walk. You can also opt for tram or public bus. Kabatas is the nearest tram station and it's a 500 meters walk from there.Do not forget to opt for free audio guide in the museum. You will have to submit one of your identity proofs as a security for the audio player. You will get it back on your way . out when you submit the player back.As soon as you enter the palace, you will be greeted by main hall. The aura of this place will simply blow your mind. It's really majestic and beautiful. As you move through the huge wooden doors and peek into different rooms on the way, you will realize what wealth really is. There are also some day to day artifacts from Sultan's time on display here. Even though I have seen my fair share of forts and palaces in India, the difference in style of architecture and the general life depicted through daily use things is very different and interesting.You can easily spend around 2-3 hours here even if you simply stroll your way to the palace. It's that big. If you have interest in history and want to examine everything closely it would certainly take 4-5 hours to do the tour."
287,Beautiful Place,"The Dolmabahce Palace is a beautiful royal palace by the shore, right next to the Kabatas tram stop.It is exceedingly beautiful, and the style is more western than oriental- proving that this late ottoman palace is exceptional. It is said that the great chandelier was provided to the palace by none other than Queen Victoria.If you are muslim, there is also a small palace mosque in front of the clock tower."
288,Very European palace,"The crystal chandeliers, the serving pieces, the room decor all scream extreme wealth among the late sultans of the Ottoman Empire."
289,Splendor of another time,"Dolamabahce Palace is right on the Bosphorus coast. You can get there by tram T1 at the last stop and take a little walk. I recommend arriving early in the morning as there is no crowd then  .Visits to the sites are organized in groups with a museum guide. In every part of the palace you enjoy the luxury, but the need for renovation can be seen in some places. The parks are beautiful and you can stay there as you wish. There are enough benches. .The view of the Bosphorus is indescribable"
290,Amazing,"The palace is situated in the Be≈üikta≈ü district on the European side. it was built in the 19th Century and was the administrative center and the last of the sultans resided here. The display of Roccoco Baroque, and neo classical styles is well displayed.The visit to the palace was 90TL including the palace and the Harem rooms The fare include the auto guided headphones which tells you  the historic facts of the palace.It is well maintained with most of the chandeliers and the furniture in every room intact.There was a Nice clock tower and a nice sitting place around.It was a nice vist."
291,A grand palace,"This was absolutely mesmerizing in its craftsmanship , design , painting and structure. A level of opulence befitting a true Sultan . A must see for its history and location. especially with the gates and door step to the sea."
292,Dolmabah√ße Palace ,"Beautifully appointed exterior and artfully curated interior. The palace is situated directly on the coast of the Bosphorus and allows for beautiful strolls along the grounds (Which are extensive). While there are long lines to get it, it is truly a must-see. :)"
293,Marvellous Marvel.,"Administrative center of the Ottoman Empire in 1856, located along the European shore of the Bosphorus Strait (in Kabatash)."
294,Extravagant Palace,"Dolmabah√ße Palace is a jewel palace in Istambul. Located at the left side of the Bosphorus (going towards the Black Sea). The external part of the palace is magnificent, with its whitish construction and intrincated architecture. The interior of the palace is a dazzle art, with magnificent rooms, fine forniture and chandeliers and a lot of history."
295,History ,"Dolmabah√ße Palace is on the European side of the Bosphorus, about 4 km northeast of Topkapi Palace.  By order of the 31st Ottoman Sultan, Abd√ºlmecid I, it was built in  1843 to 1856.  The Sultan and his family had lived at the medieval Topkapƒ± Palace, but Abd√ºlmecid wanted a residence comparable to those of his contemporary European monarchs.   The former Be≈üikta≈ü Sahil Palace was demolished and replaced by a sprawling palace complex facing  the Bosporus, surrounded by well-tended gardens, splashing fountains and graceful walkways.  The architecture is stunning, with elements from the Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical styles, blended with traditional Ottoman architecture.    The palace consists of three parts the Muayede Salonu (the ceremonial hall), the Mabeyn-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn (or Selamlƒ±k, the men‚Äôs quarters), and the Harem-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn (the residential apartments of the Sultan‚Äôs family). The crystal staircase, in the shape of a double horse shoe, is particularly noteworthy.  The ceremonial hall contains a crystal chandelier claimed to be the largest in the world, and the parquet floors in the dining hall are exquisite.  The palace also has a large number of Hereke Carpets, and an impressive collection of paintings.   Dolmabah√ße was home to six Sultans from 1856 until the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924, and was the main administrative building of the Ottoman Empire from 1956 to 1922.  Mustafa Kamal Ataturk died here on the 10th of November 1938.   The palace was subsequently converted into a museum; it contains 46 halls, 6 baths, 68 toilets and 285 rooms, although not all are open to the public.   Dolmabahce Palace is open from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm most days, but is closed on Mondays and Thursdays.  There is an entry fee of 40 TL for the palace, 30 TL for the harem or 60 TL combined (students 5 TL for each place, and children are free).  There can be long lines; early morning is generally less crowded (only 3000 visitors per day are allowed, to preserve the visiting experience).  I took an audio tour (in English) during my visit, which greatly enhanced my experience (it was free, but I had to leave my passport to ensure return of the audio device).  There is a cafe within the palace grounds, as well as public toilets."
296,The jewel of Istanbul ,"The Ottoman sultans shifted from Topkapi Palace to the newly built Dolmabahce Palace in the 1850s. It was designed by the renowned Armenian architect Karabet Balian and his son Nikogos, while the interiors were done by the French decorator Charles Sechan. The building is magnificent, especially the ceremonial hall with its famous Bohemian crystal chandelier glowing with 750 lamps, gifted by Queen Victoria. Indian tourists who visit Dolmabahce Palace might be reminded of the palaces of Maharajas of Vadodara, Mysore and Gwalior, which date back to the same era. There is a small, but attractive garden around the buildings, with magnificent magnolias and little ponds with water lilies. Flocks of partridges roam freely. There are excellent views of the sea from the garden.The interiors are fairly well-preserved and many of the personal belongings of the sultans and their families on display. Unfortunately, they do not permit photography inside.The palace is broadly divided into two sections: the public and the private (known as the Selamlik and the Harem respectively). You need to buy separate tickets to enter each of them. We, a family of three, had booked tickets on a conducted tour, which took us only to the Harem portion. We had neither the time nor the inclination to visit the other portion, though our guidebook recommends Selamlik over the Harem.A special feature of this palace is the tastefully furnished chamber where Kemal Pasha Ataturk, the first President of modern Turkey, breathed his last in 1938. The furniture is carefully preserved and the clocks in the room are stopped at 0905, the instant of his death."
297,Must see,"Dolmabah√ße Palace was built towards the end of the Ottoman empire in the mid 1800s. Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I commissioned the construction to replace the medieval Topkapi Palace for his family after seeing the more modern, luxurious and comfortable palaces of his contemporary European monarchs. No expense was spared in this new palace which boasts 285 rooms, 131 handmade Hereke silk carpets, running water for the 68 water-closets imported from Great Britain and 6 Turkish baths, gas lighting and a 750 bulb, 4.5 ton crystal chandelier, the largest in the world. A stunning fourteen tons of gold were used to decorate the ceilings.  The construction cost was five million Ottoman gold lira, or approximately $1.5 billion in today's dollars. Unfortunately, it was built as the Ottoman fortunes were declining. This put additional strain on the financial well being of the declining Ottoman Empire.  Today, it is an amazing palace to visit. The architecture combines elements of Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical European design with Ottoman elements. It is the largest palace in Turkey.  It has the traditional elements of the men's quarters (Mabeyn-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn, or Selamlƒ±k) in one wing and the private family quarters (Harem-i H√ºm√¢y√ªn, the Harem) in a different wing separated by a ceremonial hall. It was interesting to visit Topkapƒ± Palace and Dolmabah√ße Palace back to back to contrast the beginnings and end of the Ottoman Empire. Topkapi is more spread out and decorated extensively with Iznik tiles and classical Ottoman carvings.  Dolmabah√ße Palace could be called the ""Crystal Palace"" as it has the largest collection of Baccarat and Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the world. It even has a double horseshoe staircase with Baccarat crystal balusters in the staircase. Unlike many European palaces, this palace could be accessed by land or sea.After the establishment of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk used the palace as a presidential residence in the summers. He died in the palace on November 10, 1938. The clock in the bedroom where he died is still set to 9:05, his time of death. This was an amazing place to visit. The palace, gardens and even collection of china and paintings were so beautiful. Most of the original furniture is also on display. We took a private tour with Ensar from Istanbulday to really maximize our understanding, but there are group tours available in several language."
298,astonishing. takes you back to the Ottoman's time.,Please be careful which ticket you buy. There is 40 Lira and 90 Lira. Buy 90 Lira for a full experience. Pictures not allowed inside but lot of history and nicely preserved.The pictures of bhosporous from one side are a must.
299,Must to visit,"Dolmabache located in the¬†Be≈üikta≈ü¬†district of¬†Istanbul,¬†Turkey, on the¬†European¬†coast of the Strait of Istanbul, served as the main administrative center of the¬†Ottoman Empire¬†from 1856 to 1887 and from 1909 to 1922 (Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace¬†was used in the interim period)."
