0,A wow..,Went there to see sunrise and later came to know from other tourist not to miss the first ray of sun on the everest.Wow what a view we had..The everest looks so beautiful from there light pink and gradually red and blue and white...
1,Incredible,Nice place to see the sunrise.Go early for sunrise but depend on whether is cloudy and rainy cant see sunrise
2,"Unless you are advised that you will see the views, do not bother.",rising sun are looking just good and for seeing it we want to go from hotel at 4 o clock to see the orange view of Kanchenjunga peak at the time of rising sun
3,amazing and cool.,"Great place for day hike, sunrise and sunset. Don’t take the car, hike up from walking path. Sunset is better then sunrise."
4,Amazing view at Sunrise,"Its a small hill, we went to see sun rise there around 5 AM. You need to wear good jacket with a cap as it will be cool in the morning."
5,Advice,"Its a must destination for tourists.Be there to watch sunrise and beautiful changing of colours of mountain peaks at sunrise. First the mountains turn Absolute Red to Orange to golden and back to colour of snow.It is a memorable visual treat.Pls check the sunrise time and be there early as sometimes if there is heavy rush,you need to do lot of  walking leaving your vehicle far below.It is a all day destination to watch beautiful   views of Himalayas.However great views are possible if there is no mist or fog.As per locals best time is mid October to December and March to April.But they say  weather here is unpredictable .Tiger hill is at an  alttude of  8482 feet, being the highest point of Darjeeling hills and is around 12 KMs from city."
6,Dire,The place has atleast 1000 people all ready to see the sun rise. We had issues due to fog. If you stay in a hotel on the hill like Udaan Dekeberry then views from there are good as well.
7,Playback stopped,Nothing beats to get hill. Sunrise and view of mountains in the morning.. You can travel. Miles just to. See this natural wonder..
8,Unfortunately it was a very cloudy morning ,This place is best at sunrise n sunset. Paradise for photographers and romantic spot for couples.Families might enjoy but lids definitely get bored unless they are geographically interested.
9,"Amusing experience in one way, breathtaking in another","Wonderful view point for sun raise, new glass building is coming up which may help people to watch without shivering in cold weather."
10,Fantabulous Sunrise,"Tiger hill is famous for sunrise view, as on your right hand side there is sunrise hue is coming up in sky and its first rays touches Kachenjunga mountain on your left side gives you different shades. Very mesmerising view as one side is golden above horizon and below Darjeeling still in dark with glittering night lights. But for getting this experience one has to leave his bed very early in morning and lucky enough to have get crystal clear weather."
11,Sunrise,I have travelled a lots of place and seen beautiful natures. The reason saying because sun rise is very hard to witness from all places. This is a spectacular experience of life if and only if weather is with you. I was very lucky because there was not a single obstacle to see Kanchaunjanga even one local person showed me mt everest after sunrise. I would suggest not to bring people who has heart issues specially old and very little kids. Because while returning one old man got sick and they say its normal there. Best time is around march april. But again all on your luck. There are various vehicles at early morning 3.30 am from Darjeeling main junctions. Please go early as lots of crowd and if you are at back of them then cant visualize the begining beauty. Enjoy
12,Glimpse of Mount Everest,"The sky create colour patterns with beam of sunrise. This is the beauty and a must visit place for darjelling. One need to compromise morning nap however, place worth it. Starts at 4.00am from hotel and reach the place at 4.30am. Every second is worth to wait for sunrise. Pulse of colour beam created a mesmerising view of highest peak of India. People gathered here like crazy and hawkers selling winter clothes , tea coffee for your sake of interest. Do visit this sun rising point in east India."
13,Sun Rise Point,Tiger hills gives natural view and one can be lucky by viewing sunset and sunrise.We were lucky enough to take the views
14,Observatory for Sunrise and view Kanchanjunga Peak,Beautiful Kanchan janga at sunrise. Must see at morning. Golden looking mountain is amazing must see view.
15,Looks great in sun light,It is better to go early and reach before 4am to see sun rise otherwise of no use as Area become overcrowded and may be problematic for older perople and little kids as you have to walk a lot to reach sun rise view point.
16,Breathtaking and Unexplainable,"If you want to see amazing Sunrise, this is the place. You can see first rays falling on the kanchanzanga top and its amazing to see it...the mountains looks awesome from this point.. you must reach there before time because it attract loads of people. Huge crowd , you must wear warm attire. its very cold there in the morning"
17,Beautiful view of Himalayas!!,Go early and you get best view of Kanchenjanga Sunrise!!. You will be disturbed by locals selling goodies and teas. That you have to ignore it. Make sure you go early and take a camera. Best profile pics can be taken there.
18,cold,Famous for Sun rise and golden glacier view. One need to left Darjeeling city at 2-3 clock. One hour drive road from Darjeeling city. Sun rise view is depend upon weather condition.
19,Overrated!,"Excellent place to view sunrise. People start by 4 am to reach this place on time to see the sun rise. If weather permits, we can  see sunrise and a look at mount Kanchenjunga , world’s 3 rd largest peak.  Well If you are unlucky you will not be able to see anything :)   Worst…"
20,Heavenly beauty,Good place to visit during day time. Not sure about early morning visit here. Heard that this place is too crowded & freezing cold during that time. So we preferred to visit this place by 10-11 AM. It was a wise decision. No crowd at all. We have seen Mt.Kanchenjunga clearly & a portion of Mt.Everest. Yeah. Mt.Everest will be visible from here on a clear day. I was more excited to see Mt.Everest than Mt.Kanchenchunga as we can see Mt.Kanchenjunga from most of the places in Darjeeling city.Mt.Kanchenjunga slowly changes its shade (kind of light blue to yellow) slowly when Sun raises. We saw this from our hotel balcony itself. Am not so interested on sunrise.
21,The crowds spoil this experience,From this place kanchanjunga looks awesome when first red colour lift of sun spread over it . Very nice .
22,Tiger Hill Visit in the Morning,Tiger hill is all about sunrise.you can see thr morning rays of he sun striking the earth from the first time.
23,Tiger Hill,"The beauty is beyoud imagination. The first thing on to do list of Darjeeling. Rarely do you come across such natural opulence. The view that made me reflect, how beautiful is this world that we are living in ans how greatful should we be to live here. Also, we have always underestimated the beauty that India stores in its lap. We run to the foriegn shores to explore the nature. I truly feel that a lot of us have ignored the Seven Sisters that we have. It's time now that we reach out and love them more.The radiant rising sun on the carpet of clouds and the peaking Kanchunjunga Mountain Range out of that heavenly sight is an unparallel to any other sight in India. A picture speaks a thousand words so I ma attaching some breathtaking images of what amazed me."
24,Astonishing view,"Took Early morning ride (4.00 AM) to get a parking place close to view point to watch sunrise. It was indeed amazing , Howver could not see Kanchanganga Peaks or Reflection due to foggy morning , Still it is a trilling experience!"
25,Magical experience ,Tiger hills is a fantastic place to see the sunrise. Sun rises slowly covering the entire horizon with orange color and illuminates the mountain range. If there are no clouds you can witness a spectacular sunrise from here. A must visit place
26,Breathtaking View!,We were rather unfortunate as we could not see proper sunrise due to clouds.Later understood it is the situation on most of the days.U need to reach there by 5 30 to get a best place.But unfortunately this place is least developed inspite of its popularity.A nice pavilion can be built for people to comfortably sit and enjoy the sunrise.
27,Sunrise point,"One has to start very early , i.e 4 am in morning to get a better place to view , Tiger hill offers a very clear view of Mount Kanchenjunga  , but the place is crowded by tourist . common facilities like toilet etc is missing at this point."
28,Atop the Tiger Hills ,"Great experience, we should reach there latest by 4 am, then only we will get a place to view the sunrise and its reflection on Kangchenjunga. It was - 2 degrees when I went there. Truly amazing"
29,Awesome ,I have visited this hill in the early morning . You will get best view of the darjeeling and also of the sun rise. Best for trek lovers.
30,Highest point,It OMG in my life . unbelievable we see the sun a few distance.i can't remember the time like 4 am our driver called us for going to tiger hill then we ready in a few second for going to tiger hill. When we reach there then a thousand of people all ready reach there....
31,Great view of Kanchanjangha range,Very famous hill and looks very beautiful and attractive in sun light. Many touriest visit this place daily. Amazing environment.
32,"Nice view, but if you're going for the sunrise... Good luck",The locsl corporation shoukd provide shelters with roof to watch the beautiful sunrise especially in winters.
33,Alone in a crowd,Saw them for the first time in my like. I was happy like a kid.. shivering in 2 degree.. please carry enough woollen cloths so that you don’t become ice. There will be a lot of people at the location so take place facing mountains.
34,Unparalleled view of mount and sunrise ,"Though could not get the view of sunruse early morning, we could enjoy it at aroung 9 am. First time visitor should not miss it."
35,Honey moon,"Tiger Hills are really beautiful place to visit , Once in a life time experience, enjoying sunrise at morning 5 AM at 4 degree Temperature."
36,Excellent views ,The whole Darjeeling tourist world comes there. It is better to be early to get vantage viewing point. The location is rustic with no modern amenities. You can get plenty of hot coffee there for a price but tea is not very easily available
37,Experience like no other,Quite great untisipation for sunrise. At first glimpse of sunrise place becomes noise and and a bit quaotic. A lot of movement. I guess what I'm trying to say if one once to watch sunrise in piece chose another place.
38,Great sunrise & view ,"One needs to get up early in the morning and take cab to reach here before time to see the beautiful sunrise and the changing hue of mighty Kangchenjunga. In each now and then, the Kangchenjunga appears with different color based on the sunlight, and the view could be seen at your left side. In your right side, you will be amazed to see how the bight sun pops out from behind the cloud. Its a great experience all together."
39,Good spot to visit if no fog,"Tiger Hill is mainly a peak/topmost area where you have a big horizon to see sky, Mt. Kanchejugha. it is very attractive point of Darjeeling tour.Tiger hill is far from Darjeeling main town approx. 11 KM. During Sunrise changing Red color of sky is really a unique experience. when this changing red light falls on kanchenjunga's  ice layer really an awesome experience for traveller. sunrise, around 4:00 am i.e you have to left your hotel room around 3.am. you have to book your car 24hrs before. and can opt for 3 points e.g. batasia loop and Ghum monastery it cost lesser. approx 1200/- for 4-5 seater four wheeler. it may keep in mind if you being late to left your hotel you may face Road Jam, which can extend upto 30 mins. so be early. during return you normally stop at GHUM Rly. Station, which is highest station(Altitude), Darjeeling Himalayan Railway mainly very old railway and only here train runs on narrow gauge. you can opt for Ghum Railway Museum here, which is open only during joy ride passenger free of cost. it is not for road traveller.in Darjeeling sky remains  clear during  in Oct to Feb, pls plan your tour accordingly."
40,Best point of darjeeling,Tiger Hill is famous for Kanchenjunga view especially in the morning when it becomes golden and the view is mesmerizing. It is suggested to avoid monsoon days to visit Darjeeling. The best time for magnanimous view is October or November.
41,Tiger hill observatory,Too many people for one sunrise. Saw the rising sun with 2000 people. Can be managed better by the state government.
42,Tiger Hill- Darjeeling,Nice place to see the sunrise. Have to reach here by 5am to see the 5.30am sunrise. IF there are too many clouds then sunrise wont be visible.
43,Great view of sunrise and vivid colored Kanchenjunga,Friends I am telling about most interesting natural place tiger hill.1 years ago I went to this place.This place is so amazing and cool.
44,Evening view. No crowd,"Fact No. 1: Tiger Hill has tourist attraction for it being a spot to observe sunrise. It's a awesome place to do that. Alongside the entire Kanchenjunga range is open for majestic view.Fact No. 2: The time of sunrise on most days is between 5:30 to 6:30am. So anyone wanting to catch the glimpse, has to be there by 6 am. Meaning, you leave your lodging at 3:30 am if you are based at Darjeeling. (Its a lot to ask for when you are on a vacation)Fact No. 3. Your experience is entirely dependant on the clarity of the weather. The weather is clear mostly in the months between Oct and January (as told by my escort driver). We visited in the month of May and the clouds didn't let us see a ray of sunshine !! :-(Fact No. 4: The months of May and June - which are the days of maximum tourist ascent towards Darjeeling - would make you end up in huge traffic jams and loss of precious time - once you embark on the descent from the Tiger Hill. Lots of cars are parked jamming the way down from the hill. We waited 2 hours in traffic just to get down the hill. Hugely disappointing !"
45,Best view of mountain ,we need to wake up at 4am to be there at time. magical view of sunrise. but a little crowd at the end. so be there early and take your place.
46,Beautiful sunrise ,Good view for sunrise from the peaks of Kanchanjunga. Have to leave early to reach there as roads toward observatory is narrow and chances are there that you can stuck in traffic jam. Try and reach there by 4 am so that you can find good place to watch the sunrise. Road towards tiger hill is very senic.
47,Sunrise never witnessed like this,"It is where people flock in the morning as early as 4 am to see the sun rise.heavily crowded,you will be stuck in traffic and need to walk.the mountain 3d highest peak glows in the morning sun with snow clad peak."
48,Phenomenal ,"Left hotel  at 4 am to reach Tiger hill at 4.30  to find about 1000 people already occupying all the vantage points  and facing   the cloud covered horizon in the direction of the mountains. Our taxi driver had already doused our excitement during our drive  saying that we would be extremely fortunate to get a view of the Kanchenzonga in this season. He also told us that more than 1500 taxis mostly SUVs would be jamming the narrow approach roads and we had to return back at once to escape the jam.Well, it took us over 2  hours to get back even though we had turned back at 5.15."
49,Best view of my kanchenjunga ,"At high altitude, you will feel amazing ride as you need to leave hotel at 4am in morning.you need to wait for 2 hrs to see sun shine. as it is very crowded. go early park your car at top location and choose best place to witness sunshine. Take heavy woolen clothes,But after 4 hours when sun will start rising you will see beauty sky is covered with red, golden light.you will see half sky in dark half in light . sun rising from mountains enlighten kanchanjunga peak at back side. and sun looks like a sphere ball  Take some coffee to comfort you cold.Please dont make any video/image as you can get the same many on tripadvisor just witness whole with bare eyes and get indulge in beauty,"
50,Well worth the climb! ,"We reached at shivering 4 am to witness the sunrise at 630 as drivers compel u owing to parking concern. The view of golden blessed mountain Kanchenjunga is a spectacle and a Midas moment to behold. The lack of facility, under construction view area with no safety, signage s are currently a big worry as I fell down owing to the half laid concrete and my leg was bad but had no help with even basic facilities"
51,Sunrise point,Green beautiful place but you have to get up very early if you want to see sunrise there.Too much rush in high tourist season and if the weather is cloudy then you can't see the sunrise.
52,Need to be lucky to have the perfect view,"Donot viait it in rainy season, it will spoil the mood, the beautiful scenerys. I went in june and it was not clear. Plz visit it in winter season"
53,Tiger hill,THE place to go to view sunrise over Kanchenjunga. Of course it is weather dependant but on a cloud free early morning you are treated to some stunning views. It's all over too quick though..!!
54,"Clear or Cloudy, Visiting Tiger Hill is a Must","Being from Mumbai, we have always witnessed sun set, but this was the 1st time we saw Sunrise & it was mesmerizing, quite chilling early morning but thoroughly enjoyed it."
55,Bad experience,Simply classic One of the India's beautiful sunrise place is tiger Hill which is quite windy as well as adventrous & have a very natural scenic & attractive veiw
56,Only go on a clear day,"Situated at top, get up at 4 and rush to the hills in your cab. Don't miss the the view of sunrise and hills all around..."
57,Amazing place to view sunrise . Great experience,"Heard the name several times since last several years. This time after visit it appeared to be illusive hill and frequently it is striking my mind to visit it again at the earliest possible. Truly it is a nice spot for every visitors and the ""SUN RISE"" is inexpressible."
58,Absolutely amazing !!! ,Tiger Hill is the place to view the amazing sunrise. but have to reach here by 5am anyhow. leave hotel by 3:30am because you can get a traffic jam in the way due to large number of tourists.
59,Surreal,A good place to view sunrise and see Mt kanchanjanga if the weather is good. This place lacks basic amenities with no proper sitting and washroom facilities.
60,hill,Tiger hill is basically a view point from where one can see the rising sun's rays fall on Mt Kanchenjunga which is a great sight. One has to be up by about 4 AM so as to reach the point before sunrise. We were fortunate as the day was quiet clear and we could experience the magnificent view.
61,Amazing,Tiger hill was a good experience. However was disappointed due to a) since people come early morning and there is a lot of rush there should br someone looking at parking. Vehicles were parked badly.b) no facilities for tourists of washrooms and so on.
62,Sunrise,Nice experience of visit to tiger hill. But we didnt went in morning as it was gery cool and was foggy.
63,Go early to see Sun Rise view,Nice place to visit especially to see the sunrise and the golden reflection over the Kanchenjunga peak. Also to feel the Chills over the top.
64,Bad Experience,"Tiger hill, the very hyper place can be visited only when there is no cloud, which is very rare as the place is always covered with a layer of white blanket. Try to go in the right season to avoid fog and mist. You need to start by 4:30 am max to witness the sunrise and see the Kanchenjunga. It would take approx. 30 mins to reach the point. Be prepared to walk uphill to the top (another 20 mins walk). From the top, you can see magnificent view.Do remember to wear warm cloths, as it be would be quite cold up there. Girls are recommended not to wear heels as it would be difficult to walk through."
65,The first light on Kanchanjangha,If you are visiting to Darjeeling then sunrise view at tiger hill is must. Though you need to leave from hotel at 4.30 am but it is every minute worth going then and watching rising Sun also the highest peaks of kanchunjunga all covering with snow. Overall a very pleasant place with lot of greenery
66,Be aware of the touts,U need to get up at 3.30 and leave by 4.30 to reach this place located on hills and ur local can driver will negotiate deadly turn and twist to reach this place . Be careful what u carry here wear proper clothes jackets mufflers hand gloves head cap and thermals . Proper shoes recommended u get heavy winds in this area. Hope and pray u get clear weather for this coz when we visited it was a bit cloudy . I get coffee and other cover up on rent but it better u get prepared. Move early to avoid block of cars on way to hill has steep walk as well.
67,Tiger Hill,The famous sunrise point has really amazing beautiful landscapes. One must come here to witness the sunrise for which this place is famous for.
68,Good,"Tiger hill, a beautiful place and a must visit place to enjoy a day, we all enjoyed lots here, cooling atmosphere"
69,The real facts - Tiger Hill!,"One of the best attraction of Darjeeling tour is Tiger Hill. To experience sunrise & golden view of Kanchenjunga, you have to reach too early (around 4am) at Tiger Hill. The weather is too cold so heavy woolen costume is mandatory. It's a speechless & ultimate experience for us..."
70,Awesome location ,A place where we can see the beauty of Sunrise and it's reflection on Kanchenjunga. We waited for 2hrs to witness the beauty.We need to reach early so that we can get the best spot. Temperature was as low as 2 degree..
71,Good place to visit in the morning ,You have to reach there by 4AM for the best views. It gets very crowded as its a major attraction for all tourists visiting Darjeeling year round!
72,Tiger hill,Very cloudy morning so we barley seen the sun behind the clouds. I would omagine its an excellent view point for Hymalayas and the country side. Journey was comfortable with our driver for the dsy. Need to get an entry token . Several hackers selling warm clothing ang hot sugary coffee.
73,Must see! Gorgeous sunrise.,it is good place to see kanchanjunga hill in early morning (if you are lucky). Better to take extra things to cover yourself and avoid of chilling winds there in the morning for sunrise.
74,To enjoy sunrise on the himalayan mountains,Tiger Hill is famous for watching Sunrise. It is very beautiful place and can be reached by hiring a car from Darjeeling market.
75,Great Sunrise trip,"First rays of sun falling on Tiger hill that sight is beyond words its surreal. With every falling ray snow covered mountain changes color from Red, Orange ,off-white and at the same time sun coming out from mountains like a beautiful bright color ball that spreads beautiful light and positive energy. The road to hill is very small and mornings are really chaotic with thousands of tourists visiting in Txais. No proper stands for taxis no other mode of commute . There is no observatory deck  and hence to get clear view you need to be there early so that you can catch glimpse of rising sun. There was some construction going on which locals informed is observatory deck . Not sure if that's ready yet . Mornings are really really cold as you would expect near Himalayan range . So if you plan to visit in winters or early summer ensure you have put on .enough warm clothes ."
76,Lazy Drivers. Badly managed. No Public ameneties.,Early morning 4:30 in tiger hills. Just half hr walkable distance from our hotel. Best scenic view of kanchanganja peak. അടിപൊളി
77,Worst experience...badly managed,"It was beautiful watching the sunrise from the Tiger Hill. The first ray of sun struck the mount Kanchanjangha and started the beautiful day with a huge smile on the entire nature around. Though, it was crowdy there at the sunrise, but still it was a beautiful experience all together."
78,Did not see the sunrise ,Awesome view of kanchenjungha.You have to reach quite early in the morning.You have to take booking of cab one day prior to the visit.
79,Early birds get treat,This the is lifetime experience if you happen to visit this place at 5.30am in the morning and by around 5.45 to 6.15 you can experience the golden line which forms on the other end of mountain and this Silver mountain will arise in front of you .... There is no words to explain until experienced...
80,Wonderful View point ,"You have to start early (4am preferably) if you want to witness beautiful Sun Rise over Kanchanjangha Range. If you are lucky, the visibility will be enough to witness peek of Mouth Everast !"
81,Over hyped place with lot of uncertainty,"Bad weather , nothing see. And stuck.in traffic 2 hr while.return. please.check weather conditions before going otherwis"
82,Tiger Hill,"For visiting tiger hill you need to get up early in morning and have to be lucky to have clear weather,the climate changes fast. You have to position yourself at height and wait for the sunrise .the first Ray of sunshine on tiger hill is a memorable moments."
83,"5/10, will not miss much.","Tiger Hill is a very popular point to view the sunrise among the majestic Himalayas in Darjeeling. The sunrise was around 4.57 AM and one has to leave Darjeeling by 4 am to catch the sunrise. The roads are poor and the traffic management is absolutely nil. In peak tourist season like May, you may have to walk more than 1.5 km from the parking spot due to the rush, The actual viewing spot itself is in bad shape with broken railings and garbage all around. There is no control on the crowds and it can be really frustrating if you want to have a personal pic. the Sunrise event was a great scene and to see the Sun coming out as a small peck and grow into a full circle was a brilliant viewing experience !! However, it started raining soon and then due to the traffic mismanagement we were stuck there for 45 min. Go if you have patience to view the sunrise in spite of poor infra ..."
84,Waste of time,"Basically its a sun rise point but please don't go in the cloudy or rainy season, because you can't see anything in the cloudy weather. You have to wake up early in the morning at 3to4 am. It's very irritating so better to avoid it."
85,Nothing see and stuck in traffic,If you want to see a clear view of kanchenjunga from a very high altitude then this place is for you. It’s quite on a very heightened level and great for clicking pictures. It’ll be a photographers paradise if one has some photography skills. Some kinda construction was going on when i visited but still you will get to see the great view of this beautiful hill station. It is crowded in the morning to see the sunrise but it’s worth watching.
86,Lot  depends on weather and your luck,It is a very popular place in Darjeeling to see Sunrise in the morning.The hill looks very nice when sun rising start.
87,Sun rise and Kanchenjunga ....Amazing,the top most point to view the kanchenjunga mountain at the sunrise time early in the morning. you can see the clear viw of the mountain from tiger hill.
88,Great view,Its once in a life time experience. Visit Gangtok in summer because this is one of the rarest of experiences in your life. We set out very early in the morning to have Tiger hill view. You can see Mount Everest & whole range bathing in sun light. Its like a golden bracelet worn by beautiful blue sky. Never ever miss this one. You need a good guide & patience as well to achieve this one.
89,Beautiful & must visit,I went there with my family to watch the sunrise at Mt. Kanchanjungha and you get not just the best view but also the best chai there. For more reviews and Travel stories follow me on Instagram IG: @MyBohoVoyage
90,Kanchendzonga,"Tiger Hill is a decent nice scenic beauty hill about 8,000ft approx. Before going this spectacular place plz. collect detail representation of this place for affordable view the landscape and the monasteries. You could be also access to this place by jeep/car and obviously in the clear daylight. If you have foreign national friend in abroad state it's easy to comply there. You have to gotta be safe there if it is rain. Remember drink plenty of water/juice to avoid altitude sickness. You may conduct also family moments within family ties there very well bcoz there is no vulnerable matters. Spend time for this outstanding view of Khangchendzonga snow capped mountain and other high hills over there. I trust that above information will be helpful.....R. Rahman"
91,Amazing!,You can see golden kanchanjunga at the time of sunrise (if the weather is clear). U can actually feel that u are above the clouds..
92,A very pleasant view,"Started from our hotel at 0430 in the morning, got up at 0345 hrs from sleep, that too in the month of December.The driver charged Rs 1200/- for the trip. Even in the morning hours, there was huge rush and vehicles were going to Tiger Hill in hordes. There was traffic jam also. Sunrise was at 0620 hrs. The climb was in total darkness. On reaching near the top, the Bolero we were travelling in could not go anymore as cars were parked on the road sides. We also got down and started walking, you have to be fully dressed up in winter clothing with woolen caps,gloves, inners,sweaters etc to fight the cold. After a steep and slow climb of around 10 minutes, we reached the top. Already it was overcrowded. There were two sets of people - One set only looking at the Kanchenjunga and the other looking towards the east waiting for the sun to appear. Local women were selling coffee. There was a half constructed structure there which is planned as an observatory but work is not complete. People had climbed that unfinished structure also. One person suddenly fell forward and became unconscious. Four - five people including me started to warm him up, he seemed to be all alone. Blood trickled down his lip and we were all getting nervous. After about 5 minutes of massaging, he regained consciousness and his group members also found him. It was an unnerving experience. Meanwhile, the sun appeared and was greeted with a loud cheer. The weather was clear. The Kanchenjunga started changing color and it seemed that somebody was pouring molten gold from its peak, white turning to gold. Lots of fotos were taken. We went trudging back down the road looking for our driver who drove us back.Summary - No administrative arrangements where so many people ( old and young ) visit everyday. No parking space, parking was haphazard and indisciplined. No proper observatory. God only knows when that half finished structure will be completed. No clean toilets.Was thankful to come back. Like all other things in Darjeeling, only the beautiful Kanchenjunga saved the day for us."
93,Amazing Tiger Hill...,"I had visited Tiger Hill earlier. I had no luck in respect of Sunrise but I don't repent for that. But this time in June, 2019 when I visited Darjeeling I had an extremely bad experience. We were looking for a small car as we only wish to visit tiger hill not the other two points which are shown alongwith a Tiger Hill trip. All the cars available in the upper Jeep Stand were saying that you have to start at lease at 3:30 AM if you wish to reach at time. One driver agreed to take us but surprisingly tell us to come at 4 AM. We were surprised but as he was a local driver we believed him. We were ready by 3:50 AM (with a kid of 7 years) and constantly calling him. He came at around 4:15 AM and then started. It was full tourist season and rush was more due to Fani, as like us many persons have cancelled their trip to Puri and have preferred North Bengal and Sikkim. From starting of the journey I became pretty much sure that it may not be possible to reach in time as there was huge traffic congestion. Sun rises before we even reach Ghum. The driver has just duped us and taken full payment saying there is no fault on his part. We repeatedly told him that first of all he told us to come at 4 and then he was 15 minutes late which cost us. After reaching  near Tiger Hill at around 3.5 KM before the hill top the driver stops his car and we tried to walk to the top, but it was not possible for my little daughter. We have told by all the tourists who have been able to reach on time that they have started at 3:30 AM sharp, some have started at 3 AM. We have to tell him to return. It is my advise to all who is willing to visit Darjeeling, please chose your car for Tiger Hill trip very carefully and try to start preferably between 3 AM to 3:30 AM. No one should suffer what we have faced ."
94,Must visit place.,Tiger hill you reach there before sunrise and witness the ultimate experience with the Sun rising from the midst of mountain s.A scene which will enthrall all your memories for a long long time.
95,To view sunrise from here,We have been there for 5 days tour...  Its just and Ok for us because be are from Dehradun so it was just ok no such different or new thing to discovered except Toy train.... But the tickets for toy train is much costly...
96,"Oh My God, view !!",Fabulous view of the sunrise on Kanchenjunga Mountain from Tiger Hill. Very early start and plenty of transports going in that direction. If you find yourself in Darjeeling it's worth the early wake up to see this spectacular event. Visited in Oct 2012.
97,Very badly maintained place.,The sunrise is very famous in tiger hills. It is a very crowded place in mornings at around 4:30 am to admire the beauty of the sunrise. Local vendors are available who sell tea and coffee early in the morning. Very pleasant view of this nature’s beauty.
98,Couldnt witness the sunrise !!,If it is not raining and clear sky then only it is advisable to go in early morning around 4 .30 am to view the first Sunday rising place in India. Very good view point and now that central government also constructing a big building to observe and record the sun rising details.
99,Unfortunate to have not observed it.,"Due to cloudy weather, we could not enjoyed the beauty of this place. So I do not recommend to visit this place if Cloudy/Rainy condition is there. If Climate is clear then definitely you can visit this spot and have a look of sun rise and you can also see Mt Kanchanjanga from there"
100,Must Visit,One of the most hyped place in Darjeeling.The major attraction  is to see the sunrise and mountain view. One needs to start very early around 3:30 AM to avoid the traffic jam ( it is indeed very bad as 1000+ taxis clog the complete way ).Hence be mindful of starting early in the morning.The place is really badly maintained. no proper place to sit and watch sunrise for thousands of people . Can't understand why govt can not complete the half finished stand urgently ( locals tell it is under construction  for last 2 years)Some tips 1) Wear warm clothes as the place is too windy in the early morning and you'll have to stand  for almost 1.5 hrs waiting for sunrise 2) Occupy some space in half complete stand .You can get good view from there . Normally the last comers do that but you'll realise that sitting on stairs will give you much comfort and better view .3) No toilets at the place . Hence be prepared for it 4) Club some other places with this as you'll finish it by 6:30 AM
101,"Been There, Done That",The view is beautiful but the crowds are annoying. Darjeeling has many beautiful views but a lot of 'tourists' come to Tiger Hill for the sunrise since it is the highest point in the area. Yes it is freezing cold especially starting off early in the morning but that is expected and it is a good experience. The shared taxi takes us to a parking point where we start walking up for a few minutes. When we reach the top there is a observatory watchtower plus a sizeable ground area from where to view the sunrise. The only problem is that the observatory was packed with noisy tourists so there was no chance to go up. On the ground area most of the people were right at the edge of the railing crowding it with their arms in the air capturing pics and videos. So it was tough for anyone behind to actually enjoy the view.There was a lot of space behind on the open grounds but these people thought that crowding the barricade a couple of meters ahead would give them a closer view of the sunrise. Honestly if everyone just sat calmly on the grounds it would be so peaceful.. The problem is the mentality of the tourists plus they just visit this place to tick it off their to-do list in Darjeeling. Then some will feel entitled to blast their own bollywood songs and disturb the peace. There is a huge cheer when the sun rises which i found quite pretentious to be honest. Would not do this trip again.
102,Waste of time and money,Worth getting up at 4 am in cold... the view is majestic and the road to Tiger hill also is good... new observatory point under construction... once it's done will have more amazing view of the golden tip of kanchenjunga
103,Much-hyped sunrise point where sunrise if highly elusive!,"Tiger hill is the best place to view sunrise and sunset. Those who visits Darjeeling, must go up to  Tiger hill by walk, there is a hiking path which leads through bamboo and pine forest.I really enjoyed hiking.Visit Tiger Hill"
104,Unfortunately cloudy,Best place in the town where you get to see the beautiful sunrise and the Mountain ranges from a very close distance. Every visitor in Darjeeling does visit this place.
105,Dirty and filled with obnoxious tourists,"Go to this place around 4 am. Pre sunrise scene should not be missed. however, be prepared for a long traffic jam. Must visit."
106,ASIM CHAKRABARTI ,Darjeeling doesn't have much attraction so Tiger point is one the point where every tour and travel person wants you to send you. This point is also known as Sun rise point. To see Sun rise you'll have to leave your hotel between 4 AM to 4:30 AM so that you can reach there by 5:30 AM to see the sunrise. But most of the time (infact any month) due to heavy clouds you won't be able to see the Sun. Also major problem at this place. In returning you'll have to waste atleast 1-2 hrs in traffic jam as it is one way road so you won't be able to go down until the road is clear from below on hill. Many of my friends visited that place and no one was able to see the Sun. So if you love your sleep you can skip this :)
107,Early morning TIGER HILL,I cannot give a good rating as when we visited it was completely cloudy and rainy. Could not see anything. Also did not like the observation area as it was completely in maintained. But I’m sure if you can see Sunrise on Kanchenjunga it would be very present and rewarding…
108,Sunrise Point,"Tiger hill is a must visit place of darjeeling. The view prior, during and post sunrise is mesmerizing. The view of Mount Kanchanjangha just before the sunrise, when the sun rays reflects from the mountain is really a soothing eye experience."
109,Morning show,Goood place ro visit but betweeb October to February when the skies are clear and you get to see the kanchunjunga peaks. Otherwise it is mostly cloudy.
110,An awesome view of Sunrise and the mighty Kangchenjunga,"We started around 4 from our hotel and we could reach within 30min. It was awesome drive and not many cars were there when we reached the place and we had walk very little distance. The sky was clear and full of stars. The horizon on east was little red. Local people were selling hot tea, coffee and woollen caps, shawl etc. Slowly we could see Kanchenjunga and east sky was brighter now and the color of Kanchenjenga started turning red. All of a sudden around 5:30, the first ray of sun came out from east and within a min sun came out very fast. It was a mesmerizing scene. Kanchenga was looking so beautiful."
111,Clear view of Kanchanjunga mountain.,Probably the definitive tourist experience in Darjeeling but you will not be on your own at sunrise. This place gets jammed; the only place I have seen like it at sunrise is Angkor Wat so be warned. If you want to get a good viewing spot you probably want to be here around 4am; wrap up warm though as it's cold up here.Is it worth it all the hassle to wake up early and brave the crowds? It definitely is. There is a reason so many come here and you should also see it for yourself.
112,Spectacular!!,We were exited to see the beauty of the sunrise across the top of kunchenjunga. But unfortunately there was a lot of fog in the cold morning so could hardly get a glimpse of the rising sun and sadly no kunchenjunga visibility.so it is better to go there if the sky is absolutely clear otherwise there is no point getting up at 4 in the cold morning.
113,North east india tour,Traffic is a mess. Massive crowd and really nothing special. Can give it a miss. Seen better sunrise moments but that's just my opinion.
114,Great view,One of the most famous spots in Darjeeling is Tiger Hill. The place is famous for watching Sunrise and as well as Mt. Kanchenjunga. The place remains cold almost throughout the year hence one must be wearing Warm clothes from top to buttom. Hand Gloves are necessary. One require permit to go the Tiger Hill.
115,Amazing Sun Rise And Mountains,This place offers you the best start of the day. You have a complete view of sunrise and it's reflection of beautiful snow clad mountains. However on cloudy days you may not have the view. I am attaching some photos taken during the visit.
116,Excellent place but needs facilities,At 8000 fts it is the most promising location to see the Mt Kanchenjunga. Very famous for seeing the sunrise
117,The illusive hill,"We woke up at 3 AM in order to be among the first to Tiger Hill and enjoy the sunrise in the early morning.  Although the place itself has no charm and is quite dirty, the views on the Kanchenjunga Mountain are worth it."
118,Sunrise at Tiger Hill,"This place is a very over hyped tourist destination.  It is good to watch sunrise, but we could not even see Mount Kanchenjunga after taking all efforts to leave at 4 am.  They are constructing an observatory, but with the sea of visitors coming to watch sunrise and the rays that are supposed to fall on Mt Kanchenjunga, the place is ill equipped to handle the visitors.There is no proper provision for parking of vehicles and it is a nightmare to return back after the sunrise.Would not recommend to get up at 3.30 in the morning and shiver in the cold weather and come disappointed as luck plays a major part if you can see Kanchenjunga."
119,Worth the early start and discomfort of the cold,Early morning 4 am never seems to be this beautiful. We started from our place around 4 am in the morning and reached the hill at 4:40 am. Breezy wind and freezing cold. Shivering and trembling we reached the top of the hill. We waited for almost an hour for the sun to come out and look at us. What a beautiful sight it was!. The sun and the moon both were together and loved the moment spent with them. Its a must visit place.
120,Disappointing,Great place to view the sunrise. Start early so that you can reach the spot early as there are too much rush and traffic jams even at 4 am.
121,"Don't miss it, worth the early morning rise!",Try to be early there and ask the tea sellers about direction in which you can see Kanchanjangha. You need to focus on Kanchanjangha not on sunrise. If you are lucky you will see peak of Kanchanjangha in orange colour even before you can see sun from the hill. The local story goes like this that sunrays first bow to the sacred hill and then give light to the world.
122,Packed but for a reason,"You need to start early like 4 am,  and need lot of luck and good weather conditions. It was a foggy day,  and driver said it is very less chance of getting a good sunrise view. It is best known to locals sitting at hotel only. We didn't get the good view,  and we returned to hotel after wait of 1.5 hours. Please take caps,  jackets etc,  if you are going there,  and if possible,  please skip the small children,  from going there."
123,Hype Created...,It was very frustrating for us. Never go when it is cloudy/ foggy days. You get up at 3-4AM and be there at 4:45 AM. You may not see sun rise most of these days. On return it takes about 3 hrs as traffic management is poor here. It was very frustrating.
124,All roads to Tiger Hills.,"Due to unexpected cloudy weather in Darjeeling, there was fog all around and we could not see the sunrise on Kanchenjunga. Even by noon, due to cloud cover, there was no visibility. Construction of an observatory is going on. Do not bother visiting if the weather is cloudy - find out from the locals about the same. Overall, a disappointment. The road is quite steep, with a short narrow stretch."
125,Unique Experience..,"Again a beautiful tourism spot which has so much potential but wasted. The drivers who come here unnecessarily block roads and this forces people to walk large distances at 3 or 4 in the morning to catch a sun-rise!. Also at the top there is no proper viewing point or viewing station / platform. if you go to forward you will fall off!. No toilets. Abundance of people selling cigarettes, super diluted coffee and tea. The coffee actually tasted like someone boiled a couple of coffee bites in water.!. The access towards the end is very bad, broken path with no railing to hold so difficult for old people. You can avoid going here. Just pay a little extra and get a good hotel room which may have sun-rise views."
126,Midas moment of gold,"Tiger hill is about 30 Km away from Darjeeling, being a vantage point from where one can see all high peaks of the places around. One must make sure of a clear sky before going else nothing would be visible. I saw Mt Kanchanjunga from this place."
127,Best start of the day,"Nothing could be visible only fog , so many people , crowded like hopping Durga Puja pandals , full of smell of cars gasses , would never go again"
128,Nice place to hangout :) at early morning 5.30am at freezing cold,An early morning (@4 in Morning) certainly advisable to witness the Sunrise and view Kanchanjnuga Mountains.. but it all depends on weather which is not predictable. Many times you will not witness the Sunrise and view of KJ.. also there is only one way narrow road to Tiger Hill and often blocked by parking the cars on road.. a construction of watch tower is going on there at TH.. some parking sense is must for the drivers who’s going there in regularly .. you will observe a traffic jam of almost one hour there..
129,Tiger Hills ,"You should be lucky enough to get glipmse of kanchanjunga.Sky has to be totally clean with no fog for any view.We reached round 4:30am, just to find lots and lots of crowd, no hill views and lot of walking because of traffic jam and no parking. All in vain.Not worth at all!!!!Don't waste money, time and sleep for this. 😁😁Totally skipable."
130,A surreal experience ,It's crazy hoe popular this place is for sunrise...most guides arrive just after 4am for  a630 sunrise so it's freezing cold whilst you wait. There are the usual stalls selling beanies/ gloves and of course chai wallahs. The sunrises and slowly the peals on the mountains are illuminated.... it's really beautiful to see (aside from the throngs of people there).Do NOT attempt to use toilets there- they are revolting! Go in a bush before the sun comes up.
131,Morning starts with Sunrise,It is morning 0430 and the hill station is bust with vehicles and tourists. All roads lead to Tiger Hills. A must in the itinerary for seeing the sunrise. The sun rays on the peak Kanchenjunga and the golden view of mountains are awesome.
132,Must see place,"You can get the view of kanchenjunga from here at the sunrise. You should reach here not later than 4am. The rays of the sun directly falls on the kanchenjunga and the view is just amazing. If you're in Daarjeeling, you should definitely take the pain of waking up at 3am and march to the tiger hill. The local cab can be booked in advance."
133,This place defines Darjeeling ,It's very nice to see the sunrise from Tiger Hill unless the weather is clean there is a lot of walking that needs to be done because cars can't drop you till the main point of the site
134,The only Thing to visit in Darjeeling,presently not organised. very chaotic. heavy traffic jams. not safe as no watch tower at present. i big no no
135,good view of sunrise on Kanchenjunga,"This is a must see place and for that you need to reach the place by 4.15 AM, The place is some height and you could see the whole city below the clouds. It is very breezy at the Top so everyone should carry their Ear plugs or monkey caps and gloves to cover your head and hands. If you  are Lucky you will be seeing the best Sunrise ever and can also see the first rays on top of Mountain Kanchanjunga which will make you feel Golden color on Snow covered top of mountain and in the East Sun rising. It is really spectacular view to see Sunrise here"
136,Breathtaking!!,"Once again Kanchenjunga is the highlight of the site as we see a majestic sunrise on the peak in full splendour ... As the infra for the place was still being developed in the form of a sitting podium , there still is a lot to be develped to make this attraction easy going for the tourists ... first we have to get up real early for this ... add to it the travel and then the walk up the hill for around 15 mins as the cars and vans start their parking at the base so as to facilitate easy moving out otherwise the jam is very harrowing .There is no security at the place not to mention basic amenities like toilets etc ...even for the gents!!!!This is truly a test of mans perseverence to see natures splendour in the face of all hardships... recommened to visit however do clothe yourself up well as the temperature dips on this place especially if there is less crowd."
137,Eye catching sunrise ,The view of Kanchenjunga is the best from Tiger Hill during sunrise. This is one of the pristine views anyone can have in a lifetime.
138,Needs major development,"Tiger hill itself is a beautiful place as well as an excellent point to catch the beautiful view of the highest mountain peak of India ""The Kanchanjangha"""
139,Mind blowing marvellous memorable view,"The ideal time for the visit for the view is in the winters. It also depends on one's luck. In May, all one can see is thick clouds so try your luck."
140,A nice location to view Kanchanjanga range.,It is sunrise point where u have to reach 4.45 am ..So u have to wake up early at 3.30am and get ready n travel 10 km which take 45 min approx ... u can see sunrise if fog and cloud is not there ...Only few time it is possible to see sunrise ... Maximum time it is cover with dense cloud or fog..
141,On the right day - AMAZING,"we wokeup early morning 3 o clock and get ready for a journey of beautiful sunrise morning.... Already booked car arrived at 4:15 and we started not morning cold journey...You can realized that there are lots of vehicles already ralling in front of your car...After 40 to 45 min journey you will reach there...Lots of people selling coffee coffee coffeeAnd finally after reach to top...You feel crowd..And our indian language it's called meela...When time came a red circle appears in front of you  ""FRESH SUN OR BABY SUN""...But  first red light scatters in Kanchenjunga hills which was main reason it's called tiger hill...blurr and faded but beautiful...So I will suggest go there and fill on top standing with Kanchenjunga....Plz feel free to whatsapp me for more details..9685289754"
142,shrouded in mist,We were very excited to see the color of tiger hill so we left our hotel early morning. When we reached there there were already many people. When the first sunlight fall on the peak of the mountains it suddenly turn into golden colour.
143,Avoid in the mornings,The view and place was so awesome however the places is very very crowded.....suggestion go early and stand at proper place from where you can see both Sunrise and Kanchanjunga...
144,Good place. Nothing so special to visit in the early hours. ,"Though we reached by 4.30 AM to watch the sunrise on Kanchanjunga Mountains, the clouds played its role and could not see the sunrise.  It was advised by the local guide, September and October will be too good for watching sunrise from Tiger Hills."
145,Spectacular Views,"The tour guys will make you reach this place around 4-am, so that you get standing place at the top and they get parking place coz that place gets chaotic by 6-7am. Sunrise is around 5.45-ish. So be ready to stand long, be pushed around and more chaos once the sunrises. If you are lucky and there’s no cloud/ fog cover than you get a beautiful view of Mt.Kanchenjunga. The place could be well organised with some some good toilet facilities make it world class."
146,Too many people,Great view of sunrise. Couldn't get a glimpse of Mt. Everest as promised.  Pretty chilly in the morning.  New concrete structures  being built now to turn this place more touristy.
147,Waiting for Sun in Cold morning,"This is probably the best sunrise point in India. Most of the time this area is covered with cloud, but if the sky is clear at morning time then you can enjoy the nice view of the sunrise. The best time to visit the Tiger Hill is March-April or October-December."
148,Lost for words to explain about the experience,"If you are visiting only the town of Darjeeling and want to get a glimpse of the first rays of the sun on the majestic peaks of the Kangchenjunga and Pandim, Tiger Hill is the common option (although you may get such views from some places of the town itself). However, if you can spend time, energy, and money, going to Sandakphu or Phalut (at least Tonglu) would be much better. At those places, you would feel that the mountain ranges are at pebble-throwing distances. Also, because of the higher altitude, the weather is usually clearer in the mornings and you can have a better view of the sunrise.Everything being said, Tiger Hill is not a bad place. But it is so popular that everybody rushes there, and in the peak season, finding sufficient space to stand comfortably for watching the sunrise, without being pushed by other  people, becomes difficult. And let us not talk about peace and quiet: there will certainly be such folks in Tiger Hill as to make loud noises, thus breaking the silence of the tranquil dawn."
149,Good morning,"Spectacular sunrise watching location that offers a beautiful view of Darjeeling Town, the rolling mountains and the Himlayas. On a clear day you can see all the big mountains including Everest. Be sure to get there early to get a good spot at the front. Expect crowds though as this is THE spot to watch the sunrise."
150,"Crowded, quite noisie.",By far the highlight of our holiday...just to see the first rays of sunlight on the mighty Kanchenjunga was an unforgettable and priceless experience. Go early at least 2 hours before sunrise to both get a good spot and parking space!!
151,Sunrise view on Kanchenjunga Peak,"This is some experience. Getting up at 3 in the morning and travelling to the top most point of Darjeeling to view the beautiful Sun rise and the Gigantic Mount Kanchanjungha. It was so cold up there, feet’s freezing. But the other experience was above all. Sharing photo’s."
152,"Wanna have a look at Everest, go for it!!",As we wake up early morning 3:30am and rush towards tiger hill as sin rise was at 4:58 .We reached on time but due to fog on that day we cannot capture sunrise moment s.
153,What a View.....,"What a sight to behold!! Lifetime experience. When the sun rises and its first ray falls on the peak of Kanchenjunga mountain, it is a sight which you can't see anywhere else, I believe. Must Must see if you are visiting Darjeeling."
154,Cream of the Crop,"The Tiger Hill is usually highlighted by all the tour/travel operators as an early morning visit (4am) to view the sunrise.But, please note the weather conditions before going as during monsoon season, there is a foggy view and you would not be able to see anything. It would be a complete waste of time waking up at 4 am to go there, You may visit the place as part of the other sightseeing points itself.We visited in Sep and not able to get a view of the sunrise or the view of Kanchenjunga.Currently, the place is even more messier as construction of an observatory is going on."
155,Tiger Hill nice but... very crowded,I went there alone leaving my family at the hotel. I began at 4am from the hotel by taxi. Reached the tiger hill 45mins. It was very crowded and the driver parked the car much ahead of the hilltop. But it was very unfortunate that it wasn't a clear day. Full of clouds and couldn't see any bit of the sunrise. The crowd was disappointed too but it was an experience to have at least tried. My advice would be to go to the tiger hill in day time when the Sun is up and sky is clear to get a view of the mountain and enjoy the valley view also. Don't take elderly people and  small kids there as they have to walk steep and face cold weather during sunrise...
156,NOT SO GREAT!,"High peaks, natural surroundings, green mountains, clouds, sunrise moment, name it and you will find it. Such is the place, such is the beauty. Must visit."
157,A must visit place at Darjeeling on a clear sky day.,"We reached around 4pm and there was very minimal crowd. We were able to watch the mountains via telescope. 30rs per head. Luckily, there was no fog/mist and got a clear view of the mightiest Kanchenjunga Mountain."
158,"Extremely crowded, not worth the time",It was a awesome & mind blowing experience to see the sunrise at Kanchanzanga the 3rd highest pick of the world.
159,Spectacular View,"If kids, take adequate woollens. One has to reach by 4.30am, to get a good place to watch sunrise. As it is in open, can get very cold, hence plan accordingly.The sunrise was a humbling experience and one can see nature  at its best there. If lucky, Kanchenjunga massif can be seen best from Tiger Hill.."
160,Great Views (If you r lucky),Experience panoramic view of some of the highest peaks in the Himalayas you can reach the Summit either by foot 11 kilometres some the town of Darjeeling tour by Jeep with a straight lines distance of 172 kilometres you can actually see the world's rooftop Mount Everest from this site even though the five metre highest peak makalu appears here because of the curvature of the earth observe the watched mountains landscape around you and the rivers which mender to the South visit the wildlife sanctuary situated close to the Summit remember to bring your hiking boots and warm clothing for this winter also check the weather conditions as it may be very foggy or it may rain the best time to visit here is in the month of October and November
161,Just stunning views,"you will feel close to god and your memories will be imprinted with clouds , hills , snow , sun set and sun rise for ever"
162,Good Place,This is the point from where you can view the sunrise and its magic effect on the Himalayan mountain range. You need to be at the place by 4:30 am in the morning. There is no guarantee of witnessing the spectacle as any amount of fog and clouds can spoil the event. The drive to the point is 30 min but is jam packed with tourists. If you are lucky on the given day then the view is absolute beauty.
163,Good place with poor facilities,We go to Darjeeling for 4 days.On our 2nd day we went for the tiger hill at 4:00am to see the sunrise.In the early morning it was a fresh and very beautiful environment.There are great places from where you can flawlessly see the sunrise.Our mind never want to go back from there.I recommend everyone to go there and enjoy the purity of the nature.
164,fabulous views,"The occasional views of  Kunchanjunga are best from here. However, reaching there at time of sunrise requires a lot of effort hence some other places like one near mall road is more recommended."
165,Over hyped and no proper arrangement ,"Yes, you get to see Mt Kanchenjunga at sunrise. However, you have to get up at stupid o'clock to beat the traffic of Jeeps going up the mountain, stand for a couple of hours freezing your butt off, surrounded by crowds of tourists, before you get to see the same mountain that you can see from the comfort of Darjeeling or Ghoom. Maybe the tiny little bit of Everest that you can see if you squint hard enough makes it all worth it."
166,Perfect view point for Kanchanjangha!!!,Tiger Hill is the perfect place in Darjeeling to witness the beautiful sunrise and the Kanchenjunga....One has to reach their early in the morning to find a good spot to see the sunrise over the horizon....Please wear warm clothes as it is quite chilling up on Tiger Hill....
167,Awesome view of the Kanchenjuga,"The best part of Darjeeling trip was the sunrise view at Tiger Hills. Seeing the fog the previous days , we thought we will miss it . But we were lucky . The view was just awesome"
168,The best thing to do in Darjeeling!,Beautiful views if you can start your visit early enough to see before the clouds and fog begin to see in.
169,Sunrise,"On a clear day it definitely has one of the best sunrise you can see, with the clouds below you as a bed of cotton the sky looks amazing with the rising sun. The first ray of sun enlightens the Kanchenjunga peak, and it is a sight to see. People reach there as early as 3:00 am to see the sky changing colors. It is one of the highest point of the region and thus is cold. There are lot of local ladies selling coffee and tea, so you can easily get your cup of hot tea. Few shops also sell warm clothes like gloves and caps. The was a observation hall for visitors which is being reconstructed. I was wary of driving but it is okay to drive, in case  you have prior experience of driving. As per advise from TripAdvisor member I gave lift to an lady selling coffee, who guided to get to the right slip road after Ghum Station. Currently there is no ticket to reach there. The road uphill gets stuck with traffic in peak season, so might be good idea to take a taxi.It is okay for people of all ages if warmly clothed."
170,Amazing view of the Kanchanganga,"I went to Tiger Hill. If you want to witness the first rays of sun hitting the twin peaks of Kangchenjunga, along with a panoramic view of Everest peeping through the peaks standing by its side, then Tiger Hills make for a perfect sunrise for you. It is great place to go."
171,Amazing view of Kanchenjunga,"We had to leave our hotel at 4AM to ensure we reach in time to Tiger hills for sunrise. Once you reach the spot, you will have to walk for about 10 to 15 minutes to reach the viewing area. There is a big open space and also they have built a specific viewing area. I suggest you to go early and get a good place to stand and take photographs. Towards the right is the sunrise spot and towards the left, is where you will see the Kunchenjunga peaks. The beauty of this sunrise is that the first rays of the sun fall on Kunchenjunga and you will see them turn a beautiful golden colour. After a while you will see the beautiful ball of light peeping out slowly from the right. It's so beautiful. This is something you have to witness. However we also heard that the sunrise is not visible many a times due to the foggy weather there. So please check on the weather updates before you decide to go. This place has a small shop if you need coffee or snacks and also has toilets.Skip the toy train but do not skip this beautiful sunrise."
172,"Tiger Hill, Darjeeling Overview","Most of the tourists who come to Darjeeling make it a point to visit Tiger Hill, as it is one of the best locations on the top of a hill to watch the sunrise"
173,Beautiful and busy,If you are lucky and if the sky is clear you can get to see a picture perfect sunrise and probably the best of your lifetime and this happens only in Tiger Hill!!!
174,superb,Wow one of the best and most beautiful hill i have ever visited. The hill is very beautiful and amazing to see.
175,Excellant,"You can say its a lottery ticket.a place to visit for sunrise with kanchunzungha.i was not lucky to see that moment from there.every day lots of people visit here, spent lots of money,but alas....a under constructed building standing over there from year and year."
176,Best place in Darjeeling,This Pointis a must visit if you have gone to Darjeeling. Not to be missed for the amazing Sunrise around 5 am in the summers.
177,Lovely sunrise view,Awesome place to click a morning view of sunrise and Kanchanjunga....and faraway Everest.... We enjoyed chilling winds at 2C temperature...in February...waiting for sun to rise and get a view of Everest and Kanchanjunga... Must see if you are visiting Darjeeling
178,Awesome view...,We had to leave at 4 am to travel to Tiger Hill to witness the sunrise. Well worth the sacrifice of sleep for the amazing atmosphere with thousands of visitors converging on one hill. The drive to Tiger Hill is awesome. A Must see trip.
179,Breathtaking views,"This place is not for kids at all. To get a good view, you have to reach there at least one hour before Sunrise and waiting in such a cold place is not less than torture for kids and young children.The view of sunrise and snow mountain depends on weather on that particular day. If the weather is cloudy, than your hardship will go in vain. Check your horoscope or weather conditions before going there.If you are lucky, the views of the sunrise and the appearance of snow mountains from the site are mesmerizing and a treat for eyes."
180,Amazing Sunrise ,Great view of the sunrise in the morning.  Ensure that you leave early to avoid the traffic jam on the way.  Great experience
181,Sun Rise 🌄 At Tiger Hill 🗻  . ....,"I haven't expereiced any other place vith such stunning views of valleys and mountains. The best part is to be surrounded by clouds to the horizon and sun rising above the clouds, something like you see on flights. If one visits darjeeling you can't miss this, to put it better you should visit darjeeling just for this."
182,Breathtaking Beauty,"We were running little late and due to that got stuck in heavy traffic jam while going up, ultimately got down midway and climbed the way up so that we did not miss the rising of Sun. It was a very nice experience."
183,Nature at its best,We didn't visit in the morning as view from our accommodation in Darjeeling was just awesome.....We visited in the afternoon and it was just beautiful. There was no one but only our group....Presently construction of viewing podium is in progress .... doesn't look like will be completed soon...Presently
184,Rise to the sunrise,I don't understand why it is called Tiger Hill. Anyway we were unlucky as the mountain range was obscured by a thick haze and it was a disappointment though we had reached there by 3:30 AM  Hats off to those ladies who trek all the way to serve hot coffee to the tourists.
185,Perfect,Life time achievement....you should not miss if you are been in darjeeling. You will get lots of local inhabitants who will offer/ sell hot coffee during the remarkable hours.Kanchanjangha ! With the sunrise on my goodness! Just watch my pics...
186,Kanchan janga sunrise ,This is the place which highlights Darjeeling because of its pristine beauty and the view of the mountains. Everyone should visit this place specially in October/November.
187,Heavenly!,"Every hillstation in the country has a 'sunrise' point. Tiger Hill is no different and is the much-hyped sunrise point in Darjeeling. It is a very ordinary experience and more of a sham seemingly popularized by the tourist agents and taxi drivers in Darjeeling to add a point in the sight-seeing itinerary and since it is around 40 mins from the main city, the agents and the cabbies charge high and earn good money from unassuming tourists. The point is a plateau on the top of a hill from where sunrise can be witnessed. You have to leave as early as 4am from your hotel and be there on time as sunrise happens early over here between 5 to 5:30 am. So popularized is the place that evidently there is a rush of around 200-400 taxis (perhaps even more in peak season) every morning filled with over-enthusiastic tourists who wake up early just to get a glimpse of the sunrise. However such unpredictable is the weather of Darjeeling that it might seem clear for a while and in the next few minutes it can turn completely foggy making your chance of catching the sunrise very elusive. By 5:30 am it turns into a bright morning and in most cases the sun will be up in the sky by then and you would miss it arising from behind mountains. Since we hardly wake up early in our urban lives to witness a sunrise and even if we do, it's mostly elusive behind the city's tall edifices, such points have become so popular. But chances of catching a good sunrise are bleak and mostly left to luck.Also the place has no demarcated viewing point. People stand wherever they can to get a valley view. It's very crowded in the mornings. If you reach a little late, your driver will park away from the plateau area and you will have to walk up till there. Hot coffee is the only thing that you can get at this place. There are no public toilets. The area is littered with garbage. Despite being such a prominent tourist spot, there is no effort by the tourism board to maintain this place or keep it clean. While the sunrise will happen to your right side, people actually come to see the sunlight falling on the Kanchenjunga range on your left side and view the orange to white shades on its peak. But Kanchenjunga is so far that this sight is equally elusive. You can get a better view of Kanchenjunga in its full glory if you choose the right hotel in Gangtok or Pelling. We got to witness it more majestically and peacefully from our hotel rooms ('Magpie Chestnut' in Pelling will give a beautiful view if the weather is clear). Would suggest to choose your hotels more judiciously and skip the morning running around to Tiger Hills!"
188,Foggy view in Sep,I had visited this place in Jan 2019. I would say there is so much hype created about this place. There are several other places in Darjeeling where you can have much better view of Kanchenjunga range.
189,Chillllly place,"We  wakes up at 3.30 to reach hill at 5 am, and no space is there to even properly stand up. Stands are getting build since a very long time, more then half space is captured by the street vendors to sell their products."
190,Simply Mesmerising!,"It's must, if you have ability to do tough trekking. It's not very easy but it's osum too. Start early morning. you can use hourse riding up to 1/2 way."
191,Wait for clear sky,Beautiful Sunrise.I recommend getting up early.Winter is on top. Dress up properly. Beautiful experience. In September the sunrise was at 5.15
192,Mr vinod,"A lovely spot by all means which the people have not taken care of. Even the railings which should ensure safety of visitors are all broken. Ongoing construction activities make the place dirty, full of iron rods, concrete etc. But the view is definitely stunning if you can manage a cloudfree vision.But clouds are quite  unpredictable in this part of the world so viewing the entire range is difficult."
193,Great view of Sunrise...but poor infrastructure and no regulation !!,U cants see kanchanjunga or himalayan ranges ecxept in october or may. avoid as darjeeling is always cloudy
194,Sun rise point,This high point in Darjeeling offers wonderful views of the Himalayas especially the Holy mountain of Kanchenjunga on a clear day . Wonderful must visit place
195,sun set and sun rise view point,"Am sure no-one can disagree that this place can ever be disappointing. The whole experience of watching the skyline when you are waiting for sunset and simultaneously, how it brightens up Kanchenjunga, is beyond words. Missing Tiger Hill is a wasted trip to Darjeeling."
196,Not Recommended!!!,Reach this place much before the sunrise. The top of the hill gets crowded and parking your vehicle will take time or you might have to park down the slope and walk for a few minutes. Also you gotta be lucky to get a clear view of Sunrise. Most days are foggy. The scenery is exotic.
197,Breathtaking!!,"You need to get there early to grab your spot.  It does get very crowded.  Also for those who tend to suffer from altitude sickness, the climb is quite rapid."
198,Just Amazing,I visited this place in 8 april 2019...but i cant see the magic of the kanchenjunga mountain from tiger hill due to bad rainy weather...best time to visit this place is octomber and november..in this month you wll surely see kanchenjunga..but if you also want to visit gangtok and lachung lachen than best time to visit april
199,Just Alright,"Reach as early as possible to get a good spot as people start coming way before sunrise. But if the weather is clear, the view is just mesmerizing."
200,Nice view,This is an amazing place located a little ahead of Darjeeling’s Ghum area. The drive to the place is simply spectacular and it is a must visit to see the view of Kanchenjunga range. A very early morning sunrise time is much recommended. One should ideally reach the place before sunrise to see the spectacular view
201,kanchenjunga view point,"Got up at 4.30AM to see the sun rising over the Kanchenjunga----actually it rose over an adjacent peak. But the reflection came over the Kanchenjunga much before the sun rose over the range and we watched in awe as the Kanchenjunga turned from vague outline to pink and finally there kit was in all its glory--shining white! And then the sun peeked out from the adjacent mountain! Awe inspiring nature at its best, Humbling experience!"
202,big name but no show,"The best attraction in Darleeling. You have to wake up early morning at about 3.30 am and leave for tiger hill. Reach early to take your car to the top of the hill, as there is a rush of cars. You will be amazed to view the sunrise and the reflection the the first light on Kanchenjunga  on a clear day. Heavy woollen clothes are needed as the temperature is always remains freezing. There is a entry fee. Tickets are available in 3 categories. Highest paid tickets will be transferred to the 2nd floor of the Gorkha council Building on Tiger Hill, Where you can take rest over a cup of tea/coffee (complementary) till the sunrise. There is a toilet also."
203,"Tiger Hill, Darjeeling - Specialized Spectacular view of Hill Town","Tiger hill offers great sunrise view. You can also enjoy the great view of Mt. Kanchanjunga. The place is crowded, so early you go better it is so you can find a good spot to enjoy the sunrise. When you to there don't forget to take a picture of license plate of the car you take there as when you return to the parking you will not recognize your car as you are going there from your hotel early in the morning during the dark and you can not recognize the face of your driver and the car itself and if you do not have cellphone there and cell number of your driver you will be in some trouble."
204,Fascinating view of Kanchanjangha,"You need to start early(4 am) to reach the tiger hill by 4:45/5 else there would be too much crowd already at the spot and you need to have your vehicle parked far off and climb good amount of distance. Once you reach the top (should be before sunrise) you need to wait among other hundreds of people for two things if the weather(fog/cloud/sky) is favourable. One is the sunrise, other is the the reflection of sun rays on kanchanjanga peak. We could not see sunrise ( due to clouds) but enjoyed the tip of kanchanjanga glow with the sunrise. It was awesome and more or less worth the getting there early and waiting for it. If you have shall kids you better avoid as it's difficult and biting for them you get up so early and wait so long there standing and waiting the sunrise time. I heard December month is better as the mountain would be ice covered and the sky wood be clear. But as I mentioned you need to be lucky to get the best possible view."
205,Total waste of time and early wakeup,"Watching the sun rise here is something I’ll remember forever. You get to watch the  sky go a gradual rainbow colour as it gets closer to dawn, get to see the sun appear (and everyone cheer) and then once it’s risen get to see the peaks of Kanchenjunga. Just make sure you do it on a day that’s going to be clear. It’s a must if you’re visiting Darjeeling and is well worth the very early wake up. We got there for 3.30am and it was already filling up. It is very cold though (even for an Englishman) so take a thick coat, hat, scarf and gloves. Taxis can’t get very close as it’s quite busy so bring a torch and be prepared to walk ten minutes up hill in the dark."
206,Looks like whole mountains is of Gold,It's nice to visit the Tiger Hill in Darjeeling. Awesome view and relaxing place. I would love to visit again.
207,Nice Views,I am not really sure if visiting Tiger Hills was really worth waking up at 4 AM. The sunrise was no different from most other hill stations. The real disappointment was not being able to get a clear view of Kanchenjunga. I may have had a better experience if it was a clear sky.
208,"Hapiness 8,482 feet above sea level","Tiger hiss is a great place for getting the stunning beauty of Kanchanjangha . But you should be getting early in the morning. The amazing view of the mountain will blow your mind. The rising sun , the reflecting mountain were just mesmerizing"
209,Have to be lucky to get clear weather,This the only best thing in darjeeling ... you need to reach there by 5.30 by that time it will be crowded find the best view place and settle there .... if not later it will be crowded and you may miss the view ...
210,Best place to visit at Darjeeling,"As part of the program, we visited the place. Waking up and start with 4.30AM was a great challenge for us along with the cold breeze that we experienced on the top of the hill. However we went their within proper time but in wrong place. Please make sure you stand on the right side of the hill as sun will appear on that sight. Also don't forget to bring your selfie stick along with your winter cloths (heavy jacket, cap, hand gloves and socks) to enjoy the time here. Extra precaution need to be taken for families with children for food and cloths. As you  had to stay their from 4.30am to 6.30am you need to pack food for your children with you."
211,Very crowded place,Sheer waste of time and energy not to speak of money.. one has to get up by 4am to visit to watch sunrise which most of the time is hidden behind the clouds. I was told by the driver very few days one could see the distant mountain range and sunrise.The area is filthy with with plastic cups strewn all over and a new multistory  construction going on for tourists!!!! where is the natural beauty?They are creating an eye sore.The Tourism department should see tourist spots abroad-how nature friendly and unobtrusive they are.
212,Clouds,"Be sure to be there by 4.30 am to view sunrise,a remarkable place and dont forget to take your warm clothes as the weather is more cool, If you are a winter lover then you dont need any warm clothes"
213,A Teribale point,"Get there early, it gets really really crowded. It is in your best interest to leave your hotel at around 3 am or so for a good view. There are vendors who sell tea/coffee there so don't worry about that. Dress warmly!!! And leave the rest to God. If it is cloudy, you will not see the sunrise. I wasn't able to see the sunrise and I don't know if it was worth it, to be fully honest."
214,First sun rising place,"It was a waste of time, we woke at 3 am as our car was supposed to come at 4 am to pick us to visit this point to see sunrise. We reached there at 4 45 am and saw the sunrise around 5 am. it was nothing special there but while coming back we had to wait in car from 5 30am till 8 am as road was blocked by local taxi guys. I thought it was our bad luck but I was told by our driver that this is daily practice and they can't do anything..it's total dadagiriPlease avoid this point"
215,Amazing. Experience ,"So you've to be there by 0515 AM .. usually sunrise is near 6 AM ... however the earlier the go, better for you to capture a nice spot to witness this mesmerizing view."
216,Picture Perfect!!,"To call it a perfect Tiger Hill trip, you need to - wake up from sleep at 3 am, get out of the hotel by half an hour past 3, have an empty road for the 10-12 km stretch up to the summit of the Tiger Hill, reach the summit by 4:15-30, find yourself a good spot for witnessing the sun rise in 15 minutes, wait for the sun to rise and spread it's amber light on the snow capped mountains and a cloudless, mist free blue sky. Now, I have serious doubts whether any traveler ever has been able to tick all the boxes. It needs some determination and a tremendous amount of fortune. As far as determination goes, we were up at 2 am and were on our way to the summit by a few minutes past 3:30. Since it was a trip in May, when there were a huge number of tourists at Darjeeling, our car had to pause every 5-10 minutes and our progress was considerably slow. By the time our car slowly made it's way up the curvy roads of Tiger Hill, it was almost 5 and we knew we'd miss the sunrise. The number of cars present there were way, way more than you'd see at a shopping mall on a Sunday evening. On asking our driver, we were told that the summit was 1.5-2 kms away from where we were. Hence we decided to hike up. As we began our hike, it was no major surprise to see that most other tourists had come up with the same idea as ours. The path to the summit represented a car park and we made our way through the gaps as fast as we could. After the climb, on reaching the summit at about 5:30, we saw the sun had been up for a fair while and there were oceans of clouds surrounding us. So, even if we would have made it in time, we'd be able to see the amber glow on the clouds instead of the snow capped peaks. However, it was still a pretty lovely experience to hike up in the cool, fresh air and witness the early morning sun, shine upon the hilltops and clouds. There were coffee-selling vendors around as well.As compared to the mundane city life, it still is a wonderful change to wake up so early, with extreme amounts of excitement and go on a short hike. So, I'd definitely recommend it to all nature and hiking lovers. For those who'd want a guaranteed view of the sunrise and peaks, you should probably make the trip between the months of October and February, when the chances of getting a clear sky are much higher.If you reserve a car for the trip during peak season, it should cost you around Rs. 1500 - 2000/-. During other times, the charges are much less. On the whole, you should definitely go for it with an open mind and enjoy every moment as it comes. After all, fortune favors the brave! :)"
217,Sunrise of a lifetime!,"A visit to Tiger Hill is the biggest mistake of our trip to Darjeeling. While most would say that no trip to Darjeeling is complete without Tiger Hill - this is a marketing gimmick. Kanchenjunga is visible only on a handful of days from this location. Due to the unique location of the place it is mostly covered in fog/clouds.There is total mismanagement and chaos on the road to Tiger Hill. More than 1000 tourist vehicles clog up the route. Those who reach early need to wait for hours for the jam to open up to defend down. Those who reach late need to walk 40-45min up the hill by when you would miss the sunrise.There is no basic facility like a toilet and it is heartbreaking to see young children and elderly suffer the trip. The local administration needs to put in basic policies and facilities.On your next trip to Darjeeling, definately skip this location"
218,avoid if cloudy,"We were there around 4 am in the morning, parking our vehicle 5 mins away from the tiger hill sunrise observatory, which is the highest point on tiger hill. With around 1000 vehicles and around 5000 people waiting, we couldn't see the sunrise as it was completely covered with fog. Maybe without fog it would have been a good experience.Overall, we didnt have luck in weather, and advise to check the weather before proceeding to tiger hill."
219,Tiger Hills View is a miserable experience most of the time.,We went to Tiger hill by taxi with a plan to walk back to Darjeeling along the old road . The Hill itself wasn't spectacular due to the building work going on there but the walk back down was great and we met a soldier who showed us the old British sanitorium- a piece of history.
220,Did You Know,It was great to view the sunrise and vivid colors reflecting on Mt Kanchenjunga. There was a huge crowd witnessing the spectacular view. I wish there is way to limit the chaos and traffic jam though.
221,Northeast tour,Nice place to visit.One can enjoy the magnificent view of Kanchenjunga and Mt.Everest and Mt.Mukalau on a clear weather.Tiger Hill is a beautiful hill and not very far from Darjeeling town.People who love trekking can go for trekking from.Chowrasta till the Jalapahar Cantt near Aloo Bari.
222,A walk in the midst of clouds . ,"This is the best spot to visit if you are in Darjeeling.You need to get up quite early and reach there before 4.45-5. Otherwise you might need to walk to the hill as there would be lot of cars already blocking the way.You might also complain about the lot of people selling stuff there in the early morning and lack of facilities. But when the moment comes, all these things fades. Its pure joy to view the sun and its first rays when its very mild. You enjoy the natural beauty like no other. Obviously if you are unlucky then there might be clouds :-(.We could see the sunrise but we could not view the Kanchanzunga due to the clouds, but hey no complains."
223,Do not visit during vacation,"Tiger Hill is located at apx. 11kms  from Darjeeling town and above Ghum. It's the highest point in Darjeeling hills at an altitude of apx 8500 ft. It ios a point from where one can enjoy the best view of the sun rising. However one should consult the weather , otherwise it will be a waste of time with ony fog in the vicinity. Nowadays you need to take a permit from the police station to visit. However the car you will book will arrange the same one day in advance. Best possible period to get clear view is mid October to Mid December, or March-april"
224,Not worth the effort,"You need to be exceptionally lucky to see the Kanchenjunga from tiger hills. The weather has to be absolutely clear, with zero clouds and mist. That almost never happens in this place. You'll get far better views of Kanchenjunga from Pelling."
225,Depends on the weather,The zig zag roads of the 'Queen of Hills' took us to a place called 'Tiger Hill'.It was a chilly morning. At about 4.40 am we had reached the place. Few tourist had already arrived by then. Apart from tourist there were few local people selling tea and coffee to beat the cold. After a long wait of nearly two hours i had the first glimpse of the sun rise. What a breathtaking view !
226,Sun rise point,"you will get the chill rising your spine the moment u see the beautiful sight .if lucky only u can get the view, else it will be foggy. Very crowded so go early by 4 am."
227,Nice place for a good view,"You will need to be there by 530am, the view is astonishing, only if it's clear, which we were blessed to see. There are about a 1000 people there to see it. October is a great time to go to darjeeling for clear skies but a possibility it can be foggy, I got some great photos. I would leave your hotel by 430-445am not to miss out."
228,Very frustrating,"Getting up at 03-15H was not easy but it was worth it to just see the sunrise over the Himalayas. The morning waqs misty and we could not see Kanchendzonga, but the sun through the mist as it rose was spectacular. However, be prepared to have a long wait getting back to Darjeeling as it took us over 2 hours to get to our hotel!"
229,Sunrise from Tiger Hill,Amazing place to be.!!! A very clear view of the kanchenjunga peak and the ranges from very close.and it makes for a beautiful view!!! And the view of Everest from quite far (of course). However was told by the local people that October end wud b perfect time to see Everest and sunrise very clearly too.
230,Amazing view point to see many of the big peaks of sikkim,A dawn visit to Tiger Hill is a must for any Darjeeling trip. We were incredibly lucky as the clouds had cleared just the previous night. The view of Kanchanjunga as the dawn breaks is heavenly. We also saw Everest but it's quite small being far away.The downer is the unfinished viewing building. It is positively dangerous as there are no railings and there is debris lying everywhere. There is also very poor traffic management and very little parking space. The govt needs to provide better facilities in one of the most spectacular tourist attractions in India.
231,Test your luck and go for it,One of the best scenes I ever seen.For this you have to get early at 3:30Am and reach there by 5-5:3p and then wait for sunrise and when sun rays falls on the peak of Kanchanjunga.Golden Cap of Kanchanjunga is a treat to watch
232,Cloudy day.. didn't see the sunrise,Yes I am looking for a few days ago the attached file is scanned image in PDF format please find the attached file is scanned image in PDF format please find the attached file is scanned image in PDF format please find the attached file is the door.
233,Nothing spcl,"There is a saying in Hindi, 'naam bade darshan chote'.It fits The tiger hill sunrise. This type of sunrise can b seen from anywhere nd seen so many times. The real, astonishing sunrise with multiple colours seen was at Munnar."
234,Good place to visit,"It's a cold and freezing vigil from 430 am to 615 am... but totally worth it. The November 1st week temperature was around 7degrees, and with a strong wind and fog, the wait definitely was chilly!Our driver had warned us that wind and fog would play a major role in being able to see the peaks. They certainly did, causing the Kanchenjuga view to play hide and seek as the sun rose..in the 30 minutes after sunrise, we managed to steal glimpses of the peaks in the changing color of pure white to Golden as the rising sun rays hit them, but these glimpses were enough to make this my top experience of our 5 day Gangtok Darjeeling holiday."
235,Offers amazing view,"Woke up 3.30 am and started our journey at 4.30 in the morning., by the time we reached there was huge crowd over the hill road .,, hundreds of cars parked ., and after getting down from our taxi., we walked for a km or more to reach the view point. The feeling of watching the sun rising up from the clouds is really splendid 😍 Unfortunately that day being a cloudy day we couldn’t get a clear view of #himalayanrange."
236,Best view,"Throughout our Sikkim tour we could not get a glimps of Kanchanjunga due to fog and cloudy weather. Naturally we came to Tiger hill with much anticipation for its reputation of providing an unhindered view of Kanchanjunga mountains during Sunrise. At 4.30am in morning we reached the spot. Tourists had already started pouring in. It was cold  February morning but it did not hold back people from coming in. After Waiting for 2 hours , sipping on hot cups of coffee Sun finally rose behind mountains spreading its orange yellow rays in the sky. A loud cheer came from a crowd and everyone turned their heads in direction of Kanchanjunga. What seem like floating clouds before sometimes turned out to be Kanchanjunga mountains standing high in distance. A view to cherish! Though we did not get to see much talked about golden peaks as sun shines its rays on the mountains, our wait to see Kanchanjunga had finally come to end. Cheers!"
237,Summer vacation may 2018,"Tiger hill is not just a sight seeing point it is an experience. Waking up early in the morning by 4am to catch a glimpse of the sunrise and the first beams of the sun falling on the mighty snow capped Himalayas. With people clapping and whistling as the sun rises, this us nothing short of a memorable experience"
238,LAND OF SUNRISE,"This is touted as one of the best things to do when in Darjeeling. Beware that it's only for a couple of months in the whole year. Otherwise the place is very misty with no view of the sunrise or the mountains at that time of the day. Don't take the pains of getting up that early in the morning at 4.30 a.m and drive down the narrow road to reach the place, walk a long distance because of the traffic jam and end up seeing nothing there. The place has poor infrastructure which is not worth the pain. Be doubly sure that you will have a clear sky the morning that you are going to visit. Otherwise visit during the daytime when you will be visiting other tourist places."
239,Tiger Hill,"Since the sun rises early in the East, one has to wake up quite early in order to be in time to see the sunrise. A tarmac motorable road to Tiger Hill makes the going easy and since there is adequate space available to view the sunrise, there'e no need to scramble. However, being early has its own advantages as one can always watch night turn into day painting the sky in an array of pleasant colors while enjoying a cup of coffee that ladies dispense into paper cups from gigantic thermos.Though clouds prevented us from seeing the sunrise, but the panoramic view of Darjeeling (identifiable by the glimmer of lights) and the cool and fresh air more than made up for the agony of waking up early. So, even if sunrise alludes you due to clouds, the exhilarating feeling of being in nature's lap is an equally memorable experience- so don't give this a miss!"
240,Very rare chances of kanchanjunga view. Not worth!!,"4.00 am start, no infrastructure, no safety, pushing and shoving crowds, dirty filthy rubbish everywhere. Google it first, oh did I mention the traffic!!!!!! Do not go, tiger hill is a silly name, you stand More chance of seeing a dodo than you do the mountain.In fact, avoid Darjeeling altogether, a smelly traffic jammed city, a blight on the mountain. Wise up proud people from India, why do you put up with such squalor?"
241,Excellent Kanchenjang view,The. Place. Actually a heaven. Was amazing.  Ww can c the. Whole Darjeeling. N  part. Of gantok. N sikkim as well. The temperature. Was. Giving. Afeel of heaven at 2 degree celsius. Gives. Ua touch. To take a cofee.  Amazing. Will visit again
242,Early morning trail... not worth,If anyone is fascinated with Everest then should try tiger hill. It's beautiful. From here we can see more clear view on mountains and most importantly Everest. But have to mention weather can be spoil sport. Weather changes dramatically. One moment it will be clear sky with beautiful view but next moment clouds will cover the ranges.
243,Luck Enough if you get to see Sunrise,"Tiger Hill is the closest point from which Mt. Kanchenjunga can be seen in its full glory. However, if the weather is dicey and the clouds block the view, it is advisable not to go there. This place attaracts a lot of tourists that leads to traffic jam and loss of travel time.…"
244,Too much hype but a dud,If the weather is bad there is no point at all in venturing out as the entire hill will be enveloped in a cloud and you will not even be able to see the sunrise leave alone the mountain. We were told that Oct and Nov are the best months. Also there is a lot of climbing so be careful.
245,Sunrise,People who have heard about Kanchanjunga during their school days might be excited to see it. I was so excited to see and I enjoyed watching sunrise and Kanchanjunga in the morning. The traffic is expected during rush morning hours due to congested road conditions. People who may not find out any excitement is watching something which is heard many times in the past may avoid travelling there. They will not find out anything special there.
246,Lottery,We followed previous posters advice and went at 10am on a clear day. It was amazing. Spent 2 hours absorbing the scene.  Managed to see Everest cleary but were told this is really not a common thing.
247,Nice View Point,"If you need to see something beautiful, brilliant, amazing and extraordinary, visit Tiger hills early morning. The view there during early morning is beyond words. Nothing can describe the view from Tiger hills, specially the early morning sun rise. It is just mermerising. All the colors of nature are so vivid, that one will never ever forget it."
248,MUST VISIT,"A 4.30 start still didn’t mean we were first to arrive but our guide did make sure his local knowledge gave us the best spot to see the sun rise over Kangchenjunga. The weather was very cold! 4 layers were barely enough to keep out the chill!, and the cloud kept us in suspense almost the whole time we were there.Thankfully they cleared on cue and we had the most magnificent views of the mountains. The highlight of our trip to Darjiling."
249,Listen to the locals re the weather!,"Watching the sunrise, spreading light over the Himalayan range is an absolutely fabulous experience. Make sure you wear warm clothes - it was pretty chilly when we were there in March. The coffee from the sellers, at IR10 for a small cup, was very welcome."
250,The summit,It was like ticking one of the item from your to do list. not worth especially if you get up early and start at 4:30am to see the sun rise. the road and traffic management very poor. the walk and the area to watch the sun rise very poor. the authority is building the sun rise observatory but the time will tell how good it is. if you are frequent traveler then you must have seen better and beautiful sun rise compared to tiger hill
251,Not worth a visit,"If you are lucky to get clear skies and atmosphere, you can experience this mesmerising beauty of nature. As sun rises, it lights up the entire area and provides grand view of Mt Kanchenjunga. Though the mighty mountain can be seen from other places and better too, but Tiger Hill has its own charm. If you are visiting Darjeeling, you should not miss it. The early rise is worth every penny!!"
252,Tiger hill,"It was a spell bounding experience, it could be only experienced rather than description.The Kanchenjunga peak was highlight of visit"
253,Tiger Hill,Whoa this is a waste of time in May. It was so clouded you could not see a thing. What made this an even worse experience was that you are in a traffic jam on the way at 4am and when trying to leave another traffic jam. The whole are a needs to be managed better.
254,Avoid if weather is cloudy,"When you visit to Darjeeling, a visit to Tiger Hill should be a Must. One has to wake up early & leave the hotel at about 4 AM.  The vehicles visiting at this place are parked in one row one behind another. So If you start late,your vehicle will be parked at longer distance from the Sunrise watching place & you will have to walk quite more distance on a steep road in the cold.You have to wait for sunrise. If can consider yourself  lucky if the atmosphere is clear & which indicate one can watch the rising sun.In instances of bad atmosphere, you are helpless.As the sun starts coming up, it is very thrilling to watch that moment. you can see the sun rays on Kanchenjunga peaks. One can see the distant Mount Everest peaks too. In such cold atmosphere, don't forget to taste boiling hot coffee at Rs 10/- being offered by local cheerful vendors."
255,Sunrise,"We got up super early at 4am, to beat the crowds up to tiger hill but unfortunately it was cloudy and we couldn’t see the sunrise. On the way back down the mountain there was absolute grid lock, only in India!!  Apparently Autumn is the best time to visit."
256,Superb,"The weather was bad ,very foggy and cloudy. Reached tiger hills at 4:30am waited until 5:35 but no sign of the sun. Returned back very disappointed."
257,Best Scene,"The tiger hill view that appears in this photograph will be visible only on clear days, especially in the early hours. We were unfortunate among many since the day we visited was cloudy."
258,Beautiful!,Amazing scene ...not be missed...of course depends on weather conditions...and one has to reach the spot by 4:30 am to witness this nature’s wonder
259,Did not match the hype,"If you are visiting darjeeling without tiger hill then your trip is incomplete. The view of kanchanjangha from tiger hill cn not be described , we were lucky enough because most of the time tiger hill is covered with fog , so before going there check the weather or ask your cab driver about the weather"
260,Fresh and indescribable experience,"You will be one among a 1000 people here at least. The crowd is crazy, so make sure you reach there well in time (Leave your hotel sharp at 4AM and you should be OK). If you're lucky and you have a clear sky, the view of the Kanchenjunga is stunning. Look far away and you can even see the Everest peak. So pretty"
261,Best sunrise if weather is with you,"The native speaking obnoxious tourists have ruined the tourism in Darjeeling and the neighbouring Sikkim. Littering, yelling, creating ruckus, spitting etc are a trademark of this lot that kills it for everybody. Tiger hill is a desolate, tourism unfriendly spot where people just congregate alongwith traffic snarls and honking. There are no railings, no plain surfaces or designated watching areas. Hopelessly dirty and un-inviting. Had a terrible experience as the govt. has paid zero heed to create any kind of tourism related infrastructure. Plz avoid."
262,Kanchanjunga,"Lying at an altitude of 2590 meters and a distance of 13 kilometres away from the Darjeeling, Tiger Hill is most famous for its splendid sights of the morning sunrise from where you can see the peaks of Kanchenjunga illuminate before the sun is seen at lower elevations. The magnificent view of snow - capped mountains sitting amidst cotton clouds attracts tourists to Tiger Hill from all over the country. Interestingly, this is also the summit of Ghoom, which is the highest railway station in the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.This vista point of Tiger Hill is a pristine natural beauty where you can enjoy the virgin charm of Darjeeling in its most endearing form. At sunrise, the peaks of Kangchenjunga are illuminated before the sun is seen anywhere else in the city, which is an amazing thing to experience. Another notable thing of beauty here is the pristine natural beauty of Tiger Hill, which is enveloped in gentle verdant foliage coupled with sublime clouds in the background. The fresh morning air as you make your way to the summit is a refreshing experience away from the banter of city life."
263,Superb Experience,A pre dawn start and a messy traffic jam at the top ( too many cars and not enough parking) forced a steep 30 minutes walk to the top. What a view though - on a clear day you can see forever and the Himalayan sunset was stunning. Unmissable experience!
264,Tiger Hill,"Have to get up early to get a good site at the top of the hill. We left Mayfair at 3:45AM, and were not the first people to arrive. It was cold and windy at the top until well after sunrise, but the view was magnificent! Kanchenjunga is well lit up before the sun comes up! The mountain has sun 20 minutes before Tiger Hill!"
265,it is chilling,"Spectacular spot for sunrise. Definitely crowded, so our taxi couldn't go very far up the hill. That meant we did a fair amount of hiking to get to the top of Tiger Hill. We were lucky to have a very clear day, so the views were breath-taking."
266,A natural phenomena,"Though the views are breath taking and the drive quite pleasant, there isn't much to do here especially because there isn't even a single place to sit. There is no washroom close by either. Really needs development given the major tourist pull this place has."
267,Look right in the eyes of Sun when its peeking,"It was a magical experience. I recommend you to reach there very early, else you will have to park your car down hill & walk all the way up. Also, most of the people would have taken the best places to stand. Ask the people there who are selling tea/coffee & take your place on the side where you can see the Mt. Kanchenjunga rather than the side of the sunrise. P.S. you can get the same view from many other places in the Darjeeling town itself, e.g. the Darjeeling railway station."
268,Nothing to see!,"... if it wasn’t so crowded. Wake up at 3:30 in the morning to go there in a procession of never ending cars. Thousands of people watch the sunrise on the Kangchenjunga, third highest mountain."
269,Best part of Darjeeling tour,"I first went to Tiger Hill as a child more than 60 years ago. I remember it as being very dark and very cold. But when the sun rose, the stunning image of golden pink Kanchenjunga was permanently etched in my mind. It was a wild, desolate spot with just a dozen old Jeeps and Land Rovers, a breathtaking silence under the stars.  Now, visiting it was different. There are hordes of people, shivering and crowding around. There are stalls with glaring lanterns selling gloves, hats, sweaters and other warm items for those who have not anticipated the cold or left behind such items. Vendors are selling coffee, trash is strewed down the embankments, plastic and foil litter is all over the place. The enthusiasm and patience of visitors is great though, given that they stand for nearly 2 + hours. Some sort of stadium seating would be of great help. When the sun rises and the cloud lifts- the sight of Kanchenjunga and Everest is magical. All else becomes irrelevant.One great new resource is to be able to google the weather forecast of Kanchenjunga itself. Though not foolproof (the clouds and fog can still be spoilers), one increases chances of sighting by a lot.Prepare to stand for a long time or else carry a folding chair, though you may not be able to stand right by the railing with those."
270,At sunrise,It was worth the effort to get up early and leave the hotel at 4.30am to be able to reach well in time and get a suitable spot to see the sunrise and the rays falling on snowclad Kunchenjunga mountain.Mesmerising sight.
271,Where is the TIGER... ??,"The most over-rated place that you can get to in the entire Darjeeling. It’s a hype created by the local tourist bodies. Firstly the place has no facilities, none at all. You need to get there early in the morning say around 4.30 to catch a 6 am sunrise - it’s a 40 minutes drive from the centre of the city and there you need to leave by 3.30-3.45. The cab operators are totally undisciplined and they just block the entire road, which means if you reach early you would be the last one to go back. This also means there is no way you can get out of there in case anyone happens to face an emergency situation. While up there, you do see a beautiful sunrise as the Kanchanjanga peak reflects beautiful orange glow from the rising sun. However, the point is that you can view this beautiful sunrise from any part of Darjeeling and you don’t have to come all the way to the top of tiger hill for this. I would suggest that you see the sunrise from any good spot in the city and probably visit the tiger hul peak during the day time for a beautiful view of the city."
272,Awesome ,"We started at 4:30 a.m and reached by 5:15 a.m , there are two spots for voewing Sunrise, one around a km before the main spot. I feel both points are equally good to see sunrise. Its a usual sunrise as we have seen at other place unless it is a Good Sunny day. In a good Sunny day one can witness Kanchenjunga peaks which is a feast to the eyes. That  is quite rare although."
273,Very poor facilities for the tourist.,"If you are holidaying in December, it is best to check the weather forecast before heading out to Tiger Hill as it takes approx. 5 hours from any resort to Tiger Hill and back as one has to leave early to beat the traffic and catch a spot to experience the first sun rays on the Kanchenjunga. We were there on a clear day but it was supremely cold (2 degrees). While we had multiple layers of woolens on us, it was clearly inadequate as the wind chill at that height was nasty!! A thick jacket and a blanket (if one can manage that) is required. In spite of the weather we got great views of the sunrise and the golden hue on the mountain! It was simply breathtaking. My advice is to not focus on taking too many photographs but just admire and soak in the majestic view. Some things are best viewed through the naked eye and not through a camera lens."
274,A Mesmerising View!!! ,"It was heartbreaking to see such a popular and top listed places in Darjeeling in such a bad condition. - No proper Management, No sign Boards- No way to reach to actual view point- Tea/Coffee Vendors catches you and they divert you to different places, where there is no safety railings. They will make you buy coffee even if you say NO multiple times. If you refuse, they pass mean comments.- Not recommended for elderly people as the tourist vehicles park really far from the view point."
275,Sunrise Point,"You might feel lazy and find it difficult to wake up early winter morning, trust me it is all worth it. When you see orange sun rays falling on snow capped mountain, it is just amazing."
276,A Must Visit Place,"We went there by 430 am and it was freezing. There is no place to sit, and one has to stand at least for an hour to get a nice spot for the sunrise. The views are good, if clouds don't spoil the show! We could catch a glimpse of Everest though."
277,Early morning point,"This place was no less than a crowded market. Everyone pushing and shoving, blocking the views. It was an unpleasant experience for us. There are better places in Darjeeling where you'd be able to see the sunrise in a more peaceful and civil manner. You have to get there by 4am because of all the traffic, and then you get stuck for hours trying to get out. If you've never seen a mountain, then maybe it would be worth it, but for me, this was an extremely annoying experience, and a waste of time and money."
278,fabulous experience,"That was absolutely beautiful. You have to take a car from your hotel around 3:30-4 oclock am, because you have to be there before the sunrise. The sunrise is beautiful, but a lot of people is there. So if you want to have a good place and good view, go earlier. Also your taxi…"
279,Good view,"A place on a hill top,around 30 km from Darjeeling and at a height of around 8500 ft.One must start from Darjeeling around 4 am to get a better position at the hill top for the majestic view of Kanchenjunga and Sun rise here.One big glass house is now coming up,once completed,it will be worth for public to seat and watch both Sunrise and glittering Kanchenjunga,the beauty of Nature."
280,"Good view, crowded","No doubt is the weather is clear, then this is a worthwhile trip, however if there is going to be cloud, do not bother. The top of the hill resemble a builders site, with barrels of burning stinking plastic rubbish. It does not even begin to meet the hype and we were advised that there are other places in Darjeeling where you can see the Himalayas when the weather is clear."
281,Overrated,"Admittedly we arrived in Darjeeling without any research on what to do. Our homestay suggested going to Tiger Hill for sunrise. Im not usually a fan of sunrises but this is worth it. However, it really is very busy so the experience is impeded by the crowds. There might be a better place.You can purchase coffee and some souvenirs/warm hats here."
282,Sunrise at Tiger Hill,"Wouldnt recommend it anymore. Lots of people, and having to wake up early in the morning. Not worth it. Better to see the sunrise from the viewpoint from the mall. We were lucky to stay at Little Tibet. We walked 100 metres at around 4:30 am and enjoyed the view."
283,Lucky View,"What a view we got, I can't forget. It was such a moment that I never want to forget. The top of the mountain peak was covered with ice, when sunlight fell on it,it became little pinkish..that was the perfect view. We were lucky that we could see it clearly."
284,"Beautiful but crowded, Sandkaphu or Tonglu would be much better","To reach the observatory hill is a daunting task. To wake up in the wee hours, esply if you have kids along and then the short cut through the dark path, just following the people in front of you assured that they too are headed for the same destination. Then finding the right spot. The under-construction building does give opportunity to all to have a clear view. You will soon realise that all this was worth when all of a sudden there is hooting and whistling among the crowd and there glows the Mighty Kanchenzunja with the first rays of the sun. The  beauty of the nature's splendour is that sun emerges after its magestic show on the mountain peaks and you don't have to strain your neck as which one to watch, the sunrise or the first rays casting magic spell on the snowclad mountains. If you are lucky enough then there are chances that you can spot the Mighty Everest as well, but it depends upon how clear the sky is. This is one of key attractions of Darjeeling but one can't miss this for sure"
285,Nice views if u r lucky,"We had risen at 4.30 to get to Tiger Hill in good time. When we arrived, still in the dark, already lots of people were there, having got there extra early to get the best viewing spaces. People kept arriving, and many climbed up onto the unfinished hotel structure to get better views. It was freezing cold and we had nearly 1.5 hours to wait till sunrise. Ladies were walking around with thermos flasks selling small cups of milky, sweet coffee. You heard them calling out coffee, coffee, coffee, coffeeeee! It was a very hazy morning, and at one point we realised that this sunrise was just not going to happen, so we made a quick exit, beating the crowds and passing numerous parked cars along the way down. We counted ourselves lucky to have got off in time. I am sure it would all have been worth it, had it been a clearer day. We did not allow ourselves to be too disappointed not having seen the sunrise but stopped off and had a lovely breakfast on our way back."
286,Sunrise at Tiger hill,Tiger hill is beautiful and worth getting up early for. It was busier than we expected but I would still recommend it.
287,Tick mark visit,It was 4:30am in the morning and you don't believe it there were thousands of people already on the tiger hill. And a lot of stalls to sell woolen wear on top of the hills. When there was sun rise all that we could see was people elated excited and capturing the sun rise in their mobile phones. It was very disappointing as it was toooooooooo crowded and  the stalls for selling stuff makes it more commercial. Not worth visit during the peak times. Try to visit during off time.
288,Overcrowded,"So it's January - the sun rises about 6.30 - it's a short drive to the lookout - there is no need to leave at 3.30am.  There's a crush of cars and vans at the end and the parking is chaotic.  We left town at about 5.45 once we saw the sky was clear (it wasn't at 4am) Driver dropped us off at the lookout by 6.15, cruising past all the parked cars who must have got there 2 hours earlier, and we strolled to a good vantage point. It was a bit overcast, it had snowed lightly - hundreds of people watched the sun rise through the clouds, cheered very loudly and then left ... without even watching the mountain range!  Too funny!  The snow turned a spectacular apricot as the sun's rays briefly bathed the mountains, and then the mists drifted across -  the floor show was over for another day. But I wouldn't have missed it for anything - it was so grand, and yet so ephemeral"
289,Tiger hills sunrise 4:30am,Overcrowded & mismanagement are the words I can describe my experience. It started way early at 3:30 in the morning with a mad rush of very large number going one after another to this hill top. It gets over crowded on the road that leads to top. People then needs to walk over one km on foot as it is not possible for car to go up further as their jam. There is no fencing or any protection for the crowd at the edge of the hill and it gets so crowded and dangerous that a simple mistake can create a big issue.Then most of the time sky is filled with clouds so you cannot see the magical Kanchenjunga. It was a total waste of time and money.
290,Wow factor in witness colourful Kanchenjunga ,"This is one of the only things I'll get up at 3am to do. You must get there by 4/4:30am to be able for your driver to get you to the top in time. You'll still have to walk the last 1/2 mile uphill to the viewing area (which there is a tower for viewing currently under construction at the top, which makes for a strange ""construction zone"" feeling to the experience. Weather is a key factor to enjoying this view. If it's cloudy, then you'll get nothing but a nice morning climb. If not, the view of the sunrise and lighting of Kanchenjunga range is stunning and moving. My only complaint is the number of ""hawkers"" who are trying to sell various items, but especially coffee! Their chants of ""coffee! coffee! coffee!"" almost ruins the experience, as they do not stop for the grand event of sunrise. It would have been a more emotionally moving experience if we could have just had a moment or 2 of silence from them when the sun peaks up at the horizon."
291,"Mesmerizing on a clear day, but could be disappointing on other days",Do not go here... crowded and waste place totally... not exactly a scenic place... so congested and busy... usually foggy also ... don’t get to see anything
292,Tough but amazing view.,"Yes, you will have to wake up at an ungodly hour to get there and yes, it will be crowded if you're there during any of the school holiday/long weekend times. But that first ray of sunlight hitting the Kanchenjunga peak and the pale white mountain scape in the pre-dawn light slowly turning golden is breathtaking.  On a clear day when you can see the entire Kanchenjunga range including a glimpse of Mt. Everest and some of the mountains in Bhutan ... it's a mountain lover's dream.  The experience is awesome - the cold, the wait, the stillness and even the (annoying) crowd pale against the panorama that lies in front ... just lose yourself in the beauty of the eastern Himalayan ranges and the crisp air."
293,Clear sunrise can amaze you,"Tiger hill is located 8,482 feet above sea level. Kanchanjunga ranges are visible from here and even we can see Mt. Everest from here if weather supports. Sunrise view is picturesque from tiger hill and everyone should visit here once in their life."
294,Early morning coffee in chilly winds to have glimpse of kanchanjunga,This was a disappointing experience for us as we woke up at 03:30 am in the morning and reached tiger hill before sunrise at 05:00am. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day and we could not get a view of the Kanchangunga... Its always advisable to check the weather situation before planning your travel to Tiger Hill
295,Heaven ,"Tiger Hill is located 11kms (6.8 miles) from Darjeeling town and above Ghum. It's the highest point in Darjeeling hills at an altitude of 8482 feet. The best season to see the dazzling snow covered peaks as the sun rises is between November to January. Summer seasons March to April is also a good time. For sunrise, you will need to start by 3:30am in the morning towards the watching tower by trekking to reach the spot by 4.15am. Some taxi drivers will insist that you start even earlier. There is a reason why. As you reach close to the summit, particularly during the high season there would be a long queue of cars. Hundreds of tourists come here every day for the sunrise view during the high season. As a result, you may have to walk uphill quite a bit as your vehicle may be parked much below the top. Peoples are taking position to watch the sunrise & eagerly waiting. Hundreds of cameras & mobiles’ are ready for shooting sunrise scenario. Morning sky, cool down environment & audience. First comes up thin golden rays from the eastern side from where sun will arise, by seeing the rays peoples voice starts. Now Sun starts arising from the back of the mountain with a very red golden sun look like a ball  & peoples started chiming & taking photos of the scene. Remember, if weather permits then you can enjoy the sunrise, weather can change anytime. The fog and the mist play a mystical game here all the time. They can come from nowhere and put a white blanket all around. So no one can guarantee a perfect sunrise view from Tiger Hill or from anywhere in Darjeeling. Tourists are able to see the sun after it has risen quite a bit in the sky and not when they want to see it rising over the horizon and spreading its multicolor hue on the snow capped peaks."
296,Red Shine || Golden Shine || Sun Shine,Leave the hotel by 3.30-3.45 tell the driver to drop you at the tiger hill and go down below and park. Right now the main observatory is under construction so we are dropped below the hill.  The earlier you go the better place you find and the driver cab go below too to avoid the jam later. As too many vehicles come later and the roads get jammed so you're stuck. The beauty is in observing the sky changing its colours and eventually the sun rising. Sunrise usually occurs around 4.40-4.50 am but it is almost half an hour before that you start seeing the lovely colours of the sky. Once the sun rises you can see the Kanchenjungha on the left too. It's a gorgeous sight to see the sky. It's a must to do activity in Darjeeling. We were very lucky to see this mind blowing sunrise. But if you're not lucky enough you might not see any sunrise due to clouds. Once you finish seeing the sunrise walk down to your vehicle at the earliest. The farther the vehicle is parked easier it is to leave else most likely to get stuck in the jam!
297,Sunrise in Tiger Hill a rare scene for traveller,The place was way too overcrowded even for the off season.The mountain ranges looked magestic and so did the sunrise!The experience could have been better if everything was a lot more organized and maintained
298,Great Sun Rise,"Yes, it’s early. Yes, it’s cold. Yes, it’s crowded. Really crowded. But when the pale pink light caresses the top of Kachenjunga... Well, I was alone in my wonder. Go. You must. And yes, you really can see Everest, too!"
299,Tiger hill,"As early as 4.30 AM There were quite a number  people from all walks of life waiting at Tiger Hill before even dawn could emerge there number had already swelled to hundreds.So it was a fantastic scene in complete darkness And in November month Sun obliged but before Him it was Kanchenjunga 3rd highest mountain of world  that stole the show.There was fascinating thrill  and cheering to Kanchenjunga. First view in morning , engulfed with golden pink shades marvelous beauty.."
