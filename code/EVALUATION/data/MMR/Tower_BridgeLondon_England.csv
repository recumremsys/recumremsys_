0,Must Visit,"Must do, such a great history and was pleased we could see it.  Such a big part of London and a must see."
1,Unexpected visit,Still one of the most iconic structures in London. It was an interesting visit about the placecand still makes me laugh about the Yanks buying the wrong bridge.
2,Lovely walks along the river,"Great little visit of one of London's most iconic buildings. Staff very friendly and it was so interesting to see the Victorian engineering and how it was built and operated. There are lots of steps but also lifts. You don't need much time - about an hour to see everything. The glass floor walk on the upper level takes some courage, even for those not afraid to step off the edge of the world!"
3,Amazing!,Truly a great experience seeing the iconic tower bridge . Historic and iconic building . Is a must see when in london
4,A truly great experience,"We had a lovely visit to Tower bridge. Lots of information on how it was built etc Great views through the glass floor. Interesting to look around the engine room. Not much else to it, took about 40 mins and kept the kids entertained. Reasonably priced and worth a visit"

10,Tower bridge glass floor must be experienced,"What a great visit. It was great to see well preserved historical engineering and able to  look at the internal construction and workings of that draw bridge.Added to that, the views from the 2 walkways around the city and to the river below (through the glass floors) are well worth it. Educational and interesting. Excellent vale and highly recommended."
11,Amazing,Great experience to see how Tower Bridge works. Wonderful views over Thames. We combined with a Momument Ticket
12,Worth the money ,"Such cool architecture and history. It is a beautiful bridge for photos and very enjoyable to walk across. We also did the tour, which is cool for a different view of the city and a look inside the towers."

14,Interesting,"The Tower Bridge is iconic and a must see, very impressive to see up close.  We enjoyed the tour, walking around the grounds and seeing the Crown Jewels."
15,The glass walkway is brilliant. Waving to pedestrians below you quite surreal.,"Visiting this bridge very often, it is one of the most beautiful building in London.We absollove it with my husband. You can go inside as well, it is cheap can look around within an hour or so, I think it worth the visit.I have taken hundreds of pictures of it, if I am there I just have to take a picture. It is beautiful especially in a sunny day."
16,Bridge,Beautiful and really a go see when you have the time. Well worth your time and historically so interesting.

20,The Tower Bridge over The Thames,Really amazing to see the detail and beauty of something built so long ago! We walked it and also went under it by boat...just lovely!
21,Well worth a visit,It’s one of London’s most iconic landmarks. We got a great view of it from a boat on the river on a gorgeous sunny day.
22,First Time in London,Great visit and reflects the spirit of Love and satisfaction.London is an amazing city and it should be visited many times
23,Brilliant bridge,"Probably the most iconic building of London, with a crowd of tourists but however a lovely place that you will not miss."
24,Magnificent landmark ,This one is definitely a must see when visiting London. My family and I have been amazed discovering it. Absolutely wonderful on a sunny day!
25,Very nice,A highlight to a visit to London. The bridge is great to take photos on - there are also great views of the Thames and HMS Belfast from the bridge. Also take photos of the bridge from the riverside.
26,Suddenly historical,Great historical tour of an engineering marvel. It was worth to see the glass floors and the great views. Nice to see the history
27,Iconic Location,"Really enjoyed our visit here. Pretty cheap to enter on the day (10.20).Amazing history to read/see on the way up-beware as there are lots of stairs to climb (obviously).Views from the top are beautiful. There are points where you can open the windows to take photos.The glass floor is a great addition, as is the mirror on the ceiling to get a selfie shot.Entrance price includes the engine room which unfortunately we didn’t have time to do.Would recommend and visit again to show the kids."
28,Lovely little visit ,A nice trip to this place. Was close to Tower of London and the HMS Belfast warship; we covered all three together after lunch. We had the London pass and hence did not have to wait in a long queue. The overall experience was good with nice afternoon sunshine. It was not very crowded inside the bridge and hence lot of time to click pictures. The demo of how the bridge works covered in a separate place was informative.
29,Nice place to visit.,One of the things that makes you proud to be British and is an incredible piece of historical architecture.
30,A balanced mix of bridge and tower,One of my favourite spots in London. The iconic towers of the bridge although it rarely gets open.Fantastic views both sides of the river.You can go up to one of the towers but there's really no need.Spectacular sunset and sunrise for photography.
31,What a bridge!!,This is a must see in London! Very great photo opportunities and the location is prime for the perfect view!
32,"Although it was a while back our visit, nothing has changed.",I think the best historical place to see London. I loved . Bridge is fantastic I would definitely recommend.
33,Just Beautiful,"Always a lovely experience to take friends from abroad too. It's nice to cross the bridge, we didn't see any ships this time to see it open but once you cross over going to visit the tower of London. Is awsome"
34,Einer meiner Lieblingsorte in London.,"Beautiful place, I recommend going there. A must see during your visit to london.  There are red buses on the bridge"
35,Short & sweet ,"Tower Bridge is a great place for pictures and a must see when in London, I'd recommend visiting Tower of London first and then upon exiting the tower you arrive at the banks of the Thames and wonderful views of the bridge"
36,Always a good experince,"Tower Bridge is one of the best landmark I love in London, The bridge itself looks very rigid and engineering. That's why I love it. ON the other hand, you can walk along the bridge to cross the River Thames. Of course, you can also walk to the top of tower. Then you can see both side of the River Thames. I strongly suggest to walk the tower at the night. You can see beautiful night view of London.A must for every tourist in London, this iconic attraction never fails to disappoint and it certainly delivers when seen in person. It is worth walking across the bridge as it offers great views and the glass floor is incredible! It is conveniently located near Tower Hill and Tower Gateway stations so it is easily accessible.There are a lot of information about the bridge when you walk up to tower. You can also see the bottom of the bridge because there is a transparent glass floor on top of the bridge. It's a nice experience for sure."
37,Mrs Davies & her bridges,It's a different landmark and can see the whole of the river thames. Definitely worth a visit if you're visiting London
38,Amazing,This was a fantastic experience to find out some information about one of our capials landmarks and get great views of the city.Friendly staff and the glass walkway was great.An interesting museum too.Would definitely recommend.
39,Worth the climb,"Amazing, really good attraction to visit for all age groups. Good value for money. Glass walk ways are a true test of how daring you are."
40,Brilliant Experiance,Iconic and a must see part of London-grear views down the river on both sides of the bridge taking in the city landscape
41,Great tour,"Walking thorugh Tower Bridge is a great experience, ableto see the inner workings of the bridge is good. A must see for anyone visiting London"
42,Love this bridge! ,"it is a must see for any person coming to london for tourism of for worksights were amazingit was a rainy day but we did not care, lovely memories"
43,Different,Read about it’s history - check out the Tower Of LondonCross the bridge and get a feel for London of old
44,Impressive piece of Architecture,A stunning landmark with great views to be had of it and its surroundings. Covid measures are in place but there are many idiots who believe the arrows and directions don't apply to them. Please don't be one of those idiots.
45,Wouldnt recommend,"This bridge crosses the River Thames and this impressive piece of architecture i have seen in London. Recommended use ferry and cable car which is great experience,Down the road their are some nice restaurant to enjoy various cuisine."
46,Awesome View,After my father received Freedom of the City of London in 1979 we decided to visit Tower Bridge and its workings including the below ground balance. I have just visited the 2020 Tower Bridge Exhibition and what an excellent experience and amazing customer team. You will enjoy two glass walkways and lots of sliding glass windows allow you to take perfect pictures whatever the weather. If you don’t want to use stairs there are two lifts to get easily up or down.Many of the screens had alternative languages and I saw tourists using them.The team work hard to deliver excellent customer service and are very proud of their jobs. Pay a visit to the souvenir shop and you won’t be disappointed
47,Tower Bridge is one of the spots that you can't miss.,"Beautiful bridge over Thames. Beautiful and monumental. Something that is worth seeing. If you are in London, don't skip this."
48,Tower Bridge,Amazing and iconic bridge in London. This is a must see. Even better from the Tower of London or on a river cruise. We did both.
49,I fell over,"One of the most beautiful bridges of London, and definitely the most iconic. A must see of the city, and specially if you are there for a very short time."
50,Tour,"Tower BridgeOne of the must see things when you go to London, everything about it is spectacular, it's appearance, the engineering, the history behind it.The elevated walkways are a accessed via a stairway, there are 206 steps up so be warned and due to current covid regulations you must wear a mask at all times whilst indoors.... there is a lift available for those that can't manage the steps.Once you're on the walkway and taken in the view along the Thames you come to the glass floor where you can look down to the road deck and the Thames flowing beneath your feet, bit of a leap of faith stepping on to it if you have no head for heights but well worth it... hers's a tip, if you're with someone who is a little nervous of stepping on it and you finally persuade them to, don't give them a little nudge. I thought Mrs Davies was going to murder me much to the amusement of others in the area, so just don't (Sorry Mrs Davies)"
51,lovely view,"I think it’s the looking and beautifully built bridge in the world , for sure in Uk . It gives you very good feeling when you walk on the bridge .👏👏"
52,Lovely,The self tour of this iconic bridge was much better than even I dared hope!  Plenty to see and pleanty to learn.  The high walway over the bridge with the glass floor is litterally the high point!
53,Inspirational,"Old and historic bridge. Great old design, close to Tower of London. Fantastic atmosphere over the Thames river. New buildings both sides. Great!!!"
54,Great friendly staff!,"Best looking bridge ever seen, definitely worth a visit and some food markets beside it at the weekends. Great area and great photo opportunity"
55,Iconic Landmark,An obvious destination on a trip to London but it is still extremley impressive when your up close to appreciate the size
56,Nice bridge ,"Would absolutely recommend visiting here if your doing the touristy bits of London. Great experience, staff are super knowledgeable and friendly.Lovely views and very interesting.Glass floor is amazing and it's cool to see the bridge being raised."
57,Iconic ,"Our school group went on one of cruise lines that travelled down the Canal and speaks about the history of the building down the canal. The final stop is the tower bridge, however you do get to see the original structured the London bridge !Beautiful site to see ! Rain or shine !"
58,Brilliant!,"It's the most iconic bridge in our city, known all over the world. Rarely open these days but the mechanism is in full wotking order. Glass walkway on the top worth climbing up to."
59,Beautiful place,Due to the current situation we had this wonderful piece of engineering history to ourselves. The staff are very well informed and take the time to tell you about the bridge and it’s history. We felt extremely safe and you are missing a treat if you don’t go now.
60,Great if you like heights ,A must see for all visitors.  A lovely piece of history and architecture that adds to city ambience and culture.
61,Night time,"But interesting just the same, go inside and read about the building and history, it really is fascinating.  Just to walk across the bridge is an experience in itself."
62,A Sunday at the Tower,Was fantastic to walk over the top of tower bridge we’re there is a glass path to walk over to look down upon the rest of the bridge and river. A must do !!!
63,"Iconic, must walk through it","It is the most remarkable and the most beautiful bridge in London. Go and see it and then walk down to the Millenium bridge, the view of people passing by will show you the speed of life in London."
64,Brilliant,We spent over an hour here and with the London Pass got fast access to ticketing.  Loved the engine room and walking along the top of the bridge where you can see the traffic below - can be a bit daunting for those scared of heights.  Quite a lot of detail if you look for it on the bridge itself.
65,Exciting  historical  place ,"A truly great experience for only £10. Now is the time to visit London, all covid safe and no queues. Done the tour of Tower Bridge only 6 people on it, walked the glass floor was lucky enough to be there when the bridge opened and filmed a Tall ship passing underneath the glass floor, watched it close and the cyclists race across, brilliant. Howard was a great tour guide very informative and humorous."
66,"Spectacular, cultural and informative ",This attraction is a must when visiting London. It's located in a paceful area sorrounded by restaurants and stores. We spent the afternoon walking around and taking photos. Very nice.
67,Worth it,"Walked across this iconic bridge, then the next day went under it on a Thames river boat. It is a wonderful piece of Victorian engineering, sadly I never witnessed it opening . Walked across from City of London side to walk along River towards London Bridge, stopped off at 'The Draft House' pub for good food and real ale."
68,A must see part of your London experience,This is such a well known London landmark that it is worth photographing from either the riverside or up close.  When you cross it on the bus you can see all the river also but the desigh and appearance of this bridge is amazing to see.  Well worth a visit.
69,A classic icon of London,The bridge is a must go and so we did go there! We walked on it and looked at it from both sides of the river - loved it!
70,A must do!,"I mean, yes it is just a bridge, a cool one.  The architecture is interesting and ornate. Watching larger boats go under it where it raises and lowers its platform."
71,London BRIDGE🚇,"Wonderful feeling, I really felt astonished by this building, modern and old together are something unique..."
72,Tower Bridge,"Breathtaking view, every time I visit I take away a new experience.  As for the workings of the bridge and the history behind it, that's a story for another day.  The whole experience takes you back in time. A visit is highly recommended"
73,Easily London's most ostentatious bridge,"If there was ever a classic bridge to see ,this was it ,well worth seeing in person as photos do it no justice .Majestic describes it perfectly"
74,a classic in plain view,"We was walking along this beautiful riverBridge ,we enjoyed it. The Tower Bridge its amazing and unic in that area of the city.it is worth to see it..."
75,Take a walk across,"Ive dreamt of going london for years (i live in england too), biggest part for me about london was the bridge as its so unique, for me not a 5 star as itd have to be absolute amazing for me to do 5 (as im picky) but its definitely 4 (maybe 4.5) underground is about 5 or so mins walk but feels an enternity when you're so wanting to get there but when you do its so surreal, brilliant scenery, loved it"
76,Big monument.,"This is another stop on the Hop on Hop off Bus.  Amazing architecture, history, and views.  A lot of stair climbing and walking is involved, so those with mobility concerns should take that into consideration before attempting this attraction.  The hosts are friendly and knowledgeable.  Check for discounts.  Combine to see the Tower monument for a reduced price.  We chose that option.  You can see the former engines that raised/lowered the bridge in bygone days.  Have fun lying on the glass walkway over the road beneath and taking a picture in the mirror overhead. Points of information are found along the way, along with a suggested route to follow.  This event is self-guided.  There is a gift shop, and toilets.  There are views, too, such as of the Monument tower, HMS Belfast, and the Thames.  Fascinating and interesting architecture.  Fun!  Wear comfortable shoes.  It was very windy when we went.  Gusts prevented small children from moving forward."
77,Nice Bridge,"It will be as you expect, it's a bridge. It's in good form and the modern surrounding make look nice, good selfie place"
78,A good monument to visit,"It's a historic landmark, but also just a bridge. Not much more too it. There is some sort of tour or guided explanation you can get, but my friend and I never tried it."
79,TOWER BRIDGE & THE MONUMENT,"A wonderful landmark. It’s always busy, with lots of people taking selfies. Lovely restaurants along the riverside with wonderful views of the bridge at night"
80,Beautiful by night,It is one of the iconic bridges in London and a must see place when you visit London. It has historic importance as well. The view is amazing and there are many nice restaurants near by. The famous Tower of London is adjacent to it.. Its a toutist spot and a very food place to visit..At night the bridge looks even more splendid and mesmerizing.. A must see for all the travel lovers!
81,London's iconic bridge,"Was crossing the bridge when I thought there is a museum on here somewhere which always looked busy, but at present so quiet we took the opportunity and went in. Well worth the visit especially the glass floor and don’t forget to look up for that extra thrill. Great bit of history for London and the restoration of the boilers and and pistons looked amazing. Well worth the time and hold work up the steps, but there is a lift available if needed."
82,Day out,This is a beautifully constructed bridge. We went in summer and the walk over the bridge was lovely and it is near a Starbucks so you can enjoy a hot or cold drink with a beautiful view of the bridge.
83,Landscape is amazing,"It is a very interesting place. One can walk along the bridge and get a view of the Thames on both directions and one can go up to the upper level and again get a view of the Thames in both directions. To go up to the upper level there is an entry fee. Here in the upper level one gets to know the history, geography and architectural background of the bridge from the exhibits and a short documentary. One gets a view of the river water from a glass floor. This part is very exciting. ""London- Life around the Thames"". Know more at Papumashi the Nomad."
84,Beautiful landscape,Great place to visit and excellent value for money.  I booked tickets via my hotel  and paid £8 more than on the door. Don't make the same mistake. Buying tickets in advance does not get you in any quicker and costs more.
85,Trip back in time,"A very nice sight in London, you can use it to walk over to the over side of the river themes... otherwise it’s a nice place to go sightseeing"
86,stunning!,"I have visited the Tower Bridge of London many times and every time you can find something new.As a photographer I also looked for ways to capture it from far away and also close. If you get to the basement where you can see the old engines room and the pistons, that is so impressive to study.Also check the official website for precise days and times when the bridge 2 halves open. That is a unique view."
87,London's bridge of bridges,"Saw this bridge in a music video that inspired me to come to London. I was not disappointed! It was a short 15 minute walk from our hotel at the Doubletree by Hilton. You enter the bridge underneath through stairs, free of charge. Bridge is not long, prolly about a 20 min walk. Very windy so grab a coat, and its very busy with cars and tourist. At times the bridge will open up for ships to pass, there are gates and guards that patrol the bridge when that happens, very safe. On the corners of the bridge are people with stands selling caramelized peanuts for 2 pounds. They were hot & delicious. We walked the bridge everyday, my favorite times were in the early morning and at night on our way back from touring.There is a walkway near the bridge along the river, where you can take some amazing shots in the daytime with the bridge in the background. No people hassling you for anything here unlike the other tourist spots. This was definitely one of my highlights visiting London."
88,WAlking tour/DIY,Classic London icon. It’s a bit quieter at the moment but will worth a visit and a selfie (everyone else does!)
89,"Impressive, it left me speechless",Amazing to take a walk through. Very close to Shard and Tower of London. The best part about London is the connectivity which enables you to travel almost everywhere in just 25 pounds
90,A rainy visit to the bridgge,.....go into the actual engine bridge. We were fascinated by this place. So much history and a quite remarkable bridge. I think kids might find it a bit boring though.
91,just a bridge,Tower Bridge is one of the Londons iconic landmark. Beautiful old bridge that opens up on regular basis. Bridge can get busy with traffic and tourist. Its free to walk on bridge and enjoy the view of surrounding.Highly recommended
92,Engineering marvel well worth a visit,"By far one of the best views of London. The area surrounding the Tower Bridge is lovely. One of the most photographed places in the world...for a good reason. If in London, it's certainly worth visiting!"
93,As imagined,We went across the bridge. We also went under the bridge on a cruise. Great architecture very pretty.
94,Very nice view,Visited before London went on lockdown and had it almost to ourselves. Amazing guide I think his name was Barney. Found the whole experience so interesting and went straight through to see the Crown Jewels. Cafe on site for drink and sandwich. Would definitely recommend and good value.
95,fantastic,What an experience - this is very much a left to your own device tour but its great especially if you have kids. Its a long walk up the steps but the views at the top are amazing and the glass floor....endless fun....make sure you go on to the engine room and the gift shop was possibly the best we visited in London!! - Go!
96,Mohammed Arjomandkhah,Awesome place for family pictures. You selfie crazed people would love it here. Perfect walk after lunch and a great place to grab a coffee or ice cream off a truck in the area. Must See
97,An impressive bridge,irs a must visit if u go to London! Amazing views and pics! You can visit by foot or even cross ir by car or bike
98,"Make sure you do this, it’s a great experience. ",Absolutely stunning views from the bridge and amazing architecture even when it’s cold wet and windy you need to pay it a visit
99,The best bridge,wonderful visit to an iconic attraction. spectacular views from st katherine's dock on the east side of the bridge. definitely worth a visit.
100,Just a great view i get from there,"This is by far the prettiest bridge in London and it is well worth seeing.   We did not buy a ticket to go up to the top, only because it was closed when we were there but I wish we had."
101,Beautiful bridge,One of Londons most photographed landmarks The Tower Bridge.   We recommend viewing from both sides of the river to see it in all its glory.  If you are lucky you may see it open for a big ship like we did.
102,Gorgeous bridge,"We took a walk over it on the way back to the tube. It's a remarkable bridge and definitely iconic! It's even more beautiful at night. Also get some lovely views of this bridge from the Tower of London, which was a nice bonus!"
103,Excellent,I love looking at this stunning bridge from London Bridge! But walking across it is equally amazing. There are great places to visit on either side and as a Londoner (or not) it is a must do!
104,Such a heritage,Even more beautiful in person. Had a lovely blue color and quite windy with the vehicles driving through quickly. I went during the weekday so wasn't crowded at all and got some great shots.
105,Superb experience to look down on the bridge as it opens up,London in pictures is known by tower bridge. and I wanted to be here on day 1. It was great experiencing standing and getting clicked.
106,Not as old as I thought,What a great visit. Wonderful to walk across this iconic bridge at street level - but to go inside and get a glimpse of the incredible structure with such  amazing views from the walkways is just fantastic. Highly recommended.
107,Historic Bridge ,Got a discount on. The door because I live here in London. Worth a visit. Like the glass floor. Some great views
108,Great Landmark,"This bridge is a must visit! It’s beautiful to look at and even better to go inside. We didn’t see it lifting but the craftsmanship and her beauty of the building is just breathtaking! Go inside, it’s reasonable. Take some pics on the glass floor. Really enjoyed it. The whole surrounding area has a fab vibe."
109,Iconic place,You will be amazed by the size of this tower bridge! 🙂 It is huge! Definetly a must when in London.
110,Great Sight!,It's the symbol and you cannot miss this! view from Tower of London shore side is amazing! stroll along the river to admire the iconic view!
111,Very cool bridge,"Something you have to do when in London, quite a few stairs to climb but lovely views.  Glass floors not for the faint-hearted but you can avoid these if you walk on the edge."
112,Beautiful!,"A must do, it’s very busy by midday, if looking for a great snap angle, we opted to shot from below as there are a few quieter areas or perhaps get there early. Chilly and windy in March."
113,Great guide,"To be able to say we walked over the legendary landmark, and witness the bridge being raised; love it"
114,Not London Bridge But Actually The Tower Bridge,Worth the visit and walk over to read all about the history. Accessible for prams and wheelchairs with lifts each side
115,Tower bridge to London bridge,We walked across Tower Bridge which gave great views of the river and other landmarks nearby. Historic place
116,Emblematic,"My son and I really enjoyed this tour. There was so much to take in! Yeoman Warder Gary Burridge was HILARIOUS, but EXTREMELY knowledgeable. The time just flew by!"
117,Good not Great,"We had a great time visiting the famous bridge and enjoying its upper level with the glass floors (and the partial mirrors above).There was a 5-minute queue to get the tickets, but it was worth it.Included with the ticket is entry to the nearby Tower bridge museum, which is a lovely addition that explains the mechanics behind the bridge."
118,Bridge Tour was OK,"What an icon of London. Such over the top Victorian masterpiece. Be sure to pay to go inside and see how it all works, its worth every penny."
119,Great view but long lines,"Very interesting, lots to see and learn. Haven't taken the childryen yet but will do. Some of the ques are quite long, but I guess that's to be expected."
120,The Icon,Took my daughter on a day out to London  we walked over it and took in the view of the river from both sides.It's very impressive and old but a must see Landmark of London.Doesn't take long to walk over one side and back along the other
121,Tower bridge,So much more interesting than I thought. Beautiful views across London and looking down to the busy street below is incredible. Great guides especially Lovely Sue! Huge amount of historical info in the engine rooms. Well worth a visit.
122,Something London can be proud of it.,"The Tower Bridge is a must when you visit London. It is beautiful and the views around the river Thames are really lovely, especially on a sunny day! You can also visit the bridge towers, if you want."
123,A beautiful walk,"Iconic pictures, Instagram worthy. Go the southern side of Thames for great pictures. Also try the walk on south bank"
124,night views of the bridge,"I have visited London many times and passed under the bridge on a boat, this time I decided to go over the bridge. I took the stairs to the top, which although tiring was worth it. The walk across the glass floor was great, looking down to the road and river below. Continued from the bridge into the Engine room which was also interesting and it was good to see that the old machinery has been well looked after.Read a lot of interesting facts while on the visit"
125,Must do,"The Bridge is so cool as it is historical. Huge people, multi culture, multi color, multi language - everything has touched me brightly. I have walked under and over the bridge regularly while I was in Tower Hotel. In other side, water is very dirty and sometime smell was also very bad. It hurt me!"
126,Tower Bridge of London,"This is (I think) one of London's most beautiful bridges, and with our Travelcards, we were able to get two for one tickets to climb up the North Tower and walk across the upper level walkway. It is enclosed, so weather is not an issue, and there are small windows that open that allow you to get amazing pictures up and down the river. We went at night, so the city was lit up; it was beautiful. There is also part of the floor that is glass, so you can see the road and the river underneath you. We also went just down the road a bit to see the Engine Room and learn more about the history of the bridge and the people who worked it every day. It was fascinating and well worth the extra time. Walking back across the lower level of the bridge (street level) rounded out the visit nicely. This was a very cool stop."
127,My favourite part of the trip,Good trip on. A tower of big history  from years  ago to the present day  from a prison if I am right to a tourist attraction
128,Nigh time lights!,"Whether you’re into your architecture, engineering or London’s history I would recommend visiting Tower Bridge. Learn about London’s magnificent bridge and what it took to build it and keep it running. Also how it’s been modernised for 21st century working."
129,Cool Architecture,"We were staying near Victoria and caught a local bus to here, on getting onto the bridge we saw you could go up to the top and as it was quiet you didn't need to book, it was a great workout for the legs getting to the top and once there you could either walk across the glass panel or round it. Was good to maybe pass an hout"
130,Review of tower bridge,we went on the BUG BUS TOUR which went round london and also over tower bridge which was a fabulous experience
131,Nippy day with moonshine,The tower was beautiful to look at but was a rather disappointing tour.  If you are interested in bridges this would be great otherwise it's just a walk across the bridge - twice.
132,Lovely visit,"It is the most beautiful bridge in London.  Just not far away from Tower of London, we visited the Tower bridge while on our way to The  View from The Shard. A well iconic  landmark of London. We exchanged the ticket with our London passes and took the life to the top of the bridge. Along the corridor of the bridge, we saw photos that showing the construction of the bridge and its progress. Also the view from the small glass at the top was breathtaking. We slowly walked to the other side via the glass walkway. Very nice experience to walk on top of the glass."
133,Merry Ole England,"Yep, title says it all. A busy bridge over a river, but it’s scenic, it’s clean, it has history. You feel safe most of the time, as much as you can in this day and age, and there’s some great touristy photos to be taken."
134,Great experience to see how Tower Bridge work,We went there in October with our 14 and 12 year old kids. Great views and an interesting experience in the towers and the museum bit afterwards.Took loads of photos and we enjoyed the visit and the walk from the tube to get there. One of the most interesting and great value for money experiences in London. My tip is to buy the combined ticket with the Monument to the Great Fire of London as well as it’s only another £5 and also worth doing.
135,Iconic bridge,Took a tour of the bridge.  The views from the top of the bridge were great and the glass walkway provided some excellent photos.  Would have liked to have learned more about the history surrounding the bridge
136,Experience the inner workings,Obviously this is incredibly iconic which makes it worth checking out aside from any other Merit. It is a beautiful structure. Entering it and going across the structure at the top is worth it. The see-through glass floors are pretty cool and the view at Sunset over the river is unbeatable.
137,Beautiful Bridge! Lovely walk across it!,"This is probably the most famous bridge in the world. Offers great views, presents history of the bridge and shows how it works (including old engines). Without doubts the Tower Bridge is worth visiting."
138,Impressive Victorian engineering and splendid views,"Cold and miserable in the winter but during the summer it's quite a nice place to see, always a busy area but a nice place connecting to the London Underground. Easy access and easy to find a location of some of the top attractions nearby."
139,Overhyped,"The walkways and engine rooms of Tower Bridge are one of the more hidden London attractions but is definitely worth a visit! The experience starts on the walkways. Each walkways provides views of either West or East. Information about other famous bridges and the history of Tower Bridge itself. These were well placed and I learned a lot about the bridge from these. Each walkway also has a glass floor allowing you to look down to the road below. These can get busy at times but are an experience to be had. On the middle floor of the South Tower are a few items from the Bridges past and the structure is clearly visible. The engine rooms immerse you into the story and showcase amazing Victorian engineering. It might not sound like much but overall, a fantastic place to visit while looking for something to do."
140,Visit it at night!,"It’s not just the bridge, it’s the whole surrounding. The amazing view of river Thames and it’s boats, the Tower of London and if you lucky enough to go on top, you can see a glass through of the view of what’s below you and amazing city of london including view of the Shard."
141,I left a peice of my heart here!!!!,"This was cool to see, but not to drive on. Was stuck in it during rush hour traffic and it moves slowly. Besides that, it’s cool to see a structure built like this. It’s a nice historic backdrop to the ever growing modernization of London. Has 2 walking paths and tickets to buy."
142,A night visit,An instant identifiable landmark of London. We stayed at the towers hotel and our room had a view of the bridge. It was impressive but looks so much better at night when it's all lit up. Not so sure about the blue lights under the arch though.
143,Best as ever,One of my favourite landmarks in London. Best way to enjoy it is by taking a cruise on the Thames. There are plenty of different ones here.
144,Taking in the sights ,"As a south Londoner, it has taken me near on 50 years,after coming back to UK to visit this iconic landmark. We felt it was a bit touristy, but the overall experience was absolutely brilliant.  Looking at how the bridge was built and  understanding the rigors of the construction was enlightening. Then to be able to walk over the top section, which is now a glass floor was somewhat creepy, but very invigorating.Even the engine room display at the South end was interesting.Can't recommend this event more highly"
145,Don’t just walk over....,We walked Tower Bridge at night and it was incredible We felt safe and it was easy to navigate on and off Truly spectacular views. Highly recommend
146,Must see in London,This was an enjoyable tour of London’s Tower Bridge which included a walk across the upper level part of the bridge. This walkway had a glass portion of the floor allowing you to feel suspended in air.
147,The symbol of our city,Sadly closed for the coronavirus but Tower Bridge remains a magnificent sight dominating the River Thames at the Pool of London. It’s all takes in a fascinating mechanisms make Cowbridge one of the engineering marvels of the Victorian era. Specially worthwhile is the view on the bridge bridge adjoining the two bascules which now has a glass floor which is probably not as terrifying as one might think watching pedestrians and traffic shuttle along beneath.
148,Best Bridge ,"This is my favourite bridge of all, and this week I was able to actually go inside.  The staff were really friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the building of the bridge, but there is also information about this and videos as you walk along the bridge.  You also get great views of London."
149,Very pretty,"This is good value and 2 of 3 of my kids loved it, the other not so keen on the glass floor but still gave it a go. Tip: we went in at 9am and there was no queue whatsoever, when we went past again after at 10 the queue was round the block, so get there early"
150,Interesting trip with history and laughs,"Amazing!  We didn't take the tour but we walked the bridge slowly, enjoying the sites and taking in the beautiful people that were doing the same!  Don't forget to get a serving of hot-candied nuts while walking across"
151,Tower bridge ,I’m watching the WebCam for a month before we came to London know we only we had a few days to get everything done that we want to get that we stayed in hotel right near the bridge absolutely love the area convenient to everything very fun.
152,Interesting history and gorgeous architecture!,"The iconic bridge, everyone snaps a pic keeping this in background which yells 'I went to London!'. Tower bridge is way more than that. Unless you do the tour, you are really missing something. Some attraction tours are tourist trap, this is not!"
153,Great experience,Beautiful views especially with the sun out during my visit.  This is the first time I've walked the Tower Bridge.
154,Remarkable,Nighttime is just amazing. Wouldn’t recommend crossing in the wind. Beautiful views along the Thames we stayed at the Hilton and it just looked amazing in daylight too.
155,Review,"The most famous and unique of London's bridges over the River Thames, and the city's iconic symbol. Lots of cafes, pubs, restaurants in the area, and some street performers."
156,Fab attraction,"One of the more iconic things to look at when you're near the River Thames. It is fairly hard to miss and quite a nice sight, particularly at night. We were only able to admire it from a distance but it does look quite majestic. the surrounding area also has quite a lot to see and do and it was a nice walk along the Thames on both sides of the river.We didn't go in so can't say how interesting it was nor were we able to walk across it (perhaps the next trip) but worth the visit nonetheless."
157,Monumental and beautiful ,What an impressive bridge! You tour through and go to the top of the bridge and you can See the city! They have glass in the floor so you can see the river and traffic beneath you! they also have an engine room and explain how the bridge was built and how it operates!
158,Super Views ,Even though is quite crowded the landscape that you can see is quite amazing and the design of the bridge is quite unique
159,Like in the past...,"From the Bridge Theatre, there are wonderful views of the bridge - and you can enjoy a theatrical production as well!"
160,Impressed,"I loved it, it seems spectacular to me. I have always seen it on TV or in photos and when I have seen it live I have not been disappointed. Crossing it and taking photos made me excited. We were also lucky that it was sunny. What more could you want? A must visit if you are in London."
161,A must selfie,Take the Thames River cruise that may come with your Hop On Hop Off ticket. It's magical seeing a timeless destination
162,Wonderful view along the river,"Amazing to see and learn how they constructed this bridge. If you have a fear of heights you might not love the glass floor, if your brave enough you get a sticker to wear saying you did it!"
163,Most beautiful Bridge in the world,"Lot of people. We walked for about an average of 7 miles during our stay in Central London. It’s a must to visit land mark, I think."
164,"Do the tour, dont just take a photo as backdrop","Steeped in history, this a good way to spend a couple of hours. How they built it was a marvel and full of interesting facts. The stairs are a killer but there is a lift if you need it"
165,Acutally saw it open . How good was that.An,Personnel was friendly & helpful.  Engine room was very interesting to see how it worked and history of all
166,Very nice views.  ,"If you are a tourist in London you must visit the London Bridge, so be prepared to see a lot of visitors every time of the day!"
167,Must visit! ,I do like this kind of architecture! I really like go there when is night when the lights are turn on is magical!
168,Beautiful,On a winters evening we dined at gauchos on other side of Terri we and our view of this iconic land mark was stunning!!I’ve never seen the bridge at night and so glad I’m we got the opportunity to see it in all it’s glory.Makes you so proud to be British having these beautiful sights in our doorstep
169,Must see,It is one of the most beautiful bridges that i’ve ever seen and there are great food stalls near it and it has a great view there
170,Touristy but the best part of the trip,As a London Taxi driver I have driven over Tower Bridge thousands of times wondering how it worked . Well now I know . We booked tickets on line to save queuing which worked well . It was a great insight to walk up inside this fantastic piece of architecture and learn how it was built . The exhibition is laid out very well with the highlight standing on a glass floor 100’s of feet above the traffic in one of the walkways above the bridge . A thoroughly good way to see one of my favourite London buildings . I will look at it with a different point of view from now on .
171,Excellent experience and amazing customer team.,The suspension bridge on river Thames is definitely one of the most Iconic Landmarks of London...the bridge deck is accessible to both the vehicles and the pedestrians...the bridge can be raised two ways from the center for the river traffic to pass through..quite a beautiful bridge this is...can be admired from a boat or from the tower of London as well..
172,Beautiful to Look At,"This picturesque bridge is a real beautiful piece of architecture. Though built many years ago, it is still very impressive."
173,Magical,We took the opportunity for a night visit on the London bridge despite the cold evening. It was fun and interesting!
174,Amazing ,Better at night. We enjoyed the view from the top and the engineering of the engine rooms. The history that surrounds the city and importance the bridge has to the city.
175,Beautiful Bridge & Important Landmark,We walked to the bridge and as we closed in it just look more and more amazing. It is a fantastic construction - hard to imagine how they managed to build it back in those days. Of course we walked across it too (mind the winds though). I definitely get why so many tourists visit this bridge.
176,Amazing!!,What an experience a great short story as you enter. The walk ways with glass floor is amazing to be able to look down at the street and river. So much history to this bridge there for you to read and see in pictures. Wether a visit.
177,Great view,We went with 4 children and 4 adults. The children were very excited to be on tower bridge. They loved the glass floor and were given a good activity boo too. Thoroughly recommend
178,A truly iconic landmark,Like many people I assumed this was the London Bridge- but it’s actually the Tower Bridge. It’s amazing architecture and structure reminds me of something a little medieval.
179,The unforgettable view.,We always stay in this area as we like the walk across the bridge and along Southbank. Never fails to impress and even better if you're there when the bridge lifts to let tall ships through. Definitely worth a visit.
180,Very interesting and reasonably priced,"It is as great as ever was, it took me back to my kids years and how I was with my parents. Some great memories. The area was nice, new stalls and restaurants and very safe. I will bring my kids here again."
181,Must visit attraction,"You have to hand it to the Victorians when they built something, not only did it work and last but it was a thing of beauty.To blend seamlessly against the backdrop of The Tower of London. It was an engineering triumph. Its incredible how they did it. Ingenious. A must see in London. Made even better if you get the chance to see the bridge rise."
182,Impressive Bidge,"This is a really cool bridge that I have a chance to go. When there are boat coming is open, when no bridge, it closes. It is big and really beatiful"
183,Just walking across is an experience.,Myself and my husband visited here last week and it was amazing. The views from the glass floors were outstanding. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The gift shop is a bit expensive however I did not catch his name but the welsh man who served us at the till was so helpful and so friendly it made the trip for us. Thankyou for a lovely visit.
184,Amazing View from The Tower Hotel,It's a very beautiful bridge. It's a shame Covid-19 didn't allow enter and discover more about this bridge.
185,"Oh, wow, this is really something",Fantastic historical venue Boyfriend proposed on bridge to create a never ending story of memories from the history of money and the city to Jack the Ripper and the Crown Jewels. This venue has a never ending story to tell and will always hold me to this special place. Enjoy your journey to my special place and sweet spot
186,Beautiful ,"Apart from Big Ben and London Eye, for me Tower Bridge is nr.1 to associate London and UK with. Watching recently the program about the history of Tower Bridge lets me appreciate this iconic place even more every time I walk by."
187,London Bridge visit ,"No visit to London is complete without a visit to Tower Bridge from where you get a great view up and down the Thames as well as The Tower. If you are very lucky you'll see it opened for a ship. View it by night too to see it lit up, it looks beautiful"
188,"Wonderful views, beautiful bridge! :) ",We enjoyed the impressive Victorian engineering in the engine room and splendid views from the top of Tower Bridge.
189,Because it's there,Ii is an old bridge with a mechanical machinery that is still in use.  Walking through out the bridge is an interesting experience.
190,Must see,"The bridge is big, windy, very busy and interesting as a historical site. In spite of a rainy experience it is worth walking across, inhaling the history."
191,Beautiful,Reall enjoyed our trip across the bridge the glass floor that you can stand on and see the river flowing below is awesome and then down to see the mechanics of it  very interesting
192,Some of the best views of London,We were staying nearby and went for a walk. As we walked past the entrance to the experience we thought it'd be nice to go up and walk across the glass floor. We only had to wait five minutes as it was not very busy. You start going straight up the first tower to the glass floor. This was really good seeing the traffic go past underneath you. After spending some time walking across the top of the bridge we went to the engine rooms (included in the ticket) which were really interesting. Worth a visit if you're in the area.
193,Must see!,This stunning iconic bridge is a must see on your travels. There are some wonderful restaurant close by that will provide a good view of the Tower Bridge. where you can enjoy a spot of lunch and with any luck you may see the bridge open and a ship pass through
194,Excellent to photograplh,One of the very popular places you won’t regret visiting. I just loved it. We went there around Christmas time and there was a Christmas market nearby and it was all just so lovely.
195,So iconic and majestic,"Please ensure you just before sunset to see it with and without lights, cover tower of London with it.Enthusiastic people can buy tickets and go on the top of the pillars. I personally didn't go.P.S. Do take lots of photos, this is very beautiful"
196,A good value attraction ,"The tour is very informative about the history with a lot pictures, text and even movies. One can see also see the machinery of the old times."
197,London City Break,I recommend to use ferry its great experience and loved this great monument. Gazing this Beautiful piece of Engineering  from Riverside.
198,Fantastic construction!,Toer bridge is a familiar sight for tourests and runners like me. Its on the halfway point going towards docklands or back towards cutty sark
199,Tower Bridge Experience,"Beautiful bridge that really gives you a reminder of history. Built at a time where craftmanship was important, this bridge still stands."
200,Beautiful and stunning Tower Bridge,"This place is so special and iconic, you can't help but want to take photos of it whenever you see it. It is a centerpiece for the city."
201,Beautiful,You get a sensaition you are near a famous landmark but when you are on the bridge it feels like a normal bridge
202,Buy you tickets at the door.,"Travelling with my nephew and his partner, they were keen to walk over Tower Bridge, so after many years, I got to do more than take photographs from afar.  It really was a good experience, the views from the Bridge were amazing and the Engine Room really interesting.  You can't do much in London for less than 10 quid, so worth every cent."
203,Iconic landmark,Definitely worth a nice walk down the south bank and to the bridge.  Then cross this amazing and beautiful bridge and head to London Tower.  The bridge is stunning!
204,Great PICS,Probably nice to look at if you don't see it every day. Traffic always a pain though. If you can time it to see it open to let a ship underneath then I guess it's cheap kicks.
205,Lovely bridge,Drove across and saw it from the top of the shard and it looks beautiful from all angles. HMS Belfast is also an added bonus because you can see it clearly from the bridge.
206,Great views from a beautiful bridge,Its just vow. The bridge is majestic. You can just sit by the sides and can adore the beauty for as long as u can
207,Impressive Bridge,"Firstly, it’s a beautiful bridge. I stopped to take a photo and promptly fell over my bag, the bridge was packed with cars, buses and people and there I was. You know that feeling when you are so embarrassed by what’s just happened. So red faced I walked the rest of the bridge, it seemed 10 miles long. Otherwise, it’s just so damn beautiful to look at."
208,Very busy but worth it for photos,"This  visit takes between 30mins- 1hour.There was plenty of info about how the bridge was developed and built. There was a clear but slightly uninspiring video talking through the process at 2 points in the upper walkways. Lots of photo displays and great views across the river and the Tower of London. The glass floors are fun, mainly because it was entertaining to see lots of grown ups rolling around on them pretending to be scared they might fall through. People also jumping cheerfully on the glass, posing in the air. The engine room was really good, and I especially liked the stories of the people who worked there - some for 40 years, and the joy and pride they took running the amazing hydraulics system to raise the bridge. Good mix of history and entertainment"
209,Beautiful to walk across ,"By surprise with no plan our double decker passed this route on our 1st day and it made us feel amazed with this historical piece, my daughter sang the London bridge song automatically :)Got a great chance to observed beauty of it from Thames river cruise.We later spent Christmas day by walking back & forth here and around, which has made us deeper connection to it furthermore."
210,An interesting old bridge,"It is a place that you cannot ignore in life's travels, it can bring new insights into life. The city always brings a sense of coolness"
211,"very interesting place to visit with a school group, but felt unwelcome because of staff who treated us unkindly","First of all its called Tower Bridge not London Bridge,its bit confused that people calling it reason Old London Bridge its some where else,  nice view great place to hangout with friends, lovely turn out when the Bridge goes for half diveded during boat pass through. Whole road goes up side"
212,Pretty cool,"It was satisfying to time our visit with 2 opening and closing moments of the bridge within 45 mins. For the first we looked down on the animated passengers below us on the deck of a cruise ship. They were waving and clapping and one boldly stood on a table to get our attention whilst holding aloft a red sweatshirt. We gazed at them through the glass floor of the viewing platforms as 2 tugs guided the ship through, enjoying their excitement. Then we dashed down the stairs in time to see the bridge raised again for one of the tugs to go back down river.Plenty of photo opportunities and lots of information about construction and running of the bridge over its history. It is disappointing that the engine rooms no longer form part of the main tour."
213,Iconic Landmark ,Due to Covid 19 it was really quiet and we were one of only 4 families looking around. The staff were so friendly and told us so many extra facts about the bridge which they were so knowledgable about. It was fascinating. The kids absolutely loved lying on the glass walkway and waving to the tourist buses below!
214,Historic passing,"Doesn’t take long to include this in your day, so it’s worth a look.Not spectacular but you can tick it off the list. It’s often on tv, so once seen you can say: I’ve been there!"
215,London trip,I was really impressed by the beauty of this bridge. Just a few minutes walk from the metro station. One of the best things I saw in London.
216,Beautiful Bridge with great views,Mythical place to visit during a stroll along the banks of the Thames.  Or by boat on the river. Must see.
217,Interesting walk over bridge,Last month we went to uk. We really love bridges. This is lovely bridge. We were enjoying lot. Every year we came uk. This place is looking beautiful and this is fantastic bridge in the world.
218,Just overrated,The worst thing I ve been on in London. Costs approximately 10 GBP. It doeant woth it. You go up through the stairs and walk on the bridge  with glass floor and thats great but thats mainly it whats great.
219,amazing tower bridge!,"This is one of the most famous landmarks in the world. If you are in London, you gotta at least walk through Tower Bridge once."
220,Beautiful place!!!!!,What is so special about this bridge? It is ugly and busy and not even old. There are so many impressive bridges in Europe that is one is just overrated. London is nice but the Tower Bridge is nothing special...
221,Wow! See it at night,Nice looking bridge  that's about it. Walk it drive it look at it. It's on the river and it's a bridge
222,Historical Tour,"First thing is everyone thinks this is the London Bridge.  It is not.  It is a pretty cool bridge itself right off the Tower of London.  We took the hop on hop off river cruise to see the sites.  Stopped here and was amazing.. Tour guide explained it great, got some cool pictures."
223,Stunning bridge,This is a beautiful bridge to see especially at night. It is truly magical all lit up. Do take the time to take the tour. Great views and very informative.
224,Touring over bridge,"We have been visiting tower bridge with our pupils for 10 years now. Recently, we have noticed that staff is not as friendly towards goups as they are towards individual visitors. Our pupils were made to wait in heavy rain and wind for quite a while, they were first told to go up the stairs, then told to come down because it was afia fire escape...then told again to go up!! None of the staff seemed to know where and how to let us in. Lift was not available for our group, did not stop at the floor where we had come in. Although we think this is a great place , with very interesting sights, we are seriously considering dropping this attraction , only because of the unwelcoming behaviour of the staff and we will tell other schoolgroups in Belgium about our experience."
225,Always a Highlight of London,Exciting to walk over the glass and look down at the river and read about the bridge's history. It wasn't much more than that
226,Best part of London ,"We always see him in perspective, in all its glory. Seen from close up doesn't make such a big impression. But you must pass this bridge!"
227,Terrific Tower of London ,Glamorous place that must be seen during the day to understand its greatness and at night to understand its glamor!  Where photos are recorded from all angles and still does not show all magnitude and beauty!
228,Must walk over the bridge,Had family visiting and a request to visit the tower bridge. Pre book the tickets on line and save a pound or two. It was fabbo. The walk along the river before and after was filled with London views and photo ops. We all really enjoyed the experience. Just the right amount of history and information and lots of fun walking on the glass floor. A really good sight to visit. I saw they have concerts there and would like to go back for one of those.
229,"Must have place, beautiful.","Tower Bridge is the most famous spot in London, and it's pretty incredible by the light of the day, but when the sun goes down, the real magic happens when it glows through the night. Best spot: Thames river cruise!"
230,Stunning,"With my school we visited Tower Bridge. When we arrived it was raining and it was cold. But that could not ruin our trip. There were a lot of stairs but it was worth the effort, Because when we we're upstairs we saw whole Londen. There was a lovely view but one of the gards annoyed us and ruined our view. There was a glass floor, really scary but beaatiful at the same time. We also could open some small windows for foto's. Later we went to the steam engine. That was impressive. That was my experience of Tower Bridge."
231,Stunning ,"Its just beautiful. London at its best. When you are on foot, obviously you cant miss it. But take a moment to take it all in."
232,Interesting to see,"We were lucky to score a private group tour so got to see some behind-the-scenes area. If you have a love of architecture and history, take the behind-the-scenes tour. The glass floor is not for the faint of heart."
233,Impressive London Attraction,"Come out of the tower of London and next it's Tower Bridge. You get some excellent views of the River Thames from the top of the bridge. There's a glass floor where you can see the traffic and the Thames below, not everyone likes it.. The engine rooms are very interesting, well worth a look. Would recommend."
234,Impressive,"We were very lucky and managed to get tickets on the day for a family of 8.... not a bad price either.  The stairs are a killer but the view is stunning. For us though, we were impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff... willing to chat to us and talk us through things.We were fortunately the only ones on the glass floor so we had plenty of time to take photos and the young member of staff on that floor was brilliant with us... encouraging those who were scared and advising us of the best poses... great fun... Thank you!!"
235,Favourite bridge,"In these Covid times, being a London tourist hasn't been easier. Having it all to ourselves it is a very pleasant experience. You get a fantastic view of the Thames and the glass floor is a brilliant feature.  As you climb one of the towers, there is some fascinating facts about the construction and history of this icon. You also get to visit the pump room too, which is also interesting for architecture buffs.All in all a great London landmark that needs to be visited, it's not just a bridge."
236,Intresting,Recommend stopping by after a visit to the Tower of London. Walking on the glass floor is the best part. Good way to spend an hour.
237,London’s iconic skyline.,"Truly magic, walking among the river with my girlfriend and admiring the beauty of this city during the night will be one of the memories I will take with me back home"
238,Identity of London,Many foreign tourists could be confused thinking that Tower Bridge is London Bridge. It's not. If you go to look at London Bridge you will be disappointed.Tower Bridge is majestic. I travelled across it and recently I went under it on a boat. I would definitely recommend the latter as you can really appreciate the architecture.
239,So Worth the Climb,"Is it a tower? Is it a bridge? No, it's tower bridge!Spanning the Thames at a suitable place to build a bridge Tower Bridge looks magnificent. Considered one of London's most recognisable structures and the world's most famous bridge it is unlikely for you to be disappointed when you visit. The bridge is well maintained, fun to walk across and should you be lucky enough, see if open.Expect to spend about 30 minutes here walking across it and taking photos. Consider going on the experience tour if you have time too - the view from the walkway is crazy good."
240,Quick trip on the Hop on Hop Off bus,"I may be biased as I lived right by this Bridge until I was 11.  I spent many weekends with family and friends on the cannons by the tower, looking up at this beautiful iconic site. You could never tire of seeing such splendour. I certainly am never disappointed no matter how many times I visit and see this beauty in the distant. Everyone must see this at least once in their lifetime."
241,Beautiful to walk across any time of year!,"The Bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London. This impressive piece of architecture is one of London and the worlds real treasures. I highly recommend walking across and enjoying the views over the Thames. It is worth it.  If you're lucky, you'll get to see the Bridge open, which is truly a majestic show. You are also."
242,February,"The Tower Bridge is one of London's iconic landmarks. It's highly suggested to walk along the bridge from one side to another side and it's all FREE!!To get the best view of the bridge, it'also suggested to take a photo from the Hanseatic walk area."
243,The best visit,"A quick ride up the elevator on the Tower of London side of the bridge leads to a brief overview film then out onto the upper level with the glass floor panels to view the river traffic from above. Side panels detail the history of the bridge construction and history.  After decent in the other bridge tower, a walk outside leads to the mechanical room where the original hardware the operated the bridge can be seen in detail with detailed panels there as well. The tour ends, as all tours do, through the gift shop. As this is an icon of London, a visit is almost mandatory.  I enjoyed the experience."
244,Lovely landmark!,"This self-guided tour offers a real insight into how the tower was made and more importantly the lives of those who created, used and nurtured it, across the ages."
245,The Bridge.,"Built between 1886 and 1894, Tower Bridge is London's iconic and most architectural bridge, a highlight of any walk along the river and impressive when you walk or drive over. It is both a suspension bridge and a bascule bridge, i.e. it opens to allow ships and tall vessels through - there is a website that tells you the times, and this is fun to watch.I was walking along the river on a Sunday morning which was eerily quiet, apart from the odd runner, so had the opportunity to enjoy the bridge from both the London Bridge side and from Rotherhithe.  The tide was out - the Thames is tidal at this point and the mudlarkers were out looking for items of interest in the mud."
246,Iconic ,"Magnificent to view - this bridge gets a heavenly glow lighted at night. If possible, walk around and watch the draw bridge raise with music playing and tourist boat cruising under it."
247,"After years of viewing, I finally did it!","Built during an age when Britain was at the height of its domination of world trade, the Tower Bridge looks like no other.  Designed to impress then, it still continues to do so as an iconic andmark that spans the River Thames.  Plenty of good views of river life and the London skyline, one gets a different perspective of its size and design features by walking or driving across it.  And it's also possible to visit the north and south towers (linked by a glass floor-containing walkway.  But I feel the bridge looks at its best when viewed from afar."
248,One of London’s icons seen from a different angle,"I really enjoy the spectacle of the Tower Bridge at night. It is majestically lit up. The view from the river's edge or from the London Bridge is perfect for pictures. And there are some great places to visit just a stone's throw from the Tower Bridge, including the Tower of London and the Bridge Theatre."
249,Nice Bridge,This is my Lady’s favorite bridge in the world. We visit it every chance we get. It’s very special and worth the time for anyone who has never seen it.
250,Tower Bridge ,Crossing Tower Bridge we enquired if we could visit as we had not pre-booked.  We were able to and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.
251,A must see in London - combine it with London Tower,"You need to get there before 5 if you would like to go inside and take a look around for as complete experience, but just a stroll down the bridge is an experience on it'r own. It offers some of the best views of London and of course perfect spot for the perfect pictures :)"
252,Super Interesting!,Traveled on this bridge in an open double decker bus and looking up and around while the driver took his time crossing was an amazing experience. Most especially considering the historical events surrounding Tower Bridge. Not many places one can travel and capture that experience.
253,tower bridge,During lockdown and the whole of summer i have been going for long walks down the river. starting and fishing with tower bridge. you get a good sense of history and modern architecture along the route
254,Love bridge,We choose to walk and then bus back to the other side. Beautiful walk and our timing was in the morning before it became busy. The view is exceptional both walking and busing over. The walkway is wide. Highly recommend.
255,Very nice place!,"We had the tour here, which included walking across the top, over the glass floor and down into the engine rooms. Every step you walk there is information on how / when etc the bridge was built and how it works. Very clean and well kept. The staff were all friendly, as covid is here at the moment, all the staff were following the guidlines. For £10 pp ( different rates for different users) what a wealth of information you get about one of Londons fabulous buildings- highly recommend!"
256,Not to be confused with London Bridge,I traveled in a cruise ship on the Thames and passed under this bridge. The sensation is amplified a million times compared to what I read and saw in the pictures. At dusk to pass under this pot is at least gorgeous.
257,It’s just iconic. ,The whole point of this bridge is that it is suspension bridge which actually opens up apart when the big ships are supposed to cross the adjoining river THAMES.And as a teenager it is really very mesmerizing to see such monument.Also tried the glass walkways.. its free for pedestrians who wish to cross the bridge.Also went for boating in river THAMES after visiting this bridge in person. This wholesome  experience was good .You need around 30/45 mins to visit this attraction.
258,Amazing tour,One of the main stop required to do in a Visit to the City of London. Make sure to keep yourself warm is cold during this season. Its worth it to cross it walking and by bus.Make sure to check it out.
259,Great day out. ,"One cannot help but be easily drawn to any pics of this famous bridge.Funny enough, most people mistake the real London Bridge for this one.Anchored by two castle-like structures, both architecture and engineering leave one in awe of the masterpiece.Inside tip - there is a lovely river walk from London Bridge (passing by Tower of London) to Tower Bridge, crossing the bridge, one can walk that bank on an equally pretty walk (and, also enjoy the HMS Belfast).A London MUST!"
260,It's a bridge and a landmark,"We had a full tour, but halfway trough there were too many details and we were already tired.Do this in the morning"
261,Good feel!,"We are a family of 4 (teen boys), and we pre-booked the Tower Bridge Experience. We didn’t have to queue. The glass bottom at the top of the bridge was amazing, and had fantastic views of The Thames and Shard. Although it was a bit daunting to step on the glass at first! We highly recommend this experience."
262,Awesome,"Built between 1886 and 1894, this suspension and bascule bridge is one of the recognisable London landmarks which is not to be missed, whether you take a tour which includes crossing over the glass desk at the upper level or are just walking over from one side of the river to the other.It is a marvellous piece of 19th century engineering and provides great views of the River Thames."
263,late 18th century technology!,Its hard to believe so many people never seen the light of day after they were locked up in the tower. The jewels were wonderfull
264,Amazing Bridge,Very nice for walk...Special at night time...has amazing river view and you can see all the big buildings from Liverpool street
265,Great from a distance!,"Even though I’d seen it in photos I wasn’t expecting it to be so great, but it was even grander in person. Definitely worth a look and a walk over, it is right near other sights so why not?"
266,Boom,This bridge attracts a lot of foot traffic. Very difficult for non-Bridge-phile to see the relevance of this bridge.
267,Icon,Pay the extra and visit both.  The glass floor on the corridor between the two towers will make your stomach feel queasy when looking down.  Marvel at the engineering and the history of Tower Bridge.  There is so much to see and do in this small area of London
268,no title,"As rain was forecast for most of the day, we were looking for something indoor to do and a friend recommended this. I must admit, I did wonder just how interesting a visit to a bridge would be - I was proved wrong. There is a short film as you go in and then you go onto the walkways. There are photos and facts all the way along both walkways which are really interesting. The glass floors give very unusual views of the bridge, even for someone who suffers a fear of heights. We also enjoyed the engine house, including having a go at making music using materials from the bridge."
269,Part of a great day out,Magnificent sight at night approached from the south bank as looms ever nearer. . Impressive structure that oozes history .
270,Iconic London landmark,"You have to book on line and book time slot.Due to covid 19.There are loads of stops to hand sanitizer.Be prepared there are a lot of stairs to climb.However you can take a lift.Loads of history to learn which is fascinating.The view from the top ,glass floor is great for some .A must do visit to London ."
271,Victorian Engineering ,"I really enjoy the spectacle of the Tower Bridge especially when it’s starts to get dark in the evening. It is majestically lit up all round. The view from the river's edge or from the London Bridge is perfect for taking photos of the scenery or with your friends and loved ones. And there are some great places to visit just a stone's throw from the Tower Bridge, including the Tower of London and the Bridge Theatre. I was there not far to watch Witnessed for the Prosecution and really enjoyed walking along the Tower Bridge."
272,Amazing,"Good hour spent here in blustery conditions, as it got darker out, it was impossible to take decent photos tho as the displays reflect on the glass.Tip- do both walkways before going down to the engine room - there are no signs but once you’ve gone down there you can’t come back up so easy to miss the second walkway!"
273,Incredible ,There was a short queue when we arrived and we were soon in a lift being taken upwards.  There was a short film to watch when we got out the lift and a guide chipped in with various snippets of info and answered any questions.  We were then free to walk along the walkway reading about the bridge and looking at the views.  The best bit was the glass floor with the mirrors above so you can look up and see what's going on under your feet!  Amazing.  We then descended and walked to the engine room.  What an interesting history this bridge has.  Well worth the entrance fee.  I thoroughly recommend this place.
274,Beautiful bridge,This is wonderful attraction which is continuously upgraded.Walk ways are being made more people friendly.Various art pieces are being added.It is now magnate for tourist attractions.There good feel around the whole place.Keep up the good work!
275,Fun to walk from tower to tower.,We visited on a rather nippy day with moonshine. What took the shine off our visit was wedding photographers blocking the whole passageway to click photos of newlyweds. Was a nuisance
276,Even more impressive on site,"We had planned to just walk over the bridge, but ended up paying to do the self guided tour of the bridge from above. A lift takes you to the top, where you walk both sides 60m up - this includes a glass walkway to walkover, many facts of the bridge & good views up and down the river. Stairs down 1/2 way then back to ground level by lift. Continue to walk over the bridge to the engine room.  Not the best bridge in the world to view, but very interesting to see from a different perspective, the original engine rooms and the inside columns. At £20 for 2 adults + 1 child, worth the money (just)"
277,A Must Do in London!,"So unbelievably cool to go up into the bridge, learn about how it was made, and walk across a glass floor looking down at the traffic and the water.  It's an awesome photo opt and just a stunning site to see."
278,Iconic Tower Bridge,"Bridge can be sightseeing from inside and outside. Entrance on upper level costs up to £10 for adults, kids with discount. Great view on the London and Thames. Worth to consider also visit after dark as bridge is highlighted."
279,Amazing ,"Tower Bridge is magnificent; beautiful, huge, amazing, all at once. I don’t know how, but it manages to grab your attention anytime and everytime you see it. The work, the colors, its location, the effect of sunset and sunrise, the romantic aura around it- everything is splendid. We started our London experiences from here and ended at the same location. I am completely awe-struck by this bridge. Not just the history, it has a lot more that attracts you. I loved spending hours sitting on the benches near the bridge or side walk or clicking pictures. I left a piece of my heart here ❤️ and I’ll come back again."
280,One of London icons,"Walked across the London Tower bridge. It was a short walk, not very crowded, even during the February break. It was a great experience. It is a beautiful bridge. We did not do the bridge experience, the line was quite long."
281,So so iconic!!!,"We visited as a family on Monday only because the Tower of London was shut. It doesn’t take long to go around but used up a morning, very well organized and interesting. Clean toilets and a nice gift shop at the end."
282,Obligatory visit in London,"Don't listen to all the ""off the beaten path"" gurus! This is a classic for a reason and will always remain to be a British icon! Worth a visit for sure!"
283,Great views of London,"I have never really been all that interested in the Tower Bridge, but it has always been a curiosity.  It's a structure that doesn't make sense at first glance. Even the name is a red herring; it comes from the adjacent Tower of London, not the two towers that give it its iconic shape.  And what's inside those two towers anyway? That's what I was curious about.  I happened to be staying at a hotel located at one end of the bridge, and so I decided to go check it out, literally, because it was right there.  So what's inside the towers?  Not terribly much.  The bridge was built for a practical purpose -- to connect the banks of the Thames while also allowing tall vessels to sail through.  It still does both these things but now they charge admission to subsidize it, a smart idea.  You walk a third of the way across the bridge outside (from the Tower of London side) to the ticket booth. You then take a 20-person elevator up the first tower.  There is a short film (you can skip) and go out onto the parallel walkways that connect the two towers above. You can go through one walkway and then around to the other in as many circular laps as you like.  The walkways are enclosed so you are not exposed to weather. The view is good but obstructed; the iron scaffolding gets in the way. It's also not quite as tall as you might think.  A short section of each walkway has a glass floor so you can see the water and traffic below your feet. You exit down the stairs of the second tower (there is another film) passing by fun facts and statistics on the wall as you go. You then walk outside to the other end of the bridge and go through the gift shop to the 3-room engine gallery where a set of hefty drawbridge mechanisms are on display.Tower Bridge is a historic, legitimate, perfectly fine cultural attraction.  It's just not terribly exciting.  I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, but if you're already at the Tower of London and you're curious, it's and easy thing to go do -- because it's there."
284,great views and photos,"Go on the sidewalk and take the bridge from one of the sides, you don't need more than 30min there. you have a train on the north side"
285,One of the best kept historic tower bridges in the World,"Up to now, I’d never walked across Tower Bridge and over the Thames this way, but I made sure it happened on a recent visit to London. This is one of the most iconic attractions in London and has stood since the late nineteenth-century. It is a Grade I listed structure and is used by almost 50,000 people every day. Great photograph opportunities can be had if one walks to City Hall and sees it from this angle."
286,Impressive to see,Nothing special about it to be honest......... Not me cup of tea lad. Next time won't waste my time on tryin to pass through it.
287,Great monument to visit,"This bridge, built between 1886 and 1894, crosses the River Thames, and was developed using an advanced engineering technique of suspension bridges, if you walk it, you will have a spectacular view of both sides of the city. It is a great experience!"
288,Think of the History!,I hadnt been here since i was 12. A friend said now was the time...as with no visitors its a great time to see everything.  This is partially true...only there are only a limited number of things you can see...a lot of the exhibitions are closed. Considering it still costs £25 each to enter i found this hard to swallow. Tje building and grounds are still magnificent.  But you can only visit the white tower and the crown jewels. The crown jewels are worth it..without the crowd you can go round and round the cabinets and get an amazingly good view.  The White Tower is also interesting.  But sadly yourein and out in about an hour. So....wonderful place.. but presently overpriced
289,An enjoyable trip to Tower Bridge,"If you take a sightseeing bus, make sure you are on the top...regardless of the weather!   This is a MUST SEE.   Feels just like you are in Victorian London.   Great way to start your London adventure."
290,A fantastic experience.,"Walk.... you will love the experience. If possible, take time to spend some time around the Tower Bridge and see the night view as well. We loved it. Take the tour if possible, worth it."
291,Hooray for a wonderful bridge ,"This attraction was so much more than I expected. Book tickets online in advance to save a few pounds and avoid the long main queue. You still must either print or collect the tickets, there isn't a e-ticket option it seems. We had a tour from a beefeater at the beginning who provided the history of the various buildings and towers and who recommended which areas were a must-see. There is so much to see you'd want at least 2 hours in my opinion. The tower also houses the crown jewels which are spectacular. Well worth a visit."
292,Tower Bridge,"We came here this morning 17/09/2020 11.10am, we booked first thing this morning which was extremely easy to do. It was both educational and very factual with videos on different floors and very interesting with going to see how everything worked and is still working today. It was well worth the money at £10.60pp. The staff who are extremely knowledgeable and with it being a lot quieter can talk and answer as many questions you require."
293,Superb visit again ! ,We walked across the bridge by night on our way to see the Shard - (which was closed). The experience was beautiful.
294,Incredble!,"Try to go as early as you can if you want good photo ops. Best view of the bridge is off the bridge, again, go early to avoid the tonne of other tourists."
295,spectacular bridge,"Along with Parliament and Big Ben, Tower Bridge is London's next must-see architectural marvel, not to mention the most famous bridge that crosses the Thames"
296,Gorgeous ,"If you are up Lindon take a walk over Tower Bridge, beautiful.  If you want, take a boat ride under it too. Check on times and you may even be able to see it open...this is stunning."
297,It’s a bridge over a river.,I’ve walked over this bridge an untold amount of times over the years and I always get such a feeling of great pride.The ultimate view of this beautiful  bridge is seen from London Bridge especially when its lit up.Such a sight for sore eyes and truly Amazing ....
298,Amazing architecture and history,"We had reserved tickets to go to Tower Bridge, but we still had to wait outside in the freezing cold for about thirty minutes. I wish they had a better queuing system for the sake of both the employees and guests. When we got in, everything was pretty easy. The main museum and history parts are located in the bridge, and it was fun to read about all the history while looking at the view from the side and floor windows."
299,Great view in the evening ,"One of our favorite activities during our trip was the morning we spent at the Tower of London, capped off by our journey across the bridge. We opted to not spend the money to go up in the tower, and don't feel like we missed anything."
