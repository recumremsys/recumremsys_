0,Great and informative,Well worth the admission price . Great displays with information in abundance. Fish all looked healthy and happy ( even the snakes did ) Very impressed with walk through tunnel under the Barrier Reef tank and the informative session I heard about sharks
1,Wonderful! Loved it!,"Excellent facilities, the displays were amazing. Easy access with pram and child. Lot’s to see. Well worth the trip"
2,Just awesome,This place is awesome. Amazing views of all sorts of sea life. Staff are very helpful too. Highly reccomend people check it out.
3,Cairns Aquarium Day,What a great facility. Fantastic displays ranging from wetlands through to the reef marine life. Very well set up and places to sit and take it all in.
4,Nice but costly,Really enjoyed the aquarium and got to see the show where the divers fed the rays and sharks.  Layout was well thought out and there are a lot of larger tanks.
5,Definitively worth a visit!,"Great reviews from TA Reviewers took us through the doors.No OAP discount on the tickets. Lots of different fishes etc to see in a very tourist friendly enviroment.The first Reef Fish Feed of the morning was spoilt for us by a not very good female presenter who finished every sentence with the ""OK""  and went into far toooooo much detail about the firmation of coral reefs. Us oldies know most of it and the kids were not interested.....we all wanted to see the fish bring fed.The second Shark/Rays Fish Feed was much better. Light, full of interesting facts and he did not drone on for 15/20 minutes about trivia.Enjoyed it all, except the lady presenters drone."
6,Check prices before entering,"Looks very new, was a wonderful place to visit.  So many fish to view over 2 levels.  Very impressed - a great place to take your children to."
7,Blown away with how fantastic this place is!,"Have some good sea life and reptiles for the kids to view. Some big tanks but do not expect massive or large sharks etc. This is not a large place but if you take your time you can spend two hours looking at everything from rays, to spiders, lizards and snakes. Worth taking the kids."
8,Great place on a cold windy day,"Lovely displays of different animals, but only lasted 45 minutes. Thought there would be more to see and discover (especially for the price)"
9,Long wait,"Great place to take the family. There was a huge variety of marine life, who all looked happy and well cared for which is lovely to see. My daughter loved seeing real Dory's and Nemo's :)"
10,Spectacular.A Must to do.,The aquarium covered shallow water including mangrove and deep water fish.  The exhibits were stunning  - so much better than we were expecting.  The displays of brightly coloured reef fish and coral were amazing.  The entrance fee was expensive but well worth it and of course the profits are plowed back into these wonderful exhibits.  Certainly a must see.  And the aquarium is air conditioned so is a welcome escape from the heat and humidity in Cairns.
11,Must-see Cairns attraction,Unfortunately no presentations due to COVID restrictions but a big variety of different fish to look at and find out a little bit about
12,Quite good,"Took 3 annual trips to Cairns to finally visit this amazing venue.  Really impressive displays of all forms of fish and aquatic life, with emphasis on the tropical species. Some of the tanks and displays were massive, with divers swimming with the sharks, rays etc., hand feeding as the opportunity arose.  Knowledgible staff were keen to describe unique species and in some cases allow people to touch and handle some of them.  Must have spent 4 hours there.  World class."
13,Good to view many types of fish,"the aquarium was interesting with some good displays but we were quite disappointed at the lack of hammerhead sharks as all advertising images we had seen showed hammerhead sharks which we thought very misleading.  We were very keen to see the turtle rehabilitation centre but when we asked about this on arrival we were told It was just the hospital (shown as ""3"" on our map.  When we got their there was nothing to be seen so we went and asked and were told there would only be turtles to see when a talk was happening - the final talk for the day happened to have been shortly after we arrived - it would have been nice to have been told on arrival when we asked about turtles (it wasn't a busy day so the ticketing staff could have been much more helpful).  Whilst we enjoyed our visit it was expensive in comparison to some other Australian aquariums."
14,Queue issues ,"A very cool experience with so much to see. The aquarium is very well laid out and has  lots of animals to see and enjoy, the shark tank was my favorite. Everything is very clean, the tanks, the enclosures and the facility in general. All the fish, reptiles and amphibians appear to be very well cared for. I also like the educational aspect too. There are several presentations through out the day and every tank or enclosure has an information placard next to it to tell you all about the awesome animals/fish. We're so glad we went and it's a must see while in Cairns."
15,Perfect morning out,Buy tickets online to save money. It's very informative and interesting. Many fish and creatures to see. The cafe is good too.
16,Awesome,"Beautiful aquarium. Very informative and lots of different species. We had a wonderful experience there; most enjoyable. Would highly recommend the admission & lunch combo at Dundee restaurant. The food, dessert and house white wine was sumptuous"
17,So worth the visit.,Was great to see lots of the different species of fish...big and small and other animals too. Loved the shark feeding.
18,Where are your opening times?,Excellent aquarium to see. Great watching the divers feed the large stingrays and sharks and also plenty of other things to see.
19,Great for all ages,Very impressed with the showcase.  A lot of fish to see and very informative.  Great for kids. Can get a bit crowded so weekdays should be best to visit.
20,Screaming Kids ruined it for us,"Lovely displays, beautiful creatures - great set out. I like the educational value of this facility, demonstrating the various ecosystems that are interconnected from the Billabong of the outback right through to the Barrier Reef. However, I don't know why but looking through the glass or whatever the material encompassing the displays made my eyes go 'wonky' and it was disorientating. It was also darker than I expected and made it harder to see. I didn't have this issue at the Townsville aquarium. I had a problem trying to get through the turnstile as well as it would not recognise my ticket which happened to a few of us. It was overcrowded and very noisy and overall, I did not enjoy the experience."
21,Informative look at north queensland,"We did not expect much to be honest but this place was awesome. Easy to get around, fish were displayed humanely and up close. Reptiles were easy to spot. Guides were interesting and informative. We recommend"
22,Great afternoon spent at the Aquarium,"Amazing attraction, great day well maintained and displayed. Not over crowded, good family fun. Knowledge staff."
23,A great way to spend an afternoon,Loved this. Great variety and selection. Loved the display of different colour reef fish. Never seen a shark egg before.
24,A wonderful experience,"Good views of many types of fish and interesting educational talks. Make sure you go to the talks as they help with knowledge. Lots of other creatures such as turtles, frogs, and snakes also to look at. Good family day out."
25,Underwater wonderland,Cairns aquarium trumps our melbourne aquarium. Kids loved it. Good individual displays and diver feeding show ok. Tall reef tank was particularly special as is wlk through tank.
26,"Never disappoints, worth repeat visits !",Beautiful new building and friendly and staff. The exhibits are very well done. Don't miss the living reef exhibit. Was amazing to see up close the live coral
27,Good day out ,"A wonderful collection of sea critters and lots of talks for those interested in learning more about specific animals like the sawfish or ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef.  Walking through the tunnels was fun, especially when the huge 'smiling' stingrays glide over your head!  The  feeding sessions were fascinating too."
28,More than just an aquarium.,The exhibits in the aquarium were beautiful and informative but I found the entrance fee expensive for a place where you would only spend half a day.
29,Aquarium,Great explication by very friendly staff. Beautiful animals of all kind. We discovered species that we have never seen before.
30,Beautiful aquarium,Not hard to spend a couple of hours looking at the amazing variety of fish and other sea life.Passionate Talks and presentations with information about the barrier reef and other local attractions.
31,A must do in Cairns,"I had a great visit.  It included information and animals from the rainforest rivers through to the reef.  Well laid out, lots of easy to read information and active animals.  The presentations from staff were excellent.  Great staff who are very knowledgeable and passionate about sharing information.  I entered the aquarium at lunch time and had some time before the afternoon rush joined me."
32,Great family activity to do for a few hours in Cairns.,spent a few hours walking through the displays. loved the shark tank where they swim above you and the two level coral reef was mesmerising. the staff were helpful and as my partner is not mobile we took a wheel chair through. a nice touch which made it better for him. oh and the adjacent restaurant looked great...next time
33,Interesting,We enjoyed this instead of going to the barrier reef. Lots of very nice exhibits. Also a nice escape from the heat
34,"Lots of beautiful fish, don't bother with the on-site restaurant / cafe. Do it in the afternoon for a more quiet time","The aquarium layout is fantastic. Every exhibit is set out so that you can see everything. Not one creature was hidden from view which made it so good for the kids. The large tanks were amazing , the touch pool was good and the shark feeding show was great to watch and listen too!"
35,Excited to visit this venue..,The presentation and organization of displays were amazing.  The aquarium feeding at 11:00 was well worth attending. The best:  sitting in the aquarium tube and having a ray pass overhead.
36,The Best,"Really enjoyed our day at the aquarium. The displays were impressive. Lots of hands on activities suitable for our 5,7 and 8 year old children."
37,Avoid staff member in the gift shop,Really enjoyed our visit to this aquarium. Very interactive with lots of displays onsite! Great shop to buy your gifts & souvenirs from! Was quite surprised on the size of the place not what we were expecting in Cairns. Loved watching the divers feed the massive grouper.
38,Aquarium visit,"Excellent, educational and interesting with interesting talks along the way.  One of the better aquariums we have visited. A research institute also."
39,cairns aquarium,A MUST visit place in Cairns particular for family with young children! The info talks are the highlight. Highly recommended. Will visit again!
40,Lovely exhibits,New and worth seeing. Be sure to catch the talk on sharks! Lovely to walk under sharks and stingrays gliding overhead. Many presentations allowing for touching and feeling. Info about the Reef.

45,Amazing place ,"Really decent aquarium - knowledgeable staff, decent interactive touch-and-feel activities for kids, and good price.  Then lunch at Dundee’s was terrific!  Really good food !!  Plus, being able to come and go throughout the day with the same ticket was super helpful for tired kids.  Great day all round!!"
46,Beautiful,The Turtle hospital is very impressive! As is the rest of the Aquarium and the staff are spot on - very knowledgeable 👏
47,Great Aquarium,Would not recommend going through the school holidays.   Pleasant and well presented. Some of the aquariums were hard to take photos

53,Aquarium by night,"Great presentation and friendly, helpful staff.The variety of Sea life on show in a realistic environment is impressive"
54,Taster of the GBR,"Enjoyed the tunnels in particular and having the manta rays float inches above overhead.  Informative, educational, well laid out. Not too long, not too short."
55,Awesome,"One whole wall of the restaurant is an aquarium. Which you can watch and marvel over before visiting this amazing attraction. It shows you all reef fish of course, as well as rainforest and freshwater inhabitants. Reef fish galore, right from the huge Wrasse, which everywhere else is called Wally, but here it is Percy, right down to the little anemone fish we know as Nemo."
56,Amazing,Excellent displays with feeding and educational explanations.  Well worth a visit.  Highly recommended
57,Great morning under the sea,"What a well laid out and expansive aquarium. The reptiles and other creatures are so well looked after and thrive in that environment, Photography turned out just beautiful. Take your time and wonder through."
58,awsomes,"Managed to spend most of the day here, the live shows and talks were highly educational. The feeding of the reef fish was great to watch, and it was good to see that it was not just saltwater/tropical animals which were on display- plenty of freshwater turtles and crays,the endangered sawfish was my definite highlight. Plenty to see for all ages, wheelchair accessible also."
59,Such a fun place to visit ,This was an awesome and informative visit to this aquarium.... Witnessed the shark feeding and many other underwater attraction at this aquarium.... A must see whilst in Cairns.....
60,Very nice Aquarium,"Very well laid out and maintained all the creatures looked healthy and happy, a great sensory experience and rounded off a trip to Cairns nicely"
61,Night tour and dinner,Very informative about reef ecosystems and other important Australian sealife. Guided talks flowed naturally from one to another and were both entertaining and informative. Absolutely a must for anyone intending to see the reef.
62,Lectures complement the local fish life in this new aquarium in central Cairns.,Brilliant set up. Lots of pertinent information next to the animals. 5D experience could be improved.
63,We had a wonderful time thanks to Maja!,An excellent aquarium with good cover of the Great Barrier Reef. A worthwhile visit. Highly recommended for people on cruise ships vista Cairns for a short visit.
64,Pleasant but expensive,Nicely presented with lots of information regarding not only sea creatures but the environment around the area
65,Aquarium by night with dinner,"Lots to see, not just marine as reptiles were also included. Easy to walk around, good hour or so in morning."
66,Best Valentines Day ever 😊,Nice way to spend an hour or two. The displays were well presented with plenty of variety. Quite expensive though.
67,Loved the Aquarium,"We have been to several Aquariums in other cities. This is the top of the list.An admission price of $42 seems a bit steep at the first look - however a visit to the Tourist Information centre around the corner gave us a 10% discount on the admission price.The complete layout is very logical, following the marine life from the first rain drops in the mountains all the way down and out to the reef.Tanks are colorful, clean and look healthy. We spoke with several staff members who were all very knowledgeable and helpful and friendly - they obviously loved their jobs.We stopped for lunch in the cafe - great food at fair prices.We spent about 4 hours in total - a great half day out and well worth the admission costs - trust me - you will love it - dont miss out!"
68,Unexpected delight,Tropical north Queensland at its best. Large displays of reef fish and corals plus other critters found in the rain forest.Very informative information beside each display. Guide information and verbal session was both informative and entertaining. Conservation message was well highlighted.
69,Excellent aquarium for young and old,"Amazing place and great knowledgeable staff, also had talks about animals, I loved it and would go again"
70,Wonderful aquarium,Great value for money and very informative talks. The double discovery tour is a must! Our guide was very friendly and knowledgeable!
71,Fantastic!,Had a wonderful informative morning at the new Cairns Aquarium. Shark and Ray feeding time was interesting and the guide had interesting information to share about the sharks and rays. Loved seeing them swim so gracefully. Would recommend visiting.
72,Fantastic!,The aquarium was very well laid out and informative. The staff were very knowledgable and passionate about the reef. Highly recommend anyone visiting Carins to go here.
73,A beautiful day at the Aquarium,"We loved our time here. Lots to see and do. Attended several of the informative talks. Only wish there were a few more benches to sit on, especially upstairs"
74,Very enjoyable and informative,"This was a great place to visit, packed full of vast variety of marine species. Follow the trail slowly and identify the fish and other marine creatures. Very well labelled. Allow a minimum of 2 hours for this fascinating self tour."
75,Fantastic aquarium,A really good aquarium from the start of the river to the depths of the sea you follow the trail  Well set out and informative
76,Family Visit - Cairns Aquarium,Nice place to visit but a little expensive for family’s. Have been to a few aquariums with kids and it is good but can be hard at the moment with the covid situation as there is no social distancing and you feel rushed. With the current COVID situation I believe they try their best to instruct everyone about social distancing but this is it. Other than a couple of announcements on the speakers it’s not really controlled.
77,FABULOUS,In town for just a short day so this sounded interesting.  We were really impressed with the aquarium - great displays with excellent information. We both learned a great deal!  This is a great place to visit no matter what the age.
78,A must do,Very cool being part of a small group in the museum at night. Guide was great and full of facts and tales of the exhibits. Food was great too.
79,"This is a beautiful, new facility. Go see it!",Cairn Aquarium visit was enjoyable and informative. Graet focus on rivers and stream and the reefThe staff there are really cool.
80,Cairns aquarium - must visit in Cairns,"A fantastic museum that does a good job at showing native australian life, and beutiful exhibits with a variety of fish and animals"
81,Well worth a visit,"A wonderful Aquarium in the middle of Cairns, Queensland AUSTRALIA. Lots of great exhibitions of life on the Great Barrier Reef and the waterways nearby. Information.about each exhibit was clear and consistent. Very helpful Personnel and they were happy to answer all questions.  Well worth the price of admission."
82,shark talk,"We really enjoyed the Aquarium, spending approx 4 hrs there. The exhibits & building are beautiful & well maintained. The presenters are passionate & knowledgeable. The presentations are excellent & educational. Highly recommend."
83,Great place to visit as a prelude to visiting the reef.,This facility is world class. It's full of stunning fish and creatures that you would normally have to get VERY wert to see in their habitat.Would also be great for the elderly and disabled.
84,Great experience,located in a fine fish shaped building there are  variety of marine life displayed here. entrance fee is there.there is a souvenir shop and a restaurant there.
85,Amazing Fish!,"We have been to many aquariums in the world and this one was truly excellent. With lots and lots of informative displays of all the water ecosystems of the region, we easily spent 2 hours here. We particularly enjoyed the freshwater tanks and displays and learnt a lot about the importance of these systems to the rainforest. The coral sea displays were fabulous and the massive tank with all the reef fish was mesmerising. We enjoyed ‘meeting’ Kanye West the psycho clown trigger and the unicorn fish with the bent point!"
86,Divers,We loved our visit to the aquarium in Cairns.  We were amazed at the size and number of sea life on show.  Was a perfect day out on a warm Cairns day and was so peaceful watching the fish.  All the staff we met were very informed and had a lot of passion for their jobs.  Would recommend a visit to the Cairns Aquarium for people of all ages.
87,"Extremely well done, interesting for adults",This is a must see for all age groups. Well worth the money and make sure you time the feeding of the sharks
88,Cairns Aquarium,Only open 5 hours but SO worth a visit. Staff are well informed and happy to chat about the hundreds of different types of marine life plus the few reptiles. We spend 2 hours and loved every bit of it. Walking through the glass tunnel and watching the sting rays swing over the top was just incredible. If you can go you won't be disappointed.
89,Robbo,"good place to take the kids, exhibits were a bit boring to me. Kids would love the pat a startfish area. Very expensive"
90,Great activity for a rainy day,"This must be one of the best aquarium worldwide, you could really and vividly enjoy the lively beautiful panoramic view of the great barriers."
91,Day out,"This is a beautiful, tranquil aquarium well worth some of your time. It wasn’t too busy like other aquariums which meant it was a relaxing place for a visit. The enclosures appear well-kept, and the animals healthy and seemingly happy. The sea creatures here are the kind you see when visiting FNQ so after a visit to the reef it was nice to identify some of the same creatures at the aquarium and read a bit about them. My young child really enjoyed our visit and liked using the rocky frames around the tanks to get in for a closer look. Friendly service also. Thank you Cairns Aquarium!"
92,A really great aquarium,"Quality activity for tourists. Clean and informative. Just the right size to whet the appetite  before getting out to the reef. Tanks are really blue and surprisingly similar to the  reef. Some unique fish but oodles of very colourful fish! The  aquarium shop is typical of  these tourist attractions but go to the shop first, you'll only buy things for kids."
93,Honeymoon trip,The aquarium should take you no more than 2  hours.  The Reef Aquariums are amazing and filled with reef life.  The layout is logical and flows well with the journey from rainforest to reef.
94,Cairns aquarium,"The kids and I enjoyed visiting the aquarium, the staff were all very nice and informative. We wanted to catch the shark talk before venturing out onto the reef and snorkeling with them. It was a great thing to do as we felt well informed and keen to see the reef sharks rather than fearing them after this. Thanks to the staff at the Cairns Aquarium."
95,Great aquarium,"We love to visit aquariums as often they are one of the sanctuaries for rare and endangered wildlife. Cairns aquariums design is somewhat unique with a massive reef tank spread over 3 floors, also freshwater wildlife, reptiles, invertebrates and a touch pool. An excellent visit for all."
96,Very good,One of the best aquariums I have been in. The exhibits are very well presented. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable.  A 'must see' place to visit in Cairns. Very highly recommended.
97,A great experience ,I loved this aquarium.  I was interested in seeing tropical and local creatures and I found lots of them at the aquarium.  The displays are directed at all ages.  Any age would enjoy the glass tunnel walking through the beautiful aquarium itself.
98,Stunning reef on the shore,"The Cairns Aquarium is outstanding and a must for visitors to Cairns. However, the 5D show was a waste of time and nowhere as good as other 5D shows that are done in the round"
99,Visit,"We booked the Platinum Experience & would recommend it highly!  It included scatter feeding as well as ray feeding, a terrific part of our visit. Our tour guide (Christine) is knowledgeable, personable & well-prepared. And Beth, ray expert, is a real asset to the aquarium, so enthused with the rays.  We enjoyed them both & they really made our experience extra-special! Tip: take your time & don’t rush! This is a world-class aquarium, easily compared to Monteray Bay (USA), Sydney Reef HQ (Townsville) or Maalaea (Maui).  Cairns Aquarium is quite simply amazing. On-site restaurant Dundee’s is also good; we enjoyed a fine lunch."
100,Cairns Aq Visit,Nice place for young kids if they can’t go out to the reef. Very good presentations thru out the day. Favorite exhibit was the dangers of the deep. Good interactive displays as well
101,"A nice, little aquarium","We enjoyed our visit to the Aquarium, great displays, easy to get around and great to have an activity when we had a rainy morning on one of our days."
102,Fascinating Place,"Cairns aquarium has a wide array of fish, corals and other sea animals. They are very well presented. It is a must see if you are visiting Cairns. You can virtually see Barrier Reef here."
103,Amazing experience!,The acquarium is well set up for an easy walk around and the viewing areas are impressive and can cater for a large number of people at a time.  Lots to see and informative plaques to learn more of what you are looking at.  an easy 2 hours plus visit
104,Magical Experience,"Nice to look at but definitely not worth the money you get a better experience at other places in Queensland with sea creatures at half price, cost $44.00 EA for an hour at most to get around."
105,"Fantastic Acquarium, very friendly staff, but presentations very hard to follow","Had a great morning exploring the Cairns Aquarium, headlined by getting to watch three divers feed the sharks and rays in the large aquarium tank. It’s not the biggest aquariums but one of the best for the range of exhibits and fish life. It was very clean, modern and well kept. We went on a busy morning, with lots of families and a school group, but it never felt too hectic. Would recommend to families and those interested in the underwater world. The photo is just the top of the aquarium’s 10m deep tank!"
106,Beautiful tropical aquarium,"This is a brilliant aquarium! Loved it! The cleanest and best presented wildlife attraction I have been to in Cairns. I would highly recommend anyone to visit, great for all ages."
107,Entertaining,"Not overly large, but not tiny either. So easy to do this aquarium in a morning. Staff are friendly and helpful, and their shows are informative and interactive."
108,absolutely fabulous.,Needing to fill in time before our flight we ventured into the aquarium. This is a good aquarium and well laid out. I enjoyed it more than my teenagers but even they liked some of the fish on display. Good way to spend a couple of hours and smaller kids will have a blast as will older folk like me who appreciate what's in our oceans.
109,Had good time & Highly Recommend it,I went by myself as an afternoon activity and ended up going through twice! Fantastic aquarium with really cool and impressive tanks/exhibits. The animals all look so healthy and happy too :)
110,Great aquarium,"Learnt alot listening to all the talks , totally enjoyed the whole experience. Even saw a shark give birth right infront of us ,amazing . So relaxing watching the fish move about and watching the feeding was fun."
111,Aquatic Adventures,"Very friendly staff, who were informative and passionate about the aquarium, an enjoyable afternoon."
112,Nice stop on a hot day,A wonderful trip into the secrets of the ocean. Each section was clearly signed and informative. The tanks surround you and give you the sense of being in the ocean. The water was clean and the glass was crystal clear.
113,VIP Platinum Pass was AMAZING!,"This is a world class destination in the Cairns CBD.  It has a myriad of creatures from the Barrier Reef in huge walk through aquarium tanks. A fantastic destination for children, adults and especially for the disabled or the aged."
114,Wonderful exhibition of wild life,"What a delight the Cairns aquarium is, it is beautiful to look at with a lovely resturant to one side. The behind the scenes tour is with a small group of people with a guide and they take you into the workings of the aquarium. First we went to the hospital and whatever is in the tank needs medical help, and all this is explained to you with plenty of time to ask questions and get all the information as to what the animal needs to get better and be released back into the wild if it can be done. Further on the show you how they clean the water and filter it back though to the tanks, looking after the baby fish in rediness for  going on show. It is not a lengthy tour but it is very informative. After doing the tour you can wander through the aquarium at your lesuire or get your hand stamped and go and have a coffee or lunch ( lunch is part of the ticket price you paid for) , then go back in,and the shop is great, something for everyone. The aquarium is central in the city, cnr of Florence St and Abbott St one block from the esplanade. Well worth the visit."
115,Educational and fun,"Great aquarium in a small space, with lovely large ocean tanks. Your path follows the chain of connection from the rainforest, through mangroves to the reef and beyond to the deep sea. Many sharks too! Highly recommend!"
116,"The aquarium was nice, a good thing to do on a hot day!","What a wonderful place, set up as an ecological learning journey from fresh water billabongs to the deepest sections of the coral sea, all presented by an icredibly helpful, friendly fun and knowledgeable bunch of aquanuts easily the best thing to do in cairns !!!!!"
117,Surprised by this attraction,"during our trip in cairns we visited the aquarium and found it was your typical level aquarium. Had everything you would expect and was large enough. As 2 adults, we spent about 1 hour 15 working our way through, it was very enjoyable!"
118,Wow what a great place to visit and learn,"We bought a package of entry to the Aquarium and lunch. While the Aquarium was very good, lunch blew us away. We love the lower and up levels. You could see all the animals are very well cared for. Their tanks and enclosures were exceptionally clean. The staff were fabulous. Now for lunch. My husband had crocodile springrolls and I had Chilli Calamari both were served with chips and salad and delicious, included in the package was a drink and we had a glass of wine each. Great day out."
119,Interesting and informative,"What a fantastic night, worth every cent. When everyone goes home the lights are dimmed and the nocturnal fish and reptiles come to life. We had an enthusiastic guide, who knew every fish, snake, eel ect by name. After going through 4 habitats we sat down to a yummy 5 star 2 course dinner. Loved every minute."
120,Just Okay,"We are big fans of aquariums and have visited them in many cities. The Cairns Aquarium was nicely laid out and had a very good representation of the life found on the Great Barrier Reef.They had several shows scheduled throughout the day, of which we attended only two. The main reason for this is that the aquarium was not really large enough to hold my interest for more than a couple of hours. We were able to see everything in that amount of time.I would recommend anyone that enjoys aquariums to visit, but don't expect to make a day of it. (Additionally, go to the botanical gardens in Cairns....they are incredible)."
121,Great activity for a hot day,"The new Aquarium is worth a visit for a chance to see The Great Barrier Reef marine life that you may not get a chance to see in the wild. The Aquarium is designed to show you how rain starts its journey from the mountain ranges, joins creeks, streams and flooded billabongs, travels through the Rainforest, past the Mangroves, through the Great Barrier Reef and finally into the Coral Sea. They have scheduled talks and feedings, but get in quick as there is limited seating. The displays are well set up and very colourful. For an extra $20 each adult you can add a back tour to see how Turtles are cared for and rehabilitated then see all the work that goes on behind the scene to keep the Marine World going. Check to see if they have any Turtles being rehabilitated first, not worth doing overwise. You will also see how the Aquarium is growing its own Coral to go into their tanks and hopefully other Aquariums.The Aquarium is a great place to take the kids to get out of the heat. There is food and souvenirs on sale. You can also add a special lunch to your ticket price."
122,Stunning aquarium,"Had been wanting to visit this for ages and did so during a spare day.Loved the new aquarium,very well set up and informative."
123,Unexpected gem!,"This is a really good aquarium! We entered in the early afternoon and almost hurried to get round before closing there is so much to see and enjoy. Interesting to see that locals enjoy a discount; as OAP visitors with a voucher, we enjoyed a bigger discount. But it's not about the money it's about the enjoyment and the education here. Staff are typically friendly and informative, always happy to explain & chat. The whole aquarium layout follows the course of a river from stream to sea looking at the creatures at each stage. The tanks are fabulous one of them holding 1.5 Million litres of water. So many types of aquatic creatures, sharks, rays, a huge range and very comparable in quality if not in size to Monterey. A bit expensive and, yes, maybe it should stay open a bit longer into the evening."
124,Great place to go in Cairns,A lovely well laid out place with several interesting habitats.   It's easily negotiable for wheel chair or walker.  Staff is well informed and happy to answer questions.About 2 hours to see everything.
125,Wonderful Cairns Aquarium,"We spent a most enjoyable visit to this superb Cairns Aquarium which showcases all the teaming colourful and beautiful shore and sea-life in and around Cairns. So much to see and enjoy all superbly explained.. Thank you very much indeed.Pauline Alexander, Violeta and Alan Courtney"
126,Very informative,Fascinating insight to the world of the Great Barrier Reef. Very knowledgeable staff who give highly informative talks. An immense amount of creatures to see. Ideal for kids as well.
127,A small 'Great Barrier Reef',The aquarium is really nicely done and very informative. Had a lovely morning strolling about. Not enough there to last more than 90 mins and 5D experience wasn’t great. Overall worth a visit.
128,Aquarium visit,This is one of the finest Aquaria I have visited with excellent talks periodically through the day and they have even begun a new program for divers to go into the shark and ray tank.
129,Fantastic,This was unexpected high quality of an Aquarium. We could se many of the fishes one couuld see while snorkling the Great Barrier Reef.Comes Highly recommended.
130,Amazing and very informative,What a great place to visit! I took the kids to the Aquarium as they’ve always been fascinated with any animals or creatures found in the water. I was amazed at how tony the seahorses were.  All the tanks were super clean which made everything easy to see. And in this crazy time of COVID-19 it was so good not to have to try and see around people. Best time to visit would be now 👌🏼
131,A MUST SEE EXPERIENCE,"A fun place to visit. Following the set route (some people through they would do it backwards lol) there are scores of fish in tanks, plus displays with snakes, frogs and even stick insects. We especially liked the various turtles. The crocodiles were very small. We expected larger crocs given that we were in cairns. The final area has a huge wraparound tank with many different types of fish, rays and sharks, very interesting to sit and watch."
132,They offer diving with the sharks - so long as you're not on one of the most common medications,"Overall an enjoyable experience. While not as big as other aquariums that may exist elsewhere, overall it delivers value for money."
133,"Must see, exceptional. ","Spent a very enjoyable half day here and and despite it not being school holidays its was very popular with visitors of all ages.The talks presented by the very friendly and professional staff were very informative and well presented- just enough detail and not too long but you need to be there early to have the opportunity to listen to all the talks. The exhibits are excellent and can be easily watched for extended periods of time, especially those in the large tanks. The day I visited they were doing the weekly cleaning of one of the tanks and this was also very interesting - underwater vacuuming.The admission charge may seem a little high but it represents excellent value for  money."
134,"Nice Aquarium overall, smaller than expected.","What a well organised and educational self guided tour this was.  The aquarium is well laid out, a sort of one way system, with all sorts of ""exhibits"".  We saw someone swimming in a tank with sharks.  If you want a look at what you might see on the Great Barrier Reef, this is the place.  Well worth the entrance money."
135,Absolutely lovely.,"Great way to spend hours, slightly expensive - but worth itMasses to see and frequent talks by great staff who know loadsAmazing fish etcShould stay open into the evening...?"
136,Cairns must see,My husband and I visited with our 3 month old son who loved looking st the fish and wonderful colours. Beautifully designed aquarium and pram and wheelchair friendly. Some amazing species we havent seen before. Its made us even more excited to go for a snorkel on the reef. Highly recommend
137,pretty,The facility is clean and bright but a bit costly for the number of exhibits. Made it through in about an hour. Did watch a nice presentation on sharks but a very bright gentleman.
138,MSB CHENNAI AT CAIRNS,"We visited the aquarium today with my husband. We were fascinated about the bio diversity of the marine world down the aquarium. We were able to see how two divers fed the mantra rays and the sharks. It was an amazing experience. We have learned a lot more about the Coral Reef,it’s functional meaning to us all. I highly recommend a visit there. P.S. we also tried the 5D video,extra cost per person 12AUD, it shows you two films one about the reef and one about the Antarctic. It’s unique!"
139,Fabulous,It was really good and also educational trip since we followed some of the presentations. Presenters seemed to know very well subject they were presenting. The exhibit flow was very well thought of and it was easy to go on. And I'm now way less afraid of sharks than before.
140,Fantastic experience!,"We went to the 11am feeding of the sharks and stingrays and we loved it.  It was so interesting and we really enjoyed learning about the marine life, especially the sharks.  We also went to the following information talk by a scuba diver which was great as well."
141,Great for kids and adults,Staff were attentive throughout the meal went that extra mile it was a pleasure to visit and a great dining experience
142,Mr,The whole ecosystem of the Cairns area is quite complex. The aquarium presented the wide range of this ecosystem in a way that was both informative and eye-opening while at the same time presented in such a way that was simple enough to comprehend. Loved the huge tanks full of a variety of fish.
143,Living Coral display beyond disappointing - it was an absolute horror.,"The aquarium was nice. I felt it was a little expensive so it might not be inclusive to anyone who wants to go, more of a private business than a public education service. There were some beautiful displays. I noticed a lot of information on their beautiful sawfish and hope they are doing some conservation work for the species."
144,One of the very best,"We spent nearly a whole day at the aquarium. So much to see. Lots of information and interesting for all our 4 children (age 11,9,6&4). Staff very helpful."
145,Townsville vs Cairns ? - Both Brilliant,Very nice place. Wide variety of beautiful fish. It will take around 3-4 hours to cover the entire place. Half a day activity.
146,"Great place to visit, knowledgable staff ","Visited the Aquarium when found myself with couple of hours to kill.  Found it well set out so that could easily see the differing areas, like mangroves, rivers, ocean and the fish seemed well looked after."
147,Very Impressive Displays & Educational,"lovely day out with the family,  would highly recommend this attraction- plenty of space to move and enough to room to see all attractions"
148,beautiful,"I found my spur of the moment visit great.  A super awesome display and exhibits with some fish I never expected to see in an aquarium, definitely recommend checking out the aquarium"
149,Cairns aquarium,Magnificent. Every thing so well set out. Loved the lot. Good to be able to sit and watch if you wanted.
150,AA,Trip was a welcome relief from the humidity and was clean well laid out and fairly informative however lacks value for money we managed to spend a little over an hour looking around maybe due to being not busy we were able to look at all exhibits easily and relatively quickly there were no schedule keeper talks close to arrival or departure time so was unable to take advantage of these
151,Very well presented.,"The Aquarium is a good place to take the kids, but unless you buy the yearly pass and go quite often it is quite an expensive day out. Also a little disappointing that they don't have a large crocodile given it is North Queensland. The café inside is good because the fish tanks keep the kids entertained."
152,Worth a visit,This was a wonderful experience for my partner and I. We both love places like this and seeing the local fish and other species in the area. We came across creatures we have never seen before which was awesome too.
153,1st class,"During our visit we saw lots of presentations and saw some incredible animals! We also had the pleasure of talking with Alex, he was talking to us about the emerald monitors and gave lots of interesting into. He was more than Happy to answer all our questions and we had such a genuine chat with him, he very clearly loves his job and we could tell he has immense passion for the animals! The exhibits and aquariums are all beautifully set up and we had a great day!"
154,GREAT UNDER WATER AQUARIUM.....,"As my husband said, “the aquarium was unreal!” We went on a Platinum Package tour and fed fish and Cow-nosed rays, as well as seeing reptiles behind the scenes. Engaging, informative guides and educational and entertaining presentations and we learned so much. The restaurant was lovely too. Well worth a visit!"
155,Great Aquarium very impressed,"Cairns Aquarium, an absolute credit to the city.  The way this aquarium  is set up is pure genius . Educational regarding the complex environmental scenes that comprise reef/rainforest fauna in Cairns.Ticket is for all day and the cafe is a must a well."
156,Holiday activity,Aquarium opened at 10 People were queued out around the corner with a 30-45 minute wait 1-It rained - no cover especially for those with small children2- Still using paper based covid collection which further slowed queue3- those with prepaid tickets should have been able to go through and use a scan covid app4- minimal staff serving
157,Great small town aquarium,what a great place so much to see a full day is needed to take it all in the hand feeding of the sharks and other large fish and rays is fantastic to watch
158,Learning experience,We spent the morning walking through the aquarium and had a great time. Watch the mantra rays being fed. Bought a ticket via experience oz and it was cheaper Money worth spent
159,Visit the barrier reef while staying on land,"It's a small aquarium, which you can finish in under two hours. A little pricey considering its size, but they do have some nice big fish tanks."
160,Afternoon visit,Very good and Educational. Great talks throughout the mornings and afternoons if u miss any. The set up is good yet the exit was confusing
161,Cairns aquarium should't be missed,"We spent a fabulous couple of hours inside the aquarium, exploring the different eco-systems and listening to the excellent presentations. A brilliant experience and highly recommended."
162,All day acrivity,"Came here in November 2019.I have seen a few aquariums but this would have to be one of the best.This one also displayed native reptiles as well.Beautiful tank displays and some handling/touching demonstrations not to mention the magnificent feed time frenzy.The staff/presenters were awesome and very knowledgeable and very approachable too.I was visiting by myself but noticed the families with young children enjoying themselves as well.  I went out to lunch and returned later just to sit in the main tank/aquarium area.Just watching and being in awe of some of our marine wild life is a great/beautiful sight to see.For just $42 dollars general admission all day I would recommend.As Molly Meldrum would say ""do your self a favour"" and check out this establishment you won't be disappointed."
163,Cool experience ,This is a lovely way to spend a couple of hours - very different to the Townsville Aquarium - really really well done and the talks were terrific - Loved the Barra - they looked yummy - oh sorry !!!! - No they had a tremendous display of bio-diversity - Mangroves to the Reef - Lovely staff - great disabled access and facilities -
164,A great find,"Not what I was expecting. I’ve been to different Aquariums in several cities, Cairns Aquarium suffers in comparison to the other. Only a few things to see here and you can actually finish the whole lot in less than 20mins. I wasn’t in awe compared to the London Aquarium, Buerger Zoo in Netherlands, Manila Ocean Park, etc. Considering this is a zoo by the Great Barrier Reef, you would expect more."
165,Very well done display,It was a great time there and a lot to see. The kids got to interact with some things witch was great.
166,Visiting Cairns Aquarium,"Very beautiful aquarium, but definitely costs a lot more than others I've been to. I found that I could only really get about an hour out of it, which I felt was short compared to $$$."
167,Excellent ,"It was the first thing we visited in Cairns and enjoyed every bit of it.  Easy to navigate, fascinating to see the exhibits and staff were helpful and friendly.  We didnt see any crabs, but that could be just us not noticing them."
168,Beautiful aquarium well worth a visit for all ages,"Having visited many aquariums including The Blue Planet in Copenhagen and the Osaka Aquarium we weren't sure if we should bother with this small looking aquarium, especially since we had been to the Daintree and the reef earlier in our trip. In the end we decided to visit the Cairns Aquarium and I am so glad that we did. The exhibits are set up so that you follow a drop of rain as it falls into an outback QLD river and it travels through the rainforest to the reef and finally into the open ocean. We listened to 4 presentations during our visit, all of which were entertaining and just the right length not to be boring at all. We ended up spending 3 hours at the aquarium and loved every moment."
169,Great day out.,"we went the morning before our afternoon flight and it was a wonderful experience for the whole family, beautiful displays and very informative and a great way to fill in time, Highly recommend it"
170,Well worth a visit.,Have seen many aquariums in Australia. This was an interesting visit although Ihave probably seen better!  Nevertheless a pleasant outing but the blue light is very annoying as far as photos are concerned!!!
171,Watch Aquarium Reef fish while you dine,"We opted for the entry with lunch. The talks from the staff were informative and it was good to watch the feeidng in the shark tank. Lunch was two lovely courses with a glass of wine, a beer, or soft drink. A good choice in the restaurant and friendly service."
172,Superb aquarium,"We spent almost half a day here. The tanks are lovely and the walk-though (and under) tanks and tunnels are amazing. We went to only 1 talk (on the reef) and it was well presented by a very experienced diver, although I suspect some of his jokes/comments went over the heads of non English speakers.Don't miss the tanks with the soft corals and the jellyfish - both are mesmerising.It seems that there are no concessional entry fees available.The lady on the entry desk was lovely - when we accidentally left the display area before looking at everything and we couldn't get back in she was very understanding and got us back in."
173,A great way to spend a morning,"This aquarium is so much  more than that.  It tells  the story of the riverine and  marine  environment from the first drops of rain in the catchments in the mountains and Savannah lands to the oceans and reefs. Too much to detail here, all I can say is go and see for yourself if you have any interest in the environment. Allow at minimum half a day for your visit, it will be  well worth it.If you  want you  can also book a dive with the sharks!"
174,a great escape from the heat,"Feels a bit overpriced for the experience you get. Terrible restaurant experience, we had booked our entry tickets and done all the obligatory corona questionnaire and wanted to dine at the restaurant before going through however when we went to restaurant they informed us they only had basic premade sandwiches, this was at 11am so not sure why. We had to leave to get food and then return later in the day. When we went the morning bustle had finished so there wasn't as much foot traffic and noise. We got to spend a lot of uninterrupted time looking at fish and enjoying the relaxing atmosphere. We would probably only do this once as a couple unless we were bringing children here. Exit through a giftshop with conveniently located brightly coloured toys that children would spot and want. It did inspire us to look into buying our own fishtank at some point."
175,Enlightening Experience,Absolutely stunning. A must do. The exhibition is user friendly and  very well organised and presented.
176,all encompassing,Enjoyed the experience Expected more tunnels with water and life surrounding you Great Senior Citizen discounts Definitely with a couple of hours Brilliant passes - access for the day so you can visit more than once
177,Lovely aquarium,"Went to this Aquuarium with my partner, yes it has a decent entry price but we spent around 2 hours there and seeing what they have on display and the facility you will then appreciate the entry price and the imagination of the up keep on the displays and fish within the tanks. They have divers in the tanks at feeding times and run a full commentary for visitors.Would recommend you put this one on your list whilst in Cairns."
178,Excellent service by all,"Isn’t a small aquarium, we walked through at our own pace. Very similar to other aquariums we have visited."
179,Great activity,"Went wandering through the Aquarium and have to say was very impressed.  Not too big but there was certainly a big selection of different fish from not only beaches, but the mangroves and rivers!."
180,if you want to see reef fish up close Cairns aquarium,"What a great experience! We booked the aquarium tour by night and ended up to be the only customers so we had a private tour! We were greeted by the staff of Dundee's restaurant with a glass of wine, then started our tour. Our tour guide Sandy Taylor was awesome. Very informative and friendly. Halfway through our tour we were given an appetizer and after the tour a table with a view of a wall aquarium.It was a great compliment to our snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef the next day, as we saw  fish that we learned about at the aquarium. Sandy was knowledgeable and passionate and so patient with our billion pictures and questions. I highly recommend Aquarium by Night."
181,"Excellent Visit, a must do","I knew the old Aquarium at ""The PIER"" on the Marina. That was little and just ok. Now after I missed my visit last year, this year was for my 1. time in the new built Aquarium. It is much much better than the old one, so beautiful to see all the new rooms, aquariums and the new sea life tunnel. Its huge and lots to see. Just the entree 42 $ was a bit shocking for my 2 hours walk through all areas. Ok, the stuff said, I could come back on same day to visit it again.  But I didn´t"
182,Great Aquarium,A very well cared-for aquarium with excellent displays. Put it on your list of things to do in Cairns.
183,Wonderful setup,The Cairns Aquarium was one of the highlights of our visit to Far North Queensland.  It is a fantastic attraction for adults as well as children. Highly recommended.
184,A brilliant end to our Cairns trip,"Great place to spend a few hours speaking to the fish and having a bite to eat with the fish..The restaurant is fantastic with the full wall aquarium, keeps all happy and quiet while eating and relaxing."
185,Well worth it,"Break your visits to the Reef and the Daintree Rainforest with several hours at this new and very well laid out aquarium. Lectures almost every half hour complement the viewing, and children as well as adults get involved in the Q&A periods that follow. The tunnel with fish swimming over and around you is a visual and photographic treat. The aquarium is growing as new fishlife are added. Supplement the visit with lunch or a snack on the attractive terrace of the attached cafe restaurant."
186,Quality attraction ,Well presented and explained. No snack type restaurant but a high quality Italian attached. Not quite right for families.
187,Impressive,Easy access to the Cairns Aquarium from the CBD and most hotels and apartments accommodations. First impression of the place is a welcome sight as expressed by the friendly staffs at the main entrance. The presentations by the staffs during the tour of the Aquarium is awesome.
188,Okay but expensive ,what a superb venue well worth a visit if you are in the Cairns area. informative talks on the different types of fish. you get to see everything close up
189,Fantastic!,"We had a lovely visit it has many thanks but also lots of information, this is my hubby's thing not mine but I really enjoyed it and so impressed with the tunnel and the largest TANK I have ever seen!!!"
190,so expensive,"Many of the displays are generally OK - especially the freshwater tanks. But, sorry, I am going to have to mark you down hard, and it's all because of one tank.As a dedicated 'Reefer' of 20+ years (i.e. Amature aquarium keepers, at the pinnacle of the hobby, successfully keeping live SPS Hard Coral in our homes) I went to the aquarium looking for inspiration from the professionals.When I finally made my way to the single living coral display, which housed only some sad looking Soft Corals and LPS, my initial disappointment turned to pure horror.The tank was infested (and I mean almost every inch of the surface) with Aiptasia. These disgusting 'Glass Anemones' thrive in poorly maintained aquariums and are a sign of neglect. In the Reefing community finding even one in our tanks means radical action to eradicate -or end up with something like the picture I am posting of your display.Lack of Staff, Time or funding are not excuses here either - this could have been fixed with Filefish, Butterfly Fish and Peppermint Shrimps. But as it stands now the only option you have is to drain the tank and literally “burn-it-with-fire”.You are at the gateway of the Reef and you have Cairns Marine a short drive away - A ten grand investment in Ecotech Radions & MP60's plus a big-arse ATS would be all you need to do what guys like myself do all over the country - You have no excuse not to have the best SPS coral display in Australia.My recommendation for readers here is;  if you have an interest in Freshwater species or want to see marine fish and sharks without getting on a boat then, sure, visit here. But if you are looking to see the amazing creatures that make up the largest living organism on earth, then don’t waste your money at the Aquarium and don’t be lazy – get on a boat, get wet, and go see it yourself – either that or come over to my place in Melbourne."
191,Nice experience,"We are lucky on the day we visited this aquarium. Since it was a Monday not so many people around. Basically we have the whole area to ourselves. We have all the time to look, read the descriptions and study in detail all insects, mammals, fishes and every resident in the aquarium. By far it was the most educational attraction we have visited  here in Cairns. Go there and visit early to avoid the crowds."
192,Nice aquarium,This is for everyone to enjoy and learn about the reef and rainforest of northern Queensland. Take the time to listen to the informative talks to widen your knowledge of the reef and rainforest. The staff are very knowledgeable and ready to answer any questions. Get up close and personal with so many creatures from the area.
193,Great Aquarium.,We visited 90 mins after opening on a rainy Sunday and expected crowds. Apart from a temporary bit of congestion in the oceanarium during a presentation we found it easy to move around the building. The walk-through tunnel is one of the nicest I have seen. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable and the complex was spotlessly clean. This may not be the largest aquarium but it has more than enough to fill a couple of hours. Visiting the aquarium is a great way to understand the reef and the waterways of Far North Queensland.
194,❤️ This Aquarium,Opened about 10 am  friendly staff  online says about 2 hours to complete Aquarium but due to COVID it only took about 30 mins  amazing set up and the animals and tanks were well looked after staff were friendly an decently priced
195,Clean and open but pricey for the amount of displays,Our visit to the Cairns Aquarium was very enjoyable. The staff was friendly and we were able to move at a leisurely pace.
196,Value for money ,"Decided to check out the Aquarium on the recommendation of a friend.Entry is NOT free.  But the prices are reasonable. $68 for two seniors.You are given a map and basic directions  and advice on what and where to go. The Aquarium is on two levels.  There are information sessions on at various times.Explanations on types of reef fish and sharks and there is a touch pool where you can get up close with some of the sea creatures.If you haven't seen live coral then i can recommend the Aquarium. There isn't a big display as the Aquarium is relatively new, but what's there is colourful and vibrant.Save yourself hundreds of $'s.I've been to a number of tourist areas on the outer barrier reef and the coral is either dead or bleached and nothing like what's in the aquarium.Well worth a visit."
197,Blue as under the sea,"My partner and I visited the Cairns Aquarium for the package including: 2-2.5 HOUR night tour, 3 course dinner and a drink on arrival...and we are so glad that we did! The tour was so special, the mix of blue light, black rooms made it seem like we were in a dream. The tour guide was excellent, making the tour so interesting to learn about the facts behind finding 'Finding Nemo' to which of the various animals have bitten/stung/spat on her. The food was second to none - the flavours were absolutely divine, the presentation Instagram worthy, and the service (in particular from Seb) was phenomenal....this last minute decision turned into one of the best parts of our holiday to Cairns."
198,Cairns Aquarium,"Being a local and also seeing other aquariums overseas and regularly going out to the Great Barrier Reef, I was sceptical but was very surprised. It is really well done great displays and staff are very knowledgeable. I learnt lots myself. Well worth a visit, get a guided tour very informative."
199,A must do!,Visited the aquarium as part of great tour it opens at 10am got the tickets as this was part of a tour booked lunch  then they gave me a map it is on 2levels with escalators we'll set out with video presentation also don't miss the fish feeding the quide Matilda's will give you a most comprehensive talk on the various fish a most enjoyable morning they also have rainforest section with snakes lissards gekos etc don't miss the fish feeding staff more knowledgeable than the Townsville aquarium
200,Cairns Aquarium,"We were a little concerned that this would be a kiddie attraction, and at a 42AUD entry were not sure it would be worth it.  Were we ever wrong!!!!This aquarium is spectacular.  Loved the walk through tank with sharks and rays.  The coral exhibits are fascinating. Recommend attending the short sessions with the experts.  A great complement to visiting the reef, we were able to see many different species of marine life that we did not see when when actually in the water.  At the aquarium, we learned how to appreciate the reef and protect it.   Perhaps we should have gone here first, we would have been smarter visitors."
201,Great Experience,Spent several hours at the aquarium and was very impressed... the shows are great and the flow of the set up is very good a little bit pricey but well worth a visit
202,Behind the scenes,This would add value to anyone who was about to go on a reef trip as you get a close look at some of the fish/coral and the staff are very knowledgeable. Highly recommend the presentation at the Deep Reef Amphitheatre on level 1 - the presenter spent many years as a diver/guide and knows so much about the reef and genuinely cares about it. Great way to spend a couple of hours and learnt a lot from the visit too. Have heard lunch next door is good too.
203,Amazing!!!,"Great day, the problem we had were that in some of the tanks there would be a particular animal which was not listed on the little signs stating the animals for that tank, which left us wanting to know what it was, but overall, a lovely day."
204,Impressive!,The Aquarium was close by to our accommodation and we wanted to visit before going out on our reef cruise to get to know the types of marine life we would see and familiarise ourselves with information on the coral reef. The aquarium did not disappoint it had so many different species of marine life and reptiles including a touch tank. It was very well set out and over two levels.  We enjoyed our visit you should allow two hours for this. They also have a gift shop that has some really good quality souvenirs and a restaurant attached that’s opened day and night. Great place to visit and learn about the environment you’re visiting.
205,Terrific ,We visited the Aquarium not long after it opened( as this review is at alater date I cannot put in the correct date of travel) and were very pleased with the whole experience.It is up there with the many top Aquariums in the world.If you don't want to take a boat trip to the reef then this is the nxt best thing.
206,Interesting and Informative,"I cannot stress enough how absolutely brilliant the Aquarium is in every way. Not only do they have a wide variety of aquatic wildlife and education programs open to the public, but the sheer amount of tours this place offers. I’ve been through the aquarium many times and always fell in love with the dedication Andrew, Daniel and the team have to creating a truly magical place, helping the environment and bringing people together in the best way. Today I went diving with the sharks and the beautiful honeycomb stingrays! It was a dream to be laying next to a real shark just centimeters away and watching the huge stingrays glide above us. Thank you to my incredible dive instructor Sean for guiding me! Highly recommend!"
207,A walk in the ocean,Recommend it by a local friend & enjoyed it indeed. It's prefect to fit with your half day schedule.
208,Fabulous,"If you snorkeled or dived , you never saw all this aquarium has to offer. It was amazing beyond all !"
209,A Cool Activity,"Receptionist explained everything the day I booked it and let us into the aquarium to see where we would diving. Got introduced to Sean who would be our dive guide.Arrives early the following day so we could look around the aquarium and listen to all the talks regarding coral reef life and sharks. Saw all the fish being fed. Good to see the sharks eating BEFORE we dived with them ha ha. Sean explained everything in detail and made us feel at ease. Got to see behind the scenes which was amazing. The dive was great fun. Very surreal diving inside a huge fish tank with other customers watching. Got some great footage of my girlfriend lying down next to a shark. Had a brilliant time.After the dive we spent the rest of the day back on the other side of the glass watching all the fish, sharks and rays. Had a really good day. Staff were brilliant. 10/10"
210,Enjoyable 1/2 day activity,It was a great learning experience. The tour guide was very clear.The school students learnt a great deal about the variety of aquatic organisms.The habitat and unique characteristics were well explained by the guide.
211,Fantastic place,"Was Happy to hear the aquarium had reopened after the Covid 19 experience. Had a lovely morning in the aquarium, kids enjoyed themselves,staff were lovely until we reached the gift shop. Upon entering the gift shop i heard the staff member rudely speaking to a customer who quickly ducked back in(about 3 metres from the exit from the aquarium walking into the gift shop)to get his 2year old who ran back into to look at the fish. She then was openly complaining about him to other customers,whilst rolling her eyes. My daughter picked up an icecream from the fridge. I asked her to put it back as it was too early in the morning. My 10yr old daughter who has spina bifida and Hand contractures(physical disability with her hands) accidently dropped the icecream,still in the packet. The staff member stands up,rolls her eyes,huffing and puffing and yells at my daughter- ""you just threw it under the fridge!!!"" I was horrified.My daughter walked out in tears,saying she wishes she didnt have disabilities so people wont get angry at her!! This staff member had complained or had a problem with every person that entered that gift shop and is then ""yelling"" at children with disabilities. If she cant handle dealing with families/Children perhaps she should get a job elsewhere. The customers who pay for their families to enter the aquarium are the reason she has a job in the first place. Perhaps learn some respect or undertake some form of customer service training because her attitude it absolutely disgusting."
212,Surprising Little Gem in an Even Littler Town,"Had planned on visiting the Aquarium since it opened, finding the time was the thing, well made time and extremely glad we did. My partner, her daughter and I visited on the weekend and i have to admit it was fantastic. The exhibits are well set up, you venture from fresh water habitats to the reef also includes some rainforest creatures, if you have children they will love it, I have been to the other aquariums overseas and this is up there with them. The marine creatures and fish are something else, being up close you get to see things you might not see on the reef, staff are great, very helpful and everything is clean and well kept. Can highly recommend a visit to Cairns Aquarium."
213,Very interesting,The Aquarium was okay. It’s nowhere as big or interesting as other Aquariums that we have been to. It’s a bit pricey at $42 per adult. There are different rates for Cairns people. I find that really discriminating!
214,a great place to visit,"The aquarium is relatively small compared to others. However, that is actually an advantage as it limits itself to the local fresh and salt water fauna rather than trying to show specimens from all over the world. The salt water exhibit was particularly interesting. They have different tanks sorted by fish color. While that might sound goofy, it is actually very instructive. The fish have colors based on their habitat (i.e. depth) and by grouping them, their commonality is really highlighted. I have never seen it that way anywhere else it is very well made. Definitely recommended if in Cairns."
215,"An engaging education, advocacy and conservation resource","This is without doubt the best aquarium I have ever been to.  At just under 2 years since opening, it offers the most amazing viewing of reef and other aquatic species in authentic-looking exhibits.  So colourful and well planned - well worth a visit.Dundees restaurant is attached to the aquarium (accessed from Florence St) and there is an enormous fish tank the length of one wall to gaze at whilst waiting for delicious food"
216,Outstanding Attraction,"Too long too boring. The presenter talked too much and not to the point,  just like this review, you have to type full 100 characters."
217,Great ,Luckily for us the aquarium was opening as it started to drizzle when we got into Cairns. The kids loved the tour and had a great time reading all the information and seeing the fish and reptiles. The touch pond was great educational tool for the kids to get their hands on a few of the marine creatures.
218,Simple yet greatly informative,"My family loves small zoos and aquariums. The closing of the Tropical Zoo north of Cairns was a hit but the Aquarium is filling our hearts again. We visit Cairns for holiday once a year and we are proud annual pass holders. We love being able to pop in for a few hours rather than feeling the need to push the kids to stay to get the full out of a single day pass. It's also better for the aquarium so win-win. We enjoyed all the interactions our kids had with the staff, from petting animals to the talks. We also got a behind the scenes tour which was fun, but a bit boring for younger kids (all under 6). I loved it. We will be renewing our annual passes soon as we get ready for our next holiday to Cairns!"
219,OUTSTANDING,"I love aquariums, and always visit them if the city I am visiting has one. I was pleasantly surprised by the real quality of this aquarium in a city the size of Cairns. Beautifully kept, thoughtful exhibits. I leaned a lot. Helpful staff also. And a great restaurant attached with a big tank to view while you eat."
220,Well worth visiting ,"Small aquarium in size, but one of the best tanks I have seen for a long time. Extends over at least 2 floors, showing the reef drop off and it is just spectacular. Definitely worth a visit."
221,Amazing exhibits,"When we bought this, we figured we were paying for a semi-private tour of the aquarium and that dinner would be an afterthought.  That was not the case.  This was a really wonderful and complete experience, and I fully recommend it for adults who love fauna and want an opportunity to learn more about the aquatic life around Cairns.You start with a drink in the lobby, and then the group (there were only about 10 of us) moves through the aquarium with a guide.  Alex, our guide, was very knowledgeable and friendly- bordering on bombastic!  The aquarium houses only life found in the region, and he knew a lot about the animals.  We learned a lot and were treated to some amusing anecdotes about the behaviors of some of the fish in the aquarium.Appetizers were served during the tour (I recommend the crocodile spring rolls), and it concludes with a beautiful meal in the restaurant.  The food was incredible: I had the steak, and it was perfectly prepared with well-balanced sides.  The restaurant service was excellent, and we enjoyed watching the fish in the tank at the restaurant.I cannot recommend this highly enough- it was really a highlight of our trip!"
222,Amazing Aquarium,Visited with my sister after having been out to the reef. Very impressive setup considering how small Cairns is. Best part was the extra tour behind the scenes where they have animals in rehabilitation. Worst was the 4D? 5D show? That was lame and a waste of money.
223,"forget snorkelling, see the reef life & stay dry",I had the wonderful experience of visiting this Aquarium recently. I was there for 3 hours and learned so much about reef marine life.Saw many live sea creatures and had excellent guides giving valuable information. I was impressed with their ability to answer questgons and the enthusisasm they showed towards all tourists.
224,Interesting presentation taking you from the rain forest to the sea.,"We visited the aquarium in Cairns with the family and spent over 2 hours. We took the Behind the Scenes Tour and I am so glad we did! our tour guide was the best. Seeing the turtle rehab and manta rays was one of the highlights.  Definitely worth a visit, the staff are great! loved this experience in Cairns."
225,Waited 3 years for the Cairns Aquarium to open.,We decided to visit the aquarium during the middle of the day when it was very hot. We were delighted with the experience. There were many interesting creatures that looked like they were very healthy and well taken care of in the facility. It took us about 2 hours to view everything and listen to some of the talks and watch the feedings. The price was $34 Australian for seniors and $42 Australian for adults.
226,Great place to visit,"Took a friend visiting during a hot summer day, beautiful insides and a great way to escape the heat.Took our time and soaked in all the wildlife. Must try!"
227,Aquarium,"I took three grandchildren here during a holiday to Cairns. There is so much to see here, so allow plenty of time for your visit."
228,Fantastic,We loved our visit to the Cairns Aquarium. It was good preparation for our snorkeling holiday at Port Douglas.Thank youFiona and Henrik
229,aquaium day out,Not a full day activity but certainly you can spend a comfortable 1/2 day there. I don’t think it’s quite as large as Melbourne Aquarium but still very enjoyable. We’re from Victoria and have RACV membership & we where able to call RACQ and buy tickets over the phone at a substantial saving
230,Amazing aquarium,"Very well laid out, and so interesting to walk around.  If you can't snorkel out at the Barrier Reef, have a walk around the aquarium and you will see just about everything here."
231,Just ok,"Though somewhat expensive, especially for seniors, it is an interesting way to spend an hour.  Extensive coverage of all sorts of marine life."
232,Absolutely Brilliant - Don't Miss This Place,My family and I visited and we had a lovely afternoon. So much to see. We did the turtle experience and it was fantastic.
233,Seriously good place,We enjoyed our visit to the aquarium. It was recommended by a friend who also visited Cairns recently. It was nicely set up and easy to get around.I’m glad that we visited the aquarium before we went on our snorkeling trip later on as we got to learn about reef fish beforehand.
234,Very Popular,"We visited here in early August 2019. Entry price is about $42/adult and $28/child. The place is very neat, clean and beautifully presented. You will find a wide range of fresh and salt water fish, including areas dedicated to mangrove and reef species. Signage is easy to read and helpful. Not cheap, but worth a visit."
235,Great place,Wow what a beautiful colourful fishies etc and amazing that divers feed the fishs sharks gave a hug so amazing I loves it will be back later
236,Don't miss,"We visited the aquarium on our last day in Cairns as we had time to kill. We selected the optional extra of the Behind the Scenes Tour and I am so glad we did! Cameron our tour guide was passionate and knowledgeable. Seeing the turtle rehab and the workings of the aquarium was truly fascinating! Be sure to call to enquire on the times of the tours to make sure you can fit it in as I couldn’t find it on the website. We also stayed for one of the free talks on Sharks which again was incredibly fascinating. I can’t remember the guides name but he had studied evolution in predators. His passion and knowledge made listening to him a pleasure and I just wanted to know more!Definitely worth a visit and attend one of the free talks, the staff are great!"
237,Overview of the Great Barrier Reef,"We took our time and read most displays and still got through in an hour, and the cost is well over $40, more needs to be added."
238,Informative,"We were advised by many of the locals to check out this museum, but did not have time in our schedule until our flight was delayed half a day. It was a fantastic experience with interactive attractions and educational talks periodically throughout the aquarium. We would definitely recommend this museum especially if you want to know more about Australia's local ocean animals."
239,Great place to spend a couple of hours!,Spent several hours here today. What a lovely and informative facility! Well worth a visit when in Cairns.
240,Interesting,"We visited at the start of October and bought tickets with a discount at ~$105.Both my wife and I are mad divers but not getting in the water much thanks to our 2 kids so this was an effective alternative for us. Our 4yo Boy liked it at times but got bored after a while - we were there for 2 hours so that might be understandable. If he did not get bored we probably would have stayed another hour.One of the things that made this Aquarium more interesting was the fish were fed during our visit and we got to see Lobsters and Stingrays merrily eating, our son loved this."
241,So beautiful,"Even with the Great Barrier Reef just around the corner, this aquarium is well worth a visit when in Cairns.The building and facilities are very roomy and modern with plenty of space to see the tanks even with plenty of people around. The staff are all very friendly and incredibly knowledgeable. The presentations are interesting and informative and it's worth picking their brains after the speeches if you have any questions or are curious about any of the animals. The animals appear to be in good health and it seems clear from a visitor's perspective that the staff strive to provide the utmost level of care for them.The tanks themselves are clean and really beautiful. I was impressed by the freshwater section at the entrance - the water looks crystal clear and there are lots of fascinating animals you may never have heard of. The sawfish Ziggy is just incredible and it's such a special opportunity to see one of these critically endangered animals for yourself.I really liked the concept of the aquarium (following a drop of water from the rainforest to the open ocean) and I also liked that there was variety in the size and shape of all the tanks. The kids that were there seemed to love the tunnels running through the freshwater turtle tank and the tank with the painted crays. The large shark tunnel is incredible and it was great to watch the sharks and rays get fed by divers.If you are a coral fanatic you may not want to have your expectations too high as corals are sparse throughout the aquarium apart from one medium-sized dedicated coral tank.To wrap up - a great outing while in Cairns. Incredible species from a range of local ecosystems, all of which seem really well cared for. Staff are super friendly and informative as is the signage besides the exhibits. There is something for everyone here. Highly recommend!"
242,Great half-day activity regardless of age,"We spent a couple of hours at the aquarium on a rainy day. It was great!The layout takes you from the rainforest to the rivers, the mangroves and out to the coral reef. It has everything but large crocodiles..."
243,Great afternoon out,"The Aquarium was good to spend a couple of hours walking through. I stayed for a couple of presentations that were quite informative. For the cost of entry, I felt a little disappointed."
244,Cairn Aquarium visit was enjoyable and informative. Graet focus on rivers and stream and the reef,"Make sure if you’re a family of four to get the family ticket. Also look online for discount codes to help with the cost. Your ticket is good for the entire day so if you want to leave for lunch and come back, you can. Lots of parking nearby. We enjoyed the two talks we went to. The feeding time one was great! It’s not the largest aquarium we’ve been to but we still enjoyed spending a couple of hours here."
245,Great,"Our visit to the Aquarium in August 2019 was just mind blowing. We had seen the Old one many years before but this Aquarium is just outstanding.  It cover all aspects of reef and marine life as well as other animals, the different floor layouts are fabulous. One of the best Aquariums we have visited. Certainly a lot easier than snorkelling and you don't get seasick."
246,Well presented aquarium displays,"Touted as Australia’s newest aquarium, the Cairns Aquarium didn’t disappoint. The flow through the different exhibits thoughtfully constructed to tell the story from inland Queensland through to the depths of the Great Barrier Reef. Great for kids, it showcases a huge variety of fish, sharks, rays, lizards, snakes, crocs, and more. The informative and engaging presentations from the staff had you learning something new regardless of age (who knew swordfish were rays) and the feeding times were entertaining.The layout while great from a story-telling perspective, can be a bit linear, and we found ourselves rushing through the exhibitions to make it to a presentation, then having to walk back to the start again to make our way through.When planning a visit, definitely consider confirming what time the first presentation is, and plan attendance based off that. Otherwise you’ll find yourself walking back and forward to get to see everything.Bring a camera and plan to stay for a couple hours.Don’t expect to pay to skip the queue though. It doesn’t seem to happen."
247,Worth a visit!,Excellent Aq....enjoyed the feeding showsVery well maintained Aq...good variety of all kinds of fishes....on Xmas Day and enjoyed photo with Scuba diving Santa
248,A great place to visit.,"We spent one and a half hour here and we had a wonderful guide, Maja! She was knowledgeable and entusiastic and she really could catch our attention! She also was a very good storyteller! The aquarium was very interesting and it is newly built. We enjoyed our stay here very much!"
249,Well worth the visit,"the entree should be not that expensive. your not gonna swim with the fishes, so why would put a price that is expensive, I think its $49 per adult and $30 somehow for the kids. how about the tourist that can't afford. same thing you can seen a typical aquarium. nothing exciting."
250,Awesome,"Thought it was going to be like others, but you do it for your, kids I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks"
251,Cairns Aquarium,"It has been mentioned a number of times in reviews that the admission fee seems steep at first, but it is worth every dollar. Could not agree more. Go there and see for yourself how great are the people who created and run this place for our enjoyment and education."
252,Loved it,"Visited Cairns for one day and decided to go to aquarium, very good decision, it is a very well laid out aquarium that is easy to get around for everyone, with plenty of information and lots of beautiful sea creatures"
253,Awesome Aquarium!!!,Could easily spend an entire day looking around. Fabulous facility. Thoroughly recommend to anyone with a couple of hours to spend.
254,Plenty to Sea!,Kids and I loved it.. Was a good experience.was a awesome morning out kids were impressed.. Thank you
255,Great overview of the local fauna,"My husband and I went here during our honeymoon. I enjoyed walking through the aquarium alright - it's similar to many other aquariums I've been to, but with a heavier focus on local aquatic life, so if you enjoy aquariums you'll probably like this one, too.I have a big problem, however, with their ""Diving With the Sharks"" experience. This is a new thing they offer and market during their shark talks at the aquarium. I heard about it and jumped at the chance to sign up and come back another day for the experience. And it's very safe - you're in maybe 4 meters of water and don't need any diving experience either, which was good because I didn't have any. What they don't tell you though, is that there are some pretty hard limitations. I am young, in relatively good shape, and have no medical problems, save for an anxiety disorder that I take the lowest dose available of a generic beta blocker for as needed. I don't take it every day and I've been on it off and on for years. But the aquarium cancelled the experience on me the day of, after I drove the hour and a half to get there and paid for tickets for my husband and I to enter the aquarium, because the anxiety and low dose beta blockers put me in their ""poor health"" category. The diving instructor claimed no one would let me dive, except perhaps in Indonesia where they ""don't care if you die."" He did offer for me to go to a health center to get a stress test for an additional $80 (on top of the $300 we paid for diving and the additional $45 we paid to get my husband into the aquarium to photograph me) but he discouraged it, claiming that it would likely be a waste of money because he didn't think any doctor would clear me. I insisted; I had spent the rest of our honeymoon hiking and snorkeling, so a stress test didn't seem like an issue. When he called, he said I couldn't get into a health center for the next three days (which, I'll just throw in there, feels unlikely.) My husband noted that he seemed gleeful about turning us away. They did refund me $255 for the diving, but getting to swim with sharks was a dream for me ever since I was a small child and I left the aquarium sobbing. If they had put in their information packet that anxiety and a beta blocker would exempt you from being able to dive, even when your cardiovascular health is good and it's such a low dose that you aren't prescribed it every day, then I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up or wasted a day of my honeymoon to do this."
256,Fantastic review over Carrier Reef Snorkling in the dry!,"This is a fairly new attraction in the city, which is conveniently located.  Walking distance from the city centre.  A very well designed aquarium which takes you through the wild life of the rivers, swamps, mangroves, reefs and the deep sea.  Fantastic shows, through out the walks, conveniently timed.  The shows were conducted by experienced and interesting individuals, who were witty, keeping the attention of the audience.  They were highly educational too.  Shark feeding by divers was the highlight for me."
257,One of the highlights of FNQ,This is a great experience especially if you don’t have time to go out to the reef. It takes you on a journey through freshwater fish and environment to estuary and then a big display of life on the coral reef. Lots of information plus presentations at different times. The colours are amazing. You are very close to have a good look and photos.
258,Great for kids and adults alike!!,Great place.  Lots of great stuff to see.  We were there on a day when the weather was bad.  We needed a place to hide from the wind and side ways rain! It was fun and interesting and a great way to spend a day when it was blowing in excess of 30 knots outside.  Worth the trip.
259,Educational but looking through the glass at the displays was disorientating.,I listen to 4CA talk back daily and when the GM was on the radio awhile back talking about the aquarium closure  and how the fish were getting lonely. I thought as soon as it opens I'm going.I was  so excited  and I was not disappointed  it was fabulous informing and your in another world all the displays were just Amazing.  I was just in ore and wandered around from one tank to another. You just don't realise what actually lives below.. the wonders of the sea world. And then to see the snake enclosures. Really take the kiddies along... It's a exciting venue for ALL age groups and  a very delightful  way to spend a lazy afternoon. Well done Cairns Aquarium. Next week I'm off to Hartleys. Your attraction is right up there one of the world's best. 11 out of 10.
260,Amazing - A MUST on your Cairns holiday,"Stopped in here to check it out as a bit of a time sink, pleasantly surprised with how vast and well presented this place is, compared to other aquariums this has lots to sea... see what I did there? Definitely stop in and check this place out if you are in town!"
261,Informative and fun for all,"I have an annual pass, so my son & I get to go to the Aquarium when ever we like. My son absolutely loves the aquarium, especially the BIG Shark tank. All the levels and exhibits are excellently presented, clean and the information about each animal is great. It's a place where tourists and locals alike can learn so much about the Rainforest and Reef - both are so important to us.The tickets may seem pricey, but it's worth it. The tanks where you can touch the animals are also a huge hit, lets you know how they feel and how they protect themselves from predators.It's fun, colourful, entertaining, informative and a great few hours out!Be sure to check it out"
262,Expected more,This place was amazing. Such a nice quiet serene place to go. I enjoyed every minute of it and it was very well priced. Would recommend the visit. And the fish and marine life there was amazing.
263,Nice but not as big as I had hoped.,"Loved the experience, relaxing and easy to get around even for my mum who is 75.  We were lucky enough to see a shark lay her eggs.  Restaurant wasn't open might be a good idea to put cafe opening time on the web site, especially during this covid period"
264,Aquarium Trip,We went to the aquarium with some friends who were visiting.  They did not want to do a reef trip so this was the perfect alternative.  The staff were very friendly and informative and we stayed about 3 hours and heard most of the planned activities.
265,Fun for the whole family,"First, I usually read the poorest reviews for places so I know the worse to expect. I found many of the complaints to be unfounded (or maybe corrected since written)....and the closing time of 5, last admittance of 4 is very clearly etched onto the windows.However, The aquarium was very well presented for its size. I found there to be quite a variety of local (re. Australian) species (which is all they carry, so if you’re expecting more than that....). We were able to learn about the environments and see well cared for animals in well done habitats. Again, the aquarium is smaller so it’s a 2-4 hour activity, but a great activity for a morning or afternoon. We also purchased the turtle hospital/behind the scenes tour. Christina did a great job explaining the turtle rehab and how they care for and then release their patients back to the wild. She also showed us how they introduce fishes to their tanks and the filtration system. This tour was well worth the $20 ($10 of which goes to directly to turtle rehab)."
266,Nice afternoon,Nice overview of the great barrier reef... Highly recommended trip. Just within the CBD of Cairns. Walking distance from the hotels and the Marina.
267,A  bit of spare time,"Considering this has only been active and constructed in the last two years it is really good. Great consideration has been given to the layout and how to educate the viewers into the eco systems and their occupants. You will see some beautiful fish, understanding why they are the colour they appear. Maybe even some hands on experience with assistant Brett, who is a mine of information. Really enjoyed our time there."
268,"Large variety, not just marine",We had one day in cairns and this was what was recommended to do. It was well worth the money and a great time spent looking around this fabulous aquarium
269,Excellent viewing but expensive,"Our Great Barrier Reef Tour was cancelled due to cyclone weather and so we hit the Cairns Aquarium instead. We loved our half day visit. We loved the variety of fish and other marine animals they had there. The staff was very knowledgeable and we enjoyed the two presentations we experienced. Even though we were disappointed with not going out to the reef itself, this was the very next best thing! I would highly recommend this venue if the open ocean is not for you, or don’t feel up to that kind of excursion. Well worth the money!"
270,Educational and entertaining,Arrived at open time at 10am and waited 45 min in the heat with 2 young kids to get in. Perhaps open earlier especially in school holidays...? Staff member couldn't tell us how long the wait would roughly be in the queue
271,This must be one of the best aquarium worldwide,"If you're not into taking smallish boats out of sight of land, this is for you. The aquarium is also a lot cheaper! We visited the aquarium and the reef. The aquarium has a lot of interesting marine and land animals, but the reef is probably the highlight. Highly recommended."
272,Great on a rainy day,"Visited Cairns Aquarium on vacation from Portland, Oregon, U.S.A. We have been to several great aquariums and found this to be among the best! There is a very nice flow to the multi level floor plan. You could be through it in half an hour if you chose, but could linger for a couple of hours or more if you wanted to take in all of the information provided in the displays that meander from Australian upland river environments downstream to open sea."
273,Best Tourist Attraction In Cairns City,"Wow!This is absolutely the very best for all ages to go to.You will be totally mesmerized by what you see as you walk around.There is a lot to learn at all of the displays.The size & colours are fantastic.Make sure you allow a good couple of hours at least or more to do it.Amazing ""Coral"" varieties,species of;"" Fish,Sharks,Eels,Starfish, Seahorses,Snakes,Pythons,small Crocodiles,Venemous creatures,a touch pool & much more.Take the time to come here as it's brilliant.The prices are good also."
274,Good for the little ones,Was really looking forward to a nice stroll around the Aquarium . Sadly it turned into a very short experience due to screaming kids. Once one started the rest screamed louder. Oblivious parents . I didn't pay $44 to listen to screams.Please can you have hours for kids and different hours for those of us that would like to actually enjoy the fish?
275,Great place ,"We went with the hard to please in-laws,  they are still raving about how fantastic it was! We killed a couple of hours here (in the aircon) looking at the awesome displays. Great variety of fish to look at and it's been cleverly put together to show how all the rivers, waterways and ocean are all connected.  Information sessions are good and the ticket lasts all day so you can leave and come back to catch more shows if you want."
276,Beautifully presented,"We had some time to kill before departing and after checking out of our room so we decided to check out the aquarium. They have luggage storage lockers for $5/6 dollars for 10 hours! If you work at it you can fit 5 bags in the bigs ones!We had breakfast at the restaurant (highly recommended) and then wandered through the aquarium. Even as an adult, I'd recommend crawling into the tunnel to watch the turtles and crawling to the center of the sting ray tank for a full 360 view."
277,A pleasant day at a great tropical aquarium.,"We really enjoyed our aquarium visit. Doing it the day before we snorkelled on the reef meant we already knew what lots of the fish were and made the snorkel that much better. Not cheap but would 100% recommend. Also, try plan your visits around all the talks, they are fab."
278,A quality aquarium. Put on your to do list if in Cairns.,"For those whom are less likely to plunge into the waters of the great barrier reef or even wish to learn about all of the amazing aquatic species that we have here in Australia then this is a must see, you won't be disappointed with this world class Aquarium and the extensive knowledge presented by the staff during there exhibit presentations you will walk away with a big smile on your face its a must see.Myself and my family Personally enjoyed it so much that i purchased an annual pass for the whole family."
279,A little disappointing,"We had seen this on a TV program before we came to Cairns.   Pricing wasn't cheap but we decided that we could spend a couple of hours there and have lunch at their restaurant (see separate review).  Well, the couple of hours ended up being over 6 hours.   The talks are fantastic, the displays informative and fantastically set out.   Make sure you take in all the talks as you will go away with so much new information.   Loved it and highly recommend a visit."
280,didnt make it out to the Reef.....so came here instead,Pretty interesting but hugely overpriced. $126 for a family of 4 is way too much. Should be half that price
281,Best aquarium ever!!,Very interesting because of the explanation you get (if you're there at the right time) and the feeding of the big fish. You get a good idea of what the Great Barrier Reef is like and all the animals that live in and around it. Your ticket is valid for the whole day.
282,fish sharks and stingrays,Visited as we were looking for something to do on a rainy day with a toddler. Nice outing and he was entertained. Of note I couldn’t find a parents room to change or feed my younger baby which was surprising given I assume lots of families would visit.
283,Oversees perspective.,"Went to this attraction on a recommendation from a friend who lives locally, and I wasn’t disappointed. The facilities were of good quality and the layout was good. I did like the flow how it starts from the rainforest down to the reef showing the abundance of animals on offer, which also included land based animals as well as fish. This place is worth the visit if you get a chance."
284,Enjoyed but ,We had been looking forward to visiting Cairns Aquarium for 2 years since being in Cairns in 2017 and seeing it being built. Unfortunately we were a little bit unimpressed with the place. Staff were friendly and informative and there were some good tanks of fish but it just felt like something was missing. Cost was around $40 an adult which is quite expensive for what you get. We wouldn’t visit again.
285,Day visit,"We purchased the VIP Platinum Pass and honestly it was the best decision we could have made. We've been to many aquariums before, around the world, but having a 2hour guide with you the whole time explaining all the animals, their function and purpose in the sea, having VIP access to behind the scenes and learning how the aquarium actually works to keep and also we got to feed some of the animals, which was awesome. It was just a truly wonderful experience and if we had just walked around the aquarium by ourselves, we would have missed everything and probably have been a little bored. Amy our guide was outstanding, and her knowledge of everything was amazing! We cannot recommend the VIP Tour enough. Plus who would want to miss out on hand feeding the cute cownose stingrays?"
286,"My first time there, was fantastic",A great idea on a wet wet wet Far North Queensland day ..excellent day out with hubby ..lots to see as good as any other aquarium
287,Had a very good time!,"We are lucky enough to have a family yearly membership to the aquarium, so I attend with our toddler almost every week. We always find something new to spend time watching, the facilities are all kept immaculately clean and all the displays are maintained to a very high standard. The staff are always friendly, knowledgeable and enhance the experience. The first membership was a gift but we re-subscribe every year because amazingly our toddler always gets excited to go and has a wonderful time, her first words were mostly aquarium related :) Highly recommended !"
288,An excellent experience,"With mid-afternoon flights out of Cairns we thought the aquarium may be a good way to end our holiday - it really exceeded expectations. It's a great size, not overwhelming or tiring with kids and easy to get around, a great array of sea life and beyond...but what really made the visit was the passionate, extremely knowledgeable, and rather funny presenters. In particular Maya (I think) and Oscar were young, vibrant, and full of amazing facts that fascinated both 6 year olds and 46 year olds! The interactive talks of around 15-20 minutes are just right to keep your visit buzzing for 2 or so hours, then an hour or so of 'freestyling' makes for a great visit. The big lockers ($6) were also perfect for storing our luggage, there's the cafe onsite (we didn't use) and plenty of food places a short stroll away, then it was off to the airport for a perfect end to our trip. Thanks cairns aquarium!"
289,Aquarium,"Presenter should be in the centre of his audience - difficult to understand for anyone trying to listen in the ""opposite"" corner, in particular when many children are screaming of excitement - which is understandable and inevitable."
290,Good little visit,"I attended the Cairns aquarium with my almost 2 1/2 year old daughter. She frequents the Melbourne aquarium and loves all aquariums. We only stayed for about 2 hours, so we didn't get to see a lot of the educational activities, which go every half hour. however, the aquarium is fairly large and has a good selection of various frogs, snakes, sharks, rays, fish, starfish etc. with a special bent on the Great Barrier Reef."
291,Great attraction,"The visit to the aquarium was spur of the moment.  I'm glad we decided to go.  The various displays and tanks and explanations are quite amazing.  We viewed species we'd never heard of before.  It isn't a ""must do,"" but it is a ""should do."""
292,Nice morning spent,"I enjoyed my visit on the first day as a tourist in Cairns. I took a tact from my Motel at 17 Abbott St, as advised. Didn’t cost much, and a good move considering heat and distance. I loved the fish and corals on display, including sharks and sting rays. I especially enjoyed seeing the shark eggs. Staff were wonderful, explaining were I could find Nemo! Very well laid out and a great little cafe for coffee and scone with jam , strawberry and cream. There was a display of fish and coral as a wall of the cafe. A great experience."
293,Wet season trip,"Killing time driving from Cairns to Port Douglas, we decided on a whim to check out the aquarium. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and variety of exhibits. Especially enjoyable was the walkthrough and tunneled tank where sharks and rays could be watched gliding overhead. Regular scheduled programs. Nice interactive tide pool and engaging staff. Reasonably priced."
294,Cairns Aquarium Visit,"My husband and I are Cairns locals and recently visited the Aquarium on a Sunday morning.  We were greeted by a friendly Customer Service Agent who immediately directed us to a talk which was due to start and she did not want us to miss it.  Very considerate.  We sat in an area where the tanks were all around you and you could view the fish from every angle.  During the talk, which was very informative and knowleageable, divers entered the tanks to feed the fish.  There is plenty of seating if you just wish to sit and observe.  We then went back to reception and started the visit from the main entrance.  The information boards and displays were excellent, colourful, large and easy to read.  It tells you a story as you move through each one.  They covered not only the reef but the wet tropics as well.  It is easy to walk around (a lift is also available if required) and wheelchairs and prams would have no problem moving through the exhibits.  There is a restaurant onsite if you get hungry and there is also a lovely gift shop which is worth a look with very affordable momentos of your visit.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Aquarium and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting our beautiful Cairns."
295,The Barrier Reef and rainforest beautifully presented.,"We walked a long way to get to the Acquarium, only to find it closed.  There does not seem to be any time on the brochure but I believe the last time they let anyone in these days is around 2.45??"
296,A great way to see Great Barrier Reef marine life that you may not get to see out on the reef.,"I took my six year old and my eight month old. We got there about 1pm on Wednesday afternoon, and found it relatively empty. The exhibits were easy to view, because there was only ever one or two people lingering around them. The tanks are nice and big, and very clean, so it was great for my daughter to spot each animal in each tank.The staff were all nice and friendly. We didn’t attend any of the talks, however my daughter got to touch a starfish, which she enjoyed. A great way to occupy an hour or so."
297,Holiday activity,"We called into Cairns Aquarium just after 9am on Wednesday 13/11/19 & both being locals we were able to receive a discount on the admission fee & for both paying AUD $67.20.The last time we had visited Cairns Aquarium was back in 2006 while holidaying in Cairns from Sydney.Overall the Aquarium is very well laid out with lots of interesting information & many beautiful reef displays of colourful fish, snakes reptiles , etc. The lighting inside was perfect for those happy pics. We would highly recommend a visit for all ages.Purchased a few souvenirs from the gift shop & a little pricey inside."
298,Great set up ,We had some time to fill in before heading for our flight home and decided to stop in and have a look at the Cairns Aquarium. Wow.. this place is awesome. We sat and watched the fish and sea life in the underwater viewing sections and loved every minute of it. A must do for families with great education talks . Go... just go at any age ❤️
299,Great fun! In and out admission! Luggage storage! ,"I had an afternoon flight scheduled, so decided to spend the morning checking out the aquarium. I was initially taken aback by the entrance fee, but figured a lot goes into running a place of this size. I timed my visit well to join in on an interesting talk and then a shark & sting ray feeding session. Both activities, which were conducted in an entertaining and informative manner, were thoroughly enjoyable. I then spent another couple of hours wandering around the many and varied displays. Apparently your ticket is valid all day, so you can come and go, if desired."
