0,Staff altitude is very bad!! ,this place staff be so spoiled from all vistor before covid crisis then even now is on same altitude... didt know nothing about service industry just very lucky to be on this island. Refuse to accept people from far entrance even if have handicap becouse want you rent a wilchair in entrance never be here anymore one of wast place in Japan!
1,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park Has Something for All Ages,i highly recommend for couple bike this place. included zoo and small amusement park. great place enjoying dating for u.
2,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,"You can visited this place everywhere. Beautiful views and many entertainment.Mini zoo, flowers,ocean seashore,that you can see allow have great vacantion. I get absolutely pleasure to be there. I was here in April. This the best time to travel. Weather warm,but not hot. Everything blossomed,so we can enjoy the beauty of nature. Don't forget catch some food (you exactly will  want eat in nature) and you can eat in someone cafe and try delicious Asian food. I recommend this place. Welcome to the park!"
3,Best Park all-around park in Japan 10/10,"This place is one stop park for family, they have a zoo, gigantic trampoline, flower park, playground for kids. The entrance fee very cheap around 400yen, you can rent a bike for your convenience, because this park is very large. Come to this place especially at spring, around April, at that time this park has the best view"
4,Beautiful place with marvelous view for relax),"This was an unexpected surprise for us. We saw it briefly on trip advisor, but wehn we saw how far away it was from Hakata (where we were staying) we almost didn't bother. Glad we did! The trains were a bit hard to figure out, as they were on the JR line, rather than standard, and the switch for trains in Kashii was pretty confusing -regional lines seem to presume you know what you're doing- basically you head from Kashii to Umi No Nakamichi and it's the second last stop. Don't fret if you go to far, it's a 10 minutes wait and the train reverses. However we had to switch trains the stop before Umi no Nakamichi - not sure why, but the captain wandered through, spotted us and directed us to opposite side :)We clearly went in off peak, but had a blast. Hire a bike definitely but don't leave any food in your baskets when you get to each stop - it will be taken by the birds - there's warning signs everywhere.We hired a 2 person bike and you just follow the blue lines - there's maps everywhere with where to go and what to stop at. We spent about 3 hours there, and missed most of the sights as we spent the majority of the time enjoying the ride and playing at the forest park - which is essentially a massive petting zoo. Keep in mind we are 2x 30 something year olds, but it was great. The area was massive, the creatures were clean and there were things there I'd never heard of. There are hand washing stations anywhere, so don't pat anything unless you have thoroughly washed. And there are also some cool vending machines that give you these odd biscuit things that snap onhalf and are full of food pellets. The animals know that sound of the machine and head straight to you. From inside their respective areas, the animals are mainly free to roam, so many will mooch right on up to you for a pat.It looked like there were also water rides and rose gardens etc etc, which we didn't get around to, and didn't really try because we went coming into December and figured it would be a touch cold to bother.If you have kids, make a day of it. If you don't, enjoy the ride and stop wherever you want. We had a blast here! (there's also a marine park across the road from this where most people who got off at the trainstop went.)"
5,Nice park at the right timing,Just a friendly reminder that the Ferris wheel is now gone 😓Also would suggest to go during before end of November so there would still be flowers.
6,Lots of space for kids to play.,"It is very nice place to relax with family after business week. There are comfortable sand beach, nice restaurants, convenient places for relaxation."
7,Beautiful flowers with camera/phone stand ,"We came with family of 2 young children, we rented 2 bicycles which can carry one kid each. The park is so big. You must rent a bike. The staff at the bike shop near the train station entrance was so helpful and nice. We arrived around 2pm and the park closed at 5pm. So it was a bit short of time. We rented the bike for 3 hours at 400 yen. Our kid can sit in the front. It was really nice weather. Sunny with breeze. The kids got to play at the playground and slides. And they just didn't want to leave.  As the park was so big. We didn't even get to visit other part of the park. Eventually we decided to come again the next day. And this time we also rented the bike at went to the mini zoo first, than had our mini picnic lunch at a massive field than went to the blue flower bed. It was truly beautiful. And besides that, there was another children's playground. Our kids get to play their for a while. If u go. I suggest to to early. As their is so much to do there. And such a relaxing family days. At low low price.  Highly recommended family with kids."
8,Must visit!,Fukouka tower should be seen in night for colorful illuminations according to the day of the week. on our visit it was MILKYWAY with white & blue combination .its a treat to the eyes. the city view is excellent and  tie  on wishlist is an attraction
9,Huge and great park to visit ,"its near the waters so do bring along a windbreaker. we visited the park on 2 apr and there isnt many cherry blossoms, the park was about to close at 5.30pm and we were somewhat the last guests around... its a nice stroll... did not get to ride a bike as we intended to... the park has parking spaces and is accessible via public bus. it feels serene to walk around the park..."
10,"Vast spaces, great for relaxation","It is a really huge park, a rental bike is available. Recommended to in Spring where a lovely seasonal flower is everywhere."
11,Beautiful park,"Great for children. Amusement area is dated but, still lots of fun. Sunshine pool was not open early July."
12,Wide open spaces and beautiful flowers,"I visited Umi no nakamichi seaside park during Dec 2012. It was my first destination once my family and I reached Fukuoka. Unfortunately, it was raining on the day i visited and the wind was extremely strong. Thus, we were not able to enjoy the park properly. The park was very huge, however, there was not much things to see and do. Many of the attractions such as the go-cart were not open. Even the 'food court' does not seem to be open even thought it is already noon when I visited the place. We finally found the ferris wheel after a long walk, however, the price seemed a little towards the high side and therefore we felt it wasn't worth the price. We did bought some food to feed the fish which we thought was quite fun!It would be better to enjoy the park when the weather is not freezing cold!"
13,Biking tour around the park,We visited on 31 March and was disappointed as the cherries trees has not blossomed yet.  The whole place was deserted.
14,Blue Nemophila,"This park blew my expectations out the window!  410yen per adult gives you access to the huge park with beautiful gardens, ponds, woody paths and wetland area. Inside are a number of attractions for additional cost including a zoo. I rented a bike in the late afternoon and cycled the perimeter only stopping at a few garden/ nature areas due to time. The roses and hydrangeas were in bloom and were stunning. The park offers guide maps in many languages including English and the staff spoke English enough for me to understand where bike rental was and how to return it. Everyone I encountered was very kind. I spent 2 hours in the park but could easily spend 5 or 6 hours- not including time for the additional cost entertainment."
15,Splendid for All Ages!,"If you are in Fukuoka with young children and its a beautiful sunny day - head here. If you have seen the other reviews, you will no doubt already know that this is a large park. But large is an understatement - it is absolutely sprawling.First - the logistics. You can get here by stopping at either Uminonakamichi Station, or Saitozaki Station, which is approximately 45 - 50 minutes from Hakata Station.. Stop at Uminonakamichi if you want to hit the Whale Cloud / Go Karting / Slides area first. If you prefer to get closer to the Dolphin Playground and Animal area, stop at Saitozaki instead.It is possible to rent bicycles or walk the park. We chose to walk as we had a pleasant summer day. While there is an internal shuttle bus, its not very frequent (we were there on a weekday and it was on an hourly basis). You can check the website to see a picture of the map and you should do so if you have young kids in tow as this place is so large, that you cannot actually get from one attraction to another without quite a bit of walking / cycling. You will be able to see the list of attractions from the website but what is not obvious from the website is the incredible quality and high standards of maintenance this park has at every attraction. The Whale Cloud which is like a huge bouncy was an incredible amount of fun, the Go Kart (which is payable) is well worth the money and you can choose between a Bumpy Route and a Smooth Route - and you get on these motorised cars and drive them on a short, but fun route. The playground with long, fun slides were fantastic. The Waterside Playpark offers a more challenging play area for slightly older children with rope like challenges, the Sky Dolphin play area had more slides and rope play areas. While the animal area is not large, it was very well maintained, and the animals well looked after. You get to feed the goats , sheep, ducks and swans (food can be purchased at 100 yen) and pet the Guinea Pigs. You can touch the rabbits and turtles as well. There were beautiful flamingoes, monkeys, capybara, peacocks, kangaroos, turtles, cranes, rabbits and many more animals. On top of all the kid friendly exhibits and play areas, the grounds are expansive, beautiful, and even though we spent 5 hours in the park, we barely managed to cover a quarter of the park. The one thing that you need to note when coming here, is that there is a lack of food. I am not sure if this is the case on weekends as there certainly were some food areas designated and there were food pictures on the website but they were not open while we were there. Drinks are available in the form of vending machines all over the park but food was not. There was a snack store at the animal area but only selling donuts and ice cream. This was the kids best day in Fukuoka and their most memorable. It was an awesome day for the adults too. One of the best playground and park we have ever seen."
16,Use JR Pass for a free fun day,"We choose flower season when we visit here. We chose nemophila and rose this time. We always drive from city centre. Our typical plan is that we drop in at Aeon Mall Kashiihama to buy bento or sandwich and some soft drink on the way to the park. Both nemophila hill and rose garden is near the west entrance gate, which is closer to Shikanoshima. There's also car park there. Nemophila hill is on the left side from the entrance gate and the rose garden can be reached by walking straight.Baby stroller and wheelchair can be freely rented at the entrance."
17,"Park with flowers, playgrounds, scenary","This is a very huge park with all kinds of activities.  If you are interesting in flowers, don't get off at the park JR station, get off at the last station of the line.Flowers are beautiful.  Gardeners upkeeping the park very well.Another thumbs up of this park is: it provides camera/phone stand at every scenery point.  So its easy to take solo/group pics without asking for help"
18,Most enjoyable park,this is beautiful park to spend the day if the weather permits. We went in May so the flowers were in bloom and the gardens were spectacular. It is huge and takes a few hours to get around but if you have kids you can relax in the playgrounds with them. There is a kiosk where you can buy limited food and drinks near the playground but if you grab a map before entering it shows where the various sections of the park are. Great place to take a break and unwind but is crowded on weekends so weekdays are better. Not sure of transport to get there as we went by private car.
19,Best park ever,The park itself is very beautiful. Lots of fun play grounds through out which is great if you have kids with you . I went with my teenager so we ended up just renting bikes at 700 yen for a day and cycling around the island . It was relaxing and got to stop off at all the recommended spots . They had a go cart. That was a plus.
20,Flowers Day!!,"The park is quite big & has quite a few attractions. It has a beach, a mini zoo & playgrounds. There wasn't much flowers to see as they are not in season. Fortunately for us, we at least get to see the roses & few other flowers bloomed at the rose garden."
21,Beautiful ,"The park is huge and has lots to do (though some of the attractions were under going rennovation when we went, such as the aquarium). There's lots of play areas for kids, hire bikes to cycle around the whole park, a miniature zoo (which is actually decent and the animals have space to roam and move about and seem happy) would recommend and if you get the chance to bring a picnic."
22,Picture perfect,"Great for activities, can walk, hike or cycle.   Beautiful view of blue flowers and cherry blossoms. Enjoy the coastline scenary.  Great place to educate children on nature, environment, and animals.  Sunshine pool is available during summer.  Children's playground is enough to keep children busy."
23,Lots of happy people taking pictures. ,Went when the park was venue to a rugby tournament - very tranquil and well laid out.  Lots of attractions - didn't get around to them all but fun was had by all!  The ladies in our group were very impressed with the flower meadow!!!
24,Nice park with many attractions,"I liked this park pretty much but perhaps it is one of the good parks you can find from many cities. If it is your first trip to Fukuoka, perhaps its priority will not be very high. However still good to spend some lazy Sunday afternoon."
25,Great family day out destination,"Nice garden and petting zoo at the park.We hired a bicycle (must do) to get around; the petting zoo was nice with lots of different animalsThe garden was great... there was a hill full of wild flowers.  However, the rose garden was not good due to the season were were here... Overall, nice place to spend a relaxing day... Big hint... Bring your own food for a picnic lunch... did not see any place that sells food.  Best to pick up a bento box when at the Hakata train station."
26,Disappointing...there was no vast cosmos field. Nov 2018...,"For families w children, skip the Marine Park (boring zzzz...) and go straight to this outdoor park. Maybe a bit far out from the city but for the kids, this is Fukuoka attraction no 1 having spent 10 days in fukuoka. Entrance fee is insignificant but the following attractions are mind boggling; 1. 3 of the longest downhill slides i hv ever seen, more than 50m downhill. 2. The waterpark is fantastic with aka ninja warrior obstacles for the kids built over a meandering stream. Sense of challenge, motor abilities and achievement 3. The go kart was a wild ride gteed to bring glee to many kids faces... 4. The giant bouncing castle at the entrance... This underrated and seldom publicised giant park exceeded our expectatiobs. We came here as a side trip after the Marine Park but spent many hours here till it closed at 5pm.   And my kids insisted on comg here again...on its own."
27,Must see for families!,"We saw the sunset here.There is a promenade and a special building on the pier but, it was closed for a private function.We found a street stall and had octopus balls and warm sake."
28,The most beautiful park I have ever been!,"It is a great place for children to go around.  It is a must to rent a bike cos the place is big.  They even have bicycles with training wheels so that the young ones could join in the fund.  There is a small zoo there where you could buy feeds for the ducks, swans, sheeps,goats, etc.    It was quite on weekdays but I do believe it would be crowded during weekends."
29,A joyful place for a family with kids,Great place to bring kids & for young people to enjoy cycling around. Huge park with playgrounds & small zoo. We went to see the blue nemophila flowers which bloom this season. Spectacular!TakeJR train to Kashi & transfer to smaller train to park.
30,Good for families! Must see,"1) Make sure to arrive at least 2 hours before closing time as It's a large open area with lots of walking and flower viewing. (Don't worry, there are many places to sit and rest to enjoy the scenery)2) I would recommend to bring bento or sandwich/snacks to have a picnic here. It's lovely.3) Kids would definitely enjoy this place (Lots of playground and activity for the kiddies)4) Flowers changes according to the season, so make sure to do some research before going if you're expecting to see certain flowers.5) If you're going solo, don't worry! They have designated photo stands for you to mount your phone/camera, set a timer and get your photo taken! 6) They have bike rentals if you want to cover more grounds faster than walking (Multiple options, single rider, tandem bike, family bike). This is a paid service."
31,Great park ..one of the best in Japan,"I visted on the 30th March 2019, and the cherry blossoms were starting to bloom. The street outside the station at Uminonakamichi Seaside Park was lined in the sakura!There's so much to see and do, you'll need a whole day. Take a picnic, a lot of the locals come prepared with tents and picnic blankets, setting up under the canopy of blossoms.Playgrounds, amusements, floral displays and structures will keep you satisfied, fountains and even a waterfall and flower clock. To top it off, there's a very popular zoo with monkeys, and adorable prarie dogs. There's also a petting zoo, but a long queue too! Entrance is 450 yen pp, and worth every bit"
32,Phenomenally fun and fantastic value for money,"We are a family of 4 with 2 young kids (5 & 7).  We arrived at around 11am.  First rented each of us a bicycle to get around this huge park.  They are all sorts of bicycles for all ages (some with supporting wheels, or baby seat).  You'll surely find one suitable.  Bicycles are basically must-have in this park as it is too big for walking from one place to another.  We visite the Forest House which allows to do free wooden crafts.  They provided you with all the tools you need.  And it is air-conditioned, very important in hot summer.  Afterwards, we spend 2 hours at the Sunshine pool which is only open during summer.  The kids had a blast and would not want to leave.  We didn't managed to visit other parts of the park.  Too bad it is closes early.The Sunshine pool has all necessary facilities like lockers, changing room, shower and many eateries.  Be sure to bring a small water proof bag to hold money."
33,Lovely park for all the family,"Using our JR Rail passes we decided ro make a day trip from Osaka to Fukuoka with our 3 children aged 6, 8 and 10.  On the train we came across this park while searching for things to do.  What a brilliant find!  The train from Shin-Hakata was convenient and had some lovely seaside views. Once at the park we put our bags in a locker and hired bikes to get around. They were super cheap to hire and very comfortable.  We visited the amusement park, which our children loved! So many things to do there and a food hall too.  We then biked to the zoo, which had some interesting animals.  The children had pony ride and loved cuddling the guinea pigs.  We then took in the views of the ocean and golden sand beaches and made it back just in time to return our bikes.  While we waited for our train arrived the children were able to walk a goat.   They lady looking after it was very friendly and very kind to our children.  We had a blast!!  We would love to have been there in summer when the water park was open, but there was still plenty to see and do even in Autumn."
34,A Wonderful Place on a Nice Spring Day,"After a picnic in Ohori park .. Thought this park would almost be like the same ... Same SAKURA!!Yet i was absolutely Wrong!! This place was not just only Sakura, they got lot of varieties here!!Must come n Enjoy!!!"
35,Great Park,"It is easy to catch a train to this park with only 1 change. I was at the start of April when all cherry trees were still in bloom. In addition, many displays of spring flowers were around. I didn't hire a bike, but just had a walk to see all flowers and also visited the small Zoo. The day was sunny, the views are very colourful, but for sure, it is probably a better place for families with kids.I also think that it is great to visit during this time of the year, but will be just grass at some other times. I spent about 4 hrs there and pretty much covered all I wanted to see. While monkeys and flamingos were nice to see in the Zoo, the area for grey kangaroos is too small and they definitely do not have much room to enjoy their life there and were just lying.This was sad, as we used to see these animals roaming free in Australia."
36,"Lovely place, Must visit in Spring","When we arrived, we didn't realized that it is such a big park, we do not have enough time spending there, so we decided to skip the Zoo. Just walk around and play with the kids in the park would be great. Hubby and my son went to visit the Japanese car museum, although a bit small, but they said it worth a visit.  The long donuts bought in the park is yummy even we had breakfast before coming. The gardening there is nice, all the plants, lake are beautiful.  The kids playground is superb (that was amazing and we had a great time there). We must pay a visit again when we go to Fukuoka next time."
37,A Huge Park,"Beautiful, well looked after, park. The animal section is great and the animals have a lot more freedom than in a zoo. Great for couples and families."
38,great for cycling,Iconic local area.  Fresh air and sea views.  Accessible by bus.  You can make perhaps a combined trip with visiting the city museum which is a stroll away.
39,Wonderful time in Fukuoka ,Gems in Fukuoka. Huge playground and beautiful lawn and flowers. Must spend a whole day to appreciate that.
40,One stop park for family,"We visited here for the splash park...  it was more like a shallow pool, good size.  The actual pool does not open until mid July.  My kid rode a go kart, twice, and absolutely loved it.  It was gasoline driven, authentic, go kart with a long course.  The maze was fun, too.  We walked around quite a bit, but we only visited 25% of the park, if that.  If you want to explore the whole thing, you will need a bicycles, which you can rent.  We will have to go back several times to fully explore this place!"
41,One day is not enough,Biking tour around the park is great experience. The animals in the zoo is a must see place. Suggest to bike at the outer bicycle routes first followed by inner route.
42,Family friendly fun! An unexpected delight!,Big park with many areas to explore with viewing points and camping grounds and even a mini zoo with roaming animals. There are also areas with flowers blooming depends on seasons. Unfortunately i did not go on the right timing as most flowers are not available for viewing. Able to rent a bike to move around the place easier.
43,A must visit park in Fukuoka!!,"A large park with beach, mini zoo, mini golf, etc. you can cycle, you can walk, you can take the bus. Really fun place for kids and adults alike. Got to plan for it if you are in Fukuoka."
44,Had a blast and should have spent 2 days at least,"This is a nice place to bring the kids, only a ferry ride away. there is a sea world where we saw penguins, sharks and other underwater creatures. it was educational and my son loved it."
45,Nice Big Park with various Activities,"My young son and husband didn't expect this park would be so fun and enjoyable. It is a very large park and we did everything from feeding fish, jumping on big white trampoline type hills, roller type slides, difficult obstacle courses, swimming at the water park (except we found the water to be too cold), and the highlight of the visit was cycling as a family in safe bicycle routes. Everything was ready and accessible, my husband and I first rode on a two seater and then switched to a single riders with little station stops a long the way. We found this to be very fun and easy to ride since it is difficult for us to do this in Hong Kong."
46,Loved going around in bicycles!,"We spent a full day there and we loved it. This is a HUGE park with all attractions for the kids inluded a open zoo, swimming pools, big slides, etc ... You can rent a bike with kids seats. There is no mosquitos as the dragonflies eat them ! The food is not good but you don't go for eating. We were lucky because nobody was here and we had the whole park for us (almost !)."
47,Check out before you go,"We visited the park a few days ago and I have to recommend this to any parents who wish their kids to have a good trip in Kyushu, they can do so much here, the park is huge and variety is great. The cost is very cheap. The only downside is if you aren't driving then I think it will take a while to get there. We drove so it was fine, about 30 mins drive from Hakata.We were only there for 4 hours and we rented bicycles and cycled around the park, saved us from walking all the time cos the park is huge. My daughter enjoyed the ride in the front carrier seat a lot.Sakura was great too, we were lucky with the timing.Since we had other plans we couldn't stay there for too long which means the next time we visit Fukuoka we will go back to it."
48,Not much colour,"A good place to go when the weather is good! And if you are travelling with children. The big open fields are full of flowers, different flowers for each season. The park is also surrounded by the sea. Packed a picnic basket and easily spend half a day here. For those with kids, must go!!  The park is built for families with children.  There are many playgrounds,  water park (that opens in summer),  and animal petting area. Most importantly,  they are so much open fields for them to run wild! Big park by walkable by foot. Bicycles are also available for rental. Easily accessible by train (40 min)  from Fukuoka."
49,"A huge park, a lot to do","Nice place! Sakura wasnt in full bloom yet but the flowers are just picture perfect. Huge park to walk around, you can pay ¥500 for an all day pass for the bus, or opt for the ¥200 if you know the exact place you want to go."
50,Enjoy nature!,"This is a wonderful place for you to travel as there is zoo, marine park and lots of trees and flowers. The park is so big that it would be fun to travel on bicycles, as walking may take hours to go around the park once, which one could rent immediate after entry to the park.We visited the place in April and there is still sign of cherry blossom and also many beautiful flowers.We spent over three hours there taking pictures and enjoying the ride. Without the help of the bicycles it may take more hours to finish our trip and more exhausted. It was a very good morning exercise and splendid tour. It would be fun for family wiht kids."
51,"Absolutely stunning, must visit",The park is very large and beautiful! This park would be perfect for a biking trip and a ride around the park. The flowers are absolutely gorgeous. The staff is very friendly and helpful!
52,We choose flower season,"We visited the Seaside Park with our tour group to see the Nemophila in bloom.  We were surprised at the size of the park - it is HUGE, and there were crowds of people visiting.  We walked past flower beds of tulips in bloom, families playing and groups of preschool children celebrating as we made our way over to the field of blue in the distance.  This is a great place to visit if you have children in particular as is it one place where the kids can run free - something we didn’t see a lot of while in Japan.There is also a playground on the far side of the Nemophila but we didn’t visit that area."
53,Huge Park with a complete attraction for kids,"This place is really huge. You can easily spend a day at this place! Lots of flowers and small animals! I would say this is heaven on earth for little kids! I went to both the seaside park and the park in Nokonoshima, I would say the one in Nokonoshima pales in comparison! We made our way to this seaside park from fukuoka tower and there was this high speed boat service. 20 mins ride and we are at this park!"
54,Best to spend the day here,"This park is suitable for all ages and adds another dimension to your Japan holiday. You can hire bikes very cheaply and cycle many kilometres on flat well made paths. During your journey you pass a zoo, amusement park, several kids playgrounds and many wonderful gardens which are included in the entry price and you explore as you go. Bikes are quite separate from cars so it is also very safe ."
55,Big park with colourful flowers and lush flower! ,1. Nice water thame park.2. you wouldn't miss the bike tour.
56,a park with serenity,"We went to this park after we visited the aquarium (marine world) just nearby. The park is so huge, you might need to spend one whole day to cover everything.For us, we spent half day (afternoon). We rent two bikes which can carry our 8 and 4 years children  (yen 400 for 3 hours). The surrounding greenery and bike lane make great experience. Kids love it!Visited the flower museum, playground and mini zoo.The zoo has an outdoor concept, with lots of interesting animal to see such as monkeys, peafowl, kangaroo, laama, etc.They display seasonal flower - it was rose when we came.Highly recommend this place!"
57,A huge park worths to spend a day,You will never run out of things to do here! It’s a park for all ages! We parked by the West parking across and rented a bike inside the park. We went yesterday and all the flowers are so beautiful! The Sakura trees are in full bloom and are so lovely to look at and watch the blossoms fall off. The baby blue eyes’ doesn’t seem to be in full bloom but still a lovely sight like a sea of little blue flowers. The tulips are beautiful and there are many others that I don’t know the names. The roses I guess don’t bloom until a few months as there is nothing in the Rose garden. There’s a zoo close to it that we weren’t able to visit. There’s also a huge playground where kids can enjoy for sure. My kids are 3 and 6 and had so much fun. By the playground is also the food court. We are definitely coming back!
58,Disappointed,"Uminonakamichi Seaside Park is a journey out of Fukuoka City proper so it's best done in a day.  It's mainly for families with young kids - I can imagine teenagers and adults getting fairly bored at the offerings there.Located within the park is The Marine World Aquarium (with dolphin show), Wonder World Amusement Park and the Luigans Resort Hotel (all separately priced).  I thought the aquarium was overpriced while Wonder World offered a lot more for active kids (playgrounds, bouncy mountain, obstacle course over a stream, a zoo, lots of space to run and play).  As it is a large area, it's a good idea to rent bicycles to ride both within Wonder World as well as around Uminomakamichi Park itself.Uminonakamichi is accessible either by train or ferry but for those on a budget, the private ferry service (not the municipal ferry) is more than twice the cost of the train ride so it's something to consider."
59,Huge park with lots to do.,"The Cherry Blossom were fully blooming when I visit, a lovely place to take some photographs. The tulips on the lakeside of Disc Golf area are also lovely! Sadly the Ferris Wheel has been removed - but there are lots of other attractions. A great place for family, lots of playing ground for kids. You can also rent bike. Just keep in mind that the place is close around 5.30 PM and the last train is scheduled around that hour. The admission price is sooo worth it."
60,Best Park in Fukuoka,"If you are travelling with small children or even teens..Uminonakamichi Seaside Park is worth the visit if you ars in Fukuoka, Japan.By bus it is around an hour and you will get the chance to see around the city, university,outskirts and residential dwellings..the bus stop is at Tenjin in front of the Post Office and has a timetable. Don't worry everything is clockwork on time that is why we love love love Japan. You can even take a train to the park.The part is massive consist of playground, playground and more playground for the whole family to enjoy. A rose garden & flower hills for mummy to enjoy. The park entrance fees is 450 yen for adults and free for children below 12 years old. The park closes at 5.30pm so please planned your journey. A mini zoo with kangaroos and birds closes at 5pm and a mini golf too.Huge lakes to relax to. The food court is non halal so it is advisable to bring your own food and snacks.We really enjoy our visit at the park we went to the park 2 days in a row..hope if you are ever in Fukuoka and wants an activity with your children..do drop by the park."
61,An unexpected delight,This is a amazing park. We took JR to Kashi from Hakata Station.From Kashi there is special train from platform 4 to park.After getting down you can hit the park or aquarium. We decided to go to park first as marine world closes art 9:30.You can buy ticket with and without swimming pool. If you change your mind after getting inside park you just need to pay the difference.Balance bike and bike with peddles can be rented just near the main gate. Park is too big. There are buses but frequency is less.  There are food options but quality is so so.Swimming pool has different sections as per height. There are body guards in kid section. Its challenging to cover everything in one day as park is too big. So better decide what to visit as per age group.
62,milky way,"While Fukuoka isn't the largest city in Japan, this park stands out as a bit of a gem amongst the bustling city around it. The gardens were lovely and and the Ferris wheel really adds to the picture. It's a good place when you need a short break from city life (and the fare is really cheap)."
63,Bring your wallet,"My son lives in Fukuoka and we have visited Uminonakamichi Park several times, normally for the grandchildren to play.  Each time I have visited, there is something new to look at; this April we saw the dolphin cloud ( a huge bouncy undulating area for the children to run, bounce and roll on) and while the children found the many play areas, my partner & I strolled around the flower garden.  Wow!  I had never been to this area before and was really impressed by the huge displays.  We returned to the Park once more prior to leaving Japan and this time went to the animal area where again we were impressed at the space, cleanliness and care.  The children were able to have hands-on experiences with the smaller creatures and thoroughly enjoyed their time.  We did take picnics on each occasion, knowing there were plenty of seats and quiet areas to enjoy our food.  Altogether two more great experiences during our time in Japan."
64,Beautiful area with a zoo,"Little far out there but worth the time and effort to get out there to spend a sunny afternoon.  Yes, like other reviewers have said, this place is huge.  Don't worry, you can rent bicycles to get yourself around on the pathway at a reasonable price.  There is an animal zoo, flower garden, jungle gym for children,  water pool play area and probably lots other stuff that we didn't have the chance to see or do. If you bring food, just remember to stow it away or keep it with you when you park your bike.  There are birds that will devour it before you return."
65,Best spot for families travelling with kids in Fukuoka,"I loved every minute of this park!When you arrive, there are many different gates or places to choose from to start your day. Each gate has a place to rent bicycles and they even have helmets for the little ones. We started at the West Gate which was opposite of where we were heading so we biked the entirety of the park. We rented bikes for my eight year old and myself (with a seat attached for my four year old). The trails for the biking were safe along with parking. Each bike came with a lock so that you can keep track of your rental and not worry about someone taking yours (which I don't believe would happen). here is a small zoo inside. I would skip it if you are looking to feed the animals. All of them lie down the majority of the time and don't really interact with the crowd. Definitely visit the park areas. One has two bouncy clouds! Each one has different age groups but no adults are allowed to bounce. Loads of slides, sand/water to build sand castles and things to do to keep your little busy and have them burn energy. They did have go carts and a maze but those you had to pay extra to do. We may do them when we go back! We arrived around 12 p.m. and didn't depart until maybe 4 or 4:30 p.m. Definitely will return! Will also try to the aquarium!"
66,roses,"I read the reviews for this online and had pretty high expectations. But this park blew it out of the water for me! It took us a while to find the West Gate, which is the main entrance to this massive park. I reckon it could rival the size of London's Hyde Park!My daughter wanted to hit the Sky Dolphin first, and this is by far the best playground I've been to. It's ultra clean and superbly fun. The slide isn't just a sheet of metal but a layer of tiny rollers to whizz you down the three storey structure. While the kids were at the playground for an hour and half, my father went off to the chip and putt area, which cost him only a meager ¥400 for the 18 hole ""course"".We then headed to the zoo area which seriously impressed us. There were a whole bunch of animals but they weren't kept in miserable cages. Rather they roamed freely in enclosures where children could interact with the animals. The impressive thing about the Japanese is the incredible sense of hygiene and cleanliness. Every enclosure had hand sanitizers for kids to use after they have handled the animals, and sinks to thoroughly wash down hands with infant safe soap. We spent the whole day there yesterday and even skipped lunch and we still couldn't get enough. We are headed back tomorrow again cos we just can't get enough. Just a tip - the F&B in this park isn't very comprehensive so pack a picnic lunch if you intend to head there for the day."
67,Wow what a find!,"Fun cycling around the park. There is a Ferris wheel, mini zoo, fun obstacle park, nice cycling tracks with 'tunnels'. Rather deserted on weekdays, we seem to have the park to ourselves : )"
68,Nice Park for family ,"There are large open spaces with grass, a long cycling course, beautiful gardens with a lot of seasonal flowers, a zoo allows you to touch some small animals, an amusement park with a giant Ferris wheel, many pieces of equipment that children play on, and so on.  In short, I strongly suggest anyone to visit this wonderful park!"
69,Back to the teenage,"Umino Nakamichi Seaside Park is a wonderful destination for weekend outing. You can spend a whole day here. The entrance is a modest price of $4. If you don't like to walk much, there is also a bus service inside park, or you can rent a bicycle. To go to Umino Nakamichi, you can take a JR train from Hakata and transfer to Kashii line at Kashii station."
70,Lovely Park and Zoo,"This is a nice place to visit for families with younger kids. There's lots of open space and plenty to do for an entire day. But it is really far away and somewhat a pain to get to from Fukuoka's city center. This is not an interesting tourist spot or anything, and is really busy on sunny weekends."
71,A nice open pro with a variety of activities,"It is a long way on the train, but an interesting trip.There was not much flowering when we were there."
72,Recreation and resort area on the Uminonakamichi peninsula.,"You can spend ALL day here! There are bikes for rent so you can get around the area quickly with several attractions peppered throughout. Tandom bikes, bikes for kids, or bikes with seats for your little ride-alongs. Whether you arrive by ferry, bus, train, or car, there are maps located all around the park. You can make your way to a park with roller slides and arcade games, an aquarium, a zoo, and even a waterpark. Each of these stops has it's own entrance fee, so expect to spend a bundle...but it's so much fun! Nursing stations were available and western toilets were easily found. Bring your sunscreen and a change of clothes so you're ready for the splash pad or water park."
73,The Ferris wheel has been removed,"I came to this park because I wanted to visit the Retro Car Museum located in the area. Apparently, TripAdvisor does not have a record of this museum in its list of places so I shall write a brief review here instead. For those who have a great interest in classic cars, I would strongly recommend that you visit the Japan Retro Car Museum in Uminokamichi Seaside Park. You could find all sorts of old Japanese classics dating back to the 60s or the 70s. The museum is not very big but it is really worth visiting especially when the staff there are really friendly."
74,This is paradise for young children,"We were in Fukuoka for the day during our cruise.  Japanese friends met us and took us to this park.  We rented bicycles so we could see most of this enormous park.  The bicycles were in excellent condition. There were bicycle parking racks at intervals. We 4 adults had a great time going down the super slide in the playground area, We also enjoyed the bird area, the small but quality zoo, the rose garden which still had some roses in it even in late October, as well as other types of flowers, and of course, the immense fields of cosmos in bloom.   The park is also convenient to access Shikanoshima,   a land-tied island connected at a sandbar/causeway. There is scenery galore out there, and a fine seafood restaurant also."
75,Unexpected surprise,"The park is half an hour by train from Hakata JR station. The park is huge and is divided into several functional sections such as a zoo, a water world park and a rose garden etc. The park is suitable for couples or a group of people. It is easy to spend a day here as an escape from normal tourist activities."
76,A whole day's worth of fun in this wonderful park,"Wow. This park looked amazing on google maps, but when we went there it was even more spectacular. We went here for 3 hours in September. Took a ferry from Hakata port (a very nice 15 min ride, not too many waves and you get to see great distance view of hakata city) to Saitozaki ferry terminal. This park is enormous, best way to see everything without taking forever is to hire a bike. It's around 500Yen for 3-4 hours. There are designated bike paths in the park, however you can take the bike in certain areas where there is lot of foot traffic. There are lot of bike stops where you can park and have a walk through different attractions. There is a bit of everything at this seaside park, there is a zoo, bird area, picnic areas, lot of gardens and is very kid friendly too - such as kids pools, picnic benches etc. Great place to go to escape the city for a few hours, especially on a lovely sunny day, whether your a couple or a family, there's something to do for everyone. When we went, there wasn't too many flowers blooming. This place must be exploding with people during cherry blossom season....If you go to Fukuoka, be sure to come check this place out, you won't regret it xD"
77,Wonderful and great park for kids and family,"What a great park! Not expensive at all and my kids (4 and 11) loved it! We took the municipal ferry from Hakata Port to the island (Saitozaki stop, 15 minutes), which was also cheap and great fun for the kids.At the park, they have play structures suitable for many ages and an eating area where you can grab some quick dishes (pork-broth ramen and similar things). Bring lots of cash in the form of coins and 1000 yen notes – you buy food and tickets from machines. Pools open in July, but there is a wading pool. The animal area is great, the kids loved walking inside the kangaroo and capybara enclosures, getting close-up experiences. The flowers are plentiful and lovely. I only wish we would could have had more time, as we were rushing through the park a bit during the 4 hours we were there. Plan for a whole day outing and bring snacks, plenty of water, swimwear and towels during the warm months! Sunhats and UV-clothing or suncreen for kids is also recommended during summertime as there is not always very much shade when you walk between the areas. The best time we had in Fukuoka was here, don't miss it!"
78,What a wonderful place,I used my unlimited bus/train/ JR one day pass to access Uminonakamichi PArk. I was there 915am. The park opened at 930am. I was travelling solo and was interested in the flower gardens. The park was so vast and I can't ride a bike so I started walking to the left side. I reached the rose garden but roses were not in bloom. There was a small group of pink cosmos. The rows of yellow ginko trees were amazing. Fountains and lots of areas for bike riders. I passed by a small zoo. Good educational fun for children. Lots of nice views but they were just too far apart if one is not on bike.There was a food area near the mini golf. I took an udon lunch there. There were lots of areas for famiy fun and activities. I left the PArk at 1pm.
79,Great day for a walk,"A great place for innocent fun!The free zoo was great! You can buy food to feed some of the animals, though be mindful of the signs as they will tell you which animals shouldn't be fed (e.g. the monkeys and the donkeys should not be fed). We hired a bicycle for the day, which was great fun. I think it was about 400 Yen? You can switch bicycles throughout the day so we switched to a tandem bike for some random fun towards the end of the day."
80,Beautiful seaside park. Amazing views ,"Uminonakamichi Seaside Park is a Nice and huge park. You can go there by land or by ferry. I suggest you rent a bike to go around the park so you will be able to see the most of it. Also bring food to eat in case you get hungry and away from restaurant. With more than 16,000 steps on my “Fit band”, we still did not see the big part of it and we were tired already. It’s a beautiful place, lots of flowers too. A must to see this park."
81,highly recommend for couple bike,"A huge park, so cycling is the best way to go around. Easy to rent bicycles and enjoy the ride.  Stop and park at designated bicycle areas.  Park grounds are vast, with a beautiful garden of roses, and many areas and has something for everyone .  Great place for a family outing.  Journey out here is long but worth it if you have the time.  We spent the morning here, and then walked to the Marine World for lunch."
82,Excellent park and happy memories ,"For a tourist there isn't much to see here, but this is a good place for families to picnic or spend the afternoon."
83,Expansive Nature-Themed Park,"Very friendly guides at the entrance. Nice biking path good for families. You can rent any type of bike you want upon entering. Take note that biking and walking paths are different. Make sure to get a map when you enter. Also, for those with kids I recommend you go straight to Wonder World where there is a huge sand and playground area as well as a toddler pool. Make sure to bring swimsuits for them. There is also an aircon area where the kids can play. Sadly only four stars because there is NO PLACE TO EAT HERE! We went there hungry and left hungry."
84,Excellent for family,"This is one of my favorite park in Fukuoka. You can reach this park using a train from Kashii station. Stopped at uminonakamichi station. You can also reach this place by bus. This park provides a complete attraction for kids and family. There is a mini zoo inside the park, children grand park as a huge playground for kids, flower garden, seaside area, etc. You can rent a bike inside the park and explore the whole area or you can also use the shuttle bus inside the park. Near the children playground, there is a foodcourt which provides japanese foods and western foods."
85,Only if you are already familiar with Fukuoka,expecting for more roses during May.  I must commend the gardeners for maintaining the place.  Hope that they provide more seating areas.
86,Perfect for family with kids,"I would have given it ""Good"", but TripAdvisor goes from ""Average"" straight to ""Very Good"".We took the ferry to come here.  When you arrive, you can rent bicycles in the same building where you can buy your return ticket for the ferry but here you can rent only until 3 pm.  Wait until you reach the park (if you were going there) and you can rent bikes until 6 pm.The park is quite big, so bicycles are quite useful to move around.In the park, you can find a kind of mini-zoo with different species of monkeys, some kangaroos, some wallabies, and many other kinds of anymals.There is a playground for kids.  There is a kind of small amusemment park, or it may be more accurate to say that there are a few rides.You can buy food and drinks at a few places; they have vending machines for drinks and there are toilets, which are free.  Food and drinks are a bit expensive, so you might want to bring something to drink before leaving town.Initially, we wanted to visit around the park  after visiting there, but we got surprised by the rain, so we took a ferry back earlier than intended."
87,A bit out of the way for most people,"We had a fun time riding around the park and viewing the Sakura and plum blossoms in addition to the other flower displays including tulips and other seasonals. I would recommend two things for those planning a visit: bring a packed lunch, and try to get there earlier to make sure there are bikes available (we nearly missed out when we got there at 11am) as it would be pretty slow getting around the park without a bike if you want to tour around the whole park."
88,Nice open area.,"This place has so much to offer. Great if you have family and kids to bring. You can take the ferry or train ride to this place. Entrance fee is unbelievably cheap and well worth it. Food, rides, animals to feed. The whole island is an attraction. Swimming pool was packed and looked really fun."
89,I have wonderful family trip there.,The best park that I had ever been. You can rent a bike and check out the zoo or just merely play in their free playground parks. I would definitely take my future children here.
90,Fun for everyone,It was such a great experience renting bicycles and going through the gardens of this park with my family. :) Best to bring a water bottle and snacks if you're going to be there for half a day!
91,A get away~,Some seasons are better than others so find out what's in bloom before you go. This past May roses were about the only good sight. Doing cherry blossom season this place is spectacular. You can get there by ferry or train (have to change trains once). There is also an antique car museum. The bicycle rental is a good option.
92,Love the space,We enjoyed the subway/train ride out there and the ferry ride back. The wallabies and kangaroos were friendly and fun to look at and almost play with. The beach looked niice.
93,Sea World,"We came here after a red-eye flight and was feeling a bit grouchy from the lack of sleep. We only cycled around the park which took us about 2.5 hours including lots of stops for photo taking. The place was beautiful and we could see Hawks and Ospreys flying low across the sea. It was indeed a rejuvenating place, away from the hustle and bustle of city life."
94,No 1 place for kids in Fukuoka,"This place is lovely to relax at. You can enjoy the seaside air, and also check out the restaurants around it."
95,Anyone can have a good time anytime.,"There are a great variety of playgrounds and exercise facilities to play with.  You can bike and hike for a whole day.  Besides, you can see some animals in a small zoo within the park."
96,Fabulous flowers!,"We took the Uminaka Ferry line to this expansive nature-themed park in Shikanoshima Island.  Inside, suggest getting around it via bicycle rentals or moving trains (our choice).  There are flower gardens, an amusement park, playgrounds, zoo, and vast grassy areas.  We first went to the Animal Forest, where we saw capybaras, flamingos, small horses, kangaroos, llamas, various types of monkeys, peacocks (2 of them in different cages spread their colorful tails for us), prairie dogs, and other animals.  The children petted guinea pigs and sheep.  We next took the train to Wonder World, where we all rode go-karts on 2 separate tracks:  flat and rough/unpaved.  It was fun!  The children then went on the giant Octopus slides, followed by the Whale Cloud “Fluff-Poline” (many connected trampolines), jumping up and down until park closing.  We walked past a cherry-blossom-lined street towards the exit and took the JR line to Hakata Station, changing trains at Kashii Station.  A truly wonderful and relaxing day at a nature park!"
97,Normal park,"Okay, this isn't the most sophisticated park in the world, but it is a lot of fun. We took the train out to Uminonakamichi, and then bought a ticket on the little toy train that goes round the park. All of us - especially our 4 year old - had a great time, playing on the slides, jumping around on the inflatable mountains, looking at the boats out on the sea, and just generally walking around a spacious, green, quiet park. The zoo is a bit sad, but apart from that it was a really good day out."
98,Beautiful park very tranquil!,"We spent the day out here and it was one of our best days of the trip. We hired bikes at the entrance near the station and rode right around the park. There was plenty of choice of bikes ranging from kids 18in right up to full adult sizes and most (if not all) had baskets to place a bag in on the front, there were even some tandem bikes. The grounds are lovely, beautiful floral areas, a lovely coastal road to ride along and some incredible playgrounds around the grounds. There is a small free zoo and also some paid activities like go karts and mini golf. There are drink vending machines scattered around the park so if you get thirsty out on your ride you don't have to head back to a restaurant/cafe to refresh. It's worth taking the time to head out here with your family, it's a wonderful day out."
99,Nice place to relax,"My son and I spent a full day here last week, and it was the highlight of our trip to Fukuoka. We rented bikes for the day, and had a fantastic time riding through the park. The zoo area was well kept, and much nicer than many zoos we have visited throughout Asia. Wonder World could use a bit of an update, but we thoroughly enjoyed the go carts. You may want to bring a lunch, as there aren’t many locations to get food within the park. The obstacles over the small ponds were awesome!Overall, it was a fun day spent in nature, rather than in the midst of the city. We loved it, and my son is still talking about our day there."
100,Good for a family day out,"With easy access to the seaside, a cage-free zoo, flower garden, cycle rentals for children and adults with good variety provided, a nostalgic classic car exhibit for adults and any number of other activities provided on severalHundred acres of land this park is perfect for an all day outing. Should the weather turn unpleasant, there’s always the near by marine land aquarium, just five minutes walking from the west exit. Highly recommended for any and all, but especially for those with young children!"
101,Great day out,"A short ferry or train ride out of the city, Uminonakamichi Seaside Park offers miles of beaches, swimming pools, children's play area, a Ferris wheel and other rides, cycling courses and gardens as well as restaurants and shops. The site occupies about 200 hectares and is still only partly developed. What it feels like There is something for everyone - as always, avoid the peak season. The US Army was stationed here until 1972, prior to that was a Japanese military base."
102,Great place for a family outing,"To go to this Park, take a JR train bound for Moji-Kou from Hakata Station and transfer to Kashii line bound for Saitozaki at Kashii Station, and take off at Uminonakamichi Station.  Rent a bicycle because the park is really huge and there are so many different bicycles to rent. The park is great for kids to see the animals, birds, and flowers of all kinds.  It's a great place to visit with your family."
