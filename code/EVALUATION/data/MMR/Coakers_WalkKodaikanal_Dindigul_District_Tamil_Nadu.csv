A good place to have a relaxed and peaceful walk with family..It is also one of the main attraction in Kodaikanal. The entry is Rs 10 and camera fee is Rs 20 and Amazing place to see kodaikanal from the top.
1,Breathtakingly Beautiful Sight !,It is very pleasant to spend time walking on Coaker's walk . Most of the famous view points can also been seen while walking .
2,Excellent mountain views while walking,Coakers walk is very scenic as you walk along the beautiful hills on one side. It is one of the best attraction of kodaikanal. Although there should be some activity apart from telescope views.
3,Enjoy a Scenic View of the Valley,"Coaker's Walk, this located about 1 to 2 kms from Kodai Lake. It is a picture perfect  location. The best time to visit this walk is either early in the morning if you want see a mesmerizing view of the Kodai valley and clouds passing by or in the evening, recommended visit is…"
4,A walk to cherish,"Coakers walk is good place for walking. through out the walk one can have scenic views of the valley and mountains, the walk is half km. you can sit down and relax."
5,A nice walk!!!,The Coakers walk gives a good view of valley. It is a short walk of about ten minutes. It is good to be there in the morning
6,Coakers Walk,The coaker's walk offers a stunning view of the Misty hills. But the walkway is poorly maintained and was full of garbage. In the receipt I couldn't see the charged INR 25 per head. They charge for children and INR 10 for mobile as well. You need to pay separately for the telescope as well. Not worth the money.
7,A walk on the slope of the mountain,"Croakers walk is a man-made walkway built on the mountains, offering some super scenic views of the valley. We enjoyed our short walk despite the weather being misty on that day.  A must visit an attraction, an added bonus if it's not misty. It costs about Rs 20 to enter the…"
8,A walk through clouds,Coakers walk is an exclusively designed track for walking with a lovely view of the valleys. The walking track is tiled with seatings at intervals. However the entire track is poorly maintained particularly the chains are rusted and dilapidated. Vendors have put up stalls inside. There is no proper resting place and toilet facilities for tourists. It is sad to see such a lovely tourist place neglected. The best part is the plan to develop Kurinji flower park here. Hopefully things will improve in future.
9,Good View from Coakers Walk,Good View from Coakers Walk. Its a nice km long walking track. Can be done once during your stay in Kodai. Has an entry charge of Rs 30/person.

12,Interesting and beautiful but pick your month,"A popular tourist spot, you walk the stretch overlooking the beautiful hills & valleys. The stretch is donned with small stalls & vendors selling eatables & artifacts."
13,Cant foget the visit,Coakers walk is literally built as a pathway on the edge of a cliff. It allows a 15 minute walk from entry till exit with some refreshment vendors on the sidelines. It gives open view of the entire valley and mesmerizing glance of the mountains.Very good place to visit
14,a cool place to walk around to view valley,"scenic views of the valley and of the village, good point to have a nice picture and a memory of the kodai tour"
15,Coakers Walk Review,"Located not very far from Bryant Park, Kodai lake and Market. This pavement gives you a good view of the valley. Must visit while in Kodai. Your tour operator will include it in Valley view package."
16,Nice view,Its a great experience to walk on the edges of the mountain with breathtaking views of the valley. A Must when you're in Kodai.
17,Nice place,Excellent place to view amazing city landscapes. It is approx 1/2 km walk and it is memorable to take pictures with the background.
18,A walk with the clouds ,It was nice experience walking on Coakers walk.We can see the valley properly and enjoy natural beauty.
19,Serene,Very nice along the edge of valley. Very scenic views. Must visit. Very quite and peaceful. Lots of shopping options and eateries throughout the walk. Kids also enjoy the views and mist in the valley
20,Wonderful views.,Coakers walk is a 15 minute walk which can give you a chance to experience the Kodaikanal weather and the beautiful views. One can see different varieties of birds at this walkway. The squirrels and monkeys will be running around. One need to pay 20/- for entry and an another 30 for mobile camera. Parking is a real problem at this place.
21,Good views,"Very enjoyable place to visit and we can go a nice valley view walk almost 1 km. Better to see the place when there is no mist , hence you can have clear view of the valley."
22,Great experience ,"Coakers Walk is a beautiful  one-kilometre-long man-made walking area built on the mountains in Kodaikanal from where we can have a good view of Kodai valley.It is a good location for morning and evening walks. For visitors safety, the pathway is fenced by the edge of the mountain. It's a favourite location for sightseeing and photography .There is a telescope house to explore the surrounding there. Also few souvenier shops on way. If you wish to breathe clean fresh air and experience to the lush greenery, enjoy a leisure walk on this walkway."
23,a good walk,Good views from coakers walk. Little bit foggy. One view point is there which was closed due to foggy weather.
24,Fantastic view,the view is really breathtaking it is a walk for about 1/2 km there are  some titbits to eat and some stall to shop from though the washrooms are not good when u reach the other end there are some shops which claim handmade chocolates but i suggest not to buy from there rather i saw a shop where it was machine made that is a legit place to buy chocolate
25,A surreal walk with a great view,Beautiful view from the top as you keep walking  you can see the scenic view of kodai and in February we found fog everywhere and it made the place more romantic
26,Nice views from a clean walkway,"Coaker's walk is very close to Bryant's Park.There is an entrance fee; money is collected and no tickets are issued.You can walk along a fenced road and enjoy the beauty of the valley below.If you are lucky, clouds might pass through you.There is a view point house with telescope. Kids might find it enjoyable.The sad part is: it looks like it is used as a store room by the person-in-charge and vendors nearby.In order to make it easier for tourists to see kurinji flowers when it blooms, kurinji plants have been planted close to the path on the other side of the safety fence.We were lucky to see a number of plants with flowers that bloom once in 12 years.It is sad to note that not many tourists showed interest in seeing the once-in-12-years phenomenon. To keep the pathway clean, there are a number of dust bins hung on to the fence. For every 20 feet, there is dust bin. Even with so many bins, I noted with deep sorrow and anguish that even educated persons are not using these bins and are throwing trash and fruit peels on the path way and into the plants in the slopes.As is the case with every tourist attraction/temple, there is this vendor menace as an eye sore along the pathway. They spoil the beauty and serenity."
27,Great view of Kodaikanal from Coakers walk,Its a very good view point and the entrance fees is reasonable. Enjoy the walk and the pics :) it is at walkable distance from the kodai lake and the main center
28,Icon of Kodaikanal,"It is a pathway overlooking the valley with great views, when visited on a misty evening offers surreal experience while walking. It has two entrances and view points.

30,Stay with Oxygen in Coakers,One of the major tourist attractions in Kodai. Provides some fabulous views. Visited earlier here. It was good at that time but It's not at all in good shape now. The Maintenance seems to be poor.
31,Nice quaint walk along the hill side.,"Coakers Walk is neat and very well maintained path way. With a very nominal entry fee (20/-) you get to see a breath taking view of mountain chains with clouds rolling over them. This place is very well within the city, walk-able from Bus Stand. If you are a nature lover, you will surely enjoy walking on this lane. Vehicles are not allowed here. there are some vendors selling petty things and eatables. Do visit the Telescope center at the end of this pathway (fee 6/- per person)."
32,Good viewpoint,"It starts near Van Allen hospital and is approximately 1 Km long. If mist is not there, one can have a good of view valley. There is a telescope house here for watching certain scenic spots. Coakers walk as well as Telescope has charges."

39,Nice view from the top,"This is a nice walking path on the Kodai hillside with scenic views of the valley and surrounding hills.One can access the place by walking a short distanceFrom Bryant Park gate. The entry fee is not too high and there are shops selling tea, bhutta, boiled peanuts and ice creams along the path.The walk is amazing as one could walk through the mist and clouds. When weather is good, one can also enjoy scenic views of the valley and surrounding hills"
40,Awesome place to visit,"It is a paved winding pathway on the side of the hill, which gives a bird's eye view of the village below. The pathway is quiet wide and outer edge is protected by railings. There are benches provided along the walk for short rest. Along the walk, there are vendors, selling…"
41,Breath taking view,"Coakers Walk is around a half a km walk on the cliff.Fenceing is there for protection.Small vendors sell local fruits,cloths etc.There is a entry ticket.Do not go there in the afternoon.Best time would be evening.It is just a place to see valley any have pleasure of chilly winds."

45,Walk ,"Beautiful place for morning walk, close proximity to the lake and small time shops, get down from the walk and one can try the street side breakfast"
46,Nice view,We had visited Coakers walk just after a rain shower. The view was breathtaking !! However there are vendors along the entire stretch. Also the entrance and camera fee that they are charging is not worth. The place can use some maintenance. The washrooms were very dirty.
47,1.5km walk on top of valley,"Provides great views and makes for a pleasant walk. There are small shops who deal with handmade goods and articles. There is also a provision for an observatory, but, this was hardly of any use due to the poor visibility in December."
48,Walking around the valley,It's an another man made creation of around 1 km walking plaza with the mountains around the path. Bicycle riding made me more exiting. It was a unique experience.
49,Nice view from here,"This place is unique, where you can find cloud invading whole of the Coakers Walk. Loved the flora and fauna throughout the  path when you progress from one end to another. You can see the deep slope in one side of the path. The stroll starts close to Van Allen Hospital and intersects the main road above St. Peter's Church. The entry fee is just Rs. 10 for all. Camera fee is Rs. 30 only."
50,Beautiful walk in Sky in Clouds,This 1 km walk through sky is meant to be experienced. On a clear day beautiful view of Kodai valleys on cloudy day with some rain heaven when clouds almost pass you by. One of the best attractions in main city. See the gentle rolling hills.

54,The route of an Englishman to walk,Is a nice place to relax and drink a cup of coffee while you see the amazing views of the mountain. very beautiful to see
55,Scenic walk,Its a less than a km walk with good walking track and boundary. You can get a full ground view from top of the hill from this point. Its a nice point to take some amazing photo. Most of the time it is surrounded by cloud which adds beauty to this place.

58,"An evening In Coakers walk, a walk to remember",I think this is a first for me to see such walking track combined with beautiful views on one side.  Cool weather with warm sun light on clear days makes it an amazing experience
59,Breath taking view from Croaker walk,"Offers a eagle eye view of the place , well maintained. Though too commercial but the view is awesome. When it is raining it appears as you are walking in the clouds.NOTE to travellers - Climate keeps changing hence be ready for some unexpected showers, don't let the rain spoil all the fun. The telescope room is closed when it rains as it gets cloudy and nothing is visible."

65,Nice walk with views,Also very relaxing thing to do in addition to walking around the lake which is not far from each other... It is a bit of an uphill stretch but hey we are surrounded by mountains so it is expected... It's a nice long walk way with stalls and top down view of the town and valley…
66,Just a short walkway around a hillside,"Coakers walk is one of the attractions in Kodaikanal town. It is walkable distance from the bus stand. It is situated behind the lake and is of high altitude. There is a nominal entrance fee. They also charge for cameras. We had a very pleasant walk on this stretch. Very nice view to see around. One should not miss this place. Especially, the nature lovers. Very bad part is toilets are not properly maintained for the visitors."

85,Beautiful and over-commericialised,"A narrow pedestrian path of one kilometer mountain road which runs along the edge of steep slopes on the southern side of Kodai road which is 1/2km away from Kodai. The walk winding around mt. Nebo starts near van Allen hospital and joins the main road above St. Peter's Church provides a wide-angle spectacular view of the plains.

The clouds would take over the whole way and once it gets cleared the whole city looks divine! As it starts getting darker , the lights looks prettier. However, this place does get closed after 7pm.

113,Kodaikanal - A place where you should walk :),"Close to the Kodai Bus Stand and few meters away from Kodai Lake and Bryant Park, is this heavenly walkway named after Lt. Coaker, way back in 1872. It is fantastic 1km (3300 feet) well paved and fenced pedestrian pathway (entry paid, 10 rupees per person and 20 rupees for camera) that provides awesome panoramic views of the Kodai town. Edged on a deep slope it is a photographer must visit destination which provides mesmerizing play of clouds floating around and giving a unique landscape below. On a clear day, you can view as far as the town of Periyakulam and even the city of Madurai. As the mist gets deposited, a pre noon visit is recommended however, on a clear day any time is fantastic for its very soothing and spectacular view."

133,Foggy walk,"Well..the place is slightly commercialized with some shops inside the premises, otherwise the walk through here offers a great view of the valley. Its not a very big walk."

138,Coakers Walk,A well maintained stretch of walkway created on the mountain side giving a beautiful view of the valley. I was there with my family and friends and it was nice peaceful place. It was peak winter so the view wasn't that great but the mist and fog was awesome. There are vendors in…
139,"Noisy, overpriced",This is a very nice place to walk in the early morning hours. You can see almost every place around it from this view. There is a telescope machine as well but beware they charge a lot and you may end up spending a lot of money for just a 5 second view of a place you may have…
140,Scenic place,"This is a 1km walk alone a cliff overlooking Kodaikanal park and leading to the lake, after a further distance. The views are fabulous if the day is clear but the valley easily fills with mist in Jan-Feb. So go later in the day when the mist has lifted - say after 3pm. There are many small stalls selling souvenirs and artistic stuff, nibbles and some hot food.  The safety fence had collapsed in some places so be careful with your kids - bikes not allowed anyway. At the end of the Walk, it is possible to access downhill to Kodai Lake with all its amenities and the ornamental park. I imagine it gets very crowded May-Oct, but we walked with no difficulty.  A nice way to spend an hour or so."
141,A serene and beautiful stretch of hillside walk (only if you escape the crowded days/time),This is really a good walk offering good view of the hills. We went here early morning and everything was misty. Along the walk there are people selling small items. Due to mist we couldn't see things which were far clearly. On one end of the walk you have telescope. We looked through the telescope but couldn't see much due to mist. So on a misty day it's better to avoid the telescope.

163,Consultant ,A must-visit viewpoint. Walking in the premises itself gives you pleasure. Aged persons may feel some difficulty to walk.
164,Hill Side Walk,This place is good for a lovely walk either with your partner or friends. We have a nice view of valleys and mountains. Unfortunately for me when we went it was very misty and beacuase of fog we were not able to get much of a view. There are few shops selling trinkets and eatables on the way. Its worth going once.

198,"Nice ""","This is a great experience to just walk through the clouds and good views when it’s sunny & clear.One can enter the Coakers walk after paying a nominal entry fee. There are various shops selling tea, ice cream, snacks and other wares along the pathway.

199,Nice viewpoints,Neelakurinji can be spotted midway through the Coakers walk however they have begun to fall in kodaikanal ending mid sept Walk is scenic with panoramic views of the hills n mountains
200,cool walk,"Nice place with greenery, hills, flowers, pleasant climate in month of August.... in this place a lady sells handmade jewellery ... earrings, and set of earrings + neck piece at cheap price.... beautifully designed .."
201,Good for a nice walk,This place is ideal to see the entire Valley and range of mountains. It's too foggy in the morning in spite of summer Sunday. It's a one km stretch you can walk and take lot of photos. The view from the place is just outstanding. 
202,Nice viewpoint,This is one of the best place to be when you are in kodaikanal. The view from here is just awesome. One of the best views in kodaikanal. It is just a walkway of around 2kms with great views. Couples can enjoy a romantic walk here. Kids can play around and have fun.
203,Kurunji season - over,This place is close to the Kodai lake and spreads over may be a half KM that over looks the valley and hillsThe views are usually blocked by dense mist (happened to us) but mist experience is also funLot of small shops for buying gifts and snacks will make it fun for all.
204,Awesome,"Was a nice experience with full of fog. Lots of shops as usual. They charge hefty entrance fees. It has two entrances, its prefereable to choose the back side entrance as it will less traffic there."
205,A View to Watch,"This one was a marvel. We discovered this because it was next to our hotel. The tickets are price 20 RS with camera 50 RS. You get to walk around 1 km with some magnificent view of valley and Kodaikanal city. There are binocular available and many small eat out. The place was clean, maintained and safely pebbled. I love to come here for morning run but we were told it opens after 7:30 am. We found a very nice gentleman selling wooden masterpiece with paintings done on wood. Jus look him put a great piece of work."
206,Mesmerizing view from the top of the hill,"As you walk this stretch, you can view the valley and town on one side. On the other side, there are shops where you can buy fresh carrots, hot groundnuts and also buy souvenirs."
207,Great Walking pathway,"The place is stretched for 1 km. It is located near to Kodaikanal Lake and next to Bryant park. The place is one of the famous tourist spots in kodaikanal and I surely not going to disappoint you. The view from this place is breath taking. When we went there, it was completely taken over by fog and the valley below was not viewable from the top. But still, we loved the place.There are few shops inside from where you can do shopping. While you walk and enjoy the view, don’t forget to eat sweet corn, you get best corns in kodaikanal. There is an entrance fee of Rs. 10 per head and for camera additional 50 Rs. There is also a viewing room from through telescope you can see distant places and for that you need to pay 20 rupees. It is indeed a must watch place if you visit kodaikanal, the princess of hills."
208,Nice relaxing walk but scenic view depends on mist and fog cover,"The entry ticket is priced at 35 INR. It is a narrow but paved pedestrian path that was constructed by Lt Croaker in the year 1872. The path offers scintillating views of the valleys and in rarest occasions can also give a glimpse of the rainbow cutting across the clouds. The path is one kilometre long and has market lined at the side. Items sold are very expensive and thus, it is advisable to either bargain or buy from the market near the lake."
209,Awsome view,A place for walking fans. View is good if clouds are about to cover you. Greenery view otherwise. Normal view point.
210,Walking 🚶‍♀️ ,Great place to go for a walk. Will be great to have such a place inside my Apartment ;-).Scenic beauty to see on 1 side while walking with cool breeze wiping off your sweat and making u fresh again.Theres small scale vendors selling some local ornaments.
211,Most beautiful view of kodaikanal,"Enjoyed here, Good view on the mountains, located center in kodaikanal, eatables allowed and snacks/fruits available inside. Kids will enjoy the walk and play in the pathways."
212,The walk can be done by any age,"it's better than average, less than ""very good"".  but, a nice 10, 15 minute walk from La Saleth back towards town, with magnificient views (if the mist stays away) of the valley, far mountains."
213,Best place for an evening walk,entry tickets to coakers walk is 10rs for adults and camera 50 rupees. Entry and exit is from both sides. There are telescopes installed to watch the valley deep down. The view of the valley from coakers walk is just beautiful. Couples can go for a good romantic walk.
214,pleasant walk with good views,Nothing like walking here on a sunny day. Amazing valley views. Picturesque place to take snaps as a backdrop.
215,Mountain view,Good views of mountains and valleys.Need to purchase entery ticket for camera as well.Not ideal for elderly people because walking there is strain.
216,good,Beautiful place to walk alone or with our sweetheart. The beauty of nature is like an artist's canvas.
217,Walking in the clouds and great views,It is really just view point and not hiking walk. Short path with view. I recommend to check the visibilty before heading to the coacker walk becuase in days of low visibility there's not much to see up there.
218,A nice walk and view,One must visit this place if one is in Kodaikanal. On a sunny day one can have full view of Kodaikanal hill station. On a cloudy day also one can have great experience. Small road side shops great attraction for visiting tourists. 
219,Feels like Walking in the Sky,It's in the midle of the Kodaikanal. It is actually a walking place. You will find rhr valleys one side and beautiful flowers on the other side. There is a view point towers with telescopes too. Before going inside this coakers walk don't forget to buy carrots. So you will not miss the fresh tasty watery carrots in the walk. Overall its a great place for walking and enjoy the nature.
220,Excellent scenic views from Coakers walk,"The entrance charge is RS. 35 per person , since it was opposite to our resort we went for an early morning walk. This opens at 6 30 am and closes at 6 pmBeautiful view of mountains and city..must visit"
221,Coakers walk,Coaker's walk is a must visit if you are in kodai. You will enjoy clicking off if you love sceneries with breath taking views on one side as you  walk. We were lucky as there was no mist and we could see the valleys clearly. Entry fee Rs.35 per person is a bit high.One entrance opens at 9am while the other  opens at 7:30 am.Loved the lemon tea we bought from street vendor in the walk.
222,Short walk in clear day,The view of mountains while walking is mesmerizing. It feels like walking through the clouds.The place is beautiful and worth visit.
223,Quest of neelakurinji ,Nice walk preferably before 7am. Calm. Pristine. Good for couples to just take a romantic stroll with views of the valley. Walkable distance from the lake.
224,one of the iconic  spots of Kodai,"very nice and calming , relax walk with excellent view especially on clear day, we were here at sunset time and it was like no crowd and very nice to have a walk in cool weather."
225,Explored Neelakurinji flowers...,Don't miss taking a pleasant walk witnessing the panoramic view of Kodaikanal Town. The breathtaking valley view is something you can't get over it. The Sunset time is more crowded. It closes by 6.45 PM and the entry fee per person is 20 bucks.This place is just a 10 minutes walk from the bus stand as well as from the Kodai lake.
226,We could see the rare Neelakurinji here,"Many decades ago,  when Kodaikanal was  rustic and not crowded, we used to take walks on the coaker's walk daily. Then ther was no admission fees to enter , the walk was narrow , unspoilt, and rustic  full of tall flowering plants and many varieties of birds -it used to be the favourite haunt for early risers, the mist slowly enveloping you , the birds chirping from all directions.--it was paradise. Now , the walk has been widened, paved with stones, ugly steel grill alongthe edges, the trees having been cut away, no more bird songs to hear.  On both ends, gates have been fixed ad a fee collected for entering the walk! .nolonger the paradise it used to be."
227,Great view,"The Coakers walk is a nice respite from the chaotic and dirty city of kodaikanal. The walkway is quite clean, uncrowded and offers excellent views of the valley and hillside. When we visited, we saw the clouds floating in over the valley. It was surreal.   There are some shops…"
228,Good view of the valley from Coaker's Walk,Place is neat and clean which promises to give you valley view from top but to my sheer disappointment the view which we saw was not at all worth. Weather was also not cold. There is one glass house in middle of coakers walk which  is having telescope which gives you opportunity to see 108 year old church from top at Rs 10. Entry free to coakers walk is Rs 30. Lot of local shops makes this place a bit crowded.
229,Excellent View of mountains,"Stunning walk, views are magic in fact will be imprinted in your mind forever. Small payment and worth it. Not a difficult walk at all."
230,Exclusive walk by the side of great view,Coakers walk is 500m from bus stand n Bryant park. Ticket charges 20 per person n cam/video charges extra. Famous for sunrise n sunset view (if mist is not covered-which is usually covered). They have few telescopes where u can pay n enjoy the view if it's clear. 
231,The search for Neel Kurunji,"Municipality has fixed rates for kids as well, while maintenance is average...it's a place to walk not sure why it's paid..."
232,Nice place to have a stroll on misty mornings!!!,"Decent walk... nice view, terrible rush... go late and stay till closure to get some peace and calm... avoid peak tourist time..."
233,Iconic of Kodaikanal,The path along you will walk you will find peaceful and as if you are walking in sync with the clouds 
234,Good view n nice place for a walk,It's just a walk around the hills of Kodaikanal...View of Kodai valley from here is good...Nice for late afternoon...
235,Like a mini Bazaar,"Most overrated because of hawkers selling there wares,would have loved if they were not there,otherwise the views are fantastic,some cleanliness would have for wonders"
236,Serene,This is a must see place when you're in Kodaikanal. Get indulge in the great view and atmosphere in this Hill Station.
237,Great! Walk the Talk,"Spend an entire evening here. Walk, take pictures and you can also shop for unique glass earrings/ pooja articles from here. The valley view is breathtaking."
238,A Must when you're in Kodai,"the online pictures make it look like a quiet nature's abode. It is indeed, except that its not quiet. The whole walk is full of vendors and a huge tourist crowd in summer."
239,One of best places to take morning stroll,Our family with two kids had a good time in this place with good view and mist. Kids enjoyed a lot in Coakers Walk.
240,Beautiful scenic valley view,Super views and walk with clouds. Beware on ticket counter they are not paying back the change correctly.
241,Good,"Any visitor to Kodaikanal should never miss this place. Especially, the nature lovers. The place is simply a walking space and no vehicles allowed. Nominal Entrance fee is collected for the upkeep of the beautiful spot. The tract runs about 1 km and located hardly 700 metres from Bus stand. During the walk, one can have mind refreshing views of the green mountains, blue skylines with white clouds floating along. Plenty of flowering plants and emerald forests down the valley and pleasant chirping sounds of birds can be experienced. The suddenly changing weather is another suprise during the walk.Fortunate to see the flowers of Kurinji plant that blossoms once in 12 years."
242,A real  pollution free walk path.,I always make it a point to be there whenever I visit Kodaikanal ! It is a serene place to walk and the valley view is truly breathtaking. I also end up munching some hot peanuts that are sold there . 
243,Coackers walk,"Clean Place, Nice View, Photography must to do, if u are lucky that u are available with your loved once u will sure enjoy the time here just sit and relax :) best time to see is morning or evening or in case whole day cloudy"
244,Excellent walking track with good views,nice corridor to walk seeing the valley below. kept clean . must see to have a good look from the top. there are vendors on the side walk offering several things.
245,Exclusive walking track with valley view,Excellent view subjected to the weather. You will feel the cloud hitting on you. Highly recommended to visit.
246,Kodai Visit,Want to walk on the clouds and experience it all around you then this is the apt place for it I would say. 
247,Walk in natures lap,The inside hawkers may irritate you. Too much overcrowded. NICE VIEW. They could make the  ticket price a bit les.. but overall a must visit place to go 
248,"A walk : beautiful,clean and refreshing.","It’s an awesome place, just that you need to visit at the right time (during sunrise and sunset). A 15 minutes walk of this place would give you long lasting refreshments"
249,Mast view of valley,This place is inside city so no need to do additional planning to visit here. if weather if clear and if there will no cloud then you may have good view of valley other wise only thing is cloud. this is around 500 m in length. you can cover this place along with your city visit or lake view.
250,A walk to remember ,The place offers magnificent views with the moving clouds and high valley drop in the background. I would suggest you come early as there is less fog and great visibilty of the valley and also you have less people.
251,Breathtaking!,dont go special this is on the way of other  so try to visit for 1 hour  enty was there for 20/- each person and even they collect the 30-/ for mobile phone. simple they are collecting the money
252,Peaceful walk above the deep Valleys!,Usually clouds pass by and embrace the tourists.  This was not the case when we visited on June 1st.  Probably this time it was very hot climate in Kodai.  One should visit in August to have full fun of kodaikanal.
253,nice place to view landscapes,"Offers a good view of the town below and distant hills. Mist added a veil to our view. But nothing remarkable. If it is mist-free, you should try using the pay-to-use telescopes."
254,Super views and walk with clouds,"I would recommend this is must visit place in kodaikanal view. Our driver dropped us one side gate and was waiting in the other side where we complete the walk. We all mesmerised by the scenic view through all our walk. We bought fresh carrots and that was our snack during our walk 😛One should try those baby carrots - they were fresh and juicy, even the kids liked it a lot."
255,Good view at right time,We went there in the morning. It was a nice small walk. We in fact were lucky to have seen the clouds in the valley. There is a telescopic view point and in my view that's a waste.
256,Walk your way over clouds,Your vehicle cannot reach here. You have to walk in this place. But the walk is totally worth it. You can see the beautiful forest views. It's an unusual place. No noisy tourists. Good vibes. Very peaceful and calming.
257,Lovely views,"...with each step you see a new view...enjoy the dance of mist, clouds and Sun...various bird and squirrels...we we're lucky enough to see a flower that blossoms every 12 years (2006, 2018 and next will be 2030)"
258,"A small, nice walk!",It was an awesome experience as it was a nice walk for a kilometre or two. And at the same time we enjoyed the beautiful Kodaikanal valleys while walking. It was an amazing experience. There is a govt paid binoculars are also available to view the valley more clear. So enjoy the beauty with your loved ones.
259,Evening walks in the clouds,Amazing property with easy check in & check out. Food was excellent & spread was very good. Rooms & bathroom was clean. Activity area was great with vadivelu being a extraordinary host entertaining children & adults to the best. We had breakfast & dinner buffet package costing…
260,Amazing views,The place was clean.Cool weather.. nice valley view. too much of fog and mist in the morning. View would be much more better at after 11am as been told by locals.
261,excellent views !!,"This week we visited Coackers walk. The scenaries were good. The maintenance of the location was poor. This time we were able to see Kurinji flowers.When comparing other tourist spots, we need to improve our house keeping and maintain the ecosystem clean to attract more visitors."
262,Beautiful sights to walk along,100% must see place on your visit to Kodaikinal. Just pray that it is not cloudy when you visit otherwise you will only see clouds and mist and not the beautiful view of the hills and the slopes downside. Avoid the weekend to go on a weekday when the rush has settled down. take a binocular with you with out fail and enroute in the walk taste the amazing fruits the vendors sell there.
263,Rejuvenating your body and relaxed walk,"Nothing has changed here! Same concrete footpath, kiosks selling everything from curios, food, wollens etc.. Ignore the right hand side and focus instead on the left, where the hill ranges beyond are perpetually cloudy and misty. Good for a one time visit"
264,Worth a walk ..... but,It’s an ok ok place . Has nothing to do much . Views are not so clear . We spent only 10 min there .
265,weekend trip to kodai,Good place for an evening. Too crowded. Too many hawkers. Beware of fake products. Good bargaining skills required......
266,Amazing,"next to the CHURCH , opposit to Bryant""s park. find a safe place to park your car. walk from end to end . enjoy the view through telescope. beautiful nature all around . , God has given . Prayse Him .  wish you a safe , pleasant, comfortable  stay at Kodai"
267,Walk in Heaven..,"The kurinji blossoms in kodaikanal is over. At kurinji garden in coakers walk,the kurinji plants are becoming dull and one or two flowers only are there."
268,Good outing with family,"We had visited this place on 08 Oct. There is an entrance fee of Rs 10 per head and camera fee of Rs 50.  this is one of the best place to spent some time on during Kodaikanal visit.  In case no raining, clouds you can see the down town places from here.Best time to visit before 11am or after 2pm."
269, specially for nature lovers ,"Honestly, visiting Kodaikanal is a waste of money and efforts for those who travel over 400 kms. Especially for Bangalore crowd, they can go to nearby places like ooty, Nandi hills, yercaud, etcHowever, if you go to Kodai, then Coakers Walk is a must place to visit. Go in the evening hours and you can relax here. Very cramped roads leading to this place."
270,A Walk down the misty trail,"We visited Kodai in mid April. This is the season to visit Kodai is what they say, though i would heavily disagree. So after a lot of digging of websites i finalized on the best places to see in our 2 day trip, but not all were true to their charm.Time needed - 2 Days . Travel - We took overnight bus from chennai. But you can take a train  to kodai city and then take a bus/car/bike to KodaikanalGood to have - A vehicle(Bike/Car). Taxis have their monopoly here. 1 KM travel starts from 150 INRBike for Rent - No. There is a strict ban on it, so you will get it in the Kodai city, but you will need to drive up to the Kodai hill station( 80 KM). Hotel - We stayed in Altuis Nest, its a decent stay, but we overpaid since we booked at last moment. If you get early booking, try for Greens Youth Hostel (Please note - this is only hearsay - Not promoting either)Attractions:1. Coakers Walk - Its a very nice walking arena. Peaceful and neat. The views from here are really good. You can just walk/sit around and relax. Entry Fee- 20 Rs. And honestly Kodai is only  about its mountain landscaping.2. Vattakanal falls/ Bear Shola falls, are supposedly famous waterfalls, but they are dried up and are very dirty to add to. The local tour guide said, its only in rainy when these falls have water, else they are mostly dry.3. Bryant Park - Entry Fee - 30. Its a huge park with a variety of plants, trees, succulents, flowers, but not a very big attraction for the price being charged.4. Lake - The lake is the first attraction you will see which is free to watch but boating is chargeable. They are flea markets around it, so its definitely worth to take a walk around and you even get bicycles for rent to ride around it.5. Dolphin's Nose - The longest downhill and uphill walk so far for me has been my journey to Dolphin's nose. I am not a very jumpy trekker but if you want to go here, you have to trek. There are no roads, steps but just a bunch of stones, pebbles unevenly scattered. Its worth going since the view is really good, but yet again i would not advise if you are not used to walking a lot.Specific Dos - Please carry a thin jacket or sweater, since it is cold in mornings and evenings. Do try as much walking as possible and save up on the Taxi fares. Carry kets, shoes if you plan to see these places around.Specific Don'ts- Do not sign up for these day packages by cars as they are the fastest way to scam you. They are charge from anywhere between 1200 to 2500 for showing you to 10-12 places, but all the places are in vicinity and half the places are not worth seeing. Kodai is beautiful for its pleasant weather, view points, and i would like to inspire you all to walk. If you are travelling with parents, then please take cabs around but choose places you want the driver to take, they will accommodate.Places to eat - Astoria Veg (Meals are very yummy),  A momo places near the Tibetian shops around the lake, Hilton Cafe.Shopping -  I found the street markets to be expensive and the shop keepers not very keen on bargaining since that's possibly their only source of income and they are able to sell it at high prices. Places i wish i could see - Pine forests."
271,Leisure walk,A tourist spot created just to attract outside tourists. Not worth visiting it. Staff behavior is unfriendly. Those who never visited any high altitude area can only find so e interest here.
272,Hide-n-seek with clouds,A beautiful facility wherein the civic society is not paying attention towards cleanliness discipline.
273,Beautiful View,Nice little walk. Be sure to check out the views from the binoculars else you might end up getting from the second gate. We reached here in the morning when there were hardly any visitors. Even the stalls were just being set up so I guess it might be getting more crowded during…
274,Pleasant walk with a view!,"Felt like a shoddy town from up above. Too many settlements, dirty outlook. Needs better care. Weirdly enough, doesn't seem like a hill station with lack of greenery"
275,Heavenly Pleasure during Walk in the Cloud,We visited this just before leaving Kodaikanal. Surprisingly there was very less crowd so we walked quite peacefully enjoying the view and munching onto some snacks. The Coakers Walk overlooks the foothills so you can get good views of small hills and the plains with the mist working on its magic. Also there is a small observatory which has a telescope which would give you good views of the town for just Rs 10....I think it might be a good option for your kids. Also try to go there early morning or towards the evening to enjoy the views to the fullest.
276,nice walk with good views,This is exactly what you need aftr a tiring day of roaming around the Kodaikanal tourist spots which all lie in the same route which causes the traffic all along. This is a sweet spot. It's right next to the bus stand area. It's got a small entrance. But as you get into path you will realize it's beauty. It's a walk trail along the city which gives a great view.
277,Heaven on Earth,Very nice & Peaceful place...Very pleasant place...Feelings of fresh air...We can enjoy lot there with friends & family...
278,nothing special just one view of coluds and seenery,"We could see the rare Neelakurinji flowers which blooms every 12 years here. These may be seen till Oct - Nov this year. Next it will be seen only in 2030.This is about 1 km long walkway by the side of a hill in the heart of the city. You can enjoy the valley views while you walk and click photos. When we went some construction was going on, so that ppl can click better pictures with the Neelakurinji."
279,Fantastic Place,"Go here but don't make this your choice destination. If you are lucky and the fog and mist is less, you will get a good view."
280,Was a nice experience with full of fog,Though the place is open from morning to evening 7:30 I would personally recommend to visit coakers around 6 PM . This way you would be able to enjoy the view in light and darkness both plus this place is rarely crowded by this time . It is perfect for a romantic walk . You get a really great view of valley and city from coakers . Even after tiring dolphin nose trek I enjoyed walking around this place very much . The walk is not too long and is pleasant .
281,Kodaikanal Coakers walk,"The view of the surrounding hills, valleys and the habitation was indeed breath taking; we would have stayed for some more time had it not started raining. Must visit this place in liesure"
282,Wonderful ,"I went there with my best friend sahi honestly speaking I think there is nothing spcl to c but that is a special time with some one special na we can enjoy lot """
283,Nice View of the city....,"this wqas one good attraction earl;ier, but now pure money loot..  added some space for shopkeepers ... now view through telescope is again charged, and one nonsense sitting in between also with telescope and charging for telescope viewing, trhat too of spot which he decides..…"
284,Very serene,"They charge atrociously for the persons and for the cell phone carried. You can look down at the valley , but nothing great . It's a waste of time and money"
285,Average with average views,"Good to visit once. Went during the day so missed the mist. Best to visit early mornings. It looked like a wonderful place when I visited in my childhood with parents, now looks like an ordinary place. ."
286,Excellent Climate,"One thing I am convinced about is to avoid the hills or anywhere for that matter during the holiday weekends. Everybody who is anybody turns up in every mode of conveyance possible and clogs up everything. If you hoped for quiet and peaceful walks ,forget it.Not going to happen. Coakers walk is no exception. You first need to park your vehicle somewhere. Then there is a queue to buy tickets. Then you weave your way through selfie wielding tourists and vendors and  everybody else. What joy is there in that ?? As an attraction , I really hope some attention is paid to the upkeep of the walkway- add flower beds so you bring in some colour , decent toilets please and remove vendors from the walk. If you must take care of their livelihood , do it elsewhere .Allow for uninterrupted  views of the distant valleys etc , which is why you ventured here in the first place."
287,Excellent view,Coakers Walk is a one-kilometre-long walking plaza in the city of Kodaikanal.  It is a preferred location for the Tourists for morning and evening walks. We can have the pleasure of viewing valleys and range of mountains from this Walk Path. You can also have a bicycle ride on…
288,A View Point near the Town,"Relaxing,beautiful, no chaos, serene, lovely, do yoga, play your sport, relieve your stress, enjoy to the fullest, calm and quite, great for family,friends,couple, please ensure to keep this beauty beautiful, mess free, clean and tidy"
289,Nice view but poor maintenance,It was a wonderful experience walking on the pathway amidst mist. A long walk indeed but we didnt feel tired at all. There are shops along the path so you could pick some souvenirs for your loved ones.
290,Amazing view,Envision having a tranquil stroll through the mists and looking at the magnificence of the slopes surrounding you!
291,"Average maintenance, charged for kids as well",The scenary and the beauty of this place can never ever be described with words. You can only feel the greatness when you go in person and visit the site. Amazing place for a long romantic walk!
292,Nice view,Early morning or late evening visit would be ideal for Clicks. The entry fee per person is Rs. 20/- Additional fees would be collected for Cameras.
293,Beautiful View but very congested in summer,We went on a weekend to Kodaikanal in February and decided to explore the area. The whole place was filled with clouds and we captured some really cool pics. We also had some hot tea to go with the weather.
294,Good place for Kodaikanal standards,"Nice place to spend time with friends and relatives. Especially if you want to recall your childhood memories with close friends, it is an ideal place."
295,Breathtaking view of the hills and the valley,"It was very overcast on the day we went so couldn't see anything except the clouds. But on a clear day, it would be a good place to visit. But it was nice to walk through the clouds and feel the droplets on the skin."
296,30 bucks for a decent stroll with views.. ,I reached here at 7.30 am when the shops were closed and there were 5-6 more people besides me on the walk. Its just a 15 min walk from one gate to the other. You can ask your driver to wait at the other gate or you can walk back to the first gate. I enjoyed the drifting clouds…
297,Nice view on mist free days,It's a good place. Not much to say about it. I'm just filling up the space now. Sorry for the inconvenience
298,Excellent View Point,Hi....to all readers.. Proud to write a review about coakers walk... My native is Kodaikanal. I used to go daily to this place. I am a travel agent.. Not only for this I used to visit to fulfill my mind by watching a pleasent view which makes me fresh... Nice view of Theni and lower part of Kodaikanal with greenish scenery makes you feel perfect.. Believe me worth place... I feel happy to spend my time here... Enjoy your trip to coakers walk 🚶....
299,Man made,Although the Telescope they have are substandard or not managed well as an experience...dont waste your money on it.
