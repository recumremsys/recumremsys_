0,Miramar Beach üåä,This beach is very close to my house and I‚Äôm very regular with this beach. It‚Äôs little crowded but you won‚Äôt find any problem if you maintain social distancing from each others. Good for morning and evening walk. And you will  have wonderful experience.
1,Quite and Less Commercialised,this beach is cool and there are a lot of food stalls outside this beach and  really good to chill with frnds
2,Not impressive,I have been to the beach in the morning and I enjoyed the the beach a lot.it is beautiful and less crowded beach. I like the beach.
3,Amazing place ,"There are a lot of food stalls on the road side- beach is not the purest- the sand is a bit darker than the other beautiful beaches of Goa in the north, across the Mondovi river."
4,Miramar Beach,This beach is in the Panjim City and very less crowded and a bit dirty. People go there for morning and evening walks.
5,Shady area also near beach,This beach isn't very dirty but yes it is way more commercialised than most beaches and can tend to get dirty
6,Nice ,"I have been to this beach with my family and kids ! This is one beach which is centrally located from the town and accessible The kids and family both enjoys it as the beach is not been explored by too many people's and it's clean beach ! There are lots of stalls of fast food , restaurant  and hawkers with balloons and other kids accessories which is very good and keep the kids engaged There are few swings also and area where people can sit and kids can enjoy Don't get into the water further as it's quite deep and steep in and you will not be able to figure out the depth of the same ! Enjoy the beach and weather"
7,Small beach beside coniferous Pine Forest,Its a really small beach. Locals don't even consider it as a beach. There are no activities to do over here. But if you are looking for a less crowded place than this is where you should be.
8,Less crowded beach in Panaji,"very nice beach, we had the privilege of staying at the marriot goa right in front of this beach so we can see the disembarks of people all day, was really fun"
9,A Polluted Paradise,The beach is so attractive that during my stay everyday I went to this beach and spent quite a long time as felt hypnotised. On enquiry it could be learnt that the original name of the beach was Porta de Gaspar Dias. Particularly the confluence of Mandovi river and Arabian Sea is very much attractive.
10,The place to go to have a very popular savoury called CHAAT.,"I've been walking this beach almost daily for some weeks now. It's a great place to get a good walk in, but I'd recommend avoiding the water. I do see many locals and domestic tourists wading in, but my calves get itchy and rashy just from wandering at the edge of the water.It's a great place to watch local guys play cricket, couples write love messages in the sand, and children romp about at the water's edge. On the weekends the cotton candy vendors are out in full force and the happy crowds of people are a delight to see. I don't understand it myself, but one hour party boats with blaring music seem quite popular with the domestic tourists. So if that's your cup of tea, it's available here.The sunsets are pretty, though a haze of pollution is common.As this is where the River Mondovi meets the Arabian Sea, much of the pollution and even visible trash winds up here. It saddens me to see the trash embedded in the sands as the tides withdraw."
11,Shade less beach,"This is classed as a ‚Äòlocal spot‚Äô, a local beach. The beach was really really quiet. Perfect for me to be honest. I don‚Äôt like crowds upon crowds. Not many tourists around this area also so you will get the oddly stare from the people who live around the area. But really clean. And probably one of my favorite beaches I seen here in Goa! üíØ"
12,Miramar Beach,not many people recommend the beach but i genuinely think its a nice beach specially during early morning and late evening for a stroll..
13,Just another beach...,"I went to this beach with my friends as i was staying near panjim area, and this beach was nearest to me, But this beach is like pile of dirt. its extremely dirty, You can't even sit there anywhere. Though its very crowded as this beach is near city area. you can try some street chaats at this beach, same like chaupati of mumbai.. Do try paav bhaji."
14,"Brown, black dirty ",It is a beautiful beach and very safe for playing with the kids. It has a great sunset view. Excellent for a few private momets
15,great,Its a good beach with sand and trees almost adjacent to each other. I saw a lot of ppl came with family for a picnic on this beach coz trees were giving a great shadow of happiness :)
16,Definitely not the best one.,this is the closest beach to the centre of Panjim. I was surprised by how empty it was but this was more a function of its sheer size than necessarily being devoid of people. it's not a touristy beach being more a hang out for the locals but it's as good as any to watch the sunset which is always spectacular here
17,Chance to see dolphin ‡§°‡•â‡§≤‡•ç‡§´‡§ø‡§® ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•å‡§ï‡§æ,"Visited this beach with family. This beach is not crowded. There are no beach shacks, just a few vendors."
18,nice place to relax and enjoy,"It is small, there are much better places to go to in Panjim. It is also very dirty. When we were there we did not see any one swimming."
19,"ok for a stroll, nothing more",this beach in goa is ok but not good if you want to spend some time there. lots of good beaches in goa. so avoid this
20,Good but you are not in goa for this beach,"It's THE beach at Panjim.Pretty crowded, but you can walk to one corner of the beach for some quiet and space.Relatively clean.Good for a nice long walk, eating Corn/pineapple or chats.The sand is dark brown to black.not very appealing.Lots of joggers and Walker around.Life guards are very attentive.There's no place to change clothes or shower."
21,Good beach,Miramar Beach is a regular beach ahead of the city of Panjim. It's clean but it's just another beach of Goa. Locals frequent here often. Tourists mostly can spare 15 to 20 minutes maximum and move ahead.
22,Morning visit for a short walk,"The  beach is very close to Panjim city, yet not crowded. It is cleaner compared to other beaches. Street side vendors sell many items. Locals like the beach and gather in the evening."
23,MIRAMAR WITH ALL_MBM,it is quite a clean beach. Boating experience was quite nice. not heavily crowded. only problem I faced was I couldn't find nice eateries in this beach
24,Nearest Sunset Point to Panjim,This is a white sand beach and a beautiful place to have a calm windy evening .. not many sea activities here .. lovely place
25,Deserves Cleanliness,Long stretch costal beach. Whenever I go to Panjim I make sure I visit this beach to spend some quality time.
26,Good but not best,"One of the beaches in the city near Panjim, Miramar beach is really beautiful. I visited this beach twice while i was in Goa. It was crowded with tourists but much less than Baga beach"
27,Good beach,The beach is surrounded by  lush greenery and is not very crowded . You do have lifeguards placed near the shore. If you have options to visit other beaches in Goa then you could easily miss this. The reason: The waters have turned ugly and dirty with the blotches of weathered oily material known to be dumped by the passing ships. This can cause severe skin infection . Apart from this you could see loads of waste around the shore and in a very poor state. The management has totally ignored the pathetic state of this beach. You could walk around the shore and enjoy the breeze. Else give it a miss.
28,A walk in the sand.,The Miramar beach in Panjim is a nice beach with a beautiful view of the sea but the place is always crowded
29,Panaji's beach at the mouth of river Mandovi.,The beach is nice for jogger‚Äôs n just in general to walk around.. There are no shacks or cafes.. so please carry ur own water n food. It‚Äôs lovely in the evening We also saw fishermen getting their catch out of the sea. Beautifully tree lined and a lovely place to relax
30,Good Beach,"It is just ordinary beach,nothing special about it.It is close to Panjim and is not very crowdy,but not maintained."
31,Average beach,It's been a beach where I've spent good 2 years of my school life playing beach football and volleyball.Decent chaat snacks available along the road in the evening. Bit crowded as tourists who visit Panaji usually end up visiting it as well.
32,"Nice beach, near by street food is great",This is the dirtiest beach among the other beaches we visited....Only advantage is it is very close to Panjim. Some one who is staying in Panjim can visit during evenings...
33,Being peaceful  yet active,Nice beach . You can visit during sunset or sunrise. It is not a very crowded beach. people are seen placing on the beach . Outside the beach there are many eating stalls giving bhel puri and pau bhaji.
34,Very Dirty beach,The beach is good for boating. Nothing much for other activities. There is no much crowd in this beach. One can spend a good time here in the evening watching sunset.
35,"MIRAMAR BEACH,PANJI,GOA.",The unique thing about this beach is that it is right in the heart of town and centrally located so you can walk around and enjoy the views.
36,Lovely beach,"It sis very near to Miramer Residency . Beach was ok , but not that much good . Night time it is good & we can sit and enjoy the see tides sounds . We can also see the light house from this place."
37,I wish I could give zero star,its a very cool beach.very few people will b here.you will love to move on sand and u may collect some corals as well as i saw few people were collecting it
38,Not bad ,One can spend a good time in this beach. The beach is crowded sometimes. Lot of shops for snacks like chat centers.. pine trees shades. Better to go in evenings
39,Boring,"This beach is right at the end of the City. Which makes it easily accessible and affordable to visit. The beach has many hotels nearby and Shopping Arcade. So you can jump out of the beach and order healthy food or go for quick shopping, as its few steps away. This is a great place to watch the sunset in the evening sit along with your friends and a chit chat. You can come also along with your kids are family and this place is absolutely safe. The beach is not too deep as the other beaches but very calm and relaxing. You can hear the waves of the beach and enjoy its natural sound that gives peace to the mind and soul. This place is absolutely safe to go for a quick swim or a quick walk in the water. But make sure you do not swim during the bad weather time or the monsoon.Just as you come out of the beach there is the main road and you will find every sort of street food available. So as you dip your feet in the salty water you can come out and to the street and have a nice meal or a snack."
40,Average Beach in Goa,"Its a long city/town Beach with baywathers. Full of locals and this is maybe not the best beach to wear bikini. There are no shadow at the beach, but lot of people, and the water is small."
41,Miramar beach,This beach is not very nice. It is partly blackened sand and is used extensively by locals. There are no toilets on the beach so I suspect the water presents a risk to health. No cafes etc.
42,"Monsoon season , very wet and cloudy",Better to get a taxi to much better beaches in the North .Taxis are not expensive and will stay to return you to your accommodation.
43,Marvellous Miramar,Beach is nice..it's Lil bit crowded since it's located in Panjim city... U have some good options of street food at the entrance.. Also the beach gives u an option to take ferry ‚õ¥.. U can see a good sunset over here...
44,cool beach,This beach to good for a walk and small stay but not for swimming or surfing. Water quality is bit poor.
45,Linked to one of the best hotel chains,I have been visiting this beach since i was little. Have tons of memories at this place. A lot of tourists visit this beach as its so pretty. Situated right at the capital city of Goa its a lot easy to access as well
46,Joyful trip,This is one of the cleanest beach I have ever visited. Most of the tour operators let toriest visit here. You can see south Goa beach from here.
47,Goa visit,"this beach is near to panaji city center and quite clean and windy ..easily approachable if u r staying at Panaji ,goa ..good hotels nearby"
48,Dirty beach. Avoid,The beach is without any shacks but still is not very clean as it is littered with plastic & glass bottles
49,Safe Beach,The beach is not that crowded as other beaches of north goa because of no shacks around but you can have a bath and enjoy the waves but in afternoon avoid the sun
50,Long beach walk,I would rate this beach as average as water is polluted and black in color. Sea shore is big and one can play beach games there. Some pay bhaji and bhel options are there.
51,Visted the Beach and also join the Boat Trip,"Hi, on my many visits to Goa.. visit to this beach is always on cards. Located in panjim, the miramar beach has crowd at any time of the day."
52,Too much,Long beach just outside Panaji.  Lots of dolphin tours leave here at the Marriott end of the beach. There is good parking if you want to visit with a number of beach shacks.
53,Beautiful Miramar!!,Well.. among the less famous beaches. It's only plus point being in Panjim. A typical relatively unclean beach.
54,Great point,Miramar beach has plenty of food choices. Its a long beach with decent crowd. You can also swim here. You can enjoy a nice sunset. There is also miramar residency and hanuman temple near by.
55,Good one for the kids.. ,"This beach is nothing special , I don't see the appeal for it , just some orange sand and brown water.. lots of people and traffic. I recommend seeing many other beaches in the area."
56,dirty beach in goa,It‚Äôs not the best beach in the area however Goa is spoilt by the amount of beaches it has Its a sandy beach as with others we saw It doesn‚Äôt have the touristy feel with only Indians we saw here I wouldn‚Äôt put on the top of your listing if your going past yes have a look
57,Quite Dirty,"This beach is very calm and you will enjoy perhaps North and South beaches are totally different in a culture. Joyful,  musical,  full of life and lots of music and even public you can expect in North baga and Calungut beach."
58,Awesome view,"This beach right in Panjim, Goa. One of the best beaches should you want to play football, as its not sandy but muddy. You shall find several locals around. This beach does not necessarily attract many tourists due to its secluded location, almost hidden. The best view would be of that of sunrise and sunset. This is a must visit if you really are a wanderer, and love visiting offbeat places."
59,public beach,Miramar is the beach closest to Panjim. So the beach is very crowded on weekends and holidays in the evenings.However it is a different story on weekdays. The crowd is tolerable . The beach is very clean given the crowd it attracts. There are structures for children to play. At the entrance you will also find four statues of human heads. The beach is well lit. The sunset in the evenings is a fantastic sight. The air is very cool in the evenings. For those inclined there are many fast food joints at the road circling the beach. Thankfully none at the beach.
60,One of the nicest beaches I‚Äôve seen ,Miramar Beach is a nice beach but is too overcrowded. Hardly any space to move and not very enjoyable
61,miramar beach,"Miramar Beach in Goa is a favourite tourist attraction where one can find a lot of tourists on the beach or one can walk on the pavement in front of the beach as there are a lot of vendors selling paani puri, bhel puri, papdi chat where one can find a lot of people who want to have snacks. The beach is usually crowded and poorly maintained and can be a lot better.One can take a boat ride in mid day where one can go into the middle of the sea and spot dolphins if one is lucky. The boat ride lasts for an hour and costs 300 Rupees per person. Try to prefer a big boat instead of a small one and it's usually enjoyable if the music and songs played are not very loud and if it's not raining.Dr. Javed Rasheed"
62,Amazing & Best beach ever,"The beach is a long stretch of golden sand & photographs of it look very good. however, close up, it is often not too clean. there are no sunbeds or shacks, which makes it generally less busy, but also less comfortable. the sea is sometimes too rough to swim in & can be dirty, especially at the northern end where all the boats dock. Good for walking along & taking a quick dip, but not for a day at the beach for most people."
63,Beach football,This beach is still clean as compared to Baga or Calangute. We spent few hours walking and having some food at the shack..The location of the beach is amazing..we stayed at Dona Paula so it was accessible from that place. Dona Paula and Miramar beach are some of the nice tourist points to visit. Some good memories with family enjoying the sunset.
64,Nice Beach,"Miramar Beach is busy and spectacular for sunsets.  It is not the cleanest beach, but not bad, around middle of the full Indian range.  The people watching is great fun.  And the sun set directly in front of us as we strolled along at 6PM.  Truly beautiful."
65,Not a nice experience,"I have seen better beaches in the world and also in Goa that Miramar Beach I felt was okay. Rather you can visit the food truck outside the Miramar Beach, that is really nice. You getting everything in a very reasonable price. Try that out."
66,Early morning walk along Miramar beach,"Miramar beach is the beach to go if you‚Äôre staying in Panaji city. Maybe not as exotic as the north beaches but definitely worth a visit . Specially during sunset , the view is breathtaking !!There is a CCD nearby that has an outdoor area , with view of the sunset on the beach .Can get crowded on weekends , but weekdays are still good ."
67,Good beach,"This is a beach in the city of Panjim, popular with locals and tourists both. Good for late afternoon visit."
68,One of the good beaches in Goa,Good beach although Goa does have better ones. Was there for morning walk. Not too many people. Clean.
69,"Serne , calm and a fun dolphin cruise","Conveniently located, this beach is a favourite with the tourists. It is not as crowded as many of those further up north."
70,So so,"It is a big stretch of beach, but no facilities (unless you count the woods) and not very clean.Probably best for a short evening stroll to see the sun set."
71,Magical Miramar,"This is the beach right in the heart of Panaji city. Quite a sprawling beach, the advantage is that it is most easily accessible by walk from the city center and can be combined with various shopping and dining activities. The drawback is that it can get very crowded. Mornings are better to visit since there are less crowds."
72,Calm beach with limited crowd,"the beach is not at all commercialized, you can relax your self and enjoy the natural beauty. one of the best part is the naturally created small sand bank/island on the walking distance from the beach where you will have water surrounded from all four sides."
73,big and wide beach,Miramar Beach is a very beautifulbeach is Goa. It is a paradise on earth and must be visited atleast once in a lifetime.
74,Beautiful,It's nice experience at Miramar Beach. Less crowded. And also you can play volleyball with locals. It's great experience.
75,Peace,"People prefer this beach since it is near to Panji and accessible by local bus easily. Small eating joints are available. Therefore, families gather to enjoy their time."
76,Very calm,"Like Juhu Beach of Mumbai  , ok to visit but do not go for  swim as the beach is not that appealing. If you want to street food you enjoy here"
77,One of the best beaches,nice plays but no crud we come 5 people are Miriam beach october from Mumbai we also watch Goa science center
78,Good,I stayed at Marriot a d the Miramar beach was accessible from the property. The beach was good but not the best beach within Goa. The soil was black and beach was not clean.
79,Beautiful beach,"Unlike other beaches of Goa, it is a less crowded and  calm one. Beach environment is clean and noise free so you can enjoy the sounds of waves."
80,Beach is unexpected.,This is probably the smallest beach of Goa right in the city of Panjim. You can hang around here for a evening. Sand is Golden yellow and has trees to give you shadow.
81,Sunset walk,Very nice beach to chill out with family (with kids). No vendor pestering. Science centre is right opposite which could be of interest to kids too.
82,Clean,"Lovely beach and worth going there once we are in Goa, good food around and cleanliness can be improved"
83,Goaüòçüòç,It is one of the coolest yet crowded beaches in north goa with good scenic beauty. One doesn't face any hurdles in locating this beach.
84,Average,I visited this beach when it was pouring cats and dogs but I enjoyed every moment I spent hereAs it was raining I may have the only soul on this beachThe waves roared at me but it was melodious - timing I guessI could see the river boats bobbing violently and the ships on the horizon tossing violentlyChoppy seas are great for an observer but a nightmare for the guy on the boat or shipThe skies were absolutely Grey and so were the houses you see when your back is to the seaThe beach was clean the sands wet but pristineNo plastics and or plastic bottlesI would love to visit again
85,a beach after all,Goa has many beautiful beaches but Miramar beach is not properly maintained. No white sand and no beach games.Not a worth visit.
86,City beach ,Long beach stretching in to the Bay at Panaji.  THe beach is fairly clean but can get some waste from the town. Lots of boat trips start from the Bay end and these look worth a visit.
87,Beach in the city,"Compare to other beaches in Goa, Miramar beach is average as there is not much activities to do and nothing much around to see."
88,Beauty,A decent beach you can visit and sit around in the mornings but not in the afternoon it‚Äôs very hot and you can get tanned so be careful ...if you visit Panjim you should go there
89,Unimpressive,We visited many times.Very beautiful n crowded place.The sunset is v nice view here.The Miramar beach is in the city centre of Panaji.Outside the beach you will get chats.The famous chatstreetvis here.
90,Golden Beach,"Beautiful sunset - I won‚Äôt went there for a short period around this time to view it. It is a fairly nice beach, not as crowded as some of other Goan beaches"
91,A renowned tourist destination ,Its was a lovely sunny day‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏èIts closely the city and a local beach to go for. Well its lovely to spend time on the beach watching sunset. Its a little crowdy during Sunday evenings.Dont forget to enjoy local street food
92,one of the most clean beach in goa,This is average beach. This beach is not good for bath. This beach is near to Panjim. You can also avoid this beach.
93,nice beach in Goa,Very close to the city .Easily accessible by public transport.Its not much crowded and can relax and enjoy the environment.Scenic views of mountains across makes it very special beach for nature lovers.
94,Miramar beach,The beach is small and less crowded than north and south Goa beaches. There are no restaurants except one soft drinks center on the beach. No water sports activity center is available. Overall it is a nice beach for morning/evening walk and may be for a bath.
95,Miramar Beach,"Visit to this beach was awsome with lots of water sports and life guards on duty,this beach is connected to the panjim city."
96,"Good, peaceful and clean beach.","This beach is clean and neat beach in goa.it is also near from panjim.a sunset time it is very scenic place.no rush,and no croud.this is perfect place for swimmer."
97,Clean beach with no shacks,The biggest positive of Miramar beach is the Proximity to Panjim. But if u can travel a bit u can reach Baga or Vagatore which are definitely best beaches among all. When we visited we didn't find any water sports there. Very less crowded.
98,My Pick for sure!,The water is not that good for bathing. The sand was fine. But overall the beach is good. Lifeguards were present and they told everyone to not to stay in water after 6:30. So check the timings before you go.
99,Well Maintained Beach,required more cleanness on this beach but good for boating and water sports.within city so traveller can choose local and pvt options for transport .very well connected
100,"For your eyes only, please do not swim",This beach is located in panjim and It is crowded some time.This beach is not as relaxing beach than the other beaches in goa and it is not so clean than the other beaches in goa.There is lack of facilities in beach.
101,Limited facilities for tourists ,A refrehsingly calm beach in the capital city Panjim. the dolphin watching cruise is quite cheap and completely value for money. Great place to watch sunset and bathe in the sea.
102,A best place for evening Gathering.,"The place offers sea side food and vistas that you should not miss. The beach is shallow and is safe, can easily run into it with kids.. Marriott is walkable from the beach, recommended place to stay if you fall in love with the beach."
103,Beach with trees around!,Goa has lots of beaches everywhere. But there some of the few beaches are very popular in locals as well as tourists. Miramar Beach is included in one of them.
104,Peace at Beach,The beach is near Panaji and Dona Paula. This beach has boat ride for 2 hours which takes place to different places. This should also be in travelers list. Its having a small forest area.
105,Good for an evening walk,"The beach is located close the Panaji city. There are many adventure activities and water sports. Clean sand, local food and shopping attracts travellers."
106,evening walk at miramar beach,One of the good beaches in goa.  The beach has less crowd as compared to the other beaches!  One can spend a nice evening!
107,Average beach in panjim city,"Enjoyed a lot with my family. Very nearer to hotel Ginger. Also enjoyed the boat drive. The scenary, location was great."
108,Just one of the beaches ,This is a nice beach which is around 15-20 min drive from dona paula. Nearby street market serves delicious food.
109,Quite and peaceful,We travelled here in November 2017. It is certainly not the best of beaches. The beach was littered with rubbish and was not a place i would choose to sunbathe. The beach itself does not have the lovely yellow/white sand like others we visited further up the coast. It looked blackened by oil. We did not feel this was a great beach to spend time and did not have all the beach restaurants like we ound on candolim beach.I would not recommend to friends and family.
110,Miramar For Evening Walks,"We just had a walk here to see what the beach was like. It's a decent beach but there aren't really restaurants or huts along it. There was a very small lifeguarded area for swimming, with lots of people crowded in it. They were also running dolphin watching boats further down which were blaring out Indian and European pop music. Atmospheric..."
111,Disheartening beach,This beach is located in the Panjim area of Goa and is cleaner than others. Small vendors sell their wares and you can have small street food joints where you can have a biteIt's worth going for a stroll on this stretch
112,Beach evening,"Miramar is another beach in South Goa, comparatively less crowded and less commercialized. A clean sandy beach with a patch of trees, that provides shade from the blazing Sun near the beach. Comparatively quiet beach, where one can enjoy a morning / evening stroll or relish the nature peacefully."
113,Family Time,a lovely beach easily accesible by road. a must visit when you are in goa. its closer to panaji and has a cafe coffee day opposite if you wish to grab a nice cup pf coffee and sit and enjoy it at the beach.
114,Nice long beach,Pretty crowded and can get dirty. The water is blackish and the sand of a darker shade. That is maybe because it's a confluence of mandovi river with the sea.
115,clean and tidy Beach in the Heart of Panji city,this is big big and wide beach of Goa. here sand are very small.beach is very clean. here water actives are also offered. One can see dolphin here in the nearby sea
116,Boat ride to watch Dolphins and Sunset,Location of  Miramar Beach is very good. The best time to go to this beach is early morning or during the evening. when there is less crowd
117,Nice beach with little garbage thrown around.,This beach has recently got famous. The sunsets here are beautiful and the atmosphere is lovely. The waters are shallow and perfect for swimming. One of the best beaches in Goa.
118,scenic,"My cabbie described this as the locals beach and not good for swimming due to strong currents. If you bring a picnic there is a big uncrowded beach with some tree shade, albeit away from the waters edge. Good for a beach stroll in the cool of the day No sunbed, beach bar or cafe facilities. Not what we were looking for so a got a cab to Condolim beach which ticked all our boxes."
119,A very good beach in the heart of the city.,"At Miramar, one can step into the beach immediately after stepping out of car. Very clean and almost about five kilometers length. Early morning or in the evenings one can watch fisherman returning with days catch. It is also suitable for swimming. There are two small worshipping places at the circle and little ahead on road along the beach, plenty of fast food carts could be seen. There are hotels.  All of them are licensed and hygiene is maintained. Plenty of parking around."
120,Miramar beach nice and cool ,This beach is really good and nature friendly and its also good for family if you want to spend time its nice place...
121,A beach in the city ,The beach is not clean. The waters are brackish and I am sure if you wade through the waters you would seriously get skin infections.There is nothing special about this beach. If you are given a chance to explore the beaches in Goa this should be either the last option or not at all in the list.
122,Boat cruise,If you are looking for partying which Goa is famed for . This is not it. This beach  is meant for Panjim residents for evening stroll. There are some nice eateries around though .
123,Miramar Beach,There are plenty of beaches in Goa.  It is not possible to visit each and every beach in Goa.  Miramar is closest to Panaji.  Nice and clean place.
124,Clean beach,This place is extremely boring. We went around 7:30 pm and it was not worth it. It is too dark and unsafe..you will not see any street light there too.
125,The beach is clean and not crowded,"Nice beach with lot of activities going on and around the beach, both locals and tourists frequently visit this as it offers an opportunity either to just relax or enjoy so many different things to do. The boat tour operators offers boat trips for Dolphin sightings and the hawkers at the street close to the beach offers several fun and fast food choices lke famous Pav Bhaji, Chaat etc. Overall a nice beach. The cleanliness becomes sometimes an issue here as it's a public beach, would request all visitors to be aware of Hygiene and help in keeping it Clean"
126,nice beach,This beach is brown and black. Overfilled with garbage and bad smelling. Swimming is not an option as there is garbage from the river flooding onto the beach.
127,Sunset view,Miramar is a perfect beach if you visit in the evening time. The waves are crazy and perfect for sitting on sand and observe the sea!
128,Miramar Beach,Located in Panjim this beach is ok . Lot of food stalls indicating the popularity of the place. Sunset view was good.
129,Skip it if you can,This is one of the nearest beach to Panaji city among other beaches of Dona Paula beach and caranzalem Beach. comparatively this beach is neat and Clean and easy accessible as it is just opposite to Science Museum.Children's Play ground is available here. Good option for Photo shoot.
130,Beautiful,This beach is just 3km from panjim city. It is a good place to spend in the evening. Food stall nearby the beach is also good.
131,very dirty beach,Visited it during evening time and it was an amazing experience. Sitting in the sand near by the beach waters and viewing the sunset felt very good. There are food places and stalls near by so one does not need to worry about that. Loved it.
132,Lively place,"When you hear Goa, 2 beach names associated with it are Colva & Miramar. that is because both the Beaches are very accessible and in Prime locations. While i Have reviewed Colva, this is my take on the Miramar Beach.If you are expecting a quite evening to your self, just forget it. this Place is almost crowded 24 x 7. Very less parking space. A part from being an attraction, Miramar is also having 2 colleges, a school within a radius of 1 km. which makes it overly populated. Evenings are okay, if you are foodie you will have plenty of Eating options. Fast/Junk Food.In recent times, there is a Not so ""lucky Seven"" Grounded on the Shore to Pollute the environment. so Bathing is no longer and option."
133,Must visit beach in Panjim,If you are in Panjim for a few days it is a good beach to go to for a walk or jog but for a beach I would rather recommend going out of Panjim
134,Beach which is Near to Panaji City,"While on Boat Trip at Miramar Beach, I have seen various places near to beach. Also seen dolphins in sea, looked very attractive and nice."
135,Great ‚Äòurban beach‚Äô in Panjim,"This beach is located in the Panjim city. So it is very good beach in the main city. Surrounded by lush greenery this beach is very good for unwind and relax, as compare to other beaches it offers very limited activity. You can enjoy street food here. A perfect place for beach-walk."
136,Nice place to enjoy ,this was one of cleanest beaches of goa.. in the main chownk of panjim... but no water sports here.. but they have morning trip to Dolphin watching by boat
137,Ordinary public beach,I suggest going to beaches further north as this is too close to where the river dumps and it is not as nice as others and doesn't offer food or drink options.  Basic public beach
138,Excellent beach,One of the best beaches in Goa.. Neat and Clean..But that was not the thing that made me impressed..It was the kites flying high up in the sky.. We were so lucky to be in Miramar beach on that particular day to witness the magnificent International Kite flying festival held in association with Goa tourism. That was a wonderful scene.. Located close to the main road and on the way to Dona Paula view point this one is a must visit beach in Goa.. .
139,Beautiful beach,"We come from the Gold Coast/Australia having the most beautiful beaches in the world so I think i'm a bit bias, but i thought the area was a bit average.. The water and surrounding area was rather dirty not encouraging me to have a dip"
140,Miramar beach quiet place,"It's like any other beach, don't know if there's anything very special other than a boat taking us to see dolphins in the water."
141,Average Beach Near River,Memorable place to explore goa. Do try the ice gola at the beach entrance especially the milk made one.
142,Just another beach,This beach is situated very near to Panjim hence very much accessible via vehicle. It offers you very peaceful coastline with very less crowd as compared to other North Goa beaches.
143,Miramar Beach,the beach is very popular & highly crowded. the sun set view is very attractive at this point. Also the coastline is very good for morning walkers.
144,Mira Mar Beach ,"Early morning/ late evening stroll along Miramar beach is a compulsory to-do thing in our Goa list... We just love the atmosphere here...Not too crowded, family oriented, no water sports and no touts... its relaxing and peaceful, exactly what a beach should be."
145,.. just OK..,"This beach is more of semi-commericial sort of beaches in Goa. Not much in water sports & activities & hence not much crowded as well. You can enjoy a boat ride here which takes you through the sea waters while sight seeing some important locations; also you can catch glimpse of Dolphins swimming through the sea near the boat. If you just want to hang around, there is quite expansive open space. People are found paying beach volleyball & football in that space. Couples usually take the shade under the trees to enjoy each others company. Overall, nice place to spend a couple of hours with your loved ones."
146,Avoidable,"This is a decent place with less hustle bustle and crowd,You can go here for picnic and spend couple of hours,however it is not happening like other beaches of North Goa,It is 2-3kms from main panjim City,there are lot of street shops in the evening outside beach"
147,Clean beach to spend time,This beach was on walking distance from our hotel. We spent our mornings here walking on the sand and kids enjoying playing in the water. The beach is very quiet and less crowded at that time. Definitely a thumbs up.
148,Tidy beach for a nice stroll,Beach is no where close to further north beaches. U have to walk a lot to reach d sea. No attraction as such
149,Close to city,"The waters are very nice to walk in along the sandy beach, but could use a good clean up, garbage tends to be an issue."
150,Lovely Beach,You can visit this beach as it has less crowd and near to panjim station.approx 7 kms. When we went there are no water sports due to monsoon.
151,Average Beach,"During my visit to Goa early January I came across this beach. I have no doubts in my mind to declare that Miramar is probably the worst beach in Goa. The main reason for this is that it's extremely dirty. Earlier I visited Goa's Baga beach, and it turned out to be quite dirty. However, if a comparison can be drawn between these two beaches, then Baga will be nowhere near Miramar!Once you step into this beach you will immediately notice that it's filled with plastic bags, empty food packets, leftover foods, wrappers, empty bottles, etc. This obviously made walking freely on the beach with a clear mind a very difficult task indeed. In fact, the sea water on the beach appeared unclean as well. Therefore, we were forced to drop our plans of stepping into the sea. Also, there were no lifeguards or some decent cafes nearby."
152,Miramar  Beach,We visited at the end of the day which may have clouded my judgement. It was just another beach with locals and cows who seemed to enjoy it much more than I did.
153,Locals favourite,"One of the well known beaches of Goa, and one of the more lively ones. When we visited there was a football tournament going on!"
154,Average place...!!!,The beach is clean and beautiful. Enjoyed the morning and evening walks. The boat cruise was a bonus with some momentary sightings of dolphins.
155,Closest beach to Panjim,We went here evening time . Beach was average . Night sitting in bech very nice and also peace full . No crowed at night time . Overall good and plesent experience in this beach..
156,Good at night time ,"Nice beach, close to main street. As with most of India, it could be a bit cleaner. Many locals, so if you are a foreigner, you will be stared at a LOT. Lots of crabs and jellyfish."
157,"Choppy seas, popular beach",Miramar beach is in heart of Goa city so this beach is my favorite beach than others. This beach have so many rides that attract tourists which is important reason and this is very nice place to spend time.
158,Things some don't know about Miramar Beach,Magnificent sunset and life-saving team makes it a great beach to swim at and to watch the sun go down
159,Long beach,Nice and clean beach with less number of people.One can actually enjoy the ocean rather than hogging and enjoying beach activities only.
160,Golden Beach,Easy approach and a lovely layout makes this beach unique from other beaches in Goa. It offers a lovely relaxing walk near the edge of the ocean. The oak trees on the beach adds to the beauty. Overall a very active beach with loads of life . A must visit while in goa
161,Quite beach,very quiet beach good to sit and relax .lack of shopping place.little traffic is there good to spend time in weekends.
162,Walk away from the crowd,A beach you can spend good quality time. Beautiful beach where you can leisure around with friends and family for a day.
163,A beach at the city!,"Awesome place to hang out! We went there in september end, it was not really busy and we had fun! You get a to add a very new experience to your life. The waves are soothing and relaxing. You can sit there and enjoy sunset. You can also get your feet massaged. We took our music speaker with us so while watching sunset we enjoyed our music. You can also buy food from local vendors and have a quality time. This places helps you forget all your issues and worries and refreshes you from within. You will fall in love with yourself again. You can go here with your friends or loved ones it is equally enjoyable. Wear comfortable clothes and you will be drenching in water so take a extra pair of clothes with you."
164,Average beach,Miramar beach is one of the nocest place in the panjim area great location great atmospherehere and bech was huge and totally clean sitting arrangementsis also faboulous
165,Nice & Calm beach,It covers approx 5-6 Kms stretch at the end of the city. Well maintained and clean. We could watch fishermen bringing their catch in the evenings by the sunset. Safe for families as waves are not very strong.
166,monsoon and arabian sea,Good and clean beach less people good to do water sports. Even night time is beautiful and even sunsets
167,Calm beach,"Not recommended for bath as better beaches are available. a very good place for children to play, and elders to relax. A safe beach."
168,Good beach but definitely not the best,Just a normal beach within the city. Had a lot of muck and did not feel like stepping in. Commercial place and mostly local crowd. Skip if you can.
169,Gud and clean beach,"Accidental we entered the southern part of Miramar beach which is about 1km south of the main entrance. Only realise later it's the Miramar beach. Relatively cleaner beach, less crowd and you can find people doing evening jog/walk and even playing foot ball (3-4 a side). I collected lots of shells with my son and watched the sun go down by 6pm.  It was beautiful."
170,Popular crowded beach,The beach was clean. It was my wife's first experience of sea and beaches. She loved every bit of it.
171,Tourist beach,It is nice Goa beach near panjim and with limited crowd. Easy free parking and all public transport available.
172,Plenty of sand.,It's not that commercial like baga and calangute but good for photography because of less crowd‚ò∫Ô∏è. You can not spent more than an hour because there is nothing to do except photography.
173,Good,"A decent well maintained beach in Panjim Goa. Compared to other beaches in North Goa, this is not crowded and neat."
174,There are better beaches,It is beautiful clean beach of North Goa Miramar Beach nearest destination from our stay at Marriott. It is very enjoyable lovely place
175,One of famous beach in Goa,Visited miramar beach as part of a day tour. A very clean and quiet beach on the day we went. Definately recommend a visit as it's a very beautiful beach.
176,One of the best beaches near Panjim,miramar beach is famous for sunset.. and the day for dolphin show.. evening out side there is chowapati like mumbai.. chat and shwarma we had shwarma in lafansa stall very tasty.. beach is so clean there is small garden for children this beach is not suitable for swim
177,Average beach,"Better facilities needs to be put in this beach .Good for families to sit and relax ,enjoy their own food and music .Lots of bottles lying around ,needs better access to the beach as well.Avoidable if you are going to Baga,Calangute etc"
178,Crowded beach,one of the must visit place in goa. enjoyed our visit here & the maintenance is not great but its ok.
179,Not so good beach,This beach is way much better when compared with juhu beach however cannot be compared with other beaches in Goa.
180,Too Crowded,"Miramar Beach. A quaint sea front and the only Beach closer to the heart of Panjim city.Self drive straight down in a car or bike or just hop into a bus at the Panjim bus station and look for  a bus that goes to Donapaula. When the bus reaches Panjim market, get alert. The stop will follow Campal followed by the Miramar stop. You won‚Äôt find it too hard to find when you see the Beach side and the conductors yelling aloud Miramar!The daytime doesn‚Äôt show much activity. However evening comes and you‚Äôll find locals and tourists alike thronging the Beach. The place is almost crowded. Plenty of vendors selling all sort of cheap merchandise.Kids play around the kid‚Äôs area and a walk further down, you‚Äôll find sumptuous food; both veg and non veg. The local cuisine includes snacks like Beef croquettes, cutlet bread, chourice pao. And then there is typical Indian stuff that‚Äôs sev Puri, Paani Puri, Ragda. For a little more variety you could stop by at the Shawarma joints.  That‚Äôs  a more modern look of Miramar that stands in the backdrop of prominent entities like the Gaspar Dias club, Dhempe college of Arts and science, the science center and sharada mandir school.However, my memories of Miramar are much contrary to the modern experience that one can have of this city Beach.It was especially during summer that we as kids looked forward to be here, Miramar Beach was a socializing point or meeting point for many locals and students during the summer vacation. The lovers of course took their refuge in one particular corner the beach which was secretive space camouflaged by many dense pine trees. You just had to say ‚Äòthey were in the pines‚Äô and the folks were blacklisted in the local gossip.  It was mostly in the evenings that we as kids looked forward to be at the Miramar Beach. The setting sun with it‚Äôs glowing red and yellow streaks looked like it could be touched by the hand. The only vendors available around the area was about three to four U.P folks settled in Goa making mouth watering Paani puri, SEv and Ragda. The visitors to these eateries were so few that they would know their clients by the face. A warm smile and a quick strike of conversation, we would relish the exotic snacks, yes at that time sev puri and paani puri seemed exotic compared to the daily rice and fish diet in Goa.We would play wholeheartedly making sand castles by the beach side or get into the sea, hopping and splashing in thigh high waters of the Arabian sea. But we would also play in the Beach play area, on the swings and sea saws, entering in and out the the Giant concrete fish which is still there. The only difference there was a water pond surrounding that fish. Once while all the kids were playing my three year old brother fell into the water, my older brother who was about ten jumped in to rescue him, my sister who was about nine jumped in two while the rest of us cried aloud for help. The little one was drowning. A restaurant owner Danny came and rescued all the three kids in the pond. My Dad then went and complained to the municipal authorities and the pond was dried out never to restore the water body again.There was also a maze built with cement walls. It was just like a real maze that had many deceptive entrances and exits. It was a roofless structure. Many kids would get lost in trying to follow the maze pattern. Some kids cried and that‚Äôs when people would know htat a kid is trapped inside. Soon the maze was demolished too.The local eateries which exist by the roadsides were only tiny houses, sometime small straw huts that were built by settlers who came mostly to extract toddy from coconuts by the beach side. It was a no man‚Äôs land, free of cost people built those little hutments, some of which are now huge, legal and commercial constructions.For two long months of summer vacation we frequented the Miramar Beach and never got tired of playing there. And then schools would start. When it rained heavily we got yet another opportunity to visit the beach, this time around with neighbouring ladies who would go and gather the wood and dry palm leaves that came sailing across through the sea current especially after an overnight‚Äôs heavy rain. The wood was made to last for fuel to cook food on fire almost until the end of the rainy season."
181,Average beach,This is one of the main attractions of Panjim area and is relatively cleaner than Baga or Calangute beaches.  No shacks and has lot of crows as you approach the shore from the road. No eating outlets or shacks on this beach
182,"Right in the Centre, Feels like Goa",The water was calm. We went to observe the sunset and it was stunning view.  However the beach was dirty with thrash everywhere as was the path to get there.
183,"Crowded, touristy beach ","Not much of a beach. its at the Estuary where the Mandovi river meets the sea, so the water is usually a little muddy. Not to mention that its right in the middle of the city of Panjim - so the water & the sand are not too clean. You can go for a stroll there, early mornings are the best time. Otherwise its pretty crowded. You have vendors crowding around the entrance, selling snacks and food - this results in a lot of little all over the place. If you are in the vicinity, drop in, but its not really worth the bother"
184,Less crowd but needs maintainence ,This beach lies on the Ho-Ho bus route and has on-going cruises by boat to see jumping Dolphin fish in sea. We too the half an hour trip and were actually able to see few dolphins. On boat there was loud music and dancing. A worthwhile trip.
185,Please give it a miss,"Considering other beaches outside Panjim, Miramar Beach appears less attractive and lacks the cleanliness.Just okay for a short visit in the morning or evening once."
186,Average ,"Though Goan beaches offer beautiful views from various vista points, Miramar beach is unique.  It is surrounded by residential area where most influential people live.  There is no permanent or temporary shack out here so limited foreign tourists & limited hawker vendors.  It is more suitable for local or visiting local crowd.  The nearby area has considerable vegetation.  Please avoid swimming out here as River Mandovi meets the Arabian sea nearby & the current is always strong.  Excellent sunset view option for city dwellers though.  It is a Shivaji park of Goa."
187,Visit on weekdays in the evenings,"lots of small eateries nearby , clean beach , morning sporting activity , especially during the monsoons make this beach a worth visit site in your tour of goa."
188,Stroll at Sunset is excellent,It is a very beautiful beach with many coconut trees at one end. It offers very lovely sunsets. One can sit for few hours and enjoy the scenery.
189,Not a clean beach..do not have any expectations with respect to other goa beaches,Too crowded as it's in the heart of the city. North Goa has much more beautiful beaches than Miramar.
190,Very nearer to panjim..,"Miramar beach is a 3 km away from Panjim, a beautiful view of the beach, long stretch of clean sand's."
191,Miramar beach,"There is a patch of trees giving shade from the heat near the beach. Had fresh coconuts and mango slices with the salty chilli lemon, delicious!"
192,Very Nice Beach,"Miramar beach is probably the most famly-oriented beach in Goa, be that it is located in the heart of the capital. It also is quite long and deep, with quite a walk before you get to the seaIts mostly clean and there are a lot of things to do around the beach. Some lovely restaurants, and a nice childrens park among themIf you like street food, would recommend that you definitely try the chats out  there which get served from around 6:30 pm or so. They are all made in the Bombay style and they are all lovely. I have always gorged on them"
193,Birthday evening,"Nice place to enjoy and full to spend time with friend, this is very near by panjim market like 10 minutes by bus ...."
194,Average Beach,"nice place to relax. Near to city, so no need to travel long distance to get to a beach. less crowded compared to other beaches in Goa. Parking available easily. Nearby place to visit is 'science park'. A good afternoon can be spent at these 2 locations."
195,Best Beach in North Goa,Close to city centre..good food available....convenient travel options to all the other tourist spots..
196,Nice Public Beach in Panjim,"The closest beach to Panaji is Miramar and is a must stop for most tourist visiting Panaji for shopping. At the entrance of the beach is the story of the fish Mira and a big waste basket for plastic and other scrap, the beach has soft sand and a lot of vendors selling stuff outside the beach, overall a nice beach for a morning or evening stroll."
197,Very clean beach,I don't think that I have ever seen a beach that has this much sand to walk across to get to the water.  Very fine sand at that.  The beach appears to be safe as there are lifeguards.
198,Nice Beach,Popular beach. Well laid interlock tiles as one approaches the beach. Sea was rough and the large number of beach goers were being closely monitored by the limited life guards.
199,Nice beach,"Miramar Beach is a beautiful place to enjoy what you wish, it could just be relaxing evening, a meditative morning, a beautiful walk at dawn or watching the sunset in the horizon at dusk.  Barges and boats outlines in the distant and the Mandovi river meets the sea merging and moving.  It's relatively clean and has a lot going on there.  Food stalls on the road heading to Donapaula... You must be there to find your groove and enjoy what you experience."
200,cool beach,"Situated at the confluence of the Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea, it is a small average beach. Nothing to see here .Just go and walk ,spend 10 to 20 minutes and return.no stalls of foods also.Some hindi movies are shoot here."
201,HOME BEACH,beach has a good view n good for walk or ball game in the sands. not good for play in water as it feels sticky and itchy. its in the city part and u can have good view of ships there.
202,beautiful sea & sunset view,"Biked about 25-30 km from the other side of Goa to run, spend time with locals early in the morning and catch the sunrise. All three of these are a rarity in Goa these days, considering how commercial and touristy most beaches have become. Miramar was a refreshing change."
203,Good place,Traveler tips : Best time to go is in morning. Good place for running or jogging or walk. Please carry water while visiting in morning. Miramar beach although not as popular as other beaches like Baga or Calangute is definitely more cleaner and you don't have to deal with hawkers every 5 minutes. This beach is in Panjim and is accessible by bus also. If you are into fitness then i would recommend visiting this place in morning for a walk/jog/run as many locals of Panjim also run on this beach.There is also a playground infront of the beach.
204,Goa Carnaval 2018,"Beautiful sea view,good place to visit,we ride bycycles on this beach,which is most wonderful experience"
205,Peaceful beach,"We visited Goa during the monsoon, when people are discouraged‚Äîeven outright forbidden‚Äîfrom even going into the water at all beaches. Just a couple of days before we landed in Goa, a group of five people, all of them drunk, had gone swimming and been drowned. So yes, if you‚Äôre going to Goa in the monsoon, leave those swimming trunks for your hotel pool!That said, one of Goa‚Äôs safest beaches is Miramar, which was only about fifteen minutes‚Äô leisurely walk from where we were staying, at the Vivanta by Taj. The road down to the beach is lined with huge, shady trees: rain trees, sea almonds, mango, tamarind and coconut. The road curves around in a semi-circle at Miramar, from where you walk a couple of hundred yards or so to get to the water. The beach curves around in a crescent, with groves of casuarina trees forming breaks on either side of this ‚Äòentrance‚Äô from the road to the beach itself. This not very wide stretch is where the tourists all seem to gather, so it‚Äôs crowded, and not very clean. The better bet is to head outwards to the side‚Äîjust a few dozen metres, and you can see the difference. We did that, and had lots of fun, finding seashells with our toddler, watching little sand crabs scuttling along, and generally being by ourselves. The life guards were very visible here. They kept patrolling in a jaunty red jeep, quickly ordering back to land any foolhardy tourists who went out too far. The life guard office is right next to the most popular section of the beach. There are various vendors along the beach, selling trinkets, fresh fruit, candy floss and the like: we bought a small pineapple, peeled and sliced, from one. Delicious and sweet, but probably priced (at Rs 50 per pineapple) too high for anybody but gullible (and eager) tourists."
206,Love this place,Swim at your own peril as a few hundred metres up river half a dozen huge floating casinos can be found with no one knowing where their waste water is going.
207,Ok beack.,"This beach is very close to capital panaji of goa.can be accessed by Wak, public transport or taxi .motorcycle pilot taxi is also available let in many parts of Goa. They charge min of rs 50 upto 2 kms. 5 his beach is close to city yet cool,calm and peaceful with viequal of rajasthan bhavan and fort aguada on the other. Confluence of river mandovI with Arabian sea can be felt. Seasonal fruits ,cut vegetables  and some toys ,balloons are available on beach.mineral water ,drinks and few snacks r available on  beach.risky to enter water.restaurants r close by.ideal beach for children and family bhel Puri stalls pao bhaji, faloodas available in evenings."
208,Lovely relaxing beach,The beach is centrally located with access from all round. Locals with families enjoy their evening on seashore. Beach is clean and attractive.
209,An ok experience,This is a much less crowded beach in Goa as compared to more popular beaches like Kalangoot and Baga. One would find more local people on the beach rather than tourists. The slope of the beach is very gentle so waves would not be that great. It‚Äôs a beach to enjoy for those who want to spend time in solitude in the midst of nature.
210,Just an Average Beach.,"Nothing too wow about this place but clean and scenic as beaches go... Stop if you are passing by, walk on the sand, try the snacks around."
211,Popular beach,We visited the on new year night.So many crackers fired here.we enjoyed here.Too much crowd.You can enjoy the sea shore.Beautiful lights n patakas is so amusing.
212,A usual beach. Nothing much exhilarating.,"Wasnt crowded during late afternoon, lots of shells unlike some of the other beaches in Goa. loved the time spent there, cleanliness needs to be worked upon"
213,Mirmar Beach Visit,"In case you can't get a chance to visit any other popular Goa beach, this can be an alternative. Nothing much than a small beach in Panjim city"
214,Nice simple beach,Its good to visit if you are going with a group or family. But if you are going alone or couples then its nothing like visiting. Noisy and crowded place.
215,vast miramar,Not much happening here. It seems like the beach is not really being maintained. Every time I visit it it seems to be going backwards.
216,Nice beach,it is a huge beach with open shore. here the shore area is huge unlike anjuna where shore area is too small
217,Worst horrible experience,"Clean and filled with soft sand, Miramar is quite a destination for evening walks and early morning strolls in Goa. It is  listed amongst the most popular beaches of Goa due to its location. Walk, swim and play on the sand ‚Äì thats something the locals as well as the tourists like to do at Miramar. Explore eating Goan food and cuisine in the local well-maintained eateries."
218,Better beaches not too far away,"During Goa visit i spend little time. it was little change then earlier. Now Mirama looks little busy. The cleaning part is concern, lots of traffic is near by. although a nice local beach at Panjim."
219,crowdy beach,Visited on a Sunday afternoon very crowded and lots of litter. Experience not helped by bus horns nearby.A couple of good food outlets on main road.Other beaches are better quality.
220,Surprisingly clean but not a lot going on,"Miramar Beach is beach in Panjim City,it's very decent and peaceful beach,once can enjoy beautiful sunset at the beach,the beach is good for kids and family , there are no rides offered here like Calungute & Baga Beaches.One can enjoy awesome street food at this beach."
221,Love the place,Not really for overseas tourists mainly for the local population. No beach bars restaurants or other essential amenities. For these you need to go further north on windy roads with lots of madcap traffic. All very Indian and great fun!
222,üòçüòçüòçüòç,"Well known beach of Panjim and tourist attraction. People come here , have a long surf walk , bathing in the waves of Arabian Sea , have fun of local eateries with bhel & panipuri. Nice and clean beach. Sometimes water at coast looks muddy, but while bathing inside it‚Äôs clean. Peaceful and njoyable."
223,Clean Beach,Miramar beach is one of the less explored beaches of Goa. It‚Äôs close to Panjim. Miramar is very neat and clean beach with less crowded. It‚Äôs a very nice place to enjoy.
224,"Clean, very less crowd, and no vendors",Excellent clean beach. Ideal for family trips. Good food options available nearby. Easy access. Safe slope.
225,Locals Mainly,"The beaches of Goa are all so beautiful and so it would be very unfair to praise one and leave out another. Miramar is again a beautiful one and enjoying the sand,sea n surf was indeed memorable."
226,Least crowded and ideal for an early morning run,The beach as such does not boast of anything exotic compared to other beaches in Goa. The so-called pine trees near the beach is just a patch. Wasn't clean either
227,The beach in Panaji city,"Beach is located in heart of city Panjim. very dirty beach plastic , bottles are found everywhere in beach. boat ride agents will follow you until your not shouting on them. absolutely not recommended."
228,Locals beach,"Meanwhile, the water is not clean. Garbage waste is also spread just a few distance towards the front of the center. But if you want to see dolphins, then the service of motorboat and steamer is available from this beach. Dolphins can be seen a few kilometers through the sea through them. Tourists often get a glimpse of the dolphin here.‡§á‡§∏ ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§æ‡§´ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ì‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§¶‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ç‡§°‡§º‡§æ ‡§ï‡§ö‡§∞‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§´‡•à‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§ø ‡§°‡•â‡§≤‡•ç‡§´‡§ø‡§® ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§∂ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§§‡•ã ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§∏‡•á ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§¨‡•ã‡§ü ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•á‡§µ‡§æ ‡§â‡§™‡§≤‡§¨‡•ç‡§ß ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§á‡§®‡§ï‡•á ‡§ú‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§≤‡•ã‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§°‡•â‡§≤‡•ç‡§´‡§ø‡§® ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç‡•§ ‡§Ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∏‡§∞ ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ü‡§ï‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§π‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§°‡•â‡§≤‡•ç‡§´‡§ø‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ù‡§≤‡§ï ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡•§"
229,huge beach near the centre of town,"Miramar is worst beach in Goa . Its dirty , Black color sand .No food available , Not good for beach activities, Its only Back waters."
230,Pretty sunset ,this is not typical goan beach.mo like the kapu bach or malpe beach in udupi.lazy and spread out.with lots of cut fresh fruits and ice creams available.
231,Unique beach,Beach was nice with lot of eating options available. You can enjoy at the fullest with family. Recommended to visit.
232,The city beach,In the heart of capital city of Goa.you will enjoy the walk on the beach ans also the sunset.very clean and you can enjoy the Indian belpuri.
233,Nice,"(Please read the whole article) Miramar Beach is one of the most famous beaches in Goa. It is a vast beach stretching from River Mandovi to the Arabian Sea at their confluence. Beaches are one of the most important venues to go and relax, sometimes even attain complete peace. Miramar beach is non the less. The NO. 1 activity I recommend that visitors must do, at least for a minimum of 2 minutes, is just close their eyes and listen to the the sound of the waves. It is also the ideal 'Sunset Point' in Panaji. But, due to pollution, this beach is loosing its glorious beauty. I request every one reading this article to not pollute Miramar Beach."
234,Beach near Panaji with an excellent view,"A short distance from Panjim bus stand, Miramar is the nearest and safest beach any traveler to Goa cannot miss. A visit late in the evening just before Sunset is perfect time to stroll along the beach. One can walk close to another scenic nearby place,  Dona Paula. Since it is close to the mouth of River Mandovi joining the Arabian Sea, on the other extreme side of the beach towards Caranzalem natural and other trash deposit is just a normal. On some days, if you are at the right time then one may catch the locals catch fish using a big net where the people buy fresh fish."
235,"A pleasant walk, but avoid the water",Miramar beach was our playground for beach football and beach volleyball during our school days. Good chaat street food to have kiosks of which are lined up along the road in evenings.
236,Blissful and serene beach,Visited Miramar beach with parents for a short walk in the morning.  Not much sand except at the main entrance side of the beach though. As compared to evenings the morning seemed less crowded with only people being the ones doing their morning walk or playing along the beach.
237,Loved it ,"Its good beach, we went to Dolphin view from here. Saw some tails of Dolphin and nice trip overall, if you are not going with sole purpose of watching Dolphin. I think no one will visit Goa for this beach."
238,Miramar Beach,We visited this beach for the first time this year even though we have been to goa two times in past. Its a short stretch of beach with a boating option available. This is like Juhu of mumbai. You will get to see plenty of food stalls selling chat items by the evening time on the beach road. My kids did not have a place to sit and play in the sand with sand activity toys but this beach has a place which is covered with tall trees which is very helpful when you want to take rest in shadow in a scorching heat time.You will get the sight seeing boating option here and we were also taken to the Dolphin point. It was very difficult to sight the dolphins since they hardly came on the top of the water and there are very few of them probably in the month of october. I believe there should be more in winter season. Finally we could see few of them and boat guy was patient enough to drive the boat in the direction of dolphin as soon as they were sighted. They also sell beer and soft drinks on the boat plus chips etc.You can always book the entire boat if you have a gang of people and also dance to the music on board.You have a lot of parking space on the beach road plus you do not have shacks like other beaches so be prepared with your basic food item on the beach if needed.I would suggest to take this  boat ride without fail and the cost is only 300 rupees per person.Give a thumb-up to this review if it helped you.
239,first impressions are misleading,"I went to Miramar Beach. Miramar Beach is listed amongst the most popular beaches of Goa¬†due to its location. Located in the Capital of Goa; it is very easily accessible by the tourists as well as the locals.¬†This beach is also a hot spot to celebrate local festivals. Clean, filled with soft sand; it is quite a destination for evening walks and early morning strolls. It is great place to go."
240,Not a patch on the other beaches ,"One of the most favourite and renowned tourist destinations in Goa. Apart from the beach, the boat rides,ferry taking you to see dolphins, the vendors hustling and bustling with activity and also the chat stalls all in a row that draw a lot of crowd in the evenings with their mouth watering snacks like samosa‚Äôs , bhel puri, paani puri,papdi chat, shawarma, wraps etc that make this a must visit destination.Dr.Javed Rasheed"
241,Good Beach,"Miramar isn't as commercialized as your usual beach, but has a different vibe. Close to the residential realm, the beach is warm and homely. Limited facilities for tourists who want to spend a couple of days experiencing the beach life. But for a lovely sunset with your loved one, it is a beautiful place."
242,Calm beach ,"Lovely beach, scenic view, avoid swimming here, take nice long walks. Get your camera ready to click the sunset view"
243,nice view,Serene beach. Enjoy the cool wind while sitting on the benches near the beach. Not so much of crowd. Other beaches have to offer more than Miramar.
244,Ok ok beach,"Miramar beach is on the way from Panjim town to Donapaula point. On a clear sky day, Sun set watching is good.  You can walk on Beach shore for about 3 kms. At Miramar beach point, the sea is not very good for bathing - you can sit and watch the sea.Plenty of town buses are available from Busstand to this point. Just about 3 kms from market and 3 kms from Donapaula. Many restaurants near by - Food Land, Cafe coffeeday, ITC Fortune hotel and many more. Hanuman temple is just opposite."
245,Disappointing,Miramar beach is comparatively less crowded than Calungute and Bagha. Boat ride is available from the beach. mostly local crowd
246,Not worth it for us,Heard good things about this beach...We visited n walked around 30 minutes..Just ok... There were no activities.. may be in Aug we should not visit
247,Not the best beach,Avoid going there as this is crowded place and can be avoided. You have lot more other things to do then to visit this place.
248,Lovely beach.,"Went to Miramar Beach with lot of hopes. Shocked to see the garbage around the shore. Not a good place to enjoy. Lot of stray dogs in the beach, interestingly all beaches in Goa are infested with stray dogs."
249,Not a Nice Beach,"We took a Dolphin boat ride here in the evening and it was a awesome experience to watch the Sunset, Dolphins and a great music to enjoy the ride."
250,Clean beach,Water Quality is not fit to Swim ....water sports not available at this location....but ...sunset view and breeze can be enjoyed....
251,Avoid,Miramar beach will always remain close to my heart. The best time to go to this beach is early morning or during the evening.
252,nice beach,This is a must visit beach..Quiet beach.. not very crowded..Do visit if u r near panjim..This beach is exceptional in its own way.. sand is so beautiful..The beach does not have bars and restaurants..Its natural beauty.. natural air.. and the pure sea..Go and Enjoy beauty in its purest form..
253,Just another beach,Well organised. Citizens actively involved in organising the event. One rare event where all participants enjoy without exception.
254,Walk on the beach,Long walk to beach access from main road.Array of trees along the beach during sunset makes a good photospot.
255,Miramar Beach,"We have visited this place with family on 23 jan 2018.Beach was clean.But we have booked boat ride which costs 300 per person.When we have entered into the boat music was going on but after 30 mins when the boat started finally they played worst loud music.That sound was not bearable for me and my family and some other people also.me and my family told them to lower the sound.But they have ignored us for whole trip and continued with their foolish behavior.They were selling beers and other things.some people were drinking that beer and dancing in front of small children.I was riding with my parents who are senior citizens,my uncle and my brother.Today i realize there is no humanity exist.What kind of image we are giving to our children and many travlers.We are not cheap category but because of these cheap people our country loosing its name.I was really thinking to call police at that time but there are other people also who were facing this problem and they were ok for that suffering.I will not at all recommend that boat ride to anyone except some men and women who like to drink and dance can surey go there and enjoy.But not for well mannered people."
256,Simultaneous people and sunset watching,"Miramar beach is a nice place to watch the sunset in the evenings, although it does get a bit crowded at that time. It's pretty nice in the mornings as well and sometimes you can even see dolphins if you go early enough.The water is too rough to swim in though, and sometimes before the monsoons the sea gets filled with jellyfish. Good beach for early morning walks."
257,Very neat and clean ,"There is a line of nearly 20 carts on wheels selling a very popular cuisine called chaat. Choose from Pani puri, ragada pattice, bhel puri, sev batata puri, Pao bhai.....all available from 6 PM to 10.00pmopposite the chaat sellers you can find a place that sells some goan delicacies like cutlet bread, chourice pao, croquet, potato chips and a host of other stuff.a few coffee houses in the area as well. perfect cup & cafe coffee day."
258,Good view of the sunset,Miramar Beach has now been converted to a place for an evening snack. Carts of Bhel puri and other nick nacks including ice cream is available here. It does get crowded in the evening suggest leaving yr handbag at home and carrrying a carousel.
259,Beach Mara mar,Be aware that there are no deck chairs or umbrellas of any sort for shade just a long sandy beach with no cover. There is a bit of woodland to seek some shade in. Otherwise quite pleasant as it is a local‚Äôs beach and has a non tourist ambiance.
260,City beach,This beach is just like a other beaches of Goa but still it's have it's own identity.It's near by road too.
261,Beautiful sandy beach...,Miramar beach is by far one of the worst beaches in Goa. Avoid it as far as possible. Enjoy the roadside vendors though.
262,Most Popular Beach,"Sandy Beach which is Nice. Medium in cleanness. But as a foreigner teenage Girl its to much, people ask to take fotos with you All the time. Stares and are uncomftable, eventhough we had covered our bodies in long clothes."
263,Too crowded,It was unfortunate to see the condition of this beach where lot of dirt and other items were lying on the beach.Due to lot od pollution in the water the beach water has turned black and even you will not like to dip your feet in the water.Some should be done to remorse the loose sand from road to the beach. Some plantation should be done.It is better to avoid this beach if you are visiting beach at Goa.
264,Good Beach,"Less crowded beach where Mandovi river joins Arabian Sea. Water is not that clear, may be because of the river joining. If you use binoculars and little patient you may be lucky enough to spot Dolphins towards the river."
265,Peaceful Beach of Goa,Lovely place to spend hours with your loved one. Sunset view is just awesome on this beach. Must go place.
266,Not too crowded beach,Too dirty. Unpleasant. Don't know y cab driver suggested us to see it.I am wondering y it's 3.5 star rated averaging on trip advisor
267,Lot of food stalls- good to chill out in the evenings,If you would like to go to a simple beach to relax then this is for you. There is a boat ride and members who will take your picture for Rs 50. The beach is clean which is nice.
268,One of the goa beach,The light house is seen from a distance and offers good n serene view at night. Good and pleasant experience as it is not crowded
269,vacation,Miramar beach is nearly 4 kms from Panjim and part of this capital city of Goa.beautiful beach. Lot of people visit this beach in the eve. But not very crowded.The view of sun set at this beach is amazing.parking may be a problem if reaching late.But no water sports here.
270,Ever popular,It's really awesome beach silent. You can do sun bath .near to beach so many street food stall. It's really good experience. Must be there till sunset. You will enjoy nature
271,Not much to see,"we were staying close by so went there Average beach, not much options for food Visit only if nearby otherwise avoid"
272,Clean beach in panjim,"Miramar beach is one of the most popular beaches of Goa due to its location and accessibility. Situated at the confluence of the Mandovi River & the Arabian Sea and located in the Capital of Goa, it is very easily accessible by the tourists as well as the locals.This beach is also a hot spot to celebrate local festivals. It is quite a destination for evening walks and early morning strolls. It is a locals beach so there is nothing much on the beach itself as far as water sports activities are concerned. Local shops exist here, but sell nothing exotic. If you wish to buy something  good, then you have to walk to the main market of Panjim. The Panjim bus stand is just 3kms from the beach. It takes only 15 minutes to reach the beach by bus."
273,nice beach,Morng time spend on this beach is attractive with children and scinic beauty is nice and enjoy a lot taking snap
274,Miramar Beach~ Offering north Indian Chaath.,"Miramar Beach is a one of the famous beaches of Goa. This beach is at Panjim Capital of Goa. People can take Cruse Ride, shopping etc. Food stall is also available at this place."
275,best beach at panaji,A must visit place in Goa to ensure you get a taste of Goan heritage. A bit crowded in the afternoons especially on weekends. So try avoid it. Parking nearby is a major issue. Lots of shops have made this place crowded
276,Beautiful beach in Panjim city,"It is in the city of panaji,easy to access and  reach excellent view, location is of awesome scenery,pics are also good"
277,A Favourite tourist attraction ,"Heya, so it was a vacation type time as I roamed, sat and got lost in the music of the waves of the beach.As i was staying in Marriott Goa(you can read my previous review about the hotel), the beach is just a 4 feet wall climb away.As I sat alone, the cruise, the mini ships were passing by which makes a great view,the sound of the waves made me go deep into my self.To Do: Do check out the cruise which roams in the vicinity only, the music can be heard from a distance also."
278,Nice place,...didn't find anything special there. It was part of the package that we negotiated with a greedy auto driver we found in front of the Church of Immaculate conception.
279,Nice beach,I would rather suggest beaches in north and south goa (not Baga and Calangute). Not worth it if you are in goa.
280,Very neat and clean beach,Nice place to visit for spending good time.Sunset seen from this place was awesome.At end of o e side u can see cruise going in sea.
281,Heart touching beach which invites evreyday presence for a long spell,"Amazing place to see the sunset, just beware of jellyfish stranded on the shore. Locals as well as tourists frequent this beach and if you're lucky you may even get to see religious ceremonies at sunrise or sunset."
282,Average beach,"It was a rushed visit, early in the morning. The beach was clean, uncluttered, unlittered and free of crowds except for a few young people with kids. No one paid the slightest attention to the others as they took selfies and waded in the water.Goat's foot flowers carpeted part of the sandy approach to the beach as we walked from where out auto (tuktuk) ad parked to where the waves were. These plants stabilize the sand. There is a restaurant attached...just a few steps from the pavement. It opens at around noon...so if we had time to spend a whole day at the beach maybe we would have had a leisurely lunch here and waited it out as the fiery sun went westwards before I came back to enjoy the evening on the beach. No many seabirds...but lots of crows!"
283,Very dirty beach ,"Not impressive,not well maintained,no facilities around.With the drop in tourist traffic in Goa in recent days,it is time for introspection."
284,Pleasant beach,"Went to this place for a morning walk - and the atmosphere was refreshing . Perhaps due to the lack of crowds, the trees, and the beautiful coastline , even this urban beach looked peaceful and tranquil ... Worth a visit if you are in Panjim or in any other place in Central Goa ..."
285,Awesome water,"Located at Prime spot, in the heart of Panjim. Very Clean & well maintained. many activities carried out - Carnivals, IFFI etc"
286,Nice beach,"What might have been a peaceful beach years ago is now an overcrowded place where one can enjoy the sunset if one wants but it‚Äôs not a relaxing experience in my opinion. The beach is dirty, strewn with plastics and the chowpatty nearby doesnt help. Hopefully people stop using and throwing single use plastic here."
287,Nice beach in the middle of the city ,"We arrived in the morning at the circle, quite a long walk through the sand to the sea.  No shacks, chairs nor umbrellas, no shade.  Not for us.  It‚Äôs just an empty beach.  Apparently it‚Äôs worth an evening visit to watch the sunset and partake of the local food stalls."
288,sunset beach,"I wasn't impressed.  Compared to other beaches, I though Miramar left a bit to be desired.  Crowded, dirty and without the fine white sand that other beaches in Goa have.  Main advantage may be its proximity to Panjim City."
289,Average beach,"Miramar is a short drive from heart of Panjim, and has been well developed over the years. The beach is a nice place for a cool walk, with the soothing sound of the waves. Pretty long and generally very calm. The road to the beach and alongside has several nice restaurants and pubs. If you are staying in Panjim, this is an easily accessible beach for quick dips."
290,Very beautiful beach,"Sunrise, sunset, a walk, football, cricket, a jog, fishing - you name it & Miramar has place for all. Locals, domestic tourist - space for everyone. Food stalls - Chaats, Shawarma all available there. Enough parking space. Children's play area."
291,beachy day,"Nice beach. But a lot of plastic thrown around and a lot of stray dogs doesn't make the mood. On a good side, a family can definitely enjoy the tides as they are not bigger than other beaches."
292,Sunset stroll here,too much crowd as local people and tourist both go there as in mid loccation of city also.must go place
293,Food - Fun - Sunset & Too much Crowd,"Nearest beach located in Panjim city  just 4 kms from bus stand. Bus charge just Rs 10/.  Sundays & holidays evening more rush & there are small toys etc are sole by petty sellers. Eatables are available @ entrance road side.Not much rush always till evening, U can enjoy alone the pieceful beach in the morning & sit leisurely to enjoy."
294,nice beach,"I was surprised to see so much rubbish along the beach.  To be fair there appeared to be people picking it up in the morning, but it certainly isn't a beach you would want to sunbathe or relax on."
295,Kite flyers beach..,"We visited this beach for a short while. Having our car's auto alarm went off on its own, we were embarrassed as well at the location. :D"
296,"peaceful, serene and reasonably clean beach .",Superb beach.....coming here right from my childhood days.....it's wonderful ...jus wowwwwwwwww. Pani Puri is tastyyyyy yum yum
297,Less Crowded and not at all happening,"It was another evening spent in Goa amidst water sports and leisurely walks on the shores with the waves around us. Though, the beach was not to our expectations."
298,Visit only if you cant visit any othe Goa beach,Such a nice combination     monsoon pouring on sea   overcast sky       warm bhutta   tea and pao and kababs    this is a safe beach with all the  safety and you can enjoy the experience
299,Nice View,"Miramar is the beach area of the Goan capital of Panjim, also known as Panaji and is one of the most visited beaches of Goa. It is one of the two only beaches in Panjim, other being Caranzalem beach . Many people, mostly tourists, come to this beach every day. You can also go for Dolphin curise from this beach, other option being from Coco Beach. Situated at the confluence of the Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea, it is a small beach that occasionally hosts some events. There are several educational institutions in the surrounding vicinity and a popular caf√© are nearby"
