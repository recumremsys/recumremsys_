0,Great tour guides,"The tours we attended were very interesting and the guide was very good. We attended the ""Behind Bars"" tour and the ""Convict Prison"" Tours. Good for children 8-10 years old"
1,Another great visit ,"I did the behind bars tour and it was fantastic. Our tour guide was full on information and you could tell that he was passionate about his job, he had fascinating stories that kept the tour interesting. Highly recommend if you’re in Fremantle."
2,Mind blowing,We did two of the tours offers. Our guide was very informative and had a fabulous personality. Found the whole experience great and learnt a lot
3,Definitely well worth a visit,"we (4 adults) did the Behind Bars tour, and loved it. Matthew was a fantastic tour guide, very knowledgable and happy to answer any/all questions. unfortuneately didnt have time for a second tour, but cant wait to get back there."
4,Fremantle may be dying but the Fremantle Prison isn't!,"My teen enjoyed the behind the bars tour. The guide was great and very knowledgeable. He gave us a good glimpse of life in prison and we were able to view various parts of thr prison including the cells. I personally found the room where hangings were carried out quite confronting, and was glad that we hadn't come when the kids were little as it would have frightened them then. The guide did warn us beforehand and there was the option of skipping that room. I wish there had been warnings before signing up for the tour. The tour is informative and a unique experience ... I should probably have realised that prison tours would be a tad dark and depressing."
5,Afternoon Guided tour,"My partner and I did two tours, the Behind Bars Tour with guide Sarah, who was very informative and a gem to listen to.  She had a few amazing stories about the prison and the prisoners and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the tour .  The second tour we did was the Tunnel Tours underground, this was absolutely amazing, if you want to do something different this is the one to do....our guide was Debbie and she was awesome, very informative and knowledgeable about the tunnels. There was never a dull moment loved every bit of it.  Very interesting and can be a bit scary if you don't like heights and confined spaces but my partner and I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely do it again."
6,Tour Excellent but Guide Poor,"My girlfriend and I did the Behind the bars Tour and we really loved it. Our guide James was great, super enthusiastic and well knowledgeable. We would highly recommend this Tour."
7,Well worth a visit.,"We did the convict tour and it was a great experience. The tour guide was well prepared, the place is extremely interesting and we learn a lot of things about Australia."
8,So much misery,"Came here and did the convict guided tour and it was so informative, we learnt a lot from the tour guide, so glad we went on it! It’s definitely worth a visit and attending a tour"
9,Extremely informative jail tour,"We did the night time torch tour and it was fantastic!! We had Simon as a tour guide and he was so freaking funny.  I had tears streaming down my face for most of the night in between the occasional screams.  There was so much fascinating history and it was such a great way to learn about some of WAs history. Highly, highly recommend this tour.  I did it with my 10 year old and he loved it, but he loves history and prisons."
10,Interesting and informative tour,"We had a great time at the tunnel tour! Our guide, Sarah was friendly, knowledgeable and a great story teller. She made sure we felt safe all the time! Would recommend everyone to do the prison tour with the tunnel tour."
11,Tunnels and Prison Tour,"We were part of a large tour group when we visited the prison. We had a wonderful time visiting cells, yards, execution chamber and chapel but our group was too large making it a little squeeze at some locations. The prison is well worth the visit and hard to believe it was used not that long ago. Our guide was fantastic, she knew so much about the site, the stories and resident ghosts."
12,Very informative,We joined the behind bars tour.  Very informative and interesting.  Our tour guide gave us vivid image of how life was behind the bars esp in the old days.  Highly recommended
13,Very informative tour with Jane for such a famous prison!,We did the behind bars tour as it was pram friendly with bubs. It was an interesting look into the later history of the prison.I would have liked more written information on day to day life from prisoners and guards on signs to read as the tour is going on. As it was a large group it was sometimes hard to hear and so this would have been a good way to get more information. If you are taking a baby or toddler the majority of the tour is flat with only a couple of steps in door ways to lift the pram over.
14,Best time in the tunnels,"I booked 2 tours at the Prison.  I did the Convict tour and the Behind Bars Tour.  Both tours were very interesting.  A lot of facts.  I learnt about some of the convicts.  Also, the behind bars tour went to the hanging area but you dont have to go in.  You can wait outside.  If you dont take any tours you can go to see the interesting displays inside the courtyard.  I would recommend visiting the jail to anyone.  However, on the convict tour it is not suitable for strollers because we use the stairs.  The convict tour goes outside alot and there is not much shade  just a heads up."
15,Tour of the Prison,I did the true crime tour after a friend recommended it to me. I really enjoyed the experience. The tour was unique as I got to hear some pretty thrilling stories. The tour guide was very passionate in his role. He helped me paint a vivid picture of the stories he was telling. Prices were pretty reasonable. I hope to come back and do the other tours some day.
16,I think this has to be a must for those visiting Fremantle,"Recently my daughter and I joined the Behind the Bars tour. The tour itself was excellent, I love history and was excited to wander around such an historical site. Unfortunately the guide was awful making endless innuendos about prisoners using lubricants and soaps. Then he made a remark that the only difference between guards and prisoners was the uniforms. I have 2 brothers who are prison officers and find those remarks offensive. Persons leading such tours should stick to historical facts and not add their own options."
17,Prison Tour,Attended the Fremantle Prison Torchlight Tour and it was a great experience. Our tour guide was brilliant - managed to tell the stories in a way that was very creepy and spooky but not overly scary. Was nice to touch on the history of the prison but this tour does focus on the more gruesome and scary stories.
18,Well worth a visit!,"We took the 'Triple Header' (all three tours)  and somehow had the same guide Steven.Steven was great, as I imagine all other staff would be. He totally knew his stuff and you couldn't stump him him.It wasn't as depressing as I thought it would be, but I  wouldn't change places with the inmatesThe only photos I took was of the art, which was an unexpected gemWorth the time and $"
19,Very interesting,"We went for the true crime tour. The stories shared by the guide were interesting.The stories were shared at different locations in the prison, so it was quite a good tour of the place too.The free area was also quite interesting."
20,Convict Tour,"Interesting place to visit w did the behind bars tour and it was very good; our tour guide James, was extremely knowledgeable and gave some funny stories; he says that they have a church there and that it was consecrated which means you can legally get married... enough said about that sentence. recommend if you’re in Fremantle."
21,Great tour with lots of local history ,This is definitely worth a visit. The tour was great. Really interesting and the guide we had was great. Good and interesting way to learn Australian history. Highly recommend this tour for any age group.
22,Convicts Tour,I did the one hour tour which was enough. The guide had some great stories.Glad I did it. I turned up just as it opened to get tickets and by the time I left it was very busy.
23,Recommended ,We did the True Crimes tour and it was very interesting. It was not only a tour of the jail but also about some of the prisoners who were housed there. Our guide was fabulous and made the tour very interactive and hands on. A great place to visit but felt a bit eerie at times. Well worth the visit.
24,Late night is best,"I believe there are 5 different tours, each with an experienced guide. We had an historic tour which was well presented and facinating. There is so much to see and hear about. Our tour tokk over 90 mins and was worthevery cent. There is a cafe in the prison grounds which is good. The whole thing was very well organised and a crdit to the volunteers."
25,Hoilday,"We took 2No tours ,Behind Bars and True Crime.Both tour guides were excellent in their delivery and content.We would definitely recommend this as a great insight into WA’s criminal past."
26,Great piece of history,Toured the prison today. Brett was leading our tour. He was very informative and everyone held onto every word he said. While we know the prison was awful... Brett leading the tour was enjoyable. We are so glad we went.
27,Fremantle prison,"We visited here and did the convict tour which was fantastic!! It went for a little over an hour and we got to see inside the prison, the cells, the different rooms and churches, the back area for punishment and here all about the stories from when it was built, with modern day tales woven in for good measure! Absolutely loved our trip and highly recommend it!"
28,Fremantle Prison,"The prison was grwat to look around, we completed two of the three available tours and the guide was excellent. Highly recommend."
29,Must visit Fremantle Prison,"We visited the prison for a torch light tour which was recommended by by our family and it did not disappoint, the roll play of the guides were an added special addition along with the historic interest of the prison, you will get to see and feel the obvious pain and suffering those convicts went through over the years, it's a must visit when you are in fremantle and you can also visit through the day go there and have a treat."
30,Must do prison tour in Fremantle ,"My partner and I took part in the tunnels tour and the Behind the bars tour. We loved both and recommend them, however keep in mind the tunnels tour does require a moderate to high level of fitness as you will be climbing down and up 3 storeys of ladders (harder than you think!) We loved the tour guides and think both tours were bargains for what we experienced"
31,A very interesting insight.,The tunnel tour was amazing!We had a great tour guide Jamze who was knowledgeable about the history and was such a friendly guy Would recommend 100%
32,Simon our Tour Guide,The tunnel tour was awesome. Our guide Sam was brilliant - friendly and informative and we experienced a real slice of Aussie history. We had a great time shunting our boats through subterranean tunnels and when the lights went out....Cockroach corner was another highlight. Highly recommended for the adventurous and those who just want something that little bit different and very memorable.
33,Behind the bars,"I was so impressed with the night tour that I went on a day tour, titled ‘True Crime’The tour guides are well trained/knowledgeable. The cashiers are friendly & very helpful. They have a gr8 cafe to chillax before & or after & they have a wonderful souvenir store which has an abundance of different items to choose from @ reasonable prices. Ohh how I thoroughly enjoyed my time here!!My heartfelt thanks to all the staff!!"
34,Freo prison ghost tour,I loved the guided  tour it was so informative with a  little humour too !! I took the afternoon tour but there are night tours too and I believe a tunnel tour which I haven't tried yet !!
35,Fantastic place to visit!!!,We did the convict tour which was very interesting. Our guide had a grea5 knowledge of everything that was asked of her and she gave a great commentary right throughout the tour. Thoroughly recommend.
36,different types of tours,"We visited today with our two children (8 & 5). We did the ""Behind Bars"" tour which took us through most of the prison including the gallows. Our tour guide, Brett, was excellent and had a way of explaining some of the darker sides of the prison in a way that the adults would…"
37,Fremantle Prison vidit,So sad to be confronted with the terrible conditions.We did the Convict Tour.The guide was wonderful.
38,Interesting and informative tour,We did the torchlight tour and it was a very interesting experience. There’s a lot of history in the prison and some really interesting stories. A couple of cameos by “prisoners” were a very great touch to give you a feel of their personal story. Guide was very knowledgeable and answered any questions.
39,The tunnels tour is a must,Took the basic tour and was shown around by a very enthusiastic guide. Lots of information to take in. Tales of some of the former inmates was particularly interesting.
40,Underground tunnel tour was fun & interesting!,"Very interesting tour and a World Heritage Site!  Our guide, James, was extremely knowledgeable and made it fun."
41,Fantastic tour of a Freemantle Landmark.,"We were told by some locals that the tunnel tour was fascinating, and they were right!  Amazing tour & history of the prison and how it started and has changed over the decades, and how the prisoners dug these underground tunnels to supply water to the prison and eventually the City of Fremantle and how instrumental the water was to the development of Fremantle."
42,Convict Tour,Very interesting tour .The guide was very informative. You came away knowing everything about the prison & how it was run.
43,Halloween tour,"I have completed 3 tunnel tours and they are fantastic. This time my brother and I did the triple prison tour and would highly recommend this. Our guides were Danny, James and Chris.The tours were ""convict prison,"" ""behind bars "" and ""true crime.""The guides are knowledgeable and help to bring history alive.It was a very hot day for our tour and there  is a lot of standing around especially on the true crime tour which was quite exhausting. A great place to visit when in Western Australia...not to be missed."
44,Spooky night tour,"Fantastic experience. Great tour, very informative. Thanks to Debra our tour guide.  She was great. Really interesting tour, highly recommended."
45,Tunnels tour - Excellent,We had Chris for our True Crime Tour and Janine for our Torch Light tour which were both really good and worth doing. The True Crime tour talks about crimes committed but does not go in to too much detail and therefore is not gross. If you want to hear more about the Claremont case I can recommend the Crime Junkie pod cast which has an episode on the case... This does however go in to a fair amount of detail and would not be recommended for under 16s. The Torch Light tour is good and a very different experience again. A little scary at times but great fun and interesting history on the place.
46,"Great tour, very knowledgeable guide",We took the “True Crime” and “Convict” tours. Both were Super interesting and left us wanting to take the other tours too
47,Must see if a history buff,"I would highly recommend the ‘Behind Bars’ tour. Our tour guid Jane was very knowledgeable, my girlfriend and I really enjoyed it. Thanks Jane 😊👍"
48,"""Behind Bars"" --A Great Tour",We did two tours of the prison “the true crimes and “behind bars” tours. Both were fascinating. Was great to hear stories of inmates from over the years and have a good look around the prison at various sections including the gallows. For both tours we had Simon and he was a great story teller and very knowledgeable. He also makes jokes about people on our tour which kept every body involved. From memory the tour was $22 but the 2nd was only $10 each. Great value. Defiantly worth visiting when in freo.
49,Tunnel Tour,"The family did a guided tour of the prison. The guide was a former prison officer and provided a great insight to the prison,The architecture is stunning but daunting at the same time. The kids really enjoyed the tour and even wanted to see the gallows.It would have been a scary place to have visited 30 years ago.Recommended as a family activity"
50,Fantastic place to visit,"Excellent tour, our guide, Simon was very engaging and entertaining. He was so knowledgeable and made the tour fun and interesting. I highly recommend this tour."
51,Amazing tour.,"We visited Fremantle Prison while on holiday and decided to take some tours. The modern era tour was fascinated after realizing this prison operated until the 1990's amidst the almost medieval setting. The original buildings were built during the English convict era and are very crude. Our guide walked us through the intake area, kitchen, exercise yards, and cell blocks. After this tour we waited a few moments to start the English convict era tour. This was equally interesting learning about the lives of the convicts who built not only the prison but many other construction projects in Fremantle and WA. The tours are somewhat similar and the guide struggled to keep a banter as the guests from previous tour had much of the general prisons history already but did an admirable job. In hindsight I would have did our tours in the reverse order to keep the history timeline intact.The gallery has a grim exhibition about the conditions that led to several infamous riots in the modern era.  All things considered a very good attraction."
52,Well Worth It,Great tours of the Prison. We went on the convict tour and the behind the scenes tour. My 6 year old was enthralled for the whole time on both tours. All the tours offer something different and you do not go over the same things.
53,A well worth Tour,We went in early May so effectively out of season. We had a very friendly and informative guide on a one to one basis. The overall trip lasted about 2 hours and delved not only into the history of the prison but into the late social history of WAThe café served the largest Florentine I have ever seen
54,Tunnel tour ,"We had the 6.30pm torchlight tour and had Janine as our tour guide. She was great, had plenty of good stories and had us on our toes for the whole trip. Spooky fun!"
55,Prison Tunnel Tour,Our guide was very informative and was able to answer questions.  This guided tour really helps you to get an understanding of what life was like as an inmate.
56,Holiday,"Awesome time exploring the Freemantle Prison and learning its history. We did the prisoner history tour and our guide, James, was captivating with his history / story telling. The tunnel tour also did not disappoint with our guide whos name escapes me was hilarious and had us laughing and at ease throughout the time deep underground. Would definitely recommend."
57,Insight into later prison life,Took the “true crimes” tour with Karl. It was super interesting and great to see the prison!!! Well worth a visit.
58,Interesting ,"Behind the Bars tour was captivating. Janeen the tour guide was fantastic. Although I’m a local, it was my first visit. My memories of this prison was just driving past most days, not realising the saddest and poorest conditions the prisoners experienced. The stories told and the history are remarkable. Also completed a tunnel tour. What a surprise to see how these were created all those years ago."
59,Very interesting,"We took prison tunnel tour and it was very adventurous. The tour leader was very knowledgable. 20 meters down below the prison, and walk through the tunnel with a bit of head down might be too hard for people with heart problem. We have to pass the breathalizer before we're allowed to go down the tunnel. So for those of you who just been drinking around the pier, dont take this tunnel tour. But very interesting history about the tunnel."
60,Must See when going to Fremantle,We went on the basic tour which gave a excellent flavour of the life of the convicts. You get to feel what it was really like.
61,Fremantle Prison,"We did the candlelight tour, it was actually a torch tour though and we got to take the tiny torches home. The guide was a great storyteller and the tour was very spooky and cool, afterhours cells and solitary confinements and execution chambers are very very eerie. There were many cockroaches in the prison kitchen which added to the spookiness."
62,Interesting,The prison offer various tours depending on your level of interest.Our tour was very interesting and gave a great flavour of what life would have been like in the prison. Rather them than me!I would highly recommend the tours.
63,Very Interesting,We did the convicts tour and the prisoners tour as a combined ticket for $64. All took around 2 and half hours in total. Fascinating insight into how tough life was here. The guides have a good sense of humour and answer questions enthusiastically.
64,Behind the bars tour,"Well worth a visit. Our guide, Leah, was very entertaining and knowledgeable and the whole experience was suitable for adults and my 9 year old Daughter. Thoroughly recommended."
65,Torch tour,"I had the chance to do the four tours in one day and they were all as interesting as each other. I even got to have my own personal minder who made sure I got from tour to tour on time and not miss out on anything!!Each guide was so passionate and knowledgeable about what they were discussing. So much history but they didn't skimp on giving the most explicit of information. Each time I moved from group to group, the momentum of experience and attention to details did not diminish.I got to experience these tours with 4 very different groups of people and at no stage was anyone left out. Each guide made sure to allow each person ask questions but to also get them involved in the tour topics. At no stage did any of them falter with an answer and they each had their own quirks that made it such a great experience. Even the kids get a chance to be a part of the action. If you have a chance to make this a day out, do it!! I arrived at about 12pm and walked out the gates at 6pm and at no stage did I want to leave, look at my watch or want to be anywhere else. It was an amazing day out. Thank you to all the employees that made it a great day. I will be back to do the night tour for sure!!"
66,Worthwhile ,Simon was our tour guide and he made the experience really enjoyable for myself and our friends that had come over from the UK.  Thank you
67,A must vist in Freemantle,We loved our trip to Fremantle prison. We did 2 tours (true crimes & convict prison) but if we had more time would have loved to do more! Our tour guides Justin and Ian were full of facts and knowledge and made the trip really interesting. We would recommend to anyone visiting Perth.
68,Prison tour with kids ,"I went for a prison tour in October. The Tour guide was really well into his subject of Fremantle Prison, We went on an extensive tour including the Church chapels and the inescapable cell, and the flogging area, and he gave a very interesting commentary. As it was the last tour of the day i went to the cafe and had a coffee and cookie, then had a look at the exhibits on show. This was also wonderful! Highly recommended!"
69,Must see if you are in Fremantle ,"My wife and I did 2 tours, the Ghost Night Tour and the Art Tour (which occurs only a few times a year). My sister-in-law also did 2 other tours as well. I have done a few prison tours in different states and countries and this was one of the best. We were lucky we had Janine for both of our tours and she is a delight, as well as being able to tell good stories. It is an amazing building considering its age - amazing in it s preservation and size. This site is a credit to those who brought it back to life. If you see the opportunity to do an art tour - jump at it. The gaol has a variety of art that has been preserved, but this also art that is out in the open that can't be saved. Complicated story - but the guides will explain it. See this art before it disappears. Learn about the artists who are amazing characters. There is also an art gallery on site with art made by current inmates of other prisons. Well worth a look at."
70,Great Insight into the History of Fremantle,"My daughter and I did the tunnel tour during the day and came back for the night tour. The tunnel tour was amazing! A good guide kept up informed and well versed in all the safety requirements to complete this tour. Definitely not one for those who don't like heights or climbing or are not steady on your feet. You are hooked up to a harness and descend via a series of metal ladders underground. A bit of hunched walking and then off in small 2 manned wooden boats to paddle your way through the tunnels. Again, if you don't like the dark or being confined, this is not for you!! If you're of average fitness and enjoy new experiences, this is good fun. The tour guide stopped along the way to give up lots of information about the history of the prison and the tunnels.The night tour was also good fun. Our tour guide was really entertaining and full of stories about the prison and its previous inmates. Lots of jumpy, creepy stuff along the way! There was no overlap of information so you really enjoyed them as two fully separate experiences."
71,"Well worth having a look around, strongly recommend!",We decided to do the triple tour as we had the time and wanted to know a lot more of the history of this place. Our tour guides were very knowledgable about it's history and entertaining with many stories...many quite awful as you could imagine from a prison tour. It pays to wear a hat on a hot day as a bit of time is spent outside.
72,Do the crime do the time,"Took me 10 years to make it to the tunnel tours and it did not disappoint. We had an amazing time. Courtney was our tour guide, she was knowledgeable and hillarious. We couldn't have had a better experience. It was so much fun."
73,Did tunnel tour,Went on the true crime tour the guide by the name of Ian was great and very informative! Would recommend this tour!
74,Fremantle prison tunnel tour,"We visited the prison in December and booked onto the Behind the Bars tour. We had our 9 and 5 year old children with us and they were fine and really enjoyed it. The 9 year old got a little upset when we visited the hanging section but you have the option to wait outside.Really informative tour guide, not at all gimmicky just factual and really interesting. We had a great time and really enjoyed looking around and getting a sense of what it was like to be locked away there. I did the night tour on my last visit in 2006 and really enjoyed that too but not one for the kids!"
75,More to it than I ever imagined,"This is one of the most interesting tours I have ever been in.  The tour guide, Janine, was fascinating to listen to, and very informative.  What an amazing story of crime and punishment.From Perth you can take a trip down the Swan River in a combined tour, or you can catch the train.  Fremantle has a lot to recommend it with a wonderful collection of heritage sites."
76,Interesting tours,"We went on the true crime tour on a wet and windy day in October! When you arrive you can see the different tour start times, which is a good touch. We booked onto the next one which started in 15 mins, they were all staggered so the wait shouldn't be too long. The tour guide was good and knew his stuff for sure and he tailored the tour to keep us inside as the weather wasn't great. We did notice that non-english speaking guests were left with an audio device and not alot of guidance to what they were listening to."
77,Freeman Prison Tunnels Tour,The torch light tour was amazing. The lady who conducted our tour was hilarious. I wasn’t aware that torch light meant scary so my boyfriend really got the upper hand on that prank. Will definitely recommend
78,Torch Light Tour,I did did a package including the tunnels and gaol tour. The tunnels were fascinating and the history well explained. The guides were brilliant. It was fairly strenuous on the body as the tunnel height was low and you spent some time bent over. Safety was over killed so minimal risk of injury. The climb up and down required a bit of effort. Highly recommended but it is a bit physical. The gaol tour was interesting and being a world heritage site very informative. The cafe was a letdown no beef patties for burgers and after 15mins I went and got my money back as they had not started my order. Extremely slow service considering there would not have been more than 10 people there.
79,Don't miss this trip,I really enjoyed the tour and fascinated by the history. Our guide told us really interesting facts and patiently waited while we all took photos.
80,Excellent,"We visited Fremantle Prison and went on two tours since it’s only an extra 10 dollars for another tour. I would defo recommend doing the Convict Prison Tour since it gives you a lot of the background, but we also did the True Crime Tour. Both of our tours were conducted by…"
81,Well worth doing jail time whilst in Perth,"Really enjoyed the tour of the prison - we took the only one that was wheelchair accessible, which really is NOT wheelchair accessible - they need a few more little ramps such as at the beginning of the tour getting out of the kitchen area to say that it is wheelchair accessible.  Needless to say the rest of the tour was manageable.  Fascinating that the prison was last used not long ago!  Jane is an excellent guide!"
82,Fremantle Prison Tour,"The night tour of Fremantle Prison was amazing.  Our guide Simon was very informative and had a great sense of humour.  The whole tour is done by torch light.  The sound affects were awesome and added to the ""spookiness"" of the tour.  I would highly recommend this attraction to anyone visiting Perth."
83,Excellent tour with young kids,"Unfortunately I was late to do a tour but did enjoy what I was allowed to do and see with out a tour, worth a look if  your in Fremantle.Very interesting facts and makes you think of the poor convicts.Our pensioners today have no idea."
84,Overpriced for what you get,"Highly recommended! Convict n tunnel tour for sure. We started off with the tunnel tour and had to sign a waiver. This got us rather worried. We were also strapped into overalls and harnesses. This added to the level of concern. Word of caution, you will have to climb up and down a set of ladders but with the body harness, you will be very safe. The only concern is if you suddenly have a panic attack, you have no choice but to either push through or be hoisted up in a rather undignified manner I will add. Also, there will be small confined spaces where you have to bend over and walk, but only a very small stretch. Also paddle a small timber tinnie through the tunnel in confined and dark spaces. So if you have a strong fear of dark, small spaces, perhaps it’s a good idea not to sign up for it and ruin it for everyone else ( I did not suffer this issue, this is just a fr8endly reminder) the tunnel tour itsefl was very informative and in fact one of the highlights of our southwest trip. On to the convicts tour. One phrase, THANK YOU JANINE Janine was a fabulous storyteller. You could sense her passion and interest in the subject and her storytelling prowess added to the experience. The tour itself again was very interesting and informative. Loved visiting the prison and apparently the prison accommodation is pretty cool too. I didn’t sign up for it, but was told it is worth the experience."
85,Tunnels tour,"It was that good we went back for a second tour,, with 5 to choose from it’s a hard choice trust me u will enjoy the visit"
86,Three tours in one day - sensational guides ,The overall experience was great. Knowledgeable friendly staff lead the tours and shared the history enthusiastically. Be warned if booking back to back tours that you may need to rush off from the end of one to meet the next as they run into each other.
87,Tunnel Tour is excellent !,"I took 3 tours back to back, the rest of the family just one. I really enjoyed the tour focusing on the modern aspects of the prison, the one I enjoyed least was the one about prison breakouts and serial killers, the guide tried to be humorous and simply wasn’t. The last tour concentrated on the convict years and was delivered at a fast pass"
88,Fremantle Prison,"So we thought that each tour (There’s 3 themes) you’d see similar aspects of the prison but told with different stories. Wrong- each tour only takes you on one aspect of the prison- so if you think you’ll see the whole thing with the $20 tour you book think again. The tour itself was great, we did the convict tour- and our guide was obviously keen to share the stories and tales from life at Fremantle prison, very cool! The prison is an interesting place and very different from the history on the eastern side of Australia."
89,Enjoyed the tour!,I want to come back again. Our guide was amazing super engaging and knowledgeable. The history of the place is fascinating and there are a number of tours worth doing. For kids I recommend the more recent history rather than the convict one as it is more interesting for them. Want to come back and do the “scary” tour but not appropriate for younger kids.
90,'Prison With History,"Booked the Convict Prison tour which was excellent. Takes you through most of the prison and gives a great history of it. One tour was enough to get a good feel for what it was like. All tours last 1 hour 15 mins. That’s more than enough, unless you really want to spend more time there. The guides are very friendly and it’s very professionally run. A definite must when you got to Fremantle!"
91,False accessibility claims for Behind Bars tour,"Very interesting tour around the prison, the tour guide was very knowledgeable and made the tour enthralling."
92,Excellent guided tours,"This tour is a must for all history buffs! We had such a great tour guide named Ben, he knew the whole history, names of convicts back to front. He is a really great bloke too.  I thought i knew it all but there was quite a few important things i learnt too.Thanks for the great tour, Lisa & i loved it!"
93,Torchlight Tour,"Loved the tour so much we went back for another the next day. Very interesting re history of Western Aust and indeed the rest of Aust. Very nice cafe, pleasent staff all round. The Tram stops here too. A must when in Fremantle"
94,Spooky history,The guides that take you around the prison are very informative and really give you a great insight into the conditions the prisoners were exposed to.A wonderful attraction to experience.
95,Colonial Convicts,"Well worth a visit to this historical penitentiary.  We booked two tours and saw both the past and recent history of this building.  Both tour guides were entertaining and knowledgeable.  They took the tours at a pace fit for all with the opportunity to really get a good view of the interiors,whilst absorbing the atmosphere of this foreboding place.  There is a cafe within the grounds along with a fascinating display and account of the riots that took place prior to the prison closing in the nineties. Should you take a tour of the prison, may I suggest comfy shoes as you could be on your feet for a while, especially if you do more than one tour...."
96,Informative and Interesting,"We did two tours, the Convict Era Tour and the Prisoner Era Tour. I I had been staying in Fremantle, I would have gone back for some of the other tours. The guides gave a very interesting commentary of the history of the prison, built by the first convicts in 1850, it operation and days in the lives of the convicts and prisoners. This was still a Medieval prison in 1991 when it closed. The riots in 1988 and pressure from the world about the inhuman conditions was likely justified."
97,Very informative,"Came here with the wife as a part of a weekend away. We completed the Behind Bars tour which gave a great overview of the prison, and covered a lot of what went on there. The tour is easy walking around the grounds and I would recommend to anyone which is interested in WA history, or prison life in general."
98,Very interesting.,“Behind Bars” and Convict Prison”  guide was very good brought it to life. Well organised timing of each tour. Only negative once you’d done one tour felt some of the prison you saw overlapped as the usage changed over time still well worth doing. There is a cafe in the courtyard. Need to be able to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces. Good value if you do two or more tours. Didn’t book in advance just turned up.
99,Great informative tour.,"Having already done the 'Torch Light Tour' (which was great) on a different trip, I decided to do the 'Tunnel Tour' on this occasion and wasn't disappointed although not for people with back issues. Starts with a climb down lots of metal ladders, a walk through the tunnels then a boat ride not to mention the climb back up. Lots of fun and interesting"
100,Well Worth A Visit,"We had a look at all the free parts of the jail we were on a cruise and time was limited The information was great from the different prisoners , construction time line and even where the prison guards came from.The tours looked excellent and we will definitely do them next time we are back in Fremantle"
101,My 7th visit to prison,I joined the convicts tour. Our tour guide was fantastic (I think Justin was his name). He could have read from the phone book and I still would have found him interesting. His story telling really brought to life the vibe of the convict era.
102,Interesting and creepy,Had a very informative and humorous guide.The history of the first inmates and the work that they did within the prison was fascinating .
103,Exploring Freemantle Prison + tunnels,"We had heard good things about the tunnel tour from our friends but it was even better than expected! Mix of history, rowing around water tunnels in the dark and climbing 20m under the prison. Our tour guide Sarah was great and even threw in some bad jokes on the two hour tour.…"
104,Convict Tour,"Having done the ‘behind bars’ and the night tour on previous visits to Perth,we decided to do the tunnels tour this time. We were not disappointed, excellent adventure, very informative and entertaining with our guide who had a great sense of humour. As previous reviews, you do need to be able to manage the climb up and down the ladders, bending and crouching in the tunnels, however our guide didn’t rush anyone and ensured everyone on the tour was safe and okayWell worth the money"
105,Very informative and interesting,"Enjoyable visit to prison ! !. Very well informed guides, took two tours to get the history of the early life and the most recent life of the prison. What a place, great that it is so well preserved."
106,The only UNSECO place in Perth,"We decided to do this tour, as it was very different. How often can you go into a jail and do this at night. Richard was out tour guide, he was great. He spoke well and told great stories about the prison. The group was of not too big. We each were handed a torch and told the guidelines of the tour. Our kids are 15 and 13. If you have under 9 I would probably not don this tour as they may get scared. Overall this was a awesome tour to do. I would like to do a tunnel tour next time."
107,Visit to the Fremantle prison,From the moment you walk to the front you turn back time - it was wonderful and we had the best woman tour guide out. It was informative and so interesting. So glad we went.
108,True Crime with Justin,"Fremantle Prison is interesting place to visit, with lot of history.We had a 2 tours ticket, Behind the Bars and Convict History. Both tours were nice and informative, the guides were great and knowledgeable. Kids enjoyed both tours and the guide stories.We did not have the chance to explore the officers cottages.In addition, the site offers nice gift shop and cafe."
109,Great story telling,This was a great afternoon and gave us some excellent insight into Australian History. Our guide was excellent!
110,Interesting place,"We were staying close by and decided to check this out one Sunday afternoon. They run several different themed tours throughout the day, and we went on the Behind the Bars, and True Crime tours. Both were very informative, and the guides knew their subjective matter really well, and were quite witty with their story telling. It is a large complex, and provides a fascinating insight into what prison life must have been like. There is also a gift shop and coffee shop on site. Well worth the visit."
111,Great Nic,Well worth a visit.  Tour guide was very interesting and provided a great insight into life behind bars.
112,No toilets in the cells even when the gaol closed in 1991.,"There are a number of tours available, we chose one suitable for children as we had the grandchildren with us. the staff were welcoming and friendly. the tour itself was very interesting pointing out the history of the prison, its ""interesting"" convicts as well as the general history of Freemantle, and tour guide was a mine of knowledge. strongly recommend a visit."
113,Errie to say the least,We were there for the late-night visit and it was really great. Must have been a rough time for the prisoners.
114,Very interesting place,"Wow what an interesting place to visit.  I just had time to do the ""Behind the bars"" tour and the tour guide was knowledgeable and full of interesting local facts.  this tour took 75 mins and was well worth it.   I wish I'd had the time to do the two hour tunnels tour.    Next time!   Definitely worth a visit."
115,Interesting night tour,"My husband and I did the torchlight tour with Simon, and the True Crime tour with Steve (hope i got the names right!). They were both so interesting, different, and highly recommended.Worth the cost of admission. It was cold on the night we visited and the tour is not heated, so…"
116,Brilliant ,"A great 1.5 hr tour with Moira, who took us back in time and gave us a very informative commentary about life and times of convicts and prisoners."
117,Prison tour.,"We went to the prison and because of the nature of the prison and the information shared about the prison and the history, it’s not really entertaining or enlightening for young children. They got bored. It also restricted the kid of prison tours we could go for. Some are not appropriate for young children so not allowed to choose some of the more interesting tours. Will definitely go back without kids."
118,Ok if you have never done this kind of thing before ,"Simon our (Au) tour guide was fantastic and very entertaining and informative, kept us captivated, highly recommend"
119,Amazing step back in time,We opted for the tour that went inside the prison to give us more of a feel of the horrific life the prisoners had to endure during their sentence.Our tour guide was very informative and appreciative of the appalling conditions of the prisoners lifes while they were incarcerated.A tour not to be missed.
120,full of history,"This was our first visit and didn’t know what to expect. There are a selection of tours covering various aspects of the prisons history. Each tour is around one and a quarter hours and is very comprehensive. Amazing that it only closed in 1991 when most of the facilities,and the cells hadn’t really moved forward on 150 years.Well worth the visit and will be returning for another visit soon"
121,Grim but interesting ,"Very interesting tour and so much history that I was not aware of. The guide really communicated the feeling of being in the prison. And the films, art gallery and museum all added a lot."
122,The Captain Cook Cruise Combo Ferry/Prison/Tram ticket is great value.,"We did the behind bars tour and convict life tour, to be honest it wasn't that different and we had a repeat of info on both tours, maybe as we had same guide. Behind bars tour was better as we saw a bit more of the prison and also saw the gallows. If I was going again, would do behind bars and tunnel tour. Staff very informative and well worth it. It really is a history, albeit quite sad, that should be kept and told."
123,The Best Tour Guide!,I've been to Fremantle prison for two tours before. But the night time one was excellent. It was very well run. It was really quite different seeing it from a night perspective would thoroughly  recommend
124,Social history!!,"Really informative, did the True Crime tour and our guide Debbie really knew her stuff and tried to submerge us in the story as well."
125,Wow - could be worth a second visit,"We visited the prison and looked around the freely accessible areas and exhibits first.    We opted for the “Behind bars tour” which lasts around 75 minutes and costs $22 per adult.  The tour guide (Ben) was very knowledgeable and presented the information clearly.  That said,…"
126,Christie - The best tour guide,Did the basic guided tour which took around 90 minutes. Guide was interesting as was the prison itself. Would have liked to do the tunnel tour but the price was exorbitant. Having said that if you are visiting Fremantle you must see this attraction.
127,Once in a lifetime adventure,"great tour with a excellent tour guide named chris, highly recommended him very knowledgeable, & a happy guy in general with great customer service. Arrived at the correct time & from then the service from the front door to office box & pre booked tickets all great! The tour was amazing make sure ur not scared of heights ( I’m a little scared but said I wasn’t lol) my partner ditched me when it came to climbing down the ladder( bloody chicken he is) , so I went in alone .. I felt very comfortable with the guide and the other tourists at the time! Well completely recommend to anyone that’s wants to go that extra mile & take a look around. Very interesting place !!"
128,Insightful ,"We booked the Halloween tour which was amazing. The cold, windy weather helped with the mood of the night. All actors were incredible in their skills and actually made me jump and keep me on edge."
129,Interesting ,"Fabulous we did the convict tour, been from the UK it was very interesting to see how our forefathers on both sides of the law lived and worked and built Western Australia , the guide was excellent"
130,Our dark past,"I did this tour around 15 years ago and felt happy to go again with new visitors travelling with me for the first time in Australia.    If I’m honest I think I enjoyed it more 15 years ago but maybe it’s because I did a slightly different tour.    Our group was 30 which maybe was a little too big, last time I suspect there were fewer of us (it’s strange in a way as we are right in the middle of the Coronavirus drama and you might expect it to be a little quieter than usual).  Anyway it was still very interesting and I’d love to go back and do the underground tour next time."
131,Family Visit ,"A short walk from the ferry port, this was a pretty good tour with an interesting guide who was informative throughout. There are several different tours available and we chose the Convict Tour which showed us the type of life the inmates here had from when it opened until it closed relatively recently.Decent tour and good value for money. Glad we did it."
132,A must must must see and do ,I went on one tour...they have a few to choose from and I will be going on the underground tour next visit. The guide was so knowledgable and had worked in the actual working prison! The history and stories are amazing...I had no idea!! this place has so much atmosphere and the guide paints amazing images in your head. Definitely a must when visiting Freemantle
133,Interesting- but there’s a catch,"The Tunnels Tour was definitely the highlight of the tour. It involved harnesses, climbing and crawling through the cave which was alot of fun. Our tour guide also had lots of stories and knowledge to share. The Prison Tour was average and was over-shadowed by the Tunnels Tour and in comparison to other prison tours (Alcatraz), it lacked information, exhibitions, stories and imagination. The Prison Tour could be improved by having a self guided audio tour, more visual information and more cells open to see and experience how the prisoners felt."
134,Great insight on the inside ,"This tour was incredible.Sarah was our guide for the 2.5 hour journey below the prison. You do need some level of fitness as you do descend and ascend 20metres of ladder. When in the tunnels you can not stand up straight until you get to stand up corner for a brief stretch. The canoe trip through the tunnels is amazing.I'm 61,not very fit,but feel very proud I completed the tour(many thanks to Sarah for talking me up the return 20m ascent) Highly recommended if you don't mind heights and aren't claustrophobic.My friend and I loved it(sore muscles for a few days).An amazing experience.Thanks Sarah. Kathy and Jo."
135,Fantastic ,"My family absolutely enjoyed the behind bars tour. This tour is suitable for those with young children and those with mobility issues as there were no stairs to climb. The sharing of the history of the place and her personal stories made the tour great for everyone. The stories she shared captivated even my children. Walking through the prison cells, kitchen, gallows and yard took us back a moment in time. For kids who love to solve puzzles, there is a crossword puzzle sheet you can buy at the Gift shop. The answers to the puzzle can be found as you explore the prison and the information center. Some of the answers are from the stories that is shared by the guides as well. To enjoy the puzzle hunt remember to take away the smartphone from the kids so they cannot google the answers. I love the part where there was the actual sounds of the kitchen in action from the speakers. They activate the moment you enter the kitchen. It is sad to hear that children as young as 8 to 9 years old were also sent to this prison. To me it is a must go to learn more about the history of Perth.  There is much more to learn here as compared to going to theme parks in my opinion."
136,Interesting place,"We enjoyed all three tours at the prison, it is worthwhile going, as not much else to do in Freo, but not something that would be in my top 20 things I’ve done. Nonetheless i would recommend it if staying in Fremantle."
137,Torch light tour,"There are 5 types of tours. We took the ‘Convict Tour’ for 2 adults and 1 child which amounted to AUD 56. There is a cafe just before the ticket sales office. Being my first prison tour, I thought the prison would be dark, dirty, creepy with bad energy looming around instead it was ok and clean.  Parts of the prison were undergoing some upgrade, the rest were maintained quite well and spooked up in deco for Halloween.  Looked like a ship inside and when you learn of its history, it would be quite an eye opener.  Some cells were opened to give tourists a gist of how they lived/survived in tough situations.  We went to the chapels, the flogging station, solitary confinement, gallery, all of which were really sad come to think of it. We were advised not to go for the Crime Tour bcoz of our kid.  We ended the tour in 1 hr 20 mins. Moira, our guide did a great job!"
138,This World Heritage Site is Worth a Visit,My partner and I were on the 10:30 am tour this Sunday morning just passed. We had an amazing female tour guide whose name I didn’t catch. Amazing history to the place of colonial times and engaging characters.
139,Night Time Torch Tour,"We did 2 guided tours around the gaol, the first one being about the convict history, and the 2nd one being about prison life up until the gaol closed in the 1990’s. Both the guides were really informative, and interesting to listen to.  On both tours we were shown around different parts of the gaol and you really got the feel of what it was like to be imprisoned there,  We had been recommended to do a tour there and it did not disappoint."
140,Tunnels tour,The guided tour is really recommended. It gives a great overview of everything that went on in the prison. Unbelievable that it was still functioning in the 1990's
141,Lots of history!,"we really enjoyed frematle prison tour, and being Irish it made it that extra bit special to understand our routes in WA. Our guide was lovely and very informative. nothing was rushed and everyone's questions were answered. Our group was made up of adults of all ages, children and a few non English speaking visitors, all of which were accommodated for. I would defiantly recommend a visit."
142,Good way to spend a few hours,"Really interesting place to visit.  We had an evening visit, as part of a conference gathering, with food and drinks provided.  It was excellent, the food was great, really enjoyed it.  Well done."
143,Very interesting,"Visited Fremantle Prison and did the 'Convict Tour'. I learnt a lot about the convict history of WA, which I was quite unfamiliar with having grown up in Victoria. The highlight of the tour was all the stories we were told of the convicts who spent time in the prison - some fascinating characters and intriguing tales of escape. You get some information about the prison in the post-convict era, which was really interesting. if we had have had more time on the day, it would have been good to also do the 'Behind the Bars Tour', to learn more about the prison's modern use.We were offered a second tour for only $10 on the day (not sure if this is seasonal) - so if you have time available this might be a good option.Most of the tour is inside, so weather is not really an issue. There are several stairs to climb inside though, so if you have mobility issues, you may need to consider this."
144,A must in Fremantle,"Had already done the behind bars tour and the torch light tour, so decided to do the tunnel tour. Glad we did as so different from the others our guide Debbie was great not only knowlegable but had a great sence of humour. It does require a bit of hard work climbing and bending but is definatly worth it, trying to steer the boat is harlious would recommend"
145,Great Family Outing,"Just completed a 2.5hr tunnel tour under Fremantle Prison. Best tour ever, our guide Chris was fantastic, very friendly and knowledgable. You need to be fit,climbing 20metres down ladder wih safety harness and hard hat.History wad so interesting, but floating in the barge along the tunnel was a highlight. Also did Behind tour for an extra $10. Good value."
146,Torchlight Tour,"We did the above tour at 2:15 pm, on Monday, December 30, with a super female guide whose name I cannot remember. She often played the role of a prison warden, to great effect. The tour was very thorough."
147,Great place to start at to get the feel of early Fremantle,We were staying at Hougoumont Hotel and were interested in the connections with the convicts and our hotel. So we did the convict tour and our guide James was very informative and humorous. Well worth the visit to see the history of the area and how it developed over time.
148,Super interesting visit,Although a sad place the prison is very interesting and the guides are great. Worth the money for one of the full tour (various options available).
149,Really Interesting ,"My wife is particularly into crime and punishment, so a prison tour was unmissable for us. We did all 3 tours with Rhonda, Ian and Justin, all 3 were interesting and gave a wonderful insight into the history of the prison, and (semi) modern prison life. There were also some excellent stories about depraved, clever and not-so-clever criminals on the 'true crime' tour which we really enjoyed!"
150,Informative tours,"Our group of four had a wonderful evening touring Fremantle prison by torchlight. Our guide, Janine, made everything come alive. She told the history of the prison, prison conditions, how prisoners were treated and the story of a few individual inmates. It was an amazing tour. Thank you Janine."
151,Tunnel Tour outstanding,Totally loved it. Wish we had planned more time and done the full day here. Three different tours can be done. Amazing history and detailed info by the guide. Excellent experience and also has a very good gift shop. If going to Fremantle do this.
152,Great experience,"You have to be on a tour to go around most of the prison, the guides give you plenty of information as to the history and what it was like back when the prison was open through the ages. It is very interesting to see how it has changed over the years."
153,Definitely worth a visit!,Greatly enjoyed our trip around the old prison and hearing about its history from a very knowledgeable guide.
154,Great Historical Journey,"Visited on  2/3/20,our guide Jane was very informative and pround of the fact that they are descendants of the British and Irish convicts. We arrived late in the day and would loved to have done the other tours. A must see in the Perth/Fremantle area."
155,Interesting but execution room can be a little confronting,Great tour - knowledgeable staff - would recommend to try at least once. We did the night tour - didnt like the multiple jump scares - avoid taking little ones to this for obvious reasons. Havent done the day tour so cannot comment
156,Behind Bars Tour,"We enjoyed this tour through history.  The history of the prison is well-documented and the site is so well-preserved that you can really imagine how rough it was for the prisoners during that time.  One complaint...we wanted a 'tour guide', not a 'wanna be actor'.  Cut the dramatics of whispering, spooky voice, etc and just tell the stories.  We tuned a lot of his presentation out, because our guide/actor  was too hard to understand with his theatrics."
157,Short visit but enjoyed what I could do.,"Worthwhile visit we did 2 tours,the Behind Bars and the True Crime. The second one starts staight away as the  first one finishes. Make sure you put enough money in the car park meter as the council are apparently pretty strict. If you have a NZ Goldcard you can get a discount for the Jail trips"
158,Older part of Prison tour.,"This was surprisingly a very insightful tour .. with Debra.. she was very informative..&  very approachable. I’ve been to a few prisons over the years .. Alcatraz, Port Arthur... and this was excellent. They offered 3-4 different tours.. I would love to also do the True Crime tour and the night tour. Lots of options. My advice is go and explore."
159,True Crime and Torch Light tour,Came with my family (two kids around 12) and really enjoyed the tunnels tour at the prison.  Well worth the expense and Matthew was a good guide.  Interesting history and information and exciting in the tunnels and on the boats.
160,WOW!,I had a fantastic tour of the prison with Matthew who is to commended on his early convict knowledge.There are free museums an art gallery at the prison with a well stocked cafe and gift shop .Well worth a visit on your next trip to Fremantle.
161,Fantastic experience,We took the ‘behind the bars’ tour of the former convict prison the opened in the 1880’s and was still being used as a prison in the 1990’s. a great insight to the conditions and daily life inside the prison from knowledgable and entertaining guides. There are audio guides for those whose first language is not English. Allow an hour and half for the tour. Visit the convicts cafe for food and refreshments after your tour. This venue is visited by the hop on hop off tram and is close to stop 3 on the blue bus route.
162,A very interesting tour,"There are a number of options for prison tours, but the combo ticket with Captain Cook Cruises worked really well for us.  You get dropped off and collected from the door in good time to join the standard tour.  You get a really good feel for how life was for the original convicts plus inside info on how the prison has been run over the years.  The artwork in some of the cells is interesting and you get to see the gallows - unless you are too squeamish to look."
163,Lock Down,Had a very interesting and informative tour with a great tour guide. Well worth a visit.  The shop has great souvenirs.
164,Outstanding,"Good entertainment for price.I done the history tour before and there very good if you want to hear historical stories. Most pretty horrendous, some sad  but that prison."
165,Interesting afternoon out,"Had a very interesting tour of the prison, so much history here, our guide was very informative.Would recommend"
166,A must do when in freo,"Absolutely well worth doing, we all loved it and it was made all the more special by our tour guide Simon who has a great sense of humour and a knack for remembering names. Highly recommend"
167,A must visit,"So original and unique. Yes you do climb down a long ladder and if your tall you will walk the tour with a stoop, but it’s very well organised and equipped. It’s incredibly interesting, the tour guide has a plethora of facts and tales to tell. Absolutely worth the price. I won’t give too much away, no spoilers!"
168,Great stories,"Enjoyed the day time visit and then went back for the 'after dark' tour which was also well worth it, good way to spend a few hours."
169,A work of art,It is awesome to visit the prison the staff are all great and they know their history. It is still like it  was back when it was a working prison so much history in their
170,Excellent tour and guide.,Convict Tour. Great tour with Steve. Lots of information into the time when the convicts were building and then doing their time in this part of Australia. Loved it.
171,Convict tour excellent,"This tour was amazing for several reasons......the history of the tunnels themselves forming a maze under the prison, the climb down and up, and the fun of negating the water tunnels in the boat. A must do....."
172,Worth a look 👀 ,Fremantle prison was on our things to do whilst visiting the area.This place is amazing with all the history and our tour guide was very funny.The section where they did the hanging is a little touching.Overall experience is brilliant and a must do cannot fault this place.
173,Living history,This is really the main site in Fremantle. It is ok and has an interesting history.  We took the prison tour and it was sort of drawn out and I thought it could have shown more for the time.  Maybe it was because of the guide who was slow in presentation.  We have seen other prisons in Au but this was the most recently operated one.  If you go to Fremantle there are some good restaurants and breweries.  We did not make it to the Maritime museum and wish we had.
174,Impressive ,"If you want to understand how things start and the struggles had, the Tour is a must. The guides within ( we had Janeen) really make it come alive and articulate the real story as if you are living it and watching unfold."
175,Torchlight Tour,"Went on the  Freemantle prison tour today.  A really interesting and worthwhile visit.  You see the cells, kitchens women’s prisons and lots more interesting facts about the prison."
176,Touch light tour with the family. ,"I’m currently visiting friends in Perth and saw they had previously done a Fremantle prison tunnel tour. This struck great interest to me as I find things like this fascinating. After deciding which of the many tours they had to offer, we went with the torchlight tour! It was fantastic from start to finish. Our guide Randal was full of enthusiasm and really played into the role well. He told us many stories about the prison and made them interesting to listen to! He took us through many different parts of the prison and made every part just as exciting as the last. I will definitely be returning before I leave to go back to England and hopefully will get another tour in! The true crime tour or tunnel tour sounds interesting also!"
177,Nice visit,"Had a very informative guided tour of the prison. Tour guide was excellent, would highly recommend a tour if in Fremantle."
178,Behind Bars Tour ,Thank you Simon for that fantastic Tunnel Tour. The tour itself is a great insight into history and your narration along the way and your bubbly attitude to your role make it all the more interesting. You suit the role and we hope you keep doing what you are doing as you are very good at it. The tour itself is worth doing even though it does take a little out if you having to walk through low narrow tunnels. Definitely recommend.
179,interesting history,"We thoroughly enjoyed our first tour with Ian which covered the history of the jail from it's construction by convicts to its closure after the riot.  He was entertaining and informative.  Our second tour which covered individuals with Justin wasn't as enjoyable, probably due to the subject matter.  It has a nice café and a museum to wander through."
180,Marketing gimmick to make money....just visit the gallery,The guy who took us round had his script off pat and had clearly worked in the prison. He offered many facts but it was hard to gushed his opinions. This was a grim place and made me question the whole basis of our penal system.
181,Amazing Tunnel Tour,On an overcast spring day during the Freo festival we decided to visit the prison. The experience enabled us to make much more of our tour of the south-west. Our guide/gaoler showed us around with stories of its history from a convict gaol to a modern prison and gave us the experience of doing time
182,Tunnel tour is amazing ,"We brought a friend from over East to see the prison and we got more than we bargained for. Christie was such an outstanding tour guide. We were fortunate enough to get her for the 2 tours we did. She made it insightful, educational and fun. It was a great experience. We'd definitely return to have her guide us on the final tour we didn't get a chance to do"
183,Great visit,"The prison offers a few tours which cover various periods of its history. The informative guide took us around cells and prison yards and we learnt about the history and prison life. The tours are good value, but there is also a gallery, cafe and museum that you can visit free of charge."
184,Great tour ,Well worth seeing. There's a choice of 4 different tours for all interests & walking abilities. We found it fascinating that the prison was still in operation into the 1990's.
185,"Passionate staff, great tours",Great fun! The whole place was eerie at night (even the toilets) and our guide was entertaining. Wish we had more time to explore the prison timeline area... Loved the surprises!
186,Fabulous tour,"During our visit to Fremantle, we took the opportunity to visit the prison. Historic place where the convicts were imprisoned.  We did a guided tour and the person doing it gave us a lot of details about the imprisonment of these convicts. It is worth taking a tour to visit this prison."
187,Great piece of history,2nd visit and slightly different tour. Well put together and very informative. Worth the money. All ages will enjoy.
188,Captiv-ating ,"Fremantle Prison is an interesting tour, admittedly prison tours aren't for everyone, I have seen quite a few and this is one of the better ones. Great History of WA"
189,Well worth it,"We are so glad we visited the prison this trip to Freemantle and so glad that it wasn't bulldozes and turned into a shopping centre. A sensational piece of Australian convict and modern history in the one structure. Great tour guides, James and Deb, made our tours so interesting and entertaining. Highly recommended."
190,Amazing,"Our guide for the early days of the gaol was informative, genuinely interested, and compassionate in considering the considerable hardships of prisoners sentenced in UK for crimes that would attract a fine today"
191,Exploring history ,"We were advised that a trip to the prison was well worthwhile, and we weren't disappointed. It's a facinating place to visit - we took the 'basic' guided tour - which I would really recommend. The guide was superb - lots of history without getting bored and a great sence of humour/drama - great"
192,Excellent tour,"Were stuck at home due to Covid so we thought we'd check out some local attractions and I'd been meaning to visit this place for literally decades since it closed and this weekend was it!We did the trifecta - ""True Crime"", ""Convict Prison"" (yesterday) and the finale ""Behind Bars"" today.Our guides were full of knowledge and took us on a tour of the dark and seedy side of prison life, you can easily see that the guides have done their research and are passionate about the attraction, which made our experience even more engrossing.In a nutshell - we loved it and would recommend it to anyone visiting Perth or Fremantle, don't be put off by the number of shops closed around Fremantle because the Prison can be an outing on it's own."
193,Fantastic ,"An interesting insight in to the lives of inmates years ago. The tour guide provided excellent information, with a humorous side to it. The tour showed the horrific conditions and punishments that prisoners had to endure. A really good tour!"
194,Torchlight tour,"My husband and I visited Fremantle Prison whilst we were in Perth as we were told it was one of those must do activities. We also have an interest in criminology and justice etc.We chose to do all three tours on the same day which sounds intense but each tour really helped to build a picture of what prison life was like, how and why it was built and how the purpose of the building changed over the years.Our tour guides were fantastic and really brought the experience to life. Thank you to Debbie, Brett and Jane. Some of the stories from the True Crime Tour were absolutely chilling and the contrast of the artwork to the prison cells was extraordinary."
195,Excellent tours and well worth a visit.,What an amazing place to take a tour.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff who gave great information and answered any questions.  Would highly recommend.
196,Great visit,Very friendly staff from the start. So worth the price as well and all the staff was so knowledgeable about the prison and all the history. Sooo worth a visit!
197,"Great tour, Great learning","Thank you for an amazing experience. Ian our tour guide was phenomenal. He was so lovely, knowledgeable and passionate. The extras adding the final touch to our experience made the night tour so enjoyable. Thank you love always the Pink Ladies 🤣 WA girls on tour 2019."
198,Great Place to Visit,"My father and I did both the Tunnels Tour and Behind Bars tour on a slow Monday, just us two on our tunnels tour and thoroughly enjoyed hearing about the wicked history and dark stories that this Fremantle landmark holds. Our guide, Courtney, was extremely lively and friendly, letting us pick and choose from her favorite spots in the caves, and she answered every question we asked with full and spooky detail. Would recommend the tunnel tours to anyone visiting Fremantle!"
199,Terrifying torch tour,"Although perhaps just a little long, we thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the prison and hearing about its history.   We did the convict era tour and it was fascinating. Our guide was so enthusiastic if perhaps a bit too lengthy in his stories.   Highly recommend however"
200,"great tour, and guide.","We're a family of 6 who attended the torch light tour at 8.30pm. We were early for our tour and managed to walk through the two museum galleries that were free to enter. Although informative on the history of the prison, a lot of the display items lacked description so we had no idea what some of those things were. The tour began at 8.30pm sharply. Our tour guide, Steven was hilarious and had such enthusiasm with the way he spoke about the prison. He set a very good pace that wasn't too fast or too draggy and was loud enough that everyone could hear him. He was very friendly, always up for extra questions or small talk with the group as we moved from one place to another. He even stayed behind after the tour to have a chat with us. The night tour was well organised and thrilling, the jump scares and actors were well planned out and educational at the same time. A feedback though would be the unfriendly lady staff (blonde with medium lenght hair) at the beginning of the tour. She was the person who would ring a bell to signal the start of a tour and gave out instructions to customers regarding the first location of the tour. She was very rude and sarcastic. She made a joke out of customers who had come forward to ask questions and told them or brushed them off. Very impolite and was a bad start to the tour so I'd highly recommend not approaching her at all! Overall, fremantle prison is a must see attraction while you're here especially if you've got nothing planned in the evening!"
201,Well worth visiting ,"On Wed 18 Dec our family went to Fremantle Prison, and so glad we did.We did three tours: * Behind Bars Tour - 10.30am (Steven) * Tunnels Tour - 12.20pm (Sarah) * Torchlight Tour - 7.45pm (Simon)Amazing.  The three guides were awesome.  Very informative and interactive.  Well done guys, you are certainly an asset to the prison.Behind Bars was a good tour for us to start with.  An introduction on the history of the prison and highlighting various areas around the place.  Thank you Steven.Tunnels Tour - A MUST DO.  It was so good and just a bit different.  After putting on gum boots, hard hat, head light, safety harness and life jacket we descended down a ladder system 20 metres. The tunnels are low and walking whilst bent over is common - especially for a 6’ 2” bloke 😄.  Then two to a punt boat floating through the tunnel network.On a couple of occasions all lights turned off for complete darkness.  Even an opportunity to float in complete darkness whilst navigating the punt through the tunnel system was novel.  Really enjoyed this one particularly. (Well done Sarah 👏)Torchlight Tour was another perspective on the prison at night.  Simon was funny and we loved his humour.  A couple of acted scenes were great and told good stories and a couple of scary moments.A great day out which we highly recommend to anyone visiting Perth area."
202,Must see,We arrived a few minutes after the Behind Bars tour had started and the staff were more than happy to let us join the tour.  Our guide was Brett who made the tour very informative and entertaining.  He obviously loves his job. There was one person on the tour who couldn't speak…
203,Very informative,"Everyone needs to visit a prison. The guide was a retired guard, empathetic, informative, and knew his history."
204,Worth a visit ,Caught the train to Fremantle from Perth to explore this lovely area. Easy walk to the goal where we did a guided tour of the gaol with a lovely lady who was most entertaining. She gave us an interesting view of what it would have been like to have been a prisoner in a bygone era.
205,History Class Anyone!,If you are in the area this place is a must see. Great for 10+ Year old kids. We had a great time visiting this place.
206,Worth it,"This was an unexpected joy of a visit. Leah was splendid and gave just the right amount of information, with a humourous  twist."
207,1tour was not enough!!,"We visited the prison with not a lot of time to spare, so we didn't do any of the tours. However, the prices were pretty steep for the tours offered - seeing the reviews, maybe they are worth the price.The areas that you can get free access to are packed with information and artifacts from the time and you can get a lot of information from there.Might do a tour next time we visit."
208,Very informative.,Great experience & fascinating to see how the inmates used to live.  The torchlight tour is a must try for all the family. Souvenir shop has a good range of products at reasonable prices.
209,Fascinating insight into the prisons history!,"Apart from the wonderful history of the almost forgotten tunnels, our tour guide James leveled up our experience. His extensive, detailed knowledge made everything super fascinating (+ hilarious).I truly had no idea what I was in for when my husband booked this tour and being a tad scared of heights, James and Sam made the way down the ladders into the tunnels, easy.The boats in the tunnels were a definite highlight, we loved the challenge of navigating around in pitch black at the end. I couldn't recommend it more - this tour is an absolute must-do, especially for Perth locals!"
210,Night Tour,Went for a tour of the prison learning about the people who where held here before it closed. Walking around and learning about the heritage was fascinating. Learning about  the riots and fires that happened there and what they had to do and construct to keep the prison operational was mesmerizing to say the least. All in all the prison was a great idea for a day out where you get to learn something. Would recommend going in Spring or Summer.
211,Would like to be there again,"I can imagine how the inmates felt.  This ""tourist attraction"" was a waste of time and money. Felt like a form of punishment."
212,Intresting,"THERE IS NO WAY THAT THIS TOUR IS 100% ACCESSIBLE AS PER THEIR OWN BROCHURE CLAIM.Considering tours have been conducted since 1991 it is amazing that proper disability access has not been provided on their main tour. As a lightweight travel mobility scooter user I was expected to get myself up and down 100mm steps without assistance. The few attempts at placing pads or ramps were improperly placed or poorly designed ensuring difficulties in traversing openings. It is obvious that no one in a wheelchair or scooter was ever asked about the feeble or nonexistent access modifications. I understand it is a heritage building. Nevertheless there are numerous ready made solutions from readily available sources which would suit the access points.At the end of the tour I was told in a loud voice in front of ALL participants that I may as well go no further than the outside of the Women's Prison gates as I couldn't get up the steps anyway. The guide said he would stand in the doorway and shout so at least I could hear about it. At the beginning of the tour I was ignored until the third access problem when I lost my cool and told the guide very firmly that the tour was not 100% accessible and it was his job to help me. Only then did he assist with clear instructions to me and the group which helped a couple of times. The best part of the day was when we arrived and Will, the security officer was very informative. The one star is for him.The supervisor, John, refunded the cost of the tour but the humiliation caused as a result of this tour guide's lack of attention at first and then loud and obvious advices later made me truly feel like a third class citizen. The tour commentary was ok but skipped over things like the paintings in the cells. I can't comment on the Women's Prison because I didn't get to see it.I was really excited and looked forward too this tour all day BUT IT FAILED TO DELIVER AS ADVERTISED. Disappointed."
213,Brilliant,Ian was a great guide today.  Great insight into prison history and 'life' of a prisoner.  Well worth your time.
214,Fascinating peek into history,Very expensive for what you get to experience. It has been the most expensive entrance fee of all the museums and historical places that I have visited in Australia. The 75min tour should be cut to 30min as the tour guide waffled on and on retelling the same stuff up to 3 times.…
215,Great spot to visit in Fremantle,"Visit with a friend who won't enjoy much history 😆😆 so we didnt join the tour. But if I had chance to come to this place again, will certainly join the tour, although the price is quite high, hopefully worth it. Quite scary from seeing the pictures and read for a glance."
216,Convict Tour,"Had a guided tour of the prison - very interesting. Although it was a prison for many years, it is also a beautiful building and there are interesting displays in the small museum. Well worth a visit."
217,Eye-opening experience,"The choice of tours are varied but each have different experiences, if you have time do the lot as very informative, we loved it"
218,Really good tour with insight into early convict life,"I was initially skeptical about visiting the prison as I didn't think it would be very interesting or comparable to other places like Alcatraz. However, it is on my top 3 things to do in Western Australia after a 10 day activity packed holiday. We signed up for the last torchlight tour of the day and it was the best decision we made. Our guide was fantastic! She was interesting, well informed and funny. They also have actors that appear in the tour which I wasn't aware of and it's a great feature! You will learn a lot of the dark and gory history of the prison on the night tours but if you have children with you or are not so interested in the gloomy stuff, they also do daylight tours. The place is massive and has a tonne of history. Highly recommend a visit!"
219,Fremantle gaol tunnel tour.,"We personally did only the trip ""Behind Bars"" but I would suggest that if you are in Freemantle do the whole package.  As a retired prison officer I found it a very interesting experience. You will however need the whole day and evening but so worth it and plenty of places to eat when you leave.Dont hesitate just do it and enjoy..."
220,Great tour with knowledgeable your guides,The night tour lasts for about an hour and a half. They try to scare you a few times and have various actors posing as inmates. Not a bad tour.
221,Fantastic views,"bit on the expensive side, however guide very informative and very passionate about the history. No restrictions of photos very good"
222,Inside,"Did the true crime tour. Wasn't made clear before buying but this tour doesn't take you into most of the prison building. Upon hearing this my partner was a bit disappointed. However as it turned out it did take us into the death row block and you do get a look inside. Guide was Justin who was a funny chap and gave a brilliant tour. Discover some of the truly awful people who ended up here and why, some pretty dark stories but also some relatively light hearted, ingenius, escape tales. Only reason I'm not giving five is because it needs to be made more clear before buying the ticket it doesn't go inside a great deal which is what a lot of people are after. That said I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend this tour."
223,Convict Prison,"Fascinating convict site. Great guide, interesting stories. Really well done, something for everyone."
224,Jane was great- amazing tour,Super friendly staff. Had a medical incident right outside the front and one of the security guards kindly ran us to the hospital and rescheduled for us (top bloke). Fun underground boating in the aquefer tunnels. Highly reccomend
225,Great insight,"Fremantle Prison has a lot of history behind the Prison walls. I would definitely recommend doing any of the tours if your wanting to know about some of Perth’s and fremantle’s history from the convicts arriving in the 1850’s right up until it decommissioned as a maximum security Prison in 1991. I absolutely love going on the tours, Fremantle Prison is definitely a worth while visit if your around the Perth area or in Fremantle. All the tour guides are fantastic and one thing I like about the Tour guides is that they present information about  Prison definitely and not always the same and repetitive. They all have their own unique way of telling stories or information differently. I’ll definitely will go back on another tour soon :)"
226,Fremantle Prison,Very interesting and very well divided in different theme tours. So considering more than only one tour is def. worse it. And to us the tunnel tour was the best....
227,Very interesting and informative,"No spoilers here but boy oh boy was the torchlight tour something that all people visiting this place need to do. The staff were amazing in their delivery of the content and gave great insight into what life was like for those who lived here. A well planned and ""executed"" tour experience."
228,Not for the faint of heart! Or anyone with empathic tendencies,Enjoyed our visit to the Fremantle Prison.Interesting history of the harsh conditions the prisoners suffered.Excellent Prison walking tour.Highly recommend.
229,Good Tours,"I have now been to the prison 3 times. Each time I go I have been taken to a new place and have learnt something new and it has been fantastic! There is an incredible history to the prison and I'll be back again to learn more! Thank you to James and Brett, great tour guides!"
230,A definite for visitors to Freemantle,This place is amazing & there so many tours to  choose from. A visit to this place will not disappoint anyone. I'd go back & do another tour next time I'm back in town. Fremantle rocks
231,Something for everyone,a good place to visit the tours are really good lots of info about the area too makes you think how lucky we are in this day and age
232,Behind the bars tour,"We spent our afternoon at Fremantle prison yesterday. We booked onto the tunnel tour for the last tour of the day. As part of our booking for an extra 10$ we also got to be part of the convict tour before hand. The tunnel tour was very informative and fun at the same time, the information is given throughout the tour at various times. Safety briefs regarding equipment were given, the how tos, dos and donts were all made clear. As you are so involved you don’t really realise the time ticking past. We had Simon as our leader, was very informative about the information of the prison; and about what we would do. Was funny and had a good connection with the group, it was a good group atmosphere. On the tour you get to hear about the history of the tunnels and what they were used for; you get kitted up into harnesses and helmets and climb down 20m to the start of the tunnels. You do a mix of walking  and paddling to explore the area. The tour was better than we expected. Had a great experience and laughed lots. Thank you to Simon for making it an enjoyable experience."
233,tunnels tour was a fun filled experience- a must do.,"We visited the jail as part of a day trip from Perth.  It's just a train ride and walk from the station.   The convict tour was really informative about the history of the jail, and Perth/Freemantle in general.  Our tour guide was great!    You can visit a couple rooms in the jail for free, but most of the good stuff is behind the tour pay wall, which isn't cheap, but the tours are a good hour/hour and a half and really interesting.  There are a few different tours to choose from, but we only did the convict tour."
234,Brings convict experience to life,"Absolutely fantastic tour! Not for the faint hearted though. Need to be able to walk/stand 1.5 hours. Our tour guide, Simon, was completely awesome and full of knowledge. Highly recommend this if you are ever in Perth!"
235,Dont get locked in,"This was fantastic... was her to see cells and exercise yard  ... and history of the prison as  a non local,  learnt a lot of history"
236,Amazing torchlight tour,"Overall a great tour cramming in information about Australia's convict history and stories about the prisons past ranging from amusing to somber. Only gets a 4 star rating because of a lack of acknowledgment at the start that the prison sits on Aboriginal traditional lands, and housed Aboriginal prisoners, which really should be standard practice in 2019"
237,Fremantle prison- Convict era tour,"I loved my most recent tour at Fremantle Prison last week, which I visit nearly every year, and always hear different stories and am reminded of things I’ve heard on previous trips, but forgotten. I did the Behind Bars tour with very knowledgeable guide Moira who made the facts come alive."
238,Very Interesting ,"Make time to visit, you won't regret It!The guided tour of the prison takes about 1hr 30mins. You are in the custody (sorry, company!) of one of the very knowledgable guides.You will see every aspect of what prison life was like here, from the early history when the prisoners were used to build the prison, up to the last days as a working prison.There are tours of the underground canals available but I havn't yet done that one. There is a cafe and restroom facilities and some small display areas.The prison is only 5 minutes walk from the town centre and is also served by the Freemantle street tram."
239,Slight underwelming,"We'd been told it was a great place to see, but it was way more than we expected, and so well preserved. We did the 'behind bars' tour...about the modern era of the prison, not the convict period.  Our guide - Mannie - was amazing, sharing so much knowledge with us and keeping even the smallest visitor in the group interested. The separate museum parts are really well set up and very interesting, too. Well worth a look.It's a big place - much more to it than I imagined - and if we'd had time, I would have happily gone back to do some of the other tours to learn more. Be careful on a hot day - shade is available but limited when you have to be outside, and be sure you've got water with you.   (Then think what those prisoners had to endure!)"
240,Excellent guide,Did the fremantle prison tunnel tour. Amazing to see what the first convicts did in the 1880's. Historic 2.5 hours and you can experience the cramped conditions. Not to be missed after seeing the conditions of the main prison
241,Interesting but expensive,"Tunnel tour fantastic. Was told by my neighbour to go and do this, am very glad I did. Guide Stuart was fantastic. Well worth spending $65 to have a look"
242,Great experience,Fascinating to learn about the history from the perspective of the prison and the importance of the convicts in establishing the community. Very knowledgable guides make this a must do trip.
243,WHAT A WONDERFUL TOUR,Had a couple of hours before we could check in to our hotel so we called in at the Freo Prison. The Convict Tour was about to start so we grabbed some tickets. Great tour of the grounds and the cells. Our guide told wonderful tales of the inmates and the history of Fremantle. There are a few different tours that start at varied times on the quarter hour. Most run for 1hr 15mins. I’d definitely recommend the Convict Tour.
244,Take a Guided Tour,Not really a fan of guided tours but due to the size of the place you see why it's necessary. Definitely worth seeing while in Freo. James out guide was very good.
245,Incredibly informational and interesting tours!,This is a very well organised and slick operation as behoves its status as a world heritage listed site. We only had enough time for the convict tour. This was the establishment and building of the old cell blocks and the stories associated with them. The guide (Ian) was very informative and kept the attention of all the party (including several schoolchildren). All credit to him. I will definitely be back and do some of the other tours.
246,Tunnels visit,What an eye opener. It was well worth a visit and doing the tour.Lots of stairs to be mindful of though.
247,A really interesting and informative tour,It has beautiful panorama views from the top. The prison was closed so didnt get to see inside. There is a small beach next to the prison.
248,Interesting trip,The history if this prison is gruesome and sobering. The poor women who frequented this place were treated miserably.  The guide was entertaining and knowledgeable.
249,Absolute must,This was the last convict prison to close in Australia. There are a variety of tours that you can take which are all well worth it.
250,Interesting,I feel too much of hype is created about Fremantle Prison among tourists.  Their visiting charges start from $30 per person.....come on give me a break.  It is a historical place but they have made it a market gimmick.  The best way is to visit the galleries inside the premises as they explain everything about the prison and its barbaric activities in those days.  There is a nice exhibition as well.  All these are free unless you want to go inside the prison building which I don't feel is worth by paying so much of money.  When we were there we found that 80% of the tourists were only visiting the gallery.  The staff was kind of pushy to make the paid visit......I hate this attitude when I am a tourist.
251,Torchlight Tour,Interesting look into the past and how our ancestors lived.   Tough punishment for what today seem petty crimes. Well preserved and fun tour guides.  There is a bit of walking and stair climbing depending on what tour you take.
252,Convict prison tour! So informative and great!,"Freemantle is one of Perth's must do attractions, and I totally recommend this experience, especially the tunnel tour (there are about four experiences that you choose to do).It's an interesting place to understand Australia's history!Getting there was easy. I just took a train from where I was staying to Freemantle. From there I walked for about 10mins. On the way, there's plenty of places to eat, but if you go on weekends, such as I did - enjoy the market place (sorry I forgot the name), but it's located pretty much outside Freemantle Prison"
253,Interesting piece of history,"This was simply amazing, didn’t think I would find it as interesting as I did.The guide for the tour was Ian and he was SUPER.We did 3 tours each taking around 70mins, it’s a place I will never forget ( so much history)"
254,Definately worth a visit.,"From the moment I entered Fremantle Prison I was greeted by a lovely gentleman, Sean, who assisted me in choosing a tour that would suit me and the disabled boy I was caring for. He suggested the “Behind the Bars” tour, which was outstanding. Janine led us through history and was so informative and fun. Thank you to both Sean and Janine for making our day out so special."
255,Advance reservations are recommended to visit Fremantle Prison,Very interesting facts about the early days of Fremantle and colourful past 'residents' of the prison. Be ready for some surprises along the tour. And bring along a sweater if you're taking the last tour of the day as it can get quite chilly.
256,Three Words. The Tunnels Tour.,"With several unique tours of this historic attractions, it is really possible to step back in time and learn what life was like for the convicts detained here. Quite a bit of walking during the tour and several stairs to climb, so not ideal for people with reduced mobility, but apart from that it's quite interesting for young ones as well."
257,Ghosts and art,"Visited before it opened ay 10am, but was allowed to walk around and have a look at the museum before the tours started. Joined the ""convict tour"" which was extremely informative with helpful guide ready to take questions. Walked around most of the prison areas. Whole family enjoyed the tour. Would like to join the other tours next time we visit."
258,Prison tour,Located in free mantle this origin had history in it. Very well maintained and very informative. Although you can opt for s guided tour which we did and it was very informative. You can even find sketch on the wall done by a prisoner. With posting a visit.
259,Great value,"Not too long and covered a lot of history in this well preserved prison. If you have a fear of heights the tour of the original prison may have some issues for you but check at the office. Excellent guide with clear and well spoken narrative. TIP Spend some time in the accompanying |(free) rooms after the tour instead of just exiting, as the tour gives you much better background."
260,Fremantle main attraction,"Yesterday, my husband and I took a trip out to Freo and decided to visit the Fremantle Prison.  It was our first time of going there.  Upon entry we were greeted and directed as to which tours were coming up that day.  We chose Behind Bars as it was starting a few minutes later and seemed like a good first tour option.  It didn't disappoint.  Our tour guide Deb was very good.  She took us around parts of the prison constantly giving us info.  She spoke clearly and audibly, at a good pace.  Cameras are allowed but flashes need to be turned off when photographing any of the prisoner artwork (which some if it is amazing btw).The only reason why i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a shame that the tour didnt go for 15 mins longer. The last part in the women's prison was rushed.  Not necessarily the guides fault when she has lots of questions to answer from people and her odd time constraint of 1 hour and 15 minutes. If you are considering a tour then please do it.  You wont be disappointed. After the tour you could spend an extra 2 hours just looking at the museum and reading up.  There is also a cafe, toilets and a little souvenir shop."
261,Great experience,"Good interesting:  all access is by tours, which are up to an hour long.  To leave the tour you have to be escorted out of the building.  Odd when the gate was open and the building was too."
262,"Main attraction in Fremantle, so a must do","Excellent informative ‘early convict’  tour. Gave a new perspective to many local buildings built with convict labour.Well informed guide who told stories that made it very realistic.Interesting site, but very hot in middle of the day as sheltered from any breeze. Not really suitable tour for young children as pretty confronting in places Eg flogging post"
263,Awesome tour ,It is great place to go visit if you are interested in that. There is a small area that you can view before needing to pay.Have done 2 tours so far and have been pleased with them both.
264,Excellent Convict tour.,"Excellent couple of tours at the prison which is well worth a visit.The imposing building looms over Fremantle and its presence is felt as you approach it. There are small exhibits, a shop and a decent café in the entry/reception. There are a selection of tours available which are not unreasonably priced: the convict prison in colonial times, the modern prison from mid-1800s to the early 1990s, the tunnels/underground river tour and the evening torchlight tours. Unfortunately my group had people who were unable to negotiate the tunnels tour (heights and confined spaces), so we took the convict and modern prison tours.  The tours are very informative and show you different parts of the prison site, (so you don't go around the same parts twice) and the history that goes with it. It is a real insight into the brutal social history of the colonies and subsequent civilisation that developed up to its closure nearly 30 years ago. Special mention to the knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides who brought the stories to life. Ian in particular was an excellent guide.Highly recommend a visit and I will hopefully be able to come back for the tunnel tour."
265,Behind the bars tour,"Highly recommend the Tunnel Tour  ... originally built to obtain good quality water for the Prison and later for the town itself ...Low galleries (about 5ft / 1.5m tall) and a flooded section where you float along in boats, paddling like a canoe or pulling along on the rock walls ...You need to be fit ... access and exit is by 20m of vertical steel ladders (yes you have to climb back up the way you went in ! ) and they breathalyse you before they let you down ... you need to be under the limit for driving ... Hard Hats and boots provided, as well as a safety harness for the ladder work ...Costs $65 AUDWell recommended for something very different ..!"
266,History of Fremantle,"It's shocking how this prison was still open for so long! Fascinating to be able to see the history of this place and learn some of the stories. It's a shame you have to do a walking tour to do it, looks like you used to be able to do an audio tour. But definitely a must do while in the area."
267,Listen to all the stories,Paid $7 to park for 3 hours plus fee to go on a tour. Would be interesting if you have never been to an old prison but I didn’t feel there was anything outstanding.
268,Educational & entertaining,Heaps of different tour options that would appeal to different people. The fact that the prison was operational not so long ago is scary as it is truly Dickensian inside.
269,"A very spooky, informative affair","We caught up with friends with young children for lunch at the Markets and then walked across to join the Convict Prison Tour. A perfect Sunday afternoon walk through tour to hear a bit of history and several tales about the prison and a few of the inmates it housed. Our tour guide, Janine, shared her passion for the site and discovering the stories of its history. Can’t wait to go back to complete the other tours!"
270,Fabulous guides and history.,Interesting visit and tour - knowledgable guide and interesting history. Exhibitions in the free entry part also interesting.
271,Must do in Fremantle!,"Unusually this museum seems to require a guided tour only - that is, you can’t go around by yourself. That said, we opted for the ‘behind bars’ tour and were put into the excellent hands of Sarah. Her enthusiasm and knowledge really brought the history of this place to life. We really enjoyed. One criticism- we arrived heading down from Monument Hill, saw the sign for the prison which (in hindsight was intended for cars) led us right around the block, with missing pavements, etc- unsafe and unnecessarily long. Suggest alternative signage for pedestrians"
272,Evening torch light tour!,"Walked up to the prison just to have a look initially but after a look around decided to go on one of the tours, mainly the early history. Really enjoyed the tour guide was very knowledgeable and had a good knowledge of both the local and prison history."
273,I keep returning!,Did tunnel tour very long way down. But very good safety gear and guides to help u down. Not great if fear of heights but they are patient with u the guides and give u the choice of going down at ur own pace or staying up top. I had fear of heights and still did it but I had the guide checking on me and going down was easy it’s getting back up that I freeze up. U do get a certificate in the end.
274,Fremantle prison tour,"Although historically interesting, this prison was in use until the late 1980s. The recent use, in my own lifetime, made for an uncomfortable and rather unhappy tour. Visiting a prison should not necessarily be an enjoyable experience. However, I am not sure I needed to visit this site as I pass by almost daily and this is a grisly reminder of the cruelty that human being sometimes inflict on each other. Unlike a Tower of London sort of museum, this museum and tour represent too recent a history to be anything but distressing."
275,Great experience,"This was one of the places i had marked down as a place to visit whilst staying in Perth on our recent holiday to Australia,it was really the Tunnels Tour i had wanted to experience but due to timings and logistics 2 of us took the Behind the Bars Tour instead.This really is a very worthwhile tour and it certainly gives you a very good understanding of the conditions and the regime that was endured by the prisoners in days past,and certainly nothing like the modern prisons that are more akin to budget hotels.Fremantle prison does not have the historic notoriety of say Alcatraz or even Kilmainham in Dublin but it does still give you the sense and feeling of what prisons were like in past times,the Execution chamber especially gives you a very eerie feeling and no matter what your views are on death penalties seeing where someone was actually executed hits home hard.What i also found fascinating were the crimes committed by some of the prisoners which i'm sure nowadays would lead to nothing more than a slapped wrist,they were certainly brutal times.Anyway we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would highly recommend it to others,and at £10.00 a time it hardly breaks the bank."
276,Fremantle prison,"The Irish man I've been seeing for over a year had his teenage kids come out from Ireland and we took them, along with my teens to the torchlight tour. Not only was it a lot of fun,  but also a great way of bonding,  particularly at the scary parts as they all got a little skittish (myself included), and ended up huddled together. When we finished they were full of the joys of spring and chatting ardently about their adventure. Great way to bring families together (literally), Janine our tour guide was especially good, and knows how to scare a crowd."
277,Well run and informative tour,"The Freemantle Prison is a world heritage site, there are paid tours you can take or a section that is free that you can easily spend 2 hours in, discovering an on-site into the conditions the prisoners were kept in"
278,Worth a look.,"I would definitely recommend a visit to the Fremantle Prison, it was a great way to get an insight into the early history of Fremantle. You select one or several of the tours to experience during your visit, we chose the Convicts tour, which was very interesting. Our tour guide was excellent, had a good sense of humor and was very knowledgeable and entertaining. The grounds and buildings were neat and well maintained and all staff were very helpful and friendly."
279,An interesting day and worth a look,If you are pushed for time you can go past the ticket office into the inner courtyard and visit the displays which are fascinating and give a full history of the prison. You can also access the gift shop and cafe. If you have longer they do an excellent choice of tours which run regularly through the day.
280,"Very interesting, well-preserved historical site!",You must put Fremantle Prison on your list to visit. It's such a wonderful building. If you're fit a visit to the tunnels is a must. Just incredible to think the underground water supplied all of Fremantle years ago.
281,Well worth the admission price,"A must visit, for anyone staying in Freemantle, very interesting indeed, good to see, what really happened"
282,Very interesting,"Visited on Thursday 28th November. It has so much history, best way to see it is with a guided tour."
283,"Well worth a visit, but be prepared for some sobering facts. ",Great guide (Debra) shared many stories about the experience of convicts and the early period in the development of Western Australia.Shocking conditions and incredible that it continued to be used as a prison until 1991!Very educational and affordable attraction. Definitely worth a visit.
284,a morning in prison,"Given I have seen the Old Melbourne Goal and Beechworth Goal, this one in Fremantle is fairly basic. No real drama items to see and the stories of the guide didn't really match what I knew about the goal after doing some google research on it. Paid 22 dollars for the convict tour. Too expensive for what it is worth. The shop is boring too."
285,Interesting day ,"Fremantle Prison remains much as it was at the time of its closure so it is possible to get a sense of what it was for its inmates, but only via a tour. Highly recommended."
286,"Interesting, informative and eye opening!","I love visiting the prison system that were built during colonial times. Fremantle Prison is the only UNESCO site in Perth. The guides are very good and engaging. You can see the different parts of the prison and learn about the lives of prisoners. We took the 'Behind the Bars' tour that covered the cells, the yard and the gallows. Find the tour exciting."
287,A pleasant surprise,"Brett welcomed us into the prison: as the gate clanged behind us, he announced ‘You’re mine now!’  It was unnerving going through the rooms where new prisoners were processed before starting life inside. I’d been prepared for some shocking tales about life for convicts in the 19th century, but the sobering fact is that conditions at the prison didn’t improve much until the 1990s when it closed. Brett was an excellent tour guide and handled the subject matter with humour and compassion, particularly when it came to the treatment of the tiny number of women prisoners, most of whom had been locked up for what would be regarded as normal behaviour today. Definitely well worth a visit but do be prepared for some unpalatable truths about the way people were treated by the Australian authorities until very recently."
288,Very interesting place.,"For many years in Western Australia ""being in Freo"" was a synonym for being incarcerated, a source of evelasting shame. Quite frankly, I didn't  really enjoy being in a place that has seen such misery. I've visited Pentridge, the Old Melbourne Gaol and Alcatraz and they all have their morbid charm.; Freo is much the same."
289,A Day Out - Inside Fremantle Prison,Last time i was here was good it interests me very much on how it was not all that long ago at this icon it like Alcatraz only on land and as old with many interesting stories to go with it.
290,Do all the tours!!,"One of the most interesting things about Australia is that it started out as a British penal colony. And one of the best ways to learn about this aspect of Australian history is to visit the Fremantle Prison (or ""Gaol"" as they call it). There are four different prison tours, but the main one that is physically the least taxing is the ""Convict Prison"" tour. It takes an hour and 15 minutes and provides a lot of information and insight into Australia's history. A lot of information about the prison tours is available online and reservations can be booked directly by phone."
291,One of The Best Attractions to visit,"A good way to while away a few hours. Not worth planning at trip to Fremantle for, but if you’re here, check it out."
292,Well preserved and informative ,If your interested in history this is worth a visit.enjoyable tour.A variety of your options available .
293,informative,Well worth a visit with historical significance. Educational with displays giving insight into difficult times of early settlers.
294,"A good tour that reminds me ""these are the good old days"".",It has not been a long time ago that this was a working prison and I for one would not liked to have been locked up here. The various tours available are worth the money and it is well worth booking a tour prior to arrival these are reasonably priced and each one gives you a good aspect of the Penal service. Staff are polite and helpful and the prison is worth the visit.
295,Tunnel Tour,"If you ask your tour guide why  Fremantle Prison, the scene of so much misery, wasn't simply demolished, you will be told  it is a work of art.. Each limestone block was crafted individually to fit in place. ""In Freo"" was, for many years, a synonym for ""doing time."" It was a good place to stay out of, but it  is an interesting tour."
296,Freo Prison,"Well worth a look round to see how Fremantle developed by the use of convicts aka Prisoners of Mother England, although Ireland and Scotland probably provided most convicts. If in Freo do the tours, good bloke taking the tours and making lighthearted comments of what must have been a bloody hard life back in the early days of Western Australia"
297,Couldn't wait to get out!,Fremantle Prison was originally set up for and built by convicts from the UK before becoming a high security prison. Situated a short walk from the main shopping area of Fremantle(The Cappuccino strip) the prison is well worth a visit. You can gain access to the entrance courtyard for free which has several small exhibitions areas and a cafe but to get in to the main prison itself you need to take one of several guided tours each about 1 hour long. We do did the True Crime tour where the guide takes you mainly around the outside of the buildings and tells your stories of some of crimes and history of a few notorious inmates. We also did the convict tour which is more historical and takes you inside the prison. Both compliment each other and were very interesting but we found the convict tour slightly more interesting.  The tour guides were informative and helpful and we would certainly recommend a visit.
298,Very informative tour,"The prison , now a World Heritage Site was built between 1853 and 1855 and was originally designed for people brought to Australia. It was later used for local bad guys (both men and women). The prison closed in 1991 and is now a tourist attraction and well worth visiting.The old houses of the management are attractive as is the prison."
299,A must for history buffs!,"So far there is only one UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Site in Western Australia - besides 3 UNESCO World Heritage Nature Sites - and this one is part of the 11 places that have been included in the 'Australian Convict Sites': Fremantle Prison, together with Tasmania's Port Arthur probabably the most interesting of them all.Hardly a tourist, who has come so far, will miss a visit to this place. To get here is an easy walk from the centre of town. First one will see the outer walls and the impressive gatehouse with two towers on each side and a clock on top of the gate.In the courtyard just behind the gate is the ticket office, a new café, a shop and the former 'Visiting Room' for the prisoners. Through a gate fitted with bars one can look towards the interior of the prison with the big ^Main Cell Block'. So far all is free, but hardly anybody will be satsified with it and will buy a ticket. It is only possible to go to the prison proper as part of a guided tour.There are different tours on offer. Since it was the first one leaving after my arrival I took the 'Behind Bars' Tour, which departs every hour between 10.30am to 4.30pm. This tour concentrates on the history of the prison as a maximum security gaol from 1887 to 1991 (when it was closed for good). The earlier history is told in the tour called 'Convict Prison' from the 1850's to 1886. 'Convicts' here means criminals that had been transported from England and Ireland. They were the one's also, who built this prison out of limestone. This tour goes every hour from 10am to 5pm.Another tour is called 'True Crime', leaving every hour from 11.45am to 4.45pm. Here one is told real life stories of some of the most infamous inmates. All these three tours last for 1 hour and 15 minutes. It is possible to combine two or even 3 tours. There are also two more special tours: 'Tunnels', going through the former water supply system, built by prisoners, on foot and by boat. This tour last 2h30min.Last there is a tour called 'Torchlight' (as it says: not for the faint hearted)."
