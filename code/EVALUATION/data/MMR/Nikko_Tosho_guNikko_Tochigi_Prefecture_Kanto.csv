0,Beautiful ,"Beautiful. It is really worth visiting if you are staying in Tokyo, only 2 hours away. Our kids - 8 and 10 also enjoyed it."
1,That's World Cultural Heritage. There is very famous animals!,"If you’re going to come to Nikko this is the place to go.  Very touristy (read: lots of people, even on a week day) and also a bit pricey at ¥1300 entry.  Also check out the equally impressive Taiyū-in temple nearby."
2,A Must Visit,"Highly recommended a day trip in nikko from Tokyo with JRP.A location very nice in the nature, all the area is interesting, temple, park..Location perfect also for a family or a group"
3,Gorgeous and stunning,"Great place to spend the day (if you still like temples and shrines)In autumn this is spectacular. Just bring enough cash, because card payments are most of the times not possible in the temples."
4,Must visit,Certainly a highlight of Japan.  A must if you are in Nikko.  Though try get there early to avoid the crowds as it can get very busy and ruin the ambiance slightly.
5,Just stunning,"Definitely a place I would recommend seeing.  A great day trip out of Tokyo and setting is just wonderful.  Lots of temples surrounded by trees, very peaceful."
6,Breathtaking Temple,Definitely a must go place if you visit Japan. It is magnificent series of historical monuments (39!) in a beautiful setting. It is peaceful and inspiring. It does not have the reputation of Kyoto but the main gate “Yomeimon” is second to no monuments in Kyoto and in itself is worth the trip.
7,Serene historic site,This is the only reason we are there in Nikko.Must visit although the entrance fee is JPY1300. The whole area is rather big and can spend around 1 hour to visit.
8,fantastic!,"Spent the day here and it is a very nice temple. 2hrs by train from Tokyo so it’s quite a nice day trip. You can get the bus outside the station to the temple.  One thing to note, in Japan you get on the bus at the back entrance and you exit the bus by the front which is when you pay.  Note the number on the screen on the bus when you get on. It will say your stop number and a price, you pay that as you get off.  It’s about 290 yen per person from the station to the temple, so have change on you."
9,Stunning,If you came to Nikko you came for this place. Simply wonderful. The temple is located at some minutes walk from the train station and it was easy to find. Absolutely impossible to skip.
10,Japan twice Nikko twice,"a wonderful site, of exceptional quality.I visited it twice, it is part of my favorites in Japan.And I will certainly return as soon as I can. I always discover something new."
11,Amazing tempe,"There is no question about it.This shrine is the greatest in Japan. After I visited here.I would like to write a couple of tips in order to enjoy Toshogu.1.You have to walk.You can use a bus or taxi.But you have to walk in the shrine.Japanese love walking.But if you don't like walking.You need to give up visiting here.I was not sure if Toshogu has a courtesy wheel chair service. 2.Please study Japanese history.At least, you need to learn Ieyasu Tokugawa's achievements. This is his shrine.You need to learn him.3.I visited here on April 17th 2019.I could enjoy sakura flowers(Cherry blossoms) It was relatively warm.But Nikko is usually cold like Canada or North Europe.I guess that months from April to October are a good time to go.4.Please respect no photograph policies.Toshogu doesn't allow you to take pictures at some of the buildings.5.If you can, please walk from Nikko stations to Toshogu.There are many interesting stores restaurants. There is a tourist information center between the stations and Toshogu.6.Please try local cuisine 'Yuba"".(tofu skin)/Enjoy Nikko!"
12,Winter feel of the Shine,If you only see one temple in Japan this should be it. Staying overnight inNikko allowed us to be at the temple before any crowds. We didn’t hire audio guides and found there was sufficient information in English around the sights to give us adequate background information.…
13,"Stands out from many other shrines, super ornate","Nikko is a perfect day trip from Tokyo. Very easy connect by Train. Highly recommended to get a Tokyo pass and reserve the seat at the airport. It's also highly recommended to try the onsen, there are quite a few in Nikko, but close during the lunch time."
14,Very nice ,"It goes without saying that this is the place you will definitely visit when in Nikko. The architecture is amazing and the statues and decorations also. It takes about 30 minutes to get there by foot from the station and about another hour to visit. A guide makes sense. Entrance is 1300 Yen.If you are in a hurry, you can skip the Rinnoji temple on the way, it’s not that impressive."
15,Nice,Nikko Tosho-gu temple it's a great place to visit. 2hrs far from Tokyo can be reach comfortably by train. The location is absolutely outstanding and fulfilled of spirituality! If you go there to visit the Tosho-gu shire temple buy the audio guide and enjoy the visit!
16,Amazing place ,The temple in Nikko is a Beaut and one of my favourite in Japan - nestled in the woods and full of colour and marvel.The bridge is also a good viewing point and right next to the templeWe didn’t have time to go to the waterfall and lake but looks awesome in photos (little cry missing out :) )We stayed over night in a real gem of a Japanese experience hotel Tsuganoki (expensive but worth it)Real Japanese food and premium diningAwesome Onsen public and private hot tubs on balacony of your roomPersonal guided tour of your room and explaining it all in Japanese (didn’t understand a word but was funny and got the point)
17,Fency,All the buildings and the nature around Nikko are very fascinating. You definitely need to play 1 or maybe 2 days for visiting the whole complex. I maybe come a second time there.
18,Grand Japanese heritage ,"This is an interesting shrine and we took a day trip from Tokyo to visit this shrine and a few others. Renovations to the main gate had just been completed, very shiny and clean and in my view detracts slightly from the expected ""look"" for an ancient shrine. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience, we did not feel crowded out although there were many folks visiting at the same time but getting a nice picture was a little difficult. Do take the many steps up to the reputed resting place of the shogun (but this part is not for old folks or very young children). You can take the shuttle bus from the nikko station but please be mindful of the timings in case you need to take the train back to Tokyo on the same day."
19,Easy to navigate and lots of photo opportunities...,Well worth the trip out of Tokyo.  We were on a tour so only had 90 mins to visit so it was more rushed than we would have liked.   The buildings are stunning and there is so much to look at.   Would suggest looking at the map and making sure you see the highlights.   Worth the…
20,Absolute must-see,"We were on an organized trip for veterans, it was not difficult to climb the stairs. A wonderful mystic place with sculptured temples, a city like a dream. there is a temple with the three famous monkeys and even a temple with a beautiful white cat. A must view!"
21,The World Heritage Shrines of Nikko are simply stunning.,"Nikko is a fantastic place, if coming by train your last link takes you onto a beautiful retro styled train up the mountainside to Nikko proper. outside the station to a countryside square. The village looks up the small valley to a forest of trees (covered in snow in my trips). If you wander up the hill you will find yourself at the start of the major shrine complex of Tosho-gu just after crossing the river. The stone steps and ramps wind their way up till you make the enormous tori gates. The complex itself has a combination of the more subtle Japanese Temples, but is also one of the most gaudy i have been to done in filigree and ivory. The carvings are stunning. If visiting i strongly recommend bringing your Goshuincho, or purchasing one to be filled out. (Just make sure to pay your respects first), as their are several spots on site to receive the stamp.I've been to Japan twice as well as Nikko now and will plan to make Nikko at least my one re occurring stop every trip from now. If you like nature and temple or shrines architecture and history stay a few days. Theres a lot to see."
22,Loved the setting and the temples,"Tosho-gu is the must see temple in Nikko, and probably your Japan trip if you can spare the time. A highlight besides Tokugawa Ieyasu's mausoleum was Honjido Hall as the ""Crying Dragon"" was very interesting.One thing I did'nt know until I arrived was that on May 17-18, Tosho-gu has a festival, something I wish I'd known before arriving(I was there the 13th).Also as most popular temples, if you want the Goshuin, make sure you go to that counter before exploring the temple, because most likely you will have you leave your Goshuincho(your Goshuin book,you can also buy one here) here and come back for it later, there's also another Goshuin at the mausoleum's site, but that one is prewritten in a sheet of paper for an obvious reason."
23,Temples and shrines.,"If you are in Tokyo, I highly recommend taking a short train ride to Nikko (1.5 hours).  There are so many things to see and do!  Just beautiful!!My wife and I visited from Canada in May 2018.  We walked to Toshogu Shrine from the train station - about 45 minute walk (one way).  The shrine has many colourful and decorative structures.  It was quite busy with crowds, so it may be worthwhile to visit during non-peak times.  That being said, Nikko is a very popular destination.I recommend Toshogu shrine very much!!"
24,BEST SHRINE COMPLEX I'VE EVER SEEN,"A great place to spend all day long.We do it by ourselves.We take nearly 5 hours to visit all.The principle shrine is tremendous. We take the audio gide with an electric pencil and a map that it was easy to use.If you want to go download the app ""navi nikko"" that its a free app with all the audio information without internet  conection,It make the travell easy.We were using the free wifi app ""travel japan"" that uses all the free hot spots of free wifi on the underground and stations and malls. Its sooooo great.We also used the app  ""maps and me""that do not use internet and is a gps to localitzate the place"
25,Well worth overnight trip to Nikko from Tokyo,"If you like shuffling around shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of other tourists then this is the place for you!In my opinion this place is too commercialized and it ruins the overall atmosphere of what is a beautiful collections of shrines. After hearing about the history of Nikko I was keen to visit here but I left exhausted and disappointed.Big tour groups ruin the experience for other travelers here with loud microphones, tens of peoples chasing after a umbrella holding guide barging anyone else in existence out of the way. If you are not obligated to go here because of a booked tour, please go somewhere else, it will be more enjoyable. The only quiet area was up a lot of steps where it was much nicer and a good view from the top."
26,Unique Shrine Experience - Lots of Stairs!,It's a great place to visit. Get close to nature as you walk towards the main shrine. Ieyasu Tokugawa's grave can also be found here. Don't miss the iconic three monkeys.
27,"Nice, big, expensive","toshogu shrine is a place one can't miss if visiting  Japan, specially one  has any remote interest in history & culture you can reach Nikko easily by car or train, how ever anybody who visiting  Japan and have done little research would know that driving is the least expensive mode of transport in Japan if you don't  get any traffic tickets, that is. January sees a moderate snow fall in the area and so it is advisable to be  preparedspecially for windy weather. I would advice to visit the museum first which is right before entering the shrine and watch the video and the movie before you enter shrine so that it is easy and much more relatable to observe shrine. Management at the place is excellent as most attractions in Japan. overall a must visit place irrespective of the weather."
28,Wicked experience,"Wonderful wooden sculptures and great colours. There are many steps, so watch out. We were there on a day full of school kids that came to practice their English with us. Was sort of funny, didn't really have a silent moment in the place."
29,Overwhelming Nikko Tosho-gu,"To see Nikko properly you need two full days. A day trip from Tokyo is tricky to do more than one of the following. - TIME: You’ll have to take the JR Nikko or Tobu rail to Nikko station which takes about 40 mins from Utsumoniya. Then either walk 30 mins into town (seeing all the shops on the way) or take a bus pass so you can reach all the sights. Get there as early as possible if you’re there for the day. - BUS PASS: about 3000 yen each for the two day pass. Or less for a day pass. It’s worth it to save your legs and time! If you only have 5 hrs then just relax and aim only for the shrines - Toshogu and other shrines: it’s NOT cheap to go around the shrines. To get into Toshogu it’s 1300 yen as an adult and 500 yen for the audio guide. id definitely pay to go in and get the audio guide to the main sights. Lots of explanation. If you get there early you miss the crowds. This will take about 2 hours at least! - relax over lunch: find a local restaurant to enjoy Yubu which is a local delicacy! - Shinkyō bridge: don’t have to pay 300 yen each to cross the bridge, you get to see it very clearly and get a better photo from the man made bridge right next to it!Lake and waterfall: if you have one day you REaLLY CANT do the shrines and this and also enjoy yourself. After taking the JR Nikko you have to take a 50-60 min bus to reach this area. Then it’s about 3-4 hrs to enjoy the walks and scenes minimum. Maybe take a sandwich, definitely take water if hiking or doing a long walking."
30,Beautiful! Deserve more than a day trip,"A must visit for any visitor to Japan. All the history, delightful Japanese intricate architecture, culture, history, serenity....all rolled into one. This entire place will set you back as there are multiple entry fees to different sites. But it's all worth while. Take your time and budget sufficient time to soak in the wonders of this place. We spent 1 entire day here. Can't get enough of it."
31,AMAZING,This is the must see sight for Nikko. So nice to wander and climb amongst the unique buildings in a tranquil forest setting. The main hall is still partially covered by scaffolding as part of overrunning renovations. This a shame but still a must see. It would be 5 star when that is completed. It can get very busy but if you stay nearby you can get there midweek before the tours.Recommended.
32,Famous building legacy in the world,What a great day trip from Tokyo.  The train trip from Tokyo was relaxing and once there you get on the bus that takes you to the Shrine.  It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and you will know why when you visit.  The Shrine was completed in 1636 and it took 4.5 million artisans and workers 1.5 years to complete the groups of buildings that are more elaborate and gorgeous than any other Japanese temple or shrine.  There are a lot of steps but it is doable if you are not rushed.  Especially the steps to Leuasu Toshogu's grave site.  One thing to know is that the Shinzo Sacred Bridge is an extra fee to cross and once you get across you have to go back across to exit that site and go on to the Shrine.
33,Stunning buildings but so busy!!,"Yes, it is worth a day trip from Tokyo! The bullet train takes you to the transfer station and the signs are well marked, you can do this.   The tourist information office in Nikko will set you up with a bus ticket, there is loop through town so you ride for 10 minutes to the…"
34,Wouldn't do as a day trip from tokyo,"As stated it is a major site for tourism. If you like the history of early Japan and visiting shrines, it is one of the best.The buildings are quite spectacular you can be in awe of the craftmanship.You are shuffled through a couple of significant buildings, walk past the burial site of the first shogun.The buildings of which there are many are truly majestic.It is a site worth visiting.Possibly not suitable for the very young."
35,Am-az-ing!,"Though a one day round trip from Tokyo, it’s well worth a visit. The trip out is a superb chance to see rural Japan with rice fields and small villages along the way. If you time it right you’ll also see cherry blossoms at their best. The Toshogu itself is a perfectly restored world heritage site that really does show the best of Edo times artful structures."
36,Great place,It is reason of why we are going to Nikko. Good place and so many to see something. Very interesting
37,Wonderful historical place,It is beautiful it is magic. It has to be done and it is not so far from tokyo so guys it is up to you 
38,Not-to-be-missed shrine in Nikko,"Amazing Shinto Shrine situated a couple of hours from Tokyo and easily reached by rail and then either a short bus ride or 2 km walk from the station (though the rather pretty town). The Shrine is a stunning example, combining Chinese, Thai and Japanese architectural and…"
39,Highlight of the trip to Nikko,"There are many places you must visit in the case you are nearby. However, this is a place where it is worth to have a long train from Tokyo.Try to avoid the crowd, if you visit in a predictably crowded day, then try to get there as early as possible."
40,Amazing,This was one of our favourite temples in Japan - the architecture is exquisite and there is heaps to see including a cat shrine! But it is very popular and full of tourists so loses a bit of its charm because of that. The surroundings area and little streets are gorgeous and worth wandering around in.
41,Big hordes of tourists,"There are a vast number of shrines you can visit in Japan, I liked this one. The wood archetype was special to me"
42,Worth the day trip to Nikko!,"There are so many temple and shrines to visit. One day is not enough! If you have the chance to get off the beaten path and wonder through the woods, definitely do so, you’ll stumble across so many hidden temples."
43,Impressive!!! ,"This is one of the most famous temples in Nikko, it is packed with tourists so brace yourself for the crowd! It is stunning and colourfully painted with many intricate details. Worth a visit!"
44,Great and peaceful place ,"If you like Japanese architecture, this visit is a must. I would say it is one of the most impressive temples in Japan. Very nice visit surrounded by nature."
45,Unbelievable! Must Visit!,"This is an absolutely must-see when in Nikko. My husband and I went to the other temples/shrines/mausoleums before going to the big one, probably best to do in that order. Get the English audio guide for ¥500 (we got one between the two of us), it makes the tour more impressive with the information they provide. GO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. The crowds, particularly the bus tour groups, get ridiculous as the day goes on. We went on a Monday at 11am and it was very busy."
46,Just before closure,Maybe because of a Japanese holiday it was very busy with long queues .  You can take a train from Tokyo to Nikko - change after 50 mins then another 40 min on Nikko Express . However there was a 40 min gap between trains so had time for lunch .  Start out early as main…
47,"Lovely, check out the dragon shrine","On our 3rd tour of Japan, we have visited many shrines and temples, but this is our favorite.  Still undergoing renovation and very crowded, the statues, carvings, ceilings et al are spectacular, all set in a lovely old cedar forest.  The only downside is the number of stone…"
48,Amazing architecture ,"This is a great one day tour from Tokyo. The tour I took also went to lake Chuzenji and Kegon cascade, all beautiful places but the shrine is the best. The woodwork, different temples, buildings, the dragon call, etc make this probably the most magnificent shrine I saw. The tomb…"
49,Highlight of Nikko,We were lucky to visit the Shine after snow fall to have the feel of winter in this famous world heritage site. The compound of this Shine is big and the buildings are very well preserved in each of the corner. Prepare to walk in on long and steep steps as the Shine is built on a hill. Visit in the early morning is a better strategy to avoid crowds from tour buses.
50,A wonder,"There are few places on earth where one can hit up 3 World Heritage sites in one day, so Nikko is a contender for the ""super achiever"" award if you`re a Heritage Site junkie.If you lean more to the Japanophile side, you cannot find a better example of the excesses of the early Edo Shogunate; if you are interested in Shintoism and the veneration of once-living people as gods post-mortem, then you also are in the right place.Even if you don`t fall into either of the previous categories, Nikko Toshogu is a beautiful place to experience traditional (albeit blinged-out) Japanese architecture, and see firsthand(eye?) some of Japanese most enduring motifs (like the Three Monkeys - hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil.) There are many structures to explore, but you are almost guaranteed a huge crowd at nearly any time of the day. If you can, avoid Japanese national holiday times and come here on a weekday... maybe it will be less packed! We went on a weekend and it was pretty much one slow moving line through everywhere, and it was hard to take the time to really enjoy the views."
51,Not enjoyable ,"This shrine is really big, and very beautiful. It is well worth the cost of the ticket. The beautiful black and gold was a nice change from the usual red color of japanese shrines. Also nice was going up the stairs that brought to the mausoleum."
52,Opulence at its best ,Nikko makes for a great day trip from Tokyo by train. Pictures don't do the shrines and temples justice In the slightest. I recommend buying the passes that cover all of the shrines as they really are all worth seeing. You will be doing a lot of walking and to see everything will take a while so arrive at a sensible time and allow for this.Its such a beautiful and historic place to visit.
53,Great 1 day destination for Edo Period forested temples.,"I think that this place is one of the highlights of Nikko.  There are a lot of remarkable spots to visit in the area.  All are different from other traditional Japanese temples.  In conclusion, it is a must visit place if you go to Nikko."
54,Los mejores templos de Japón!,It’s great place to visit with golden colored shrines and don’t miss the dragon cry hall. Not sure it’s worth going up the stairs
55,Wow,This was our second trip to Japan. Last time we only did Kyoto Tokyo Osaka. We saw the imperial palace in Kyoto and was disappointed. I imagined it would look like this. When you think of grandeur in Japan this is the place to go. The most beautiful building we saw in 3 weeks of touring.
56,A must see in Nikko,The place is rich in history. I think it is worth renting the audio aid . I felt it has made the place came alive .
57,A must see in Nikko. Wow,"Nice to walk around and see the different shrines. Make sure to check out the dragon shrine where you could hear „the roar of a dragon“, they had some explanation in Ebglish although the majority of tourists were locals so we found it very kind of them. On the opposite side, there are many stairs up leading to the tomb of the monk.. not aure how worth it except for the view from above."
58,Worth a visit....,"You can see why it is a World Heritage Site. Astounding architecture in stunning landscape. Having declined the audio guide, I regretted the decision as I wanted to understand more of the history than was available on the signage."
59,Kegon Falls and Nikko Pass,If you are in Nikko you must come to the Tiago-gu. Just take in to account that it can be very crowded.To enter in some area inside the building you need to remove the shoes
60,Awesome Sculptures at Shrine wishing for eternal peace,The Nikko temples and shrines are simply stunning. You need to pay entry to visit them. It's worth getting an english speaking guide to explain what it is you're looking at. The detail in the buildings inside and outside is really beautiful and worthy of world-heritage listing.
61,Wonderful!,"This beautiful temple is a must-see if you're visiting Japan.  Wander through the temple, admire the exquisite attention to detail, and soak in the history (it was built in the 16th century).  Specifically, look for the carving of the Three Monkeys, which are the basis for the ""hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil"" monkeys that are common nowadays.  It's a calm place, even when there are a lot of visitors."
62,part of a great tour by intrepid to get areal feel of Japan,"Travelers to Japan should visit this site. You can feel the atmosphere from the old days, and you would almost expect to see samurais around the corners. Don't miss out the trip to the Nikko Shrines"
63,The historic temple,"This was one of the first places we visited on my tour of Japan, I distinctly remember all of the moss covered stone lanterns leading to a pagoda and Torii Gate, the place was insanely busy with tourists and school children everywhere, I think there was a tomb at the top with a…"
64,An attractive historical shrine,It is worth to pay for the entrance. We planned our visit about 45 minutes before closure. It meant that we were almost the last to see everything and we were able to get beautiful pictures without a lot of people. I would recommend to do the same.
65,"Epic, gorgeous, fascinating",The intricate details of this shrine are just outstanding! It was such a beautiful place to visit. Although very crowded it was well worth it.
66,Great must see historical site,"Was skeptical about visiting a famous site in Japan, after having encountered zillions of tourists at other places.Was pleasantly surprised that this one was much less crowded and therefore easier to enjoy..I've seen many temples and shrines in Japan. Needless to say they don't hold a candle to Toshogu. Absolutely stunning."
67,A must see in Nikko,I traveled three hours from Tokyo to visit the Nikko Tosho-gu shrine and it was so worth it! The most beautiful shrine I've seen in Japan by far. It's full of history and in the mids of picturesque nature. I paid 500 yen for the English audio guide and it was great! Concise and not long dreaded as you can choose which elements you wish to know more about. I'd definitely recommend it to appreciate the place more.
68,World heritage wonderful mossy sprawling temple ,We thought it just another shrine but the place is huge. Very nice and worth a visit but keep in mind that you have to pay about 1300 yen entrance per person and can become very crowded. Plan at least 2 hours there if you want to see it without stress and take some pictures.
69,Definitely something to see - just amazing,"After reading so many reviews with good recommendations, my wife and I included a day in Nikko to visit the temples and walk around for while. At the station we took a taxi to the Tōshō-gū Shrine with a friendly driver for less than 1.000 yen. The temples are ok, but the recent restoration took the ""old-riginality"" of most carvings, paintings and buildings. It looks too fresh. There are many interesting wood carvings and paintings to be found at the different shrine the most photographed ones are the wise monkeys and Nemuri Neko or the sleeping cat but there are others such as the crying dragon and the imagined  elephant. After walking around for while we've decided to walk back to the city. On the way we've stopped at a nice small restaurant, sorry, I do not remember the name.It was nice day, but not exceptional, go there if you have a day to spare."
70,A lot of steps,The Toshogu shrine was beautiful and quite big. You have a lot of things to see inside and you can walk up some stairs to get to the top of the shrine. We were there while it was raining heavily but we were prepared. The good thing was that less people were standing in the way…
71,Amazing!,Toshogu Shrine is astonishing - worth going to even when full of visitors. Be sure to walk up the pathway to the smaller shrine up in the woods.
72,Amazing Temple and Shrine Complex,We went there and discover a beautiful place for sightseeing...The temples are magnificent and beautifuls!It is a place that you shouldn’t miss in a Japan visit.
73,Must see- tips below!,"My husband and i just spent the day at this site. What an incredible experience! I definitely recommend it for anyone who has at least a passing interest in Japanese history. It is well preserved and laid out. The folks who work there do a great job of explaining rhings for those of us who don't speak Japanese. The art works, statuary, and carvings are anazing! The views if the mountains and forest are stunning. The only drawback is that it is not easily accessed by anyone who has any difficulty getting around."
74,Most beautiful shrine in Japan,"Did this as a day trip from Tokyo, approximately 2 hours each way. Once in NIkko it is about a half hour walk to the temples. You can take a bus, but I enjoyed the walk.  The walk at times is somewhat steep if you have trouble with that. The temples are basically in a large park/forest and that makes them even more lovely. A guide would have been helpful to understand more of what I was seeing, but the setting and the temples were just beautiful and a nice break from Tokyo."
75,Amazing!,"So the first thing people need to understand is that getting to Nikko to visit the World Heritage Shrines (including Nikko Toshogu Shrine) and Shinkyo Bridge is something you can do by yourself as a Day Trip from Tokyo.  BUT you do need to be leaving Tokyo early, by that I mean no later than 8:00am, by train.  I will now walk you through the route I took and the costs involved, which I hope will be of great help to others.I was staying in Shinjuku so my travel starts and ends there but as Shinjuku is a prominent and easy station to get to my route could be easily followed.  Note there are other routes you can take but my research found the cost and timings of this one to be best.  So from Shinjuku I took the Saikyo Line (JA) 4 stops to Akabane Station (15 minute ride). From Akabane Station I then took the Utsunomiya Line (JU) 11 stops to Kurihashi Station (46 minute ride).  This portion of the journey cost JPY990 using a Suica Card (a train pre-payment card). From Kurrihashi take the Tobu-Nikko Express Line (TN) 7 stops to Tobu-Nikko Station (74 minute ride).  This portion of the journey cost JPY985 on my Suica Card.  I left Shinjuku Station at 8:19am and I got to Tobu-Nikko at 10:44am - So a total journey time of 2 hours 25 minutes with a total cost of JPY1,975.  All the train changes were easy and when to get to Tobu-Nikko Station simply exit at the main exit and walk straight ahead to the main road then turn right and walk about 25 minutes to Shinkyo Bridge and the entrance to the World Heritage Shrines.  To get back to Tokyo simply reverse the route.  I left Tobu-Nikko at 5:32pm and was back in Shinjuku for 8:15pm, so a 12 hour day but this gave me plenty of time to explore all of the Shrines and the Bridge.  Well worth the effort, not too expensive and an amazing cultural adventure.I recommend buying your tickets for the Shrines you want to visit at the ticket office located in the Tobu-Nikko Station.  This is far easier than fighting the long lines for tickets at the Shrines themselves.  I bought tickets for all the Shrines and by doing this you get 'combination' discounts.The Shrines themselves are beyond words, they are simply stunning and look great located in amongst the talk forest trees.  A very unique experience.  Do wear sensible shoes (trainers or walking shoes) as there is a fair bit of walking involved and some of it is up old steps.  Not much else to say other than ""Do Go"" and do look at my pictures as they speak 1000 words."
76,Uplifting experience,"Tosho-gu is a very important place to see in Nikko, but according to my taste it is  a bit over decorated. When we were ther it was overcrowded and we could hardly take any picture of the buildings or the garden. It is a ""must see"" attraction although there are some more amazing shrines in Central Japan.If you visit Nikko save time to see other local attractions too!!"
77,Don’t miss it in every seasons. ,Amazing piece of history. Spectacular building and surrounds. Wear comfortable shoes that are easy to remove so you can enjoy the temple and other areas where shoes cannot be worn. The workmanship of these buildings is amazing. Had a bit of scaffolding and repair work happening while we were there but still great to see. Walking up the back to the shrine at top is steep so comfortable walking shoes would be the go.
78,UNESCO temple.,The Toshu-go complex is huge and very interesting!  The shrines and temples within are rich in culture.  We also climbed the 207 stone steps to the tomb of the shogun high above the shrine which only a few people frequented maybe because it isn't identified well.
79,A stand out temple to visit,"I would like to point out that after spending the day on this trip from Tokyo there is so much to see around Nikko and a 2-3 days would have been better. The train from Ueno to Utsunomiya then change for Nikko takes around 2hrs and is free with a J-R Railpass. Catching the World heritage bus from Nikko station 500 yen for loop hop on hop off bus,this has got to be the most impressive temple/shrine on the trip . Spread over a large area within the forest ,There are many levels to walk up and investigate some great Japanese history/culture , this is the resting place of one of the great Shoguns to unify Japan.The ornate buildings/shrines statues are wonderfully carved and guilded , i believe this temple gets really busy at weekends ,during the week was quieter. Its a must visit if your in the Nikko area,Don' forget the camera ,  not an easy climb on all levels there are quite a few steps , but there is plenty to see on the lower levels also ."
80,Beautiful.,"This temple complex is stunning. The temples are so colourful and ornate, and the setting in the woods is simply magical. There's lots to see, so take your time and enjoy it."
81,Gorgeous! ,"Nikko is extremely touristy. And pricey. There seems to be a charge for entry to every temple and shrine in the place. Of course, this is the most famous. And hence, with an expensive entry fee but yet teeming with people. Yet, it does not seem right to not visit it being the iconic shrine of the area. This place is definitely beautiful, but it is hard to take in the beauty when so many people are jostling you all over. Which is a pity considering that it is a religious place of worship and steeped in history."
82,Wonderful temple landscape,"Most expensive temple I did so far (and not the most impressive). It is really nice though with all the colors of the temple from the recent renovation (still under renovation at the time I went), but Nikko in general is the first city I did which tries to take advantage of tourism with unfair prices for food, hostel, bus pass and even train (2500¥ for 40 minutes while in other places I paid only 800¥ for the same time...). I hope they change their politics to fit with all the others places of Japan. Not worth the price they ask if you want to do the trip from Tokyo in my opinion."
83,Lumps of falling snow added dramatic effect to the shrine,"My wife and I visited this place as part of our visit to Nikko National Park, during our 2 weeks holiday in Japan. It was very crowded."
84,The Greatest Shrine in Japan.,Really good atmosphere here nice buildings and amazing artwork. The forrest is very deep and sacred. Some good hours you can spend visiting. I would normally avoid touristy crowded places but this is worthe a shot despite of the amount of people.
85,Walking Through History,"Toshogu in Nikko is considered to be most breathtaking in the autumn, but I personally recommend a visit in the middle of winter, especially during the new year's week. Why? The ancient architecture beautifully contrasts with the snowy tranquil surroundings, making the golden…"
86,Great Building of a interesting History,We hiked here during our visit to Nikko. Quite a few temples around and this is one of the main ones but it is not the best we have seen in Japan.
87,Spectacular Shinto Shrine part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Expect crowds.,"It took over 2 hours to get there from Tokio, but it was worth it. The place is so beautiful that you could spend all day there. Wonderful experience!"
88,One of the highlights of Nikko,"There are a lot of shrines and temples in Japan but these are impressive and built in the mountains. I read that there are over 100 building at this temple complex.  I'm glad we decided to to stay there for 2 days because it takes a while to see most of it.  Saw lots of busses and train travelers on day trips probably from Tokyo, so you time is limited on those tours."
89,"Lots of steps, but worth it","We visited this shrine v(actually- a group of shrines) on the beginning of our group tour of Japan, but although we visited several shrines later, this shrine left quite an impresion. Actually, I think we did not spend enoigh time to enjoy and explore it properly. Luckily, it…"
90,Well worth the trip to Nikko,"Absolutely impressive complex, the best in Nikko, in a walkable distance from Nikko railway station (ca 1.5km), achievable also by a local bus. For sure a must see place, although quite crowded."
91,The path to enlightenment,For me this was the star of the World Heritage site.  Well worth taking your time and exploring it all.  There were a fair amount of people but that is to be expected.  The carpentry and carvings are amazing and I took far too many picture to share here.  You can't go to Nikko and miss out on this.
92,Must do Day trip if visiting Tokyo ,The ornate buildings and history of the UNESCO World Heritage site is just stunning.  There is no place in the world like it.
93,amazing temple,Wow . An amazingly beautiful place which was bigger than I expected. From the entrance through past the Yomeimon gate up the 270 steps to Leyasu’s treasure tower and ashes is beautiful. You visit the Sacred Fountain built in 1618 and the Pagoda . Look out for the sleeping cat carving. The shrine took two years to build and is the work of 15’000 artisans. It was a hot day when we visited and there were lots of tourists but it was still a pleasure to wander around. I must have taken at least 50 photos. I loved it all. After you visit take the left  road lined with lanterns to the Taiyuin -byn shrine which is just as impressive. It took us the whole morning to wander around these two shrines. Note this is not a good place for young children or people with mobility problems due to the number of steps.
94,The most ornate gate in Japan,Traditional exterior A really big shrine You may get lose there I spend 2-3 hrs there Better to have a guide to introduce the history to you
95,Amazing place even in rain,"Great set of buildings greatly carved and decorated. Hard not to go there when traveling to Nikko. Worth looking at the details of the buildings, lanterns, statues"
96,Impressive temple!,This is a great place to visit. There is so much to do here. However please beware there are a lot of steps and lots of walking.
97,Hilly,"Best time to visit is winter.The combination of forest, snow, and the extravagant shrine makes the 2 and half hour trip from Tokyo all worthy."
98,Amazing site,"I was strongly recommended to visit Nikkō Tōshō-gū when visiting Japan and I couldn't understand why since I had visited a temple in Asakusa just the day before. But once I stepped foot here, I totally understood what all the hype was about. It's absolutely breathtaking.I couldn't take my eyes off of anything. Everything was so intricately built and the architecture of the history of Japan just blew me away. It was absolutely stunning. Everything is extremely colorful and a carved masterpiece. I was astonished in hearing all about the rich history and culture of this place as I was walking around.And the Three Monkeys! My goodness! I had NO idea that the three monkeys that we know so much of were originated here (of all places) haha. Everything was so awesome. You don't want to miss it! Enjoy!NOTE: I was traveling with my younger teenage sister and she wasn't really digging Rinnō-ji (where we first started the tour) but she was just as amazed as me whilst touring Tōshō-gū (since it's definitely more detailed than anywhere else). So don't be afraid to bring your children of all ages to admire this gorgeous shrine!"
99,World heritage site ,The temple attracted the entire of my family sights and took lots of pictures of around buildings. It’s famous in the world so many tourists visited Tosho-gu Temple when they stayed in Nikko.To enjoy the many ancient times of amazing buildings would relax our mood. These are must visit one of the sceneries.
100,Very interesting museum,"We did this as a day trip from Tokyo and enjoyed it. We’ve seen an awful lot of religious sites in our travels and can be a bit jaded . This one, however is up there. Well worth the train journey and the climb up seemingly endless steps. Do it all if you can . Maybe not the inside of the pagoda though. We didn’t. It seemed pointless. It’s beauty is on the outside."
101,Wow,"We went to Nikko for 1 night and I wish we could've stayed longer. Since we were on a tight schedule we only did this shrine, not the lake. This was one of my favorite shrine!! It's worth a visit and you'll spend at least 3-4 hours here. There are multiple areas to visit so you could get lost in it. The grounds are stunning surrounded by tall beautiful trees. So worth visiting and paying the entry fee."
102,Beautiful in winter ,"WOW !!, What an amazing palace. The setting is absolutely stunning with all the ceder trees buildings. Some of the best architecture and use of color ever. This place is massive and very crowded. So many perfect picture opportunities everywhere. You need to set aside at least…"
103,Mind the map of the place,"There are no direct trains on JR from Tokyo, but it was still worth the effort to pay a visit to the world heritage site at Nikko.It is the most elaborate memorial I have seen in Japan."
104,Gorgeous,"By far the best in Nikko! I guess when you’re one of the most famous leaders in Asian history- you get a good resting place. I have walked up a lot of stairs and seen a lot of old, famous, dead people’s resting place- this one is one of the best! Well kept and easy to navigate through. Don’t miss it!!"
105,I cried (no joke),"Toshogu shrine was a beautiful place with so much to see at every corner, you should allot few hours to fully appreciate it. We trekked up to the top of the shrine which is worth every step but you need to have strong legs to make the hike up and then down the steep steps. The ticket we purchased included a stop at the Crying Dragon. A must see!! We all enjoyed the wonder of that place. Recommend getting there early. We got there around 8:30am. By the time we left at 11am, it was packed!!"
106,Wow what a sight to aee,"Clearly the top sight in Nikko. Try to go early to minimise the crowds. The museum next door is worth a visit, especially the video animation of the life of Toshugawa, with English sub-titles."
107,Beautiful place to visit near Nikko..,A national park in NIKKOU having mountains and lakes and streams and forests and falls. Please take having fixed-routebus and taxi.…
108,Most elaborate and elegant temple in Japan,"Easily one of the most beautiful temples in Japan. We arrived in Nikko pretty early and were treated to fresh mountain air and the gorgeous site of this temple all to ourselves. It was early December and the light dusting of overnight snow contrasted with the dark browns, reds, and golds beautifully. Your experience would depend on the weather, of course, but if it is sunny like it was when I went, your eyes are definitely in for a treat. Elaborate decor and unbelievable calm."
109,"Visit the Toshogu museum first, for quick historical background",The grounds and buildings of the Toshogu Palace and Mausoleum are most definitely well worth seeing (despite the crowds).  These are among the most elaborate royal structures in Japan from the Edo Period. Their beauty is quite stunning.
110,Reason of going nikko,"I Was reluctant at the 1300 yen for the ticket, best money spent to see any sight in Japan.  I was awestruck by this whole place.. no words to describe it, it is a must see."
111,Must visit in Nikko,Beautiful shrine. Lots of walking and climbing. The restored part is amazing in color. The children had a good time. I would recommend taking the audio guide. We did not and certainly missed a lot
112,The best temples in Japan,Although i am not a religious person but love this place for their beautiful architect and calmness..it's must visit place if you are in Nikko area..
113,"Expensive, touristy ...","Impressive Shinto temple, very big, with a monumental set of buildings to visit around the site. This is  the most beautiful temple I visited in Japan. Nikko  visit is highly recommended and needs more then  few our  .I suggest at list  to stay  one night there , better during weekdays is less crowded. There are  many different Temples, lots of history. A tour guide would be reccomended."
114,A rip off,This place is packed with tourist and travelers in the weekend. Be sure to come on a weekday instead.
115,World Heritage Site,"Likely to be your first stop when you get to Nikko, take your time exploring this temple as it has many interesting things to see which lead to some people considering this to be the best temple in Japan."
116,Mind-boggling,"This can be a day tour from Tokyo. Train access to this site is very convenient. There is a direct train from Shinjuku to Nikko. If you miss it, there are plenty of options to transfer trains. The local bus to Toshogu runs every 15 min, a day bus ticket costs JPY500.   Recommend…"
117,Most impressive ,One of many stunning sites in the World Heritage area.  Plan to spend at least one full day exploring the Temples and Shrines.
118,Beautiful Temple,"This shrine is a must see if you are interested in the history of Japan. Not only is the architecture magnificent (like every other temple and shrine in Japan), but also because it is the final resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu (although that appears to be a point of contention), one of the three unifiers of Japan. It was absolutely amazing being able to visit the shrine and I am very glad that I was able to witness it when I was in Japan. Be sure to watch the movie that is played in the nearby museum about Tokugawa Ieyasu, it is an extremely awe inspiring story about his life. The museum also holds some of Ieyasu's possessions which are magnificent to pore over. If you already know about the history of Japan you must come here to honour the legend that was Tokugawa Ieyasu."
119,Big temple area with many easy to miss details.,"We were told not to go on the weekend but today we got a lot of guided tours and schools, what makes difficult to visit. The entrance fee is 1300 yens. If you want to visit the other big temple it is 900 yens and you can't get a combined ticket"
120,Ancient temple on the hills,"A highlight of our three week Japan trip.  Absolutely astounding temple grounds...a must see!  Around every corner there are buildings, bells, & temples to impress!"
121,Nice Temple with huge crowd,"We travelled from Tokyo to Nikko. Took about 2 hours. Stopped at Nikko Train station. Purchased what the local call the “free buss pass” which is free once you purchase the bus pass. Bus pass Cost about 2000 yen each. This took us to the temple and then to Kegan Falls. You will need 8 hours to do Nikko and Fagan falls. Return pass to temple only was just about 300 yen and since the temple is up hill it’s well worth it. All I’ll say is, if you don’t make a trip to Nikko temples, you will be missing out in one of the most beautiful locations in the World. Get up early and go. Trust me on this one! As for Kegan Falls, that in another review."
122,The star attraction in Nikko ,"Quite large area, lots of steps, many beautiful buildings, colorful decorations. The walk from stations is not too strenuous, takes about 30 minutes. Frequent buses available, too. Read about it beforehand and you'll know what to look for."
123,Decent temple ,"Went here with my fiancé and it was absolutely beautiful. Of course temples if you're into that, but nature itself is just breathtaking. Take a walk up the hill and enjoy the peace you won't find many places."
124,Pretty but busy!,I visited on a Saturday and it was not crowded. I read a lot about that there would be thousands of people but actually it was OK. It is worth seeing!
125,Stayed all day,This place is absolutely stunning. The gold leaf rooves and the monks are so beautiful.  You get a great thigh workout for free if you climb all the way to the top.  It was pretty chilly in April fortunately that made the climb easier. I'd go back here again.  It's beautiful. Don't forget to pick up a charm or two.
126,Magnificent Ancient Japan Temples Shrine,At 2100 Yen for museum and shrine it’s not cheap but I think it was worth it . The architectural detailing on the buildings is outstanding.there’s a lot of steps so not suitable for push chairs or people with walking difficulties . The small museum in nicely laid out with a good dateline for the Tokugawa reign .
127,Festival,"A must-do in Nikko. The shrines are absolutely beautiful and pictures really don’t do it justice. Even though it was crowded, we had a wonderful time."
128,Beautiful temple,We went during a big night festival where everything stays open late for free and many buildings are open.  Great time and lovely place.
129,Worthwhile ,"Incredible place to visit, lot of temple, beautiful details, lot of people, opened only until 5pm. Need at least 2hours to visit all the temple outside and inside"
130,Go. Just go. ,"My husband and I visited Nikko in May 2016 on a short day trip from Tokyo. We walked from the station, and while it took roughly 20-30 minutes, it's a lovely walk, aside from the big tour buses passing by. You begin to hear water trickling in hidden pipes by the side of the road, and reaching the bridge was so exciting. We paid to enter the bridge, which wasn't really necessary. Photos of the bridge are really incredible, however.The shrine itself took our collective breath away. We had read it was one of the most ornate in Japan, and in retrospect, after the rest of our trip, I'd have to agree. The sheer size of it is difficult to render in photos as well. Nestled in the trees and beside rushing water, it's hard to imagine the artisans who created such beauty.For us, Nikko was a must, and we recommended it to friends who were going shortly after us as well. It was that good."
131,Stunning complex,I went to Nikko for Christmas 2016 so there wasn't much snow yet.  I went there to see the three wise monkeys and thought it would be a little bigger but I still wasn't disappointed in the trip there.  I was nice being out of the city for once.  I wish I could have gone back to…
132,This is worth the visit but it is a major tourist spot and is very busy.,Be prepared for lots of walking (and climbing). The place is a very popular tourist spot so theres usually many people there. There are also some small shops selling foods and lucky charms within the area. You can also borrow an audio guide to do a self-guided tour. Overall a…
133,The Most Beautiful Building in Japan,The shrine is an easy walk up from the station but it would pay to get a map from the tourist office as we didn't and had to use our phones to work out where we were - probably means we missed some lovely sights in Nikko.We lucked out in the timing of our visit and got to see the October festival where the deity is moved from a temporary shrine down the hill back to to his main shrine in a re-enactment of his original interment. The re-enactment is call the parade of the thousand Samurai even though there have only ever been 800!Very interesting display and there was good English commentary so we had an idea of what we were looking at and their significance. After the parade and the ceremonies in the temple it was very crowded so we popped to the museum to let things quieten down. The shrine complex is very ornate and garishly decorated. Got to see the original carvings for the 3 monkeys then climbed the steps to view the more simple tomb of the man himself.
134,Beautiful,Finally I visited Tosho Gu in my life. Very impressed for the Japanese style construction and the overall maintenance quality. Even so crowded but still worth to visit!
135,Active shrine.,"It is absolutely stunning: the temples, trees, grounds, carvings, and architecture.We were fortunate to go on a misty, light drizzle day. It made the atmosphere amazing and meant very few people. We loved climbing up to the tomb, even though there are lots of steep steps. This site is not to be missed- just gorgeous."
136,Wonderful place,Really worth climbing the 100 odd steep stone steps. Very ornate and loads of gold. one of the most opulent shrines i have seen.
137,Gorgeous Toshogu,"The Nikko Tosho-gu Shrine is a wonderful place to visit.  It is so much rooted in Japanese history to the time of the Shoguns and is an example of the power and influence they had in Japanese history and development as a culture and people.  This is absolutely a World Heritage Site, first class no doubt.  The architecture is complex and elaborate in detail.  There are over 100 buildings on the site and most date to the 17th Century.  In particular, the shrines embody the influence of the great Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu.  The artifacts contained in the shrine illustrate the power and great influence the Shoguns had.  A must visit in Japan."
138,Stunning,"Coming to Nikko Tosho-gu temple complex it is good to check weather. From my experience there is much more rainy days than sunny, moreover, rainy days are more often than in other parts of Japan. Anyway, having a nice weather You can admire all the details of the temple complex, however, during heavy rains there is not so many tourists ;-). The temple is one of the most impressive in Japan. The whole complex was financed by the son and grandson of Ieyasu Tokugawa after his death. There is also his grave, over the temple - worth to see. One of the calmest and tranquill places I saw. There is also one of the most famous wooden sculptures from that times: three monkeys - worth to see."
139,Best shrine in Nikko!,"As I was 5 mths and rather heavily pregnant, the visit to this beautiful shrine was a little tough for me because of the sheer number of stairs we needed to climb. But the shrine is definitely worth the visit as it is the only one in Japan with 12 buildings lavishly decorated with gold leaf and carvings. This tribute to the first Shogun of Japan, founded a shogunate that ruled for 250 years. And this was built by his grandson in memory of this powerful man. I would highly recommend the audio tour as while descriptions of each landmark or feature are brief, it is much better to know what is going on. As it is easy to just get caught up with the crowds and not notice the special features of the palatial place where the shoguns remains have been laid to rest."
140,Part of Full Day Must Do,The autumn colours of Nikko combined beautifully with this intricate and fascinating temple. It is an overwhelming complex in a peaceful and tranquil setting. It was the highlight of our time in Nikko.
141,Incredible ,The buildings are brilliantly painted and decorated. The temple is being restored but you are still able to enter and look around. It is incredible to see the work that has been done. You can see some areas that are chipped and faded then others where the gold leaf glitters and the lacquer and metal work shine.
142,Beautiful,A good walk to explore the extensive grounds holding different shrines where entrance fees are levied if you wish to go inside the inner ground of these shrines. A walk around this area is enjoyable especially a quick lunch at a Soba  restaurant located on the left side from the main pathway to Toshogu Shrine.
143,Large mausoleum complex,must-see temple in Nikko. It is quite large including the tomb of the General on the hill at the back.Recommended to spend about 2 hours visiting if want to look at the details
144,So Many Stairs but Totally Worth It,"We made the trip to Nikko on our own and not using any tour. To get there we use the Metro, the JR train and the bus from the station to the temple. We did not have any difficulty to get there.The place is lovely. It is located on the mountain, between giant trees; you walk and feel the peace and the charm of the place.The buildings, unlike the other temples we visited in Tokyo, are abundant in details and decorations: flowers, birds, and dragons, which show the talent of the artists who worked on them.Visitors can see the mausoleum of a Shogun climbing hundreds of steps of a stone staircase, which although it looks very steep, is not fatiguing, and if you need to rest, you can stop and recreate with the landscape.We went looking for the sculptures of the three wise monkeys and we found with surprise a charming place, which is considered Unesco World Heritage site and I recommend it as a must if you visit Japan."
145,Enchanting place!!,"We bought tickets days ahead for the 9 AM luxury 'Revaty"" Tobu-Nikko train from Tokyo Asakusa Station, and the 15:30 PM standard 'Spacia' for our return(~$75 for 2 which included their 2 day Nikko Pass). After arriving at the Tobu-Nikko Station at 11 AM, we boarded the included World Heritage Bus(just outside) for the slow trip through this overcrowded town to the bus route's highest point, then joined the tourists walking 1+ km up through the shaded forested lanes to the highest UNESCO Nikko Futarasan Shrine.  After the visit, we walked down to visit the 2nd UNESCO Nikko Toshogu Shrine, then down to the 3rd UNESCO Nikko Rinno-ji Buddhist Hall, then down to the UNESCO Shinkyo Bridge.  From here we stopped at the nearby Hippari-Dako Restaurant(quick delicious lunch) on the 1.6 km walk down to the Tobu-Nikko Station for our return back to Tokyo.Walking was the only reasonable option as the streets were only 'stop N go' with so many cars(only motorcycles could make any reasonable progress) on this new 2016 National holiday, ""Mountain Day""."
146,A must see for Nikko!,"While I can't say that I am a fan of the touristy town of Nikko, nor the natural park surroundings which only come into their own after the dry season ends, the temple complex is worth the visit.  The details, decorations, layout, and overall feel make this a must see."
147,One of the most memorable parts of our trip.,"Had a great time stopping at this world famous shrine. Fall colors were just starting so perhaps November must be a slightly better time to visit. Walk up to the Shrine entrance is some way, though beautiful!!Take the Heritage Bus looping through these places around Nikko. Day pass helps to get around at reasonably good prices."
148,Nikko Gem,Beautiful gate and woodwork decorations. A shrine of apes.  In a hot day it was challenging to move with the crowds.
149,Beautiful In Everyway,is one of the most beautiful old cities in japan great incredible temples surrounded by beautiful mountainsin the entrance  of the national park have the Shinkyo Bridge  incredible beauty bridge
150,"Brilliant site, a Must Visit","We took a full day trip from Tokyo and spent the entire day in Nikko to see the Nikko Tosho-go Shrine as well as the Jizo Statues, the Shinkyo Bridge and the 3 waterfalls in the area: Kegon, Yu-daki, and Ryuzo waterfalls. The only way to see all of this in one day from Tokyo is to take a private tour which is obviously more expensive but we got to see everything in one day and did not have to do any navigation ourselves. The tours we saw where you take a bus with 60 other people and only visit the shrine seemed very limiting and not allowing any time to see anything else. Obviously if you chose to stay in Nikko then you could probably explore the area for a couple of days.The shrine is amazing and is currently undergoing extensive renovation. There are parts of the shrine where some of the details have been renovated in great detail and look as though it was just created. There are several buildings on the grounds; some of which you can go into if you take your shoes off and others of which you can only see from the outside.The walk into the shrine through the forest and past the sake barrels and wine barrels takes you back in time. Depending on how much you want to see there is also a cemetery which is a long steep hike up many stairs.You could easily spend a couple of hours exploring just this shrine and since it is very popular it is also very crowded but that did not take away from any of the amazing views or experience of the shrine grounds. The day we were there was a week where Japanese children travel in large groups so we would often wait for the group to be out of an area or go to a part of the shrine where there was less people. Anybody could do this and get away from the majority of the crowds.I would highly recommend that you either take a private tour from Tokyo so that you can see as much as we did or go up to Nikko and spend a day or two so that you can see the area in detail."
151,Great ,"This is a great place to visit, despite some reviews here saying the climb is steep but we managed with a 4 year old. The steps are not too steep and there are plenty opportunities to take a nice rest with a view. It's nicely shaded and refreshments are available. Reserve plenty of time for great picture taking! Only caveat, the temple inside is very touristic and you'll be tied to the pace of the queues constant but slow walk."
152,Nikko day trip,"The unesco world heritage area of Nikko including the various shrines are well worth a day trip from Tokyo. Nikko is reachable by the Tobu line from Asakusa tobu station with a 2-2.5hr journey. The shrine is reachable by buses outside the Nikko tobu station, short journey. Entrance fee to the site including the Cat, and 3 monkeys is 1300jpy. The lady manning the entrance ticket sales is quite rude in fact as I enquired if discounted tickets were available for daytrip passes she brusquely said NO very loudly before shutting the window rudely and proceeded to another window to serve Japanese visitors. Otherwise the inner yard and the old structure is very well preserved however the restored areas look too shiney and plasticky. On a beautiful day this shrine is quite impressive as one can see the carvings and paintings quite clearly."
153,Nice trip in nikko!,"Nikko is so worth a visit, amazing nature including lakes and waterfalls as well as the temples, like this one of Tosho-Gu. The day I visited it was snowing but still the temple, the people, the spring colours impressed me very much. It is a extremely safe place, the temple is big and there are different areas and temples to see inside. I think I spent an hour inside and enjoyed it a lot"
154,Very elegant ,There was a lot to see with multiple temples. A few notes: you will have to take your shoes off to visit the shrine. The temperature is colder up here so be prepared. And it is crazy crowded.
155,Colourful,"The shrine area is quite large and there's something to discover all around the place. Buy a ticket and explore both the outside and inside of some of the buildings, wear easily removable shoes, and make sure you keep going up to the staired walkway to another section where a monument is kept. In September, the greenery really contrasts the reds and golds of the shrines and it's definitely worth all the walking you do."
156,Highly recommended world heritage site,"It is overwhelmed by luxurious decoration and elaborate making and size. When I was there, I felt a mysterious feeling as if time has stopped. The shrine that wished for a peaceful world was a very elegant place."
157,A beautiful UNESCO heritage site that is located very close to the Tobu World Square,"It’s a crowded place even on a rainy day. Paid ¥1,300 for the entrance fees and worth the visit. Could easily spend a few hours here. Rich in history but felt that the architecture has some Chinese influence. To reach the place where one of the shogun(?) was buried it’s a flight of 207 steps. Certainly not for the old who may have climbing stairs problem. The entrance is the viewing of the sleeping cat carving at the entrance of the door. It’s followed by crane carving at the second entrance. Then a short walk to the super long flight of steps.There is also a temple that you could enter to join in the prayer (if u understand japanese). And there is another prayer room (not for prayer) which has the painted dragon on the ceiling. It’s interesting and should definitely go in (May have a queue). There are explanations and they do try to explain in simple English. Good experience!"
158,the beautifull city of nikko,"This location is a must for tourists and locals. The stunning grounds, all lined with trees and well designed planning of streets and stairs. It was a pleasure to stroll this site. The shrines are well maintained and I had a wonderful day walking around. Great bus system where…"
159,Highlight of our amazing trip! Worth it!,"Even though it was raining, foggy and crowded, the temple is amazing. It's quite big, with lots of details. It's worth."
160,Wonderful temple ,"This is one of the best places in Tochigi Area. You can see the golden temples, and the amazing nature."
161,Stunning,multiple shrines in this compoundentrance has a steep staircasebig parking areavery good for long walks
162,Wow. Just WOW!,I went to a bunch of different shrines during my trip to Japan but this was the one that i was most excited about visiting. And it is definitely worth the visit if you are traveling to Tokyo because it really isn't that far away. It was absolutely stunning and it was just amazing to see all of it. The only thing that sucked was that it was super crowded when i went. But from reading the other reviews it seems like it is always super crowded.
163,Shrine to a Shogun,"We accidentally chose the worst day possible to visit this national monument. This is where the first Tokugawa Shogun is buried. The day we chose to visit is during both Taiwan, China and Japan national holiday. The line was crazy, takes about three hours to just step into the temple ground. No photo inside and the mob was just crazy. The friend who went with us did a tour in Japan riding Harley Davidson motorcycle in the past, they ran into barely any tourist at all. Sigh."
164,Worth the trouble to pay a visit from Tokyo,"Beautiful Temple, probably the most in one country full of nice ones. At 1300Y (about 11E) is fairly priced and easily rechable by bus from both stations in Nikko. It's recently restored and pristine in its majority and the parts with scaffoldings are due to finish in time for 2018. The only catch is that is quite packed with people although the grounds are extensive and its accesibility for disabled people is limited.All in all a must go."
165,Impressive resting ground of Tokugawa,This is one of Japan's best shrines in terms of it's elaborate decorations. Worth a visit but the entry price is high. Also make sure you go on a weekday as weekends are very busy with local tourists and tour groups.
166,Overwhelmingly Beautiful,A very beautiful place - well worth visiting with a wonderful museum which has a cinema which explains the importance of the shrine and the first Shogun.
167,Best in Nikko!,We spent the last week touring Temples and Shrines throughout Japan. This one really brought it all together for me relative to the history of the Shoguns. Visiting Osaka castle to complete the picture really helped. We did the audio guide here and it was top notch!
168,"Stunning building, beautiful surrounding scenery",This tour was our first one on this vacation.  It started early since we had to catch the collecting bus in Shibuya which is a short cab ride from Shinjuku where we were staying.  We opted for a cab ride instead of taking the subway because we were a bit intimidated.    The tour…
169,Largest and most Impressive Temple/shrine,"We came to Nikko in part to see Tosho-gu and we were not disappointed. The temple complex is amazing and beautiful with lots to explore. The temple is undergoing restoration but this did not detract in any way from our visit. Much of the area has already been restored and it is beautiful, giving confidence that when all the work if finally completed, it will be amazing. I would not miss this if you are in the Nikko area. Although we stayed overnight in Nikko for two nights, one can come to Nikko from Tokyo and visit the sites and return in the same day."
170,Worth It,this shine was part of a great trip which showed the real history and the culture.it fitted perfectly into the rural culture that was the small town in which it was situated .
171,Wrong day to visit,"We visited the temple on a very wet day (tail end of the passing typhoon) so not ideal for photographs given the weather and a myriad of umbrellas but, no matter, the temple complex is absolutely wonderful.  Worth the climb to the top for the burial shrine,  but there are lots of steps! A must do...."
172,A must-see if you are interested in Japanese history.,"The ground was grand and the surrounding forests and trees towering around the temple feels appropriate for the final resting place of the legendary Tokugawa Ieyesu.  There were a lot of visitors, both domestic and overseas, lining up to visit the shrine where Ieyesu lies in rest under the impressive bronze pagoda, which is located in the back of the ground.  Other structure and relics were all designated cultural treasures of Japan and well worth a visit."
173,Highlight of Nikko,"We have visited several Japanese Temples/Shrines in Japan but this one really seemed a bit different and unique. We observed that there are about 5 structures in this wonderful place including a very beautiful 5 storied Pagoda surrounded by nature all around the site. Also part of the beauty is the row of majestic trees lining the roadway, which is termed as the Cedar Avenue of Nikkō.However, to go to the main site, one needs to undergo a very steep walk (that involves hundreds of very steep steps) and that is quite an ordeal for people who are not used to regular walks. But I have to admit that even for an avid/daily walker, I found the walk quite a challenge but it was surely worth it. Once we successfully reached the top and saw the magnificent structures and shrines, all our troubles seemed to have disappeared :).For us the highlight was ""The stable of the shrine's sacred horses bears a carving of the three wise monkeys, who hear, speak and see no evil ""  The 5 storied Pagoda also caught our attention especially due to its history. Each story of the Pagoda represents the famous five elements i.e. earth, water, fire, wind and aether/Void.  We were told by a couple of monks in the shrine that this building was destroyed by fire in the 1600s and was later rebuilt in the early 1800s.We certainly recommend this beautiful UNESCO site especially to all those tourists who visit the Tobu World Square as the Nikko Tosho-gu is located just 10 kms from it.  Happy Viewing :-)"
174,Very impressive temple,"This is the most beautiful shrine I've ever visited in Japan. Every part of the shrine is carved beautifully. No wonder the ticket was a little expensive compare to other shrines, 1500 yen. If you want to reach the neko shrine (cat shrine) you need to face a flight of stairs."
175,Nikkō Toshogu Shrine,It is only when you touch and step in places like Nikko Toshu-gu that one could teleport back in the past and get and feel the vibes that are covering and protecting Nikko... this is how it felt for me and hope this place will touch many..
176,Wonderful Must-See Shrine in Nikko!,"Impressive Shinto temple, very big, with a monumental set of buildings to visit around the site.  Undoubtedly, the most beautiful temple I visited in Japan.  With a lot of sculptures and works of art to admire, simply beautiful!  With lots of Japanese history to learn from.  This is a visit that you cannot miss if you are in Nikko.  The temples are still in function.  I recommend visiting it during weekdays, since at weekends, there are long lines to enter and it gets very crowded.  A world heritage site, there is a fee for entrance.  Highly recommended!"
177,"Very nice, quite pricy, a lot of people ","It was not my first time to visit Nikko Tosho-gu, but it was great to visit this shrine again.This time, I got the explanation kit to know the detail of things which gave us a lot of information.  If you climb up the mountain, it might be good but to steep for aged people.  Beautiful and very different ones from Kyoto, Kamakura or other city in Japan.We went there by Special Express train of Tobu Asakusa line.  Got off at Nikko Station.You can take one day bus ticket and the bus brought us near Tosho-gu.April was the very good season, because you can also see some cherry blossoms there."
178,Amazing ,We spent most of our trip in cities so this was the perfect contrast. It was so nice to see a different landscape! The Nikko-ji Temple grounds were absolutely beautiful. The trees were gigantic and green and full. The stone walkwaysand surroundings through the trees were also gorgeous. The details on the buildings were so intricate and detailed. The whole area allows your mind to wander to another place in time. If you have good shoes and some energy I suggest the walk up to the shrine where the Shogun is buried. It's quite a walk up stone steps but it is beautiful and the burial site is quite surreal. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone visiting Japan.
179,Worth the trip !,"From the tourist atractions in Nikko this is the most spectacular, 1300¥ pp was the price for the tour, no english explanations, at least i didnt find them. It surprissed me the extreem busy decoration on the roofs of the shrines, beautiful."
180,Fascinating historical site ,"A beautiful, solemn place of rest for Tokugawa Ieyasu.  The buildings are ornate, with intricate carvings over 400 years old.  There was a misty rain the entire time I was there which enhanced the atmosphere.   An easy day trip from Tokyo."
181,Must see!,It was very calm & nice place to visit. Currently they are renovating the shrine. But this place is must visit in Nikkō as most of people goes to world square they hesitates to visit this shrine. This not just shrine it really master piece of Japanese art.
182,Vacation ,There is allllot to see. Not much is understood since it’s all in Japanese and the voice guide is a big help. Kids were mostly bored.
183,A beautiful heritage site!,The buildings look the same (from the ones in Tokyo) but the terrain is what sets it apart. It's located in a hill and there are a lot of things to see while you climb up. Try to avoid the schoolchildren's tour group.
184,Fantastic,"We reached this world famous shrine on foot in about 10 minutes after visiting the Rinnoji Temple. As suspected the place was packed even on a working day. Tickets for visit to the shrine will set you back by 1300 yen which you can also purchase from a machine using credit card. The shrine premise is fairly large and there are plenty of things to see in this wonderful shrine. Luckily only a portion of the roof of the main shrine is covered by construction materials. Before entering the main shrine you will see the 5-storeyed pagoda( although this is free to see, unless you pay the fees and go in you will have no idea about the magnificence of the shrine).The Yomeimon Gate is truly marvellous. You have to walk below the sleeping cat and climb  more than 250 odd steps to reach what is called the inner shrine which really is a simple grave of the first shogun. If you do not care for it you need not climb all these steps. Your ticket contains a tab for entrance to the “Crying Dragon” which are paintings on the ceiling of a hall. You have to remove your shoes( you can carry them in a plastic provided or leave behind in pigeon holes though the priest suggested we do the former).Photos are not allowed inside and a priest makes a show of hitting two pieces of wood below the dragon with Japanese commentary. There was a sign saying that English commentary is available. But when I pointed it to the priest he said “ No English”. Photos are also not allowed inside the main shrine. You will need about a hour inside premises. At the exit there is s public toilet. At the end of it you praise the Lord for giving you the opportunity of witnessing such a marvel."
185,Great place but too crowded,"This place is huge, not only the Tosho-gu site but also the other 3 shrines around it and the museum. It's very relaxing and the shrines/pagodas well maintained. All the sites are individually paid. It's a bit abusive since the travel from tokyo is not that cheap. And the information in English is very very poor. If you're coming from the Tobu station and see a lot of traffic, walk to it, it's just 2km (if you're not the typical ""non-walking loud speaker"" tourist).The earlier you get the better."
186,Simply stunning,"The entrance fee is definitely worth it. There are several temples inside the area that are all historical, intricately done, and equally amazing. Be there early as it gets too crowded."
187,THE temple to visit,Recently restored the sculpture rich buildings comprising this ensemble are quite impressive.No photos allowed inside and scaffolding’s are still covering some sections.
188,worth the visit,"This incredible shrine and temple complex is full of history, culture and for us even symbolism. We climbed the many stairs on a cold and foggy morning to uncover many treasures of the Edo era and learn about the first shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Surrounded by mystical forests and light rain, we reached the shogun's grave at the peak and immediately the sun lit up all around us, melting the last of the frost. It really did feel like we'd ascended a trail of mystery and returned as wiser and more enlightened people."
189,Beautiful ,Shrine was huge.  Had a Shinto ceremony for our little group with a prayer for good luck and prosperity.  Part of a trip to Nikko.
190,"Amazing place, very touristy",The sculptures are just breathtaking.  EVen I visited dozens of times I haven't gotten tired of it yet.  It's so amazing.  This shrine has the Mausoleum of the first shogun who ruled in Edo (Older Tokyo) but almost every wall has gorgeous sculptures.  A must-see in Nikko.
191,A must see ,"Amazing architecture,....some buildings are under renovation but that did not take away from the temple or shrines. A must-see in Japan!"
192,Unfair prices,"There are many things to see at this temple ground. You wont fail to see the carvings of the three monkeys. However, there are a lot more carvings around the temple area. Many of them made from single wood. They look extremely delicate and alive. Take your time to view those pieces as well.A bit further up the hill of the temple area you will find the cat everyone mentions. It is a small cut out sitting above a door. The door leads stone  stairs, that leads to a small tomb. It's a nice walk for those who don't mind to sweat a little bit. On our way out of the exit we visited the temple with the crying dragon. It was a bit confusing navigating the line, because apparently it was one line for women and the other for men. When we came in there were some explanations in english, but mostly in Japanese. However, the show the priest put on was well worth the time spent waiting(not that long on a week day). The interesting thing about this temple is that there is no echo in there unless you stand at a specific place (at the dragons mouth). The priest demonstrated this by hitting two wooden pieces together at random places and then under the dragons head. When under the head of the dragon, you could hear the echo of the sound of the wooden pieces - the roar of the dragon."
193,UNESCO heritage site,Both my partner were a little skeptical about the price (¥1300) but it was worth it. The temple is amazing. Define worth a walk around
194,"Excellent, but go early",Arrived in March with our guide being ecstatic that the gate which had been covered for restoration work for 4 years was now uncovered. Also we had the added bonus of an overnight downfall of snow. What an atmosphere with the walk up to the Shrine through all the trees. Didn't know much about the shrine but so worth the 2 hour journey to get to it. The town also looked interesting but we didn't have time to explore sadly
195,Worth seeing the shogun shrine,"This is a great shrine and temple, with many interesting buildings, design, paintings, and interior exhibits as well. It is also very big, so it is relatively easy to get lost without a map. This is a great getaway from Tokyo, plus note that the weather here is also much cooler…"
196,Good point for a day trip ,"This was a large complex. Much of it is outdoors, but there are two areas where you can go inside if you're willing to take your shoes off. Tickets were checked at the front entrance and the entrance to Hanjido Hall, which housed a roaring dragon ceiling and statues representing each of the animals in the Chinese zodiac. This shrine is probably most famous for the three monkeys of no evil carving, but I particularly liked the sleeping cat carving. Do beware that the sections with stairs, which you will need to ascend in order to visit Tokugawa Ieyasu's grave, are steep and numerous. I heard one woman audibly gasp when turning a corner to see how high they were and saw several kids slip (I was there on a very hot and humid day with several brief rain showers). Bring water, go slow, and be careful. All in all, this was an excellent stop and is not to be missed when in Nikko."
197,Great experience,"What can I say, it's a well-deserved world heritage site with beautiful architecture, made even more spectacular by the autumn colors all around.  We're lucky to be there when most of the renovations have been completed, and were able to view some of the artifacts deemed natural treasure in pristine condition."
198,Beautiful shrine,"Yomeimon Gate is my favorite.  It is called ""Higurashimon"" that means a day spending gate.  One may spend a whole day here while admiring it.  Tohoku means that ""the inaction thing over the east"".  Tokugawa Clan Shogunate, the 1 st shogunate Ieyasu, is one the most famous samurai leaders in Japan.  After he passed away, his grandson made a loyalty wish to Ieyasu. All artisan at that time were immensely famous ones so that gorgeous spectacular gate was made."
199,Shrine with spiritual power,"Toshogu is Nikko's centre-piece and I can see why - the complex is big, the buildings are ornate and beautiful, the forest is amazing. Do take the time to walk up the steps to Tokugawa Ieyasu's mausoleum, this was my favourite part. The design here is a stark contrast to the rest of the shrine complex, it's fascinating to see how different it is.I spent about 1.5 hours here."
200,Beautiful and peaceful,"I was not sure of what to expect after having visited the major shrines in Tokyo, but I was amazed. The setting in the forest is stunning and the artistic detail of the shrines made us spend much more time exploring than what we had expected. Well worth the trip from Tokyo!"
201,Worth the trip from Tokyo,"Amazing complex.  Temples, shrines…some of them are considered as the national treasury of Japan.  The five-storey pagoda, the gates (torii), the pathways…The Sacred Stable is decorated with eight panels showing the monkeys, one of them is the famous three wise monkeys.  Those carvings should not be missed as they portraying the lives of ordinary people. There is also a sleeping cat – a symbol of peace… One of the best complexes we visited in Japan."
202,World heritage site amongst the forest giants ,"During our planning for this trip to Japan, we did not include Nikko Toshogu Shrine until a friend told us about it. We decided to do a day trip from Tokyo and we were glad we did although it was 2-hours away by shinkansen, a change of train at Utsunomiya and a bus ride from the station to the shrine.Toshogu Shrine was simply awesome. There was so much to see including the famed ""see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil"" monkeys on the facade of a building, the sleeping cat...the list goes on. What was really amazing was this room where you hear the ""crying dragon"". The priest hit two sticks together and only at a certain spot in the room, the sound echoed like a someone in grief. Anywhere out of this spot, you hear the sound of two sticks being struck together.If you are making a day trip from Tokyo, you may want to either take a heavy breakfast or have lunch before heading for the shrine because there is no cafe or restaurant there. We didn't know that so we had a late lunch at Utsunomiya where we had to change train back to Tokyo. But it was a blessing in disguise because Utsunomiya is famous for its gyoza. We ate at the famed Higashiguch Utsunomiya. It is a small pink standalone building with large windows across the road from the station. You may want to try the inexpensive gyozas too. The staff cannot speak English so just point to what you want on the menu."
203,Needs to be seen In person,"This shrine is a exquisite work of architecture and not to be missed because of its beauty, location and history. It is one of the most original shines in Japan...virtually the same as when it was built. The details of the temple are incredible with thousands of tiny carvings and reliefs. Most impressive is the reverence that the Japanese hold for this site...you FEEL the connection they have to their history here. The shrine plaza is surrounded by ancient giant fir trees (I think) which are reminiscent of the sequoias we know so well in the Sierra Nevada of California. If you take a cab they will deliver you right to the shrine and it's a relatively easy walk up from there. Simply a stunning and very meaningful place, even for casual visitors."
204,a peak into history,"We took the 1,8 km/25 min walk uphill from Nikko train station. After we passed the famous bridge we entered the World Heritage site. The almost 400 year old shrine is simply beautiful and is located in a very natural setting. The site is easy to visit however a basic fitness is needed and it is not that easy to take all the stairs for wheel chairs. Water stations and toilets are available. It can be quite busy during the holidays and weekends. We visited the site during a weekday with a lot of school classes. Beautiful site and definitely worth the visit."
205,Magical getaway to an ancient corner of Japan,"Went in summer (June) and it was raining.  Very cold and windy.  The cafe owner is wonderful, on the heater to keep us warm while waiting for bus ride down the hill.  The Falls at the observation deck is beautiful.  Cannot image when it is Spring or Autumn.  The Nikko All area pass include the bus ridge from Nikko Station and also the Rope (two-way).  It is good to get a Nikko All area pass for unlimited bus rides and visits.  To top up a bit more to get the unlimited express from Asakusa to Nikko (2-way)"
206,Well worth a couple of hours wandering and exploring,"It was so beautiful and ornate. The adults liked it more than the kids, but everyone seemed to still enjoy going. We went on a Japanese holiday, so it was a bit crowded."
207,"Large complex with great structures, very crowded","Having visited other Japanese shrines, this world heritage site seemed to be more about wealth than a spiritual presence. Yes the colored carvings were impressive, but the cost of 1300 yen is only for the main shrine complex. It’s another 500/900 yen for Rinnoji temples with the stunning 3 images of the female Buddha. Be prepared to queue to hear the crying dragon caused by the acoustics in the temple and to gain entry into the main oratory."
208,Beautiful temple but under refurbishment until 2020,"Most of the buildings in this complex/park have been renovated and are sparkling with original colors. We had no trouble with crowds and were able to see most of the park in 4 hours although I think it is best to view it in a leisurely day walk. The main building is still under reconstruction and is totally covered with an outside shell. That said, they have done a great job allowing visitors inside to see the renovation in process. Much has already been completed and they have shown the details of the renovation in displays and view of the actual work. They started in 2006 with plans to finish in 2020 so almost finished.The God stables with the monkey carvings were enchanting and fun to see the original ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" monkeys who are the guardians of horses. The various gates have magnificent statues, brilliantly colored, guarding the entrances. There is no reason to book an expensive ""tour"" to see this site as it is easy to get to on JR line and with a Lonely Planet or Eyewitness travel guide, you can do it yourself at your own pace."
209,Ok,These falls can be viewed from vaious plaforms some free and others paid. You can also see the falls from the rope car viewing station.The photo supplied is from the rope car viewing station
210,Stunning World Heritage Site,"The whole complex is captivating, set in such a majestic forest...the shrines vie with the grandeur of  nature. I would say the trees win the competition, but the shrines are amazing...the detail of the carving is spectacular as well as the colors. It is worthwhile to bring your…"
211,A must see in the Nikko National Park,"Breathtaking scenery and has the remains of Shogun Ieyasu at the top of the mountain, takes 207 steps so be careful if you want to see his undisturbed resting place. The gates and ground are awe inspiring and it also has the see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil monkeys on the stables. The origin of the famous trio. This site is the reason you visit Nikko. And worth every yen. It is a steep entrance cost at 1300 yen per person, but definitely worth it."
212,Amaising  World heritage site,It’s quite a good way to go but very definitely worth the trip. Just be mindful that there will always be large crowds.
213,Nice place ,"Entrance fee is ¥1,300 per person. The most expensive temple in this so-called world heritage site. And what you get is the tomb and temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Nonetheless, the gates and structures of the temple are very impressive indeed with intricate carving details. The size of this temple is large enough, with even royal stable was located inside. To visit the tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu, you need to take 207 steps uphill. Not recommended for those with faint heart condition."
214,Very crowded UNESCO site,"We came to Nikko mainly because of the Toshogu.  The sumptuous decoration and maintenance done are simply amazing.  We were first shocked by the entrance fee - 1300 yen per adult.  In hindsight, we know that this price is only a small token in view of the money and efforts to…"
215,AMAZING!,"This temple complex is amazing. There are so many different areas to see along with the stables depicting the story of life represented by monkeys, the sleeping cat gate and the amazing crying dragon. So much history and a very busy place.Not to be missed."
216,A beautiful tribute to a shogun. Many stairs involved. ,Most elegant temple in Japan. Did not expect to see such elaborate deco. I was completely blown away.
217,"Impressive World Heritage Site, but very crowded",It’s all pretty cool considering this entire place exists to commentate a dead feudal lord from the late 1500’s who is buried here since 1617 atop a forest of ancient trees. A lot of emphasis on the dragon is part of the ritual and attraction. A bit expensive as far as admissions go. Be prepared to remove your shoes a few times.
218,Beautiful architecture,"The grounds at this temple are expansive, and it's built into the hill.  As a result, expect for there to be a lot of steps to climb if you want to see everything.  As it's also a relatively famous temple, be prepared to face a lot of crowds.  However, the flow is quite orderly and we weren't fighting to move around.  Give yourself plenty of time to take it slow here, and you won't be stressed about having to see it all before moving on.The traditional architecture is amazing.  The place is well kept; during our visit, the inner temple was in the process of being restored.  It was still open for the public to view, but there were scaffolds surrounding an inner wall."
219,A must-see for any World Heritage lover,"I visited this temple during Autumn October '18. Lovely large temple complex, however it was extremely busy, even on Thursday and with my partner and I getting there fairly early in the day- 930am. Lots of school kids here. Probably wouldn't return for this reason."
220,Day trip to Nikko,"Checking out we drove to Nikko Toshogu 日光東照宮. It is the shrine built to worship the first generation of Tokugawa Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu 徳川家康. Ieyasu is born in Dec 1542 December at the Okazaki Castle in Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture.He has struggled since childhood and is determined to end the warring era. He had established the Makuhari system 幕藩体制. With the resumption of order and the system to organize, promoting the industry and education, he laid the foundation of peace and culture for 260 years in the Edo period.In 1616, Ieyasu died at the age of 75, at the Gonfu Castle 駿府城 in Shizuoka, and was buried in Kunosan 久能山. Based on his will one year later, his body was moved from Kunosan to the present place. The second generation Shogun Hidetada 秀忠 then started the construction of Toshogu. The main structure of the present shrine is the one rebuilt in 1636 by the third generation Shogun Ikeiko 家光. Covering 55 buildings, the total investment to construct the shrine is mind-blowing, basically engaging all the best craftsmen during the time. It is now a recognized as an UNESCO site. Almost all of the present-day shrine complex was rebuilt in 1636, twenty years after Tokugawa Ieyasu’s enshrinement. Fifty-five buildings, including Yomeimon Gate 陽明門 (designated a National Treasure), were completed in just one year and five months. According to the shrine’s financial records, the cost was equivalent to ¥40 billion in today’s money. The renovation project was administered by Akimoto Yasutomo, the governor of Tajima Province, and the actual construction and carpentry work was under master carpenter Kora Bungo Munehiro.One of the special features of the shrine complex is the use of paths and stairways that follow the natural topography of the site, allowing the arrangement of the shrine buildings in a pleasing balance to create a solemn, religious atmosphere. The buildings are lacquered and decorated with vibrant colors, and the pillars and other structures are covered in a multitude of carvings. The carvings are not simply design elements; they convey expressions of religious belief as well as scholarship and philosophy.The shrine complex was registered as a World Heritage site in December 1999.Ishidorii (石鳥居) was dedicated in 1618 by Kuroda Nagamasa, the feudal lord of Kyushu Chikuzen (present day Fukuoka Prefecture). The stone for the gate was transported by ship from Kyushu to Koyama and then manually hauled over land to Nikko.Gojunoto (五重塔) was dedicated in 1648 by Sakai Tadakatsu, the feudal lord of Obama in Wakasa Province (present day Fukui Prefecture). It was destroyed by fire in 1815 and rebuilt in 1818 by Sakai Tadayuki, a feudal lord of the same lineage.Omotemon (表門) is the first gate at Toshogu Shrine. It is also called Nio Gate because of the two guardian deity statues positioned on the left and right.Sanjinko (三神庫) is the collective designation for three buildings: Kamijinko (Upper Sacred Storehouse), Nakajinko (Middle Sacred Storehouse), and Shimojinko (Lower Sacred Storehouse). Harnesses and costumes used in the Procession of 1,000 Samurai, (a part of the Sacred Processions held in spring and fall), are kept in the storehouses. Large elephant carvings by Kano Tanyu adorn the gable of Kamijinko Storehouse. They are known as the “Imaginary Elephants.”Shinkyusha (神厩舎) is the former a stable for the shrine’s sacred horses. There is a frieze of eight panels of carvings of monkeys running around the building, depicting the lives of ordinary people. Monkeys have been regarded as guardians of horses since ancient times. The “See No Evil, Speak No Evil, Hear No Evil” carving of three monkeys (三猿) is particularly famous.Omizuya (御水舎) is the building with the water bath to purify body and mind by washing one’s hands and rinsing out one’s mouth before worshiping the enshrined deity. The basin was dedicated in 1618 by Nabeshima Katsushige, feudal lord of Kyushu-Saga.Yomeimon Gate (陽明門) is a National Treasure, one of the most beautiful gates in Japan. It is said to have been given the name “Main Gate of the Imperial Court.” It is also called “Gate of the Setting Sun” because one could gaze upon it all day and never tire. It is covered with over 500 carvings depicting traditional anecdotes, children playing, sages and wise men.Kairo (廻廊) is the exterior wall of the building extending to the left and right of Yomeimon Gate, decorated with flower and bird carvings that are considered among the best in Japan. All the carvings are single-panel openwork painted in vivid colors.Karamon Gate (唐門) is painted with a white powder chalk, featuring intricate carvings of Kyoyu and Soho (legendary Chinese sages), an audience with the emperor, and other scenes.Gohonsha (御本社) is another National Treasure, with the Main Shrine consisting of the Honden (Main Hall), Ishinoma (Stone Chamber), and Haiden (Worship Hall). It is the most important area at Toshogu Shrine. Annual festivals and events are conducted here. Haiden Hall is flanked by the Shogun Chakuzanoma (Shogun’s Chamber) and Hosshinno Chakuzanoma (Prince’s Chamber).Shinyosha (神輿舎) houses the three portable shrines used in the Sacred Processions conducted in spring and fall (May 18 and October 17), while Kitoden (祈祷殿) is used to host weddings, rituals for new-born babies, and other ceremonies.Nemurineko (眠り猫) was traditionally attributed to the master carver Hidari Jingorou. This carving of a cat dozing while surrounded by peonies and bathed in sunlight is also said to be a depiction of nikko (sunlight).Okumiya (奥宮) is the tomb of the enshrined deity. It consists of the Haiden (Worship Hall), Inukimon Gate, and Gohoto (Two-Story Pagoda)."
221,Gets very crowded,"You can't miss famous yomei-mon(gate),but don't miss out to see three monkeys, sleeping cat & roaring dragon(to hear the dragon roar,wait till a monk invite you to come under the dragon). As some parts of maintenance work completed in March 17, the gate & the curvings are bright & colourful.This place is very busy, prepare for a long queue in holidays. ￥1300.  Combined tickets available. ￥500 audio guide available in English, Chinese. Recently, some of the national monuments were damaged by a couple of foreigners. By the time the authority traced them, they were out of japan. Whatever their problems were, they should've respected the country which open mindedly welcomed them. I hope this incident doesn't result in all great monuments incaged in glass walls or something. It's always the case of a misbehaving minority spoils  a party for a good majority."
222,Visit,The museum has a very good cinema where they tell the story of Lord Tokugawa Leyasu in the form of a cartoon film. The museum itself is quite small but it does have interesting exhibits including items worn and used by Leyasu. Well worth a visit.
223,So many sights,"This was one of our destinations of Nikko tour. Since it was the Golden Week, there area was over crowded where we got stuck in traffic more than an hour to enter. We had to park the vehicle far away from the entrance and walk. We took the steps up to the shrine which was so interesting. The complex is really vast and fascinating. Walking through the forest and huge wall fences will take you to centuries ago.  Can spend couple of hours by exploring the mind blowing architecture of shrines. Although the place is over flowing with tourist, you will not get distracted to enjoy the beauty."
224,It was good with color leaves,The Toshogu shrine gate is one of the most beautiful and extravagant gates in the world.  Currently the Toshogu shrine is under renovation.  Beautiful art carving on the walls around the main hall.  Highly recommended.
225,surprises at end of climb,"I came here specifically because it is considered one of the most opulently decorated shrines and mausoleums in Japan.It did not dissapoint. The location is magical, set on a mountain side amongst some towering old growth trees. It is faily compact, so can easily be navigated and there are large courtyards around all the buildings so I found it pretty easy to get nice shots without people in them. And the details are amazing - as a serious amateur photographer I really had a field day here!However, I was lucky because it was a beautiful day and train service had been disrupted to Nikko on the Tobu railway line, so there were a lot less people than usual. Anyway, well worth the visit and I will be back to take more photos."
226,A huge unbelievable and special place.,This is the main spot of Nikko. The ancient temples/shrines are very beautiful and cannot be missed. Also the fact that they surrounded by tall trees on all sides makes it even more beautiful. There are quite a few steps to climb and walk if you wish to visit the entire complex so be ready for it.
227,Rich culture behind this revered shrine,"Too many people spoil the impression, unfortunately of this most impressive Nikko Tosho-gu.  Try to go first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds.  Otherwise, be prepared for the overwhelming number of people...If you have time for Kyoto, you can skip Nikko, for sure.  For more info, refer to ""hiddenjapanguide"" if interested."
228,"UNESCO Heritage Site, Nature",Kinugawa is a relatively new onsen town in Japan. We went there to have our first onsen experience. It is extremely hot in August in Japan's Kanto area. Going to Kinugawa helped us to get away from the hot and humid Tokyo. We absolutely enjoyed our first onsen experience there.…
229,Memorable visit to Tosho-gu ,"Beautiful temple with amazing detail in the different buildings. Green surroundings are a plus to this monument. Please note that there are two ways to get to the temple, one has more stairs than others. There are extra 200 stairs in case you want to see the view from the top of the temple."
230,Incredible ,"One of the greatest historical shrine in Japan. It was really good with color leaves.  This shrine is for Tokugawa Ieyasu's cemetery, respecting him as one of the god of local religion called Shinto in Japan. Tokugawa Ieyasu, he was the first general of last Samurai era which…"
231,Stunning!,Last week visited to Nikko Tosho-gu shrine Very nice place natural beautyWooden art is wonderful Nice clean&maintained really memorable may be go there next time in summer
232,Great serene and peaceful experience,This a a big temple with a lot of buildings and a lot of culture behind it. One of the must visit places in Nikko
233,Big shrine,"Even for people who are not really 'into' temples, I think would find this one interesting. For a start the setting with the surrounding huge trees is beautiful and peaceful - if you can ignore the crowds - but the buildings themselves are so over the top with decoration that they are without doubt the star attraction here. There are so many different buildings that make up the complex and so many differing styles of decoration that it really does take some time to explore, and despite the fact that there was renovation going on during our visit, it didn't really impact too much or detract from the beauty of the place. A lot of signage in English helps to understand what the different structures were used for. Take your time and explore the whole precinct, there is so much to see. A definite must see in Nikko, which is itself an easy day trip from Tokyo. If you come by train, take the bus up here and then walk back, exploring the other sites along the way, as its then mostly downhill."
234,Amazing shrine,"This temple is a spectacular building which is currently encased in a 7-story metal structure so that refurbishment can be completed (see associated picture). Most of the artifacts can be viewed, and currently there is a staircase to the top of the metal structure which lets you…"
235,The most impressive place in Nikko,The entereance fee is quite high. The Goshuin is outrageously expensive here. Also it is quickly filling up with people. But the walls are decorated like nowhere else. I think togeather with the whole Nikko area it is a place worth visiting. with pros and cons.
236,A must,We came on a whim leaving tokyoat 8am. Arrived in Tobu nikko to discover it's an hour standing on a bus to get to the lake then a further bus from there to do any walking in nature. Our fault for not researching more.We joined a huge queue to get another standing bus back for over an hour . I'd say it's maybe worth a visit but not as a day trip from Tokyo. 8 hours travelling in 1 day isn't a day trip to me!
237,A gem of Nikko,"The temple complex is spread out and the structures as well as the surroundings are wonderful. It is extremely popular and crowded, so you don't entirely get to fully appreciate the beauty. We were here during the Nikko Culture week in November, and perhaps that added to the…"
238,Renovation & chargeable fees,Fantastic location and area but we just picked the wrong day when it was extremely busy and probably the busiest time (around lunchtime). We caught the train out there to use our JR pass and didn't stay the night as we didn't want to be lugging suitcases but you could easily spend a few days here and it would be great if you timed it better than we did.
239,Very interesting!,"Tosho-gu is one of the temples that have a hefty entrance fee as it is more of a museum than a temple. Of course the temple itself is worth visiting with its elaborate decorations and beautiful buildings, but the number of (foreign) visitors and lack of worshippers have turned this sight in a kind of open air museum. It definitively lacked atmosphere, but makes for some colourful pics."
240,Nikko UNESCO World Heritage day tour,Unfortunately a typhoon hit Japan the day we were in Nikko and the water was pooring down so we were wet even with ambrella. But the Tempel is one of the most beautiful to see. Even in the bad weather conditions it was very crowded.
241,Shrin- img,"Starting from the Nikko Shinkyo Bridge, it was about a 15 to 20 minute walk up the steps and a wide mountain trail to the entrance of the Toshu-gu Shrine.  As we climbed the mountain, we noticed many redwood trees in the surrounding forests.  In the main temple complex, huge redwood  trees nearly 4 feet in diameter marked a perimeter area.  Definitely a must see attraction when visiting Nikko!"
242,Great Place,"The reach decorated shrine complex includes a lot of buildings  in a beautiful forest. Many wood carvings , amounts of gold leaf  used to decorate the buildings in a way we did not see anywhere  in Japan. We looked and we were really amazed. "
243,Intricate carvings,"""Nikko Tosho-gu"" is a wonder, temples and gates and pavillions are superb, there are so many incredible details: wood carved animals and plants, fine engravings, golden leaves coating, etc. Take your time to enjoy all of these amazing buildings full of art, it's a pleasure for your heart and your mind."
244,四季を感じられる寺　We can feel a season,"You should visit here to feel sacred atmosphere. You can see many special buildings, gates and etc. On the late spring, around May you can see many cherry blossoms. On summer you can see many beautiful green trees. On autumn you can see the leves colored yellow and red. And also you can see some places covered with snow in winter. You’ll see different sceneries every season here in Nikko."
245,Must visit ,"Visited Toshogu Shrine during summer in June 2017. Getting here is easy by Nikko World Heritage loop bus from Nikko train station for 500 yen all day. From the bus stop, the shrine can be reached by 5 minute walk uphill. Entrance fee is 1,300 yen.  I must say this Shrine is very…"
246,Probably the most gorgeous temple in all Japan,"We took a day trip by train to Nikko from Tokyo. We stepped out of Nikko train station and caught a [very crowded] bus just outside. We exited at a Shinkyo bridge, a short ride away. From there, we crossed the street, went up some stone steps and made our way on foot to the temple. The temple itself is comprised of several different buildings. It's pretty spectacular with its golden accents, carvings, statues, shrines, lanterns and gates, etc. There are lots of stairs and be prepared to take your shoes off to go inside. Also don't miss the 'Crying Dragon Ceiling' room.We were there in the autumn when the bright leaves added an extra pop of color contrast, so I recommend this time of year. While in the area, we enjoyed a lunch at the cafe on the walkway up to the temple, we took photos of the Shinkyo bridge and walked to Kammangafuchi Gorge.If you found this review helpful, please click the 'thank' button."
247,Past and present in full harmony,Impressive temple and shrine buildings.I liked the hall with the roar of the dragon the most.Worth taking the stairs up to the pagoda.We visited in march on a Friday but place is still far too busy. Tons of people walking around which clearly impacts atmosphere of the place.
248,A Must to do as a top priority in Nikko,We actually had only a sketchy idea about the temples of Nikko and arrived on a dead day in town . Considered cutting the day short as we couldn't see much of interest. Decided to walk up to the top of the hill and came across a beautiful red bridge and crossed the road to see what was up the stone path... Awesome is how I'd describe the rest of the day. No crowds and the most lovely and interesting collection of shrines we'd seen. And i had been feeling a bit templed-out by this time. The crowning glory was the temple being renovated in the massive shed. We spent a lot of time here and got to speak to the builders. A fabulous experience.
249,Three wise monkeys & more,"We took the train from Tokyo to Nikko just for the Tosho-gu, a huge complex of about a dozen Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, and it was worth it. The grand and beautifully structured Toshogu, with its pinnacle standing at equal height from sea level with the tip of Skytree Tower in Tokyo, is the centerpiece and towers above the rest. One of the shrines within complex  is the final resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate that ruled Japan for 250 years."
250,Kinugawa onsen,Late in the day in late January we had the place almost to ourselves. Its impact and beauty cannot be captured by photos. The setting amongst giant Japanese cedar trees towering into the air is monumental and it's truly breathtaking. Be prepared for the cold if you go in winter. We walked from our hotel in downtown Nikko. Totally doable if you are a good walker/hiker.
251,Beautiful but very crowded,"The shrine and nearly all buildings at the site have been extensively renovated. They now shine and glitter in gold and vibrant colours. Whilst this shows them off in all their glory, we felt it also took away some of the ""historic feel"" - they may as well be in plastic, rather than what they are, beautifully carved timber.The day we went, the site was packed and there were long queues all over the place. It's a little hard to enjoy the serenity when surrounded by thousands, all clicking their cameras frantically.I don't know if this is a permanent display, but on the day there was a exquisite collection of bonsai trees on show. Combination of these trees with the backdrop of the shrine make for great pictures.I would imagine how stunning it must be if you can visit it on a quiet day, even better, covered in snow."
252,Audio guide is mandatory for an authentic experience!!,"Recently they finished re-painting Toshogu's some famous famous buildings including 3 monkies, the gate to Tokugawa's shirine. Used golden color and it looks so gorgeous with new white-painted-walls & old black wood. So so popular and crowded. Don't have to recommend cuz everyone already knows its a must-to-go place lol."
253,A rainy day at Hertiage site,"Toshugu Shrine stands different from Kyoto shrines in it’s design and ornateness, and on a misty day like the one we went provides a beautiful aura of mystery. There are many structures in the building, and a lot of the animal drawings have deep symbolic meanings. There are rooms to honor ‘Lord’ Ieyasu in whose honor it is built, and often need to queue in order to enter there. There is the crying dragon room, where they will demonstrate how it makes a noise when clapped. There is overall a sense of beauty and mystery about this shrine and it’s uniqueness in design makes it well-worth visiting. At 1300 yen a head, it’s definitely expensive.  We didn’t go past sleeping cast to climb stairs as we were already very tired in our trip and didn’t want to do more to exhaust our feet."
254,Fabulous,A remote site nestled amongst Mother Nature demanding respect and solitude. Definitely a place of majesty and awe of old Shogun days.Well worth the long car trip from Tokyo!
255,Amazing Shrine of a Lifetime!,"Nikko Tosho-gu should be one of the best temple in Nikko. However this temple is always packed with visitors despite that you have to pay 1,500 yen entrance fee to see the internal parts of the temple."
256,A wonderful shrine in Nikko and perhaps even more impressive than the lake,"Very easy to access, the five storey pagoda at the entrance to the Toshogu Shrine is at the end of a wide pathway lined with huge trees, and, in autumn the colours are magnificent.  The shrine is the mausoleum of the founder of the shogunate which ruled Japan for more than 250 years.  The buildings, which are 17th century, are most ornately carved.  Very busy though with lots of visitors, so allow plenty of time for your visit, but it is a must see."
257,Top shrine in Nikko (or Japan even),"This shrine honouring the mighty shogun Toshogu is truly magnificent. Several buildings and structures with intricate carvings and beautiful roofing, including a chinese-style pagoda. Very good english-language brochures explaining every detail are available. We went in October 2018 (the checkbox did not allow me to select an earlier date than November 2018..."
258,Amazing place! No miss!,Visited in February after a fresh snow fall the day before so it was beautifully blanketed in fresh powdery snow.The snow added a magical spell to the whole place.Occasionally the trees would shed its blanket of snow so one may get covered with snow while walking beneath the trees..
259,Magical Nikko,"When you disembark the bus you will follow a path through a wooded area before entering the shrine. At this point stay focused and look for a landmark where to make your turn when you exit. When you enter, the guide will inform you that you will view the shrine at your own pace (see the photos below). When you exit through the tall wooden torii gate you will see a few paths that go through wooded areas to different lots and they all look similar. Remember the landmark when you entered. It rained steady when I was there, looking at others photos it seems the same held true, so be prepared."
260,Top most shrine to visit in Nikko,"First, let me talk about the only annoying thing about coming here -- the CROWD.  It's packed.  We came on a weekday, and it was still packed.  BUT if you're patient and have lightning reflexes, you WILL still be able to find gaps in the crowd to take photos of the Torii, Youmeimon and other spots without any photobombers.  For this, you'll need to keep your cameras at the ready.  (It also helps if you have a fast cameraphone.)NOTE though that the temple is undergoing restorations.  Parts of it are covered in tarpaulin."
261,'Historic Shrine',"Beside Hakone and Mount Fuji, Nikko is one the most popular tourist destinations in Japan. And Toshogu is the highlight of Nikko. Not just the grave of Ieyasu, but Yomeimon Gate and other constructions are really worth taking a look. You shouldn’t overlook some sculptures like “sleeping cat” or “three monkeys”. You can rent an audio guide in English for $5 at the main gate. Then you can better understand the history."
262,Amazing shrine and location,"It was too crowded to enjoy such a historical place. With a heaving crowd, it was hard to take good pictures of the shrines, without people standing in front of it. Perhaps do a research on when is the best time to visit during off peak season ."
263,Three Monkeys,It was interesting to see this place for its rich culture and history that dates back to the Edo period.  It was good that we joined a tour group (Sunrise Tours JTB) as the tour guide was able to explain (in English) the many stories behind this place and why it is often visited.
264,Beautiful temple,"Starting from the famous red Shinkyo bridge crossing the Daiya river, where everyone competes to get a pic, you can make your way, uphill towards the Tosho-gu shrine. It’s a bit of a hike and plenty of slippery steps but nothing too strenuous unless you’re really out of shape.…"
265,Beautiful shrine,"Mostly temples and shrines. We didnt do a guided tour, but maybe that would have made a big difference. Information is scarcely displayed, so it felt kind of empty. Worth the time, but not when on a tight itenary. There are more impressive trips around the city."
266,Attend the prayer in the main shrine ,Main gate of Tosho-gu has been recently restored and completed. You can now explore most of the shrine. The architecture and ornamentation are uniquely different from other Shinto shrines in Japan as this was built in the period when Buddhism mixed with Shinto in a special way. It is good to spent enough time at this place to see the details. English and other language audio guides are available for additional 500 yen ($5).
267,Longest Journey By Local Trains!,"A stunning monument with gilded roofs, stone walls and mossy ground set in a forest of very tall cedar trees. It felt very peaceful despite a huge crowd of visitors. It will be much more enjoyable during the off peak season without the crowd. This site is very much catered to local Japanese tourists so be prepared to see  very few signs in English."
268,"Interesting, but optional","The shrine / tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu is well worth a visit. Don't stop at the Rinno-Ji (currently being restored inside a huge 7-story tall shed), but turn left and keep walking up the hill.  The road(?) is wide, and flanked by majestic trees, and when you reach the torii gate,…"
269,A glimpse inside the Japanese heart,Very grand Japanese heritage and require minimum two hour on Sunday due to the crowd and size of area. There are long queue to enter each area. The parking system is good coordinated by people and cost 600YEN and there are multiple parking spots.
270,Very busy on the weekend which somewhat ruined the experience.,"It was April and I didn't quite expect Nikko to be that cold, coming from a 'humid' country I was surprised.  The details of the deities to the intricate structure, all in all Nikko Toshogu was stunning to look at.  Expect huge crowds to be in great awe.  I took the World Heritage bus (having World Heritage pass gives me free bus rides)  I thought I could just be skipping Nikko Toshogu for 30 mins, but I was surprised it took me average of 2 hours tops to visit nearby shrines as well.  Kosanji (in Setoda) and Nikko would be one of my best highlights as I am eager to discover new shrines outside or further from Tokyo."
271,Remember where the bus parked,"We visited Nikko Tosho-gu some time end-Jan, and Nikko Tosho-gu was a great walk! I believe we were there after the refurbishment and boy - what a sight it was! The gold gleaming in the sunlight with snow in the backdrop. It was a magical short hike!"
272,Must see in Nikko,"Unfortuntely, it was rainning heavily during our visit to Nikko.  We visited Tosho-gu under rain, not much enjoyed. I believed it would be prefect if under no rain. There were several temples one should be missed. It is easily to access, several bus from training station will…"
273,Best temples seen so far,"We took the Tobu line from Asakusa to Nikko. Nikko is a world heritage site founded by the Buddhist monk, Shado Shomin. Entrance to the shrine is via the Niomon gate. To the left after the entrance are the storehouses and the sacred stable with the famous three wise monkeys carving. The whole area is massive and there are many steps to negotiate. Very ostentatious gates and pillars throughout You can visit the Honjido with its dragon ceiling. Many people are crowded into this and the priest gives a demonstration of the dragon ‘roaring’You can walk to this from the station though buses are available"
274,Amazing place !,"When we arrived at the main gate of Nikko Tosho-gu, we were greeted by five stories pagoda which was claimed to have the same height as the Tokyo Skytree Tower. We needs to pay an entrance fee if I'm not mistaken is about 1.200 yen. It's actually expensive compared to other common entrance fee of a shrine. But as expected, it was expensive because the place was spacious. The ornaments on the wall were impressive. You need to take a lot of steps to reach the top. As good as it is, for me I don't find there was much to do or see inside."
275,A must see Shrine!,Entrance fee was a bit high but definitely worth The view very beautiful very clean downside kind of crowded.
276,Stunning,"Impressive period architecture and everything was very well preserved. Good combination of Japanese and Chinese elements in many of the structures there, and interesting mix of Shindo (shrine) and Buddhist (temple) in one compound. Photos taking is only allowed in outdoor areas. A worthy place to spend 2 hours walking around before proceeding to other places of attraction in Nikko."
277,Awesome!,"Nikko Tosho-gu is located in a remote part in Japan, well north of Tokyo. The shrine itself is grand and magnificent, a 15-20 minute walk from most car parks in Nikko and a necessity if you are lucky enough to be staying in the Japanese countryside. After walking through the…"
278,Beautiful place.  Even more beautiful if you're a fan of Sengoku Jidai.  Because TOKUGAWA!,"Wanted to go to Mt Fuji 5th station but was advised against it due to cloudy weather. So did not book a group tour for the next day. The girls at Ikebukuro JR East office suggested not to book any type of outdoor tours due to the rainy season but  if weather is good go to Nikko. Could not buy the Nikko All Area Pass at Yen 4,520.00 at Asakusa too late to book online or too early to buy from the office in Asakusa. There's a JR direct train from Ikebukuro to Nikko but one way is Yen3,800. We wanted to go by the cheapest way. That's why we ended going the long long way by local trains. Next day 6.30am we took the train from Ikebukuro station to Akabane. From Akabane to Utsunomiya Station. From Utsunomiya to Nikko station.  Finally we arrive at 9.15am I think. Then bought a Yen2,000 return ticket to Chuzenji Onsen. The road up to Chuzenji Onsen was really winding and have many sharp turns. The bus driver was a real expert slow and steady and I didn't throw up my breakfast.Anyway around 40 minutes or more we reach the bus stop and walked to the Kegon waterfall. Spectacular. Wished I could swim in the water at the bottom of the falls. So blue the water! After the falls, we walked towards Chuzenji lake. On the way there we ate soft ice cream and had a piece of cheese cake. Just spent less than an hour. Took the bus back to Toshu-go Shrine. A bit of walk up the hill and on the dot noon we reach the walkway entrance to the shrine. We could hear church bells ringing and at the same time the temple gong sounded. It felt really strange hearing this two together like they were talking to each other. The bells kept ringing and the gong kept going a few time. It was mesmerizing watching that person pulling and releasing the tree trunk I think to hit the gong. I don't know if they do this everyday at noon. But try getting there at noon maybe you get to experience this special moment. Anyway the reason we came to Nikko was of course to see the famous shrine. Really crowded. Hordes of people crowding around the 3 wise monkeys trying to take the best pictures. Really beautiful. Every nook and corners of the shrine you can see amazing delicate cravings. But I feel the best part was the huge and majestic cedar trees  lining the walk up to the bronze urn of the Shogun Leyasuremains. Well worth the long hours spent on the train visiting this magnificent place. Sorry for the long winded report cos I just could not get over how beautiful the place is and how long the return journey back was by local train. Warning: not for those with weak necks cos there's no head rest all the way. And you could be standing some parts of the journey.Plan early and cheaper to buy the pass of course. Even our cheap journey cost us around Yen7,200 per person return."
279,"A ""must see"" world heritage site that is an easy day trip from Tokyo","One of the most attractive and beautiful shrine in Japan especially around this area. Because of its objective of construction and its age since being constructed, it makes this place sacred and fulfilling with many hidden meaning around place, like, cat and bird, and three…"
280,Renovated,"The Tosho-gu located at Nikko is an amazing collection of fortifications and buildings dedicated and built during the Edo period ruled by the Tokugawa family (Shogunate). You literally stride through history following in the footsteps of samurai & the shoguns. As you walk underneath the Torii gates, marvel at the 5-story pagoda with it's center pole designed to withstand earthquakes (light years ahead of it's time), the Yōmeimon (Gate of Sunlight) that is literally jaw-dropping in it's beauty and intricate detail. Traversing the walkway and stairs (207) that lead to the tomb of Ieyasu Tokugawa, take a moment to look out & realize you are standing in the same spots where samurai once stood guard. To view everything one should plan on spending at least a day & even then you will not see everything. There is considerable walking involved so prepare accordingly with appropriate clothing & footwear, but you will need to slip your shoes off to enter some of the structures. Tosho-gu is not to be missed & cannot wait to return."
281,Recently re-painted!,"the iconic beautiful astonishing remarkable shrines in Nikko,the elaborated decoration was so impressive, the charming of manificient surrounding forrest environment has given a magical attractive power and wonderful unforgettable experience.this place has been preserved and well maintained, and definitely worth for visiting place."
282,Why to go to Nikko,"Not going to tell you all the history. Not going to tell you just how beautiful it is. Just going to tell you to go. Take comfortable slip off shoes as you will be walking a lot and taking your shoes off constantly. Bring some 500 and 100 yen coins to buy candles, blessing, fortunes and talismans. It is spectacular."
283,Shrine in beautiful forest,"First animals is sleeping cat that called NEMURI-NEKO.2 tree sparrow was back side the sleeping cat and that is to mean the peaceful years of the Edo period（1603-1868）Second animals are 3 wise monkeys,MIZARU・IWAZARU・KIKAZARU.that is to mean see no evil,speak no evil,hear no evil,that monkeys portrayed of life.Thirdly,NAKI-RYU is drowned ceiling oriental dragon. Buddhist priest perform on a certain location,the dragon roared.This area is not take photographs.NIKKO-TOSHOGU was dedicated to memory of IEYASU TOKUGAWA faundation of an Edo（Tokyo）city.We observe the decencies here."
284,"Several shrines, crowded and expensive","The setting on the forested hillside imparts a sense of serenity. The gold and wood carvings are more intricate and opulent than at all other shrines. The Toshogu Shrine (Tokugawa Ieyasu's mausoleum)  was extremely crowded with school children and other Japanese and international visitors. It is still an awesome site not to be missed. For a quieter experience head further into the forest to Taiyuin, the third Shogun's mausoleum. It is smaller and just as beautiful with few visitors. Be aware that you need to go up and down at least a hundred steps. I did not count them."
285,Superb shrine - a pity to miss,"I will not duplicate what has been said many times before, and with more far more knowledge and eloquence. This World Heritage Site   should be on your tour list for Japan, and top of many tourist reasons to visit Nikko. It rained most of our time here. And it was crowded at times, with many happy school children, and lots of umbrellas, but that only added in some ways to the enjoyment. Must be spectacular in full autumn or with sunshine in quiet day.Many steps and long pathways, so be prepared for good walks around main compound and surrounding temples, shrines, sights, etc. Read up before you visit. Makes seeing things clearer."
286,Unexpectedly busy ,This is the shrine at which the 1st Tokugawa SHOGUN Ieyasu was buried in the mid of moutain 400 years ago.You can feel a kind of animism and the forest bathing as well.
287,Very nice shrine north of Tokyo,"We visited Tosho-gu during one of the coldest season.The coldness seemed to give even more power to the shrines.The shrine building has a lot of decoration featuring animals.  Not only the famous Three Monkeys and Sleeping Cat, but there are birds and other animals curved into the buildings.Worth visiting once in a lifetime."
288,Best Temple visit,"Nikko can be reached from Tokyo within about two hours (50 minutes to Utsunomiya by Shinkansen, 50 minutes by local JR line). The Tosho-gu is the resting place of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu whose soul was interred here in the sixteenth century. You walk up a slightly steep slope, pay your admission fee (1300 Yen/adult) and enter the shrine grounds. Here you find the original painting of the three apes (don't hear, don't speak, don't see). Pay close attention to the intricate timber work of the roofs - carpentry at its best. Different buildings show splendour and attention to detail. A good time to visit is late afternoon on a autumn day, when the foliage is particularly striking."
289,Wow- highlight of visiting Japan,"The shuttle goes to omotesando from tobu nikko station or shinkyo bus stop or nikko station. It is just amazing. At the entrance, you can see the famous monkeys, speaking no evil, seeing no  evil, hearing no evil. Actually I liked the mother and kid monkeys next to those 3 monkeys.  I also liked to hear the raring dragon's voice. Only thing that i was not quite pleased, they do not have any explanation in English. I could only catch some words, but still OK. At the major place, I could understand how to pray in Japanese way. He said, bow 2 times first, than 2 times claps, then one more bow. That was good to know, then I start to practice from next Buddha's temples. Pls enjoy its majestic temples!"
290,Amazing but still some parts were under repairment,"This is one of the most important cultural relic in japan as it starts the spread of buddhism in Japan, which is the blood of japanese culture giving rise to various japanese values centred around Zen, like wabi sabi, tea ceremony and flower ceremony.  The temple has very beautiful buddhist statues which although is originated from China, can no longer be found in China and therefore such Tang Dynasty buddhist temple architecture and statues can only be found in japan now.  The 3 monkeys tells of the excellent buddhist teaching of ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"".  Words to live by.There is a long hike up many stairs.  It supposedly teaches you of hardships of life that you need to go through before you reach enlightenment. Cant recommend enough.  If you havent went, you havent been to Nikko."
291,Fabulous,"Nikko Tosho-gu is a UNESCO world heritage site in Nikko.  It is one of the most crowded tourist spot there.  The impressive Shinto Temple together with other nice architectural sculptures and artworks are worth detailed viewing.  Although entrance fee is required for this temple, it is considered worthwhile.  Recommended.."
292,Big Shrine,We left Hamamatsuho bus station  exactly at 9:00 am and arrived at the temple around 11:30 am.   You need to have a map that the tour guide will give you as you can get lost easily.There is a parking space for the buses which is your starting point.  The ticket line can be quite long so be early.  Then you can go to1.  Stone Grill Gate2.  Five Story Pagoda3.  Entrance Gate (Imaginary Elephants)4.  The three story houses5.   Stable House (Three Monkeys)6.   Bronze Torii Gate7.    Yomeimon Gate8.    Chinese Style Gate9.    Front Shrine10.  Inner Shrine11.   Yakushido temple (crying dragon)12.   Sakashitamon Gate13.    Leyasus tombAccording to our guide fon’t miss out on numbers 9-10-11.There is a lady who sells moshi and soy drink.Its a must try.  Its located beside the entrance gate i think.
293,Extraordinary - and very impressive,"The purpose of this Shinto temple lies in his name. Tōshō-gū means ""Dedicated to Tokugawa."" Here is the tomb of the founder of the Tokugawa dynasty. The founder himself attached little importance to the construction of temples, and more to wars, food and women. The last two Hobbies undermined the health of the first shogun. The last will of Ieyasu was to bury him a year after his death on mount Nikko and build a small temple. The grandson was considered a small temple unbecoming the honor of a great grandfather and it was extended to its current limits. The temple combines the external simplicity in the aesthetic spirit of Wabi Sabi and the abundance of decorative carvings, the three monkeys are the most famous example. A long road and a five-storey pagoda give the temple additional solemnity."
294,Decorated shrine,"One of the most important temple in Japan, due to the fact that the one of the most important Shogun was buried here. The area is full of interesting temples and shrines.  Moreover this place is also famous for the 3 monkeys..."
295,World heritage Nikko Tosho shrine,"This temple was founded in the 17 century in honor of the founder of the shoguns dynasty in the name of Tokugawa Leyasu . He was the one that began the Edo era and moved the capital to Edo city , today, Tokyo .Many Chinese motives as the artists were sent to China to learn the wood craft ."
296,Beautifuk,"1. You can purchase tickets at Tobu-Nikko station through a vending machine. This will help you save time queuing for it at the shrine. The machine accepts credit cards.2. Alight at bus stop 7 (we took ""World Heritage Bus Loop"") and walk from Shinkyo bridge to the shrine. It's an easy 15 mins walk with some stairs along the way.3. Be prepared to be surrounded by huge hordes of tourists, this being one of the UNESCO sites and all. Audio guides are available inside shrine (after giving ticket at entrance) for additional cost.4. The architecture is beautiful and intricate. But other than that, it's noisy, crowded and underwhelming due to the crowds. Especially in hot summer months, this can get aggravating.Having said that, we still enjoyed parts of Nikko for our day trip that does not have as many crowds."
297,Don't miss,"Toshogu shrine is the final resting place if Tokugawa Ieyasu the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate that ruled Japan over 250 years. This shrine consists of more than a dozen buildings set in a beautiful forest. Toshogu shrine contains both Shinto and Buddhist elements. There are three of the Toshogu's famous carvings : cat, monkey and imagined elephant. In front of main enterance gate visitor can see a beautiful five story pagoda. This shrine is being renovated from 2007 until 2020s but the impact on a visit is relatively small and it remains worth a visit."
298,must see  but with criticism,"Nikkō Tōshō-gū is a Tōshō-gū Shinto shrine located in Nikkō, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. Together with Futarasan Shrine and Rinnō-ji, it forms the Shrines and Temples of Nikkō UNESCO World Heritage Site, with 42 structures of the shrine included in the nominatio! Wonderful and historic place!"
299,Wow.  Cultural gem.,"Es una visita imperdible! Para mi fueron los templos más lindos que vi en Japón! La implantación, Nikko es un lugar divino por su naturaleza. Ni te explico si vas en epoca de florecimiento de cerezos.Best temples in Japan! Because of the surroundings, the nature..amazing! Specially if you have the chance to see the Sakura. Nikko is a quiet place where you can rest. It´s a small and very attractive town."
