16,Sport Bar.,"Good concept. Their Activities will keep you busy throughout. All their activities are for adults mostly. Very few of them for kids under 18. Good place to test someone's physical endurance.Just felt terribly sad about an activity. In the Dog Walking activity, you get to walk with a dog. There they have husky and other breeds of dogs that survive only in snowy areas. They keep them in an air conditioned cold room to cope up with that thing. How irony is that since their volunteers write, ""We love animals"". Atleast they should keep only those dog breeds that can withstand lonavala temperature without the need of air conditioners and similar synthetic situations. Let the huskies and similar breeds be freed."

I met Mr kawsik bala and Mr TJ over there and they were awesome to help and guide us.
199,Amazing della,"This was my 5th visit to Della's. I am one of their customers who till date thought Della is good. I had the worst experience yesterday. I had booked 2 rooms one in camp Della and other in Della villas. I was staying in the room in Della villas which had a very poor quality of material and this huge glass in my bathroom broke while I was in the bathtub. It was a life threatening scenario and I'm still traumatized by it. I have uploaded the images of this in my review. The staff then shifted me to this one room which is on the ground floor with an open Jacuzzi, so I asked them is there full privacy? to which they said yes, and I later on found out that one can easily see you while you're bathing which exploited my privacy. I have also attached my Jacuzzi pics from top view. Then there was no internet at night, they gave me a modem which was so poor quality of internet it took hours for some websites to load and I couldn't even work from my room. I had planned a business visit to which my work went for a toss and I've never seen such 5 star property with so poor internet connection. That's basic these days I'm not sure Della is aware of it. Or maybe their definition of good is too bad. So to all this experience they offered me an apology. That's all that there was. They gave me a 20 percent discount of 400rs on my food bill. I am like seriously? All my dishes were way more expensive than that compensation and is that what my life is worth? After paying them 50k, I would not recommend you'll to visit Dellas for staying at least, and if you're staying make sure your rooms are in a good shape. lonavala has better properties I am sure."
200,Extraordinary experience,"Had visited della on 14th jan had an amazing experience everything was upto date and maintained well especially had a lot of fun flying in the rocket ejector in zone A and the marshal MR.
