0,A must see location when visiting Boston.,"Whether you are a Red Sox fan or not, Fenway Park has same the feeling of historical gravity that many monuments or battlefields convey.  This could be considered the heart of Boston, since it is the oldest continuously used gathering spot for Bostonians of all sorts for over 108 years. Though the park has been updated and renovated a few times since it first opened, one still gets a sense of how it looked on the first day.  the tour will take you to the most public places as well as the lesser known behind the scenes areas, and give you more information than you could imagine about all the personalities and  events to which this park has played host.  On Game Day, the neighborhood around the park is full of human drama and human interest as people pour into the stadium from all sides for pre-game meals and drinks and celebrations.  A must see location when visiting Boston. Go Red Sox!"
1,Must do!,I am not a big sports fan but this is one of the iconic stadiums - fun to take in a Red Sox game. easy access from train.
2,Tour and Shop,"Whether you like baseball or not, booking a tour of the Red Sox stadium is well worth it. You get an extremely informative guide for an hour, enjoying access to the changing rooms, press box etc."
3,One of the best places to go in Boston,Just one of those places you have to see as a sports fan. The history of the Red Sox and its players through our history is amazing.
4,Must See Tour.,"If you are in Boston and a baseball fan, this is a don't miss attraction.  The history of the park comes alive and a visitor gets to see the view from all angles.  I'm not a Red Sox fan but am a fan of the game and this park is full of history.  We had a fantastic guide and her enthusiasm was contagious. The one criticism I have is that the gates are lettered but aren't in alphabetical order.  It's long walk for senior citizens to find the gate where the tour starts.  Once the tour started, there were elevators available for those needing them."
5,Historic ballpark that's a well oiled machine,"Brimming with history, Fenway is a must see ballpark. We got to see the park from every angle including the green monster, press box, and even inside the locker room. Just seeing the classic framed photos along the walls was worth the visit. The tour group leader, a retired fellow from Boston was awesome and authentic as the ballpark itself. Great info and enthusiasm!"
6,"love the Sox or not, this is an iconic sport venue, with really interesting stories","In all honesty baseball in boston is awesome. Fenway is one of the oldest stadium's with so much history however they have some great modern upgrades and options. As a yankee fan its hard to admit but fenway is definitely one of my favorite spots to catch a game at!! Came here during marathon week and caught a sunday day game. We sat in the sam adams section and had a great time. Beers were cold, sun was out, and the food was hot. Catching a game at fenway or even just taking a tour is a must when visiting the Boston area!!"
7,Boston trip,"Nothing beats the sounds, smell and atmosphere of Fenway Park.  A classic park you have to visit.  Whether you live in Boston or are visiting you have to try to get to a game.  Standing room only seats are affordable and my favorite place to watch the game is standing in back behind home plate (even with seats I still like to stand here!) You get to take it all in and is a great view"
8,Beautiful stadium ,"I'm a Sox fan. White Sox fan, but loved the historic atmosphere at Fenway. Get there early to enjoy the festivities and party around the stadium because being a dated place, there's not a lot to do inside but watch the game, and the way Boston played this year it wasn't very exciting. Still great to visit and recommended as part of any trip to Boston."
9,When in Rome,"If you are a sports fan, even if you don't like the Red Sox, you will enjoy this tour. The guide was knowledgeable, you get to see a lot of areas and different views of the stadium and you can feel the history. My only criticism is that the box office told us the next tour was startig in a few minutes and we were just in time. That was not accurate. A man did show us the areas that we missed, however, we didn't get to do everything on the tour because it had already started. He showed up the areas and an abbreviated description, but we were disappointed to find that the ticket office lied."
10,The Cathedral of Boston!,"I am not a beisball fan, but visiting Fenway Park was astonishing.    It was like a trip to the 60s because of the structure of the park, the museum is also a highly experience to visit.   We really love it."
11,Historic!,An hour well spent.  This tour was great even if you are not a Red Sox fan.  It is more about the history of the park with a little Red Sox info mixed in.
12,Lot's of history here,"one of only 2 original major league venues still in use, Fenway really has a tonne of history, inside jokes (really) and knowledge wrapped up in it.    The tour is interesting and amusing, and doesn't drag.  and you get to see parts of the ground you would never otherwise get the chance to see.  Tours start from inside the huge Red Sox merch store, so easy to meet and no weather issue."
13,An awesome place to enjoy baseball ,Fenway Park is one of the oldest baseball parks in the USA. The green monster was fantastic. Being there in person really make you appreciate the size and hright of the wall.
14,Love this place,America's oldest ballpark. There's something special about stepping through the gates of Fenway. So much history and passion in that park. Definitely check it out for a game or a tour.
15,Walking to Fenway,"Fenway is not just a baseball park, the entire experience there is amazing. You don't even have to love baseball to enjoy your time there. So much history.People are friendly, they offer a variety of food and drinks, oh and there may be a Red Sox game going on. The concerts there are also great because they are used to big crowds so the usual mayhem is avoided."
16,wonderful tour full of information,"Coming from St. Louis we are baseball people, seeing the well preserved history of baseball’s oldest park was really awesome. I wasn’t expecting to get up on the green monster or to get a view from the press room but that was all part of the basic tour. Would love to come back for a game during the season."
17,Fantastic!,"If you are in Boston, love baseball and have never been to Fenway Park then this is a must to do on your list of events."
18,Fenway or Bust!,"What kind of baseball fan doesn't visit a shrine like this. I am not a Red Sox fan but I can appreciate a throwback park. The stadium is not like the new ones which are built today but who the heck wants new? I want history, charm and no better place to get this than visiting Fenway. My first visit but not my last. Our seats were by the Penske Pole so to catch the action our neck was turned for the whole time but who cares it was fun. The concession stands were average but what the heck you are at a ball park, eat ball park food.By the way, the fans in attendance were fun to engage with, it was fun to be able to check off another stadium from the bucket list of fan things to do and visit."
19,Focused on history but they need to dig deeper,"I'm not a baseball fan but you an come to Boston and not see Fenway Park, its kind of breathtaking, however the shop that sells all the memorabilia smells really bad. It smells really fusty and dirty which put me off buying any  clothing, but the park is awesome."
20,Beautiful stadium,"Growing up in New England, Fenway Park will always be close to my heart. This old park is full of history and nostalgia. Granted, the seating is old, the paint is chipping and seating is limited compared to big stadiums but honestly there is not a bad seat in the house and it is an experience well worth the price! Whenever I have friends visiting I always try to bring them to a game and share the experience. They also have opportunities for personal tours and to walk the field!"
21,America's favorite ballpark,"Fenway Park is to me the ultimate baseball experience. It is small and much of the retail and even food services are on Yawkey street outside the stadium but within the ticketed area. My seats were at ground level on the third base line. To get to them I had to go through what seemed an almost fantasy world, dark, steamy and redolent with the aromas of ballpark treats. As I stepped out onto the seating area and caught my first view I was overwhelmed. It was everything I had dreamed of. You could just feel the history. I recommend any fan of baseball take in a game there. It is bucket list worthy!"
22,Red Sox Game,"Biased opinion because I'm a huge Sox fan, but this place holds so much history from the city and the sport. It is 80% history, 20% Red Sox, so anyone can enjoy!"
23,Liverpool match,"What more can I say?  The venerable Boston Fenway Park.  Built 107 years ago. Home of Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and, of course, Big Papi.  Definitely a must see when in 'Beantown'"
24,Awesome experience!,"Not a Red Sox fan, but this tour of the ballpark is phenomenal. Such great history here. Good for any baseball fan of any age."
25,Love Fenway,"This is a must for anyone visiting Boston. Even if you're not a baseball fan, this is a fantastic tour of an iconic building. The tour is over an hour long and the excellent tour guides take you to various locations around the stadium. The guides are full of great information that delivered with knowledge, passion and humour. This was definitely a highlight on our visit to the great city of Boston."
26,Fenway Park - home of the Red Sox,I loved it. I'm not a Red Sox fan (go Cubs!) but wanted to see this glorious ball park. The tour guide was informative and interesting. A must see if you are in Boston!
27,Now Off My Bucket list,"A must if you are in the Boston room. No need to be a baseball fan, the stadium tour is very interesting. Beautiful stadium which has kept its vintage side."
28,Life on the Green Monster!,"A must do for any baseball fan, even if you are not a RedSox fan. Great history and information on the team and the ballpark.  Best valued tour I have ever taken in 40+ years of vacationing around the country."
29,Out of season tour of Fenway Park,"Fenway is a nice smaller professional ballpark. The ""Green Monster"" is a classic of the baseball world. We got there early and walked around the stadium to look around, it was a lot of fun.Nice park, regardless who wins, just go an enjoy!"
30,Go to a Red Sox Game do not Book a Tour.,All Yankee fans need to visit  Boston Red Sox Fenway Park to gain an even better idea of the reasons for the intense rivalry.
31,One Of The Last Original Ball Fields,One of America's best historic ballparks with tons of history and not a bad seat in the entire stadium
32,"The correct address is ""4 Jersey Street""","I'm a huge baseball fan and taking a tour of the oldest active MLB stadium in the league was a must for me. Went behind the scenes in the press box, in one of the locker rooms and went on top of the Green Monster! Very friendly tour guides too!"
33,Amazing,"We love going to Red Sox games, and where better place to go than iconic Fenway Park.  Its really easy to take the T in to see the game, plenty of food in and around the park, and its really a great way to see a game.  With multiple ways to enter, lots of things going on around the stadium, there is always room to move about without feeling too cramped, but its Fenway during Red Sox, so a lot of people is expected.  We enjoy it, the park is nice, the area has plenty to offer."
34,A must see in Boston,"You cannot beat Fenway Park. Sure it is old, its got character.Sure you have to sell a firstborn to afford seats..THAT IS THE SAD PART.  You cant afford to bring the next generation!  SAD. i would love to share Fenway Park with the kids...but, can't happen at the price of seats, food, parking, hotels...it costs a small fortune.  But.. GO SOX!!"
35,OMG Amazing!,"I am not a Red Sox fan. I am not particualry a baseball fan. But I enjoy iconic insitutions and historic places. So, this I just had to check out. My buddy (a die-hard Sox fan) said it was great, and he was correct. This tour was outstanding. The group was large and had to be split. The first guide was a little dry, so I jumped to the back of the line with tour guide, Andy. Wow! He could teach a course in Guiding. He was pleasant, patient, knowledgeable, and funny. The tour was filled with ample tidbits of information and context. I know some people were not happy that the field was under construction. No biggie for me. Its only grass. I was there to tour the facility. But, if seeing the field in pristine condition is a deal-breaker for you, then bare this in mind. You get to see the Green Monster, sit in the seats, press room, the locker room, and so much more. Absolutely outstanding tour!!"
36,Fun and Interesting Tour!,"Now the oldest major league ballpark still in use it is steeped in the history of the game. We went to couple of games in August and were thrilled to sit next to the Ted Williams red seat. If you can't get to a game then guided tour is a must for any baseball fan. Buying tickets is straight forward using the Ballpark app or book on line and the Red Sox will post your tickets. You can't print your tickets at home as you can with most other teams through Ticketmaster. If you're staying near Copley Square then Fenway is an easy walk. There are much better, more modern ballparks but none with Fenway's history."
37,Great tour of Fenway,Fenway Park is a great place to enjoy the tradition of baseball. It has an unique atmosphere and is rich of baseball memories.
38,Tour,There is no better place for a ball game then Fenway Park. All the changes they have made make it a more family oriented place with many selection of foods to get.
39,Tour,"Taking a tour of Fenway Park is a fabulous thing to do on a trip to Boston.  You definitely don’t need to be a baseball fan to appreciate this and have a good time! The guides are brilliant. Telling the story through the years as you go through the tour brings the place to life!  A great way to spend an hour. It’s very fast moving and no time to get bored! We walked there from Waterfront area (intercontinental hotel), was do-able but would recommend you call an Uber.  Taxi’s are not easy to find around the stadium, certainly in off season when we visited, so the Uber app is a must for a ride back into town. Tours are around $20 each and well worth it."
40,Fenway Park visit,This place is historic! Fenway with the green monster is one of the most famous buildings in the country! Enjoy a fenway frank! See the gorgeous field.  Have a sausage before you go in from the sausage guy! His are awesome. Go early and walk around the entire park inside and out to get the whole experience. Be ready people were smaller in 1911 so the seats are a bit crowded. But you can find many a place to stand and watch the game and drink a beverage! Go Sox!
41,Go Red Sox,As a sports fan this is a must. Red Socks NY Yankees Fantastic way to spend my Birthday Was like stepping back in time watching a sporting event in such an historic venue
42,Take the tour. Great fun! ,"I have been to 10 Major League Baseball parks.  Fenway is by far the coolest.  The park is still small enough that the game is a personal event.  You are close enough to actually feel like you are in the park with the players, and not just observing a tiny figurine on an over sized TV.It's hard to appreciate if you haven't been there, all I can say is that this feels more personal and relaxed, than a commercialized horde of crowds.If you can find the chance to go...GO!"
43,Ball Game,"Fenway is an institution in Boston, not only for its enthusiastic, packed stadium, its World champion team and its 7th inning Sweet Caroline but also for the number of blocks surrounding the stadium that are exclusively dedicated to it: sports bars and shops among many others that make up a sports carnival whenever the Red Sox are in town"
44,Fenway fabulous ,The Fenway Park tour was AMAZING!  The tour guides are humorous and you are never bored when they are with you!  I learned a ton of new information and really cool facts that a lot of people wouldn’t know about Fenway Park!  This was overall a very fun and interesting tour!
45,Personally I prefer non bleacher,"If you find yourself in Boston, and regardless of how much of a baseball fan you are, if you are looking to see and experience a great slice of americana history, then a tour, or a game at Fenway park is for you. Try to get on top of the green monster or get inside the wall during a tour."
46,Great tour for a baseball fan,Went to a game in august and it was great fun.  Fenway park still has its old charm and it is a bit like going back in time.  Everybody (age 9-43) had a great time.  The people obviously go there for the atmosphere as well as the game.  Great bonus that the Red Sox won since my son is a huge fan :)
47,The oldest american ball park,"Unless you hate baseball I can't imagine not enjoying seeing a game here - it's such a classic ballpark. As other users have noted, however, the seats are quite pricey compared to other parks but that's to be expected. I'd definitely recommend it for those who even remotely enjoy baseball."
48,Baseball fan ? Then this is a must !!!,Live long Pirates fan but couldn’t miss the opportunity to see the iconic Fenway Park while on our Boston trip. Was after the season and all the turf was ripped up but still 100% glad I took the tour and would highly recommend
49,Worthwhile tour,"Fenway is a great time when the Sox are playing but equally as fun to tour the park when they are not at home. The park along with  Chicago’s Wrigley are just special parts of baseball history with their old time architecture and unique blend of old and new. As a fan of Boston, it was great to step on the field , go inside the famed a Green Monster, and walk on the wall! The park is just a beautiful example of a historic cultural icon located in Boston’s beautiful Fenway area. Learning about the story of Fenway and where icons like Ted Williams, Jim Rice, and Future Hall of Famer Mookie Betts play was a great experience!"
50,Mr,"If you enjoy baseball and being close to the action, then this is the plac to be. If you are most interested in big comfy seats and over the top amenities, then you should go elsewhere, especially if you are taller than 5'7"". Just sayin'"
51,Great day at Fenway,"Even if aren't a die hard baseball fan, you'll find something to appreciate in this tour.  We were there on a day when they were in the process of installing the field, which was cool to watch. I honestly didn't expect the level of access we had, tow highlights being the tour of the visitor's clubhouse and the press box. And the view from the green monster, wow.  Tour guide was excellent, extremely knowledgable, fun to listen to and gave lots of time for questions."
52,Great place place to experience true American culture,"So my husband’s a baseball fan but not so much myself. That being said, I loved the Fenway park tour. The guide was so pleasant and answered questions but was a wealth of knowledge anyway. It was very cold and raining so we were outside some and in covered areas some but I still really enjoyed the tour. There is so much history at this park I think most people would fund it interesting."
53,Day at the park,"We're not even baseball fans but on our last day in Boston, we felt compelled to go by Fenway Park. We joined a tour and were thoroughly entertained. So much history and so much depth to the oldest ballpark in the country. How special it is that the owners continued on the tradition of keeping the stadium and bringing it up to date. I only wish the grass on the field was planted but they were updating a new watering system. Be sure to join a tour and take in the atmosphere and history."
54,Great place to see a game,Beautiful and historic - a must see for every visitor to Boston.  Best to go to see a game but entirely worth it just as a tour if you are traveling off-season
55,Fenway,"What can you say other than it's the finest major league ball park in America. Food options have improved significantly over the years, as had the cost of being there."
56,Great american ball park ,"We loved our tours of Wrigley Field and Busch Stadium, but the tour of Fenway was disappointing. Too many people. Our tour had nearly 100 attendees by my guess. We probably spent 1/2 of our hour waiting for the group. You can’t get more than 15 or 20 in the visitors clubhouse, or the press booth, etc. The guide was a knowledgeable Sox fan, but no special talent to reward this large group. No real opportunity to take good personal photos. The photos they took were overpriced at $40."
57,Nice tour at Fenway park,"Though I'm a DIE-HARD Yankees fan, I'm also a die hard baseball fan and visiting Fenway should be on every baseball fan's to do list.  Historic and classic.  I highly recommend it!"
58,Most iconic ball park there is left,"I always love going to Fenway Park to see the Red Sox play baseball.In addition to ballgames, I’ve enjoyed concerts at Fenway Park too. One year my daughters Girl Scout troop sold Dog Bones at Fenway Park. The Red Sox' 100 Acts of Kindness program Supported  the work of charitable organizations throughout New England during Fenway Park's 100th anniversary season. As part of this recognition, and with the generous support of Eukanuba Dog Foods, Girl Scouts of Eastern Massachusetts and Canine Companions for Independence sold 10,000 special edition packages of Eukanuba Healthy Extra Dog Treats, called Fenway Dog Treats."
59,Awesome experience!,Watched the Red Sox and Cubs play at Fenway about 3 years ago. Just wow! So much history. Seats were tight but manageable.  Did not know they had a tour so we will be back.
60,Best slice of americana in Boston,"Wonderful tour! Richard was our local guide. He is a true lifelong fan of the Red Sox. He loves his team& Boston.  His passion, enthusiasm& personal stories made it the best part of our visit to Boston. Richard was very welcoming& encouraged the group to ask any questions. Dont miss this tour! We would do it again. Tour leaves on time. Parking is a nightmare& expensive. We paid $35 for all day. So go extra early. Lots of bars& restaurants all around Fenway to enjoy ."
61,Tour ,Took my son and daughter to their first baseball game and what better place than at Fenway Park to watch the Red Sox vs White Sox game!
62,Amazing tour!,"We were so excited to be at Fenway Park!! The iconic home for baseball fans....photo opportunities abound!!! Life size statues of players, the sign, the whole experience was wonderful!"
63,"I mean, it's Fenway!",Anyone going to Boston must go to a game at Fenway Park. My daughter and I had a great time. Go to the restaurant there too the food is great. Fun time for all. I had a really good meal before the game!
64,America's greatest ballpark but bring your wallet,"I love the fact that Fenway is located in Downtown Boston - an easy walk from anywhere in the City. Fenway is more than a ballpark, it is a destination. With the opening of TimeOut in the neighborhood, you can now eat at a 5 Start restaurant before or after the game!"
65,This is a MUST visit,"I am a die hard Cubs fan, but had to take a tour of Fenway Park. We had a great tour guide. He was 70 years old and was born & raised in Boston. He had so much information about the ballpark, players, and history of Boston. It was a very enjoyable tour. I saw parts of Fenway that I wouldn't have seen if I only attended a game. A must do tour for any baseball fan."
66,Worth the visit if you are a Baseball Fan,Been here many times as a kid and young adult growing up. Fenway Park has seen more memories than you could possibly imagine. If you are a baseball fan and you havent been to Fenway than your not a true baseball fan plain and simple.
67,Great Adventure!,"Not a Red Sox fan, but a fan of the game. This tour was really put together well and provided access to many parts of the park. We saw visitors locker room, press box, top of the Green Monster and all levels of seating. Tour took about an hour."
68,World Champion Treatment,Visited today on a tour. We are not baseball fans we are in Boston for the Bruins and Celtics. This place is a must. Talk about history. Our guide Mario was funny and knowledgeable. So much information about the place and great stories. Sat in all parts of the ground and even in the Green Monster section. New stadiums are great but this place was beautiful in the sense that so much has remained the same. Visit it and enjoy even if you're not a baseball fan.
69,3rd Visit,A must when in Boston. You don’t need to love the game or teams... it’s the  experience being at this park. The history and old time park. Great food and a fun day!
70,Great tour,"Fun and interesting tour, full of history and interesting trivia.  You don't have to be a Red Sox fan or even much of a baseball fan to enjoy and find the tour interesting.  For instance, did you know they grow their own vegetables on a terrace of the stadium?"
71,well worth a visit,Good place to visit. I’m not a baseball fan but this place does have history.  I went for friends.  But came out being very knowledgeable about Fenway and all it represents.
72,A moment in time,"Well for someone who had no interest in baseball I’m now a fan, even here in the uk I will find a way of watching the red sox..... the tour guide was excellent and informative... he knew all the history of the place and could answer all the questions people were asking. Only issue... I’m terrified of heights and of course... we were on top of the green monster haha, but I still managed to have fun and take loads of pictures. Thanks guys it was amazing."
73,FenWay visit,Great tour of Fenway park!  Just make sure that you book directly or at the box office because other websites will charge you more!  The rate you should pay is $21 per person.
74,A very great experience and knowledge of Fenway park,A must stop! Our family isn’t even baseball fans but what a great piece of history and architecture! We stayed in the neighborhood during the off season of baseball and it was a great experience. Great restaurants and everything in walking distance.
75,Fenway ,"I have been a Red Sox fan since I played on the little league juniors team in the 1970s. I have been to Boston often for work but never saw a game at Fenway. I have ALS and one place that I really wanted to see wad a game at Fenway. I also wanted Karen to see the New England Fall colors. St least we got one. My best friend from high school and college is a Sox fan also. Her arranged a private tour and we were allowed on the field before all the fans for fan appreciation day. None of us thought we would get to wear a current World Series ring, but Billy and I did. The organization was great with tickets and the tour. We stayed at The Verb which is right next to Fenway. Nothing like eating baseball waffles under a light tower of the ballpark."
76,Tour ,"Good old fashioned fun at Fenway! An authentic old time ball field with food , fun and great baseball. Parking can be challenging."
77,Sports History ,"Even if you are not a baseball fan, it is well worth the trip.  The next time we are defiantly going to go to a game!"
78,Even New Yorkers Can Appreciate This Legendary Landmark,Employees are very informative and helpful.  Just a great day in Boston to include the storied Fenway park!
79,Great tour (&guide),"If you are not a baseball fan, this will mean nothing to you, but this is one of the few Original Ball Fields still in existence.The history of America's original sport is slowly being gentrified by corporate greed and the need to satisfy those who don't love the game, but love the idea of sitting in corporate ""Executive"" boxes. Fenway has held out because the Sox fans have held out. This, my friends, is what baseball is all about. You can feel the history here, and if you are sensitive to the history of Fenway, you can see the spirits of Boston Socks past roaming the park.The Green Wall is nothing more than a backdrop to everything that is great about baseball and Fenway. You have to be there to experience it. GO...."
80,A must see in Boston!,Attending a warmup and a game at Fenway is one of the best sports experiences to be had. Perfect for a family event especially in the spring or early part of the season.
81,"Full of history, delivered with fun!","Great tour, great history and great guide (TJ). You don’t see the dugout or the home dressing rooms. But everything else is cool. Sadly, the entire stadium needs a good tidy/clean with rubbish and junk everywhere. Toilets stank and needed a clean. That aside, its historical and very interesting and well worth $20 each."
82,Excellent,"FENWAY Park is a great place to visit for a day, take in a Red Sox game which is always fun in the summertime, nice warm weather, it’s the oldest ballgame in America! Take in a tour of the ballpark great way to learn some history of it. My friends and I have done both and highly recommend it, worth wild!"
83,Bucket List: ✔,This was a fantastic tour of one of the big names and famous stadiums in baseball.The tour guides are full of facts and figures andcreally nice.The stadium is superb steeped in history and also one of the old school stadiums the views and pictures you will get are unbelievable I recommend any sports fan do this.I am Scottish and don’t know much about baseball but even my wife like me thoroughly enjoyed it suprb👍🏻
84,Excellent visit to Baseball history,"A must see when visiting Boston even if not to see a game, go to the bleachers bar. The best burger in Boston. A great atmosphere."
85,So much history,Even though we are not baseball fans (and are unlikely to become so) we are glad we made the effort to go to a game at Fenway Park. Fascinating to see the history of the ground and how it's being preserved. Food wasn't wonderful but hey - that's not why you're there I guess.
86,Great tour ,"Whilst in Boston I took a tour of Fenway park and the green monster!A very detailed tour which gives you an insight into the club, the sport, it’s players and rivals Highlights are going into the press box, seeing the players plaques and of course strolling on the GMWould love to see a game at Fenway hopeful next time in Boston will get the chance But for a tour of the ground for $20 it was well worth it"
87,Interesting tour,"As a Red Sox fan, and the wife of one, I took my husband to this tour as a gift. It was a rainy day, but still did not disappoint. It was so much fun walking through the stadium  without the game day chaos. The tour Guide was knowledgeable and friendly. We really enjoyed being in the press box and getting a birds eye view of the field. I highly recommend it."
88,Tour of Fenway park ,"We attended a Red Sox game and it's very disappointing to watch a team in decline.Had we not bought our tickets on Goldstar Groupon, we would have given ONE star"
89,Fenway Yeah,"Great guides, great site and a lot of tradition and class. If you are a sports fan, can’t miss it! Definitely recommend it!"
90,GREAT Tour,"Growing up locally, I’ve always loved the Red Sox. This was an amazing tour being able to go behind the scenes. Sitting in the press box was the best part."
91,great day at the ballpark,First time seeing Fenway park and it was truly amazing to see. Say big thank you to John the tour guide he was very knowledgeable of his information about Fenway park and history that had happen there. I would definitely do it again
92,"Try it, you'll like it","Fantastic tour that blended the history of MLB, Boston and the Red Sox!  Our tour was at 1 pm on a Friday. It was quite crowded but the tour guides were informative and made sure everyone could experience everything the tour had to offer. The tours scheduled earlier in the day may have less attendance which may be a better choice."
93,A really cool little stadium!,I had the opportunity to visit Fenway Park to watch a soccer game during July 2019. It was the preseason game between Sevilla and Liverpool. It has an incredible feel to it and the tickets were moderately priced. There is a massive sports gift shop just outside the stadium that had a lot of merchandise.
94,Fenway Ball Park,"As Australians, we don't pretend to know a lot about American baseball but we thoroughly enjoyed this tour. Our guide, George, was fantastic - really knowledgeable, entertaining and full of great stories. Boston is very lucky to have this wonderfully nostalgic ball park still standing and in use. It certainly beats the soulless, giant stadiums you find elsewhere. Perhaps one day we'll be lucky enough to return to Boston to see the Sox in action."
95,Loved the tour!,"This tour of Fenway Park was a gift from my kids' grandparents and three generations of our family walked through the ballpark on a beautiful September morning. I did not know what to expect but left the tour with a new appreciation for the team I've rooted for my whole life. This tour was very well done! Our guide expertly navigated our large group around the park (he had a microphone system which was helpful), pointing out different things about the park, the City of Boston, and sharing stories of the team's history through the last 100+ years. Even the most seasoned fan will learn new things on this tour. I had no idea there was a fully-functioning garden on the roof of Fenway! The thousands of pounds of produce from the garden is incorporated into meals served at the park. The park really is spectacular and the tour emphasizes its historical significance.  You will visit the right field roof deck, the green monster seats, and many other places in the park. The tour was excellent and exceeded my expectations. Everyone in our group enjoyed being in the park and learned a lot. There were people in our group from all over the world.Lastly, I feel it's important to say something about the number of stairs. I don't know how much they tell you when booking as someone else made our reservations, but it should be noted that there are a LOT of stairs to navigate on this tour. It was not an issue for my group, but while we were climbing up and down and all around I was thinking it would be an issue for some. There are probably elevators to some of the areas but I am not positive, and it would likely take extra time. If someone in your group has mobility issues or trouble with stairs, you might want to look into this further before booking!"
96,Summer is not summer without a visit to Fenway,My husband (baseball nut) & I visited Fenway Park in Sept - thought guides taking us around Fenway were most knowledgeable & told extremely interesting stories regarding its history.  Would do this tour again!
97,Tour of park during renovation,"I have never done an official tour but love the history.  It is fun to be in the park for a game. I love the stories of The Lone Red Seat, The Green Monstah, the asymmetricality ( it is a word, no?) because it was built on a weird plot, Pesky's Pole and more are all worth a look…"
98,Birthday Celebration,"Although I have grown up seeing games I had never gotten a full tour of the stadium. Highly recommend it, you really get to not only be exposed to the history but you get to appreciate it more! The only thing I would warn against is the weather, even if its sunny out you have no idea how windy it will be. If you are a diehard baseball fan however, this is the tour for you!"
99,Great tour ,Excellent visit part of Boston history even if you no nothing about baseball give this place a visit.
100,Historic,"I love Fenway park! This was our 3rd visit. It’s always amazing to walk in and I think I get chills every time! The staff each time we have been there has been amazing! From the security guards to the people who help you find your seats, they have always gone above and beyond! They ask if we need someone to take pictures or if we need anything. One of my children was having a “moment” the last game we went to and the lady helping people find seats in our section asked if she could get him some ice cream because she knew he was upset. Then saw I have 2 children and asked if she could get us another! 3 years ago a security guard saw us after the game taking pictures and offered to take them for us and then took my son out on the field for a photo on the field!! I’m telling above and beyond!"
101,Fun experience,"My husband and 11 year old son loved the tour.  I'd highly recommend - even if your a Yankees fan!  The tour guide stated ""we have many rivals but no enemies"" which set a great tone for the tour."
102,A fantastic way to spend an hour in a Boston ,"What a great ballpark! The tour was worth every dollar! A very enjoyable and informative experience. Whether you are a Red Sox fan or not Fenway park is worth the experience.We were in the visitors locker room, sat in the press box and even sat at the top of the Green Monster.  Our tour guide was excellent!  Check it out!"
103,You will love the history told on this tour!,Legendary park.  We took the 1 hour tour. A friend who doesn’t know a thing about baseball went with me and she was a bit hesitant but loved it.  Tour guide was great giving us the history of the park and great stories.
104,Excellent,"Nothing live a live Red Sox Game, with the place filled and the players on the filed. While they do offer tours and you can do one in the off months the Best way to see the park is at a game. Even the cheap seats allow you to walk around the whole park.  See the Green Monster with players on the field."
105,Absolutely incredible ,"This was one of the highlights of our trip, and I'm not even a huge baseball fan. The tour guides could not have been any better. The history of the place is amazing. This is definite must see for those interested in history and baseball."
106,Bigger than I imagined ,This is part of Boston history. The tour us good but a bit tired. Nothing like Madrid or Barcelona. Old fashioned but sweet. Definitely worth a visit.
107,Tour of Fenway Park,"Fantastic informative tour of a wonderful stadium with a wealth of history behind it.  Our tour guide was a fervent informative and very knowledgeable fan.  We thotoughly enjoyed our visit, Thankyou."
108,It's a hit!,"Anytime at Fenway is always a good time. You can always get great excitement, good seats, and great hotdogs. And usually a good ballgame"
109,Oldest Ballpark in MLB,"My husband is a baseball nut and Fenway Park was on his bucket list - so we took the tour when we were in town for a cruise.  I was being a good wife by going, but let me tell you the tour was amazing!  A lot of history in that park.  And they have a vegetable garden for the food!  Don't miss the red seat dedicated for Ted Williams.  Actually don't miss this tour if you have time.  We went to the game that night and it was very cool, the acoustics in the stadium were a wonderful surprise."
110,Great History,We had a very chilly tour last Saturday morning.  Our guide was knowledgeable and the ball park is packed with nostalgia and history.  I love going to brand new shiny parks but Fenway and Wrigley are so iconic.  The green monster is really huge and high. You really feel the history of the place and the amazing things that have happened there.
111,Had to be done.,"Great tour, informative, many photo opportunities, great history! Worth doing whether a fan or not! Be Sure to check out the bar by the field and huge merch store."
112,Great tour even with no baseball knowledge ,It was nice to finally be inside Fenway. The feeling is different when you enter and see all the lights and good old American baseball game. What a thrill I had a great time with my sis with nice cup of hot cocoa.
113,Must do,"One of the best parks in the US. Must go to. Must get a beer. Must get a fenway frank! Yawkey way is so fun to explore beforehand. Once you get in fenway, take it all in! Walking out for the first time was an amazing feeling!"
114,Historic Fenway Park,"My son and I are baseball fans. My wife and daughter are not. But we all enjoyed our tour of Fenway Park. Our tour guide did a great job giving us the history of Fenway Park and the Red Sox. We learned why the Green Monster (or Green Monstah, as the natives may say it :) ) was built 37 feet high. We heard about the trade that sent Babe Ruth to the Yankees. We saw the visitor’s clubhouse, the press box, and the Fenway Park garden where 40% of the produce sold at the park is actually grown. Who knew that this baseball stadium even had a garden!! A worthwhile tour, indeed!"
115,Who Doesn’t Want To Visit This Baseball Shrine!!,"Great place to see a game, Price not too bad in the grandstand even with the pitcher's mound and a side benefit is if there happens to be a little rain, you are covered. What history has happened here? Read Dan Shaughnessy's Curse of the Bambino for a good understanding of some…"
116,Historic ballpark,"I've now been to three games in the last 18 months at Fenway.  I loved the atmosphere, the friendly people, and the games (they won 1 of 3 while I was there, against the Yankees!).   The historical ballpark is great, a true piece of America.  The signs inside were cool, showing the history of the team and the ball park.  Here to hoping 2020 is a great year like 2018 was! $bosox"
117,Must do tour,"Yankees won. Boston fans were very nice, my family and I had a great time.We will do it again next year."
118,THIS is Why Baseball Was America's Favorite Pastime,"I am not a rabid baseball fan, but if you like sports and history, you should most definitely take this tour! The regular public tour shows you the visitors locker room, the media booths, the original wooden seats sections as well as the top of the legendary Green Monster. Although the group was very large, we had 3 guides walking around with us and they were all available for questions. At some point I was a bit too far from the guide speaking when we stopped to listen about a specific subject and I asked another guide to briefly explain to my friend and I what they usually explain when at this stop. I feel like this allowed us to get a more ""private"" experience :)For 21$, I believe this is a bargain for the quality of the tour and access to a lot of ""behind the scenes"" sectors of the Fenway Park.Baseball fans will love the tour. Sports fan will love the tour. If you like history and know a little about Fenway Park, odds are you'll love the tour as well."
119,Great Experience,"This place reeks of history, amazing architecture and totally seeps with nostalgia. A true tribute to the city as well as baseball!!!"
120,A weekend with my bestie,Great tour of Fenway. The tour guides were excellent. So much history in that park. Can’t wait to go back in the summer for a game!
121,Great for baseballs fans and good for everyone else!,"First, a disclaimer - I am a true blue blood Yankee fan.  However, that being said I have always loved Fenway.This ballpark is iconic.There is really not a bad seat in the house.The Boston fans know, and appreciate their baseball and their beloved Red Sox.The place feels like family.Good plays by the opposing team are even acknowledged with cheers.And yes, Sweet Caroline does evoke warmth, smiles and chills all at once.Concessions are ample, and reasonable.The area immediately surrounding the park is full of life, fun, and provides some of the best food in all of MLB.If you get the chance to take in a game, do it.You will have a treasured memory forever."
122,While we're here,"This tour is fantastic! The tour guides were so knowledgeable and the stadium and history of the Red Socks is great. Just be aware the tour is both inside and outside so dress comfortably and wear trainers, One of the best sports tours I have ever been on.👍"
123,Great ballpark tour,"Being Aussies in Boston our dream was to see Fenway Pk. We organised a tour online (easy) and turned up early to visit the merchandise shop. What a wonderful experience the tour was. Being taken  on the tour by knowledgeable,passionate and enthusiastic guides and carefully having the history explained was a highlight of our holiday. Thank you!"
124,A living museum,"This was an absolutely wonderful tour!  I'm a long-time baseball fan while my wife is a bit more of a novice but we both enjoyed the tour.  There were so many highlights but the two that really ""stick out"" are standing on top of The Green Monster and walking on the field.  So much history and such a beautiful ball park!"
125,"Great historical tour, don't have to be a huge baseball fan to enjoy!","Our tour lasted around 70 mins and took us into the inner sanctum of the historic Fenway Park. Our wonderful host was full of trivia and insider information as we toured behind the scenes areas usually hosting players & media. We also visited the green monster, various seating areas and back of house. Extremely enjoyable visit"
126,Fenway Park Tour - Fantastic,"If you haven't been to a game at Fenway or are visiting during the off-season this tour is worth the time. Last about an hour, get to tour around the stadium, go into the visiting team clubhouse, learn all the early history of the stadium and go to the Green Monster seat section."
127,Beautiful Ballpark,"I don’t follow baseball but found the tour fascinating, especially because of the passion of our guide.  We arrived a little late and the staff were very accommodating."
128,GO SOX,"If you are going to spend time in Boston, then you must make sure to come tour Fenway. They are the oldest active MLB park in baseball. My wife and I are from out of state. You can say our MLB team is one of their rivals. I even made sure to wear my teams hat to see what kind of response I would get. They had nothing but kind words to say. ( As long as your not a ""Yanks"" fan).The tour is full of history and they go out of their way to talk about everything Fenway. You start across the street from Fenway at the team apparel store. A big thank you to Andres for an informative tour. I would like to actually come watch a game at Fenway one day."
129,Bargain at $21.,"Great experience. Seeing the green monster, seeing and hearing about all of the baseball greats.  Fantastic c! 👏😃"
130,Hello World,I've been to Fenway three times so far - for two games and a tour. The surrounding restaurants and bars are not my scene because they become so crowded and loud you can't hear anyone talk even when they scream. The stadium itself and facilities are clean enough. I'd recommend getting a sausage and beer.
131,Baseball History,"It was awesome to walk around such a historic ballpark.  I had been looking forward to this part of the trip and our guide was great.  He included humor and was very knowledgeable, I learned a thing or two!  The one big disappointment was that they were working on the field while we were there so any pictures including the field (which were several) included dirt instead of grass."
132,Amazing Tour!,This is a must if you are in Boston. The outside of the building is impressive but it is nothing compared to the interior
133,Fenway Tour ,We visited this stadium and we knew it has history like no other and had heard you are always guaranteed fun and action when you come to a ballgame at Fenway Park.  The food is quite tasty and available at each and every corner you make.  The prices are very reasonable but the thing that sticks out the most is the superior service from all the staff. Such a good team.  Excellent job to everyone and a special thanks to the management for running such a well oiled machine. Why can’t all stadiums be like this?
134,Tour of the oldest ballpark in the league,"We had a great tour of Fenway Park with our tour guide, John. He had been to over 400 games there as a lifelong resident of nearby Newton. So, not only did we get to see all around the building, but we learned stuff about the players, the history of the site, the history of baseball and the history of the Red Sox. We got to see the club house, the press box, the general seats, as well as up on the Green Monster! The tour took about 1.5 hours and it was very impressive. While we have been there to games in the past, we hadn't taken the tour. It was well worth the price!  It was March and so much work was being done to get the place in shape for the season to begin.  There sure is a lot that goes into each and every game but if you're a history/baseball fan, you will love all the displays that really give a ton of information!"
135,Fenway Park in completely new light!,"It was lots of fun to see so much of this historic ballpark. The tour guides were very friendly, informative, and even entertaining. It made us feel like we had visited a very special place."
136,Tour of Fenway Park,This was a great experience for everyone in our party.  Great history of the game and the field and the landmarks of the field.  I'm definitely applying for the job of changing the scoreboard.
137,Great!,This tour was so informational. Tour guide was a true Bostonian and obviously very proud of her ballpark!
138,Let’s play two ,"Mr. Bob was by far the best tour guide I have ever had in this iconic masterpiece.  Learned so much about my beloved fenway park.  Will be back to do again and again.  Boston icon is definitely worth the hour, I could have spent several just soaking in the history inside the park."
139,Beautiful town!,"I will recommend a tour here. I am not a baseball fan, but it was interessting to see the stadium and hear the story behind."
140,Historic Fenway,We enjoy baseball and have looked forward to seeing the stadium.  Dave and Rick were great tour guides and wonderful story tellers.  Learned a bunch about baseball and the history of the Red Sox!  I would highly highly recommend it!
141,Fantastic!,"My husband and I truly enjoyed this event. We were able to go into the press box, behind the green monster and walk they out the park. The tour guide was fun, knowledgeable and really seemed to like his job. It was a fun filled day."
142,Game day,My wife and I have visited baseball parks in the past but this one blew them away. The tour was so much fun and extremely informative. You can see the pride that these guys have in their history!
143,First Visit,Our guide was very knowledgeable with a good sense of humor.  A definite Red Sox fan that knew the history and shared it well.  Poked fun at some of the other fans and definitely explained the Yankee rivalry.I did not know about the red seat in right field which was interesting.  Touring the visitors clubhouse  was interesting and did not know that both teams shared the same clubhouse separated by only a curtain at one time.
144,heck the sox,"This is an absolute must for any person, sports fan of not. Take the extra hour out of your day  and do the tour. You can buy tickets there for the tour or online. Online purchase was very easy and just show ID at the ticket window for pick up. Lots of great history and a beautiful old park. MUST SEE"
145,Old but good,"This is a must-see in Boston.  So much significance to the area and such wonderful charm.  You will be taken back in time as soon as you step through the gates to the stadium.  Even the concession stand posters were a throw-back.  My only disappointment is that we were there too late in the season to attend a game.  Our tour guide was extremely knowledable.  The highlight, of course, was getting to sit on top of the Green Monster.  Highly recommend this tour!  Thank you!"
146,Pretty neat ,Really enjoyed hearing the history of Fenway and seeing it from behind the scenes. The Fenway Farm was such a neat addition to the stadium.
147,Not only baseball,"Very cool tour.  From the original front gates, to the old seats. The press box tour to sitting on the big green wall.  All the history, stories and the movies filmed there.  Great tour for anyone who loves baseball or the history of the game."
148,Fun tour Fenway Park,"We are not baseball fans, but this tour was very interesting and the guides are very professional. You get to see into the places where you can’t necessarily go when there is a game on. The press box, the changing rooms and the expensive seats."
149,All are welcome here,Went on a tour of Fenway Park and it was better than I thought it would be. Our tour guide was so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Fenway and this helps bring the tour alive.
150,Fenway Park Tour,"I’m giving my review a 4 rating because had we known the field was going to be under construction, we probably would have visited at a later date. Other than that the tour was fantastic. Great tour guide and overall good experience. Just ask before you go if anything is under construction and then decide if it’s worth it. I would like to visit again."
151,Unforgettable ,"This tour was suggested to me by a friend who knows I like baseball. So much history and such cool stories: the gentlemen leading the tours truly love the game and their Red Sox. The guys knew many stories about happenings during various games and about other events and concerts that have been at Fenway. The tour is a little over an hour, and takes you to the Green Monster, the press box among other parts of the stadium. There is a lot of walking up and down stairs and not something younger children may enjoy."
152,Fenway Park Tour,"Rain was forecasted all day so we went on a tour of Fenway.   My husband is a fan, I am not really but we both found it interesting and enjoyable.  The guide was so good - he had a real love for Fenway and had been a guide there as well as a fan and season ticket holder for many years.  There were lots of interesting facts, a  peak inside the announcer's boxes and press areas, a trip to the green monster and why it's there and what it used to be.  We also saw the guest locker rooms and most surprising to me was they had a rooftop garden that not only provides fresh ingredients for the food they have there (a baseball stadium with fresh salads? Wow!) but gives an abundance away to the food bank.  Such a clever use of space and way to give back to the community.  They take your picture - which you can buy, but they give you plenty of time to take your own pictures.  There is a Red Sox store across the street too.  This would be a really good activity for kids who like to play baseball as well as grown up kids who still love the game."
153,Great experience,"Always a great classic ball park. Classic food, bars around area are great. Boston night life and bars good as usual."
154,Fenway Park,"I've previously enjoyed watching a game at Fenway but this was something I've been looking forward to for some time now. The facility itself is so unique but it was the tour guide who brought the history alive and made it entertaining. The first tour time on a Sunday meant the tour was less full than normal. We weren't able to walk on the field or see the change rooms as a futures game was scheduled for later in the day and the players had already arrived. But the chance to sit in the Green Monster, the press box, and the original seats in left field was memorable. Little touches such as view the rooftop herb garden were appreciated."
155,Loved it.,Couple of friends and I make an annual fall sports trip and this year was Boston. We are not Red Sox fans but we had to at least go on a tour of historic Fenway Park.We were not disappointed. The tour guide was excellent giving us plenty of historical facts both educational and entertaining with that cool Boston accent. Highly recommend this tour for anyone.
156,Fenway Tour,Section 42 baby! Bleacher Creatures! love this part of Fenway for accessiblity to bar and washrooms!! Fun!
157,It doesn't get better than Fenway and the Red Sox,"The tour guides were fun, entertaining, informative and authentic to the park!You get to go sit in the press box and at the green monster.  Super fun seeing the park from so high in the press box."
158,Awesome!,"The stadium is old so keep that in mind, the size of seats is very very very tight. If your looking for comfort then go elsewhere, but if your looking for a true baseball game experience this is the place to be. I really enjoyed CF the best for seats."
159,A must see when in Boston,Our Fenway Park tour was one of the best things we did on our trip to Boston. The tour guides really know their stuff and you can tell that the Red Sox mean a lot to them which gives the tour that extra special touch. Would really advising visiting when in Boston!
160,"Yankees,Boston game.","It’s a great way to hear all about your favorite teams history and get an up close look at the field, dugout and behind the scenes while taking loads of pictures to share.A well spent day!"
161,Fab Fenway Park Tour,It was fantastic!  The tour guide was knowledgeable and very entertaining.  I do not follow baseball but I enjoyed it very much and would highly recommend this tour.
162,Bucket list,One of the oldest base ball staduim. Took a tour when visiting and I even watch a Dodgers vs red socks.
163,Red Sox Game at Fenway Park,"This was a great tour. I wish they would include women’s history in baseball on their tour since they are so into their history. I asked about whether the ballpark was used during the 40s when men’s baseball was shutdown because of the war, the tour guide only referenced the film a league of their own being filmed there. It’s 2020. And it’s women’s history month. Not a single photo up about that, or any information. For one of the oldest ballparks I was disappointed. Otherwise the tour was incredible."
164,Great insider tour of Fenway Park,I'm not even a baseball fan and am not sporty at all but really enjoyed our day there. My dad wanted to check it out so we went there. It's nice and we even got to see the Red Sox practicing before a game which made it very nice. Would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in Boston.
165,Great even if you're not a Red Sox fan!,"I wasn’t a Red Sox fan going in but quickly became one after learning the history better and seeing how invested the organization is in keeping that history by not changing to a “bigger and better” stadium. You get to see just about everything on this tour, the locker rooms, green monster seats, press room, etc. we were not able to go on the field due to maintenance but would have loved to have walked around there and in the dug outs. Great option on the Go Boston pass!"
166,Great Experience ,"One of the highlights of our trip to Boston was the tour of Fenway! The guides were awesome and had amazing history of the Red Sox and the stadium. Was amazing to walk around parts of a stadium you would never normally see such as the press box, sitting on the green monster as well as being in the locker room. This is a must do torr even if you are not a Red Sox fan. I'm a Dodger fan but thoroughly enjoyed this tour. Amazing history."
167,Take me out to the ball game...!!!,"I am not really into baseball, but this tour was recommended.  It was very worthwhile, very informative and entertaining!  Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and fun!  Recommend this tour!"
168,Well worth doing!,Steve the tour guide was awesome and very knowledgeable. Definately worth the money. Fenway has a TON of incredible history!
169,great tour guide,This park is incredible pay up for great seats and bring cash for the vendors who add so much to the experience heyyyyyyyyyyy ice cream! heyyyyyyyyyyyyyy hot dogs! Gotcher ice cold beeeeah heeeeahhhh!!!
170,Favorite Baseball Park!,The tour was educational and fun. Our guide was knowledgable and showed true appreciation for the park. I fully recommend it even if you are not such a baseball fan.
171,Fenway Park,This is a great trip.  Very entertaining and a lot of baseball history!  Barry our tour guide was very knowledgeable about the Red Sox as well as baseball history.  I would do it again.  Going to try and get to a game soon.
172,Nice surprise for a non-sports fan,"Normally, we avoid ""tours"" because we have little patience for tour guides that seem to love going on and on way past time to stop and move on. This tour was different and the guides were entertaining and moved us on through the tour without a lot of minutiae. The field was being replaced at the time we toured, but we were more interested in the stadium itself more than the grass and dirt. We really want to return during the season and try to sit in the Green Monster seats in left field. The tour takes an hour and is not very expensive - so GO, see the oldest Major League baseball park and learn a bit about legends and the place they practiced their craft."
173,Baseball History,We got to see the last game of the season.  The stadium was full of excited fans even though their team (Red Sox) weren't going to the World Series.  They won this game though.  It was just great being there.
174,Red sox,"Friday night Baseball game at Fenway park. We were treated very well by the staff on duty, moving my friend and I to better seats because of my friends bad legs. Good and drink similar to outside the stadium. Only down side, parking costs and numb bum from hard seats but overall 5*."
175,Fun,Beautiful stadium with lots of history!  We did the tour of the stadium. The tour guide was very knowledgeable.  It's a must do.  We loved it!
176,Green Monstah and Buckets of History,"Lots of great factoids on this.  Highlights were the Visitor’s locker room, press box and of course the Green Monster.  Around sundown is a good time to go.  Highly recommended, especially with out of town visitors."
177,Fenway - uniquely historic Red Sox home park,"This tour is well done covering almost every level of the ball park,The guide was knowledgeable and the pace was excellent"
178,The Experience of the Lifetime,Went to Fenway park with a tour group.  Nothing was disclosed that park was being worked on.  Construction was being fine everywhere.  The tour guide rushed the whole group through and was not very friendly or informative.  I was told I should just be happy I was seeing the park.  Our tour cost 90 a person.  It was horrible. Petco park in San Diego was amazing but this not worth your time or money.
179,Baseball at it’s best,"I really enjoyed my Fenway Park tour!!  Lots of history and our guide, Andy, did a great job giving us all kinds of details on the park of old and new.  The only thing that would have made it perfect was if there had been a game.  Maybe next time.  I would highly recommend this tour."
180,Very cool and informative ,Even though it was off season the tour guides give a really up close and personal feel of all the history of the oldest ball park in existence.
181,Baseball,"I went for The Who concert. The view was great, the sound was fantastic!! Easy to get in and out of the traffic. Loved it."
182,Red Sox vs NY Yankees,"Neither myself or my husband know much about Baseball, however we both left this tour wanting to go to a game (perhaps on our next trip?). The tour was fun and informative, though we did end up in an extremely large group so it took a while to get everyone around. Great way to spend a few hours, and we would both highly recommend this tour."
183,Great tour,ALWAYS a good time at Fenway Park.  This tour is great. Very imformative.  Can't remember our tour guide's name but he was fun.  Must see when in Boston.
184,Breathtaking tour,"What a brilliant tour, the guide knew everything and was really passionate about the Red Sox which was great, enjoyed every minute of it. 100% do this tour if you are in Boston!"
185,Tour of Fenway park ,"Really interesting tour. I knew absolutely nothing about baseball being from England, and it was a great introduction! Really interesting stories and facts about baseball and it’s history!"
186,A Must when in Boston. ,"I’ve been enjoying baseball for a long time and have often thought of visiting ball parks as part of our vacation plans, but it just hasn’t worked out.  I didn’t even know there were such things as ball park tours until I saw it on Trip Advisor.  I really enjoyed our visit to the ball park, on a beautiful day, with my wife and son while visiting Boston for the first time.  Our guide was enthusiastic and knowledgeable of Red Sox history which added to the experience.  We were all glad we went and now will have a better “feel” for games played at Fenway."
187,"If you love the game, you gotta go","Fun facts. Not too long. Not too short. A must do tour when visiting Boston. One little problem - we walked all around the park trying to find Gate D to get our tickets only to realize that it was down to the right, not the left."
188,A highlight of our visit to Boston,Well worth the price of the ticket for this historic land mark. Booked on line and collected my ticket from gate D. Tour was split in to a more manageable size and so everyone gets the chance for pictures or questions. You get to see behind the scenes from the away teams changing rooms to the press box. You also get to sit in the oldest seats and then on to the most expensive above the green Minster.The tour guides are very knowledgeable and use a microphone with portable speaker.
189,Awesome!,"We visited with our kids.  A great place to see the history and see the ""Green Monster"" up close!  I am not a big baseball person and it was still really interesting.  Our guides were very knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor."
190,History,"An excellent tour of this historic ballpark with a very knowledgeable guide. We were taken through the park including several vantage points, the green monster, press area, and guest locker room which had several things displayed. Well worth a visit when in Boston."
191,Amazing history behind the park,Took this as part of the GoBoston places. Hubby is a baseball fan so he did get more out of it. However the guide included details of the times and people which made it interesting for me and my 19 year old daughter.
192,Great tour,"There's nothing like guzzling a watered down soda while wiping excess mustard off your Red Sox tee shirt.  The excitement is so profuse, you don't even notice the accidental spill of beer from an over zealous fan behind you.  Make sure you are wearing a Boston Red Sox cap."
193,Simply the best!,"Really enjoyed, the guy who done the tour was very knowledgeable and a dedicated fan. Interesting and wld recommend it.  10min walk from Sheraton Boston hotel, and a stop in the Cheeky Monkey pub opposite it is worth a visit for some beer tasting or just a drink."
194,Red Sox Stadium Tour,Awesome baseball history lesson on red Sox’s    Guide and tour were excellent and were so knowledgeable
195,Fenway Park,"I know right now it is empty, but it is usually packed with people and you can't beat a game of ball at fenway park when the Boston Red Sox are playing."
196,Everything you ever wanted to know about,"The Park tour was well worth it. We toured through the entire stadium, to every section where a little bit of its history was given. We sat in the section where the original seats are still being used, up to the section over the huge green monster (green wall in left field), went up to the press box and got a birds eye view of the field! I was impressed by their own Fenway fresh produce farm on the rooftop."
197,Fun anytime ,"If you visit Fenway and are disappointed at any level for any reason whatsoever then you obviously need to go back to New York immediately. BTW + FYI: ""Jersey"" is the next-to-last of the eleven Back Bay ""alphabet"" streets: Arlington, Berkeley, Clarendon, Dartmouth, Exeter, Fairfield, Gloucester, Hereford, Ipswich, Jersey and Kilmarnock."
198,Super behind-the-scene tour of Fenway,"Tip: Go to the last game of the year. They let all of the fans run the bases, and they give a way tons of free stuff that they can't use anymore."
199,Family ,"We didn't have time to go to the game between the Braves and Red Sox, but we just wanted to walk around Fenway and take in this magnificent structure from the outside. We ended up in a bar thats actually behind the fence in the outfield and was able to see onto the field during game time. I'll never forget it."
200,Fenway Tour,Visited from the UK and know next to nothing about baseball. However I’m really glad we did the tour. Our tour guide was a true Red Sox fan and very knowledgeable about the history of the stadium. I really like how they’ve tried to preserve so much of the original building. Worth seeing!
201,Fantastic history lesson,"I went to Fenway twice, totally love the experience and really no bad seat in the house - just the seats are close together making for a tight fit!"
202,Awesome experience,Great tour around Boston streets! Best and easiest way to tour! Our driver was exceptional with town information and good eating places. Leave your car parked and enjoy the ride!!
203,Wow!!!,"Our tour guide Brady was full of energy, knowledge and passion for the BoSocks!! An off season tour that made the history of this iconic ballpark come alive. Great behind the scenes look with plenty of great stories and anecdotes that made us smile!!"
204,First time at a Baseball game!,"Visited as two Brits who knew very little about baseball! Very informative tour by David who was extremely knowledgeable about the Red Sox and, in fact, baseball history in general. Only downside was that due to the size of the group, we were split into two mini groups, meaning our tour felt a little rushed so as not to be caught up by the other group. Perhaps if allowing a large number of people on a tour, the start time could be staggered as so the first group do not feel rushed?Overall great tour though and would definitely recommend for anyone visiting Boston!Thank you."
205,Inexpensive and intriguing ,This was an amazing tour simply because of the tour guide that was so excited about showing the group the park. He was so informative and answered all the questions without missing a beat!  It was fabulous!  I highly recommend this tour!!!
206,Great Tour,"Spent 5 days in Boston, took this trip for my birthday, 1st time at Fenway. Took the tour and stayed for a game, it was against the Mariners and was Mothers Day.  Had an amazing time, Boston won and I am a Fan! Visited other places in Boston and took the train all over Boston. Want to go back soon!"
207,Nothing like Fenway Park,Went with my 6 and 11 year ahead old and my 53 year native Bostonian. We all loved the tour. It was raining and everything was pretty much inside except the Green Monster. Kids loved the press box and locker room.  Steve was our tour guide and was great! I’m a picky tour guide reviewer and really thought they did a great job.
208,Fun Fenway Park tour,this is a one hour tour that explains the history of the oldest baseball club and guide is very informative and entertaining
209,Exceeded expectations ,My partner and I took the tour of Fenway park a couple of days back. I highly recommend the tour and Josh was a great guide with plenty of knowledge.
210,Sox Fan,"We were lucky enough to attend a game during our 1 night stay in Boston. It was an unexplainable feeling to be standing inside the “green monstah”. The crowds were fantastic! Loved the energy! We will never forget this experience!We are lucky to have them for spring training in our backyard, but nothing compares to the real deal!GO SOX!!!"
211,Fenway Park,"The tour was excellent. The tour includes entry into the visiting club house, the press box, various seating locations and ends with the seats on the Green Monster. Unfortunately the field was being torn up while we were there which made for some less than ideal photo backdrops."
212,A bit of a nostalgia,Highly recommend this fun tour . The guides are friendly & knowledgeable. Great way to see the old ball park .
213,Fenway tour,"This was a great tour, a close look at historic Fenway Park including a look at the visitor's locker room, seats in the Green Monster and so much more. Be prepared to walk though, limited access to elevators."
214,A baseball fan's dream,Must see while in Boston. We did a tour which was so informative and so fun to see the park. Amazing tour guide.
215,Fenway Park walking tour,"My husband and I recently made our first trip to Boston and had the wonderful pleasure of attending a Red Sox vs. Yankees game at Fenway Park. While my husband is a big baseball fan, I on the other hand enjoy America's favorite pastime casually. With that said, our visit to Fenway Park was amazing and I am SO glad we were able to attend a game. We also purchased a pre-game tour (through Viator) that allowed us on the field while the players warmed up. Like I said, it was an all around FANTASTIC experience even for someone who ""kind of"" likes baseball, needless to say my husband was thrilled! Definitely recommend a visit to America's oldest MLB field."
216,Great tour even in the rain!,I love the Pavilion. Having someone bring your Beer and snacks is wonderful. Great view. Also attached to a restaurant you can eat dinner in and chill out before the heat of the game
217,"Good tour for baseball fans and non-fans, alike",My daughter and I went to Fenway Park last night.  We enjoyed the tour.  It was cold but the history and guide were informative and interesting.  Learned a bunch about the park.  You really do walk back in time.  To think of all those players who have played at Fenway through the years.
218,Great tour,Not being baseball fans we were sceptical about the tour. However we were pleasantly surprised and both really enjoyed the tour. Staff take an official photo but very expensive at $31
219,I have wanted to be here for 70 years!,"Sorry to say this but I didn't love Fenway.  No, I am not being a hater.  I just didn't like it.  I am a baseball fan so I was excited to knock Fenway Park off of my list of stadiums.  The history is great so I am still happy that I was able to experience it.  The whole area outside surrounding the stadium is great and I did like being around true fans.  I think I am spoiled with my local team having a nice brand new stadium because I couldn't help but compare.  Fenway was just too small and had too many line for everything.  Vendors were slow, many things were sold out or unavailable.  Employees weren't super friendly.  The seats were outdated and the entertainment and lack of jumbo-trons were a bummer.  I am happy to have been to a game here but probably wouldn't go to another one."
220,Great,"Just before we flew to Boston, I booked a morning tour of Fenway for my wife and I. Neither one of us our very big baseball fans, but we still really enjoyed the tour. You fee like your are standing on “holy” ground. The city is very proud of Fenway, as they should be! Learning about the history of the park was awesome and getting to see the locker room, press box, and the green monsta wall was very cool."
221,Nice way to spend a few hours ,"Our adventure started with Uber ride ($11.94) from Doubletree downtown to redsox tour ticket office on Jersey st. across from (The Team Store) My son reserved tickets ($21.00) per adult for the 12pm tour, the earlier tours had sold out, it was after all a Saturday tour. We had the opportunity to browes around the store which by the way has just about everything from A to Z for you redsox fans. Our guides gathered us all up and split us into two groups because of the number of fans there were. PS make sure you get an actual ticket, even if you have it on your phone you need to go to ticket booth for ticket...also you will be going through a metal detector entering the park. Our guide was very knowledgeable about all aspectes of the park and its history. I'm sure their trained for that but his presetation was enthusiastic and genuine. He asked us and answered questions we had. We started out at the visiting team locker room and ended at the Greem Monster seats. One of the things I would have liked to see is behind the scoreboard...we did not go there. At the begining of the tour they take your picture and you can if you want buy a copy ($40) at the end of the tour. It came in booklet form with two 6x8 and four 3x4 pictures and one magnetic picture fram. I purchased mine, once in a lifetime opportunity. Even for Yankee fans, which there were a few on our tour I would say for all fans of baseball when your in town do the tour...Try it you'll like it. PS since this is off season the playing field is under constrution..."
222,Fenway Tour,Did the tour of the park (oldest one in the system).  Lots of history etc.   The price is somewhat high for it but I have no regrets after finishing the tour.  They make a lot of $$ from these tours.   You’ve got to walk around outside behind as well for the statues of prominent players etc.  A must see overall.
223,GREAT TOUR.....,Wow what a great place to see a baseball game especially in the afternoon on a weekday. Wish there was more weekday afternoon games like the old days night games just not as enjoyable. Fenway park is the best place to ever see a baseball game. If you can go there go there if not there’s always TV.
224,Must do if visiting Boston,When we eventually found the right gate to meet the tour we got started on a tour that was interesting and fun. Had a really good look around this historic stadium with plenty of time for pictures and general looking around. Really good guide too
225,Like a Walk through MLB History - It was a Hit!,"Every year I buy tickets for my brothers, nephews, my son and grandson. 13 of us go to the park to see a game. The Park is fantastic. I've been going since I was a kid with my father and, even though the park has been updated, it still is historic and hasn't lost any charm. The Green Monster Seats looks like they've always been there and they probably should have been. The crowds are great, the Sox are terrific and Red Sox management deserves a big shout out for keeping Fenway an historic gem. When others (like ""evil empire Yankees"") rip down their historic stadium, the Red Sox know that history and tradition matter. Just one more reason to love the Sox (and hate the Yankees!). Whether you're a fan or not, you should go to this historic gem and see a game."
226,Cubs Fan In Fenway,"instead of doing the usual stuff at the park and paying for visiting the same, I recommend going to the cafe that is inside the park and sitting on one of the tables that are right next to the shutter - which is on the ground level as the park grass. The views from here are phenomenal and even on regular days, you can enjoy a beer overlooking the grandeur of the park!"
227,Great level of insight offered to baseball fams,I would love to say so much positive stuff about this place.  I think it has everything that you need to do to keep yourself busy
228,Yankee fan  invasion of Fenway,"We booked this before we went out to Boston. The tour is educational, historical and a genuine great time. Our guide who's name I forgot. Was the 10am tour 11/27, was amazing. He answered all question with professionalism and his knowledge was second to none. Overall a great experience worth every cent"
229,Interesting tour for all ages,Great time! My family and I went for the family event and loved it.  A little bit pricey but a great experience none the less.
230,Must-Do!,"I took a tour of Fenway Park while in Boston.  The tour was really enjoyable, we had a great tour guide which the classic Boston accent.  We were a small group and were able to go throughout the Park.  The tour guide was very knowledgeable and an obvious super fan of the team.  We got to sit where the press sits, see the crappy locker room for the visiting team (LOL), go to the green monster wall, sit in the oldest seats in the MLB and see lots of memorabilia.  I had a great time and would recommend it even if you are not a huge baseball fan, the history alone is worth the tour."
231,Great tour,"This was an amazing tour. The guide was so informative about the history of the park and the club, famous Red Sox players, the design of the field. Tour included locker rooms, press box, green monster seating. Fabulous tour!"
232,Pure Awesomeness,We took the tour on Sunday morning. We got to see the public parts of the stadium as well as some of the spaces that aren't open to visitors just there for a game. The guide was so full of history and knowledge. His passion for baseball and the stadium made the tour super enjoyable!
233,Great tour!,"We have a son in a wheelchair and were not sure how easy it would be to get around in the stadium. The guide was a fill in for someone else and not used to giving the tour so we got a little turned around a few times but overall it was great! Getting to go up to the Green Monster was a bucket list item for our son, and he was able to mark that off of his list."
234,US Road Trip,"This was the first tour we did after arriving into Boston. It had good reviews and family members before us said it was worth it. We got to the meeting point which was in the team store. When the tour started there was roughly 100 people. I and others, who I heard, thought this was absurd. Everything took a long time, getting everyone through security, corralling everyone through small areas like cattle, getting to talking points, and waiting for the long lines of people behind us to catch up. Just overall a bad experience.On top of the huge crowd, the 1 tour guide for the 100 people seemed very unenthusiastic (honestly I would be too if I had to tour around 100 people in crappy weather) and his body language definitely seemed like this was the last thing he wanted to do.The tour itself was very basic. Light history, not really any behind the scenes besides visitor locker room, media boxes, green monster.This is a big skip for me if you have limited time in the city. Plenty of other things to do. If you love baseball and baseball history maybe worth a try and hope you get a better tour group."
235,Baseball heaven,"3 times I’ve done the tour, gets better every time. Lots of fun facts and stories shared. Great to see such an iconic sporting venue in all its glory. Need to open up locker rooms though. A must see whilst in Boston even if your not a baseball fan."
236,Not what was advertised.,Well worth a visit. The hour is a bit of a whirlwins as you are guided around the stadium through some of the back areas and out onto the seated areas. Plenty of little bits of history pointed out throughout.
237,Fenway,We arrived as recommended half an hour before the 10am start time of our tour and showed our Boston Go Pass to get our entry tickets. We then went across the road to the team store to do some shopping and await the start of the tour which departs from the there. We were lucky to be in a small group to go around so could hear and see all that was pointed out to us. Our guide had great enthusiasm for the history of the stadium and gave ample opportunities for questions. Some of the highlights are to go up to the seats of the Green Monster and entrance into the Press Box. There are plenty of photo opportunities. A great tour leaves you wishing a revisit to see a game.
238,On a tour stop,"Small cozy get righ in there with your fellow fans.  The view are amazing. Only down fall is price of food/drinks adds up quick especially if you bring the kids,"
239,Fenway Park,It was great being able to see the park & our tour guide was very knowledgeable but there wasn't sufficient time to look at all the pictures & memorabilia along the concourse
240,Nice Park even for a Nationals Fan!,Took ether tour with friends for my husbands 40th birthday and we all had a blast! Very educational and our tour guide was funny! I am not a sports person but I really enjoyed this tour and learned some neat things! Would definitely recommend!
241,First time to a ball game.,"This tour is great! Our guide who was a retired schoolteacher (I didn't get her name) was full of information, fun facts and obviously a Red Sox fan. You get a thorough tour, seeing many spots that you would never get to otherwise."
242,Great Tour,My husband was so pleased that we had a tour of this park - he was very excited to see it for himself. He wanted to visit each of the big ball parks - so this one is now part of our memories!
243,VERY EXCITING,"Husband is the baseball nut, me & the kids (teenagers) were along for the ride, but we needed up all enjoying it so much! The tour guide was knowledgeable and charismatic & gave us a ton of history of the park. Highly recommend!"
244,Non-Game day Tour of Fenway,"We were starting our two week tour of New England from Boston to see the Fall. We bought tickets for the Boston Red Sox - v- New Orleans Orioles on the second day. Being from the UK we didn't really know what was going on but the tickets were cheap and the atmosphere was great and ""when in Rome"" so we went. apparently it was the last game of the season and on the last ball of the last innings on a tied game the last Red Sox player hit a home run to win! Pandemonium! Celebrations and jubilations. Just great!"
245,Loved it. Great for baseball fans of all ages and levels of fandom,"Took a tour of the park that was excellent. Had an excellent tour guide and got to see pretty much most of the stadium besides the dugouts, the home team clubhouse, and we didn’t get to go into the actual field. They handed out free bobble heads at the end, to conclude a great visit."
246,Take the Tour!,Our Association held a reception in the State Street Pavilion.  The service and atmosphere were excellent.  They provided members of their banquet team around the venue to make sure you knew the history of the Boston Red Sox.  The food was very good and they set it up in buffet line style.   Really enjoyed the monogrammed plates.
247,Super Great Tour!,"My family was very excited about this tour after reading reviews. However, we had a different experience than most reviewers. Our group size was so large. I overheard the tour guide make a comment about how there were definitely more than 42 people in our group. I tried to count and stopped at 60...I’m guessing we had 80 plus. It took us a long time to get from location to location on the tour because there were so many of us. There were times we couldn’t hear what the guide was saying because we hadn’t made it close enough to him before he started talking. There was also disagreement between 2 of the tour guides on how to do certain aspects of the tour. It seemed odd because you would think the tour would be laid out an exact way. Our tour guide wasn’t the best either. He was hard to understand sometimes and seemed like maybe he was new?? I hate to sound so negative, but we were just really disappointed. We have taken several tours while in Boston and none of the group sizes were even half what this one was. We just felt like part of a large crowd instead of a more personal tour."
248,Fantastic!,We visited today 147th feb 2020 and what worthwhile your it was. We loved every minute of it and enjoyed the humour and fun from our tour guides. Definitely worthwhile.
249,Always a great stop. Get a tour.,"Great location, right downtown.  Easy to get to.  However, carefully check your view, some are simply too far away and even the large screen is cut off.  If you simply like the atmosphere of being at a game live, anything will do.  If you want to good seats, check carefully, it is worth it!"
250,Good tour guide but..,"When I started to read, the Portland Oregonian sports section had Oregonians in the majors. There were three of them and two played for Boston. Both   Johnny Pesky and Bobby Doerr have had their number retired.We had views from the press box and the Green Monster.The guide was knowledgeable and informative."
251,Fun to see up close!,"I'm not too sure about Baseball, being from N.Ireland but can't beat a trip to Fenway, who doesn't know who the Red Sox are! This was a really good tour, the guys taking it were really friendly and took pics for us and all for $21..!"
252,You don’t have to be a sports fan!,Thr our guide was very informative and made it enjoyable in the rain. Got behind the scenes views that mist can only imagine. Highly recommend!
253,It's Fenway Park,"We visited the outside only a trolley stop tour. It was okay with a few good photo ops, but you should probably get the inside one hour tour if you're really into baseball."
254,Tour ,Enjoyed the tour of the park before the game and also enjoyed the game.  Tour was very interesting and a must see if you are a baseball fan.
255,Great tour! ,"Had to visit. Outside of season, but was able to glance within and get the feel. What a landmark...so cool..."
256,Great Tour Experience!,Went here a few weeks ago on a tour… The people were very knowledgeable the tour was amazing highly recommend it if you ever go to Boston
257,An Interesting View of a Baseball Mecca,Would highly recommend. The tour took about an hour. A lot of fun facts. If only the field wasn’t under construction.
258,Fenway Park Tour,Had a fun night at the baseball in October. The game was fairly average but the all round entertainment value great. Fenway had a really good atmosphere. Customer service excellent as we had trouble with the mlb app on the phone and the fan support were great in solving the problem. Recommend to any sports fans visiting Boston
259,"Too many people, guide seemed dis-interested",Recently visited during our trip to Boston. Our tour guide Richard was really fun and chatty. We were lucky that our tour was small so got to ask lots of questions. Thank you to Richard for making our trip to Fenway so enjoyable. It was a highlight of our trip to Boston. Loved Fenway Farm too!!Thanks Again!
260,So much history and great views,"Had a nice tour and learned some history about this beautiful   park.  Guide was friendly and informative. Our tour group was packed so even on a weekday, get their a little early. I was able to just but tickets at the gate  for the next tour."
261,Nostalgic Fenway Park,"I have been here quite a few times. Always a great time. Sometimes you will get unruly neighbors sitting next to you, but people are usually receptive if you have kids around and you're looking for them not to be vulgar or obscene.  Beers are expensive.  Food is also expensive but is typically really good."
262,A baseball Icon,Very informative tour. Very impressed with the tour guide and his skills in relating past events to the group. Tour takes you into the bowls of the stadium including the visitors locker room. You also get to sit on the green monster and learn about the lone red seat in right field.
263,Entire family enjoyed it very much!!,"Really good tour, saw all the major parts of the stadium. Our guide gave loads of information and was really friendly. Was interesting to hear the history behind the park. Was worth doing and would recommend."
264,Fantastic experience!,"As a boy I spent many excited days there watching Ted whack em over the Green Monster.  Our visit brought back those memories.  Not the classiest park these days, but still a REAL ball park"
265,Really neat ballpark!,"really enjoyed our tour here, very knowledgeable guide with lots of facts to tell, but made it fun rather than just reeling facts off at us"
266,Historical ballpark ,"Our tour was in the offseason and the field was under renovation, but that didn't dampen the tour one bit!The cost of the tour was $21 and it lasted just about 1.5 hours. During the tour, you get to roam the back halls of the stadium, see the visiting teams' locker room, sit in the historic wooden seats, sit in the press box, and sit in the seats on the green monster. The tour is narrated by a passionate tour guide who carries a microphone and speaker in an attempt to ensure that the entire tour group can hear him (this doesn't always work in a large crowd).A highly recommended tour of the oldest pro ball stadium in the USA!"
267,"If You Love Sports, You'll Love This",Awesome tour.... very informative ...great guide..highly recommend to all who are visiting Boston.  Our entire group loved it!!
268,Great piece of Boston history,"I did the tour with my son and found it very interesting and well worth while. Unfortunately the park was getting drainage put in so did see the bases etc, but otherwise great tour if in Boston"
269,Fenway!!,"We loved every bit of it.  Guide was very personable and knowledgeable.  We got there an hour before the time we had purchased tickets for.  They let us exchange and get in the earlier tour.  Even if you're not a Red Sox fan it's a great tour!  Went to Cask n' Flagon after for lunch, mainly for a much needed bathroom stop.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Great lunch and service."
270,Not just for baseball fans,"I didn't think I would find this tour interesting. I went for my boyfriend. A few minutes into the tour I was fascinated, entertained, and thoroughly glad I had booked the tour. I've seen a game here before - but the Fenway tour is not something to be missed."
271,FENWAY PARK VISIT,"The tour was an hour and totally worth it, learned so much about the park and got to see a lot of cool things!!"
272,A great Piece of History,"We did the guided tour which costs $21 for each adult and it was very enjoyable. The guide was very entertaining and the stories of the oldest ballpark in the US were very interesting. There is a funny story at every turn and great history associated with this park even if you are not a big fan of baseball (you’ve seen the movies ‘Ted’ and ‘Moneyball’ with Brad Pitt so you’ve seen some of the Park already!)You are brought for a photo opportunity which you can purchase after the tour and then to the different levels of the park, up to the best view in the park - namely the press box and then over to the Green Monster a must see location if you are watching a game as you might actually get a ball in the head if you sit there. You will even get to see their organic garden where they grow plenty of the healthy food you buy on a game day which is unusual in any US attraction but they need something to make the burgers look healthy!!It is a unique park which is smaller than most but with the history here you should just go along for the entertainment value"
273,So much fun!,We took a tour at 11 am.  The tour guide was funny.  They let us see all kinds of behind the scenes stuff.  Sitting in chairs on the monster was the highlight.
274,expensive and overrated,"The tour guide was fantastic and informative with a great sense of humour. Overall we enjoyed the tour, however we felt slightly cheated as thery were installing a new drainage system when we went, which meant the pitch was being dug up - a building site is not what you expect to see when visiting the stadium for the first time. So overall tour was good, but we felt that they should have said that the pitch was being dug up as we would not have visited when we did."
275,Best ballpark there is,This tour was great and well worth the money! Our tour guide Will was so enthusiastic and knowledgeable and he made the tour that much more enjoyable. Definitely recommend!
276,Great day the park,"It was absolutely incredible. I had the most fun I've had in a long time. The stadium looks so much smaller on tv. If you go to Fenway, try to enter the field from behind home plate. It's awe-inspiring."
277,Great! But pricey,We were able to visit when no games were going on. Will be fun to watch games on TV now that we've been there. There is apparently a Boston sports museum nearby but we missed it.
278,It's Fenway !!,"When i went to the park, I was expectin a good pie, just like the one i get by yankee, but this was not the case.  I guess this was too much for simple minded red sox fans.  THAT WASNT EVEN MY BIGGEST PROBLEM!  The place was filled with SOX fans.  I cant even be in the same room with them, how is a simple guido such as myself supposed to be in a stadium filled with those paesanos.  I mean Madonna Mia!!!  I mean the agita it made me feel,  oh madonna. I was walking through the corwded hallways and nobody even listend to me saying Hey Im Walkin ERE.  Salud to all the people who ever have the displeasure of going thereFenway sucks, the socks suck, capeesh?  GO YANKS!!!-from a proud italian New Yorker."
279,Fantastic,"It's so expensive for a family to attend. I have a family of 4 and the cost of tickets, food, drink etc. Not going back"
280,Saw one of my first ever baseball games.,"This was the first tour we took after arriving in Boston and we were not disappointed with our decision to do this at the beginning of our 5 night stay. TJ was a great tour guide; he was easy to hear, and took time to answer all of our questions in a friendly manner while giving us interesting information. Even though the field was dug up for the installation of a new irrigation system and the rain was continuous, it was one of our favorite tours while we were visiting."
281,America's Most Beloved Ballpark,"Best tour I’ve been on and there has been a few. It was freezing cold but the guide ensured we stayed inside as much as we could or just out of the wind. It was fab to learn about the history of the place and be so close to the Green Monster. If you’ve got time then definitely go, so worth it."
282,Baseball fan,"Went on tour with Go Boston Card. Was a little difficult getting ticket initially, as the first Ticketer I spoke to said that I’d have to wait extra hour and to come back in an hour. Second attendant let my get ticket for immediate tour. Excellent for baseball fans, as get insight into features of the park and get to see from different levels (commentators box, ground level, above manual scoreboard)."
283,Red Sox game,Went to Fenway on a school trip from Australia and it was one of the best places on the trip. The history behind the place is unbelievable and it connects with you even if you are not a baseball fan.
284,Been several times- if you don’t have good seats don’t go ,I’d been on this tour years ago but took my partner for the first time. Lots of history and made entertaining and informative for all whether Red Sox fans or not. Left with a smile and a bunch of new historical facts
285,Awesome Tour for Any Age!,The last time we were here we sat behind home plate.  This time we were at an event and the seats were way out.   Terrible.  Didn’t even feel like you were at a baseball game.  I know it’s a tradition but come on Boston time for a new stadium and I like old things.
286,Would’ve been better but group size was too large!,My boyfriend took me to the park to celebrate my birthday. We had special seats under cover and servers to bring us food and drink. My BF hit a home run by posting a beautiful announcement for me during the seventh inning stretch. I was always someone who could take it or leave it when it came to baseball. However that day and since Fenway was an experience I won’t forget.
287,A Day at the Old Ball Park,We have taken this tour twice one on our own and one with friends. Both times were different and very interesting. Definately a must see for any baseball fan. Great for families with kids especially teens.
288,Grand Old Ballpark,We always get a tour and they are always a bit different. This time we got to go into the visiting locker room but not the museum by Sam's Bar.
289,Could Have Been So Much Better,"When we went to Boston each of us in our group of 4 choice something to do.  Although I'm not a big baseball fan, I really enjoyed the tour and found it unique and informative.  You just don't see stadiums like that, and now I would like to go there to actually see a game!"
290,Not worth the money.,"My wife and I were on a cruise from NYC to Quebec and Boston was one of the stops.  We have been to Boston on several occasions and we wanted to do something a bit different.Since the Red Sox were out of town we went on the Fenway Park Tour.  I had seen games there as a kid so this was like going back in time.The tour is fantastic, they take you all over the park, from the entrance, to the Green Monster, to the press box and everything in between.The guide had lots of fun and interesting trivia and history. We got some great shots, got to sit on the Green Monster and just had a fantastic time."
291,Fenway Park Tour,Unfortunately our visit was outside the baseball season so we couldn’t do a game but we did the next best thing in a tour of Fenway Park. A fun way to take in all the history of the ball park and see everything that gives this ballpark its character. The guide was excellent and sitting in the Green Monster was a great way to finish the tour. Highly recommended.
292,Baseball Mecca,We had an excellent time touring Fenway.  We had a group of about 20 people and lasted about an hour.
293,Very interesting,Very informative tour with a very knowledgeable guide. She catered for everybodys' needs regarding the stairs and ensures everyone could hear her and see. It was very enjoyable to hear about the history of the park.
294,Worth Every Second,Unfortunately due to our schedule we were only able to do an early morning outside photo walk so we never got into the stadium to feel the atmosphere.We took some out side photos and you can see from the pennants flying out front how successful Boston have been.Sorry this is about all i can review on due to time.
295,"It is a great piece of original baseball history, still going.","Food: 3/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Decor & Style: 5/5This Park is classic. This park is a basically a huge party for 37,000+ people! I had lots of fun here and as long as you're rooting for the Red Sox, then you have 37,000 friends to party with. Very exciting and fun, highly upbeat environment compared to other baseball stadiums.Food was not bad nor good here."
296,Fenway pahk,"Booked this tour for a quick last minute trip to Boston. Thought it might be small due to off season & cold weather but it was a pretty big group. I’ve also toured Wrigley but during the season and on game day. The Wrigley tour seemed to give us more except for the clubhouse, including bringing us down on the field & up & right next to the manual scoreboard.  The Fenway tour was nice, we saw the Series trophy & a few exhibits in the visitor clubhouse. We didn’t get on the field. Not even close to it. Not near the manual scoreboard either. They did bring us up to the press box which was nice. I also noticed that there didn’t seem to be a bad spot to watch a game either. The finale of the tour was the seats on the green monster, but that too was limited. I give it 4 because it’s such a cool old place full of history. If we had gotten either the field, Sox clubhouse or the manual scoreboard I’d have given 5."
297,A Great Experience,"Fun, interesting and enjoyable.  It was a very hot day and they did their best to keep us comfortable.  We got to see so many things.  The press box was great."
298,Awesome as always,"My wife and I signed up for the tour a month in advance because we weren’t sure if the tour would be full. Based on the tour, it appears that there is no limit to the number of people that can join the tour.The woman leading the tour is a lifelong fan of the team. You could tell that she had a passion for the team.The tour included: visiting team’s locker room, press box, sitting in the stands for a history lesson and sitting at the top of the Green Monster.It was a nice tour. At times it felt a little rushed. We enjoyed the experience."
299,Fenway Is Baseball History!,"Brought my family of four here (12 year old boy, 6 year old boy, and two adults) last Thursday, Oct 3rd during our trip to Boston. I'm not a big baseball fan or Red Sox fan for that matter, but I thoroughly enjoyed this tour. Our tour guide was very informative and took us through the stadium to experience the old original parts and then through the newer additions. He kept things interesting with his various stories about the park and it's past owners. My kids had a great time and  my husband and I loved it. We even got to check out the press box and see views of the field from almost every possible seating area."
