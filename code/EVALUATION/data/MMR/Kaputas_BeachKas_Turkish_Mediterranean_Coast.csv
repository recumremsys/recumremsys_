0,Beautiful beach stretch but very crowded,"Theres no question Kaputas makes for a beautiful beach spot. We ended up leaving soon due to how crowded the place was. But regardless of whether you end up staying or not, this makes for a great photo stop in the Turquoise riviera."
1,Beautiful beach,"It's was one of the best beaches we have been to during our trip, it's a sandy beach with a lot of waves. (so kids might not like swimming there)"
2,Overrated and overcrowded ,"Kaputas Beach used to be beautiful, quiet and a great place to stop at.  Unfortunately, it has been ruined by a cafe, sunbed hire and lavatory facilities, etc.  There is no real parking so, the road gets blocked and is dangerous."
3,Superb Beach,"We were staying in Kalkan and decided to drive up to Kaputas beach one day for a change of scene. We had hired a car and it was about 10-15 minutes' drive from our hotel, along the main coastal road. There are plenty of parking spaces if you drive there, but it could also be reached by dolmus or cheap taxi. The road is high up, and the beach itself is accessed via a lot of steep steps, so it wouldn't be suitable for people with small children or mobility issues - although there are boat trips that will stop at this beach for an hour or so.Although Turkey is a Muslim country, the local people are very relaxed about tourists wanting to strip off (just no topless bathing) and the only ""dress code"" I would recommend for this beach is a good pair of aqua shoes - because the beach itself is lots of little pebbles and it can be quite painful hobbling to and from the sea barefoot!You have to pay to use sun loungers and parasols but they charge a lot less than the rest of Europe (I would say about a fiver, compared with about 15 euros in Spain!) and there are plenty of them. DO come prepared with a high-factor sun lotion, even if there is cloud cover or sea breeze you still risk sunburn. If the sea is calm it is lovely to take a dip, but be mindful of the current and don't swim too far out. There were lifeguards in attendance on the day we visited, but the red flag went up when the water got a bit choppy.You are fine to turn up with a picnic/drinks but there is also a lovely big Taverna offering simple meals and snacks as well as hot and cold drinks (including beers) and we tried some lovely ""pancakes"" which were freshly prepared by local woman who sat together and rolled out the dough, filled with fresh spinach, herbs and crumbly cheese, and washed down with a glass or two of apple tea.. mmm mmmm! Beside the Taverna are decent toilet and shower facilities.Whenever I visit any beach, anywhere in the world, I make a point of properly disposing of all my litter AND I will pick up two pieces of plastic left behind by less considerate people. This is a very clean public beach and the locals are rightly proud of it. So let's all do our bit to keep it nice for future visitors and sea creatures. XX"
4,Busy but great fun,"Kaputas beach is very close to Kalkan where we stayed for our holiday. We went there by taxi which was 50 TL from Kalkan or around 6 euros, although there is a bus every half an hour or so and a ride is 5 TL per person. The beach is awesome, very picturesque and well organized, pebble and partly sand, however it can be overcrowded since tourists from all neighboring resorts come to see it. If you wish to find a sun-bed you have to be there earlier in the morning. We were there around 11 o'clock and got only an umbrella for 10 TL. The sunbed also cost 10 TL which is very cheap comparing to prices in Greece, for instance, not to mention Italy or France. There is a cafe-bar at the beach where you can buy snacks, drinks, sandwiches, pancakes... Prices are very affordable. Since there was a great heat during our visit and the beach is more open to the sea, tourists stay mostly couple of hours, take photos and leave. We did not book a taxi for our return, so we had to wait for a bus, which is punctual, but in the afternoon hours from 1 pm to 3 pm or so it runs every hour. Due to coronavirus there were safety measures to enter the beach - obligatory masks... The beach is worth seeing, however it is not for everyday use."
5,During covid 19 stay away,"This beach is the most famous in the area and is definitely worth visiting! However, it's always busy and there are waves and the water is deep as soon as you step in it. There are minivans going there from the center of Ka»ô every 30 mins."
6,Breathtaking Beauty,"We heard contradicting comments about this beach, but we really enjoyed it. It has very great view and the sea is also very nice. But you have to be there early in order to find a free sun bed and an umbrella, because it gets very crowded during the day (entrance is free but you have to pay 10 lira for one sun bed and 10 tl for the umbrella). There is also a cafe, changing rooms and shower. You can easily get there by minibuses from the bus station (otogar) in Kas. They go every 30 minutes to Kaputas and back and they are quite empty so you can find a seat."
7,Beach worth seeing but,We stopped by kaputas beach during our road trip from kas to olideniz.  Such a beautiful isolated beach
8,Must be seen,"Kaputa≈ü beach is a very beautiful place and worth the visit, but only if you get there very early in the morning before the boats trips and tourist buses arrive.   That way you can enjoy the splendid view without the huge crowds."
9,So beautiful since 1994,the beach was down a lot of steps and would not be suitable for anyone with mobility issues.The beach was beautiful but by lunchtime it was far to crowded to make the experience enjoyable
10,Big waves and cold water in hot summer,This beach is heaven! I highly recommend it but arrived early as it get busy during the day! I will definitely come back next year!
11,Always packed,The place is too much crowded. Since it is free to swim there are too many people trying to go there. Too many cars people and etc. The sea is blue as you can imagine and great but i dont think i will visit there again.
12,The most beautiful in Antalya,"If you are not into pebbles and you want a nice sandy beach in Kas then Kaputas is the best. It is a very nice sandy beach, just grab your towel and tanning oil üòâ Its very nice to be surrounded by the mountains, the sea and islands. And its free üòç"
13,Nice place to chill,"The best beach in area. Highly recommend! The cafe run by municipality which is why it was inexpensive for that beauty. You can take shower, there are change rooms."
14,Most Famous Beach,"We have been traveling around area abd we decided to have stop on this beach and it has been told to be amazing and it was that. We arrived around nokn so there waa lots of people already. We needed to wait for sunbeds about 10min but theb we got 3 next to each other with umbrella. Serive worked well. Beach was nice and clean. Same for water. It was so nice to lay in sunbeds next to hot sand and then cool down in fresh clear water.We also tried restaurant and it was pretty good and fast. We sit on table waiter came to take order. Also check came correctly and dast when ww asked.There is change rooms and shower but toilets was not most clean. But for that ammount guest, it's understandable.If you are on area, dont skip even parking might be hard, you would miss a lot."
15,LOVE IT‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,"This is a very special place, we visit every time we go to Kalkan, This year it was very busy thats the reason for 4 not 5. It can be very rough but the water is so clear. You must visit just get there early and try missing weekend days."
16,"Lovely sand beach in Kas, Antalya","This is a great beach, lovely sand and crashing waves. It does get very busy so try any get there before 11am. Also has a beach cafe with sandwiches and drinks menu. Must visit if local to Kalkan or Kas"
17,A must visit ,One of the fantastic views around ka≈ü. Kaputa≈ü beach is perfect for swimming. 100+ stairs worth climbing to experience this unique beauty
18,The most beautiful beach on the South West coast of Turkey,Great spot to hang out and tan and swim. Compare to most beaches this one is sandy one! It‚Äôs just 20-25 Mins away from Kas with car. It‚Äôs one of hidden gems in Kas
19,Kaputa≈ü Beach,We arrive from Kas by minibus around 20 minutes. Kaputas beach is very good place and have a blue flag. There is a beach company at coast.
20,Stunning beach!,"This is really a wonderful beach, with white sand and turquoise water, but there are two challenges in order to access this lovely beach, finding a parking place and almost 200 steps to go down to the beach... (it is really a challange to climb back after you've spent some nice hours at the beach). But it really worths."
21,Swim in morning,"Except stairs there is no reason that not to visit the Kaputa≈ü beach for swimming. The water is brilliant, sand is so soft to get a sunbath with just your towel. Also must be a sea cave close the beach but i never been there but you can"
22,Beautiful views; slightly busy ,"Breathtaking views and refreshing turquoise waters, but a little too busy as it is a tourist attraction in the area. You need to climb many stairs to reach the beach, keep this in mind regarding your physical capacity. I would recommend a visit rather in the late afternoon, when it is not as busy. Definitely worth a visit to see the views, but there are better beaches around Ka≈ü for swimming. Here you can not go deep into the sea, maybe 10m - although the beach is quite wide; lending for space."
23,Great beach,"ƒ∞t is an amazing beach everyone should visit on their kas trip. Municipality os running the place and they are doing a very good job. Prices are fair, food is good. The nature of this small bay is unquestionably mesmerizing with beautiful shades of blue and mountains looking over the sea. One thing that is not nice is people chilling at the beach toss their finished cigarettes on the sand. You can see lots of cigarettes on the beautiful white sand. The employees are keep cleaning the place but they cant keep up with that much garbage. ƒ∞t would be so nice if we could‚Äôve respect the nature more."
24,Overshared beauty,"When I went the beach wasn't at all crowded. It is one of the most beautiful beaches I've been to. The beach is all small pebbles so you need sandles. The stairs aren't that much of a trouble as people make them sound. When you see the view and the water you'd be going to, trust me you'll forget about the stairs."
25,Small and beautiful beach ,"Kaputas Beach - in my opinion, one of the most beautiful in the world, the sea is incredibly beautiful color!"
26,HEAVEN!! ,"Kaputas beach is a special experience for swimmers. Water is gorgeously blue and clean. No doubt it will be crowded in high season and especially on the weekend so the trick is to go early on a weekday. Restaurant/cafe offers food and drinks and sun lounges and umbrella's available at a price. Tricky part is transport if you don't have a car. You can get a taxi there, but will find it difficult finding one once returning since the beach is situated on an express way. Worth arranging for a taxi pick up. Been there twice and would love to go again. Makes for a special half day at the beach."
27,Little heaven,"The beach is a bit far from downtown. You should go in the morning otherwise you could not find empty seabeds and/or an umbrella.After 11 am, it was so crowded and turned a torture. A lot of family came with huge amount of children. It was very noise. There is a one Caff√® with is operated by municipality but it was extremely expensive."
28,Too crowded yet beautiful,"We loved this little beach, we found a little spot, set-up tent and and made sure to have snacks/foods for the day. There is a cafe at the top of the beach, but they are only serving water/tea/soda, hamburgers and ice cream basically. Make sure to pack extra sunscreen in your bag."
29,Transparent water,"Amazingly beautiful beach in spring. It's very easy to get there, so it must be crowded in summer, also the beach is not so big"
30,Picturesque beach,Kas is a place we discovered by mistake while doing a road trip and for me its the one of the nicest areas in turkey
31,Beautiful Beach,Coming from Australia sandy beaches are hard to come buy travelling around This was a nice beach we didnt see any turtles but we also didn't go looking for them either
32,Amazing beach,You will see similar places with less crowds. This beach is gorgeous and the aquamarine color is amazing.
33, A public coast that nowhere else can match,HelloThis is one of the best beach I visited so far. It was like a throw back to my honeymoon in Indonesia. The sea was beautiful. One inconvenient: big waves Be carefully and enjoy the Mediterranean Carribean Sea
34, Very nice,"One of the most picturesque views from the highway.  We stopped here on the way from Dalaman airport to Kas for some photos.  Absolutely beautiful views, well worth the time and effort to come for a visit."
35,Small beach and very crowd,"Even though its is one of my favourite places in Kas, I did search for alternative this year. The social distance is in centimetres rather than meters both on sand and in water."
36,Beautiful beach but lots of cigarretes on the sand,"Visited Kaputas beach during low season, we had the entire beach to ourselves.The coastal road leading to Kaputas is scenic, the roads are well maintained."
37,Kaputas Beach,"located 20 minutes from the centre of Kas by taxi , this beach is one of the most beautiful beach i have seen."
38,"Very, very pretty....","ƒ∞t is a small but beautiful and special beach with amazingly soft and clean sand.You can get there by taxi or public minibus from Central Ka≈ü or Kalkan. Parking place for cars is very limited so if you are coming with a rented car and intend to stay long in the high season, perfer early morning hours so that you can find a parking spot. There is a  steep stairway from the main road to the beach which can be a problem for old or disabled. Once you are the enjoy the lovely clear and pure turqoise waters and beautiful sand. Entrance is free. There is a cafe for snacks and drink.Even the view from above the beach is worth to stop there and take pictures.Seen lots of beaches  around the world. I can say this one is in top 10."
39,Beautiful but crazy crowded,"One of the few sandy beaches on this strip of coastline, we found it quite crowded and not anything special. We didn‚Äôt use the cafe so can‚Äôt comment on that. Sunbed and umbrella hire was reasonable and the Dolmus from Kas took us there directly."
40,Ruined,A must when you visit the region. Unfortunately it was such a windy day and we were quite sort of time to go for another day.
41, Beautiful beach ,"The sunbeds and umbrellas are free of charge unlike most of the beaches in Kas as this place is owned and operated by the municipality. The beach can be accessed by ‚ÄúDolmus‚Äù transportation departing from Kas center. Water is excellent, probably one of the best bays in Kas. There are showers, restrooms and changing rooms available. There is also a cafe."
42,Overrated crowded beach,A lovely beach in a beautiful spot but be prepared for the fact that it is very busy. Cars line the road where the steps down to it are and the parking can be chaotic on busy days.
43,Worth seeing (at 6am!),"One of the longest sand beaches in Antalya. A blue flagged beach. Beautiful drive up to the place. Highly recommended if you want a relaxing day with your family at the beach. The cafe next to it serves drinks and fast food. Just to note, there are 150 steps leading down to the place which you also have to climb up."
44,Was Excellent,This place have the perfect view but not  the best place for swimming in the Ka≈ü. It is worth visiting though.
45,Landmark beach certainly lived up to its reputation.,"The beach looks nice from atop. Good for pictures! However it is rather narrow and touristy. Almost no visitors at 7 a.m., but the sun shows up only at 8:30 (mid-September) and this is when the crowds and ships fill in the space."
46,Great ,The colour of the water is just amazing !!! Worth of a visit although on the peak is way too crowded
47,Stunningly Beautiful Beach !! UNCOMFORTABLY BUSY !!,"It‚Äôs a great place to spend an afternoon here if you are in Kas, it‚Äôs easy to get here if you rent a scooter!"
48,"Beautiful beach, but get there very very early before the crowds descend.  ","Clearly November isn‚Äôt a great time to be at a beach since it can get cold! However it was a nice place to sit and chill and listen to the waves. The cafe there had very limited food available at this time of the year but decent , albeit expensive, sandwiches and burgers."
49,Beautiful!!! Worth drive ,"i went Kaputas Beach with my family and friends we went there at 1pm , all sun beds was taken , we stayed at cafe , everything was good but be there before 1 pm ."
50,More than beach,"I don't rate this beach at all, very crowded, uncomfortable sun beds and a steep fall to the sea which was quite rough when I was there. Maybe it is calmer at other times but I won't be going back to find out."
51,If you do a boat trip...,"This beach is full of Chinese tour busses and selfie stick armed tourists. We got there at 945 AM on a weekday in August, there was already no parking and beach was packed with tourists. Also you need to cloned down lots of steps on a metal staircase to the beach. If you want a nice, quiet wide beach, drive the extra 20km to Patara beach."
52,Such a lovey beach!,"I can easily say this beach is the most famous beach in Turkey, it is also world wide known. It is in Ka≈ü district of Antalya province. I went to this beach from Kalkan by minibus, it only took 5 minutes and I paid 3.5 TL. I went there early in the morning to make use of the morning light to shoot pix and videos. I stayed till noon and it got really busy. There is a cafe-restaurant here run by Ka≈ü Municipality and I was happy I could buy beer ;). There are also changing rooms and showers. The beach and the sea do not require any comment, they speak for themselves. You can sleep in peace to the awesome sound of the waves.Just go there and see foryourself. You will like it a lot for sure. Thank me later ;)"
53,Picturesque,"We loved Kaputas, it was mid-April and the water was still cold but the swim was great!.  Unlike other beaches (like Patara) the drop off is steep so it is easy to get into the water and swim.  The beach is a small cove so I imagine it gets crowded in summer but when we were there it was not at all crowded and just gorgeous"
54,crowded but breathtaking!,"During a 5-night stay in Kalkan, we spent a few hours at Kaputas Beach.  It's about a 15-minute drive from Kalkan.  It was during the EID holiday, so the beach and nearby parking was quite busy.  Lots of stairs that are quite steep, so a warning to those who are less able/fit.  Estimate of 200 stairs.  The area itself is quite beautiful & picturesque and lends itself well to HQ picture-taking.  However, the crowds during EID made it more difficult to enjoy.  Down at beach level, Kaputas also has showers, changing areas, and a casual restaurant.  Seats and umbrellas on the rocky-sand will cost you about 5 Euro each.  Food and drinks were quite reasonable.  My favorite item to eat there was the potato and cheese pancakes.  Wow!"
55,Steps,Kaputas is one of the best unspoiled beaches along the Turquoise coastline. It's within easy reach of towns like Kalkan (30mins) and Dalyan (40). Views are spectacular. Sunsets in the autumn are amazing. On site there are toilets and showers and a caf√© which sells your basic burgers and kebabs.
56,Best beach in Ka≈ü,"We stayed in nearby Kas we had a rental car and drove there, parking can be hard to find if you go late. It is a lot of steps down but was absolutely worth it. We paid 30 lira for 2 loungers and an umbrella. It‚Äôs a pebble beach so good to have aqua shoes with. The atmosphere is chilled , water is sublime. A absolutely must go to beach if you‚Äôre in the area."
57,Beach,This place is obviously one of the best beaches in Mediterranean. It is also free if you don't want to rent an ubrella and beach chairs. And if you want to they are so cheap.
58,It‚Äôs a beach,"The road between Kalkan and Kas is quite narrow but offers very nice views because it is surronded by high cliffs on the sea....Just in the middle, you will meet suddenly a small but wonderfull creek that ends in Kaputas beach.This is one on the few beaches with sands: the sea is blue, the sand is white and it is surronded by high cliffs that offer a very nice view.Sunbeds and umbrellas are available as well as a snack bar to drink/eat something easily.Pay attention on the parking: there is no a real parking but only unpaved areas between the road and the cliff (if you arrive from Kas, the widest area is just before the beach on the right side).If you arrive till here, you cannot miss this beach!!!"
59,Extraordinary beach,"Lovely place to visit, small sandy bay. To get to this beach you have to walk down a awful amount if steps but it is so worth it. There is a small cafe which was nit open when we went end April, changing huts also available.Very worth a visit."
60,One of the best,"This place is gorgeous! The water is refreshingly chilly in the heat of the day, thanks to fresh water springs from the Taurus mountains. Beautiful sandy beach and otherworldly turquoise water. A must for anyone traveling the Turkish Riviera."
61,Beautiful sea üê†,If this beach was in europe now all the world was talking about this beach ..as always turkish people dont know what they have but beach still very nice amazing colors on sea but have to be careful about waves...and sun can be dangerous be careful take yoyr sun umbrella with you
62,Good place to relax,The beach is lovely and the water is crystal BUT and it‚Äôs a big one the access is down lots of steps which is challengingly strenuous in hot weather. It is such a honey pot it is rammed and the roadside parking and often the associated walk is a nightmare. The road is often virtually blocked and chaotic. There is inherent danger walking in the road to reach the steps. Crime has been a problem but the police / security are now visible. My advice would be to grab a photo if you can and then give it a massive swerve and visit the vast sandy beach of patara instead!
63,One of a kind,"While Kaputa≈ü is by far the smallest beach on this list, its 500 feet of sand and surf make quite the lasting impression. Located right off the main coastal road between Antayla and Fethiye, Kaputas is hidden from view by steep, rocky cliffs, which shield the sandy enclave from the world above. Visitors must descend 186 steps to reach the picturesque beach, where the inlet‚Äôs calm, turquoise waters provide excellent swimming conditions. Be sure to arrive early to claim a lounge chair and umbrella, as the tiny beach fills up quickly in the summer months."
64,GREATT,"Kaputas beach is one of my favorite beaches in Turkey so far. I visited during the low season, so there were not so many transportation to go there. Luckily, we got hitchhike easily from our accommodation to this beach. The water is so clear, pure, turquoise color, a bit cold but so refreshing. We saw several fishes there. Very relaxing and peaceful beach. Definitely recommended place to visit if you come to this area."
65,Picturesque,The water is very nice and having lot of waves that is very fun for kids. Parking is an issue so plan to go there early and avoid weekends. There is also toilet and nice place to eat and drink. Prices are ok.
66,Beautiful & Crowded,Beautiful and calm !! The water is super clean and they have good cafe right on the top of the beach so that you can easily spend a full day relaxing.
67,Mental parking issues in peak season. ,Beautiful beautiful waters! Be sure to get there easily to get unspoiled photos! We got there around 10:30am and there was no more than 20ppl.
68,Amazing,"Don‚Äôt think twice, just go there. Absolutely stunning. There is a restaurant which however we haven‚Äôt used. They have showers and changing rooms available. Long chairs and umbrellas are available to rent at a decent price (30TLY for 2 long chairs and 1 umbrella)."
69,Beautiful beach,Kaputa≈ü Beach is very popular if you can park your car on the road and don't mind the people who are using the road! In my visit to Kalkan I've passed in front of the beach 6 times. All the time it was crowded and the sea was wavy. There are sunbeds and beach umbrellas you may rent. The beach looks nice with white sand.If you really want to visit get ready for the parking problem and crowd.Espy was enough for me ...
70,Might be 2nd beach after Oludeniz,Kaputas beach is 20 km s from kas. It has quite a nice view and the color of the sea is amazing. I would recommend to come with a taxi because in the busy hours the beach is quite full and you need to find a parking spot up by the road. There is a big spot for parking but it can be full. It is definetly worth to come. The sea was very wavy and we enjoyed it a lot to play with the waves.
71,Great,"This place is an real magic. No so quiet, as we expected (we visited kaputas during Turkish holidays), but beach is so beautiful. There was all necessery equipments - shower etc. Even small restaurant. Go there, you will find comfort and pure nature!"
72,Amazing view ,IT is fascinating and beautiful beach. You would prefer have a car for reaching the beach . The manicipality has given a great service for keeping clean the beach.
73,Lovely beach,If you stay in Kalkan or Kas a visit to Kaputas beach is a must. Tiny cove reached by lots of steps but worth it. There is a small council run cafe serving limited food so if you are fussy or want a salad take your own . The water is very clear but the beach shelves quite steeply so take care with small children or if you are not a confident swimmer. Overall one of the best beaches around and mainly used by locals so a great sign .
74,A piece of heaven on earth,Since the authorities decided to fill the this beautiful beach with sun beds and parasols it has become incredibly busy and somewhat uncomfortable. The cafe is dark and dismal. The food is very average.
75,A must see...,"This mixed sand/pebble beach isn't too far from Kalkans (inferior) beach, just get the local dolmus from Kalkan centre near school/taxi rank, it costs 3.5 tl pp each way. Descend about 100+ steps to walkway/beach. Managed by Law Council and has Clean toilets(Turkish style) and changing rooms available. Also new cafe that provides simple but good quality food & drinks, such as Turkish pancakes, hamburgers, etc. Parasols & sunbeds, about 5tl each or day.Lifeguard normally on duty, swimming safety line to stop boats ingress to most of beach."
76,Beautiful beach,Amazing beach at a perfect location. The view of the beach from the road is stunning. You cannot take away your eyes from the beauty of this placeenjoy very cold water of showers at the hot summer
77,Stairways down to heaven,"We went today (30/10/2017) and the beach was very empty. The waves were massive which was really fun. The waves can be hit and miss, either big or small but today they were amazing!"
78,Lovely beach. Lot of steps ,"Must see this beach. Amazing, Clean and safe here is like Maldives.  Also you can buy foods, drinks, alcohol."
79,Lovely beach,We got there at 3:30 and there was no parking. Get there early. The beach has blue water and is absolutely beautiful. Wavy and comfortable. Worth going out there to visit. But do not drive from Butterfly valley. Google maps brought us through gravel road and dirt roads. Surprised my tires didn't break. Take the 400 to get there.
80,Best beach between Antalya and Izmir,Nice clean beach with good view ... can get a bit crowded so try to go early to have good seats. Simple restaurants are available there too
81,Turquoise! ,I use to love coming here before there were sun beds and a cafe. Now it is  over crowded and sun beds every where.Will only go now off season.
82,Very good,"The water color is really amazing (Turquoise) I really enjoyed my time there, but the one issue was the weather. It was really hot on Aug."
83,Busy but beautiful ,"Crystal clear water, beautiful view, a must see when you visit Ka≈ü. A great place to swim and have a drink."
84,Best beach by far....,I think It is 20 km away from kas . We parked on the side of the road . We took pictures from top view . You need to pass the stairs to go down .  It was magnificent . It is better to go early in the morning to find empty chair and umbrella . The water was clear and like crystal. It is one of the best beaches i have ever seen . I strongly recommend everyone to go there and enjoy
85,Best beach,"Beautiful beach, one of our all time favorite, easy to get to from either Kas or Kalkan, go early to avoid crowds. Chair and umbrella rental only 5 Lira each. Also toilets and showers available. There is a restaurant there but we didnt eat there. Can take your own drinks ans snacks. Water is crystal clear."
86,Nice beach,Strongly recommended to spend a day on this beach. It is very natural. Crystal clear blue water. Very clean. Basic building. Only some beach shacks. Different shades of blue color.
87,Sandy beach,You can get to this little gem by mini bus or car. Its a bit risky with a car since parking is very limited and extremely crowded.The beach is a bit wavy but very clean and nice. 5tl for umbrellas and 5tl for beach bed. Restaurant has limited food but I enjoyed the gozleme. Get here early because it gets super crowded.
88,Prefect day at beach ,"This beach well deserves its reputation as one of the best beaches in the world. The sand feels velvety, gently brushing your feet under the sea. No wonder caretta caretta turtles choose to lay their eggs here, the newborns can easily reach the sea. Take a boat trip from dalyan and stay here at least an hour. It's nearly 5 km long and the best spot is at the rivers mouth. If you want to see the turtles, drive to the other end of the beach. The caretta caretta hospital is on the way."
89,Amazing Sea,"This beach is located 20km west of Kas. I did not see public transportation from city center, if you have car there is parking around beach. You have to go down like 300 stairs to reach beach. entrance is free but if you want to take sunset seat that is extra 7.5 trl. Prices are not too expensive 1 coke or fanta or sprite was 6 trl and beer was 25 trl."
90,Large sany beach near the main road,"this beach between kalkan and kas could not be missed, you will have to down long stone and wooden steps to get to the beach which is not very easy if you going with kids the water is clear but it's not a sandy beach."
91,Insanely crowded .,"With its clean turquoise waters and refreshing atmosphere, this is a must visit in Ka≈ü.The scenery from above and on the beach is breath taking and takes you away from it all.Water is very cool (which is good for hot Ka≈ü days) and clean. There is limited resources on the beach so take your own water and snacks. Since it can be crowded and waves can be very strong in the afternoon, aim to go there early in the morning and enjoy!"
92,Fun and enjoyable,We enjoyed a day at the most beautiful beach. Our kids enjoyed the waves that some of the other beaches in the area don‚Äôt have.  If you are in Ka≈ü you must go to Kaputa≈ü.
93,Mixed feelings,It is great if you can find place to park your car. There are 110 steps down to the beach. Hence it is for the energetic and adventures persons.
94,Meh,"Lovely beach. Quite small, but very popular. I can imagine it can get quite busy, both at the beach and finding parking at peak season. Good facilities once down a lot of steps to the beach level."
95,Stunning ,"Beautiful beach out of town , limited parking. Has facilities. Too far to walk. Very busy on Kalkan road."
96,The Mediterranean Carribean Sea,"It's a very secluded place when it's off season and has a great view and environment, but it can be quite busy during high season, also not that easy to get there, definitely not wheelchair friendly."
97,50 shades of blue,"40 km away from Kas, still worth visiting so that you can enjoy a whole day in one of the most beautiful beaches in Turkey let alone Kas or Antalya! The bad part is it's wise to take public transport from Kas or Kalkan (10 km away) b/c it's real difficult to get parking (no other option but to park on Kas-Feyhiye highway, which is too narrow)."
98,Amazing beach,"Busy but not overly crowded. Sandy/stoney beach, beautiful water with some large waves not suitable for very young children."
99,Nice beach ,"I didn't know water could be this color of turquoise. It is a quick dolmus ride from the Kas city center and worth an all-day stay. The beach chairs and umbrellas are inexpensive. Bring along a picnic or order food from the small shop on the beach (a tad expensive, but also handy)."
100,Best Best Best,"Get a sun bed with umbrella and relax the day away at this stunning beach! Our teenagers climbed and jumped off the rocks on the left and the watercolor is beyond belief. After a few dips, best to leave your flip flops at waters edge for the small rocks start to hurt a bit."
101,Kas trips: places must be visited,"If you are in Turkey around Mediterranean sea you have to come by kaputas beach and experience the waves, the sand and sea itself. It's an amazing water. Everything is pretty cheap, but choices are limited. No alcohol is served."
102,Lovely waves ,"Beautiful beach, accessed by stairs. Small restaurant at the beach was closed when we got there in the early evening. Chairs must be rented, or bring your towel to lay on the beach. Enjoy!"
103,Be careful with kids,"Quickly deepening water great for swimming, we were the first people here and had the place to ourselves which was lovely.  Good clean facilities too."
104,Great sea bad crowd,"Unhappily the beach was really excellent, fabulous indeed. But now there's a cafe restaurant and many sunbeds on the beach. And as every place it was excellent without human intervention. I really can't understand why we always have to destroy, leave a trace, possess‚Ä¶ We always forget why this place was so attractive and fabulous. I censure all the authorities which are involved. Congrats to you all, you've destroyed another God's masterpiece and all my youth memories."
105,Nature‚Äôs Wonderful Beach and,Very nice  sand beach clean amazing view much more beautiful than petra you must see while you are there
106,The best of Blue,Get there early. Parking is now a nightmare!Still a lovely beach but a lot busier these days. There are now sun beds as well as parasols to rent.
107,"Beautiful beach, worth the steps!",This beach is on the way to Kas center. It can be  crowded if you arrive at noon time. You have park your vehicle at the top of cliff.
108,Simply OMG,Visited in September and the weather and crowds was perfect. The beach is absolutely beautiful against the backdrop of the dramatic cliffs. Restaurant and ice cream.available so one can spend an entire day here
109,Compact & busy but stunning,Its a place that you can see on your way from Ka≈ü to Kalkan. It has a beautiful seaside looks like maldives with its white sand. You can eat and drink something at the cafeteria. You have to see this place and swim if you come by.
110,Great experience ,Visited when turkish families were off with their children.  It's only 4 miles from kalkan up the coast.  Parking along the side of the road wherever you can and walk down the steps.  It's very photogenic but the sand itself is small stones.  Not harsh on the feet but they stick all over your body and are a right pain.  Beds without covers are 5.50tl and so are sunshades.
111,"Beautiful beach, clean, rough waters, busy, easy to get to from Kas","Kaputas Beach is one of the world‚Äôs best protected areas with a hidden canyon passsliding into a large spectacular beach, often with large waves and great surf. A must see in the Mediterranean."
112,Photos do not do it justice,"Kaputas is a true gem - nature‚Äôs wonderful beach slapped by foamy surf surrounded by truly turquoise water, blue and green mixed in shades covered by steep magnificient Taurus mountains. There is a restaurant and plenty of beach chairs free of charge. Overall, it is a location to be definitely visited."
113,Small beautiful overcrowded ,A nice little beach that is around 25 mins from Kas. You can get there by taking a dolmus from but be sure to check the timetable for going back to Kas.
114,Spectacular beach along the coastal road,"Truly amazing beach in the middle of a highway, did not expect the water to be so clear. Definitely worth your visit!"
115,Good for half a day,Excellent beach with lovely views. The toilets are a bit disgusting so wouldn't advise spending a whole day here but still nice to go for a swim and is free entry. The drive up here can be long but it's worth it.
116,Commercial beach,"Water is amazing. When you look up you directly see the canyon. I think it has an entrance fee but I am not sure. but it would worth it. we visited there in the late afternoon, therefore, I am not sure about the capacity. It may be crowded in the afternoon. But even though it is crowded it is worth to go anyway."
117,Fantastic water!,"Such a beautiful beach, the water is calm and warm.  Very busy in summer, very hot.  You need to rent an parasol, but they run out quickly and you must wait in the hot sun for a while."
118,Now developed - now ruined,"very crowded due to popularity of the beach, the beach is beautiful of course(must see) but very hard to find a parking space and very difficult enjoy this beautiful place with thousands! of people."
119,Beatiful Beach,"super beautiful sandy beach with torquiose water layer, most beautiful beach in my opinion in the region! Bed and umbrella super cheap, only 5 TL for the rest of the day! come in may for view tourist and nice weather"
120,do not!,"Beautiful beach, with showers and cafe. The sea is clear and warm and it's more of a sandy beach than other beaches in the area."
121,Beautiful beach with facilities,We spent a morning on the beach as we were exploring the coats near Kas.  The parking near to the beach was easy and the steps down and back up not that bad.  Compared to other beaches on our trip we found this a bit crowded given it was low season and a bit too close to the main road. It was also the only beach where we had to pay for loungers and umbrellas even if we bought a drink.  All that being said the sea was beautiful to swim and we had a nice morning there.
122,the place to be,"This beach is perfect for a day out, don't let the steps put you off, there are 184 steps but there are railings to help you, it's cost 10 lira for lounger and umbrella for the day, you can get a lite snack and water from the locals who sell on the beach, the beach is of a course sand so beach shoes are useful. You do need to be aware that when walking into the sea the seabed drops so you are out of your depth quite quickly so I personally wouldn't take young children. The sea has a strong currant and quite big waves. There are toilets and changing rooms for your use. This beach is well worth a visit."
123,Busy,"I am sure that this beach must be seen once in a lifetime. Altough ƒ±t is always crowded, the sand and sea is amazing."
124,Must Visit,A must see when visiting Kas if only for the view.  This beach involves walking down a long flight of stairs from the main road if you're not up for the walk then just admire the view from the road.
125,Best Beach in Ka≈ü area,"The color of sea and the sandy beach is great, really loved that place. There is a cafe where you can buy something to eat&drink. There is no entrance fee but you need to pay to rent sunbeds and umbrellas but the prices are cheap. Recommend to go there in the morning before it gets too crowded and also in the morning, sea is more calm and nice for swimming."
126,Beautiful Beach,We parked on the side of the road which was quite a bit higher than the beach. We stopped and took some picture from a top view which was gorgeous. Then we hiked down about 200 stairs to the beach. We were surprised to see a sign that rental of beach chairs and umbrellas were only 5 lira each. Very cheap. It is better to go earlier in the morning as you get a closer parking and the beach isn't so crowded. The water on the right was crystal clear but the water on the left was a bit milky. Would recommend a visit.
127,Stunning!! ,"One of the prominent beaches that is preserved very good ! Although it is deep, it is one of the cleanest point on that coast ! Must swim there once in a life time !"
128,Best Beach I've ever been to!,"Like anything worth finding, there's a bit of effort involved. This beach is beautiful and the sea is a blue I've never seen before! If you're staying in Kalkan the steps are just like the hills :) huge waves are so much fun, and just a few feet beyond them you can float cheerfully and watch the action. 3 lira each on the dolmus, 10 for a bed & brolly and 8 lira for the most delicious gozleme (pancake) means a cheap day out too. My 4 yo loved the waves although he took a bit of warming up and had arm bands on. Grab a cold can on your way back up to the bus stop and take lots of pictures! *p.s. there's a timetable for the buses back so not too much hanging around."
129,Beautiful beach,"Colour of sea, a real turquaz is awesome. If you catch the sea once there is no wave it is also nice with crystal water but waves are totally for fun:)"
130,Use to be Lovely,"Fantastic beach to stop off at while driving up the turquois coast.  They had shower facilities to wash off and bathrooms if needed.  Be prepared to rent a chair or umbrella or be forced to the far corners which are only available for those that do not want to rent.  Since we would only be there for an hour we were fine stashing our towels off to the side.  Parking is tricky as it is on the side of the road, so go earlier in the day if possible as it can get VERY crowded"
131,Stunning beach with good facilities,"I love this place, I come every year, excellent view, amazing waves, always fun to hang with friends and watch the landscape"
132,Great colour,I am in love with this beach! Try to go early in the morning. It is so crowded in afternoon and parking is a real problem. The sea is wavy also after a certain hour.
133,Worth seeing ,"A must see place while in ka≈ü or nearby. Fantastic sea. Even when you are looking from above it looks fascinating, swimming there is another experince."
134,Beautiful location,"Loved this beach, beautiful and a wonderful backdrop of mountains. It's a bit of a hike getting back up if you have walking problems but even then the view from above the beach is worth it."
135,Breathtaking Kaputas! ,Very cool beach with amazing shades of blue water. Easy and sheep transport from Ka≈ü and Kekova. Also big bus compaies can drop you of if you are passing by. Showers and cafetaria on the beach. Lots of stairs :)
136,beatiful,Even when there is no international travel due to Covid-19. The cars parked by the highway is a disturbing scene. Sea is lovely but nothing you cannot get elsewhere in Turkey.
137,Wonderful bay ,"Beautiful beach but no chance to enjoy people actually queuing and the term packed in like sardines comes to mind . Tried to go early to no avail .The Secrets Out . A real Shame but  inevitable considering how small and the stair access . Was  amazing 4-5 years ago , memories!!."
138,"super beautiful, but bring food and drinks!",Great place to spend time on the beach and swim in protected bay. A few steps down from D400 road just outside of Kalkan and not far from Kas.
139,Beach with view,"Stoney beach, lovely water but surprisingly cold for August!  Got a bed for 15TL, beautiful setting, simple snacks available.  Parking is a nightmare especially at weekend when the locals drive down from Istanbul.  Worth going as it's such a spectacular setting."
140,A perfect beach,"Stunning cove, dramatic, electric blue water but unfortunately somewhat spoiled by the amount of congestion and tourists. Well worth a visit but I‚Äôd recommend going at 6am to truly enjoy it."
141,Stunning beach,"one of the best beach ever been to !! amount the top five for me anyway , just a tad below the famous Mrytos beach in Greece .10 minutes drive tops from Kalkan , you should go after two o'clock as the day tripper start heading back ! the best place to be is the right hand side cliff face so you don't have to pay for the chairs and parasol"
142,"Nice and clean, but wavy sea","The service on beach is not perfect, but it's OK. Service is friendly for you and your wallet as well. And this is the best beach near to Ka≈ü, but Patara is better."
143,Huge waves!,"Not too many beaches in the area, so it would be crowded in season.We managed photos with nobody there, really pretty with white sand and aqua sea. And islands in background"
144,Sea is beautiful,"The beach is so lovely but make sure you go there in the early morning because later it gets full. I also think prices are too high, for water and one beer i paid 19 TRY."
145,One of the best beaches in Turkeyl,This beach has a turquoise sea and it‚Äôs just awesome. It should be seen. When the weather is windy it‚Äôs very difficult to swim. I advice everybody to visit it.
146,best beach in Kas,The beach is clean with perfect waves. There is a decent cafe with changing room facilities and showers. What more can you ask for? We had a brilliant day
147,Nice beach ,"We came there about 10 a.m. and the beach was not crowded. We came by taxi from Kas, 110 tl. But therr are small buses going there from main bus station in Kas every 30 min with AC. The drive is very nice and cheep, 6 tl.Beach itself is very nice. The colours of the see is just amaizing!You have rrstaurant and wc there.You need to pay for 2 sunbeds and umbrela about 30 tl.After 12 s lot of people came and I belive in the afternoon even more. So we left abot 1 p.m.Nice to see ehen you have time."
148,out of this world,"Very beautiful beach, clean and crystal clear water (cold thought!), wonderful view from the road (which also beautiful, surrounded by mountains). This is a stone beach, so probably it will be more comfortable if you take a yoga mat with you so the stones won‚Äôt hurt you. There‚Äôs a restaurant, but probably it is much cheaper if you take some snakes and drinks. Definitely a must see in Kas! :)"
149,Hidden gem,Great beach with an amazing sea. Decent facilities for changing cabins and shower. Meals and drinks are served as well with avarage prices. Handicapped people should consider the stairs of 150+ steps.
150,A good public access beach outside Kalkan,"Wow, what a stunning beach! Free parking is on the D400 between Kalkan & Kas alongside the cliff rocks and on the main road. We arrived before 10am to avoid problems with parking and we are glad we did (you need to be confident with your parking skills!) 15L for two beds and one sun brolly. Kids loved the waves, but they can be strong at times so care is needed. Depth drops off quite quickly too. 4 or 5 showers with wooden changing room huts, toilets and small cafe. Yes a steep climb down & up but well worth the effort."
151,Amazing,"Found it on our was to Kas. Small and beautiful beach. The water is unbelievable, warmAns so clear. Came back on my last day if vacation"
152,a popular but crownded and windy beach,"Hard to find park space, but facility and the beach was fabolous. Toilletes are sucks. Mu wife was stuck in there and called for help. Do not go to wc allone! , you need a company if you have clostrofobia or similar obsessiveness."
153,Giving 5 stars for the first time,"Crazy beautiful place but because it is vere wavy, dont leave your kids unattended. The sea floor goes deep all of a sudden. The water is so clear and cold. Go there very early in the morning to have less trouble with parking. The place is run by the government. Quite cheap, food is nice. You can have a shower and change clothes. Enjoy it!"
154,Amazing bay,We visited at the end of October so no problems with parking and the beach wasn't at all crowded.  There's a cafe offering the usual snacks - I recommend the G√∂zleme. Facilities all adequate.  The beach is clean and even in October the sea was surprisingly warm.  Plenty of little fish to see if you're into snorkeling.
155,Just great!!!,"Great, clean, cheap, parking can be problem if you come late afternoon. Temiz, ucuz, yuzulmesi gereken bir plaj."
156,Budy,"You can reach via your car, or shuttles, it is around 20-30 minutes from Kas center (by car). It is just next to the road. The view is very nice, sea is clean (it has a certificate), but not so much good for swimming. Beach itself is made of pebble stone; there is a stair to go down to the beach from the road, with a considerable amount of steps. So I will not recommend visiting it during the noon, or when the sun is up above. There was no store for some food/drink at the time I visited."
157,Natural pebble beach,"The beach is so popular, so it is  crowded. lot of waves, there is a free shower and the bus stops just infront of it"
158,Beautiful turquoise sandy beach ,Lovely beach half way between Kas and Kalkan. Sunbeds and umbrellas for hire and cold drinks also available to keep the thirst at bay. Steps down to the beach from parking at the side of the road.
159,"Hidden treasure of Turkey, stunning beach!","beautiful sandy beach, the sea is clean with high waves, a bit crowded on Saturday but still fun. It‚Äôs not accessible for handicapped; there is a lot of stairs in order to reach the beach. There is a restaurant, changing rooms, WC, showers, beach beds and umbrellas. Great location."
160,The beach !,"Absolutely stunning views from the top of the beach and the sea is just breathtaking. However, it is very, very busy and not massive, but well worth a visit for a couple of hours. It is very busy up where the parking is also.  Good beer and wine in the cafe area."
161,Nice to visit once,The most beautiful beach I've been before. It is so clean and kind of deep. It would be better to go at the early morning so it would not be so crowded.
162,Perfect beach day,"Just had to visit Kaputas beach again on our second visit to Turkey.Get there early to find a parking space. We hired two sun beds and a parasol for 15TL for the day. Beautiful golden sand and clear and warm water in which to swim. The beach is run by the municipality of Kas and has toilets,showers and changing huts plus a cafe."
163,beautiful bay,"Excellent scenery,a perfect place to enjoy the sea,you see different tones of blue,a place to visited if you are in Antalya"
164,good beach,"We stayed in Kas and drove the 30minute drive to Kaputas. We went nice and early (before 9am) to get 2 sunbeds and a umbrella which cost us 22.50 liras. The beach was already filling up and parking is quite tricky so the earlier you're there the better. There is a restaurant and bathroom facilities. The beach itself is nice, though we need to get use to pebbly beaches ;) so best to take some shoes that are easy to walk over pebbles."
165,A swim to remember,"The beach is not far from Kalkan,which is also a very nice place.The beach can be reached from the coast road by a stairway with over one hundred steps,a little difficult when you are returning from the sea level.There are not very many people on the beach and this is very nice.The mountains around are spectacular,very high and wild and offer a very special contrast with the sea.I would come back for sure."
166,beautiful beach,"We went mid week to avoid the crowds but it was very busy, obviously a popular place but it wasn't for us. Most of the beach was populated by sun loungers and parasols...the food in the cafe looked ok but was so busy we couldn't get a table, after 10 mins we left and went back to Kalkan! Disappointed"
167,To much hype,"Loved everything about this beach - the location, the vibe, the waters. We drove from Antalya and even the drive was so picturesque. Definitely recommend!"
168,Beautiful Beach in Kas,"The owner of our accommodation recommended this beach to us. Our bus to Kalkan from Kas had passed it earlier in the day and it did look special. And so it is. Don't bother with a taxi, just get a bus from the bus station and ask them for The place (pronounced KAPOOTASH). It's only a few lira."
169,Lovely beach,Unfortunately this beauty has become fully commercial with umbrellas and cafe. Ut was a natural beauty some years ago and this has been destroyed !!
170,Super super super ! ,Wow just wow. The beach is beautiful! The water is like 5 different shades of blue. What I will like to add here is information that I would have liked to have known before going. 1) There are a gazillion steps going down to the beach so be prepared to get out of your taxi/car to make the hike down. If you want amazing pictures stop and take pictures at the top and as you go down the steps because the beach and it‚Äôs waters are truly amazing!2) there is only one restaurant on the beach and that‚Äôs half way down the climb to the beach so if u need to go to the toilet/use the changing rooms/grab drinks do that before you get all the way down.3) there are deck chairs with umbrellas to hire as the only shade u‚Äôll have is from the umbrella4) the beach is pebbly unfortunately but there is some sand nearer to the water however the waters are extremely rough (or at least when we were there) so we couldn‚Äôt enjoy a peaceful swim you would get dragged out to the sea and lobbed back on the shore.. but that was not stopping all the people there from going in.
171,Turkish maldivian,"This beautiful spot is now managed by the Kas Municipality and they have done a fantastic job with the new descent and the restaurant.  The beach has always been stunning, and now there are facilities for the crowds.  Recommend going first thing in the morning before it gets too busy ."
172,Amazing Beach,"A beautiful beach with turquoise sea and pale sand.  The waves are amazing and my two sons literally spent hours diving into them and floating around.  The steps back up aren't actually too bad.  We got there early-ish, 10am on a Monday, and there were already quite a lot of people already sunbathing.  There is a constant stream of people arriving all day and the beachfront did on occasion get very crowded.  Parking at 10am was easy but I imagine it would be very problematic later in the day.  We had a brilliant day and will be returning soon."
173,A must see natural wonder of Kas,"A short drive from Kas and accessible from the road down a steep set of stone steps this beautiful beach, as featured on the cover of Lonely Planet guide to Turkey is well worth a visit. Steeply shelving from the water‚Äôs edge and with a rope and buoys marking the ‚Äòpatrolled‚Äô extent for swimming the water at the end of July was warm enabling an hour‚Äôs swim in comfort. Whilst cliff diving on the northern edge by local men was verbally discouraged by the life guards it was not stopped. Beach beds and umbrellas were available but popular. Parking also limited so get there early if you‚Äôd like to spend the day there - a cafe is available too - or go later in the day had finish off with an enjoyable swim off a spectacular beach. I‚Äôd go again if I had half a chance!"
174,Nice beach but poor service ,"Maybe it's because I'm used to going to beaches in Portugal, thought there was just too much hype about it. Maybe it's because I don't like pebbles. If you're in to that, then I'm sure you'll love it"
175,Wonderful,"We went there 2 days, but there where no space to park the car, and it was very crowd. I dont recommend going there during weekends."
176,Natural Beauty,"One of the most spectacular view. The sea is perfect. Kas Municipality is working great. Showers, changing rooms are free. Unlike most of the beaches, there is no entrance fee for the beach. Highly recommended"
177,the color of water,"Great views, lovely beach, the sand is a little course, water is great. The steps up and down to beach can be a problem if old or not very mobile.The extra facilities on the beach are handy but it have spoiled it a little in my opinion."
178,all shades of blue!,Beautiful (vivid) blue water in spectacular surroundings. 192 steps' ascent from the road. Not the easiest waters to negotiate in strong winds. Better on a calm day. Regular buses from Ka≈ü and Kalkan until about 7. Umbrellas available. Worth the effort to visit.
179,Beautiful but avoid weekends,"One of the best of the world. 180 steps to the beach but worth it. Umbrellas or beds are 5,5 TL. Waves are sometimes too big. Really clean and blue like sky!"
180,Beautiful but small beach,"A lovely beach in a fantastic setting, good facilities interesting parking. not for the unfit or those who dont like heights lots of steps to descend to get there"
181,Great view,Amazing beach with calm water blue turquoise the sand it's great but bring shoes cause at the extremities there are a lot of rocks. And if u pretense to go please go with Tina causa the parking it's really difficult there. And if u walk at the tarmac be careful it's really sticky.
182,One of the best beaches in the world,"Located about 17kms from Kas, we found this beach by accident driving towards Kas from Fethiye. It's located on a hairpin bend with free off road parking, and there is a narrow canyon with an interpretation board depicting some of the rare flora of the area. There are a large number of steps to what is a naturally small but beautifully sandy beach. The combination of the golden sand, blue water and mountains make for an irresistibly beautiful combination. There are sun lounges presumably for hire, some toilets and there also appeared to be small  huts for changing. We were surprised at the facilities at such a small location. We think people rave about this beach not only because it is genuinely beautiful, but because there are so few beaches  in the Kas area, and towards Fethiye they are more pebbley and look much less attractive. Call in if you are passing at the very least - recommended - but be aware that there is a busy road directly above.There's a very handy bus stop directly at the entrance to the beach at the top of the steps complete with a timetable."
183,Miracle,"To park a car is a nightmare and cause's a lot of problems, through July and August it is like being on a beach in Spain.Steps down to the beach are only for the fit."
184,Nice place to spend a day at the beach,Not the most amazing beach but great swimming once you have made it down the steps to the pebble and finally to the sand.  Not for snorkelli g but play I  the waves
185,The Best Beach in Ka≈ü,Beach is amazing.  Come by 9 am and no later.  5 Lira per beach item rental is dirt cheap.  food is ok.
186,Nice but crowded ,"Our favourite beach between Antalya and Izmir.Large pebbles, not sand.Crystal clear water teeming with fish when we were there.Visited three days in a row at different times.Gets very busy. Parking is very limited on a winding highway.Approximately 150 steps to be climbed down to access the beach.Very scenic spot with high cliffs at either end of the beach and behind - postcard type scene."
187,Love the new look,"This was a beautiful beach. Very clean with turquoise waters. Worth the steps to get to it. Get here early though, it gets very busy. The cafe is cheap as are the sun loungers. I would recommend beach shoes though. It's quite uneven with large pebbles to get into the water. Once in though it was lovely."
188,"OK food, excellen beach",Very nice sandy beach and deep blue colored sea in dramatic canyon about 20 minutes from Ka≈ü. A must see and do when in this area.
189,Hidden gem!,"Turquoise water of the sea white small sandy stone beach, colder water than most places in Antalya here you are in kaputas. We found it first on our hobeymoon and 7 years we have dreamt to come back to this locrly place. At that time no facilies were but now you have shuttles from city center;showers,toilets and umbrellas üòä Enjoy it, if you are around it is in must visit list !"
190,cute beach,Best time I had during my visit to Kas! I was there with my wife and another couple in early april. We were the only ones most of the time. We explored the canyon for a bit and them relaxed on the beach during sunset. The view is amazing from the hwy and down at the beach! Ive grown up by the beach and visited countless beaches all over the world in around 24 countries. This beach is in the top 5! Take some snacks and a few beers or wine and chillax in awesomeness!!
191,Natural beach,"We spent a lovely afternoon at Kaputas beach with 4 children aged 15 years to 18 months.  We all had a lovely time.  The water is turquoise and crystal clear and there was a lovely surf, which we all loved diving into.  We were told that it's a sandy beach and part of it is, however, where we were sat it was a bit more gravelly. The beach itself is just off an A-type road and accessed via steep, stone stairs which aren't in the best state of repair.  As so often in Turkey, take care when walking down with small children. the handrail had big gaps in it and we had to carry our toddler down to make sure she doesn't take a tumble. It's totally worth the effort though, as the beach is clean, unspoilt and as everywhere along this stretch of coast, it has retained its natural beauty, which took our breath away.  5 stars for natural beauty without a doubt!!!A couple of negatives: the sunloungers aren't the most comfortable, and take care not to sit too close to the rock face at the either end as there can be rockfall .  There are signs there to warn visitors of this risk but they were written in Turkish so they weren't much use to us. Overall we rate this beach as very good, mainly because of its beautiful location.  If the stairs and signage were improved, I'd rate it five stars!"
192,Still beautiful!,The water is amazing but the waves can get dangerous at times. especially be careful with little children
193,A nice beach 20 km west of Kas.,Went in a Sunday afternoon and it was completely full.. nice to see the ocean but just to busy.. probably one to avoid on a Sunday ..
194,Stunning! ,"When I first saw the pictures of Kaputas Beach when I was a kid, I thought that this is a beach from elsewhere in world! The texture of sea and sand is so different than the rest of even nearby beaches in Turkey. Definitely a must see place. Unlike other coastal facilities, this beach is completely intact which means you can't find shower, WC, or other facilities. So you need to consider all those facts before going there. The view both from the beach and atop the beach is breathtaking. It is located between the districts Ka≈ü and Kalkan so you need a private car or take minibuses that travel between those two coastal towns."
195,Blue Heaven,very clean kept beach  with some  fast food and cold and hot beverage  service  restaurant area  no music just nature front and behind water like swimming pool must see  must swimm sea before you die ...
196,Natural beauty,This beach is probably the one of the best beaches in the world. It is now run by the local municipality which eases the life there even more. Cleaner and cheaper than ever before. The landscape from the top is faboulous.
197,Great day at the best beach !!,"Only 10 minutes out of Kas, this beach was all that it promised to be. Tidy, clean, and most importantly - quiet, Kaputas is a beautiful beach to visit if you're staying in or around Kas. The cove-like position guarantees calm and clean water. Arriving early in the morning is recommended if you want good parking on the road above. After you enjoy the beautiful view from the road above, climb down about 100 steps to the beach, where you can rent a bed + umbrella for cheap rates. There is a restaurant, toilets and changing rooms with tap showers as well."
198,Beautiful hidden beach,"Beautiful, pristine beach by crystalline water. Lots of stairs to get up and down if you are with the very young or very old. Pay 5TL for a bed and stay as long as you like taking in the breathtaking views. Go early to avoid the crowds. We had the place to ourselves at 10am"
199,Never ending steps - but OMG that beach is worth it !,I cam only describe it as heaven on earth. Well worth spending a day there. Easy to find but take an umbrella as its a sun trap. Lovely and quiet. Not too crowded.
200,Best beach ever,Spectacular beach along the coastal road and isolated. A long walk down and up from the road. Parking limited. Very sheltered and idyllic beach newly renovated and set up well by the local council.
201,"A beautiful beach, particularly out of season ",On the main road to Kalkan down a cliff. A small beautiful spot but by far too overcrowded with almost no parking possibilities. Go there at the end of the day. There are some amenities and food stalls.
202,Lovely little beach,Water is so clear! You just want to stay there the whole day admiring the beauty. It's good for swimming and sunbathing.
203,Paradise like...,Excellent sea water quality between two mountains. Clean sandy beach. You can enjoy the waves on the beach. Regular transport from Kalakan and Kas as it is on main road. Free to access however you have hire sunbed and unmbrella for 5 TL each. Refreshments are also sold on site. We spent a fantastic afternoon definitely worth a visit.
204,Heaven,"Amazing water and a fantastically well run beach by the local council. Cafe isn't too expensive, showers are free, and what parking there is (on the road) is free too. Great fun in the waves, must do!"
205,One of the best!,Stoped here for a couple of hours amazing beach lots of steps so you need to be fit good for children nice surfing waves and azure blue sea
206,Very beautiful in spring,"If you visit this area, make sure you visit Kapatas. Super beach, clear blue sea, and great fun with the waves. Does get deep really quickly, so weaker swimmers need to go careful.From the top, great views looking down."
207,Amazing view,"Can be crowded in high season and you might need to park far away on the side of the road and walk, unless you go with bus from Kal. Umbrellas available for rent at a normal price. Restaurant is not the best unfortunately, it‚Äôs one of the municipalities Sosyal Tesisleri but the food is not any special at all, and you cannot find alcohol here. The beach is so beautiful and it‚Äôs possible to jump safely from the cliffs, and if you bring you snorkeling equipment you can enjoy the deep water and the fishes."
208,pure beauty,"Around 200 steps down to this beach which has a self service cafe serving good food at average prices. The sun beds and parasols are quite pricey considering you don't get a mattress for the bed, the sandy beach is rare around here (man made) and the sea is warm. Plenty of sun cream required and remember the steps on the way back up! dolmus from Kas also stops here on the way to Kalkan but make sure to get here early as it does get packed."
209,Lovely views and beach.,When I visited there it was so wavy and I could not swim properly. Even the wave put me into the sand and I feel it was little bit dangerous. Btw I know how to swim but it was not easy to control.
210,Breathtaking beach,"Very nice beach, but the lack of shadow can be hard to endure.... It¬¥s possible to rent a sunbed with shade, but I¬¥m a bit anoyed about that, because this pearl should be free to use, in the same mannor as the rock beaches in Kas, where you don¬¥t have to pay for your sunbed/shade....."
211,Best Beach,"The beach is not what it was. Rewind 5 years and the beach was totally uninhabited. You had to drive to the site and walk down all the crumbling steps to the beach. The sand would be super hot and unmarked by foot. The sea was warm and slightly pebbly with great snorkeling spots around the rocks and a few little waves now and again. This day and age the while beach is covered in sunbeds, you cannot move on the bend because of the traffic and huge coach loads of people that come here. What once was a paradise is now a cluttered loud and over populated tint space of beach.  Such a shame."
212,Heaven on a beach ,"Calm down keep to Ka≈ü Come to Kaputaj Beach!Wonderful sea, good opportunity such as free changing room, Free shower, cheap food . The Kaputaj manage by municipality of Ka≈ü so all is well for turist. There is bus, minibus from Ka≈ü to kaputaj along with you may go there in 15 minutes by car. Enjoy!"
213,Nice beach,"Don't go !!! It's a joke - nice idea BUT big swell, no safe parking and WAY too many people. It is popular for NO reason - Kas and Kalkan have so many better places to go to have a beach time and so much nicer."
214,It's got the wow factor,Great scene with blue turquoise colored sea... Very peaceful and refreshing.Nice spot for swimming and relaxing.
215,Perfect Beach and Sea,it is like a being in a movie. the turquoise color of the sea is the most beatiful one ƒ± have ever seen.
216,Crowded,"Unforgettable place. Amazing colors in May, June, warm water in the end of august! It is like blue lagoon in the heart of mountains."
217,What a Surprise!,"Clean, very pretty beach. Waves are quite choppy, beach guard on duty so you feel safe. Beach bar ok, good selection of food and drink. Food took a little while to arrive but overall good and staff are friendly. There are quite a few steps down to he beach and going back up is quite windy. Be careful to hold on to your hat!"
218,Progress ??,200 stairs to reach. but worth it. there is sunbeds and umbrellas for 15TL total. and also there is one cafe for lunch. Prices was good. The sea is wavely. But not cold. and clear. Must go
219,great view down...,When driving along the coast you wouldn't even know the beach was there if it wasn't for the cars parked on either side of the road.  As you head down the steps the beautiful clear blue water will take your breath away. It was a really hot day however the water was fresh and refreshing and perfect to cool off in between tanning.
220,Pretty ,"The fast and easiest way to get to Kaputas is from Kas on an intercity bus from the town‚Äôs bus station. The trip may take you up to 40 minutes. With the bus you don‚Äôt need to worry about parking. It was same as easy to get a bus on return. The view from the road down to the beach was breathtaking! I got a sun bed and an umbrella for 7.5 Turkish Liras each and could stay on the beach as long as I wished. There‚Äôs a shower and bathrooms up the stairway, all free. I didn‚Äôt bring any water and food with me, so I bought water from the lifeguards and a cocktail from the cafe that is there. The water was warm, and being in water and swimming was much fun! Later in the day, the beach became quite crowded, but there was room for everyone. I know I will to Kaputas again when I come to Kas again. It‚Äôs really one of the best beaches around."
221,Unspoilt and Beautiful ,"Sea is beauty , colour is amazing , view is awesome , beach is wonderful , service is good and deliciousIf you like wavy sea you are in the right place"
222,Heaven,Best beach in the area. Enjoyed every moment.Toast is highly recommended with tea.Very clean and well maintained.
223,Must see ,"You should must ! visit this beach if you are in Ka≈ü Area. But Go 10:00-11:00 a.m for finding o good place. Entrance Fee is 11 Tl each perso, has shower, cafe and cabins. I can't describe the sea how much amazing you should go and see !"
224,magneficant,thanks so much was very good place when ƒ± was visit  ƒ±u would love to go back again the beach was beatiful nd amazen
225,Fascinating view,"Busy beach as we travelled in high season but a beauty in its business. Well equipped with bathrooms and showers change rooms, the restaurant on the beach isn't too badly priced either which is awesome! Considering it's the only shop, they could've easily taken advantage but everything is within reason!"
226,A must-see beach!,It is like a heaven between the rocky mountains. Park the first place you find if you arrive by car. The beach was administered by the municipality. Two sunbeds and an umbrealla cost 30 liras (5 euros). Bring your schnorkell to see brilliant views under the sea.
227,Wonderful Beach,"We have spent the last 12 years holidaying in the Kalkan/Kas area, and have just got home after another trip.  I don‚Äôt usually bother reviewing anything at all, but feel so strongly about the state of Kaputas beach as it now is that I must put pen to paper.   Kaputas beach WAS an idyllic but small beach - in fact the only proper beach in the area.  For years we visited the beach at varying times of the day.  We have been there at about 9.00 am and pretty much had it to ourselves - glorious it was.  Later on it would get a bit busier, but it was always a pleasure to be there.  It‚Äôs lack of development was the key.  ONow! Oh dear, oh dear! It can be difficult to see the sea.  Why it has been developed to include cafe, showers, toilets is beyond me. It has killed the very essence of what it was.  The ‚Äòamenities‚Äô and I think, marketing of the area is now attracting hoards and hoards of people.  There is no room on the main road above the beach to accommodate the sheer volume of cars now wanting to park, which is resulting in lots of dangerously parked cars (we couldn‚Äôt believe how many cars were parked actually on bends in the road, meaning that we had to swing out on bends into the oncoming lane just to proceed along the main road.  It‚Äôs not just me: The owner of a local hotel admitted that Kaputas beach is now ‚Äòdead‚Äô.  This beach used to be a jewel at the bottom of a gorge.  What a shame!  My advice? Unless you like crowded small beaches, avoid!You may think I‚Äôm"
228,Worth to see. G√∂r√ºlmeye deƒüer. ,"One of the most breath-taking natural wonders of kas. Yet, there is a major problem, since kas has become very popular, it also became so crowded and I was shocked when I saw kaputas full with people I was a bit let down to be honest because even if it was like 11 am in the morning there was too many people. I think you should go there much earlier like at 8 am to enjoy the beauty of the place because otherwise it is unbearable, at least it was for me. Another surprising thing for me was that it was too hot in there, we could only stay for 2 hours at the beach it doesn't even matter if you swim because it is really warm in there. So again, I think you should go there really early to enjoy your time in there, but an amazing place to see for sure when you are around kas."
229,Kaputa≈ü should be seen??,Lovely little sandy beach. Loads of steps done to it so not suitable for someone less abled. If you can manage it so worth it.Parking us slightly limited.Worth a visit
230,Challenging...,"It's a very busy, very popular place. If you can find a place to park your car, an umbrella and a sunbed, it can be a nice experience. We have a young children, it is not suitable for them during/after September especially as the water so rough and facilities are not suitable!"
231,The best sandy beach,"Though 190 steps from the road it is well worth the effort it is kept pristine dispite now having a resaurant ,toilets .and changing huts."
232,Walking on velvet,"Visited this small pebble beach a couple of times after strenuous activity days. Superb safe beach to cool off, the water is crystal clear and a pleasant temperature. Bit of a climb back to the road and parking a nightmare but our local driver took care of that."
233,AMAZING BUT BUSY,I sopped by Kaputas while driving from Kas to Bodrum. Be there a bit early before it gets crowded. Umbrellas and sunbeds are available for 5 usd. Cafe is available for drinks and sandwiches.
234,The Most Fascinating Sea Color,"If you can go there early in morning , you can easily find free spots to enjoy beatiful see and view. You can park your car side of the road as parking spot then use to stairs for reach to sea. You can rent sea bed and umbrella from cafe and also eat food there. Facility has shower and changing room as well. If you stay near Kas or Kalkan you must come here and enjoy."
235,Amazing and wonderful place ,All the tones of blue . ƒ∞t is a must see place. One of the rare beaches i have ever been. A breathtaking view.
236,Sandy beach!! ,"I was having a solo ride with my bicycle at the coastline. Then i saw the cars parked around and people standing watching the view. I stopped and i was like ""omg, what is that place??"" Every single person has to see here at least ones in their life. It was an amazing view and the sea was so clean. It was also wonderful to swim and take the best pictures. I am still using these photos as my profile photo in social media :)"
237,Overcrowded...,overcrowded and full of anatolian comars. beach is coveres full of plastic sunbeds. foods and prices are not good
238,Just a mess to park or to find a place,"After 187 stairs you will face with an amazing beach, sea and view. Unfortunately there are ugly umbrellas which destroy all the magical view. Btw, It is a wavy sea so you should survive :)"
239,"Sorry,really not as good as it looks",Small but wonderful beach ever. A must see if you are around. Amazing experience. Highly recommended.
240,Kaputas Beach - one of the most beautiful in the world!,"I mean don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful beach but there's nothing that sets this apart from the other incredible beaches in Turkey.  Apart from the mass of tourists flocking here."
241,Scenic,Nice when its not very crowded. Its run by local municipality. Prices though not very friendly. Sunbeds and umbrella are no free. But once you pay you can stay whole day
242,Lovely place,"with the help of the cold water running under the rocks, this beach has the turquoise colour on the water, natural and beautiful. you need to use stairs to go down and get back to the car, which is about 130 steps :)"
243,Beach,A beautiful beach. Water light blue an gradually becomes darker. Just so nice. Maybe about 50 steps going down to the beach but it is well worth it. The view from the top is amazing of the beach and surrounding areas almost looks unreal. A must visit while in Kalkan area.
244,Must visit and swim once in a lifetime,Crystal clear sea. A must see for Kas visitors. Especially in the early morning you can enjoy the calmness of the sea.
245,Beautiful beach,"Probably the best beach in the area. Sheltered, lovely swimming, sandy beach and sun beds to hire. Toilets and drinks available. Only drawback are the steep steps down to the beach and then the climb back afterwards!Recommend catching the local bus rather than a taxi."
246,Unspoiled beauty,"Must see beach. Ignore the heads up on the steps. It's perfectly fine, and not worth the noise. You must experience the extremely cold & refreshing shower after your swim."
247,Stunning Beach,This is a wonderful place. Almost unreal. The best hues of blue. The beach is not sand and the water is deep after a couple of meters but water is crystal clear. A must see!
248,beatiful,awesome beach - much better than it looks from the road-side. Definitely spend an afternoon there if you have a car and are based in Kalkan or Kas
249,Great blue water. ,"Beautiful beach with perfect colors. There are lots of waves. It suddenly deepers. There are toalets, showers and changing rooms. Free entry and free parking. If you need, you can rent sunbed and umbrella. There are few fish, it isnt good place for snoorkeling."
250,Fab afternoon ,"if you passing kaputas beach going from Kas to fethiye or the other way round one of the nicest beaches in turkey, especially from above the view down is incomparable ;-)"
251,Beautiful beach horrendous parking,Best sea color ever. They offer umbrellas now. (Wasnt there last year). A little crowded on weekends so must go early. You use about 100 steps to go down to the beach
252,Great Beach,If you are staying in kas or kalkan spend a few hours visiting here. The waves are strong so not suitable for small children but older kids and adults us fine. The Beach and waters are incredibly beautiful. A small cove and quite a few steps to get to it but the is a restaurant on the beach serving  refreshments and food.
253,Kaputas with is Turquoise Sea Water,So freaking beautiful place. Lots of rocks in the shallow water. Put some swimming shoes on. Nice little restaurant with snacks and cold beverages.
254,Very Pretty,Did this on a day tripStunning beach at the foot of a tall cliff Changing booths sun loungers and a shower there but a lot of steps to reachWorth it though
255,nature,It's reorganized by the local management with umbrellas and sunbeds. You can eat and have a drink in the cafe. It's still beautiful despite its crowd beach.
256,Beautiful,"A clean and relaxing beach, and a must visit during the day and at night. The amenities are very clean as well."
257,An amazing day out,Wow! That's all I can bring out. This is an amazing place and definitely a treasure of the nature! Must see!
258,The best beach ever,One of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen... Recommended! üëçüíú–û–¥–∏–Ω –∏–∑ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤–µ–π—à–∏—Ö –ø–ª—è–∂–µ–π –º–∏—Ä–∞...
259,Nice beach to spend the day,"Crystal clear sea, soft white sands, a beach with sufficient facilities such as beach-front cafe, sun-beds & umbrellas, changing rooms, showers and toilets."
260,Be careful with the waves,"Best Beach I've ever been to. But parking is a nightmare, get there early (before 10am) or take a taxi. Showers,  toilets and food all available."
261,Perfect ,"‚Ä¢ Dolmush from Kas is 6TL each way (30 min) or you can bargain a taxi trip for 50TL and it can take up to 5 people. ‚Ä¢ Food is ok and limited with mostly beer options and home-made ayran. Prices are steep because it is a tourist attraction (5TL for small bottle of water).‚Ä¢ Beds are usually available or you may need to wait a bit during peak hours. Bed rental is about 10-15TL from what I recall for the whole day. ‚Ä¢ Showers, change rooms and washrooms available free of charge but don't expect them to be clean or have toilet paper. ‚Ä¢ Waters are rough here so expect lots of waves throughout all hours of the day. It is not transparent but a beautiful bright blue. Warm during summer months of course. ‚Ä¢ No sand but a tiny pebble beach so no need for water shoes. ‚Ä¢ During second part of the day the right side of the beach gets shadow from the mountain so if you want more shade, look for a bed on the right."
262,Amazing beach,"An amazing beach between Ka≈ü and the town of Kalkan. One of the wonders of Mediterranean sea. Famous with its colour and clearity, this beach is a 'must see'"
263,Excellent beach,Lovely cove. But crowded and hard to find parking. Lots of cigarette butts in the sand. Strikingly beautiful.
264,Kaputas - great beach,"A little piece of Paradise on the Turkish coastline, don‚Äôt go anywhere else! Cost was less than a ¬£1 on bus from Kas! Regular service - times at bus station!"
265,Kaputas Beach,Definitely worth a visit but be careful with the parking since you have to park right on the highway
266,Incredible beautiful,"Am obviouslyin the very minority here.....visited this morning,had booked taxi for 9 to return at 1.However we returned before even two hours.Can see what a decent job has been made of the facilities,coffee was fine as was toasted sandwich.The steps not as bad as had anticipated.The downside?Well there is a deep shoulder into the sea,which if you have dodgy knees is not good.Also the sand is not really sand,it's a mixture of all sorts.The swimming was okay,had better ,much better at Kalamar bay.No pads on the beds,did not even sit on the ones we had paid for.Overcrowded by far.So,it's been ticked off the list,but would only suggest maybe off season.Kalamar Bay is definitely far superior......as is Barricane Beach in Woolacombe if you are ever that way!"
267,"Stunning setting, turquoise sea","It was better two years ago when municipality didn't interfere with the sunbeds, cafe and all but still an amazing cove with every shade of blue."
268,Most Photogenic beach in Turkey,Great beach. Would definately recommend to anyone. Very clean and tidy. Never seen a cleaner beach...
269,A real masterpice hidden in the south cost!,"It is always my pleasure to visit this unique location, and recommended to everyone to visit Service provided by Local Government Office which provides good service"
270,A one of a kind beach,"If you want to relax, swim, enjoying the sun, find something to eat and drink then you are here on the right place. The mountains around the bay are very high. You have to be good in going on stairs. Lots of steps down and at the end of the visit of course up again."
271,Too many people on too small a beach,"Great nature and scenery but completely disorganized. No commercial interest by vendors while demand is high for ice cream, water, beer. Beautiful place though. Waters were a bit stormy with strong waves."
272,Not so expensive as I thought. ,It was one of the best beaches I've ever seen.... I haven't seen a better beach. Would recommend....
273,beautiful beach,Awesome piece of nature. The color of the sea is gorgeous. It is exactly what you expect seeing the pictures.
274,Sooo wavy!!!,"Be prepared for the long, uneven steps down to this amazing beach. The recent addition of basic toilet facilities, showers and cafe mean you can stay all day. The beach is a mix of pebbles and sand and although it can get pretty busy during the summer there's room for everyone. The sea is the most breathtaking colour and fantastic for confident swimmers. When the surf gets up playing in the waves is excellent fun.....but not suitable for small children or those of a nervous disposition. Brace yourself for the walk back up the steps in the burning heat of the day..... save some ice cold water to drink when you get to the top and enjoy the view as you cool off."
275,Super clear water,"If you are lucky enough to catch a day of this beach without waves, you will be experiencing something amazing. Turquoise water and a natural beauty..."
276,Beautiful escape from Kas and Kalkan,"If you don‚Äôt have a car, you can take a minibus from kas bus terminal. It departs in every half an hour. The beach is just amazing and very picturesque (especially from above - you don‚Äôt any drone or something). Must visit in your Kas visit."
277,Relaxing beach trip,"There is parking problem. You need to leave your car on the road which is dangerous to walk or leave car there. However sea was so much nice and warm that it was worthy to take risk. Beach is from small stones and water color was very light blue. There is restaurant, cafe, dressing room, shower and wc are placed. It is possible to rent beach seat and umbrella and entrance was free. Sea was deep and very nice spotting point to make photos."
278,A Must Visit,Must see! It is like heaven on earth. Just google it and you'll understand why. One of the world's sexiest beaches.
279,Turquaz sea&waves,one of the most beautiful bays in Turkey: between Kalkan and Kas you will find Kaputas. You can reach by boat or by car. By car be aware of all the steps you need to descend. But perfect view from upstairs!
280,Super beach,"after going down for hundreds of stairs, you will look back and find an empty space, and going into cold waters of ka≈ü, you will go back and see an exceptional view. You can also find cheap food there and public transportation is in every half an hour to ka≈ü center"
281,Stunning,You should go early in the morning and swim at sunrise and take a photo. After 9 o'clock there is a parking problem too much and it gets crowded. The Ka≈ü Municipality operates the cafe and the prices are affordable. The scenery is perfect.
282,Great beach,I have been there a couple days ago. I have grew up by Egean Sea Saroz area I have never see a color of water like that. It was truely a gift from nature. I have enjoyed it every single minute. I suggest you to bring your mask and snorkel as I always recommend if you swim anywhere on Ka≈ü.
283,myrtos beach in turkey,"I dont want to say to manythings about Kaputas.. ƒ± like to tell you, please go early you can. If you like you can pay 4-5 euro for place for 2 person or you can bring your self ‚Äúchair umbrella etc‚Äù. Food is very cheap and fast we advise you to have pancake ‚ÄúG√∂zleme‚Äù with anything you like. They serve beer, cold drinks and more but menu isnt big, please dont expect to much. Go, make fun, eat some snacs and swimm :)"
284,Wonderful surroundings!,"Very lovely special beach with Blue sky,blue water.This beach like private beach.l have been there many times,l loved it.Grains of fine and hot sand"
285,great beach,In the morning the weather was rainy. And clouds were still on the sky. But we did not change our program to go Kaputas. It was nice idea to go. It was again turquoise as always. Amazing. We had Turkish Meatball in the cafe. Was really delicious. I highly recommend to eat Turkish meatball with ayran.
286,Incredible Turquoise Waters,One of the best view from the road.  Take as much as photo as you can. You need to pass the hundreds stairs to go down the sea. The sea is quite risky if you are not good swimmer.It is getting deaper suddenly and the waves can take the control from you.
287,Unforgettable place,"Wonderfull spot, ƒ±mpressƒ±ve vƒ±ew helps to relƒ±ef from everyday stress and worrƒ±es. It ƒ±s strongly recommended and should not be mƒ±ssed."
288,Ms,"Looking down from the road, the turquoise sea beckons the 5 cooped up, sticky travellers crammed into a hire car into its refreshing, clear waters. Down 183 steps (counted by my 9 year old) the sandy beach awaits. A few sun lounger tickets purchased from the man in the cafe, bags plonked down and suddenly the wait is over and all is well with the world as we float in the warm, clean sea looking up at the mountains above. It's a beautiful beach and well worth the journey from Kas."
289,Beautiful beach ,"turquise sea and small bay, a little olu deniz near Kalkan and Kas. worth the visit. steep climb down and toilet not close to the cafe, so maybe not so good for the elderly, but appart from that just fabulous"
290,Perfect little beach,"This beach is still stunning but ..... we are old school .... been sunning ourselves on Kaputas beach since 1994 (Kalkan is the closest town not Kas), however in recent years the local council have placed sun beds and a restaurant on the beach, it is no loner the idyllic isolated beach it once was !However it is still beautiful, has the clearest warmest water in the area, great for snorkelling and swimmingThe restaurant does not serve beer, so take your own !!"
291,Can get crowded during high season,"Worth a visit, as mentioned as place to be.Difficult for shade as umbrella rooted in ground, so didn't stay all day but beautiful natural surroundings."
292,Sandy little beach,There are places in this world that has no equivalencies. This is a place in this category. You may think k from the pics that they can be photoshopped but it is really like it seems in the pics. Dreamy indeed
293,Unexpected jewel of a beach,"New steps have now been erected - so much safer and easier now (but still had to take a 'view-stop' half was (to catch my breath).New cafe facilities now operational are provided by the local council - so good quality, and well priced - could have been a rip-off, but provided by the Council was excellent.Yes there are loos down behind the new cafe."
294,Beautiful and dramatic beach ,"Nice warm, blue water, but the peddles hurt your feet. Protected from the wind, it didn't have many waves. Easy to park."
295,Gorgeous clean sandy beach with sparkling turquoise water.,This beach has disstressed story. Couple workers were died during bridge construction in 60s because of accident. Nowadays they built new bridge to unite two valleys. This bay has magnificent color and very good sand beach. There is always waves. Be careful while swimming. Local majority has a buffet to get some beverages and fast food sandwiches. You can find there changing cabinet and shower too. You should visit this beach absolutely. Parking is a big problem. You need to stop by motorways.Mind the white draw to avoid being on motorway
296,Picture perfect and a lovely swim,"quite dificult to find, but worth it , bring yourself food and beberages.  try to go early in the morning to get chairs.a paradise in the midle of no-where"
297,Marvellous,Don't be put off by the steps if you can make it ... Yes the sea can seem fierce at the edge but within a few feet it's calm and an easy swim. Was last here a few years ago when there wasn't much! A lot better now!
298,Kaputas beach ,Wonder of the nature. A gem for the world. Unbelievably spectacular. Hidden treasure. Everyone has to see this beauty once in their lifetime.
299,best beach near kas,Bana g√∂re Akdeniz'in en ≈üahane plajlarindan biri. Muhakkak o g√ºzel kumlarda g√ºne≈ülenmenin ve o turkuaz denizinde yuzmenin keyfine varƒ±n. In my opinion this is one of  the most beautiful beach in Mediterranean Sea. Enjoy the sun tanning and swim at this excellent turquoise sea
