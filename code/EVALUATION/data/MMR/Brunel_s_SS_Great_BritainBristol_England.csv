0,Excellent visit,Really enjoyed everything about our visit. I have been before and have seen the site develop. We liked that you got a real feel of what it would have been like on the voyage to Australia which was around 64 days. We would probably be in steerage and the bunks were tiny!  All the artefacts were well displayed both on the ship and surrounding museum areas. We spent two and half hours but could easily have taken longer. The tour was well managed with Covid measures in place. Your ticket is named and can be used again within a year so good value.
1,Fab day out,"Would highly recommend, can‚Äôt wait to go back. Staff were very friendly and every aspect of our experience was awesome."
2,History at its best,"We have visited the Gt Britain many times and have always loved it, we live very close.  We were obviously cautious taking our Grandson back after Coronavirus. We needn‚Äôt have worried the precautions taken by the whole team were excellent. There was timed entry and we wore masks inside. All the staff wore visors. and there was ample hand sanitiser to use all the way around the ship.  We felt safe and we all loved our visit.  Thank- you Brunel‚Äôs SS Great Britain for the effort taken.  Easy for people with disabilities too."
3,Amazing inside and out ,Visited here on their first week of reopening and we were very impressed with their Covid precautions and felt very safe. Staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable and very happy to share information. The boat itself is fantastic especially inside. So much effort has been made to bring the ship alive. The smells are very pungent and and the sounds are great. Children would love it. We have been to many historical attractions but this really was one of the best. Really enjoyable and a must see when in Bristol.
4,Far more interesting than expected,Really enjoyed our visit to SS Great Britain. The staff on arrival were very friendly and helpful. The exhibitions were interesting and informative. Good social distancing measures in place. Would definetely recommend a visit.
5,Exceeded expectations,"We really enjoyed visiting the SS GB. The staff and volunteers were super friendly and knowledgeable. There‚Äôs loads to look at, more than you think and the interior of the shop is so well recreated. Wish we had spent longer there but plan to go back within the year to use our free pass."
6,Superb attraction.,"We really enjoyed our visit, it was really informative and all the staff were very nice, the shop also had some quite unusual items it it, better than a lot of others I have visited."
7,An unexpected pleaseure,We visited this weekend and spent a good couple of hours walking around. Really fascinating and very well presented. Would highly recommend.
8,Old steamship converted into a museum.,A must do activity if you are in Bristol! We really enjoyed the day and there is so much interesting information and history. Would definitely recommend this activity!
9,Well worth a visit,"Have been wanting to visit the SS Gt Britain for years and certainly not a disappointment!! We found all the staff very helpful. Joe on the deck was very knowledgeable. The whole experience was fabulous really. The Being Brunel part of the exhibition was great!! It was quite quiet when we were there, I expect due to the Corona Virus, but was great for us. I must say I found the interior of the ship in steerage very spooky with all the figures and the ghastly butcheryü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And the baby crying etc but it all added to the ambience! I did feel sorry for the animals on there, destined for death. However the whole experience overall was well worth it!!"
10,Ship of historical importance. ,We thought we would come here during our visit to Bristol - we had a great time and it was great to see such a remarkable piece of history. They had lots of measures in place to ensure social distancing and hand sanitizer everywhere.
11,Recommended visit,"Our tour guide was very good. The whole day out experience was excellent, and value for money. This center is well worth a visit. There is so much to see , not just the ship, there are buildings which are museum's. You will need a whole day here. We arrived via park and ride which was very good as well."
12,Visits with grandparents,We visited the SS Great Britain and had a great time.We expected the visit to last about 2 hours but we stayed for over 4 hours.The information boards were very informative and interesting. Around the ship there were staff dress up in period clothing and gave realistic view of how people would be like.The ship is well preserved and the with the ship shown as floating on a shelf of water in the dry dock but then you can go under the the water and see the ships rudder and propeller.The various exhibitions are excellent and provide a lot of information on all things todo with the SS Great Britain.
13,"Great visit, getting there awful",Been wanting to visit for a while and we were certainly not disappointed. So pleased that you could get to every bit of the vessel both above and below the waterline. Staff very knowledgeable and friendly. Well worth the entrance fee and effort.
14,A great day‚Äôs experience,Fantastic place. Really enjoyed the visit from start to finish.  Staff were excellent . Great to see so much access built into the ship and museum meaning that everyone can get to every area of the site. Interpretation and conservation particularly well done. Clearly a huge amount of work and funding has gone into the place. Hats off to all those involved.
15,Top Attraction,This museum is really fantastic and is a great place to visit. We truly enjoyed the volunteers and their extensive knowledge and charm.
16,A great experience,Really interesting museum that was well worth taking the time to book a ticket. The staff were very helpful in advising which way to visit the exhibitions as it was a very hot day and part of the tour was under the vessell in a low humidity area under glass (getting very warm).The highlight was walking the decks looking at the reconstructed sleeping areas.A really enjoyable couple of hours.
17,ss Great. Britain day ticket visit,"Had a fantastic time visiting and will be returning soon to read the bits we missed. Staff were excellent - very engaging, knowledgeable, and friendly.There was clear signage throughout, as well as a one way system to support distancing, and loads of places to use sanitizer. The team have clearly spent a lot of time and effort to reopen, and it shows. Wonderful place. Amazing history. Thank you for helping us have such a super time."
18,Detailed Information - Great Restoration!,"An excellent ship/land based museum. Information very well presented. The guide I met on board was superb. The Cutty Sark in greenwich is well worth a visit, but I think this is even better."
19,Worth a look,"Had a good 3 hours looking around the museums and boat. The site had recently re-opened and all the staff were thrilled to be back at work, some were even on their first day back. We were greeted by a welcoming gentleman dressed as Brunel (he also took the time to speak to as we left, asking about our visit) who made sure our tickets and booking slot were all in order. The rest of the team clearly love their work as their enthusiasm was infectious. My fianc√© has been visiting the ship on and off for the last 50 years and even he found new exhibits and information to interest him.Hand sanitiser was available throughout the exhibit and the newly instigated one way system was probably a bonus. As we couldn‚Äôt go down into the dry dock because of social distancing we will definitely be back when it has reopened.All in all a morning well spent and memories made."
20,Great day out for all the family,We really enjoyed our visit on a somewhat cloudy day.  The staff were without exception very friendly.  The whole visit was interesting and informative.  There is plenty of hand sanitiser everywhere you go making it feel a safe place to be.  You need a face covering for all of the indoor things.
21,went as said open but was closed,"I Have been to Bristol many times but never visited the Ss Great Britain. I found out that they were having a victorian Christmas weekend and decided it would be a great adventure. The ship itself is fantastic and you are able to go on and enjoy its many features. The Victorian actors were amazing! So much so, that you would have thought they had been taken from the 1850s and placed there. They were well dressed in period clothing and acted as if they lived in times past. There were many separate things going on all round the site. We enjoyed the carols and making Christmas cards with ink stamps aswell. The children loved making orange and clove decorations with a victorian actor. All in all a great day out. Well worth a visit if you get chance!"
22,Genuinely one of the best tourist attractions/museums ever visited.,"Visiting relatives in Bristol on our 8 weeks in UK, we were delighted they planned an afternoon around the docks and aboard the SS Great Britain, an interesting insight into the early days of maritime history.  Being able to thoroughly explore the external and internal spaces gave us a much greater understanding of life on board for both crew and passengers on this steamship travelling between Bristol and UK in the mid 1800s.  A well designed exhibition with museum store and cafe attached."
23,Impressive! ,We had a great experience. Very interesting with many information boards. Unfortunately dry dock was closed due to COVID-19. They had really good social distancing measures in place with all staff where face shields. Hand sanitizer stations everywhere and good one way systems. All this making you feel safe with COVID not being an issue.
24,Day trip,"We just came to visit the SS Great Britain, which was fascinating and gave us a real insight into what life on board ship was like. We had not expected the Victorian re-enactors who were brilliant. Thank you"
25,Great attraction for all ages,"Really interesting, spent two hours here, everything well explained, we enjoyed the talk in the dining room giving the ship's history.  Loved looking around at the recreated kitchens, cabins and even the doctor's surgery.Well worth a visit."
26,Brilliant!,We visited the attraction on the Victorian Christmas weekend which made things even more interesting. The characters/actors were very friendly with lots of informative stories and also the ships actual staff were fantastic and well versed in its history.It‚Äôs well worth a visit to one of Bristol unique Historical gems.
27,Very interesting,Excellent trip yesterday as a family of four. A thoroughly educational trip which was very well organised and safe given the current COVID-19 risks. Safety precautions well thought out and worked well. We have seen the ship on a number of occasions when visiting Bristol but not visited. Definitely an excellent experience and well worth the ticket price. Spent three hours at the site and could have stayed for another hour as didn‚Äôt manage to visit the final Brunel museum. Tickets allow another visit at some point so may return. A fantastic experience!
28,In-depth tour of history,Me and. My husband visited Bristol yesterday and headed straight for Ss Great Britain . We were so impressed by the magnificent Ship and everything is so interesting with special effects too. We particularly liked the rat in the kitchen. The tour guides and staff were so helpful and friendly . It was quiet when we visited and you need to book online. Plenty of hand sanitiser throughout the ship because of Covid
29,One of the UK's top tourist attractions,"The staff were so welcoming and friendly, all the information they gave was fascinating and the story of the shop is incredible. Everyone was so approachable and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit which was decided at the last minute and what a great decision that was, we are likely to return in the future! the one way route meant that nothing was missed and the attention to detail was remarkable. This is a must do for anyone visiting Bristol an amazing piece of Great British history and engineering."
30,Excellent Visit,"Visited the SS Great Britain and what a brilliant day out. We had a guided tour with Eddie and he was so helpful and informative, you could tell how much he enjoyed his job. The ship itself was really good, lots to see onboard and the experience was realistic with smells and sounds of the areas you enter. The museum was also very good, lots of new information to be learnt when visiting. I would definitely recommend going. If possible, do a guided tour as this is a great way to get even more information.Thanks for a great trip and thanks to Eddie as well for your brilliant tour!"
31,Absolutely awesome !!!!!!!!!!!,I was there when they brought back the  SS Gt Britian to Bristol and have seen this grow from a local atraction to the world class visitor expericnce it is today. It has so much to offer both the visitor and also acedemics for study of Victorian Enginerring and of course IKB Isambard Kingdon Brunel. your visit can be both short or long as there is so much to see and enjoy. tickets are valid for a year and can be used as agift aid to the centre. great cafe and shop. The ship has themed events and offer great wedding and dining experiences
32,Must-Visit,Really good and we had an opportunity to visit the library to view some original Brunel letters during our visit. There‚Äôs plenty throughout the whole exhibit to keep you interested for several hours - we spent four hours and could have been there a while longer.
33,A must see attraction ,When I saw the price I thought the SS expensive having visited I now think it is Very good Value; With two museums as well as the ship there is a great deal to see and do which means it is useful that tickets last a year and are brilliant value. Even with the map provided I found the layout confusing. I was surprised that some areas were not one way only such as narrow passageways on the ship. On the whole an excellent day out and even better if you can return (nessacary if you want to see everything)
34,Unrivalled view into a past world.,Really interesting and I learned a call lot.Was a good experience even though I've been here a long time but never visited
35,Much too expensive,"I loved my visit to SS Great Britain today.From the wonderful acting from IKB actor greeting at the entrance and all the warm and knowledgeable staff to the superb museum, interactive and interesting, also the main attraction which was awesome. I would definitely recommend a visit especially as it was very well organised and safe during the Covid pandemic. Ryan was the outstanding staff member of the day, his enthusiasm and knowledge was super inspiring! What an asset to the team."
36,Fantastic Visit,We were well impressed by the dry Dock and the insides of the ship! I can really imagine having lived inside the ship now.100% worth the money
37,Excellent ,"We have for some time been intending to visit Bristol and its historic artifacts. We were not disappointed with this visit. My wife said 'I am only doing this for you' because she knew I was interested in engineering and the Inventors. She, as I was overwhelmed by the professional way this exhibition has been set up and the enthusiastic support staff who brought the whole thing to life and explained the history to us. Fantastic visit and I cannot stress too highly the whole experience is well worth the time and cost to visit. Must do if in the area."
38,"A very well planned museum, with enormous attention to detail","We spent over 2 hours exploring this fascinating ship and after visiting a few similar attractions across the country, these guys definitely win in the experience for visitors. The ship itself is impressive but the exhibitions below deck are amazing! The attention to detail is incredible and you really get a sense of how life would have been for the passengers. The Being Brunel museum on site was also fascinating. Really modern and interesting, we enjoyed every minute. A great attraction for kids and adults I would definitely recommend this place and we will definitely be making the most of free annual return (included in the ¬£18 adult ticket price)."
39,Excellent as always,"I booked for a group of 20 people. We had two outstanding and knowledgeable guidesEveryone had a great time & want to visit again. Staff were very helpful & visitor centre is itself a great experienceVery accessible, great use of interactive technology.Wonderful morning"
40,Long-held ambition realised,"Had a wonderful time visiting the SS Great Britain, there were lots of people dressed in Victorians. The ship is really good and well worth a look."
41,Incredibly well curated,We had a very enjoyable visit here.  The museum has managed the COVID-19 restrictions very well indeed.  The staff were knowledgeable and friendly.  There was a one way system in operation with plenty of hand sanitiser available around the ship and other exhibits.  Highly recommended.  We will definitely be returning.
42,Got to be done. ,We were advised that when in Bristol the SS Great Britain was a must see and that advice was spot on.We visited all parts of the ship and the museum over a couple of hours and were impressed with the amount of history and accessibility  to all areas would definitely recommend it.
43,An amazing Transformation,If you vist make sure you allow time to visit all the attractions. Not only is history brought to life but the difficulties of prervation are also highlighted. The genius of Brunel is also highlighted. To top it all....there's a Banksy close by as well!
44,Our visit here,Had been wanting to visit the SS Great Britain for many years but had never been in the area. So I made a decision to visit the area during the February half term. I am really pleased that I did although the weather on the day I visited wasn;t really conducive to a great visit - a warm summer day would have been better. However the ship is impressive. I enjoyed exploring below decks and chatting with the very friendly and informative staff. The Brunel Museum was also a great place to visit; very interesting and informative.
45,Super friendly staff and a wonderful safe visit!,It still impresses me how amazing the museum experiences are in the UK. Having visited museums in many other countries it's hard to find enhanced experiences such as you can find at The SS Great Brittain. Great for pics and to learn history! Recommended for adults and kids as well
46,Ryan is a Star!,"Been here few times already, they improve all the time! If you want to study the history in a fun way, this place is a good choice."
47,A fantastic day out,Just excellent.  Very intresting a lot to learn.  Really enjoyed it and was better as a good days weather at the time. Sadlly let down by the cafe prices which are totally ridiculous hence why 4 stars instead of 5.
48,Fantastic look back into history ,"We had been a few years ago and really enjoyed it. We booked as a family for the Victorian Christmas experience and it was Fab! There were victorian actors in costume, carol singers, snow machine, a harpist and a band. Lots to see, do and learn. Very christmasy and the kids loved it to. We then went into the cafe for a mince pie and hot chocolate which was reasonably priced too. Highly recommended"
49,A super day out,"We visited the attraction last weekend with our friends. One of the party was on crutches and I want to praise the staff of the SS Great Britain for going above and beyond. When we were on the ship they could not do enough for us to ensure that we all were able to visit all parts of the ship. They made sure that when we needed to go down in the lift, that the one way traffic was halted temporarily so that they could descend safely. We also ended up have a little bit of a guided tour which we never asked for.The restrictions that they have had to put in place because of the virus works.Hats off to everyone at the SS Great Britain, especially Alan (our own personal tour guide).Keep up the good work"
50,Fascinating and Covid compliant,Very enjoyable day out. Educational and great to see inside the old boat! Would recommend to all. The weather was poor when we went but most of the attraction is indoor.
51,Awesome and iconic,"This was our first visit to Bristol and the SS Great Britain is an absolute must see attraction. The staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and made our experience exceptional. In particular, Ryan who played the part of Isambard Kingdom Brunel perfectly and knew his history and the whole team (including the lady from Shrewsbury), made our visit an exceptional experience. We were lucky that the museum opened last week and we were impressed with the safety measures in place. We felt totally safe and comfortable and would highly recommend this visit to anyone visiting Bristol."
52,Fantastic,Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Lots of Covid measures in place to keep staff and visitors safe. Staff very knowledgable and friendly and clearly love what they do. Something to interest all age groups.
53,Fantastic place to visit,"Whilst visiting Bristol we wanted to see the ship so we booked our tickets on line in advance and for a set time. When we arrived we were advised as to the Covid arrangements and the recommended route around the shipyard and the ship.The workshops and displays are well done and the preservation of the ship which is ongoing is impressive.An interesting afternoon looking at the ship which changed shipping design, Brunels life and achievements, in the original ship yard where the ship was first built Your ticket allows you to revisit many times within the year if in the area"
54,Extremely enjoyable experience and would highly recommend,"After deciding to visit Brunel's SS Great Britain we were so pleased we did.  There is much to see on the ship and around it.  We didn't really give it enough hours to do everything.  I like the fact that you could look and touch things, unlike several other places I have visited where you're kept behind a rope.  Once tickets are purchased you can have access to visit for the next 12 months."
55,Great family day out,"Really good morning. Out , lots of work has gone into bring this ship back to live , real great experience ,how it‚Äôs all been done , well worth a visit if in Bristol Pre booking tickets , before you go Ps they must all been very slim when you see the bunks  on board"
56,INCREDIBLE BRISTOL DAY OUT,"We had a great time at the Victorian Christmas, great atmosphere, friendly and realistic actors in Victorian costumes and activities for the children. We'll definitely be back!"
57,Nice try and 48 cigars,"This is not an attraction that I had ever really wanted to visit but as my brother in law did, 3 of us joined him.  We were pleased that we did! All the staff and volunteers are so knowledgeable and made our tour around the ship and the museum a great experience.  It is really good value, for one ticket price we can return as many times as we want in the next 12 months.  Well worth a visit, really interesting."
58,Fabulous Tour!,"This surpassed my expectations, ended up spending many hours looking around and taking in the full experience of this ship, the history of the period and IK Brunel.. The associated museum was very informative, the staff were all so helpful and the addition of a pianist playing in the salon of the ship was the icing on the cake."
59,What a day!,"Timed visit very organised, enjoyed Mr Brunel talking to the queue. Most of the staff were engaging, friendly and informative . This was our first visit and we would highly recommend it All Covid precautions in place and adequate The car park is close and reasonably priced, you can get refunds or you could do what we did and donate the refund to help with the up keep Would recommend this attraction"
60,Great experience,"I spent a very interesting few hours visiting the SS Great Britain, its a fascinating ship with an amazing history. The dockyards and Brunel museum are also well worth visiting at the same time and help you to understand a lot more about the ship as well as its creator.Finding the ship is easy as its well signposted throughout Bristol and Parking whilst not free is heavily discounted by showing your parking ticket when you arrive at the SS Great Britains ticket office. Once shown you get some of the parking fee refunded.The ship is accessed through the SS Great Britain museum which is  great idea because it means you do get to know more about the ship before getting on board which makes the visit a lot more interesting. As long as you have the time don't skip the museum as doesnt take long to go round but shouldn't be missed.Moving around the ship is easy and you can choose your own route round so if an area is busy just go to another part of the ship and come back later. The use of figures dressed up and placed in situ to give an idea of the life of the ship has been well done and does help to capture the day to day running of the ship. One thing is for sure it may have been effectively the forerunner of modern liners but the accommodation was certainly very basic even for first class passengers. Walking underneath the ship was also a wonderful way to see so much more about the way it was designed and also the experience of knowing that you were walking around it in the very same dry dock that it was launched from is quite thought provoking.One thing that did slightly spoil the visit was the lack of supervision of a school visit. Thankfully apart from a bit of running around and stupid screaming at some of the figures they were actually not too badly behaved but they did block up areas and were distracting. The biggest issue I had with them was actually sorrow for them that by just leaving them to run around the ship on their own they will have learnt nothing. Because I had studied the ship I was able to answer a few of the questions that some were asking but that should have been the responsibility of the teachers not a fellow visitor. The teachers were on board but just sitting around chatting with obviously no interest in their pupils at all. The SS Great Britain should have rules in place that (like they did when I was at school) you split a class up into smaller groups each group with a teacher who stays with them all the time. And if its not asking too much perhaps actually teach them something about what they are seeing.In conclusion this was a very worthwhile visit and something I would recommend anyone visiting Bristol includes in their itinerary"
61,SS Great Britain,"Visited the SS Great Britain and thoroughly enjoyed the visit. My wife was not happy at the thought of another historical tour. But well worth the visit and so good even she wants to come back. Excellent tour, very well laid out and unlike some places here you are encouraged to open doors and look in cupboards, if it opens you can go in or look! You could go round the dry dock and see how the dry dock works. There was a large area devoted to the life of IK Brunel complete with the time lines of his achievements. All in all a great experience, we will be going again next year when it is the 50th anniversary of the return of the ship to Bristol. One other great thing is that the ticket gets you free admission for a whole year!"
62,Absolutely brilliant time. Well worth a visit.,Went to see the SS Great Britain for my four time in 40 years. Every time the improvements on the facility and then ship are amazing. The addition of the covered glass to represent the water line is well executed and provides a nice dry area to walk in. The cafe on the river is a nice setting also as well as the Brunel museumGood way to spend a few hours even on a rainy day
63,A fascinating and comprehensive experience,"Oh my goodness so enjoyed this visit. Interesting historical and fun,  bought the entry ticket to both the boat and the museum.   There are 3 decks to peruse from the engine rooms the kitchens and the sleeping quarters. Absolutely fascinating to hear the commentary from  various staff throughout the boat and hear about the life story of SS Britain. Loved it. You could even peruse under the boat and again staff were available to answer any questions you may have.  The ticket cost us ¬£17per adult with a ¬£2 reduction for oap. This  includes entry into the Brunel museum which again was amazing.  Just found it so interesting to learn about the life of a complete genius when you think about his achievements.  If you get the opportunity make sure you cross the suspension bridge whatever a feat of engineering,  There is a disabled lift so access appears to be simple I even saw a lady pushing a baby in a buggy which is lovely to see there are no boundaries. The only thing you need to be a little careful of is when you go under the boat it‚Äôs partly cobbled.  Car parking is available a minute away. Please make sure you check out the cabins and the bunk beds.  My husband is on the large size I‚Äôve no idea how he would have coped,  well worth a visit."
64,Amazing and worth every penny.,We visited Brunels SS Great Britain on a very wet and windy day but we had a great time The museum was really interesting and the ship itself was fascinating there were even smells that took you back to when the ship sailed When we were there the library was open too and that was equally interesting Children would enjoy it as much as the parents however wheelchair users would find it very difficult as only the dry dock was wheelchair friendly but even that would be difficult as only one side would really be accessible There are toilets and 2 cafes the tickets last 12 months
65,Great activity for all.,So well done this is a fantastic heritage experience.   Wonderful to see how passengers travelled in previous times.
66,Fantastic day out.,What a fantastic experience for the whole family. The whole area is made safe by one way systems and sanitising stations everywhere. The staff were outstanding and couldn‚Äôt do enough to help. Would recommend to everyone.
67,Ride the waves created by the enthusiasm of the staff,"Had a great day out here today; would recommend to anybody visiting Bristol.  The Covid-19 safety precautions have been well thought out - timed entry slots, a one way system, staff controlling access to the bathrooms,   plenty of hand sanitiser and masks worn indoors - and we felt very safe throughout our visit.  The timed entry slots meant there was plenty of space for everyone; lots of other attractions could learn from this approach!   All of the staff we encountered during our visit were really friendly and informative; making a real effort to talk to our 4y/o daughter.  We all enjoyed the dry dock and museums, which have plenty of interactive exhibits to keep all the family interested and engaged.  The highlight for us was looking around the interior of the ship, the attention to detail is incredible - it really feels like you have stepped back in time. Having bought tickets today, we are able to return for unlimited visits for the next year - we will definitely be back."
68,Great Day out ,"Two teenagers and grandparents really enjoyed our day out. Park for the maximum 5 hours, we overran a bit after a walk to MShed and back."
69,Great Britain tour,This historic ship was close to where we were staying. We were initially reluctant to visit as the cost seemed high but once we had taken the plunge (virtually when we went below the Plimsoll Line) we realised there was a lot to see and it was great value.As well as seeing on board the ship and the conditions for the various classes there was a very interesting museum about the career of Brunel to look around. We by no means saw it all so we very much hope we can use the year's validity of the ticket to return.
70,Interesting and well worth the visit,We all found it really interesting looking around the museum and the ship. We particularly liked going below deck and seeing what it would have been like to travel on the SS Great Britain
71,Impressive ship even for youngsters,Amazing staff at this attraction - couldn‚Äôt do more to help my family during our visit especially when navigating with a pram ! Thank you Sarah and your colleague on the top deck for all your help! Also plenty adjustments to make the visit safe but enjoyable during covid 19!!!
72,SS GREAT ATTRACTION,I highly recommend visiting the SS Great Britain in Bristol. It is an amazing experience for curios kids and teenagers. The tour is well organised  starting with the victorian dock recreation before boarding the ship. This is a heaven for a history fan like me.  We were lucky as there were not many people around. Make sure to book tickets online before hand.The ship tour and staff are well adapted to COVID19 measures and guidances. Make sure to bring your masks.
73,Interesting and enjoyable ,"Great visit, very well organised with buying timed tickets online.  Hand sanitiser stations everywhere!  Really interesting tour, not at all crowded so distancing was no problem.  Very friendly and helpful staff and volunteers throughout.  Kids enjoyed it which is always the main thing!"
74,Enjoyable couple of hours,We had a fascinating and enjoyable tour around the ship and the museum. Staff and volunteers were always on hand to offer further information but were never intrusive.
75,Excellent visit - better than last time!,"We came here because we thought we should, but ended up spending more than 2 hours in the museum and on the ship. We discovered so much about Brunel and what life was like on, and for, the ship. A rightly popular attraction in Bristol"
76,Amazing place to visit!,"not sure what we were expecting, but it exceeded all expectations we had.  Very informative and well laid out.   Being able to walk around the outside of the boat under the waterline was a surpise.  Lots of information before you actually board the boat, so definitely plan at least a couple of hours.  The renovation has been done really well, top class."
77,Interesting Visit,Went here and have nothing negative to say about this attraction. If you are in Bristol and have only time to see one thing then I could not recommend anything more strongly. It‚Äôs all so well laid out and with knowledgable helpful staff at every turn.
78,Brilliant!! ,"Had a visit to the S S Great Britain, fascinating experience, taken around by Russ this guy really knows what he's talking about,"
79,Careful of the number limits with social distancing,"My husband and I visited and were so impressed. Everything was done so well from the museums, actors, sets and how the boat is set up. There was a lot of interactive parts for children. Well done it was amazing and I would definitely recommend everyone to visit."
80,Fascinating museum ,Visited here as part of city break With my husband my 40th mini break The ship is sheer Amazing so interesting  the crew are so knowledgeable and talk with passion. We loved the whole experience so much that we are planning to come back with the children in the summer mths. If your thinking of taking a day trip or weekend to Bristol you must not pass on this wonderful day. So worth the money which we found to be so reasonable.There‚Äôs An area for packed lunches if your keeping the cost down. Don‚Äôt miss out on a fab day
81,An incredible experience!,"I found this trip fantastic and although in the current climate it is difficult to do everything. I learnt a great deal it was very educational, the staff were absolutely brilliant, and I would like to single out Ryan, as the information I received from him was great, especially my query about the white Ensign. I have already put on social media what a great experience I had and will definitely be back Thank you to all the crew"
82,Excellent day in Bristol,"Fantastic few hours out. Was unsure at first as I thought the entrance fee was quite steep (however you do get a years pass). But the ship is amazing. I have never experienced anything like it. Even my 6 year old loved it, and it didn‚Äôt even involve computer games! Will definitely come again"
83,Great for all the family,"Fab place, me and my boys thoroughly enjoyed our time here today ages 9 and 12. We all learnt loads!! Lots to look at and read, very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Covid 19 - very good to find an easy to follow one way system in place, with loads of hand sanitiser stations available, felt very welcome and safe."
84,Great visit to a great ship,"There is a lot to see so all is plenty of time for your visit.  It was more interested then expected as there are lots of different parts to see: the drydock, museum and boat itself.   There is a lot to read and interactive aspects for kids although not all working during Covid period which was understandable.  Staff were friendly and knowledgeable.   I particularly enjoyed the social history aspects."
85,A step back in time !!,"This is a very good exhibit, we took a boat over the river (¬£1 each) to get to it and spent a good 3 hours enjoying the whole experience. Loads to look at and read and the ship itself is in really good condition. I particularly enjoyed going down into the dry dock to see the underside which gave the ship some scale."
86,Amazing staff and covid safe,"This museum was a pleasant surprise. The exhibits, almost all withing the ship, are informative, well maintained and tastefully done. This is a must visit destination in Bristol"
87,Brunel's SS Great Britain,The last time i was on this ship it was a barely preserved hulk. What the restoration team have done is truly remarkable - having turned a sorry hulk into an outstanding visitor experience with the introductory information and scene setting in the warehouse before entry to the ship - a huge job well executed and well worth the visit
88,Brunei‚Äôs SS Great Britain,This was a very good and interesting day out. Learned a lot and spend a surprising long amount of time here! Only downside is that it is slightly on the expensive side and you will probably need to get the river ferry to get to the ship
89,Brilliant Brunel!,"Came here on a rainy morning. I must say we were very impressed (2 adults, 2 boys, 9 & 7) The boat and museum were excellently thought out, very informative and entertaining. The exhibits gave you a real sense of how the passengers would have lived. The story of how the ship was ‚Äòrescued‚Äô was very interesting as was the story of the designer, Brunel. Covid precautions were excellent with a one way system around the boat, plenty of signage and hand sanitiser. The staff were very helpful, pleasant and knowledgable.I would definitely recommend a visit in wet or dry weather."
90,Definitely worth the visit!!,"Our family party of 16 had a super day.  From our personal welcome from Ian, we all enjoyed the Victorian special events.  The children's favourite bit was going underneath the ship and the grown-ups liked the engines.  Overall, highly recommended."
91,A top quality exhibit and museum,We came for a day out & the SS Great Britain didn‚Äôt disappoint. It really is like stepping back in time. Every part of the visit was really interesting & it gave you an insight of what it must of been like to travel aboard this magnificent ship. Will definitely visit again soon.
92,Outstanding,"We spread our visit over two days. Nice quiet out of season visit. Had a short talk on the preservation. This ranks as one of our top attractions, so much history but incredibly well presented. We were physically limited on the walking, but provision of lifts, ramps, lighting made everything easy. The team have really thought through how best to display. Very educational and enjoyable. Wonderful setting, very helpful and friendly staff. Ticket valid 12 months. Car park next door - near the well hidden Banksy girl and earring."
93,Great family day out,"Educational, interesting and fun! Enjoyed the dry dock seeing under the ship and the displays in the area on the lower deck. Had a good museum packed full of information for those who enjoy reading about the ships history. The tickets include entry for the whole year too so can‚Äôt go wrong, especially if you live in the local area! The staff are amazing and so knowledgable! Would definitely recommend."
94,Fantastic day out.,Very interesting especially to anyone who likes ships or Victorian history. The restoration of the vessel is excellent with lots of interesting stuff to see. The story of its journey from a rusty hulk in the Falklands to what you see now is also absorbing. Due to needing to start the drive home to Essex we only spent 2 hours but on my own as a history buff I could have spent four. Recommended.
95,Just visit. Great place for all,Great place for locals and for tourists. Well maintained and very informative love waking around the ship - having such a  prominent place in the centre of the city is a massive plus.
96,An absolute must ,This was my third visit over the last 25yrs and I would definitely visit again. Very informative & interesting and you are able to see so much of the ship outside and inside. The museum is well laid out and the staff are friendly & helpful.We only had coffee in the restaurant but my only criticism is that the track & trace information sheet was on the counter for all the see & access. Surely this is confidential information and could be open to abuse in this current climate.
97,A great  family learning experience in Bristol ,"What an interesting place to visit! There is loads of interesting stuff about the ship, it's history and conditions on board.I would say this should definitely be on your ""to do"" list whilst in Bristol. Well worth the money."
98,Great museum experience ,Having been in Bristol several times in the past had never been to see the SS Great Britain was astonished that it was brought back seeing from the photos the state she was in.Anyway the restoration is fantastic all the original are great. The Brunnell exhibition is also worth seeing  Great day out ..
99,Excellent for all the family ,"Visited with my 12yr old son. Very enjoyable couple of hours spent wandering around the museums, boat and playing with the 'hands on' stuff. From start to finish, the staff were approachable, helpful and very informative. Well worth visiting! Tickets are valid for one year and we are very much looking forward to visiting again very soon!"
100,Excellent,We went today and it was brilliant from start to finish... even the rain wasn‚Äôt a problem!! Had to book a time slot... a slight que when we arrived - but the actor was amazing at entertaining and involving the children - lots of smiles. We have been here a few times a few years ago and we loved the new bits that have been added... really informative and lots to keep the kids entertained.. And you get 1 years full membership so you can visit as many times as you want ... Can‚Äôt wait to go on a more sunny day...!!
101,Totally brilliant a must visit experience,"Very interesting and informative. Brunel was such a significant person (engineer, entrepreneur etc.) seeing the ship he created still accessible. Very reasonable entry fee to different exhibits valid for a year. Suitable to a wide range of ages."
102,"A good ""covid secure"" attraction!","varied, well thought out and interesting. The 'underwater' part enables you to really see how this ship was constructed and then suffered."
103,A supremely educational experience that demands at least three hours.,"So interesting, initially teenager didn't look impressed but soon got reading and asking questions. Really worth a visit. Staff very helpful and happy to answer questions. The thought of the trip to Australia still makes me feel a bit ill though!"
104,First class,Whilst staying in Bath we took the train down to Bristol to view this amazing feat of engineering. Well worth a visit if in Bristol.
105,A lovely morning visit despite social distancing.,"Definitely make time to see the ship--amazing afternoon with a very friendly and accommodating staff. Well worth the 18 pounds. Plan to spend 3-4 hours--it's that interesting and that full of great, interesting and interactive displays. It's just fascinating to roam under the ship and through the three decks. Gives you a great feel for what life must have been like back then. You can see the kitchen, surgery room, storage of large animals, and rooms for the crew, standard, and rich. Really fascinating and glad I stumbled upon it."
106,Excellent visit,So much effort has gone into this experience. We learned a great deal in a fun and interesting way. The ship and the presentation of accommodation along with stories of passengers is fascinating. The museum surpassed our expectations. Good fun and educational
107,A great visit thoroughly enjoyable,"Had a great few hours at the SS Great Britain.  It seems like a bit pricey but you get a lot for your money.  You can walk through the ship, a museum and a very new museum on Brunel himself.  The latter is very interesting, fresh and interactive. All ways are now one way and there is so much sanitizer you can bath in it.  Tge volunteers are always handy to explain and inform.  We had a lovely volunteer, called Tim who knows every rivet and niche of the ship, show us around a bit. A really nice visit."
108,A must to visit you won‚Äôt be disappointed,"Literally every part of this visit was fantastic. From the wonderful staff welcome - all coping brilliantly with top notch covid distancing in place - around the three sections of the museum (four if you also count the super back story film a bout the recovery of the SS Gt Britain in 1970) to the super stylish gift shop at the end.Having visited The Victory in Portsmouth many times, I can definitely say this is on a par with even better story narratives and historical social settings throughout the ship and across the museums. The incredible detail that the re-imagination team has put together is astonishing. Open a drawer in a sidebard in the section before you enter the ship and you learn about the real people in the photographs  on top of the sideboard. THEN as you go around the ship lo and behold, you come across the actual lives and models of those people in settings so realistic you a ctually gasp!Hard to put it into words and I haven't even mentioned tha fact you can literally visit the exterior base of the ship underneath the re-created water line and stand exactly where IKB stood to inspect his ship being  built. JUST VISIT! And take young and old alike!"
109,Old sailing ship restored ,What a fantastic day out.  This is one of the best old ships we have visited but it is made even better by the additional Brunel exhibition and the day dock visit.  Pre booking is important currently as numbers are limited but this meant we could wander at leisure and enjoy all the exhibits without being crowded.  Fully Covid compliant throughout.
110,Great day out,"SS Great Britain have achieved am excellent balance of education, entertainment, accessible interpretation and serious history. Very impressed with the experience. I'd avoid the caf√© though - too small and slow to cater for the number of visitors."
111,Total immersion in history ,"Visited this historic ship while on a damp day in Bristol . It is very interesting and to see an early ‚Äòcruise‚Äô ship,even the first class passengers had pretty cramped quarters. Husband interested in the machinery and large propellers. Two museums on site,one about the ship the other a more modern approach to Brunel‚Äôs life and works,several hands on and experience exhibits."
112,Excellent Customer service,It‚Äôs a beautiful museum and definitely worth a visit. I believe best place for kids to learn about engineering too. I loved knowing about that.
113,Amazing experience!,"We had a lovely evening aboard. We went to celebrate my birthday. It was a gin tasting evening. Would recommend, would be nice to visit again in daylight"
114,Excellent day,Brilliant to see what the charity has done with the attraction. Well organised and informative staff. Spotless exhibits and a variety of interactive features. The ship is clearly fantastic and the whole thing highlights not just Brunel's genius but a key part of our history.
115,Amazing visit to SS Great Britain,"Great place and well spend half a day with a great piece of British history. The staff was absolutely amazing- really knowledgable, helpful and kind."
116,SS Great Britain - fantastic,"Had a great day on the SS Great Britain with relatives from Australia. Lots to do and see, all ages enjoyed the experience from 2 years to 68 years!"
117,Great History experience,"We had a brilliant afternoon on the SS Great Briton, what an amazing piece of history. We loved the way the whole experience was based around stepping back in time, there was a huge amount of effort that had gone into making this place extra special and giving us a insight into the history of the ship. Well worth a visit !"
118,Visit on second day of opening after Lockdown Closure,"Fab museumVery interesting educational but fun! The whole ship is interactive with rooms and different levels to see, one way system.The museum is set up with different smells and sounds to make it more believable, feel like you are on board in 1800‚Äôs.The tour guides are helpful and informative Sanitise stations all over and ppe won‚Äôt by staff. You don‚Äôt have to wear masks."
119,Fabulous!,"It's an interesting one hour tour with many interesting details about history and the ship. But, to be honest, it looks a bit like attraction from 30 years ago. They could update it a bit and add some more interactivity and modern technology to make a tour more interesting. Very nice thing is that ticket is valid for a year, so kids can come more then once."
120,Great day out incorporating social distancing ,Highly recommend going throughout COVID-19! It is perfectly safe & hand sanitiser was accessible throughout the visit. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially Ryan who was very enthusiastic and told us loads of great facts and highlighted the navy stories which we enjoyed! Definitely will be going back!
121,"Great day out, very well organised",Excellent museum. You can easily spend 3h inside this fabulous travel through history. Suitable with children
122,Superb visit - excellent guide.,"The staff were very friendly and knowledgable. Each one had a story about Brunel, the ship and it‚Äôs captains. The dry dock was fascinating; being able to walk around the hull of the ship from bow to stern was incredible, especially with the water rippling in the sunshine above our heads. The journey to get on board, via the museum was filled with interesting items including personal accounts of voyages, interactive displays, video accounts and a huge mechanical display of the lifting propeller so the ship could travel faster under sail. The boat is accessed via a gangway from the museum on to the large open deck. Down below you start at the steerage class accommodation and then work your way through the first class accommodation towards the stern via the kitchens. What struck us was the tiny size of the  beds! So narrow it‚Äôs hard to see how they managed to sleep at all.On leaving the ship we spent another hour looking through the Brunel museum which is a great bonus. The kids especially loved the train simulation. In summary, as a family of 5 with children aged 10-15, I have to say that the all-round experience was excellent. It was our first family day out since COVID lockdown and the SS Great Britain site is managed extremely well. Hand sanitiser is adjacent to all doors and interactive displays so can be used after touching anything. Moving through the site was a relaxed experience with no bottlenecks. Lastly, an unexpected bonus - once purchased, the tickets give you access for a further 12 month period. I‚Äôm sure we shall visit again!"
123,Really interesting and lots to see,Loads to see and very very interesting. Easy spend several hours looking around. Tickets enable you to come back again in the year. Well worth a visit
124,A lot to see,"We visited today on the second day after re-opening, my partner booked the trip as a surprise day out for me. We didn't know at the time but the reopening coincided with the 50th anniversary since the ss GB was brought to dock at Bristol.We booked a 1pm slot ahead of time which is now mandatory to control numbers in the enclosed spaces.The volunteers are all incredibly well trained in customer care and are clearly very passionate about the vessel. We were welcomed by a costumed man who checked we had a slot then handed us over to uniformed staff who talked us through how the visit would work. We also got a free info leaflet with map, nice touch.The vessel has been cordoned off and discreet stickers placed on the floor to control the direction you travel in and prevent crowding in areas which we thought was really efficient and should probably stay after the controls are lifted!Down to the experience itself. A lot of time and money has been invested in carefully displaying relevant scenes in the vessel, especially the doctors quarters and kitchens. There is the added delight of the Brunel museum which I understand is a more recent addition. We paid ¬£18 per adult but I feel like we got excellent value as there wasn't any area we couldn't see clearly and the staff were on hand with ample amounts of knowledge to supplement the displays. I had a whale of a time and got some really good photographs for the memory book. This is my first visit but my partners third and even he said it was worth coming back to. Plus a one time ticket gets you back in again within a year. So no reason not to go."
125,As the locals say - gert lush!,It may be a bit pricey but we really felt that we got superb value for money. There was so much to see and always volunteers on hand to offer more if needed.
126,Great day out,"This is definitely an attraction that's well worth a visit. Minimum time you would need to get round the museum and ship would be around 2 hours, even longer if you spent time really taking in all the exhibits. This attraction is well organised. Book your tickets online and you will be allocated a time slot. Social distancing isn't a problem. Suitable for all ages."
127,Full of history,"This was recommended by the locals as a great attraction.  I wasn't sure. . .But it turned out to be fascinating.  The SS Great Britain was the first propeller ship, and it sailed over 1 million miles in its lifetime.  Learning about its designer, IK Brunel was also interesting.  Definitely worth a visit."
128,The best ship related attraction ever!,"This exhibition and everything at the site was quite awe inspiring.  To think that this wonderful ship was a rusty hulk only fifty years ago.   I didn't manage to see everything in my visit, as I had to be back singing at the cathedral, but my ticket lasts another 12 months and I shall be back."
129,If you love sensory museums then this is awesome!,Arrived and forgot to book online but luckily the kind gentleman dressed as Brunel said that he could squeeze us in! A lovely experience worth every penny. Made our day!
130,Fantastic all around,"The SS Great Britain has had a lot of work put into it to recreate some sense of what a transatlantic crossing on this thing was like.This ship ended its floating days as a coal hulk, so the interior reconstruction has been extensive indeed, with many surprising touches and details. Information about the ship is plentiful and well-presented, and there's a load of stuff in a massive shed as well as the preserved/restored vessel itself. Sitting in a dry dock, the ""underwater"" part of the ship is accessible inside and out, with the water line represented by a glass ceiling, beneath which the air is kept de-humidified to preserve the fragile hull. Inside the ship, the various decks and areas provide some stark social contrasts, from the opulence of the first-class dining lounge and cabins, via the alarmingly basic and scant surgeon's quarters, sick bay and quarantine, through the rat-infested ship's kitchen and down to the austere and basic ""steerage"" accommodation, and the animal pens in the bowels of the ship, overlooked by the Brunel's mighty steam engine.The cost of entry is about ¬£17 for an adult. If you're travelling, arrive early to make a full day of it as there is plenty to see. And keep your ticket safe, because it allows multiple re-entry for an entire year. Although ¬£17 seems a bit steep, actually, considering the work that's gone into preserving this historic ship and making it accessible and educational, I would say it's actually excellent value.There's a cafe and gift shop, nothing wrong with either. In summer, there's also often a little steam train to take you between the SS Great Britain and the M-Shed. You can also get there by car, or by water-taxi from Temple Meades via Castle Park."
131,A must do when in Bristol!!!,"Undoubtedly a must go in Bristol and if you have young kids better, there are activities for them! The cristal sea is something worth looking at and gives a more realistic visit. The boat has been restored to the detail.Loved the part where you can get dressed for the inaugural trip and looking inside the cabin rooms.Do not miss the Brunell exhibit on site."
132,A notable ship very well-presented by dedicated volunteers,"Mixed feeling today as we travelled down to Bristol to see the SS Great Britain exhibit.  The realisation that 38 years had passed since we had seen the ship and it certainly has been an amazing transformation from what we saw back in 1982.  Today, the staff were amazing, kind and helpful and we felt safe throughout the time of our visit. We recalled to one of the members of staff, Andrew, how we saw a painting of the boiler on the boiler bulkhead wall.  Now there is an amazing replica of the engine that existed when the ship travelled the seas all of that time ago.The exhibit recounts many interesting facts, stories of the seafaring ship and the physical exhibits that add a very realistic view of what life might have been like on board.  So worth a visit and we will definitely be returning again to soak up more of Brunel."
133,Great accessibility ,"Highly interesting and informative. Great day out for all the family -  and my wife, who I've taken separately.Beautifully restored, friendly staff,  and incredibly interesting and well told"
134,Make sure you visit the ship!,Despite some of the exhibits being closed due to COVID-19 they had all the safety procedures  in place making our visit feel very safe.  Displays were very informative.  Excellent staff on hand to help and explain items around the tour of the ship.  Slightly disappointed couldn't go and view under the ship as this part was closed but totally understand in current circumstances - but with the ticket price valid for trip for a whole year we will def be back again - thank you
135,A memorable experience,"Visited the ss Great Britain and found it very interesting and educational.you can go down into the dry dock to looked at the hull and propeller.Then go up to the deck a see how it  all works, the go below deck see how people slept,eat and cooked. There is two small museums  to look at and also a very good stocked shop so you can get a small souvenir from a pencil to a model of the ship ."
136,Good fun ,"After many visits to Bristol we finally went to the SS Great Britain, and it was well worth the visit. Plenty to occupy child and interest adults. The annual ticket is a bonus. I am sure we will visit again."
137,Excellent in so many ways,You will need to book a time slot but really worth visiting. The Brunel exhibition is very interesting and well set out
138,Fantastic Bit of Bristol's History,What a wonderful restoration! The entire family loved this self-guided museum and tour of the ship. Each area was so well presented that we all walked away and couldn't stop talking about what journeying onboard the ship for 18 months must have been like for the passengers. Definitely a highlight of our vacation. Loads of food and coffee nearby and a super friendly staff.
139,History you can touch,"If you haven't been then this is a must, a very well organised and presented display from start to finish, there is an array of well placed exhibitions and a lot of information to digest, all in all a very worthy visit followed by a visit to the cafe serving some wonderful home made cakes.If you are planning a visit with so much to see and do and a fine day you really need to allow half a day to enjoy all there is too see."
140,Great day out for all,"amazing to see this historic ship in the very dock it was built. This is real history as the first metal hulled, screw propellor driven transatlantic ship. Step back in time and enjoy the story of the great engineer Brunel. Easy to get to using the dock water taxi or drive and park there. Kids will love it."
141,Great Day out.,"Highly recommend! Excellent visit to SS Great Britain, plenty of information. You can really imagine what life was like on board this ship, will be returning."
142,Winter visit,Went today and really friendly place. Fabulous set up with new one way system in place which helps improve visit and ensure you see the whole ship.  It needs your support. Book online for a time slot and support them please.
143,This was real value for money.,"So much to see so much history,A wonderful museum lots of effort gone in to making it interesting for children and adults alike, We thought at first the entrance fee was pricey but then realised you can visit When you wish for 12 months, Good value, The staff are excellent and will answer any questions you may ask, Well worth a visit."
144,Good visit,"There‚Äôs so much to see and experience here with knowledgeable volunteers keen to advise and inform it‚Äôs well worth visiting for more than a couple of hours. Children won‚Äôt be bored! There‚Äôs also the Being Brunel museum on site featuring all the other bridge and tunnel projects Brunel was working on. The tickets aren‚Äôt cheap but last a year so if you miss anything there‚Äôs an opportunity to return. It‚Äôs the 50th anniversary this year of the ship‚Äôs recovery to Bristol from the Falklands and so the ss Great Britain will feature in Bristol harbours Festival of the Sea this year,  so I‚Äôll be coming back then!"
145,Far better than I anticipated,"We were visiting Bristol for a long weekend seeing the sights and this was in my bucket list. I was not disappointed. We booked tickets online and it was easy to collect. There is a small museum next to the ship that is filled with lots of bits from the  ship and lots of information. Very well laid out with a good balance of hands on experiences and reading. We then went onto the ship. This has been sympathetically restored and fascinating to walk round. It was good not having lots of display boards on the ship as this allowed for free flow of people through out. I would also recommend speaking to the dedicated  volunteers who are very knowledgeable and fascinating to talk to. We also visited the onsite cafe. Limited selection, but quality service and friendly staff. The Brunel museum is very worth while and lots to see and do. Again a good mix of interactive and informative displays.  We spent most of the day there and would recommend to all age groups"
146,A Life On The Ocean Wave,Great work carried out by so many people. Well worth a visit. Advise a few hours to be spent here. Interesting for all the family.
147,Amazing history lesson.,We went on their first day open since COVID 19. Pre-booking was essential and was easy enough. Entry was very well organised and friendly. The one way system worked very well and there was hand sanitiser available all over the site and next to each interactive activity . The only unavailable part of the experience was the below water section which wasn't suitable for social distancing. Toilets were on a one-in one-out basis and cleaned very regularly. We had a really good day and would go again.
148,Great to learn about the history of Bristol!,"This is a top quality museum, and if you are into naval history is definitely a must. You get to get inside a 300 year old ship, see its dry dock and learn about the engineer who built it. I liked it- though it was a bit pricey."
149,A great experience,We spent 5 hours here. The ticket lasts for a year.  The exhibits are really interesting and there are three levels in the ship as well as being able to get to the underneath of it.  There is also a museum about Brunel and his family.  Lots for children to do including dressing up. We really enjoyed the whole experience.
150,Excellent restoration and retelling of the first of its kind,"This is a must-do event for a visit to Bristol.  The history is well-presented, seriously interesting and immersive.  Fun for all the ages."
151,Day out from the hustle bustle,We only allowed 2.5 hours and so had to rush a little and miss the Being Brunel museum. Even on a cold day this was an  engaging and enjoyable attraction. They have done a good job retiring different parts of the ship and unlike lots of museums there wasn't loads of ropes blocking things off so it was  good for exploring. It is a fascinating from both an engineering and social commentary perspective and the volunteers were helpful. Fro most parts of Bristol you will need to go over by ferry but it's only ¬£1 each way.
152,Interesting,"Worth a visit. Excellent layout, covering all sections of the boat from top to bottom. Took us about 2 hours to look around everything. Lots of information and knowledgeable staff. Reasonable prices and well worth a visit."
153,Fabulous ,"Arrived without time to go round the museum, but able to just visit the gift shop, made to feel very welcome and the staff were amazing and went the extra mile. Would highly recommend. Take ferry across ¬£1.20 after to visit the other side and walk back into centre."
154,Brilliant!!!!,Yes as well as bridges he also turned his hand to ships. This is the first passenger steamer to be made of iron and to use  a crew propeller rather than a paddle. It is an amazing exhibit. We crossed the river to the ship itself via the little passenger ferry that operates- cost ¬£1 per person. The ship is really interesting. The cabins and bunks in the cabins are tiny! You can really get a feel as to how life on board must have been. There are a lot of staff on hand who are very knowledgeable and happy to help. The shop is a great place to browse around. Entrance fee was ¬£18 per adult but this then gets you free admission for a year- so it is good value. There is a separate exhibition devoted to Brunel himself which is quite interesting plus there is a cafe- but we did not use this.Overall an interesting few hours
155,Absolutely brilliant!,I have visited a long time ago but first time for my 14 year old daughter Museum good but the ship is the star with the dry dock especially interesting Cold and wet day but well worth it
156,Well worth the money,"As a pensioner I was a bit put off by the entrance price. However, once in, we could see it was well spent. I would recommend this to anyone/ it‚Äôs a good three hours spent looking round the dry dock, ship itself and the museum. The staff are fabulous and so knowledgable- the ship itself has been lovingly restored and takes you back to the days when people emigrated to Australia or cruised to America. Would highly recommend"
157,Excellent,"this was to be the highlight of our trip online google said open we  arrived to find out closed mon, tues, weds..... so the low rating is for not notifying google etc of the change in opening days"
158,Very interesting,"Very well laid out, well run and extremely interesting. Parking is close by and throughout the exhibition they have volunteers who convey the history."
159,"Fantastic Value, a must see if you‚Äôre in Bristol. ","Easy to book online with tickets then being valid for 12 months...good value! On arrival we were greeted by the friendly staff and provided with information on their new COVID-19 safety measures, which provided us with the reassurance needed to feel safe. All the staff were wearing visors and there are plenty of hand sanitising stations around the site.  The boat has a one way system and regular reminders about keeping your distance.The SS Great Britain really does bring history to life as you wonder around the decks; really well designed exhibits give visitors and idea of conditions on board for passengers but also mixed with the awe of the engineering. The museum on the dock was fascinating too, a great example of how museums should present history. We will definitely make a trip back to Bristol to visit again."
160,SS Great Britain..A Great British Attraction,"Lots to see and experience. Helpful staff positioned to give extra information wherever you are. We ran out of time, but I would allow at least 2 hours for a visit. Tickets allow you to review it again within 12 months for free"
161,"A lot to do, extremely interesting","I was dragged to this by my partner and wasnt expecting to enjoy it - but it was fabulous. Really, really well put together, clear information, engaging, and gave me a real sense of the ship when it was at its prime. We both thoroughly enjoyed the visit and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
162,Great for a day out,A fascinating visit to a really important piece of UK history. The ship has been transformed by the restoration and it was fascinating to learn about the ship‚Äôs origin and various transformations.
163,Fascinating tour of this iconic ship,"Lots to see here, more than we expected. Quite pricey to get in but can return within the year, and that would be worth doing. Easy to get to from the city centre via the ferry."
164,Interesting,"My partner and I visited over the weekend, spontaneously, as we saw the ship from the road. I have to say the amount of detail about Brunel was fascinating! There was so much to read and see, and the impersonator had a strong physical likeness to Brunel and was very passionate about the history to be explored. The ship was stunning and so well restored! The models and scenes set up about the ship had great detail and even smelled as they would have done! The digital rats and sound affects took us by surprise a few times too!"
165,Decent museum experience if not busy or hoping for refreshments after 3pm,"Everything was so well organised.Time slots, one way system. Very clean, felt safe from start to finish.Staff very friendly and helpful.Everyone must have worked  so hard to produce a perfect place to visit You won‚Äôt be disappointed whatever your age.So much to see and do"
166,Interesting place. Could add some interactivity.,"From the moment I bought my ticket the staff were pleasant and so helpful. A guide took me down to the bottom of the ship and told me the history of it, a surreal experience being under water while walking round the exterior of the ship.  The ship itself has been so well reconstructed to tell the story of its life.  Lots to see and read, in fact too much to really take in with just one visit so had to buy the official guidebook so that I could read it in depth when I got home.Again advised by staff to try the coffee shop as the choice of cakes was good, indeed scones with jam and clotted cream were excellent.A real jem of history not to be missed on a trip to Bristol."
167,Adventure Day Out,"So firstly you can look under the boat and it's surrounding by a glass pane given you the sense that you are looking at in from under water. There is a fantastic museum to go with it but the best bit for me was going on deck to then find out that you can go through one of the cabin doors and walk down the most narrow of staircases to actually look around the inside of the ship! Each floor has many different rooms to explore e.g engine room, living quarters ect. However the thing that got me most is that they have wax models set up in each of the rooms to help set a visual image but most impressively each of the rooms smell how you would expect. The butchering area does smell like fish and the kitchen smells like proper cooking... Unfortunately the sick bay also does smell of sick but this all of this I find awesome!"
168,"Very enjoyable, informative about an Entrepreneur, Inventor and Engineer - IKB",Tools the grandparents for a day out and they loved it. Accessible for them and a very educational day out
169,So much better than your average tourist trap.,"It is definitely the best ship related attraction we have ever visited, beating even probably more famous ones like Titanic Belfast and The Royal Yacht Britannia in Edinburgh. It is MUCH better. There are so many things you can see here. You start with a dry deck, which gives you impression of looking at the ship from under the water. Then you can visit the museum with a lot of objects connected with the ship. It is a great history lesson, the objects have interesting descriptions, there is some interactive equipment used as well. From the museum you go to the ship itself and that is probably the most spectacular part. The decks are very convincingly reconstructed which gives you an idea how the ship look like in the past, when it was still in use. You can visit the cabins, the first and the second class, the lounge, the kitchen, the surgery - amazing journey in the past! The final part is Being Brunel museum, which presents the history of this great brain, the man who created so many things we use until now. Belive me, the tickets are super cheap for all what they include! One more thing to add - we visited the place now, in coronavirus period and I really felt safe. There are many bathrooms on the way, you can wash your hands regularly. All the staff bathrooms were fully stocked in washing accessories. Do not panic and go to enjoy Brunel's SS Britain!"
170,Worth visiting if you are into ships and history,"This really is an interesting way to spend several hours. The SS Great Britain is huge, and the interior so much more ""realistic"" and interesting than the Endeavour in Dundee or the Victory in Portsmouth. The associated museums are packed with interesting stuff. !8 quid, but in my opinion the entry price is value for money, and the fee entitiles you to entry for a year."
171,Unforgettable experience with children and friends,"A fantastic place to visit, so much to do and see thereVery interactive, historically interesting and   one of the best places I have visited in a long timeWill be back to climb the riggings, ran out of time on this visit"
172,Gin tasting ,"As an authentic museum the SS Great Britain is very good. Lots of original artefacts and stories to go with them, which enhances the experience especially for my children. However, it is not easy to navigate or view many of the areas when there is more than a small handful of people present. Obviously on the ship itself this is expected but the surroundings could be improved. Additionally the closure of the on-site cafe at 3pm was mildly frustrating, especially with young children who by ending their experience with an ice-cream would have come away even happier. All in all a decent museum and average experience, just don't go when it's expected to be busy or want a cup of tea after 3pm!!"
173,Well worth a visit,"Went there a year ago, not long after the Brunel museum opened.This is an essential place to visit for anyone with an interest in Bristol's history.The ship is enough on its own but when you add the Brunel experience you get an incredible destination.Interactive and evocative we will certainly be back (which isn't difficult as buying a ticket allows repeat visits)."
174,Excellent ,"Came with some friends. Good value as your ticket allows you admission for a whole year! It seems as though there is something for everyone here, interactive aspects and activities for children as well as informative displays for adults. Worth a visit"
175,Another Brunel masterpiece,"I can't fault it!  The presentation is superb, from the museum to the history of Brunel. and the way the ship is  preserved and available  to view both inside and out.The presentation is well thought out, well done and a delight to see.Not a quick hour tour - do reserve at leat a couple of hours for your viewing, and you'll probably want to come back again (your ticket is valid for a year, I was told).An absolute gem and tribute to an exceptional designer, engineer and entrepreneur ."
176,Great history ,"We haven‚Äôt been here for several years so the Victorian weekend seemed like a good time to revisit. What an excellent few hours we had here. The Victorians were brilliant and spent time with all the children explaining who they were and their jobs and how they lived. They got them to help them with there jobs and paid them with chocolate ha‚Äôpennies. Kids loved it and listened attentively. Fake snow made it all seem just that bit more Christmassy as was making Victorian Christmas cards. Lots of information about the ship, people who sailed on her, places she went, etc and lots of very knowledgable staff too.Lovely new Brunel rooms too. All in all a great day out and the ticket allows you unlimited visits during the year - great for us locals for sure. We most definitely will be back."
177,SS BREAT BRITAIN TOUR,Utterly amazing. You are welcomed by Ishambard Kingdom Brunel. Everyone has to wear a face mask but that doesn't affect your enjoyment. One of the tour guides Keith was very knowledgeable. I can't tell you about everything because you need to see it for yourself. The ticket lasts all year so we will certainly try to go again.
178,Brunel exhibition is great - other parts are needing refurbished,"Great day out here with four young kids in tow. Staff were knowledgeable,  friendly and a pleasure to deal with. Measures to be covid secure were well thought out and utterly sensible. Brunel himself was really friendly and helpful, showing us to Riggers Yard. My son really appreciated the volunteer on the boat deck who talked him through all the animals onboard. Brunel Museum is a great addition to the experience, We look forward to coming back."
179,Great! ,"Really get to feel what a sea voyage was like 150 years ago, warts, rats and all. The attraction is also a testament to the engineer who built the ship, together with many other engineering feats, Isambard Kingdom Brunell."
180,The plight of the people travelling steerage was highlighted perfectly,What a brilliant museum if you can call it that. Fascinating 3 hours spent. Staff went out of their way to talk about anything related to this ship.
181,brilliant,"the SS Gt Britain is well worth a visit, so much to see and is a must for the kids, plenty of facts to learn and experience life on board as it was then. thoroughly recommend."
182,First rate visitor attraction,"Excellent experience.Very interesting ,with loads to see and read.Going below the 'perspex water level' to see the hull was fascinating.Ok the ticket price may seem a bit expensive but even the 2 hours we spent there wasn't enough and if I'm able to return within the year it's FREE :-)Fantastic place to visit.PS  Brunel greeting you on your arrival was cool."
183,An Interesting Exploration of a Fascinating Vessel,Unmissable experience. There is always something new to see. The current booking system is easy and allows more space to see everything.
184,The premier attraction in Bristol,Loved the history of the ship and the way it is now presented in the dry dock where it was built. The museum that is attached let's you get dressed up for a selfie...
185,Exceptionally good ,Superb experience and an awesome way to spend a rainy morning in BristolToo much to see in one go so happy that ¬£17 buys unlimited entry for a year.  I'll definitely be going back to look at more Brunel stuff
186,amazing,Very polished museum from the Brunel actor entertaining those queuing outside to the ship itself where you can walk across the deck as well as around the hull in the dry dock.  Lots of interesting exhibits for all ages. Biggest hit ironically was spending 15-20mins drawing circles in a mock railway carriage trying to get higher than 90% (need to visit in order to understand that last comment :-))
187,Superb ,"I enjoyed every aspect of visiting the SS Great Britain. The different displays and viewing areas covered all of the ship's history and restoration in depth: the restored interiors were especially interesting, helping you to appreciate what a long voyage must have been like, while seeing the the more corroded lower part of the hull in the dry dock demonstrates the fragility of this old ship and how lucky we are to still have it at all. There are also exhibits dedicated to the life of Isambard Kingdom Brunel himself and his other projects, with plenty of interesting artefacts. In terms of Covid-19 precautions, the only minor inconvenience was the queue to use the toilet - a one-way system was employed when entering the ship itself, which did not detract from the experience at all, and there was more freedom in the outdoor areas, with access to hand sanitiser throughout. The staff were also friendly and able to answer questions."
188,Worth the visit.,"Excellent attraction, with plenty of variety - a real sense of life on ship, a fascinating story of the ship‚Äôs recovery and trip to its present location, brilliant to go ‚Äòunderwater‚Äô to inspect the outside - and a very creative exhibition on Brunel, mixing interactive items with the historical artifacts. Couldn‚Äôt improve on any of it."
189,Day out,Well worth visiting would definitely recommend this could not believe the renovation achieved of what must have looked like a lost cause
190,Phenomenal exhibit,Fantastic couple of hours spent with a guide with a wealth of knowledge shame I can‚Äôt remember his name!Very interesting!
191,History brought alive,I first visited the SS Great Britain soon after it was returned to Bristol on a barge from the Falklands and have visited many times over the years. It‚Äôs a great visitor attraction presented in a sympathetic way by the side of the river. There‚Äôs lovely places to eat and drink along the riverside - it‚Äôs s great day out.
192,Beautifully restored ship,"Fantastic place to visit, brilliant restoration.Good to see part of our history not being ridiculed"
193,Brilliant Historical Visit,"Wonderful museum for all ages.  Lots to do and learn.  Good for sunny and rainy days.  Could easily spend the whole day here but can be done in half a day.  The ticket even allows you to come back for up to a year.  Would come again, thank you very much!"
194,Interesting and involving ,"This was my first visit to this historic ship, and certainly won't be my last.  The restoration from a wreck in the Falklands to I believe Bristol's greatest treasure is just amazing, and has to be seen to be believed.  The charity have brought the whole ship to life, with lifelike models and all the paraphernalia that one would expect from cooking utensils and meat in the abbatoir, a bakery with lifelike bread, to the ships surgeon and the engine turning over.  Added to which the staff on board are excellent, and the entertainment for children during their half term kept them enthralled.  Being able to view the hull under the panoply of water above, visiting all the decks as well as the other attractions including the history of Brunel, was amazing. 10/10, a brilliant attraction for Bristol."
195,Worth a day,"Took my sister to visit, having been myself a few years ago.  Just reopened post Covid lock down and all felt very safe and secure.  The one way system actually made it a much better experience.  Staff were all polite - especially Mr Brunel at the entrance!  The Brunel exhibition wasn't there last time I visited and it was really interesting and well done - a worthy addition.  Cafe was good too - nice to sit outside in the sunshine and soak up the atmosphere with coffee & cake.Bonus that the tickets are valid for a year - will certainly look to return!"
196,Must see,An excellent history of the ship and Brunnel himself. The ship was set up as it would have been during its voyages. The use of wax models who resemble the actual people they represent was an great addition to the experience. Well worth a visit.
197,Recommend a visit,"Visited with my parents and had a wonderful time. Mum is disabled and so Dad, as her carer, entered free of charge. All staff were extremely attentive and keen to ensure that Mum was sufficiently catered for. They were also very enthusiastic and very knowledgeable.The ship itself is spectacular and the restoration has been cleverly done to give a real feel for what it would have been like to be a passenger on board. The additional Brunel museum and exhibits are also very enjoyable and informative.This is a must visit attraction for anyone visiting Bristol."
198,A good day out,This is a very good attraction near to the centre of Bristol.  Very friendly informative staff. The SS Great Britian was a wonderful feat of engineering and the displays brought sll those to life.  Really enjoyed the dressing up area! How did the women wear those heavy dresses all day?
199,Brings Brunel and This Grand of Lady to Life,"The SS Great Britain is truly 'great' it was the worlds first ever iron ship and it was driven by a propeller and not sails. People thought it would sink, but it was a triumph of Victorian engineering. This is the Grand Grandmother of all the current cruise ships, having been brought back as a rusting hulk from a bay in the Falkland Islands to the actual dock where it was built. The ship which has been fully restored and gives a marvelous insight into what life was like in the 19th Century. The cabins and public areas have the sounds and smells and even a couple of rats to give you the type of experience you might encounter on board. They have installed a replica steam engine and the kitchen(with its greedy cat) is a great addition. The technology used to keep the underside of the ship from rusting is worth the entrance fee on its own. You enter the ship through a fascinating museum and then go trhrough each deck of the ship until you dis-embark and enter the new Brunel exhibition which has a lot of fun items, letters and paintings as well as some of his many inventions. He was a true pioneer and the greatest British engineer of his generation. The museum is unusual in the fact that your entry ticket lasts a year so you can visit as often as you like without paying again in that period. This is one of the best attractions of its type in the World a truly remarkable museum and ship to a truly remarkable man."
200,Ready to launch,"visited the ss Great Britain on the 6/02 . well worth the money. interesting , with out being to technical.an insight in to the history of the ship . well worth visits for all ages"
201,"Great visit, well worth the money",We took a 3 year old and a baby round the SS Great Britain at half term and it kept us busy most of the day. Good facilities for young children and not too fraught in the cafe.  Expect to make return trips over the next few years
202,Fantastic boat to visit,"Very interesting, what a great place, you‚Äôll need at least 4 hours to get round it all, but the good thing is, is that your tickets are valid for 1 year, so if you don‚Äôt get to see it all you get to go back."
203,"What a Gem, what a surprise","the ship is amazing, way ahead of its time. The tour is well worth every penny. below the keel as well as on desk and down in the cabins."
204,"Absolutely brilliant, exceeded all expectations","This was the first day they were open after the covid lockdown.  Everyone seemed pleased to be back and delighted to see us.  I've been here several times before and the safety measures didn't detract from the experience.  It's a fantastic place, well worth a visit."
205,Great visit - plenty to see and engaging,"This is a great half a day out. Our kids are probably too young (5&2) to spend as much time as we wanted to here, and it was a tiny bit stressful trying to keep the 2 year old from touching this he shouldn't be - but all in all a great activity for all ages. The staff were brilliant, all on hand to help & very aware of covid procedures. I will definitely be visiting again when the kids are a little older."
206,Mr Franklin Hill,I thought I was really only visiting an old ship but it was so much more! A living museum. Excellent displays and artefacts. Lots of people around to answer your questions and best of all the ship to explore which is set up to show how the ship was used and lived in by crew and passengers. Plenty to do for everyone.
207,Be Amazed!!!!,Iv visited the shop every year since it came home from the Faulkland islands. Saw it sale up the river avon for the last time all those tears ago. Great day out for the family.
208,So interesting and you can spend many hours visiting SS Great Britain,We visited the SS Great Britain on a cold wet March afternoon. The reception were friendly and gave a small discount for visitors using the hop on hop off bus. There were a lot of information and needs at least half a day to fully enjoy it. We also caught part of a talk on the history of the ship at 2 pm. Got to know the hardships in the old days. Time well spent though we wish the weather was fine!
209,Why haven‚Äôt I been here before?,A fantastic ship and museum. You could spend a day at this site. There is also a shop in the entrance with plenty of cafes nearby.
210,Living history,"This was our second visit to the SS Great Britain as we had been last April and the ticket lasts for a year! We decided to take our 6 year old grandson as were looking after him on the last day of half term. He loved it especially the 'dry dock' area where you can walk around the original hull and get an immediate sense of the size of this great ship. Then into the museum with an endless amount of information showing the making and then the recovery of the ship and finally its restotation. You then finally go on board the boat and down into its body, looking into the small cabins with their tiny bunks and walk through the dark kitchens complete with resident modael cats that caught the rats that plagued these ships on their long journies. There are also elaborately decorated dining rooms, the Doctors' offices, the engine room etc etc which can take you hours to see. After two hours and with one tired but happy little boy, we then disembarked to the cafe next to the boat and had good coffees and very tasty cakes. All in all, a brill day for the three of us and we will be back yet again!"
211,Superb ,Well presented and informative museum. Ship was fascinating. It is well preserved and laid out to show visitors how life would be on board.
212,Great experience!,"Expectcular experiencie on board! Discovering how was really the life inside for the passengers and the crew, the difference between first and third class. The particular smell it has which is the reason for its name ""SS "" stinky smell.The history about the all passengers is very interesting to know. For me is the best experience I got on board, because you can learning something new every time you can visit the Brunnel's SS Great Britain."
213,Wow,Fantastic ship lots of informative staff on hand should you need them. Great Brunel museum too good value for money and the ticket is valid for all year.
214,Well worth the visit,"So glad we visited the museum. It's not usually my type of trip, but it's so well put together that it's hard to get bored and not enjoy what's on offer. The information is easy to understand and very informative. I love how you went back in time and how the ship was set out how it would have been in her prime. The staff were super friendly and they've done a great job in making it 'covid-friendly'. Will visit again and definitely recommend."
215,Very interesting,"We planned to spend a couple of hour exploring the SS Great Britain, but in actual fact we could have spent a whole day - we need to return to finish our exploration.  The entrance fee includes year-long admission to the ship so this will be easy and cheap to plan.    The ship is displayed brilliantly and the volunteers were super-knowledgeable about all aspects of the life of the ship.   So much research has been carried out so it is possible to find out a lot about the people who travelled in the ship, and, as some of them were writers, some of the descriptions are captivating to read."
216,A few days in Bristol,From the moment you arrive (plenty of parking available)  you are greeted by photographs showing the  reclamation journey  from the Falkland Islands back to Bristol  until the moment you say goodbye it is one of the UK's top attractions. As you make you way around there are plenty of knowledgeable guides with a real passion for the subject. Outstanding were Ryan and Joe (on deck). Also think we spoke to a Lucy who was equally helpful. There is so much to see and wonderful for people of all ages.
217,Great fun,If there was ever an exhibition that surprised me it‚Äôs this one. We almost skipped it as we were running short on time. I‚Äôm so glad we didn‚Äôt. It was an interactive story of the ship that made you feel like you were living it. From costumes to try on and bubbling stoves in the kitchen. Women voices gossiping in the rooms and so much more. Just go. Words and ratings can not say enough. Just go.
218,Great day out,"I‚Äôd wanted to see SS Great Britain since an item on Blue Peter in the early 1970s, all about Isambard Kingdom Brunel, possibly with a follow-up feature in that year‚Äôs annual. So our visit was a long-held ambition realised. The whole experience was very well-organised. On-line booking our time-slot tickets was smooth. On the day, we joined the short socially-distanced queue to get in, with IKB-dressed guide welcoming us in, promptly at 10am.Even though this was on the Friday morning before August Bank Holiday weekend, at no point did the exhibition feel crowded, and we felt that hygiene and distancing had been thought through and implemented carefully.The dockside was furnished with various contemporary artefacts, from trunks and other travel accessories, through to a wrought-iron pissoire (not functioning, I hasten to add!)Next comes the museum, telling the story of the ship, from controversial concept in IKB‚Äôs mind, to record-breaking reality. Some parts of the museum were closed to maintain social distancing, but this in no way detracted from the overall experience. The museum was accessible to wheelchair users, with gentle slopes, and wide passageways. The only downside was the lighting, which in parts was decidedly dim, so could be a difficulty for people who are less-able to see clearly.From the museum, there‚Äôs direct access onto the top deck of the ship itself, and it‚Äôs here you get a sense of the scale of the ship - it is huge! Particularly-interesting are the animal quarters, with models of a cow, a pig and some geese in various pens. The tour moves on now below deck, starting with steerage accommodation, again laid out with contemporary artefacts and mannequins, giving an insight into what transatlantic journeys would have been like for ordinary people. Moving on, past the toilets and bathrooms, the first-class accommodation was better-furnished, but still cramped. The first-class saloon and dining room were very interesting. Then it‚Äôs the engine room, crew quarters and hold, complete with its own stables and smithy.Leaving the ship, it‚Äôs time to go below what would have been sea-level, to see the vast ship from below. There had been heavy rain the day before, so this area was closed until midday, whilst it was dried out to make it safe underfoot. Another fascinating experience, highlighting not just the size of the ship, but also its sleek design.Finally, another museum, this one all about IKB himself, his life and many other designs.We left the exhibition around 12.30pm, feeling we‚Äôd seen everything we wanted to see, without hurrying. We would visit again, and would recommend to people from a wide range of other groups.Thank you to everyone involved!"
219,Just SSuperb!!! ,"The ship itself is well worth a visit, with a good sense of what it was like as passenger or crew. The story of the rescue and restoration are also interesting. But for me the museum dedicate to Isambard Kingdom Brunel was the stand-out item. It has very well thought out displays, a good collection of artefacts and lots of nice touches. Seeing some of Brunel's original sketches and letters is great. There is a real sense of the driven, inspired, demanding engineer that he was and what he achieved across ships, bridges, railways and more. The staff are very good. We spoke to Nicole for a long time and her knowledge of what they have in the archives that back up the museum was fantastic."
220,They are improving!,"Great Exhibit, Great Staff, Great Experience, The new Brunel Museum is very very good. An engineering Marvel, lovingly restored  for us to enjoy"
221,Victorian Christmas,"Like many of us, I've been lockdown crazy and wanting to get out and about, but also a littler nervous about it. Selected SS Great Britain as my first visit to an indoor attraction since things started to unlock and it was a great experience. Hand sanitising stations everywhere, and a very well thought out one-way route through the ship, which, because of the enclosed and narrow spaces, might have been a bit of a worry otherwise.  At the moment they're not too busy, so if like me you're looking to test the waters with going out and about, this is a good place to start.  I've been to the site many times over the years, but this was my first visit since the new Being Brunel exhibition was open, and that was a good addition to what was already a good offering.Free re-entry for a year, so I'll be coming back to check out the few areas that were not operating yet (which were being kept closed to avoid pinch points with too many people in the same area).  Lovely staff and volunteers too!"
222,Fantastic ,Interesting especially if are interested in maritime or engineering subjects. The museum is well laid out and guides are well informed.  Recommended for all.
223,"The Amazing Product of a Genius' Brain, Wonderfully Displayed","Just an amazing time here. I would recommend it, though ¬£18 entrance is a little expensive, but tha'ts the going rate it appears."
224,Excellent day out on our doorstep,Went here as last minute decision as we were concerned it was going to rain and we were going to get wet again!  Surprised how interesting it was.  Loved the interactive parts and the stories.  It gave a real feel to what it must have been like to have sailed on the boat with life like figures helping to add to the experience.Being able to see all of parts of the ship was fascinating.Well done to everyone who has worked hard to get this magnificent ship restored and put together the museum and history of Brunel and his magnificent work..An unexpected pleasure and would recommend a visit if you are in the locality. With the ticket valued for a year great value for money.
225,The Great Britain,"I was expecting to visit the ship, the SS Great Britain, but was delighted to find a great deal more.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in nautical, engineering, social or British history.From buying our tickets until the end of our visit we found helpful enthusiastic staff. We started our visit in the Brunel Institute, a fascinating research centre operated in conjunction with the University of Bristol, and then went out to explore the dry dock, the ship itself and the difference museum spaces.Isambard Kingdom Brunel's engineering triumphs are many - including the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, his tunnel under the River Thames, the Great West Railway and, perhaps his greatest achievement, the SS Great Britain which, when launched in 1843 was called 'the greatest experiment since the Creation'.Brunel created a ship that changed history and was the prototype for the modern trans-Atlantic liner. SS Great Britain, with the innovation of a propeller rather than paddles, was the first iron steamer to cross the Atlantic, which she did in 1845 in 14 days.Sadly this great ship was scuttled in 1937 and left to rot under water until in 1970, the businessman Sir Jack Arnold Hayward paid for her decaying hull to be raised and repaired enough to be towed back to the United Kingdom and returned to the Bristol dry dock where she had originally been built where she remains today with her rusted hull preserved and interiors, engine, propeller, rudder and rigging restored, along with displays on her history and of the achievements of Brunel, including the Dock Office in which she was designed by Brunel. First Class, compared to today, was pretty basic - and as for Steerage!.... The reconstruction includes displays of how people lived and worked on the ship, which children in particular appreciated. A fascinating experience from when British engineering was innovative and leading the world."
226,Victorian Christmas,"I have been to over 100 countries. The SS Great Britain ranks among the best attractions  in the world! I have been visiting the ship  since 15 April 1971. The attraction has fully matured to enthrall all one's senses. The replication is to perfection with no expense spared. The fittings, furnishings, manikins, sounds and even the smell of food in the galley compels repeat visits to make the ¬£18 year ticket a real bargain. The dream museum, which at last, provides a crucible for Brunel memorabilia is a true education that is a cozy and intellectual way to pass time; especially on a winter's day."
227,A must for the History Buff!,"Highlight of trip to Bristol docks, the restored SS Great Britain.Exhibition hall with lots of mementos.Lots to see.Interesting inside tour."
228,SS Great Britain,"Not only a beautiful ship but plenty of engaging areas to learn about the history of the ship and Brunel. We visited as a family group and parking was easy (next door) and it is right on the riverfront so it‚Äôs easy to find a pub after for a pint! Walk around the boat itself and into all of the wee rooms that are set up as they would have been - with lots of detail, even smells! We also all dressed up in Victorian outfits for pictures - all part of the museum. The gift shop at the end is good too - not too overpriced which is unusual! A great family visit and plenty of space for kids to run around and explore while you read the history. Access with a pram was easy."
229,HOURS OF INTERESTING HISTORY AROUND BRISTOL DOCKS,"Wonderful visit, very interesting and informative But access to the site is dreadful thanks to road works and diversion by the Council. Had to park on a meter a mile away which restricted the time available for our visit. Cafeteria needs to get their act together, slow and not much stock of anything."
230,Outstanding Attraction,Book online to save some money on the entrance price. Parking next to it was easy to find and you can park for up to 5 hrs for ¬£2 by taking a voucher from the ticket machine into the ticket office when you enter.Really interesting experience about both the ship and brunel himself. Suitable for all ages with good lift access to all parts of the exhibition.
231,Victorian Weekend ,Such a great experience. The ship is wonderfully setup with props in the assorted rooms. It truly feels like you‚Äôre going back in time.
232,Young mind blown,"A really excellent visit - informative and, emotionally speaking, very powerful as one can almost relive the experience of the passengers, especially those cramped into steerage. The guides are wholly approachable, enthusiastic and very well informed. Thank you."
233,Brunel's SS Great Britain Victorian Christmas,"Really good fun and ticket prices are reasonable. They have mannequins on board which are hilarious and a bit freaky, great history and the view from below the ship is stunning."
234,A super day out,"Wow, what a treat! This place is amazing! We hadn't really planned on visiting as such, but so glad we did! It was a fantastic end to a super holiday, even if it was a wet and dreary day! The 'crew' were incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming. Having never been to Bristol before I was impressed with not only the ship itself, but the location was really cool too, set on the docks itself. My children, who are 3 and 6 gave it a big thumbs up too. There are so many interactive activities and things to see and do, we were kept amused for hours! Inside the ship and on deck is fantastic! You really get a sense of what the conditions would have been like and the vast scale of engineering behind the scenes. I just wish we lived nearer to take full advantage of the year long pass you get having only paid once! Well worth the price in my opinion! We've all learnt a lot after our trip and the care and dedication it's taken to restore this 170 year plus ship is remarkable! Do not leave this area without visiting! P. S... I took hundreds of photos but they are not on my phone and I don't think the website does it justice for the amount of things there are to see!"
235,Amazing Victorian Christmas Day out,"Called in to see this old lady whilst I was trying to kill a few hours in Bristol but I could of spent all day there so I suggest you choose your time to visit.Entrance fee wasn't too bad for an attraction of this type, but made more attractive as the ticket is valid for free revisit in a 12 month period, I will certainly go back!"
236,SS Great Britain,"A worthwhile visit to one of the first trans Atlantic liners, the ship is being maintained in a sympathetic manner in order to retain its historical value.The dockside has been put into the period with the exception of the lift into the drydock bottom.The Brunel museum highlights the great man's achievemens"
237,Fascinating history ,Visited on the back of the tv program What the Victorians did for us.Hardly any savings pre booking on line so we just turned up.Lots to see and very knowledgeable volunteers who tell you the best way to tour around.Spent a good couple of hours here.
238,Marvellous from start to finish,"The restoration of the  SS Great Britain  has been superbly done. You can see an exact reproduction of the steerage class quarters through to the first as well as mock up of the original engines. The below waterline exhibition in the dry dock is fascinating, not to mention pleasantly warm on a cold day! You can see the effects of 160 years of corrosion on the hull. The first class dining area is sumptuous and contrasts with the conditions endured by the steerage passengers.  All in all this is an attraction not to be missed when you are in Bristol. Mr Brunel, I take my stove pipe hat off to you!"
239,Brilliant,"This is an excellent exhibit, shown warts and all, not glamorised. The few guides in authentic dress did a first rate job & the adjoining museums were well conceived & informative. Seeing the vessel from the dry dock was interesting & the authentic smells & sounds added to the experience."
240,Interesting 2 hours ,"Bit of a ‚ÄòMarmite‚Äô one - you will either really like it or find it boring. My Spouse wanted to visit & enjoyed the whole experience - would give 5 stars. I found it just ‚ÄòO. K. ‚Äò I preferred a previous trip to H. M. S. Victory . I do not understand the hype surrounding the Great Britain, to be honest. I would give it 3 stars . Not suitable for disabled people. Subsequently gave an average of 4 stars. Expensive, but good Covid implementations in place. You must pre- book tickets. Good gift shop."
241,Fantastic,We went to see the Great Britain today and bask in some of the glory of Isambard Kingdom Brunel.  What a fantastic restoration and the story of her recovery from the Falklands is wonderful.  Great to see her preserved and all the efforts from the volunteers to make sure everyone has a super time - even in these difficult days.  Really great way to spend an afternoon.
242,Couples Weekend away in November staying in The Bristol hotel. Lots of history to see. Very Good hotel with restaurant.,"I know there are not many young people that appreciate going to museums and learning about history, but I had a blast, they do an excellent job with the storytelling side of the museum, and then recreating the world back then.Loved it."
243,Even better than last time,"We thought ¬£18 was quite pricey for entry but it was a rainy Saturday so we gave it a whirl... the entry price is an absolute steal! We spent hours, totally absorbed in the recreation of this beautiful and historic ship. The scale of it and the effort that has been gone to beings the ship to life.All staff were great but special mention to one of the volunteers, Russ Leith, who saw our puzzled faces and took the time to explain to us  the mechanism of the lifting propeller. People like him bring such places alive and make them a day to remember."
244,Excellent,"One ticket allows multiple visits over a year. Don't plan to take in everything in one visit. This is an amazing story that can be experienced.Built into the experience are interesting illustrated talks and interactive displays for the youngsters. Included is the Brunel museum with details and models of his various projects. The actual ship, of course brings back so much interesting history over the decades."
245,Masterpiece of Victorian engineering ,"The ticket may at first seem expensive, but it is absolutely worth it. The experience overall is unique and amazing. The people working on the site are extremely friendly and happy to answer all your questions. The level of detail inside the ship is extraordinary, Totally worth it!"
246,Excellent Experience,"Very informative on all levels, catering for those interested in the engineering and those keener on the social history. Lots of ‚Äúcrew‚Äù on hand to give more details if needed, many in period costume."
247,Great experience,Visited with my partner who is in an electric scooter. No problem whatsoever in getting around (a few tight corners but what can you expect on a ship!) There is even a lift on the ship! I got in for free as a carer too.
248,Very interesting and well worth a visit.,"I cannot recommend this visit enough. From the first greeting from Brunel whilst waiting in a clearly Covid 19 socially distanced queue line to entering the shipyard to be cheerly greeted by friendly knowledgeable volunteers. An excellent first impression. Covid measures are very evident in all areas and at no time did I feel worried about Covid. The ship was a fantastic experience from going underneath to seeing how the ship was set up including smells! Lots to see and do, the atmosphere was great and the day was really enjoyable."
249,Brilliant!,"A fascinating and excellently presented attraction that kept myself, hubby and grumpy 6yr old entertained for 3hrs! The dry dock is genius, the ship is stunning and the surrounding museums interesting for all ages - will be recommending this place to everyone who‚Äôll listen! üö¢‚ù§Ô∏è"
250,Brilliant attraction to visit,"If you visit one thing during a trip to Bristol make it this. Aside from the pure wonder of the ship's recovery from the Falklands and the subsequent restoration, the quality of the ship as a museum is faultless, the information level is just right (educational without being overwhelming), but also as an experience, you can easily imagine being a passenger on the ship travelling to the far corners of the world. It's also quite emotive that the ship is now 'home', which really adds something too. Very highly recommended."
251,A really good exhibit.,Fabulous and fascinating. So much to see and wonder at. Wonderful and atmospheric. We loved it. Educational and appealing too all ages - this is a gem!
252,one of Bristol Crown Jewels to visit,"We had heard of Brunnel in relation to the Clifton suspension bridge. What an engineer! And the ship, it was an amazing experience. On approaching the ship I took a photograph looking down at the propellor, a masterpiece by Brunnel only later to find I could walk directly to the propellor, under the water! Amazing, as one can walk around the keel of the ship, and other interpretation. Well worth the visit"
253,"Wow, a credit to the Trust! ",We visited from South Wales and the train journey was enjoyed. Travelling fromBristol  temple meads by water taxi was almost the highlight of the day for our two grandsons. They did enjoy the Ss Great Britain though. The 3 year old enjoyed going ‚Äòunderwater‚Äô to see the underside of the boat and the 6 year old enjoyed many of the interactive things and stamping his ticket. It‚Äôs a good few hours visit.
254,Great Experience,"The best day out after lockdown of Covid-19. 50th Anniversary of the ship coming back to Bristol, would recommend having a guide."
255,Worth the Visit,Great experience - really interesting displays and recreation of the historic dockyard around the ship. Access to the dry dock under the hull is fantastic to see how it is being protected from corrosion.
256,Great family day out,"Visited here with no preconceptions about what to expect.It was a thoroughly an entertaining, enjoyable afternoon - looking at, enjoying learning about engineering, the size of the tasks mast for sails, boats, bridge, tunnelling, etc, the successes, the failures and how he overcame them.Notable site venue:Under the waterline of SS Great Britain;Aboard SS Great Britain;Engineering Timeline museum;IKB museumPlus the actors who bought it to life with their tours.Thoroughly recommend."
257,Very Interesting and great to see the progress,"This ship, so meaningful to Bristol, is very well presented by dedicated volunteers in an excellent setting: the dry dock in which it was built. The visitor can walk under, on, around, and inside the ship. The museum through which the visitor approaches the ship contains just the right amount of material and artifacts to set the scene. On board, there are excellent recreations of the cabin, salons, kitchens, and offices of the ship's heyday. Wax mannequins in period costume really bring the scene alive, as does the occasional volunteer guide in period dress. To a person these guides were pleasant and eager to engage with visitors. One can also go down into the dry dock and walk around the hull. After visiting the ship, the little museum dedicated to Brunel himself is also worthwhile. This is a well-conceived and well-run museum (other than poor signage inside the ship) that is a credit to the city."
258,Plenty to see,"A great experience, viewing all areas of the first iron liner and first propeller driven liner to cross the Atlantic.  An experience also to go ‚Äòunder the water‚Äô into the dry dock an see the hull, 6-bladed propeller and rudder."
259,A must for anyone with any interest in ships!,"This was a bargain to visit SS Great Britain but this time at night and with entertainment in the dining room and buffet food was a brilliant way to experience life on Board,We were able to wander around st our leisure until music began.Watch out for these gems as you get a completely different experience"
260,Really interesting,"A great day out! Pricey but worth the money, great for couples and families, lots of things for adults, and children however children‚Äôs information could be further developed with help of a teacher many opportunities missed!"
261,Amazing experience,We went by public transport from a park and ride. There is a bus stop very close to the entrance to the museum. Good outdoor displays and unique on-board displays with plenty of information and insight to the ships history.
262,Lots to see,"AMAZING! Such a good day out! Definitely a Bristol must do, informative exhibitions with a really interesting audio guide to help you out and a good balance of interactive activities in the museum too."
263,Impressive exhibition,"Even during the Covid crisis, and parts of the museum are not open. There is so much to see, and Brunel is such an interesting character and this experience shows him off in a very interesting way. Its fun for all the family and you get to see how the ship would of looked and even smelled when it was in service.The ticket can be used again for a full year, so we will take advantage of this when its fully open."
264,What a difference!,"This is a must attraction which is far better than the Cutty Sark in London. Everything from the ticket shop and visitor centre, land side exhibits to the SSGreat Britain where brilliantly staged. Biggest problem is that you need a lot more than a day to see everything although the ticket is valid for 12 months and you can visit as many times as you like.There are a lot of interaction exhibits so good for young ones too!All the staff we spoke to were extremely friendly and very knowledgable and interesting.Will definitely be back."
265,Really interesting place to visit,"Brilliantly planned out around Covid restrictions. Loads of sanitising stations and people cleaning down surfaces. Guides and staff in general were amazing, really friendly and informative. Loads to see and suits all generations. Also, the free 1 year return ticket you get on admission is outstanding value for money. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing!"
266,Great ,"The Brunel experience is a super exploration of all of Brunel's history and inventions. Hands on experiences for children. which are very good although at present some are not available due to inability to sanitize between visitors.Brilliant exploration of the ship, again with things to do, see and explore for all ages."
267,Fascinating; great value.,"Really the only way to see this ship is by purchasing a ticket. You can't see it from land, or from another boat on the water and you can't see it from the inside of the gift shop. So buy a ticket, it's worth it."
268,Night time visit with entertainment and buffet food in dining room,"I see this is the second most popular thing to see/do in Bristol. What's the first? If you do nothing else in Bristol, see the SS Great Britain, then go and see the Clifton Suspension Bridge soaring across the Avon Gorge. Two amazing products of the genius of Isambard Kingdom Brunel! The SS Great Britain has been brilliantly restored and set up to show what it was like for the Victorian passengers and crew that sailed in this magnificent vessel. Don't think you're going to get out of here quickly. The displays and stories will keep you spellbound. Don't miss it!"
269,great visit,"I visited the SS Great Britain with my husband, not really having much idea as to what to expect. But  we had such an interesting day. There was so much to see around the whole site, and it was all so well put together you really felt part of the atmosphere onboard ship. We were there much longer than I thought we would be, as I hadn‚Äôt realised you also get to look around the Brunel Museum etc too. I can thoroughly recommend it , I would also like to say how welcoming, knowledgeable and helpful all the staff were from the minute we walked in, we were greeted and welcomed with such    courtesy and enthusiasm and got an explanation of the site layout, features etc rather than just being ‚Äúsold a ticket‚Äù . A great start to a great visit. Thank you, we loved our day."
270,the ship is surrounded,"Touring the ship as it was complete with passengers in different nooks and crannies was fantastic. First class definitely the place to be.Staff were all very welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable. Lots of sanitizer and very clean loos"
271,Recommended for grandparents taking care of children over half term,"The re-creation of the world's first iron hulled ship is so rich in detail including some surprising ""easter eggs"" that you get a comprehensive picture of life back then and life on board. I don't like the cliche not to be missed but it really applies and the children can run all over the place (and get lost) and have fun as well as being amazed and learning some scientific / historical realities. From outside the ship to the horses in the hold and the amazing steam engine with a massive chain drive and all the usual resources and a genuinely fascinating shop this had got to be Bristol's #1 attraction."
272,Bristol's Brunnel's SS Great Britain ship was excellent,Extensive information about the SS Great Britain in the museum before completing both tour of the dock bottom and onboard the ship. Ticket providers annual membership
273,Engineering is fabby ,"Arrived at our pre-booked time and were promptly issued our tickets for entry to Brunel‚Äôs SS Great Britain. Learning about the history of the ship and Brunel was incredibly interesting and interactive with its immersive design. There was a lot of information and history to learn and was done in a way to keep all ages engaged. All staff were friendly and helpful, adhering to Covid-19 regulations including a one-way system around the ship. I thought it was also a nice touch that purchased tickets are valid for a year so can be used on return to Bristol."
274,Great day out. ,"Well worth a visit, I‚Äôd recommend it.  Staff knowledgeable and polite.  Interesting history.  I certainly wouldn‚Äôt like to have travelled steerage!!!!"
275,Absolutely brilliant,"An amazing, moving experience, not just the history of this majestic vessel but the experience of what it must have been like to sail with her.  And excellent, helpful staff."
276,Great visit,¬£18 per person? Interesting but not worth that amount of money....the area is getting very shabby with lots of litter in the harbour area....
277,"Fascinating, evocative and informative experience .","SS Greta Britain is the must-see thing to do in Bristol, stunning piece of history, well preserved an amazing amount of access below, on top and inside the great ship."
278,Well worth a visit,Really interesting. Adults enjoyed the ship's kitchen and accommodation and children enjoyed scrubbing the decks
279,Very interesting ,The SS Great Britain is a must see if you‚Äôre in Bristol. The ticket gives you entry for up to a year and is really good value given how much there is in the museum. It‚Äôs been made suitably interactive and the ship itself is so incredibly put together given that she was a coal hulk until she was brought back to the UK. A great museum and will definitely be back.
280,Good story telling,An astonishing story of an astonishing man and part of britain's history told by entusiastic and knowledgable people. The guides help bring history to life and do so with a real passion. something for everyone here.
281,A fabulous trip,"A must see when in Bristol. Didn‚Äôt know what to expect and thought ¬£17 per adult might be poor value. But no, it was all fascinating and all very well done. Many different aspects, from underneath the rusting hull, to the exhibition area with artefacts, plans, videos, interactive stuff and loads of information. Then on to the deck, followed by 3 large floors below which are all kitted out with period decoration and scenes, showing the full range of life on the ship, as well as the massive engine (moving). We spent at least 2 hours despite not scrutinising every last detail and were fascinated throughout. Ad there is a free return within a year included."
282,Excellent attraction,"Paid online for entrance ticket, so got a little discount. Entrance ticket valid for further visits for another year. Doesn't seem like much from outside in terms of value for money, but there is so much to see when you actually get inside. The ship is really only the shell of the original, but they have tried to replicate the inside as much as possible and it is really good. Two external museums housed in building are really informative as well. It's fantastic to see so many helpers who want to help and give you the boats history, well done! Will be coming back if in the area again. Need at least 4 hours to just do the basics!"
283,Holed hull!,"The restoration is splendid in all areas - on and below decks, and down in the actual graving dock in which the SS Great Britain was built. (This dock was specially constructed for the purpose). The onshore exhibition is very enlightening and a must, prior to going on board. A visit is guaranteed to enthrall!"
284,Ss Great Britain,"SS Great Britain. a not to be missed experience. A lot to see, highlighting the engineering expertise of a great man, Isambard Kingdom Brunel."
285,First metAl ship ever,Is it ok to say it was so much better than the Cutty Sark?  It was so well done.  Loads to do... my dad who was 80 would have read every word and watched every film (but we only had 3 hours).  Our teenagers were happy throughout and looking round there was plenty to occupy the younger ones too.  Beautifully preserved and clearly loved and treasured by staff and volunteers.ALSO keep your entry ticket it‚Äôs valid for 12 months!!!
286,Great overview of SS Britain ,"Great Britain has been superbly restored, from the ""under water"" hull (as you tour the hull and propeller you look up at a glass roof/ceiling fixed at the water line), through the painstakingly finished cabins and common rooms, and up to the deck with its hinged masts.  You can climb the rigging, too: a group of kids were putting on climbing gear when we visited, and climbing up to the mainsail yard.The whole waterfront is a miracle of re-purposing, with splendid apartment buildings, museums, more ships (including the Matthew, a reconstructed 15th century caravel) and makes for a fascinating morning's walk.  Easily reached on foot from the are around the cathedral or the Marriot Royal hotel."
287,An incredible restoration and experience,Lovely full day 11am till 4.30 with breaks for food.Starts in the dry dock so you can see the hull.The ship interior is interesting..tiny cabins in all classes.The staff are amazing = Friendly and knowledgeable.
288,A great surprise,Well worth a visit especially the Brunel bit through past the ship to the right. The other boys looked a bit shabby and needing a lick of paint.
289,You could spend a week there,"If you are into Industrial history this is a must if you are in the area. At first the ticket price may seem quite expensive, but I had a good 2.5 - 3 hours visiting the site which consists not only of the S.S. Great Britain but a museum with lots of artifacts and history of the ship and a second museum dedicated to the life and works of I.K. Brunel.If you go around talk to the staff that are on board to find out more about this great vessel. It makes the day even more interesting. Great views from the deck up and down the river and across to Cabot's Tower. This ship had a fascinating operational life and a miraculous one to bring it home to Bristol. Well worth the visit and I'm told there are further developments for the site in the planning stages. I will be looking to go back again when these are completed."
290,Well worth a visit.,"This former passenger steamboat is now a museum on Bristol harbour and one of the city's top attractions. It is a very interesting visit, but a bit expensive."
291,Absolutely Amazing. A must visit.,"One of the best attractions in Bristol, restored to an exceptional level with attention to detail at the heart. a must go to for any visitors."
292,Great family day out,"That Brunel was getting through so many cigars a day by the time he died in 1859 is a good explanation for his premature death aged 53. This is just one of the incidental aspects of his life that comes out in a heritage site rich in detail and spectacle. The ship itself is quite something in size and opulence, even for contemporary visitors. Its rescue from the Falklands is a heroic tale well told. The astonishing recreation of fixtures and fittings from its period carrying emigrants to Australia (1852-75) is, if anything, more impressive. The colonial dimension of this activity is, however, largely unaddressed. Instead, the exhibition is very focused on this ship and Brunel‚Äôs other achievements as engineering feats. Nonetheless, there was surprisingly little attempt to explain the engineering, with even the bit on the superiority of propellers to paddles unduly convoluted. Personally I would have liked to have seen more about Brunel‚Äôs prefabricated hospital for the Crimea. That would have been a topical aspect of his career to highlight in these times of COVID-19. Otherwise there seemed to me a bit too much hagiography of Brunel (including a bizarre giant bust) and not enough contextualisation of his contributions to engineering and their significance today."
293,What a great surprise,"Pricey (¬£18 adult ticket), but well worth it provided you have at least 2 hours to really explore.  A walk round underneath to see how it is being preserved is essential and there are 2 museums - one about the vessel itself and one about Brunel and his life.  The highlight is exploring inside the vessel, cabins, galleys, etc.  Children would love this bit, but could get slightly bored with the 2 museums."
294,The ship that launched a 1000 cruise liners,"SS Great Britain tells great stories - of the trans-Altantic ship itself, of Isamburd Kingdom Brunel, and of his other engineering worksBrunel was inspired from success of others (in small scale). He derived new designs and incorporated them into the building of SS Great Britain. Two unprecedented designs were used(1) use iron instead of wood for the hull building. The change makes the ship lighter but stronger, hence burns less coal. It also opens up more space to carry more cargoes/passengers(2) change from paddle wheels to screw propellerThe museum tells about the constant struggle between investors and engineers' quest for trying out new designs. The evolution of design was fascinating"
295,Splendid Restoration that guarantees a wonderfully informative visit.,"The last time we saw the SS Great Britain was when she was a rusty hulk just returned from the Falkland Islands. What a difference! The restoration work is excellent. Going ""below"" water to see the original hull is amazing. All praise to the techniques they have used to preserve her. Touring the various levels of the ship afford a great insight into how the crew and the passengers, rich and poor,lived.  Do not miss the Brunel museum. His genius leaps out at you. Avoid the easy exit and visit his ""brain"" ... you won't be disappointed!An excellent day out ... we need to go again as there was so much to learn!"
296,"Not cheap, but fascinating, and ticket good for multiple re-entries for a year.",The cost to enter is ¬£18 for an adult but this allows access for a full year which is not much use if you are a tourist making a one off visit. From the outside the attraction is deceptive as there is plenty to do and keep you occupied and interested and its probably worth spending a few hours looking around
297,Interesting way to spend 2 hours,"I don't go in for bungey jumping or paragliding. I like history and pottering around and spent best part of a day getting to know this iconic ship. As part of a visit to Bristol this is an absolute must. Educational, but not too much, but restored in a way to illustrate how folk travelled back in the day. Volunteers were informative and clearly enjoy what they do. The visitor shop was good value for money and not filled with the usual tat."
298,Wonderful piece of history in a great setting,"Isambard Kingdom Brunel‚Äôs first of a kind steel hulled steam ship, restored and presented in a educational and sensitive way. IKB built the railway from London to Bristol, and during a lunch with local dignitaries who were complaining about the length of the railway line, made the throwaway comment that maybe the line should be extended through Bristol to New York. An investor encouraged him to formulate what wasn‚Äôt a serious idea at the time and this shop is the first of a couple that were built to sail to New York."
299,Another place ticked off the bucket list,This is the fiftieth year of the ship`s return to it`s home dock. From a complete wreck to today`s magnificent renovation and historically accurate internal fittings it is a triumph. And unique in the world. It is very atmospheric inside and gives the observer much food for thought as to the hardships experienced by those who worked aboard.  Even the first class passengers` lifestyle was not that comfortable. It is incredible how much was fitted in to the ship`s proportions including livestock( farm animals ). The Brunel museum is excellent and again is very extensive having many unique and original artifacts. It even has part of a Great Eastern funnel which I saw some years ago at Sutton Poynz water pumping station. Altogether a grand day out. There is a cafe adjoining the museum.
