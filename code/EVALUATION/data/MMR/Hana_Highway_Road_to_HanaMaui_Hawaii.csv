0,Great drive to Hana,"Great drive.  Plan to get started early in the day.  Bring snacks and drinks and a camera.  Lots to see.  The County Road Side Rest Stops are a good bet if you need to stretch your legs or use the rest room.  Water falls, places to take a swim, great views, and some crazy blind curves (I was driving and it was a bit scary at times).  Well worth the drive."
1,Beautiful Scenery,Wonderful drive with many wonderful hikes and sites. Fill your tank with gas and take a waterbottle. Many advise you to pack a lunch......I would advise you to take some snacks but there are some incredible places for for local food!Recommend the GyPSy guide to Hana app for narration!!!
2,"Do NOT drive this yourself, go with a guide.  An absolute must do","What a chance of a lifetime. Empty roads, incredible  hiking, and nature above all expectations. Get up early and enjoy this beautiful and sometimes hair-raising drive through the most spectacular country without traffic. Don’t miss road to Hanna!"
3,So many places to explore...,A must trip. Not fast but extraordinary.  Special views of the coast and lava shores. Because you are so closen you are part of the waves.
4,Love the staff! We enjoyed our visit,"Drove from Wailea to Hana for a day trip...good views of whales and surfers. Cute little town with in shops, restaurants and bars. All in all worth the trip!"
5,"Road to Hana - ""Shaka Guide"" app",A wonderful drive around the Central to far Eastern side of Maui. Set aside 6-7 hours with only a few stops. If you like hiking and exploring +2 hours. Plenty of picturesque waterfalls roadside. Don’t be intimidated by the “1 lane bridges” there is a flow and etiquette that is easy. Note how the environment changes from near desert to lush tropical due to the effect of Haleakala
6,Day Trip!,"Nice drive. You have to dedicate all day for this trip. You have to start pretty early in the morning like 8am or before. We picked Shaka App that you can download for iPhone(o Android). This is $12 or $10 depending on type of route you are taking. We took the full loop (alternate is you go to hana and come back to airport type). Gives you all the narrative and with location enabled, it tells you where to stop and brief description. Plays some Hawaiian music on the way. There are number of waterfalls on the way. Pick and choose. You do not need to stop at all the places. There is Bamboo trails. Big banyan tree under a small cave hole, But the beauty was the Waianapana state park. Do not miss this. Very scenic. Keep food handy. There are few food trucks on the way and very few restaurants before you touch Hana. At Hana we ordered food in food truck. Took us a good hour before we left. There is Black Sand beach and Red sand beach on the way. They are good places to stop.  If you take full tour around  - There is a small segment which is unpaved road. It says rental cars are not covered. This means if you get into an accident, insurance is not covered and you may end up paying for all the cost. Beware of that. In all it is an excellent trip and day worth spent"
7,Pretty Drive but not Much to Do/See,"Breathtaking!Left early a.m.,12 hr tour, so worth the time. Wouldn't drive,book tour.Much to see & do!"
8,Wicked Scenic Drive,"Such a beautiful day. Make sure you down load Shaka tours before you go. It is a app that will guide you along your journey to Hana with great places to stop and hike, swim, eat and helps monitor your time which is important on the highway. It is windy but well worth it!"
9,Road to Hana Tour with Valley Isle Excursions,"Had an amazing Hana adventure. Beautiful waterfalls, awesome scenery. The black sand beach and blow hole are spectacular."
10,Best turtle experience,"Start at 10 AM or before. Listen to the APP that uses GPS to guide you. Stop at every waterfall and botanical garden. Enjoy great food along the roadside and the sleepy village of Hana. End up at the Sacred Pools by 4 and then take a direct, but curvy, road back so you're out of the beauty by dark."
11,Over 600 hairpin turns and breathtaking views,Expected to see more when we reached Hana. Like a beach or some shops. Scenery and waterfalls were beautiful but took to much time to really see anything special.
12,Beautiful drive,Be patient... it's worth doing once.  Drop dead gorgeous views and gives you the feeling of old Hawaii... impatient locals--they are easy to spot and let them go by...  take your time and you'll have a great story when you're done !
13,Twist and Turns,We rented a car and down loaded an app that told us where to go and stop. Lots of road construction so made it very scary. The locals drive crazy so had to be careful. If you get motion sick not the trip for you. Hair pin turns and steep sides are not for the queasy.
14,Vistas and Views Second to None,"Wow. Adventure is the word for this road. Curves and more curves, great sights and food, a great full day adventure."
15,Lots to see and do on the Road to Hana,"The road to Hana is one of my favorite things to do in Maui. Plan to spend the whole day taking this drive back and forth. If you can rent a convertible or Jeep definitely do as the fresh air along the drive is magical. You get to experience all kinds of micro climates along the drive. We used the Gypsy app as our tour guide and it was incredibly helpful for all parts of the trip. The enchanted gardens is a bit overrated but DO Wailua Falls which is a bit beyond Hana but so so beautiful!! The Oheo Gulch is fine but you have to pay the entry fee of around $25 as its part of the Haleakala National Park. The pools are closed off from public use. I love driving so this was a blast for me but there are a lot of narrow passes and prepare to stop and let other drivers pass on the other side of the road. As they say, enjoy the journey not the destination."
16,Long trip with many scenic views,"620 curves, 59 bridges are already amazing and if you want to stop on some waterfalls try it during Monday to Wednesday as the other days the road and parking lots are full. I drove it once completely around and this time until to the Pipiwai Trail and we drove back by night with nearly no gas left. We made it home but if you are nearly without gas, just use the petrol station in Hana early cause they close early soon. The roadtrip is an adventure but a good one."
17,Before they closed it,"Beautiful scenery- waterfalls,  beaches, small towns but a long, long day.  Took excursion with informative, nice driver.  Difficult if you don’t have good mobility.  Watered to swim in waterfall pools but not recommended that day due to water conditions.  Glad I went but will not repeat due to total time spent."
18,Don't waste your time here,It's the journey not the destination kind of drive. Download on of the app guides and take it slow. Plenty to see and do as you drive the Road to Hana. Lots of waterfalls to see on the drive and a black sand beach which can't be missed. There are several roadside stands to try and don't forget to go pass Hana to Kipahulu to see the bamboo forest and the Oheo pools.
19,Road to Hana,"Beautiful windy drive with constant waterfalls and lush forests! So many stops to make along the way, so don't be in a hurry. This road gets very crowded with tourists so go early and even better to spend a night or two in Hana. Don't miss out of the Pipiwai Trail to Waimolou Falls, past Hana, it is worth it!"
20,Fun Experience,"Start your day early. My husband and I hit the road at 6 am, had water, snacks, and a full tank of gas. You can do one of the prepaid tours but I think it's better if you have your own rental. There are so many nice places to stop by and see and it's best to go at your own pace. I highly suggest to rent a jeep. The roads are rough on some parts. This is an all day thing. Involves as much activity as you want because you stop where you want to. Again, only if you do it at your pace. If you do the group outing to Hana you are on their schedule."
21,"Really, Be Careful If You're Sensitive to Motion",Booked this tour as a relaxing way to do the road to Hana. Travis was our guide and was a great driver and commentator. He even sang and played the ukulele at the church. This is an excellent way to see a lot and leave the driving to someone else.Breakfast was a little sparse but the lunch was very good. Highly recommended.
22,Fantastic experience,"Go early, to avoid traffic. Take your time as there are lots of corners and curves!! Also, it is important to note that many of the so called ""attractions and hikes"" while they may be seen as an interesting place to visit or hike to are actually on private property and should be respected as such."
23,Beautiful scenic veiws,"Went to Hana and had a lovely drive. The road is windy but folks are really good about watching who is coming and who is going by. No silly driving, just a lot of winds and oh the beautiful waterfalls. We were there durning the RAINY part of the day, the next day they had flash floods. I have never seen it rain so hard, and the waves at the Taro turnout were so spectacular and awe inspiring. Trip just took us to Hana Town as the weather was not good enough for us to try the hike to the pools, but it was well worth going to see the beauty of the area."
24,Scenic Road to Hana and Pipiwai Falls hole! Breathtaking!!,"Great drive for those who Enjoy endless driving challenges and lush, jungle scenery with occ. waterfalls and peaks at ocean.  Take a Full day, turn your watch/clock off, b/c you can't do anything about it as the road and traffic determine the pace.  Very enjoyable for those of us liking such things:  be ready to stop on a dime, pullover, occasionally back up to let someone through tight spots, etc.BUT:  Fear of Heights?...Don't go!  Fear of drop-offs without guardrails?  Don't go.  Can't back up easily in narrow place without guardrails and major dropoffs without a road shoulder?  Don't go.  ANYone prone to being even a Little Car Sick in your car?  Don't go, b/c guaranteed you/they will be!  Not even in a tour vehicle.  Back to all others, go in a heart beat!!We advise it's best to bring snacks or picnic food and sodas, although there are a fair number of snack shacks along the way.  Also bring swimiming suits and towels, so you have the option of dipping in a pool of water below a waterfall, especially if you have never done that in your life."
25,Hana Highway a must do on Maui!,"Don't do a purchased tour...rent a car, Jeep or convertible and enjoy the ride and sights.  Allow plenty of time to stop and enjoy along the way.  First time we did this was 3 1/2 years ago stopped at the black sand beach at Waianapanapa State Park then turned back.  This time we stayed overnight in Hana then ventured all the way around.  While there are great sites just past Hana and in Haleakala National Park there isn't any need to stay in Hana or go all the way around.  If/when I do this again I'd get an early start and turn back after Ohe'o Gulch.  Try to do everything during daylight as the drive is adventurous."
26,All Day Adventure,"Great scenic road Trip,  don’t rush it just enjoy. Lots of waterfalls and natural pools on the way to Hana.... short exploration hikes are fun,  the views are incredible.   It just takes a lot of time to drive but worth it."
27,A must for sure!,"Beautiful , winding, narrow roads Very Beautiful, water falls , scenic views, trails.Don't forget to explore the bays and scenic lookouts.Fill up on Gas before you leave ! Gas in Hana is 25 % HIGHER price and there are no gas stations until you get there.Worth the drive"
28,Amazing,The road to Hana is definitely an interesting ride. It will bring you through a lot to twist and turns. Plan on a full day if you aren’t staying in Hana for the  night. Take it easy and enjoy the drive. Do be careful as some locals like to fly around corners. There are great places along the way to see waterfalls and the garden of Eden. Don’t miss the roadside food too!
29,coolest experience!!,"Road is very twisting and narrow, but the road itself is well paved. No need to go on a tour, just take your rental car and download the Gypsy app."
30,Hana Hawaii,"Its about the journey, more than the destination itself. A must do when in Maui. Enjoy all the stops you take in between. Be respectful to the other drivers on the road, and drive within speed limits and you should be fine on the road. My personal favorites were Waianapapa State Park, Pipiwai trail and Aunty Sandy's banana bread."
31,Must do once,This is a beautiful day trip to Hana. Remember to bring your camera! So many photo opportunities along the way.
32,Go early and  enjoy,"Ok so you read lots but we just did this: first download the app for a virtual tour “Shaka guide”.   For $16.99 it narrated there and back with precision. If it says to skip something, do it.   The driving is intense.  If you are a bad drive, take a tour.  It is stressful. Leave by 0730. There are lots of food options you dont need to pack a lunch. GreAt fruit stands along the way.  Best tropical fruit I’ve ever enjoyed.  Honour system is how you pay.  Bring towels and gravol and shoes if you are unsteady.   Black sand beach can be dicey.  We spent the most time there.  Truly stunning views. Pink sand beach was disappointing but take 5 min to say you’ve been.  All the waterfalls were nice.  We were going to go to the 7 pools but no one mentioned to bring our receipt from when we went to see the Haleakala crater which was $30.  That payment would get us in within 3 days to see the pools with no charge. FYI you cannot swim in the pools.   Return before dark, let the locals pass they drive a whole lot faster   All in all a 10 hour day."
33,Great drive to Hana,"It is a crazy windy road that people speed around one lane turns on! But, you get to see and swim in beautiful waterfalls. Also, don’t stop at the seven pools. It was a huge waste of time..."
34,"Fantastic drive, take your time.","This is a beautiful trip that gives you a different perspective on Maui, especially if you are staying in West or South Maui. It is a drive that can be a bit daunting, especially if you continue around past Hana, as we did in September. My wife wanted to see Charles Lindbergh's grave which is located behind a modest church approximately 10 miles past Hana on the way to the south coast road. This is a quite difficult and narrow road that many hire car companies do not want you to negotiate for this reason. If you wish to go to Lindbergh's grave it is extremely easy to miss as it has absolutely no signage indicating where it is. There is a car entrance into Haleakala National Park that you pass, it is about 1/2 mile past that on the left. A nondescript dirt road takes you to a plain white building (the church) it is just behind that building in a small cemetery there. There is a very small park closer to the water with picnic tables that makes a charming spot for lunch. Still, a great drive."
35,Road to Hana Well Worth It,"Don’t listen to all the reviews about the driving. If you can make it through McDonald’s drive-through you can turn a corner on a winding highway, it’s not that dramatic.  Yes you need to slow down to about 10mph around some tight turns. Yes there’s like 60 one lane bridges. But so what if there’s a car on the other side one person goes first and then the other.  Average speed is probably like 30mph.  BUT it is NOT about getting to Hana!!!  The trip is all about the journey NOT the destination!!!I would definitely recommend paying $12 for this app “Shaka Maui” it has a self-guided tour and recommend places to stop and trails to do along the way. You must download it before you go because there is no cell service for most of the way.  The app does work the whole time because it plays off of your GPS location. It does help to keep the trip interesting because it has nearly constant narration of history and facts about Hawaii. The highlight of the journey is actually at near the end that the app guides you to see a red sand beach.  Do it! But be safe and don’t die."
36,Rainy Road to Hana,"A bumpy road with amazing view along the way. There are several stops where you can see waterfalls, big waves, breathtaking views and scary cliffs. A great experience."
37,This is one for the books,"Waste of time, to see a small water fall on route and not much in Hana. Takes one way about 3 hours. You are averaging about 15 to 25 miles per hour. You need to cross over 50 small single lane bridges. A thousand hair pin turns and constant winding road. Drive mostly via a dense forest."
38,Road to Hana,"We rented our own car and drove the road to Hana. You can tune your radio station to listen to a tour if you start at the proper time. Unfortunately there is NO CELL PHONE SERVICE most of the trip. This gave me anxiety just because of the winding narrow road we travelled. Do not stop at every stop or you will not make it to every attraction before the sun goes down. We loved the botanical gardens, red sand beach, black sand beach, and the large waterfalls. After we reached the tide pools, we hike up the mountain and by the time we got back down it was pitch black. So just be careful to manage you time. The drive home in the dark is a little terrifying, especially with no cell service! This is an all day awesome fun tour filled with beautiful views and adventure! Also it’s free !"
39,Drive It!,"So many things to see and do on the road to Hāna. No way to do it all in one day. We made many stops at waterfalls, lookout points, lava cave, black sand beach, red sand beach and parks. Amazing. Hikes were great.  Some longer than others. Picnic lunch. We used the Shaka app with classic Hana tour  valuable information - worth the cost."
40,Well worth the trip,"The Road to Hana is only for good drivers.  Lots of sharp turns (like 620) and one lane bridges.  Occasionally, a giant truck will blow by in the opposite direction.  Plan your stops ahead of time as it is easy to miss.  Beautiful scenery along the way but “attractions” require you to park and hike.  And unfortunately, you will have to take the same road back to get home, so don’t leave late because you do not want to be on the road in the dark."
41,Road to Hana,Phenomenal.  Our tour guide Austin was the best.  No need to drive it yourself.  Use this service.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!
42,HOLY CRAP!,"Awesome day with surprises around every bend! Hubby did an awesome job driving and stopping along the way. We used the Shaka Maui app that was cheap and extremely helpful. It took us 12 hours from starting at our condo in Kihei to our return. We were not hurried,stopped at beaches to swim, ate lunch in Hana (food trucks were fairly good, originally stopped at a restaurant that looked overpriced and the table next to us said the food wasn’t that good so we left). Wouldn’t want to do it without that app though!"
43,Greatest adventure ever ,"We took our drive Christmas Eve. My recommendation before starting out is plan your stops accordingly and your vehicle. We opted out of the tour excursions and drove ourselves. Get a convertible if possible. We rented a small VW Beetle Convertible turbo for the week which made the experience like nothing else. There's nothing like driving along the coast and the jungle with the top down. We arrived in Paia around 7am and had a nice breakfast at a small coffee place called Paia Bay Coffee Bar, very chill and relax vibe. We got the everything egg, cheese bacon, avocado bagel. Super good and the fresh orange juice. A great jumpstart to the upcoming drive. As we drove, we passed the first few recommended stops such as mile 2 Twin Falls. Even that early their were already a line of cars. Our first stop was Garden of Eden at mile marker 10. It was a nice stop, had a handful of lookouts and beautiful scenery and gardens. We spent aprrox 30 minutes here. Our next stop was at Mile marker 22 Puaa Ka Wayside. There werent very many cars here so the quick hike to the pool and waterfall was nice and easy. We then stopped at mile maker 29 the marketplace. It was a good place to stretch our legs and grab some fresh fruit smoothies as well as some banana bread. From the market place to Hana was about another 15 min drive where we stopped in Hana where if you follow the signs to the beach they have a black sand beach which was pretty cool. We then made our way to Haleakala National Park which was a little after 11am when we arrived. Had a quick lunch with some sandwiches we packed and the banana bread we purchased earlier. We then made our way on the Pipiwai Trail to Waimoku Falls. My wife is not a hiker and wanted to turn back numerous times, but the hike to the falls was well worth it. there was a warning sign at the falls, but use your best judgement. Lets just say we got some incredible pictures right underneath the falls. Awesome and amazing. By the time we made it back to the parking lot it was only a little after 3pm and as we were leaving a lot of tour buses were on their way in. So we beat that crowd. On our way back we stopped at a cute little restaurant/stand by mile marker 32 or 31, called Hana Farms. This was the perfect spot to stop and grab a late lunch. The tacos were on point, the banana bread was super moist and delish. Make sure to grab some for the road. We then made our stops at the different other falls such as Upper Waikani falls - marker 19 and our last stop was at Twin falls, marker 2. There were only 2 other cars there, so it was nice by ourselves. Total trip from Paia back to Paia was about 10 hrs. We were always ahead of the large crowds it seemed so we had a lot of the smaller stops to ourselves. So it was definitely worth it. If you are going to Maui, this is a must, but be prepared to spend a whole day on this trip."
44,SUPERB!,"I used the Shaka Guide app interactive and narrated. We rented a Jeep and drove the entire road around, skinny and a slow go but lots of fun. Black Sand and Red Sand beach where the highlights for us. We where on the road for 10 hrs and stopped at 10 sites along the way so start early AM. Have fun"
45,Beautiful ride - all day event!,"Not for the faint of heart or those afraid of heights! Our driver was very knowledgeable and entertaining, we made many local stops along the way which introduced us to families who make a living selling jewelry, honey, flowers and refreshments.  I would never go to Maui and miss this Road to Hana.  It is one for the memory books."
46,Beautiful,It was really nice drive. Only advice i can give is to stay overnight in hana because too many places to see on the way and the whole time we have to think about getting back before dark.
47,Was on my bucket list,"We got the shaka app and downloaded it at home before the trip. It was seriously a monsoon for that day and 2 days before. We were told not to go but we were headed west so we wanted to do it while we were in the area. The sun set at 6:00 pm and we didn't leave until 10:00am because we were not sure what to do with the weather. We were laughing because the guide kept saying do not stop here, there are better things coming. WE should have listened. We knew we would have to drive back in the dark for about 1 hour. It had rained so hard the falls were mud falls and the 7 sacred pool was one big blob of brown. We however thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We ran into a couple who was 21 years old and they asked if they could follow us because we had the app. It stopped raining almost every time we got out of the car. My favorite spot was the cave. if you go in walk until you see heaven. It literally opens up into a green garden. the bamboo forest was a long walk and it was the end of our journey and we had on water shoes so we didn't walk more than 1 mile. It was also gonna get dark. I am from Upstate NY where we have a lot of curvy roads. I did not think the roads were a big deal in the daylight. It was raining faster than my wipers could keep up on the way back, it was dark, trees fell in the road and there was so much water on the bridge i wasn't sure it was 1 piece. I was happy to be on the road with our new young friends. ( I am 56) and i am sure we gave them comfort. Although the weather was crazy and i would have loved to see it in the blue skies i found the app amazing, we even listened to his story on the way back. unless you are from a flat state I think the drive is do able  but get the shaka app"
48,Beautiful!,"Great experience and excellent driver/guide.  This 12 hour trip has beautiful waterfalls, beaches and treacherous curves, one lane bridges and bumpy roads.  Much more enjoyable if your not terrified of going off a cliff.Nathan was our guide and so knowledgeable and funny and professional."
49,Will test a marriage,"Rained a little the day before and clear the day we drove so we were blessed with majestic waterfalls. The app my son downloaded was the best local guide. We stopped at multiple waterfalls and waded in them. Take bathing suits, towels and a pair of old walking shoes. Also start super early like 5am! Or book a night's stay in Hana, it's TOTALLY worth it!  Take snacks but also stop to eat at the vegan icecream stand because that coconut milk icecream is soooooo good. Finally stop at the roadside food stands a little before you get to Hana. Don't forget to take dramamine if you get carsick/seasick. Oh and don't forget to just put your phones/cameras down and take in the moments."
50,Fantastic Adventure,"Went to visit for the first time. The locals have an attitude that tourists should not visit. Definitely an eye opening experience. The economy depends on tourism yet the residents want to pick and choose where they feel tourists shouldn't be able to visit. If you're spending money in bars and restaurants, its all good. If you're travelling the road to Hana, it's a whole different story. Florida native here and we don't descrimate against people visiting the beaches from other places."
51,Must do when in Maui,This every bit width the trip.Car or bus..Polynesian tours are great  You travel in a very comfortable bus not more then 12 passengers Dont expect a great lunch..take your own as lunch is prepared by this restaurant..not much really.Every bit enjoyable.Worth the trip..
52,Long Road to Hana,"We took the road to Hana tour through pride of Maui tour company. Expectation was for a long dsy. The day started off just as planned with Lenny picking us up right on time Lenny had do many stories and knew the road very well.  Breakfast and snacks were good. For lunch we stopped at a local food truck near Hana and had some of the best BBQ ribs I have ever had.This was the Maui I was expecting to see. Waterfalls, beautiful lush forests, wild grapefruit, avacado and banana trees and rainbows galore. Black sand beaches, blow holes and narrow roads.  So worth it!"
53,Scenic drive,"This drive is very beautiful, even with the tight curves and traffic. Prepare to take a long time but it is so worth the ride. Stop along the way to enjoy the different sights."
54,We loved this! Great views! Lots of waterfalls!,"Get the Gypsy app. driving tour guide ($10) before you decide to take the 52 mile road to Hana. It's a complete description mile by mile of what the Road to Hana has to offer. After you get the app. read through your rental agreement because some parts of the road are not covered by most rental agreement. I suggest you rent a small car because the road gets narrow with blind spots, hair pin turns, one car bridges and no guard rail cliff driving. Narrow roads and tour buses don't mix, somebodys  going to have to back up. Make sure you use your horn on blind spots around rock walls. Fill your vehicle with gas, it's a 12 hour ride going out to Hana and back to Wailea. Along the way you'll see Wailua Falls, the Enchanted Gardens, Seven Sacred Pools and  Wai'anapanapa black sand beach to name a few highlights. Seeing the Seven Sacred Pools will cost you $25 dollars because it is part of Haleakala National Park. There is no fee to travel on the Road to Hana. Ohea Gukch is also part of Haleakala National Park and thus the $25 fee. Places to eat include: Coconut Glen's or any number of food stands along the way. Make sure you carry cash. There are numerous water falls, hiking trails and lookouts. Make sure that when you stop you get your vehicle completely off the road. I experienced a lot of road rage, tailgating, and honking. A last tip would be to carry a paper map or make sure your vehicle has a GPS system. Cell phone reception is unreliable and in places non-existent. Your reward will be incredible views, photo opportunities if the weather permits, and an up close experience with the fauna and flora of Maui."
55,Beautiful but dangerous,"This is a great way to view scenery along the coast, see waterfalls and wonder how people drive this road of many bends. Remember it goes to Hana and then you have to come back the same way. It will take you all day, but is worth it."
56,"It's about the journey, not the destination!","Fantastic drive, take your time. Hana itself not too exciting. Charles Lindbergs grave difficult to find but well there, a beautiful and peaceful place. Dont start your return too late, you dont want to be on the road when it is dark."
57,We love the Road to Hana!,Lovely scenery but if you only have a few days in Maui then don't spend an entire day driving the Road to Hana. If you have a week in Maui then 1 day would be worth it. The drive as many state is precarious. Take rest stops often and pay attention to the road.
58,great drive with beautiful sights,"Road to Hana is a great way to see another part of the island, less commercial. Beautiful scenery, curvy roads with all sorts of landscapes!"
59,Day trip to Hana,This is an awesome drive. But leave yourself lots of time no matter what you are into. Stopping at every waterfall. Hitting beaches. Stopping at fruit stands. Hiking. It all takes time and the road is windy and slow. Worth it if you like to drive.
60,Very interesting drive.,This scenic drive should really be among the 10 natural wonders of the world. Be prepared to spend the entire day on this road trip. Stop at one of the beautiful isolated beaches in Hana.An absolutely spectacular outing!
61,Stunning views,"We rented a car and took the family. Shocked no one got car sick from the windy roads, but then we had on ear patches from our cruise! There were several waterfalls to view and lots of  lush vegetation. We made it about halfway to Hana, but what we saw didn’t compare to the views on the NW side, which was also easier driving. Pull over to let the locals pass...Hana means Work...they’re on the road to work!"
62,Fun day of driving & sites,Absolutely beautiful! the Banana bread is too die for! Love the nature views and the waterfalls as well.
63,Mahalo Tours was amazing ,"We got up early from Kaanapali to hit the Hana Hwy.  We downloaded the Shaka Guide to assist us on the drive (super worth the 12 bucks!) and headed out.  One of the best stops was a hidden waterfall trail (~2 mile hike) along the route that we would have missed without the guide.  You must stop at the fruit stands, Ke'anae peninsula, and Wai'anapanapa state park to see the black sand beaches and lava tubes.  Drive cautiously and be courteous to the locals and you'll be just fine, the roads aren't as bad and windy as others make it out to be.  Start early so you can see as much as you can, even with a 7am start, we didn't get to stop at every stop.  The Waimoku falls at the end of the bamboo forest in the Pipiwai trail at Haleakala Nat'l Park is absolutely worth it.  Don't miss it."
64,Winding and Wandering,"It will take you a whole day but it’s so worth the drive. Have your best driver be the driver as some parts are a bit scary. Only 52 miles but so many places to stop along the way.y recommendation would be drive to the park, do the hike to bamboo forest and onto the waterfall and on your way back do your stops. You don’t want to have to start for home in the dark. We were told that but did some stops along the way and it was dark about 1/2 way home and is scarier. Local drivers are impatient and we pulled over whenever we could to let them by. We did miss the turn off to black beach and said we would stop on the way back but it was closed by then."
65,Road with a View,The twist and turns on narrow a narrow road makes this a ideal small bus tour experience.  Breathtaking views!
66,First Time in Maui,Be sure to download a map offline before traveling!  There is no internet out that far -only some of the best views in the world. Pick a place to stop and turn around before going also - or you can drive for hours and hours.
67,Great scenery,"Our fifth trip to Hana, first for friends travelling with us & they're still raving about the waterfalls, narrow roads. We let (forced) our friend to drive, which resulted in him buying a ""I survived the road to Hana"" shirt.  Wanted to continue on to Volcanos Nat'l Park, but it was getting late.  A must for visitors!"
68,Car sick,"It was a must see for us.. however be prepared for the most stressful day in Hawaii..the road is narrow with 620 turns some very tight hairpin turns! Lots of one lane bridges and lots of cars and trucks! Beautiful views and stops along the way. We used the gypsy app for the trip to narrate and suggested places to stop. I would highly recommend it! Not much to do once you arrive but as the narrator said.. it's the journey, not the destination!"
69,Road to Hana will not disappoint,"Be prepared for LOTS of twists and turns, one lane bridges, blind turns, and BEAUTIFUL views including waterfalls. Once in Hana go a little further and check our Red beach and don’t forget the Hana Bay. We had a great lunch at the Hana Ranch. ."
70,Watch out for the crazy locals. Can be A scary drive. ,It’s worth doing at least once easier if you just make the whole trip around versus trying to come back because of the amount of traffic and congestion on the single lane one car areas like bridges.  Word of advice watch out for the locals they drive aggressively and do not appreciate congestion at stop points as it slows their ability to get through and around on that roadway.   For the younger people it’s fun climbing down and going to the waterfalls and swimming in them there are a couple easy to get to before you get to mile 20 even. Beautiful scenery spectacular views but the drive can be a little daunting
71,The infamous Road to Hana,"The Road to Hana is a wonderful drive! You should allow an entire day if you are the type to stop and take pictures often. The road is very narrow in places and it can be difficult to find a place to park alongside the roadway. Drive slowly. Stop and visit the little towns. Go past Hana to see another version of Haleakala National Park. It's a beautiful Valley that goes into the ocean. A couple of walking trails are there too.  It is a trip very much worth taking!  Caution though, kids might get bored easily on this drive, so take snacks or a picnic lunch!"
72,"Beautiful , winding, narrow roads",Hired hike maui to take us to hana and back. They drove the complete loop around the volcano. What a ride. Great sights.Highly recommended.
73,"If you love to drive, this trip is for you",A very winding road!  Lots of nice views.  Garden of Eden was beautiful.   BBQ next door was the best!  You got to try it!
74,sensational scenery,"Great way to get a real experience of Maui. The scenery was breathtaking, lots of waterfalls (although a bit too cool to swim in so we didn't stop). Would highly recommend downloading the GyPSy app, really helpful and informative and loved learning more on the history of Hawaii on the return journey. Heading down to the Ke'anae Peninsula is worth a stop off, especially for the banana bread from Aunty Sandy's! I was expecting the roads to be a lot more difficult to drive than they were, just busy. I dread to think what it would be like over a holiday so make sure you leave very early!"
75,Long and winding road,"A white knuckle drive to incredibly beautiful beaches, waterfalls, lava tubes and rainforest countryside."
76,"Wow wow wow!!! Gorgeous drive, but slightly terrifying!","Rent a Jeep for this 100%. Def might die but totally worth it. If you continue through rather than turn around at Hana you get a true driving adventure - but need the Jeep for this and make sure to ASK the locals in Hana if it’s a good idea, as the road is not always open. Great stop along the way where there is some sort of bird sanctuary - we didn’t pay to go into the sanctuary but instead ate coconut ice cream and fed the peacocks that live by the ice cream truck. If you go all the way, start early and plan on it taking the whole day."
77,Most Beautiful Road in America,"We took a very nice day to go to Hana. I would strongly recommend getting the app that gives you the history of Hawaii and tells you all the great places to stop. We started out a little late, I would recommend that you start at eight or nine in the morning so that you can stop and do some of the longer hikes bike down to Jawz the surfing area. The waterfalls are great. The food at the little stop prior to hanna was very good. The garden of eden was worth the stop. We really enjoyed the whole process."
78,C Fruhwald ,Rated one of the top roads to tour for a reason. Around almost every turn there is something awesome to see and experience. Well worth seeing. Would highly suggest doing a tour rather than driving yourself. It would make it much more enjoyable.
79,Trip to Hana,Lots of turns in the road.Lots of small width road. The scenery is amazing and the small towns are great to visit. It will take a full day to travel this road. Remember to bring a towel.
80,No sites like this. Beautiful,"Firstly, you do not need a tour. Download one of the Apps and they can guide you to the stops along the way. It's very windy so I recommend that if you're not the driver, take Dramamine. You can do the drive with a regular car but by the time you get to the Pools at Ohe'o, about 15 miles of road are unpaved and very narrow. We did it from the other side towards Hana and did not encounter a lot of cars at all until we got near the park. There are areas where you're just 6 inches from the edge with no railing. So if you're a nervous driver, I would not recommend going past the Pools at Ohe'o"
81,I though Arkansas had curvy roads...,We rented a car from OGG after debarking our NCL cruise. We had all day plans to make many stops along the road to Hana and packed our backpacks to prepare for the day. Our first stop... twin falls. We took our phone wallets etc and left two small packs on the floor of our car. We weren’t gone more than 30 mins as the trail is very short. We returned to our window smashed out and our packs stolen. Thankfully the most they got was beach gear and unfortunately our passports. Little trip will end up being quite costly. We decided to continue on after filing our police report. So it was quite beautiful but tainted. We researched this problem and apparently this is extremely common especially at twin falls! Skip it... and just so you know they steal from trunks too! Pretty sure they were tourist looking peeps. So you would never guess! Otherwise Maui is beautiful.
82,Go For It!,"I started well before sunrise and got back well after it got dark. There are many stops to take in. Lots of fruit stands and some great food. I would recommend not going with less than a full tank because gas stops are only in Hana (that I saw) and it was well over $5 there. Lots of turns, so drivers be aware of your passengers that get motion sickness"
83,It's a long drive but worth it!!,"Sure, reviews and guidebooks warn you. Sure, you take bonine/dramamine and do all the things you know you should do (look at the horizon, sit in the front seat, stay hydrated). So maybe you think it'll be worth it to see in real life the things you see in these amazing photos. And yet...this road knocked me flat. We took the unpaved road to Pipiwai and then had no choice but to continue on Hana Highway or turn back. So on we went...all 900 miles. At least that's how it felt! And the two times I had to throw up we weren't anywhere near a pull-out. It was misery. My friends say the banana bread was delicious. I'm sure it was. If you have someone in your party prone to motion sickness, leave them out of this one. If you're that person and you think you can handle it, I hope you do better than I did!"
84,Beautiful but LOOOONG!,"We only drove a short distance on the road to a great beach location to view green sea turtles. One heck of an experience to see them on the beach..Also just a great location to watch the surfers...Parking lot is busy but we managed to find a parking space. Like All of Maui, handicap parking does not exist. Only 2 spaces....Anyone visiting Maui should expect handicap parking to be few and far in between...Sorry I can't remember the beach name. But anyone who lives there will tell you. That is how we found out"
85,Such a picturesque road along the ocean coast.,"This road to Hana came highly recommended and a #1 must do when in Maui.  Having heard of a travel app that could be downloaded to your phone that would provide a guided tour, we bought the Gypsy Guide and let the narrator talk us through the trip, which was a really good decision.  If you start early, drive carefully, are courteous to other drivers on the road and stop at the things that interest you, you will have a great time!  There are lots of natural sights along the way that are worth pulling over to view.  Some short walks, but also some longer hikes as well.  Prepare by reading guide books so you can decide which stops you want to make and remember that this is a full day journey - don’t rush it.  Personally, I didn’t feel the last leg beyond Hana to ‘the seven sacred pools’ was worth the extra drive. However, the black sand beach partway through was a great stop and had we known how lovely we would have planned a longer stay to swim.  There were lots of people at this location, but it didn’t seem crowded and the water looked warm and clean.  There are quite a few stairs down to the small cove and a longer hike beyond if that appeals to you. This is a really great trip for anyone who likes challenging drives, beautiful scenery and so many shades of green. There are some kitschy touristy things here as well, but really something for everyone.  Bring lots of water, good shoes, some snacks, cash to buy things as most places do not take credit cards and your sense of adventure!"
86,Long Beautoful Road to Hana,"This is a bucket list trip, we left the daily rental at the condo and rented a 2019 mazda miata MX-5 sports car with a retractable hard top from TURO.This drive is a stressful drive going as the morning sun and dark shade on super narrow road was not an easy drive. We went back the same way but was now easily drivable as lighting conditions were way better and knowing what to expect helped a lot.Beach’s after Hana are the dream places you see in movies,Hawaiian  food was so good at Braddah hutts food truck, nothing fancy but dam good, located between Hana and Hamoa beach.Wish could of spent the night in this area."
87,Day trip,Very nice drive but very narrow and lots of loops so drivre  carefully. The road to hana is definitely about the journey and not the destination. Stop a lot and enjoy the view. Be very careful parking and crossing  roads specially for the teenagers on cell phones. Do not do what we did and leave early. We left at 9.30 from Kaanapali beach area so our drive back was pitch dark with 15 miles/ hour drive and lots of loops :)
88,Great ride and sights,"We spent two nights in Hana and it’s worth spending time in Hana rather than just driving the entire highway in one day.  There are a lot of sights, hikes, and fruit stands to take in during the journey there and back.  And remember to be patient, courteous, and yield to other drivers because there are many one lane sections, blind corners, steep grades, and limited visibility on the road.  Please pull over and let other cars pass if you are a slow driver.  It’s not about who gets there first, but who gets there safely.  We took the southern route to Hana from Lahaina and filled up our gas tank full at Costco in Kahului.  No gas stations on the Hana Highway.  The southern route had more sections that were not paved with pot holes.  Even though the maps indicate 4 WD vehicles only, we saw a lot of sedans and convertibles on the highway.  The southern route is much drier and flatter until close to Hana.  In the Hana area are several beaches - red  (Kaihalulu) and black sand beaches that deserve some time hiking to and exploring.  There is also a natural lava sea arch formation and a blow hole at Waianapanapa State Park.  There is limited food options in Hana such as food trucks but everything closed early by about 7 pm.  There are 2 markets that stay open later.  A must stop for lunch us the Hana Farms - great plate lunches and the store sells fruit, desserts,and the best banana bread on Maui.  The northern road is better paved but a lot of switch backs along narrow stream crossings and steep valleys.  This route gets much more precipitation than the southern route as evident by all the spectacular waterfalls and pools.  The northern coastline is more rugged and steep.  High winds and waves along the northeast coastline."
89,Road to Hana,If you can drive then do this yourself it’s worth it! Start early (before 0830) and you should cover the main stops. Small hikes along the way are worth it and so is the Venus Pools as the Oheo/Seven Sacred pools are usually view only. On way back catch the big surf just before Paia town and might see turtles coming ashore as well.
90,Twist and shout!!!!,"There are great side trips along the highway to stop and look at gardens and waterfalls. It's not a trip for those who get car sick. We went in 10 miles and decided to turn back because the road was bad. I understand once you get to Hana,  it's worth the trip and beautiful."
91,Must See and Experience a Full Day,Booked this one with expedia as well. the bus was airconditioned and comfortable. Most of the time was spend in the bus. They took us the opposite direction to avoid traffic. If you are ok to stay and watch the scenery from the bus go for this tour
92,Great adventure with beautiful scenery,"We did a self tour with the Shaka Guide -Classic Road To Hana Tour.  Highly recommend this app!  Was cool to have someone narrate historical martkers and alert us when areas of intrest were comming up (even telling us what to look for before we got there).  We'd have missed the first Black Sand beach if it didnt instruct us to pull over and check out the view of a spot (before we got to the touristy view point)!  We found the dirt road that led us right down to the isolated beach and there were only 2 cars there.  GORGEOUS, picturesque!I was scepticle about going because everyone was saying  it was a dangerous drive....SO GLAD I WENT!!  Paved roads and the single lane bridges were clearly marked with areas to wait for your turn.  Clearly the people calling this a ""dangerous"" road have never been on mountains roads like we have here Northern Idaho ha!  This was nothing compared to that!  Use common sense when parking on the side of the road to enjoy viewsStop at sites, walk to the falls, look at the landscape take pictures and soak up the beauty!"
93,"Road to Hana, and beyond","The road to Hana is not difficult to drive but requires constant attention and be aware of drivers who do not understand the courtesy required on narrow, twisty roads with one way sections. Also be aware of very discourteous locals who pass aggressively on narrow, blind sections. The waterfalls are great for photos but be aware that parking should be well off the travelled portion of the road. Hana Park beach is a great place to watch the surf (and surfers). Hana itself has nothing to see but I understand the locals wanting to keep it from becoming a tourist trap. The drive itself is reward enough for the effort."
94,Road to Hana,"Had ten days in Maui so decided to drive to Hana on one of them.  I’ve heard the road is windy and such but it is such a painful drive. Soo slow. My kids have never mentioned to my wife and I ever about feeling queasy in a car ride. This ride we heard all three of them say they felt sick. We all survived but the payoff we were all underwhelmed. The beach at the state park was rocky and just not a good beach for the kids. There were a few good photo ops along the way but you can get way better ones anywhere on the island.  We stoped at Ho’okipa Beach Park on the way back and we would have rather stayed there instead of driving to Hana. If you do make the drive to Hana, at least pick up some fresh avocados on the fruit stands. Deliscious and big."
95,"Gorgeous viewpoints and stops, so worth the difficult drive. Get the Gypsy Guide App.","The Road to Hana is an adventure.. Lots of waterfalls including 2 in HeanakalaNational Park.. The park ranger there was lovely.. I told her that I had made a nose Flute and she played the loveliest Flute music along with her favorite slide guitar music.  We also discussed becoming grandparents... She grasped my hand with the warmest of smiles and wishes.  To view the ocean and the mountains together at the visitor center is lovely!  Waterfalls, hairpin road curves upcountry, ocean views plus small towns with flavor including Paia and Hana which have amazing food trucks serving delicious poke bowls, fresh fish sandwiches Hawaiian shaved ice... So refreshing,!!! No more snow cones for me!!!  Please keep in mind that the road to Hana requires a skilled and focused driver."
96,Road to Hana,"We spent 12 hours going out to Hana and back from Wailea. If you have a National Parks pass, remember to bring it (unlike me..!) as after Hana there are the sacred pools which are inside Haleakala national park.I'd not really recommend Garden of Eden for a stop, or the Waikamoi trailhead. The peninsula is a good stop though, as is Wainapanapa state park.It will take you all day. Being snacks and cash for some tasty stuff on the way (Coconut Glen's!)"
97,Shaka Maui app was the best navigator!,"It's hard to enjoy the scenery when you are constantly watching for oncoming traffic on one lane bridges, narrow roads and people driving over the lines. Roads are so narrow there is no where to go but onto the mountain or over a guardrail. There are some pretty sites, but people parked in no parking spots by them make them hard to enjoy. I can't say it was worth the 2 hours of white knuckles EACH WAY! just as pretty of views during Malaea to Lahaina."
98,Beautiful Road trip - lots of turns ,"Wow!  The whole experience is never a dull moment.  I drove my friend and I and here are my tips: 1) Leave early-ish, after you eat a good breakfast.  We left Kihei at 8am after the tour busses and NO ONE was on the road at that time.  2) Get a good Hana drive app.  The iPhone we had kept wanting to rotate with all the other music, and we ended up deleting all the music just so the app would stay going. 3) Pack snacks and drinks since places to stop are few and far between. 4) No you don't have to stop at every spot. Nor do you have to spend much money. We stopped at: one of the wayside parks, the hot dog stand, Wianapanapa State Park, and various spots for breathtaking views and picture moments with waterfalls, ocean views, and lush rainforest. 5) If you have ever driven on mountain roads (think Colorado or any mountain range), or dirt country roads, or pothole filled alleyways: combine all these and the driver will know what to expect for the entire trip. The road is pretty good most of the way (a couple construction sites) but be prepared for the occasional rock, or pothole.  Better if more than one person can drive."
99,Spectacular views,Hana Highway is beautiful. There are lots of curves and one lane bridges and we had lots of fun driving on it. There are many attractions along the way with many waterfalls that can be seen from the highway. I recommend an early start as there is a lot of traffic.
100,I Survived to Hana Highway,"Spent 8 hours on the Hana Highway through a tour company (do not drive this road yourself!), and it was truly memorable.  So many waterfalls, different types of trees and foliage, the occasional cow and chicken, breathtaking vistas, and of course, banana bread!  Park areas are plentiful, and do stop to see the blow hole and the black sand beach.  Not far from the highway is the cemetary where  Charles Lindbergh is buried, as well as George --the monkey that sparked the children's book Curious George (the author is laid to rest there as well).  There is so much to see, and a full day is a must.  A ""must do"" for anyone visiting Maui."
101,Long trip,"We hit the RTH by 7:00am using an APP on an iphone. Glad we had the APP as it provided excellent driving and sightseeing information.This is an all day event if you want to get to the Sacred Pools at the Haleakala National Park.  Over 600 hairpins, switchbacks etc. Over 60 1-way bridges. Lots to see. Waterfalls were just Ok from our perspective. If you've seen Niagara Falls or the Falls in Iceland, you won't be that impressed. Warm banana bread from Aunty Sandy's is a must. Great roadside eats and Hana Town is very quaint."
102,Not impressed,"I never would do this driving yourself - spend the money on Easy Rider Tours - Billy Campbell - he knows all the secrets, will drive you, show you all the secrets, and you will have the adventure of a lifetime!  Can't recommend him highly enough."
103,Road to Hana,"Did this trip +. The road to Hana had a lot of nice scenery and stops, not as scary as some people claim. If you want scary, continue the road past Hanna and up into the mountains. There it is all dirt roads, missing guard rails high on the cliffs and single car lane, not just the bridges. Or drive on the west side of the island, the roads are paved but single lane and no guard rails.I do recommend the road to Hanna for the ocean, valley and waterfalls."
104,3rd trip to hana,"Very lush scenery and a long, windy drive asking the coast, this was a beautiful trip, though it started feeling rather long on the drive back.I recommend getting some sort of mobile tour, such as the Shaka Guide (though download it before you go)."
105,A beautiful scenic tour but not for everyone.,"This is a beautiful drive. Hilly, curvy, along the ocean, in the tropical forests. We started north and headed south. We made many stops long the way. One beach in particular was Ho'okipa Beach where we found a seal basking in the sun, protected by the rocks. Also 20-25 sea turtles beach in a marked off area. It was so cool. We stop at twin falls and headed a little more south to Honnomanu Bay. We discovered that you have to drive on private property and have a good 4x4 vehicle. We didn't take the chance but I hear they drop the surfers in by helicopter to surf here. Our most southern stop was at a road side stand for banana bread. The BEST you will ever have. It was still warm when we bought it. We headed back north and stopped in the town of Pa'ia for dinner. Cute little town and place to eat. Slips my mind the name of it but it was on the southwest corner if you are headed back from Hana. I wish we could've made the entire drive. I hear some of the road south may be unpaved but if you have  a 4x4 you can probably drive it. I would next time."
106,Road to Hana,"To each his own but i thought this drive made for a very long day. The first hour of tropical drive was nice but then it just got tedious. I appreciate the beauty of the landscape but this just got long. We did not stop for any of the hiking, which I regret. We did however make several stops along the way which were very nice. We did NOT drive back the same way and I am SO glad we didnt, the scenery on the way back to Kehi was stunningly beautiful and made the trip worth it! I would not do this trip a second time, there is so much more to see of Maui than the road to Hana. I definitely wouldnt do this car ride with a large family."
107,A must do when in Maui!,"Be prepared for a slow windy, curvy road with over 600 hairpin turns, many completely blind. It’s suggested you honk your horn while maneuvering them. Lots of one lane areas as well so be prepared to yield to oncoming traffic. All that being said, I would NOT miss this part of Maui! It’s beyond description in beauty! Plenty of waterfalls and majestic views of the coastline to discover. Once in Hana, there isn’t much there. Small village of old world Hawaii with a very nice harbor and beach."
108,Gorgeous views and stops ,"It is an interesting area with a lot of nature and cool water falls and beaches to see; however it is a long ride that doesn't cover a lot of distance. The roads are narrow and winding, and there can be a lot of traffic. There is also minimal phone or gps service for most of the trip."
109,"Planned to see Twin Falls, but drove further to see amazing views","Trails, beaches, scenec views. We did the reverse way, finishing in Paia.I would advise doing this in 2 days, staying in Hana.Too much to see and you don´t want to rush things."
110,"Long, Beautiful, A Little Nerve Wracking... But WELL Worth It!","We did not enjoy this drive!  There was pretty scenery but, not pretty enough to deal with very aggressive locals on a very small and challenging rode.  If you are going to drive it yourself, one hint of advice.... The smaller the automobile you are driving, the safer!  Don't get in a hurry either!  It will take you all day.  At least 4 hours even if you don't stop at the sites."
111,Gorgeous. Be prepared for it to take the whole day,"I drove this road after receiving several suggestions for scenic stops from the concierge in my hotel. It’s quite twisty and traffic can back up in spots, but it was a great way to spend a day in Maui back country.  The beaches have a variety of sand - black, red, brown, beige sand at various beaches. Lava tubes and water spouts through lava were fun to photograph. There are some historical and sacred spots where tourists need to be respectful.  We took a picnic and had a great day!"
112,Worth the scenic drive - a few recommendations to make it much more enjoyable. ,"The things man will do to see beauty.  Wow!  I will acknowledge all the books, websites and apps out there concerning the Road and all the beautiful sites to behold so I will only touch on a few stops.  This is one man's opinion about the experience....and that's what it is...an experience!  The road is more one-lane than two.  Curves?  No...hairpin turns and switchbacks.  Pulloffs are at a minimum.  Parking is wherever you make it.  Even if there is something you want to see or photograph good luck getting off the road.  Rent a convertible and drop the top!  Check out:  Twin Falls, Rainbow Eucalyptus trees, Keanae Pt incl Aunt Sandy's, Black Sand beach, Red Sand beach and Kipahulu Park incl Oheo gulch and Pipiwai trail with Waimoku falls.  All will amaze.  The drive will test your stomach and may even test your marriage but when you survive you can take pride in the accomplishment and relive with the boatload of photos you'll take."
113,Could be Enjoyable,"This road is wonderful and a great adventure  for everyone. Narrow twist and turn, one lane bridges, waterfalls, foliage, and beautiful scenic pullouts. What more could you want. This is not a road to take if you are in a hurry. There is too much to see and the other people on it are enjoying it also. Take your time"
114,Scenic Bucket List Visit,Beautiful excursion into trees and gardens of extreme beauty. Several waterfalls and gorgeous park beaches make easy access to nature at its best. Blow holes in black lava beaches liven the crashing waves. We left before sunrise to catch the views and avoid huge traffic problems. Twisty two lane road with some one lane bridges. Not for the easily nauseated.
115,Road to Hana with Bjorn,"Loved the Road to Hana& was glad I listened others said get GyPSy guide for Maui which had the Road to Hana on it.  My tips are go very early we left @ 8am & should have left @ sunrise.  The second stop after the Abbortum was where Sandi Banana bread is sold.  Stop & get it b/c its to die for.  The bread cost $6 its warm,fresh baked slightly crispy best banana bread I ever had.  I also got the best pineapple slices.  The sights along the way were really nice with waterfalls right on the road.  The road to Hana is one lane @ times & you can’t see if someone is coming the other way.  The 7 pools are nice but not worth extra 45 min drive to get to them.  The back road to Hana would probably be better not as narrow & you can see oncoming traffic Also on the 1st pullout there is a lower section with a beach & sea turtles can seen @ the far end the upper section has beautiful views also.  Just remember. parking spots a few & taken lots time leave early to get best experience"
116,Long winding road - fantastic - let a professional drive,We did the Road to Hana through Mahalo Tours. Our guide was Jamie. She was amazing. They limit the tour to a max of 8 people. The sights we beautiful.
117,Adventure ,"It’s a must do , rugged volcanic coastline pound pacific waves cliff top view bamboo forest waterfalls fresh water pools roadside dining this has everything else"
118,An Experience!,"We went on a Roberts tour.  Great tour guide/driver!  Bjorn has quite a sense of humor. But more importantly he knows so much about the island, Hawaiian history, famous people who have homes on Maui, the flora and fauna, the language and how to drive that narrow winding road.  He talked 90+% of the time.  I would not recommend a tourist try to drive that road. It is very narrow, and twisty. Plus the driver would be so busy trying to negotiate the road you would miss out on the scenery.   Plan all day. Leave at dawn back in the dark. The breakfast was pretty awful. Cold scrambled eggs...must have been powdered or Maui chickens lay weird eggs!  Lunch was a tasty sandwich. The cookies were not chocolate chip as advertised. But we didn’t go for the food!  Do the trip!  It’s worth it."
119,Dont Drive Yourself. Sit back and enjoy the ride.,"This was our first trip to Maui so naturally we had Road to Hana on our list, seeing it's on the top of the list in terms of activities. Prior to going, I had done some reading and realized this may not be a must-do for us, seeing there are beautiful beaches and sceneries pretty much everywhere else on Maui. However, being our first trip we decided to go anyways.We knew we weren't going to stop at every attraction and it's really just for the experience of the drive, and we planned to see whatever caught our eye along the way; so we didn't start first thing in the morning. Then our lunch at Mama's Fish House (just a little past Paia, aka the last town you can get food, drinks and bathroom breaks before you start the drive) ran later so we didn't start the drive 'til about 2PM. That actually worked out GREAT for us!Because we were heading in later, there weren't a lot of cars, in fact, there were plenty of times where we were the only car in either side of the road; that made the drive pretty easy even with all the twist and turns. We weren't going all the way so we made it halfway and back, saw plenty of beautiful scenes, stopped for delicious banana bread, in under 3 hours. I would say Road to Hana isn't a must-do, especially if you are already spending some time in Maui. There are beautiful beaches and great hikes everywhere on the island so it's not really necessary to enjoy them on the Road to Hana. We were very lucky because we've been told most people plan for a whole day so they start in the morning, which can result in traffic and make the whole experience a bit exhausting. Regular sedans are perfectly fine, but a SUV would probably drive better."
120,best part of maui despite the monsoon,"Or the Mini Cooper! This road is very narrow and as everyone says, very winding! But omg we had so much fun on it! Very memorable drive, highly recommend in convertible too."
121,Worth the drive,"The Road to Hana was, by far, our favorite thing we experienced in Maui. Plan on this taking an entire day - especially if you enjoy hiking! We left at 6:30 AM and didn’t get back to our Airbnb until nearly 7:00 PM. This experience is full of beautiful beaches, waterfalls, caves, hikes, and more - it is a nature lover’s dream! With that being said, this trek is not for the faint of heart. There are 600+ twists and turns in the ~60 mile journey to Hana, and it includes many one lane roads, one lane bridges, and areas with little-to-no visibility around each curve. Be prepared to keep your eyes on the road and you’ll be fine. If you’re prone to getting car sick, I’d recommend being the driver rather than a passenger. We rented a car ourselves and were so glad we did - had we experienced this in a larger tour bus, I think it would have been terrifying and made us sick. Having your own vehicle also allows you to skip stops or stay linger at others! We loved Wainapanapa State Park, Twin Falls, the Black Sand Beach, the Pipiwai Trail, Wailua Falls... there is SO much to see. We downloaded the app called ‘Shaka Guide’ and it provided us with guided GPS-based commentary, recommendations, and Hawaiian history throughout the trip - HIGHLY recommend it! Plan on bringing water / food / snacks with you, just in case. I’d also recommend a rain jacket/poncho; it rains 295/365 days a year on the Road to Hana! If you’re well prepared and researched, this will be an incredible day for you."
122,No Quite What We Were Expecting,"I loved the view and we have made a multiple stops to side cafetieres and attractions. We have a great experience! But! The road has enormous number of sharp corners and one way bridges, some parts have no guard railings and you have a mounting on one side and abyss on another. It goes on and on like this and it is a lot of fun to see all of it.But! If you are not a skilled driver or just want to enjoy the view instead of concentrating on drive and keep your eyes on the road, take a tour!"
123,long,"We left early around 630am from hotel in wailea. Got to the 7 sacred pools by 230pm. Best thing to do is just pay $7 for that app. He will recommend the top 5 can't miss destination and tell you the history of Hawaii on your drive back and keep you awake. Bring your swim clothes, towels, snacks n drinks and you'll be all set. Also try the banana bread made fresh everyday."
124,Road to Hell,"First time visitors to Hawaii... LOVED Maui!!!! Trip would not have been complete without Road to Hana and all the unique stops along the way. We pretty much followed Itinerary: Shelby’s One-Day Road to Hana Adventure on mauiguidebook.com to the tee and could not have been happier. HOWEVER, some tips to add to the recommendations to make the roadtrip less stressful:1. DOWNLOAD OFFLINE GOOGLE MAPS or take a detailed printed map on the trip! Internet access is pretty much non existent for most of this area. We bumped into several frustrated families who had no idea where to stop or what they were seeing.2. For the return journey RETRACE THE ROAD BACK TO PAIA! We made the mistake of trying to ""circle the island and catch the sunset"" on our way back... it was a terrible mistake. Not only is the road past Hana horrible, narrow, and pretty much nonexistent for most of the way, but the sun is severely blinding to the point of zero visibility along some narrow curves.3. RED SAND BEACH is really really worth going to - park by the community center, not Hotel Travarsa since parking is no longer allowed/legal near the latter. Also wear good hiking shoes - you will slip otherwise! Hope these tips help - the journey and stops are breathtaking... nothing like we have ever seen!"
125,A unique experience ,"We drove the Road to Hana which took at least 3 hrs without all the stops on the way- hiking, overlooks and bays. Definitely gas up before starting. I recommend packing a lunch and taking snacks. There are food stands along the way but they close around 4pm. Paia is an awesome little town to stop and eat or get shaved ice. I also recommend downloading an app for the Road so you don't miss anything. We went as far as the Lindberg grave and road gets rough, not recommended for travel in certain vehicles. Lots of people on this road."
126,Journey,"Take a tour don’t drive yourself OMG the single lane road the single lane bridges, the waterfalls we had a great time but it is a mission.  You want to say you did it."
127,Worth doing (off-peak),"We started our day off snorkeling and began the Road to Hana around noon which allowed time for the majority of the traffic to be ahead of us. Note-we reset our odometer at the beginning of our Road to Hana adventure so those are the #s in ( ). The 1st notable stop was at the rainbow eucalyptus trees; so vibrant & beautiful. My picture location  for the trees says ""14 HI-360, Haiku HI 96708""; just past Papaaea Rd. On the left side. A quick minute walk through the rainforest led us to Haipua'ena Falls (11.5 m). Next time I would consider jumping in to cool off.(Almost) Halfway to Hana is a good place to get a snack; a mini loaf (or 3) of banana bread of course! It really is that delicious! (17 m) Pua'a Kaa  State Wayside Park is the waterfall where my son & I chose to swim. Entry is a bit tricky due to rocks so water shoes are a must. We were able to go behind the waterfall by holding onto crevices in the rocks. It was certainly refreshing! (22 m)By this time we were getting hungry so we stopped at Nahiku Marketplace (29 m). Many of the places were already closed; however, Up in Smoke BBQ still had some amazing grindz! Our teenagers were excited to see mac & cheese on the menu! We were initially going to eat at Hana Harvest Cafe, but the employees were cleaning up at 4:45 pm and would not even acknowledge our presence. Skip Hana Harvest and head to the marketplace for a wide variety of food and much better service. The man selling coconuts at the marketplace even opened my sons' coconuts for them; we tipped him well!Make sure you save plenty of time for Wai'anapanapa State Park. Absolutely gorgeous! This was the highlight of our day and it wasn't busy late in the day. We started off with views from the top of the lava rocks (very powerful waves) and then took the path with stairs down to the black sand beach. There were quite a few people tent camping in the park. (32 m)It was time to head to Hana Kai Maui Resort for the night (separate review)."
128,Second time doing the full loop,If you’re in Maui this is a MUST. We rented Jeeps and drove the entire road all the way around Haleakalā. Totally stunning and totally worth it.
129,Awesome views on this scenic road,"The long winding road to Hana - especially favorable during heavy rainfall - but what can you do? Turn around - surely not. So we drove all the way, starting in Kahului and bypassing Paia and its windsurfing neighborhood, going past the Twin Falls to the Garden of Eden Arboretum and following the long winding sometimes quite narrow road to its name-giving town Hana. Don’t miss the Hana Lava Tube (205 Ulaino Road) not far from Hana, it is amazing! Please allow at least 2.5hrs from Lahaina for the drive, better consider 4hrs each way, since you want to enjoy the scenery and not get to Hana the fastest way possible (which is slow, mostly 15mph;)!"
130,It was a little challenging but worth it! ,"Many say the road to Hana is a slow relaxing ride with many beautiful spots to stop and see. There are many beautiful spots.  Mainly waterfalls or spectacular ocean view. However spots to stop, hardly. The road to Hana is full of twists, is very narrow, and one lane at times.  There are minimal pull off spots to safely pull over to see the sights. After 3 hours of driving there wasn’t much at the end of the road that we couldn’t have seen without the strenuous drive.  Then you get to do the 3 hours back to your resort. I can say I have been to Hana, but if I knew the drive would be like it was, I would not have gone."
131,"Great trip for Great Drivers, AND  Horribly Lousy trip for nervous types, including passengers.","Don't try this trip on your own...Take a tour. There are more than 600 turns along with narrow roads and one lane bridges. A tour guide knows the best places to stop and best sites to see. Be prepared, it's an all day affair."
132,Breathtaking!,"With the purchase of the Shaka Guide APP, YOU CAN EXPLORE,  and go on all kinds of adventures, just by listening to the guide as you drive, on the Road to Hana.  We were stopping a lot and seeing many exciting  things we would not have seen otherwise.  We did the entire drive two times with lots of stops over a two day period.We stopped at stands along the road, fruit, bake goods, ice cream, lunch.  Take cash.Credit cards are not welcome by some stands along the road.."
133,Crazy ride but amazing!,"We booked Mahalo Tours Road to Hana tour and can't say enough good things about it.  Our guide was Charlie, and he was a great guide from the beginning of the day to the end. The food was great--samples of Hawaiian fruit and banana bread-- and also a wonderful hot lunch!  While many Road to Hana tours stop only 7 or 8 times, we stopped at least 18 times.  Charlie provided great information at each stop, and--while some companies advertise brief photo opportunities--Charlie even took our pictures at most stops!  AND they weren't all just the typical pictures--many were very creative.   The last one that he took was a big hit on Facebook!  We were so happy that we didn't choose to drive this ourselves--way too stressful! By leaving the driving to Charlie we saw many gorgeous beaches and beautiful waterfalls--stress free!  We had a great day!"
134,Not so scary,"This was a 12 hour adventure and could have easily been longer if we'd planned a night in Hana. We drove all the way around instead of back-tracking; but if you do this make sure you hit the gravel area in the daylight. We had a mid-size SUV and where happy for the clearance... it would have been difficult in a sedan as that gravel section of the road is rough and rocky. This was worth the day, but we would highly recommend you enjoy the stops, hikes and views."
135,Holy Hana!!,Sounded like a great trip... Talk of waterfalls and lush foliage - unfortunately we were caught in a traffic jam for almost an hour on the only road to Hana due to road construction. The waterfalls were unimpressive but we did enjoy the stop at the Black Sand Beach and Ke’Anae Park was very nice with the views of the ocean and lava rocks. The rainbow eucalyptus trees are not to be missed...
136,Take your time!,I will definitely recommend if you Laine adventure! The road is very curvy and you definitely have to drive slow due to parts of the road being one car only. The views fromThe road are amazing! We went to one waterfall. But there are plenty of you are willing to get into the forest and climb rocks. Water in the waterfalls are cold. But it is an amazing experience to swim in a waterfall. Hana Beach has a dark sand. However the water I. The ocean still great!  I would recommend to spend the night in Hana. Next time I will try the way back through Samoa Beach. The only problem it is the 5 miles non-paved road. I will definitely return to Hana!
137,Must do!,"It is a must while visiting the island. Just relax and enjoy. It is a great experience, not only the views are great, but the road itself as it goes one way once and over, and all the briges you have to go through."
138,Dangerous drive,"The road to Hana was very pretty and little bit scary because it’s very narrow and winding. Bring some food with you, we didn’t found any good food in the way."
139,Road to Hana not for the faint of heart!,"If you are a big hiker or nature person, this would be great. We did a few short stops thanks to our Shaka App (highly recommend). We walked to one of the many waterfalls, through a lava cave and the beautiful state park, Waiʻanapanapa. Hana was underwhelming, which I guess is the draw “sleepy, authentic Hawaiian town”. Twisting and turning the roads for 8 hours was exhausting and I was so glad to be done. Yes, a few cool nature sites, but be prepared to block off all day."
140,About the journey ,It was a very long drive up the mountain!  There was construction at some points.  It was pretty but not worth the drive in my book.  Some may disagree.  We went the opposite way home.  We did not turn around and go back the way we came.  There were not any quard rails at some points of the drive.  Make sure you have plenty of gas.  You couldn't see the beach through some of it.  It would have been better to see more beach.  I can say I did it!
141,Awesome Drive,"I'm going to be the voice that speaks up and says BE PREPARED. I had read reviews of how ""amazing the Road to Hana is"" and I'm sure for many it really is, but we decided we didn't want to spend an entire day driving it, so it wasn't going to be on our list. However, we also didn't plan very well and didn't look at a map before setting out that day. It's totally my fault for not looking first, but I mistakingly thought that Pipiwai Trail was on the way up to Haleakala Crater. It's not. Not even close, although both are in Haleakala National Forest. (Duh!) It was about 11:30 am when we were just starting up the road to the crater and looked at the map, so we decided to scratch plans to see the sunset that night and head for the crater instead. Because of this, we had done ZERO planning for the Road to Hana. Ya'll. It's 600 hair pin turns on a road that starts out fine, narrows down to nothing but a single lane dirt/rock path along a cliff before getting back to paved roads that will literally take you all day to drive. IF you do plan to do it on purpose, make sure you leave early so you're not driving the last few hours in the dark, thus removing even the chance to see a beautiful view while driving this crazy road. Do your research ahead of time so you know where the blowhole is, the lava tubes, Charles Lindbergh's grave, etc. All of which I'm sure could have made that drive much more enjoyable. As it was, once we got on the Road to Hana, we were stuck like we were in a Disneyland ride following the car in front of us with no way to get off. Consider yourself warned."
142,Getting pretty busy,"Do not let people scare you away from this drive. If you get a early start you will beat some of the traffic madness. We used the Shaka Classic Road to Hana app as our virtual tour guide and that was money well spent. Shaka makes it a breeze to find all the best stop along the route. We also stayed a night in Hana and we had the Red Sand beach nearly to ourselves, late in the early evening. Hana is a relaxing little town with several great hikes."
143,Road to Hana over rated,Must see!  Lots of turns and could cause car sickness but we rubbed an oil behind our ears and none of us got sick.  We stayed the night in Hana so we took our time.  I highly recommend downloading an app for the drive.  Lots of insights that make the drive fun.  We used SHAKA guide and it was perfect.  We stopped and got banana bread along the way and just enjoyed the ride.
144,Road to Hana,We took The road to Hana tour with...a local company called Hana Tours of Maui. Our driver & tour guide was Mike. He was the best! Very knowledgable & friendly. He made our tour & I would recommend to ask for him!Darlene & Jerry McNicholTour date: Jan 30/20
145,Nice drive,"The drive is a little harrowing as it had more than 200 turns and 60 one lane bridges. If you are prone to motion sickness due to sharp turns, perhaps not the drive for you. However, it is a super adventure. You can stop all along the way for wonderful views of waterfalls, flowers and lookouts. At the rest stop, if your remember you bathing suit, you can swim under the falls. The drive, with stops, and a longer stop in Hana for food before heading back will take at least 6 hours. We PAID ($15 a person) to walk for over an hour as well at the ""Garden of Eden"" en route. Gorgeous, well labelled plants, with excellent views of the ocean, waterfalls and flora. Hana itself was less exciting as it is not very large and we did not want to spend more time swimming in the ocean as we needed to drive all the way back on the same road on which we had come. In a rental car, you cannot drive all the way around the island to get back to where you started. It is one way in and the same way out of Hana."
146,Incredibly scenic full day drive; not for faint of heart,"This journey is not easy, but definitely worth the drive. There are 600 curves (many of them hairpins) but there are also dozens of waterfalls and spectacular views of the ocean and the cost. Also a wide variety of vegetation; our favorites are the Rainbow Euchalyptus. The black sand beach at the State Park was our favorite. I bought the Gypsy Guide App for $6 and it was priceless. It gave ample warning of stops worth making and the narrator was very entertaining and oftentimes funny. On the way back, he gave interesting stories of the history of Hawaii and that part of Maui. If you want to see it all, leave early and plan at least 6 hours, maybe 8."
147,Be prepared,The road to Hana is quite beautiful. It is a long drive. 2 1/2 hours minimum. We left very early which is recommended to avoid the traffic on the way there. It is a fairly curvy road so if you have passengers who get woozy on curvy roads be mindful. After the drive we took the pipiwai falls hike which is 1/2 hour beyond Hana!  The falls hike was worth the drive. Simply amazing. Highly recommend this once in a lifetime experience.
148,Driver’s paradise ,"Stop at Coconut Glen's for the *best* coconut ice cream on the planet.  Skip the ""Halfway to Hana"" banana bread and head for the ice cream!  You won't be disappointed!"
149,Once in a Lifetime Memory,We rented cars near the port and headed off to Hana.  The road is narrow and rough in some spots but oh so worth the views!  We enjoyed the food trucks near Hana and the Farmer's Market on the way back. The road past Hana to the park was especially rough.  Rental car parking is available overnight near the pier at a hotel.
150,Interesting area,"Having read a lot of the reviews which talk about it being a white knuckle ride and difficult for the driver to enjoy, I very nearly talked myself out of doing the drive... I live in Europe and have driven around the Lake District / Alps / Amalfi Coast a handful of times but was concerned this would be a real challenge. However I’m so glad I went for it - the roads are generally in excellent condition and yes it is narrow at times but nothing to hairy. The scenery is breathtaking and well worth taking a day out of your trip to see! We took our 22 month old and loaded the iPad with cartoons to keep her entertained in between stops so would recommend that for young families. Furthermore, for those interested... we decided to carry on driving past Hana around the mountain and past the Pools of ‘Ohe'o... the road turns into more of a track in parts and can result in a bouncy ride. We had a Jeep which handled it fine but not one I’d be up for doing in a standard car. Arguably, IMO, even more breathing taking scenery on this leg so I’d highly recommend it if you don’t want to drive back along the same road you just came along and are up for slightly longer in the car (and have plenty of cartoons downloaded for any little ones travelling with you!)"
151,Spectacular tropical scenery,"I was nervous because of some reviews that painted a very scary drive but my husband and I found the drive very enjoyable.  Yes, it is one curve after another with way too many one lane bridges but the bridges are short with good visibility (and it was a rainy day) and we found everyone drove slow and took turns at the bridges.   We did the drive at the end of our Maui vacation and stayed overnight in Hana at a guest house which we both agreed made for a leisurely drive.  We drove as far as Ohe’o Gulch, stayed overnight in Hana, then did a straight drive back for breakfast in Paia before heading to the airport.  We used the Gypsy App and enjoyed the commentary out and history back.  Especially liked Garden of Eden, Keanae Point, and Seven Sacred Pools."
152,What views and so much rain.,"If you go to Maui and don't go to Hana you haven't experienced the island.  Make sure to get a t-shirt that says, "" I survived the road to Hana.""  One lane bridges, hair pin turns and the most breathtaking scenery you will ever see."
153,Hana heaven,"It was amazing to see all the beautiful vegetation and the waterfalls right along the highway!! Gorgeous black sand beaches too! Great areas to hike and explore right off this 2 lane highway. I stayed in Hana for a couple of nights and was able to explore this highway even further. Only downside is the one way bridges! You have to yield to oncoming traffic and pray that everyone is mindful of the signs because it is very dangerous otherwise. Some of the locals drive like maniacs passing when they aren't supposed too. If you aren't a great driver (a senior, overly cautious, new driver, etc) I would highly recommend taking a tour where they do the driving."
154,Scenic Drive,"Our family enjoyed this - but it may not be for everyone.  Just my husband, our 14 year old son, and I really enjoyed exploring this side of the island and all the little stops to venture out and experience.  However, we are fairly fit and didn’t mind being on the car in a lot of twists and turns.  We stopped and hiked the paths to the falls, which most you can see from the road easily.  We also checked out some of the lava tubes.  It is a long time in the car and you need to plan ahead and watch your time to enjoy this.  Yes there are some one-lane spots but they are well marked and everyone yielded cautiously and there were no issues.  I would recommend rotating two drivers so both. Can enjoy the drive as well as the views.  We did pack snacks and used an audio guide as well which made the trip enjoyable and guided us to where we should stop and where there was bathrooms.  We drove from Paia to the Oheos seven pools and back.  10 hrs."
155,Curvy road with great sights,"An interesting ride to say the least,  but  the drive is challenging.  Some good scenery for the passengers,  but driver has to be quite attentive to roadway. I believe a little overrated.  Also, there is really nothing in Hana really worth seeing.(Yes, red beach with tough hike) Don't waste money by booking a hotel room.IF you want a crazy and unique experience, drive the lower ka'anapali route 30 road that takes you around the mountain.  Should be a great driver!"
156,Driving the road to Hana,This is a must tour while in Maui we have taken it both time we were in Maui with the same tour company and found new things to see both times. Don't drive the road to Hana  It is defiantly worth the money to have your own tour guide on this winding twisty road.
157,Road to Hana,"This is a must-do while on Maui. The Road to Hana is definitely a long day, but the ride is beautiful.  You’ll see waterfalls, rainbow eucalyptus, and pretty views of the lush island and ocean.  Although, our favorite part was the black sand beach at Waianapanapa State Park. The beach is small and get crowded, but is worth a stop.  it’s gorgeous.If you get motion sickness, I recommend taking a Dramamine before heading out. I also suggest leaving early. My husband and I left our hotel about 6:45 a.m. and drove straight out to Hana. We then made our stops on the way back. As we drove away from Hana, the traffic coming in was very heavy and slow.  If we had been stuck in that traffic, I doubt we would have enjoyed our experience as much as we did."
158,Stop at Coconut Glen's!,We started early and didn’t even stop to see everything.  We had lunch in Hana and then continued on to where Haleakala park started again then turned around.  We were gone all day but the sites are beautiful!!
159,Roller coaster of a ride in Maui,"If you love driving, this is the road for you.  It’s much better in the non-rain season I’m sure but we did it with the top off on the jeep (we got a little wet but it was still 75° out) and the stops are abundant.  Miss a waterfall? Hit the next one.  Pay the fee and go to the Garden of Eden, and the black sand beach!"
160,Use Shaka Guide for a Great Experience,"Road to Hana is the BEST ride that I did with my family to date.The views are just incredible. The views, weather and scenery were out of the world.No words can describe the beauty of the ride.One has to be there to enjoy it."
161,Breathtaking views-worth the drive!,"We drove Road to Hana since it was our first time on Maui. We were anticipating a twisty road but just take your time, be courteous around the bends and waiting for the one-lane bridges and all is fine. It really wasn't as treacherous as anticipated.We left early enough with a full tank of gas, hiking shoes, rain gear, snacks and drink. There are places to stop for views and most of the time it seems as if you are driving through a green leafy tunnel.. the adventure. Go down the Keanae Road to Aunt Sandy's banana bread stand - stopping for some to enjoy - and go all the way to the end. Pretty spectacular with the waves crashing along the volcanic rocks. The church is all that remains from the 1946 Tsunami.I would not want to travel this road in the dark, but we had lots of time to enjoy. Get a good guide book and do some research before your drive but do allow all day."
162,Fun day with grandchildren,The road to hana was nice. The traffic was light which was good for us. Stopped at many places along the way and the scenery was spectacular.
163,Long day but worth it,"Traveled to Hana with three grandchildren.{teenagers) We all enjoyed the fantastic ocean views, waterfalls and view of Haleuaka  from the west side. Was interesting to show them Lindberg's  grave and their interest in the history.Would not recommend this trip for anyone who experiences car sickness. Played them the song"" 54 Bridges to Hana"" upon our return."
164,Amazing views and a must see in Maui,Wasn’t planning on doing the road trip but last minute ended up doing it. It was AMAZING!!  Around every corner and bend there was a new set of waterfalls or new beach to explore truly a new adventure. My favourite stop by far was the black sand beach!  Was so glad we did it.
165,We survived the road to Hana,If you are wondering whether to bother... do it! So worth it! Just make sure to do lots of stopping along the way. This is definitely a case of a journey rather than a destination!
166,Must Do & Tips,"Great, but not the ultimate. Concentrated beauty but no single thing was earthshaking. 1200 curves out and back. Still, fantastic day! Start early."
167,Interesting ride,"Beautiful trip, our tour guide Mark from Valley Isle Excursions told us a lot of facts and history of the Island of Maui.  Can't go wrong with this trip Aloha Jim"
168,A must do!,"We downloaded the Shakaguide beforehand, which I’m glad we did. The guide gave us very useful tips as to what to see and where to stop on the way. If we had planned better, we would have stayed the night in Hana! Please consider this, we missed hiking the Pipiwai trail because we “ran out” of daylight and wanted to be back in Paia before dark. We started at 7 am from Paia and got back right before 6 pm. So the guide is very correct and knowledgeable (albeit a bit cheesy at times...but in a good way). Our highlights were the “hidden” lava tube on the way, the black sand beach with the waves splashing high in the air and the Kahanu Gardens (a native Hawaiian botanical garden with an ancient temple; pi’ilaninhale heiau). Beautiful, very few people. We followed a lot of the Shaka guide’s recommendations, but Nahiku was really not worth the detour and the extra time it took to drive down there. You’ll see better views of the ocean elsewhere and it was nothing special driving down there - just a windy, narrow road strewn with old, abandoned cars...so unless you’re extremely interested in the rubber history on Maui and want to see some remains, then I’d skip this part. Also, if you tend to get car sick, this road might not be the right thing for you. My husband gets carsick, but he was the driver and had to focus on the driving so that saved him. And, if you’re an insecure driver who doesn’t like passing other cars on narrow, windy roads, then please consider a tour instead."
169,Overwhelming natural beauty,"Auntie Sandy’s banana bread and the beautiful church and the raw beauty of the ocean on the Keanae Peninsula at mile marker 17!  A hike to TWO waterfalls at mile marker 10 (keep going to the second waterfall!). Everything about Waianapanapa State Park black sand beach, including both hikes!  We LOVE this adventuresome space.  So much to do and see!  It could take days and days and days to see and do it all!!"
170,Beautiful drive and worth it to go all the way to Hana,"Hadn't done this drive in a few years.  The road is winding, the bridges are narrow, but if you take your time it's a wonderful, scenic drive.  We used the GypSy (?) app on our phone which worked great and saw a number of things we missed on previous drives."
171,Beatiful road!,Enjoyed the road to Hana! We left Wailea area early to avoid the traffic. We drove all the way to Pīpīwai trail to begin hiking. We enjoyed the trail without anyone. It was a great 4 mile RT hike and easy to do. We then stopped at the black sand beach after and it was busy! I’d recommend maybe stopping there first? Great drive!
172,Fabulous journey,"My husband was crazy skeptical about doing this, but had a great time. We used the Shaka tour app and it was so worth it. It entertained us the entire time. Don’t feel compelled to stop at every place - you will never get done."
173,I'm a survivor of the trip on the Road to Hana,"So I drove the Road To Hana today expecting to be blown away.  All the travel guides rate this one of the 10 best in the world. As you head east towards Hana and pass Twin Falls, that’s when all the curves and one lane bridges start. FYI, the speed limit on my of the highway is only 15 mph, which is all you should go with how narrow the road is and all the blind curves. The reason I say it’s over rated is because 90% of the road is forested and you can’t see a thing but trees. Yes there are beautiful waterfalls along the road, maybe 10-15 or so, but you can only stop at a handful of them. Also with most scenic drives I would expect pull out to see awesome views, nope. There are some really nice off shoots from the road like Ke’Anae, black sand beach and red sand beach. Then there is the village of Hana. With all the hype over the road, I was expecting a small artsy town with several shops and restaurants, nope. I think they had like one actually restaurant and maybe 10 or so food truck food stands. To summarize, if you go, keep ur expectation in check, this isn’t the PCH, Going to the Sun Road or The Great Ocean Road, just a really long winding road through a forest with some waterfalls."
174,Great ADVENTURE,"I was *really* nervous to do this drive with just my friend and myself. My husband usually does the scary driving, and after watching videos and reading posts, I was convinced it was going to be a near death experience. In all honesty, it went super well! You can totally do it yourself with a few guidelines. 1. ALWAYS keep your eyes on the road. The road obviously curves and there are so many blind turns that you really need to give it your full attention. 2. Go slow. The curves really are not that bad when you’re going really slow. 3. Move over for faster traffic. There are frequent places all over this road to pull over to the side so that people can pass you. To take away stress, I did this any time I had people behind me. I had numerous cars express their appreciation for this, and it took stress away from me - a win/win. This was honestly my favorite day of the whole trip. I had been so stressed over the driving that I prayed many times over it. It turned out to be such a blessing! There is no way you can make every stop, so decide before hand what you want to do. The commentary from the Gypsy app was worth every penny. Definitely get that. Waiʻānapanapa and the Pīpīwai Trail were my favorite things on this trip. We went to Waiʻānapanapa first, then our next major stop was the Pīpīwai. That way you can hit whatever you want on the way back.  Just be advised that the Gypsy app assumes you stoped at sights on the way there, so it doesn’t tell you to pull over on the way home. Also, we kept the top down on the convertible and even those prone to car sickness didn’t get any! When it rained for a few minutes, we would put it up, and after we would put it down. Just check the weather before you go, and make sure they’re calling for less than an inch of rain. It rains pretty much every day, so don’t let rain deter you, just Lee your eye on the amount expected. Whatever you do, don’t skip this!"
175,GREAT DRIVE IF YOU ARE THE PASSENGER!,"We had a lovely day driving to Hana. It takes much longer than you think. Hana itself is not exciting so to make this trip worthwhile, make sure you stop along the way to take in the different highlights. It’s the drive to Hana that is spectacular. Not Hana itself. We downloaded The Gypsy app and it was excellent. Runs on gps not your data (there is no cell service anyway).  The app is great. Guides you there with things to see and story tells on the way home. Don’t forget your charger though! It drains your battery slowly but you won’t have enough powers all the way to Hana and back. Glad we made this trip! You need to be sure you are always aware on the road. There are people who drive too fast and don’t seem to want to stop when reaching a one lane bridge. But overall, most drivers are good!If you are thinking about doing this trip and you need a nudge.... here’s your nudge. It is worth the trip but give yourself a full day so you are not in a rush to get back. We left at 8:30 and returned at 4:15ish.  And we didn’t make all the stops! Enjoy!!!"
176,Road to Hana,"The Road to Hana is a great drive.  There is great beauty in the drive. You do have lots of curves and many sections of one lane roads and bridges.  Not all drivers show courtesy at these narrow sections, however."
177,Nice day trip - with quite a few beautiful spots to stop and hike or enjoy scenic beauty,"We used the Shaka Loop Road to Hana. We had a 4 wheel drive jeep. If you are going to do this trip, check your rental agreement. Not all rentals allow you to do this route. We left early in the morning and made many stops along the route.The guide is fantastic. You will download the program before you leave on your trip as there are many places without cellular service. We stopped at many of the places mentioned in the Shaka Tour along the way. We did the entire tour and saw it all. I liked that the Shaka tour gave background on all of the areas along with tips for parking, hiking and eating.....and restrooms! If you do this tour, you will see the diverse topography of Maui. You will see the moutains, the tropical rain forest with majestic waterfalls, beautiful black and red beaches,  and you will finish your tour on the very dry, barren back side of Maui. The views are incredible. Start early as this is not a drive to do in the dark. We started about 6 am and came back to Kiheh around 7 PM. It is a long tour but it is worth it!"
178,Rain rain go away,"It is an experience all right, felt like we were putting our lives at risk at the tight curves and not being able to see if anything was coming towards you, not so bad if you are on the inside, but on the outside lane, it is a steep drop down if you slipped off.  My heart was beating pretty fast at more than one these curves. It would have been helpful if we would have written down some of the sights to stop and look at.  While researching on the internet, there were some amazing sights that we missed not knowing where to stop.  Yes, one will see cars pulled over, but not knowing what to see and how narrow the road was, it was pretty difficult to find a place to pull over too.  There are guides on the internet that tell you which mile marker to stop at for the various views, I wish I would have written them down.  I thought there might be signs telling you but there aren't.The views that we did see were breathtakingly beautiful.  The foliage was so beautiful, flowers, trees, vines, grasses, bamboo, etc.  I was wanting to see some waterfalls and luckily there were several one could see from the road.  For this reason, I would say it was worth it.  I get car sickness easily if I am not doing the driving, which I did on this trip, but still had to pull over towards the end to lose my cookies, saw others doing the same!   Once you reach Hana, it is a nice little town.  You can keep going straight and then you will end up at the National Park, or turn around in Hana and go back (which you will be on the outside lane)."
179,Backwards !!,"Still pulling my fingernails out of the dashboard! 3 hours (one way) of hairpin curves and one-lane bridges, and then trying the be back before dark — not worth the stress.  Several near-misses with vehicles coming at us around blind spots and rocks that had fallen into the road. There were some great views, if you could find a place to park the on the already-too-narrow road.       However, there were MUCH better views and MUCH nicer drive on Kauai’s Canyon road."
180,"Road to Hana-Natures showy trees, beaches, waterfalls","We drove the road to Hana and back and it was certainly verdant and beautiful, but not for the driver. This is a road that is very narrow and windy, with lots of hairpin turns and one lane bridges. Locals are impatient with tourists and often exceed the speed limit and pass on blind corners or hills, putting everyone in serious danger. There are few places safe enough to pull over and get out as much of this highway clings to steep cliffs. There are some small food or craft places but none have advance notice to let you know they are coming up. Hana Bay is nice, and while we tried to attend the Kahanu Garden National Tropical Botanical Garden the creek was unfortunately running so high across the access road that it wasn't safe to cross. It would likely be better to go on a tour to Hana."
181,"Tons of fun and a new view every minute.  Purchase the ""Shaka Maui Guide""app at the App Store,for your I pad or phone.","We only had time to go half-way to Hanna, but the lush scenery, fun food trucks, and great hikes were amazing. The twisty road and one lane bridges were okay once we figured out the best way to drive them. We listened to the Shaka Guide app tour guide as we drove and really enjoyed the trip!"
182,Hana Highway Mini-Road Trip,"The Road to Hana from DynamicTours was a great experience from start to finish. Hotel pick-up, informative guide and amazing views made for a great day. The only things missing were a stop at Lindbergh's grave and in Hana itself but of course, that would make the trip a little longer. We are glad we didn't travel the ""divorce highway"" ourselves!"
183,BUCKET LIST - THE ROAD TO HANA AND BEYOND,The road was incredible and we saw waterfalls and parrots and rainbow eucalyptus it was incredible.We stopped at Lorraine's shaved ice near the end.  Great memories.
184,Road to Hana counterclockwise,While I am glad we did it is a long day. Would really recommend staying in Hana on night minimum so you can make more stops. However our time was short and had only one day. Sights are great and almost too many good places to stop. One place not worth it is lava tubes. Price per person was very high. And did look like it would be worth time or money.
185,"A long, narrow, windy, beautiful drive ","My girlfriend and I (early 30’s) did the Road to Hana on our own*. The asterisk is because we downloaded an App for $7 that actually talked to us during the trip and as we approached certain sites, would explain about the site and recommend whether it was worth stopping.This literally takes the entire day. If you want to get the end and be able to drive back before dark, you literally need to start at about 7:00 am, as it will take close to 7-10 hours to finish and it starts getting dark at about 5:15-5:30. Also, let em caution that the road is extremely narrow and is very windy with an incredible amount of turns. Picture a condensed letter S and that is the road for a big portion of the trip. If you don’t mind the driving and hairpin turns, this is an awesome experience.We started off in Paia town where we ate at the logical Paia coffee cafe which is awesome. Very laid back and cool vibes and food was delicious (I got eggs/toast/meat and my GF got Açaí bowl). Definitely recommend starting there before Hana.We made multiple stops along the road, but these were our favorites:Aunt Sandy’s Bañan Bread (Mile 16)-if you like banana bread, this is your stop. It was delicious.We stopped at triple bear falls, which was also awesome. It looks intimidating to get down to, but it really was not bad at all. We got int he water there and were able to take pictures under the falls, it was awesome.One thing I don’t recommend doing is the garden of Eden. They charge $15/person and there is nothing there that is so incredible that you need to pay to see something. There are plenty of free stops along the way. We could have done without the Garden.There’s definitely a good amount of good food stops along the way. Make sure to try as much as you can, as the high majority of the food along the way was tasty. Stop for ice cream, bañan bread, and there will be a small village that has several small food truck/outdoor small restaurants to eat at.The Road to Hana takes all day and is very tiring, but well worth it if you can drive.Bring a towel and change of clothes, especially if you plan on going in one of the falls."
186,Pretty road,"A long and beatiful road with narrow curves, one lane bridges etc. Passes a couple of beaches and many waterfalls - some are beside the road and some are a short walk into the woods. Small ”shops” with fresh frusits, ice cream, coconuts etc along the road. Drive very carefully, especially when it rains! Mauis most beatiful drive!"
187,"Reverse Hana, worth it","We were advised to take the road to Hana counterclockwise to miss the crowds. I wish we had started a few hours earlier, but it was a beautiful trip anyway. The rainforest spots, glimpses of the cliffs, waterfalls and meeting the locals. All wonderful things to find on the road to Hana, either direction. Be prepared for the stops and starts with traffic, the twisting and turning road......paved and unpaved, the drop offs to the water and ravines. Drive carefully!!"
188,Make sure to rent the jeep!,"The road to Hana an adventure? Well it depends. For those who never saw a jungle, never drove a sometimes tight serpentine road this might be an adventure. Who ever drove passes in Europe or doesn’t get a hard attack if it gets tight while driving a rental car and already visited one of the tropical gardens on the Hawaiian islands this road will be nothing new. Regarding the bumpy, tight, 4wd road past Hana (Piilani Hyw). Well you will have no fun in a limousine and there are some steep passages that might bring a 2wd to its limits. We rent a 4wd Jeep Wrangler and it was easy, and we had fun. The paved road of Piilani Hwy is like driving in Scotland’s highlands with really nice views.Our highlight was the Haleakalã National Park with the trail to the Bamboo Forest."
189,Best Vaca Ever,"I took The Riad to Hana Tour with Valley Isle Excursions in November, 2019.  Robert was my driver. He was generous sharing his information about Maui.    I was picked up at my condo @ 6:30 a.m.   It is a beautiful 12 hour adventure long the West Coast mountains of Maui to Hana.  Along the way, we stopped for a Continental Breakfast consisting of coffee, tea, juice, muffins, pastries and fresh fruit.  We also stopped for a picnic lunch consisting of a barbecue chicken breast, macaroni and cheese, salad and rolls. Several bottles of water were  included for each passenger in the van.  We stopped off to see waterfalls along the way. Also, we had an opportunity to take a brief swim, too,  I got back to my condo around 7:00 p.m. I am happy I made the decision to use a tour company.  The total cost was  $156.00.  It is an adventure I enjoyed, but I don't think I'll try it again.  It was a very long day!"
190,Best car ride to date,"You must take the drive to Hana at least one time in Maui.  This was our 3rd time and it's still as magical as the first time.  Go early, stop often, and get back to Paia by dark. Drive slowly and take it all in.  Locals will drive faster so just pull over and let them go by.  Chill!   Wear your bathing suit and be sure to play in the water stops.   The Fish Market is a great casual restaurant to stop on the way back for a super casual bite to eat EXCELLENT, well priced fresh fish!"
191,Road to Hana tips/ Shaka Guide app,"This road is a complete disgrace.   It’s 1 and a half lanes wide with no shoulders.  There are pullout where you can stop and wait for a clear lane.  Unless you have good insurance, it’s not worth the risk.  There’s lots of places just as pretty and a lot less dangerous."
192,Bucket List Day Adventure,"We used the Shaka App and drove the Road to Hana this past weekend and it was raining through most of the drive.  The road was very busy and there were not any places to pull over to see the sites.  When we did find a spot, it was so muddy.  By the time we got to the Black Beach (which was beautiful), the rain had stopped and we really enjoyed the rest of the drive.  My husband drove and I did fine on the way to Hana, but I was very anxious on the drive back from Hana.  They were working on the road and there were several big trucks on the road and they were driving way too fast!  I am only giving this a 3 because our experience wasn’t the greatest, but we will do it again when we return to the island.  I would recommend wearing hiking boots and bring a rain poncho."
193,Highway with Heavenly views,"This is something worth doing once. The road is long, slow, and curvy. It's easy to get sick so make sure to have medication to help with motion sickness. I was told that the average time to get to Hana was 2 1/2 hours. I thought that was crazy and that I could ""drive  bit faster"" and get there sooner. Boy was I wrong. Even if you want to speed up, it's not worth it. The best way to do this trip, is to take an entire day and just enjoy the drive and scenery. The local drivers are annoying and they will get up right behind your bumper, but as long as you pull off every once in a while and let them go bye, it's not a big deal. The views are amazing, but the drive is long and hard. Prepare before you go so you know where you are going to stop and plan in breaks."
194,Disappointing end of the road.,"Its a very long day (12 hours) but its so worth it!. Many stops along the way to see parks, water falls, rainbow eucalyptus, black sand beach, etc. This drive gives you a real appreciation for the wild and majestic landscape of Maui."
195,very narrow and winding road,A very long journey with far too many twists and turns on the road to Hana for us. Not a trip for people that get car sick.
196,Full loop around Maui on the road to Hana,"We traveled this road with friends in a rented car.  The road is about 50 miles long, but very very slow and winding.  Some of the attractions were not well marked, and the road was not conducive to turning around once you missed something, as in some cases where the mile markers did not line up with the guidebook, or we just couldn't find it.  It took us almost five hours, with stops and searching, to traverse this road, and a bit over three to return. Our friends loved this drive, but for me, the proportion of riding time to getting out and seeing/doing was about 80/20."
197,Waste of Time,Used the Gypsy app to navigate this road.  I highly recommend downloading the app to give you a narrative tour of this highway and it tells you the Hawaiian history as well.  Well worth the purchase.
198,"Long, beautiful drive","We did as recommended and left super early in the morning. In total we were 8h in the car, but it was absolutely worth it.We did the whole tour with the gypsy guide which is an app you can download for 10$ and it gives you live commentary as you drive along. It tells you where to stop and what to see. We did the tour until the pools at oheo which was absolutely amazing. Definitely worth skipping a day at the beach for"
199,Must Visit place,We were a little worried about the road given some of the reviews but we were pleasantly surprised! It was curvy and you sometimes had to wait for cars but it wasn't dangerous if you paid attention and drove the speed posted.  Lots of beautiful country to see and hike. Even though it poured rain most of the day it was fine. Just take a rain jacket!  Stopped at a little roadside place for chicken which was really good...fyi cash only at most of the places along the road.
200,Hana Adventure,"Please let me start off by saying that any individual that can drive and is not scared to drive can drive the road to Hana. We drove it in a 15 passenger van and while many of the turns were tight we were in a 15 passenger van that was carrying 10 people I drove it myself. Please save your money and don’t be tricked by all of these companies that are charging anywhere from $150-$220 per person. You can pack a light snack get started early in the am like 6am to beat all of the other people that will be in your vans. The number 1 suggestion I would give of your going to drive it yourself would be to know what stops you would like to see and use the Gypsy app that is $9.99 cents it is a perfect guide to the Road to Hana but split the stops in half. See half of your sights going and the other half on your way back. I noticed that on the drive back it was a daunting straight curvy drive that no one liked because we didn’t stop at all on the way back but if you can break the drive up into mini sight seeing stops it is perfect. There will be multitude of locals selling great food but buyer beware of the first banana bread stop, please save your money and wait until your into the trip more to experience the different various great foods the locals have to offer. 1.you can drive it2. Start early3. Know what sights you want to see4. Gypsy app was amazing5. See half the sights on the way going and the other half coming back.6. Bring/wear swimming trunks, spf and enjoy your in MAUI"
201,Wonderful experience,"we took a tour through aloha circle  with the ""local boy""  damien   and we were not disappointed.   damien was a wealth of knowledge and humor  ""wouldn't you agree""  being his favorite phrase.  we had a blast and saw some awesome sights and learned all the history and safety that went along with it.   loved every minute of it ,my husband is still talking about the local boy   we will definately be back for more"
202,Some key tips to enjoy this roadtrip!,"Okay, it was a great days drive, but the road is barely two lane with constant switchbacks so be aware and allow plenty of time. Lots of places to stop for photos on the way, beautiful views and waterfalls. Hana itself was comprised of a 100 year old general store across the street from the ""town center"" - post office, grocery store, craft store and a really good restaurant! Just allow plenty of time - 51 miles took over 3 hours, and then you have to make the same drive back..."
203,Love this road trip,"I was told by my hotel concierge to get this App before heading out for the drive. I am very impressed with the guide as even in location without internet, the GPS on this app still know where we were, from turn to turn, very impressive and informative.  The drive really took all day, especially it’s important to get out and smell the roses —— see the water fall, do some fo the trial and walk down to the beaches from time to time. I would suggest to stay in Hana if possible to break this into 2-3 days trip. Will be helpful to do the sunset/sunrise drive to Haleakala (no, it’s not advisable to drive from Hana to Haleakala, even though it looks deceptive on the map that they could be close. Both drive is long and windy, the more days you could have in Hana or even Paia will be helpful."
204,If you can you must!,"The first time we explored the Road to Hana we took a guided small tour. I highly recommend that for everyone. The second time we travelled it, we had some difficultly finding some of the spots we had visited on our tour. Plus the drive can be quite scary so I’m my opinion it is best to leave it to the professional drivers."
205,Road trip to Hana,Use the Gypsy guide to make it easy for you. This is a long demanding drive. Inexperienced drivers should not attempt. The waterfalls are incredible and there are a ton of them. The state park has a trifecta of caves black sand and blowholes. This is a journey manage your time wisely
206,Not for me,"Last did this about 10 years ago. Now quite a bit more busy, but just as beautiful. Much more to do in Hana now. Still worthwhile, but can get busy."
207,Breathtaking views ,"The Road to Hana is everything everyone said it was! Winding curves, beautiful waterfalls, and beautiful vegetation! A must see!"
208,Download an app and drive the Road to Hana,"We only spent one day on Maui and we’re only able to drive half of the road to Hana from the port to a rest stop marking the mid-point. This half took approximately 4 hours to drive round trip including 3 picture taking stops at the waterfall swimming hole, the bamboo field (not public access one) and the halfway stop. We did this drive and Haleakala and would recommend taking a whole day for the road to Hana in order to properly experience and enjoy it. The roads are seriously winding with 90 degree switchbacks. The reason we didn’t finish the drive to Hana was that we were not confident we would be safe driving the roads after dark. Locals will ride your bumper if you drive any slower than 5 miles faster than the posted speed, but there are areas to allow them to pass every couple miles or so. The beauty on this drive is not to be missed. It was like a drive through Jurassic park without the Dino’s."
209,Must Do the Entire Hana Highway Loop!,"This was a very exciting adventure our driver Wayne made a road like easy to navigate even though it is not. This is a must do experience if you’re visiting the island, I am confident you will not be disappointed. Please be advised if you tend to get carsick this ride is not for you."
210,A must do in Maui,"Depending on when you make the drive, you can get to Hana in less than 2 hours or it could take over 3!  Plan to stop along the way to see the waterfalls.  They are beautiful.  Even better, get out and walk and see them up close.  There are pull outs all along the way.  The drive has lots of twists and turns but it is not as bad as people say.  The main disappointment was the town of Hana and Hana Bay.  As the saying goes, the joy is in the journey, not the destination.  If possible and you have the right vehicle, when you get to Hana, instead of driving back the same way you came, keep going all the way around.  Have fun!"
211,Always a fun trip,"We had a great day driving the road to Hana.  The weather was perfect.  We loved stopping at the beaches- especially Black Sand Beach.  Warning, don’t stop at the first fruit stand right by The Garden of Eden to use their outhouses- they charge $. 1.00.  Just up the road is a very nice wayside park."
212,Crazy Road!,The drive is really not as bad as I was prepared for. Yes there are curves and narrow bridges but very drivable. This part of the island is beautiful. We started early and only stopped at Waiahpanapa state park on the way down to the national park. Traffic was lighter for us as we made our stops on the way back.  Most people do their stops on the way down and puts you in the crowds.  I highly recommend spending a night in Hana to get the full benefit of this area. There are many interesting things to see the off the highway.
213,Don't drive back by night,"This road trip is worth the zigs and zags along the way.  There are so many places to stop and enjoy the natural beauty. If you make it all the way to Hana, you are rewarded with a black sand beach experience that should not be missed!  We ate at The Ranch restaurant in Hana - very nice setting and good food.  We were so happy to find something open on New Year's Day!  The six-year-old on our trip didn't appreciate the long drive, though, so it's best not to bring small children on this long road trip."
214,Not kidding about the curves,"It is a long day and you wouldn’t do it every year, but this year we had beautiful weather, the waterfalls were running all the way along. Seven pools was gushing. Other years we swam in the pools or waded in them this year it was tidal, you couldn’t get near them. Had a great ice cream and a coconut along the way, about mile 26?If you haven’t gone, go! If you haven’t gone in a while, go!"
215,Awesome tour with Valley Isle Excursions,"We have done the road to Hana a few times as we bring new family members to Maui. This time we used the Shaka Maui app and it was fantastic! Great stories and history, good spots to stop for the amazing views. I am not affiliated with them, but highly recommend it!We did the reverse road to Hana, we always loop, but this was the first time we started in Kula and ended in Paia A couple of notes: - yes, there are many blind corners and one lane bridges. They are not bad, but they are there- it is windy ( as in curves, not air) Very. We are not prone at all to car sickness, but just to be safe we break a bonine/dramamine (non drowsy of course) and take one each.  Never had a problem with the winding road- the backside of East Maui is just beautiful to see the broad open plains. It is a nice change away from the windy jungle of the Paia to Hana portion. - Stop at Sandy’s in the Keanae peninsula for her Banana bread. If they are closed, get it at the Hana Farms. (Especially their chocolate chip banana bread 👍🏼)"
216,Amazing!,"We got an early start, drove the entire road to Hana and continued past Hana coming out on the other side of the island, returning to Lahania in time for dinner.  The road is narrow, full of sharp turns and very little parking at many of the sites.  Some call this a warning, we called it part of the adventure.  Our favorite spots were the rainbow eucalyptus trees, the many waterfalls, the roadside stand serving pork, chicken and bananas grilled, the overlooks, the black sand beach at the park, the red sand beach and the seven sacred pools past Hana. We then chose to continue on across a very rough, bumpy road coming out at the lava fields instead of backtracking.  It was a long but amazing day!"
217,Beautiful road trip,"Our Road to Hana trip, with Bjorn Erlandson, was very exciting and amazing!  The trip was really long (per information received beforehand) but we were expecting that when we planned this excursion.  But we had plenty of rest stops.  Bjorn was very funny, knowledgeable and professional!  Highly recommended."
218,Amazing!!,"We left Lahaina at sunrise got back an hour or so before sunset so long day but glad we did it once.  Would never do it again though.  The road was fine. Lots of turns but not that scary and I am deathly afraid of heights.  It was the other drivers who were rude, didn’t yield, honked when they were in OUR lane. We wanted to visit Hana Gold plantation and see the bamboo forest and waterfall at the end of the bamboo forest.  These places made the drive worth it. If this is on your bucket list go early! Drive slowly. Double check for oncoming traffic. Be prepared to have to back up on a curved road.  Take turns driving if possible. Safe travels"
219,Reverse route VERY strategic!,"Important note be aware which road your GPS takes you to start this trip as it may take you to the crazy back road that car rental places and concierge warn you about. It was very fun for me but a little scary in a small car. Road is very bumpy in alot of areas, pot holes and takes you through some crazy jungle where cows and goats chill in some areas close to road but the coastline view is amazing. If you rent a jeep and want an adventure to remember then I recommend going this route saves time and less traffic. Main Hana road overall is challenging with small narrows roads and one lane bridges but worth doing as doing this yourself can stop where you want and spend as much time at the different falls, beaches and other swimming environments. If you do this treck on your and not tour download Hana Gypsy guide will ensure that you dont miss any stops as they are not all marked and easy to find. Is very long drive best to start early at 6am and if you can split in two days so you dont drain yourself and can enjoy the stops and some of the hikes."
220,The Road to Hana was a highlight of our Maui trip,"I drove the road to Hana from Paia.  I had 3 young adults in the car with me.  We enjoyed the wonderful views of the ocean, the cliffs and the waterfalls.  We stopped at the black water beach and hiked and put our feet in the water.  We stopped for a bite to eat at the roadside market.  The banana bread is delicious and the stone fire pizza was fabulous!  One regret:  we didn't stop at the Lava tubes:(  Those are the caves we were looking for.  Next time...."
221,Self drive Road to Hana,"This is one of the more beautiful drives on planet earth. Waterfalls, spectacular overlooks, lush jungles, and a beautiful beach at the end made up this spectacular drive. The black sand beach is just amazing. Go early in the morning to get the best light and to beat the crowds."
222,Road to Hana,"Wow! This is a 12 hour trip. We did a tour, highly recommend a guide as this is a truly nasty road! Without a guide you'll miss the beautiful waterfalls, historic landmarks, and local places tlo stop. It's a must see and do."
223,Hana,Being rookies we didn’t know how rainy the other side of the island could be.  The drive is beautiful and I am sure fun on a sunny day.  Download the app.
224,A Real Nail Biter,"This is the 3rd time on this trip and we love it!  We took out friends this time and the trip was a nightmare.  I would recommend that if you take another party with you, check to make sure they are able to handle the constant turns and traffic on this highway."
225,Do it,"We have taken the road to Hana several times but last week we had the pleasure of doing it with friends visiting with us from England. They were blown away by the scenery, flora and fauna, etc. My wife went on an app that had the precise location of the places that one needs to see on the trip. Some are very tricky to find, such as the volcanic tunnel that you can actually walk inside of - but be very careful entering the cave as it is tricky, As everyone says, make sure you are back in civilization before dark. Also be aware that “the locals” are not happy driving at the speed most tourists are comfortable with. They get in your trunk and basically force you to pull over and let them by. Doing so makes the trip more pleasant for everyone. Highly recommend the trip for anyone who has never been on it."
226,Gorgeous,"Road to Hana is a great scenic way to see a ton of nature that Hawaii has to offer.I highly recommend the ""Shaka Guide"".It is an app you can download on your phone that will track your progress on the route and update you with historical facts, information about the areas you are driving through and points of interest to stop if you so desire.Plan an entirely full day for the trip there and back!Great way to take a self guided tour.Great for the whole family."
227,Never gets old!,"I would highly recommend renting a 4 wheel drive vehicle for this trip, and if you do rent one, drive the back way (towards Kaupo) back. Some areas have only dirt roads on the way back, so if you have neck or back issues you might not want to drive this way, but if not it's a lot of fun! The views of the ocean, mountains, waterfalls, and villages are amazing and well worth the trip."
228,The longest trip ever,"We drove from Paia to Hana and spent the night and then drove around the other side of the island. Our reservations in Hana allowed us to leave Paia at noon, which was great. We had hardly any traffic in our direction and had plenty of opportunities to pull over and see the sights. We downloaded an audio guide for the trip which I very strongly recommend to make sure you do not miss anything you want to see. We used the Shaka Guide app and it was incredibly helpful. We left Hana in the morning and continued around the island towards Wailea and the road was much rougher and a little crazier. We endured a few white knuckle moments mostly because of other drivers but we loved the hike in the National Park on the way and had a great time - more amazing stuff to see. Also recommend a Hana Shot to keep your nausea at bay!"
229,Hold on tight!,"Hana hwy is narrow and full of twists and turns as well as one way bridges. Don't go if you tend to be carsick. It is especially difficult at night. That said, there are some view areas of the coast, waterfalls, and small villages on the way. At Hana, it is not so special either. Over-rated. The only good thing is going to the Pipiwai trail. It is beautiful, with bamboo forest and waterfalls."
230,Another Fabulous Drive to Hana,"A must being in the big island.Theres hundreds of curves, dozens of briges, and tons of fun.Beautiful views, all with different ocean views, cliffs, mountains and rainforest to enjoy.It is a must, I insist."
231,Put Your Adventure Hat On,"We arrived on a Friday and got on board of Pride of America on the following Saturday. As NCL made an annoying change of time-table which cut short of the second day of visit of Maui, we had to drive to Hana when we still had jetlag on Sunday. Thankfully, the road condition wasn't that bad even we set off after 8.30am. We stopped for a smoothie, a quick lunch at the local stores, the Lava Tube and drove all the way to Waianapanapa State Park. We arrived just before 12pm. We had a dip at the black sand beach and enjoyed the Lava Cave and the sceneries. We stayed an hour more than the planned 45 mins.We managed to stop at Koki Beach and then Wailua Waterfall which was stunning and refreshing. We had a swim and absolutely loved it. We didn't have enough time to go to the Seven Scarced Pool. I think unless you stay overnight nearby, it's almost impossible to get there, do the 2 hour (1 way) trail and be able to return to the Harbour before sunset. The road to Hana was challenging but it wasn't as bad as what others made it out to be as long as you drive slowly and sensibly. It was pouring heavily on our return journey so we couldn't visit the peninsula and the Twin Falls as we wished. Overall, we enjoyed it throughoutly and were glad that we had made it. I highly recommend it."
232,Beautiful but hazardous,"You have to drive this windy, seemingly endless road at least once in you life. If you cannot tolerate curves and more curves, this is NOT the adventure for you. There are interesting spots to stop and see, but beware! You must be on high alert the entire time you are driving. There are MANY one way bridges, and people don’t drive as safely as maybe they should. I lot count of how many blind curves there are.  This drive is the experience, with lots of water falls and breath taking views to be had.  If you don’t stop, it will probably take 3 hours to go 50 miles. Plan on a long day. Hana is ok, but go further to the bottom part of Haleakala National Park and visit the falls. Beautiful. Beware, you cannot take a rental car further on the road so you have to go back the way you came."
233,A must do in Maui - for experienced drivers,"We have friends from England visiting us here on Maui and we took the road to Hana yesterday. They were blown away by the incredible beauty of the drive. We have made it a number of times but one never tires of it. My wife accessed a site that was very precise on where to stop on the road to see the major attractions. Without it, we would have driven by a number of them. They come up on you very quickly because of the curvy roads and the lack of places to pull off the road to get out and see them. You really need to be on the alert. For the first time we stopped at the lava flow cave which was a real treat - but very hard to see unless you know exactly where it is. Beware, getting into it is a bit tough but well worth the effort. The black sand beaches near Hana are always a special treat. For first time visitors, make sure you plan to be back into “civilization” before it gets dark. Another thing to be aware of is that there are “locals” driving the road as well and they go much faster than the tourists. Their basic approach is to get into your truck and more or less force you to move into a pull out when available and then they wiz by you. No big deal but it’s a better practice to let them around you. It makes your trip much more enjoyable. There are a number of food stands along the way and most of them are not worth the stop. Their fare is expensive and not that great. If you have the time, continue past Hana and the Seven Pools and go see the grave of Charles Lindbergh in a little church yard. It’s about 12 miles past Hana. Enjoy!"
234,Beautiful sonic Drive with loads of surprises. Make sure you know how to Drive in the rainy curvy narrow roads.,So me and my husband decided to drive the Hana highway ‘backwards’ - meaning we ended in Paia instead of started there. We began with a full tank of gas (we had rented a Jeep which I recommend if you plan on driving the back end of the Hana highway at any point) and started our day at 6:30am leaving our resort. Leaving so early was a blessing since there was practically no one on the very ~very~ narrow roads! But the views were stunning and we were able to leisurely stopped along the road and take pictures as we pleased! We arrived at the seven sacred pools nice and early before any of the crowds! Additionally we had plenty of time to make it to the red sand beach which was one of my ‘must sees’! Overall going the non-traditional way around worked out better for us since the things we wanted to see were closer to Hana not Paia! But I wouldn’t recommend driving the back end of Hana on a very rainy day the roads are very narrow and close to the cliff sides and lack of experience navigating them would be very dangerous in muddy conditions!
235,Drive to Hana,"What a spectacular drive. Two lanes, single lane bridges and beautiful views. You'll never regret doing this! Make sure you get the app for the drive, it's GPS to your drive so it's a great experience."
236,Plan your stops! ,We went on a tour with Polynesian Tours and would not have done it any other way. The guide / driver was so informative and funny. The waterfalls were really flowing. She stops for you to get out and look and eat. The back side of Hana is REALLY bumpy but again beautiful. This is at least a one time must. This is an all day trip but worth it
237,Vacation,"My wife and I drove the entire Road to Hana (including the back road) starting just past Paia at 7:30 AM and ending in Kula at 6:30 PM (highly recommend doing this to maximize your time). It was a full day of awesome views and experiences you won't get anywhere else. We were slightly nervous starting the drive, as we read many reviews of how dangerous and scary the trip would be. However, this drive was not scary at all! The roads are definitely windy and there are many one lane bridges, but we have definitely done worse, more windy drives than this. Do not worry. Even the back road - it is bumpy, narrow, and sometimes near cliffs, and we did have a jeep, but I can't imagine any car having problems with it. And the views were certainly worth it. We stopped at Twin Falls, Garden of Eden, Keanae Peninsula (and Aunty Sandy's Banana Bread), Hana Farms for Lunch, the Red Sand Beach, Pipiwai Trail, Seven Sacred Pools Trail, and several overlook points along the back road. This was one of our favorite days of the trip!"
238,Road to Hana,"Our family group of 11 members aged 12 to 72 had a great time cruising the twists and turns of this tour. Beaches, waterfalls, flora, fauna......they’re all there on the trip. Opportunities to take pictures, buy fruit, banana bread, ice cream, and honey were available. Overall the tour lasted about 12 hours."
239,Road to Hana,"This was my 6th and probably last trip to Hana. The foliage along roadside has grown up more than I remember, so be sure to pull off the road to enjoy the beautiful views. Don’t miss them. It rained a lot up mountain and the waterfalls along roadside were beautiful. Lots if people parking along roadside and standing on road for pictures so drive slow and be ready to stop. I tell my mainland friends not to miss the experience. Plan for a 6 hour round trip, and enjoy this unique experience."
240,Half-way to Hanna,"Hubby & I, long winding road, but wow the views were breathtaking. we stopped along the way to take it all in and snap a few pictures. 4 days on the island was a lot of fun. we stopped at the halfway point and bought fresh banana bread. it was an all day trip on the paved and unpaved road. quite the experience."
241,"WOW, WOW, WOW. Pack a lunch, stay in lovely Paia to get an early start, and beat the crowds!","There is an extraordinary amount to learn on this trip.  It takes all day for a reason.  However, if you are driving then you will miss much of the tour and more than likely not sleep in the same bed as your significant other that evening because of all the fighting that will likely happen.The other reviews can explain why this is a must do, my review is a warning.  We saw accidents on our tour and our guide kept reminding us that this is known my locals as the divorce highway.  I can see why.An absolute must, but with a guided tour."
242,"Full day of exploring and driving, breathtaking views","Let’s face it- the Road to Hana is one of the must-do things in Maui. That said, I’m glad we did it, but I don’t necessarily want to do it again, at least for a long time.We used the GyPSy app as a guide, which I highly recommend as it does a great job narrating and letting you know when a good stop is coming up. Well worth the small investment. The Road does have some pretty incredible stops. Favorites were the Garden of Eden and the stop with the Rainbow Eucalyptus Trees. The app suggested going past Hana about 45 extra minutes to see a waterfall and the Seven Pools (in Haleakalā National Park) before turning around. I don’t think this was worth it. The pools looked muddy and were definitely not worth the park entrance fee, which thankfully we had already paid for the sunrise a couple days before. Otherwise, that $25 would have been put to waste. We didn’t even take any photos there. The waterfall on the other hand was pretty, but honestly, there are a lot of pretty waterfalls on the Road. It’s also worth noting that past Hana, the Road becomes a lot more narrow (almost one-way) which means slowing down immensely when there is a car coming in the other direction. Which means it takes more time. If I did it again, I would just turn around at Hana instead of going the extra distance.Overall, I’m glad we did this, but it is a very exhausting day. We stayed in the west side of Maui and it was 10.5 hours from when we left to when we got back to our resort."
243,Glad we did it once,"My brother in law and I took the entire loop from Kahului to Hana and back around the south side through the up country. On a Sunny day with light traffic we saw waterfalls and beautiful ocean views. The road is curvy, narrow and one lane in places but not as bad as I’ve heard - mostly paved except for several miles of gravel on the south side."
244,Nightmare drive,"We had a convertible, but took the advice of others and went with a driver over narrow curvy roads through mountains, stopped at waterfalls where you could swim in the rock pools. At a black sand beach, there was a 50 or 60 foot massive rock formation in the center of the cove where I filmed 4 young men from Australia bravely leaping from the top. To watch this is way better than the movies. We learned so much from our driver, and the local people were delightful. What a day!"
245,The Road to Hana,"The worst part about this road is not the skinny 2 lane highway that often becomes a one lane road around a curve where it’s hard to see,  but the crazy numerous crazy tourists who are stopping whenever and wherever to take selfies!  I studied this road and wrote down all the major stops recommended by numerous blogs.  But we ended up not even stopping by some of them because it was just too crowded and unsafe to stop.  I personally didn’t finally enjoy the drive until we got to Hana!  We luckily stayed 2 nights in Hana and the road is completely different in the evening when the majority of the tourists go back to Central Maui.  We even left later in the morning as recommended but it was still very crowded!!!  Staying in Hana is a must!  It’s beautiful there!"
246,Gypsy guide made the road trip fun and informative,"The road is beautiful, but what most people don't realize is the road on the other side of the Island,  from Lahaina to Wailuku, going north, is even more attractive. Both roads are dangerous, but the Hana Rd is even worse, where dozens of one lane bridges have to be crossed. Allow 3 hours to stop occasionally."
247,"It's a long day if you do it in one shot, there and back.","The Road to Hana was one of those things that every travel site and blog recommended but we were fairly disappointed in it.  We didn't have a fun open-top jeep or convertible so perhaps that would have bumped it up a notch in our books but we felt like it was a lot of driving and getting behind slow drivers who didn't understand turn-outs compared to the number of things to see along the way.We stopped at a couple waterfalls but other then for one, we would look at each other, shrug our shoulders and hop back in the car.  We did enjoy the walk and view of the twin falls, however.  Most places didn't have a large area to park and unless we knew something was coming up, many times we'd come around the corner and see something but be past it/the parking area before we could really figure out if we wanted to stop or not.  And there's just not any good places to turn around.We had been up late the night before at Haleakala Crater, watching the stars and since we were relaxing on this vacation, we didn't want to leave at 6/7am, which is what I had noted as a good time to do so.  Instead, we slept in, got breakfast and got on the road around 11am or so.  We still managed to drive to the state park before turning around and doing all the sights on the way back and getting back to the start of the Road to Hana around 4:30/5pm.There's really no cell service here (to be expected) so it may be good to download an offline map of the area, so you can still look things up on the map.  There are virtually no bathrooms on this drive (we saw them here or there) and very few places to get food.  I would suggest bringing a roll of toilet paper for emergency stops and some solid snacks."
248,Road have improved from last visit,"We really loved the Road to Hana and the several beautiful stops we made. Aunt Sandy’s banana bread was amazing, and the black sand beaches, the lava tubes, and many beautiful over looks and waterfalls. I would definitely do this again."
249,The long winding road to Hana,The road to Hana is a must for anyone visiting Maui.  Once in Hana visit the seven pools and make sure you swim in one of them. Good luck will follow. Take the back road home for great views of the ocean. Getting to Hana on the main road can also be terrific. Make some stops at small towns and roadside stands for a memorable experience.
250,It's all about the adventure...,"This is the second time I have traveled this road. Yes it is very twisted and slow, but the views are worth every minute. There is fantastic views, waterfalls, trails and roadside vendors to stop at. I highly recommend this but know it will take most of the day if you travel the full road."
251,Whoa Nellie!!,"The Road to Hana is just like we expected, almost.  Yes, there are a ton of curves (617 I think), and there are a lot of bridges, mostly one car width (was it 52 or 56?).  So the moral of that is START EARLY and take your time.  You are in Hawaii, take your time!We used the Gypsy App and it worked great, advising of points of interest, and points of no interest.  And it gave plenty of time to let you know when to pull over.Here are two points I would highly recommend you pass on.My car load thought the Garden of Eden Arboretum was not worth the $15 per person, and wasted time here when it could have been used elsewhere.  Sorry, just our viewpoint.The Seven Sacred Pools after Hana where a bust for us.  We were there about 12 years ago when you could hike down to the pools and swim in them as well.  Unfortunately this time when we where there, it had a flood a week or so before and the water was brown in color and not very appealing.  Even if the gate where unlocked and access allowed down to the pools, we would have passed.  So check out the conditions before making the 45 minute drive.Now the good stuff!  Everything else!  Amazing waterfalls, so much beautiful and spectacular scenery!  We stopped at Waianapanapa (Black Sand Beach), had a packed lunch and then went down the steps to the beach.  I think this was the best stop on the journey.My suggestion is to start early and take your time.  This drive is not about getting to Hana, it's about everything along the way.And one more thing about the Gypsy App, it told stories about the history of Maui and Hawaii along the way back.  Very interesting."
252,Road to Hana,"I took the Valley Isle tour of the road to Hāna as I did not want to drive the difficult road, and I am so glad I did. It is a long 10 hour day with several stops. We went through a bamboo forest, rain forest , stopped at a black sand beach, Lindeburg’s grave and a beautiful deep pool with a high waterfall into it, where several of the passengers took a dip in the coolish waters. We had a quick breakfast and a barbecue style lunch. The road itself is very precipitous in places, very full of deep potholes occasionally, and sometimes is very winding and single lane. Our driver said it had a nickname of “divorce road” !! So unless you really prefer to drive, and have a sturdy car and placid passenger, I suggest you look in to taking the trip by van tour. I was very pleased to be able to see the forests and waterfalls of the mountainous interior of the island without the awful drive. Also I think that children, especially the young ones , would find this trip very boring"
253,Wow!,"My daughter rented a Fiat convertible and off we went on our great adventure! From waterfalls to bamboo forests, we had a beautiful experience. The black sand beach was fun, as well as all of the scenery on the day-long trip. Some of the road was barely passable for oncoming vehicles, but it was worth it. We stopped in Hana and had a delightful lunch (I don't remember the name of the restaurant, but there are only a few to choose from). I didn't want to take a day away from the hotel pool and beach at first, but it was worth the trip. Definitely a bucket list day!"
254,Completely worth it,"Perhaps, next to Haleakala, the ""Road to Hana"" is the most famous and well traveled experience on Maui (aside from the beach areas and major cities).  Yet, we never made it ourselves during the entire eleven years we lived on Oahu.  I was just too involved with working in the hospitality industry.  Well, we almost made it once, but our friends got sick when we started.  Anyway, if you've never done it, please do.  Don't be hesitant because you heard about all those winding twists and turns, not to mention bumper to bumper traffic.  There are the twists and turns for sure.  But, that's one thing that makes it special.  When we did the ""road"", we were pleasantly surprised that there was so little car traffic.  Now, we did go during the first few days of October; so, we avoided the busiest tourist time of year.  So, think about that.  We did not have to concern ourselves with pulling over to the side or stopping at a site, and worrying about getting back on the road.  That said, you MUST take the long way and follow Route 36 past Hana and continue on around the back side of Haleakala and then on to the West side of Maui (sort of a loop if you will).  I promise you won't regret it and will see views that you many never get to see from the highway.  Why? Because most people will simply take the ""reverse Hana"" and go back the way you came.  We suggest you do otherwise.  That said, we did our research beforehand and checked out the timing and logistics.  What we learned that even many locals aren't aware of is that the backside road has been much improved over the years.  It used to be all unpaved or mostly unpaved.  Now, there is still a small (relatively) portion unpaved and you will be required if you rent a vehicle, that it be an all wheel drive one.  You also need to time your drive so that you begin the other side of the Road (past Hana) no later than early afternoon.  That way, you can finish the drive during daylight hours and not in darkness.  You don NOT want to be driving this part of the road in darkness.  There is very little traffic anyway during the day, plus not too populated.  We also purchased a road map specific to the R2H.  They have a website and you should check it out for more info.  We ended up stopping at the Black Sand Beach in a state park, Hana town itself, Hasegawa General Store (do yourself a favor and just drive by), and a beautiful little church and grounds where Charles Lindbergh is buried.  After that, just continue driving west on the road (route 360) and enjoy the beautiful ocean views and Halaeaka mountain sdie on the right.  You should end up on Route 37 that will take you back up to around Kahalui.  Unfortunately, you can't get directly to the West side without going north first."
255,Beautiful windy road trip,"We did Hana 23 year ago, it was a MUCH different experience.  Road was drasticlly improved, but it is still a very long trek.  Next time i think i would go the highway.  But it has quite the sites along the way.  You have to do it, to say you did!"
256,Road to Hana,"On our third trip to Maui, we decided to finally take the ""road to Hana"".  We're glad we did, but this trip was exhausting and nerve-wracking.   We saw on a tee shirt there are 617 curves, 56 bridges (46 one lane), and would take three hours.  ALL TRUE!!Leave early, take your time, and definitely stop at Wai'anapanapa State Park.  There's a black sand beach there that's really cool along with some beautiful views of the inlet.Waterfalls along the way were beautiful but made for very crowded road conditions and difficult parking.  Again, go early to avoid most of the crowds.  I can't say we would take this trip again but I feel good we've earned our Road to Hana ""merit badge""."
257,Beautiful views but...,What a beautiful ride. I got to be the passenger while my husband drove so I just took a few hundred pictures and enjoy the ride. I read there are 620 curves and 52 one lane bridges. We stopped several times to see water falls etc. we got to the town of Hana and had a picnic lunch by the black sand beach. It was beautiful. Then we went a tiny bit further but the cops had a section blocked off which was close to the side of the island that is dangerous. So we turned around and went back. Our hotel was on the west side of the island which was an hour from the beginning of the Road to Hana so we spent 9 hours total for this trip but it was so worth it!
258,The road to Hana,"We loved this excursion!  Our driver, Junior, kept us in stitches all day!  And the scenery is unforgettable!  An absolutely wonderful, fun-filled day!"
259,Road to Hana,"This was my second time doing the road to Hana.  My first time I drove and this time my fiancee drove as she gets car sick - so since she drove she had no problems and I was able to navigate.  As others have mentioned we downloaded the Shaka guide - mainly because it has the traditional, full loop, and reverse loop options.  Being slightly adventurous we did the full loop.  I can tell you that there is a road that goes all the way around and there were others doing the same thing we were doing.  It's definitely unpaved and bumpy in a few areas but most cars will have no problem.  There is one stretch were the road runs along the cliffs and is narrow - take your time.  Once you are past that you will many more things along the southern side of the mountain that I didn't know existed.  Many locals we spoke to suggested doing the reverse loop - maybe next time for us so we can do the hike at Oheo gultch.  Plan for a full long day and make sure to download the app and make sure you have a car charger for your phone before you go.  Water shoes will be helpful, some of the typical sites along the way will also benefit from hiking sandals you have them."
260,Definitely worth it,"We were lucky enough to get to do the Road to Hana before they closed it with the virus.  We did download the Shaka guide absolutely loved it.  The app helped us stop at places we would not of known about.  We did do the whole loop - was very doable.  This is an all day trip with lots of hair pin turns and one lane roads so be prepared but the views, waterfalls, and beaches make it all worth it.  Would highly recommended."
261,November trip,"Aloha, I heard alot about the road to Hana, so I had to try it. Definitely not for me. I live in the Pacific NW and we have our own rain forest, it honestly felt like being at home but warmer. I personally came for the sand and blue/warm water, not back to a rain forest. Others that want to go to that climate will differ and that's OK, just not for me.... I did drive the entire route, and that was interesting. Very narrow roads and lots of one ways. If you've driven alot in the mountains (logging roads) then really this is not a big deal. Give write of ways to locals and take it easy, it's a long drive. 5 hours for me with a few stops.  It's interesting how many climate changes you go through.... be safe, thanks for reading!Mahalo"
262,Expected More,"In preparation for our trip to Maui, we were perhaps a little intimidated by the stats for the Road to Hana: 52 miles long, has 617 switchbacks and 56 one lane bridges!!!!  We are certainly glad we did it, and here are our tips:* Leave early - we drove from West Maui and arrived in Paia (basically the start of the highway) around 7:30 or 8:00 am.  This is the best way to avoid heavy traffic* Plan your stops, by mile-marker. Research the places you want to stop, to avoid last minute turn-offs (which can be dangerous for you and others). We drove all the way to mile-marker 32 (Waianapanapa State Park) and then after touring the Park, headed back, stopping at mile-marker 16.5 to go down the (incredibly bumpy) offshoot road to Keanae, for a peek at the beach areas there.Our plan was to have one driver for the trip in, and switch drivers for the trip out. The driver is (or should be) paying close attention to the road, so can’t really take in the sights.  Switching off, allows a sharing of the driving and sight seeing.I have a tendency to get motion sickness easily and never felt that way; however, I was with my trusted driver.  Perhaps travel on a bus may be different?* Use the pull-out areas. There are many small areas alongside the highway, where you can simply pull over.  Use these, not only for sight-seeing, but to pull over, to allow those driving faster than you (mostly locals) to pass you safely.  * Respect the signs. When approaching one of the many one-lane bridges, you will see a sign telling you to yield to oncoming traffic - respect those signs and drive defensively, so that your trip will be enjoyable and safe!"
263,They aren't lying...,"We left Kaanapali Beach at 7:30am and returned there by 8:30pm. Definitely took us over 12 hours. We did the backside also in a loop and that part was a bit scary. Just drive slow and be careful but you will have an experience of a lifetime! This was just incredible. If we go back Maui—I will absolutely do this again but I would leave by 6:30am. Highly recommend downloading the Shaka app as the guide will tell you everywhere to stop, where to park, how long it takes to get to each stop—if it’s a 2 mile hike or .4 to get to a waterfall."
264,"You MUST do this in Maui; it's an awesome, beautiful, thrilling 12 hours","Road to Hanna is a Must do journey full of amazing waterfalls, incredible ocean overlooks, and mountains in lush rainforests. Don't drive it yourself. It's a 5-hour drive full of single-lane bridges, sharp curves (some blind), and steep zig-zagging. It can be a dangerous drive if you take your eyes off of the road so take a guided tour to enjoy the views."
265,Scary but just beautiful.. worth it,"My wife and I were very lucky to be able to make the Road to Hana before everything was closed due to Coronavirus. The ride whether you make the full loop around or turn back at Hana , is an all day affair which requires an attentive and hardy driver(s). The “road” has may easily accessible spots (waterfalls, beaches, ocean) and roads to views where you can mostly just pull up, park and view. But the road itself is full of stop and go, tight turns, and one lane bridges. With all of this,it is definitely a trip to make. As a note the road conditions after Hana, more so Haleakalā National Park, are rough for the next 10 plus miles. Once past the rough area the road is nice and you do see some very nice views."
266,Could’ve skipped it,"The was the second time we drove the road to Hana; the first with our adult children.  It was an all day journey as we took our time to stop at 3-4 spots on our way to Hana and 3-4 different spots on the way back to Paia.  We also tried the banana bread at 4 different spots (there are dozens of places selling banana bread along the way) and enjoyed them all.  However, the best part of the drive were the various points to enjoy the shoreline, cliffs, waterfalls, and other natural vistas.  The highlight was the black sand beach in Waianapanapa State Park...well worth the stop and take a quick dip in the ocean."
267,Hana highway,We drove the ‘half’ Hana to the Ke’anea Peninsula. We didn’t start at the crack of dawn ( as all the guidebooks propose) but started about 2.30pm. We finished at 5.30pm. The traffic was sparse although on the return journey the locals drive home & one was seriously abusive & most drive considerably faster than the recommended 15mph that no one seems to adhere to. Most drive at 25mph but the locals come roaring round the corners so watch out. You have been warned. We had read extensively about this trip ( & about how many blind corners there are / single land bridges etc) & although the scenery was dramatic in places the hype of the road didn’t deliver for us but we did only drive half way. Do buy the GYPsy app which will informatively talk throughout the journey although I wouldn’t recommend relying on this app exclusively for directions. I would recommend a whale watch trip or a trip to Pa’ai ( to watch the turtles ) or a trip to see Lahaina or Wailea rather than drive this road. It seems a marketing exercise to promote the other side of the island. The driving is incredibly difficult & the roads so windy that some people do need anti sickness  pills. If you’re thinking of driving around  the whole island ( the road at the ‘back side’ of Maui ) check with your rental car first. That road is billed as even worse & some car rental companies won’t let you drive that way. Good luck if you decide to do this drive.
268,Must Do Once,We did a day trip from Wailea past Hana and all the way to Waiki falls. We left at 8.30 and we were back at 6.30 (10 hours).The drive out was nice as we were close to the mountain and it was early in the day with a couple of fascinating stops.The drive back was pretty scary as we were close to the cliff and the road past Hana doesn’t always have a rail. It was also pouring.Narrow road with lots of blind corners and careless drivers (impatient locals and inexperienced tourists)I would not do it again or recommend it as I was concerned about our safety which took away from the beauty of the drive and stops.
269,Road to Hana,"After hearing about this for 20 years, I finally was able to make the trip with my wife and teenagers. We left early on New Year’s Day and had an excellent time. I’d suggest going past Hana about 30-45 minutes for the 7 Pools. Definitely worth it. Also would suggest the voice app Gypsy as a tour guide. It really got us to the places we wanted to go and narrowed down what could have been an overwhelming number of choices."
270,Beautiful lush green route to Hana,"My husband and I set aside a day and set out early to start our road trip to Hana.  A narrow winding road where many times you are required to wait for traffic when crossing the little bridges and passes, this trip is nevertheless a worthwhile adventure with lovely stops along the way - in our case, past Hana to the Pīpīwai Trail.  The lush rainforest and beautiful vistas were everywhere.  Be sure to go with a full tank in Paia before starting the journey, as there are food stops along the way but it fuel.  Life and simplicity in enjoying what natural beauty that is Maui is all along this East side of the island, as opposed to the West side - arid and dry after the trade winds have dumped the moisture on the East.  This road trip is the essence of Maui!"
271,Be patient!,"I'll admit I was wary of taking the Road to Hana on our own instead of with a tour. It was so totally worth it! We saw so many things and could spend as much or as little time at each location as we wanted. The waterfalls, beaches, hikes, banana bread, shrimp trucks, everything was amazing. The hairpin turns and one lane bridges took a little getting used to but by an hour in, we were so used to it that it was a relaxing drive"
272,Do this and check it off your bucket list !,"This is a nightmare if you are the driver.....don’t bother...go to the beach or spend the day around Paia, full of pleasant shops and restaurants.   The views over the ocean and the waves are great, but don’t waste the day going to Hana.   Your passengers will appreciate not getting car sick either"
273,Worth Doing Once,"At some point I'll do it again, but we all agreed that next time we'd stay the night in Hana and enjoy the same road back the next day. It's beautiful and it's exhausting. Don't rush it if you don't have to. Remember, 620ish switchbacks one-way becomes 1240 returning, and in the dark."
274,GO WITH EASY RIDER TOURS!!!,"The “Road to Hana” was a bit too treacherous for my liking. Don’t get me wrong the views were gorgeous but the entire drive we had to be careful with slippery roads, falling rocks and narrow turns. Make the journey to paradise safe. Drive slow. Be cautious and alert."
275,Overhyped,We were traveling with our two young grand children 3.5 and 1 year old. We downloaded the Gypsy Guide - the best 10 bucks we spend - we had read up a lot about the trip and what things were must do’s. It was an amazing ride - a bit long for the kids but they were troopers -we took a lot of water and snacks etc . The water falls at the start of the tour were not as great as the ones at the higher elevations .It was rather dry in November when we visited.
276,Whoa,"My husband and I made the trip 14 years ago, but wanted to make sure our adult children had the experience while we were here with them. It is a full day if you want to spend any time at any of the stops.We got a later start than we had hoped as staying in Kapalua makes everything a little further away. We used the “Gypsy Guide” app which was very helpful and kept us on track to see lots of waterfalls. We packed a lunch and drove all the way to the National Park past Hana. The pools were closed to swimming, so it was a little disappointing after that long day of driving, but our daughter in law did get in one of the waterfalls along the way. Our son and daughter in law headed back another day to hike since we just didn’t have enough time the first day! Be patient and obey the rules around the bridges to stay safe!"
277,Wow! One curvy drive!,"We did the road to Hana a few days back on a Saturday. It's the most lush, green route I've ever driven and I would strongly recommend it. The road itself is a state highway in very good condition with good asphalt, markings and signage. It has a very large amount of twists and sharp turns, as well as a number of narrow bridges where you'll have to yield to traffic coming the other way. However, none of this is a problem for an experienced driver as long as you take your time and go slow. I would strongly recommend that you have two drivers alternating as it is a long way to Hana. You should definitely stop at Coconut Glen's and buy some ice cream!The real fun (read: terror) starts when you pass Hana to go to the Kipahulu state park. After Hana, the state highway ends and the road beyond is in much worse physical condition (though still paved). It is also narrower and generally more difficult to navigate, especially dealing with oncoming traffic of which there was lots on our way back. However when you do finally get to Kipahulu, you can hike up the Pipiwai trail to the bamboo forest which is a great sight. Admission is $25 but this is valid for three days and also gives you access to the summit of the mountain Haleakala which is also a great sight."
278,"Ok, if you have enough time","Wow, this is amazing! We still have great memories. Can’t wait to return for another trip! Love the atmosphere. Perfect vacation! Thanks to Trip Adviser!"
279,Dangerous!,"We went through Road to Hana multiple times in the past visits. This time the road was majorly improved and actually pleasant. This road is NOT FOR EVERYONE. If you have any kind of motion sickness, be prepared before you hit the road. Or, if you are NOT COMFORTABLE to drive in slippery narrow curvy roads, do everybody a favor, go on a tour bus. This is NOT the place to show off your “manhood” driving fast with a sports car(or a Jeep). This time we saw more tourists driving “not that safe” on this road. I also feel like some locals may be fed up with this. So One Star minus for the “crazy drivers”on the road.There are tons of attractions to stop on this road, make sure your car parked at a Off road safe spot, do not block any part of the main road. Especially by the narrow bridges with the water falls. You may also share the road with some big trucks, they are skilled but do need more space, so be careful if you encounter any. Be aware that honking your horn at some blind spots are necessary, to warn the up coming traffic from the opposite side. Some tourists clearly don’t understand this safety code and prefer to yell at each other instead.  There are many small shops and food spots on the road(as pictures shown), fresh fruits stands. The Kasakote hut has amazing fresh made bread and dry fruits(picture 1 & 2), that auntie and her animals are awesome. Bring enough Cash.Again, safety is always the first priority. Driving through Road to Hana is not a accomplishment, it’s an experience.P.S: make sure to read through your car rental agreements before you hit some funky part of the road. Some part of the road is not allowed for rental cars. Just be cautious."
280,Take a day and do a leisurely drive,"My wife and I drove ourselves from Kaanapali along the Road to Hana.  It was a beautiful sunny day which added to our experience.We used the Gypsy App which gave us great insights and alerted us to the best sites and experiences.  While this was my fourth or fifth visit having the app was a great addition.It is an interesting drive and you want to be focused and alert.  But if you go slow and take it easy it can be a great day.  This is really about the journey rather than a race to Hana.We stopped in several places along the way including the Garden of Eden, several waterfalls, Kaenee Peninsula, Wainanapanapa State Park (which is the black sand beach and lava tubes. The Garden of Eden was surprisingly good and a peaceful respite in an otherwise busy day.  It had great views, food, clean restrooms, and easy hikes through beautiful trees and plants.  I always enjoy the black sand beach as it is quite unique for me.Leave early.....go slow......stop often.......get an app.  If you do that you will have a great time."
281,A must do with several great stops!,"DO NOT DO THIS TRIP ON YOUR OWN! Your rental car won't let you go all the way around the island, and you definitely need to experience the entire highway. Also, you don't want to navigate this road if you've never done it before. Yes, it's curvy; yes, there are one lane bridges galore; but the experience is fantastic. There are plenty of things to see along the way. Don't bother with swimming in the waterfall pools. Save the swimming for the black sand beaches if it's a good day. Take your camera and your dramamine."
282,The Road to Hana,"Always wanted to do the Road to Hana but with three passengers, two of whom get car sick, needed a good tip-ginger chews. Picked them up at local market in Maui. Did the trick. 620 curves and 59 bridges later made it to Hana w/o issue. This is definitely a “journey is the destination” trip as Hana is nothing special. Best to drive a Jeep, don’t do this road in huge SUV or minivan, road narrows in sections. Do go a little further and hike the Pipiwai trail. Download Shaka Guide app/tour. Very helpful tip for things to see/do/skip. Stunning scenery."
283,Warning,"This is an all-day drive.  The road was not as bad as I expected, but I also was not driving.  There are many spots to stop and view or hike, so I suggest doing some research in advance to decide what interests you.  Very few amenities along the way, so bring snacks and water, and fill up gas at the start.  We continued past Hana to complete the loop instead of turning around.  The road was narrow, but there was also much less traffic."
284,A really nice trip,We had a blast all the way! Several years ago we made the same trip and it brought back wonderful memories! 🏖🌴🥰 This time we’re doing it again 😋 Hana means craft or work hand and hand. The Hawaiians are amazing gentle people. Hana is friendly!
285,A day long excursion,"Hana means craft or work. And to know the Hawaiians, the two go hand in hand. As the world goes around, the meaning of Hana is all those things."
286,Road to Hana Day Trip,"We initially did not plan to drive all the way to Hana. We went to Twin Falls, which was amazing for our 11 and 7 yo kids - they had a blast looking at plants, enjoying a food stand where we got a coconut water and drinks. We pursued further after the falls to see what's ahead. What we did not account for is cellular coverage. We relied on our cell phone GPS and did not have a map, which would have been very helpful in knowing at least where we are and how far we are from next scenic stop.Definitely worth driving, but very careful on serpent roads, take the drive only in good weather conditions, have a full tank of gas and plenty of water and snacks!"
287,Awesome Day Adventure! Yes do drive this and take your time.,"This was our second time driving the road to Hana, and will never disappoint. Its seems that each time you drive the winding road, there are new things to see.  Be sure to take your time and plan on spending the entire day on the road. Make sure to pack sandwiches and drinks. Ours kids are 12 and 9, and they loved every minute. They especially loved swimming on Black Sand Beach."
288,Quintessential experience ,"We landed at OGG at 3:30pm and by the time we left for Hana it was 5pm.  We averaged  about 15 mph to Paia.  It was almost dark when the fun started.  If you only remember one thing about Hana, it is do not try to drive there at night.  It was 2.5 hours of wife screaming steering wheel gripping heart pounding terror.  Where's the tylenol?"
289,WOW! not for the faint of heart.,"The Road to Hana represents a quintessential Hawaiian experience, with lush vegetation and delicious fruit along the way. My husband drove, which was a bit scary given the 600+ curves on the road and 50+ one way bridges. Further, the locals tend to tailgate you, so it's best to just move to the side so they can pass. Our experience was made that much better by utilizing the Shaka Guide app (which someone on another tour we did recommended we download). Shaka Guide did not need 3G access, but it was able to determine where we were on the Road to Hana and provided tips on awesome detours to take or where best to park to see certain attractions. Had we not utilized this app, I don't think we would have had as fruitful of an experience, and I definitely would have been more stressed out trying to provide driving directions. Definitely recommend experiencing the Road to Hana while you're in Maui!"
290,Make it a day.,"The day was overcast and threatening with downpours when we were picked up on time at 7.00 a.m. by our local guide Jaime from MahaloTours. She was cheerful, full of information had us on the way with a minimum of fuss. There was 7 of us on our trip, we stopped for breakfast, got to know each other and under Jaimes watchful eye we started our journey. The rains came which made all the waterfalls overflow with breathtaking surging power.I'm glad we had an experienced local driver in Jaime as she handled the minibus with aplomb as we made our way around the 600+ bends and the one-way bridges that were built over 100 years ago by the Japanese workers. It is a testimonial to their ingenuity and workmanship that the bridges are still standing. We stopped for a scrumptious lunch, fish or pork ribs or vegetarian, they cater for all. It was an incredible time great fun was had by all well worth taking the trip, don't drive yourself as you won't enjoy it as much, take Mahalo Tours and ask for Jaime she will make your day and look after your safety as well."
291,Going against the norm and saying how much I didn't like this!,"They call this road, the road that leads to divorce, and after doing it twice, I can see why.  It’s a narrow road full of mainly Tourists, driving cars they aren’t familiar with, that has 59 one way bridges (some you can’t even see who is coming in the other direction) and nearly 600 hairpins bends, again some you can’t even see who is coming around the corner.  It can turn into a bit of a nightmare on really busy days (which we experienced).The scenery is good, and if you love hiking and waterfalls, then you are in heaven....However if you live in Australia and have done the Great Ocean Road or even a trip up to any of the hinterlands west of Brisbane or North Queensland. You’ve done the Road to Hana.We also stayed in Hana. If you like very small towns that close up at 7pm with not much happening, this is your place.  If not...the amount you pay for the accom is not worth it.  Unless you love hiking, waterfalls etc then spend the money that you would spend on hiring the car on a helicopter tour and see if from the air."
292,Road to Hana- Heaven and Hell... thieves,"Ok. The 1st 2 times on the road to hana was over 5 years ago. I'm sorry to say that there have been changes! People have settled along the road, built houses, big houses. There are alot of private property signs & no trespassing signs. This has really spoiled the natural beauty of the drive. Used to be we could enjoy this journey. But this time was our last time. I just know there will be a 7-11 at the halfway to hana stop!We did stop at the halfway to hana roadside, got some great banana nut bread & pulled pork sandwiches that were wonderful!"
293,Great experience to drive if you are skilled driver!,"We drove the road to Hana on a somewhat rainy mid-January weekday...turned out to be a great time to avoid the crowds, which relatives told us could get crazy at times. There are a number of one-lane bridges, and somewhere around 600 turns, but the views and flora are fantastic."
294,"Beautiful, nerve wracking drive",I actually didn't go here last year it was several years ago but we enjoyed it so much I decided I would still review it. The road is very treacherous and dangerous but it was so much fun driving it dont let someone else do it for you be adventurous. There are several small towns you pass through on the way where you can get a shaved ice and a spam sandwich. Make sure you leave early and have a full tank of gas there is no where to get gas on the road until you reach Hana. Also if its raining hard dont go save it for another day you want to enjoy the waterfalls at the end.
295,Be prepared to be away for most of the day.,"This is my favorite drive in all of the Hawaiian islands.  The beauty along the way is unimaginable.  The roads are narrow and very curvy, so if you get car sick, make sure you manage this before you get in a car.  There are very few areas where you can pull off safely.  The road up to the city of Hana is easy to navigate, after Hana it becomes more difficult to drive, with many blind curves that will only fit one car at a time and this is a 2 way highway.  I find it best to go early in the morning and allow yourself an entire day.  You will want to make multiple stops and see everything.  You will see more and better waterfalls if there has been rain.  We go early in the morning and the waterfalls and rivers are abundant, but by the time you drive back (if you go back the way you came) you will see drive river beds with the most amazing rock formations.  There are many hikes along this route and there are MANY fresh water swimming holes, so bring your gear and don't forget your sunscreen.  This ride is especially fun in a convertible as long as you will drive with the top down.  Be ready for sudden showers, they rarely last long and you are dry by the next curve in the road, but having the top down and being totally exposed to the elements is phenomenal.  Look all around you and over your head.  You will see wild fruit growing in trees, birds and Mongoose running across the street."
296,Long drive bust worth it,"It seems to be by far the minority who do the Reverse Route to Hana. It is one of the options listed in Shaka Guide which I highly recommend. There are so many amazing stops to choose from throughout the day that you have to be strategic about which ones  to pick. Unfortunately you can't do it all in a day. SG was helpful in deciding.For us, Pipiwai and the black sand beach were the highlights. If you do the clockwise road to Hana from Paia, you likely won't get to Pipiwai until late after a VERY long day. You may not have enough time to enjoy the magical hike through the bamboo forest ending with the 400' waterfall!Read Dec. 4 review, ""Do It"". Hilarious and very informative. Couldn't agree more!"
297,Beautiful drive around Maui through Hana,"Yes, this is a very windy road. But if you have some time, it's worth it. Just go until you see a waterfall you want to check out then try to figure out a way to park safely. No need to go all the way to Hana since there's not much there. But if you stay at the Travaasa resort, Hana is Heaven on earth."
298,Not a Must Do,"We set out on the road to Hana early in the morning from Napili. We went basically the wrong way round, down through Wailea as we were advised to avoid the traffic. The road was empty! The scary unmade roads along the side of the cliffs were not scary at all, a little bumpy, but it was a short stretch before you hit tarmac again. The advantage of doing it this way is you don’t have to queue behind other traffic to see the beauty spots. We were on the other side of the road, or sometimes the best side for some of the views. It only got busy down around Hana. We stopped a couple of times to hike up to waterfalls and to see the seven sacred pools. We also had some delicious banana bread in the little shop right by the Welcome to Hana sign. It is a must do trip, stunning scenery, breath taking waterfalls. The only scary part was  2 episodes of shouting and rudeness from some of the locals who object to tourists stopping to take pictures of the sights!"
299,Lush Rainforest,"I only heard about the Road to Hana a few years ago, but wasn't able to drive it before.  We did some reading up on the sites that are available to see on the trip.  We started out a bit rough on figuring out exactly where we were but once we got going it was easy to negotiate.  We took our time and pulled over to let other cars pass us so we could enjoy the scenery.  We stopped at several waterfalls and waded in two.  We also enjoyed some of the famous banana bread, I can't remember the name but the one in most of the guide books.  We stopped at several beaches and really enjoyed one of the black sand beaches where we ate the lunch we packed in the park.  We turned around at Hana and pretty much drove straight back.  Near the end of the drive back we got behind a very slow car who had 10 or so cars backed up but never pulled over.  That was pretty annoying!  The road is very windy & very narrow."
