0,Climbing Le Morne,"It was a great experience to climb le Morne. It was hard but with the great view, it is worth a trip to go for. 😊"
1,Great experience,"Amazing hike and experience.Great view and definately worth it.It is very rewarding to hike up a tricky path and know what awaits you as soon as you reach the very top.Must go with a guide,it is obligatory and don't be afraid to spend the money. We highly recommend our guide who's name is Devin who is originally from the Island and is a great personality."
2,Great view when you've reach the top.,"What a great experience! The climb to the top does make few muscles to feel the burn, but the views you have to see for yourself. Sitting on the top of Barbant, birds are flying beneath you, it is truly spectacular!Our guide Henri made sure everyone is happy all the way up, going at the pace to suit everyone in our group, giving us helpful tips to the less experienced hikers on how to manage certain areas a bit easier.You have to be relatively fit to make it all the way to the top. Good views before the tougher climb too, so even if you don't reach the top, it is still well worth the go. In places nearer the top, you do need to be able to support your weight with your upper body as well as stepping up, to hoist yourself over some of the rocks. This would not be easy for the couch potato kind folks.I don't have a good head for heights, but didn't get vertigo at any point, despite the heights you get to and when looking down on the views.Bring 1L of water per person, water will be offered to you to take in your bag by the guides at the starting point if you didn't bring enough. Energy bar, sugar source, apple or whatever fuel of your choice would be a good idea to bring too. Most important, wear good shoes for the job. Go for it and enjoy it!"
3,Hiking at Le Morne,Booked this with yanature and was a great tour. The views from the top are stunning and the hike/climb is challenging enough that you feel like you achieved something great when reaching the top.
4,Once in a lifetime view,"Le Morne hike is amazing, the climb it's self is tricky in places and not for people who are afraid of heights as some parts you feel like it just drops away but the view is amazing even from just below the top part, where there are benches to sit and take in the sights. We climbed it without a guide, my partner has done it twice now, just remember to take plenty of water and start early before it gets to warm. The day we went there were heaps of colourful butterflies around which added to the beautiful scenery."
5,Early birds,We went on an excursion to Le Morne mountain. The view from the top is beautiful. It took us 1 hour and 45 minutes to climb only. But it was worth it.
6,Hiking,"Although we didn't do the full climb, just getting to the halfway point provides wonderful views and is certainly far up enough to go in the heat! We did find it difficult to get to the carpark, and the road to it is not in the best condition, but once there it really is a treat!"
7,Hard but worth it,"The easier climb not to the very top! Nevertheless beautiful and worth doing!Our guide was amazing and told us a lot of interesting facts about Mauritius, it's history and all the plants and trees on our way up!"
8,Amazing view,Hiking le morne brabant was a great achievement. You need a good guide who knows the path well as it gets very steep near the top.One needs to be fit and wear good shoes for this climb.
9,So worth the sweat!,Nice trek (and quite challenging the last bit of it) but worth seeing the bay from the top! Very interesting history too.
10,Must visit for adventurers!,"Hiking at Le Morne is easy anyone and do it, but getting to the top that is really something else. If you can make it to the top you will not be disappointed by the breathtaking view your eyes will catch."
11,Too dangerous ,"We are not skilled hikers, so we reached the first point! Nice ride! I am happy that I was able to follow up the rest of the (skilled) group, the paths sometimes have quite an inclination! Better not carry too many things with you...!"
12,nice mountain,The concierge at the hotel said the hike was easy but in reality it's a challenging climb in the latter part of your journey to the top.We found the challenge well worth it. The views throughout the hike were amazing and it was great to see Mauritius outside the posh hotels.Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable.I highly recommend doing this trip if you are not scared of heights and open to a little physical challenge.
13,Mountain Hiking ,Climbing this heritage of Mauritius was an honour and the view at the very top is amazingly breath taking.  i highly recommend people to go there at least once in their life.
14,Couple with 6 month old,"The climb has the perfect balance of fun and challenges along the way, we certainly enjoyed it very much. We climbed with my 7 month old baby in a carrier and we had the best time! Wear appropriate shoes, take water and sunscreen."
15,Morning hike up La Morne ,"The area and views are fantastic, and the climb to the cross is worth it.  The climb to the top is not difficult, you just need to be careful.  I would rate it a challenging beginner.   Wear shoes with adequate ankle support and gloves for your hands.  The top at the cross gets windy in the afternoon. If you have trouble with balance or heights, do not attempt the climb.  On my climb, I have seen native mauritian teenagers do the climb barefoot and navigate the rocks like graceful mountain goats. Do not attempt to replicate their feats."
16,A way ti discover Le Morne,I couldn't do the trekking but the approach and surrounding areas are beautiful. One must undertake this hike if possible. This mountain is deeply attached to the heritage and history of Mauritius.
17,"Le Morne Brabant, is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The world symbol of the fight of the slaves for survival.","Le morne brabant...worlds end, stunning place with an incredible view.  The climb is quite rough so be prepared. Carry plenty of water and make sure to wear good hiking shoes.All the look out are out of this world.  Heaven was truly copied after mauritius was created:)"
18,All You Need to Know about Hiking Le Morne,"It's a fairly hard going walk.  I was really sweating!  But it was fun and the views were stunning.  We did the walk with Yanature who have the rights to take you up to the top (there's a locked gate so most independent walkers can only go half way up, I think).  They were very good and I recommend them.  The walk took about 3 hours from start to finish.  My kids (14 and 12) found it pretty easy!"
19,Great hike with stunning views,The hike to Le Morne Brabant was one of the best experiences in Mauritius. The place offers breathtaking views along the trail and at the top. The trip was well organised by our guide Alan who was helpful and motivating all throughout. It was definitely an unforgettable experience.
20,Life Long Memory,"The hike was beautiful and breathtaking. However, with no ropes for those who are scared of heights the sharp drop-offs may be too daunting. However, if I can overcome my fear than so car you. The summit it great, cool, and relaxing."
21,One of the best experiences on the island ,"The mountain is a nice straight forward hike until you reach the green gates, after thats it involves a degree of climbing. If your expecting a sedate morning of walking then this wouldn't be suitable at all. you need to be quite fit and able to make it to the top!"
22,Great hike!,"It was quite a challenge getting to the very top, however it was completely worth it, the views are stunning and the sense of achievement is fantastic.You don't need to be an expert climber, but you do really need to be switched on and aware - a lady on our excursion slipped and went over on her ankle, ultimately making it extremely hard climbing down.I would recommend going early before the sun is at it's hottest. Also take plenty of water, a decent pair of shoes (with good grip and won't rub) and obviously a camera.It was probably the hardest climb I've ever done, but probably the highlight of my vacationLastly, you need a tour guide to actually access the very top. If you go alone, there is a locked gate and no way through. We booked through mauritiusattractions and the guide, Alex, was experienced, helpful and could speak English and French."
23,Beautiful Views,"Climbing this mountain is a fantastic experience - not only are the views awesome, but the sense of achievement is a great feeling. Regarding the difficulty - here is my take on it:- I am not very fit - i would be classed as average fit in some countries, and certainly below average in other countries like Netherlands etc. - I found that the climbing did not test me physically much - at no point did i struggle with the strength or stamina needed to climb - partly as the guides mostly are happy to wait and take breaks. - What was difficult was how treacherous the rocks are to climb in the steep areas - you need to be careful about where to put your feet, and often ignore the fact that you are pretty high up a steep, 70 degree wall. - Towards the top, some of the paths are narrow - someone suffering from vertigo may struggle with some of this, but not a problem for others. - Go with a guide - you can do it without but with the steepness and complexity of the rocks, i would go with a guide, atleast the first time. - Make sure you have good grippy shoes for this - i had them and climbing up teh steep rocks was significantly more comfortable with them. So all in all, unless you are pretty unfit, u wont be stretched physically - you will however be stretched mentally and with your balance and stability as you climb up the rock portions. Absolutely worth a try though - if you cannot do it, you can always turn down and wait for the guide at the previous waiting point."
24,Great CLIMB,"Just back from hike with Nicholas and Henri, they were great guides and the route is beautiful. Would recommend..........."
25,Adventurous walk/ climb,"It is worth getting off the beach and hiking up Le Morne not only for the spectacular views but to remember a unhappy period on what now, thankfully, seems to be a very happy island."
26,"Great hike, awesome guides",...to the top of the mountain. Not quite easy but worth the effort! You have a wonderful view over the south of the island. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Mauritius.
27,Amazing views,"Climb to the top can be a tiring and for some even scaring experience, but the view on the top is worth every drop of sweat!Unforgettable."
28,The most amazing views - well worth the hard work,"Amazing view on top!You can simply not miss this hike. It is fairly easy and can be done in 3 hours.It did request some climbing to reach the top, but that was part of the adventure.No need for any guide, as the trail is clear and well set up. Just make sure you're not very  far from from people (if you're going there alone), so that in case you feel lost/tired, someone can give you a hand.Very worth it.Mother nature..."
29,Nice Walk Up Le Morne,"We hiked up to the top of Le Morne with Bryn from Explorers Mauritius, he was a great guide. The views were spectacular and it was very worthwhile. I would not recommend going to the top without a guide unless you are very experienced and have appropriate mountain insurance"
30,A hike worth doing! ,"It was a tiring climb - my friends and I took 4 hours to complete the hiking and took lots of photos! We did not follow a guide. All we had to do was to sign in (log book at the entrance for your safety) and off we went! The gate was unlocked the day we went so all was fine. I would suggest wearing long pants as almost immediately past the gate, you start climbing with your hands and legs - somewhat like bouldering. If you're not confident, I  would suggest getting  a guide to help you with your feet and hands placement. The views made the climb all worth it!"
31,"If visiting Mauritius, this is a must visit.","Beautiful views! Most of the hike is a comfortable walk. You can walk most of it without being an experienced climber. But to get to the top needs closed shoes with a very  good grip and perhaps some rock climbing experience. I would recommend caution (or avoidance) for the rocky bit (right at the top). Also recommend pants that cover knees if you plan to get to the top as the route turns from being a hike to a rock climb where you need to get on your knees to get up and again to get down.You can still enjoy the hike and the views by doing only the ""comfortable walk up"" without doing the caged off area. The walk is best on a dry sunny day. If there is any sort of moisture, do not touch the rock bit as it is slippery and dangerous. I recommend you carry some water and drink it slowly as there are no vendors along the route. Also ask your driver to drive into the park, right up to  the point where you need to sign-in in order to avoid a 1.5km walk just to get to the start."
32,Highly dangerous. Don't do it,"It's a beautiful trek overlooking the le Morne lagoon and the views from the top(not the actual top) are fantastic. The route to the top is officially blocked due to safety reasons. It was difficult to stop at the barrier, wanted to jump it and go on. Important to access this trek from the official entrance which is past the kite lagoon if you are coming from the north. The other entrance is through private property and you might land up being harassed or having to pay. The trek is free and you do not need a guide."
33,Amazing views!,"We went up with Matthieu from yanature and it was an amazing hike! Hard, some serious climbing bits (which are a lot of fun) but we felt safe and looked after the whole time. Matt did everything to keep us safe and have us plenty of rest breaks. So worth the view!"
34,Memorable,"The hike was one of the best ones I have ever done, with the view all along the way amazing. The view at the top is 360degrees and is worth every muscle ache at the end. Yan, our guide was super nice and really helpful. Definitely recommend doing it again, but not for the unfit! The last third is all scrambling on rock. But still really fun. We did it in 3hrs return."
35,A work out but worth it for the views and the history,"The hike to the gate was relatively easy, although it is a steady climb which might be challenging for people who are not physically fit. The climb to the top includes some scrambling/climbing and previous experience and attention would be recommended. Worth it for the amazing views!"
36,Very thought provoking,"The place has a great history to tell. Impressive to be there..Nice scenery also, and from the beach on the othere side (Le Morne Beach) you can get some impressive views and fotos."
37,Not an easy climb but well worth the views! Not for the faint hearted!,This is an amazing Hike. A 2 hour hike with some challenging vertical climbs. Although definitely reachable for an amateur.The views all the way up are simply breathtaking. You see the whole South Coast and I would recommend stopping at each of the look out points to take in the different views which are beautiful.And the view upon reaching the top is well worth the wait!!!
38,Rough Road to the Le Morne Brabant Parking Lot,ask Allan to take you on a hike up le morne Brabant. it was challenging but well worth the views from the top.  Take hiking boots - trainers are slippery as we encountered a few times.  Something very worthwhile doing.
39,Heritage,"It’s a great hike for people who are experienced in steep and technically-challenging hike. I would compare it to the Skeleton Gorge trail up Table Mountain in Cape Town, so a medium-to-difficult level hike. Don’t do it if you’re an inexperienced hiker, it’s not a inclined stroll. The first part is easy, but once you get to the signpost warning of dangerous terrain ahead, it becomes much more difficult. You can still stop there and still get a good view, it’s worth it."
40,Nature!,"This trip was definitely worth the money and time, we are not experienced climbers, but our guide was superb in helping us up and down the steep climb, the views are breathtaking from the top, but this trip is not for the faint hearted,,,,but push yourselves and you will be amazed what you can achieve !!"
41,Excellent,"This is a definite must if you stay in Le Morne, the views are amazing from the top !!!  You feel a real sense of achievement if you decide to go up the top section which I would describe as a rock climb more than I hike!We were picked up at 5.45 to start the hike at 6.00, we are so glad it was an early start as it was a lot cooler,  I do not think I could of done this hike in the mid day heat as the top part of the hike has no shade!!!Lots of water required and sensible shoes, our trainers were adequate !It took us 3.5 hours to get to the top and back down in a group, we used a guide (I would recommend using a guide not only for safety but for their knowledge and stories of the mountain) we used Yanature and our guide was Zak (who made the hike look easy, he probably could of run up and down it in less than an hour !)The trip cost 1500 Mauritian rupees!  Well worth it for the views!!!"
42,You gotta earn it!,"What a climb and what a view. Great experience and quite a physical one as well. Went up two times and both had its own charm. But remember to bring a lot of water, you will need it."
43,Amazing hike,"I am not going to write how amazing hike it is and how spectacular view is from the top - there are plenty of other people assuring you of that.  Instead, I will tell you briefly how to get there.  As my boyfriend and I stayed in the hotel up north, it was difficult for us to get to the peninsula early in the morning  to do it with the guide.  We arrived around midday.  As you drive around the peninsula take a turn into unpaved road to horse riding centre.  Pass the centre and carry on driving for about 1 km still on unpaved road till you see the red arrow on one of the trees on your left.  That's the place to start.  You will see the gate.  Cross it over.  Walk. Gate.  Cross it over.  Turn left into the wood.  Follow the trail- it's quite easy to see it. Use your common sense if there is a fork on the road.  You will pass one more gate but there will be the ladder to cross it. The trail  at first is through the meadow. It changes later into more difficult to alter completely into climbing almost upright.  Don't be put off.  We managed to get there and we have never done anything like that before. The finish point is were the metal cross is located.  Comfortable shoes,  lots of water is a must. It took us 5 hours to climb, rest, take photos and get back to the red arrow.  Do not park your car by the first gate after passing the red arrow.  Park it close to the surf kiting site and walk from there.  I know I wrote to  drive for 1 km but forgot to mention one thing. If you are going without the guide, you don't pay anything to anyone.  Some people will not be happy about it.  We found our car with the two wheels without the air.  We changed one wheel and  the second one was pumped at horse riding centre.  We were lucky it was open and people  helped us. Fortunately the "" bad guys "" were kind enough just to deflate the tyre note to damaged it. ☺☺☺ overall - fantastic experience ☺☺☺"
44,Not to be missed!,"Wonderful Trek.It was a challenging hike but worth it... It took 2.5 hours to get right uptop-  500 M above sea level and another hour or so to get back down with a guide from Yanature. It's not for the faint of heart. No helmets, no fancy climbing gear just hands and feet. The funny thing is that I'm really bad at fake wall climbing (my fingers go numb and it really hurts) but this stuff I can do! I'm not a pro but it's really cool and rewarding and most people can manage it if in in good health and willing to just do it!Go. It's such an important natural monument to the history of Maroonage (escaped slaves) in Mauritius. If you are a history buff get a historical tour and take your mind off the steepness of the cliff faces. It's well worth the climb to get the breath-taking view."
45,The best beach on Mauritius ;),"Climbing LE MORNE is an experience that is hard to put into words. You are in a beautiful environment and, when you reach the top, you feel incredible with the unbelivable view of Mauritius."
46,Nice hike great view,"A picture says more than 100 words. It was not an easy climb but with a positive attitude, you will nail it! The view on the top of the mountain is breathtakingly gorgeous and we had a great time learning all the new plants our guide showed us. I can not recommend it enough. Climbing with a guide is a must on your to do list if you are in this area. A tip: use both hands and feet for the second part of climbing!"
47,Unesco site,"Very rewarding. Hot but manageable walk gets you very close to the summit, with incredible views. Both guides were very helpful and informative."
48,Enchanting area with great hikes,We only went to the first viewpoint at 260m. There is a beautiful view and it only takes 25min to go up there. Not a difficult walk.
49,Best part of the island,"One of the best things you should do in Mauritius. The hike up is relatively challenging at an intermediate level. It is split into 2 parts. A generally uphill dirt road with some signboards and arrows along the way which ends at a shelter for rest and then a short walk up to a green gate which is locked. Just go around it and there’s a small path upwards. From then on, it is a lot of instinct and common sense as there is no clear path most of the time. You would have to use your hands to climb as well. There will be walking around cliffs too. For leisure hikers, stop at the shelter. You get a pretty decent viewpoint from there too. Many families bring their kids up to that point. For the more adventurous, go to the summit. It takes around 3 hours up and down. Definitely a must try in Mauritius to get a complete view of the island. Let the photos speak for itself."
50,Amazing views and great experience,"We had a great hike to Le Morne with fantastic views from the top! Yan (http://www.trekkingilemaurice.com/eng/) has been granted an exclusive access to this UNESCO World Heritage-listed site -as the trails are leading through private properties. Le Morne Brabant is a beautiful place with a sad history - don't forget to visit the Monument after the hike. The hike starts 6am as it gets hot very quickly (the hike takes approx 3hours in total) . Bring plenty of water and some snacks - and hiking boots/trainers- will make your climb much easier! Although i saw people climbing in flip-flops, i would not recommend it:)..The last bit is very steep, but Yan is an outstanding guide and will help you to the top! You will be rewarded with a magnificent scenery! Dont forget to bring your camera/gopro. Thank you Yan and Henri!:)"
51,Breathtaking views,"This was amazing, definitely worth the climb! We booked a guide at our hotel, it can be a bit tricky in some spots."
52,Definitely worth the effort ,"We took a guided hike up Le Morne Brabant (3h) with the excellent Yanature and as a result highly recommend a trip with Yan. Its a 6km round trip with almost 500m of climbing. Getting to the top without a guide could be a challenge as the path is not marked and the latter third of the climb is quite tough as you find yourself scrambling rather than walking.  On the tricky parts of the ascent and descent Yan gave us tips on the best way to climbThe views from the top are well worth the extertion. Not only do you feel a great sense of achievement but you get amazing 360 views of the south of the island which are spectacular on a clear day and you are guaranteed to get some stunning pictures. We were told of the significance of the mountain at the top and how the mountain is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Le Morne Brabant is a beautiful place, so even if you don't climb it you can appreciate it from below. If you are going to hike come first thing in the morning as it gets hot quickly, making an already pretty strenous climb even tougher."
53,Phenomenal Views!,"Please be aware that this is not a trek, it's a climb! While the views are stunning getting up there can seem dangerous, Not for the faint hearted at all."
54,Have to visit (see pictures),"We did the tour with Yanature. The guide was really knowledgeable and the hike was fantastic. Not too easy, not too hard. Incredible views at the top"
55,"Amazing hike, worth to go.",What a place!!! Amazing view to the blue bay. The First half of the trail is quite simple but the second one (at your own risk) is only for experienced mountaineers but the result is worth the effort.
56,"don't be afraid to reach to the top , it worths all the effort",This is a must when In Mauritius! It’s a rigorous hike with spectacular views along the way. Definitely worth the effort and fabulous way to get amazing pictures. It’s also free! You can take a taxi to the base/entrance or walk from the St Regis or other nearby hotels. Was a 2.5 hr hike round trip from the St Regis.
57,Dont look down !,We climbed Le Morne in the afternoon with a guide. A great trek with quite steep climbing. We brought our 10year old son - he was way faster than us! Excellent views almost 360. Great to have a local guide who can tell the history and knows every rock.
58,Great views ,"The Brabant dominates this area, plenty of walks and you can even hire a guide to walk up the rock!. Back in the days of slavery many fled to the rock for safety and escape the treacherous slavery that went on here in Mauritius, sadly when the good news was to be delivered to the hiding slaves upon the rock many through themselves of the top believing they were going to be captured. The rock is an amzing backdrop to the kilometres of beach here and the kite surfers and wind surfers look like matchstick men silhouetted agianst it whilst speeding across the ocean waves. There is a good walk along a dirt track taking you passed the original village of Le Morne, the shop, the Sega tree and a redundant Mauritian/Mozambique cemetry nestled next to the mangroves, an hour from the Riu hotel complex."
59,Lovely Hike!,"The hike took about 3.5 hours in total, it was very demanding in the hot weather but also a lot of fun. It’s really not easy towards the end, you need to crawl up parts, with quite a drop the other side. All the hard work is rewarded with the most incredible views from the top.Ensure you get to the top before mid day as clouds can come in and ruin the view - we made it just in time but felt bad for the people who arrived at the top to find fog and no view."
60,tough hike ,Absolutely gorgeous view from Le Morne Brabant! The way up to the top of the mountain might be tricky at times but with a guide it’s really easy and we felt safe during the whole climb. No professional equipment or climbing experience is needed to reach the top. Really worth your time in Mauritius 👌
61,It's worth the effort... ,We walked unguided up the mountain to enjoy spectacular views towards the top. I highly recommend starting early in the day as it gets quite hate. There is no need for a guide the climb is quite easy to follow. It starts on a road then becomes paths and rocky outcrops which are transversed with the assistance of ropes.
62,Worth the effort,"hiked up Brabant which has only become an unguided climb for one year its surprisingly easy and took us about 3 hours total from the gates, the ropes at the top were being fixed so we didn't get to do the end part. Still worthwhile, the views are stunning!!! It's quite shaded and the track is wide and well worn"
63,I wish I went to the top!,Easy walk at the beginning. The second half of the hike required more effort; but it is worthy! You will have an amazing view of the south of the country!
64,Beautiful views from South view point,Highly recommend hiking this with Yan from Trekking Ile Maurice - 6am start because of the heat but completely worth it for the amazing views from the top. Yan is a great guide with a good philosophy on walking!
65,Awesome views,"We hiked up to the top of La Morne Brabant yesterday and it was spectacular. We did go with a guide, Bryn from Explorers Mauritius who we thoroughly recommend, he was informative about the area, nature, history gave us some fabulous photos and most importantly where and how to climb safely! This is paramount, as it is definitely no walk in the park but to get to the top it was well worth the views and aching muscles! We had researched beforehand and brought our hiking boots, as there are some places which are physically exerting for non climbers like ourselves but trainers would be fine. We set off at 6:45 and took about 3hours to get up and down from the top. Any later than that you will find is extremely hot for the descent. If you don’t want to climb to the very top it is a relatively easy walk to the midpoint and you will also get some fantastic views. Enjoy !"
66,Nice view from the top!,Climbing to the top is a bit challenging for ordinary person but it's worth doing it. Half way through is a normal road and everybody can do it. View from there is also amazing. It's free and no need for tour guide just a water and some powerbars.My advice is do not go up to the top on a wet day
67,"Great day out , nice clinb for beginners","this was our first hiking ever, but we really liked it. it was really impressive to climb on this beautiful and historically rich mountain. our guide Allan was great, he explained us everything and made it easy us, and also whole tour talking about historical facts and things happenned in past on mountain. we will never forget this experience. thank you Allan!!"
68,Lovely part of Mauritius ,"Hiking at le morne is the best till now... had a great time, looking forward to go again and again...."
69,Beautiful view,"Had a fantastic morning with Zac our guide who took us and 4 others up this mountain. Amazing views, great climb, great guide. Highly recommend"
70,highly recommended,"had a great climb, especially the rock climbing part, you need some skills to do it to the top for a stunning view. worth it!! downhill is a little bit challenging, just make it slow & steady. Have FUN !!"
71,Boat trip,Absolutely worth a climbI went up with Ya Nature tours and we had a lovely guide who took us up the mountain. It is breathtaking to climb and has beautiful views at the top and en route. Couldn't recommend enough!
72,Most beautiful view!,Highly recommend trekking up Le Morne.. the views are just breathtaking. I would recommend some half decent footwear's with trainers as a minimum. If you are venturing further than the first point then I would say some good outdoor trekking shoes. Make sure you take some refreshments with you
73,Great hike with incredible views ,Great fun very informative would highly recommend.Our guide Alan was very good telling us about the history as we climbed.
74,Slaves suicide tool,"Le Morne hike is a must activity in Mauritius. Oh those views! After reading reviews here I expected it to be more challenging. I am not saying it's a gentle walk, that's not true at all. But if you're average fit, you won't have problems. As many reviews mention, the first half is a nature walk. The second half is a real hike where you need to use both legs and both arms as there are four climbing parts. We started at 6 am and were back down before 10 am, so the whole trip took about 4 hours. But this included 45 minutes pause at the top and several shorter breaks in the meantime. So the overall hiking time is much shorter than 4 hours. It was one of my best travel experiences, so make sure you don't miss it!"
75,We did not climb,There is a great new hiking track up the Le Morne mountain which offers amazing views of the South-Western part of the island. Worth the sweat!
76,"Amazing views, worth the effort","It was a wonderful hike up Le Morne Brabant. We were lucky that it was not sunny that morning, because it was quite hot even without sun. However, the view was still stunning. We had a very nice and motivated tour guide, Allan. He tells you all about the history of the people in Le Morne, their plants and how each plant can be used for healing - very interesting. It is a nice and relaxing hike. If you want to be fast, there are apparently two other guides who ""run"" up the mountain."
77,Absolutely amazing trip,"Differently worth a climb, we done it in trainers and were fine. Climbs not easy and has a few loose rocks around but worth it."
78,Better 10 years ago,"We had decided to hike the Le Morne Brabant long before we reached Mauritius and it turned out to be one of our best decisions. The hike was arranged with the help of our hotel - they enlisted the services of Alan, a local expert. For a first timer (me), the hike was challenging especially the bits where we have to go down on all fours. The rainy weather made it a little tougher - slippery. In fact I had not expected the hike to be as tough. By the way, I found it tougher on the way down! Alan is a great guide - motivating the group to move along with the history and stories of the mountain. The reward of this hike is the history of the mountain, the view from the top and the feeling of accomplishment. While, I wholeheartedly recommend Le Morne Brabant for anyone visiting Mauritius, I would definitely ask people to check their fitness before attempting this hike."
79,Breathtaking,A must background in any le morne photo. It is a national heritage site so now way to climb it. We looked but no public footpaths could be found. Hotel said you can hire a guide to take you up but we did not have time :(
80,Worth the view!,by far a beautiful view and you can seethe blue waters and also see the mountain rangers the whole island is fantastic and the local people wonderfull
81,Great view,"The first part is a moderately steep climb however the second has ropes placed so be prepared. However, we were well coaxed through the trip by Yan of Yanature who I have great admiration for. A few heights at the top but views over the whole south of the island including coconut island and more. I will definitely be back but needed a good rest afterwards."
82,Absolutely breathtaking...,"Probably the most beautiful hiking route on Mauritius. It takes about 4-5 hours to climb the mountain and return back, so I strongly recommend to start as early in the morning as possible. On the second half of the climb there's almost no shelter from the sun and no shadows, so take your sunscreen cream and some water with you. It is a good idea to take a small bottle of Gatorade or similar isotonic drink. The first half of the route is not exceptionally difficult - it is just a walk, so almost anyone can get to the 1st viewpoint. The second part needs some more fitness, so (from my point of view) is not suitable for children below 15 and people with health problems. There will be at least 2 small parts of the route when you will really have to climb.  This is one of the reasons, why it is better to go with a local guide who will explain what to do and make sure everything is safe. Above that, guide will explain you a lot about the history of the place + give some information about local flora and fauna. Closer to the top of the mountain you will feel really tired, but the view definitely worth your effort!"
83,Wonderful view,"We did our hike with Alexandre from Yanature and we could not have had a better guide. Such an inspiring young individual who is passionate for hiking and nature. I highly suggest anyone who intends to do this to go with Yanature unless you know what you are doing. I say this because the conditions vary depending on weather, which can make the hike a bit challenging and dangerous. It definitely helped us to have Alexandre guiding us and ensuring our safety. Safety comes first!"
84,"Amazing history, challenging hike, spectacular view","We took a walk up to Le Morne with Yanature Adventures and it was a real highlight of our trip to Mauritius. The walk itself is mildly challenging - you need to be of reasonable fitness and confident on rock as the final ascent is closer to rockclimbing than hiking. You'll be rewarded with stunning views of the area though - it's an extraordinarily beautiful and peaceful place, particularly in the early morning. It wasn't just the hard-won views that made this hike so special though, but the reverence that our guide, Yan, displayed for this special place. Here is a man who understands the world in which he lives and his history of Mauritius, calm and clear explanations about what to expect along the hike and passion for the great outdoors really made this trip very special. A winner!"
85,Adventure,"I did the hike with 3 others in Jan 2018. The hike took us 5 hours however that's because we had lots of breaks including a nice lunch with a view within a few metres from the top.First half (250m) is some inclined well done pathway however the second half (250m) is a very narrow climb which you share with people going up and down. It does involve both hands and feet.Guide is not necessary as the you can follow the path easily.Key items to bring: well vented clothing, hat, sunscreen, camera, lots lots of water"
86,One of the best hikes! Difficult but worth it!,"That incredible sight can be seen from the top of the mountain. The view from there is unbelievable. The ground half covered with the ocean and half with the tress.There was a big cross on top of the mountain. I crossed those big cliffs, those sliding rocks, that wailing wind, those trees thorns pricked in my flesh. I looked up at those clouds trying to fit themselves like a puzzle. Finally I made it after my struggles."
87,Hike ,excelent activity to see the island from a peak. very nice views from above and sportfull. recommended!!!
88,Epic walk/climb! Without guide- eek!,Been here with yanature... amazing experience!! Although its quite challenging to get to the top but its all worth it!!! The views are out of this worldHighly recommend!!!
89,Worth the climb ,Great walk- would absolutely recommend this! If you want to go to the top you will need a guide as there is a gate to the last section because the route is steep and treacherous- no you can't bribe the guard or get around this! You can walk to the gate without a guide and this is 2/3rds of the way up: the view from here is great and was enough for us. We went on a cloudy morning and it took us just under 2 hours to get up and down. We hired bikes from our hotel in Le Morne and cycled to the start of the route.
90,Le Morne Brabant,"Climbing Le Morne Brabant is a tough and dangerous venture. Its not suitable for young kids nor for the very unfit. Take note, its climbing not a leisurely walk. I have done it twice and the views are something to behold. Be sure to use a guide going up the mountain."
91,Stunning views ,We had read that the hike was challenging and to maybe use a guide - we did this easily without a guide however I wish we had gone up earlier as it is quite hot and exposed once you really start to climb. It's a bit challenging near the top but we found it totally fine. What an awesome view from the top! Totally rewarding and worth it.
92,Challenging but worth it,"This is definitely worth doing, there is no other way up there but to walk so a nice sense of achievement when you get to the top.We went up there without a guide, we weren't let into the park until 7am (maybe with a guide you can get in there earlier).We walked to the green gate and then walked round it to go to the top. As you get past the gate there is definitely more climbing (rather than walking) to do so some shoes with some grip would help. As you get to the top, the views are beautiful, you get a full panoramic view of the coast, definitely worth the extra effort to go to the top.If you don't go with a guide it is pretty obvious which way you need to go but I expect you probably miss out on the knowledge they have of the area, plants, scenery etc. Also if you don't feel too competent climbing a guide might also be useful as coming down the top section can be a little tricky. I would definitely recommend this trip, it took us 2 hours 40 mins round trip so we were back at the hotel before 10.30 still with a full day in the sun 😎"
93,Just do it!,Tough climb not for amateurs but well worth the views if its a clear day! 4 hours in total and 10km's in total if you walking from Paradi which is very possible.
94,A little harder than expected....,"Beautiful views, really worth the climb.Make sure to hike with the correct gear, as the climb is 7-8 km. Also, take water as it's very humid and exhausting."
95,Climbing Le Morne,"Hiking Le Morne Brabant was slightly more challenging than I expected but it's definitely worth a try. Please keep it mind it's a hike, not a trekking. You need to have water and a pair of good shoes. Exploring this lovely mountain with such a sad history was my favorite day on the island. It's not for elderly people or children, I wouldn't recommend it on a rainy or very windy days. The way was nicely marked and it's not an Everest but there were a lot of people walking with us who seems to forgot it's still a mountain. On steep areas with a lot of tiny, slippery rock, it's easy for an accident. Go, have a wonderful day with amazing views but think about safety first :) on the beginning of your trek you're putting your name and a phone number in the book, it's for safety reasons I believe."
96,Great view!,"As we are here, we decided to climb Le Morne Brabant. Once you get to the Le Morne peninsula from the A3, there is a sign that give you a choice of 2 access points. We opted for the south entrance which has a free car park with shaded areas & toilets. It is free to climb. It is very well sign posted and you do not need a guide to find your way. It is only 556 meters high and 75% is nothing more than a steep walk. The trail is 3.6 km. On the day, we found the top closed off as someone got injured the day before. I am told they are going to carry out some work to make the last part of the climb safer... It took us 01:45 to go up and down at a gentle pace. The views at the top are great; it is a bit of exercise and no doubt will add some great memories to your visit to Mauritius."
97,Great hike,"Le Morne Brabant is spectacular. You can reach a really great lookout point quite easily by following the main track up. After that it gets rocky and narrow, which is why many choose to go with a guide. Definitely recommend giving it a go. It's much more organised and managed than many other earlier reviews suggest."
98,Nice but challenging,Its a hard walk but it with it.You can see the hole bay area and the the kite area A great hike close the the hotel
99,Great View! A Must-do when in Mauritius,"Could never in a million years make it to the very top, but there are fantastic views along the coast from a couple of look-out points just before the near vertical climb to the top starts. The trails are very easy to follow and the forest is nice with many birds. Could be quite grim, if done in the rain but, with a sunny day, you'll see for miles."
100,Fantastic experience.,"Awesome views from the cross! But tough to get there!!! It was more than what we expected....at some points had to use all hands and legs, with rope to pull yourself up. Yan  from Yanature was our guide and he really took care of us. I overestimated myself, and he had to carry my photography gear (the steep part) as my legs started cramping up. He also took care of my wife on the way down. If you are somewhat fit, not an issue. My two teens had no issues at all and enjoyed the hike and the views as well."
101, Best holiday trip,"Climbing this mountain is highly recommended for everyone visiting Mauritius. The views from the top are absolutely stunning. The guides from the Yanature team were really patient and helpful, always making sure that everyone was ok, giving proper rest breaks and helping everyone get up and down the mountain safely. Highly recommended!"
102,Amazing view,"Definitely a Must Do when in Mauritius. The hike up Le Morne is obviously full of history and also full of surprises. Steep ascents, walking through forests , climbing rocks and Hanging on to ropes! The whole experience  is as mind-blowing as the views are. It is technical but doable by all... Young, old , fit and unfit ! The view at the cross is one you will hang on to for a while.None of this would have been possible without the Yanature crew.  Yan and Nico were exceptional in making us feel at ease from start to finish. They were very friendly and very informative about all aspects of such a cultural site. Once again I would highly recommend this hike as a Top thing to do in Mauritius and with no one else but Yanature."
103,Beautiful views,"Wonderful climb, and little hard for people with weak knees - but totally worth it! We took our time to climb as we were not in a rush, had a great bonding moment. It's a must do - the view is so magical that you cannot really get it in a photograph! P.S since the climb is not private anymore, it is better to go early in the morning. Enjoy your climb!"
104,Le morne mountain hiking,Le Morne Brabant is a very beautiful place with an awesome beach ! The water is very unique ! Highly recommended ! On the beach one can find people whom sell food or fruit !
105,Fun to hike,"Fantastic location, stunning beaches. 7 coloured earths tour and fantastic speed boat trip definitely recommend. Le Morne is a great place for a holiday. The hotel we stayed at Riu Creole is really lovely, but the food needs vastly improving."
106,Amazing Views,"We decided to go to Le Morne Brabant and our hotel arranged for the hike. Boy, it was an amazing experience. This has been the first hike for me and I was helped at each juncture especially on the slipperier routes. It gets a bit challenging but its worth it once you reach the top. If you are up for the challenge and fit, go for it!"
107,An awesome hike with a stunning view,"The top of this mountain is worth every minute of climbing! You can reach the middle of the mountain with kids, and still have really nice views. The second part is more challenging and can even be kind of dangerous. Careful of the strong winds as well! It takes about 3 hours to go back and forth"
108,Rewarding Hike & Climb,Trust me you won't be disappointed ;-) View is amazing on the top of the mountain! It's only 3.6 km long :-D Make sure you have plenty of water with you.
109,Must visit ,this place is worth all the pain. on the top of the mountain you have the beautiful view of the south west coast. it is quite difficult to climb but well worth it. take some water along n enjoy the climb
110,Amazing!!,This imposing mountain is a world heritage site with a sad history and is worth visiting just to reflect on the terribly sad events that happened here at the abolition of slavery.
111,A must do if you are visiting Mauritius,"When we knew we were going to Mauritius we kept looking at pictures of Le Morne Mountain, which is located in the South of the island.We very much wanted to hike /climb up that mountain and started our research:Yan de Maroussem currently is the only guide authorized to hike with clients on the private land of this mountain.So we booked the climb for a Saturday.This was a sunrise tour - starting at 04.30AM.It was absolutely wonderful! It had rained around Le Morne for days in a row - and we were afraid the tour might get canceled BUT: turns out that day, from the time we started until we got back to the starting point - that was the only dry time of that day.we just got back before a downpour started and the rain set in.Of couse, getting up at 4am is not so much fun, but we had a clear night with wonderful stars and enjoyed a marvelous sunrise and great view.This steep hike should only be attempted if you are reasonably fit, sure footed and can climb a little.No worries: Our guides always made sure we were doing OK and are safe.We had people from various areas around the world and various age groups and fitness levels.The hike took a total of about 4hrs - we were DRENCHED in sweat! It is helpful to bring some source of light - your cell phone works, better is a headlamp to keep your hands free.Also: wear shoes with good grip/traction - the rocks can be a bit slippery at times.All in all a tour we would do again anytime!p.s.: please keep in mind that this reflects only my personal opinion - if I like something it does not necessarily mean that you would like it, too."
112,Stunning,The hike can be pretty tiring when it's hot and humid but the view from the top is definitely worth it! It can be quite crowded though!
113,Worth a Visit,"On top of Le Morne Brabant you've a great view to the beaches. To get to the top it's a great hike up the mountain. Don't doch this on a sunday, there are a lot of people up there"
114,First part great - second part too dangerous!,"Nice trip with friend very enjoyable and fun,, on the top the view is spledid by chance you can see reunion island,, Excellent!!.😆"
115,Sad history,"We did the climb to Le Morne on the last day of our visit (2nd Feb 17) after an aborted plan earlier in the week due to the weather. As described by many, it was a magnificent experience - physically and mentally challenging, especially if you are not good with heights. We signed up with Yanature and had Yan accompany us, which was fantastic as he was able to give us an excellent commentary and support throughout the hike. They have removed the ropes and hence it was challenging in some places. We did this with a group of about 13 people - some younger ones were in much better condition but there were a few in their fifties - while challenging, it was just a bit on the edge of my comfort zone. The views are worth the effort and you can just imagine what is must have been in the old days as you hear the tragic story of the slaves and their desperate attempt to remain free atleast in death. Go early mornnig, go with a guide, go with lots of water. Absolutely worth the effort"
116,Le Morne Brabant with Explorers Mauritius,"Me and a friend did the hike to Le Morne Brabant on feb 24th, and it was definitely the highlight of our trip to Mauritius. Majestic views from most parts of the hike up, and absolutely fantastic from the top. The hike took 3.5 hours, and we spent about 30 minutes on the top.A guide is highly recommended as the hike is partially quite steep and require some climbing, you can get seriously hurt if you´re not careful. We used Yanature as our guide, and had a great experience learning not only about the plants and animal life on the mountain, but also a bit about Mauritian history."
117,Breathtaking Views!,"We picked a cloudy day although it was still very hot. The walk for the first part is ok and there were a few idiots in flip flops, but we'd advise your walking shoes, as quite a lot of loose rocks. Fantastic viewing areas as you walk up, really quite beautiful. However, wouldn't recommend going past the metal gate (guard is there and you don't have to pay, regardless of other reviews we've read. Nor do you need a guide!) Does take your name and time, but purely for your safety. There had been ropes to hold onto, but as with the path, have now worn away. Only the metal rings are left, which once held the rope. Coming down, we ended up on our bums, sliding. If this was in the UK it would be condemned!Now we've done a lot of walking, such as Snowden, Scafell & plenty of areas in Scotland and The Lake District, so not phased by lots. But right out of our comfort zone at the very top."
118,Amazing views! No need for a guide!,"It's worth the effort and as our guide Alan said determination. The initial track walking is the opportunity to learn about the history of the Slaves hiding on Le Morne and how useful the plants are for maintaining health.Passing through a security gate that is only permitted with a guide you start to climb, scrambling on all fours really to the cross to remember the loss of life from the mountain. Each climb reveals new vistas until reaching the goal.The guides were fantastic, pointing out the safest path and being very supportive and patient. It may be a challenge for some but with determination I think many people would be ready for it and make it to the top.Thanks"
119,Spellbinding!,It is an early start but the views are exceptional! Allan was incredibly knowledgeable about the history and fauna of the area and I would highly recommend it!
120,Somewhat technical but really fun!,Organised with the hotel and conducted by Zac from Yanature.  Spectacular views at the top and well worth the climb!
121,Fantastic trip - but should not be underestimated,We didn't climb the mountain buy stayed at a resort at the foot of the mountain. Amazing views from the water looking up inc from the hotel bar. Pretty sure the views from the top would be fantastic
122,Awesome experience,The view is wonderful.Specially the new road . One should bring his camera.One should visit. Le morne is also the place where slaves were taking shelter
123,"what a great place... beach, sea, mountain, island, kite surf",On our way back from the hotel we stop to climb up the hill and the view was breathtaking. It’s definitely a place to visit
124,Amazing views but....,"Really beautiful place ,  but beware that the top part is challenging (no more ropes) so if you have little climbing experience and no proper shoes/equipment, I would suggest staying at the mid-point. The views are spectacular from there also."
125,A great little challenge,"Today I was part of the trekking to Le Morne Brabant with the  company Yanature and it was all perfect. Our guide was Zack and he did such a good job taking care of our safety, tempo and taking pictures everywhere we wanted. He was very patience for those who had a little problems to get downhill. Super value and care! Please, don't try to get there on your own, it would be dangerous."
126,Stunning Place Steep-ed in History,"This is the best view you will get in Mauritius, unless you choose a sky diving. this hike offers one of the best views you can experience in Mauritius. Nick, our guide, was very knowledgeable and can tell a lot about the nature that surround you. Definitely a must do if you are in Mauritius."
127,Perfect adventure!,"We did this early in the morning as it was very hot, so we could reach the top. I think not everybody can do it, you have to climb, but you can at least go half way on the trail. We did it without a guide."
128,Hiking Le Morne Brabant: Breathtaking views and adrenaline,we went at 6 am climbing this amazing mountain.the view there is just unbelievable!!so many colors!the climb to the top is not too hard and it take around 2-3 hours.you should take a guild to get there.
129,Worth a climb,Great hike! Spectacular views And the best guide! Thanks Yann for this great moment. It was really worth it.
130,Worth it,"I had the chance to do this trip with a guide. First of all: the views and the trip is fantastic! Definitely one of the must do's during your Mauritius holidays!!However, we had our trip in the afternoon and it started to rain and became very cloudy and windy.Whereas the first part of the hike is easy, also during rain, the second part gets even more tricky. It is a hike where you have to climb up vertically! And if it's rainy, the terrain get's extremely slippery... Do not underestimate this! I saw kids hiking up when we slided down on our butts. This should not be the case. And it is on the responsibility of every individual - do not blame your guide!But if you do the hike with care and if you are aware that it's no walk in the park - it's one of the greatest experiences on the island :-)))"
131,Hiking at le morne,It was a very nice hiking.. easy track. No need for guides there is only 1 place you should pass and then things get a bit hard.. you go thru alot of beautiful views.. Different places with different views. You should get water with you because there is no place that sells..
132,Nice view,I did the guided Tour two days ago. The hiking and climbing was absolutely worth it!!!I did it with Explorers Mauritius with Bryn! He motivated everyone of our group. We learned a lot about the famous Le Morne. If i could i definitely would to it again! Thanks for this lifetime experience!
133,"Nice climb, but not to the top","Lush & green part of the island.  If you are in this area then you have to climb Le Morne.  Use a guide to get the most of this.  Up and down takes a good 3 hours and you start at 6.30. I burnt 3,000 calories so it's a good early morning workout!"
134,Hike ,"Well, if this is one of the best views on this island, then best go to a different country is my reaction. Everything in Mauritius is talked up big time, but the reality is very average, and most of the island is taken over by sugar cane, hotels and the huge local population. Not coming back."
135,Honeymoon hike ,"I have two experiences from the hike to the top of the rock. The first is that it is relatively more difficult to climb, so I recommend it with a guide and good shoes, not sandals, as i saw. You do not have to look for a way to the gate and you do not have to cross the fence if you want to go up. That's probably all what the guide will do for you.For one person the guide charge 40, - EUR. This is a relatively high price because its added value is almost zero. Just the fact that he has the key from the gate - will open for you.The view is beautiful, but as I say, 40, - the price does not correspond to the service provided, it is a thief."
136,Best hike on the island! ,We took a guided tour up to be big cross on the top of the mountain a cloudy morning from 0630-1100 including the pick up and drop off at our hotel. The group was 8 persons with two guides. The first hour walk was easy and the. One hour was “light climbing”. No ropes were needed but both hands. The view was fantastic. If you have the possibility you should definitely do the hike.
137,Great place to visit for the beach - but don’t miss a hike up to see the views,Loved it! It is definitely a must do! The view is breathtaking and worth the not so leisurely hike- I would call it almost a climb. I would recommend going with a guide- they can help guide you to where exactly put your feet on the way up and down- it gets pretty steep!
138,A must visit,"This is an absolutely amazing hike/climb with Allan (who is now the second guide in Mauritius authorized to take guests up the mountain).  Allan lives in Le Morne Village and is extremely knowledgable, kind and caring. He will take his time to meet the needs of the group he is guiding, stopping along the way to discuss the local flora and fauna and well as give the hikers time to breathe in all the natural beauty that surrounds you along the way. He never rushes the group and pays close attention to the desires of each person (many like to stop often for photo opps or just to take a little breather and some water!) I have done this hike with him 3 times now and I see how he watches everyone in the group to make sure everyone is comfortable and happy.I will say, this is not a hike for just anyone.  You do need a good level of fitness and must not be afraid of heights! The first section of the walk is through a nice, green path covered in trees and blossoming flowers. But the last 20-30 minutes is much different! You are literally climbing straight up (and don't forget, you have to come down the same way you went up!) I personally don't think the hike is appropriate for children under 12 and as a parent, I think it's critical to assess if this is something appropriate for your own youngster. Make sure to wear a sturdy pair of trainers or hiking shoes and clothes that wick the sweat away! You'll start early in the morning, but it gets hotter as the day goes on. The hike takes around 3 1/2 hours depending on the speed of the group. Bring a camera and plenty of water and a snack for the top. (Allan provides some water and a small snack as well.) I highly recommend Hiking Le Morne Mountain with Allan. :)"
139,"Breathtaking views, difficult climb but worth it!","We took the hike in the morning at 7am and were driven from our hotel to the mountain. Amazing views throughout with explanations from the tour guide of the flora and history of the mountain. Our group was of 5 people and it took us 4 hours in total to complete... more than enough time for viewpoints and pictures!The angle of the mountain was a lot steeper than a regular hike and might be a bit difficult for children and elderly people, especially on the way back down. However, definitely worth the challenge for us... the best tourist site in Mauritius!"
140,Great views,"We wanted to experience some of the beautiful nature of Mauritius and chose the guides from Yanature. Their knowledge of the local area, nature and Mauritian history was a big bonus to the incredible scenery. The hike to the top of the Morne was extremely steep and required a good head for heights but the views were well worth the effort. It wasn’t a long hike just a little intense at the end as you had to scramble across some steep rocky areas, so some good walking shoes and water is recommended. My 18 year old son loved the experience and it was a definite highlight of our stay on the island. We also participated in a guided walk in the Black River Gorges which is also highly recommended."
141,Fantastic hike,"We did mountain climbing in the Alps up to a difficulty of 5+ and are experienced. At Le Morne we had been accompanied by a local Mauritian (no official guide). The fixed steel ropes had been taken away for maintenance in June. We turned around a few hundred meters after the steel gate because it wasn’t safe to continue without a rope.We saw so called guides there ""helping"" inexperienced tourists with sneakers and other not appropriate shoes to climb up the mountain. Nobody was wearing any helmets let alone using ropes. The guides ignored all alpine security standards dragging tourist in areas where they shouldn't be. Le Morne can be easily and safely climbed but not without trekking shoes, gear for fixed steal ropes (if they are there) and helmets.By the way the gate is closed to help the official guides who have a key to stay in business. This has nothing to do with permissions to do the tour alone."
142,View from our resort,We climbed the wonderful mountain le Morne Brabant situated in the district of Black River with colleagues under the sunshine of Mauritius Island. Breathtaking scenes and refreshing winds throughout.
143,Great hiking but better take a guide!,"It’s quite challenging once the second half starts but absolutely rewarding to reach the cross on top. While many hotels advise to take a guide and some books say it’s mandatory - if you’re physically in shape you can do it well on your own. - The path are easy to find- some passages are tricky to climb, but you don’t need climbing gear, certainly good shoes though! - don’t go when it’s raining as it might be too slippery- go with a friend to help you spot the right way in case you are not sure- don’t get irritated by some guides that try to scare you (some really put on a show for their customers) - it’s not an easy hike / climb but it’s not impossible either. - be careful and have fun :)"
144,Amazing place,I told my wife I was gonna climb the mountain when I did omg it was amazing very hard thou but well worth the pain when you get to the top
145,Beautiful place,This place has magic. Just a beautiful rock overseeing the blue coral sea. It is very high a gives a great view to all sides. On top a cross.
146,Amazing!,The trip to le morne was something i wanted to do but there i almost changed my mind on seeing the long long long walk up to the mountain top! Not a physically active person at all. But slowly we made our way up stopping once in a while admiring the view (which was so worth the…
147,Worth the climb! ,"The trek is divided in two parts, the first one is really easy and is just a walk going upward. It takes around 20 - 30 minues going up. Afterwards, it seems that you ""officially"" need a guide to go up to the top as it gets steep and really windy up there. There is a metallic fence and a guard has the key to let you pass or not. The offical guides also have a key for that door. As I was alone, the guard asked me to wait 15 minutes as there were already a few people doing the walk up to the top, then I signed a legal discharge to go on. Maybe it is according to the physical condition of the trekker that he might let you pass or not. Anyway, passed half way I would strongly recommed to have good shoes and also some water with you as you have around 30 - 45 minutes to walk again (sometimes helping yourself with your hands) and then some time to enjoy the view at the top.Be safe and enjoy!"
148,Spectacular,"Very impressive rock in the southwest of Mauritius. I ask some people and they say, that you can get guide tours to the top and I will take around 1,5 hour to get to the top and 1,5 hour to get down again. I could only enjoy from the ground/water."
149,Paradise,What a beautiful mountain this is! Slaves jumped of of this 826m high mountain in fear of the police.
150,"very nice hike, but overcharged entrance fee from Yanature trekking company","After watching the mountain from the beach for a week we decided it was time to try to see the view from the top. We did not arrive at the gate at the bottom until 3 pm and it said that gates close at 4 - but we still decided to at least start walking. First part is not difficult at all and requires neither climbing skills nor guide - just remember to bring plenty of water. Depending on your fitness it should take 35-50 minutes to the steep climbing sections. It is true that it currently says that it is not allowed to continue climbing there, but that did not seem to stop people - you can pass the locked gate to the left. As we were short of time and we did not have the best of shoes we turned about half way up the steep part. The view from where we were was amazing enough. When we got down to the bottom the main gate was also locked, but no problem to get out on the right hand side. Even if it seems to be a bit of ""flexibility"" on the opening hours, make sure to be down well before it gets dark! And for those who want to be sure to arrive at the peak I would suggest going with a guide."
151,Le Morne,"Stunning backdrop for pictures, if you go round the side of the rock you'll find a little beach where there's no wind"
152,Beautiful,"One of the best hikes I have ever done! Starting early so it wasn't to hot, Allan came and collected us from our hotel and the short distance to the start. The first part of the walk was fairly easy, but the second half is a lot more challenging and sturdy footwear and a good level of fitness a must, as well as a good head for heights, you are climbing on yours hands and feet at times. The views from the top are spectacular. Allan the guide is fantastic and very passionate about the mountain and town."
153,Best Hike in Mauritius!,The beach is just gorgeous and the mountain invokes beauty and a sense of sorrow with its history.  Well worth the time to soak up the heat and beauty of the place and take in the breath-taking landscape!  Highly recommended to everyone visiting the island!!
154,Emotionally and physically difficult but DO IT!,Really amazing view from the top of the peak. you can see the nearby islands around and a breathtaking sight of the sea . Nature lovers go for it.
155,Must thing to do in Mauritius!,This is a must visit if your near by. Many forget Mauritian's history and this monument is great way to learn that the island is more than just a beautiful beach. Many of the components need explanation so go with someone who knows about the history of the site and the stones. Its also right across from the beach so the its easy to visit then head for a swim.
156,Le morne ,"Well spent 3-4 hours. Amazing view both on the way up and from the top. The first part is pretty easy, basically small road/path. The second part is behind closed gate which is quite easy to bypass if locked. The park man at the entrance made us a sure about it's on own risk to move across the gate without a guide. The second part is quite steep and you to make some easy climbing. Reaching the top is definitely worth the sweat. The view is absolutely astonishing! Went there during winter season and the temperature is not the bothering and you can do it all day. Just remember park opening hours 7-16. If you are healthy and well you should be able to manage the steep walk. We didn't hire a guide and it was no problem finding the way up. But if you feel uncomfortable about it, please hire a guide. We heard that they are great! One of our best experiences while visiting Mauritius."
157,Stunning Scenery,We were told by a few people that this is a good hike to do so we thought we would give it a go. Most people including our hotel staff recommended we go with a guide but we were confident to go without one – we actually only saw two people with a guide so no need for one if you are used to hiking and are confident. I am not sure what extra a guide would have done for us. At the start of the hike you have to sign your name with the time of entry and then again at the end which I can only assume is to make sure everyone makes it out safely. There are no toilets even though they were signs for them. The start of the climb is fine in terms of the steepness and surface. You then get to a point where it says the next part is dangerous. This is where we walked through narrow stretches and up some rocks. There were times when my boyfriend had to help me up as some of the rocks were very big. We bumped into a guide who said the rain was coming so advised us not to go all the way to the top. Other people were continuing to go on so we decided to do the same. We got to a point where it got very steep and I was aware of the potential rain so I stopped and my boyfriend carried on. He made it to the top and saw the most amazing views which he captured on video. The walk back down is actually harder than I thought it would be. We made it up and down in 3 hours with a few stops along the way. We wore trainers which I would recommend – I think hiking boots would be too bulky to fit into the rocks when going up. We got there for 7am to ensure we weren’t walking in the extreme daytime heat – it was still very hot so make sure you take plenty of water and sun cream. I was impressed at how many young children I saw making it all the way to the top!
158,Stunning view ,"After reading all the discussions about hiking to the top I asked Le Mourne heritage trust fund and received this answer:""Please note that climbing the Le Morne Brabant Mountain from the trailhead to the plateau is opened for the public even without guide.However, access to the upper trail of the mountain from the plateau to the metal cross is closed for maintenance work and there are high risk involved in climbing this part of the mountain. Climbers are encouraged to get a registered guide for this. If climbers wish to take their own risks for climbing, they will need to sign a Risk Liability Form with the security officer posted at section 2 on the plateau.""After doing the hike on my own my conclusion is: You should be an experienced hiker, no matter if you are with our without guide. There was the mentioned security officer and I had to sign the form, since I was on the hike without guide.It's almost impossible to miss the route, but a guide could give safety, at least from a psychological point of view. There are two passages (one in the middle section and one right before the peak) who are really steep. And please, don't do the hike if the ground is wet or if it's raining. I'm a quite experienced climber, but I wouldn't do it under such conditions. Life is too valuable!"
159,The greatest hike,"We had a fantastic morning climbing this amazing mountain, especially given its links to slavery and the stronghold it became for escapee slaves. Make sure you take a few minutes to appreciate the little makeshift village at the bottom too.My husband was apprehensive of climbing the mountain without a guide, but I can assure anyone wanting to take on La Morne that you can absolutely do it on your own. The paths are well travelled and easy to navigate. They do become narrower and steeper towards the top once you pass the ‘Warning’ sign. There are also plenty of other walkers to know you are going in the right direction.Once you pass the sign do prepared for a steep ascent and slight bit of rock climbing/scrambling. As dangerous as it looks, as long as you take your time you’ll make it to the top. While we were trekking we saw multiple children  climbing as well as those wearing slightly less suited footwear. Our view from the top was somewhat hindered by the clouds, but it was still a great morning out all the same. Take plenty of water and maybe some lunch to have at the top too. It took us about 3 hours to go up and down. A must activity for anyone loving the outdoors!"
160,Worth it,"The views are amazing, no need to get to the top to give a present to your eyes... go to the top is worth it but tough. You need a guide if you are not a person with mountains, hiking or climbing background due the second half can be hard and requires concentration to go up, you need to crawl with your hand at some moments. The way down of the second part is, of course, tough as well.Recommended go early morning, the park opens at 7 officially but there's no problem to get in earlier because is a free activity. Also because the only way up is facing the East, so as soon as the sun is raised the stones get warm fast and can be burning during your hike"
161,One of the most special places in the world,"You can climb to the second stage in sandals (proved this the 2nd time up), BUT it's a lot better to take decent shoes preferably boots. The hike is quiet steep, but provided that you take your time I guess most people would make it. Above the 2nd stage is currently shut, the…"
162,A bit of adventure,"I had a really good time with Yanature on the Morne Brabant. The view on the top was breath taking! I had good conversations with nice people, and learnt a lot on indigenous species! Hiking the Morne Brabant is definitely one of the things to do in Mauritius, advice from a Mauritian!"
163,Well Worth The View at the End,"A heavy climb but definitely not dangerous if you're used to walk mountains, just need a good physical condition and being careful where to step.  The view at the cross is overwhelming and makes the hard workout more then worth it."
164,Le Mourne Brabant,"As per the various reviews, the first part of the hike (about an hour from the base) is pretty simple. The second part (after the sign that says Dangerous Climbing Ahead) is where the challenge is. Literally rock climbing using hands and legs. This is where having a guide was very helpful, for inexperienced climbers. Coming down was also another challenge. But definitely worth the climb for the view on top.Our guides were from Local Spirit and would definitely recommend them!"
165,Great location,A must to do!! Incredible view after only a walk of 1 hour. Can be done with children as from 10 years old.Worst to do it!
166,Just do it. It’s worth it. ,Historical mountain with beautiful views of the ocean. Definitely recommend  to stop by to see the crystal waters and visualise a piece of history.
167,Tough but worthwhile climb,magical place in mauritius.lot of history and culture.nice view and place.requires hiking as well.
168,Hiking,Walking up the first part is fairly easy - waywise - and the view is rewarding. The Second part (starting at the guarded gate) I'd only advice you to do - if you're experienced with rocky ways and climbing. At the parking lot they 'prohibit' you going up the 2nd part - unless you call a guide (they give you phone numbers) or book a guided tour. We decided to go on our own. Shortly before the 2nd part started we met a guide coming down who strongly discouraged us going up on our own as 'the police would fine each person with 2000rupies'... well as we re experienced in mountaneous areas we still went up (we met others along the way - even Mauritius people who didn't know about this law). The view on top is stunning!! And we didn't get fined.So my recommendation; LeMorne is a Must-See and do at least the first part - you won't regret it! If you're not too experienced but would like to get to the top - safety wise- book a guided tour for the second part. If you re experienced go on top and don't be frightened by the 'possibility' of a 60US$ penalty.
169,1 Part Brisk Trail Walk | 1 Part Serious Mountain Climb,"As we are senior persons, we decided not to climb even to the half to the vista point.But we did very good pictures either.The best light is before sunset. It was an absolute must in Mauricius."
170,Breath-taking views!,"Had a fantastic day here, would highly recommend, lovely views and sight seeing.With our tour had a packed lunch"
171,A hike of two halves.,"Amazing climb - lower 2 Km a gentle ramble , upper section tricky in places but worth it!! Walk to entrance from Le morne public beach well signed and on Google maps"
172,Seriously? The best view?,"Le Morne Mt. is good for people going for tracking. Le Morne beach is excellent beach, for relaxing, not that great for swimming as you might have hurdle with corals etc."
173,"THE MOST AMAZING, AWESOME, BEAUTIFUL LOCATION WHERE TO STAY IN AN HOTEL IN MAURITIUS.","We took a guide and I would advise to do so, its rather steep towards the last third/ half. We went early and opened the gate and therefore had no others in our way, which was great too."
174,Amazing Hotel to visit,"Absolutely stunning views at the top of the mountain. One of my favourite experiences in the whole of Mauritius. It's a difficult climb - you need to be fairly adventurous and should wear good walking shoes. No need to have a guide unless you are not very confident in climbing.  Bring plenty of water, at least 1.5 L per person - some parts have no shade."
175,Hard work! ,"I visited Mauritius last year with my friends, and we went to this place.  the place is very good for hiking purposes. also advise you to please hire guide because it's something confusing if you are a first time traveler"
176,One of the Most Exceptional Experiences!,"This is NOT a climb but a hard walk, and one has to be reasonably fit to do it. There is a wide track to follow with a little bit of hard work at the end where you will find ropes to help you up the rocky incline. There are lovely views as you get nearer to the top and you will feel a sense of achievement if you do this activity. The walk is free, but I have heard rumours that there are some so-called guides near the top who are asking for money. There are boards at the bottom of the climb telling you of the interesting history of the mountain."
177,possible also without guide,We set out a 8am to conquer this mighty mountain it’s worth saying take plenty of water and some snacks you will need them the first part is easy then you come upon some green railing we were about one and a half hours into our climb this is where it started to get a bit challenging you need to start clambering it was a very hot day way up in the thirties and I wish I had got there about an hour before we did we did see people who were coming down they keep going not far about an hour later which seemed like three hours by this point it was getting very difficult but we kept going the rest times were getting every couple of minutes by this time and we foulishly ran out of water I think we were only about fifteen minutes from the top we were on our hand and knees by now I had nothing left in reserve I wish we had taken more water I just couldn’t catch my breath I felt very like headed and we took the decision to abandon our quest to the top I just thought we had about 2 hours down I just couldn’t continue I regret so much not making it to the top but I’m sure if I was a bit more savvy and had taken some snacks and load more water we would have made it but I must say the views that I did get to see where breathtaking so good luck to anyone who try’s this climb and my utmost admiration goes to those who did do it
178,Best beach area,"This is definitely a hiking trip you need to do if in Mauritius.The first part consist of the 3.6 trekking part. At the end on this part you will have two viewpoint spots. From here you can then start the hiking of the mountain. It might seem hard, it will all depend on your physical ability. Make sure to go as early as possible (it opens at 07:00 in the morning), to avoid the hot sun. It will be more enjoyable and less tiring to climb on top. Access to the mountain is free.You can also visit by public transport. If you are coming by bus just ask the bus driver or controller to stop at the entrance of the mountain. Distance to arrive at the gate to access the mountain is 1.5 km."
179,Awstruck,really nice for those who like adrenaline and trekking mode...hard but amazing with the view on top..surely water bottles is a must!!!
180,Totally worth it!!,"A few days ago, I went to hike Le Morne Brabant  with some friends. It was a really great experience and the  view was  breath-taking! It was not too high and I found the ascension quite easy, while I had a bit of  difficulty on the way back."
181,Awesome,"We only did the 'half' hike. The hike wasn't easy, but wasn't too difficult. It took 2.5/3 hours in total (lots of stopping for photos and shelter from the hot sun). Essentially, you walk until there are signs saying there is climbing from that point on. We stopped there! The views were absolutely amazing. For the 'half' hike you certainly don't need hiking experience, nor do you need a guide.Must-do in Mauritius!"
182,Do it! ,"Today was very windy, so we stayed under the mountain, where is very nice public beach and some resorts."
183,A must do if in Mauritius,"Wonderful activity and a must see;  but to go past the the green gate,  you better be young or good physical condition .  Also , get a local guide.  Without a guide, you could waste lots of energy having to walk much farther than needed .  And most important the safety aspects without a guide !So it takes about an hour to get to the green gate.  From this point the view is stunning and worth the the trip.  If you choose to go around gate ( you can easily climb over at end of fence and most do ),  this is where the pain begins !At least 100 meters of being on all fours climbing the rock wall, and the another 20 minutes of steep hiking.  For older or not so good shape , enjoy view at gate and go back down !!"
184,Great view,"The first part of this hike is easy. After the sign that says: ‘for experienced climbers only’ it gets harder. It’s not walking anymore but real climbing. We did this hike on a very hot day so that made it even harder. Make sure you take enough water with you. I would recommend 2 liters pp on a hot day. Wear good hiking shoes, no sneakers. When you reach the cross the view is amazing!! Totally worth it. Overall it took us 3,5 hours, including some short breaks and about 15 minutes on top."
185,Don't try the top!,"If you only do one hike in Mauritius, this is it! If you have more time I recommend the 7 cascades, piton de la petite riviere noire and the cascade 500 pieds.Officially, the gate at the bottom of the hike opens at 7am but you can go earlier if you like and sneak in a corner. It gets very hot and there is little shade so the earlier you go the better. The path is clearly marked but there are  a few side trails for views so I recommend using a route on a gps tracker so you don't get detoured. There were a few signs saying that the ropes were under repair and to only access till a certain area. But I think all the ropes were fine. Just in case, I didn't use any of the ropes to go up. I trust more the rocks and a bit of bouldering is always nice!Go all the way up till the iron cross. The views are totally worth it! Afterwards you can go to the public beach you see at the top.  It is between the two hotels."
186,Ride in the mountains,"Did the half way hike, which was tough and took about 2 hours around trip for 5k, with lots of stopping to learn about the make in the area. The view from half way up was breathtaking. Have to say the final climb did look a bit challenging and as we're not experienced climbers or hikers, felt half way was enough. The guide was knowledgeable and it was very good to get an idea of the foliage and history. Half way can be done without a guide though. If in Le Morne this is a must do."
187,Big mountain,The title sums it up - the walk is (relatively) easy and offers beautiful views of the surrounding area. Allow yourself plenty of time and bring water - we saw nowhere where you could buy drinks.
188,Moderate Hike with breathtaking views,"First of all, you don't need a guide, the trek is quite easy until the green fence, from there it becomes a litle difficult for those who are not used to hike or climb on rocks. They say that the path from that fence is closed for maintanance but as far as i've seen there is no working maintanance going on. The view from the top is spectacular. We had the trak way and back in aboup 3h:30 - 4h. Don't forget to get water (we drank 2l of water on this hike). And don't worry about the closing hour (16h), we reached the parking lot at 16h15 and there was nobody over there anymore, the gates were closed, but there is a gap to pass outside."
189,We used a guide,"Two levels, all the way to the top requires good level of physical fitness and some climbing skills, definitely recommend a guide if you choose to go all the way up, mosquito repellent and start at 6-7 am at the most, otherwise the heat will be unbearable."
190,Hectic but worth it!!!!,So we decided to hike this mountain during our stay and there were points I wandered what I was doing as you do have to climb and be very careful in particular coming down. It’s great sense of achievement when you get up there though and amazing views. We didn’t use a guide but some people may choose to.
191,you have to see it,"We did this climb with Allan and he was fantastic at explaining the history as well as the background of all the plants.It's not an easy climb and you will need to be reasonably fit to make it to the top however when you get there, it is more than worth the effort."
192,A lot of effort but not convinced,"Amazing and it is for free! :)For The first part the hiking is easy, the only difficult thing is that a very warm day may make it really tiring for the humidity. But the view, in a very clear day is sooo beautiful, you can't miss this! :) We haven't done the climbing part because the ropes were under maintenance, however a pair of shoes good for climbing other than the running shoes are definately better."
193,"Quite technical hike, but allowed without guide","We did the hike by ourselves without guide, so it is possible, however i recommend that if you are not fit or used to kind of climbing, get one, at least to help you and tell you where to put your feet.There are signs indicating ""acces to the mountain"" and the path is well indicated. It is free entrance. Usually there are more people and groups doing it. Recommended to start very early (around 7am) to avoid lots of people and hot temperatures. You need to write your names in a book at the entrance and thats it!Needed: suncream, mosquito repellent, water and proper shoes.Hike: moderate (difficult going down as very slippery).It took us around 2 hours go up and down, and the way is quite steep. The final part is kind of climbing, there are ropes to help you but not all of them are in good conditions (as we were informed, however we didnt see any in bad condition) but just be aware.There is a public parking approximately 1.5 km from the access.The views are amazing and i recommend it."
194,Great place for a honeymoon and surfing,"Well worth the effort of the 4 hour round trip. I decided to go with a guide, which was a wise idea, as half way up there is a locked gate to which only the guide has a key. People have made efforts to climb over, but the gate was installed after only one year of the track being opened due to excessive litter and people injuring themselves. The first half of the walk is along a wide track, and apart from the heat and the ascent, relatively easy. But then it changes to a much rockier path, with a couple of quite steep ascents, both of which aren't too bad if you are o.k. with heights. I was surprised at how small the part of the top was that we arrived on, just near to the cross. Certainly big enough for about 20-25 people tho. Our guide was very safety conscious and advised us about our technique on descending the rocks, so in all a very good trip and would well recommend...."
195,Breathtaking!,"It takes a while to get on top but it's really worth it. Also you can do it without a guide, you just can't get lost it has a clear pathway to the top. Be careful of the last part tho it can be a bit tedious"
196,Amazing views ,"An impromptu stroll from the RIU Le Morne to the start of the mountain trail was the commencement of a 3 hour round lone trip. Not planned before I left the UK and the choice of footwear was not really the most desirable but I’m here and I’m going to give it a go. I probably should also have gone first thing in the morning, not 11am. The sun was beating down and at times it was a slog of a walk, but the view was magnificent when I reached the point where I could go no further without a guide. They call this the half way point and probably in time that is probably fair, but it seems that you are 2/3 of the way up at this point.I saw families with children doing this walk, so I cannot complain.Worthwhile but I would imagine much more easier without the midday sun."
197,A Symbol of the Former Slaves' Fight for Freedom,"The feeling of climbing the beautiful le Morne Brabant early in the morning, overseeing one of the most beautiful places on earth is almost to wonderful to describe. Regarding the climbing, I felt very secure in the experienced hands of my guide Allan. As an extra bonus Allan shared his great knowledge on both the history of the spot and about plants and wildlife around us. I couldn't have wished for anything more and I sure recommend this to everybody who are going to Mauritius. Next time I will let Allan guide me and my family through the Black River Gorges national park!"
198,THE EFFORT IS WORTH IT!!,Relatively easy small mountain which was done in three hours from the hotel creaol and back. Half way up the mountain towards the summit is a little more challenging and isn't suitable for children or people who struggle with heights but the majority of the mountain could be done in slippers with your granny. Well worth a visit and walk around seeing the islands peninsular from a higher perspective. Loved the little adventure and so glad we did it whilst we were there.
199,wow effect,"Had a really good Walt to the mountain top. Was manageable and the route was clearly marked and easy to follow.Would recommend this walk, however you have to take the last part with the help of aids and ropes.Beautiful views.Wear sensible walking shoes."
200,Top is demanding,"Me and my girlfriend did the climb to the peak today,  we started at 6am and we were down by 11:30am.  Great somewhat challenging climb with a great view at the top. Would recommend."
201,Worth the effort ,We went through company called local spirit. 1st stage of climb is walking only. 2 nd stage is quite moderate while going down. Lovely views from the top.
202,Great mountain,"We drove to the start point of the hiking trail with the intention to climb all the way to the top with no help. We were lucky to meet two experienced guys on the way up and we tagged along. The ascent is easy to moderate until you reach the final third, where it becomes strenuous and physically demanding. You'll have to scramble to reach the top, but trust me the final viewpoint is breathtaking and is worth every drop of sweat. This was the highlight of my week-long trip to Mauritius no doubt! Don't let exhaustion dispirit you! Take as many rests as you need. Also, make sure you have enough water and maybe an energy bar."
203,The best!,That‘s a must do when you’re in Mauritius and in Le Morne. Did a morning hike at 10am and it was just amazing and worth every step and climb. The beginning of the trail is easy and just a bit uphill. From the middle of the trek it gets a bit more moderate and the last part you have to literally climb. On the full way you have beautiful view points and amazing picturesque views. Recommend it only when it’s dry as the last part is steep and can be. Rey slippery and dangerous. The total hike takes about 3 hours. Enjoy it!
204,Scenic walk - historic site,The trip is not very difficult untill the moment when you have to climb so you can go with children there. I didn't climb but believe me the view is woth to see. The rout takes less than one hour but what you cann see from the top is dreamlike! Is better to start early morning - it's not so hot than. Really amazing place to visit!
205,Climbing Le Morne Brabant,"I walked up La Morne with Dirk from Yanature. What a fabulous guide, so worth doing it with this company as they add so much....info on flowers, history, birds. Great company . He also helped us when it got tricky as to where to put your feet ( hike was harder than I expected). He also took fabulous photos.....far better than I could have taken. Rather than struggle on your own book a very professional guide and enjoy the experience with fellow,hikers"
206,A Fantastic Walk with Superb Views,Four hour walk that is slightly challenging about half way in when you have to scramble a little here and there to get up. But it's pretty straight forward and if you fancy yourself as even just a tiny bit adventurous and self respecting of your physical capabilities then you really ought to give it a go. The views from the top are tremendous and really allow you to appreciate Mauritius for the stunning island that it is- and so much more than just sea and sand.Go with Yanature- top top guide and lovely man.
207,AMustSee! Guide or Not?,What a view. I only went half way as the ropes have been taken away. Plus the temp was 30deg when I went up. Must do trip!!
208,Plan your walk depending on the weather,"This hike starts off gently, with the trail winding around the coast. There are some excellent viewpoints along the way overlooking much of the South. You can turn back at this point, or carry on to a steep part with rocks. You don't need any special gear, although you have to be prepared to hold to rock and climb up. There is a break where you get back on to path that traverses around to the second rocky ascent. Aside from the amazing views at the summit, you might also see some long-tailed white birds maybe endemic to Mauritius flying around and headed back to their nests in the cliff face. The whole trip took me about 3.5 hours and left me elated for days!"
209,Speechless!,Incredibly easy to access from hotel - fantastic views - take some water with you. Saw monkeys whilst walking up!
210,History,We booked the hike with Yanature through our hotel in Le Morne. We started the hike at 6:45 am and we had walked up and back down the mountain by 10:30am. Yan was a great guide telling us a lot of detail about the mountain and helping us use the right technique over trickier sections. He also stayed with me throughout the descent to make sure I was safe. This is an amazing hike with views you will never forget! I would definitely recommend doing this with Yanature.
211,"Nice view and not ""too"" difficult",Ropes to go on top are under renovation. It's quite dangerous to climb up there. Bring good shoes if you want to go on the top of the rock.
212,Not just breathtaking landscape  but also a world heritage site !,"A historical place for the Mauritian people in his history of  slavery  ! You will be able to climb because their is a route which has been done in order to go to the top but a little bit difficult at the end ! When you reach at the top of the mountain , you will not believe !"
213,Very nice Hike,"We tried to go up to the summit of le Morne with my girlfriend but we’ve been stopped halfway up by a closed gate and a guard telling us we’re not able to go beyond that point without a guide, because of the difficulty of the hike and the risks involved. We were a bit annoyed and disappointed as we were really looking forward to do the climb…The day after I’ve looked on internet for a local guide and booked with a company called Yanature. They organise guided tours, told us about the plants and animals, the history of Mauritius, taught us the right techniques to tackle the tricky parts safely… The hike becomes a real experience with their explanations, care and professionalism. We had great fun and finally made it to the top !!! The view is stunning ! Definitely the highlight of our holidays."
214,"Great views, easy hike","You can go part the way up on a clear, if a bit uneven trail, and get excellent views. However, a short way after this is a climb. It's over rocks and some loose soil and is extremely steep. It's difficult to get foot and hand holds at many points and several times the rocks and soil gave way beneath me. Many of the rocks are smooth and slippery too. I had one fall for a bruise only, but it could have been much worse.I had already been warned of the danger by a guide on the way down and eventually turned back.They are currently constructing concrete tracks up the mountain so that ambulances can get up to evacuate injured climbers (or bodies?). That should tell you of the risk.I have done mountain climbing previously and can say this is extreme risk, especially for amateurs and unfit tourists. Someone will die sooner or later with the climb in its current state.Apparently there was a rope hold on the worst section at one time, which would make a significant difference. However it is gone, although I saw an anchor point still in place at one point.I know people will still attempt the climb no matter what I say, but don't even think about it if its rainy or windy. Do not go without a mountain climbing guide (as opposed to a tourist guide) as at least they can advise the safest route and help if necessary.However this climb should not be open to the general public."
215,Easy walk - stunning views,Fantastic views and a wonderful experience!Great guides!Bring enough water and go early in the morning
216,Lovely Trek,"The climbing provides an occasion for some physical activity within the reach of the average adult and children and the effort is well rewarded with the breathtaking view on the landscape and the lagoon along the way up to the observation plateau.However the climb from there to the rocky summit not so far away is more challenging. From an historical point of view ,the place was the refuge of run-away slaves and it is really an experience to be able to imagine how they managed to eke out a living in such a place."
217,H&S wouldn't permit it in the UK - but it was great,"If you enjoy hiking and are experienced in navigating difficult climbs, then you can do this without a guide. If you're unsure...definitely use a guide!The first part of the hike up to the first viewpoint is fairly easy if you're fit. The climb is enjoyable and the views are some of the best in the island. The climb to the second platform is more tricky, you have to be happy to scramble up some rocks etc.The third part is the difficult bit. You have to use ropes to pull yourself up a steep rock face. Fine if you are confident - use a guide if you are not.Take plenty of water, wear hiking boots or trainers and make sure to have plenty of sunscreen as there is not a great deal of shade."
218,Great trekking ,"The beach under the Le Morne crag is a stunning example of Indian Ocean beauty, with terrific windsurfing and kite surfing on offer out towards the reef. No shark attacks here either, they say. ""One Eye"" is an interesting feature on the massif that allows water sportsmen to identify the perfect spot to catch a wave."
219,A lovely walk,We get only to the plato but even that is great. So beautifull view to the west coast and partialy also to the south. Did not want to take a risk to go to the top. Perfect time to go there is early in the morning otherwise the sun will take you down.
220,Well worth it!,"Absolutely worth the climb, once in a lifetime visit! The hike up is definitely doable, and the view is absolutely worth every single effort. A must if you are visiting Mauritius"
221,well worth it.,"We’ve just climbed Le Morne today so I’ll leave review quick while the experience still feels fresh! I climbed with my partner. I am not the fittest person around, so I was a bit worried but reading other positive reviews here encouraged me. Also earlier this week we visited Tamarind Falls so I thought if I did that I could do this! The first bit was easy, just a normal hike until you get to the warning sign about dangerous climbing. Then it got a bit harder, but also fun as it felt just like bouldering. I honestly think the heat was the worst part rather than the hike itself. I was in desperate need of shade and stopped every time there was some. Even so, it took us 3.5 hrs start to finish. The views are so worth it and you’ll be so happy that you did it in the end! Please don’t let some of the overly dramatic reviews here discourage you. We’ve bumped into all age and fitness groups! Make sure you take plenty of water with you, I had 1 litre and wished I brought more as there’s no places to buy any. Insect repellent as well as the flies get annoying, and obviously good shoes."
222,Beware and be prepared!,"My husband and I climbed the mountain with a guide called Allan, he was so passionate about the history behind it, and you could tell he really loved his job. We climbed the mountain the day before our wedding and everyone thought we were crazy. I think they were right, it was very hard work. We set off from our hotel at Lux Le Morne at 06:15 and arrived at the top around 10:30ish. The first half of the climb is a hike, the second part you are literally climbing the mountain - like rock climbing. Wear proper shoes, don't bring much stuff - just water ideally in a small back pack and a camera. The views are incredible. The rocks are hot on the way down and your hands will get a bit burnt. Also beware, if like me you go back down the mountain on your bottom, you will get a lot of mud and dust in whatever clothes you wear. This was emotionally the best trip we did and we learnt something on it. The views were also breath-taking. 100% go with a guide. It's too risky not to if you want to reach the top."
223,Worth the effort,"has a really amazing view over Le Morne area. Takes little less more than 1,5 hours one way. Pretty steep at times. Our guide Alan was a very good storyteller and told us all about the mountain and some Mauritian history"
224,A great hike and view,"We deciding to climb Le Morne after ready the reviews, although I was a bit worried as a 50 something couple we might find it challenging. We organised it through our hotel who booked us in with a guide called Alan, who we met at 7 in the morning to avid the heat! No one mentioned rain and we did have a few heavy showers on the mountain which worried me as I thought it might make the climb slippery. However Alan was great all the way up and went at TV pace if the needs of his group. He gave us a great deal of information on the flora and fauna on route. The last part of the climb is proper rock climbing using ropes and pushing yourself up on the rocks, but even with my weak knees this was doable and the view from the top worth the effort. Alan uses a path which starts on private land and I would recommend getting a guide unless you are an experienced climber. Remember that what goes up must come down and this was a little more daunting than climbing but again by taking time and listening to Alan we made it. We rewarded ourself with an afternoon in the beautiful beach below and felt virtuous when we were tucking into our dinner later that evening!"
225,On the top of Mauritius,"We've enjoyed that hiking. Good for health. Those who'd made it to the top, didn't regret the view and the great feeling of being up there. Big thanks to Wes Aventure - randonnée (Wesley and team) for being a great guide, as usual..."
226,Short hike with a spectacular view as a reward,"Fantastic trip out. And NO you don't need a guide to get to the top, but more later. We had a hire car so only 30 mins or so from our base in Flic en Flac, and well signposted to the start of the trail. At the start point there is ample parking, a toilet, and an attendant who asks you to sign in the book so they have a record of who left and who returned. The first part of the trek is easy, a steady walk up a track you could drive a 4x4 up. Through nicely wooded area with occasional tantalising fabulous views to sea over the lagoon, improving as you ascend. Eventually (sorry, don't have good timings by section, but to the top and back down was about 4 hours overall) you reach a saddle with beautiful views in multiple directions. Really, really,  beautiful views, worth every step. Then the fabled Green Gate...On the way up a tour guide coming down had told us we would not be able to get to the top, that there were trespassing fines for anyone without a guide etc., but this was patently not the case, and we can only assume he was touting for business by frankly, lying. We though we will try anyway, see what we can talk our way past so up to the green gate we went. There was a guard there, who didn't speak any English (or didn't want to) but when we noticed the gate was actually unlocked and said we were going to go through, he handed us a sheet to sign... A disclaimer saying we understood the risks and also a log so they would know who was on the hill to make sure everyone was accounted for at the end of the day. We wondered if the lack of communication was an way of soliciting a bribe, which would have been unnecessary but who knows... We were through and elated.Terrain gets much more tricky now; not climbing as such but some very steep and exposed scrambling.... so need decent footwear and a bit of a head for heights. Plenty of opportunity to stop, catch your breath,and take in the views which were just stunning. I guess about an hour to the top, marked with a cross, which isn't quite the highest point but as far as you can go on the trail. (Going any further up would be serious rock climbing, probably not allowed and not possible without ropes and proper gear).So there you are, at the top. Did I mention the views? Absolutely stunning. Genuinely breathtaking. In all directions. Sea, lagoon, reefs, mountains, forest, sky, clouds, rain clouds. Oops. Headed are way.  We headed down but within minutes were caught in torrential rain which continued for the rest of the trip. Coming from a cold country, it never fails to surprise me when rain equals soaked, but doesn't equal cold. It did however make the climb down pretty hairy, as the footholds which on the way up had been dry and grippy, turned to wet and treacherous, with inches of water cascading down the gully you were trying to descend. Never so we feared for our lives, but pretty unpleasant with several slips and skinned and bruised body parts as a result. Definitely not recommended.But we made it down safe and then back down the easier section in the torrential rain, splashing through puddles and frankly loving every second. Far from ruining the day, as it could so easily have done in a cold climate,  it turned a great day out into something truly memorable.So try really hard to do the up and down in the dry, but do it you must. It was easily the highlight of our two weeks stay on this beautiful island."
227,Nice hike ,Magnificent view to the Mauritius and the ocean. Very important is to start your trial early morning. In january the heat start from 10 o'clock  at morning .!!
228,go Mauritius,"We walked from the riu resort and were out for 5.5 hours in total! It’s a 4 hour hike for sure. We didn’t get a guide as we weren’t planning to walk all the way up. However there weren’t any clear “half way” signs etc so we felt like we could just go “a little further” and then ended up scaling it! Oops! You can walk safely up most of it until you reach some green gates. I’d say that’s about an over half to 2 thirds mark. Then the final bit is basically a scramble/climb. It’s possible to do it without expertise (we did it) but it is quite challenging and shouldn’t be taken lightly! Also it’s quite dangerous. There’s a lot of cliff edges where if you fall, you’re probably done for! That said, lots of people were doing it. I’d say if you are fit, not alone, have your wits about you, and it’s good weather, you’ll probably be ok. Go slowly and safely. Avoid anywhere near the edges. I went down on my bum a lot of the time coming back down so I wouldn’t fall."
229,Must do,"Not our first visit to Le Morne as it’s  a lovely opportunity to sit on the beach, enjoy the breeze which is always there at Le Morne and watch the kite surfers. This however was our first opportunity to do the hike up the mountain. That is an easy trail up to the half way point. You need a guide and be a climber I understand for the second part . I Include pics from the beautiful views from the hike up Le Morne"
230,Hiking adventure with history and spectacular views,"Visited there in June with my wife, had a absolutely fantastic hike up with breathtaking views at the top. Once past the green gate it’s more of a climb than a walk (i.e looking for handholds, etc) but the view from the south lookout near the picnic spot is just as good.Would recommend parking near the Kite Lagoon (20°27′36.73″S 57°19′13.01″E), via the road that runs along side the RIU resort. Apart from spectacular views of the kite surfers surfing across the bay, it’s also way easier to access road wise than the entrance to the 3.5K hike (which is in some serious need of repair!).A great day out and highly recommended! Ps. You don’t need a guide and you can rent a car to get there for about £22 per day, which is usually cheaper than a organised trip."
231,Climbed the Mointain,"EVERYTHING WE WISHED WE'D KNOWN ABOUT THE HIKEFirst and foremost, totally worth it! Beautiful hike and amazing views! We hiked it early Jan, 5 days after a CAT 3 cyclone- so fairly wet season. Be prepared to get muddy. The first bit to the main “South West Viewpoint” is strenuous because it’s uphill, but doable for all reasonably fit people, kids included. The view from here is phenomenal. If this is as far as you go- it’s still worth it! From sign in gate, to very top and back = 3hrs.From here to “the top” where the metal cross is, is no joke. If you’re a seasoned rock climber it’s probably a walk in the park. If you’re fit and not afraid of heights, it’s doable. Would absolutely not recommend doing this section with kids. Do not count on there being chains along the climbing sections to assist you- there were none when we were there. There is no marked path, you’re relying on well-worn looking areas and good foot & hand holds to lead the way. You’ll go through a green gate and the first bit is just a bit of scrambling over rocks, etc. No big deal. Then you’ll come to arguably the hardest bit. It’s sort of a tall, rocky wash-out going up at enough of an incline that you’re climbing with hands and feet. Honestly, it’s easier getting down than up, and it’s not something you’d want to fall down once you’ve committed to climbing. Once you’ve made it past ‘the hard bit’ it’s more of a scramble with a brief few climbing sections to the top. There are definitely a few points where if you’re queasy with heights it might not be a great idea to look down. At the top there is a large metal cross and assuming a cloud isn’t sitting on top- you’ll be treated to AMAZING 360 views!-MOSQUITOES: bring repellent, they are plentiful but not insane-WATER: Bring at minimum 1L per person. And for the love of all things holy- Pack in Pack Out! It was so sad to see the hundreds of empty plastic bottles in overflowing bins near the top of a remote UNESCO site. It weighs nothing. Take it with you. There are even big, designated recycling bins around the island.-THE RAIN: The entire hike can be done the day after a decent rain. We did it 5 days after a cyclone and one day after a downpour. Could be done in a drizzle. Just expect to get your feet wet and muddy. Would absolutely not attempt the top section of the hike in actual rain, or if a downpour were predicted. You would literally be climbing UP a mountain and near drop-offs on muddy, slippery rocks. You could do the hike to the South West Viewpoint in a decent rain (not heavy downpour), but the view may not be great.-PARKING: The turnoff from the road to start of hike is 1.5k long. It is a very muddy, potholed road, though many a small car makes it to the parking at the base of the hike. If you choose to park by main road and walk it, add 15-20min to your estimated time.-TIMING: 3pm (3:30 at the absolute latest if you're the speediest person on earth and plan on not taking any rest or picture breaks) is the latest to start the hike from the base to the top. All the times listed here are real times for two pretty fit, in our 30's, steady pace but taking breaks here and there for water or to take pics and enjoy the view (times listed are not the 'people say this hike takes 5 hours', but then you reasonably assume that really means 3)- Entry Gate (where you sign in) to South West Viewpoint: 60 mins- If you stop to enjoy the view and take pics: +10min (or however long)- South West Viewpoint to “the hardest bit”: 10 min- “the hardest bit”: 10 min- from end of “the hardest bit” to the top: 20 min - If you stop to enjoy the view and take pics at the top: +10min (or however long)It takes just over half the time to get down as it does to get up. We made it 500m down the potholed road in our little Suzuki before we parked (though I reckon we could have made it further). From there, back to the car took us 3.5 hrs. I wish we would have brought a book or snacks and enjoyed the views longer!"
232,Heritage site with stunning views,"We didn’t hike all the way to the top due to lack of time and proper gear...but there are plenty of beautiful views to be seen. We turned around at the north viewpoint. In total it was 3.25 miles there and back and about 1 hr 20 min (that includes water breaks, taking photos, etc). I loved learning the history of this place too. Highly recommend!"
233,Le Morne Mountain and Le Morne Beach,A day in this area would be well spent.  Great for hiking with spectacular views as a reward.  Even better reward after a 2-3 hour hike is the beach below which is one of the most beautiful in the world.  If it's tourist season start early as this area is very popular.
234,Le Morne - worth a visit,A very beautiful mountain with very steep flanks.A must see not even for geologists.In mauritian winter very often in mist an clouds. :/
235,Amazing views! ,"its lovely mountain, i was not hiking because we arrive late there and we didnt have equipment for hiking at night. we went around the mountain and visited the beach. beach was amazing, but it is windy all the time, so its not good for swimming, but it is great for surfing."
236,Difficult but with amazing view,Yan and Henri of yanature provide a great guided educational hike to the top of La Morne  Brabant. The hike is not very strenuous if you are in good physical condition and are willing to take a challenge with a big reward at the end. The view from the top is breathtaking and you get to enjoy the hike while Yah and/or Henri gives historical facts about the mountain and location.
237,Le Morne Brabant hiking,"We did hiking with YaNature, very nice guys.Start at 6 am (they picked us from the hotel) and back at 9:30 am which is very convenient - you have all day ahead. Views are amazing!However it is more climbing than hiking! Sneakers are obligatory! I strongly do not recommend it for old people, children and people with additional weight!They made this tour even when raining however I personally do not recommend it - too slippery."
238,Worth the journey!!,"We did the hike with Allan, a local from the village of Le Morne, who is a professional guide and it was definitely worth paying the little extra for a guide.  Allan was so knowledgeable on the local area and was more than happy to share stories of his village, the endemic…"
239,One of the most beautiful views on the top! If you make it...,"Beautiful area with lots you see and do,  great watersports, trips and local villages, great scenery and views, both mountain and sea."
240,Beautiful Area,"Le Morne Unesco World Heritage Site, very beautiful specially at Le Morne beach... 'a shelter by runaway slaves, maroons, through the 18th and early years of the 19th centuries' & 'a symbol of the slaves’ fight for freedom, their suffering, and their sacrifice'"
241,UN Culural Heritage site - closed-off behind iron gates,Great to see this mountain every morning looming over you. Stayed at a resort at the foot of the mountain.
242,do it!,"No need for guides to take you (almost) to the top. From the access point (about 2 km from Riu Hotel on southernmost tip of Le Morne Peninsula or 1.5km from main road to/from Le Morne village), it is an easy 3.6 kms hike. Unfortunately, on the day I went there, the hike ended 200m from the top as the rope needed for the final leg was not in a good condition and would have to be replaced. Nevertheless,  I had already savored incredible views of  Le Morne peninsula.This 3-4 hour hike is highly recommended. You can do it without any guide."
243,wow magnific!,"Le Morne has nice hotels and interesting things to see. The beach is beautiful and the water is turquoise.You can do wind and kite surfing (we do kite surfing) as well as wave riding. Just take care that you wear some shoes in the water as there are loads of corals or sea shells and even stone fish (which are poisonous). But with a little care, nothing will happen to you. The snorkeling is also quite good as they have loads of corals. We also went swimming with wild dolphins. They were quite curious and spent quite some time with us.Also, you can go up Le Morne mountain and enjoy the view.You can also rent a car an drive around the island and see other interesting things."
244,"Fantastic trip, but be careful!",Went up Le morne the other day - first it's a easy walk and then I reach a closed gate to go to the top. Here you have two choices:1) you climb over the gate2) you bribe the security guy The last hike is quite tricky and at times you really have to climb...Worthwhile for a Sunday morning trip
245,Stunning views but some issues with Yan,"We read about Le Morne and drove by an earlier day where a sign showed the access road to the mountain. We did not book a guide as we thought it was an easy enough hike ... and in general it was.We parked the park at the gate, needed to sign in and out to ensure that nobody is left behind :-) The hike up the gate is a leisurely walk ... we did not realise that the gate would be closed and the security guard told us that we are only allowed with a guide at EUR 25 per person. I argued with him but without success. Than a young boy as presented as our guide ... we overtook that chap on the way up before and saw him smoking earlier. Not really what I would expect but what to do. The gate opened but as he was rather slow, I overtook him and left him behind as he did not appear at the top even so that I stayed for a while to take pictures. There were a couple of other groups who had a guide and they looked for sure more professional.The view was stunning and was a great reward. It took me about 25 minutes to go up and about 15 to get back down to the fence. There is some climbing to be done, but not close to the edge. For people who are afraid of heights this might be an issue nevertheless. My wife and I actually ran down back to the car and were back in about 30 minutes.I told the gatekeeper at the car that there were boys asking for money and he said that should not be the case. Anyhow even so that I saw our guide later on ... resting ... we did not pay him and he did not try to bother us again."
246,Le Morne Brabant climb ,"This is a fantastic thing to do but beware you need to be very fit. We went with Yan of Yanaventures who was good but I would agree with another reviewer that he rushes the visit a bit too much. He also expected us to sit in the back of a truck on the way back which is frankly unprofessional and dangerous. He doesn't wait for you too at the hotel as we were three minutes late and he had already left! It was only because of providence that we actually made the tour. He should wait at least five minutes for those who have already paid for the tour. He also did not appear to be aware of which hotel we were staying in despite booking the tour the night before, causing avoidable transportation issues at the end. The beginning of the tour was also disorganised and we wasted half an hour as the Mautourco representative was in the wrong place. It is still worth doing this trip for the spectacular views but be careful which tour company you go with. Yan is friendly and a good guide but has some issues he needs to improve upon."
247,Great Views,"The road goes around the entire Morne peninsula. To get to the start of this trek you can either go the long way round anticlockwise on the main road, with the last 2 km or so over rough cobbles and then dirt track, or you can go round clockwise on the dirt track and travel 1.5 km. Once you get to the entrance of the walk it is very obvious and there is plenty of free parking.  As you walk through the entrance, you sign in your name and the number of people in your party (for safety reasons) and when you finish the walk you sign out. We only went up the first 2.5km to the South West Viewpoint and did not attempt the last very steep section. It was a steep but easy climb for us and the views over the coral reef and surrounding mountains were spectacular and well worth the climb"
248,Challenging but STUNNING!,"We climbed Le Morne mountain in March 2016 guided by Yan, the owner and founder of Yanature. The booking was made via our hotel rep. Picked up from our hotel at 5.10 am we started our ascent (in vests, shorts and trainers) at about 6.15 am. The mountain is 1500m high and the trail was easy to start, then much steeper and finally included an enjoyable but steep scramble to the cross at the top. It took about 1 hour 45 minutes to the top and about 1 hour down. We were back at our hotel around 11 am. We loved the climb! Yan was an excellent guide who clearly loved the mountain and encouraged us to share his feelings for it. He made a brisk pace but was considerate to slower walkers and reassured everybody that we should enjoy the walk and not worry about it. The cool of early morning and pleasant breeze made this a challenging, but never exhausting climb. The views were lovely - see my pictures! One 6 year old girl joined our group and I am 62, but still had no problems! At the top Yan talked about why this place is a Unesco world heritage site, and how many slaves jumped from the summit to their deaths fearing re-capture by British soldiers. The metal cross on the top was transported by Yan himself many years ago - a mark of reverence for the site. This walk will be a highlight for us of Mauritius and it made a great alternative to simply sunbathing on the beach! (Mind you, that is nice too!) I unreservedly recommend this walk!"
249,Crazy hike,"The climb to the midway point was a bit gruelling for unfit people such as myself, but what we saw from there was totally worth it. I had read that further up was a scramble, so we did not venture further. The approach to Le Morne, however, was extremely rugged, with an unpaved road, and we were scared of getting stuck in the mud en route. Signage on the trail was also non-existent. These are the only reasons I would give it 4 stars.Carry water, nibblies and lots of mosquito repellent. Oh, and don't forget your camera."
250,good but the top is blocked,"We went without a guide, and would only recommend that if you have experience with climbing and trekking. It's not real climbing but some parts that are not for everyone. If you are afraid of heights or haven't been on a mountain where you have to crawl up the mountain side go for a guide. We used 50 min to the top and the view was amazing. Must visit!! Also would recommend the beach that is near."
251,Short hike with rewarding views ,We were visiting on a taxi tour of the area and came away with mixed feelings. The area was beautiful sand and sea at the base and excellent fantastic panoramic views at the top but also sadness of the history of the struggle of the slaves and the pain this area represented for them...
252,"Worth the hike, beautiful!",We found a blog on the web that described the route in detail so hiked this on our own - an excellent 3-4 hour hike.  It is in 3 stages with stage 1 being achievable by anyone with moderate fitness. Stage 2 involves scrambling up rocks using ropes and the 3rd stage needs climbing equipment and a level of skill.  We got to the top of stage 2 and had an excellent morning out.
253,omg its high,Amazing time with friend at le morne brabant.  Quite a steady climb at frost followed by the more technical climb.  Does not require any guide. 10/10 would totally recommend.
254,Don't miss it!,"What a stunning and spectacular area this is.From the superb beach, to the cystal clear sea, to the imposing and magnificent Le Morne, this is truly a wonderful place to take a holiday."
255,A MUST DO,"1.5k from Hotel Riu Creole, 3k climb up the mountain (steep walk) and then an additional extra climb to the very top which is labelled as “dangerous”. My husband and I decided to do the steep section despite the warnings and despite having no climbing experience. While I would not recommend this to everyone- I will say that we were absolutely fine and had a wonderful time. The views were amazing and we were careful so we were fine.  On the way down we found a lady who was shaking from fear so we helped her get back down to the safe section. I’m saying this not to put people off but to illustrate that it’s not for e everyone. It took about four hours from leaving our hotel to arriving there again. It was wonderful and we’d definitely do it again!"
256,Honeymoon ,"Loved the excursion to Le Morne. I would not recommend it for very small children or elder people, because in some stretches you need to use the hands, but it is affordable. And the views are amazing!!"
257,Not for the faint hearted,"It's been our second time in lovely Mauritius, and this time we absolutely wanted to climb Le Morne Mountain, because we heard it was really worth the effort. A friend told us that Allan, a guy from the village of Le Morne, recently has got the permission to guide on this private domain. Allan is very proud of his country and his village and he explained us with a lot of enthusiasm about his ancestors and his country. He is very passionate with plants and nature and showed us a lot of endemic plants who apparently only grow on Le Morne Mountain. We are not that young anymore, but Allan was very patient, stopped at rely nice viewpoints  and made us reach the top on our own rhythm. What a beautiful day it was! The icing on the cake once you reach the top and look 360° around made it an absolute unforgettable trip we will never forget."
258,Stunning new walk up Le Morne,"In this area, it is a landmark impossible to miss. It is visually very dominating and creates a certain amount of its own weather too.  Early morning mist and the sun setting on it can be very dramatic, especially if you are fortunate to get a rainbow. There is a 4 hour walk to the top which I did not attempt. You'd need to be rather fit and very heat tolerant to do it I think but the views would be magnificent I would think."
259,"Stunning view, make it a 'must do'","What a magnificent monolith.  The views are spectacular.  We saw this from the air and from the ground.  Views over the land as far as the eye can see from one side, and over the sea from the other side of it.  It commands one's attention even before one hears the saddest story.  It is said that back in 1835 police went to Le Morne Brabant to inform the slaves that they had been liberated and were now free. The arrival of the police at the base of the mountain was misinterpreted by the slaves who had run to the summit because they thought they were going to be arrested.  They leapt to their deaths from the rock, landed in the ocean and drowned, rather than be taken back into slavery.  Such a beautiful place is tainted by this history."
260,Awesome view,"On our honeymoon we stayed at Lux* Le Morne which is around the corner from this mountain. We thought it would be good to go for what we were told was a ‘hike’ and we got a lot more than we bargained for.The hike started of great, be sure to use a good guide as a few of them that we saw on our way seemed very poor. I’ve added a picture of the business card of the people we used. A lot of information about the history of the mountain and Mauritius which we found very interesting and also the guide had great knowledge of the plants growing on the mountain and their medicinal applications. The second part of the hike is more of a mountain climb and anyone taking part should be fully aware that it is an actual climb and quite dangerous. It is however totally worth it as the views are breathtaking and we got a sense of achievement in making it to the top."
261,Do it!,Good to see mustvgo le morne is gud to see we went there               we enjoyed there 1 hour also..... enjiyed a lot .. but st regis stay was worst .. after that we enjoyed here... very bad services in st. Regis lu morne....
262,A wonderful experience,It is a scramble to the top no doubt - have to be on all fours for the last 100 odd meters which makes climbing down near vertical in some portions. But what views - truly spectacular - can't be a nature lover and not be floored. It was raining on and off when we went so that added to the fun. We went with Yan and he was very knowledgeable and also helpful in taking all members of the group along. Must visit !!
263,Hard work but incredible,"Amazing views from the top, highly recommend it! The track takes about 3 and a half hours up and down (7km in total). First two thirds are basically a walk through the forest and are very easy for anyone. The last third is more challenging but if you’re of average fitness you shouldn’t have any issues.There is a lot of reviews suggesting that you have to climb, need a guide or/and be a professional climber - that’s not true. In the toughest parts you have to scramble a little but definitely nothing close to actual climbing and perfectly fine without a guide. If you have hiked up Snowdon, this should be a walk in the park.If you don’t feel like going all the way to the top you still have some stunning views from the mid point!"
264,Le morne Brabant Mauritius - worth it ,"Not for the faint hearted.Easily achievable hike till level2 after which only experienced hikers should attempt hiking to the summit.Awesome view and history ,I would definately recommend visit to le morne"
265,Hard Work but worth it !!!!,We went to Le Morne Brabant on a beautiful day in May when we were out discovering the island. At first it was a bit tricky to find the right spot to start the walk but after some help from a taxi driver we got there. The last part of the road to the parking spot were a bit bumpy but it was fine despite our very small rental car. The walk took about 45 min to 1 hour to reach the second viewing point. The road was fair and from time to time steep. We recommend good shoes. The last part to the top of the mountain needs to be done with a guide and it also involve climbing. We did not do it and settled with the fine view of the second viewing point.
266,A good walk and climb,"Le Morne is a mountain on the South West coat of Mauritius. Hotel tour operators will try to sell you an excursion to visit and climb the mountain, with a ""guide etc etc. The cost was a couple of hundred dollars for 4 of us so we went self propelled. We parked our rental car in a car park near the foot of the mountain and took a steep walk, then a quite trick climb to the top. Approx 2 - 3 hours each way. Strong shoes, sun screen  and snacks/ water are recommended. The last half hour climb is quite tricky, and too difficult for kids or some elderly folk. The view from the top is well worth the climb. There was no entrance fee when we visited in July 2016, but they were tidying the car parks up and there might now be a small charge."
267,Tough the 2nd part,"I was joining one group to climb Mountain Le Morne a few days before, have to say during the way it's quite dangerous , some parts you need to climb by the help of rope , but during some ways you can only use your hands to hold the rocks tightly , you must be very careful and keep some secure distance with the people ahead of you. would advise experienced hikers to climb only. After hours when you reach the top, the view can only WOW you , too much beautiful even can't describe by words. the ocean the mountain the island the plants , you will feel all the efforts you have taken when climbing is really worthy !!!!"
268,spectacular views,"This was definitely the highlight of our trip. We had a lovely tour guide by the name of Alan who is also a guardian of Le Morne Brabant. The mountain is gated at a certain point which tourists have broken into and were observed jumping the fence to pass through. Alan become emotional at such behaviour as he explained that they have been trying to keep the mountains sacred and maintain its natural habitat. He showed us where tourists had opened up another route/trek on the mountain, destroying medicinal plants in the  process. People please considerate and respectful when visiting this sacred place."
269,Perfect place to be and no real complaints,"It was a tough hike because of the heat, so I would advise to start as early as possible and bring plenty of water. We did this hike without a guide and took a shortcut from the southern side of the mountain, which we found described in a traveller’s blog. However I wouldn’t recommend it as there were warning signs about prosecution for tresspassing and angry dogs barking behind the fences. You can start from the main gate as it is open for the public. We met a lot of people doing the hike on their own, and the path to the top is easy to follow. The last part of the hike is climbing, which can be done by anyone reasonably fit, but hiking shoes are recommended. The views from the top are amazing and well worth all the hard work climbing up."
270,Awesome,"One of those magical sights, a stunning black basalt backdrop when you are playing golf at Le Paradis."
271,Very good,"At the entrance of the trail, there is a sign saying that tourists can't go to the summit without a guide. It turned out that the only way to the summit is fenced off with a locked gate at the mini summit. It costs 800 rupee (20 euro) per person to hire a guide. It sounds like a scam as all safety ropes were removed ""for maintenance"". Anyway, from the gate to the summit, it was a bit steep and we needed to use our hands at times. The view was rewarding - black river gorges and Le Morne peninsula, but not as nice as Le Pouce (the thumb mountain). It took us a bit over 2 hours roundtrip."
272,Amazing,This Unesco site is a real symbol of the island and towers on the south west coast.  Lots to do in this part of island.  Right at the end of the peninsula is a lovely beach - windsurfers come here in winter to catch the swells
273,Awesome hike,"We went up with Bryn (Explorers Mauritius) and it was the highlight of our whole vacation. I would not recommend going up without a guide. The weather changed and heavy rain came in when we were on the way back down and I would not have made it down without Bryn, cause the rocks got super slippery and dangerous, especially the sections you have to climb. It was a big and fun adventure and Bryn was the perfect guide. The views are breathtaking and I would totally recommend such a tour if you're fit enough for some hiking and climbing."
274,Stunning birds eye view,"Easy hike that rewards you with amazing views of the two bays.Regular tennis shoes are enough. Do not fall into the trap of the ""guide"" requirement... the path is well indicated!"
275,Amazing Views,"Wonderful, amazing mountain with breath-taking views over the South-West corner of Mauritius.It's a slow road around the peninsula to get to the car park below the mountain. The path begins to climb as soon as you go through the gates and sign in at the very start. The trail itself is rough underfoot and quite steep in places. Every so often there were hairpins in the path where you could take on some water and enjoy the increasingly spectacular views (water is an absolute must by the way). Around about 3/5 of the way to the very summit, there are some over-filled bins and some local men who will offer to take you to the very top via the gate that is mentioned in almost every review we read. We decided to not go any further up as although we are fit hikers, we didn't want the risk of doing the climbing section so we can't comment on that section.It really is a must-visit place. You won't be disappointed."
276,Great experience,The most beatiful beach on Mauritius. Crystal water!!! The best view on the mountain. There were the nicest weather on the island.
277,"The slave route, Le Morne Brabant","We tried once and did not feel strong enough to safely reach the top and get down.  No guide, no ropes, no limit to access, just a book to sign in at the bottom then again as you leave.  We tried again a week later and made it.  It was tough for us as we were hot and not seasoned climbers, but we wore trainers and took plenty of water.  We are in our 50s so not as sprightly as those in their 20s but we are still fit.  It was worth it for the view."
278,Use a Guide!,We visited in the late afternoon. We did not do a tour or someting. But it was great to see this mountain if you know the histotie. Would have loved to have done a tour.I do think there are some opportunities for Mauritius to accommedate tourist more such as look out points and more info signs.
279,Better Get In Shape !,Definetly worth it if you are not  scared of hights! Friendly and knowledgeable guides that showed us indigenous plants and told us about the history of the place. Very interesting 3-4 hours trip.
280,Worth to the top,Actually not just kite surfers but wind surfers too.  When not windy kayak and SUP.   The RIU Hotels have the monopoly of the beaches though.  Nice snorkelling and plenty to see.
281,Early morning hike,"Not the most easy climb. You must wear good shoes, bring water and most of all be fit. The earlier you can go, the better. You could say that there are two parts. The first part is a more easy climb, and you have fantastic views along the way. The second part is not for those who are afraid of heights, it gets a bit more adventurous. But the views on the top are amazing and breathtaking."
282,Beautiful view. Only went to first viewpoint,"You need proper footwear, the ground is hard and the rocks volcanic so not for flip flops.   Also at the top of the walk there is a green gate which is meant to stop you from climbing to the top.   Of course this does not stop anyone as you just walk around the gate.   The warning is in French so some people do not even realise what they are letting themselves in for.   I was tempted to take a look and it is a good climb and scared myself coming down.   If you make a mistake on this climb it will probably end your days.   There are apparently tours with ropes, take one of these to be safe."
283,magical,"A big chunk of rock climbing involved but breath-taking view in the end.Around 800 m high? Short,couple-of-hour hike but fantastic work out."
284,"Le Morne, Le Magnifique","We spent a morning climbing the first half of Le Morne.  It took us a bit of time to find the path which leads up the mountain but once found it was quite straight forward.  The first half of the climb is basically a hike.  Took us about an hour to reach the  mid point where the gate is.  We elected not to do the second part of the climb after meeting a couple on their way down who said it had been a pretty terrifying experience (they did it without a guide). The views from the halfway point are incredible and well worth the climb.  There is a little bench perched on the outcrop where you can sit and see both sides of the peninsula.  The views are breathtaking.So in summary, a great half day outing.  Maybe one day we'll do the second half of the hike (which sounds less like hiking and more like mountain climbing)."
285,Exhausting but worth it,Made the trip up the mountain leaving the car park at about 9am. Initially decided to go it alone and not bother with a guide. However once we got to the gate and my wife (who is not the best with heights) saw people ahead using hands to climb up we decided to use a guide who was passing with another couple. The best decision! David was very knowledgeable and reassuring to my wife in the final climb and once at the top it was certainly worth it. All the way down to the car park David stayed with us and gave us a lesson on all the local flora and fauna. For RUs500 each for over 2 hrs of his time (and some biscuits at the top) we certainly felt it was good value.Make sure you take plenty of water and be aware the temp can be a lot hotter at the top than in the car park.
286,Great morning out with incredible views across the island and oceans,"If you are into the great outdoors, challenges and you are fit, then this is one of my recommendations on your trip. Views are Spectacular worth it!"
287,"Great views, worth the effort.","This is a climb to the top, three points of contact on the rocks required for the upper parts of the hike. The path is well worn. You do not need a local guide, but must be fit and have appropriate footwear. I would not advise to do this if the winds are strong or if rain is forecast. It was a little disappointing not to reach the actual top (this would require ropes etc). Views are awesome!!!"
288,Must see,"Almost didn't visit this hill/mountain due to many fearful reviews. I guess a lot of hotel guests and tourists don't have much trekking experience, and also undertake the hike in improper gear (sandals, flat sneakers without any grip). Sure, there are a number of stretches that seem a bit vertical, but nothing really scary. You can see most hikers slowly sliding down on their butts, which is certainly the safest way to go. But if you have at least some basic experience, you have nothing to fear and will enjoy the trip.Alas, you can't actually reach the proper top in the middle, but rather get stopped out on the side peak."
289,Long long climb to the top,The best beach area . Calm see and nice view to the mountain. Near to hotel Lux - public beach area.Also near is nice beach restaurant for lunch - with good prices .
290,Good place to visit,"The team is just amazing and very professional. They knew every part of the track and would stop time and again to explain about the fauna and flora of the region. Truly a must do in Mauritius and I have started talking about it to my friends and they are all excited in doing it too. Thank you, Yan and Team. We will be back for more!!"
291,Imposing,"The most green and best part of the island.  National Park nearby and lots to see and do.  Forests, coloured earth, tortoise, waterfalls, snorkelling"
292,Awesome hike!,"Nice big blob with beautiful beaches all around, spectacular views and it was named after a Dutch province...., and I am proud to be Dutch!"
293,A must in Mauritius!!,"I did this on 4th June this year and I must say that this needs to be done by a nature lover. Great hike, great guides, great group and most importantly great views.10/10 would do it again."
294,Amazing views,"Le morne Brabant has the most beautiful beach with a mountain backdrop. The warm sea harbours dolphins as well as the beautiful corals and fish, so snorkelling is a must.horse riding is also available .there are little islands like ile aux benitiers which be reached by private charters"
295,Le morne brabant,"My wife and I did the Le Morne walk in July this year from the St Regis Hotel. It was a 7 mile round trip walk and took us about 3 1/2 hours to walk from the hotel to the Morne, go up the 850ft and return down via the beach.The views are really superb and the walking is not too hard assuming that you have some reasonably sturdy trainers (some people were doing it in less-suitable footwear, but that would not be so easy). We decided not to undertake the final 100ft ascent as this was not roped at the time and looked very steep. More importantly, the views from the main viewing area we reached were great and allowed you to see just how the reef breaks are forming as well as giving a good sense of the kite-surfing area.A highly recommended half day activity."
296,A climb worth doing!,"This was an amazing hike/climb and I would definately recommend it providing you are moderately fit, have plenty of water and didn't have a big night the night before. It gives you a really good feel for the island and interesting historical facts of the island. Plus see if you can spot the purple butterfly. We saw a couple and they were beautiful"
297,Great hiking ,"nice and wonderful place to be. historic.. breathtaking, a place to visit, with nice surf spot. a must..."
298,An absolute must if you love to hike!,"This is a mountain hike made up of two parts.The first part would be you usual trail walk uphill. Anyone of moderate fitness should be able to complete this walk which is approximately 2.5 - 3km. At the end of of the trail there is view point that gives you nice views of Northern and Eastern Coasts of Le Morne.From here the trek becomes a lot more demanding and dangerous. DO NOT TAKE LIGHTLY. High level fitness is a must, with climbing experience highly recommended. The climb becomes a very steep scramble up the side of the mountain. Trees, razor wire, loose and falling rocks are a common hazard.One wrong step has the potential to cause serious harm, so tread carefully. There are no handrails to use through the accent.Ensure you have water and proper hiking shoe with sufficient tread. Do not climb in wet. Rain began on our descent and the rock faces became very slippery.The view at the top is very rewarding and the climbing experience itself is unique."
299,Great view,"Via Yanature booked The Le Morne Brabant hike. The hike itself starts around 6am and finishes 10am. So not for late sleepers. But is it worth it... Yes! It avoids the sun reaching its peak/ temperatures going up. But as part of the prep, bring at least 1liter of water, cause it will still be warm.Guides for the day were Dirk, Will and spider monkey Victoria. During the hike they spread amongst the group, getting to know the people on the hike and keeping an eye on how everybody is doing. Overall an awesome team and real good fun to do the hike with.The hike itself is around 6km (from the starting point to the top and back) during which you will be on the move for 2-2.5 hours (total trip is 4 hours). First 1-1.5km will be a normal uphill hike and the next 1-1.5km you will be on all fours, meaning you will be climbing using hands and feet. But the guides will help you out on how to best tackle certain parts. It is a tough hike, but the view at the top is well worth the effort.Overall if you wants to get of your beachchair, a hike with Yanature is definately recommended!!"
300,Awesome views!,We hiked all the way up on Sunday the 8th of January. We started the hike at 7 am when the gate was opened. At this time there only was a few other hikers. This really is the best time to start because there really isn't much space at the top of the mountain and it's difficult to get pictures when there is a lot of people. The ropes were still under maintenance so officially it is not allowed to clime all the way up without a guide. However at least today there wasn't a guard at the second gate and you can easily pass it although it might be locked. If you are fit enough and don't need the ropes for climbing there really is no reason not to go all the way up. On the way up I was terrified how would we ever be able to come done again. But it tourned out to be quite easy really.
301,Le montagne de la liberté,"We walked to the top of Le Morne Branbant today with our two teenage sons.  The first half is easy and the views are beautiful.  We had read TripAdvisor advice that you don't need a guide so had got a taxi from our hotel and arrived at 7am on our own.  The gates were closed but we pushed by the side.  We got as far as the steepest part and there was a guard who had closed a gate preventing us from going any higher without a guide.  There was a guide near by and we paid him 500 Rupees per person to take us to the top.  You were not allowed to go any higher without the guide.  This is a new restriction that was put into place on 16th December. The climb from the second station is tough and we had to use ropes to pull us up.  The view from the top is fantastic and I am glad we had a guide as it was much more difficult than we expected.  The descent is quite tough and we had to come down on our bottoms for quite a bit of the path as it was so steep.  We definitely recommend starting early as it was very hot by 9am.  We took 6l of water between 4 of us and drank it all.  Not for the feint hearted, or the unfit, but certainly worth getting away from our pampering hotel for some physical exercise and a chance to see wonderful views.  I would suggest you organise a guide in advance in case there isn't one waiting for you.  We would have been very disappointed to have gone that far and not been able to get to the top."
302,Acces prohibited !!!,"Le Morne Brabant is located on the southern part of the West coast and is a beautiful  small mountain of 550 meters high, it's is classified as a unesco  heritage due to its history. Mauritius, that was ruled by the Dutch at that time I believe, used slaves to work on the many plantations on the island. The runaway slaves used to hide in this mountain to avoid persecution. When slavery was abolished, some soldiers came to the mountain to announce the news, but the  runaways thought  they were being pursued and jumped from the mountain to their deaths. Nowadays a heritage center is located under the mountain, with a few grave stones. It is  a reminder  of the terrible and sad past. Besides the mountain there is a public beach where water sports are being practised. There are also a few good hotels nearby."
303,Hotel view ,"Took us just under 2 hours total. We didn't use a guide and only went halfway since I was a little worried about climbing. One at the top, the views were amazing! A little difficult to find, you have to follow the bright orange signs that say mountain access through a dirt road. You eventually come to a little parking lot and a booth where you write your name on a list before you start the climb!"
304,Best Vista on Le Morne Peninsula,If you would like to the very top (metall cross) you need to be fit and do not scared of vertical exposition. These days belaying lines are demounted so top section is rather like easy climb vs hike. Anyhow the view pays it all!
305,a bit of exercise and no doubt will add some great memories to your visit to Mauritius,"This is 100% worth the effort. I would suggest to take a guide with you, they have a key to the gate which means you can reach the top. Plus it is good to support the locals :)!It cost 5000MUR for two of us.We decided not to go in a group as we wanted a bit of a workout. Managed to get to the top in 45 minutes. I cannot recommend enough to set off early You can arrange a guide through your hotel! Enjoy"
306,Staggering views - but you have to have a guide,"The first half of the hike is steady and fairly easy for most people. Take water and wear trainers at least because beyond the green gate - about 2/3 of the way up, it does get a bit steeper and more of a climb than a hike.If it's raining, then be really careful as the rocks do get slippery.The trek takes about 3 hours round trip depending on your pace. We walked there and back from LUX* Le Morne Hotel and the round trip was about 10km."
307,Greatest view from the top,The most historic mountain in Mauritius. This place is stunning and is a UNESCO world heritage site. It's truly amazing and is an amazing wore down the west coast and if staying at one of the hotels at Le morne then it is an amazing background to look back in from the crystal waters in the lagoon. There is a guide that takes people up there but he is hard to find. In any event this place is beautiful. From the top you have a great view of the underwater waterfall on a clear day. Amazing.
308,Good Hike. No Guide needed,"Our trip to Mauritius includes many surprises or unexpected hot topics, but the Le Morne Brabant was one of the best hiking trips ever. Even without reaching the top (its not allowed any more) we had the chance to reach a good level to overview the island. Round about 60m below the peak is a little stop where you can go – but further on. With our Guide (you better book one) we were a group of 10 and it was an amazing trip. Passing the grassland part below the mountain you have to walk up to the peak around one hour. Select proper hiking shoes, we have seen some with Flip-flops – can’t believe the reached the top ;) enjoy the view and weather – I’ll come back soonEven if someone is telling you, you can go there without guide - book one, its even more save and with more fun - and only those guys have the key to the gate to enter the top level zone)"
309,Amazing view,"Everything has been said except our opinion on needing a guide. If you are a strong hiker (we are in our late 50s), with hiking boots, and there is no rain, there is no need for a guide to get to the cross."
310,Hike to sumit,"My review is divided into 2 - the first part was really great, mostly shade as you walk up and there are a few good spots to enjoy the view. It takes about an hour reach the South Viewpoint which is half way to the top. The second part was in my opinion too dangerous and you need to be fearless and in a good shape, if you do it anyway. The views were stunning, but not worth the risk!Recommendation: wear good shoes, bring a lot of water and do it early in the day and NOT if it has rained. If you go all the way to the top expect 3-4 hours."
311,Hard hike and great view,"It is not for people who are afraid of altitudes, who don't feel comfortable with climbing or for people not being fit. But once I climbed there, to the cross, it was one of the best experiences in my life. The view is breathtaking, the air is so fresh, the feeling after the way is so satisfying. Go for it. Take very good shoes, at least 3 liters of water per person, snack, something to make a picture and do it. As soon as possible, because the trail up takes approx 2 hours and after 10 am, the stones start to be hot.Amazing. Every single moment."
312,Mountain hiking,"Well I wish I could have gone to the top but I guess it wasn't meant to be, maybe next time. I made the walk and hike in the afternoon as it clouded over. It was a good walk and hike to get there from my resort. Not sure if the ropes were actually down or not but the sign at the beginning of the trail said they were. I went a good distance up the real and decided to turn around since I didn't think I would get to top because of the sign. Still a great experience."
313,Good hike,"Googling the hike is very confusing and makes it seem like you need to hire a guide or that it is private property and that you have to trespass.  This is absolutely not the case. Awesome hike, no guide needed.  There is a parking lot with plenty of space, and the trail is marked the entire way. Wear a good pair of shoes as there is some steep sections and places where you need to climb with your hands. Bring lots of water with you, and some snacks would always be good.  You can hike halfway and get an awesome view, so this is a good option if you have less time, or you do not have the fitness to do the more difficult second section where it gets very steep and you have to use your hands to climb sometimes.  It is never too dangerous, you just have to be cautious and have good balance. Getting to the cross at the top feels amazing, and the view is very special.  One of the best things to do on the island"
314,Great view at the top !,"Went up with a group orgainsed by Yann, really the most amazing views especially right at the top and well worth it, but wear trainers with grip or hiking boots - on the way up isn't too bad, but the way down can be pretty tough!  The organisers should be more informative, it's not a simple walk up and down"
315,Not 1 for the faint hearted,"Great rock formation on peninsular that is stunning to view. It's 556 m high and signposted from the road ""access mountain"""
316,Wonderful trip...,Our group only completed the first half of the hike.  You don't have to be an experienced hiker to do it.  great views from that point.
317,Tiring climb but super worth it!,"The imposing bulk of this mountain dominates the south-western corner of Mauritius and offers the promise of great views - which it delivers. The first half of the walk follows a well-made track up the lower slopes, through woods at first and then into more open areas. At around the halfway point there's a small hut and gate, with signs warning of the need to take a guide for the rest of the way up, The hut was unmanned when we were there and it seemed the warning could be ignored with impunity. However, things get significantly more challenging there onwards. The path becomes very steep, narrow and (if there's been rain) slippery. We didn't go right to the top, as we'd been told that the final ascent involves climbing/scrambling. But the views from lower down are still spectacular, both out to sea and inland to the landscapes of southern Mauritius. You won't need hiking footwear, unless you're doing the full trip, but do take plenty of water and maybe some sustenance - there's nothing available anywhere on the mountain and it can get pretty warm, especially on the way up.."
318,Breathtaking view!,This site is a UNESCO recognised world heritage site and truly believe sutiful it is. An awful tale of fleeing slaves gathering here to live away from their shackled lives  who did not realise when slavery was abolished on the island. Police and officials were seen vomig to their hideaway and many thought that they were to be recaptured and so they elected to hurl themselves off the rocks to their deaths below rather than be taken as prisoners again and have the hardships of slavery once more....they didn't realise that they were in fact free...such was the fear and loathing they must have felt for their captors. The place is indeed beautiful despite this very sad story. It is rugged yet peaceful. Nice to see something not commercialised on this island.
319,Must do hike! ,"Staying at Rui creole diving cancelled due to sea conditions.Decided to hike to summit for something to do  before lunch.Free entry just sign in book at entrance to trail and follow path the start very easy with nice views half way up with views both sides of rock of differant bays.Then go through gate to steep rocky path with ropes to pull yourself up on, it hard going but worth it for the view.I found   on the way down hold and go down backwards like absailing."
320,"Wow, what a view","The area opens at 7am. It is better to go hike before the noon as the weather is very hot.It took us about 50min to hike the first stage of the moutain, its easy and mostly in the forest. Then you reach a fence ""entrance"" to the climbing part of the mountain. This is where the real adventure begins. Do not carry anything, your hands need to be empty, as you are gonna be literally climbing up. It is not really dangerous, but you have to be super careful. The views up the top is amazing and worth the hike.No entrance fee, you can park your car right next to the gate.Bring the mosquito spray as it is VERY useful."
321,Le Morne Brabant hike,"one of the most beautiful spot of Mauritius combining a fantastic beach with crystal clear sea, a mountain offering a superb view of the island (if you do like walking up), kite surf experts and beginners, and a southern part with a more tranquil beach and mangrove facing an islet (ilot Fourneau)"
322,A good but tricky climb which you can do without the need for an expensive tour / excursion,This is the veiw from rui creole hotel le mont brabant the hotel is at the foot of it it's 500m high and to see it out of your hotel is breath taking
323,A proper climb that's worth the view ,ATTENTION: The hike is NOT EASY. You better be physically fit and wear proper shoes. Children and old people will definitely not make it to the top. Be ready for a real challenge and bring water.  It's a must do. The views are stunning and the history of the mountain gives a…
324,Hiking Le MOrne,"Think in Heaven, That's La Morne Brabant. Is not only for beaches, the forest and the Tropical feel."
325,huge lump of rock,Start early as this place is a popular tourist spot. Bring plenty of water as it is located in a very hot region of the island. Wear a hat also. First part of the hike is super easy. Second part of the hiking is more interesting. You will need to climb with your hands. Wear good hiking shoes. Avoid tennis shoes. Once you start climbing don’t forget to  stop and look behind to enjoy the beautiful view. Once you reach the top you will understand why so many people clim this mountain.
326,Kite Surfing dream,"Great hiking and stunning views, however a guide may be needed to access the summit, so book in advance. Open from 7am-4pm most days."
327,Nice views ,"So when my husband and I decided to do a guided hike of Le Mourne we had no idea what we were in for. The hike took a total of three and a half hours (but give yourself four just in case). The first part is moderate difficulty with steep but well maintained paths. Our guide, Teddy, stopped to show us the views and explain the plants with medicinal qualities. Then you get to the last 100 meters. Do not do this without a guide. It would be very dangerous. You pretty much scale the mountain. You're climbing using your hands and legs and the guide gives you suggestions of where to put your feet. It was almost vertical in some places. I'm scared of heights and have that instinct to, you know, live, so was terrified. But I wanted to make it to the top so pushed through. But if you tripped or missed a step you most likely would have broken something important. The views at the top were beautiful and worth the hike. Ironically going down was much easier. Go backwards so if you fall you fall back on your butt and not forward down the cliff. Only go in good weather. We lucked out and the rain started once we were down the hard part but if you'd added in slippery rocks during the ascent or descent it would have gone from difficult to treacherous. But, all that said, if you are okay with heights and in good shape, it's definitely worth it."
328,It's a MUST!,"If driving in, would suggest to get an appropriate car as the assess road is bumpy with big potholes at certain areas. I rented a car with a lower chassis and had to stop halfway and walked in as I was worried the car would get stuck or damaged.Started the climb at around 9am and finished it in slightly under 4hrs with a group of friends. Did not hire a guide although some in the group were inexperience climbers. Took it nice, slow and steady. Be prepared to use your hands to scramble up some of the steeper sections. Advisable to go on a dry day.Not technically difficult nor arduous compared to the several other hikes I have done in Tanzania (Mt Kilimanjaro) and New Zealand (Roy's Peak) before. Not the highest mountain in Mauritius, but certainly gives the fantastic panoramic views of the South.My advice is to bring lots of water, sunblock and a positive can-do attitude! :) Enjoy the Iron Cross at the peak!"
329,"Nice hike, great views, UNESCO Heritage site (history).  Good combination.","We booked a trip with a guide since you can only come halfway up on your own - spend the money on a guide if you like hiking. We used Yanature, at 1500 RS a person. It was the best - and you get the modt amazing and breathtaking views. Go as early as possible, where the weather (at least in february) tend to be better."
330,Mountain Hike with Yannature,Fantastic views of mountain and beaches.Kite surfing ideal at location next to Riu hotel.History of slaves attached to the vicinities and Le Morne Brabant mountain.Locals have stories relating.
331,just wow,"A National Heritage Site recently opened to the public, with amazing panoramic view from the mountain top. Highly recommended for hikers and mountain lovers."
332,Wow - what an amazing hike for some amazing views,"We went ,there on a weekend morning at 0930.way to the top 3.5 km to phase 1.no need for a guide. Great company along the way . We are not hikers. Breathe n walk according to your pace. Ok for a 2mins rest when needed. Determination is k. enjoy the experience. Checklist deepheat, bug repellent n water. We only used water. U might want  to go for a swim afterwards."
333,"Gorgeous views, hard climb to top!","We are relatively young and fit (we climb and run marathons). The previous reviews stated this was and easy climb....it is definitely not easy! But its not too hard, more challenging. The last part involves a scramble to the top (using a rope if needed) and then a descent on your bottom!It is 100% worth it though. The views, history and explanation of the island and mountain history is priceless.  Allan (our guide) has a very strong link with the mountain and is the only local guide wit family history to take you up (His grandfather worked and studied the mountain until he died and Allan has taken this over). He knows everything about the mountain and also the island.  Highly recommended (his website is being designed but you can book via his facebook page - local spirit Mauritius or his email is info@localspirit.mu.Summary if you are thinking of climbing the mountain:1. You need to be relatively fit (can walk for a few miles) and can scramble on your hands and knees2. You are prepared to sweat buckets!3. You need to get up early (between 05:00 - 06:00)4. You have a love of nature and plants5. You are keen to hear of the history of the island and the mountain6. You want to support a local businessI suggest you book Allan at local spirit - he is amazing and would highly recommend - he also has other things he can book you on but doesn't at the moment advertise - he gets his business word of mouth!Cost is about 1,500 rupees each and he can arrange collection for you if you are based on south of island (his brother collected us from Bel Ombre at a cost).ENJOY xx"
334,Excellant view,That is the must to see. Go in the very morning - no later than 7am. The path is easy but due to the temperature you need to have a lot of water (1.5l per head). Better to have good tied shoes for the last part of the trial.  Fantastic photos. If you plan to go by bus - better to go back the same road to the main road where you can catch a bus because if you decide to go along the beach it would be much much more far to the main road to catch a bus.
335,Really good restaurant ,"A group of us walked up here to seethe view and it was worth it. We didn’t have the time to go further and weren’t properly equipped anyway. It looked like a fairly serious climb and you would need decent footwear, water and protection from the sun, because unlike the climb up to the view point which is largely in the shade of trees, the next section looks much more exposed."
336,Phenomenal wind and kite surfing beach in Mauritius!,"The hike to the top (almost), where a cross has been put up in memorial of the slaves who once jumped of the mountain there, was a bit advanced and involved some easier climbing, but once up, the view was beautiful."
337,Worth the effort!,"You can do the hike without the need of a guide, if you have a car or a taxi to reach the entrance. The hike is easy until the green metal door, after that it gets steeper and people with fear of hights might get challenged. If you are quiet and attentive, you might even see monkeys!"
338,Ain't No Mountain High Enough,This place provides free car park and toilet facilities and it is FREE !   Good to be there around 7 am to avoid the sun when you descend from the  top. Do expect steeper slope nearer to the top though it should be manageable when done slowly and cautiously.
339,Challenging climb but well guided,"This is a place steeped in history. Le Morne , in the times before slavery was finally abolished on the island in 1834, was a place difficult of access and therefore a place where the last maroon slaves chose to hide. The most daring ones were hiding right on top of the mountain coming down only to hunt for food and water. The story goes that when these slaves saw the police at the bottom of the mountain, they knew that their last hiding place had been discovered. In desperation, they turned facing the sea in the direction of Africa, from where they came from, and threw themselves in the ravine. Their bones still lie at the foot of the mountain. The sad part is that, they did not know that the police were actually there to tell them that they could come down from their hiding place as Slavery had been abolished. Their mass suicide was in vain...but it became a symbol of the fight of slaves for their freedom. Now UNESCO has made that an international symbol.A monument commemorates this World Heritage listing where sculptors from nations that supplied slaves to the island , have each produced a piece of art in their own stone.This place is well worth visiting as it has an incredible aura around it.A replica of a slave village is being built and will be available for visiting in 2020.Authorised companies organise trekking right to the top of the mountain where one can discover a breathtaking view ...and place oneself in the situation where the slaves were before 1835.Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund is the government organisation that regulates the zone around the World Heritage site. It is wise to contact them for guidance especially for those interested in the cultural aspect of the visit."
340,Free and easy walk,We drove to Le Morne Brabant and spent a couple of lovely afternoons watching the daring kitesurfers and windsurfers.  There is always a strong breeze there.  we visited the memorial which was worth a walk around
341,Climb yourself,"We stayed at the Paradis Beachcomber hotel and while walking around the hotel, at the golf course, beach, at the pool we had a magnificent view of this beautiful mountain. Would go back to Mauritius just for this"
342,Views to die for !!! ,"Came prepared with boots and cycling gloves for the anticipated rock scrambling at the upper levels, was not disappointed. Travelled solo, travelled light - armed with bananas and 2 bottles of water, plus mobile. Since becoming a World Heritage site path is completely on public land."
343,Beautiful,"I was looking forward to this walk. However I ended up doing it as part of a taxi tour so didn't have enough time to make the most of it. The trail follows a rough track, concreted in parts. Its not too steep on the whole but does have some steeper sections. Any reasonable fit person could do it. The track takes you to a lower summit area with some spectacular views, some seating and a small shelter from the sun. This is where the trail gets more difficult. A path leads off through the bushes towards the steep hillside to the top. Unfortunately I ran out of time. There is a gate, which can be seen further up the hillside, and this is apparently closed at 4 pm. From there you can see the steep 'steps' leading up the side of the mountain. Above that is probably the section which involves the scrambling I've read about. Also be aware that the summit where the cross is, is not the highest point of the mountain. To reach the cross I do not believe you need a guide. Many people I passed had been to the top (cross) unguided. The lower part of the trail is sheltered among the trees so can be very hot. Plenty of water is essential.The start of the trail is reached along a rough dirt track from the main road. There is a small carpark and some toilets. You are requested to sign in/out of a visitors book at the entrance. It is well worth a visit if you like walking and views, but leave yourself plenty of time (3 to 4 hours at least, unless you're a fell runner)."
344,Beautiful,"We were not sure whether to do a guided tour or to go on our own. Then we decided to book a tour with Explorers Mauritius and definitely don't regret it! Our guide Bryn was very nice and made sure of our safety on every step of the way. The trip itself does require some climbing (with all four limbs) but overall looks more complicated from below the mountain than it actually is.Nevertheless I would recommend doing the hike with a guide (we used the Explorers Mauritius and it was awesome) as we had a chance to learn some interesting facts about Le Morne Brabant and Mauritius itself and we definitely felt safer with someone local who has experience in climbing and knows the area very well.Good shoes are a must (saw someone going up in flip-flops - not the smartest idea), also make sure to have a enough water (1,5 litre a person) and make sure to start the climb very early in the morning (6am) as it gets very hot even at 8am."
345,Great for watching kite and wind surfers,"This mighty impressive moutain dominates the skyline and is a major landmark in the area, our hotel was situated at its base, so it was a daily sight during our holiday.It has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2008. It was given the status in recognition of its function as a refuge/haven for freed slaves in the 19th and early 20th century.We were advised by the Thomson Rep, at our hotel, RIU Le Morne, that to reach the top could only be done with the assistance of a guide. A trip could be arrange, including a guide, at a cost of $50 (US) each.We chose not to take a tour, however we made our own way there to a  pathway/track, which is near RIU Creole, ask at the hotel for directions, it's not far. We did not go anywhere near the top but we were able to walk along enjoying the scenery, ocean views and appreciating this mighty structure and it's rock formations. We enjoyed our brief walking excursion, took in total about 1 hour and 20 minutes.Also situated at the foot of the mountain, in the opposite direction to the pathway, is the International Slave Route Monument, reviewed separately, another walking excursion.Do not undertake climbing this mountain during wet weather, even with appropriate footwear, it can be treacherous underfoot in certain places.Would recommend bringing a bottle of water especially when sun shining, remember to dispose of rubbish appropriately, sadly not everyone does so."
346,Le morne Brabant ,"I've been visiting Mauritius since I was a kid and I got to experience Le Morne Brabant for the very first time this year. The hike is long and can be a bit difficult for those who are not used to do this kind of exercise. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not a sporty or afraid of heights. HOWEVER, the reward when you arrive at the top of the Morne is absolutely mind blowing. I would also recommend a guide to go up there - especially since ours gave use the background history of the Morne. Must do in  Mauritius!"
347,Excellent hike,"Le Morne is a place with historical context besides its breathtaking view. Listed as a world heritage site, the mountain used to serve as a hiding spot for fleeing slaves. If one googles Mauritius a single photo of an ""underwater waterfall"" will show up most times. On rare conditions you can see the illusion happening from an opposite angle at the reef opening. In my opinion this should be your number 1 priority whilst visiting Mauritius."
348,Outstanding piece of rock,"We booked a tour via our hotel. The fee is 1500 per pax. Shld be quite standard. We started early and reached there abt 630am. The first part of the hiking was less challenging and it was just walking along the path with slopes. However at the second part of the hike, there were ropes and it's really steep! Though the route path were quite clear, it is still good to have guide to guide you up & down.The view at the top is absolutely stunning & rewarding! Would really recommend this, just have to be more careful 😊😊Tips: Do start early cos the sun gets really hot by 9am and the climb will be v exhausting by then!But, the transport is expensive!!"
349,amazing view and good for hiking.,"First time visiting Mauritius, and have had maybe the best hollidays ever!! Part of our relaxing hollidays was also climbing on top of le morne brabant mountain!! First time we were doing something as hiking, at it was great!  Someone told us that about Allan, a guy from the village of Le Morne!! Allan is very proud of his country and his village and he explained us everythinh about history of Mauritius and his country. He is very passionate with plants and nature and showed us a lot of endemic and uniq  plants who apparently only grow on Le Morne Mountain! I would recommend to everyone to spend a few hours and go on the top of mountain!!"
350,Nice Climb and views,"We did the trip to the lower, southwest viewpoint while carrying our one year old baby. It took us an hour walking pretty slowly. It’s not a technical walk if you stick to the bottom viewpoint. There’s no fee and you don’t need a guide.  They close the gate at the parking at 4 but you can walk around it to access the trail. The views are gorgeous. We left the parking lot around 1 and the sun was not directly on the trail but I can imagine in the summer in the middle of the day it would be quite hot."
351,Amazing  experience. Great guides,"Don't get me wrong - the view from the top is magnificent but I didn't have the chance to enjoy it. Let me tell you a story why. There are to parts of the way up. First part is pretty much easy, regular road. Then there is green gate with a guard who doesn't speak English and who doesn't let you pass unless you're a part of group with official guide (one of them was just coming down - you have to book it in advance and head out at 6:30 a.m. from the parking lot). This info is complety missing in tourist guide books. We were lucky because a lot of people was waiting at the gate and demanding entrance so in about an hour another guide showed up. I didn't mention one thing - currently (July 17) there is a warning sign at the parking lot which tells you hiking up the mountain is forbidden due to rope maintanance but guides do not respect this which kinda makes you rethink the warning statement - if guides are still going there are ropes really that necessary? Since our guide didn't speak word English I had no response for my question - is it dangerous if ropes are under maintenance? Let me tell one thing. I hike in the mountains and have some experience, I had good pair of shoes, I am in very good physical condition - even with the ropes the path is pretty much dangerous and a bad step can cost you your life. And you can imagine this without the ropes. Don't go there if ropes are still under maintenance - guides don't care about your life, they only care about your money. Otherwise no one would have been allowed to pass the green gate. And be prepared for dangerous and difficult climbing even if ropes are in place. Don't go there unless you have pretty good shoes and you are fearless of heights."
352,magnificent views but Yan was on the run,"Wow, what an amazing adventure climbing Le Morne Brabant.  Allan (localspirit03@gmail.com) is a fantastic guide from the local village with a personal tie to the mountain.  He is a very knowledgable and caring guide who made our trek memorable.  He knows a lot of the history of the area and is very informative about the flora and fauna. The views from various lookout points are breathtaking.  The first half of the walk is quite easy, but half way up it becomes challenging.  Allan encourages everyone in his group on the way up and points out ways to make the climb easier.  If you take a backpack, only take essentials like a camera and water, as it makes climbing harder.  Climbing Le Morne Brabant with Allan is an awesome adventure and is a highlight to a trip to Mauritius.  If you are of moderate fitness DO IT!!!  It is an exhilarating experience."
353,Spectacular views,"Le Morne has great views on the South Western coral reefs of Mauritius. The first 45 mins are basically a hike that is not difficult at all, although it is just walking upwards and can be a little bit tiring. Try to start early in the morning to avoid the crowds and before it gets really hot. Make sure you bring a cap, sunscreen and water! You have magnificent views from two different viewpoints just before the really technical climbing part begins. The climb to the absolute top is quite technical and seems a little bit risky. Personally, I am afraid of heights so I did not go to the top and stopped just after the first part where you really have to climb with your hands and feet. Unfortunately there are no ropes that you can hold onto anymore, so to me this was a little bit too much. The views from like half of the mountain are also really good, so dont worry if you dont make it to the top. If you do make it to the top, please remember that the metal cross is there for remembrance of the slaves who committed suicide by jumping off the cliff. You shouldn't  climb on it, treat it with respect. It's a dark history, but it's good to know before you hike the mountain so that you understand its significance.Overall you will spend like 3-4 hours hiking to the top, or just enjoying the view half-way."
354,Great Hiking Experience,"This is more than a hike - disclaimer - it does involve some serious climbing, on your hands and knees (monkey style). It is definitely not for the faint hearted. I would recommend this hike for all visitors of Mauritius, no matter where they are staying! We did the hike with Allan, a local from the village of Le Morne, who is a professional guide to this mountain (which has recently been opened to the public - but i would highly recommend going via Allan).With Allan you get the whole history of Mauritius and his village, as well as all the endemic plants and animals that live in the area. All in all, the hike is a serious one, but the views (not just from the top) are overwhelmingly amazing. Definitely a must do activity!!"
355,Hiking @ Le Morne Brabant,"Truly a magnificent sight to see this huge rock jutting out on the south west peninsula of Mauritius.  Unfortunately, the big hotels have crowded the beach front, but there is a public beach accessible to all.  Interesting history associated with the rock."
356,amazing experience,"Took a taxi to the mountain to the public entrance. Had to walk the last part to the public entrance cause the road was so bad for taxi. This was extra 1,5km easy walk. The last part of the climb was demanding, very steep so be observant with every step You take. Don't climb in rain, can be very slippery. Stunning view to all directions from top and from many spots during the climb. Totally according to sportstracker it was a walk/climb of allmost 10km. A very nice 4,5 hours hike in nature!"
357,You just can't miss this! ,"We started at 7.30am, it took us  less than 2hrs to reach the top.. (we did lots of water and photo breaks on the way) the 1st half is pretty easy as you are just walking uphill and 2nd part is a bit more tricky as it is steeper and you need to use your hands to grab on and climb up, there's almost no shades for the 2nd half too. I definitely recommend starting the hike early as it get really hot after 9am. We didn't use a guide, the path is pretty straighforward. The view is amazing all troughout the hike has you get to see the lagoons around le Morne. Recommend proper hiking shoes, sunscreen, cap, light clothing and plenty of water in your backpack."
358,A must do,"we had no previous experience in climbing neither we are in a  ""fit"" shape , therefore  were hesitant to proceed further after the board warning ""inexperienced climbers must not  proceed"" ,yet we decided to give it a try, at first the trail is not so difficult however later on as you advance you will have to scramble with your hands as higher it goes it becomes steeper and steeper,   but the views from the top are worth it ! PS  while we were making our way up , we saw couple with kids coming down ,needless to say that this has  boosted our decision to reach to the top :)) for all that  it took as 4 hours , the entrance is free and its accessible even by bus"
359,Mind blowing hike !,"We arrived around 10am and spent about 2 hours here, which included the walking up and down at a relatively leisurely pace. We went as far as the second view point and the views are spectacular! We were advised that the ropes were out of service  so we didn't try to go all the way to the top without a guide."
360,An unforgettable experience,"At the end they were right, but I think our 6 years old daughter (she did it ""only"" 50 under the final point) was far! too young for such trip. It is more climbing than walking ... but if you are over 12 and like nature, go for it!"
361,Beautiful Le Morne ,"If you are fit and a regular hiker - this is a piece of cake (2.5 - 3 hours; and you seldom find the views that you have from the top. Bare in mind that you need a guide to traverse the last section to the top (there is a locked gate)The 1.5km off road trail leading to the parking and start of the trail can be hairy. We went after some rain and made it, but with some serious bundu bashing. If you are not comfortable driving off road, take a taxi."
362,Amazing hiking experience,we had great time people are very friendly. ThanksFood was delicious our driver was very helpful and showed us very nice places and details.
363,Amazing!,"Before arriving here was reading some blog that 'til halfway is ok and then is hitting the difficult part. First part, like one hour is, is quite fine, puts your body to move but can be done by everyone. After the Yellow sign and after the green gate which should be closed, the steep part kicks in. I mean was expecting from different reviews and blogs to be really hard, was hard but acceptable. I have to mention that I am moving quite often, being an active guy.But being equipped with some simple Airmax 270, it was possible to make to the top, with my girlfriend and another friend of us, both of them not very sporty persons. But we did it. There are indeed some passages where you have to really climb with the hands and the legs, but it is ok. Take your time and try not doing it at 12-15:00 when the sun is burning. We were lucky that it was cloudy until we reached the top so the sun wasn't a problem. Be prepared to be all sweaty by the end but the view breathtaking! No guide is needed, but don't do it alone!"
364,"Great views, great guides!","If you are planing a trip in Mauritius, Morne it's a must! I do not like climing, i'm a beach fan and in my vacation i prefer relaxing not climing. But I am happy than we visit Morne! The views are breathtaking, and the climing is a medium one, but it's worth it! We did not clime on the top because the ropes were not on, but even if they let us I did not think I could make it because I'm very far away from an experimented climer :)."
365,Hard work on the way down,"After reading conflicting reports regarding guides decided to go with yanature. The start of the climb is at the end of a dirt track 1.5 km from the road it is signed. the gate opens at 07.00.steady climb up a jeep track to half way. There is a padlocked gate here don,t think guides are compulsory From. it is a steep rock scramble, loose in places could be tricky in the wet. The route is bolted but didn,t see any one with ropes. Great views from the top really enjoyed it. Yan the guide was a pleasure to be with would recommend them. Take plenty of water, and a good pair of walking shoes"
366,Well worth it,Great place good sea. Great view. Mountain. Forest sea. Long drive everything required for a long drive trip on the island
367,Awesome Dining Experience!,Historical place about how the slaves leapt from the mountain after misunderstanding that they were free. Now it has been listed on the World Heritage List.
368,what a beautiful place,"You have to go all the way to the end of the road (so around the mountain) to get to the parking lot where the hike starts. Start early in the morning so it won't be to hot. The first half of the hike is easy compared to the last half. It's about an hour to get you halfway. You have already a beautifull view there. A guide will take you to the top. He alone can open the gate. There are a couple of guides waiting in a small booth. They ask 500 rupes per person and will help you to the top. This part is a bit difficult. It's pretty steep, but just take your time and you'll manage. In about an hour you are at the top. And the view is amazing!"
369,Awesomeness,"Climbed at 7 am on a sunday. Only saw 2 other people on our way up. Got to the south west view point and stopped to feed the baby and then came down as the final section is a bit of scrambling and can be slippy when wet so we decided not to risk it with a 6 month old. Saw lots of people ascending on our way down. Took is about 2 hours from trail start and back including the feed. Lovely views, worth it even if you only go that far!"
370,Le Morne Barbant climb,"Clean, very quiet and beautiful contryside. Local people very friendly and helpful. A very safe place"
371,visually arresting and dominating volcanic feature,"amazing place, so scenic. clear waters, beautiful beach. everything was lovely about this place. excellent."
372,Wonderful walk with excellent guides!,Le Morne Brabant is a truly magnificent high point of Mauritius as well as being a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The climb itself is moderately easy and at first has a trail that eventually leads to an extremely steep rock climb of sorts. Le Morne Brabant is 550 metres and the highest altitude that you can climb to is 515 metres. The view at 515 metres as expected is sensational; offering a view point over the multi coloured sea as well as the major close by resorts and neighbouring mountain range.
373,Good place,"Very nice definitely recommend! But not to people who are really afraid of hights. Bring a lot of water, some snacks and have at least 3-4 hours time. Take a guide."
374,Well worth getting up early for,"Fantastic part of Mauritius, lovely beaches, great hotels, and superb people. Can be a bit out of the way to get to the north part of the island, but reasonable prices taxis if you look on trip advisor to get you around the island."
375,Amazing View,Absolutely worth all the sweat! :D Stunning views around the south cost. Make sure you have enough water with you.
376,Top must see! !!,"Whilst holidaying at the Le Paradis hotel , I asked the hotel for a guide who could lead and accompany me up the LE Morne Mountain.They kindly arranged for the guide by the name of Yan to collect me at 6am for this trek.What a wonderful guide!. Yan is knowledgable and passionate about the outdoors. He takes people up Le Morne mountain safely and at an accommodating pace. Yan also runs tours to the Black River Gorge and Peak, Chamarel Single Edge Track, Tamarin Falls and several other .I highly recommend calling him or contacting him via email as below.I cannot wait until I return and make use of Yan's personal guiding and knowledge. He also pointed out several birds to me and advised that he can find several others I have been looking for in Mauritius. Definitely next time! Contact Yan at yan@trekkingilemaurice.com or +230 5785 61 77"
377,Amazing cirwd,Great morning activity. We were told to do at 7am but tooo many early mornings. We went 10 am did half the mountain and still had fun! The half climb (which is still about 2km) is fine for all ages but it’s steep at points so lots of huffing and puffing but manageable. We had kids ages 7-16 and all did fine. Views are spectacular so no need to climb further if you are a novice. Also if you go only half way no need for a guide as there is a path. Bring water!
378,"Awesome view, awesome guides! Highly recommend 😄",A beautiful unspoilt area of outstanding beauty. We would most definitely want to revisit. We visited the waterfalls and swam with Dolphins. An amazing trip
379,Awesome!,"Gorgeous peninsula of the sandy Le Morne beaches & towering monolithic Brabant at 556 m. Luxurious St Regis. Practical Riu resort. Flat waters of jitters' bay. Chops out in Manawa, Chameau & One Eye. Club Mistral offering windsurf, kiting & other sea sports. Many standalone schools operating from vans. First kite in the waters at 9. Crowded at mid day. Ample parking. Not easy to access unless you drive."
380,Amazing view but for fit people,So having read the many reviews on here we decided for the cost of approx £30 pp it was worth using a guide!We used a company recommend from this wed site called Yanature(see separate review)We started at 7 am before the sun came up and we were really glad we did bc it got very hot as we progressed!The start is flat then starts to climb.When you get to the fence where you can go to with out the guide it starts to change.From here a guide is recommended-why bc at some points you are literally climbing a rock face!Our guide talked us through each climb .The climb to the top was well worth the effort and we got a great picture of the island!
381,Spectacular,"Certainly an impressive chunk of rock you can see down the south-west coastline. It took me four trips to discover Le Morne has a sad story, as many Old World slaves lost their lives, hence the UN memorial. But what's the point of having a memorial that no one can visit? Hence the poor marking. Apparently (I was told) that it's only open on Bank Holidays. Magnify map for the official site map."
382,Stunning worthwhile climb,"randomly decided to climb it one day... First bit, no problem (we're generally fit people). Next bit was good fun, climbing and great views. Then started to get a little trickier... We got to about 50m from the top where there was a decent plateau to rest with incredible views and a nice breeze. We felt the last bit seemed a little dangerous, although we didn't use a guide so may have been different with one. Even without getting to the top top, was a well worth excursion (took a little under 4hrs with lots of breaks). Take plenty of water, sunscreen, a hat, and at least half decent shoes for the climb."
383,Worth viewing the bay from the top!,It was such a splendid view....but the weather was not on our side all day long....still we made sure to enjoy ourselves....😁
384,"Beautiful, wonderful and gorgeous","Well when you are living in a place full of mountains and you are almost every weekend hiking ...probably that place is too easy but I have to say is beautiful and if you are going to Mauritius is a must. If you are a Sport person is easy and you just need both hands and I think when is a person that never practice sport could be a little bit hard but you need just more time. Going to the top in some parts could be dangerous more when is a windy day (our case) but go ahead you must do, the view is beautiful and you can take amazing pics."
385,"Great climb, even for the inexperienced. ",Did a tour with a local guide. He was excellent. He knew a lot about the flora and fauna and about Mauritius's history. The views from Le Morne Brabant are incredible.
386,Breathtaking - amazing - unforgetable...,We are having a superb stay here. Thnks to Lux LeMorne team. Hats off to all of you. Manav fadeel Veeshay and even Bhavish cashier  Vijay from Beach Rouge had made us feel really at home. A big thnks to the Chef. Chef Vishal the food is just miaaaaam.
387,A physical hike with a breathtaking view at the top: no better way to spicen-up a fantastic week at the beach!,"I went on the early morning trip to Le Morne Brabant with the operator Yanature. At first I thought.. getting up at 5 on a holiday... why?! But as I felt the sun burning during the hike, it came to me ;)The hike is most certainly not an easy one. The first half is okay, walking along the dirt road stopping every now and then for the views. But then... the actual climb begins and I must admit I did struggle! It's a long way up and it sure is hot. Large part of it is spent crawling rather than walking.Make sure to bring 2 liters of water per person and perhaps also an energy snack for the way down."
388,Mind blowing ,"We read a lot of bad reviews about this trek, that you have to bribe ""guides"" to unlock the gate etc. When we started about 3 pm there were no people around. Yes, the gate was locked but it is easy to get around the fence in both directions from the gate if you do some scrambling under the bushes. The way up from the gate is steep in some parts but not that exposed. The track ends on a little rocky promontorium. Great view from there but, no, this is not actually the highest point. Still a nice trek. The trek starts a km or two from the main road, its well signposted from the road. We stayed in La Gaulette and rented bikes there, about half an hour away from the signpost. All in all a nice trek."
389,Climbing Brabant,"Challenging, but if you make it all the way to the top, well worth the sweat. Don't attempt if you are not fit!"
390,Nice secenic view,"Our hotel booked a guide called Alan for us who met us soon after 6am at the bottom of the climb. There were only 2 others in our group, 4 all together plus Alan. On the first part of the climb (walking at a steady incline for about 2 hours) Alan showed and explained numerous medicinal plants and their uses which was super interesting, and allowed us a bit of a break every now and again! The second part of the climb comes after a gate which marks as far as you can go without a guide. From the gate to the summit was mostly scrambling and climbing up and over rocks - one wrong move and you'd probably meet your end, so a guide is essential and you do need to be quite fit. We had about half an hour at the top, looking at the stunning lagoon and surrounding views. Descending the rocks we had climbed was a bit unsteady in places, again a guide is essential. We left the summit at 9:30am and the sun was very hot and strong on us on the way down - I definitely wouldn't want to do the climb in that sort of heat so starting at 6:30 in the morning would be the best option (2:30pm was also offered and it was over 30deg by then - don't do it!). It was an unforgettable experience and one you shouldn't miss!"
391,Scenic & Historic place! Definitely worth it! A must-see place!,You have to register but it's free to get up. The first half is easy to get up on a way. The second part is getting more interesting but easy to find the way up. On the way up I thought it will be tricky to get down but it went smoother than I assumed;)Bring closed shoes and enough water and it will be fun;)The view from the view points and the top is great:)
392,A beautiful location to visit,"We also went with Allan who was recommended by the Lux. Both of us are 58 years old and were the oldest on the hike. There is a lot of scrambling on this hike, viz. using all 4's to climb rock and coming down using all 4's to decrease danger of sliding. Allan is a proud and excellent guide sharing botanical and historical information, providing water (bring a snack and your own water also). Wear appropriate hiking clothing!! A great experience, but be in shape."
393,Hiking,"We rented a car to drive around Mauritius and drove from the Westin Turtle Bay in Balaclava.When you turn off the main road to the road that reaches the parking lot for the start of the trail to Le Morne Brabant, you have to drive 1.2 km on a dirt, uneven 1 lane road.  This trail is popular so the parking lot gets full.You can put your name down to register at the start of the trail.  Bring plenty of water.  We got there at 2 pm and it was hot because there is no shade..  The path is stony with elevation."
394,Paradise,Recently stayed at RIU Le Morne just in time for the cyclone!! Chef Manish will miss your lovely food
395,Enjoyable but challenging trek with amazing history and views,"The hike will take approx 1.5 to 2 hours to ascend and 1 hour to descend, including stops for water or food.Do not pay for a guide as the path is well indicated for anyone with a basic sense of direction.You can go as high as you want. I went pretty close to the summit but stopped just short as didn't want to run out of water.Regular trainers are enough and carry at least 1 litre of water per person and some energy snacks to keep you going.I'm relatively fit as is my wife but this was our first hike ever. Honestly, not that difficult but the views from the top are sensational!"
396,Perfect care and activity!,"We took an island getaway on Mauritius and La Morne was one of musts on our To do list. It was one of the best experiences on the island. We did this hike without a guide and did not have any problems, because the path is easy to follow. For someone in poor/fair hiking condition I will recommend a guide, just because of the last part of the path.  Definitely take hiking shoes (specially because of the last part, where you need to climb), some water and sun cream as well. View from the top is stunning and worth some hard work to get to the top!"
397,Beautiful place full of lovely people ,Entrance is free and so is parking. The gates open at 7am and there is a bit of shade at the beginning of the trail. The last 300m or so requires rope and it was under maintenance at the time we went. There were lots of hikers who pushed ahead despite the warning and the rewards of the view was well worth it. We didn't get a guide as the trail was clear but the ropes section was definitely not for the faint hearted!
398,Where sea and mountain merge,Le Morne Brabant is in the south western tip of the of Mauritius and the basaltic mountain has a summit of 556 metres above sea level. The landscape at Le Morne is part of the UN cultural heritage list with its part played in sheltering escaped slaves.There are many caves in the mountain and in the early 19th century was a refuge for escaped slaves from the sugar plantations. There is evidence that slaves stayed in the caves and legend has it that some slaves in desperation of their bleak existence leapt to their deaths from the mountain which might be more of a myth than the actual truth.
399,"No access , Privatize part of the island","Yes, it is not a 'walk in the park'!!  You have to be fit, wear proper shoes and carry plenty of water to drink. The sun can get fierce even if you start at 06H00 in the morning. There are no ropes to help you up! It is extremely steep and if you are not in your 20's or very agile you will have to use ""all 4's"" to get you up... and down. It is very doable otherwise providing you are fit.Yes, there is a gate that is locked (for a reason!) which you have to get through.Book with a guide and enjoy the day! No stress of finding your way up there and no guilty conscience of sneaking up there on your own. By taking a tour you help the local economy!"
400,Splendid,"Went on the south island tour by taxi with another couple cost 70 pound for driver and taxi for whole day went to waterfalls nature reserve coloured sands and saw a lot of the islands scenic views taxi driver then acts as tour guide I think ours was called yali what a nice man went out of his way to make our day special,the giant tortoises are well worth a visit with the crocodiles and other animals in a well run and kept complex your camera will be red hot .the Hindu temple was very spiritual with giant sculptures,breathtaking,best way to get a taste of mauritian life.a very good experience.!!!!!"
401,Top of the world!(ish),"Found only 500 metre from RIU Hotel. Historic place. Recognised as a worid heritage by the UNESCO. After a joyful nigth at RIU Hotel , start the day with a mountain climbing. The peak is at 700 fts high and enjoy the area  as well as the lagoon from the top."
402,Greaet experience!,"Beautiful location and good foods. The personnel is always available, smiled and professional.Lunch and dinner are served at buffet."
403,The hike,"The views from Le Morne Brabant are spectacular.  On very short notice, Allan Ramalingum of Local Spirit arranged for a guided hike for a friend and myself.  Our guide Dario told us the history of the site as well as a lot of anecdotal information about the property owners, plant life and local lore.  Fascinating hike.  I highly recommend Local Spirit:  info@localspirit.mu."
404,what a view!!!,"Start early in the morning for a trek, and try to go with a local guide. Takes around 2-3 hours of hiking, but it's all worth it for the views. Take 1 liter of water per head."
405,Great Hike with Local Spirit Guide,"Must do when visiting Mauritius, though I'd caution doing it by yourself as there is a bit of scramble/free climbing involved and it can get very hot! Do it with a guide (we used explorers mauritius and definitely recommend them) and take plenty of water. Go early! As in start the hike just before sunrise!"
406,Unprofessional,My personal favorite in Mauritius.If u r stressed and want to relax then this is the place where you will found solace and peace.
407,What a VIEW! Stunning!,"Le Morne Brabant is a colossal lump of rock standing prominent above the coastline on the south western corner of this lovely island,  in fact you may spot it as you come into land at the airport...you can actually walk / climb up the thing..."
408,Quite the backdrop,Here I was the only one in the party over 30 and wondered whether this was in my capabilities still - I need not have feared I was in safe hands. There is no doubt you need to be fit for this - the last 1km is pretty steep and a scramble - good footwear is recommended: as is a pair of gloves/mitts for the way down! Henri from Yannature - took good care of us: with a sensible pace and educational nuggets along the way. Water was provided too - though you probably wont want to have much weight with you. At the top there are stunning views - though not much room. Definitely the highlight of my Holiday and well worth it. I would recommend Yannature for their experience and knowledge (you can do it on your own but wont get the most from it..) but would underline - you need to be fit and aware for the duration of this hike and I would say suitable for a minimum age of 16. Time was just over 3 hours end-to-end. 4wd access to teh base of the track and you need to disinfect your shoes in a footbath on entry to the estate (Note this if you are wearing mesh construction trainers! You will get wet feet)
409,What a view ,"Rooms, service beach etc. is perfect. Check out on YouTube. Ask for rooms on the left side S. Regis direction if you look for quite and relaxing pool are. Banana smoothie are great. You should have more variety. Wines start at app. 50 Euro a bottle."
410,Great view,"To be frank, I’m not into hikes & treks. We had hired a tour guide for the trek. I recommend that anyone planning to take this do so - specially beginners like us. We did see some without a guide, but maybe weren’t beginners. It was a tour operator called Vertical World. The tour guide & another guy with him were totally professional & friendly. Water, a cereal bar & helmets etc were provided for the tour. It was 3 of us. Took us around 3-4 hours to get to the top, initial part was okay. After that it was kind of steep, was more of climbing rocks etc, but we didn’t need ropes to do so. Helmets were given as rocks may fall in you from the people climbing above. But when u finally reach till the cross - where mostly everyone climbs too the view is unbelievable!! It’s like out of a postcard, very very serene. People climb beyond the point we did- but that’s more difficult & with ropes, I personally didn’t see anyone doing so. The climb down on the rocky part was a bit difficult but our guide made it very easy. Do wear good hiking shoes - to avoid slipping. Descent on the second part was okay. The hike is totally recommended!! Don’t miss this if you are in Mauritius!!"
411,Amazing View,The last third requires you to physically climb the mountain. If you have never climbed before or are not fit perhaps try something else. However I thought this was wonderful fun and would happily do it again (providing it was dry!).
412,Great unforgettable experience.,"We set off about 8am due to a booking error instead of at 6am. However, the walk to the top was well worth the effort, and it was an effort. It was very hot, and very humid. Take lots of water with you.We did not take a guide (as recommended by our hotel) and as long as you are reasonably fit there is no obvious reason why you would want one. The second half of the mountain is hard work and the last section requires hand and feet climbing, but it is so worth it when you get to the summit.Amazing morning."
413,Best site for Kitesurfing & Windsurfing in Mauritius,"During our stay in Dinarobin, my wife and me happened to dine at Brabant.The food & drinks here were amazing. The courtesy of staff unparalleled.Would definitely recommend to friends."
414,Great Hike!,"Worth the effort  ,I took fairly inexperienced people with me,they loved it.Easy to get to ,first time I cycled there where you can leave your bike though the gate closes at around 4pm."
415,Fantatsic views after a steep and entertaining hike on the Morne Brabant,"quite and comfortable, fantastic crystal clean sea water, nice fishes and good weather almost all the year"
416,The Place To Stay In Mauritius,"My wife and I came for the 11th times in Mauritius on holidays. It somehow became a tradition for us to book our Hotel just in front of Le Morne Mountain area, for example Le Paradis Beachcomber Golf Resort and Spa (we stayed 6 nights this time) or Dinarobin Beachcomber Golf Resort and Spa. Both Hotels are partners and give a beautiful view on Le Morne Brabant mountain. There are also others Hotels like LUX Le Morne or Saint-Régis with same kind of view and location. Do not hesitate to stay in one of those Hotels.I will soon add some of my best photos for you to see what I'm talking about, so enjoy watching them and see you there one day ;-).otterboris (#wherethehellisboris)."
417,On of the things to do in Mauritius!,"I was surprised how commercialized this beauty spot had become since we were here 10 years ago. Not allowed into restaurants because we were not «clients», the casuarinha tree section being the commoner’s area. Guards checking you if you were one of the «chosen». Not my cup of tea. But we enjoyed the beautiful ocean and wonderful ambience anyway......"
418,Great views!,"Magical place, beautiful views all around, perfect beaches, sea water so clear you won't believe it."
419,Worth the Effort!,"We’ve started the hike at 08:30 AM and made it in 3h 10mins (2 hrs going up / 1h 10mins down). The view from the top (which is actually not the summit) is breathtaking. I was running out of breath and liquids, but boy-oh-boy what a reward awaits up there once you make it to the top...Tips & Tricks (lessons learned and observed)1) No guide is needed - it’s waste of money. In a curve of B9 road you’ll see a big road sign pointing the right direction. Access dirt road is some 1,5km (~1 mile) long until you reach a parking lot. You may sign in at the entrance gate and leaving your contact details just in case. Trail is very well marked and path is obvious.2) Like I said earlier, we started the climb at 08:30 AM. I would recommend to do it even earlier, if possible. Temp was already 29*C, stones were warming up fast because of the sun and as you climb the air becomes hot & thin making it almost unbreathable... also, human traffic gets busier towards mid-day, making your climb to take longer time.3) Take a lot of water with you! Hat and sun screen is a must... first part is walking through the forest - not steep and with plenty of shade to take cover from sun. Once you start climbing the steeper second part you are full time exposed to sun (there are few small trees on the way, if any, to get a relief from sun). Take at least (!!!) 1,5-2 litres bottle of water.4) Proper shoes, please!!! The climb is very very very steep. You’ll be on your all fours. Forget city sneakers, cloth Chuck Taylors, Crocs... this is not a place to look good and strike a dim-witted fashionista Instagram pose. Even though it is not Himalaya, don’t underestimate dangerous steep hike going both up and down. Just in case ... get yourself a proper insurance (of course, nobody needs that, right...)"
420,Breath taking,This needs to be done as early in the morning as possible after 7am when it opens as it can get quite hot as there isn't much shade - can be steep in parts and that before you reach the top 1/3rd that has ropes that you use to climb.  If you are brave enough to do that have some good footwear and gloves to prevent rope burn.  I wasn't 😀
421,Beutiful view over Le Morne,"Climb to the top of Le Morne ? Were we mad ? We'd seen the videos on the St Regis resort website and just had to do it. The hotel got us booked up with Allan who knows all the history, flora and fauna of the mountain and lives in the village of Le Morne. A 6:30 start may seem a bit severe but with the heat you need to make an early start. The beginning's not too bad. Half way up it ""becomes challenging"" according to Allan. He wasn't wrong but wow ! What views on the way up and from the cross. Breathtaking. Well worth the hard effort. We visited the memorial at the bottom after walking as Allan tells you the story and puts it into context."
422,"Great hill climb, beautiful views.",I was up there last September - unforgetabel - breathtaking. Finding your limits...I just can recommend it...
423,Enchanting entrancing.,"We heeded the signs at the bottom, and without a guide booked, we only walked as far as the gate.  The walk was easy but steep and the views from the ledge were stunning without risking my life to go to the next level!"
424,Out of this world view,Amazing island one happy place my heart is always in Mauritius and can’t wait to go back I didn’t want to go home. The people are so lovely on the island miss you all.
425,wow,"Early morning start 7am with Allan our guide from Local Spirit.We were a mixed group of 8 and we were treated to local history and plant life talks on the way up the first part of the walk. It was hot and sunny already at this time and lots of shade so this part of the walk was great. I’m a regular walker but not a climber so I did find the next section hard ,no shade there is one section where you are looking for hand and footholds so that was tiring.It is absolutely exhilarating when you reach the top beautiful views. Everyone will have their own experience. I am glad I did it but I needed the help of our guide on the way down the steep part. We were descending after 11 and the rocks are pretty hot by then so scrambling down is hard on your hands. Many people were on their way up then . I’m glad we started early the Mount gets its own cloud forming so there is always a chance you won’t see the view if you start too late."
426,Beautiful Location!,"More than 5 pools, Jacuzi, Spa, unlimited beach view, Unlimited foods from more tham 5 restaurants including french indian asian and many more. More then 5 bars with unimited drinks"
427,"beautifiul hike, not for those who are scared of heights","Hike with guide cost arround 40 Eur per person going 6AM till aprox 10AM. If you are ready for proper hike little difficult in case of falling you can sign a paper that you take all the risk on yourself and they will let you in for free. Not that easy the last 200 m, breathteakin views."
428,"Stunning part of the island, with a very sad history. To be visited!","If you enjoy hiking, don't give this one a miss. Never without a guide, its an early start that will get you nicely out of breath. Bring water and a snack and after s little bit of scrambling in the end be ready for breathtakingly stunning views. Thanks ""Yanature.com"" for the lovely guiding."
429,Worth the effort!,"having visited almost all of the ""windy"" regions of the world searching for wind and waves, Le Morne ticks all the boxes regarding finding a family friendly windy spot... where else can you find a force 5 windy world class wave spot and 100mts around the corner some of best sheltered beaches for your young family ..."
430,Amazing Adventure with Allan,"We went up to the public area only despite dodgy access being available since neither of us fancied crawling up a rock face (you can squint and watch people who do). The slope most of the way up is 35-45 degree incline which is slightly unpleasant on the ankles on the way up. The views are nice but you get stunning views from a ground level anyway. You also only get views at the viewpoints. The  views on the way up is blocked by trees which makes it more of a drudgery. Toilet facility at the base, along with the carpark.You will probably go anyway as there's not much locally to do, it's doable in trainers, better in hiking boots. There's some nice butterflies about and you should bring a good size bottle of water each. We saw a family with two boys about ten make the climb in good time. We also saw a man carrying a toddler on his back feeling considerable strain about half way up so bear that in mind. It takes about two hours to do the section we did. In a UK context, think easy route up Snowdon but in hot weather with no nice stopping points."
431,Hiking with Allan,Don’t miss the drive to the end of the beach past the hotels onto the dirt road to then find the walk up Le Morne - it’s worth it for the views - if you want to go right to the top you need to climb and have a guideThe main beach is great for watching the kite surfers as it always windy
432,amazing hiking with Allan!!,"Le Morne Brabant.... As a kid I used to read the name only in my EVS book. I visited Mauritius and I knew I had to see Le Morne Brabant again. Connecting to the Island through a breath taking view. On a sunny day, even Reunion Island can be seen from there."
433,Hiking up Le Morne with Allan - Wow !,The peak at Le Morne is a UNESCO World Heritage site marking an important Mauritius slavery-related event from the 1800's.  1 hour hike for first 2.5km; another hour for the last 1km.  Leave enough time to get up/down before the park closes at 4 PM.  Fantastic views from both points.  Well worth the time if you like trail hiking.
434,Hiking with Allan,"The Morne peninsula was notorious in the early 19th century as a refuge for runaway slaves and was known as the ‘Maroon Republic’. When slavery was abolished in Mauritius in 1835 the police traveled there to inform the slaves that they had been freed. The slaves did not realise what had happened and tragically leapt to their deaths from the rock. Since then Le Morne has become a symbol of slaves’ fight for freedom, their suffering and their sacrifice – UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site in 2008. This is a beautiful part of the island, well worth a visit for the coastline, and fauna and flora, or even a hike if you are feeling fit!"
435,Professional Hiking Guides,"Everything I tried and tasted was delicious!  There was fresh fish most nights, perfectly cooked.  If mussels are offers, have some!"
436,Le Morne with Yanature Adventures,"We went with Yannature in a small group of people, which turned out to be a good deal as the guide ( Yann himself) was a fun company while being very knowledgeable and provided tips and support to those of us who were not so experienced hikers. His guidance from the bottom to the top was great as he has shown us how to deal with some of the rough spots on the way. The climb can be done on your own without a guide however a certain level of fitness is necessary and you should carry a liter of water with you to stay hydrated. The trail sees quite a big elevation and for myself, the challenge was to get over anxiety of hights. The feeling of overcoming that was absolutely amazing though and the views along the way were truly gorgeous. One of the best experiences of our holidays on the island."
437,Le Morne Mountain with Allan,"Selected as World Heritage by the UNESCO, Le Morne represents the fight of the slaves for freedom. It is in this iconic place, vested with the history of Mauritius that you will have a Private horse ride, along one of the most beautiful mountain trail Mauritius has to offer. In the heart of “Le Morne Brabant” mountain, Mauritius Attractions offers to take you for Private Horseback Ride with professional staffs for both beginners or experienced riders to discover our exceptional Mauritian cultural landscape."
438,Amazing experience,"I am not a trekker and have, maybe, done about 3/4 treks in my entire life but once I read about Le Morne Brabant I just had to do it. This very ‘thought of climbing’ is when the trek began, watching those amazing Lonely Planet videos, reading contradictory reviews (some saying impossibly difficult whereas some saying not difficult at all) and wondering whether I was upto it given I am on a short 4 day holiday. Moot question, should you hire a guide? I believe you most certainly should! I don’t think we could’ve done it without our guide ‘Rafiki’ being there, he was fantastic and made this experience even more memorable. He is a part of YaNature and is reachable on ‭+230 5 746-4568‬. Now, having scaled the Summit, I can safely say it’s truly a ‘once in a lifetime’ experience. It’s neither impossible difficult nor is it a walk in the park , it’s tough and it needs a fair degree of willpower to keep going as it’s easy to turn back once you’ve reached mid way because by then the views of the Lagoon, the opulence of the ocean and the history of the place are all done, what’s left is to see if you have it in you to get the top and stand by the cross. But willpower alone isn’t enough as there are technical aspects of the trek and there are stretches where one needs to be very careful. I wore a pair of Nike sneakers for the trek, which was a bad idea! It’s advisable to have a pair of good quality trekking shoes and get a goodnight’s sleep before heading out. Ideally head out as early as possible (we started out trek at 8:20 AM)It’s a 3.5 hour trek, takes 2 hours to go up and 1.5 hrs to get down and one needs to be equally careful during the climb down, it’s technical too. These technical stretches are the reason why one should hire a guide for the trek.In conclusion, if/when you are in Mauritius you just can’t miss out on this experience. It’s an experience that’ll remain with you for the rest of your life..."
439,Le Morne Mountain with Allan,Just go! Walk around as much of the beach as you can. (There's lots of it) Magic sunsets. Great swimming. Brilliant!
440,Climbing Le Morne Mountain (Le Morne Brabant),"First, a guide is not mandatory nor you are fined. As we arrived by taxi to the parking lot, we were advised by the guard that upper part is closed as safety ropes have been removed.First part of the mountain is easy, a road (up to 2m/6ft wide) taking you to first view points. This level you can do even with children. From here onwards road is only small path to a green gate. There the guard looked us and our footwear. He was talking on the phone, so much other communication. After that path becomes quickly quite demanding more climbing than walking. I would estimate climb angle is ca 6-70 degree on steepest points. View is magnificent from the mountain.Remember to take plenty of water.Remember that climbing up is easier than coming down."
441,They told us Everyone can do it ...,"Imagine a tropical island, swaying palms, coral sands, warm clear seas, huge monolith of a mountain as a backdrop , then you have Le Morne, Brabant. Close your eyes and you are there already!"
442,Hiking Le Morne UNESCO World Heritage Site,"We used Allan (localspirit03@gmail.com), a guide from the local village with a personal tie to the mountain. He took a party of 18 up to the top of Le Morne Brabant for the morning, a nice early start gave us the best views of the day. If you enjoy walking that turns into scrambling that turns into cracking views of the south and West coats of Mauritius then this is the one for you. Allan is a local expert and will get you involved with the local plants and local history. Thanks for a great morning Allan."
443,Amazing Buffet,"Hiking boots (fully covering your ankles), lots of water (take double of whatever you think you need - better safe than sorry), and an early start  (8 at the latest, better 7) are a must. You will thank yourself later if you also bring a bit of food but especially for the heavy duty sunscreen and the hat. We were a small group of fit people between 30 and 40 and didn’t really have a problem with the hike. We didn’t take a guide and started south of Le Morne at the parking lot indicated on Google Maps as „Le Morne Trail Entrance“. We signed in at the gate (no charge) and went our way. Yes, it’s steep and you better be sure footed but it’s not like you’re hiking a ridge where any misstep means sure death. And yes, there is one section where you climb on all fours, and later slide down on your butt. Other than that it’s just very demanding since it’s hot, steep and without any shade. Have fun, it’s worth it and the views and photo opportunities are extraordinary. BUT if in doubt, get a guide. All of them are helpful, friendly and you’ll get a few stories on top."
444,Best thing we did in Mauritius,"Whenyou enter in this piece of land, you expect to turn arround and see the sea all arround. In fact, after few miles, you have a golf closing all view, after a succession of hotels . At the end, even no road any more as you are almost in the gate of last hotel inn...so just the option to go back to Le morne. Shame that authorities sold their land to big groups...you may make a stop at the commemorial to morrin slaves ( right side before golf while you are back, just down the hill). Small and pity commemorial place. Better to do nothing or to do it seriously, the memory of the slaves could not be honored with such pitiful place."
445,Challenging but worth it!,"We had scheduled a hike with Allen a week in advance and called him the night before to confirm, but the morning of at 6:45 we were told he had to cancel due to weather. Of course weather is unpredictable, however providing his customers with a heads up that the hike had been cancelled would have been nice. I would not recommend Allen if you are looking for a professional and customer centric guide."
446,Historical mountain,"If you are staying in one of the hotels at the le Morne resort on the island, I would recommend the walk up to the first level of view points (before the warning experienced climbers sign). View are amazing and can see the whole of the coast line. We set out to arrive at the entrance at 0700 when it opened. Staff were late on site to open the gate but we followed the people through the gap and started. Better to wait until it actually opens so you can sign your name in the book for safety. Take plenty of water."
447,Beautiful but sad,"Montagne Le Morne Brabant is small mountain of about 555m. It is located in the south east coast of Mauritius. It is a historical place and was proclaimed as National and World Heritage by UNESCO in 2008. It is easily to reach to the foot of the mountain by any transportation and parking lot available. It is a great place for hiking and the path is well traced. So no need to hire guide to reach the top of the mountain. The way to reach the top is of paved rocks and dirt. Enjoy the greenery scene while climbing and can pluck seasonal fruits like ""gogave de Chine"" or berries. You'll meet up with lots of glue berry trees (cordial dichotoma) and cactus. It would be better if you wear a good trekking shoes as to reach the top of the mountain is a bit tricky otherwise up to half way its OK for anyone and some kids also. I've seen a tourist carrying her baby near the top of the mountain and that was courageous. Don't forget to carry a bottle of water which is very important. More you reach to the top of the mountain more the views are breathtaking at 360 °. If you're lucky you can find some ""Pailles en queue"" birds. When climbing down the mountain, beware on rainy days the paths are slippery. You can enjoy lunch and refresh in the kiosk near the foot of the mountain or opt for Le Morne beach which are not far. Toilets are available near the kiosk. Have a great hike ⛰️😊"
448,Great for windsurfers and their families...,"We arrived on a sunny day in March around 1 pm. We had originally planned to start the day here but flipped our itinerary so we could see the tea factory while it was open. There is a 1.5km road to get to the trail head and as long as it is not wet or muddy it is slowly navigable by car. Otherwise, you'll have to walk it in. Once to the trail head, there are toilets and a simple map to let you know the route. We were able to get to the South point in 42 minutes and the Southwest Viewpoint in 50 minutes - stopping along the way for pics, looking at flowers, butterflies and snails. From the beginning to the South point, the trail is mostly shaded but it was still quite hot. It's easily navigable and we didn't find the slope to be too difficult. We could see the approaching rain in the distance so we turned around and headed back down after seeing the two view points. Also, once the sun disappeared behind the clouds, the beautiful colors of the sea were muted and our pictures and views were not as spectacular. Even only seeing the two view points, it was worth it and I would recommend. We were up and back down in less than two hours, with pictures and stops all along the way."
449,Mauritius Apartments Le Morne,"Drive to base on Southside -thru the picnic area on dirt road, then along beach edge. Parking at entrance. 3.6km to top. First 2.5km is straight forward -used by 4 wheel drives. Climbs quickly. The last 1000-750m is challenging, several ropes to help pull yourself up. Jagged granite rocks for hand/foot hold. Wear right shoes - I had joggers, but thongs, leather sole, loose fitting not appropriate. There are steep drop offs with no barriers (no good if you afraid of heights). Limited passing on top section, so avoid weekends. No need guide. Free entry & parking. Take water. Stop regularly. Allow 3.5-4 hours. Challenging but absolutely worth it!"
450,Le Morne Unesco World Heritage Site,"There is a reason why you are not allowed to wear flip-flops. It is a mixture of a hiking and climbing tour. If you know this than it is fine but we were more expecting a simple hiking tour. On top, Yan was rather rushing through. On the homepage it says that it last 3-4 hours but he made clear at the beginning of the tour that it would last 3 hours and gave the slowest people little to no time to relax. Even though it was according to him a small group there were moments when the people at the end of the group were left alone and not in sight to any group member in front - and this on a rainy day and therefore muddy way which was slightly dangerous. The positive things about the tour is that the views are magnificent. It is on a private property so that you have no chance to walk there on your own. Yan also gave a few explanations about the surroundings and some plants like the pepper plant which was very informative."
451,Terrific Hiking Mountain Offering Flawless Views,"Henri & Nicholas were amazing. So friendly and patient with us. They always looked out for us and were so well prepared. They had first aid kit ready and water stocked up in case we were thirsty. They were really gentlemanly too to help me carry my bag hehe. Also, they are really passionate about sharing about Mauritius and their passion for hiking, trail running, etc so it's great to learn from them a thing or 2! It was my first time hiking and we had to climb up lots of rocks to get to the top. Rather challenging but totally worth it!!! View is amazing!!!! Thank you guys!!! 😄👍🏻 will edit a video of the hike soon on Instagram: @reelhearts / Reel Hearts Productions on FB ;)"
452,Mountain,"Brilliant is the word! If you want to know more than what I already wrote in my review, feel free to email me. I will be happy to help you! Cheers, Eddie"
453,Beautiful mountain with a dramatic history,"That was one of the most dangerous experiences in my life. First of all,be ready physically - the way is not easy for people without any special training. I didn’t know about all the difficulties so thanks god I was well trained before in my youth)The first part of the way is the easiest one: you just go through the forest using the ready road climbing upstairs step by step. We had about 2 or 3 stops for having rest.The second part is harder: you walk trough small trees and plants by a very thin road and don’t forget you are still climbing up. You need some water with you otherwise it’s better to stop here and turn back.And my favorite third part of the way was a magnificent check of my ability to survive) we were climbing in a monkey way on the stone rock which is somewhere about 90 degrees. By the way we met one praying place and it was just in time regardless of I have no religion))The view from the top was amazing but all my thoughts were busy with a question how to go back from there so I couldn’t enjoy the view completely... The way back was even harder because it’s really not easy to climb as a monkey turning back... Thanks god everybody is alive. I was ready to kiss the ground when we were back))So please note that this way is really dangerous and scary without any kind of training before. Even with this training it can be scary,I think so. Better not to put yourself on the risk."
454,A must visit,"My son and I went with Allan (localspirit03@gmail.com), who is a local guide and who lives and breathes the mountain.  He took a party of us up to the cross on Le Morne Brabant which is at approx 515m - the highest point being 565m (I think).  We started at 07:00 and enjoyed the early part of the trek which rises the first 250m and with the benefit of Allan's knowledge learned about the local plants and local history. The second half is really a climb - which is worth doing but I can honestly say I found scary at times - having no real head for heights and there not being a safety net in sight.  .  The views are spectacular - when I wasn't hanging on for grim death, and I had a real sense of achievement when I reached the top.  The way down is the way you came up - but it was far easier than I had imagined.  Allan being part mountain-goat makes it look so easy but he is very safety concious and is always there to lend a hand, guide or just reassure.  Thanks Allan for a great experience."
455,Mountain top that shielded slaves,"Guys - I am going to give you a worst case scenario review for those of you who want to get to the summit of Le Morne Brabant. I scoured the internet for as much info as I could before taking the hike. I have scrambled the three horns at Torres del Paine in Chile and various mountain hikes across SE Asia so I felt my muscle memory would be experienced enough to take this 556 meter high beast. Let me tell you, on 3 hours sleep and very recently losing my father, I perhaps bit off more than I could chew, but I DID IT!!! And live to tell the tale!Before taking this on, I did read that in inclement weather, you should not attempt to do the hike. We did get caught in a (short) rainstorm on the way back down and though this made the descent slippery and somewhat perilous, we did manage it, though muddy. Only you can judge if you would take it in the rain as our guide did encourage some people making the ascent to continue but did warn them to take it easy and be careful. For the record, i would not have done this hike without a guide although I have done others without one. We found our guide via one of the resorts and as we have Mauritian family, we were able to pay slightly less than our European counterparts - again, you will have to judge what you are happy to pay but given that I found this hike quite difficult, our guide was worth his weight in gold and I tipped him way more generously than I have tipped anyone for a service before. I believe he may have been part of the recommended guide group who I think are the only ones allowed to take guided tours up there. They are knowledgeable and go up and down the mountain on a daily basis - trust them, they know what they are doing. It is possible to go without a guide but if you are unsure, as I was, for the love of God, just pay up!We arrived at the foot of the mountain at 6.15am. You have to take a road that goes behind the Hotel Riu and keep following along the beach, or if you come in from the south, take the road signposted after Le Morne village and keep going (This road WILL be flooded if you come in after heavy rain). If you are staying at one of the hotels there then you'll get picked up. At 6.45am we started walking. The guides will provide water and stop and show you the wildlife and nature - very interesting. It's an uphill walk, not too taxing and saw several older people doing this with walking sticks when we were on our way down. If you can help not taking a backpack then don't because I found mine was hindering me, but I carried 2 litres of water which I felt I needed. Just so you know, an Italian woman did this climb in a pair of Converse Daintys, a skirt AND a handbag!! And she got to the summit before me! So again, just reiterating to judge and listen to your own level of fitness before attempting this hike. So the halfway point was reached after an hour, perhaps an hour and a half? You'll be rewarded with some great views. I'd have allowed my Mum to take this walk. The next bit I would never allow her. So.. after the halfway point you need your wits about you. You have to walk alongside a green gate and by walk I mean clamber, grab a hold onto and move carefully. There's a bit of a steep drop if you dont stay close to the fence and you also have to navigate razor wire. I didn't pay too much attention to what the fence was doing there or what was behind it. I was too busy making sure I didn't fall down the slope. This bit, in my opinion, was probably the worst bit to go through in the rain. This is also the bit where I have heard people turn back. Get beyond that and you will find yourself at the mercy of a real monkey scramble and this part is where if you don't turn back, you should find the rest OK. 60 metres of vertical rock. If I didn't have my guide I would have cried. Grabbing hold tightly I put one foot up then another, moving up the wall like flipping spiderman. I didnt look down or behind me. Just kept going listening to my guide's voice. I didn't find this a pleasant challenge. I hated it. The rest of this climb to the summit is a lot of scrambling across rocks and grabbing onto trees to support you. We reached the summit at 9.15am just as the heat started to rise. I cried my heart out up there. I thought about my Dad and thought about the slaves who had jumped to their deaths (there is a monument down by the car park) and was so grateful when the guide pulled out a bar of chocolate for me as I had been feeling light-headed. We sat up there for half hour and I'm sorry to hear that because of my state I didn't enjoy the surroundings as much as I could have. The descent was far easier but still needs full attention. The rain made things a bit less easy but as before mentioned, my guide made it all possible. You are challenging nature. There are perils. This is only my personal account and I have climbed other mountains in a totally different frame of mind and have both enjoyed and felt great when I reached the tops. Everyone else in my group really enjoyed the hike and though there were people who said they were going to turn back and whose legs turned to jelly, they still made it. My other half said he thought it was easy but I think he's just showing off. We reached the bottom just shy of midday and I'd like to say that anyone can do it but in all honesty I believe this will only be completed safely and with enjoyment if you are in the right frame of mind and of a good level of fitness. Good luck!"
456,Magnificent rock,"Located in the southwest tip of Mauritius, it was here that runaway slaves (called maroons ) established settlements on the summit throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries. This mountain has been a symbol of the former slaves' fight for freedom. UNESCO World Heritage Sites declared this protected mountain to be part of their international landmarks in 2006.Don't attempt to hike this majestic site on your own as it is very challenging. Explorers Mauritius (a local hiking and walking tour company endorsed by the Mauritius Tourism Authority) can safely take you up to the summit to see the spectacular scenery."
457,Mauritius 2012,"All I can say is do it! Get your stuff together very early in the Mauritian morning, and you'll be taken away by a professional group of people (Nicolas & Henri were my guides) to discover an incredible mountain full of surprises. Plants, flowers and birds sometimes never seen anywhere else shall be discovered (& explained) on the way up. Techically feasible, this 3 to 4 hour walk will surely make your muscles ache a bit, but just enough to enjoy later on, a fresh beer on the beach, watching the Morne and saying to yourself: ""I was up there!!!"". If you add to this, the affordable rates they grant, I'd say that Yanaventure made my day!!!!"
