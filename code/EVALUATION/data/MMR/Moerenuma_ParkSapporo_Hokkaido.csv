0,A lot to experience,"Visited with familyPros:1) This park can be reached via train and bus. Ensure to read and understand the directions carefully because it can be confusing.2) Best to visit with a full stomach and bring some drinks and snacks. My family and I visited right before lunch, luckily there was a small cafe inside the park which was quite a walk from the main entrance.3) There is a bike rental a few meters from the entrance. Suggest to rent one. The park is huge and easier to cycle than walk.4) There were many attractions to visit but my favorite is the pyramid-shaped museum and cycling around the park.5) Allot 1 whole day or at least half day to visit. It closes around 5pm so best to start early.6) It is definitely child-friendly.7) Best toilet to use is at the pyramid-shaped museum.8) Wear something comfortable since this is an outdoor place.The only con I can think of is the insects that appeared around 5pm on the way to the bus station. It was similar to the insects we experienced at the Shiroi Koibito Park.A must-visit."
1,Beautiful Landscape during Winter,"For 200yen you can hire a bike for two hours to ride around the park, which is highly recommended as it's such a huge park to cover by foot. Weather permitting, it's quite a relaxing half day in a very calm setting."
2,Very niceh art and leasure park near Sapporo,Rent a bicycle (minimum 200 yen for 2 hours) and round the park. It has a few cool spots and makes for a good evening activity.
3,Lovely pyramid and park,Beautiful park with a good view of the landscape and surrounding when you climbed up the Mt Moere and one could slide down the slope of Mt Moere with a skateboard.  There is bicycle rental should you wish to cycle round the park.   Very pleasant park especially for families with children.
4,worth the time to visit,"The spacious park includes art installents, hilld, many walking and cycling trails and and much more. Cycling is the best option. It offers great views of the city if you climb to the top of the hills."
5,Amazing views,"This is a very nice park to spend a leisurely morning/afternoon, and maybe outdoor picnic.  Recommend to drive as it's not accessible by train or subway."
6,a park designed like a museum,Rent a bicycle near entrance of park. 200 yen for 2 hours. It is better to see the park vs walking. Climb the 222 steps up Mt Moere to catch the breeze at the top & a panoramic view of the park. Interesting feature on the architect of the park Izamu Noguchi.
7,Beautiful!!!,"The place is so huge! Moerenuma Park is good for athletic people and nature lovers ♥ You can bring your pet and have a walk or you can visit there by yourself and enjoy the nature while jogging or exercise! I went there with my dad and climbed to the top of the mountain. The view is great and the breeze is fresh and good! You can see the Sapporo City 360-degree! This place is great for skiing during winter! From my experience, staying long at the top in spring season is not a good idea when you are just wearing light clothes. Even if the weather is good, the wind is strong and it gets cold after staying long. But except when it is summer season. There is a place there that full of cherry blossoms and good for resting."
8,We had a good time,"Enjoy cycling, strolling，relax with good scenes for taking photo. You can also bring your own food and sit on grasses to enjoy picnic there."
9,The best park in Hokkaido,The park is easily accessible but bus that is sharp on time.There different structures in the park and activities you can do around.Great place to spend 2 or 3 hours away from the city.
10,An eyesore becomes an tranquil haven,Impressive park. Nothing else like it. Go there. The sculpture is incredible. Take lunch with as cafe is limited if you don't want a sit down meal.
11,The most beautiful park I’ve ever been to,"This is a combination playground, park and art park, with great open spaces and makes a good place for a picnic"
12,Went here for sightseeing!,If you have kids you must go here! hire a sled or skis from the glass house and spend hours running up and down the hill!
13,One of a kind park,"Moerenuma Park is an incredible mixed use public park that is suitable for all ages and interests.  Mixing sculpture, architecture, public art, and diverse sensory experiences, it is a place that demands repeat visits in various seasons to enjoy the changing scenery.  From the artificial beach to the children's playgrounds, to Play Mountain and the Glass Pyramid, each region is unique yet seemingly integrated as a whole under Noguchi's artistic vision.  The location is a bit off the main Sapporo downtown requiring subway and then a 30 minute bus ride, but well worth the visit."
14,Beyond fantastic!,"Free to enter.  We rented bikes at very reasonable rate (200 yen for 2 hours) at the entrance and helped to move around, which saved our energy for walking up to various higher grounds for most charming views around.  We enjoyed the 15 minutes fountain show.  Check the schedule at the bike store."
15,Okay for a bike ride or a walk up the hill,They have bike rentals for 200 yen and I learned how to bike here while admiring the architectural structures around the park! Great place for families to spend an afternoon in the park and to get a great view of Sapporo from the hills here.
16,Magnifecent!,"The park is big, so renting a bicycle was a good option to enjoy this well maintained and lovely park.  Cherry blossoms were beautiful.   2 hours of bike rental only cost 200 Yen.  It is highly recommended."
17,Spacious park for cycling and running around for kids,"This park is okay for a bike ride or view from the top of the hill. The best part is the fountain, which sprays in various patterns."
18,Birch Forest was the Highlight,"This park is really huge and quite far away from city centre, you should  rent or bike or have a car or you can go there by public transport but it took about an hour by subway Sakaemachi station blue line and then transfer to bus. There is no entrance fee as well. The view from the top of the pyramid and from the top of the hill is very beautiful."
19,Worthed,"This is a really excellent space for kids, with several playgrounds (on the east side of the park), huge lawns broken up by wooded areas, a couple of big hills to climb and good views of the Sapporo area.  On the other hand I wasn't blown away by the sculpture and it's quite far out of town, so not ideal unless you have a car.  The bike rental place at the South entrance closes at 17:00, but the last rental is at 16:00 - we arrived at 16:10 so had to do the whole thing on foot, I think bike would have been more fun."
20,Heavy snow,"If you like art, it is great place to visit. This park was originally designed by Mr.Isamu Noguchi, who was a famous Japanese-American artist. The main building, glass pyramid, and large designed constructions can be found there. These are really warm and peaceful. The space is really large and open sky, thus it is really comfortable when the weather is good in sunny days.  The place is a little bit far from the center city. The public transportation is only a bus service from center city and not convenient. It is best to use a rental car. The park is beside a park ""Sapporo Sato-land"". This park is also very comfortable. If you have children, one of best place to visit."
21,Fun half day of bike riding,"This was a great park for walking and relaxing. It is a wonderful People watching park that is well used by the local Sapporans. It is also close the shopping and restaurants. It also has music venues and at the time of our visit it had a flower festival going on with many presentations sponsored by companies, it was an amazing display of Floral Artistry."
22,Unexpectedly nice,"Something for everyone! There are jungle gyms, mountains to climb, scultures to admire. If you are looking for a fun full morning or afternoon or both - moerenuma park is a lovely way to spend the day. There are multiple outdoor activities such as jungle gyms, scultures, forested areas to explore, mountains to climb. But there is also a glass pyramid with indoor exhibitions and a small cafe for food. There is even a gift shop. The only hard part is getting here if you do not have a car - it requres the subway, bus, and walking to get to the park. But it is worth it!"
23,Moerenumakoen ,It's very easy to navigate this park.  The theme of this park evolve around pyramids. There is glass pyramid here and other pyramid hills.  You can go in the glass pyramid but it's close on the first Monday of every month for maintenance.  Bicycle rental can be found at the first parking lot right as you enter the park and it cost 200 yen for 2 hours per bicycle. 300yen for special bicycle that has a toddler seat in the back.  Takes around 30 minutes to make a full loop around the park at a brisk pace.  The loop trail is shaded in some area and on certain part of the park you'll be riding along a river that has a lot of ducks near a bridge.  Great park if you want to enjoy some family fun.  I went on a weekday afternoon and only a few people there.
24,Great place to learn to bike,"Renting a bike was only 200 yen per person and I think made the scroll through the park much easier and enjoyable. The bikes had a self lock in each one, so it was very easy to leave the bike whenever we wanted to walk around. Great park!"
25,wheelchair-accessible park,"This is a huge public park and we wanted to visit the different attractions like the fountain, the hill and the Glass Pyramid.We underestimated our time.  We came to the park around 4pm and by the time we walked up to the top of the hill, it was sunset already.  The walk up was around 20 minutes.  It was dark and everything was closed by the time we came down.The view was amazing at the top as you can see the skyline of downtown Sapporo with the snow mountains in the background.  It was a bit chilly too due to the icy winds."
26,Something for everyone! Fun afternoon out in the sun!,The park is nice and filled with local people spending sunny days.  We visited the park during the special decoration from gardeners around the city.
27,Large Park,"Although most activities closed during winter but the view are wonderful, not much ppl there and we actually conquered the ""hill"" by walking up... a place must go when you at there"
28,"A lovely spot, but hard to get to","We visited during winter since we want to experience how is it like to play in snow.  This place did not disappoint us.  Since it was a holiday when we visited, there are only a few people there so we are able to explore and take nice photos.  Downside is that the park is closed on holidays and we were not able to rent sleds and play in that big hill in the middle.  But we enjoyed looking at the kids who did.Some tips though, taxis can be too expensive to go there on your own.  We noted that there were no public transportation in sight so we asked the taxi to wait for us.  The best option maybe is to go on a tour buses - you can go to the JR Station and inquire from there.Wish I could say more, but we have limited experience in this place."
29,Will return for summer time ,"The park is huge and lovely! It is special in its archtectural designs.  You would need a bike to go around and enjoy the fabulous park.  It is a great place for family day, or even travellers' get-away.  It is worth going!"
30,Great park designed by Isamu Noguchi ,This is a fun place to explore and interesting to experience being in a sculpture as well as enjoying the open spaces.  There is a rental bike shop near the entrance and I recommend getting one for an hour or two. The rate is ¥200/hour.  The place is so large it would be hard to see it all on foot.
31,The highlight of my trip to Sapporo,"A fantastic place to relax and enjoy the time. The park is pretty big. can enjoy the surrounding view around the areas and good for outdoor party and activities. The place is bet far from Sapporo downtown and public transportation is also not frequently available. However, worth visiting it. If you are lazy to walk, you can hire a bicycle and it is 200 yen per 2 hours time. The renting place is near to the park entrance. Best would be spring and summer I guess. Was there in the spring and saw many people enjoy the time and relaxing...."
32,Very quiet and enjoyable snow walk! ,"Moerenuma Park is a beautiful open park with a hill, fountain and glass pyramid structure that act as an office and art space. A large landscape full of art and nature. We came here during the winter, so everything is covered in snow, we really enjoy taking a walk there and checking out all the facilities, I am sure this park looks very differently in each season. A beautiful place that's worth visiting."
33,Nice for a walk or bike jog,"We rented the inexpensive bikes at the park (200 yen for 2 hours) and took a self-guide tour through the park. Though we are average-sized, the bikes were too small. The birch forest to the west of the main entrance were breath-taking, the highlight of our visit"
34,Glad we stopped here,"Large open spaces/ lawns for kids to fly kites or play ball, green hills to climb and roll down, pyramids to climb, trees to picnic under - ideal for family fun but is it worth the 50 to 60 min journey from JR Sapporo station for the tourist? If you wish to see how brilliantly a waste dump site has been turned into a park then definitely visit, for me it wasn't worth the time or journey through suburban Sapporo. The fountain was supposed to turn on between 10.30 and 10.45, it didn't and looked as if it hadn't worked all spring. The trees are still young but I can imagine in another 10years they will provide beauty and shade."
35,Park with interesting structures,"Getting to the park from downtown took almost an hour. Read couple of reviews on TA describing the various modes of transport to/from the park. What I came to realise is that Bus 6 plies only on weekends and weekdays from 19 July to 17 Aug...so it wasn't an option for us. We took the conventional route describe in the park's brochure...on the Tono Line, drop off at “Kanjo dori higashi” station. Head for the exit that says ""Bus Terminal"". Upon exit up the stairs, turn right and about 30-40m from there on the right is the bus terminal. Take Chuo Bus 69/79 to the Park's East entrance. Entrance on the bus on from the back down and grab a ticket. Exit from the front and pay there. If in doubt, check with the bus driver, they are really professional and helpful. We rented our bicycles at the entrance-this is a great option to cover the entire place. They have all types of bikes of people of all ages. They also come with locks so that you can make a stop, climb the hills, enjoy the various attractions without worry that your bike will be rode away. We spent about 2-3 hours at the park...a little short and longer would have been better. However, with bicycles, we managed to make our way throughout the park from a clockwise route. Tennis Centre to the breath-taking views from Mt. Moere; Tetra Mound; Play Mountain; Beach; Playground, Fountain and the Glass Pyramid. When in Sapporo next, we will certainly make our way back to this magnificent park."
36,Excellent place for a get-away,"Getting to this park is easy, u can either choose to take subway  Toho Line “Kanjo dori higashi” Chuo Bus [higashi 69] to “Ainosato kyoikudai eki” or Chuo Bus [higashi 79] to “Nakanuma Shogakko dori” get off at “Moerenuma koen higashiguchi (east entrance)”, follow the exit 2 sign to go to Bus terminal then turn left and u can see the bus waiting area. For return bus nearby the park waiting area, there are only 3 bus routes which Chuo Bus (Higashi 6 to Bus Centre Mae), Higashi 68 to Sapporo Factory and it stop by Kanjo dori Higashi subway station or Higashi 28 to Asabu. This place is really awesome if you love to enjoy nature."
37,200yen for two hours of bicycle fun,"We visited in May 2017.  Nice cool weather.  We biked around, had picnic, climbed a hill.  This is a nice outdoor place to bond with family, without gadgets!"
38,Rolling hills + art,The park can be reached by riding a train from Sapporo Station and a bus. Travel time is less than an hour. The park is filled with man made features like Mount Moere a 62 meters tall and offers great views of the park and the surrounding area and a Louvre like pyramid building made of glass called Hidamari which is a gallery space.
39,Not sure what the fuss is: A well-landscaped trash heap.,Very scenic beauty & really great sight. Immaculate .The viewing gallery is really an attraction & also the glass pyramid .We did not have time to explore the mountain but it was a pleasant sight !! well maintained .The toilets are immaculate too
40,A must visit park in Sapporo,"We rented bikes to cycling around the park to save time and really enjoyed it.  Beautiful landscape. Could not believe that this place used to be garbage dump site. The fountain show is nice and not to be missed.I lost my glasses somewhere in the park, and got it back from information centre.  There was really someone who cares!"
41,Suggest renting a bike,"This park is quite different from normal parks where it is next to marshes (numa in jp). It has several architectural facilities such as the glass pyramid, tetra mound, music shell etc, a huge park with lots of grass, water fountains, small hills etc. Bicycles can be rented at the entrance. There were many small and colourful camps on grass where families/friends were relaxing in the park."
42,World Class Landscape&Architecture Design,I went with my husband who is a wheelchair user.  We went early June.  Buses 69 and 79 from Kanjodori Higashi station go there.  Both buses are wheelchair-friendly. Just tell or show the Japanese name of the place to the driver. The park is spacious.  It is also wheelchair-friendly.  There are a lot of things to do here.  There is also a playground.  We would be able to venture more in the park if the wheelchair is an electrical one.  The restaurant was not in business anymore during our visit so it will be good to bring your own food so that you will be able to stay longer in this marvellous park.
43,Really cool place for adults and kids,Pretty great park to take a walk. Lots of locals bring their pets and kid there to enjoy the quiet and nature.Wanna visit a park close to the city with a forest inside? Just go there and you won't regret.
44,Worth the effort.,"Landscape park, the territory is pretty big, so it's a lot of walking or you can rent a bike on site. If you want to see it all - be ready to climb a lot of stairs."
45,"Fun bike ride there and back, and great park too.","Park is located in approx 20-30 mins bus (No. 69 or 79) from Kanjodori Higashi Station (Toho Subway line) which is a little remote from Sapporo Station.Get off Moerenuma Koen Higashiguchi stop (it means Moerenuma Park east exit) and walk 10-15 mins to the park entrance.It was after heavy snow so, I could see beautiful snow scenery and less people. Also, very enjoyable to walk snow track in the park. There was small free exhibition of Isamu  Noguchi in glass pyramid (looks like Louvre Museum in Paris!!) who was Japanese-American, was designed the park just before he passed away. Since he designed the park for kids, there are some areas where kids can play all seasons.There's snow mountain near the park entrance where kids can practice ski (for very beginner) and sled for all day (sled rental is also available inside of the pyramid)."
46,Incredible scenery,"Was very excited to explore the park as it has such amazing reviews and is so well-designed. Because it was winter, was not expecting the bicycle renting experience, but was at least hoping to see a beautiful winter landscape. However, we went on a MONDAY, which is when the park is closed, including the bicycle rental service and glass pyramid centre, which was already a big disappointment in itself. The bigger disappointment is that the park is not maintained in winter so the entire landscape was covered in at least 40cm of snow. Travelling 100m into the park already felt like a chore that wasn't worth the effort. DO NOT go in winter and if you do, plan very very well. Best to ask locals or service staff for suggestions if possible. The park was not designed for winter, which is a poor testament to the designer."
47,Beautiful park ,We dedicated our only day in Sapporo to this Park.  Great place to pedal with winds in your hair admiring 'manicured lawn' and artistically arranged trees. Best part : all for free (apart from the hired bikes).Recommended only if garden park/scenery is your cup of tea. Not an artistic person myself but the park is visually appealing with satisfying serenity.
48,Nice to see local people spend summer time,"The park is located almost at the outskirts of Sapporo. A very long bus ride is the only way to get there (try to search online on what bus number) and since the bus stop announcements are only in Japanese, try to ask the bus driver for directions (have someone write the park name in Japanese) and they would gladly help. The park itself is breath taking (also literally since it is huge and walking around would take your breath away), unusual, and obviously made an artist. A very good advice would be to rent a bicycle (just beside one of the gates) so that you can explore the whole park. Though the park would take half a day of your time, our family did not regret it. If time is bit of squeeze, I wouldn't recommend going there though."
49,Freedom,"We enjoyed this park immensely!  It is so huge you will need at least 3-4 hours to walk it!  This park was designed byIsamu Noguchi.  We have  enjoyed his artwork in Kansas City & Washignton, DC. but this park surpasses everything  we have seen before......His designs at this park are HUGE !  We were blown away by the massive artwork !Beautiful & beyond words!  A must see if you are in Sapporo, Japan.  Suggest you rent a bike at the park....Park is on the outskirts of Sapporo City."
50,An Isamu Noguchi Pilgrimage,Visited the park after reading reviews on the site & I wasn't disappointed. Took bus 68 (for some reason tourist map doesn't mention this) from subway for about 35 minutes & it was a fairly easy journey. I hired a bike for 200 yen for 2 hours. Great value. Beach was shut on Thursdays but that didn't detract from my visit. All areas were good but the fountain & glass pyramid were great. Highly recommend!
51,Definitely worth a visit,"Wonderful, unique park dedicated to a talented artist. Went with my wife, sister, and mother who all enjoyed the experience for the landscape design and overall visit. We’ve been to the Noguchi studio museum in Long Island City, NY and love his aesthetic and work. This is even more and different given the dimension of space. But even for those unfamiliar with him, the park can be enjoyed for the natural surroundings, views from high places (hilltops and the top of the glass pyramid), and the Sea Fountain. For the Sea Fountain, don’t expect a Bellagio water show. It’s an hour display where the water changes but in intended ways that require you to “see”. His work wants you to appreciate nature and examine the beauty often unseen or taken for granted. We spent a couple of hours there and could easily have spent more time. Walking is required to cover to grounds but it’s more about enjoying and taking in what you see. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to spend a pleasant worthwhile afternoon. No fees or charges."
52,Loved the Park so much,"This spot is far from the center of Sapporo city, it takes 50-minutes by the train and local bus. From the nearest bus stop 'Toyohata' it's a 15-minute walk to the center of the park. In this park, there are white birch trees, artificial hills and a pyramid of glass. You can rent a bike for 300 yen per 2 hours to cycle around this big site. The bicycle station is nearby a car parking lot. When I visited this park, it was a sunny day and I could enjoy walking in the great fresh air. Most of the visitors were families with kids. Some of them were playing with a kite. It looked enjoyable."
53,"Great for families, so so for tourists","It is nice to see a huge piece of land dedicated to art and for family to have a good time especially for city folks who hardly see an acre of greens. We cycled there from Sapporo city. It took us quite a while because of the rain and getting the right directions. It was a 9 km ride from Sapporo Beer museum but it was worth the effort. You can take public transport to get there but we highly recommend renting a bicycle at the park as it is just too big to walk around. Again, Japan has created world's unique site."
54,Great place to spend the day,The building and the surrounding area are both very unique.  I will visit it again.  There are lots of outdoor activities but you may need a sunny and warm day to enjoy it to the fullest.  Arts activities and musical performance inside the main building as well.  I spent 4 hrs there.
55,Great Place To Cycle,"A lovely modern  park designed by a famous half British, half Japanese designer. Has huge outdoor spaces with soft lawn that kids seem to love to roll on, plus a wading pool for kids to jump around in, while the parents sprawl out on the surrounding grass watching over them. There is so much space, kids can play football and run around happily without having to disturb other people. It's completely man made, but beautifully done, with plenty of green all around. It's about a 30 min drive from the JR station in a taxi which adds up to about JPY3600 per way.  They have a souvenir shop, a tiny museum including some info about the designer and a restaurant that one needs to book a table at, at least one day in advance (both lunch and dinner are served there). Otherwise there is also a small fast food place selling soft cream cones and other snack items (need to buy a ticket from a vending machine and then bring the ticket to the counter to retrieve your items). The wonderful thing is that you can rent bicycles there, including ones with baskets in front (between the handle bars) for infants or other bikes with toddler seats.  It costs JPY300 for 2 hours.Many families brought little tents with them (can be bought in toys r us) or blankets and had picnics on the lawn, while keeping cool.It's a lovely place to get away from the city for the day."
56,Afternoon trip to Moerenuma Park,"We visited during the snow festival and got there by bus. Acres of snow, the Glass Pyramid was huge, skiing looked good as well, lots of families with children, couples, oldies, the lot. Nice."
57,A dumpster turned into a nice park,"Wonderful winter park. Very reasonable rates for Equipment rental, and no admission or parking fees."
58,Very Artistic Park Worth a Visit,"We went here by city bus and got lots of help from fellow passengers to find it.  it is one of our most prominent memories of sapporo, and indeed of japan in general.do NOT miss the fountain show, preferably the one that occurs after dark."
59,Cycling fun in the park,"To go there, just follow the instructions on their website . The bus stop returning to the subway is across the street from where you get off. Do check the timetable before you enter the park, as you may spend hours in there. You can rent a bike, though we walk. If you hate the sun, don't come here. There is almost no shelter except when you are in the main building, the pyramid. If you don't like to walk, don't come here. In particular, climbing the 2 hills are lot of fun. You can buy simple food from the small cafeteria. But why don't you bring along some food and picnic on their seas of grass? We lunched at their French restaurant. 3 choices of set menu, the cheapest around US$90 each. Excellent french food, a 1/2 star Michelen standard. No reservation needed as we were there on a weekday. Otherwise, do reserve a table. It's worth the money."
60,Hiking and Biking,"We absolutely loved this park. It is about a one hour ride from the city and I have to state up front that I don't think it is for everybody. It's a massive park with truly gigantic 'sculptures' designed by the famous Japanese-American artists. We were somewhat familiar with his work/ideas which helped... However since his work is very abstract and aesthetically pleasing anybody can enjoy without knowing anything about his art or art in general. It's a place to wander around in, to simply let it take you and to ride the crazy thought waves that informed it. At the same time it feels like a crazily failed experiment, to build this park far away from the main city, and for it not really offer the typical park-experience, you know, benches to sit on, a picnic space, these things. It's reminded me of some of the Japanese modern classics most notably Kobo Abe. We visited this park in May 2014 and although it was quite sunny with some clouds the wind was strong and it was definitely chilly. It added to the atmosphere; the wind-swepped ruggedness of the place... Curious to see what looks like covered ins now."
61,Poor experience due to overwhelming snow,After reading many great reviews about the park I decided to check out the park with my girlfriend while we are in.sapporo... We managed to take public transport which alight us in front of the park. It's indeed a lovely park and we hike up the triangle pyramid and took many nice pictures. After which we rent a bicycle and ride around the park. We also brought our own food and wine to picnic in the park... There is nothing fantastic about the water performance you can give it a miss ... Gosh i am missing the place again now!! Will definitely go back to the park again next time.
62,lovely to walk and view the glass pyramidal structure,"We had some free time in the afternooon and were eager to visit this park designed by a well known sculptor in Japan. Eventhough early April is not a very ideal time to enjoy the space(the grounds are quite saturated with melting snow), we were not disappointed! The whole park is a sculpture itself with many lovely areas to enjoy the open air. It was practically empty when we were there,no doubt, because of the time of year. Still, we were inspired and enjoyed a couple hours wakling around and visiting the glass pyramid, which has a charming French restaurant and cafe. We splurged on our way there and took a taxi, which was about 4,200 Yen from the city center. On the way back, we took Bus # 6, which took us back to the bus center just near the communications tower at Odori Park. Much much cheaper! This is a perfect place, weather permitting, to pack a picnic lunch and a good book and head out to explore and enjoy.  Some people might get all the way out there and feel there is not much really going on....I think that is the very reason to go! Food options are limited."
63,Sakura Miss,"After I came back from my trip to Moerenuma Park, I shared with the hotel front desk abut my experience & she laughed. It seems that Sapporo citizens know about Moerenuma's desolate & forlorn winter, not the tourists. Here's why: - (1) Strong wind picking up & lifting snow off the ground & into your face so you could not open your eyes, especially if you are walking in a direction that is opposite to the wind, (2) Deep snow that reached almost all the way to your knees. This is terrible if you are not wearing winter boots that reach all the way to your knees. (3) It was almost deserted when I went; the only people I saw were those inside the Glass Pyramid & those playing snow sleigh on the hill in front of the Glass Pyramid. The rest of the park was deserted, well almost. The further you walk away from the Glass Pyramid, the deeper the snow got. So you find your feet suddenly sinking deeply into the snow. I think this is because hardly anyone walks around in winter, so the snow just accummulated & accummlated. Now can you imagine what will happen if you got stuck in the deep snow? Nobody is going to come to your rescue. I only went to 3 attractions, out of the many there - Glass Pyramid, Moerenuma Mountain & Tetra Mound. I did not manage to go near Tetra Mound because the snow was too deep. What a pity.If you need to use the toilet, use it all you want inside the Glass Pyramid because once you are outside, there is no freaking toilet in the freezing cold. Oh, all the eateries are closed (!) during winter. So you gotta bring your own food. And bring plenty because one tends to burn more calories during winter. Otherwise, the only food will be the hot potato potage from the vending machine."
64,Pictures don't do it justice,"Such a chill place, with beautiful scenic views. Had lots of fun cycling around!! The tranquility I’ve experienced is one that I can never forget."
65,A park not to be missed in Sapporo,"Moerenuma Park is one of many sculpture's parks and gardens to be seen in Japan, and is one of the best. If you are in Hokkaido don""t miss it"
66,Stunned snow view,"Our plan was to cycle around the park but we reached there too late. The bicycle kiosk closes at 5pm with the last rental accepted at 4pm. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful time walking around the park, climbing the hills and enjoying the sun while it sets."
67,Artsy?,"Its a park. Its a sculpture. Its interactive art.  We rented bikes from Sapporo JR station for 500 yen for the day, and cycled along the Toyohira River to get to Moerenuma Park.  Its not that far (maybe 15 km) but the ride took an hour and a half as the view was gorgeous and we kept stopping for photos and to play in the parks along the way.  The weather was a sunny 15 degrees.The park was simply magnificent.  Its huge, and comprises of different sections each with its own flavour and fun for kids and adults.  We climbed Mt Moere and it was incredibly windy up there, but worth the trek for the amazing view of the area.  Because we also wanted to go to Satoland, we didn't explore the entire park, but did go to the viewing gallery and to the small Noguchi exhibit on the 2nd floor.  I'd really like to come back one day to spend the entire day here!"
68,Well worth a visit,"How could you not come Sapporo and not visiting this piece of art! We love to walk around the park and we didn't mind the distance to come here. If we didn't have time constraints, we could've enjoyed the whole park slowly! But nevertheless we really love the time spent here, it was quiet and peaceful, away from all the touristy places. I will definitely come back again when i'm in Hokkaido! :D"
69,Very confusing,"This by far is one of my favorite places in Sapporo. It's a train, bus & a lot of walking away outside Sapporo but you're patience will be rewarded. Beautiful park!"
70,A great park for snow activities,"A very modern park outside the city, with an interesting design. It is a good choice for a sunny day."
71,Don't miss this site!,"Took some effort to climb the hill, the scene on the hill is definitely worth for a climb. A good place for the nature lover, family, and for those who love to walk in nature. Enjoy the fountain breeze in this city park."
72,Noguchi mecca,"Good place to enjoy the outdoors and run around with the kids. Great views of the surrounding area, city,and mountains."
73,"Winter fun includes snow shoeing, cross country skiiing, sledding for kids on nice small hill","Travelers can easily go to this park via Chuo Bus No.69 or 79 from Kanjodori Higashi Station and return by No.68 from the park's east entrance. In summer, all family members or lovers can enjoy this park since there are several parts which fit for everyone; hills, lawn, mini forest, fountain, pool for kids and more. You can also rent a bicycle at the east entrance to explore the park. It costs 300-400 Yen/hour depending on type of bicycle. You can find a souvenir shop and a cool café at the glass pyramid. I may personally recommend this park for architects, landscape architects, designers and related ones. Really impressive!!"
74,Bring your sled and have fun!,"The design of the park by Isamu Noguchi is intriguing. We loved viewing and going into the glass pyramidal structure to view, as well as walking among the few still blossoming cherry trees. Other areas, especially the huge grass hills looked interesting but we were on foot and didn't go there."
75,A great place to play with snow!,"I thought the design/architecture sounded interesting enough to warrant the roughly one hour of subway and bus travel to warrant going, but we ended up staying longer and had a great time. This is the opposite of an electronic arcade; you make your own fun. The hills, glass pyramid and fountains are a feast for the eyes and as KanoSouthCarolina says, the people watching is fun. You can stretch your legs on a rental bike $2 for 2 hours (free park admission) and it's fun to make a circuit or two on the 4 km perimeter bike path. Don't miss the sea fountain... I don't want to post a spoiler but I've never seen a fountain do what it does. It starts at 15 after the hour during summer months and lasts 40 minutes. Stay past the big initial geyser. Food choices were really limited; bring snacks. The whole park is sculpture and very cool.The Tohu subway line from Sapporo station has English signs and it's just 3 stops out. The bus pulls up right outside and -again - it has a sign in English as well as an English announcement. You won't get lost."
76,Great place to relax in city.,This is the best park ever in sapporo !!!   the view there is just magnificent and spacious!  the architectures and arts are just9 great. Would love to return there the next time and stay a longer period!
77,winter frolic,"Oct 13At first glance I told our driver ""Seki"" to skip this park, but we needed a toilet stop.  Upon further inspection this park is so futuristic and avant garde.  The Glass Pyramid by the artist Noguchi is the centerpiece.  It is part of a granite structure that could double as a bomb or earthquake shelter.I was very surprised that there were so few visitors."
78,It is great place to visit.,"The place is nice, can ski very heavy snow.Like the environment, not far just need sit they city bus to reach.Many people come here for ski."
79,Moerenuma Koen,"This well-manicured park was built on a trash dumpsite, so it seems to get points for concept. But as far as a  place to visit, it's sterile and hard to get to. Plusses are the fountain and wading pool in summer and cherry blossoms in spring. But honestly, I’m not sure why you’d come here when Sapporo has so many other more natural parks, not to mention points of real natural splendour, like Hokeikyo Dam. The high ratings from other reviewers puzzle me."
80,Unforgettable,"One of the nicest park I've been to! Don't expect flowers like furano though, everything is mostly a wide expanse of green. You can rent a bike and cycle there, but they are quite strict on closing time (last rental before 4? I think). Have a picnic there, climb to the top of the hill etc. I think it's definitely worth a go. Everything there is so aesthetically pleasing to the eye."
81,One of the most interesting places in Sapporo ,"A very unique park. Modern, broad and fantastic. Relieving and eye-opening, literally. Will definitely visit again."
82,Spacious park,"Take your own food if you go; we arrived at 1.15 and the only restaurant was full. The only other food place was the coffee shop which had sold everything except some paper bags of cold soggy fries. So nothing to eat and no lunch. The park is a re claimed waste disposal site. It's bleak, windy and unattractive. If you're a tourist in Sapporo, a much better option is the Mount Moiwa Ropeway."
83,Spacious Hokkaido,"It's a beautiful park, but it is difficult to get to, and in my opinion, it isn't worth the effort for a tourist, particularly if you have limited time available. If you have a lot of time, for sure, take the time to enjoy it and check it all out. There are a lot of other things to do around Sapporo though that are far better."
84,Wide-open & beautiful :),"I rented a bike and rode here along the bike trail on the river from downtown Sapporo. The ride, and the park were both nice. I can't say there was anything spectacularly interesting about the park, though. There were a few steep hills that you could climb, which provided nice views of the park and Sapporo. I'd say it's a very great place to take a family for a picnic or day of relaxation. Not so great for a traveller looking for great scenery or exciting climbs. But if you feel like biking, it's not a bad destination, maybe 10km out of town."
85,遠離煩囂半日悠閒遊,"I went during spring/summer. It was raining, however, I enjoyed the whole thing there. Being person who a little artsy, this is a worth place to visit. Perhaps, it could be less crowded all time, this is a little unusual as compared to the Open Museum at Hakone. The landscape is basically structured to deliver different screenshot in all 4 seasons. You snow most of the time and greens in Sapporo. But this one, entirely about the mood that you going to perceive depends on the current weather. I felt like I am in a different zone. I couldn't rremember how i get there, my review may not be helpful, but perhaps I give you a little idea that this place is worth a visit, if you are someone, who appreciate the effort that put in a work as a designer/ artist."
86,Beautiful park..nice for picnic ,Touted as one of the landmark sakura viewing places in North Japan and certainly in Sapporo we were shocked to find utter desolation due to unseasonal rains when sakura should have been at their peak on 6th May ..It was a great disappointment having gone to North japan to view Sakura  but alas ..it wasn't to be .The parkl is big though and requires  a couple of hours if flowers in bloom .
87,Amazing park that will take you back to nature,"Went during the snow . We had to travel a long distance from the hotel, When we enetered there was no clear directions in the Zoo. No helpers and no one inside showing the directions etc."
88,Great For Families,"This designed park is a bit of a way out of the city centre but it is well worth the visit.I went in July 2017 in the early evening and witnessed the sunset on the large mounds.There are a few landscaped hills, skate areas, sports courts, a baseball ground, tree planting areas, sculptures, a fountain and a glass pavilion. Walking or cycling is a nice way to spend the evening, and the views from the top of the hills are amazing with the city and mountains in the backdrop. The illuminated water fountain show was good - I would recommend the 15min one not the 45 min one (which is too long and there is not enough variation).A must see attraction while in Sapporo!"
89,Interesting park,I went to the park in a Saturday and even it was in weekend it wasn't very crowded. If you rent a bike it will be easier to travel inside of the park. The price of one hour rent is 100 yen. You can also take your tent and have a little camp for the day. There is also a little lake in this park that you can take off your shoes and get inside but it is very shallow that the level of water doesn't pass your knee. Don't forget to climb to the mountain and see the beautiful view of Sapporo city. And also there is a very big fountain which makes a show every hour. You should also see the glass pyramid. It was a very interesting building. Finally if you love to play tennis you can rent some tennis rackets and balls and spend your time by playing tennis.
90,Large and interesting,"Lots to do, i enjoyed the Bicycle art display on the side of the mountain. It was worth the drive to go here."
91,"Best attraction in Sapporo, far better than Odori Park.","This park was a hidden gem in Sapporo. It was not on the top among the most popular tourist sites as it took some time to go there. However it was actually not too difficult or time consuming. I highly recommended people who could spare a day or half a day to go there. It was a very beautiful park with water fountains, playgrounds, a glass pyramid, a nice restaurant and many many add ons.....Rented a bike there at an unbelievable low rate and you could tour the park at your own pace and saw everything."
92,Nice Park for Young and Old,"The highlight of my trip to Sapporo. What a thoughtfully built park which engages all your senses!This is not to be missed even thought it is not easy to get to and not very clear to get instructions on either. I would recommend a taxi but given that Taxis are super expensive, I still used the map given to me by the tourist information centre which marked the subway line and bus to take. The bus did not have English names displayed for the stops which leaves you to navigate by maps - also tricky this since Google maps does not fully cover the smaller bus stops in Hokkaido area. I did get off at the wrong stop, but still managed to make it to this place on a rather rainy cold day. But worth it! The cherry blossom forest was in full bloom which was beautiful. There are play hills to go up and come down from, play areas with equipment. The glass pyramid is gorgeous from inside and up top to take in the 360 degree view of the park. I saw the sunset as well here which was fabulous. The hills over a very beautiful vantage point to see the sunset from and enjoy the city around you. The entry is free Wear good sturdy shoes You can rent a bike at the park entrance (though there are multiple entrances) Finding your way back won't be easy, try to get a taxi back Spend half a day here Facilities available are water, toiletes, a small cafe and a restaurant"
93,Great looking park! It's a hidden gem,"The first impression of the park from the internet was a cool looking park designed by Isamu Noguchi. Once I enter the park, I was delighted to find out that you can rent a bike to ride in the park. This park was huge with a few architectures to see. But for me, as I was travelling with my 2 kids, action is more important than sightseeing. In Moerenuma Park, there are 2 slopes for them to climb and roll on. We all had so much fun!It would be nice if I had prepared some snacks and drinks, as there is no snack shop around."
94,Family vidit,Easy to access and generally a nice and quiet park only a couple of minutes away from down town Sapporo.
95,Stunning.,Went there on Monday and so would like to remind you all that rental of snow sport equipment is close on that day. Luckily someone left their plastic sled therefore my kids able to slide down the snow sliding track. We went there by bus from a subway station. Cannot remember the station name just Google for Moerenuma Park how to get there from Sapporo. Entrance is free and you need to walk like 10-15 minutes from the bus stop to get to the playground
96,Relaxing....,Having visited this park many years ago (even before it officially opened) I was delighted to return. A great place to bike/run/walk. Rolling hills that you can take at your own pace.
97,Beautiful park in NE Sapporo with nice architecture,"Moerenuma Park is not close from the central Sapporo area. However, It is still accessible by public transportation. The purpose of our visiting the park was sledding so we bought sleds (plastic one) at home center called ""Homac"". It costed about 700 yen each. The glass pyramid building in the park was closed (due to the new year holiday) so we couldn't look inside the building. However, bathroom inside the building was usable. Therefore, we were able to put our snow gears on easily. Many families and a few young adults groups were there. We had so much fun like kids. We walked up to top of the mountain (Personally I think it is more accurate to say a hill). The view from top was quite beautiful. The top part of hill was steep, so It might be not comfortable for some people and little kids. We saw many people started sledding from the middle of hill. The best thing about this park is everyone is laughing/smiling with fun. I recommend this park to someone who simply would like to enjoy snow. Also, for someone who wants to be a kid again :) * A week later, we visited the park in the night. The night view from the mountain was quite stunning!"
98,Beautiful park for cycling,"Spent some time just shooting pictures and wandering around with family. Always reminds me of how spacious and free Hokkaido is compared to other parts of the country. A beautiful fountain show on summer evenings, and some neat art galleries too. Plenty of parking and it works well for a picnic too."
99,Open expanse,"Looking at pictures beforehand, it looks like just a nice park, maybe worth an hour on a lazy afternoon. But in person it's just beautiful. The scale is hard to grasp through pictures alone, and I wish we'd spent a little more time there. It definitely makes sense that they rent bicycles. The park is very family-friendly, with lots of artsy playgrounds scattered around the park. There are lots of open grounds where people play sports and eat lunch. The cherry blossoms were great, too, and not nearly as busy as other parks.Make sure you wear some comfy shoes!"
100,Rent a bike if you can,"This is the interesting park with beautiful landscape. You can take subway Toho Line to Kanjo dori higashi station then take the bus from Terminal 1, bus no. 69 to ""Moerenuma Koen Higashiguchi"" it's around 25 minutes ride from the station. I like the landscape at this park  which you can see the park view from Mt.Moere. They also have bike rental service."
101,Great place for everyone! ♥,"the location is far, although its an impressive complex, its not very interesting. There isn't much to do or see although its fun if you have extra time"
102,Best Park ever in sapporo! ,"I love this park so much, probably the most interesting & fun park I've ever seen. There's a pyramid and a hill to climb, a dome like small hill in front of the pyramid, a glass house to see and small water ponds for children to play with, a nice route for jogging & cycling, huge grass lawn during the summer, soothing wind and a nice view of the surrounding countryside when u reach the top of the pyramid & the hill"
103,Ski spot during winter,"Got here in the evening, so only managed to visit the pyramid, and walk around a little. The pyramid is beautiful, with lovely views from the top. The park is also lovely, with lots of sculptures, if only I had more time."
104,Moere Park_Open park with architecture influences designed by Isamu Noguchi,"This park is famous as great sculptures park designed by Isamu Noguchi. I love this park since when I was child. It has beautiful mountains, sculptures and playgrounds For children. Unbelievably the entrance fee is nothing. Just free!A little bit far away from Sapporo station but you can go there by bus under ¥500. The park is big but no worries because it has rental bikes;-)I totally recommend the park!"
105,So inspiring!,"It was a heavy snow storm when we were there. Our visit is to take picture , unfortunately it was very heavy snow rain , we waited for 2 hours inside the pyramide building , it was warm and very nice building .After waiting and took some picture around the building we decided to get back to station by taxi. Thanks for the staff who helped us to make a call for taxi , otherwise we had to walk under snow storm to get out the park at least 30 minutes and no idea how long had to wait for taxi or bus passed by .This is a remote area , we had to pass some warehouse or maybe industrial area . Anyway we are glad with the experience eventhough could not take a lot pic . Need to return if we are in Sapporo next time"
106,Beautiful park,"My fiance and I went here for sightseeing. We wanted to see snow on this area, however, most of the snow has melted because we visited in the closing month for winter season. Nevertheless, the views are great and fresh air awaits. We had alovely time while walking around."
107,Its breathtaking!,"The place is bigger than I expected, and so green! The Isamu Noguchi Glass Pyramid is a must see. Can trail up to grass hills/slopes, nice small hikes. Lovely in summer!"
108,LOVED IT!,"This is a sculpture park designed by the  American born artist of world renown; Isamu Noguchi. there are kids play areas, and fountain shows long and short (30 min and 15 min), there are also 30 tennis courts and a sports field.  Built upon a landfill dump in a swamp, this is now a beautiful location for a few hours relaxation, and art appreciation. I highly recommend it. man made hills are fun for skiing/sliding in the winter."
109,Not a must,"We rented a bike for ¥200/2hours and it worthed every pennies of it. The landscape, clean air, relaxing atmosphere we could just escape from all the routine in our life momentarily. The restaurant inside the pyramid was a perfect setting. Close to Sapporo Sato Land Farm ParkTo get there, please take Toho line toKanjyo Dori Higashi stAnd continue with bus 69 or 79 (¥210) 20 stops"
110,Noguchi Masterpiece,"The Moerenuma Park is located  north east of Sapporo not so convenient to reach. From the Sapporo station you can take the bus number 59 to the last station. From there it si a 10minutes walk.The Park offers a great combination of sculptures, which are actually more buildings than sculptures, and possibilities for picknick and playground for children. Founded and designed by Isamu Noguchi on the ground of a former waste treatment plant in 1988, there are about 10 major structures, which are perfectly designed in harmony with the landscape: mountains, rivers, fountains and the landmark glass pyramid. There are many lawns and water places which are ideal to sit on or play in on hot summer days for the whole family.From the play mountain and the amphitheatre you will have a very nice view of the distant Sapporo skyline. To go around you might rent a bike for 300Y per person which is a very convenient way of seeing all exhibits.Despite the fact that it takes some time to reach this place, I recommend this as a very nice and inspiring trip."
111,Plenty of space to run around,Must see if you like Isamo Noguchi's work. Good idea to check the schedule of the Sea Fountain before you go to the park.
112,Amazing outdoor art musuem,"My fiancée and I came here as one of the location for our pre-wedding photography. This park is amazingly large with many cherry blossom and it's also a great place to ride bicycle. Peaceful environment, fresh air and beautify view especially from the top of the hill."
113,Rent a bike and explore!,"We visited this park at the last minute, and are so glad to have included it on our visit before leaving Sapporo for Lake Toya. We skipped Otaru to spend more time here. Since we visited in November, we enjoyed the snowless park, the fall colors as the leaves were changing, and the cold anticipation of changing climes. The bike rental was already closed for the season, and I can see how this would be a very enjoyable way to get around the park. Plan to spend about 3 to 4 hours here, depending on the time of the year and how much you want to see/do."
114,Great place with few people,"This stunning park is a little bit out of the way, but well worth visiting. More of an art installation rather than averge park.On my trip it was a cloudy day, which actually made the visit quite pleasant as it was cool enough to comfortably traverse the park several times. The bike rentals were too cheap an opportunity to pass up, though be aware that if you're taller than your average Japanese person, you might struggle to find a bike that fits."
115,Great place,"We went there to escape from the hustle of city life in Sapporo.Rented a bicycle for 200 yen and spend about 2 hours exploring the glass pyramid and others except the fountain as its was closed.A well spent morning ride in the park with reasonable access by subway ,bus and 1 km walk to the park."
116,Enjoy Japanese sculpture parks,"Moerenuma Park is everything I expected and more. I am a Isamu Noguchi devotee. I have visited the museum in Queens, NYC, the sculpture garden in Mure on Shikoku, his dry garden in Santa Ana California. I own one of his modern classic coffee tables and  a 6'  Akari lamp and several books about his life and work..Moerenuma Park is his final master piece and well worth a visit."
117,Excellent during the snow,"We obtained a 1-day subway and bus pass for Sapporo and headed straight to Moerenuma Park.  The park is gorgeous and not to be missed!  Some of the playgrounds and sculptures were designed by Isamu Noguchi.  Fantastic views at the top of ""Play Mountain"" and ""Mt. Moere"".  We rented bikes within the park and had the most gorgeous summer ride.  It was safe for my 8-year-old daughter since the park is closed to vehicles.  Playgrounds for children are dotted throughout the park and my daughter had a field day!  We wish we could have stayed longer."
118,"Great open and expansive park, nothing like anything in Japan","With all the excellent, rich food that we've been having, we decided to include physical activity in today's venture. This took the form of renting Porocle bikes then heading out to Moerenuma, a pleasant 11km ride through eastern Sapporo, an area that is a mix of light industry, residential and cottage farming (lots of onions!).As we drew near the Park, the hill grew larger before us and on a sunny day like we had, sunscreen is a good idea! We arrived, parked our bikes near the tennis centre (it looked like there were some high school tryouts) and climbed to the top of the small hill. This provided us with a fantastic overall view of the big park and some of the outskirts of Sapporo too.We wandered over to the glass pyramid which was one of the venues of the Sapporo Arts Festival, and what the building hosted was very interesting indeed!After spending most of he morning there, we headed back to the city but not before encountering two actual Mario Karts (one driver was dressed up as Mario and the other as Peach)! Fun!"
119,Nice place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Sapporo City,"I had thought that Tokino Suzuran Park was wide and big; so is Moerenuma. The similarity ends here though. A few, huge sculptures and two (man made?) hills filled the big expanse of green spaces of Moerenuma Park. From a certain point within the park, the view looks like a copy of MS Windows wall paper, or did Microsoft copied this? The designer did an excellent job making this park likeable as well as useable. The sculptures blends in well with the rolling grassy plains broken up by several patches of wooded areas and the two hills. The creative idea of mass planting different species (e.g. evergreen or decidous) in different patches of wooded areas subtly breaks the monotony of the green surrounding. Lovely place to spend a couple of hours easily!"
120,"unattractive, bleak and windswept","I’ve visited Moerenuma Park on a cold autumn evening in October 2017.In Hokkaido, the sun sets early so it’s a good idea to visit early. However, when I visited in the evening past 5pm, parking was free in the huge parking area at the entrance of the park.We visited the Glass Pyramid and the access to the observatory was available. There wasn’t much visitors, on my count, probably less than 10. The Glass Pyramid gives a good night view of the surrounding areas though not as fabulous as that of Mt Hakodate. The Glass Pyramid is a impressive structure in itself and I was completely awe-struck by the architectural brilliance.Worth a visit if you’re around the vicinity!"
121,Green space to escape from the city,This park took my breath away. It was quiet when I visited the park and it was so calming to walk around. Viewpoints from some sculptures were breathtaking. I would go back here in a heartbeat!
122,Fantastic Time Spent Here...Lovely Park,"What a great park with awesome views and architecture. All for free on top of that. It wasn't hard to find as the GPS took us around the small streets in residential neighborhoods and all of sudden, there is this huge park. This used to be a dump site and now it is a beautiful park. Urban planners from large cities around the world should take note on what can be done to beautify a city.  We hiked around the park for 2 - 3 hours, climbed to the top of the tallest hill and checked out the inside of the glass pyramid building (very cool looking inside and you can to to the top via elevator for a nice panoramic view). We got there a little late so missed out on the bike rental. We would highly recommend this place and also suggest that you get there earlier so you can rent a bike. It is much easier to see all the points of the park on a bike as opposed to walking."
123,Emptiest Sightseeing Location Ever,"We decided to visit Moerenuma park during our stay in Sapporo. We took subway to Kanjodori Higashi station and then bus #69 ( you can also take #79) to Moerenuma park higashiguchi.We rented bicycles for ¥200 for 2 hours. Bicycles are must items in this park since it is enormous.My 11 year old as well as 16 year old climbed up the mountain(hill or mound?) and came down several times. There were also playground areas. They were not the ordinary playground but very stylish, clever and fun ones.What a wonderful park! My kids enjoyed this park a lot. The only regret we had was we could only spend a few hours there. I would say you should bring lunch and spend 4 or 5 hours."
124,Worth the effort to visit and take time to breathe,"Have been thinking to visit this Park for a long time. Finally I decided to make a visit one Sunday afternoon. I was impressed by the Glass  Pyraimd. While you were inside, the clear and blue sky was on top of you and I like the view.This park is big and planted lot of Cherry Trees , it attracted lot of visitors in May for Cherry Blossom. I enjoyed the greenery and climbed other two Grass Pryamids too.There is a public bus stop located at the car park area, this bus travel from Sapporo Beer Garden and passed by the Subway Toho Line-Kanjo Dori Higashi Station. I went back by taking this bus to this subway station. Alternatively, there are Chuo Bus Higashi 69 or 79 travel from bus terminal next to Kanjo Dori Higashi Station to this park. The bus stop to get off is Moerenuma Koen Higasiguchi, take about 8-10 minutes walk to the Park entrance."
125,Very big and beatiful park,"This is a park reborn from former wasteland and designed by the famous American architect/sculptor Isamu Noguchi . The park itself has many interesting large scale sculpture like installations, Noguchi also created sculpture like landscapes throughout the park. Great place to visit with children with vast outdoor spaces and interesting buildings and installations."
126,Big park big surprise,"If your vacation is mainly in the city, it's good to get out here in the open and away from the traffic. The big hill in the middle is good for views and sledding- and we saw a guy climb to the top and ski down. The last 100 meters is actually fairly steep (though not dangerous, I'd say) so you can get some good speed on the harder, windblown snow before you plunge into the softer stuff halfway down. Snack bar is closed in winter. Your choices are a fancy restaurant or vending machines with hot drinks, soup, and energy bars. The subway doesn't come out here so you'll have to drive or take the bus (details in another post), which is easy but you could hit traffic on the way back and it's slow going, so bring a book and ignore the yapping after-school teens."
127,Interesting Sculpture parc outside Sapporo,"With meticulously-maintained lawns, neatly-kept clusters of trees (like small groves or woods) and beautiful tree-lined paths, I would say with no exaggeration at all that this is one of the best parks I have been to in my life.  And yes, there's also the big glass pyramid to go inside for a break (with seats but not sure about availability of food; and I'll just have to say the biggest let-down there was that it wasn't air-conditioned, so it was pretty hot inside that big glass pyramid), Mt. Moere with a fairly great 360-degree view from above (can see downtown Sapporo to the southwest from up there) which only takes about five minutes or so from the bottom with stairs on two sides, the big water fountain inside a circle of trees or a circular-shaped forest, the smaller Play Mountain (no stairs to go up though), and some big sculptures like a big circular tub & an open-sided pyramid (just a short distance north of Mt. Moere).  But above all, I was just mostly impressed by the wide-open ground that was ""so clean & perfectly maintained"".The subway from Odori Station in downtown to Kanjo Dori Higashi Station in the north on Toho Line takes only about ten minutes, but with getting upstairs & waiting for the bus (just outside the subway station on one of its sides) and the bus ride itself (which takes about half an hour to the south entrance of the Park), it will take you about an hour in total from downtown to get to the Park.  But yes, while in Sapporo, it's ""absolutely"" worth it to come to this park despite its out-of-the-way location."
128,Surprisingly fun,"Amazing place. A bit of the way, but totally worth the time and effort. Designed by the American artist and landscape architect Isamu Noguchi is an impressive park full of landscape sculptures and being a sculpture on itself. It is possible to spend a whole day there,  walking, playing and cycling  (there's a bicycle rent in the park ). In one of the sculptures, Glass Pyramid, are galleries and very informative exhibition about Noguchi. Absolutely recommended."
129,Lovely Park,"We had to catch a train and bus to get out here, but it was worth the effort. Such a massive park, with some terrific sculptures and art works. So many people relaxing in the spring sun, on the grass and under the cherry blossom trees.  Great place to just wander around, and relax."
130,Flower Festival during visit,"Went here during winter. I've seen the pictures and I didn't get the opportunity to really get the feel of the park. But it does turn into a ski spot during winter. You can rent ski gear at the glass pyramid for a fee. It's close on Mondays though so you have to time your visit because it would suck to go all the way to the park just to see snow. Nonetheless, I had fun at the park. Ski'd a bit and admired the glass pyramid in the middle of the snow. I guess it's more beautiful during spring and autumn."
131,Gorgeous bike ride around an amazing park!,"The installation art is more or less interesting, but it's the art that you are able to play on that makes it cool. Aside from being a nice park to relax at, the cluster of playgrounds is fun for kids.The view from the top of the mountain is especially nice at sunset."
132,What a mini snowstorm,"I wasn't expecting much visiting this place but boy was I in for a treat. I visited in the middle of winter so the entire park was a winter wonderland!It was so good that I visited twice. The first visit was on a weekend so there were quite a number of locals around. The sun was out, it was a lovely day. We spent it just walking around in the snow and up and down the hills. We decided to visit again and this time on a weekday. It was so quiet and peaceful. We lay down in the snow and watched snow flakes fall, built snowmen and made snow angels in the snow. Really it was the highlight of my trip.Make sure you have waterproof shoes (and preferably clothing if you or your kids want to play in the snow). They offer snow boot rental for very cheap if you're not keen on buying at the glass pyramid. Truly worth a visit. Pack snacks or lunch since there aren't many food options there. It's not difficult getting here by bus (bus no 69 or 79 from Kanjodori Higashi) but it is quite a walk from the bus station to the park. Not so advisable for parents with young children, especially in winter."
133,Fun & interesting park with creative landscapes,"This was one of the best things I did while in Sapporo! It's a little out of the way, but so worth it, and one bus will take you there. I went on a beautiful, sunny day and rented a bicycle ~ loved biking around the park and the fountain was mesmerising. If you love architecture and nature, this is a must!"
134,Must see,"Moerenuma Park was designed by Isamu Noguchi in the late 80's but wasn't opened until 2005, long after his death. The entire park is considered a sculpture but there are several 'attractions' within the park itself. The most prominent is Mt Moere, a man made mountain rising 62m, there's a smaller hill famous for its white path contrasting with the deep green of the surrounding grass which leads to the 30m high summit. The symbol of the park is the glass pyramid. There are large expanses of grass which are popular spots for locals to sit down and enjoy the sunshine. You can spend the best part of an afternoon here but it is a bit difficult to get to by bus, you may need to ask someone for help but generally you should take the subway to Kanjō-Dōri-Higashi Station and then the 69 or 79 bus to the park. There's a return bus which will take you to the Sapporo Beer Museum if you want to combine the two attractions."
135,An attractive park northeast of Sapporo,"The park was designed by Japanese American artist Isamu Noguchi.  Art installations abound, including manmade hills, streams, sculptures, and landscaping.  Unlike in other countries, picnicing is encouraged both in and outdoors.  The park is child and cycling friendly.  It is a nice diversion for a few hours."
136,Lucky Japanese. You have such a beautiful park,"Whatever season you visit Sapporo, be sure to check out Moerenuma Koen. It's absolutely gorgeous in the summer and is a fantastic bike ride. It has a cool musuem and the park has so much to offer for all ages. The fountain show is great."
137,Great huge outdoor area for families with children of all ages!,"I visited this park last week. There was still quite a bit of snow on the ground. I was only able to go inside the pyramid to look out but the restaurant, bike rentals and observation point were all closed (this was early afternoon). The bike rentals are closed during the winter months. I was able to walk around a little but with the snow and paths that weren’t cleared, there wasn’t much I could do. I know this place is beautiful during the warmer months, so I’ll have to go back to check it out!"
