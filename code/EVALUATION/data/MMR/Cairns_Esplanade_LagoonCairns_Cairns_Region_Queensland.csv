0,No swimming for us ‚òπÔ∏è,"We couldn't have a swim as we had our dog with us and dogs aren't allowed at the lagoon. Travelers with dogs might be best to avoid Cairns as it is not very dog friendly. Dogs are also not allowed on the Esplanade, the botanic gardens or any part of the CBD of Cairns. We are grey nomads living permanently on the road so leaving our dog at home is not an option. Also most of the swimming spots and waterfalls are in national parks so obviously can't go there with your dog"
1,A gentle stroll along the boardwalk,"We just randomly walked into the lagoon and wasn‚Äôt prepared to swim but the kids were to excited and jumped into the pool with their underwear! It was lots of fun, not crowded and safe to play. The man-made beach was relaxing and beautiful. Had a great time before we headed to lunch nearby, convenient spot!"
2,Excellent,"We had been advised not to swim in the waters of Trinity Beach by a few locals and so we decided to visit The Lagoon at the Esplanade on two different occasions instead.  The Lagoon is a really nice place to visit while in Australia because it is a great place for kids to play, there are lots of shops and restaurants, it is family friendly, and FREE.  During the weekend you can even listen to some live entertainment.  My son enjoyed swimming, building sandcastles but more importantly he was happy to meet four nice friends while on holiday.  The kids played for at least two hours building sandcastles and just having fun.  The Lagoon is a wonderful place to visit for both kids and adults alike and should definitely be included on your list of activities specifically if you have children.  Remember to wear sunscreen, bring swimming goggles, and a beach towel.  Lockers are readily available and restrooms with changing facilities are near the Lagoon."
3,Great place for family visit ,"You can't go swimming in the sea in Cairns due to the crocodiles, so this is great place for families to go and cool down whilst having fun."
4,Relaxing,The lagoon is a huge pool with some water features and is free and open to the public. We didn‚Äôt actually swim but its right downtown with a view of the sea. The lagoon sits in a park setting so this would be a great place to spend a family day.
5,Swimming spot,We were there almost every day because for the ocean was some jellyfish alert. It is super clean and great. In near you can find a lot of BBQ facilities for free. Maybe they could add some more lockers for rent. Good job done by local community.
6,Enjoyable,We swam in the lagoon on the full moon just magical and free! You can use the lockers nearby... the water is filtered so no worries about jelly fish and sharks! Wonderful place and very romantic in the evening
7,Reaort style pool in a public park,"This is a great place for all the family of you are wanting a swim and a bbq in the park , their are life guards on duty, the water is warm , and it‚Äôs a great place if you have little kids . A must to do, we couldn‚Äôt stay too long as the day was very wet"
8,Lovely & relaxing.,This was a very nice and FREE activity for the family. The pool is ecellent and facilities are great.
9,Local,"My nephews loved the lagoon, it was clean and I noticed the life guards were fully aware of what was going on around them.Have used the BBQ in the past, ger there early so you can get a table."
10,Chilled out! ,"remember to bring the swim wear when visiting this place.  it is a great place for kids as they can spend hours on end here.  there are life guards there so it is pretty safe.  there is also a change room and a number of BBQ areas around the lagoon.  best thing about the Cairns Esplanade Lagoon is that it is free.  great for family outings.the weather was cool when we visited late August.if you did not bring anything to cook, the Cairns Night Markets is close by to grab a bite."
11,Refreshing,"My wife and I had a lovely swim at night in the lagoon. It's suitable for all, had two lifeguards and great fun."
12,Local sights,This is a great spot for a swim. We walked past after shopping and I wished I had my swimmers... I would have gone in but had to content myself with a paddle.
13,Good spot for breakfast ,This is a free area in Cairns. Lifeguards ok duty all the time. We did not actually swim when there (it was too cold and windy). But we loved the open space and the vibe. Would have spent more time there if weather was nicer. But do go. Great public place.
14,Brilliant pool in Cairns Esplanade ,"Spent several hours down at the lagoon, this place is great and the kids can run a muck... very clean and lots of seating and BBQ facilities"
15,Great place to spend the afternoon,This is one of my favorite lagoons that we have visited in recent times. Very much kid friendly with life guards on duty for everyone's safety.I might stand corrected but I think every Wednesday you can participate in group water aerobics and at the time of afternoon that the class is run the pool is packed which is a great sight to see.
16,A must visit to relax both day and night.,"I like to swim here, it is large and contains different depths that allow people of different heights to stand up in. A large sandy area that children and adults can play in, as well as fountains to play in. If children don't wish to use this area, try Muddy's playground just a bit further up. It seems like a fun waterpark."
17,Swim - Chill - Eat,"We didn't know how dangerous the beaches could be in Austraila so it was nice to play at a ""beach"" near the hotel.  The water wasn't too deep so didn't have to worry about the kids."
18,Cairns,Every place should have one of these for when it gets too hot you can just wander into the lagoon max depth is 1.5 mts it is well serviced with lifeguards and facilities
19,Use the Security Lockers,"Lovely lagoon to swim in, as you can‚Äôt swim in the sea in Cairns. They do free aqua aerobic classes here too."
20,Lagoon,This attraction is amazing. Who needs to swim in the beach? So safe for the kids as it is patrolled. Alongside it is a large park which is shady and attracts a lot of families. In the park there is also free entertainment by local bands and also a market with homemade merchandise. I highly recommend this area for all ages and I think it is great for families.
21,Be careful,"The lagoon is fabulous firstly because it is free!  It's very clean and has lifeguards on duty who were friendly and supervised diligently every time we visited.  It's quite large so that even on busy days it doesn't feel too crowded.  Although we only visited on weekdays in the school holidays - not on weekends.  There are toilets, showers and lockers available.  Definitely a great spot to while away a few hours."
22,Beautiful,"This is a truly awesome open pool with no entrance fee.The pool is located next to the (ugly) beach and can accommodate both kids and adults with enough ground for some sunbathing (although it can get crowded).The place is worth a visit during the day and evening alike, as it is open until 9PM.Nowadays, there's a nice Ferry wheel next to the lagoon.Highly recommended!"
23,A cool place to cool !!!,"We spent the day here today with our 9 year old and had the loveliest of days,  the lagoon is warm, there is shade though. Lifeguards all around. Toilets and cafes and restaurants nearby. Super safe and just perfect."
24,A fantastic pool beside the sea for everyone and it is free,Love the lagoon. It‚Äôs huge. Plenty of shade whilst your swimming if you want to get out of the sun. Great way to cool off. Open until late. Forget about booking a hotel with pool - you‚Äôre just going to want to swim here.
25,Great place for a swim,I visit lagoon with my kids every weekend and Kids always have fun playing and swimming on lagoon. Very well maintained and always under supervision of staff. I have 3 months old to 4 years old kids and I can have fun with all of them at one place üëçüèª
26,Great spot for the day! ,We had the best time at the end of the day swimming watching the sunset relaxing in this free lagoon! We loved it! Then went to dinner nearby. Highly recommend. There‚Äôs a place to change and use the restroom.
27,Nice place to cool off,"The lagoon is amazing best one we have seen by far, super clean, lifeguards on duty and police station with cameras right there. safe friendly and what a location location location, Cafes  near by, free BBQ's shade ,lights at night, right next to the boardwalk and magnificent large trees. 5 stars to Cairns."
28,Looks lovely and cool ,The kids loved it here. It was really relaxing and just a really nice place for the kids to swim & much around. Toilets close by (very handy for the kids) & super nice at sunset with buskers singing & playing music.
29,Beautifully refreshing,It's  basically a big free swimming pool. You don't have to worry about crocodiles or poisonous jelly fish in the summer time and they have life guards. The pool is mostly on a gradual slope with the shallower parts safe for kids. Sand around most if the edges gives a feeling if being at the beach and there is plenty of grass around to lay on as well.
30,Nice place to hang out,We love the pool lagoon. What a great concept. After our tours we would cool of at the pool. Relax and enjoy the surrounding.
31,"A spot in paradise, on a hot afternoon!",I really appreciate cairns built this beautiful swimming pool! Me and my wife swam in the morning. We admired nice atmosphere and place.
32,Amazing Logoon pool.,"This is a great place to come with the kids or even just on your own. Safe swimming with lifeguards on duty. Well graded lagoon from a depth scale, lovely outlook and relaxing atmosphere. And it‚Äôs free!! Full marks."
33,Beautiful lagune,"We visited this place a year ago and came back again today. It is a beautiful place, clean and family friendly. Best of all, it‚Äôs free entertainment!!"
34,Great for a chill,"We stopped by with a 4 year old later in the day, and it was lovely and warm, the pool was busy, lots of people strolling by which was fine, wasn't too keen on letting the toddler run around with the teens having some ""moments"" in the pool, but as a free experience, it was great."
35,Nice to cool off,Lovely clean water to swim in for free. You can sit on grass near the water and swim in shallow but cool water under sprinklers. Fun for kids as there‚Äôs sand running into the water. Great for this time of the year!
36,Perfect,"We had a really nice afternoon here relaxing after exploring the local area for a few days previously. The lagoon was clean, there was plenty of room, and it's obviously free which is a big bonus! Great to visit with kids too as it's safe and there's plenty of bits shallow enough for them."
37,Great swimming place,Cairns beachfront is really muddy and could have crocodiles or stingers. There is absolutely no way anyone could swim there. The local council has built this attractive big pool that even has a small sand beach. A lifesaver is also in daytime attendance. Very popular with locals and visitors
38,Australia adventure ,"Place was clean, had a lifeguard on, water was crystal clear and wonderful to swim in when you couldn‚Äôt swim in the Daintree river (crocodiles). Can get busy with children, but is a very nice sunspot for sunbathing too!"
39,"Perfect hangout place alone, with friends and family",The Lagoon in Cairns was fantastic. The water was lovely and warm and had different depths for swimming. There is a sandy beach leading onto the lagoon. It is surrounded by lovely parkland. Good cafeteria serving hot drinks and food . The toilets are very clean . Please note you will need 4 au dollars for the lockers. It is computerised so you Pre pay and digitally will be given a number to put on the computer. The lagoon leads to a nice walkway along the esplanade .
40,Great swim to cool us down.,"The lagoon is a good, safe place to be in the water, lots of different pools from babies to grownup kids.  A wonderful holiday atmosphere with places to bar-b-que, the fires/grills are there and free to use just bring your own food..... good day for families"
41,Good to spend the day,We always enjoy a visit to the Esplanade Lagoon but this time we found that it is actually a map of Queensland when looked at from above. Extra beautiful!
42,Mr,The lagoon is a great place for all ages. Kids will enjoy swimming in the shallow protected waters of the lagoon and there are plenty of excellent places around it for picnics.
43,Fabulous Free Facility,We loved this lagoon. It's very hot in January so grateful that the lagoon stays open til late..  9pm I think. We went swimming at about 7pm and water was lovely and warm and still lots of family  around. Lots of music playing on the street and the markets were across the road.. had dinner there. Excellent alternative to the beach especially since I've heard that crocs and jellyfish are common up north.  Lagoon was clean and lifesavers are visible from all areas of the lagoon.
44,Nice and all in,Its a shame that you cannot swim in most places along the coastline up north.  The lagoon is an epicentre of activity in Cairns City.
45,Awesome!,Everyone who was at the lagoon were having a great time. Great for parents with young babies as the can sit in the pool with them.
46,Bloomin lovely,Free the kids loved it top spot very family friendly great bbq area with life guards to help keep an eye on the kids
47,What a top spot,This water areas were pristine and fun to be at with a great ambiance created by the families and other people there.
48,Adventurebuddies42 goes swimming at Cairns Esplanade Lagoon,"The Cairns Lagoon pool is the best pool on the planet!  The lagoon area is muddy, dangerous with crocs swimming around and their is not a sandy beach area, as well!  The pool itself has a sandy beach style area on one side and the other is cemented.  There are all depths available if you have children.  They have life guards on each end and the police patrol the area well, since their is a police sub station on site. Outside of the pool area they  have recently added a ferris wheel, which gives you a scenic view of the area.  There are picnic tables and cook facilities for free, as long as you clean up when you are done.  There are public bathrooms with showers and baby changing areas.  There is also numerous shops, places to eat and drink, and the area is pretty safe."
49,A little piece of heaven and Great way to cool off,"Obviously, you cannot just swim in the sea around and the lagoon might seem like a good option,but I would not recommend it. Just 40 mins on the bus you have absolute pieces of paradice in Trinity beach and Palm Cove beach."
50,Great place and free,"This is a beautiful place to spend a few hours especially if you have children.  The lagoon is 4800 square metres of salt water with a very shallow end to a deeper end.  Lifeguards are present during normal hours of operation.  Very clean washrooms, lockers and even BBQs are nearby. Open year-round and close to restaurants and other attractions.The city have a lot of vision when they built this popular attraction!"
51,Great idea,"The lagoon is open most of the year, you can bring the family down for a refreshing dip in the hotter months or even join in to the free active living water activities on offer.  Little kids can enjoy splashing around in the water too in the shallower parts.  There is plenty of grassy shaded areas to sit and relax or read a good book, bbq areas, clean change rooms, lifeguards on duty, and a great little kiosk for an icecream."
52,LOVE! ,"Overlooking the ocean, this is a great swimming pool and is huge. Plenty of space for all and has coffee chops and eateries right at the pool. Great for kids with many shallow areas for kids, but watch them because there are some deep sections. Even has shaded areas in the pool and a sand beach."
53,Lovely pool! ,"I completely love Australia but this lagoon pool  it's so clean and it's just beside the sea, on a park, free And I really enjoy it"
54,Beautiful and refreshing!,Really enjoyed our time relaxing by the pool and cooling down in the water. Loads of different people down there from locals to flashy tourists. If you need to fill time and relax this is a good spot.
55,Good public pool,Unfortunately our visit clashed with the pool's cleaning morning - so check before you go. It was closed until 12.00 so we waited in a local caf√© with a coffee for a while. Beautiful infinity style pool overlooking the ocean. Plenty of shade on the grass to keep sheltered from the sweltering sun. Gentle sandy slope into the water and also a shaded area in the pool if required. Toilets/changing rooms and cafes close by. Well worth a visit.
56,Wonderful,What an awesome initiative. The lagoon is huge with varied depths and great space for kids to play safely. Lockers are available and lifeguards are on duty well into the early evening.
57,Fantastic idea!,"This public pool is huge and surrounded by much grass to soak up the sun. Sometimes you wonder though, if you should tell someone that they are really getting fried! But it might seem to be a crude come-on. This is not a lap pool though, just a place to cool off. Enjoy!"
58,Fabulous open air pool,What an amazing water park for all to enjoy. Loved the sand base and from city side looks like as infinity pool. So nice to see all the family groups enjoying themselves in the pool and surrounding park. Fabulous amenities and barbed he facilities.
59,"Beautiful place to lounge around, swim safely or just get the sun.","I lived here for 17 years and the esplanade was pretty well mud flats. The lagoon and picnic area is a huge attraction, and I was impressed by the cleanliness of the pool, the free bbq's, and the grassed areas. The landscaping is awesome and well maintained. We had a swim around lunchtime the day we arrived, then went back in late afternoon for a family bbq and night swim. It was just beautiful."
60,Nice swimming spot,It is very peachy along the esplanade  Everyone appeared to be enjoying the croc free water Lots of shade and picnic spots along the esplanade.
61,Afternoon wander,We loved the look of the place from afar. On visiting we found the water quite warm on a hot day when trying to cool down. But what was most worrying was the amount of drunks and homeless just plonking themselves in the middle of families with very young children.  We watched as one security guard tried to escort one very drunk man from the area but gave up when the drunk man sat in the middle of a group of people and stealing their meat off their BBQ.
62,"Family friendly, fun water area","This pool is amazing. The beach in cairns doesn‚Äôt exist, so this lagoon makes the foreshore a huge attraction. Very well maintained and patrolled by police. You feel very safe and happy when spending time there. And the pool is huge and clean! The board walk is also amazing. So many things to see and do as you take a long peaceful walk along the foreshore."
63,Beautiful Spot,"Sadly carins does not have a lovely beach front. But luckily for this open pool area it's great! It's free to anyone passing by! Life guards, toilets, lockers, shops all around. Pool is clean and warm, open till 9pm and looks beautiful on the evenings. You can sit by the sand or the grass you choose! It's a great idea and I spent all days sunbathing here, was perfect for a chilled day :)"
64,Great ‚Äòfree‚Äô space for families,"I understand why they need to do it in FNQ, but I really wish some of our NSW beachside councils could step up. This is great. Kids has a ball and it is even deep enough in spots for adults to cool off. Lockers available for hire at reasonable rates, change rooms with timed, warm showers. Food available, BBQ's etc. We visited late in the afternoon after having been to Kuranda and others, and the markets which are just adjacent were closing down, but there was some on street parking that was available. (There is also a parking area).It is filtered sea water, so you don't come out with stinging eyes and smelling of chlorine."
65,Great ‚ÄòFree‚Äô Family Fun,This area is absolutely beautiful! It‚Äôs nice & clean. The lawn area is beautiful to have a picnic or walk into the fountains to cool off on a hot Spring day. There are tons of shops around as well as eateries. Every city center should have places like this!!!
66,Great idea for all the family,"This is a great spot when the sun is beating down.Early mornings there is usually a water aerobics class or two to join into, as the day goes through more ad more people arrive.This is a very big pool, relaxingly shaped with very very shallow trickle down to a deep end of around one metre. Sandy areas foe young kids, shallow areas for babies, life guard on duty at certain times.Plenty if BBQs and seating. Or just relax on the sand. An array of coffee shops close by.Toilets and changing rooms next to it .All free."
67,Beautiful area,"This is a great facility. We were there on a very hot day and it was super busy. Clean looking water, perfect for dipping the feet. There was music being played, and it was very relaxing."
68,Check the area for good swim,Visited on Saturday 8th September. It was good to see so many people using this man made pool beside the main beach. Cairns has the perfect weather all year round just a pity nature didn't provide a pristine beach as well.
69,the best city pool on the planet!,Our family went at around 5:30 in the evening. There was only a few people swimming compared to the afternoon when there was a lot of people swimming. The water was cool but refreshing. The location is great! There‚Äôs bathrooms/changing rooms right there. Also the police are located right there. There‚Äôs plenty of close parking close by as well as picnic tables and grills. It‚Äôs neat that there‚Äôs a sandy beach-like area at one side of the pool. I saw several shallow areas for little ones to enjoy. It‚Äôs so nice that we were shocked that it‚Äôs free.
70,Enjoyed,The cairns lagoon is a nice place to swim as it is in a wonderful location situated on the cairns esplanade. It is a large pool which is just in my metres away from the ocean. Great for family and friends to go!
71,"Nice, safe swimming area",Given the number of salt water crocodiles in the area it is best to use the lagoon. Very clean with lots of space and it is near to the shops for supplies.
72,Great spot,This is great for younger kids or if you just can‚Äôt be bothered driving to the beach. It was clean and kids had a good time
73,Great spot!,Clean and quiet. It has lifeguards and bbq.  It is a good option to spend the day alone or with children.
74,Fabulous,"Only stayed there for a sun bake in the afternoon, the concept of having an artificial beach in.the middle.of the city is great but the water was too cold to play in. Probably will be very popular in summer."
75,Great place for a swim,Great place for a walk and to enjoy the sunset. The kids have played all arvo on the kids playground. It was a great time!
76,Nice location,"A really good & necessary attraction considering the tides, stingers etc. Great to see no nappy kiddies this time around ? Lots of activities with free water aerobics etc. and lots of shaded areas to relax and lifeguards on duty ! Great for families to enjoy a BBQ & a Dip !"
77,Beautiful and big,"Absolutely loved this idea. It is clean, big and safe with life guards on duty till late. Choice of sitting/lying on the sand that goes into the beginning of the pool/lagoon or amble room on the grass area. Bbq areas right there also so great to make a day of it. Lockers are also available to hire for just $2 for an hour so you don‚Äôt have to worry about valuables."
78,Great setup,"The Cairns Esplanade and lagoon is very beautiful. It's and the lagoon has lifeguards who keep a sharp eye out for people while in the man made lagoon. There are toilets and changing rooms, and barbeques free of use. The sunsets are to die for."
79,Love this place,Great pool for the whole family. The facilities are excellent and clean with surrounding parkland to relax in. Life guards are on duty. This is a credit to Cairns. Loved it.
80,Good spot at its free.,"We loved the boardwalk and all it had to offer, including the swimming pool which was fantastic enjoyed by kids and adults it was really clean.The kids play ground and splash park were also a fabulous place to entertain young children and all for free.The surrounding gardens and toilet/Shower amenities were also clean.Well done Cairns council Victoria has nothing like this for visitors."
81,Such a splendour!,"Life guard on duty, which is great considering the amount of little children.Easy access into the lagoon. Beautifully cool on a hot day, plenty of shade.Change rooms and lockers available"
82,Early morning walks,"Shade options, shallow areas as well as deep areas. Clean. Toilet facilities available nearby. We really enjoyed hanging out here on our holidays."
83,Perfect stay. Beautiful beach,"A public bath, that‚Äôs what it is. Many homeless people use this ‚Äòpool‚Äô as a place to get clean. On the hot days it‚Äôs packed, and not too pleasant really. Good place to cool off though!"
84,Relax by the pool!!,"This is a very nice lagoon. Perfect for families to chill and enjoy the water. A very popular place, especially on weekends. It's huge and can accommodate a large crowd."
85,Beautiful but busy,This place is paradise.Located in Cairns centre the lagoon is crystal clear and blue. We were there on a sunny day so the place was busy but not too overcrowded. Toilets and changing rooms are on site too. Well worth a visit and its free!!!
86,Great walk ,It‚Äôs a great place to cool down and relax great views of the beach and near to restaurants and bars. We had a lovely swim and enjoyed relaxing in the area afterwards
87,Asset to Cairns,"Altough i‚Äôm not a huge fan of public pools, for the ones I know, that one is on the top of my list. The city don‚Äôt have a beach to swim, so the pool is a good way to take a swim. The area around the pool is nice too, have a good beach vibe, with people laying down and having fun in family or with friends. Good place to spend a time!"
88,GREAT CAIRNS SPACE FOR ALL,My toddler loved it . What s great time and it‚Äôs so large she can run around without too many people . Shallow and clean . They play music here too and we joined in on the water exercise later that day . Cairns is fun
89,"Cool, refreshing and free","On the far side of the lagoon towards the Cruise Terminal there are a bank of security lockers to store your valuables for a small fee. Not an area to leave your phone etc with your towel whilst you swim.Nice large lagoon, shallow, clear water and very warm. The water was busy all day from early morning to late at night. Lots of areas of grass to sit and lay on. If you do not have a pool with your room then this us the place for you.At night the mosquitos and other biting insects come out to play. We both were stung walking around the grass perimeter during the evening when walking around the lagoon. Before we saw some locals covering themselves with repellant."
90,Best way to spend a sunny day in Cairns,"Enjoyed a nice dip with my partner and the lagoon yesterday. A great place to relax, enjoy the sun & go for a swim."
91,Different,"I went to the Lagoon on a Saturday, there was a nice small market near by the Lagoon. I think on weekends it‚Äôs a little bit full on the Lagoon because there are a lot of big families over there and a lot of kids. You also have some barbeque spots in this area.It‚Äôs nice for refreshing and relax for a little bit, but only for a few hours not a hole day."
92,Great afternoon spent here,"Great idea of a clean safe pool on the edge of the bay, feel like you are in a resort open to all. Come and go as you please, plenty if space . Winter water temp is a bit chilly though.,Lie out on sand or under a palm tree. BBQ's and picnic tables caters for everyone."
93,A day at the pier,A very good set up for everyone to enjoy. Surrounded by grass areas that are perfect for picnics!The lagoon is under watch by lifeguard so it‚Äôs safe and family friendly
94,Great free activity for anyone,The beach at Cairns is not somewhere you would swim - the warning signs about crocodiles are somewhat of a deterrent! The Lagoon on the esplanade allows you to swim & sunbathe in safety & with a sea view!! A win win situation.
95,Great free of charge facility,"Because you can't swim in the waters around the Cairns CBD, this is a brilliant addition to the town's facilities. It's basically a very large swimming pool with easy access, surrounded by sand and grass and with lifesavers just in case you're not a strong swimmer. I came at the beginning of the day and the end of the day and always had a relaxing time in and around the water."
96,Cairns safe both day and night,Great lagoon for families to take small children to entertain. Not as good as Southbank lagoon in Brisbane where families can swim and sunbath but a nice place for young families to cool off.
97,As good as a lagoon can be,Took the kids here in July so it was only 25 degrees. The day we went there was a bit of a breeze so it was a bit cold out but in the water in the middle of winter it was still pretty bearable for adults. Kids can swim in ice water and still have fun so they are no judge.  It‚Äôs in a great place and it‚Äôs a good idea for councils to have free to the public. I did hear rumours that after dark the backpackers make it a bit of a make out spot but it was completely fine when we were there (it was also during covid so mostly Australians on holidays I‚Äôd say).
98,A Spring morning in the sun,Very nice place to swim relax have fun and see people. You can buy a nice meal and eat or prepare it there. Even toilets ans showers are there. You just have fun!
99,Super Pool. ,"Located downtown, the pool is a lovely place to relax and enjoy the water. Many safe ways to enter and very easy for young children to enjoy. Change rooms were great. A great free way to enjoy some time in Cairns."
100,Safe relaxing place,"We had booked a trip to cairns long before we knew about the lagoon, but as we spoke to more and more people who saw us with a little one l, they said how perfect it is and how much we‚Äôd enjoy it.And that we did! It‚Äôs fantastic! First of all it‚Äôs public so I had assumed it‚Äôs kinda ‚Äúskanky‚Äù but it‚Äôs so clean both in the water and the surrounding area I was shocked. It has a super general ramp I  from end to end. At its deepest it‚Äôs 1.5 m. But there plenty of places along the sides to just sit and relax.It‚Äôs a great place to bring a picnic or even someFood to put on the free public barbecues.The toilets and showers are a bit on the other side of the ‚Äúsuper clean‚ÄùScale but still helpful nonetheless.We spent almost a full day here so you can imagine how happy we were this was available to us."
101,Great attraction and facilities ,Nice to see everyone can keep cool for no price in the tropical cairns!Was nice to just dip my feet in after a long day of exploring!
102,Cairns seafront,"Lovely pool, perfect for cooling off and chilling out! Very clean, shallow sections for kids and a choice of sandy and tiled sections."
103,Wonderful attraction,We visited here several times in our 4 day stay in Cairns. The grandchildren (5 and 6 year olds) would have stayed all day but their mum and grandparents also enjoyed the swim and atmosphere a definite attraction to visit and enjoy in Cairns
104,Unbelievable!,This is such a lovely safe and clean spot to take kids. If you‚Äôre worried about stingers in the ocean this is a good option. We took a picnic and had a great day although I did realise other than a sandwich bar selling healthy treats there was no other food outlets - other than Mac Donald‚Äôs across the street there didn‚Äôt appear to be any other food options.
105,Vacation ,"Well, it's  free. Beautiful sunset views, little cafe and showers and change rooms as well as lockers for free. So pretty recomendable"
106,Great for people watching ,Into grandson and I thoroughly enjoyed our time. Splashing and frolicking in the water. We will be returning
107,IT‚ÄôS FREE !,"We stopped off with my toddler son after going the aquarium and ended up spending a good couple of hours here. He enjoyed just picking up sans and moving it to other places mostly!! It was clean, refreshing, had a lifeguard and there was even a ska band playing great music at the bandstand just along the way.

If your looking to enjoy the night life . It‚Äôs cheap and close to everything."

The only downside was that the disabled toilets needed a key, and by the time we found out who had the key a family member had an accident:("

Spectacular lights at night.Lots of restaurants and food outlets just across the road.We found the water lovely although the locals were wearing jumpers !"
125,Fantastic place to spemd the day,This was a nice surprise and big enough for a large volume of people. Shallow areas for those weak swimmers and deeper for others.

The water is gorgeous & not too busy

A free CLEAN swimming pool in the centre of town. You will also find: clean toilets, shaded areas, grass areas, free BBQs, lifeguards, security, alcohol free zone, varying depths in the pool from toddler to 1.5m deep. It overlooks the waterfront, so has a stunning vista. The water was warm when we visited, I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the sun or manually warmed/cooled year round. 9pm closure which is enforced by security guards. Lots of food options straight across the road. The odd busker providing light entertainment. I can‚Äôt recommend this stop enough! üëçüëçüëç"
132,Nice for younger kids,"Awesome, massive Council pool which is hugely popular even in September. There's a sandy area and caf√®. We wanted to go on our last trip but ran out of time, so glad we got there this time!! Its also ope  to 9pm although no lifeguard at night."

138,What a bonus!,The esplanade and the lagoon are a great spot for families and people to relax and enjoy the great weather in Cairns. The lagoon is well maintained and supervised by life guards. It‚Äôs cleaned regularly but does smell a bit of chlorine. The walking path along the beach front is also great.

151,Lovely spot for a swim! ,"what a perfect area to layback and relax with the lapping water over your feet, this area is the perfect family area, there are BBQ, seating undercover and a canteen, the shops are close by if needed. the pool has areas for babies, toddlers and kids to swim and to let you feel safe, there are life guards on patrol, these guards patrol the waters to make sure everyone is safe,  (they aren't baby setters!  so you have to look after your own kids, so don't just dump your kids there and go off.) this is a family place,"
152,The Esplanade Lagoon...... A great place for a kid to find friends....,A great place to relax throughout the day. Not very populated in the early AM or evening which IMO are the best times to go due to the sun. I got burnt very badly here despite putting on sunscreen multiple times. Be careful and make sure to reapply!
153,Wonderful place along the water,Feel like I own the place/Cairns. We had few rainy days whilst staying in Cairns and it has cleared up so went for swimming at night. How beautiful the place is. Light was glowing side of the wall and was beautifully presented. Depth was just good enough for my kids to enjoy. Atmosphere was awesome and safe guard were doing their job promptly so felt so safe.
154,Great Venue,"I'm not sure if you can find a giant outdoor free swimming pool anywhere else but this is awesome. Plenty of shade and sandy areas and the pool is huge. A massive hit with the locals, it's packed. Well done to those who came up with this concept."

Well done to Cairns local authorities for providing such excellent facilities."
156,Nice place to experience sunset,In a good  central location . Rooms we perfect for all we needed as only sleeping in them . Breakfast could improve though
157,Safe from the Crocs!,"Beautiful man made lagoon, safe for kids, small beach for sandcastles, surrounded by trees and grass with picnic tables and BBQ hutsWonderful for familiesFood , ice cream nearby. Saturday market stalls with the usual , but not bad quality.The esplanade itself is very pleasant, a lot of walkers, joggers walking along the pathway shaded by trees , the ocean is the other side of the breakwater, with the yacht basin within walking distance"
158,Fabulous swimming in patrolled pool,"Exactly what a tropical location with no swimable beach needs.  It's fantastic and free,  the pool is large with sand beach areas as well as fountains.

Life guards are on duty and it's open all year."
159,Great way to spend time and relax,Beautiful spot right on the boardwalk. Safe spot to swim with lifesaver on duty. Plenty of shade surrounding lagoon.
160,A Gem in the City!,"The lagoon is an excellent place to visit on a hot day in Cairns. It is free and has great hours. The seating around the lagoon is limited so pack a towel or chair to sit on. The sun is very intense (the UV indicator was on extreme the day I visited) so make sure to pack sunscreen. All ages were present, including children, sunbathing teens, and the elderly."
161,Walking about ,"The lagoon is just that, looks like a nice beach, sand and all, but shallow.  Lots of folks bring their kids, 20 somethings sit in the shade and chill.  Us old folks, well, we wander thru, hoping to find a shady spot, usually just cooling off in the water.  stop by and enjoy!"
162,Day out in Cairns,"The lagoon is so beautiful located next to the ocean! Beautiful view, and what a joy to soak in the water and enjoy the sunset after a day trip. Great for all ages, especially families! Wish I had brought my kids here when they we're yong."
163,Great safe place to swim,We arrived in Cairns early to allow us an hour on the Esplanade around the lagoon. There is so much happening to view and experience before Cairns livens up. We strolled around the lagoon enjoying the warmth of the rising sun and the exercise. Life in Cairns this time of the year has so much to offer and it doesn‚Äôt have to cost $s. What a wonderful way to start a new day in Cairns üòÄüåüüåüüíú
164,Nice place to swim! ,"How lucky are the people of Cairns. This pool and surrounds are the best public baths I've seen. Friends and family in WA should be very jealous. Cooling, crystal clear and clean water. Well maintained and  has a life guard on duty. Loved it."

170,Perfect place to chill with friends,"The boardwalk is a terrific walk especially with young children. There is so much of interest for adults and children all along the walk.  There are many shops across the road all along the walk where you can buy food, drinks, ice creams etc. there is also a cafe opened during the day about 3/4 the way along the boardwalk north of town. This cafe is terrific and surrounded by playgrounds and sprinkler park for the kids."

Clean toilet facilities with warm showers and lockers outside.Pool itself is quite large with small beach like areas for small children to play. Max depth is 1.1m so not bad for children from 5 years with swimming experience. There are small trees dotted around to obtain shade etc... If you can get one!Free entry is bonus with small Cafe for coffee, ice-cream and snacks. Overall nice place for few hours to cool off."

179,ENJOYABLE,"Enjoyed the refreshing lagoon with my husband, 8 month old, and 3.5yr old.  A beautiful view, very clean pool.  Was disappointed when the lifeguard did not allow my 3.5yr old to utilise a zoggs swim ring, because it didnt have a seat in it.  My child was under my constant supervision the whole time so I was quite disappointed and returned to our holiday park to enjoy the pool there instead."
180,Best thing in cairns ,"Great large free outdoor swimming pool, near the harbor.  Nice place to hang out on a hot day.  Bring your swimsuit.  As I recall  there were lifeguards."
181,Lovely area,"Loved this lagoon. Enjoyed several hours here. The lagoon pool was clean and clear. Lifeguards on duty as well. Loved the ledge around the pool to sit on if needed.  The park surrounding it with benches, picnic tables and BBQs was being used as well. The locker set up was great and you can open and reclose during your paid time. Large locker was $3 for 2 hours. Toilets and showers were well maintained and clean. There were some shady areas and trees. Cairns is so lucky to have this great feature and close to food and drink as well. Well done Cairns"

The depth goes from mere inches at the kiddy paddling end, to adult deep at the other. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúbeach‚Äú on one side. It‚Äôs clean, there are lifeguards on duty. Unbelievably, this facility and it‚Äôs surrounding park, are right on the edge of the shopping and restaurant area of the city. Just across the road. In the park there are free public barbecues, and tables where you can take your food and picnic in the shade."

199,Must see attraction.,Cairns is truly a beautiful tourist destination. Not too crowded and busy. Even without a guide a guide l could easily get around. The esplanade was a favourite of mine. It's also amazing how its built on mud flats
200,Beautiful,We found the idea of a public pool quite interesting. Very well thought through from local authorities.
201,Beautiful Cairns,Extremely clean Nice pool Free to use Great for all ages Nice grass area and bbq area with tables and chairs

205,Absolutely fantastic,"I thought it would be weird swimming in such a public place... but I was wrong. This is basically a public pool (a clean one) with sand banks that re create a beach. Aside from the fact that the actual beach does not look good, there are a number of indigenous creatures that can seriously hurt you (crocs, crabs, jellyfish) living there.No contest. Man-made beach wins all the time."
206,Wonderful at night,Better than Brisbane‚Äôs Southbank! Our kids loved the lagoon. Very pleasant to sit there in the afternoon and watch the passing parade.
207,Great Place,"Free public lagoon pool in central Cairns. Kids of all ages, as well as adults will love this. Tropical garden setting. Plenty of shade and nearby cafes and restaurants. Perfect place to cool off."

209,The lagoon is a great addition to the Esplanade and I was impressed how clean and,"Just visited cairns after 20 years , I must say that what they have done with the beach front is just magic ! Gorgeous beach , fantastic bbqs , a great place to walk or ride a bike Gardens are so beautiful! Also great restaurants, and shop people are so friendly Thank you CAIRNS! I‚Äôll be back *****"
210,Just relax,Not much to say. It's monitored by lifeguards. Little food shop nearby. Fairly clean change facilities and toilets as well.Definitely a great place to take the kids for a swim
211,Get together with family from Melbourne ,"Wonderful temperature - lovely setting and layout. Small considerations- while I noticed that eating near the water is policed heavily, smokers seemed to have free reign. There were a few bits of rubbish and yuck in the water - to be expected but still gross. The bathrooms didn‚Äôt have a shelf or anywhere to put dry stuff - only hooks. Normally I prefer hooks but my stuff kept dropping on the wet ground. All in all a great spot and wonderful community facility."
212,Refreshing escape,A wonderful open area with huge pool and outdoor area in the CBD. Plenty of shade and BBQ areas. Suitable for all ages. Very clean amenities with plenty of toilets & showers
213,Super spot!,"Very surprised to see this lagoon free of charge and actually in good condition.Lifeguards on duty during daylight hours, water fountain in the deep end of the lagoon.

219,Nice Walk,"Great place to visit and just chill out. Fantastic sun spot! Shaded space available, ideal for all ages."
220,cool off with a view,Love this place in the morning around 6ish before it gets too hot. It‚Äôs a morning institution for those in Cairns and a great place to people watch and bring a hat as it can get v hot
221,Fantastic Pool,"Amazing streach of shops and the pool is awesome. I wish I lived in cairns, it is just beautiful.Let's hope they stop chopping down trees"
222,Very relaxing,"If you are in Cairns a visit to the lagoon is a must. It‚Äôs safe, clean, manned by life guards and large enough to have room for everyone, young and old alike.

223,Cairns Lagoon,"Crystal clear. Great on those hot days. Can have a picnic. There are Shops, restaurants and cafes near by."
224,Beautifully clean and tidy,We are here for four days after an roundtrip through Australia. From my point of view it‚Äòs the best place and nicest beach in October to relax. Good restaurants and hotels direct on the beach.
225,A Public Bath. ,One has to wonder why no one swims in the sea just to be told of crocs and murky water and while a bit nervous going even near the sea learned that a beautiful lagoon located near the park and in front of the city-that we can swim in..hangout and its safe.
226,Nice,"The cairns esplanade lagoon is a great place for locals, families and tourists to swim, relax and enjoy the beauty of the region!"
227,"Clean, relaxing and safe","Beautiful pool in a great location, , clean and a great public asset. The facilities are good and it's a great place to relax."
228,Must try and relax ,"Your Accomodation doesn‚Äôt feature a pool? No sweat. The Lagoon on the Esplanade is the perfect spot to relax and splash about. It is:- clean and family friendly with a play-beach on one side- warm as you‚Äôd expect the ocean to be- open 8AM-10PM and for free! incl. shower facilities - the perfect place to hang out with friends and family with many covered tables and benches to protect from sun or rainshowers- perfect picnic-spot in town: free BBQ facilities, free cooking gas and lovely lawns- on the Esplanade, so close to grab ice cream or coffee- also: lifeguard on dutyDefinitely visit when in Cairns.

240,Free cool-down üòé ,"Warm water, family friendly, free swimming location. Lagoon is open from 6am till early evening. The water is treated which is reassuring with the numbers who use it. Life guards are onsite. Shallow end for little swimmers and the deep end is 1.5m."
241,One of the best things about Cairns (and there's plenty to choose from),"Open from 6am to 9pm, most days, this is a great place to cool down, relax, swim, or just hang around with friends.

And the best thing is it's for FREE!! YEES MATE"
244,Awesome community pool,"Love the lagoon (as do most locals), conveniently located close to most hotels/motels/hostels, with clean toilets/showers/BBQ facilities (all free) what is not to love?

248,A treasure of Cairns ,"Let‚Äôs face it Cairns doesn‚Äôt pretend to be a seaside resort but the lagoon gives anyone, young or old, the opportunity for a relaxing  swim  or paddle. With shallow entrance if required. Sandy entrance if required and lockers for hire for a few dollars. Great for all with lifeguards on site. And it‚Äôs free!"

255,Great for chill time,"We love Cairns, it's the capital of the Tropical North, but strangely the city doesn't have a nice beach. Not to let that stand in the way of creating a pleasant atmosphere, the council (we presume) created this Lagoon on The Esplanade, and it's really nice. Well done Cairns."

258,Awesome lagoon ,"Located at the southern end of the Esplanade, the Lagoon is a clean and large artificial ‚Äúpool‚Äù where it is far better and safer to wade and swim in than in the sea (and mud when the tide is out) where dangerous jellyfish stingers and other marine creatures can be found.  It‚Äôs surrounded by lush green gardens and grassed areas.  It‚Äôs also a nice place to visit at daybreak when it is quiet and relaxing."

276,Too cold for winter,Great spot to cool down in the city and kill a few hours. The beach effect made it a good spot for our young kids
277,Family friendly swim,"The lagoon is just excellent. There are plently of zoned areas, there is sand, there are deeper areas, there are fountains. The water temperature was more like getting in to a bath than a pool This is just a superb facility that Cairns should be very proud of. There are toilets, changing areas, showers, lockers, a cafe. There are plently of shaded areas both in and out of the water. We visited a number of time during our stay in Cairns but should have really visited every day - it was that good! Our 1 year old and 3 year old adored it and asked to 'go to the lagoon'. Fab!! Definitely go!"
278,Cairns Esplanade Lagoon,"I found this wonderful oasis in the heart of Cairns to be such an idyllic place for people of all ages to relax, wind down & cool off.

280,Beautiful place,"Plenty of shade and seating. Sitting areas, change rooms, toilets etc. Shallow child friendly areas available."
281,Perfect afternoon for a swim after a tour,"It is an open pool opened for everyone from early in the morning till late in the evening. There are also some pilates classes a couple days of the week right next to the pool, as well as some other sport. In my opinion this is a totally highlight in Cairns and a must do attraction when in Cairns. It contains a shower area with toilets etc. I suggest bringing a good mood and a high SPF Factor with you! Enjoy it!"
282,Very relaxing area!,"I went for a wonderful walk down the boardwalk, enjoying what it had to offer but wondering where the beach was, seems there isn't much in the way of beach here BUT then I found the lagoon, and all the people! What a killer pool! It has sand it has beautifully clear water and lifeguards! Surrounded by trees and extended pretty much right up to the sea wall this is the real gem of the boardwalk! Cairns knows how to do public amenity and they have it all on show along this stretch topped off with this cherry! Well done is all I can say! Wouls Highly reccomend Cairns due to this atmosphere catalysing pocket of community good vibes!"
283,Great place to just chill. ,"Visited the cairns esplanade one morning when we just wanted a couple of hours to relax. All I can say is wow!! What an exceptional facility and free of charge. So beautiful to swim in the salt water and look over the sea, as there‚Äôs no beach in Cairns itself."
284,Fantastic Council-provided huge pool!,Clean. Plenty of space and a nice stretch of water to cool off in with no bloody feat of getting eaten or mutilated.

286,Esplanade lagoon.,"Lovely walk and war memorial. Nice esplanade and stunning view across the water. Plenty cafes, coffee along the way and markers at the weekend."
287,Family holiday ,"A Cairns must do. When we were in Cairns this week we experienced one of the hottest days in a long time and the Lagoon provided sweet relief from the elements. There is the right amount of shade for the sun conscience. It was also excellent to see the life guard looking out for a young tourist who had left her bag out of sight and unattended, advising her to put it where it can be seen or in a locker."
288,Romantic weekend to cairns ,"We were here on our road trip on the east coast. The sad thing about Cairns is that there used to be a beautiful beach here, till the 1920's. It has been sold off for the building industry, and in 10 years time it was gone. This is happening still all over the world today! It is all explained in info displays on the esplanade of Cairns.Anyway, Cains has made up a compensation for the muddy waterfront that the sand merchant left behind : a beautiful artificial lagoon.We visited the lagoon early morning. It is well kept, clean and inviting. A superb place to visit when you are worn down by many hours in the drivers seat..."
289,Free sandy fun!,"Huge community pool.  Lots of room to either lay-out in the sand, or on the grass, or just sit ‚Äòpoolside.‚Äô   The lagoon is right on the shore, with a walking path separating the beach from the pool.  It was for everyone, as there were all kinds of people swimming, sunbathing, relaxing, or just sipping their toes in the water.  Great for families and kids, as well as adults looking for a big pool to relax by/in.   I loved it, and spent half a day sitting in the water."
290,Really great to cool down,Clean pool with great outlook over Cairns esplanade. Very nice.There are plenty of tables and BBQs surrounding the pool so you can make a day of it relaxing by the pool in the park.
291,Refreshing ,"When you visit Cairns, take some time and walk along the entire esplanade/ boardwalk and check out all the area has to offer. This is a good way to familiarize yourself with every thin. At one end of the esplanade you will find the lagoon pool this is a great place for family and friends to come together.  They also have gas bbqs on site and public toilet facilities. At first we not sure if we would actually use this lagoon area as there is so much to do in Cairns. But after taking in a number of excursions over the past could of days we decided to just take it easy and this turned out to be great fun."
292,Great cool down in the city ,What an awesome place. The mudflats rule the foreshore Of Cairns. But the Lagoon is just perfect. It breaks it up and is absolutely fantastic. If they want to go the next step it would have to look at Brisbane‚Äôs Lagoon. Well done Cairns for transforming the area into something useful and amazing.
293,Fantastic public space ,Take some time out to have a swim here and lay in the shade on the grass and take in the sights. The lagoon is great.
294,Great idea ,"Awesome spot. A large park on the edge of the city and the harbour. Dotted with trees and lined with restaurants for a quick snack, meal or a cocktail. The pool is shaped like a lagoon with an infinity view to the ocean. The depth ranges from millimetres for little kids to about 1.8 metres. There are public toilets and change rooms and the lagoon is patrolled by life guards. The surrounding park is beautifully maintained and lots of spots exist just to put your stuff down, sit and watch the world go by. One of the best public spaces I've ever been in. Well done Cairns."
295,Wonderful swimming facility,"After such a hot weekend, it was amazing to be walking along the esplanade and to go for a quick dip in the lagoon and keep going. Everyone enjoyed it, especially the kids!"
296,Lovely walk ,"The aesthetic esplanade lagoon is a defining part of the foreshore tying together the township, boardwalk, gardens and estuary to present an integrated identity that helps make Cairns unique. It becomes both a focus and a locus for foreshore activity and helps make Cairns a place for people."
297,Amazing space in the heart of the city,"The Cairns Esplanade is simply stunning. It has watering holes and eating establishments aplenty across the road and plenty of grassy parks and trees, children's play area adjacent to a spectacular Lagoon. The iconic 'flying fish' sculpture in the middle of the lagoon backs onto a walkway and ocean. The water is warm, not too deep and surrounded by decks and even a sandy beach-like area with some sail-cloth cover. The Cairns climate lends itself to swimming opportunities and this one is exceptional. There are facilities to keep valuables, life-guards, and parking areas. Each time I go I spend my happy hours just soaking up both the sun and the scenery. Brilliant!"
298,Cairns Lagoon,"Victoria, NSW, SA, Tasmania, NZ people who suffer winter weather should go to Cairns. Cairns Esplanade lagoon is perfect place to relax, have a warm water swim etc. Well maintained with life guards on watch, young & not so young can enjoy the vast area of water.Cafes and ther facilities are closely located."
299,Best place to swim,"A Cairns council initiative, free to be used by the public. toilet and other amenities facilities and change rooms are provided and our excellent. The actual swimming pool is huge, clean, well looked after, with great facilities nearby. The shallow gradient and various depths in the pool with fountains in the Cairns tropical weather is something that little children love!"
