0,VERY BIG!! ,One day is not enough to see the whole place but it's not that interesting though...Unless you are into miniature works...its quite great....its like seeing the whole of China in one place...but fake miniature creations that are as tall as people or a bit higher....it has chinese opera shows...magic shows...and decent restaurants and a lot of street food style...One good thing is they have motorized bikes u can rent to go around the  whole place...because its big!!
1,Spring Fling,"There is a lot to see and do and one day, we found, was not enough. The 3 parks are together. We took 3 days and saw a few shows.which were amazing.  Like to go back one day."
2,Great memories,"To much to see and do for one day. The are 3 parks. Really saw a few shows, there are amazing. The Chinese folk culture village and splendid China for learning chinese culture. In the middle of the park fighting warriors. In the afternoon there is a nice lighting show, with dancing dragons and Chinese culture on the end a fireworks. On hollidays come early to get seats."
3,So so,"This place is like a miniature of china. Very huge park, if you got some energy to walk it'll take around 5-6hours to explore all the places do don't forget to bring drinking water. There's a bycycle or golf-cart for rent if you don't have enough time to explore all the places, but I'm not sure how much will it cost.Don't forget to bring your camera!"
4,China cultural village,"Plan one full day on the parkIt is a bigggg park and you will want to enjoy it without hassleThe scenery is beautiful and you can learn a lot of chinese history and culture.I enjoyed visiting the park and regretted that we cannot cover all of the park.One downside, most of the attractions is not included in the ticket. You will have to buy another tickets for some attractions.Food was good, with tourist price."
5,A microcosm of China. A must see if you are in SZ,Beautiful grounds and magical places. Really worth exploring. You will need a few hours to cover the entire place but well worth it.
6,a huge culture park,The park itself is huge but pretty old. Most of the sights and attractions are so so only but not a bad way to spend an afternoon if you don’t have anything else better to do. Ticket is very expensive at RMB200 per person.
7,Nice but not something worth a detour ,"1st time for my family to come to China... so what's best than to have a global overview of China's wonders and historical sites before choosing where to go ? Splendid China park is really one of the best i ever visit. 200rmb for adult or kids taller than 1,60m ... 100rmb for young kids ... it really worth it. You can spend 3-4h to visit it and enjoy perfect copies of the real ones ... from Beijing to GreatWall , from Longmen grottoes to Potala or from Tulous to Elephant hill ... you will enjoy all important sites. Drinks or food inside are better now than before and if you want to enjoy it go during weekdays ;)Do not forget to take the monorail for the global view. You can rent also electrical vehicle to less suffer under the sun (120rmb/hour for 2 + 500rmb for rental caution )A must in Shenzhen from 7 to 77years ;)"
8,Fun,"In my opinion this is not worth visiting or at most you should not spend there more than one hour. Spend more time in China Folk Village, just near Splendid China."
9,"Interesting, entertaining, worthwhile ","This is a nice place to visit and walk around for an afternoon. It's not the most exciting or thrilling place, but it's a relaxing trip. The translation of Chinese signs is a bit odd in most places. It's located very centrally so it's easy to get to and from from  most places in Shenzhen."
10,Lovely Attraction,"This place is Huge and you really need around 4-5 hours to explore this even more. See every single place. Must watch the Theatre Show. Walk along the Long river side and see the old villages miniatures along the River/Canal side. Walk till the end. When you enter you find the place smaller but if you will explore the full park, you will see different zones and you should see each and every zone.The wooden bridge and the Big Chinese bridge. The Hill top area and the water falls. This place will make you feel you are somewhere interior in Reginal China. It is worth spending a Full day."
11,Fun Place,"It is a great place to explore The country in a day, a lot number of live shows that we keep you enjoyed"
12,Good place for a day trip,"Why do a tour of China when you can see it all in one day...I have been here twice, it provided great respite from the relentless shopping of Shenzen.  Each time I go I am reminded that there is so much variety and diversity within China, that it highlights there is so much I don't know.  Having said that I am puzzled that Mongolia and Thailand appear to be included in the park, are they really China? Is this historical or aspirational??It's quirky, there are English broadcasts, despite the fact that both times I have been I have not seen any other foreigners.  It's a fun day out, give yourself time, and don't miss the Mongolian horse riding, by far my favourite show..."
13,Educational,"If you want to look at all Chinese marvels in a short time and in a cheap way this is exactly what you need. Mini copies of a lot of Chinese architecture ensembles, from the  famous Great Wall and Forbidden City and up to remote mountain villages and Buddha statues. I was surprised to recognize that China includes not only ""Chinese"" but also ""Muslim"", ""Mongolian"" and a lot of other cultures.The park consists of 2 parts: left from the gates is ""the mini-China"" and right side is Folk Culture Village with a lot of shows and entertainments during a day. Check the schedule on your entry booklet. Both parts are interesting and visit here can take a whole day."
14,Day trip long day,"This is a much better miniature park than window of the world. You get to see three fantastic shows for only 180 rmb as well as see all the famous miniatures of china. Make sure you time your visits accordingly, you will need a whole day here to see everything. Make sure you don't miss any of the three big shows, that's really where you will get your money's worth. The best one I seen so far is the horse riding show, where the battle lead Genghis Khan took place. The park is huge, so prepare to walk a lot. The food at this place is really good and for a fair price compare to some of the other theme parks."
15,Incredible interesting and amazing ,You can spend the hole day in the park and still a lot to be discovered .very nice live shows with horses and dancing
16,A great day and evening out,It's a nice enough way to spend an afternoon but the whole place could do with a bit of TLC. There are some good views of the surrounding city. It's a good place to visit but not at the top of my list of things to do in Shenzhen.
17,Get to know Chinese Culture better,I like this a lot!I know it's not like so real as it is a theme park but I think it is really well researched and well done. The cultures are all encompassed here and it's quite enlightening. I like it a lot!Don't miss the performances!
18,Nice one-stop shop to learn about China's minority groups,"It is a great place to visit. Frankly speaking, I expected sth a bit different, but it was still great to see all these miniatures from all over China, and not only. Although I liked the second part of the oart better, the one with the huts and tribes. It is open space, so please bring umbrellas with you( i got sunburnt) and water, as the prices are incredibly high there."
19,Great place,If you do not have the time to visit all the beautifull sites in China this is a good choice. Very nice park with nice detailed miniature houses/structures. You can easliy spend the whole afternoon there.
20,A great way to discover China's many cultures,Don't miss this amazing place. You have to walk a lot but you will be able to see not so miniature historical places and monuments from all China.
21,Nice place to learn about China ,"Start with hesitation but after spending 4 hours there I'm sure it is worthy to visit.  Don't forget put you on comfortable shoes, sunblock and water.  Hat would be nice preparation as well!"
22,Hidden Gem,"A must visit place if you want to see what the old China look like. Easy to reach by MTR. Ticket price is RMB 200 (adult), and half-price for children."
23,One of the few cultural areas of shenzhen,"We spent 3 hrs walking around this huge park which was really to short.. The park is an interesting collection of copies of cultural heritage of the different areas & people in China. They did also do performances on dances, stage shows etc.."
24,Excellent mini china,"Splendid China I actually did in 2 days. One day I took the little train around and saw all the major sights. I was able to get off at any of the destinations and catch the next train I saw go by. I got to see places like Guilin, The Great Wall, Beijing etc. There are mountain huts, island villages and great cities. You could rent golf carts or take a horse drawn wagon. I walked till I dropped, ate wonderful food, shopped in the market street (with amazing tourist buys cheaper than you can get in Hong Kong or Old Shekou and you can barter for prices!) The next time I went I saw the shows from each region. Even an epic war on horse back. I rather enjoyed both days. I have not done the night shows but I hear they are spectacular. There is so much to see and do that I dont think you can do it in a day. I thought it was a great way to see all of Asia and then choose where I really want to go to see the life sized version.)."
25,Wonderland ,"This is a historical amusement park. You can all day there. There is a lot to do. Good eats as well. In the many regions of the park are different times in China's history. There are a few rides but other activities include a water park, boat ride, Mongal area action show and beautiful places to see."
26,Great learning & cultural experience ,"Two parks in one, Chinese folk culture village and splendid China If you like culture and learning it is a one day parkDon't miss the middle of the parks fighting arena with warriors Also at the end of the day there is a excellent lights, dancing, dragons and Chinese culture with a fireworks ending. Excellent to enjoy. Pick your seats upon arrival to get your place"
27,Visit too Short,"Really interesting place to visit, so much to see and many photo opportunities.I recommend going on a day with nice weather and in a group if possible, but be prepared for a lot of walking.Plenty of activities to do and souvenirs to get inside.Don't miss this if you're in Shenzhen."
28,nice place to understand the Chinese culture.,"It's by far the most interesting village museum I have ever visited. You can find lots of houses and settlements from the whole China, many of them with their original interior. It's a place where you should definetely spend one day."
29,"China in 1 area,  spend whole day here. Check weather before visit. ",A typical “Shenzhen style” theme park but a nice place to walk around and have a glimpse of the many sides of different cultures and nations among the land of China. There’re plenty of trees to provide good shades though it might be pesticided from time to time (but that’s also common in most of the parks in China) and you might see occasional dead birds that haven’t been taken care of yet.
30,MINIATURE MODELS OF FAMOUS CHINA ARCHITECTURE,"Nice place to visit once. a nice collection of Chinese culture. A bit too ""Disney like"" but as said, worth checking it out.you'll need about 4-5 hours, easy walk (stroll) was not so crowded as we visited the place on a Thursday.Price: about $50"
31,Quick way to learn about the people of China ,There wasn't really much to do. You just walk around and look at the mini buildings. It's alright to take kids to though there isn't a playground or anything specifically catered to them.
32,Overpriced but recommended.,Loved it...I may a little partial because I love China. The visit to this park was a bonus.  Tiny replicas of Chinese history. The details are amazing!!!!!
33,SHORT INSIGHT INTO THE DIVERSITY OF CHINA,"It is a bit expensive on the ticket prices, but it is a big park. You can spend a few hours in there, at least taking photos and seeing some shows. Lots of replicas of ancient and pre-modern China. The horse rider show was the best. The Korean restaurant was not good in terms of taste. You can also have a tea tasting session. It may not be good to go during the summer months as the heat and humidity are beyond brutal."
34,Great activity for adults and kids ,All that you need to know about Chinese culture. The park is huge so you have to spend one day here. Make sure to watch horse show and cultural dress show. Take photo with Chinese costume will make your visit memorable!
35,Really great visit,"If you want to spend a nice afternoon, possibly with the family, this is the place. Huge park with plenty of attractions. you have to spend at least 4 hours."
36,Bring umbrella and comfy shoes ,"Be Clear - this is a theme park.  As such its great for kids, not for adults looking for culture!  Also bear in mind once in the food and drinks are expensive compared to local restaurants etc"
37,Interesting Chinese folk performances,"The model buildings and monuments were very interesting, having seen a few of them for real. The museums were also pleasant to stroll around. Highlights were the shows staged at various points of the day. Definitely worth a visit."
38,Wonderful Village trip,You might spend a whole day here because so many things you can see. and it is deserved. I with my tour guide come here to relax and see the Chinese cultures when I am free. With an English tour guide is much easy to understand the cultures because you can ask him to explain.
39,Good place to visit,"Maintaining is not so good , as long u stay at least 30 Meter from the object it’s OK. Once u getting closer u can see it’s simple and cheap maintained or even just not anymore. It has been really nice , but it’s falling apart ..."
40,a good place,"This is actually two parks. One with lots of miniatures, the other with the culture shows and buildings. Whilst the miniatures were certainly pretty impressive, our youngsters got bored fairly quickly and no matter how many great facts we found out, (the Great wall model is made from 6 and a half million bricks!) we quickly moved on to the culture park. There are some impressive buildings in the culture park and worth a few hours walking around. Make sure you don't miss the Horse Battle at 3:00. This is a stunt show with Mongol warriors, explosions and horse stunts, absoultuely fantastic, similar in scale and production to any Universal Studio show.The 5 'oclock cultural fashion show is also well worth watching, not as boring as it sounds and a well choregraphed show with some unique pieces you won't see anywhere else, such as 17 live peacocks on stage, some of them balanced on top of ladies in impressive regal looking outfits.Unfortunately didn't get to see the evening show.One thing to note. Avoid the two weeks around Easter as this seems to be when all the schools visit all of the sites in Shenzehn. We watched one smaller show with about 600 school kids... quite the experience, if noise is not your thing, then avoid this time at any attraction."
41,very big,"You need a full day and evening to walk around and enjoy this beautiful and interesting park of miniatures. Not everything is tiny least of all the free evening show. I wasn't expecting much for free but decided to wait and collect the free tickets on offer after a lovely day walking around the park. I was amazed at the technical level of the stage, pyrotechnics and performers. Seat numbers seamed to mean nothing however so choose a nice spot and keep it. My friend and I watched one couple move seats 10 times before the show started. A lot of other people moved around a lot too. Well worth the ticket price. I have been twice now."
42,theme park with a difference--Culture of minority races come alive at this park,"This a a great place for tourists and residents who want to escape the city for a little bit. Costs about 200rmb to enter, but that includes the China Folk Villages. Make sure you have at least 4 hours to spend there, there is a lot to see! Miniature villages, outdoor art, botanical gardens, local artisans. Easily accessible by subway."
43,Terrible enclosures for captive monkeys,Nice place to visit with all the family members or friends or any one who like to see the old china art and culture
44,A place you should not missed,"If anyone tells you that you don't need more than 2 days in Shenzhen it is very likely they haven't been to the Chinese Folk village. Same as I was told Shenzhen is small and casual by a person who did not visit this spectacular never ending village.- I didn't have a map but everyone else did, which might have been easier to know where i'm going but at the end of that day I realised I covered it all.- If you are China freaks like me but unable to travel everywhere in China this place is for you. A human sized elements taken from famous locations in China. - I walked approx 18KM that day, If you don't wanna walk you can get a buggy and just drive around. There also a cool cable tray you can take to go from one side of the river to another. - Along the way you can buy anything Chinese from selfie sticks to fans, jewelries and traditional clothes. - There are lots of shows that you don't wanna miss out.- Highly recommended for kids and adults as one! Amazing experience."
45,A wierd experience,I am not quite impress with this place. The place is also quite old. The ticket is quite expensive for a visit.
46,"Must see in Shenzen, allocate a few hours, preferably day & night, to see China folk cultural village & Splendid China","The park is a little dated and I had been there many years ago when it was new. It provides a fascinating view of China's cultural and racial diversity, not obvious to many foreigners."
47,Interesting ,"This park Is so big. You can choose the train to go around the park.  You need only a day to go around the world. From Asia, Africa, America and even Europe. Find the perfect spot for your photos as if you were there. If you want to see this park in 360 degree, go to the ""Eiffel Shenzhen Tower"". Feel the sensation to be in narrow tall tower and spectacular view not only the park but also HK in a distance. Bringing an umbrella, hat and sunglasses is a must during the summer. Don't miss their spectacular performance too. It starts at 7pm. Some food stalls and restaurants are also available there"
48,Unique experience,Two parks in one. Interesting to wander around. The miniature side is easier to navigate. Great photo opportunities of the replica sites across china.
49,Snapshot of china attractions and its different minority tribes,its a very big park.  I suggest you spend 1 or 2 hrs at the miniature park and the rest of the time at the cultural village.  There are lots of performance at the cultural village thru out the day.  Don't miss the 3D movie.
50,Very cool place,A good broad overview of the Chinese provinces. Just enough to make you realize there is a lot to see in each area.
51,Better come early before the show,"Most people don't know about this place and it is definitely one of the must sees when in Shenzhen. The park offers great opportunity to immerse in Chinese culture without travelling through China. The exhibits are well done, the ground is spacious with electric bikes and shuttles on offer to make the coverage easier and more convenient. The grounds offer food and refreshment facilities and public toilets. The park further offers many spectacular shows, in the very Chinese 'more is more' theme. Do go to visit."
52,Quick run through of... China!,"Shenzhen has a lot to see and do, so it is hard to pick and choose, but I think this is one of the top choices."
53,Nice View and Family Tour,"The horse exhibitions and the shows of the Chinese village is interesting and amazing, but they are the same every time I go. Hope to see new elements in the shows"
54,I window into China,"While some things in China seem like a gimmick, you will truly walk away learning more about the Chinese Culture and will appreciate China more. I went on a whim with some friends and we all highly enjoyed our time. You’re able to see what living with each cultural minority would be like as well as see clothing, their culture, and religion. I suggest going earlier in the day to catch the cultural performances."
55,A Must see and take the monorail to see amazing city views,A good site that you can spend 1/2 day at. There are regular buggies hop on hop off and the exhibits are good with adequate explanation in Chinese and English
56,"Splendid China, splendid park",great and splendid performance and quite a feast to the eyes with beautiful costumes and props. Does not get boring as the stage is changed many times throughout the stage performance. Highly recommended.
57,An Annoying Visit!,"You get a good overview of China's history and culture, but do plan to walk around a lot. Very well maintained and one can easily spend 4-5 hours here. Then cross the road and head to OCT Loft ;)"
58,Tranquil...,"very nice place in Nanshan district, a bit too crowded but we had a chance to see everything. I was particulary impressed by the the miniature of Great Wall of China.They also have Chinese Opera show and many places for street food.Overall was a positve experience spent with my family."
59,A wonderful show,"Visited here prior to departing Shenzhen, interesting and you can fill 2-3 hours in quite easily. Limited places to eat however."
60,"An incredible, informative, large Park.",It's a huge park I advise you to take an inital tour with the electric train. There are many shows and things to try. It will take you a day to explore .
61,China Folk Culture Village,"I really love this place. If you have visited Window of the World, this place really recommended after that. Located in the same area with Splendid China, you can get in with the same ticket (RMB 200 for both). In this area you can enjoy performance from some China's folk. Don't forget to open their website to check performance each folk."
62,A place everyone should visit,This is the place where you could learn about the people and their culture. They have several shows but for me the most interested show is the Legend of the Desert show. This park is for all ages and make sure you watch the final show.
63,Loved by the foreigners ,"This is a cheesy park, but a great to learn about China. If you are looking for a quick lesson about the different cultures this place is great."
64,Pretty but fake,"Compare to Window of the world this park is below than the previous one. However as I mentioned it's an aye opening for all things about Chinese culture.The staff even dressed & sang a cultural song for you. Nice for those really interested in local culture.The price was RMB 180, it's only cheaper by RMB 20 compare to the window of the world park.However the buggy rent a lot of cheaper than inside the window of the world."
65,Definitely worth your time to explore this unique place. Very Interesting.,It is a large area. There is a lot of walking. Not many restaurants available. Very close to the underground train station. I found the entrance fees a bit steep.
66,Cute,"I wasn’t expecting much, but this place was so beautiful, the grounds alone need a good couple of hours at least to fully enjoy. We saw two shows, the horse riding stunt show and the Chinese culture show, both very good. We also paid for a boat tour, which took about 20-25 mins and we saw a different view of the park, including a waterfall. We visited during the week and it was very quiet, I’d recommend going when it is not busy so you can really take in the beauty of this place. We found the gardens so peaceful."
67,China Folk Culture Village,"Park is so bigPlan a full day for the visit.Get to learn and know better on chinese history and culture, also the scenery is beautiful"
68,Beautiful. Explore every corner of this place,"Many attractions to have an high level view on most of the various China styles, and more. Half a day is definitively not enough"
69,A large pocket of history in one place,So picked the number 1 attraction in Shenzhen. £18 each to get in. Gardens etc are lovely but after a while it all blended into one. If you like looking at model builds and a small Great Wall then this is your bag. I just found the whole day an expensive walk. Not excited at visiting SZ second rated attraction after this oneThanks Alan
70,Cultural Village in Shenzhen ,"It's a mixture of theaters, shows, exhibitions and an amazing miniature land. Didn't really know what it was, but some nice business partners took me there. And it was amazing, specially the miniature land which is best reached by the small train. Very well made and rather big"
71,What a nice show.,"I thought it was run down, and not really worth my time because we spent only three days in Shenzhen.  It was unimpressive, maybe better when it was new to take a lot of selfies. But I wasn't a fan."
72,Good customer service ,We chose to visit Splendid China Park instead of Windows of the World as the park offers an overview of the popular sites in China. It was quite interesting to see them in miniature and  the park itself was easy to navigate .
73,China Culture in one place,"I just loved to visit these attractions. This big park has two parts. One is the Splendid China part, it contains  number of  Chinese buildings and landscapes, miniatures of every interesting building and monument in China. Thus we experienced the historical places those I may not never see in my life. We amazed to see the Great Wall as well .The Folk Cultural Villages -a very good presentation of architectural exhibits of various hill tribes/minority groups .There are several souvenir shops with beautiful Crafts.  Some shops offer photography with their costume .. it's lovely .We enjoyed two cultural shows.The whole Park is very large and photogenic, need to walk almost a day to cover. Pls go with comfortable shoes and drinking water .Been there in July, 2012."
74,Less Chinese Culture with Wonderful Show,great place to learn about culture and traditions of China. Make sure to have enough time for walking around and for splendid shows they organize. it was a big surprise that in the evening they organize water battles. it looks amazing both at night and during daylight times
75,Simply amazing place !!!,"Please shows you not only the most popular and interesting places in China. It is more than that.  The live shows are at the level of the best theaters and circuses.  You can use transportation and see everything.  On very warm days, this is a very good solution.  We'll be back there again. Amazing and an unbelievable experience."
76,A good place to learn China culture,"Exploring different cultures, learning about Chinese history and a fantastically maintained park makes Splendid China a great way to spend a day in Shenzhen"
77,Day out,"This venue has things for everyone.  From shows, to simulated fighting, and lots to see and do.  Assorted souvenirs as well as typical Chinese snacks are offered.  Gives a nice overview of a Chinese Folk Culture Village.  Very near OCT."
78,A little bit of every famous Chinese building in miniature.,I spent an afternoon earl evening here and really liked it. Lots of folklore and chinese culture. Best to go with some Chinese friends that can explain to you whats going on.
79,Disappointing,This is a good park to go to with (little) children. They will Enjoy some of the shows that take place during the day and to have a look into the houses. Part of the park has China's most famous buildings/places in miniature. I have never seen it very crowded there.
80,2nd visit to this attraction,Nice place that allows foreigners to know more about China and its culture. The Mongolian show is amazing! It is one of the places you must visit if you are in Shenzhen.
81,nice day with family,"200 RNB is too expensive for that kind of park, looks cheap and fake. I wouldn’t recommend this place to any of my friends."
82,Entrance fees a bit expensive,It's a mini china. You can witness the entire vast provinces of China in one place. Nice experience and different house and food formats available.
83,China Historical Places under A roof,a very nice park demonstrating a little bit of what China is all about. Do not take the mini electrical car because it goes very fast and you will not be able to actually see anything. Better is to walk
84,Splendid  China,"We visited 3 days in a row as there was so much to see and experience. Very enjoyable, but make sure you wear our walking shoes.  The battle of old China with horses, stunts and story was excellent and ny husband wanted to see it again . Weekdays are better, as the park is crowded on the weekend or holidays."
85,best miniature of China,This place is huge and beautiful. Put on your comfy shoes if you want to walk to the end of the park. I highly recommend you walk to the end of the park as every corner have its own miniature of China folk culture. Its Instagram worthy scenery!The culture show was fantastic and entertaining. Highly recommended for everyone to watch the show.
86,Well worth a visit,The park is indeed splendid. It's vast and one needs time to take it all in. The exhibits are very well constructed and presented. Attention to detail is evident everywhere. We enjoyed the gardens and the lake but weren't able to see any of the live shows due to time constraints. Give yourself a full day and enjoy the food too. Great candy for the sweet tooth.
87,Show all mini china most all the city ,My wife and I spent over 6 hours and still missed some of the sights here as the sun went down. Lot's of walking. A great display of the sights of China. The Terracotta Soldiers display was very cool as was the great wall. Plan on taking over 100 pics. Get there early! The food is very reasonable. We also learned the shops that sell traditional clothing will negotiate so don't take the first price offered.
88,A Place to learn Chinese Culture,"If you have been visited the Window of the world before, you will feel this attraction is just a so-so. But of course considering the entrance fee & buggy ride cheaper that the window of the world, you can understand it.For me the entrance fee RM 180 is still too expensive. The buggy will cost you RMB 60/hour.If you want to know China in detail, you can try to visit. Oh another thing all the staff will wear the traditional china costume and sing the folk song to welcome you, nice thing to see & hear"
89,"Great shows, worth the price","I am really impressed at this park. This is a theme park with a difference. IT is an educational one where one will be immersed in the myriad cultures of minority tribes from all over China. In 1/2 of the park, the splendid China park stands. There are miniaturised versions of significant monuments & landmarks from all over China. The great wall of China & the forbidden palace & Huangshan are represented in this minature park. IN the other 1/2 of the park, one can walk into recreated traditional habitats of minority races where  costumed representatives of the minority group perform daily. There are 3 major performances throughout the day. The 2 major  evening performances are a combination of acrobatics , animal performances &  ethnic dance performances. Absolutely mega dance extravanganza! If you travel to Shenzhen, be sure to dedicate 1 day to visit this park which is unique to China."
90,See the truly China,"200 rmb per person. I think kids and seniors get a discount. The park is well maintained but you will for sure see some tacky things like mountains made of plastic, but hey, you're in China.The park takes you through the many different cultures in China and shows you how they lived and live. A lot of the signs are translated to English. Shows are performed everywhere, and signs tells you when they start.Another part of the park contains a lot of miniatures of famous Chinese placed, quite nice actually. The big gardens are also very nice and well kept.3 hours is definitely enough. Water and food can be bought everywhere for reasonable prices. Toilets can be found everywhere. Remember to bring comfortable shoes and an umbrella that gives you both shade and protection from the rain."
91,Mini iconic park of China's culture,"It is not perfect but I wouldn't miss it. We hired a golf cart type of thing as we were short on time. Drove by houses and looked at how they used to live. Cute kids on school trips in uniform running around. Missed the folk shows since they are only in afternoon! There is a souvenir shop with some chinese dresses, shoes etc. Was fun!"
92,So interesting and educational,"If you have a very limited time, but you also would like to know the China people, tribes, villages, etc...in 1 place, then I HIGHLY recommend this place. It is a huge place, please prepare 1 day to go, good in morning & afternoon time. Bring also your small umbrella and drinking water."
93,What a Treat!,"If you have a very limited time, but you also would like to know the China people, tribes, villages, etc...in 1 place, then I HIGHLY recommend this place. It is a huge place, please prepare 1 day to go, good in morning & afternoon time. Bring also your small umbrella and drinking water."
94,Massive park,"If Shenzhen is the start of a longer trip through China or if you want to come back to this country and don't know where to go, then you might like to wander in Splendid China park where you'll see all the great attractions in China, in a miniature scale.It's funny otherwise but no so great. I recommend to spend more time in nearby Folk Culture Village instead."
95,A little oasis in the city,You can feel traditional chinese culture here. It takes about 2~3 hrs to look around all places. There are three or four restaurant and snack bar. You can enjoy chinese style lamb skewer!
96,Like a Chinese pioneer village,"I normally don't go in for tourist attractions, but this one is just incredible - every significant historical and cultural landmark is recreated in painstaking miniature detail - including THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA! Well worth the modest price of admission, and conveniently located about 300m from a subway line. Plan to spend about 4 hours to see it all. 一个独特而美丽的地方！"
97,See China and China Adjacent Places in One Day.....It's a Small World Afterall!!!!,"very big park, you'll learn about the Chinese culture, you must see the shows arranged at defined time, the last show is a must."
98,Splendid indeed.,"The miniatures are fun to watch if you, like us, only have a five day visa and no time to explore entire China. The other part of the park, the folk villages, felt wierd to us. It was beautiful to watch but at the same time it felt so false to see the park, for instance, promoting uigur dance shows when you just one Google - oh sorry i meant Bing - search away can se how the Chinese government really treats the uigurs..."
99,Impromptu visit whilst on business in Shenzen,"A lot of miniatures of famous Chinese buildings... I don't know even half of them. so it's was a bit boring for me. better before read of some of them, or take some Chinese who can speak English..lol... but actually all this place is amazing. U can buy tickets cheaper using special Chinese program 去哪, just downloaded it on AppleStore and u need have Chinese card. All tickets u can buy like this"
100,It's a nice place to visit ,Well worth a visit. Very close to the metro with good directions. There is a lot of walking and lots to see. The shows are excellent. Make sure you see the horse riding and don't miss out on the mask changers!The food was very traditional.
101,Worth a visit,If you visit Shenzhen and you have one day free you can go to this park to  learn a bit about chine culture. The park is very big and split for 2 sections: one about China folk culture and about the difference Tribes. The other side is like little china with all the The famous and central sites of China. Important tip- every day at evening they have a big show  very recommend. It is possible to buy ticket only to this show with out visiting the park.
102,See the whole of China in a couple of hours,I was walking past to see a friend and at first i thought it was a private residence... with a party going onas the usual party crashing world explorer i am it turned out to be a great experience during the evening... i killed my battery taking photos! Then lost the photos... well worth the trip
103,Nice way to learn about China,"…of course it is! There are miniature models of just about every major sight in China.I was in the area and decided on the spur of the moment to see this sight based only on its name. After paying my 180RMB to get in I was pretty disappointed to find myself surrounded with fake flowers. But, once I got past the initial bit, there was lots of impressive stuff to see. In fact the park is huge! Every time you think you've reached the end, there's another whole field of stuff to see.The models are very well done. I recognized sights I've seen in Beijing, Xi'an, and Nanjing; and sights I've heard about from other parts of the country.They even have The Great Wall which snakes around up and down the hills just like the real one. But the model is build of stone bricks about the same size as Lego and Lego Duplo…imagine the effort to build a 4 foot wall, at least a mile long out of Lego!"
104,must to see,"Excellent place for a bit of culture. , very well done and laid out.  With fantastic small models of Chinese history  from Great Wall of china to the palaces.Highly recommend the shows Inthe afternoon and evening.  Spectacular.."
105,Nice Park ,"Only got to go during the night time (which also means a cheaper ticket but less things to see), however I wasn't disappointed at all with all the food available, as well as the beautifully lit architecture! It is an extremely large park, with so much to see and a lot to learn about China. Definitely spend a few hours here."
106,Great park on Chinese culture & heritage,"Very short business trip and a friend suggested we visit this place.  Being able to see some of the wonders of China in miniatures was amazing, but the cultural shows, donkey carts and actors embedded were such nice touches.  Strongly suggest get a cart because it gets hot and it's a big place."
107,My favorite place in SZ,(+) : Located near the Windows of the world. It's a huge park with many different chineese culture. There's an hourly interesting show in some different places in the area. Many good restaurant choices inside the park. Subway station just in front of the gate. (-) : Too expensive
108,Huge place well worth the 30 USD,"Make sure you have at least 4 hours to spend here. It costs about 200rmb per adult. For those less able/inclined to walk, you can rent electric golf carts of various seating number to drive around. I did this with my mom, it was very comfortable. There are cultural displays, homes, costumes, shows with song and dance from many different tribes/minorities of China. It's a good overview of China, and connected to Splendid China Park, which has beautiful botanical gardens and outdoor art."
109,Appreciate,"I came here at noon and i needed 45 minutes to around this park(used train, usually train will stop at forbidden kingdom and at waterfall), then I watched a show,its long about 45 minutes.If you are not in hurry(using travel agent), i suggest you to walk around, my guide said that we will need 4 hours if you walk around this park."
110,Do not miss,"Worth visiting. Made me want to come back to china to visit the other destinations! Hire a car to have a relaxing experience, as it's a big place!"
111,Awesome,"I had strong reservations about visiting this as it has all the earmarks of a tourist trap, but I was happily proven wrong. To be sure, there are some (not many) tacky aspects to this, but the vast bulk of the attractions are quite wonderful. Especially interesting are the many outdoor recreations of various wonders of China rendered in miniature or on a smaller scale. I got lost in these as I explored the meticulous details with which the attractions were created. They range from the Great Wall to the Gorges of the Yangtze. Some of them one views from a respectful distance, and some allow one to walk through them as if one is endowed with a Godzilla-like size. It is like a collection of reduced scale movie sets. One might do well to rent a scooter or buggy so that you can traverse the great expanses of the exhibits.Also of great interest are the to-scale reproductions of housing that were to be found in various provinces of this great country. Most of the dwellings invite exploration (just be careful as the steps are sometimes (and correctly) uneven, just as they would be in reality. Don’t miss what is called the Fairy cave. There weren’t any fairies to be found but the magnificent underground cavern with its twisting paths and many stalactites and stalagmites is a delight. It was especially fun to explore it with my stepdaughter who was certain that she knew where the fairies were hiding. There is also a show of various cultural rituals, stories and dances. Particularly enthralling was the myth of the Phoenix as accompanied with a dazzling display of fog and lights.One can get plenty of exercise (and also photographs) just meandering through the park. I could have spent another few hours, and definitely want to return to see it at various times of the day and night. Best seen when not crowded — in other words, after Chinese New Year."
112,Great Park,"I have been to Splendid China many times! okay I live in Shenzhem... but I really love it! “this place including two areas (Splendid China Miniature Park & China Folk Culture Village) located in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, People's Republic of China. The park's theme reflects the history, culture, art, ancient architecture, customs and habits of various nationalities. It is one of the world's largest scenery parks in the amount of scenarios reproduced.” -google"
113,Miniature Park,"Splendid China is a must when it comes to family and friends landmark sightseeing. I've took my small kids there and they enjoyed, also took my relatives that came for a 2 weeks visit and they loved it too. I live in Shenzhen, so for me it's nothing special, since it's all fake, but all people that came to China for a short visit loved that place. Take plenty of water, maybe 1l per person, plus you will buy water inside too, maybe it is 8 yuan per bottle, umbrella is also a must. It takes all day to see everything."
114,It takes a full day,The Chinese Folk Culture Village is adjacent to Splendid China and the entrance fee is for both.We found this park more interesting as we get to know the various minorities in China.We could take as many pictures as we wanted and see how they live.
115,China Folk Cultural Village,"Upon entering Splendid,China, you will receive a brochure. This attraction is very large and actually didvide into two areas. It is important that you plan your tour around the major events or shows, so it is a good idea to sit and plan your day. This definitely is a full day event. The area to the left is a small version of the attractions in China. They are very well done and you should plan how you are going to travel through this area. The map you get at the entrance indicates how you can proceed. There are many good restaurants and take out areas to get food and drink. The area on the right when entering the attraction gives you a very good look at the many different ethnic cultures of China. Many of them have shows at different times of the day, so it is important to plan you wak through this vast area. There is a recreation of a Mongolian invasion show with horse back riding skills, etc. A must see event! The closing extravaganza is just that... should not be missed either. Don't forget your camera, as the ethnic tribes love to have you take pictures with them."
116,What a great way to learn more about China!,"This is a model village, but nothing like the ones I have visited in the UK.Set in a vast parkland area, in the middle of the city, you would never know it.The attention to detail of the model villages (plural) is wonderful to see. And there is plenty of other attractions to see also.A very enjoyable day out."
117,A great way to see China without traveling,"This place stands number 1 in my visit list to hangout with a family. In Shenzhen most of the places are suitable for youngsters,but this is an exception which suits all age groups. Remember to make a plan before you visit this place such as map, expenses, timings etc. Entrance tickect is 180rmb per person,which is worth spending for. Don't forget to collect a map at entrance which is available in English as well. This place is stupendous and takes a whole day to look around. There are numerous shows & cultural performances (details are available in the map), few shows are free to watch while few require seperate entrance fee of about 20rmb. The live horse show is very astonishing.dont miss this! Plan the shows ahead ,that you find interesting, as there will be huge crowd waiting for tickets. The entrace ticket includes price for both splendid china cultural village and miniature park,so make sure you visit the miniature park too! Its too huge, so again go through the map!! You can find a lot of souvenirs to buy. There are good places to eat and drink. Old people must remember that there's a lot of physical activity to do! Take care, u will be very tired by the end of the day!Dont go on a sunny day! If u love to click photos, its a great place to fulfill your thirst! So plan a whole day, go with a back bag and have fun!"
118,A whole day well spent,"You can easily spend the entire day here, for approx $40! The park has 2 sections, the Cultural village and Splendid China. Staff speak very little english, so you are on your own. Ask for a map at the entrance which is in English and has all the necessary information.The park open at 10:00. You will roughly spend until 15:30 covering all the different cultural villages. There are live dance shows at a lot of them and the time is on the map. They are worth it if you are interested in culture (which is why you would go here in the first place). The shows are spaced 40 min apart, and you spend the time in between looking at the various things on the way. The finale of the first half of your time here is the ""Legend of the Desert"" show, which involves live stunts, fireworks etc. and is entertaining. Almost 200 performers in this show and it goes for 30-40 min. Once this is done, you can head over to Splendid China to look at the miniatures. They are not great, i.e. not very intricate/well done, but you get a good view of the various tourist attractions around China. Once this is done head back to the village to catch the 2 other shows.The Impress China show in the theater (you have to collect tickets from the window outside due to limited seating). I dont understand art/performances as such, but the show is entertaining. Dances, some acrobats, colourful costumes etc. Again another 200 odd performers and goes for 30+ min.Last thing on the day is the performance in Phoenix Square. Again collect tickets first to gain entry. Another performance with some floats, acrobats, fireworks etc. Another show involving 200+ performers (might be common to Impress China) and goes for 45 min. And there is food all around with a hawker themed street as well. All in all, a great day spent."
119,Dated but Still Worth It,"Place to know China in miniature. Park very careful, clean and safe. the buildings are very well made. I recommend it to spend the morning on Saturday or Sunday."
120,Great day spent..,"A bit of a taxi ride to get there, but worth the effort. Beautiful gardens and sights spread over a large area. Great to walk around and spend 3 hours"
121,"Fun, entertainment and history. ",Nice day for a visit after lunch. Go for a walk to capture all the beautiful attractions in the park. Just stroll and explore.
122,Waste of time for the money that you pay,"We went there in late August, barely any crowd because of the brutal temperature.The tickets are not cheap in my opinion, it cost me a fortune with few kids.  But it’s a  good park to know lots about the country and peak into many of its signature architecture and cultures.We ate at one “food court”, one noodle dish came with rotten meat which seems a often seen issue sine I saw that from other Chinese reviews.  Other dishes are ok not too pricy compared to outside restaurants.We saw part of the big show, forgot the name, it was really impressive, loved it.Kids loved the water play festival at 3pm, lasted 1h. There’s also a zipper line over the pond which my old kids enjoyed as well.  I think one of the keys is the small crowd we had, imagine you have to wait in line for an hour for anything that would be a total killer for us. We took the boat ride and enjoyed it, also the trolley to see all the mini signature buildings, very informative, loved it too.I like the day trip there, probably won’t go back again though."
123,A place worth spending time at,"This park was quite interesting.  If you want to learn about the different peoples who are native to China, then this is a place for you.  It gives a nice overview of the people and culture.  Many shows give a small insight into the culture as well."
124,Good one,"This is a beautiful park with lots of information on Chinese history and culture all in one place.  It is easy for foreigners to visit and there is information in both English and Chinese.  There are several shady areas and walkways so even on a hot day, it is easy to get relief.  The dance show was also very good."
125,Good chance to know Chinese minority people !!!,"I'm really love this place. You don't have to travelling too much in China, but you can meet most of iconic China's city symbol here. Just get of at Overseas China Town (OCT) station, walk ahead & you will reach this place. Ticket fee is RMB 200 (bundling with China's Folk Culture Village entrance fee). There was some souvenir shop, cafes, & restaurants here. If you feels lazy to walking around, just rent small bike for two or buy train ticket."
126,"Large, but crude miniatures !!!","The Splendid China Park and Folk Culture Park is a wonderful way to be introduced to some of the major architectural attractions in China, as well some of the various cultures around the country. There are a number of performances in the Folk Park and they are an excellent introduction to the various cultures and customs. The miniaturized displays in Splendid China give you an excellent overview of some of the places you may not want to miss as you visit Mainland China. All in all a well spent 3.5 hours."
127,Excellent day out with small children ,"Well,when my visit this beautiful place ended,because everything closed about 21:00, I can honestly said, that I have been sad.This place is realy amazing.I spend there all afternoon and evening,and I realy enjoy everything.You can see there some beautiful chinese show and entertaiment.This day was very hot,and I wanted go away about 18:00,but my chinese friend said, stay here one more hours,and we will go for last best show,which started every day in 19:00. I'm very happy now,that I was go there,because this show was amazing! I never see in my life something so beautiful.When I come back from Shenzhen,I find this show on youtube,and I see her again maybe 20 times.Really amazing place!"
128,Perfect place to know more about the Chinese,"I was in the park from 12 to 8 pm and I felt the time was the best I spent with my family, I wish I have another dayton explore. The Miniature section has aroused my interest to visit china of course the landmarks in beijing like great wall, summer palace, temple of heaven are amazing replica, I was far excited by seeing the patolla palace, the various landscapes of yunnan province the landscapes in Guangzhou were further delights. There was hardly a moment without thrill after the miniature section the other side has the cultural village section. We went to the various tribal houses, there is no restrictions to sit or relax in these houses. No restriction on taking photographs no information desks anywhere as well, however directional maps are there at appropriate places. The best part were the various cultural shows at phoenix square at 7pm, impression theatre 4pm? the horse back war 3pm. The first thing to start i did was take the bus ride of the whole complex to get an overview thereafter things just fell in line. Notably each of the show has a separate fees ranging 20 to 40 CNY, the fees didn't pinch me after the quality and value I got. we enjoyed the various eateries and found the food cheap as compared to Hong Kong where we live, we could eat a meal for CNY 40."
129,Must visit in Shenzhen,"Splendid park is a beautiful park , fee for entrance is a little high , 200 RMB per person , but it worth it for once to visit , park is very big and for visit all over it you will need 4-5 hours ."
130,Awesome way to learn about the diversity in the cultures of China’s 56 ethnic groups,The area is vast and clean. There are plenty of attractions and buildings. The actors play their part well. They even got a zip line and it's free (but you can't be fat because weight limit is small).However it's all fake. It's a Disneyland of sorts that it supposed to give tourists the Chinese culture the way they've always imagined it. If you can be ignorant to this you will have a great time because gardens are beautiful but if you are looking for something true and authentic look elsewhere. Not my cup of tea.
131,Quick way to get an understanding of how amazing China is,"The Folk Culture Village has been superbly and I would think authentically designed. Wear comfortable shoes if you wish to explore it thoroughly.  As one walks around there are various entertainers that one can stop to watch, ranging from balancing artists to puppet shows. The absolute highlight was the two cultural shows we attended. One show demonstrated amazing costumes and colorful symbolic dresses. The operatic type music was powerful yet beautiful.  The second show re-enacted what I think was the Genghis Khan battle, along with fireworks, bangs, fires, horses, lambs and various machinery.  Felt totally awestruck. It’s performed in Chinese, with minimal English prompts on two large screens. I did feel that I left with a greater understanding of some of China’s rich history and cultural diversity. The gymnastic acumen of both men and women during both shows was mind boggling. The only downside was the use of live animals including horses, peacocks and lambs. We did not eat there, so I am unable to comment on the food. There was a large variety available though, ranging from street vendor type foods to various restaurants."
132,Not worthy the price,"We went on a Wednesday in mid-May when there was a very light crowd which I’m sure added to our delight.  We got there before it opened and stay until they kicked us out after the last show, and there was still a lot we did not see, so we went a second full day.  We saw maybe half in one day, and it was worth it to us to pay admission again for a second day.  Splendid China is (I assume) the miniatures part of the site, which was very interesting for the first couple of hours, but there are so many, many, many…  The China Folk Village was the most interesting to me; we spent most of the time on that side.  The only negative was the food which was expensive and not that great."
133,A day trip round China,"I found this really interesting for finding out about the culture and history of China and it's people.  Definitely worth the the effort.  The show in the evening is meant to be a great finale but I was too tired by that time.  Make sure you check out the various shows...even in Mandarin, they are still entertaining!"
134,A good way to see China in one day,"Spendid China is a great place to visit to see a miniature representation of the major sights in China. Located in Shenzhen in a ""park-like"" setting, it is a great place to take children that enjoy the outdoors while enjoying seeing China's sights."
135,Maybe it was a little worn but we liked it anyhow,A park near Window of the world and Splendid China and Happy Valley. Plenty of shows from different Chinese ethnic groups.
136,This little world is falling apart ...,"you can see many differet folks cultures there, and inside is very big, you will spend a lot of time inside."
137,Fun place to gain knowledge ,It's a nice way to learn Chinese culture. I recommend you to spend a day here in Splendid of China. There're many shows and activities that you should see once when you are in Shenzhen.
138,Enjoyable day,"Great to visit with family. It's a nice way to learn Chinese culture. I recommend to spend a day here in Splendid of China and many shows and activities that you should see in Shenzhen. display of the Great Wall, Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Terracotta Army, Stone Forest, Confucian Temple and 70 plus others"
139,Nice place to meet china,"This large property provides an opportunity for family and friends to enjoy ""a day in the park"" while seeing some of China's landmarks in miniature. The creators have done a splendid job. Excellent replicas of buildings and nature. The gardens are manicured and clean. Food stalls were great fun offering a variety from basic meals to exotic candy. The live shows, especially the battle arena are great. Give yourself a full day."
140,Amazing Attraction ,"We watched the Uighur and Tibetan dancing, but didn't see the other places that had performances.  The Uighur women invited people in the audience to learn the dance and a lot of us joined in.  Both groups posed for pictures if audience members wanted them to.  20 years ago, when I think this was a relative new place, there were lots of acts and explanations in both Chinese and English and the schedule of the performances was clearer.  I guess before I returned, I would want to get a schedule of which minority groups were performing, with a map of where they were."
141,Attractive,A condensed view of old and new China and well worth a visit. If over 65 years then you can get free entry as long as you can prove age. Take your passport.
142,A walk of an overview of China,"It is interesting walking around the park and looking at the miniature landmarks and ethnographic displays from across China, but the highlight has to be the incredible performance, which showcases the various cultures from across China.  The music, choreography, stage design, and costumes are all incredible; aside from the fact that there are some truly gifted acrobats and dancers."
143,"Two Parks in On - Cultural Park, Folk Village","inside the park is huge, you will see a lot of different cultures of China here, it is a nice place!"
144,A Pleasant Tourist Park,Really nice place for days outing. Tickets are 180RMB. Lots of restaurants inside the park. To avoid crowds come early. Don't miss the horses war show and the last show in the theatre.
145,Splendid afternoon,"Like the world attraction next door, this is a culture park showing chinese culture in full scale and with models. Some of the models need a bit of TLC but the place is much better maintained than its next door neighbor.  Allow 2+ hours to walk through and make the time for the show in the evening. We unfortunately missed it but our Guide said it was quite good.   Would absolutely go back and take it all in."
146,Nice park,The park offers a good glimpse of Chinese diversity. The show with horse-riding was fun to watch (but note when planning your visit that most shows take place in the afternoon). Note that the park is quite vast. Conveniently there is a metro station right by the entrance of the park.
147,Cultural Park,"This theme park offers some shows to watch. I watched the night show. It was a theatrical performance full of dances and acrobatics. The place was semi outdoor and amphitheater style, so your view would be blocked if someone stand up or walk in front of you. It was kind of annoying to see bunch of people taking other people seats despite they already know that those seats belong to someone else. No staffs will lead you to your seat, so make sure to come before the show begins or you will be that annoying person who block everyone's view.The performance was cool. However, it was hard to enjoy because there were too much different things going on the stage. At certain point, I didnt get which one is the main event and which one is the background."
148,Nice park showing China culture and history - nice shady areas,"It's just a park with mini cultural show from every tribe lives in China.Some has a good show, such as Li Tribe and Liao Tribe show.Unfortunately, the one show that I want to see (Horseback riding show) is already over and not showed anymore.It's just a station away from Window of the World. Only visit this when you have spare time on your travelling schedule."
149,This magnificent never ending Folk resort will show you everything you wanted to see in China,This park is a AAA-attraction in the Shenzhen area. Well made and maintained. Attractive shows giving the visitor and insight into Chinese culture
150,Best memory of Shenzhen,"During the very hot Sunday noon, I almost give up to go back the hotel luckily they have a train service to running around. We decided to stay longer and unbelievable we went back at 9 pm. Recommend to whom would like to know what the highlight China have in their huge country. The design and landscape they did is amazing and look real in that moment I would like to be a person in those small palace 🤗 I totally fall in love this place if I have a chance I will come back during winter time and enjoy walking and take photo again."
151,Nice park to get a glimpse of China,"I wanted to visit somewhere in Shenzhen that would get me out of the hotel and see some Chinese culture.  The Splendid China park was a good visit.  I enjoyed walking through and seeing the nice landscaping and all of the miniatures.  After a while, I felt like once you seen a few of them, they kind of all look alike.  We probably strolled through for an hour, then made our way over the Folk Culture Center on the other side of the park.  The park was Cash Only and about $25US or 160RMB and we had to navigate through with no one speaking english, but that was part of the fun and experience.  The price is really for two parks in one, not just the Splendid China miniatures.  The Folk Culture side was more enjoyable for me because there were life sized Chinese architected buildings that you might expect to see in China.  I heard the shows were really good, like the Horse Battle and Dress Show, but they cost a little extra and we missed the showtimes and couldn't get in late.  Overall, I was glad I went and got to see some of the Chinese Culture and got to watch how Chinese families interact with each other when out at a theme park.  It was nice.  We probably spend 3 to 4 hours there.  It was good for adult party, but I think my kids might have been bored after a couple of hours, unless we got in the shows."
152,Excellent park lots to see and do Lots of Fresh fruits and fresh coconuts,"Entrance fee to the place is 220rmb for adults and additional of 30rmb if u want to take the unlimited train rides inside the park. A good inclusion 40 rmb if ferry ride included. Many shows but some are not scheduled to perform, not sure why. Need lots of walking and not wheelchair friendly as it has many many stairway and rocky places. Lack of signage and staff to advise public for queries , maybe becos place is too big but educational trip, eye opener to China’s vast tribes and religion."
153,incredible park with historical themes,My daughter loved it but was more excited about window of tge world. Then again maybe it was because we got here after WOTW and were already exhausted. Get a golf cart that way if it rains you have a roof.
154,Around the world in A day,"China folk culture village is nice, there are a lot of things to see and in the evening they have cool shows.  It’s fun for 1 time, just a little bit overpriced."
155,Educational attraction with a lot of photos oppoturnity,"I wanted to visit somewhere in Shenzhen that would get me out of the hotel and see some Chinese culture.

157,Interesting,I highly recommend this theme park rather than splendid China.   I learn a lot about the minority folk cultures. I like the performance.
158,Looking for a day trip to discover China's wonders ? Come here,"If you want to explore the Chinese culture and history and you don't have the time or the resources, this will be a good place to go. Even for inspiration to see the real thing. Make sure you stay for the evening show, it's part of the entry ticket so no need to pay any extra, you just need a ticket for the seat number. The show is one of the best I have seen, if not the best. No expense spared. The pyro technique is just amazing, the costumes, everything is just so well done. It is the very best thing you could see in this place. If you miss it you've missed out."
159,A 'Must See' tourist spot in Shenzhen,"This is by no means an affordable attraction, and, in my opinion, not worth going to. The only thing I learned was that there are many beautiful natural attractions and historial buildings in China that I would rather visit in person, than view them through the miniature structures built in Splendid China. If the entrance fee was cheaper, it would be a good day out for families but it's simply too expensive."
160,Taste of China,"My tour leader ask us to show our passport to enter this site (don't know why but it's okay). Entering this site is amazing. It is located near Windows of the World. You can see mini Great Wall, Forbiden City, and even experience walking in a old chinese village. Food stalls are good and cheap (they only accept RMB). Here we were demonstrate an artist who cut your silhoutte from paper in just less than 5 minutes (you can buy this and frame it at home). We also watch Splendid China Show which is a must if you visit this site. It is well prepared with horse, dancing, acrobatics,and so on."
161,A must stop,It´s amazing how much china have to offer. It´s wonderful to experiment all the culture and way of living diferente ethnics groups in China. But this experience could be even better if in the main shows or  during the presentations (almost of them with no fee) could be explain in other languages. Outside mainland china tourists also are interested and get new knowledge of the way of living in China. If they improve this aspect this is 5 stars experience
162,China I love u,"If you visit Window of the world, you will see all landmarks of the world in one place. If you are visiting Splendid China Park, you are visiting all china in one place. it's very beautiful and I loved this place. Do not miss it!"
163,Great place to learn about China,What impressed us was the information centre had someone who not only spoke English but could also give helpful tips about the experience. You are able to hirer an English speaking guide and motorised car which can speed up the day as it is a huge area to explore. Be aware that there are extra expenses for other attractions when inside. Different experience and enjoyed.
164,"So big, so nice. China in miniature.","Perfect place to get more knowledge about China. You can see the miniature of many interesting places in China. I find it much more interesting than the other attraction nearby, the Windows of the World."
165,An absolute must-see!,Second time visiting Splendid China. The shows give you perspective on the cultural history of China.
166,Miniature China,Went on my day off. It's 180元 and they  don't take cards at the window. They have shows to see about different parts of China. Also different style of homes to see how China is different. Worth the money and time.
167,An educational preview of main tourist attractions in the whole of China,"I learned so much about the 5 different folk tribes in china during the tour.  This park was a delightful respite from the concrete landscape we've been exposed to for 2 weeks.  Loved learning about the traditions, old ways, fabulous customs and Costumes.  Most importantly, we danced, sang, walked, road the carriages, and best of all had tea at various tea houses.  Ahhh, so lovely to have tea of all sorts anytime.  You can also buy various authentic souvenirs that wasn't cheaply made--quality with a bit of class."
168,Must see in Shenzhen,"It' like a big beautiful garden around a lake, one side is dedicated to the minor ethnic people living in china the other side is a place with the most important China's sites in miniature.I would evaluates as 5 star for the Folk Cultural village and maybe 3-4 for the miniatures side"
169,A wonderful place – a must see!,"The city is only 30 years old (the high risers, etc.).  This is the high tech (silicon valley) of China.  Therefore, if you are looking for the ""City in the Sky"", this is it.  They have more skyscrapers than all of of the cities in the U.S.  It is well designed and for the young and rich.  This city is not for children or families with children because of the logistics of traveling ---crowded freeways and not to many parks for children to play and relax.  Everyone works hard and things are very expensive for the foreigners.  Be prepared for crazy driving in the freeways.  This city is very clean and brand new!"
170,Culture,"Don’t come here if you’re against animal captivity. The park is huge, but there’s one little area, tucked away near a weird hippo statue, where there are some truly horrible animal enclosures. Are there any standards you have to pass to be able to keep monkeys? Because this would not pass.The monkey enclosure is small and entirely exposed to the elements. There are no shelters or places for the monkeys to hide from people or from bad weather. The ground in the enclosure is all dirt. There’s not a single green plant inside the enclosure. The only plants the monkeys have access to are the parts of the tree branches that the enclosure is built around, but the netting hangs so low that it doesn’t actually encompass any of the foliage from the trees. The monkeys have no plants and no surfaces to walk on rather than dirt. There’s no significant water source inside the enclosure. All I saw was a water bowl that, if it had water in it at all, had very little water. The monkey enclosure does not have a jungle gym or any toys for the monkeys to play and be active during the day. They have no stimuli inside their enclosure. The monkey enclosure does not have a rail to keep people away at a safe distance. The entire enclosure is made of metal netting, and little human fingers can very easily reach through the netting, especially when there are no railings to keep people back.I also saw an enclosure for what I think were capybaras. It was cold and they were all huddled together in a circle because they also have no shelter. They have nowhere to hide from the cold, nowhere to go to get warm. Capybaras are native to South America and are likely not suited to handle cold winter temperatures in China. Moreover, they are considered “semi aquatic” but I did not see any significant water source in their enclosure either.There is no need to keep captive animals here. Nobody was even paying attention to the animals because there are so many other things happening at the park. Stop the animal captivity. Release the animals that can be released back into the wild and find better homes for the animals that cannot. Keeping these animals is not helping to bring in more business."
171,Worth a Visit-,"I am personally a fan of the Asian cultures and Splendid gives a great insight in what is or has been important for China and what is part of its culture. The park is quite big, so if you would like to see everything, make sure you have the whole day and energy to walk around. The miniature monumental were the best in my opinion and as I have been to some of the places, it was really interesting to see this again. Unfortunately, one of us got ill and therefore we were not able to see any shows. Would have loved that tho! I think this is one of the better things to do when in Shenzhen."
172,Good place to learn about china,We went to this park during the day . Very hot so not so many people. Water park not open till 5 pm so if you had kids no good. Zip wire was shut. The man was very rude as people were queuing up but he wasn’t doing the ride for some reason. The walk around the village is pleasant with many shows of the minority groups. The horse show might be good for children but otherwise not worth seeing. Full of action but poor acting in some cases. All in Chinese. The other two shows were worth going to for the costumes and lighting. The tiny sculpture town is really worth seeing along with the gardens. The miniature Great Wall with its soldiers the forbidden city with all its characters was great to see. I prefer this over the windows of the world which was a little run down.
173,Worthwhile stop,"Don't scrimp on this visit. Allow yourself a full day. I started at 10 and spent the morning in Splendid China. A great introduction to the most famous buildings & places in China in miniature, in a setting of ponds, flowers, shrubs, trees and a lot of bird life plus some butterflies. In the Cultural village there are lots of traditional buildings, 8 short 15 minute cultural displays to see and if that's not enough the highlight is 3 X 1 hour shows- Legend of the Desert ( acrobatic horse riding and fight scenes from Chinese history) at 3 pm, The Oriental Apparel Show ( Costume dance & acrobatics from the different cultures) at 5 pm and the finale  is the Dragon & Phoenix Dance (Costume dance, pyrotechnics, acrobatics) which is absolutely spectacular, at 7 pm. A ticket for the day is 200 RMB  but well worth it if you see most of it. I bought a ticket for the hop on hop off bus but didn't use it much as there was only 1 midpoint stop off in each of the 2 sections. There are plenty of food & drink stalls and the prices are reasonable. You can even sample food from different areas of China."
174,Amazing place to be!  Put it on your must visit list.,China Folk Culture Village is definitely the most relevant attraction for tourists in Shenzhen along with the window of the world. This place is great for those who love traveling around China like me. Visitors can find all the best places to visit in China in just one huge area. My visit has helped me understand better what places I still aim to visit. All the most important Chinese temples and palaces have been miniaturized in a very meticulous way. Most of them look impressive. The park is huge and kept in immaculate conditions. During the day there are also several shows on display. I got the chance to enjoy two of them. They were both carried out by minority group performers. More precisely from Hainan and the other show was a typical dance performed presumably by Shinjiang dancers. Both shows were very entertaining. For sure there are many others on schedule. This is why I recommend visitors getting some info about the schedule at the entrance. Getting to China Folk Culture Village is pretty easy. Just catch the metro (green line) and get off at OCT. From there it is less than five minutes on foot. The only flaw was the price ticket. I honestly think 200 RMB is kinda overpriced.
175,Worth to see,"This was a very fun and memorable visit! We spent the whole day in this park, wandering from one theme area to another, watching all the shows and making many funny pics. The park offers a great variety of locations devoted to every ethnicity or ethnical area of China, and also gives a historical overview of them. There are locations of the shows that represent the ethnicity in a theatrical way, with songs and dancing and tricks. I suggest you go there in the morning before 12 AM, so that you can plan ahead the visit of the shows(they will give you the map and the schedule)."
176,Please improve information in other languages,After going window of the world. I didnt have time for splendid china. So we took anothrr day from guangzhou rail to shenzhen to see this attraction. The attractions were not so huge as windows of the world. But the miniatures were very very detailed and they are damn beautiful. Worth the visit. But walking around with infant was definietly not easy. Nearest mrt was OCT.
177,Best way to plan your travel to china,"As i wrote in my previous review Nanshan District itself too beautiful to visit while visiting Shenzhen, This Chinese folk culture village is one of the best place and MUST SEE place while visit at Shenzhen, here you can see entire history of china under one roof, Chinese cultural dances, Ancient Chinese warriors, fights, the way of living! everything! even you can have good dine options though again not much choice for vegetarians! Worth to visit"
178,Good,I go to this place 2 times and enjoy the shows here.Actually in the past they have 3 shows.Horse show (now is closed already)The rest is indoor show and outdoor show (action)Only 1 big restaurant inside the village.
179,fun place to spend a day in Shenzhen,"First off all Nanshan itself is beautiful district of Shenzhen city and this park is amazing,though you need to have atleast 3 hours time to visit this place properly though it's totally worth it if you are history lover or not! this miniatures are superb preciously made that it'll make you feel real ! awesome place to visit if you are in transit through fairy to Macau or Honkong International Airport it's beautiful place to visit if you have extra time!"
180,Don't visit when its raining,This park was well done and very informative.  We had the VIP experience with driver and it was worth the money.  She explained all of the exhibits and their significance.  It was a great overview and afterwards were walked around on our own to revisit those areas we found most interesting
181,Great Visit,This was our second visit and frankly this one was better.  We hired one of the electric cars (or you can go in a group in a larger driven vehicle) to see this rather large place. Pick an Asian country and it is represented.  Bring your passport and the entry is free for aged visitors.   Took a lot of photos because there was so much to remember.
182,Enjoyed the Folk Cultural Villages,"After I visit this park, I found out I quite love to the China cultures, all the performances are very nice and attractive. Like this place very much."
183,Good Visit,There are many mini-cultural villages in the park with various performances throughout the day. A train goes around the park quite often so getting the train pass is pretty worth it. It is nice to view the various 'traditional' buildings but it is definitely commercialised and packaged in a nice way. This would make a good family day trip.
184,Good place where you can know more about China and its culture,Enjoying their dance performance booth  indoor and  outdoor. The dancer work really good and almost perfect. Minus the strict seating arrangement. People move the seat during the show up to they want without any control and this is something disturbing and really annoy for other visitor.
185,"It's fake, it's all fake…","I  visited this cultural village in 2006.  It was amazing then and highlighted the ethnic ""minorities"" in China.  A worthwhile visit if you are in Shenzen.  An interesting fact is that the Govt of China are encouraging ""minority"" ethnicities to increase their populations."
186,Famous Chinese buildings ,"Just beside window of the world you can find this beautiful, amazing Open avea. If you are in time. there will be some show.. In top five of city"
187,Really nice place,"It is an impressive overall, and the cultural show that covers various regions of china and express them in dancing is very worth watching"
188,Run down,"As the world modernized, travelers don't want to see the same concrete jungle from different places. We would like to explore nature, arts, culture and heritage. The Splendid China and Folk Cultural Village is one best place in Shenzhen, China. Not only that you would be able to explore some of the best tourist spots of China. You will also experience the culture of the different minorities. There are also 3 fantastic cultural shows that you will certainly enjoy."
189,Touristy but a must see!,"If you are visiting China the first time and wish to have a miniature overview of all the most famous man-made historical constructions and buildings in China, you will be delighted by this park. The park is huge. You can walk if you have time, or just paying 40 yuan to ride on a tram for a quick tour of the park. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by its high entertaining and educational value."
190,Perfect for a day out!,"I’m negative by nature, but I have nothing but pleasant feelings about Splendid China.  Clean, nice, friendly.  An an amazing entertainment value. Especially so if you’re as ancient as I am.  One word : Half_Price"
191,Good performance and talented dancer,"Dont miss the shows, especially the horse battle field.  Costumes, music, acrobatics and theater round out a perfect introduction to Chinese culture.  Nice souvenirs and a beautiful park."
192,Great family day out,"We were impressed with the detail put into all the miniatures. You can leisurely walk though the park without pressure to move on. There is a main path with many small trails to walk through to see all the exhibits. The only negative was it was pretty expensive compared to other activities in China. It is 200 RMB for a ticket. Kids under 1.5 meters are half price. Seniors (65+) are have price, but must have an ID that proves their age."
193,it was ok,"Oriental Dress Show, It is a gorgeous dancing show demonstrating 350 different folk costumes.A must place to visit while in Shenzhen !!!"
194,Amazing Chinese custom shows sing& dance,"Family ,friends or group of people for tour can be arrange. Whatsapp 61276397 for 1 day tour.Awesome places .All tye main sight seeing in china can see in this place."
195,Awesome place to visit,"Well worth of a visit especially for visitors to China. Here you get to see various samples of the huge number of ethnic groups and their culture. Mostly display of their song and dance.   Unfortunately it was a rainy day with a number of storms, quite a number of shows were cancelled.  The 5pm showcase is well worth the wait. Also one gets to see a mini version of the great Wall of China plus the palaces and many other historical replica of sites.  Plenty of eateries in the site."
196,An overview of China,"It's the sister park to Shenzhen's Window of the World. It shows miniatures of all the types of Chinese Architecture from History. It's a very large park so take plenty of water with you. The park also offers other attraction such as a horse show, a karate show and tradition Chinese dances. It's a fun day for everyone."
197,Fun very Chinese Experience,"This was a fabulous day in a beautiful park which showcases the ethnic village diversity of China.  The entrance fee includes admission to all the shows, the horse battleground, the folklore apparel show and a spectacular finale, the dragon phoenix acrobatics, special effects, costumes, dance, opera, song, etc. etc.  Don't miss the really great 39 yuan buffet with over fifty choices from all regions of China.  I took the train around the park which is an all-day 30 yuan ticket extra to see everything.  You have got to go.  It is superb!  Fun, interesting, educational and jam-packed with things to see and do.  A great day out.  Splendid!"
198,What an amazing place!,"Near ""Window to the World"" which take your around the most famous sites around the world, ""Splendid China"" do the same for China. It also include ""China Folk Cultural Village"". Take the whole day to really experiance the place."
199,Fun visit ,"I will recommend visit this place during within or winter. I was here last month, a lot of mosquitoes especially summer season , I strongly recommended bring mosquito repellent along during summer."
200,Knowing CHINA in a Glance!,"After checking into the hotel, we'll go directly to China Folk Culture Village and Splendid China. Is a concentrated Chinese, That's lovely! Chinese drama performance is very good!"
201,Instant CHINA in a glance!,"I have decided to pay the 200 Yuan since my expectations about the park were extremely high after having read all the positive reviews.However, I would never go back.The place is amazingly clean and it’s interesting to see how the most famous monuments and buildings have been miniaturized, but at the same time, everything is so fake.Maybe it’s just me who would rather go to the place and see it directly, but I did not have a good impression at all.What is more, as a tourist, I was expecting the staff from the restaurants and the attractions to speak English, but just a very few people could understand me.It was very disappointing!"
202,Worth it just for the show...,"This place is underrated in my opinion. Unlike elsewhere in China, almost noone comes here which lends itself to relaxing walk through the wonders of China. The exhibits are very well done, many shows take place throughout the day and food and drink facilities are available. You can hire electric cart or take a shuttle to cut on the walking. Well worth the visit and do make sure you watch some of the shows."
203,Culture for the whole family,I spent close to three hours going through the museum park. I enjoyed learning more about China’s many ethnic minorities and looking at the fields and fields of displays. Pay close attention to the map so as to organize your visit and to ensure you see everything you want. It is a great way to learn what has built up over the years and contributed to present day China.
204,Must see.,I went here with a friend and was pleasantly surprised by how much I learned about China and it's different ethnic minorities.
205,Put on your walking shoes,"We only had a short time to spend in the park, as we were in between 2 business meetings, and I could have easily spend all day there.  There is a lot to see!  We saw the main show and it was everything I wanted with acrobatics, beautiful dancing women, and even live animals.  It's a nice introduction to the many different tribes in China and had so many beautiful ""Kodak moments"" for picture taking.  Next time I'm insisting we can spend more time there!"
206,Walk and enjoy shows.,"Please see my comprehensive write up on splendid china, folk culture village is integral part of splendid china and is to be seen with it."
207,Interesting overview of China in a microcosm!,"Interesting park to learn and see the China minority tribes and buildings.  The miniature China scale buildings gives you insight of the many historic sites around China.  Keep an eye on the many shows and performance thru out day mainly the 3pm Tibet with horses, 5pm dancings and 7.30pm theatre.  The stages, props and costumes are amazing.  Very easy to spend 4 to 6 hours and easy access from train."
208,Great but the same shows every time I go,"A must-see while in Shenzhen. It provides you with an overview of the different regions and cultures within China.The recreations are beautiful.I only saw the village at night, but would definitely recommend you go during the day and the night as some sights can't be viewed at night, and some look gorgeous lit up at night.It's a lot ground to cover so bring good walking shoes. The tour carts/bus was not available on the day we went.We never attended any shows (it's tricky with a 2 year old), but they were recommended by others. (additional costs for the shows) Some of the information boards could be more descriptive.In summary, interesting, informative and beautiful. Needs around 2-3 hours"
209,A fabulous day out!,"I been there with my family, that time very hot weather, but enough with the show for Chinese traditional dress up, and also we can take foto with the custom,pay rmb 100  for 3 foto inside the park..."
210,Wonderful village museum,This village was brilliantly done. An Oasis. Lots of walking so be prepared. But every single step was worth it. You can see all of China in one place but take at least two days to see it all properly.
211,Not a must see,"I went to this theme park with my group of 9 year old students. It was great to show them miniatures of some of the major important structures in China. We had been studying Ancient China and it was great to see the places recreated and be able to see something in 3 dimensions. I enjoyed the miniature portion of the park. The other side of the park has information about the many different cultures that make up China today. It was interesting to see different ways people live. This side also has shows but the only show we saw, about Tibet, was not very good. It was too loud, completely in Chinese with no subtitles anywhere (not all my students know enough Chinese for this to be interesting), and it seemed kind of hokey. The show we saw is why the rating I give it is a 4 and not higher. It was a great way to spend a day."
212,Phenomenal Miniature Park,"As with China in general, it’s full of surprises.  There are very authentic recreated houses from all over China, beautiful bridges and waterways.  The food is OK, and each area has its own local style.The shows are worth the entry price alone, even the female acrobatic team is worth the entry price; they are absolutely fantastic.The miniature towns stimulate the appetite to go and see the real thing.Overall it gets its message across very well, sort of like Disney but more Chinese and educational."
213,Chinese culture,"This is all part of the same complex as the splendid china park.  The theme park has two sides one on splendid china (think miniature village, but with china landmarks like the great wall etc), while the other half is the so called folk culture village.  As you walk around there are examples of lost of different regions/tribes of china.  Quite interesting, but the best bit are the regular shows which demonstrate dancing, dress etc for each region.  There is plenty of information about time etc.  However, to get a guide in English I had to go to the tourist information centre on the left of the ticket booths.  It was quite interesting for a couple of hours but it costs about £20 to get in!"
214,"Big parks, lots of picture spot",The ticket is rather expensive (RMB200) but free for children below 122cm and half price for children below 150cm. The leaflet is available in chinese and english. Miniature of china shows the scene of china in very large garden. But it doesn't show something spectacular here. No historical story about the objects. China folk culture is the spectacular shows with high tech effects and high individual actor skill. But only less chinese cultures was showed here. The mixed chinese-nepal-turkey cultures are dominant here. I hope to see the overall culture that I always see at movie.
215,Great Show,Went on a monday morning when it was relatively quiet. The shuttle cost an additional 30rmb per pax to bring us one round around the vast park. There were other options of driving your own e-vehicle or a donkey cart to get around. The attractions were miniature versions of famous attractions around china. Each one had a writeup in english. The grounds were well maintained and very clean. The minority tribes section had live actors going about their daily lives in a particular culture. There were eateries and small shops as well.
216,Nice place to enjoy,"My wife and I had the chance to visit this place while we were in Shenzhen for a few hours and it was worth a visit.  Mind you that we do not speak Mandarin nor can we read Chinese characters at all, but that still doesn't take away from the experience. We had a guide map that was in English so it made it very simple for us. We basically cruised around this place for a few hours. My takeaways are: 1) There are tons of photo opportunities. 2) The life-size models of pagodas, palaces, villages and ancient Chinese villages are very intricate and detailed, but you can tell they are very worn down and old looking. They could use an updated paint job, but still, the models were incredible to look at. 3) There are all kinds of places to get souvenirs, food and water. 4) There are shows happening all the time so you just need to check the schedule and see where to go. The only problem is that they are all in Chinese, so if you don't speak the language, you won't get a lot out of the show. 5) The gardens and trees are all finely manicured and well kept and very beautiful. Take it all in. Overall, you could literally spend hours here, if you wanted to, but it would have helped to have an interpreter and next time I would have rented one of the many cars that they offer, but the exercise was a nice plus. Bring comfy shoes."
217,Very amazing kind of theme park,"Ok ok that might not sound entirely insightful but hear me out. My friends and I went for a visit on a day of light rain. Because of the rain, none of the shows in the park were running - even with the 5,000+ people in the park! (As displayed in the digital sign in the front of the park). Other visitors were also sitting on benches and standing around waiting for the shows to start, but to no avail. The only silver lining was the discount on our tickets (135 RMB) from ctrip representatives at the front of the park. Also the food was good and plentiful, many many stalls around the park."
218,Grandeur show,"Splendid China is a trully experience. A lot of miniatures show the several regions of China, including mini Great Wall and mini Forbidden City. The circuit ends in a Chinese Villa, with restaurants and shows. A must see in Shenzen!"
219,Excellent cultural immersion ,This is a great place to visit . It showcases all the cultures and ethnic groups that are related to China . Very relaxing and well designed . Entry fee is reasonable and you can hire an English Speaking guide if you want . Very interesting place to go . A must do if you are in town and have time . Will take about 5 hours to really take your time and enjoy this place .
220,Must visit,My cocompany treated us to this theme park and it was the best place they've ever taken us. The entertainment shows are the main attractions. There's also a water fight/party too.
221,A must visit,very interesting park with a lot of new impressions for all different nations in China. You should visit this Park!!
222,"""perfect place for families""","Great place to visit to have a taste of all China's regional/local ethnicities. Did you know that most of Chinese are constituted of Han Chinese? Visit here and you'll find that there are more variety to the ""Chinese"" culture, its people, its food, and languages. Highlight is the nightly gala performance in a gigantic open arena. Elephants, chariots, dancers, water and fireworks, a production with probably a thousand people. Tickets are bought separately."
223,Wonderful miniatures!,"This folk culture village gave me a glimpse of the beautiful past, where there was no technology yet. Life was simple then, yet there was more life experience."
224,Enjoy with friends,If you don´t know how to start to explore China and wich city or place to start please consider this Park in Shenzhen and take a piece of paper with you to plan your trip around great China. In half day walking tour in this place you can see the ´miniatures´of the greatest monuments and places in all China. After this you should go the one travel agency and book the flights :)
225,Please see my comprehensive write up on splendid china,"This is more suited to Chinese tourists than western folk. Many of the miniatures also look like they've been built from modeling kits. Very expensive admission price and has to be paid cash only.If you have to see miniatures, rather visit Window of the World. Both parks are located by the same MTR station, Window of the World."
226,A gateway to mainland china,"Splendid China actually incorporates  two parks but requires a single admission fee.  One area features the miniature replicas of Chinese landmarks and the other highlights the cultural groups native to the country.  The cultural section, however, provides shows for additional fees.  For example, the Legend of the Desert performance I attended centered around Genghis Khan's battle with an invading army and definitely entertained the audience.  The showdown came complete with fire balls, explosions, and some excellent horse riding.  There is an admission fee and a fee for each performance.  Also, if you want to take a shuttle or train to tour the park, that is also extra.  I paid around 260 CNY ($37) for admission, the Desert show, and the shuttle train ride.The park is easy to access from the OCT Metro station.  Exit via hall D and walk toward the red bridge spanning the road.  Splendid China is on the right with a huge white elephant statue at its entrance."
227,Exploring China for only 1 Day!,"Interesting for those who likes Asian specially Chinese culture. But better to visit in Winters, Summer too hot to enjoy Splendid."
228,Not to be missed!,"Great Entertainment and cultural very interesting. You walk through a well kept park that has lots of miniatures of Chinese monuments.Kind of like a cross between Central Park and Epcot Center with miniatures of The Forbidden City, Lhasa, etc"
229,Worth checking it out,"WOnder how they did this, its basically the whole of China famous and historical places in a park plus in miniature size, My advice, rent an buggy to tour the place.Is huge and there is showtime in certain places.Plan it properly and you will cover whole park."
230,"Nice Place, not too much action",Entrance fee is rmb180 but if you buy from tour operator kiosk stationed beside the ticket counter you only pay 165rmb. Maybe it's weekday as I don't see many tourist but groups of Kindergarten kids accompanied by their Teachers and parents on their outings. I chose to pay rmb30 for a ride in the tram ( valid for the day)around the park. Tram made few stops along the route but only gave us 3 mins to take fotos. Few pp decided to wait for next tram to allow themselves more time to explore the sights  or watch the live shows. Many eateries in the park showcasing the varied cuisines of China. Visit if you have a spare day here and don't fancy any shopping or had enough of shopping.
231,Nice at Night!,"First: they want a passport to buy tickets. We used driver license and they agreed. It not cheap and cash only. It’s like a mini-China, well taken care of but not that impressive. Going around the city is better."
232,A nice day trip,"The china folk culture village is combined with Splendid china where the miniatures of all Chinese monuments are showcased, ticket priced at 200 RMB per person. Easily accessible via the OCT subway station on line 1.We visited this place on the first day of chinese new year. Although it was crowded, we were able to visit different ethnic minority areas at leisure pace and watch interesting performances. The whole place is very vibrant and colorful, its a good place to understand more about different ethnic cultures of China.The best performance is surely the horse battle live performance where they perform horse back stunts. The use of explosives gives it much more real experience. We purchased VIP pass which was 60 compared to normal 30, and it was worth it.We did go to the other side for miniature, but it was too much of a miniature, very small. We just brushed around the great wall, forbidden city and temple of heaven and then returned back. Overall, its a great place to enjoy a day for family."
233,Decent Place,"I loved the place (more than any other places in Shenzhen).I have focused on the larger sub-park, on left side, about Chinese landscapes and historic architectures : it is really great: a few hundred sites, each like 100 m2, showing a known temple, palace, mountain, gorge, walls (...), etc .. Each site is fairly well designed, with concrete (no plastic), correct painting, etc, including a few water flows to mimic rivers or cascades.It was great to guide the kids, teach them and let them discover all the variety of China.The funny part is that these sites are located, inside the park, on a kind of huge Chinese map (upside-down, though, you’ll see).It was by far my best experience in Shenzhen (more than Windows of World as second choice) or others.Note that I think there aren’t any playing items here (no roller coaster, etc).Written English information (dates, location, short historic background).Inside the park, there is one smaller half, on the right side, about pure Chinese folk items (presumably dances, houses, clothing, etc): it is not my priority (it would be too Chinese to let me appreciate it as it should): I have not been there and I cannot judge."
234,How to visit china in 3 hours,"My first time in Shenzhen A bit worried before but when we came in that open our world, this city is very clean and nice.This park is like a center of every beautiful around the world, ticket is 200¥ .A lot of traditional shows , restaurant and souvenirs shops in side.We spent half day in this park that very wonderful feel like in wonderland."
235,Well Worth It,"The Metro Stop OCT is a couple of minutes from the entrance. The attractions of the Dance of dragons and phoenix as well as the Battle with the horses was fantastic. Could not write enough about it, just want to go again one day."
236,Worth the visit,"China Folk Culture Village is next to Splendid China Park. One fee or entrance ticket allows you to tour both. There are discounts for seniors, and those over 70, whether Chinese nationals or foreigners, get in free and also get in free to watch the Splendid China Show, which to other adults is 80 rmb. The displays of houses and people are to actual size and not miniaturized as in Splendid China Park. Thus, from a viewing standpoint I liked it better, as it is clearly about as close to realistic as one can get. On display are the costumes, residential buildings, 56 national folk customs, and folk arts of many of China’s ethic groups. To tour the 40 acres park of 25 ethnic villages, other structures, escalating waterways, and look at live performances, we rented a two-seat electric vehicle, and got off to see the displays, over ten workshops, and performances as we got to them. We spent about 90 minutes touring here. We might have spent a little longer, but wanted to ensure getting tickets for and seeing the one-hour show at the Splendid China Theatre."
237,All about China's ethnicities,I actually feel that you need two days to thoroughly explore this place. This was my second visit and enjoyed it.  I was a bit disappointed to see the ticket price had gone up to 200rmb. A bit expensive considering the extra things you still need to pay for inside. Hopefully the extra charge is put into some needed maintenance in a number of areas.
238,Tiring,"Beautiful and Neat and Clean. I am surprised to see the Chinese people have done a great job to showcase their culture - organized, neat and clean."
239,Worth a visit if you interested in Chinese Culture,"You will get an overall idea/image of the various Chinese culture when visiting this village.  Same time, you can also taste the different cuisine within this village.  Enjoy your visit there."
240,Chinese Education first hand!,"We ventured out to China Folk Cultural Village on a hot Sunday.  Despite the heat, we were excited about the attraction based on the reviews.  The day started off bad and unfortunately for us, only got worseThe park is LARGE.  Many reviewers recommend the additional transportation and I'd agree.  We decided against only because we were annoyed at how you had to pay for so many extras after paying a pretty steep entrance fee.  Transportation, food, and some of the attractions are above and beyond the 200RMB/person fee. After consulting our schedule, we tried to attend two shows and enter a cave feature -- all were CLOSED.  After walking in the heat, you can imagine our disappointment.   After this, we were done.  We complained to management and they tried to tell us the shows weren't closed, we were wrong, showed us signs indicating they weren't closed.  Ultimately, after about 1.5 hours of complaining, we were refunded our money.  If you go, I'd recommend going in the evening when the tickets are cheaper and the shows are open and better (or find a discount ticket).  If you do go during the day, ask in advance if all of the featuers are open.  Finally, be prepared for an expensive day out."
241,This park has the most authentic historical perspective of the folk tribes in all of China.,"Their shows are worth the visit especially ethnic show where they show all tribal dresses through dances and Chinese gymnastics. Structural buildings in the place imitate from the real places in China such as Tibetan temple, the Great Wall, etc. But none of those things stuck into my memory. Only the shows are memorable for me.So the tips are 1) reach there by 3.30 pm or 4.00 pm in the afternoon just about the time that the horse show start (I missed that.), 2) pay for the ticket (200 RMB as of Mar 18), 3) Always keep the ticket coz' you will need to redeem for show ticket every time, 4) One hour before the show time, ticket booth will be opened, use your ticket to redeem for show ticket once more. The sooner you get your ticket, the better the seat you get. Remember to keep the main ticket. You will need it for other shows too.Then, enjoy the show !!Once you finish one show, check the schedule of the other shows, if it is close to the show time, before doing anything, go get your ticket at ticket booth which is usually close to where the show takes place."
242,Average compare to Window of the world,"Many of them are from Southern China, and the land is absolutely large. But, they are crude and old to surprise people.* 200 RMB for both entrance of Folk Village and this Splendid China Park. If you enter in the morning, Splendid China Park first and Folk Village later, as many performances at Folk Village will be in the afternoon."
243,Definitely need several hours,My teammates and I visited splendid China park on a Sunday late after noon.   Wish we had gone earlier.  We took a train tour for 30 rny and it was well worth it to see the miniatures.   The park closes at nine but once the sun goes down the buildings close and not great lighting.   The Phoenix and Dragon show was amazing.  Like a circus meets Las Vegas show girls.  Well worth it even if that is all you see.   Everything was pristine gardens and buildings amazing.   Well worth the trip.
244,Very Good pace your can find al of China,"The park is big. Horse-drawn cart is available at RMB 350 and sits 8. Else take the  train at RMB 30. For the cart, you can request it to stop whenever, wherever you want, and for as long as you like. Not so for the train - it only stops at 2 locations and hardly gives you time to take pictures. But you can go on foot if you really want to explore everything on this place. Half the park is divided into the miniature section and the other is basically village life/shows. There is quite a bit of stagnant water around, so there are lots of mosquitoes, I got bitten quite a few times. There is a Mongolian Tent restaurant there with a show as well."
245,Stuck for something to do,The park has many nicely done rebuilds of China's buildings.The price of 200 RMB seems a little bit high for such a park. All other things need to be paid extra inside.With a stroller there is some carrying to do. Not all stairs have a ramp.
246,Kerennn ( two thumbs up ),"To see the models in Splendid China Miniature Park, when you enter the area of the theme park, go left. The park features miniature important and famous sights in the country, which most foreigners surely wouldn't have heard of before. There is a 50% discount off the ticket price for seniors. Involves quite a lot of walking, but it's definitely worth it. English translations of the Chinese descriptions are sufficient.The adjacent Folk Village Theme Park (turn right instead of left) is less interesting, with staged performances and ""cultural activities"" but the distinct architecture of the model structures, such as the tribal houses, drum tower and wind and rain bridge, is the one to take note of.Depending on your interest in Chinese culture (not just Han culture but also the culture of the minorities), you can easily spend a whole day here. Bring water and a cap."
247,Fairly boring,"This park serves as an excellent introduction to the diverse cultures and ethnic groups making up China.  There are two villages in this 30 Hectare/75 acre Park-- one highlighting the 100 leading scenic wonders (miniature versions) and the other cultural, historical, art & architecture.  There are also ""live shows"" and a horse show.  It is a ""must see""-- and is also located near ""Windows to the World"".  It can be readily reached by subway.I hope that this Review has been helpful."
248,Highlights of China in a Park ,"Much like Window of the World, Splendid China is meant to showcase major attractions.  This time, it is the tourist attractions of China as opposed to the iconic sites of the world"
249,Expensive and even less impressive than Window of the World,"Informative and entertaining glimpse into the diverse culture of China. From the Mongolian desert to the Tibetan mountains to the sub tropical southern home of the pandas...Tribal dances, rituals, folk tales, shows and parades....Attractions include water features and zip lines, Mongul horse battle re-enactment with fireworks...The indoor theatre costume show oozes splendour and pomp and ceremony  from every inch of the stage...including females donning hardware of which perched atop are live white peacocks...yeh, you read that right....Great day out.!!!"
250,See China in an afternoon,"The different areas and cultures of China are shown through houses and tents, but the shows, where they show more active what is this all about were not running at the time, we have been there. (Horse riding shows, etc.) Maybe it was off season, I don't know. We where walking around for like 3 hours, was ok. Entrance fee was 180 rmb p.p.I think the rating of this attraction here on TA is reflecting it's value. Can do, not a must."
251,"China at a Glance, Go for It !!!","Me & my family were staying at Intercontinental Shenzhen and this attraction was very nearby. It is also easily accessible via Metro, just get off at the OCT (overseas China own) station and take exit A. The experience was very good. although we were in a hurry to wrap up the tour but there is lots to see and admire. different shows at different timings offers you versatility. If you don't like to walk much then a tram ride can be taken for good rates which makes 30 min tour of the attraction. There specialty is the folk cultural dance show at 5pm which is really splendid.the place also have some local restaurants to serve your appetite.so recommendation is to go for this place and spend 3-4 hours of quality time."
252,Mr,"I was there for a business trip, and took the weekend with colleagues to discover more about China. It is a miniature version of all the great places in China, combined with shows and authentic rebuild buildings from different regions. A great way to spend your free time! I do recommend to go to the shows, they are well done and better then you expect from a theme park."
253,Average Park,"I went with my friend to visit the park! I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised! At 7pm, they had a show that was really amazing. It was only 85 rmb to get in and then 20 rmb to take a ride around the park. Worth the money!"
254,Weekend on business. Must see ,Good value . Excellent presentation. The centre has exhibits from the many different cultures from China. There is two parts to Splendid China. One is the Cultural Village theother is miniature world . Both are included in the one price. If you are over 70 then it is free.
255,Splendid China Shenzhen..A splendid Day,"Great park! So much to see, Love the fresh fruit stalls selling watermelon, and coconuts. I even got a load of mangoes from one of the restaurants that were using them for smoothies. Definitely recommend"
256,Same as Splendid China Park,"Some friends took me there in the evening. The ticket is cheaper after 19:00. There were many reproductions of Chinese temples, houses, pagodas...  and places to shop and eat. We watched a dancing show that represented the history of China. The place was packed and the show was amazing with a lot of effects. I really recommend it!"
257,"Theme Park, not a cultural centre","200 RMB is not cheap. But you get sth in return. Specially the Splendid China part which shows 80+ models of famous buildings and landmarks from all over China. Almost all of them done with highest attention to detail and craftsmanship. Like in more traditional Chinese gardens also this place offers a multitude of beautiful views and perspectives. And where else can you take a photo of the West Lake with the Yellow Mountains in the distance?The folk culture village is also well made, nice views, colorful shows. The romantic perception of the life of the Chinese minorities may not be very close to reality. But at least it respects the dignity of these cultures even though they are made part of a colorful fantasy world."
258,Good fun,"See all of China in one place!!! Giant Buddha statues, palaces, temples, waterfalls, suspension bridge, monuments, statues and ancient cities all in miniature replicas of the originals. River boat rides and a fun zip cable ride over the river. The afternoon apparel show, representing 56 ethnic minorities was the highlight of the day. Absolutely gorgeous, stunningly beautiful costumes. Hands down the best show I have ever seen in my entire life. The evening Dragon and Phoenix show was also spectacular, although I found the noxious kerosene fumes from flame throwers and fireball explosions, very hard to take. All in all, highly recommended!!! 😃"
259,"Quirky and as you would expect, very China","This is a pn extremely professionally done portrait of China and it’s multifaceted cultures. I was expecting a kitschy “Legoland” type of amusement park and instead found a thoughtful, beautifully landscaped introduction to China. This park is great for sophisticated adults just as for kids. Absolutely nothing like the trashy Disneyland experience of fake plastics and horrible US fast food. No this park and it’s shows are top notch."
260,Great place!,"Shenzhen is very modern and mostly devoid of culture, but this area is one of the few places in the busy city where you can actually experience some semblance of culture"
261,organized and exhaustively,I visited this cultural village and was so impressed! Chinese are determined to ensure they presence  their culture! You will need half a day to explore this village! You lear a lot about the culture and the food!  I was excited to see they’re have a lovely lake and zip line ! There are live daily performances which are fascinating! Really highly recommended!! It’s difficult if you don’t speak Mandarin so ensure you get a good interpreter!
262,Really Interesting,"There are two key themes in this attraction. 1. Miniature replicas of famous Chinese historical sites, and 2. Minority groups in China.I was initially thrown off by the 220 RMB entrance fee but once inside the park, I can see the justification for it. It contains many good replicas of famous sites and is a good place to visualize what they are like; all contained in a single place. There are also many sites and performances where visitors can get a glimpse of the life of the minority ethnic groups of China.If you enjoy walking, then wear your walking shoes to this attraction as it's a nice place to walk around to take in all the exhibits and performances. Else, you can pay 30 RMB for unlimited rides on a tram that goes around the park."
263,Splendid China Park concentrates the cultural characteristics of China,"So many folk and tribe of China you can watch here. The culture that is vary and original will always make us admire the richness of China culture If you are in Shenzhen, this is just one stop you need to make to see Big China from small presentation."
264,Must visit place ,"Was taken to Splendid China Park on a Sunday as it was a day away from work. Notwithstanding a massive hangover, the park was something I was not expecting.  There are many, many visual attractions, coupled up with songs, dancing and audience interactions throughout the park.Along with a colleague, it appeared that we were the only English speaking customers on the day, apart from a couple of American students.So the park is massive, with full size and miniature replicas of the history of this huge country. It's worth keeping a note of the times of the big shows throughout the day, and in particular the penultimate horse show. There are not many translations in the literature or on signposts and so we were fortunate to have an english speaking guide, without I would have not got as much out of the day. As with most of rural and ""old"" china, the toilets are basic, so bring your own paper! The food on site was cheap and plentiful. Overall the large shows are really interesting, with real birds accompanying dancers, explosions and fireworks are also very loud and very entertaining."
265,Amazing Accidental Experience,"Me, my sister and my mother had no intentions of going to splendid China but somehow we ended up there. We took a chance and went in. Splendid China shows the actual arts,culture and history of China. They are very cordial and audience friendly. There are various shows scheduled. The 5 pm and the 7 pm show are NOT TO BE MISSED. It is grand and huge.The shows were just outstanding. We did zipline out there as well for free. It is a huge park but its totally worth it. Instead of windows of the world, I would recommend you'll to go for this. Carry adequate packed snacks and water. You'll will find the local public there too."
266,"Don't have time to visit all of China....don't worry, try Splendid China!","China Folk Culture Village is full of little houses supposed to depict the ""56"" ethnicities of the country. Even though it might seem a bit weird (like a ""human zoo"") it's actually very interesting and some horse-riding shows from Mongols and Manchus in traditional costumes make it enternaining. If you get to the right hours, you may also see some traditional dances from all over China. If you don't know what to do in Shenzhen, I recommend. It is grouped with Splendid China. If you want to see both by daytime, you'd better spare your entire day."
267,Splendid China Park,"The day was very hot and there was no airconditioning in any of the facilities. Other than that, it was a fascinating day stepping in to al the 55+ cultures that make up the China provinces. I engaged some of the authentic people representing the cultures. Perhaps the most spectacular performance was the horsemen doing battle. The variation in living styles, costume, housing, crafts, languages, etc is astounding. It gives you a new appreciation of the make-up of China."
268,Well presented and wide ranging,"Huge area to see China in a row,. Local traditional house of varies culture custome. Ride buggy car to save some energy. Spend whole day here, its worth. Local f&b, souvenir stalls available inside, some live shows, check schedule. Check weather on your visit day. Spend here 1 day and next day on window of the world beside."
269,A wonderfull park,We took a group from out of town there and they all enjoyed the visit.We recommend you take a golf cart to get around and try to avoid the hot summer days.
270,Impressive park,"It's a big park. We were there with our elderly parents, so chose to rent a light car to tour the premise. One section is the miniatures, another the tribe villages. If pressed for time, go for the miniatures. Very well maintained, clean, including the toilet. That's a big relieve."
271,Fine,"Being slightly apprehensive about what we would be getting for 300 rmb, we were sorry not to have more time to see everything. It is huge, well done, with representation of the chinese minorities, their houses and customs, landscaped park like areas, a big lake, attractions for young and old, food stalls and restaurants and 15-30 minutes of entertainment at several places. We spent half a day, but it would realistically be a one day outing."
272,Miniatures of all great touristic places in China,"Splendid China and China Folk Culture Village are a combined theme park (one ticket for both parks). In Splendid China, you can see the highlights of China (great wall, forbidden palace, summer palace, potala palace, etc). All of these are well made and maintained The facilities in the park are good as well. Because of the temperature (it was 32 C when we visited the park) we first did the tour with the train - it takes you around the park (both) in 25 minutes. It's a really good option on a hot day."
273,Very good to discover chinese diversity,"This is a combination of two older parks, Folk Village and Cultural China Park. They made one larger park out of both of them. They are next to Window of the World Park and across the boulevard from Happy Valley Park. All these parks are on the west side of Shenzhen. China Folk Culture Village is my favorite. It is a large park with a garden like environment. Within the greenery are models of famous places in China. There are temples and towns in miniature. A tourist can learn about many places in China that might be interesting to visit.There is no rush in this park. Long curving walks wind around the gardens and water-ways. The park was build around some actual ancient buildings and bridges. Tourists can be driven around in several kinds of vehicles including stylish river boats. Don't be in a hurry to see it all. If you like the long walks and interesting sights, you could stay all day."
274,Made my trip,Many reconstructions and acting of various part. I would have wished more maps to get oriented and time period.
275,A good place to visit,"At first, I was reluctant to go to this park because of the expensive ticket price. I chose this over Window of The World as I had limited budget. I arrived at late afternoon so I missed a lot of the tribal shows but I managed to watch all the main shows in the Folk Cultural Village. This was my first time to China so I'm amazed by the large-scale performances showcased at this rather small park. The Oriental Dress Show was my favourite besides the Grand Evening Party. Even by watching only these two shows was well worth the ticket price. The Splendid China miniature park was just average to me. A slight bummer during my time there was when I had a small conflict with a group of local tourists who insisted sitting at my seat in order to be seated together during the Grand Evening Party show. For the show, everyone was given designated seat according to the number given when exchanging your ticket. So when the guy wanted to take my seat, that means others had to shift 1 seat to the right and since the other group sitting on my right made it clear that they would not change theirs, I was left without any seat. Thus, I had to stand my ground and insisted that I should be seated according to the number clearly written on my ticket. The language barrier between us further complicates the issue. At one point, I think he got frustrated too and eventually gave me back my seat though with a clear grumble. Apart from that, I had only great memories of this place and really recommend this park for those visiting Shenzhen."
276,A nice method to see whole China in one day,"Expensive entry price of 180 RMB. extortionate prices for food and souvenirsIf you turn left you'll reach the area of the reduced-size models of famous places around China. Nice, but exhausting.If you continue straight ahead and then to the right, you'll get the models of 1: 1 of some of the less familiar nationalities of China. very nice.The Bottom Line. It is better to visit in the afternoon. During the day it's too hot"
277,"China, contained in a park","The two displays I like the most are those of the Great Wall, which is likely by far the largest, and the Mongolian display of Nadam Fair of Inner Mongolia. The latter is a fair like celebration of jubilee and games, nowadays held in the summer and autumn by the Mongolian people. For the vast majority of us not able to tour China and get to see many of the highlights and wonders of the country, its 56 ethic groups, and landscape, this is a miniaturized display of the architecture and country area. It is the world’s largest miniature park, where there are almost 100 displays of China’s major tourist attractions and 25 ethnic villages on the 30 hectare site. To appreciate it, it is best to take a guided tour, or go slowly and read all the information plaques. These are both in Chinese and English. During my tour I took photos of the majority of the displays and their information plaques. I’ll be submitting the photos with my narrative. The displays include historical relics, natural landscapes, courtyards, bridges, temples, villages, and more. The major highlights include a large display of the Great Wall, Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Terracotta Army, Stone Forest, Confucian Temple, over 80 other miniaturized attractions. To detailed tour of Splendid China, wit reading of all the information plaques, can easily take two hours or more."
278,A good day out!,"I went to Shenzhen on a business trip and one of my co-workers suggested this park to me and I am so grateful to her. This was my first trip to China, but since it was for business I obviously did not have enough time to travel around the country and see what China has to offer. This park is a great way to learn and understand more about China and it's culture and people. There are 55 ethnic minority groups in China and each one of those groups is represented at this park. You'll learn about how each minority lives, eats, dresses, what language they speak, what religious believes they follow, etc. Each ethnic group has a typical house or dwelling that shows how the average family lives. I had no clue how diverse these groups are and I was fascinated to learn about their respective ways of living. There is a second part to the park in which you walk through a miniature version of China's biggest and/or most important monuments. Each item was built was great detail and I was able to visit the Great Wall of China, the Forbidden City, the Terracotta Army, the Summer Palace and many other attractions in one day ;-)We took our time strolling though the villages and looking at the all the wonderful sights. With its trees, creeks, waterfalls, caves, etc, you can also take a break from the craziness of Shenzhen. I spent almost all day there and was happy and full of new impressions when I got back to my hotel that night. I definitely would recommend the park to anyone visiting Shenzhen."
279,"A good day, but looking a bit tired","Hello , I visited in the morning it's very near to window of the world you can use OCT metro station .. It's very beautiful garden there is a lot of activity to do entery fee is 180 RMB and you can take inside a train to have a tour or rent a motor bike for this ..There is a lot of shows and you can see all china places and history there"
280,Cultural and Nice,"I had a free afternoon and this was across the street from my hotel (over a pretty bridge.) It was a wonderful surprise.  The shows featuring different areas of Chinese culture (music and dance) were terrific.  The grounds are beautiful, and give you a wonderful glimpse into the different cultures and areas of China.  It was a terrific place to spend several hours on a nice day."
281,Interesting & Educational ,You can watch many performance that show you different cultures in China. You can also see many different buildings and way of life related to certain Chinese community.
282,Interesting snapshot of Chinese culture,"Splendid Park not just miniature and show. A lot of attraction can be found at here. Traditional minorities house can be found too. Much like TMII in Indonesia as both of them show their culture respectively.No much changed since visit in 2007. Only minor update at few attraction. Some of the building began look dated.Unlike at Window of The World, miniature at Splendid Cbina displaying miniature of building entirely from China. Example such Great Wall of China and Potala Palace.Splendid China more crowded after 16.00 pm because most of local tourist come only for watching performance show showing acrobatic and culture of China (both at indoor and outdoor).Speaking of show both of indoor and outdoor were awesome. Compared to indoor show back then in 2007 (noted that during visit in 2007 I only watched indoor show only), indoor show nowadays more elegant, thanks to usage projector and more well-build property. Indoor show in 2007 look more conventional. There were subtitle in Mandarin, English, Korean and Japanese (the last two only available at outdoor).Around 50 street food stall were established near building for performance show, perhaps to take advantage of visitor that come for watching show. Mostly selling local street food and each stall offered different type of food.Chinese Opera show also exist at small outdoor stage. Usually only a few visitor watch and performance in Mandarin only.Most miniature at Splendid China less maintained. Some of the miniature had faded paint or dirty."
283,Spectacular theme park! ,The China Folk Culture Village is very very nice park in Shenzhen.This worthwhile attraction is part of Overseas Chinese Village.
284,Very cultural and interesting,"Very nice park. This place is divided in 2. The right one is showing how chinese minorities are living in 100% scale. Very interesting. At the time we were there, we havent seen any show. But anyway, the houses are very well done.The second part is showing the main important palaces, temples, places in China. You will,discover in 2-3 hours a huge amount of places. Giving ideas for future trip. Very well done.Entrance was 180rmb. Price a little high but it is still ok.Very close to subway station.English subtitles on panels."
285,Entertaining day out,"Miniatures of famous buildings and structures in China.  Some I recognised - Great Wall, Tian An Men Square, Forbidden City, Yunnan Stone Forest...others escaped me.  I found the miniatures way too small.  They look OK if you take pictures of them by themselves but as soon as you place yourself in the picture, the illusion of them being the real thing goes away....They have built a theater inside the parks - the show is OK but nothing to shout about.The park is big.  Horse-drawn cart is available at RMB350 and sits 8.  Else take the motorised train at RMB30.  For the cart, you can request it to stop whenever, wherever you want, and for as long as you like. Not so for the train - it only stops at 2 locations and gives you 5 min to take pictures.  Still, if you don't have a group of 8 or thereabouts, the train is more affordable.Personally, I find the ""Window on the World"" to be the better place to visit.  The miniatures there are not as small, and the park is beautifully maintained.  The structures there are of famous buildings around the world - like the Eiffel Tower, London Bridge, Empire State Building...you get the idea.  Its also in Shenzhen."
286,Fun,"Folk Cultural Village and Splendid China are both in the same park. Get off at OCT Metro and take exit D. Walk straight and you will see the park on the right. It opens at 10am. The admission fee is 180 yuan which you can access both the Folk Cultural Village and Splendid China. They are both interesting and is a must visit place if you are in Shenzhen. You probably need the whole day till the night to see it all. Do stay back for all the major live performances - the Golden Spear Dynasty (2pm & 4pm), New Oriental Apparel (5pm) and Dragon & Phoenix Dance performance (7.30pm). Don't miss it as it is really awesome. The costumes, acrobatic performance, and the music and stage are absolutely impressive & amazing! It was really entertaining and I love it!"
287,It is splendid indeed,"We went there to explore some things new ,we have so excited what we observed that about  cultural villages ,it extremely helped us to know a bit about Chinese culture,"
288,Fascinating,"My friend came from Israel to visit me in Shenzhen and even tho for 2 years i've been living here, i've never visited the Folk culture.I'll start with the price: Expensive.It's 200RMB for one ticket, i would expect 60-100RMB but 200 is way too much.We came afternoon and was on rush all the time which I a bit regret about it, this place is definitely worth visit, spending time, discussing China and it's culture and reading each and every place and the meaning that behind it. We had a dinner there as well which was pretty good and a bit more pricey than outside but definitely reasonable.Finally, we attended the big show which is something you don't wanna miss. TL;DR: Pricey but in general worth it, if you don't have time travel across China that's definitely a place to go."
289,Great attraction,"If you visit Shenzhen, don't miss to visit this place. Any hotel provide you information. Ticket is affordable but you watch incredible show about Chinese historical culture. People don't speak English but they are very nice and polite and help you."
290,Better than Disney!,It was surprise that we can negoiate for entry fee.some of us got for 135rmb and some as usual got for 180rmb.people nearby to booking counter will offer low price for ticket 150 rmb u have to pay for 135rmb ticket.corruption :-). Go with batterybanks for mobile as all people with me got there batteries over clicks picks all the way.All chinese culture under one place.Best on was there tradition marriages and beautiful chinese couples.
291,Cultural Coverage of China,We got tied up at the Hong Kong - China border border which cut our visit to the Cultural Village short. We were able to take a ride around the village to see the miniature buildings. We also viewed the show of the Mongols raiding a village - nice but the audience was mostly screaming school children. Best part was a show in which the actors/dancers wore fantastic costumes.
292,China Culture,"This place includes a representation of the various cultures and minorities in China. It has villages, shows, cultural activities, and restaurants. Highly recommended!!"
293,Hidden gem,"This large space for Chinese folk culture and minority people is well designed and managed. As many performances by each minority people is usually performed in the afternoon and some of them are overlapped, one day visiting is not absolutely sufficient to know all of them.* 200 RMB for both attractions (China Folk Culture Village and Splendid China Park)"
294,Hidden gem,Many different Chinese minority’s houses and landscape is shown.  Good overview of China in short period of time is possible.Enjoyed it even if I am traveling to China since 20 + years
295,Stay Back to Watch The 3 Major Live Performances,"My two boys are six and eight, so I was looking for somewhere to spend some Funtime together in Shenzhen. Splendid China gave the kids a good view of the different sites around China and also woke their appetite to explore the country further. Come early when there are less people and rent an electric scooter for the fun of driving around the park. If your kids are blond with blue eyes like mine, then be prepared to be constantly asked for selfies. I tried to convince the kids to charge 30RMB but they’re much too polite for such nonsense.... There’s also a playground where they really enjoyed themselves. It was a really good day out!"
296,Nice park to see a little bit of China,"Splendid China is a very large park in Western Shenzhen. It is on the same thorofare as Window of the World. Both are large parks that need hours to see. I don't recommend seeing them on the same day.Several years ago, there were two parks: Splendid China and Cultural China  (Folk Village). They were neighboring parks. Cultural China was merged into Splendid China as we see it today.There are many ways to see the park. If you love walking and have all day, then plan on a leisurely stroll that will last for hours. There are also tour groups and individual tours available with little cars or trains that will carry you around. Splendid China is one of the most beautiful parks in Shenzhen. See historical models, gardens, waterfalls, rivers, arched bridges, pagodas, and lots of colorful vegetation.Splendid China is the #1 rated tourist attraction in Shenzhen. Of course what your budget allows will determine how you want to see the park.Don't miss it!"
297,well it's Whole china under one roof!,"Disembark OCT subway, exit D to get to the theme park. Although it is expensive, 180 yuan, the park highlights China's famous landmarks and the ethic groups. The cultural performances and battle of the horses in the villages are a must to visit."
298,A very precise and beautiful way to see Chinese Culture!,Very easy go to this attraction. I looked ticket price for foreigner and local people is same 220 yuan. For foreigner it has previliege acces and dont join with local people acces. but i suggest dont go to this attraction on saturday and sunday is very crowded. All of the miniature is so perfect but you will see the local people often breach the boundary to look miniature and its so funny and annoyying. If you take a photo or really read the history of miniature maybe you must spare 3-4 hours not included if you watch china dance or china culture show. i prefer choose this than World of windows.
299,"""Splendid!"" China","I take long vocation to china and hongkong with my friend.so we decide to visit splendid of china.. i think this place is owesome, they build miniatur of great wall incude their army,and if night comes, the ambianceis very cool..and i also watch the show, and it's really amazing such as their light effect, sound, and also people performance..i think you should visit this place if you in shenchen.."
