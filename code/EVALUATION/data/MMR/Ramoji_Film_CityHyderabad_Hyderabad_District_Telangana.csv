0,Incredible,I went there with my wife & friends. It is situated nearby to Hyderabad Airport. I just loved the place. I saw so many sets of different films. It took complete one day to go through each and every part of Ramoji Film City. It's a complete one day picnic. I have enjoyed throughly.
1,Fun filled day visit,I visited Ramoji film City with my family. This park is very versatile and there is something for everyone.
2,A dreamland,Awesome place where I enjoyed a lot with my friends. It is one of the best places in Hyderabad. Well equipped infrastructure greenary and awesome look. The place which attracts many people.
3,attractive place,The only tourist location we decided to later in Hyderabad this trip was to Ramoji film city. The place is quite far from city center. we had booked premium experience and it was a good start. The dances and shows were very impressive.It took all day and was very tiring. Can package the trip differently if possible.
4,Best Place to Visit with whole family,Best attraction of Hyderabad is Ramoji Film City. I travelled here a lot of times before and it has always been good to go.
5,Awesome ,This is a place for Film lovers and it is about 30 kms from the city. We should reach the place by early morning or by 9 AM. There are different packages which includes everything. It is a place where we get to feel the essence of Film making.
6,Absolutely amazing experience,"We have visited Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad. It is really wonderful experience to all of us, now a days all major film shootings are taking place in it because it is having all in one like Airport, Bus Station, Railway Station scenes and wonderful garden spots, water fountain spots, children exhibitions, amusement parks etc. For visitors they are charging Rs.1500/- per head and it is really worthfull entertainment trip. It is famous in Asia."
7,Biggest film city park ,We have had a day trip with family to Ramoji film city. It's a humongous studio with different shooting sets of Indian cinema. There are not many rides but lot of theater shows. The birds park is one of the best in India. If you're visiting for rides and thrill it's not a place to visit as there are very limited options.
8,Interesting look at Indian Film Making,"So during our visit to hyderabad, we planned on to visit this place with our family. The trip started on a not very good note, as we were travelling by our own vehicle we reached directly to the main entrance of the film city. On reaching there we were told that we have to go back some 4-5 kms, park our vehicle & take a bus from there for entry inside the film city. Mind here this is just an entry & not the inside tour. They could have allowed parking there only as anyways outside vehicles are not allowed & we have to take there accomodation only for travelling inside.Moving on, as we had a child with us so we were carrying certain food items with us, now while security checking they asked us to keep some of our food items into the baggage room. Point to be noted is they asked some items to be kept outside & not all , and even after applying all my logics i couldn't understand that how she came to the conclusion as to which food item should be allowed & which should not.After all this as we entered the film city, it was a little tough for someone visiting the place for the first time to understand to go in which direction thankfully we had a couple with us who was little familiar with the place. So, first we watched a show in Alpana which was a good one & by the time the performance we all were hungry, so our search for a veg restaurant took us to chanakya which was blocked for group packages only. It was an April afternoon, temperaure touching 40'C & now we were moving all the way back to Dil Se restraunt. Food was ok but only option available was buffet. Next we had to take the bus for the inside tour, when we saw the line for the bus it reminded me of some pilgrimage. I couldn't understand why do you have to gather the crowd make them stand in lines & then after doing tapasya you are given the opportunity to sit in the bus that too for 2 mins, because you have to get down at next stop which is 2 mins away, & then roam aroung in that stop which again takes hardly 5 mins go for another bus...ufff...typing itself is making me tired. So after taking some 3-4 buses & roaming at some 3-4 stops we were about to go for the ""Bahubali"" set but suddenly it started raining. And it was raining so hard that we couldn't get out of the bus only.After waiting for some 15 mins inside the bus the rain stopped & we got down at the bahubali stop, it was water all over. The set was not at all in the good condition & before we could see any further it started raining heavily again & there was no place to hide, so we were trying to save ourselves by standing below a horse statue. But, as I said that poor horse couldn't save us from the heavy rains. After standing for some half an hour when there was no sign of rains stopping a watchman came to ask us to go to the bus point as the bahubali set is not looking visitable anymore. So in those non-stop rains we were running towards the bus point to take us back. We thought the bus will take us back to the parking place but no there was more drama to unfold. It took us back to our starting point of tour inside ramoji, now we again have to stand & wait for a bus which can take us to our car parking place & yeah  i would like to mention here that the rain had not stopped yet. So after waiting for some 45 mins in full heavy rain with a child we got a bus to our parking spot & our dreadful journey ended."
9,One of the top tourist place in hyderabad,"I had wonderful reviews of this place from all my friends who had visited Hyderabad, hence paid this place a visit. I shall only say that this place was short of my expectations. Maybe the reason was that I do not go to the movies often. Hope that maybe they allow personal vehicles inside the complex some day, so that we may have better options to visit the parks on our own."
10,Better than imagination,"Went  Hyderabad with family members for vacation. In Hyderabad, we went to ramoji film city. Ramoji film city is a huge place. Different films shooting are done here. Films set, the theme park is there to visit. Awesome place I visited."
11,Was excellent experience to visit the worlds largest Film city,"I visited Ramoji film city 15 years back, At that time it was a great experince and recently I visited with my friends, this time I felt like I visited another world, What a drastic change in these yearsA huge campus, beautiful sets, good presentation of art of film making, audience involvement, the full entertainment package. Must watch for kids. Descent food choices. Be cautious with elderly as they lack sufficient wheel chairs, support, elderly friendly ramps. Carry sufficient water and be prepared for a good walk and good time"
12,Ramoji Film City .. full adventure for family with kids ,"I have visited Ramoji Film City back in 2015 when my son was of 2 years and we had a very good experience as we all enjoyed the shows, rides etc. Now, they have added many more things and the fun is now double. We reached late, at around 11:30 and that was the biggest mistake as we have covered no more than 50% of the things, I suggest to prepare for the visit a day in advance and reach there at 7:30 am, the time when it starts, and enjoy the whole day there."
13,Universal studios of India,Its awesome place on outskirts of hyderabad. Must visit for every one travelling to hyderabad. Will take you good 6-7 hous to complete the tour.  Should start early.
14,Amazing experience! Overall a highly enjoyable place and offers a lot for every visitor of every age group!,Ramoji Film City is far away from the City and takes time travel. One hole day is gonna enjoyment here
15,Review,"I live in Hyderabad & somehow visited this magical place multiple times, very recently in September,  Always got the same feeling which I am getting since my very first time in 2006.....One of the largest film city, spread over a very large area, situated on Vijayawada Highway around 16 km from LB Nagar circle on city outskirts, Nicely maintained and u get a free shuttle bus to reach the centre point, from there u can walk and enjoy your moments till evening, Many amazing parks, many other opportunities for adventure, u can learn about film making and many amazing sites of popular movies,Advice:If possible one can stay one night in hotel Tara & Sitara and enjoy the evening !!!!!"
16,Eighth wonder,"The film city is spread over huge place with lots of exciting stuff for all the people visiting it. Lovely ambiance with the parks, movie sets, bird sanctuary and many entertainment shows. Enjoyed throughout the day with family and friends. Best place to visit for those planning for a day out."

I enjoyed the trip every time that I had been here.You will find alot of movie sets and also realize or feel like you already saw them somewhere. Don't know if worry that must be in a movie.You will have bus roots inside and the buses are free. It is included in the entry fee of Film City.There will be many parks and star hotels and what not you will find all varieties of sets permanently laid.There are star hotels also available in the Film City called Tara and Sitara.The food is delicious in Ramoji Film City Canteen.

20,Excellent Place to visit,We went there another couple. It is unbelievable place no one can rate it less then 5. If in Hyderabad should go. It's a whole day visit place. Try going after August. Or may be winters.
21,Rich experience,This visit to Ramoji film city will remain in my memory for ever. the visit was very planned and we got to understand about film making and enjoyed a lot.
22,Touring in bus   visit was excellent in all aspects,Romaji is must visit place in Hyderabad We loved the places kids enjoyed but for me that last 1 Hour live show is relaxed as u get tired and u need to relax when u reachingat exit point u can see live show it’s amazing you get automatically Relaxed
23,Family trip,"'Ramoji' film city is a famous place in Hyderabad entry fee is 1150 per head .But we gone with telangana tourism 1650rs per head we see many places like gardens, parks shooting sets famous attraction r japanese garden,bahubali set, Ramoji movie magic, space yatra, light camera action, airport shooting run over there Beautiful Hawamahal, kripalu caves,sun fountain, birds & butterfly park duck & big ostrich is there with eggs v see central Jail we taken photos inside. but outside food is not allowed if food is their in ur bag u must keep in luggage room  we can shop over there in R.F.C. nice decors  we missed borasura if u want to go take caps & bottles go in summer feast in april start carnival events will held.many free games are there &paid games r there but we do know that so while u go & enquiry it"
24,Ramoji Film City,"The film based theme park is located outside the city of Hyderabad. It’s a huge place and requires at least half a day. The day tour and activities relating to film making are well planned. The film sets are well laid out and give a glimpse of behind the screen activities. There are good restaurants and food stall all around. Kudos to the management for the nice upkeep of such a huge place. Tickets are bit overpriced, they should make it more economical."
25,Film city,"Film city is located in outskirts of Hyderabad. You can plan for one day or two day visit. It has hotels as well, if you want to stay for two days. Best for people who wants to see different film locations.Its spread across an area of almost 2500 acres. Ramoji Film City offers umpteen numbers of film sets such as London Street, Hollywood sign, Japanese gardens, airport, hospital, etc."
26,Great experience Compared to previous visit,"I think all of us will go here after read the place name..Ramoji Film City,its joke..not film city, but city with building for self photographer..I am not coming here to shoot picture with me and the building, instead to watch live movie shooting or at least serial shooting..sad"
27,Fun time ,"On a recent business cum leisure trip to Ramoji Film City, I enjoyed my visit there.With good stay option provided inside Hotel Tara there, conference room facilities it proved to be a good setting for a Business meeting. Further seeing the beautiful and huge Ramoji film City with its multiple filmy attractions was an experience in itself.The evening concert and the Summer Carnival provided the icing on the cake.Would have enjoyed more if the weather was cooler, but all in all a very good place to visit."
28,Ramoji Film City- A visit,"Ramoji Film City is a film buff's fantasy come true. The property, located about 40 Km from Hyderabad, is spread over a whopping 1666 acres, with a large number of permanent sets, including a whole street of permanent double story residence houses for filming, plus sets where specific sets can be erected for TV serial or film shooting. It also includes play areas for children, carousel rides etc. Visitors are encouraged to spend the whole day indulging in their fantasies, children have a great run of wide open spaces, Disney Wonderland like rides, food outlets. It's a great idea for families to spend a day for the entertainment of the full family. There are plenty of restroom spread over the property, which are well maintained and clean. There are also live shows like how movies are made and Wild West. I believe that these shows are rotated regularly so that one could expect new shows regularly. Special buses ferry the visitors from the parking lots to the main attractions and there are well informed guides who are a wealth of information about the attraction. Some of the interesting attractions are the permanent BAHUBALI set with huge statues of horses, elephants, chariots and other sets used in the movie. Visitors are charged an Entrance Fee of around INR 1300 + VAT for the Economy tour. VIP Tour is around INR 2800 which includes all the aspects of the Economy tour but in a air-conditioned bus.If in Hyderabad, its worth a visit. Do free your itinerary for a full day visit"
29,Excellent display or creativity,"Ramoji Film City is a wonderful place for full day family outing. It leaves all visiters with some memorable experiences. We were much impressed with the visitor friendly approach taken by the management. The young volunteers available all over the property are always ready to attend to all sorts of queries. The shows were unique and keep you enthralled. Total property is well maintained, clean and adequate provision for food, drinking water and rest rooms. Sprawling gardens are beautiful with variety of flora and fauna. We were lucky to attend the winter carnival which was a grand show of music & dance.Overall, it is a must visit place and should not be missed if one goes to Hyderabad.A must go for based on VIP members because it gives extra benefits for tourists.."
30,World of Beauty,"Ramoji Flim City is a wonderfull and a do not miss place in hyderabad to visit , the flim city is very huge the attractions created by the them for the tourist are mesmarizing, RAMOJI FILM CITY is not just the pride of Hyderabad but it is the pride of INDIA , this huge place was neat and clean though its entirely open. we all were flatterd by the huge stucture , huge sets and all."
31,Biggest Bollywood Bonanza! ,One must visit this place in Hyderabad. Also it is not possible to see all the places in just one day. You must have at least 2 days to see all the places in Ramoji Film City
32,Family Tourism,"It was a great experience for me and my family to visit Ramoji film city.Everything we cited was different whether it is the theatre shooting sets,locations esp.the bahubali set or the park.Movie magic gave an awesome feel about how a movie happens..In addition the butterfly park,wings,sahas all fullfill the balance..Highly recommended."
33,Must visit for tourists in Hyderabad,Visit to Ramoji film city after conference as a day out was a amazing experience. On welcome they gave us ( all delegates) a box of chocolates. The live shows were breathtaking. The ambience was excellent.
34,Not worth the hype,"After have wonderful experience in different studios across the world...I should say Ramoji Film City is Amazing & Awesome...customer service &hospitality is so friendly , transportation for every 10 min, multiple varieties of cuisines and pocket friendly.Having drinking water facility and relaxing points at every corner.Rest Rooms are well maintained.Evening carnival is mind blowing..so cheerful...feels like heaven is in exsitance in 1666 acher of land ..its just massive feel & look ,which enhances to an extreme extent in the evening & night shows.Its an place should visit & enjoy the graceful feeling.Hats off to the entire team of Ramoji Film City.Sabitha Sekhar :)Stayed in Tara"
35,Great visit,Its very nice place and even 1 day is less to look all in Ramoji Film City.You will love to roam in Ramoji Film City.
36,Good place to spend a day,"This was my 2nd trip to Ramoji Film City. However only this time I could see the whole place. We took their Hop on Hop off bus. Although the afternoon was hot in the open bus the heat was bearable. spread over 1,666 Acres this is the largest studio complex around the world as per Guinness Book of World  Records.They have created  quite a few attaractions that will hold inteerst fpr one whole day. The icing on the cake is the Set of the Blockbuster movie Baahubali which tehy have retained without demolishing the same & gives an idea how smart camera work can give larger tahn life feel to regular things."
37,Visit,"Ramoji Film City is an expanse that is dedicated to cinema and leisure. It has very good infrastructure and many avenues for entertainment but as almost the entire area is based on the theme cinema, it would be enjoyed mostly by film buffs. The preserved remnants of the…"
38,Good place for kids,Ramoji film city it’s huge film city. It’s is built with 100 acres land. The palace is awesome u cannot cover most of the place in the studio. The studio are well built and the place is quite expensive.
39,full entertainment,"Ramoji Film City is the top tourist destination in Hyderabad and is such a landmark, which attracts tourist to Hyderabad. The Film City is located on the outskirts of Hyderabad City. The reception area, parking and the ticket counters are located away from the main city, where all the visitors are ferried to in buses.We had booked the tickets online, which we realized, was a good decision, as there were long queues at the ticket counters. There were more than one options available for touring the Film City and we opted for a more expensive, star experience, which again turned out to be a good decision.To visit Ramoji Film City, is an unique experience, which does not have any parallels in India. The people visit the place in droves and every landmark inside the city was crowded. During the off season, the place may be little less crowded.There are lot of avenues inside to get entertained and it is worth spending a day here."
40,The best place to visit with family in Hyderabad,"Ramoji film City, a must visit place , big area one day trip is suitable for viewing all inthis place, gig and superb , famous with big film sets like Bahubali and more"
41,A new experience and a lot of fun activities,"Located approximately 65 km away from hitec city ( traffic free ride thru ORR) is a fantasy land for Indian cinema.  U ought to reach parking area and take ramoji bus to the film city ( 6-8 km) the entry fee is 1250 per person for tour , food is not included but their restro have 4 options and seem reasonable if not crowded. Tho it's worth only 1 visit it surely fascinates in terms of some bird and butterfly park, bahubali sets, Rohit Shetty and other famous movie sets, they also show basic techniques and stunt shows. All in all its definitely a one time must visit day outing with all cultural parades etc, the only issue I feel was it's a maze once u enter u cannot skip, u ought to follow lane and see everything whether of your choice or no."
42,A MUST SEE,Many movies are shot here. This place has three star hotels catering to the needs of visitors. A gigantic studio that has shooting sets ranging from airports to palaces. A wonderful experience!!
43,Must Go Place,it was an ordinary sunny day in Hyderabad with some extraordinary experience with ramoji film city. A complete visual treat for kids and a satisfying visit for elders. a must visit place for all and specially cine-lovers.
44,Perfect Family Vacation with Young Kids 11 & 7 year old,Good to visit but it is super crowded. The great Baahubali movie set is right here. This film was the first Telugu film to win the National Film Awards for special effects and feature film. There is plenty to experience here. Just have tons of patience!
45,Very good ,"We visited the film city in March. The place is huge and there are a lot of things to see. The tour was a guided tour which made perfect sense given the size of the film city. Film sets were interesting, especially Bahubali sets. Lunch was good and there was a good spread of dishes. Wish we had more time for the tour and photo taking."
46,Hail ramoji film city,It is the biggest film city in India. Located in acres of areas. In summer season it is opens for tourists. We can see many buildings there which are made for movie shooting.and  many parks are here.
47,Visit,"If you willing to visit Hyderabad do visit the Ramoji Film City. Biggest Film City in India. The Place where you can find everything all type of film sets, gardens, live shows.The Must Place to Visit in Hyderabad."
48,overall good experience for all with premium tickets,"I had heard about this place from many friends so really wanted to visit :) Though I have been to Universal Studios in the USA , but this was also a good place to spend time with Family.The timings of the Hop on and Off buses were great.so you can finish one spot and the next spot mostly buses were available to take you to the next stop.Place is maintained very well. Space Yatra was good so is the Kids play area with rides.Sandwiches at the shops were yummy too.Washrooms are clean .We also visited the Caves, Bahubali set, Japanese Garden and many other attractions.We missed the evening lights. They also have hotels inside the premises in case you want to take a short break and complete all the attractions in the park.In all a good place to be with kids and family."
49,It's really exciting and fun to recollect all the places that I already saw in movies,"I really enjoyed my trip to Ramoji Film city, although food is little expensive  it is good. bird park and bahu bali set are nice  children enjoyed movie making  show and laser light show, stunt show   One can fully spend one day in RFC I recommend it for tourists as well as locals ."
50,Must visit,this place is a lot of excitement and also movie shootings were stars of phalanx come here for their movie shooting and also lots of stage plays and staying as guests also the ticket here is expensive as it is worth for all the services and entertainment they are providing .very very large and huge area one should come with full energy and enthusiasm to room and enjoy the cost of the ticket they have payed. overall it is suitable whether its family or friends or colleagues or school groups .
51,Two day visit with intervening night stay at i City hotel,"Ramoji Fiml City is the largest film city in the world and it is a good place to visit with family for a day of incursion. It has fun rides, film sets and the most popular Bahubali movie set."
52,The content of the shows mars the effect of grandeur,The place is very large with many film sets and places ideal for film shoots. All day entertainment programs are enjoyable.
53,Great Place to Visit ,"When you are in Hyderabad and you have a day's time you must visit this place. It's worth of every penny you spend on the entry which is around Rs. 1357. You can book online on their website for tickets or bookmyshow. It needs a full day to visit each and every show in film City. . It is located outside city hence the autos charge around Rs. 1500 for pick and drop. Food is expensive there but no option as they do not allow outside food. The film City tour on the buses is excellent. The not to miss shows include- space yatra, action thriller, film city tour, bahubali set visit etc."
54,Ramoji Film City- Must visit place in Hyderabad,"i visited this place three times in last 10 years because you will never feel bored with this place.really amazing place to visit with your family i am mentioning family because alone you will not enjoy the fullest.i visited the place in the month of december,i will recommend everyone to vsit in dec last week or january first week because in this time they do special events for new year celebration.the place is really very neat and clean and the events are awesome.entry time is 8am and closing time depends upon events varies between 7pm to 8pm,please reconfirm with official website about the timings.you will find everything there like fake movie shooting,fake railway plateform,airport and if you are lucky enough than u can see live shooting of a movie.in 12 hours of journey inside the ramoji premises u will not get bored for a single moment.i will not recommend this place if someone is ill or having issue with long walking as in many places you have to walk alot because during site seeing you have to walk where bus can not proceed.overall in my opinion this is the place where everyone should go at least once in his lifetime."
55,Ramoji impresses!,"Place is amazing , you can experience and be a part of reel life. Gardens are really beautiful. Spirit of Ramoji is a must watch.Bird park is really well maintained and again a must watch"
56,Awesome place but avoid holidays,This is a highly recommended and must visit place in hyderabad as it gives great view and scenes of indian cinema.
57,World Class Fantasy,It is a nice place and it is a little expensive one . We can find different film sets and arts and shows .
58,Wholesome family fun though a money grabber,"It is huge place but if they are managing the bus tour+timing of shows than you can visit the whole place in one day. We missed 2 shows,as most of the shows starts after noon and they starts together. so even if you skip your lunch, you will not be able to complete all the shows. Food was not so good.They should write some descriptions at the locations about which movie shot happened over there, they can also put the photographs  of that scene. So we can have some idea about it. They are giving information in the bus but sometimes its in different language and sometimes its not audible. There are stops where we have to wait for buses to arrive, they should have shades over there,its too hot and very hard to wait for buses.Rides were ok."
59,Not so friendly,"We hv enjoyed lot. very nice experience we have. recommended to all. Ramoji Film City is the one of the biggest film city in the world, Plz go and must visit."
60,Excellent Tour,It is unique. It is well planned & gives you an insight into all aspects of film making. It is preferable to opt for the AC Bus Tour because of the Hyderabad Heat unless you are used to it or hail from a hotter region. A suggestion for Ramoji - If the audience get to see one odd live shooting - it will add to your clientele.The food provided at the restaurants inside & the tour guides were very good.Special thanks to tour guides Ms Uma Rani & Ms Monica Dubey who took pains to make the trip interesting - Well Done- Keep Up The Good Work!!
61,Must visit experience @ Hyderabad,"We had visited Ramoji Film City on a day tour during our holiday in HyHad a great time here. Indian Universal Studio. Everything is nice here. Food, tour guide, location and activities inside."
62,Trip to Ramoji Film City,Ramoji Film City is worth visiting for lovers of Indian cinema. It makes for an interesting day trip when in Hyderabad.
63,Nice visit,Ramoji Film City is the most costliest place to visit in Hyderabad. Public buses from Secunderabad comes to place. Entry fees to this place is huge.
64,Good value for money and must watch in Hyderabad,"A wonderful place and one I would suggest travellers to Hyderabad to visit. Take the AC Premium tour because it is definitely worth it. Our guide, Mr. Sathish Kumar, was truly wonderful."
65,Okayish day outing,An Amazing Landmark of Hyderabad. Created with Creativity and Care. Must Visit with Family and/or Friends.
66,Ramoji film city,The place is extra ordinary for any movies lovers and gives you memories of so many films and the way they use such sets to portray diffrent situations
67,Very good experience ,"Ramoji Film City is spread across 2000 acres of land and needs at least 3 full days to visit all parts of it fully - in the words of the tour guide.We had booked the most expensive tour from the official website considering that we would be moved around in an AC bus in the heat (it was during May, and summer in Hyderabad in May can be brutal). It was a good decision as the few minutes in the bus gave respite from the heat and most of the entry tickets and our meals were taken care of.I am not sure if you can visit inside without an organized tour, but even if you can you would need to buy entry tickets at different places. Not to mention you might get lost driving on your own - No you cannot walk and visit the entire place!The film city has a few adventure rides and many film sets. There are some permanent sets that get painted and customized every time as per requirement - for example a railway station, the streets in Europe or mythological palaces. Then there are vast empty spaces where temporary sets are put up and removed, such as the Bahubali set which still stands owing to the interest in tourists. I guess it will be brought down only when they run out of space. There are restaurants, cafeterias and washrooms and drinking water are available at every few meters. There are many photo spots and also a few parks. You can also witness theater, multiple forms of dance, learn about film-making and witness a carnival in the late evening.The most commendable thing about the film city is the focus on an overall experience and keeping you engaged all day. You will definitely take back some good memories with you.Tip: Don't drive, they already have a lot to make you tired. Take their shuttle service to and from the city and opt for a guided tour inside."
68,Amazing!,It was a great experience to visit Ramoji Film city. One day would be not enough to visit entire place. However if one has limited time and budget can cover 80 to 90 % if well planned.
69,Visually delightful,"This is a huge film city , with two guided tour, studio tour and bahubali / eco tour. But this is not very planned w.r.t to old people , young couples with kids. Extremely exhausted and also not friendly for people in wheel chairs. Staff is good in speaking but can't help you much very process driven as where bus will drop and pick."
70,"Don't expect it to be Universal, but still worth a visit","This place is unreal! Shows such a beautiful aspect of the movies we see in theatres! Very clean and well organized. The Baahubali set is love. Take care of food though, not many options once the internal tour starts."
71,Paisa vasool,Very popular and one of the most visiting place. So many people are coming from different places. Good
72,Visited Ramoji film studio,Film shootings and other fun activities conducted over there is best one to visit with family. Since it is a vast area to look on need to have patience.
73,Ramoji film city Hyderabad ,"Classmates with spouses , numbering 40, visited this place for a day. On the whole it is an enjoying experience. A well organised conducted tour right from reception to departure. It is worth spending a day with dear ones. Lot many things are there to see. Whole concept of this city is appreciable. One interesting spot is film Bahubali Settings.One wonders how  the film is finally made looking at the setting created/seen here. One can surely visit this place with friends /families."
74,For Filmi Fellows,"If you visit Hyderabad do spare time and visit ramoji city. one of the modern studio of international standard,"
75,Awesome ,We took Ramoji Film City tour on 23/12/19 for a day. We were 25 persons and enjoyed the tour very much. The shows like Stunt and shooting process are quite entertaining. Good value for money.
76,Must visit in Hyderabad,"This place is superb! Shows such a beautiful aspect of the movies we see in theatres! Very clean and well organized. . Take care of food though, not many options once the internal tour starts.there are very picturesque tourist attractions."
77,queue queue and only queue,"Had a great time here. Indian Universal Studio. Everything is nice here. Food, tour guide, location and activities inside. Complimentary given. Only don't go during summer. Bad choice."
78,Ramoji Film City,I wanted to visit this place to see what is the hype about this place.  Its worth visiting for 1 time.  Nothing too great
79,Terrible,"Good place to hangout with family. Good place , it's a beautiful place with have almost every facility"
80,""" INDIAN UNIVERSAL STUDIOS""","Ramoji film city is one of the prominent attractions in Hyderabad. If you are a movie buff and interested in watching movie sets, it is a good place to visit."
81,International standard Filmcity,Visit to Ramoji Film City is a life long memorable experience. It is a must visit if you are in Hyderabad. Lovely live shows exhibited by staff of Ramoji. It is spread in 1665 acres having 7500 staff working in it.
82,Wonderful Experience,"We went to spend the day at Ramoji film city and were pleasantly surprised with the class of this place.. It matches many similar tourist places abroad. One day,  eventually seems less, for seeing this place in entirety.. Must visit if traveling to Hyderabad"
83,Good 1 day Outing,"RFC ramoji film city is best attraction in the City Hyderabad.lot of travel options are there since its available on the national Highwayalso, One can visit Ramoji from any part of the city using metro. Metro reaches till LB nagar, you can take any bus or auto or car for hire and reach RFCi decreased one star for this because, inside, you dont find good food at meaningful price. that is the only bad thing. Water is available almost everywhere for free but food is costly and not tasty."
84,Average attractions. too much hype.,if you are visiting this film city which is spread over 2600 acres then you need to ensure that you reach their well before 9:30 a.m. so as to cover the entire property. The ticket cost approximately rupees 1100 and includes few complementary shows and rights. At first they will drop you at the place where complementary shows are available you can watch all the shows here which are good.  after completing the shows the a lot of restaurants nearby and you can choose to have your lunch at one of this restaurant and then go on the film City tour where a bus and guide will be available. Post this they will drop you at the games area where complementary games will be available. I believe that summer and winter carnival which is the best time to visit these places and their accommodation inside the property as well. please note that you will not be allowed to visit any of the shooting locations where film shooting will be going on and if you want to watch the movie shooting then this is not the place to go.
85,Not Worth the hype,"Wonderful experience , ""Really beautiful"" , your tour of Hyderabad never complete without Ramoji Film City , must visit this place for a tremendous experience . Please visit this by vintage bus for excellent view ."
86,Good place,It is the Biggest Film City in the World. Very well organised and developed. Ramoji is A must visit for a full tour. It has lots to offer for every age be it theme shows or rides for childrens or films sets to see how movies are shot or be it the exoctic bird parks. Must Note : Wear comfortable clothes and walking shoes its a huge area to walk around.
87,Amazing experience,"This is one of the attractions as to why people visit Hyderabad. The ramoji film city experience is second to none and you get to experience in actual as to what and how film shootings are done and how film sets are created to make it look real for us on the cinema screen.If you are going for the first time then I would suggest you go in for their premium package. The package includes a guided tour in an air-conditioned bus, chocolate boxes, buffet lunch (the course is huge from desserts to the main course to starters). They will assign you a guide who would be there with you through the entire journey and inform you of each and everything.Do not forget to visit the baahubali film set where you will get to experience all the things that were used to shoot both the parts. From the throne that was shown to the prison, everything is kept intact. And it's really a wonderful experience to see the set and get an overview of how film shooting is done. Then there is also a bird park where you can see a huge variety of birds from all over the globe. Also if you are interested you can get a photo clicked with a parakeet sitting on your hand.If you are a person who loves adventure sports then do visit Sahas where you will experience the finest adventure sports and which is also included in the ticket cost if you are taking the premium package. All in all this experience is like no other and you should start early in the morning to reach here by at least 9.30 in the morning so that you get sufficient time to complete the entire tour."
88,Not worth,Well structured place with all attractions for kids and teenagers. Food is bit expensive as they don’t allow outside food we have no choice but to buy from them only.
89,Fun way to spend the day!,"I had been to Ramoji previously but this time with my family, kids and parents. the services are improved a lot. Worth a visit to this place. The SAHAS was thrilling, the gardens, the act and since it was mothers day special, watched dance programmes."
90,Amazing experience and a must visit ,"Ramoji film city is all about the movies, shooting spots and movie sets that include many popular hit movies. Even Bahubali set also can be viewed. Enjoyed the complete day. Inside the studio they provide vintage style buses to cover all the studio for free of cost( There is no fee for inside buses). There are many new things. Apartment style structures readylily avaialble for shootings. Village style set that has small houses. Foodcourt is good. The food is also good. There are two star hotels called Tara and Sitara. There is Airoplane and airport set, Railway station set with train and railway station. These are only things that you must not miss to visit."
91,Largest Film City in the World,Very helpful and cordial people giving service in the film city. One can come to know how actually a film is made and what is the important role of people not only onscreen or behind the screen.
92,Wonderful experience. Worth going..!!,"Love to have here, amazing city lasts 2-3 days to explore all the attractions. Must visit place in Hyderabad. You will never get disappointed."
93,A must visit !!!,"Ramoji film city is a must visit when travelling to Hyderabad. It is the largest film city in the world and as expected it is impossible to see all the attractions inside within a few hours. Initially a bus takes you within the premises. You can watch the shows on film making, action adventure, sci fiction, etc. Each of these shows is brilliant. You can then get on the red Ramoji buses which take you around to the various film sets created. You can get down at specific points and explore and take pictures. There is also a park for children with rides and other adventure activities. There are a few rides for adults as well. Overall, it was a very fun filled day. The entire film city is very well maintained. There are 4 restaurants and several cafetarias inside, which are very reasonably priced and food quality is good."
94,A very interesting place for full day time pass,"There are many attractions to see like- Sets including Bahubali- virtual flight/train, station etc. good to see how movie shootings are done- many games for entertainment and - many places to have photo shoot"
95,Ramoji,Must visit place.  Staff is very courteous & cleanliness is superb .enjoyed a lot with friends.  Lovely place.
96,Film city,well worth a day trip. Excellent management and setup for visitors. Had a lovely day out. The place is very well designed with good areas to visit
97,"Must see place in Hyderabad, but only once I will prefer",Ramoji Studio is a wonderful place to visit. There are various tours and shows. You are taken to various sets including the famous Bahubali set. The shows are amazing and it takes you entire day to visit and experience the entire place. All in all its worth a visit atleast once.
98,Film City tour on bus is great experience,"We took the premium tour and that was easy and sufficient in my experience. Our guide Karthik is funny  and experienced, handle the tour smoothly. The whole experience was smooth, and we didn’t miss any of the promised item in the tour. Special mention to all the performers in the “ spirit of Ramoji” they are well trained and professional. I would say that the experience and cleanliness in Ramoji city is a bench mark for the rest in India to follow."
99,Excellent place to spend your day,"We had visited Ramoji Film City on a day tour during our holiday in Hyderabad. We had booked tickets online through Makemytrip priced at 1150 rupees per person and collected physical tickets from the counter at Ramoji Film City. Once inside the gate, a bus took us to the actual amusement park area. There was a grand welcome show with song and dance at 9.45 am. Next we boarded their red bus for a grand tour which took us to different locations like Bahubali movie set, Japanese Gardens, London street, Butterfly park, Bird park, Kripalu caves and many more. In the 2nd half we attended different mind boggling shows out of which the best was the Spirit of Ramoji show. In between we squeezed time for burgers and fries. To sum it up, this was surely one of the great experience to cherish for a lifetime."
100,Impressive,if you are in hydearbad and you didn't visited ramoji film city  then its waste of visiting hydearbad ...ramoji film city is best to visit and spend whole day....
101,Great!,Spread in over 600 Acres of land- Complete film city in it with all the facilities. Very well organised and excellent facilities. You take a bus ride and get dropped at next stop for visiting and you could spend any time that you like to be picked up by next bus- very efficient services. Stud show was disappointing- average but the show in Alam Panah theatre- beautiful girls with classical dances was great- would recommend for visitors
102,Wonderful place to visit,"Can never see an other place like this, a huge place with lot of attractions. Its far from the city with bit high price but its totally worth of it. Can go with family, friends, colleagues. Should have lot of energy to enjoy. Bus facility is there inside which helps a lot to roam inside"
103,Good Attraction,The best place to vist in hyderbad and its too huge to coverall the place since the ramoji city and they have well maintained.its worth every penny
104,Tour,A must visit and recommended for everyone as it gave great view of sets of Indian cinema and their background.
105,Nice place to spend time in a group,Good location well maintained very good services given by Ramoji city staff different types of birds in birds park  including good food in restaurants our guide ms.uma from Ramoji Film City had given good information and covered all the location including shows in Ramoji city
106,Excellent place,"Trip experience was very good.  places like bahubali set ,gardens, bird park and butterfly park  , sahas adventure park , and rides are the ones one shouldn’t miss"
107,Visit best place in India,Its amazing place. Value for money. Should visit atleast once. Its huge and has so many things to see and enjoy. Should go early so that you can enjoy all the places
108,awesome experince,"We went here on a Sunday and entered late (almost 1pm). Saw some shows Filmi duniya (average), movie making (good), borasura (average), stunt show (average).Food we had at alampana which was good. Cons-1. If u have a kid who is less than 13 years then it's total waste of money as they can't enjoy most rides. Some rides allow kids above 5 years.2.The toilet is stinky and not maintained neatly. 3. The staff and the entertainment people are so exhausted that they don't respond well and act well. 4. If you go by 4 to the backlot tour, they will stop you and you can take pics. 5. Everyone have to exit by 6pm.6. You can't complete the whole tour at once,  you need to do twice. 7. You need to be there by 9 am to cover most of it. 8. The buildings are not really well maintained, they need to maintain it. Well do enjoy if you are going there."
109,Superb and Huge,Your kids will love it. Actually there is something for everyone. Its a huge huge park with unending activities. Do stay here for the show that happens late in the evening
110,Hopeless....total waste of money and time,We visited here on 10/03/2019. We had taken premium A/C bus package. It was nice experience overall. But this becomes too much rapid fire and if someone is photo maniac then he won't get enough time for clicking own pics.
111,Good one day time pass,"Visited in month of September and most interesting place ever, sahas activities are awesome. One day trip is best in hydrabad. Easy to book and coopretive sfaff good maintenance"
112,Gigantic 1666 acres,"If you are in Hyderabad, would recommend visiting this place.you will get a glimpse of a magic of movie making.. Don't compare with Disney studios etc as this is a commercial place for film making.   The cultural shows are well presented by the artists but can add more aura to the fleet.The lighting show is not a very fantastic or at  world class.but ok!! There are various shooting sets on display and the worth mentioning is the ""Bahubali set ""on display that left me in awe.."
113,Ramoji Film City - More fun & More Entertainment,"Ramoji film city, is considered to be a MUST attraction in Hyderabad. However, if you wish you may skip visiting this place. It's practically  a one whole day trip, without much entertainment quotient. This offers you some glimpses of the film making world, but not much. One of the best part is that prices of food and eatables inside are reasonable and pocket friendly."
114,"Value for money, well maintained structures","Whole day in ramoji is less .its very huge..shows,carnival,sets etc.are very nice.. you will enjoy in ramoji..food is also yummy in sangam resto"
115,Ramoji Film City,"Its a good place for one day trip to visit overall place. Very interesting to see how the places looks in actual film, can recollect all movies which had shootings at respective places in Ramoji.Apart from that it has nice park for Birds to see different varieties of them in world.It has amusement park for the fun for kids only.One good thing is they have provided free purified water at so many places and no need to spend money for the water."
116,Nice,"I had visited Ramoji on Dec 26 with family.It was a really good experience.We had opted for noon fiesta premium package.Overall experience was very good  and with the premium package we got  express entries to the shows and all.Also the tour was a guided tour.Film set visits were via AC buses.Premium package included buffet dinner from their restaurant,also there was a complimentary tea/coffee,tetra pack juice refreshments.Bahubali set is a must visit.Also the evening carnival was also nice.Also there were Bollywood dance performances which were of very good standard"
117,Nice,"Film city is a wonderful place to visit,  but once with elderly people as they have to walk a lot inside the campus.  It's a must watch place for all. Food is a challenge as outside food is not allowed and the quality of food inside is not that great. Overall a nice place and if you're traveling with friends,  then one can visit multiple times.."
118,Must visit,This place is one of the best places i have visited so far.. beautiful landscapes keep u mesmerizing at every corner of the place..movie settings are simply awesome..it takes 2 complete days to explore RFC..if u r lucky enough we can see film stars at shoot which happens everyday almost
119,GREAT... MIND BLOWING,Very spacious concrete jungle with lots of fun and cinematic studios. Well maintained World's largest studio. Must visit place in HYDERABAD :)
120,beautiful trip,"Whether you like films or not, you will enjoy your day at Ramoji Film City. We traveled on a festive star package and we were given an AC bus with a guide. Only thing we didn't like was that the day started late on their side and then they started hushing up with all sightseeing, thereby giving us less time everywhere. Otherwise worth a visit."
121,Exploring Film making experience,"Ramoji Film City is the best tourist places in India. Bestbus.in Providing Bookings an Official Authorized website for Ramoji Film city Entry Tickets, and Bus Tickets, Hotel Bookings,"
122,Awesome,It's a huge place of approx 600 acres with lots of structures but need to renovate because nothing new
123,All in one entertainment place,"We were in a group, kids, teens, adults. We enjoyed a lot. It has good restaurants to eat out n sit. Avoid to take 55+aged people with you or if anyone have physical health issues. Buses are available, but you have to get down , walk around and then board the bus at many places. It is very close experience with how films ate made."
124,The Must Place To Visit in Hyderabad,"Ramoji Film City is a place where one is able to see the beautiful imagination of human being as how he/she can create a wonderful world of places from the world at one place and not only that but amazing replica of human in the form of moving statues relating to their history and culture.You will be shown breathtaking film sets alongwith shows as how the movie is made including sound effects directions etcYou will see landscaping ,birds from different countries,flora and fauna and some lovely restaurants and outlets for delicious food.And at the end you will be entertained by dance and musicMust visit to see the largest Film City in the world"
125,Nice visit ,The Ramoji Film city is a famous tourist attraction in Hyderabad and was one of its first kind to be opened in India.. One can actually spend a whole day here. The entire complex is very well maintained with lots of rides and shows going on.
126,RFC - Largest Film City in India,"The place is so big that 1 day is not enough to explore it entirely. It has shooting places , amusement rides , scary house, thrilling rides and whatnot. There a lot of options to eat around here. Definitely recommend going here with family."
127,Visit to Ramoji,We all know many films are shooted here. That's the reason we went there. And experienced a wonderful day.
128,Film city at it's best,"Not necessarily the best/must visit place in Hyderabad. Good for one visit Bollywood movie freaks will love it though. Train station set was good, looked absolutely real. Bahubali set is worth visiting. Other highlights were bird park, caves & movie making show. A Well organised place."
129,The huge place,"Ramoji Rao’s vision translated into an epic film studio with a amusement park and lots of things to see. Not even close to Hollywood Studios, however, a commendable effort in the Indian Context. The treat was the Bahubhali set and the nice Indian Buffet. Away from the city and Airport. Internal travel and logistics were something to crib about, but overall a great outing for the family.To do once if you’re visiting Hyderabad.See the bird park, Butterfly Park too."
130,Blend of Adventure and Peace,"RFC is very famous in entire india , agood place for fims making, many services they provide for film makings, a very big location."
131,Relaxing & Amazing Vacation with family,One of its kind in india.Spread over 1666 acres.Films sets and gardens to explore.Sets are made of fiber and boards.overall must visit one.
132,Hi,"Film City is certainly worth visit. Bahubali Set, London Street, bird watching and butterflies was a wonderful site. Ample parking and good availability of clean rest room"
133,Visit to Ramoji Film City ,"It's been certified by Guinness World Records. Hyderabad's one of the famous tourist places one must visit to. However, avoid in summer.Weather will be too hot to enjoy the place. Place is good for photography as well and there are no extra charges for DSLR up to 18-55mm."
134,Review on Ramoji Film City,"It is far away from the city, an individual can make time for a hole day to enjoy here n have a great experience"
135,Too good!,"It was the best experience of stay in Hyderabad, and was a day well spent with spouse, on 5.10.2019.The property is well maintained and visit is an experience which can not be described in words.The gardens,sets, studios,as well as the shows hosted are awesome.We saw the shows hosted as well as the other parts including Japanese Garden etc and can only say that if given a chance, visit should be repeated."
136,Superb,"Nice memories at the film city. Except for the extreme heat of Hyderabad's noon time and the lack of good food arrangements there, there was nothing to complain. Enjoyed the nice shows and came back with good memories."
137,Leisure.,"It's must place to visit and enjoy the cinema different scenic places and you will get most of the views as you travel around the places (BUS to take tour) in the film city. Note, outside food not allowed."
138,Ramoji film city,Ramoji Film City is a full day excursion .. u can be stunned if yiu see the film sets .. and will understand why all the streets and all railway platform look similar in films... They bring a clarity to your perception towards the stories of bollywood movies.. I mean u will fell amused .. the bird park is a treat to nature lovers
139,Interesting,My trip was fortunately on 1 week after Diwali and a special lighting and Carnival arranged. otherwise also a very good place to spend a day.
140,Visit to Ramoji film city after conference,U can spent whole day in Ramoji film city. Currently Bahubali set is there. U can enjoy the palace. U can see how a film make also with demo.
141,Ramoji Filmistan,"Ramoji film city tour was good..however the weather even in February is so hot..d kids got tired with the walk at certain places....the only AC restaurant was crowded to the brim...fewer planned trees and seating places...more trees could make the place cooler...the shows are very good...movie making, lights camera action, space yatra were interesting...the kids loved dadajin and borasura....will recommend you plan your visit in the cooler seasons to make the experience pleasing..."
142,"Star Experience at Ramoji , Superb experience",It is very bad place to visit. Useless place and waste of money and time. Show's are totally use less.
143,Good place for a day long outing,A full day outing of viewing film shooting places at Ramoji. Interestig to see how the same buildings are used for different films. The conducted tour was interesting. The Butterfly and Bird Parks were well maitained & labelled.
144,Too Far.  But worth a Visit,"As the name suggests,it is basically to film makers where u can have replica and sets of any location.One day is not enough to pay the visit to all the places in it and it spans over few hundreds of acres."
145,Film city,"We visited Ramoji recently with some family friends on a Monday as reviews recommended avoiding the weekend crowds. I’ll break this review up into the approach, the experience of shows, dining & the return. The Approach. Booking tickets was a smooth affair from their website and we drove over in our own vehicle. From the moment we reached the approach roads we started getting impressed by the obvious structure & planning associated with the place. Good well paved roads, landscaping, direction pointers & security at regular intervals to provide any guidance. On reaching the entrance (~10:45am) we were directed towards an ample parking area space. Hopped across and picked up our tickets from the dedicated internet booking ticket queue at their well marked ticket center and were directed to the transport area. A quick walk (really just across the road took us to the entry area where we waited in Q for ~5min before going through a standard movie theatre style security check then thru the turnstiles (8x to manage the crowds). The waiting area for the buses that take you to the actual park had a short dance program going in to get us in the mood, good clean toilets a couple of small kiosks for caps, souvenirs etc. We were soon ushered into well maintained buses that drove us into the actual park. This I guess helps Ramoji ensure crowd control and keeps all the traffic away from the actual park. Smooth!!Coming soon ... the experience...."
146,Amazing Experience,"Excellent place, excellent experience and excellent tour guide Mr. Motiram, great guy, great sense of humour. A must visit place."
147,Awesome Trip,"Give it an entire day for the film city is big.amazed to see the architecture ,designs and works been done here.movies shot here need nothing more.i were lost when i saw The film city"
148,Dreamland for Movie lovers,"Ramoji film city offers a well organized tour with buses plying from one drop point to other very frequently. The place offers a glimpse of common shooting locations, interactive shows, scary rides, flora and fauna, reasonably priced good quality food, access to cloak room, and guides that explain all about the place - all at a very decent price. It's a must visit."
149,Consultant ,Being a tourist spot.All the guides and show hosts all speak only in Hindi and Telugu.No English at all.Tough to enjoy if you doesn't know Hindi.Atleast it should be in all three languages.But only Hindi and Telugu and I couldn't understand anything that they shared by the studios legacy.
150,"Lights, Camera .. Action 🎬",Must to do while you are in Hyderabad. Plan one full day activity as so much things to see and activities to do. This place entertainers not only kids and teenagers but to all age groups. Well organized guided tour and memorable experience from the moment you step in until you leave the place. Whole property is very well maintained. Plenty of photo options for photography lovers.While we come across each sets it reminds of some movie of any Indian language. Highlight is Bahubaali set for our group. Lot of walking involved inside but great experience.Definitely with high standards and competitive comparison with other similar concept around the world. It was not really fully crowded probably because of school examinations time and week day as well. Great memorable experience. Descent food options available inside at decent price range. Definitely 5 stars and each penny worth spending.
151,Filmy Dunia,No doubt in all the years Ramoji filmcity has its own charm. Visited.many times but this time with young children along with my friends but enjoy and fun all same compared to my last visits.
152,Great place for a one day family (or friends) tour,"Huge complex with good facilities, shows, restaurants and friendly guides. We went on a hot day, took the premium ticket with make my trip at a decent discount. So, the visit was worth it. Got to look around in an AC bus. The lunch that came with the ticket was extremely good. The gardens are well maintained and eye catching. The lighting systems after darkness falls are amazing to watch. The Bahubali set was lacklustre as there was some work going on and wasn't completely full of awe."
153,Good for film lovers,We went there in a group along with 2 kids and we enjoyed a lot. A lot of things to see and explore. Lot of option for food and activity. Even entire day was short to cover the whole place. Worth going. Better stay there for 2 nights and explore the place.
154,Visit to Vasundhra villa at Ramoji Film City,What a place Ramoji Film city. No words to describe the experience. Amazing...Some tips that will improve your experience.1. We booked a Ramoji Bus to pick up & drop from Hyderabad.2. Reach there by 9:15 am. Their welcome ceremony starts around 9:30 and dont miss.3. Enjoy your shows till 1:00 pm and tried to attend maximum. Every show is wonderful.4. Around 01:30 their bus trip will start.5. Dont carry extra water with your self. Facility of drinking water is very easily accessible every where.6. Outside Food and Snacks are not allowed but their canteen is there with reasonable price.Very good management.
155,Full enjoyment,Huge area..Very costly tickets..Universal studio of Singapore is much better.Only visit and view sets. ... Not much entertainment.. overall good and one can visit once ..
156,Beautiful vast setup ,"It is largest film city int the world, One whole day was not sufficient to cover everything. There are many attractions, games, food and shows. Ideal weekend getaway for Hyderabad people. Entry fee was around Rs.1,000 without the adventure games. Travel within studio will be by the bus. Tip: Do stay inside and go for 2 day trip instead of the one if you can't visit again as one day will not be sufficient to visit."
157,Fantastic Family day out,"Very nice historical place, feeling good to see this place, this very place and very natual. Feeling awasom"
158,Worth money,"Ramoji film city provides an unique experience for its visitors and is a must see @ Hyderabad. About an hour’s drive from city, it’s spread over 2000 acres and includes live studio floors and many sets/ locales/ shows for visitors. I recommend doing the VIP / Privilege tour to do justice to the spread on view in a day. This will start @ their VIP lounge, AC bus guided tour and yummy lunch and reduced walk and priority view for their shows - double the regular price, but worth it given the great experience and the effective and optimized itinerary. The Bahubali set property is the highlight. Unlike Universal studios ( and for better) you get to see mostly ‘ behind the scenes ‘ experiences. There is a separate paid enclosure for adrenaline activity. Be there @ 9 am to view the inaugural welcome show. During winters, there is also a closing parade on offer."
159,Excellent,"Worth visiting once if you are in Hyderabad.. Opulent set ups and Great guidance... Had a great tour... So much to do, even a day seems less. . Fantastic for families and friends.."
160,Ramoji Film City,"Nice attractions, they recently opened bahhbali attractions, kids enjoyed yet, will visit again, kudos"
161,Great place to visit,Great experience to visit to shower praise for a great initiative by Ramoji. A great display of art and culture and contributions to Society.
162,A Must Visit Place,"One of main attractions to visit while you are in Hyderabad. Plan in advance for a dedicated full day to visit the place. You can book the ticket online and it is worth the price. Film City tour on bus is great experience. It was nice visiting Space Yatra, Bahubali Set, Japanese Garden etc. You will find many permanent sets ranging from railway stations to temples. Easy to reach from Hyderabad with options like bus, uber and other taxi services. There are hotels available inside Ramoji Film City for stay."
163,Probably the only place worth visiting in Hyderabad!! Very nice!!,"It's a wonderful place to visit if you love films, you can encounter live shoots, learn about film making. Even if you do not love films do visit it and stay there, clean air, lush green surrounding and good place to relax and unwind, do meditation and walking."
164,Good time to spend !!!,Claimed as a largest film city complex in the world. Worth spending time. We took Day Tour normal package. Very well maintained complex with good number of support staffs who guides and helps at every moment. Very spacious food courts with good options and reasonably priced. Space Yatra is not good. Kids rides are fine. Overall excellent place to visit
165,A Magical Experience,"There is something for everyone such as Play area for kids, Japanese Garden, Bahubali Set, Mahabharat Set, Kripalu cave, Bansai Garden, for animal lovers there is bird and butterfly garden,  etc. for entertainment dance show, laser show, action show etc. and also plenty of tasty foods, drinking water,washrooms available."
166,A magical film studio,"We kept one full day for ramoji film city.we had purchased our tickets online and immediately went inside.it took us one hour to reach this place from the city.from the gate you will be given a stamp to wear and buses will pick you up to the main entrance inside which is another 15 minutes.The main arena is called eureka and from here red buses will take you on a studio tour.they will cover sets of bhagabatham,north indian houses,railway station,jail,village sets,japanese garden,rajasthani fort,streets of london,airport set.Then there is a separate tour to eco parks and bahubali sets.the eco parks will cover bird park,butterfly park etc.then they will take you to movie magic where different rides and shows are there.we had to spend a long time in the queue so we could cover two shows.one is duniya dekho which was a boat ride and the other lights camera action which is very good.at the end if there is time watch the stunt show in wild wild west."
167,Ramoji Extravaganza,"This is a good place to understand how feature films are done, have a look at the film sets of famous films etc. Good one day outing with family. You can buy a package trip and the guide will ensure that you are taken care. Some of the shows can improve in the quality and content."
168,Good day out for movie lovers,A must visit place if you visit Hyderabad for the first time. Every time you go there a new attraction is added. Must visit sets of bahubali and opening and closing ceremonies.
169,film city,"The most mesmerising set I came across within this entire filmy city is the set of Mahabharata. it was like the same backdrops that I used to watch on the TV in my childhood. Takes a whole day to cover the entire place and it is worth visiting. if I am not wrong then it is the largest film city in Asia, so something to brag about as well for us."
170,"Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad","This is must place to visit. Route is so designed by management that you never get bored. visit to sets, parks, adventure zone, shows and carnival all were amazing. if you have to enjoy full city you need two days. Management should also issue combo tickets for two day which make Ramoji Film city even more attractive. Note staying inside Ramoji  Film city hotel is advisable"
171,Must visit for all tourists to Hyderabad ,A very well-maintained property.  You can't see any kind of rubbish inside Ramoji Film City.  The cleaning staff's are always on toes and active.  The result of their alertness is a clean and healthy area.  We enjoyed being here.
172,2 Days @ Ramoji Film City,"The Ramoji Film City in India is located in Hyderabad. Spread over 2000 acres,is the largest integrated film city in Telangana . It was built by Veteran Telugu film producer Ramoji Rao in 1996.This  is also a popular tourism and recreation centre, containing natural and artificial attractions, fountains, Bufferfly Garden, Beautyiful Birds gallery, Adventure seekers SAHAS(with ATVs, Net adventure, passwing through ropes over hilly terrain) and an amusement park.  Film production, editing and voice /music recording is well explained to the audience.  All the time over crowded,  There are good Restaurants within the Film city."
173,Must visit.. with family or friends,"This review provides details for stay in Ramoji as we had some difficulties getting this information before hand Stay - Vasundhra villa inside Ramoji Film cityDays -2Location - approx 5km from Tara hotel. To give you an ideaTara->Shantiniketan (behind princess street set) -> Central jail set -> Bahubali set> very large farm area> Vasundhara farm area and then comes Villai.e. completely isolatedVilla review- Clean and spacious. 6 BHK and every room is spacious to accomodate 3extra very easily. 24hours attendent. No kitchen except for microwave. 2 gauds at night to make u feel safe. Transport - mini bus/ car available on call. But u have to inform well in advance (30min to an hour) for pick up from Vasundhara. Best to have a private car .We initially thought food at Tara would be expensive but figured out it was not (around Rs 600/ couple) . To and fro could be a pain if u plan to do it multiple times a day.Food can be ordered from Tara but they them selves said it can take more than an hour to arrive even 2 hours so we didn't try at all. Quality of food is good and u can plan all ur meals here. U can also have food at the restaurant in park as there is no entry gate  where tickets are checked if ur staying inside. We had jain buffet at Chanakya and food was decent.We enjoyed swimming at Sitara ( free for Vasundhara guest). Best part was the sport facilities  they have like basketball , Tennis, squash, pool, table tennis, board games and we did spend couple of hours playing TT and tennis and enjoyed it thoroughly. This is a champion building next to Tara. We didn't get time to make it to SAHAS which is for adventure sports so no idea about that.We took a days tour on 2nd day and found bellow shows interesting - stunt show at wild west- filmy duniya- spirit of Ramoji- Bird park  ( lot of varieties and lot of them in open)- action show (can't recollect name) near filmy duniya- space yatra is decent if u havnt done those 3D rides at Disney land or universal studio- filmy set tour in open bus. You might choose not to get down at all the sets as it would then become very tiring. Frequency of bus is good and we didn't find that an issue on a Sunday in August. Overall we had a great trip and highly recommended for 2 night stay with family. The amount of area the film City covers is just too vast . We didn't get time to cover it completely on our 2 days visit.U might also find nice trekking points and its a good and safe area to explore on cycle too ( renting cycle is expensive at Rs 200/30min and i am not sure of the quality so if u have one do carry)The staff is very courteous and friendly. The biggest issue I faced was all the telephonic conversation with them before and at the time of visit. Would like to appreciate the hospitality offered by manager at Tara Mr. Zilani Shaik who ensured our trip was wonderful and ended well. Special thanks to him."
174,Memories😄,"Very nice and awesome layout. Clean air, good roads, greenary and trees and well maintained gardens and artistic parks. Some big tall trees give fragrances which is wonderful. Nice replicas of other overseas cities. Good conventional halls and airport replicas. Transport is an issue. Have to stick to the tour bus. Overall great."
175,"Interesting place, need one full day to spent here. Kids will like it",If you are planning to visit Ramoji just for the Bahubali set it is a waste of time .. most of it is already broken With elders this place is not advisable.as you have to walk atleast 7-8 km despite of busses Food in the AC restaurant is ok..they serve buffet ₹600 per head ..other restaurants it is ₹300 but food is not good there ..
176,Just the right place for family,"Most other reviews might have talked about all the attractions and great things that are there in the Film-city so I do not want to emphasis the grandeur or beauty of the place. Its very well maintained and nicely decorated. As I visited with family including two young kids I will rather explain few things that should know before you plan. The film-city tour done by red-bus is not like you sit in the bus and it goes every place. Instead one bus drops you at one location, you see it and move to next pickup point and catch another bus. During weekends and festival time due to crowd it may become bit tiring to run around here and there for the bus. Remember even though there is bus tour you need to walk atleast 6-7 km still and in hot weather of Hy'bad its very exhausting. People having trouble in walking, be careful one day completion goal wil bring your heart inside your mouth. For Jain followers like me, there is good amount of jain food available. There are many restaurants inside but I somehow felt food was pretty avg in quality and not lot many options were there. Photo clicks and prints are quite costly (as its on all tourist desti) better to carry your own camera. If you are planning a trip with family, plan on carnival timmings as it wil remain open till 8PM and lightings done in the evening willl blow your mind. For kids dont miss the UV light show and wild-west live stunt show. Opening and Closing ceremonies are great. Carnival parade is something you might not see anywhere in India. Ample food, water and rest-rooms all over the place. You dont have to struggle for any directions as they keep announcing where to go next or what show will start soon. Lot of help staff is spread across the 1666 acrs of land to guide you correclty."
177,Marvel with a connect to so many films,"This one you should not miss in Hyderabad, try to reach place by 9.30 am plan for the whole day till 6.30 pm.Never miss their shows they are very nice world class performance, nicely arranged the whole trip. Ticket price 1150 Rs for Adult and 950 Rs for children. Very nice open busses to roam inside, everywhere water facility, few places their are cafe's. Everything well managed worth to visit if you are in Hyderabad"
178,Package full of surprises,Travel in metro train and get free to and fro transport from LB Nagar and Nagole metro stations; and also get Rs. 100/- worth redemption coupon for each entry ticket.
179,Great experience ,"Attempt1: I tried reaching the airport counter for help on reaching the Ramoji film city, the guy was chatting with someone on phone, He didn't even want to help. He gave me the pamphlet and said all details are available here call the toll free. Attempt2: I called the toll free, I wanted to know what's the nearby point from my hotel where i can catch the bus to Ramoji. We didn't know which stop to goto as i was a tourist to hyd, I explained the same to her. She didn't have any idea of helping, she said ""refer the website"" and disconnected the line after 20 mins of waiting.Attempt3: We took a full day cab and shelled out 2k , then paid 2.7 k for entrance (for two).The park was good, well maintained and spread out. The bahubali set was the best. Sometimes we felt they forced ppl to see everything like seeing the butterfly garden and bird santury while we wanted to get to the bus."
180,Ramoji Film City visit,"Visiting ramoji film city is onenofnthe best experience i ever had. Travelling an an a/c bus throughtout, it was really a fantastic experience andnthe lunch we had was marveqllours. One full day we spent the filmncity and it was marvellous.. recommended to my froends in bharain about such a beautiful experience"
181,Visit to Ramoji Film City,Visited with family many times...The dance shows . Games... N all other shows are excellent..Had a great time
182,"Family visit consisting  of GrandParents,Parents,Daughters,Sons,Son-in-laws,Daughter-in-Laws","A memorable and life time experiecne o cinema world. Takes you to the making of cinemas, famous locations in cinemas and also if you are lucky, will get chance to meet few celebrities"
183,Must visit.,Good place. There are many sets which will take you down the memory lane. Place for pictures and selfies. Affordable restaurants inside. Wear comfortable walking shoes as we need to walk a lot.
184,Nice studio sets of Indian movies with great birds park,"Ramoji still holds a certain charm. We've been to this place thrice over the last almost 18-20 years and have seen it evolving.Driving distance from Hyderabad. Choose the weather carefully as it does involve some walking.Not a hard core theme or thrill park, it does have it's fair share of good rides, sprawling layout for kids, and a plethora of studio set ups. A lot of those studios are not used for films today, in this Digital animation age; however, it's fun to imagine how those props look so professional when shot by a good film crew.worth a  visit. there are passes of different types for speed and convenience.A good guide also makes a difference."
185,Ramoji Film City ! Worth a One Day Trip.,"Very good place to photoshoot. Rides and food is very good.Thriller rides, film shows, live shows best experience in filmy way😊"
186,Not as Promised By the Title,Overall its a wonderful place. Couple of words of advice... avoid holidays.. for us it was so crowded that we skipped more than half of the attractions. And secondly start early so that you can cover the complete place.
187,"Entertainment  ,  Adventure  ,  Enjoy",It carries the guiness world record as the large film City in the world. Most of the Indian movies are made here.
188,"A must see, at least once",Lots of shows in here can entertain people throughout the day in this place. It was fun and surprising.
189,Tour of Ramoji,"We visted ramoji film city in april 2019. The weather was hot and humid (dont forget your sunscreen). Their was opening ceremony with dholas being played. The experience was awesome. Visited  Bhahubali set and other sets, the shows were good. Their is a bird park. Different games and rides food stalls. Tatoo artist. Dance program all awesome."
190,Place need renovation,Awesome place for team outings.Mostly prefer going in winter season.Night stay is must to cover everything.Food is average
191,Day Outing best place,"It was completely very nice hotel compare to other hotels very clean and quiet,room ware very nice,  beautiful location in windows to pool, and entire film city was happily to enjoy my kids my family, all staff was very friendly and helpful us and I specialy recommend Mr. samsun housekeeping boy ,and I forgot so many people to say thank each and every one and thanks to sitara hotel."
192,A full day package.,One of the best in India and small review cannot influence you - visit to believe it and its not half day but one full entire day
193,sunny day,Great place to have fun & enjoy day with experiencing site set for shutting . various theme garden. Have look of bahubali set for selfie.Also enjoy sahas adventures activities . excellent location for picnic & get together.
194,Bets for one day outing,I like it very much very good shows and lot of places.  The red buses are very very good. The food is also good.
195,No Words....Simply Amazing.....,"A huge campus, beautiful sets, good presentation of art of film making, audience involvement, the full entertainment package. It's a full-day show, on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Must watch for kids. Descent food choices. Be cautious with elderly as they lack sufficient wheel chairs, support, elderly friendly ramps. Carry sufficient water and be prepared for a good walk and good time"
196,Wonderful experience,"Visited the place with bare minimum expectations and was thinking that the ticket rate was little high. But at the end of the tour, I was proved as wrong. Awesome place and the perfect maintenance all over the film city. Don't miss it. Its a life time visit. Plan for 2 days visit to have a better experience."
197,One Time Visit only,Fantastic experience easily one can spend 2 nights three days. Fantasy Land beautiful Light work. Larger than life experiences.
198,Good place to visit,It is a good day out to see a lot of things. It is very tiring to complete the whole city in a day. Food choices were very limited on the day of our visit.
199,Great experience,"It's a great place to pass ur time, it's huge... U gets lots of varieties, rides to ride on, lots of places to take pix, the addition not international birds has made it awesome... Haven't tried the off riding plus paint ball game, it's actually worth every single penny for people who don't want to go for harsh rides and enjoy clicking pix, music dance shows, comedy action shows, etc... It's pretty colourful area...Enjoy..."
200,Wonderful experience for entire family,"This was an fun way to spend a few hours. It is listed as the World's largest film studio, and indeed the tram tour dovers acres of land and a multitude of film sets. You can possible see ongoing filming and the attractions and occasional performers that you meet are entertaining.As an visiting American, I wasn't familiar with the films that had been made here, but nonetheless was impressed with the studio lots and the tram tour. Everything was professionally done and the staff was good about getting people back ontime after each stop. I note that the tour was not in English, but that didn't really affect my ability to enjoy and understand what we were seeing."
201,Worth it,"Excellent tourist place to visit,the shooting setups are excellent, especially the Japanese garden and Hawaii Mahal and OMG the Rajmahal set up of Mahabharata and Ramayana awesome,love to visit next time, though we spend whole of the day their but still it seems so many places are still left..."
202,Wonderfull full day trip,"After visiting this place, one thing I can say is, one cannot complete exploring this place in just one day. All age groups can enjoy and spend memorable time. Right from shootings going around, set-up for different acts, theaters, gardens, gallery and many more. The light show was amazing and a feast to the eyes."
203,"Very cool place for a perfect Outing with family, bit expensive","Its 1666 acres vast film city. Don't compare it with Universal studio, then you won't be disappointed.  Bahubali set is must visit, many identifiable shooting locations of Indian films.  Very well maintained but quality of many attractions can be made better."
204,Best place ramoji,"booking can be done on counter and best by taking sahas voucher also , one day trip best atomspher and nice ambiance , also after ending trip of ramoji city , you can take gov bus to back which is economical"
205,Tour experience ,A perfect location. Can't go Wrong. Good Accomodation at Sitara Hotel.Very courteous Staff. Brilliant management of activities. Kid's can have fun and parents can enjoy the long and safe walks. Perfect weather conditions in January. Minimum Two nights during the carnival Festival.
206,The best film city,Very attractive and great imagine unbelievable studios. Stunt show was excellent. Very large space in the worlds. At night entertainment was excellent. Parade was excellent and they did hard work to show all this. I will recommend my friends and family. Rasik shah
207,Full Day Entertainment,"Ramoji Film City is worth a visit. It would take more than a day to complete the total trip to the place. I visited the Butterfly Garden, which had lots of variety of butterflies. I also visited various other gardens and jail in the vicinity. It was a awesome experience. You can also visit Bahubali set.... I could not because some hooting was going on... It is amazing to see how it is a temple from one end and Masjid from the other.It is worth all the pennies spend. $D experience was also good."
208,awesome,"We visited on 28th dec 2019. Being an holiday season, it was over crowded meaning most places were filled to capacity. Due to same, we found most staff pushy and trying to push people away from crowded areas. Result is u may be asked to visit areas which u may not be interested in. Nevertheless, it is a must go place for film lovers.  Bahubali set, bus rides, sci fi films were good. We had food at sangam. It was average for the price. Lots of food stuff are overly price and not upto quality but they get away considering that outside food is not allowed.they should also improve on the joy rides which are very less and are opened in evening only."
209,Overall experience good,"3rd visit, every time I visited new things were added.Ideal place to spend the whole day.our trip started by 11 ended at 5.It's indeed a great experience nd learn a lot about film industry.Not advisable with kids as there are lot to see by walking.Take a bottle of water, there are refills available free of cost."
210,Must See Place,World calls film city I wish You to visit this Wonder on the Earth with Your Loved Once and family Members A great Place to visit I was enjoyed alot during my visit to this place and Make Your way to visit the place it's near to city and U will delighted after visiting it.   Thank You
211,Very large,"A wholesum family experience. Took the AC guided tour. Well informed guides, good locations and kids will have a good time"
212,A not so good experience...,We started the tour about 9AM and finish around 7PM. VIP tickets provided the AC coach travel. Tour started with welcome ceremony then to some of the mega Bollywood movies set. There were live musical shows and moving making show etc. lunch was included  and it was great. We thoroughly enjoyed the trip.
213,Good place but needs proper planning and time allocation,"The tour round the film city was intersting and a fun day out for all ages .The space yatra was interesting. The garden was beautiful along with the birds seen on the premises like swans, parrots ,ostriches etc.The cultural show was good. You need to get there early to enjoy the day"
214,filmy place of hyderabad,It's a good place to visit. First half is little boring (few shows) but second half is good which they cover by their buses. Need lots of walking to enjoy it thoroughly. There are two types of tickets. In my opinion general ticket is ok in winters as they are non AC. Overall…
215,Don't miss in Hyderabad,Must visit if you are planning a trip to Hyderabad. Would recommend to take a premium package if you are visiting over a weekend. Reach venue early by 9am to explore time at leasure.
216,Awesome place,"We opted for a one-day package.The whole place is well organized right from the entry. We were guided neatly by the staff in every place. The first step is a bus tour where you are taken along the places where usually the film shooting happens for different scenes. One staff explains as we travel along. We get down at one place, see around and then take another bus to go to another place. All these are neatly arrange without any confusion. The highlight of the visit was Bahubali set where we spent a lot of time.They also have other activities like studio attractions, wild west stunt show (this was just brilliant) etc., A surprising thing was the wide variety of birds they have in the bird park. If you are a bird lover, don't miss this! In the evening, there was a entertainment show followed by the carnival parade. Both of them were thoroughly enjoyable.This place has many more to its list of attractions.Definitely worth the visit.Tip:1. Better to go as early as possible as it gets crowded later2. If you are on one-day package and if you like to see stunts, cinema making etc., it's better to complete them first and then take the guided tour. Check for the bus timings also to make a decision3. The restaurants get very crowded during lunch time. Plan yours accordingly4. They have photographers. It is good to make use of them and get good photos (this is a paid service, but worth it)"
217,Good place to visit,It was a great experience being there . I had never imagined that films are shot like that every entertainer was awesome and every show was remarkable
218,It's an another world of movies and sgootings,"Sharing my experience of Star experience day tourism .Visited with family and friends during Onam holidays 2019 , to my surprise a lot of malayalis also have come from kerala to visit and enjoy Ramoji Film city .Booking can be done in advance via online or web app or the very day at the visit at the counters .Note : to enjoy entire package please be there by 9 AM to witness opening ceremony (this is for everyone)As promised by the iternary (more info section in ticket booking ) everything was covered.1.Enter the premier launge ,wait for couple of minutes to get your tickets followed by booklet of coupons 1a.

219,perfect one.....,"Visited with family in December 2019Pros:- Vast theme park with loads of different experiences. Requires entire day to cover everything- Audiences could also participate in one film making experience- Attractions suitable for both Adults and Kids hence a complete family package- Clean place and toilets- Buses to transit between 3 zones within the park- Winter Carnival was also worth exeperiencingCons:- Too crowded even on weekend- Requires lots of walking in harsh sun during the day (even in winters the sun is quite hard to bear)- No buses were plying between 7 and 8 pm during carnival show. This was really incovenient as we had an infant and really wanted to leave after initial 15 minutes of carnival but were stranded.- Butterfly park can be skippedsummary: Full paisa vasul experience, try it with your family but ensure you stock well on water n snacks for the day"
220,Super visit,"Loved visiting the place ... Suggest 2300 per head package should be taken , so that lunch and prioritised visits are organised. Visit to bahubali sets and the movie making auditorium were the highlights. Fodd was excellent."
221,One of the must visit in Hyderabad,One of my memorable trip. Really enjoyed trip with office friends. Will come back again if i come down to hyderabad
222,Must visit,"This place is perfect for a day trip.Make sure you are in your most comfortable outfit and footwear.It is spread across a huge area and every spot is amazing in itself.Don't miss the parade that happens in the late evening hours.It is too much fun.Do not dare to cover whole park on your own.They have buses running every minute which gives you complete tour from one place to another.Superb facilities with respect to food,water,washrooms.Instead of AC bus tours open van tours is more recommended. They have pick and drop facilities from different spots in hyderabad city.So avail those as its cheaper option compared to taking cabs."
223,Must Visit place,"It was a wonderful visit and our group had ages from 3yrs to 67 yrs, Its like our own visiting Studios seen abroad, more to our liking as its Indian. The best part is the settings maintained spick and span retaining their originality. The scenes from mahabharata with almost real statues of the actors in dynamic state, The Movie magic is wonderful and shows how movies are made, Last is in the evening the settings of brindavan garden, Space is not sufficient to describe all. Its a wonderful place to visit and keep the whole day for it."
224,Largest film studio in the world,This was money well spent. Kids loved it even though they could not enjoy all the rides. Experience of film making was also something new for them. Kid even participated in the film making.
225,Nice experience but Some management is required,"Full day affair, even if you are extremely confident of running around for a full 8 hours. Ramoji Film City cannot be clubbed with any other place on a day. Situated a good 40 kms away from the lake (which is the heart of the city), it takes about 1-1.5 hours to reach there. Once there you can forget about all the care in the world and become a child for the rest of the day. It's a lot of fun for children and adults alike."
226,New Bollywood Film City,If you have been to universal studios singapore or disney world then this is not the place for youA nice attempt though and its adviceable to take a guided tour rather than going in your own
227,Superb visit!,"The drive took about 50 minutes and to be honest we were expecting a mini Disneyland or Universal Studios - instead there were a couple of shoddy shows (Cowboy stunt and Making a Film, although the dance show was quite good.  The 'Thrill Rides' were the type of thing you find in a travelling fun fair !.  There was one motion ride, but again, if you have ever been to a theme park, imagine the most boring ride there and you have this motion ride.  For local people who have not experienced anything else, it was probably great, but for us it was a waste of time and money."
228,Certainly a one time visit!,A good one day trip but needs to work more to come in comparison internationallyThere is facility for stay hotel
229,Beautiful Movie shooting site,Very good experience for film lovers. Were shown many sets from the movies we had already seen. Food served was good. Although some rides were waste of time so had to spend unnecessarily whole day.
230,Perfect outing for kids,A well spent day in Ramoji Film City. We spent the entire day at leisure and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Their were food stalls across the entire route albeit a bit on the costlier side. The only drawback was that tea was machine made and the traditional Indian tea was missing.
231,Must Visit place in Hyderabad,A good place to visit. It takes almost full day to cover it. You will find all types of sets used for film shooting and other entertainment things.
232,Best Film City of India,"Very good experience. Right from the entry to the tours... Very well organized. Good food at reasonable prices everywhere.All places of interest had a food Kiosk, a drinking water place, toilets and people keeping the area clean.Sangam restaurant served good vegetarian buffet for 275 rupees only (with three veg dishes, Dal-rice, dessert and water) and another named Alampana had decent Dum Biryani for Rs. 250 (plus GST).There's pizza and pasta as well which our kids enjoyed too.The shows and rides are enjoyable. Well managed by the staff.A great place for a day out with family or friends of any age. There's something for everyone. Most impressive was the cleanliness.. one place in India where I saw people busy with keeping the premises clean and no gutkha or pan stains anywhere.The charges of Rs. 1150 might sound a bit high, but it's what you pay for a good time. Money and time well spent.Well done Ramoji Management!!"
233,Must place to visit,"We all know what is it. A day long experience visiting different movie sets is a fun experience with kids. Some things to note/improvement:- They do not allow any packed food for kids as well, which is bit of a low, so think about it if your kids are particular in what they eat. Shops inside the complex are typical snacks shops. Quality is OK, don't expect you will have a good lunch there. Even the restaurants are serving average food. All the shops inside are Ramoji's own, hence driving their revenue by blocking own stuff.- Bahubali set was one of the factor driving their rating but it was a big let down. A huge part of set was kind of destroyed. All the iconic items you seen in movie e.g. the statue, chariot or the face of the statue are broken or lying in a corner. Set itself is in an isolated area not cleaned. You will be disappointed from this section."
234,Fun!,It's an excellent creation by a person. Very vast area. You should reserve your tickets in advance via online and should reach there by 9am. U have to use there bus [a/c and non a/c] for reaching the film city from the front office. To view the entire place you had to stay for 2 days. Food quality is average and that too buffet in noon. Limited menu. Also guides need to be improved. We won't get enough time to enjoy the trip as they where rushing us to the next exhibit. Also photos were taken by professional people but getting the copies is very difficult and that too with very high price. Plan to stay for 2 days in their hotel and they will show the whole place with priority.
235,Film City,It's tough to write a review..It's a place where you will get physically tired but mentally you will remain overcharged..
236,Good for a Day visit...,Massive area with beautiful setups and location. Do have immense stamina to finish the tour it's tiring but at the end of the day u have innumerable memories of the place. Do get here as early as possible
237,Bahulbali set was very bad ! Waste of time ,"Although we had only 3 to 4 hours time as we had to catch our flight in afternoon but then also we visited the ramoji film city. The visit was very refreshing and entertaining. Though we had limited time, then also we visited all the main attractions like fundustan, parade, bhagwatam set,bahubali set, foreign locations set, butterfly park etc. Enjoyed the complementary rides with children. The breakfast at Dil se was good. Overall a good entertaining place to visit even if u have less time. If u know how to do time management. Though I think that a complete visit to this huge place may not be possivle in just a single day."
238,Okay but must visit.,"The tour to Ramoji via Premium class ticket is a bit expensive especially for the kids (i.e. Rs 2771 for adults and Rs 2550 for children) but the comfort in exploring the film city is unremarkable. We reached by 11 AM and the whole tour commenced in AC buses with priority check in all the shows and rides. The Spirit of Ramoji show is a must watch with mind blowing aerial dances. Moreover the bird sanctury, botanical garden and the carnival walk (last show at 7 PM) are like nectar for the eyes and soul. In short, you pay more in Premium ticket but you do enjoy and explore more"
239,Certainly not Disneyland !,"Basically 4 kinds of attractions. 2 can be avoided and 2 not to be missed.The shooting sets and the shows (like stunt show) is unique about this place and so not to be missed. Gardens, parks and rides are good.. but if you spend too much time there, you might miss the shows (i could watch only 2 out of 5).. of the 2, stunt show not to be missed.. so, get the pamphlet which gives the details about the places and plan your day. Shows are available only at specific timings - be mindful. First show starts at 9:30. If you want to visit each and every place, one day won't be sufficient. It is unfortunate that the day's pass (Rs. 1150 per adult) permits only for a day's visit. You can't pick and choose your visit for 2 days since 1150 is the bare minimum to be spent per person per day. Dil se offers balanced diet for lunch.. tasted like home food at affordable price. Lot of walking needed .. so choose the season.. restrooms, water, refreshment available at multiple locations.."
240,Ramoji Film City,"The largest film lot in the world, according to Guiness records, the studios cover over 1600 acres and has 47 sound studios. The park is pretty hokey, more for kids, and people who like Bollywood sets. It was Greek to me, and I was from Hollywood."
241,must see place if you are in Hyderbad,"The place is a well-balanced mix of adventure, theme park, fun, gardens, sets, bird sanctuary, and whatnots. The management of this place is super amazing. The film city is stretched over 1666 acres and yet you will never not find food items, water and loo. You can easily visit the place with a child without having to worry about feeding him as well. Highly recommended"
242,FAMILY VISIT TO RAMOJI FILM CITY-WORTH VISIT,"This is one of the time wasting places to visit for adults, just plain without excitement and not even worth the trip, there is nothing worth visiting or mentioning, time better spent visiting other places, just plain models of building, hotels, railway stations and assorted odds, we were not taken to any cine shooting being done. - can be safely left out"
243,Film city is fabulous,"We visited here on our kids birthday and this was an Apt gift for them. As we were lucky, it WAs Diwali time n hence we got to view the colourful, illuminated carnival parade as well which was a true delight. The entire RFC tour was also a fantastic experience and I must say it's so well managed. The other shows there were also a fantabulous experience to witness... Overall... Totally worth the amount you spend there...Loads to walk but the surroundings are beautiful and that makes the walk easier! We stayed there at Tara for a night and though the hotel rooms were really small, quite highly priced, but have to appreciate the staff there at front desk, restaurant and House-Keeping. A special thanks to Santosh M, asst house keeper who was very helpful in sending us back our daughter's favorite soft toy which we forgot back there in the room. It was efficiently couriered by him and that brought a big smile on my daughters face and was an a big relief for us."
244,one day tour full of entertainment & satisfaction must watch,"If you have kids then maybe this is worth consideration, but very few of the attractions are for adults. The gardens, used as sets for various films are perhaps the only point of interest for grown ups. The studio tours are honestly a waste of time, a quick bus trip around dilapidated film sets - literally falling apart in many cases - is only going to be of slight interest if you've seen and enjoyed the films shot there.The place is not wildlife photography friendly, although there is plenty of life to be see around the gardens, as lenses above 50mm are banned outright.I've been invited along a couple of times now by friends. I really think it could be interesting if they were to add some workshop type  events explaining how they approach set design and creation, costume creation, camera techniques and more but the closest you get is a kid friendly participation event of 1980s TV green screen and 1940s foley techniques. While it's described as a working film studio, it's much more accurate to say that it's a theme park built adjacent to what remains of that studio."
245,For Cinema Lovers,"Its a good place for a day out.. There a lot many things to see in their day tour of the different shooting locations... A must see is the spirit of Ramoji show and Lights Camera Action show...  Hotel stay inside was excellent.Terrible experience is: 1. They loot the visitors by selling 750ml water can for Rs.25 instead of 1litre or 2litre bottles which can be sold at lesser rate.. I should call them pick pocketers or beggars for this alone.2. They dont allow visitors to bring food from outside, and as of this they sell food at exorbitantly higher rates and the quantity of food purchased is less for this high price...   For a Rs.1150 ticket, they force us to spend another Rs.1000 for food and water in this hot season.3. These beggars charge Rs.950 for children and none of their rides are forsmall children. Small children again need to take paid rides in the premises... Children above age 12, 16 are allowed in the free rides like, break dance, frisby coaster, ranger, etc... I dont understand then why the ""f..k"" these beggars charge Rs.950 for children, instead they could have reduced it to Rs.500 or 400...  In places like Fundustan, and ramoji premises, they are having many rides which are again charged ones... if thats the case, why cantthey integrate a all inclusive ticket... Felt irritated on this...4. Another is SAHAS, Adventure park inside Ramoji... its a separate ticket... For attraction they offer a complimentary event for everyone which is the beginer level .. extreme levels are chargeable and the rates are so high, most of them are Rs.250 above and many are 650 and above. Dont take the big Bungie there as its cheating... They just tighten the rop and release it for once, for which they charge Rs.250/-..   ATV is good, but they cheat us by showing 400cc ATV and when starting ride they ask higher rate for 400 cc and give us 200cc for agreed rate... pathetic miscommunication.5. tea is another cheating and loot in Andhrapradesh, tengana and Tamilnadu...  People from Tamilnadu , AP etc come to Kerala and opens Tea and Vada shop and sell  each at Rs.5/-... and disturbs the similiar business of natives. But when we go to AP, Telengana, TN etc, these people sell tea in a bottle cap for Rs.15/- There was an instance where I had tea for Rs.30 and 60 /-...   Real nonsense... The quantity offere is 1/3rd of what we have in kerala for 3 times price...6. Food at Tara Hotel is too expensive... The room service menu of Shanthinikethan hotel is less that restauran Ala carte menu  of tara hotel.."
246,A must visit place,"Even though we are not film fans, this was a great experience to see behind the scenes of how ""sets"" are made and to realise that all that you see in a movie are not real. The idea has been well thought out and the tour is worth its money. Please plan to reach at least by 9.30 AM. Then only can you utilise the full potential (we reached by 11 and got to miss a lot). You need a full one day to go around and enjoy the different options. Need to say that the food was very good and reasonable. All soft drinks and snacks are available at MRP. Please carry water with you and ensure you have a cap. Though initially, you are taken on bus trips, you will need to walk around a bit."
247,A worthwhile full day outing that takes you to massive laid out landscapes,"To the Western World, Ramoji Film City is a gem waiting to be discovered. It is described as India's version of Universal Studios but it's really not the same thing. It is an enjoyable, family experience that takes you behind the scenes of the Indian Film and Television industry. You can step into legendary, awe-inspiring film sets such as that of Mahabharata,  Namaste England, Bahubali and more. But what nowhere else can touch Ramoji on is the magnificent, picturesque sceneries, of which there are dozens upon dozens. It is easy to get absorbed in each exhibit as you follow the tour routes, and each time you think you have reached a pinnacle. But then you move to the next location or attraction and it is even better than the one before. If you're not careful you can get so overwhelmed that you don't manage your time properly and then you don't get to see everything that the park has to offer.My advice is that when you arrive, go to the terminal on the lower level.. catch a tour bus and visit all the attractions on the route first. Then, when you return to base you can spend as much time as you like in the centre area where the attractions remain open much later and where there are amusement park rides for the kids and adults. Prepare to be blown away!!!!"
248,Filmy place,"I had visited RFC 20years ago for the first time. It was amazing to see how films are made and also got to see a set of a film shoot. Now after seeing many other studios and movie theme parks, this looks mediocre. I have not understood the intention of adding butterfly garden and a play area as it does not add much value for a film city. Instead more shows about movies or walk along the sets. The entry fee does not justify the tours offered.They need to modify their packages and shows."
249,Filmy junction,"In India, if you haven't been to ramoji, well, I would say you have missed one of the best. Impeccably maintained, you will hardly see a speck of dirt in the whole place (spread across acres) despite the footfall. The tours are very well organised, and the locations are mind-blowing. The day's action ends with the parade which in itself is quite nice. Must visit when you are in Hyderabad with kids...go for the premium tickets, and get some real premium treatment."
250,A delightful experience,"Good for a day outing for couples/families. However, not for the summer months; can get very hot in Hyderabad"
251,Full day fun,"I went to the studios in between a business trip.. Had no idea what to expect...I ended up being very impressed... Its a mix between Hollywood studios, botanical gardens and a surreal colorful nighttime show... I highly recommend the vip package as you will get quick entry and a tour guide that speaks English... In the nighttime the place transforms and is beautiful..Come with an open mind as this is not Disney or Hollywood studios but it's a very nice place anyways.. Was glad I came to visit..."
252,Ideal leisure park for families,"This is a worthwhile 1.5 hr roadtrip from the city Centre if you're 1. A big Bollywood fan or 2. You're a child.I am a Bollywood fan but not a fanatic, and found this tour to be worthwhile and quite a pleasant way to spend an afternoon in Hyderbadh.I enjoyed the fact that there is a lot more to do than merely tour a film studio.  Mr Ramoji Rao clearly is an entrepreneur who knows how to bring in the crowds, and this can be a most enjoyable trip for a family with young kids, with the very attractive amusement park, Eureka and Fundustan;  the Ramoji Movie Magic section with its Filmmaking experience, Eyelusion Gallery, Black Light show, Stunt show; as well as a bird park and butterfly garden, and a Japanese and bonsai garden, being just a few of the numerous immaculate gardens dotted around the grounds.We visited now during the last week of the ""Longest Winter Fest"", which ran from 13 Dec and which will end on 26 Jan;  hence the visiting crowds reasonably large, but clearly thinning out at this time, hence thankfully not having to queue for tickets.The bus tours offered between 10am - 5pm are very well organized, allowing one to cover the grounds of the entire film city in pretty much 4 - 5 hours. I thought this was more than enough time, but was rather disappointed that the tour guides only spoke in Hindi, and there was no attempt at all to accommodate us foreigners. Should you want to experience this park fully, one can book a night at one of Ramoji's hotels and then have more than enough time to experience the various carnival shows and dance performances which take place after the park has closed.No doubt, there is a lot to see, do and experience at Ramoji's Wonderland for anyone;  whether you're a Bollywood fan, a local tourist, a child, or merely just a foreigner wanting to see how Ramoji the Magician transformed 1666 Ha of land into the World's Largest Film City!"
253,Good place to visit with family,"Absolute Gem of a place. Massive area spread with mind boggling structures used for movie shooting. The cherry on the TOP are the bus guides. The way they do commentary is outstanding. Humorous,  comedy and gives all detailed info. Fantastic spots for taking pics. Shows are also great. Many restaurants to have good food. Many and many clean Washrooms at different spots,  which is very good. Many places to just sit and chill. Children love all the places. The gardens are very beautiful. A 100% MUST PLACE TO VISIT IN HYDERABAD."
254,Nice location for day out,"We were there last summe with an online booking. An all day visit was worth the effort even in summer. We got to see the Bahubali set. The dance show was amazing. So were the sporting events at the end. Great show overall, enjoyed every minute of it."
255,Beautiful,This Wonderla is a nice one to hangout with a familyn and children aswell.One the must see places in Hyderabad. It is the largest film city in India.
256,Good,All must see door opening so go before 9 am your money will be fully recovered by seeing door opening . Full day required enjoy it. Best place if Hyderabad. If you will not see it you missed Hyderabad beauty
257,Pride of Hyderabad,A fun place to visit. Pros: Lots of new things revealing the culture and film making process. Cons: Not a place to visit during summers as the sunshine is too much to bear.
258,Only for Bollywood Lovers,The way that was developed is fantastic I cant describe it in my words Probably the most important one to seeThis was a really tremendous one
259,Hyderabad Trip with friends,"Over all it is okay, but not really worth the hype. Though it attracts visitors from all over the country, ignoring local language is really worrying. Guides are using Hind and English only and not Telugu.Had dinner at Tara restaurant and not at all up to the standards of a 3 star hotel."
260,Awsome place,"We were a group of 9 ladies and opted for the VIP pass. Many of the ladies initially thought that it was no worth spending the whole day out there and said they would leave after lunch. But once there, everyone was having a good time and no one spoke of leaving early. Very clean and well maintained. Live shows were fantastic. Everything was up to the mark. Buffet lunch was awesome. Highly recommended"
261,Fabulous!!,We went in the month of December when there was a carnival going on....enjoyed the entire day. Good place for visit with kids and elders too as they have very good facility of transportation though a little walking too is needed. Evening looked much more beautiful with the different types of lights being put across the city....a must visit and must stay place in Hyderabad for sure.
262,Best Attraction In Hyderabad,Beautiful place with tons and tons of activites and places to see. Pre book your tickets online so that you dont waste time in the queue. Takes the entire day to cover everything. Definetly worth its HYPE !!!
263,Fun loving place with a lot to explore!!!,"Very cool place for a perfect Outing with family, bit expensive, as you have to pay every now and then. First Ticket at the Ticket Counter, then for food. One day not enough for complete visit."
264,Enchanting Place,"ramoji is like a dream. I had not experienced anything like this before in one go. As it is spread in a huge area you need to board a bus to reach the first point from where your MAGICAL JOURNEY BEGINS. From there it is that super  sweet red bus to take you along.It is so interesting and intriguing and beautiful that you dont want it to end. Honestly you cannot see all in a day. Though I visited this place 2 years ago I m still in love with it. When this covid menace is over I would certainly go there again to regenerate myrself.  Its just lovely. I can bet that like me you too will be amazed. Go and visit if you are in hyderabad.  If you don't see ramoji you will regret it for sure. But a little piece of caution. The story goes that it is haunted, which is still a mystery for me."
265,Fun day out,"Have been here twice before but this is the first time taking our daughter. She enjoyed a lot. I thought it will be the same as in Hyderabad city so didn't take my jacket with me but it was too cold there. So, if visiting in Dec/Jan remember to take a jacket.Everything was nicely maintained. We were lucky to visit the Bahubali sets before they remove it. It was a nice experience. Evening programs and dance show was nice with good food."
266,Weather decides your experience,Well plannedWell designedWell managedIts breathtaking beautifulWe took premium service for 2717 plus taxes and trust me it was worth it. Our guide ipshita kept us well informed.The live performances n shows were great experience. The evening lighting was just amazing. The winter carnival was mast
267,Nice place to stay,A day tour and outing to be enjoyed with family and even with friends. Specially for young ones - other than seneric beauty you need to get the knowledge of cinema making - the hard work of each and every technician and artists. Its a place must to visit for every tourist visiting Hyderabad.Its a pride of Hyderabad to have a flim city like this.
268,"Interesting visit, was able to see everything in half day.","Great place to see and tour. So many shows to see, rides and activities for kids. Butterfly garden and bird park are amazing"
269,One time must visit,"The Good :-1. Tickets are reasonably priced2.  Whole campus is squeaky clean and very well managed3. Shows are entertaining, bus rides are well managed and offered something different than usual entertainment parks4. We especially liked the bird park... Birds looked very well taken care off, their cages clean and they looked healthy. Varieties of birds ranged from all over the world. Very colorful affair. Souvenir shop offered really nice soft toys at reasonable price. 5. Small shows...even like a Dadajin show was creatively executed6. We didn't try the food but the snacks like veg puff etc was fresh. Prices were reasonable.7. Helpful staff. The bad :-1. Far from the city.. can be a slight issue if you don't have your own vehicle. 2. Main campus is far from the ticket counter so you are totally dependent on buses to go back3. Rides were not great... A bit on childish side The Ugly:-1. Transportation can be an issue while coming back. We went in the morning by Ola. It costed us roughly 1000 Rs from Banjara hills for one side drop...Which was fine. While coming back... We tried both ola and uber... Drivers first of all refused to go unless it's a cash ride.. Then they asked us how much fare is shown in the app... Then finally they asked us to cancel the booking and give them the cash directly... It happened to us with 4-5 drivers. Finally one guy relented and came. Ramoji guys should discuss this with uber and ola and create a pick up point like they have done at Hyderabad airport. That would be very useful for visitors. Barring the small driver issue at the end... It was a fun filled day and we enjoyed a lot. Kudos to the management for managing it well. It definitely deserves a day if you are in Hyderabad."
270,Can visit once,"A necessary Itinerary in your Trip.... Star Tickets takes you in AC buses... Normal Tickets take you in General Non AC buses.... As of Priority is not given to Festive Ticket Holder as describe in Tickets. But if not interested to travel in hot sun,  take AC buses under Star Tickets. NO MUCH Difference.. Only difference is AC BUS"
271,Memorable,"Positives-interesting for family outing-insights into film making-well organised trips-Excellent guides, good explanations-Lunch at Restaurants (group tour) are very goodNegatives-Would have been nicer to see some real film shooting-Overpriced"
272,A disappointment.,"If u have been to universal studio or disney world or anything in abroad, then its not for you. Else you will enjoy. Nice one day trip"
273,A unique experience to know everything about the cinema world,"Party of 4 adults visited for most of day.  Don’t bother arriving before noon as shows, rides and activities don’t really start until then.  Fun western show, the local folkloric show was outstanding.  Enjoyed visiting the sets for photos and the beautiful landscaping."
274,You may SKIP,"This is big disappointment. We expected too much but not up to expectations. The mahabhatrata settings, Bahubali settings are good"
275,waste of time for adults,"1. Travelled with family, including a 1yr old + pram. Weather was good given it was December. Took the basic 1350 day tour during Winter fest. Nowhere close  to Universal Studios, but good otherwise.2. Suggestion: If travelling from Hyd locally by car, on Google maps put Ramoji Ticket Counter instead of Ramoji Film City (RFC). We went to RFC first and I assumed the ticket counter will be right outside, but the ticket counter is actually 7kms away, where you can give the online ticket and get the actual one.3. Suggestion: Decide what you want to cover for sure, we finished off the Bahubali set first and then the studio red bus tour. Now once u start the red bus tour, while there are a number of times that you get down n take a new red bus, none of them go back to the starting point Eureka. This is sad actually, and you have to take long walks even if you dont want to visit an attraction.4. In the evening there was a special winter fest dance programme which was good with dances Bollywood and others across the  decades. Night view with lights is amazing. Towards the end there was a big rush for the bus back to the parking area.Overall a good experience. Two changes they should make: 1. Make rampways for prams/wheelchairs 2. Make provisions for Eureka drop at the 2-3 bus points during Studio Tour, dont force people to go through long parks, etc just to get to the  ext bus stop."
276,Fun ! ,"The challenge is that all shows are mediocre quality. The Aladdin in animations do not really look real by international standards today. So is the Wild West Stunt show. Needs a lot of work to capture imagination. Busses too are a problem, some are non branded as well and old. The whole idea is to sell food and merchandise rather than focus on making this a great imaginative content truely first class. Crowd management and orderly information is a challenge. Still the best way to enjoy this is to come in the afternoon when the most of the crowd had already tired. I wish they allow the ticket to be usable for two days so before I get tired, I exit and come back again the following day. With today's technology, it will not be a problem managing that noone sees the same show twice."
277,One day trip for fans of Bollywood,"Buy your entrance ticket rp1150 include shuttle bus 15min drive to site,  trolly bus within sites with comantator guide. Many attractions, birds buterfly, gardens etc its worth a day trip. Arrive 9.30am is good to have more time. Evening exit door gate just after the shuttle bus drop u, you can book a bus air con rp200/ per pax back to city."
278,Don't miss it,I would suggest everyone to stay away from this place as you will end up spending 50% of the time waiting in queue for different shows
279,"Don't bother, don't waste a day","Though we were deeply impressed with cleanliness, management of the place and services it offers, politeness of the staff, available support yet we were a bit disappointed by the quality of shows it offered.They were all very basic, made with old technology and had very old themes.Nonetheless we appreciate value for money it offers.The best part and no doubts the quality it offers was the Carnival with the starting stage show of dances. Both these items were full of fun, entertainment and professionalism."
280,Loads to improve,"English-only speakers will be disappointed. Even though tickets for both tours are expensive ($19 for basic tour and $36 for so-called luxury VIP tour), limited signage and poor organization means visitors can wander for a long time aimlessly. It’s unclear the company truly wants to show off the film sets and all there is to see. College student groups often get stuck at Fundustan, an amusement park for very little kids, wondering where to wait for a bus, if it’s the correct bus (rather than one exiting the park) and what more there is to see."
281,Mecca of Films,"I decided to pay the extra for the ""Star Experience"" package which was worth the additional cost. The package included some nice little extras (free chocolates, discounts for the souvenir shop, buffet lunch and a/c coach tour).  The coach tour was good for an overview but not suitable if you want to spend extended time at the various locations.  The buffet lunch was more than adequate and had a good selection of veg and non-veg options.The attraction itself has some good parts (Baahubali film set was my favourite and very impressive) and not so good parts (the London street looked nothing like anything in England!!). The live shows were on the whole impressive especially the ""Spirit of Ramoji"" show. If you're lucky you get to see some film work going on.Well worth the visit."
282,Best place in Hyderabad to spend a whole day,"We happened to go last week and had taken the holiday carnival day tour.There are additional live shows and parades from 5.30- 8 pm during the holiday carnival.live shows likes movie magic, wild west, etc are superb. Not to miss the Bird park and Butterfly park.Food and facilities are all reasonably priced.Its a must go place if you are visiting Hyderabad on a vacationAC buses are available for drop-off from Ramoji in the evening's. We had booked an Ola Rental car for 12 hrs."
283,best attraction in city,Though the entry fee is gradually increasing year on year its justifiable due to the kind of landscape maintained and the interesting concepts of film making requisites created..
284,Memorable visit,Very good place to visit.....value for money..... But entry fee is quite high.....also for kids. Everything inside area is chargable. Events r good. Overall must vidit place....
285,Save your money instead of going here,A completely average experience. Exorbitantly priced. not at all worth Rs 1300/-.no proper management to guide visitors. pathetic food options. you are forced to eat whatever 2-3 limited options they have. you get only chips and water and paper boat. no proper food options. too much hype which does not meet the expectations. we almost got caught in a stampede because everyone runs in the direction of the crowd since there is no proper crowd management.
286,One for families,"Much better than what we had seen in a similar theme park in Australia. Perhaps the Indianisation helps. It seemed that the target population was (also) people who could not go outside India and the objective was to offer them a well crafted and entertaining content at a reasonable price, without burning a hole in their pockets.  Of course it does have high end packages for those who require a vip service. So it is a buffet of different packages. We had decided to spend time till lunch and then return back to pavilion. But we spent the whole day leaving the place only at 6 o’clock in the evening. In fact it is a place fit for spending at least two days. There is a lot to see especially for kids and the younger lot. It is a theme park as well as a working film studio. We were told that it was spread over two thousand acres.Action Theater - by far the best piece of the entire place in my opinion. They have cleverly woven audience participation in the show. Volunteers were selected at random from the audience and were asked to ride stationary two-wheelers to enact a scene of robbers chasing on the road. Then they showed the ‘reel life’ transformation of that which really looked like a live chase on a road. They also demonstrated how sound is added to a movie with mundane equipment. Highly entertaining. And gave us terrific insights into movie making.Bird Park was another place that we loved. The park has one of the best collection of birds. The birds looked in really good shape - unlike the usual bored ones in a zoo. The Star Wars 4D experience was also thrilling albeit short. Other star attractions are movie sets of Bhagavatham and Bahubali. The place also boasts a nice bonsai garden. There are several other things which one can visit depending upon one’s liking, age group, and energy level. If you think you require a leisurely pace, better spread the experience over two days. There are free hop on hop off buses all around. But still it is a not a place for a quick visit of a few hours. Or one can pay higher and go for the guided tour of one (full) day."
287,Not worth the penny,A different world. What happens behind the roll camera and action gives u a rough idea. If you are looking to enjoy then keep your full day free as it is exciting and exhausting.!!
288,Going strong even today,Nice place to spend a full day. Lots of new attractions added recently. Good food options. Must see if you are visiting Hyderabad.
289,Fairy land of indian movies,One of the wonderful creation on earth. It's really feels that you are in anethore world. one of the best place i have ever visited till now.Highly recommend place to everyone.
290,Worth a visit if in Hyderabad,"It is very difficult to summarize the experience. You can spend an entire day here but still miss few attractions. It is located a bit far from the city but transport is available. After booking tickets, buses are easily available to take you to various attractions. Best part was the different shooting locations and Bahubali set."
291,Awesome Experience,A very well laid out and organised tour. Gives an interesting glimpse into the backstage  of the tinsel world. The entertainment shows are wonderful and a pleasant change from the TV serials at home. A must visit not only for children but for adults as well. Will easily take up one entire day. Reach early to enjoy the entire set up
292,Be prepared to walk a lot!,"Your visit to Hyderabad is incomplete if you do not visit RFC. If it suits your itinerary and if you are a movie buff, plan to stay there. If you are just going for a day and want to cover most of it without being too tired, go for the star experience. It includes a buffet lunch, souvenir chocolate box, a voucher, etc. which is quite good."
293,Nice place for one day Tour,"You can get on and off the tour buses at your own pace so you can decide how long to spend in each location. Many things were closed when I was there, did not stay for the evening show."
294,Family visit,It's best to reach here in the morning around 9. The day seems to be short to cover the entire film city. The experience is rich. Must watch being the sound and light show. Ample amount of food joints are available. A day well spent and with rich learning experience.
295,Excellent,As you must have understood by the title of this review how big a disaster this place is. Only one advice I have STAY AWAY. They charge minimum 1360/person. Add 2000 for a two way cab. Entire money is wasted. Such hopeless place it is.
296,Mesmerizing visit,"If possible one should spend at least 7-8 hours over here, although it may be difficult on a hot sunny day. There are lots of hop-on hop-off buses so one would not need to walk much."
297,Cycle Ride ,"i went on 30th december , the day before new years eve. so it was busy even though it was monday. we were a group of 8 - 4 adults, 2 kids and 2 senior citizens who are limited in walking. we reached there by 9.15 , premium tickets get premium lounge , where you get the water bottles, cookies etc , you get a/c bus for premium which will take you to the entrance cermony at around 945. the thing with premium tickets is you have a guide who will assist you through out the day , rushing you to events one after the day with minimal waiting. the general tickets also had a tour guide but longer queues. the place is so big that even after rushing one after the other , i feel i haven't seen much. so i think best way to enjoy the place is stay overnight and visit for 2 days. after the opening cermony, we had been to a show think its called spirit of ramoji. basically a dance show for about 30 mins. then we went to bahubali set . then we drove around the film city in the bus where we saw all the sets from the bus - railway station, airport , various building - old and modern etc.  then we went for lunch at sitara hotel which was included in the ticket. the lunch is good/healthy- lot of choice for vegetarian , only 2 dishes non- veg. no hyderabadi chicken biryani , only veg biryani. probably if there is , it will be the only dish all non-vegetarians will eat :-) there is even a jain food counter. after lunch we went to movie magic , eco zone ( butterfly & bird garden) , space yantra , action theater , and the last show is wild west show . by then it was 5 , the tour guide has left us and said we can see whatever we want until 730. there was a parade at 6 and some stage shows going on as well in the evening. we went to kids area after 5 pm, its huge and has various play areas and activities for kids. what i like :with out the premium tickets, it would not have been possible for me to have a good visit. the general ticket had long queues everywhere and with premium tickets, the only delay was us walking slowly. there is a lot of variety of things for different types of people - youngsters, kids & families. what i don't like :most of the tour guides or the commentary of the shows are in english or hindi only but not in telugu. the guide i had didnt even know telugu. i dont know why they decided that but i can see many visitors are from up north so that could be the reason but i feel the guides/show commentators should speak telugu too after all the place is in telangana.i think RFC should employ more people to force people follow the rules, spread the queues evenly and let the people enjoy the visit with out the pushing and pulling. Just implement first come first serve basis strictly. i have 2 kids ( under 5)  , 2 senior citizens in my visit  and i had to literally apply force to stop people jumping queues in boarding/alighting the bus every time, taking seats in the shows or even buy something from a food counter. with that many people everywhere , it is very hard to stop people jumping queue if the staff isn't practising the FCFS ( first come first serve) or simply queues."
298,Visit to Ramoji,"Before you even enter you are made to store your slr camera at the cloakroom at the parks entrance.    You then have to endure a bus ride for a couple of kilometers to the park itself in a bus that should have been pensioned off in the 1960's.   Unclean, hard bench seats, uncomfortable with no air cond., leaking exhaust and screaming brake pads.   The ""classic buses"" that actually take you on the tour are not much better.    The Film City itself is quite a disappointment.   The movie sets, displays and ""studios"" that are supposed to be the main attraction are so amateurish and dated they are an embarrassment.  Many of the displays such as cars and statues etc are damaged or worn out, and the rides that were there are aimed at young children but were not operating when we visited.  The only redeeming features of Film City are the gardens which are well kept, even though most of the fountains were not working, and Superstars cafe where the food was great and the service was fantastic.   Unfortunately these do not make up for the rest of the place.   The owners need to visit a real theme park to see how it is done.   Overall, don't waste your time or money visiting Ramoji Film City."
