0,Cuyabeno national park,"I booked the 4 day dshungel Tour and had a few absolut amazing days. The guide, Fabian, was very good informed about all the flora and fauna in the dshungle and showed and explained so much. Also he had a very sympathetic way to lead the group to understand more of the nature. I stayed in the dolphin lodge which was very clean and save. Under consideration that it is located in the middle of the dschungel it was a luxury stay, with two hot meals a day. Always whith fresh vegetables or fruits. Our driver from the lodge was also very good. He spotted a lot of animals which I would never have seen. So we saw a lot of apes, caimans, dolphins, spiders and snakes just to mention a few.  Only thing you have to know is that you are travelling in a group up to 12 people. So how good your stay is, may vary from group to group. Also the first and the last day are pretty much travel days. So I would recommend 4 days as minimum stay, because you only have two full days in the dshungle. If you want to stay longer it may be a possibility to move on to a second lodge more down the river.  If you want to have the nature all for your own, you may wanna go with a smaller group and paddle on your own down the river. Of course more expensive but its also offered by Fabian and you get for sure more in touch with nature.  I can absolut recommend the tour for exploring a part of the Ecuadorian natural diversity. Definitely even more recommendable for ""jungle beginners"" but also more experienced travellers should have their fun in this relaxing jungle adventure.…"

240,Review of Amazon Jungle Tour - 3 nights/4 days at Pink Dolphin Lodge,Hiking to the glacier (15 minutes from the refugio or basecamp) was spectacular! We lucked out and saw the clouds part when we reached the glacier. Make sure to drink lots of water on the bus ride to avoid getting altitude sick!
241,Cuyabeno Jungle tours,We paid $20 through the hostel to do this tour. We were picked up at 2:30 (which meant we could do the walking tour as well in the morning). A large vehicle like taxi took a group of us to the middle of the word. It is a tourist site where you receive a short tour to explain the…
242,Amazon Tour,"We booked the tour because we wanted to go to Mitad del Mundo.  We spent so long at the first stop that we only got 28 minutes at the Mitad del Mundo.  When I booked, I was told we would have 2 hours."

252,Great day trips,"I really enjoyed the free walking tour with our guide Naty.

253,Great booking experience,"I did nearly all available tours with Community Adventures: Amazonas, Otavalo, Mindo and Quilotoa.

266,Perfect ,"This package was a pack of lies. I was told $93 per person for a two hour drive up into cloud forest. Instead we got a bill for $100 each, without explanation, plus each activity had additional costs, and it was an awful day. It took us 4 hours to get there and 3 hours to get…"
267,Helpful chicas,Best deal on this event....the ride to the middle of the earth with great host and new friends. This group is very welcoming and cater to those of us who want to see things and share with others.  Go with these people as they take you to the “real” middle!

271,Very helpful staff and cool tours offered,"Ok, if you were like us, you are having to stop in Quito en route to other places.  Some people will like it but it is big, chaotic and a traffic nightmare.  Several million live there and most of them seem to own cars.  No doubt the horn is the first thing to go on most of the…"
272,Walking tour and Quilotoa,Everyone needs to visit the middle of the world when going to Quito.  Community Adventures has different tour packages at a reasonable price and they make it so easy to book with them.  I will use them again.

274,Jungle tour,"We did the afternoon trip to Mitad del Mundo, because we thought going there by public bus is time intensive and does not allow for a lot of time at Mitad del Mundo. Sadly the same was true for the tour. Once we arrived at the inti nan museum our bus driver rushed us to the…"

289,Great travelling agency!,"The tour route itself was great, but what made the tour experience special was Sole.

294,Galapagos and Quito tours,"Had a great time, we had many stops on the way so that it didn't feel like we were in the car the entire time- tip: pack a breakfast! there is not much to eat at the indigenous market which is supposed to be a breakfast stop!"
295,Quilotoa Day Trip,"I enjoyed my days in the Amazon a lot. The food was excellent, the habitation offered everything one needs and the daily program gives the best insight in the jungle life. I’d only wish that the trip would be more sustainable, as there’s a lot of fuel going into the water due to…"
296,Great staff and environment,"Went on a 4D/3N jungle trip to Cuyabeno. You have to go to Lago Agrio yourself (they offer private transportation for $20 more), and you will be picked up from Lago Agrio. From there it is a 3 hour busride and thats where the adventure begins! They take you around the area in a…"
297,Great Agency troughout,Review was very informative. Community hostel is the BEST!!! Their name is aptly chosen; they are community and treat all like family; even those not staying at the hostel.
298,Decent free walking tour,This tour is not really worth the money as they don't pay for any entrance tickets and they don't pick you up at the bottom of the cable car.  Basically you can do this trip yourself with a public bus or an Uber for half the price.  
299,Highlight of my stay in Ecuador,"We saw some cool animals, visited a local tribe and learned about the food culture there, our guide was knowledgeable about the wild and plantlife in the area, and the staff was attentive at the hostel, but there wasn't anyone who greeted us to tell us all of the details.  The…"

305,Day trip to Otavalo ,Quilotoa is a great - MUST SEE - attraction in the area around Quito! I would highly recommend anyone coming to Ecuador and Quito to go.

She took us around the major attractions in the historical center, gave us a lot of cultural and historical information in addition to answering all of our questions.    This is a good tour, I recommended it."
314,Certainly worth it!,"Straight forward fair pricing and a private transport option made booking with this agency a no brainer.

322,The best Tours ever!!!,How can you not love a trip to the equator?  We heard this may not be precisely 0-00 but it was close enough for us.

323,Quilotoa,"We lucked out with the weather.  Predicted rain didn't start until we sat down for a great lunch at a local restaurant, followed by an informative and tasty tour at an artisanal chocolate factory, Yumbo.  We hiked to a waterfall, where younger members of the group leaped off a…"

334,Quilotoa will steal your heart!  MUST SEE.,Good fun filled day. It's a long drive from Quito but that's offset by other cool stops along the way. An indigenous market and a visit to an indigenous family home. Quilotoa is beautiful and very wet. Gabriel the guide was excellent.
335,"Fantastic Amazon trip, free walking tour of Quito, and tours of the surrounding area.",It’s the easiest way to go into the Amazonas from Quito. You will see a lot of different types of animals.

337,Brilliant Day Trip To Alausi and Lagunas de Ozogoche,"I was lucky enough to be in Quito on a handful of weekends and every time I was, I went on the Community food tour!

The Community Hostel travel agency planned our four day trip in the Cuyabeno Amazon Reserve and provided transportation to Lago Agrio. The staff were very helpful and…"
