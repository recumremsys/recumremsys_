0,Interesting and nice views ,"We enjoyed our visit to the castle, interesting artefacts and information.Lovely views and well kept.My son particularly liked the peacocks and the cats wondering the grounds.We had a nice morning walking around."
1,Excellent,"We loved this place. Great views and a couple of open rooms of the underwater archeological finds. We‚Äôll definitely come back again in another year or so since this is a ‚Äòwork in progress‚Äô so more of the finds will be displayed, but for now, it‚Äôs a beautiful place to wander around and take in the breathtaking views of Bodrum and surroundings."
2,Castle of St Peter afternoon trip,"Lovely couple of hours spent wandering around the castle, very well kept, good informative museum, amazing views, has a cafe, clean toilets, we all enjoyed our visit here.  Shame the prison side was closed, so will just have to go back and revisit"
3,Main attraction of Bodrum,Excellent castle and museum with fantastic exhibitions. We spent nearly 3 hours with the kids. Unfortunately the ancient medical centre exhibition was closed. Some of the steps are very high; may not be suitable for very young children. We loved the English tower!
4,Best good castle üè∞,"Superb castle with great variety of things to see. My 14yr and 12yr old sons were a little skeptical at first, but became pretty impressed!Very good historical journey broken down into easy to assimilate, bit-size chunks via the various towers, different galleries and levels within the castle. Vast array of artefacts from old underwater civilizations and wrecks covering an excellent array of amphorae (covering numerous different civilizations and spanning many centuries), an impressive ancient glassware collection (one of the finest in the world), various coins, jewellery and gold. Superb views of Bodrum, sea, harbour and hills from the ramparts on almost all sides (I recall 3 but maybe the 4th as well).Lost of ups and downs, climbing and so forth, so not for elderly and less mobile.Allow minimum 90mins (otherwise you'll skim too much).Well worth a visit."
5,"Beautiful building, able to social distance easily. Don't believe it was worth the money to enter? ",A brilliant visit to the Castle at Bodrum. Some interesting artefacts and art exhibition. Really worth a visit.
6,"Great views and history, a must!",The castle is beautiful and very well kept!We're glad we visited whilst we were staying in gumbet.However! We do not believe it was worth the ¬£38 we paid for 4 adults and 2 children.The toilet facilities were also not cleaned and looked like they hadn't been cleaned for some time.A few very suspicious looking marks wiped across the back of the toilet door and stains all over the walls that looked like they had not been cleaned for quite some time!Can they really warrant asking people to comply with covid guidelines or even charge the amount they are charging when they clearly have not deep cleaned the facilites since the pandemic?!
7,A favourite spot,"The castle itself was interesting to check out, well preserved and had a nice view. However, half of it is closed currently for renovation so not a ton to see"
8,Great cultural visit,"Great views and history, a must! Spend a few hours going around this magnificent castle, learning about Turkish history, overlooking the Bodrum marina. Very close to the city center."
9,"Hot, damn hot, but a great experience ","Beautiful , well looked after castle with the most amazing views. We had a very helpful tour guide who knew everything, so friendly and informative. Would definitely return."
10,Amazing ,Ok the titles a bit dramatic but I found the boat artefacts exhibit with the castle so interesting. Originally built by the crusaders it's an imposing sight from the Kos ferry and when you're within it's walls. There was an art exhibition when we visited but I have to say it didn't look that erm ...  competent
11,nice castle with a sea great view,The castle with its garden and ancient ruins has a very special atmosphere and energy. I really loved the variety of plants surrounding the ancient ruins.
12,Castle or museum?,An absolute glorious experience allowed to explore. Lots to see and the views are incredible. Thoroughly enjoyed visiting the historical sites of Bodrum.
13,A nice place to admire the view,"My husband and I visited the castle as part of a cruise excursion. It offers beautiful views of Bodrum and some interesting history. Give yourself between 1 to 2 hours to tour the castle. The many rooms displaying artifacts are quite small and get crowded with large cruise groups. The grounds are well-maintained with beautiful flowers. You may see a few peacocks roaming around as well. There are a significant number of steps and inclines to traverse, so wear good walking shoes. Some of the highlights include the ancient coins, jewelry, and glass gallery. Unlike others, we were underwhelmed by the reconstruction of a ship's hull. Overall, it was not an amazing excursion, but it gave us something to do in Bodrum.Tip: If you are cruising and arrive to the castle by boat, we recommend not taking the boat back.  My husband and I were able to take a leisurely walk back to the cruise ship port. The walk took us through the popular shopping area, where we were able to eat, buy souvenirs, and have afternoon tea."
14,A most interesting but somewhat largely unvisited building,I visited the castle and the museum 3 years ago and it was great. Unfortunately extensive refurbishment works are in progress now and could last till the end of next year 2019. No doubts it will be worth the visit.
15,One of Bodrum's Star Attractions,Stunning castle. Grounds where beautiful and the views were out of this world. Evan got to see some peacocks walking around
16,Worth while visit,We visited with our six year old. We spent hours exploring everything on offer plus spectacular views across Bodrum. We hired the $15 TL audio headset though there was a few information panels throughout. Highly recommend.
17,Not Like European Castles,Extremely beautiful! History to be seen! Very well maintained museum piece. Lovely garden. Beautiful view. Very good audio guides. Missing Bulgarian language.
18,Extensive restorations ongoing,"Easy to find on the front next to the harbour. Lots of interesting things to see and we liked that story boards erected throughout tell you all you need to know about the history of the castle and its contents. Plenty of battlements to climb which afford spectacular views across the bay and out to sea or inland !!Was also good how rooms had been converted to include the boats dredged from the sea or to show off the amazing glassware and artefacts. We spent a good few hours here and it really is worth a visit. Gorgeous peacocks within the grounds but we were a little disappointed you don't get a guide booklet included in the price but then again this is Turkey!Also one word of caution, we looked on the Bodrum museums website under fees and opening hours before we travelled.  We were informed the entrance fee was 20 TL to enter however it was actually 30 TL when we got there however the differential is minimal and didn‚Äôt affect our enjoyment of the day.Takes a few hours to walk round to to try and ensure you have seen everything possibleWell worth a visit.Tues 26th Sept 2017 as a couple"
19,Great castle,"We went on a windy day but still enjoyed it, amazing harbour views from the top! Museum was also good, loved it and we had some lovely pics from the trip!"
20,"Mostly closed, but full price ticket",A nice place to walk around. Informative walk in to find out what happened long before us. Wonderful views. Clean. Very nice place with historical atmosphere.
21,Great Attraction in the harbour area of Bodrum,"I visited Castle of St. Peter not expecting to see much but I was pleasantly surprised by how much history there was. The building itself was beautiful and amazing, gorgeous gardens and the view you can get from up top was spectacular. There are some amazing sculptures and archeological finds which I didn't expect at all. It's definitely worth seeing, lots of information offered in English too."
22,Very interesting and worth a visit,Well worth a visit .the views from around the castle are great and the inside history is really great . There's a cafe and shop inside the walls. Takes a while to walk around and can get warm as there is on bits of shade.but this said I would really recommend a visit .there are English voiceover handheld tourist dictafones available and the information boards are also. In English.
23,catel with a wiew,Really great value we found it very interesting and great value .If you go to the back of the castle and look out towards the marina you see three very large pirate ships which I believe we're in pirates of the Caribbean.
24,Getting there??,"This castle is huge with so much to see. Lots of historical information and artefacts all over with little exhibitions in some of the rooms.  Absolutely stunning views over bodrum cation the top of the castle.Great value for money, so make sure you give yourself plenty of time to explore! The only down side is the hundreds of deep steps that have to be navigated to get around the castle but that's to be expected and gave the thighs a good work out!"
25,Most of it's still shut,I visited the castle with my husband and son.  The ticket now includes all the attractions within the grounds rather than just the castle then charging separately for the other two areas.  It was a very hot day and walking around was difficult but you could get some break from the sun in some of the building which had a bit of air conditioning.  There was plenty to see and you can get a very nice view over Bodrum from the castle walls.  It was a nice day out.
26,Dissatisfied for poor exhibitions ,Interesting displays of ancient artifacts found in shipwrecks.  Awesome views of the harbor and the fleet of wooden yachts.
27,Quite a lot shut,"Beautiful harbour with very impressive old boats. Very popular with tourists with plenty of restaurants and shops. The Castle is amazing, looks even better when illuminated at night."
28,Second time around,We took a tour of the castle and it was interesting.  You also get to see some ship wreck artifacts.  The Tower of London was the nicest room to visit with artifacts from the 15th century.  The views of the city from the castle are amazing.
29,Interesting but under renovation ,"Suat Akay was our fabulous tour guide from""Viator"".  He was fun, informative, interesting and made us feel so relaxed as we followed him through the castle, the waterfront, a small remote village and a mosque.  He arranged a traditional Turkish lunch for us in a small village entertaining us with stories of his country and it's traditions.  The food was delicious and fresh out of the garden, which was just off the patio where we enjoyed our lunch sitting on the Turkish rug-covered floor. It was delightful.  Turkey is a beautiful country and one of our favorite on our 42 day trip."
30,Seaside Castle in Bodrum,It's a must to visit for history and value pieces of under the water founded from the Roman EraAlso very excellent view to Bodrum and the sea with islands Don't miss itTicket is 30TLYou need at least 1 hour in hurry and may be 3 hours if you want to be relaxed
31,Must visit if in Bodrum. Castle by the ferry port.,This is worth the time to see. Excellent photo opportunities and a great walk through history. It has a great audio tour that explains everything you're looking at.
32,Castle of St. Peter,"Interesting castle and artifacts displays. 50% of the castle was unacceble due to repairs. We were made aware of this before paying to enter, so that's fair enough.  It's still worth a visit though. There is a little cafe and toilet facilities  which were all clean and tidy. Oddly,  there was very little written info about the castle history. No guide book available. We googled the history about king John and the knights, changes of monarchy and the fact the a great deal of the castle was built from stone's taken from the Mausolium  in Bodrum."
33,Splendid castle,You would enjoy visiting this castle not only for the monuments inside but also for the numerous nice and enjoyable views you would have over the whole city. Make sure to have your cameras fully charged when visiting this place. :)
34,Great view,A brilliant place to spend a few hours soaking up the history of this wonderful building. Many great artefacts to view & plenty of beautiful sights from the turrets.
35,What bodrum stands for,"Good views of the harbour area. Well laid out with various artifacts found in the bays around Bodrum and further afield. Some steps are a little precarious.As the castle is undergoing restoration, it is only about 50% accessable.toilets and cafe available inside."
36,Excellent castle well worth a visit,"I liked exploring and learning more of this castle but unfortunately, the castle was under renovations and can only explore a few open areas. Before buying your ticket or hiring a guide (highly recommended), make sure to ask if they are still renovating."
37,Enjoyed this Meaningful Historical Place,"Worth a visit with lovely views over the harbour, good spot to take nice photos, prepare to take loads of steps"
38,Nearly finished,Important historical place. Worth visiting only with guide/audio. The marina close by is quite nice too.
39,Average ,"Very atmospheric and impressive. Fascinating exhibits. Shady places to rest awhile but the walk up not too taxing. History really comes alive and the entrance fee if 30 lira is very reasonable for what you see. Allow ,2.5 hours."
40,Beautifully restored,Was looking forward to visit the castel and its museum ' but at the time of our stay it was under renovation work and was closed  ( end of April /2019 ) .
41,Go visit and step back in time,Nice place to visit and take awesome photos. Entrance fee is quite cheap and service personnel are very friendly.
42,Pretty Cool,"Very nice castle, to visit, the entrance is in the harbour of Bodrum, the view is fantastic over Bodrum, Castle of St. Peter is a must for a visit; there is also a museum with old Amphores, there is a little snack restaurant inside; visit for 1-2 hours."
43,A beautiful old castle ,"This was a stop with celebrity cruise lines. Visiting this old Castle and picturing living during the times, provided me with a wonderful afternoon of speculating life in ancient Turkey. Once you‚Äôre done, don‚Äôt forget to take a walk through the marketplace."
44,Castle Under Renovation,"A museum in an old castle on the waterfront.  Nice view of the bay.  A few exhibits, but worth the price of admission."
45,Renovation only 50% open for public,"Very interesting worth a visit , scenery was fantastic looking out over the harbour and out to sea. The underwater ship wreck is worth looking at and the history of the castle is very interesting."
46,Bodrum Castle no information,30TL per adult to visit this huge castle with its archeological exhibits such as the salvaged cargo from a ship sunk centuries ago.
47,a must see,"great sea view from the castle towers, beautiful gardens, interesting history. It will take around 2 to 3  hours to visit all the castle"
48,Waist of time,"Nice place to visit with amazing views. I would suggest to visit the place in warm, but not very hot weather."
49,Half open yet full price,"We visited the Castle after seeing the Mausoleum of Halicarnasis. Spent quite a few hours walking around the towers and galleries. Signs and artefact descriptions in Turkish and English. We took one of the digital guides - good value and gave great additional information. Galleries have air con. so good to get out of hot sun for some cool air.Lots of artefacts including brilliant glass exhibition, amphora, Byzantine  merchant ship, coins and some jewellery, statues and remains of the 'Princess of Caria'.  Note: if you go to the Dungeon you must come back up the same stairs as you go down.The castle is not suitable for anyone with limited mobility. Gift shop is small but has a number of good books on the history of the castle and the Mausoleum in various languages."
50,A good way to spend a few hours....,Visited on a day trip to Bodrum from Kos and were pleasantly surprised how well preserved the castle is. Entrance to the castle was very reasonable and the explanations of the various areas of the castle were in Turkish and English increasing the experience. There are several rooms that have presentations and some thankfully with air conditioning which give relief after walking up several steps to reach the various levels. The views of Bodrum from the top of the castle are sensational.
51,Must see,Unfortunately the castle is closed until 2019 but it looks very impressive and the marina and beach cafes around it are really lively and fun. Hope next time I go it will be restored and open.
52,Castle,"This place was amazing and I loved every minute. The information provided was very interesting and the small chapel inside was beautiful. There are amazing peacocks and small birds roaming around the grounds and the views are incredibleI would advise to wear comfortable, flat, closed toe shoes. No flip flops as some of the steps are of course old and steep and I did nearly fall a few times in my sandals. I would not recommend buggy/wheel chair users but it is a must see!"
53,Worthwhile visiting but needs more information,We paid 30TL each for entrance into the castle and the museum and it was well it. It is a really nice day as you can spend as long as you want in there. I think I was there for around 3 hours. The views are amazing and you can get some great photos. Defo worth a visit if you have not been before. Enjoy x
54,Amazing,A great half a day strolling around a real castle with interesting history and beautiful views to offer.
55,Bodrum Castle (Castle of St Peters),"We had a guided tour, although I saw many visitors with audio handsets. The guide was knowledgeable and engaging. The castle itself was very interesting with a variety of additional displays eg artefacts from shipwrecks. There was a lot of walking but everything was accessible. It was worth the day trip from kos."
56,a well preserved castle with a lot to look at,"Absolutely beautiful and so well preserved. The throne room is very colorful. The courtyard is beautifully filled with trees, benches, wells and peacocks! The dungeons give you the creeps.The view from the higher parts is the best in Bodrum. Excellent for taking pictures during the day.There are explanatory signs around most parts so you can understand the background story.The museum wasn't of much interest to us in particular since we have seen most of the exhibited items in Lebanon.Make sure you have a couple of hours to spare so as not to rush the experience, and wear comfortable shoes! There are a lot of stairs, and the floor is a bit slippery at times.Entrance was 30 TL for both the castle and museum."
57,Worth a visit,Simply awesome must visit attraction in Bodrum. Maritime history museum included. Memorable experience with scenic vistas of Bodrum bay  and town + marina 10/10
58,Partially open attraction,"The castle which is of historic importance especially of local and international ancient heritage, is worth visiting. But don‚Äôt make a special trip to Bodrum just to see it until the renovations have finished. My wife and I were staying in Bodrum for two nights during a longer stay in the Turkish Aegean. The Lonely Planet guide book raised my expectations of what we‚Äôd see. It was somewhat disappointing not to be able to see everything that is normally open to the public. So keep an eye on the internet and go when the castle renovation is complete."
59,"Gorgeous Castle, Stunning Views, Well worth a visit","Nicely maintained and organized, this castle is a rare view into ancient history. Clearly one of the must see's in Bodrum. The room of the old chapel has a rare glass goblet and the amphora are stunning. The reconstruction of the ancient shipwreck is worth the trip."
60,Grand castle but under renovation,A must do in Bodrum.Fantasticbit ofMedieval architecture built by the Hospitallers.Great artefacts and underwater archeological gems.Beautiful walkways and gardens.
61,perfect ancient castle by the seaside,It was amazing trip to the castle and we see a lot of amazing things gust we didn't find inside any place to buy water
62,Thought there would be more to see,"The site joins history, science and views. History of the castle and the trade over Aegean sea! Science with underwater archeology museum and the views from top are excellent (see my pics) over bodrum bay and marina! All this only for 30 TL or 10 euros ! Loved it!"
63,Great to wander around,"Great building and the view from the this castle is magnificent. I love this city, the colors of this city, begonias."
64,Half open ,The castle gives you a nice overview of an interesting era in history. Combining the castle with the underwater archeology museum makes it an exciting place worth visiting
65,Must See but Still Closed,A must visit for all who visit Bodrum grounds are vast and views from the top amazing! Well worth the visit steeped in history loved it!
66,Unfortunatly at time of our stay was closed for renovation,Absolutely beautiful place to visit. Whole day siteseeing at Bodrum. :) brilliant tour guide too Suzanne you‚Äôre number 1
67,Summer Visit,"Only 30TL each entrance which includes all the cool underwater archaeological exhibits as well as the whole castle. Beautiful glassware from BC, with plenty of information. The entrance is 50 m past where all the ferry boats drop off. Definitely worth a visit."
68,Must be,"It was more than 3 hours I have spend in visiting this historic castel, there were many places showing the Romanian & Ottoman heritage, also I intersted with the beautiful sea & port views for the Bodrum city."
69,will be nice,"I really enjoyed walking around this very important and meaningful historical castle, though as others say, about 50% of it is closed off due to restorations. There are a couple of areas with indoor historical exhibits and quite a number of outdoor sculptures too. If you are in the area, I would recommend it. A short 15 minute or so walk away is the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World and though only in ruins, worth a visit for the historical value."
70,closed,"My fiancee and I visited the castle after a recommendation by the rep. The entrance fee is 30tl each which is reasonable against atractions in the UK. The castle is beautiful and very well preserved. The views are stunning from the tops of the castle walls. The entrance side looks out over the marina and into the hills. The next side looks out toward the sea and the last 2 sides over look Bodrum itself. Plenty of photo opportunities. The site is set up between 4 corners. The Italian, the German, the French and the English. The English being the biggest and the one that you can go inside. The visit took us 1hr 15 to get around with plenty of time to read and look through the archaeological finds. There is also an option of paying an extra 15tl for a headset guide in different languages to enhance the experience."
71,Museum,Not the biggest or best I've ever visited but does have a collection of ancient artefacts. Good views from the walls. Has a reconstruction of a sunken ship and some of the things recovered from it. A reasonable distraction for a couple of hours with a 7 euro entry fee in 2017.
72,Deficient information,"This castle shows the ancient life and life of Medieval times...Clean, nice, exotic, similar to greek forts cause so near to Greece. There are also lots of things to do outside of the Castle. DOn't forget to visit museum. Castle has lots of sections with dummie pirates and amphores."
73,Bodrum Castle,"Was great experience ! Absolutly go there ! Views are beautiful, we got our best photos from there !"
74,Day out in the rain,The castle is open but one can only visit partly and just two rooms. The tickets are full price what is strange because you can‚Äôt see everything. Take water with you restaurants were not open when we visited end of May. Am sure that when it is finished it will be an excellent place to visit for a view hours
75,VERY GOOD TO LOOK AT,"It is a very impressive Castle to visit. One of the great things about the Castle is the impressive views of Bodum. Another notable feature of the Castle was it contained many mini-museums, including a glass hall and an exhibit about a Roman ship that used to sail to these shores in the 7th Century."
76,Amazing,"Even on multiple Vists to Bodrum the castle is always worth a visit ,the site is immaculate and well supplied with genuine craft shops , not cheap but you get what you pay for here .The one problem is the stairs the crusaders must have had long legs ! It is well worth the climb even to all the towersGThere is a very good coffee shop come cafe and cheap ."
77,Closed for Long Term Renovation,"The castle is a lovely place to visit in Bodrum and gives a taste of the traditional side of the town.  There are lovely views from all the different levels which gives the opportunity for some great photos.  Unfortunately this is not a suitable place for any one with walking difficulties as some of the steps are very steep.  I have a walking stick and a dodgy knee and found it very difficult to get round, but it was well worth the effort.  The underwater museum pieces in the various towers are very interesting.  The buildings are well cared for and there are a couple of kiosks around to get a drink but unfortunately they were closed when we visited so it is advisable to take a bottle of water in with you.  There are toilets inside and a few seating areas for a rest from climbing around.  Small children should be supervised carefully as there are a few areas where accidents are waiting to happen.  Would recommend a visit to get a bit of tradition and culture away from the holiday resort vibe which has now overtaken Bodrum."
78,Not open ,You must visit Bodrum castle! There are stunning views and so much to see. It's not for the faint hearted you need to be fit to be able to explore everything the castle has to offer. I have actually visited 3 times in total... everytime i visit it just becomes more and more beautiful. I haven't had a guided tour but I hear they are good.
79,Castle Reconstruction,Wow ! The views from the top took my breath away. Worth every penny. Beautiful grounds and lots of interesting history.  Make sure you take water with you as you will get hot. It's like a trecking a desert in there.
80,Nice city and beautiful view,"Went to Bodrum on a cruise stop and the Castle is one of the major sights that you could see there.  It is beautiful and full of history.   I went on a guided tour provided by the cruise, but really its not needed.  It would have been much easier to just go around ourselves.  The Castle is quiet large and is filled with artifacts found from shipwrecks (Underwater Archaeology Museum), which were very interesting.  If you are in Bodrum for the day, I would check this place out!"
81,A must if your visiting Bodrum,"Also called Bodrum Castle, must visit place with rich history. The view is incredible,you can enjoy the wind on the sea side which is really relaxing.I visited Bodrum during the off season and when I visited there was nobody else in the castle, I really enjoyed my time with my family. We were able to take great photos for the sea view.If you are visiting during the low season, some sections will be closed and opening hours will be different."
82,Great view,"The castle is absolutely the place to visit. Steeped  in Egyptian, Roman, Ottoman and Crusade history. Our guide, Sami was a real treat, so knowledgable and made the tour. The trip from Kos to Bodrum does involve two passport controls, so be prepared for a wait. Not too nice in 40 degree heat. People Lovely in Bodrum, got a great vibe to the town, there's more money in play here than Kos Town"
83,Super,"It's a piece of history worth a visit,about 20TL entrance and like most castles there's lots to see if you go and find it,don't expect it to come to you, look round and you may be very surprised at what you see.There's plenty of good views of the harbour,of Gumbet ,the windmills and plenty more besides."
84,"Beautiful view , historical place",Nice place to visit. Great view of the city worth while the walk. Take comfortable shoes and a sun hat
85,Closed,"I‚Äôm sure the castle is a great visit if it was open. Having read other reviews on here, I was expecting the closure. It‚Äôs a pretty place to visit & take a few photos. The walk there through the main shopping street isn‚Äôt particularly nice.The shop owners (mostly selling the same fake designer clothes/bags etc) hassle you no end. They are very insistent/forceful you go in their shop, I have heard of people being forced to buy things once in there but I don‚Äôt know for sure. I did see a few people get drawn into conversation with the shop keepers usually with ‚Äòlet me show you something in here‚Äô & led in by the arm.Our cabin steward from our cruise ship also told us some shops don‚Äôt like you browsing & insist you leave unless your going to buy.If you keep walking & avoid eye contact we found we were okay on the walk back."
86,üëç,I was disappointed with my visit and felt that the castle was over-rated. The fortification itself was impressive and stands between two lovely bays with a commanding view of the harbour. Views from the castle were excellent but the interior had little of interest. The underwater museum contained many amphorae - all similar- and one old boat. Much hype about very little ! The castle walls were built with huge blocks of stone taken from the ruins of the mausoleum. The restaurant served good coffee . Save yourself the entry fee and admire from the outside.
87,Closed work in progress ,The picturesque castle hosts also a museum. It offers nice views over the city and the marina. Select a day when the temperature is moderate. Get a hat and carry some water.
88,Would be nice if not closed! ,"The castle was used as a forte, so it's by the sea. The view is amazing, and at the sunset is very beautiful. Watch the opening and closing hours, cuz one day we missed it. (Opens at 9 and closes at 17:30). Good visit."
89,historic places,"This castle is a must in Bodrum! The castle has many levels with lush gardens. Peacocks can be found wandering in the gardens. This castle also contains the underwater museum (artifacts that were found underwater, reflecting life during different times in Bodrum's history. Different rooms contained different artifacts, such as coins, storage jars, weapons.There is so much to explore in this castle, that you should allow several hours. The views from the castle over the water is spectacular. You can see the harbor with its many sailing ships."
90,Sadly Shut,We really enjoyed our visit here especially seeing all the pottery jars that were used by the Romans to transport foodstuffs to various ports an seeing different parts of the forts.  Lots of stone stairs from one level to another so this would for not be good for anyone with mobility issues.  very educational about this period of time when this castle was actively occupied by different govenrments
91,Castle of St. Peter,It's a bit confusing but u 'kill two birds with one stone' This extensive site holds many interesting features we loved the British tower with its many artefacts but the other rooms and gardens are great!!! Enjoy we did
92,Ancient Castle,"Went with 4 friends. All enjoyed the visit. Lots of steps so not buggy and wheelchair friendly but plenty of space for kids to run around. Great views and exhibitions. And fun things like an ottoman photo scene, caf√©s, lots of towers and a mocked up dungeon with a cool staircase into the mountain. Nice to spend half a day there. Great views over the bay and marina."
93,CLOSED Castle by the harbour,"Oodles of historical features and artifacts all just lying around for you to look at , nice areas to rest relax and have a bite to eat with fantastic views , worth every penny ."
94,Telling it like it is!,"We walked from Gumbet to Bodrum to see the castle, it's a lot of walking at the castle so be prepared with water etc! The entrance fee is 30TL each but it's worth it.There's so many picture opportunities, so many rooms and so much historical information to read about. A definite must in Bodrum."
95,Amazing!,We were looking forward to our trip to see this castle.  It was unfortunately closed for renovation.   Pretty disappointed
96,"Brilliant site, must see",Just in case you were planning a visit.  You can visit from the outside and the turrets of the different nationalities of the knights of St-John  are bisible.  It still dominates the harbor
97,average place,Nice castle overlooking Bodrum - well worth a visit - good also to consider taking a boat trip to view from seaward side
98,Castle and Museum Closed,"This was an unexpected surprise, we arrived via a cruise ship, walked through the town and found the castle. It's confusing to find the entrance, keep walking till you see a ticket booth.  You also can buy the audio after you enter the castle at a separate booth.  It's a lot to see, many uneven steps, but if you are up for it, totally worth it!  Give yourself at least an hour and a half."
99,Impressive but closed,Definitely worth a visit when you are in Bodrum - views are simply stunning and not only you can see pretty ancient stuff but also bump into a tortoise and a peacock
100,Impressive place,"St Peter castle on the shores of bodrum is a beautiful old crusaders castle that holds a lots of history inside her walls, a perfect time machine for those who wish to go back in time."
101,Gorgeous but closed,"For a few pounds the castle is great value for money very interesting and a lot of artefacts from sunken ships quite a climb so sensible footwear required, was surprised to see a couple of peacocks who seem to enjoy posing for photos, fantastic views from the top."
102,Closed for renovations,"This castle and it's exhibits will keep you cool. There's plenty of shade and the indoor exhibits are air conditioned. In fact, it's probably the coolest place to be in Bodrum on a hot day! The views of the harbour are stunning, there are lots of well presented exhibits and no need for a guide. There is plenty of information in English.Allow 2-3 hours to see it all. There are some very steep bits though. Definitely not wheelchair friendly and if you have a baby buggy you're going to struggle, big time.But definitely worth a visit."
103,must see,it is a nice castle to visit since you are in Bodrum; preferably to go in the morning before getting hot. it needs almost 2hours to visit it all. kids are for free
104,Summer vacation,"This castle is one of the best in Europe, reflecting antiquity and the efforts of the Crusaders.  We enjoyed the use of historical artifacts within the halls and could almost hear the voices of those who had used them.   The beautiful terraces and gardens made a lovely visit on a hot day."
105,must visit place,"Located in bodrum port this castle very well preserved has wonderfull views overlooking the bay ,interesting exhibitions but the entrance fee is 12eur for some of the sightseeing points."
106,Closed until at least April 2018,It holds the underwater archeological museum so you visit bot at the same time. It's a nice visit .... But the museum is much more interesting. Anyway its worth visiting the castle.
107,Soak Up The History,This monument is the highlight sight to visit in Bodrum! don't miss it! a great view to Sea it has and also Musuem inside! you can take memorial photos on the roof
108,The best site of interest in Bodrum,This castle is very old and enjoying one to visit and learning about history also it will be good for Movie shooting if some company plan to.
109,Thanks  for nothing,It was under construction but some parts was open which is we lowed it amazing historic location you must visit when you are in bodrum next time we are going to visit underwater archeological museum in there. Worth every penny
110,Warning castle is closed for 2 years,"Got a taxi into Bodrum to look round the castle. Half of it is closed, yet admission is still full price. Not much of interest to see and no audio guide or anything to make any sense of what you are seeing. We've been here before yet this time round very disappointing. Wouldn't recommend unless you're in Bodrum already and don't mind paying 48Tl each (about ¬£7) to walk around something that would probably be free in the UK."
111,Well worth a Visit,"Although, a lot of the castle was under repair and couldn't be accessed, it is still worth a visit for the various exhibits they have on view"
112,Beautiful yet fascinating,First the Castle is only about 50% open due to renovation. Tho they are charging full price We enjoyed what we were able to see much from nearby shipwrecks.  Huge clay pots that contained wine are everywhere. Amazing to think this was built around 1200.  Definitely would do again.
113,Go After Lunch,Lovely place with great shops. The Marina with all the lovely boats is definately worth a visit. Lots of restaurants to choose from.
114,''When in Bodrum'',This magnificent castle is more like a mini medieval city. Imposing and magestic it is simply one of the best preserved and fascinating castles I‚Äôve been to the layout and sheer size is awesome definitely take a couple of hours to explore and get lost in its amazing history a must if your in Bodrum
115,Definitely worth a visit,Great Attraction in the harbour area of Bodrum. I did not go in but it looked stunning from the outside
116,Amazing view to Bodrum,Unfortunately the castle was closed for renovations only visiting bodrum for the day and didnt find this out until we had got off the ferry from kos it didnt say on its website of closure so disappointed strolled around harbour and shops found tomb of Halicarnassus and amphitheatre nice place to see in the 5hrs we were there
117,Visit to Bodram.,St Peter castle in bodrum isnot worth money.nothing much to visit only building .I didn't enjoy.and it is renovation
118,AMAZING,"A good place to pass a few hours,, plenty to look at and thr views are great across the bay,,, Can very hot, so take some water with you"
119,Well preserved & interesting,The castle was the 2nd most important reason for staying near Bodrum. But it is being renovated and I understand this is going to take a long time. I'm disappointing but I totally understand the reason for it being closed. Something urgently needs doing to the 7 of the 8 windmills overlooking the city. They are in a terrible state. The views of the castle and cranes are still pretty incredible though
120,The best Underwater Archaeology museum in the world!,A must to see when in Bodrum.  Easy access from the Main Street and nice to wander around the grounds
121,Beautiful Castle,The castle is fascinating the moment you step inside. It looks overwhelmingly fascinating from the outside aswell. Has a lot of history to it
122,Worth to visit ,"We visit it of season, so there where not many people and we could really enjoy the beauty of it!The castle is way bigger then what it looks and you would need some hours to fully explore.During my visit I had a feeling that I was a child again going on an adventure! The way the exhibits and room are presented takes you really on a journey through time.In every room you could follow very easily a story, into medieval knights, to ancient Egyptian ships, to Greek tombs, to Ottoman dungeons, to underwater excavation!The courtyard of the castle is also really beautiful, with beautiful gardens, peacocks and turtles running free around you.Overall a very friendly feeling, that invites and stimulates exploration, learning and helps to imagine ""how it all look back then""!"
123,"Bodrum Castle, Castle of St. Peter",The castle houses an extremely interesting exhibition of local underwater archaeological find with good reconstructions of wrecks found.  The exhibits are for the most part presented clearly and with good comparative examples e.g. the coin collection and their worth.Do note however that all the exhibit areas are closed for lunch from 12 - 1 pm something we were not told when we bought our tickets so plan your visit accordingly.
124,Must visit!,The entrance fee was 40tlThere was a nice courtyard and a nice room with jars that used to hold wine nice views but that was about itWe felt a bit underwhelmed
125,INTERESTING CASTLE !!!,"If you want to meet nature, sea, forest, history, colourful flowers, the best option is here. I went to the different eras in the past while walking. The scenery from the castle is breathtaking and perfect for taking photos. You can be a cover photo on a magazine. Museum in the castle has rich in materials."
126,Stunning views,"I love this place so much has caracter beauty and charm. if you come bodrum you must visit this place. The courtyard has a selection - big, small, fat, thin. Oil, wine, cheese, wheat - the amphora was the shipping container of the ancient world. Every city made them in their own style."
127,A taste of the 15th Century: Castle of Saint Peter,"I tought it will be normal visit, but I had a great experience and shot great photos.The history becomes alive once you get in the castle.Try to avoid going in hot times"
128,Amazing !!!,"We visited on a lovely day and spent the day just wandering around the grounds. we visited early in the season and lots of the exibitions werent open , the audio tour was also not available but it was still a pleasnt way to spend the day."
129,Bodrum,Bodrum is just charming. The food is perfect and the port with the bazaar and castle is amazing. It is a must see if you are there.
130,Bodrum Castle,"Well worth a visit, we accessed the castle having arrived at Bodrum Marina by water taxi; the castle is then a couple of minutes' walk along the waterfront. In fabulous condition, the exterior and interior of this fascinating building are well worth a look, as are the historical artefacts and displays within. Allow a morning for a thorough look around."
131,Great views,"You could spend a few hours here.. There is so much to see and with stunning views.. The gardens are beautiful and lots of artefacts, ranging from BC.."
132,Old crusader castle,"This place is great to learn more about the history of the area. It is really interesting and offers you great view all around it. There is also a museum in it. It however has lots of steps inside which can be very tiring especially during hot weather. So try to go there early morning or late-afternoon (be sure to check the hours though!) or a cloudy day. Don't forget your hat, sunscreen and water!"
133,Many stairs,Excellent and  rooted in the history of Turkey.Dolmus nearly to the door of the place.Worth a journey to see  the architecture here.
134,Live history,"It was absolutely stunning, well worth it for history lovers! It was a great day out and I highly recommend going to the castle! It was only 5 lira from our hotel at the family life imperial hotel."
135,the hightlight to visit in Bodrum,As per the title good views and a good museum. Do take water round with you as no where to buy till you leave any and quite hot and sunny. Badly sign posted but in its own way fun to wander round and find the exhibits.
136,Bodrum City,Enjoyed the visit to historical castle with great views. Unfortunately a lit of renovation is being undertaken and quite a bit was closed.
137,Must do when in Bodrum!,"Interesting to see the exibition, but there are many many stairs. There is a beautiful view from the castle to sea the harbour, the beach, the hills!"
138,Absolutely beautiful castle with stunning views!,It is nice to walk around the harbour and see the castle although the castle is being renovated.There are little market stalls along the dockside to cast your eye upon. Also there are lots and lots of boats to see.Worth a walk but make sure you have an ice cream in your hand. He He He
139,Beautifully preserved,Great castle and verywell designed museum.Must see place when you go to Bodrum.Castle is in city centre.
140,Day excursion from Kos to Bodrum ,Bodrum nice city. Weather good.view from castle to marina and city excellent.exhibition very professional
141,"Loads to see, well worth a visit","A great place to get a feel for a crusaders castle. The views of Bodrum bay are fantastic and the street market, docks and restaurants around the castle are a definite must see."
142,Must see. ,We never got to visit as its closed for renovation. You only find this out by getting to the gate and a sign says it. A clue can be found in the crane and scaffolding all over the tower.
143,Really Worth a Visit,I have visited this castle many times and never tired of seeing it again and again.  This castle built by the crusaders has a very good museum of underwater archaeology worth seeing.  Not to mention a photographer's delight of views of Bodrum as well as inside the castle.
144,A touch of Knights' history,Very amazing view from the castle. Visiting bodrum castle is a must. 30 liras is cheap for what you see
145,Fabulous visit,We went Oct 1 2017 and they told us the castle is closed to visitors for 2 years for renovation.  If you are planning a few hours here change your plans because the castle is.closed to visitors.
146,Interesting historical castle,"We spent a couple of hours visiting this attraction, please bear in mind there are lots and lots of steps, so very unsuitable to anyone with walking disabilities, it was very informative and steeped in History, the views are magnificent and it is a must do whilst in Bodrum"
147,Nice castle and beautiful view,"A spectacular castle which can be seen at its best across the harbour and provides the perfect backdrop to an already attractive area.The castle covers a very large area and judging by the number of steps the people all those years ago must have been a lot fitter than now.  The views from the castle walls are very panoramic, a complete view of Bodrum City.Inside, we found it average, it is more of a museum to shipwrecks etc and there was little feel of the history of the original building - it is completely renovated.  Everyone has different interests and this did not hold ours.  It is however well worth a morning's  stroll around and we could see that many people were enjoying their visit."
148,Take In Great Views,"This is a really interesting castle with lots of different elements good value for the 30 Turkish lira.  As well as walking through the different parts of the castle their are within it small museum areas displaying artifacts retrieved from underwater wrecks, glassware and gold items.  There is quite a bit of walking and climbing up and down uneven steps so if you are elderly or infirm then this may prove difficult especially in the summer heat of Bodrum."
149,Beautiful views,Very nice view point you can find from there. Also this place full of history. I was here 2 times and 2 time I have seen it from different sides.It is heart of bodrum. To come to this castle is my advice for all tourists.
150,Some interesting exhibits,Great site to vist when your in bodrum it beautiful we took some lovely pictures it's on the marina where there's some great boats and lots of trips available
151,Crusader Castle Packed with History,I went into the castle on two days - I was that impressed! There's lot's to see and do if you're interested in ancient  archaeology or the Knights Hospitaller. Take your time and wander - there's a lot to get around and lots of climbing/stairs - so make sure that you wear sensible shoes. Entrance is either 16TL (¬£3) or 32TL (¬£6) in high season. Well worth actually going inside rather than loitering outside and taking photo's. The detail given in the information beside every exhibit in the underwater archaeology is very well thought out and informative.
152,Amazing place,"Interested in visiting a real Crusader castle, packed with history and now containing superb underwater ship wreck recoveries? Then this is the place for you. Reasonably priced entry, and set aside two hours to see everything and walk the magnificent ramparts and enjoy the view."
153,Interesting historic site with great views across Bodrum,Bodrum castle Really very nice And very good viem And very antiqie I like castle And Bodrum highly recommed
154,Bodrum Castle,"great view from the top terrace, many exhibition areas with different themes. the room related to Crusade is also interesting in understanding Bodrum's history."
155,Full of interesting stuff,"Having been for a walk around the castle it would have been unfair not to visit here ,though found it interesting it was a lot of different culture to the castle in the different towers around it"
156,Views and Histroy,"A shame as from the outside and views from the road driving in it looked really interesting. Great position overlooking the harbour and the town, having said that it is clearly in need of restoration so not surprised."
157,Get fit at the castle,"We didn't expect much of Bodrum, assuming it is mainly a party-package tour city. Spending our first night in Turkey in Bodrum we stayed for practical reasons in Bodrum and decided to visit early in the morning the castle/museum. We we pleasantly surprised. A really nice castle, and the archaeological museum is really a gem. If you decide to travel around Turkey consider to spend a few hours here!"
158,Worth a visit,It was lovely visiting this place on a late afternoon to skip the hot sunny hours. The castle is big enough to fill 2 hours or more. I hust loved the views up there and the cool breeze. Not bad for spending an afternoon...
159,Loved it!,"what a fantastic day out!!!! admission price very reasonable, and kids were FREE!! the castle itself was fantastic with the added bonus of housing the underwater archaeological museum with some really interesting exhibits, the kids loved the replica roman ship as were learning about the romans at school. all the staff we came across were friendly and helpful with good English skills and a wealth of information. Great views all round with brilliant photographic opportunities all the way round with great views of bodrum bay as far as the eye could see.please don't miss this fantastic opportunity to visit a real piece of Turkish history."
160, Historically interesting ,Fabulous views fascinating history peaceful place very romantic place to unwind ideal for a proposal Of marriage
161,"Good value, very interesting",Visited Bodrum Castle in September 2019. The castle undergoing some works so only 50% of castle open to public but still well worth a visit.Castle is at far end of Bodrum harbour at end of a small isthmus. Entrance is from the walkway alongside the harbour. Great views and lots to take pictures of. An exhibition on artifacts found in a shipwreck was there although mostly seemed to be a collection of amphora. A small religious site is a lovely place to see with great air conditioning. A huge collection of artifacts on show from Roman and Persian statues to canonballs and anchors and all sorts of carvings. Castle can be a very hot place with limited shade so maybe try and visit at start or end of day. Would recommend visiting Bodrum Castle very much.
162,mikejboyle,"Although there is some restoration going on, and certain areas were closed for visitors, this is a truly remarkable spot with a significant history. If you come alone you might struggle with a lack of information, so I would suggest you hire a professional tour guide. The castle is quite big, but walking around is very pleasant and not very physically demanding. There are some amazing spots with the sea view, that you would most certainly enjoy"
163,Amazing views ,"If you go to Bodrum, then you MUST see this castle.  I believe it was built during the time of the crusades, and it is definitely worth a visit.You follow the signs to walk around the place, and there is a quick tour and a detailed tour, my advice is the detailed tour!The Ship which they found off the coast is in a museum here, and certainly worth seeing, even if it is just a mock up. Really well done, and shows how Olive Oil was transported, and how valuable it was!"
164,Interesting castle history of Bodrum,"The Castle has the added attraction of housing the Underwater Archeological Museum . The Castle grounds contain a dungeon , interesting  statues , a great display of Amphora and mosaics . Fantastic views from the walls and towers and shady gardens to rest and enjoy . Be prepared to spend around 3 hours in order to take it all in"
165,Huge castle,"We went to castle it was amazing , we paid around 10 euro for entrance fee.After that we visit windmills on the hill.Perfect place for take a photo and view of bodrum bay."
166,Must visit,This place is by far  Historically interesting. The different populations that have been ruling in this area makes it really interesting to spend some hours. Don't forget to check the small room thru out the castle. You can use your phone as support but also with the things on display there is a explanation. There are some stairs you have to take. So wheelchair and people with difficulties in walking it is somewhat more difficult to get around.
167,"Mr B. Wilson Chelmsford, England","One afternoon I have decided to visit this castle, not to sit at the hotel. This facility is after, or during renowation. History of underwater excavation was the biggest attraction. Also view is worth to see. But lifts of reconstruction company destroy the spirit of this place.Get prepared for 65 TL entrance ticket"
168,Holiday special ,It's a must to do on your list... great views of bodrum coast left and right good for photography . Loads of information about bodrum history. Just be careful the steps are very steep in some parts of the castle.
169,Something to do to fill the day,Absolutely place to visit in bodrum. At this moment on restauration. But ones open please go there. Garden cafe is also very cute
170,A Castle with Amazing views :),"Me and my girlfriend went here for an afternoon for something to do and to see the views that everyone has been saying about, it was both educational and fun, the views from the top are well worth the climb. I would defiantly recommend taking lots of water with you as we were extremely thirsty when we got to the top.. Also on your way out you can dress up in traditional Turkish gowns and a picture only cost 10lira which is well worth it"
171,A must!,One of the best monuments i have ever visited..so well renovated as people still live there..make sure you have enough time to see it all!
172,Very disappointed ,This place is filled with history and surrounded with narrow streets.A must see while in Bodrum.it is a place brings to us (greeks) sasdness but is beatifull
173,A must see! ,Good time if you like history and there is alot here through the ages. Get lost in the battlements and in the towers or sit quietly in the gardens photo shoots a must with the statues and peacocks. Its hot so go later in the day.
174,Lovely views,"Very little to see with the majority of the castle closed, but no discount on the entry. Very little context of explanation of the site."
175,Amazing trip we enjoyed a lot,"Probably a must see if in Bodrum as there is much to look at including the town itself.Beware:  steps and paths can be steep and unguarded in places. Many of the exhibitions are closed between midday and 1.00pm, and you cannot get re-entry if you miss them.  Also there are no refreshment areas inside the castle area itself, so at least take a bottle of water."
176,Amazing interactive experience!,"One place of Bodrum that no visitor to this great city should miss is the famous Bodrum Castle (aka Castle of St. Peter), which overlooks the harbor and the international marina. This castle was constructed by the Knights of Rhodes in the 15th century during the crusades of the middle ages, and it was given the name The Castle of St. Petrus, or Petronium.Occupying over 30.000 square feet at its base, construction of this castle took years to complete. The castle was built partly from the left remains of the mausoleum of Mausolus which had collapsed as the result of an earthquake. The entrance of the castle is through the first door situated in the northwestern corner. There are 7 doors before you reach the inner castle. The northern and western sides are double-walled. The thick walled structure with a sloping roof at the west side is a cannon blockhouse. All the towers and various places in the Castle of Bodrum have been converted into exhibition halls for the Underwater Archaeology Museum. The Bodrum Castle is open to the public and it houses Bodrum‚Äôs remarkable Museum of Underwater Archaeology and also hosts several Turkish cultural festivals throughout the year.Visiting hours: 9.00am ‚Äì 4.30pm(12:00 noon-13:00 pm some Halls are closed except Chapel, English Tower and GlassHall)Entrance Fee: 20 YTL (Free for Children).Not to Miss!"
177,Wonderful,"This place is huge.  plan on 3 hours and bring water. We climed all the steps and saw everything,  It was a worthwhile visit for 30 TL each."
178,"Amazing views, lots of history! ",Only reason we came to Bodrum was to visit castle (not stalls selling manner of tatt). Castle closed during tourist season. Continually embarrassed by sellers. Will never come back and tell others not to bother.
179,Interesting visit. The views are nice. The history behind it is fascinating,Excellent day out for families or couples on ur own always meet very friendly people warm and kind hearted
180,Fun attraction to see when in Bodrum,We chose bad Timing for so many stairs ... this was nice to see but for my personal expirience i didnt like it. We got some nice pics but I wish you could go in at night when its not that hot.
181,Beautiful views,"This is a great castle to visit (and make sure you leave a few hours and go in the cooler part of the day). The castle is really well maintained, there are great sea views everywhere. Staff at display areas are knowledgeable and helpful. There are peacocks preening away. The artefacts and displays of amphora pots and the old days of sea transport are very interesting. A great castle to immerse yourself in history!!!"
182,Calessi ,"Some amazing views from the tower top across the bay!! It's well worth a hike to the top to see across the bay and the marina.There are examples of early Byzantine mosaics, storage vessels, an example of how a ship was constructed. The hall used for banquets along with the various flags of the country."
183,King Arthur's second home.,"bodrum has these places copied from greece with one castle , wind mill etc .. better take a gud resort n send time in it"
184,One of the few historic sites in Bodrum,This is a must for a trip to bodrum great history and beautiful. The museum it self is interesting in parts particularly if you are into archeology if not its just a load of old pots. I would say that it's not the best attractions  to visit with children or elderly relatives as there are a lot of steep and deep steps and just make sure to take water as it can get very hot.
185,Very nice Historical  one ,Visitors to Bodrum expecting to be able to visit the Castle and Underwater Archaeological Museum should be aware that both are closed for at least two years (from May 2018) for renovations. There is no notification on the museum website or any other website as far as I can tell. I made the trip from Spain to Bodrum specifically to see the Uluburun wreck exhibits only to find the area of the castle and museum fenced off. The young lady in the Tourist Information Office nearby admitted that the management had not made any announcement about the closure. Presumably they still want to entice visitors to the town. To say I was miffed is a bit of an understatement.
186,Whatching a pretty view of Bodrum from this castle,"The castle which is now an underwater archaeology museum represents the buildings constructed by Hospitallier Knights. They are well-maintained and have a perfect internal navigation. There are perfect views onto the Aegean bays. The tour should last at least 1 hour. Please mind the sun during a summer visit, We were there at 35 Celsius and it was too difficult for our 12-year-old child to withstand the heat. The castle is worth visiting and leaves a deep impression."
187,"Must go place, amazing views & museum","The castle is a great sight from afar day and night and is one of the most photographed places on the Bodrum peninsular . We have seen the Castle at least 40 times in the last 20 years , and finally went in . Well worth the visit as it takes you back in history and away from the hustle and bustle of Bodrum . Took plenty of memorable photos of inside the castle , and pictures looking over Bodrum as well . That alone for me was worth it , but you will see plenty to like inside including a small museum and just the sheer history . Short visit but worth it ."
188,Beautiful Location and view,"This trip has been all about the history. From the cruise ship, you can walk 35-40 minutes, along the coast and thru an active marketplace to get to the castle, (shop on the way back). Castle structure is very good, about 1400 AD.Plenty of places to shop or stop for coffee/drink on the way home. Even dip your feet in the water"
189,"Fascinating Architecture... But... The Crusader Castle at Bodrum has no minaret, so you are showing the wrong photo.",fantastic views all around you will need to put aside at least 2 hours to visit here you will also need plenty of water on a hot day  very interesting place it is not a visit for the unfit a lot of stairs old stone stairs very big gap between stairs 2feet at least so big steps needed up and down and lots of them  but it is  worth the clime for the views alone  many artefacts thousands of years old   it realy worth the visit tho   but like I said if you not totally mobile I would give it a miss price to get in ¬£7.50 adult
190,Great place to wander,"The views are beautiful! It is such a big place, you can spend a whole afternoon there and just really adore the history of the place."
191,Historic place,"Castle of St Peter dominates the view of the harbour in Bodrum. It is a stunning fortress with towers in different styles built with funding from various countries during the Crusades. The museum and artifacts inside are incredible, as are the views from the towers. Must see!"
192,Must visit,The castle is currently close and apparently will be for two years according to the information centre but nowhere is there any indication untill you actually get to the castle.  Really very disappointing.
193,Not to be missed,"As I have been in a habit of visiting Bodrum Castle and the Underwater Museum during every visit ever since I came there for the first time, I was really disappointed about standing before closed doors now. For tourists looking for information on the internet this new scenario had not been made public enough by the authorities. The only thing I can do now is remember past strolls across the castle and museum or look at its panorama from Kumbah√ße, if possible when the sun is going down."
194,Interesting but random! Great views!,Turkey has lots of castle but Bodrum Castle( St.Peter) is different from others with unique undersea artefacts museum and sculpture of Homeros
195,"A must-do for history buffs - Superb views, Great ancient castle","The Castle of St Peter is quite a sight - and offers beautiful views of the harbor and the town of Bodrum.  We visited with a guide as part of a cruise excursion.  From the pier where we docked the ride on the boat was just 20 minutes of scenic views.  Unfortunately for us our guide was given 46 tourists when half that number would have been easier to manage - and for us more pleasant.  It was a crowded day and the many rooms become a bit overloaded.  The mausoleum for Aida includes some of her jewelry, which is beautiful to see.  Small rooms throughout the site showcase old coins, glass, pottery, jewelry and other artifacts recovered from sunken vessels.  The tower of England was open and was something to see, too.  There are quite a few steps and the paving is uneven, so comfortable shoes are helpful.  Some of the restrooms are old style, meaning that instead of commodes there might be a porcelain hole in the ground -- not for me but luckily the facilities with commodes were not far away.  I would like to come back when not on a crowded tour to learn more of the crusader history, which was difficult to hear given the size of our group and number of other groups around us."
196,Wonderful historical attraction,"Fascinating, beautiful and culturally significant.  Well worth a visit but wear comfy shoes, take water as there are lots of steep steps to climb and it's massive."
197,Interesting castle with spectacular views,"The castle of St Peter is a place which I visit always when I am in Bodrum because it‚Äôs one of my favourites on the peninsula. I recommend to go there in the afternoon before the sun goes down. Then the atmosphere is best, especially if you are a photographer. The views of Bodrum and the glittering sea with all the boats can be overwhelming. Sometimes a lot of visitors hustle around, so you need to be patient if you want to take certain motives as photos. In any case there are a lot of romantic corners. - This time I paid 68 tl entrance fees for the castle and the underwater museum. Go there early enough because you might need two hours and more for your visit. Construction work has been going on in the castle for quite some time now. Two cranes might spoil your view ..."
198,Must see for its historic value,"The castle stand impressively above Bodrum. Unfortunately, it is closed for renovations ""until further notice."" Nonetheless it's still an impressive sight although the large crane and cladding mar the view."
199,if you like Castles,"The castle is extremely easy to find,. Being in the centre of bodrum town. Entry is on the gate and quite reasonable Once inside the castle you can read the history in English and there are statues and artifacts. Take your camera - the views over the harbour are truly stunning!!!!"
200,Breathtaking,ƒ∞f you like the history you can spend 1-2 hours while enjoying the üè∞. The stairs might be difficult if you have any difficulty to walk however when you go upstairs you will enjoy the view.
201,A very nice afternoon,"It was the first time we are visited the castle abd that was amazing exprience. Wonderful place with underwater museum and beautiful trees and flowers inside and amazing view to bodrum bay and sea and boats. Good place too photography, also walking alot around the castle and stairs. There are beautiful Peacocks and Turtles. Normally it takes 3 hours to visit this castle and exhibition. But if you have time there are lot's of stuff to see. Don't miss it!"
202,Excellent,"This is a reasonably impressive castle of the late middle ages. However it also contains the museum of underwater archeology and is littered with sculp[ture, including classical statuary and Ottoman headstones. Towers display bits of arms and armour as well as archeological treasures. The boat displays are very good and there are hundreds of amphoras and a great many examples of early metal working and glassmaking. On a hot day, the air-conditioned display rooms are a great comfort. Be warned - once you have entered the museum there are no refreshments until you exit - so take water with you."
203,Well worth a visit,"This castle is worth a visit, even if just to enjoy the amazing views. Definitely not suitable for anyone unsteady of their feet."
204,Atmoshpere of the garden,"If you are looking for a amazing view to Bodrum, it is one the best place. It is very beautiful and it has e museum inside of the castle. Good to see."
205,Hot day at castle,"As a bodrum visitor this place must be visited , we visited there in jul it was really hot , it takes about one hour to see everywhere inside , the space takes you to roman times , from the castle you have good view of the bay with beatiful yatches at anchor .there were some repairs going on inside the castle & some parts where closed to visitors.ticket price is 48tl."
206,Must see castle,We visited this August as part of our two week holiday to Bodrum to soak up some culture and we were not disappointed. The castle is large with plenty of exhibits to see all with explanations and information to read. The gardens and outdoor areas are clean and well tended with staff on hand in the indoor areas. Plenty to see and a great way to get in some stunning views as you explore further and higher up. Great visit with a small refreshment cafe.
207,Worth the Visit,Nothing to see or learn about history of this place they took ticket money without any credit or benefit of knowledge
208,LANDMARK CASTLE,The castle is a historic must-see location in Bodrum. It does require a bit of effort to explore but the view from above is worthwhile.
209,Very worthwhile visit,Amazing views of the city for the top of the castle. Go when it's cooler and not mid morning as we did üåûüåû no facility at the time of visit to sit and grab a drink and most exhibitions blow between 12-1 so plan ahead. Definitely worth a trip but at 30 lira a head this could end up being an expensive hour or so üëç
210,Best Castle ever,A wonderful castle to amble around. A great place to book a wedding for. Have been a couple of times and enjoyed it even though im not really into history.
211,Castle tour and windmills,We paid 52 tl/person as admission fee. But the accessible place were quite small. I will not recommend this place unless the restoration was completed.
212,A must see castle,As you approach the castle from the sea or view from across the harbour it looks superb but unfortunately after walking all around and being ever so keen to see the wonderful displays we discovered it was closed. Even this information was difficult to discover.
213,A great visit.,"A must do if you are staying in Bodrum! Easy to find, not too expesive for 30 Turkish Lira per person and lots to see. The money you pay gives you access to both the Castle and the Underwater Museum, be advised though, tgey have lunch break 12.00-13.00 when the museum rooms are closed but you can still stoll around in the castle. Lots to see and great views of Bodrum and surrounding area!"
214,Lovely,"The Castle of St. Peter is also the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology. As in the last review I made, it was built by the Knights Templar (Knights of Rhodes). The fortifications and rooms are intact and represents those of castles during the Crusades. The view from the ramparts are great; you can see the entire city and harbor of Bodrum and also the Greek island of Kos, which is 7 miles off the coast. This castle is constructed with stones and blocks from the Tomb of Mausolus (one of the 7 wonders of the Ancient World).  The history of Bodrum (Halicarnassus from the Carian League) is a must to see."
215,lots of history,"The Bodrum Museum of underwater archaeology (within the castle grounds), is a must see for anyone interested in ancient history, ancient shipwrecks and civilisations, divers etc. Do not be put off by having to pay 30tl entrance fee it is really really worth it! The castle itself is extremely well maintained and looks like it could have been built in the last 10 years, everything is  labelled in several languages and you can get your own guide or pay for a headset to give you a guided tour as you go round, or simply buy a guidebook and amble around in your own time. Each room has its own themed exhibits and breathtaking displays of ancient treasures, my favourite was the glass display and I spent at least an hour in this room alone. Take your time, look at everything, and soak up the past. If you feel like a little rest take some time to sit and marvel at the view from the battlements or chillout in the rather beautiful courtyard gardens drinking tea."
216,Great family day out,"Very beautiful and magnificent place, it was a part of Hallicarnassus.Once it was one of the world's seven wonders. After15 th century turkey ruined it finally as a wonder and reconstructed as a mosque. Nevertheless visiting you fill the power of ancient Greece and Spain. The view is fantastic the sea unforgettable!"
217,Tour of the castle,Just an intro as half castle closed for uogrades .. When fully finished willbe wonderful experience I had last time .. feel.price should have been halved but stillworth it just for views
218,Amazing views,"There is much to see, but not so good with small kids. You need to go a lot, many stairs. Few of the rooms are fitted with aircondition which help you cool down a few times :-)"
219,So much to see,When it is fully open this is a terrific place to spend a couple of hours ... even now there are still wortwhile experiences. Food and drink freely avaiable. So just drink in the atmosphere of this historic venue. Built by Knights of St John. Very close to town centre. Superb views from top ... great for photography.
220,"Beautiful view from the castle to sea the harbour, the beach, the hills!","Avoid lunch time 12 midday to 1pm as the rooms are not available. Excellent artefacts on show, very well preserved. Lots of steep, slippy steps so not for the infirm, but well worth the visit"
221,When in Bodrum.....see the Castle!,"nicely reovated good keept still renovating ,tower and a few other things was not open but still vere well done"
222,Well worth a visit,This is the top of the list place to visit. Take 2-3 hours. The underwater museum is inside the Castle.
223,So much to see,"We travelled from Turguteris on the Dolmas to Bodrum and spent a lovely few hours at the Castle and museum. It is really interesting with lots to see and enjoy.The views are fantaatic, just go careful walking around we did slip on the floor once or twice."
224,Nice afternoon activity,Lots of history and antiquities. Not for those with mobility issues obviously lots of uneven ground and big steps. But if you do make it to the top spectacular views. Could do with somewhere inside to get refreshments as the only place I saw was just before you exit
225,Amazing,"If you are a European castle buff, you will truly enjoy this huge and beautful work of both necessity and art. Plan to spend a while and enjoy.  It will give you a new concept of Castles."
226,Sightseeing,"Well worth a few hours for anyone with an interest in history or the sea. Besides the 'usual' kinds of things you would normally expect to find within a castle, it is also the home of the museum of underwater archeology, with some truly fascinating exhibits. An area also rich in ancient history, the 'Karian Princess' is another exhibit of great interest. Currently undergoing restoration, not everything is open at the moment (July 2019) so check in advance."
227,Good fun ,"There is not a lot of sightseeing to do in Bodrum. But this is a must do. Big, well preserved castle. Great views. Bring water though as you will like a drink as you go up and down all those stairs. Not everywhere very friendly for people with difficulty to walk stairs."
228,Breathtaking.,"Right on the Marina, lies the grant castle os St. Peter. Currently the place is undergoing renovation so entire place is not open to see. Never the less some areas are open, so since one is in Bodrum, should visit. Generally a good structure overlooking the sea. Also has a museum off underwater archeology in it.  Tickets are 40 TL for both."
229,"Great castle, lots to see!","So sad to see so many narrow minded people slating this marvel purely because of renovations. Well guess what no renovations, no venue. Well done Turkey for looking after your national treasures and keeping them so that we can come back and marvel at its opulence!Will surely be back to see it once it is open!"
230,Amazing ,"There are many different rooms to see, all of them containing artifacts from before the turn of the century - there is even part of a roman ship in one of them = not to be missed .."
231,Fascinating,"Bodrum has so much to offer, it is hard to choose one. But, if you are visiting Bodrum to do more than just lying on the beaches, the Castle of St. Peter is the one attraction that has historical significance. The castle is also home of the Museum of Underwater Archaeology, probably the only one of its kind in Europe. The city views from the castle are also excellent. Well worth the visit."
232,Nice castle,"As the castle had been completely  closed on my first visit to Bodrum,  I thought this time I would still pay a visit. I like others, thought it a shame that the restoration is yet not completed , but was surprised with the amount of the castle you could walk around and the stunning views as you looked out at the upper part of the castle you could get to. Was it value for money, well maybe when everything us accessible, then yex"
233,Nice castle,"By far one of the best locations of a castle I have seen outside of the UK. It's been incredibly preserved and the museum is housed within it, utilising the many rooms and courtyard areas to display the vast array of artefacts and pieces that may otherwise have been lost. The whole experience was a thoroughly enjoyable one that I suggest everyone (even if history isn't really your thing) to visit. It's about ¬£7 ($10 or 30TL) to enter."
234,Amazing view ,Really a must see! So much to see and you can walk arundel easily for a few hours. The view is also amazing and there are still peacocks living there. Really nice and beautiful to see. Great ambiance.
235,"Interesting displays, wonderful views","Being one of Bodrum best knows sites, it's a shame that this place is still not fully opened. It is open and you can take pictures, but lots of it is still closed for repairs ect. I can understand the need for it needing to be repaired, but why they don't do this from November until The Season starts puzzles me. Still a nice area to walk around, as it's right on the Marina, very near to shops, cafes, eating & drinking places ect."
236,Stunning views,We had travelled to Bodrum from Akbuk and decided to visit the castle. 30 TL (¬£8) entry but I must say well worth it. Spent around 2 hours inside exploring the history of the place. The English tower home of the nights of St John was wonderful. The whole place was superb. The views out from the castle walls to die for. The history going back millennia could be read and it's impossible to under estimate it's place in the history of the eastern Mediterranean . You do not need to be a history buff to enjoy this site. If near you have to visit.
237,Good views and museum ,"At the ancient glass house in middle of all this splendid place to be seen in early morning best there on a wall hangs a miniature homage to the divers and finders. It is glory. 18,000 dives! Just for you to contemplate the godhead, so maybe god kept them at it."
238,Lovely Castle Spectacular Views ,"take your time to visit this place, do not hurry to finish it :) every angle tells its own history, don't miss the dungeon :)"
239,Really enjoyed it :),"Also known as Bodrum Castle, the impressive fortress has 5 towers representing the   countries of the Knights that built them - England, France, Germany. Spain and Italy. This place also houses the awesome Museum of Underwater Archaeology which displays thousands of ancient glass, coins, bronze, amphoras, etc. recovered from ship wrecks in and around the region.We were there on a Monday and the Castle was open even though the website said  they are closed on Monday (regardless of season). Recommend doing the audio tour as it explains everything as you go along and adds a good perspective of each collection being displayed.Only accepts Turkish Lira (or credit cards) for entrance."
240,Beauitful,The castle is much larger than one imagines from the outside and to do it justice you really need a good few hours to look around. From the ancient carvings from the early Knights Templar to the display of early amphorae and various other displays inside the castle it is really a worthwhile attraction to visit.
241,must see in Bodrum,Information that had not been available here is that both the Castle and the Underwater museum are closed for renovations at this time and seems will be closed for a long period. Those planning a trip may want to try to check when they do re-open again.We were not so fortunate to find this out beforehand and made our way to Bodrum to find these main attractions closed.
242,excellent castle and museum; mind the step!,"Castle was closed but some parts was open we just visit in there even that much amaze us a lot we just love it atmosphere, architecture and history‚Äôs was breathtaking we will go again when they open completely we recommend everyone."
243,St peters castle,Expected more...Still under construction(has been for very long) Paid 47lira to walk around an old building with no information about the castle.Exhibits average...Just...average
244,Great....must see,"Relatively well preserved. Currently undergoing restoration works, which affects the access of visitors in certain areas. Entrance fee: 65 TL. In the summer season (April-October) it is open from 10:00 to 22:00, although I hadn't found this information anywhere on the net. Monday is closed (unverified information). It houses a small archeological museum, Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archeology, located in rooms placed in different parts of the castle. Not very spectacular, interesting, though. They also have a small cafe in the inner courtyard (they have no beer ...) and at least one peacock that wanders freely there."
245,Pricey for what it is,"If you are in Bodrum, you should see the Bodrum Castle at least once at the night!It really seems nice..."
246,Great historic castel,"After eating all that delicious seafood in a local restaurant,  the Castle is the place to work it off whilst learning of the ancient maritime history of the region, viewing the stunning glass collection and enjoying the unparalleled views of Bodrum and its harbours. Rarely is walking and stair climbing more enjoyable and informative."
247,Love it!,"Sadly 50% the castle was under renovation in July 2019. It still doesn‚Äôt stop them charging you 100% of the entry price.The castle is filled with beautiful roman and what looks like hellenistic carvings and parts of ruins (columns/pillars/statues etc)Unfortunately, there is no guides to be seen.Likewise, the chapel which was converted to a mosque has had its crypt exposed, with buried remains exposed to tourists. Not very dignified at all."
248,You'll stay longer than anticipated:),This certainly taught us lots about the history over the ages .... watch out tho for the spiders .... i saw 4 (eek!) and dont forget to dress up and have ur foto taken at the end ....
249,Loved!,"Title says it all but I wanted to clarify a few things. Not sure why there are 3 different ""attractions"" on TA for the same place. The museum and archeology exhibit are all within the castle/fort. Another thing is that people mention the climbing. The climbing isn't that bad at all (compared to other sites in Turkey i.e. Ephesus, Priene, and Milas). Yes, it will be difficult for old folks to climb up as any old ruin would. Other than that, check this out!"
250,A gem in the town,"There are areas of the castle that might be difficult for those with walking difficulties, but the history and the views are well worth the visit"
251,Spend an hour browsing here!,Currently closed for refurbishment. You can still see it‚Äôs magnificence from a distance but near the entrance it‚Äôs all covered over and the crane is there.
252,Castle of St. Peter / Bodrum / Turkey,"I can't give this a 5 star because unfortunately some of the areas of interest were closed, however the parts we were able to see were very interesting.  I missed the kitchens üòï which I particularly wanted to see - couldn't face going back in as it was sooooo hot and my feet hurt. Its a lovely place to visit, beautifully kept and well worth a visit.  The history surrounding it is fascinating but I would strongly recommend some reading up before your visit and check up on when everything is open to view."
253,Must see ,"Been to many ancient historical sites to compare with including Ephesus in Kudasasi, Acropolis in Athens, Pompeii in Naples, and Pantheon/Vatican/St. Angelo's in Rome.  This is a great historical monument. The castle is in great condition - allow 2 hours for a high level visit to cover all the grounds and various sections of this large structure.  If you are a history buff, you may want to allow more time. Difficult to walk - young and old were seen huffing and puffing but not impossible - we saw many seniors (60s to 70s) - go slow, wear very good walking shoes with good traction - sneakers would do nicely. Go on a nice clear day to get the most of the phenomenal shoreline and ocean views. They only take credit card and Turkish lira (cash). Close to lots of shops and restaurants - within 5-10 minutes walking distance. About 20-25 minutes walk from port of Bodrum."
254,Great visit,"Well worth a visit, even if just for the views from the top of the battlements.Unfortunately not all of the areas are open at the moment as there are extensive renovations going on."
255,Great Historic Castle,"The castle isn‚Äôt signposted very well and finding the entrance could be a bit tricky. Located on the harbour, next to some lovely cafes, it‚Äôs entrance is modern and new. With the Turkish Museum Kart entrance is included. Entrance fee is around 75TL otherwise. Good COVID 19 procedures are in place. We spent nearly two hours looking around this fortress and the underwater Museum. The information is written in Turkish and English. Discovering the ancient trade routes, wine merchants and the building of the castle is really interesting. A must visit in Bodrum."
256,We got pleasure filling the power of past and history!,Bodrum is ine of the most popular touristical places in Turkey with nice beaches and restaurants . Additionally this place has ancient historical sites sucu as the Bodrum Castle which is in the heart of the city by the seaside and you must visor to feel the ancient atmosphere within.
257,Amazing views that take your breath away ,"Pride of Bodrum, the Castle was completed by the Crusaders with heavy additions in the 15th Century and survives in good condition today. Overlooking modern Bodrum, the castle now includes the first underwater archeology museum of the world and some wonderful cafes. The best views of Bodrum are from the top of the castle. The annual Ballet festival in late August and early September is a cultural highlight."
258,History,You can only enter the castle if you buy tickets of the underwater archeology museum. In august 2019 only 50% of the castle was open for public because of a renovation. The castle is really breathtaking with the high and big walls view over the sea. Really worth a visit. I only missed information about when it was built and why and who owned it during time. So if you wanna know more about the castle IT self use internet.
259,"Much to see, not good with small kids.","The historical castle and the museum inside the venue is still closed for renovation and improvement works. It is expected to be open in the autumn of 2019. It is the number one ""must see"" location for all visitors to Bodrum but you should check the exact opening date when planning your visit."
260,Castle for 6,Half of the doorways in the castle have the classic Roman Arch which have weathered perfectly over the centuries.  The other doorways are cover by large stone stabs.  In each and every case the slabs above the doorways have fractured because of the massive weight.Don't pay to use the grotty little bathrooms outside the castle gate.  The washrooms inside are clean modern and free.
261,castle trip,"You can not go to bodrum without visiting the castle. It‚Äôs bodrum‚Äôs most well-known site and its definitely worse visiting. But when I went there only half of the castle was open. But the areas of the castle that were open where pretty interesting. Especially the museum of underwater Archaeology, that I only saw to rooms of it. But I would return to bodrum to learn and explore the whole castle and museum. A very interesting place."
262,Packed with treasures,I went to visit this Castle on the 2nd August 2019.  I asked the very sullen girl at the ticket office if she had any information in the form of a leaflet she grunted no and pointed at a sign that said the castle was being refurbished.The Castle is in a fabulous location but no information in the grounds whatsoever.  I passed numerous placques on the walls which had Coats of Arm but no information.  I think that the Castle is only 25% open but they still charge a fairly hefty admissiion charge.  Overall a very disappointing experience except for the view.
263,Nice to Visit,"The famous Bodrum Castle or The Castle of St.Petrus alone was worthy the trip to Bodrum. Occupying over 30.000 square feet at its base  it gives quite a walk and quite an inspiration to the visitors. There should not be any hesitations to take half of the day to plan vititing this amazing place. The best achitects of the world of the XVth and later centuries were invovlved in building this masterpiece. The collection of amphoras on the territory is very nice, but the ancient ship with the ancient glass, coins, etc. taken from the bottom of the sea is just breath taking."
264,Very nice! ,"The castle was built by the knights of St. John. The third one if it's type after Jerusalem & Rhodes. So very interesting architecture & construction. It's located on a promontory & so has fabulous views overlooking Bodrum & it's pretty bay. Easy to walk to from a cruise ship too, through the very varied market! There is an audio tour apparently, although we actually did a guided tour & it has to be said that because the contents of the castle is rather random both the audio & guided tour come across as random & inconsistent. I think if you go knowing that there are things displayed here that have little or nothing to do with the knights of St. John, then you won't be disappointed. For example they have an exhibition of a Bronze Age barge & another about Queen Aida, (Alexander the greats step Mother) I don't know her relationship to the castle but it is still very interesting. They (university of Manchester apparently) used facial reconstruction to discover what she looked like. They have some of the treasures found in her sarcophagus on display here too. There's also the British Tower, which again is very interesting but alongside the flags & shields of the knights of St. John is a pirates flag... but I'm no expert, so who knows! The castle is also bigger on the Inside than it looks. The Audio tour is about ‚Ç¨15 as at Oct '16"
265,Great castle/museum,Bodrum Castle is one of the icons of the town. It is the center of Bodrum. Nice place to visit. Suggested.
266,Very Good!,"Constructed with the mausoleum stones (one of the seven Wounders of the Ancient world) .  The castle's towers were alloted to four nationalities, English,French, German and Italian. The museum of Underwater Archeology is in the castle, and the view of the city is unique."
267,Interesting Visit,Grrreat for all ages but castle has very steep climbs so unacsessable to some elderly. But overall what a fantastic day
268,Nice day visit,"It's a bit hard to wander round in the heat, but glad we did.You get great views over bodrum here. Lots of different towers to explore. We liked the English one...like a home from home!Beware of the times you visit...the building housing the bronze age boat closes at 12pm...we were taking a slow walk through and it was obvious a staff member wanted us gone so he could lock up.Lots of shady trees in the main part at the top."
269,Best views in town,International renowned castle that charges 30 Turkish lira entrance fee.Unlike everywhere else in Bodrum  they will not accept euros as payment .So like many many others on our cruise we just gave up and didn't bother.
270,The Castle...St Peter's Bodrum,This was an amazing place a few years ago but it's been under renovation for a year and half so far. I popped down to see what changes had been made but only 50% of the castle was open. I think once the renovations are done it will be great. Also the toilets were closed so make sure you have gone before you go in. But overall still worth a look.
271,"Extensive, good value",Another awesome experience right on your door step if you're staying in Bodrum. Thoroughly enjoyed!!
272,Voice of History,"After a few negative reviews about only certain parts being reopened........Not an issue! What is open is wonderful and we had a lovely afternoon strolling through the grounds, admiring the views and the artefacts around the place. Well worth a visit and for a nominal 40Lira - worth a visit. Tips for parents - given the stairs no strollers in the grounds, prams are all left at the gate. Take a baby carrier & a stroller cover as they'll be out in the sun while you explore the castle."
273,The best tour guide ever made this the best tour ever!,Closed for restoration. No one knows till when. Even there is a wall around it so that you can not see it from outside. Only from far away it is visible.
274,A must to do,"nice veiw from the top on sea port, good historical place, kids was emphasize, see old style boat, many sculptors"
275,Loved it,"Presently closed for renovations, but impressive to see from the outside, even at a distance or from the sea."
276,Excellent museum and ruins,"Bodrum CastleThe Knights of Rhodes started this impressive castle after their capture of Bodrum in 1402 AD. The castle, which is situated on a rocky island in the east of the main harbor, occupies the area nearly 180 by 185 meters. The approach to the castle is done through seven major gates. A short ramp in the north of the castle leads the visitors to the first gate where there is  a warning   about against spying.  Nearly 250 coats of arms, which stand witness for the Christian occupation of the castle is one of the greatest collections of the coats of arms related to Knights of John. Although the first walls were built by German architect Henrich Schelegelholt between 1415-1437, the castle was renovated so many times to hold up with the new ballistic weapons. During these renovations, the Knights of Rhodes used carvings, architectural pieces, and pillars of the Mausoleum, which had been apparently destroyed by an earthquake. Italian Tower was constructed by architect Ancelo Muscettola in 1436. The fosse has begun in 1476. John Candall built the British Tower in 1480. Pierre d'Abusson did the most recent adjustments in the castle between 1476-1403. The Castle houses one of the finest museums of Underwater  Archeology. Don't miss it..."
277,This is all part of the museum for under water artefacts  ,"This crusade-era castle was once the most secure fortress along the pilgrims' route to the holy land.  The building features amazing stone towers built by knights from each of the major Christian nations whose citizens engaged in crusade era pilgrimages; England, Spain, France and Italy. The structure is remarkable but also houses an impressive array of coins, coats of armor, jewelry, etc.  the castle is worth a 2 hour visit unless you are also interested in nautical archeology, in which case the entire site could easily take you all day. This is a must-visit site in Bodrum."
278,Impressive and awesome,"Ok if u like that kind of thing, lots of steep steps so not ideal for little ones and with a buggy. We went with another family and their little boy found steps too much."
279,A true gem,"The history of this castle goes back to hunred years ago. It is known as Castle of S. Peter . Because knights of Sein John have built. But unfortunately the stones of Tomb of Mauseleum , which was one of the seven wonders of the world, have ben used. There are many towers in the castle in which ancient objects are exhibited. If you are lucky you can meet with the lovely  peacocks of the castle."
280,Magnificent Ancient Structure,This was definitely worth a visit - but beware if you have mobility issues as there are a number of steps and some of them steep and slippery
281,Inspiring altogether.,"Yes its under renovation , yes not everything is open but is your glass half empty or half full?I for one loved walking on the grounds of ancient history. The views are stunning , the culture was intoxicating if you open your mind and picture the past.If you love photos and want to catch some great photos of the wife and kids , loved ones this is the place.What is pleasing to see is historical places being restored and I appreciate the cost overruns have been huge and it may not be to the satisfaction of purists but at least our children get to share in the amazement of history - cool place for a country bumpkin from New Zealand."
282,Beautiful,"The castle is just in the beginning of the city after you exit the harbor. At 12-1 o'clock there is a break so organize your visit before or after that. The tickets were 30 TL or 7,5 ‚Ç¨ each. Just before you enter there is kiosk, i don't recall finding water elsewhere so if you don't have one you can buy from there. It takes at least an hour for the whole castle and there are many things to see. The view is very beautiful from there. Has some stairs so be careful with the shoes cause it may be slippery. Also definitely have a hat with you especially in summer, it's extremely hot. It's a must visit for Bodrum."
283,A place worth visiting,The city is beauty specialy at night time. Food there was nice but I can not come to the castle because they are have renovation on that time. The market near the castle was nice.
284,Really cool,"Most of the exibition was unavailable ta the time of the visist, but what was available has been displayed beatifully, with wooden walkways. The groudns are maintained properly and explanations in English are provided in some places.  A must to see in Bodrum."
285,Beautiful fortress castle,"That castle is not St.Peter's castle but the completed  by the Knights of St.John upon works conducted by the Grand Master Philibert de Naillac (1396-1421) on the base fortification dating from the Doric's times (1100 BC); the castle defence walls were constructed at the arrival of the knights by using most of parts, columns and Titan stones from the Halicarnassus mausoleum; that castle and archeological items is quite amazing, most to collected items came from a few shipwrecks around Bodrum and from the excavation works made by the american archeologist, Iris Love, in the early 70's; on the tip box ""when did you travel?"" I cannot insert <repeatedly since the last 40 years‚Ä¶>"
286,Stronghold built by Knights Hospitallers,"We spent a morning at Bodrum Castle in early June 2017.60 Turkish Lira entry fee for two adults was well spent. The castle is a beautiful building with spectacular scenery surrounding it, inside is the museum of underwater archeology which detailed the maritime history of the mediterranean and exhibits included ship wrecks found locally and the items found inside, including glass and amphorae. The castle buildings are in good condition and a good few were open to view the insides, so it was possible to see how people would have lived inside the castle walls. It was interesting to learn more about the castle and some information was given over the animals found inside the castle and the myths and legends surrounding them.Perfect for archeology and history fans, particularly those with any knowledge of the crusades and the order of St John who held the castle. We loved it!"
287,"Not a must, but something to do.",I've visited a lot of castles. St. Peter's is one the most extensive ones I've been to.  There's a lot to see and the entry price of 30 Turkish Lira is well worth it.
288,Excellent fortress and museum with stunning views,not recommended in sunny days because it's open. but it's worth it. At summer weekends they play some live concerts there
289,A must in Bodrum,Love this castel nice view üòç üëå and üåûü•Çvery friendly staff üòÄ good job u need visit I hope i come soon again
290,"Perfect for an afternoon visit. Good mix of history,  archaeology and castle architecture. Kids will enjoy it too. ","We made the mistake of visiting on a (very) windy day, It was well worth it though and I will be back there next year, talk to the staff as they will be very helpful."
291,castle,"Iwas surprised , to be honest . I didn't know that it was so well preserved . If you arrive in Bodrum ... YOU MUST VISIT"
292,Must do in Bodrum.,Went to the castle at end of July. Costs 30 Turkish Lira to enter plus an additional 15 if you want audio guides. Try and go during morning as the sun is intense after 11am and you will mostly be waking outdoors. Beware certain sections close between 12-1pm like the Glass Hall. Overall a good experience and highly recommend going.
293,Excellent fortification with views of the city,"When you enter a castle anywhere you are walking into history,but entering St Peter's you are entering a lair of history preserved. Unlike most castles this one is almost complete you enter the 12th century the cost TL 30 and worth the fee.The location is easy to find it is at the harbor walking distance and from the moment you enter you are taken on a Crusade into Greek,Roman,Bizantine,to Crusaders to Ottoman....you find churches beside mosques and the main room is beautiful.The views of the harbor from the battlements is a sight to behold all around Bodrum City to Gumbet and across to Kos....It cost ‚Ç¨20 from Kos port but remember you do need a passport and the heat in Bodrum  you need to take into consideration 46c on my visit be warned.Well worth the trouble"
294,Ancient history!,As a summary:Excellent piece of architecture.....you can smell history.....Idea of having ancient wreckage and treasure distributed in the tower is brilliant Avoid going mid day in hot weather and bring plenty of water....After you finish you can have a souvenir picture outside with old ottoman clothesüòäEnjoy....
295,THROUGH THE AGES,"They tell you when you arrive that loads of it is shut... and that's the case, personally I was rather disappointed and did not feel it was worth the money. Seeing the underwater archaeology museum was my main reason to visit bodrum on this holiday. On arrival you need a card or lira to pay, they don't take euro so i had to go and change my currency when everyone else takes euro, I thought this was ridiculous for a main tourist destination. You can see the walls, the mosque, the courtyard which has a very old tree and some interesting sculptures and two rooms which have shipwreck artefacts. Everything else is shut. No information is provided about the castle so if you do go in, try downloading Wikipedia so you have a context, this does make a difference as until I read this and retraced my steps I hadnt noticed all of the carvings up high on the walls and I then started spotting bits of the mausoleum that were used to rebuild it."
296,Great views,"Once upon a time, centuries ago, this was a crusader's castle.   But the Turks don't seem to mind, and apart from building a minaret on top of the chapel they have been to a lot of trouble to maintain it.  They are working on it today, unloading bags of cement and putting up scaffolding.  We spent two or three hours clambering around the battlements.  I suspect that it is rather like my grandfather's axe - dad replaced the handle and I replaced the blade - as it seems in too good condition to be entirely original.  The minaret I mentioned is the only obviously new feature - a French naval bombardment in 1915 knocked it down and they built a new concrete one in 1997.  I hope they give the muezzin a ladder as the door is 5m above the courtyardBodrum castle is now officially the Turkish national institute of underwater archaeology.  And the Turks have been very good at recovering ships and artifacts from the bottom of the sea.  Unfortunately most of the exhibitions had closed for lunch when we were there, but I was delighted and astonished to find a display of tiny fragile glass perfume bottles.  Stuff like that wouldn't survive eight minutes in our house, yet this stuff is eight hundred years old or more  The chapel I mentioned is now full of a reconstruction of a boat filled with amphorae from around the Eastern Mediterranean.  The courtyard has a selection - big, small, fat, thin.  Oil, wine, cheese, wheat - the amphora was the shipping container of the ancient world.  Every city made them in their own style.  At the top of the tower are some open air Turkish toilets, though they are no longer available for public use.  At the bottom of the tower is the dungeon.  Nice touch."
297,lovely views over the see,"Must visit, cost 30 Turkish Lira. Closed lunch time between 12 o'clock till 1 o'clock, very impressed, lots of different rooms, dungeon, jewelry history information and great views. Probably takes 2 to 3 hours to see it all. Worth every Lira."
298,yu have to visit...,"Fortress of Halikarnassos is a stronghold built by the Hospitallers, or Knights of the Order of St.John of Jerusalem (Knights of Malta). The fortress is situated by the safe natural harbour on the coast of Asia Minor as near as possible to the island of Kos, with a strategic position by the strait separating the island from the continent. This fortress together with fortress of Kos, situated on the other side of the channel and also built and belonged to the Knights, were co-working in order to control the traffic through the strait. By the time of construction, the fortress was placed on the small island with natural defensive moat, but later on it was incorporated with the mainland. The castle houses now an Archaeological museum, the entrance to both is from harbour promenade of Bodrum, right beneath the castle rock. There is a museum shop on the grounds, as well as shaded cafe with outdoor serving, surrounded by old columns, statues and picturesque remains.The castle territory is not very large but rather hilly with steps up and down. There are two well-signed touristic routs, one shorter and another long, through the area. Lots of birds are dwelling freely in the castle, most rare are families of peacocks, we spotted some 5-6 adult birds and lots of chicks. Beautiful surroundings, lots of antique statues, flowering trees and bushes, very spectacular views of both bays of Halicarnassos - do not miss this attraction! Entrance fee is 30 Turkish Lira per adult, open all weekdays. Allow some 1,5-2 hours for complete sightseeing."
299,An absolute must on your trip,"It's open every day only until  6:30 pm, so be sure to arrive early, as it takes about 2-2.5 hours to visit it. Plenty of history to learn about, so be sure to take the 15 TL audio guide. Free admission for children. Plenty of things to see, but a bit too much of submarine archaeology details everywhere. Breathtaking panorama view on Bodrum. It's definitely the must see here."
