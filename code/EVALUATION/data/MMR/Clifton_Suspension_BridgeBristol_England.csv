16,Lovely view,Bristol in Autumn is magnificent and if your a bridge buffer just like a compelling view then catch Clifton Bridge. I suggest walking up to the observatory got a view of the bridge itself before wandering down and crossing it by foot. With the autumn colours- the Avon looked a gelid mirror among a jewelled gorge. Amazing.
17,Iconic bridge with splendid views,"Well worth seeing if in the area, amazing piece of engineering and what a view. We actually traveled across it on a motorbike for the price of one pound, you can also walk across it if you want to. We also traveled back riding underneath it which gives you a chance to see it from a different perspective unfortunately there is no where to stop to look at it and the amazing scenery in its entirety."
18,Worth the walk.,Great views of a brilliant city. Been here 30 and hope to see another 30. Visitors centre on the leigh woods side definitely worth a visit very interesting
19,Lovely view!,"Beautiful views over Bristol city. 100% recommend going at night as the lights look amazing. Free for pedestrians, only £1 for motor vehicles. Unfortunate there is all the extra railing, this has had to be added due to it being a suicide spot :("

25,Worth Seeing,Such a lovely place to visit! View is amazing and located near some lovely cafés down the road. Simply stunning! We went to the observatory and into the “giants cave” which gives you another great view - this bit great for families and young children!
26,Viewing platforms fenced off,If you're in the Clifton area the bridge is worth a stroll to for the views upo and down the gorge.  It's an impressive piece of engineering.
27,Really Suspension ,"Loved walking across the bridge, great views across the city and out over the gorge. The visitor centre is well worth a visit, free entry just give a donation, friendly welcome, informative displays. Maybe a little coffee shop? But all in all a great place to visit."

29,Holiday ,We visited on a glorious day so stunning views after a walk up the fairly steep roads to get to the bridge. Don't forget the visitors centre.
30,Impressive,The views from the bridge are worth the walk across it. The construction/engineering is a interesting to see especially as the same principal is still in use today.
31,Exhilerating,Bridge is a Great piece of Architecture. It looks mesmerizing during night when lights are on. One can walk on the sides of it.One can climb up on the next to it and have better view from the top.
32,Bristol weekend visit ,"an unexpected gem in the city with great views - costs to drive over though!nice bridge, rich history and stunning scenery"
33,Boss views,we drove ober this amazing bridge. You can walk it if you can park your car nearby. Very high up! Only cost a pound for the toil
34,Such an impressive structures,Fantastic view and piece of history.  Had been to SS Great Britian and was nice to know this was part of Brunels work.
35,Marvellous structure,Busy place well worth a look. The sheer drops and movement of the bridge all add to the day.. Recommend the white lion nearby for food.. excellent bbq shredded beef on chips yum !
36,Incredible ,It is a beautiful bridge near Bristol. It has nice view of the town on one side and mountains on the other side. It requires a toll of a very nominal amount of 1 GBP if you travel through them.
37,Awesome views from above ,What a classic cracker. Very impressive and also great views from the bridge. The walk up can be demanding though
38,Great views even on a cloudy day,Really refreshing. Great view and perfect for photos. Watching a sunset here I’m sure would be amazing.

42,Brilliant example of pioneering design and engineering,We Enjoy the visit. Best view. I recommend to everyone have kids go there. You can have a  good all day.
43,Epic!,It is worth walking up to the Observatory to view the Bridge and it’s surroundings. Only a few expensive sandwiches and drinks were available there at the time we visited. The bridge itself is well worth walking over and there is a small free visitor information centre that outlines its history. We got the bus up to Clifton village and they are very frequent and the driver was helpful too.
44,A Bristol Icon,"We always take visitors for a walk across the Clifton suspension bridge. Amazing view, well worth the walk across."
45,Scary..,"Well worth the busy to Bristol, walked easily from Bristol city centre, went to the visitor Center too"

48,Amazing engineering!,"Walked from the CAMC site at Baltic Wharf. Pleasant path along the river, steep path to the top of the ravine BUT difficult to find from the NT Leigh Woods! Need to turn left, follow the road to the end & there you are. Very nice coffee truck just before the bridge, much needed."
49,Great views,One of the places we came to visit Bristol for. Beautiful as you can see anywhere its advertised online.
50,Great,Worth stopping and looking around. Amazing piece of engineering. Ironic part of Bristol and perfect for a few photos.
51,Amazing,"Stunning masterpiece of victorian engineering,views for miles over bristol.You can walk freely over it but cars pay."
52,Maybe Leave it a Few Months,"I visited on a rainy day so it was a shame but the view was still incredible, we drove across it which cost £1, but we also walked across. Recommend a visit if you pass through."
53,Walk along the banks of the river,Astonishing this bridge was built so long ago. You can walk across on one side of the road and walk back on the other side to get best advantages of the views. You will get no real idea of its magnificence if you drive over (at cost)
54,Big bridge,Amazing VIEW from a amazing piece of creation 😄Go see it and take a walk from one side to another .... it’s easy to get there even if you’ve got problems with your legs🥰
55,Beuatiful,"This bridge looks absolutely beautiful but terrifying when you view it from below. However, once you are up there it is surprisingly sturdy and does not seem to take long to cross at all thoroughly ended this."
56,Grand Victorian architecture and engineering,"Great views, it’s a decent walk up from the centre of Bristol. Would recommend the scenic route, get the ferry at brunnel quay and follow the river on the other side of the city. The observatory on the east side of the bridge will provide a well deserved beer"
57,Breathtaking View,Fantastic - well worth a visit. Spectacular views and a lovely coffee shop and ice cream stand.  Also worth the 5 mn walk to the observatory.
58,Great view,A beautiful place to visit with a little shop and museum near the bridge. Also an Observatory a short walk up a hill where there is access to the Hermits cave.
59,Challenging parking nearby,Impressive historic structure. The Clifton bridge is in a beautiful location. A number of great pubs nearby and the best Champagne bar I've ever experienced.
60,Well worth a visit,It is a very nice place for a walk in an open air. A lot to see and admire. The view from the brigde is breathtaking!
61,Impressive,The views on and around the bridge are superb! £1 to cross over one way in the car. Well worth a visit!
62,Evening walk,"Lovely piece of engineering.Beautiful scenery and good views.We walked down one side, crossed over and came back the other.We'll worth the visit."
63,Fabulous ,Always a splendid bridge to walk across with amazing views along the Avon Gorge and across Bristol.  Walked across this bridge today and stopped at a lovely cafe on the Leigh Woods side for a cappuccino before making my way back across and admiring the views towards the downs and over Clifton as a whole.  The only downside at the moment may be restricted opportunities to take photographs due to social distancing measures.  I think the best place to take photos of this bridge would be from the Observatory overlooking the bridge on the Clifton side.
64,2 beautiful granddaughters.. ,One of the engineering wonders of a great man who had vision of great engineering wonders. Great views from the bridge and still able to drive across it. At £1 for the toll is great value.
65,Very Rude Attendant,Walked underneath the bridge and then stopped for a drink to enjoy the view at the George hotel which has a fabulous terrace to see the bridge from - we couldn’t walk along the bridge due to it being closed from protestors (bank holiday weekend) but enjoyed the park around it - worth a wander
66,Lobely view,"Great city icon (though it is not in the city itself), Nice to walk across or drive and admire the view across the city or the gorge.  The fee to use it is worth it."
67,Beautiful views ,"Not quite the Golden Gate but still impressive, well worth a walk out and a walk across, some great views and appreciation of the construction, if you walk on the waterfront there is a long steep walk to get up to the bridge, you can walk through Clifton where there are some nice unique shops, bars and restaurants."

69,Spectacular views,Iconic Bristol attraction. Nice view from the observatory Interesting visitor centre on the Leigh Woods side of the bridge.
70,Old Bridge still standing ,Well worth a visit to this historic and beautiful bridge. The walk across is stunning and then head into Clifton for a wonder around the lovely shops and bars
71,Beautiful view and magnificent,Well worth a visit & photo opportunity from the observatory hill top. Some of the Benches are poorly positioned!
72,Cycling,"Amazing views on a clear day, definitely worth visiting if you're in Clifton already doing other stuff."
73,Long walk uphill but worth it!,"What a great view, gutted we wasn’t there when the hot air balloons went past but we will be back to see this spectacular views. Was definitely worth walking up the hill to see these incredible views."
74,Walking my dog ,"It is a great architectural masterpiece. I recommend going up the hill for photos, as the bridge presents itself much better from above than from the ground. It is definitely the most recognisable place in Bristol."
75,Well done for stopping runners across the bridge! ,It’s such a lovely city. You can take a tour around the city and find many kind of restaurants on the waterfronts.
76,Perfect photo spot ,Beautiful architecture...offering a great view of Clifton.Definitely worth the stroll over and return...

81,As the locals say - gert lush!,"Gorgeous view from here! Lovely place for a stroll, no matter the weather. Cute little coffee shop at the observatory too."
82,A bridge with a nice view,Lovely walk a bout in Bristol- to me the surrounding area with cobbled streets and church ( beautiful Christ Church) with a ‘tea’ to boot! The bridge another gem along the way - shirt walk really - sunny day
83,Picturesque,"A true icon of engineering, we’ll worth a visit. Very close to Clifton village which is very nice. Half hour walk from Bristol centre"
84,Clifton Suspension Bridge,Went for a drive along the bridge and the view was astounding. This is well worth the drive past when visiting Bristol.
85,Such a fantastic piece of engineering!,"Only able to walk across one side of the bridge as the others closed for maintenance, great views up the gorge."

89,See the splendor of the bridge!,You can't go to Bristol without seeing the bridge. A beautiful structure and well worth a visit.  Stunning views.
90,A wonderful engineered bridge,in Bristol regularly for business and always feel at home when I see the suspension bridge.  When the sun is behind the bridge it sparkes and looks like you are in an exotic location.
91,A great attraction ,A great viewpoint to experience the city. High above the ground - yet comfortable to visit and experience.
92,Great,"A beautifully constructed bridge, with lovely views of the Avon gorge.  Don’t forget to visit the Bridge Museum situated on the west side of the bridge."
93,Lovely bridge ,"Located up the rock, so if on foot you need to do a good fitness excercize. If on car, there are parking lots, but very busy, could luckily find one. View deserves that! Check The Lookout Lentern for it, or Observatory on top. walk along the bridge, one line system for pedestrians. For cars toll is 1 pound. Google maps can say the bridge is closed, not at all."
94,Regularly crossing the Bristol Suspension Bridge is a complete joy,"How they built this bridge all those years ago is unbelievable. Very impressive, lots of viewing ares"
95,Mesmerising site,"This is worth a visit, spectacular industrial revolution structure amazing feat of engineering.But only allow an hour as it's a bridge!"
96,Amazing Place ,Nice walk over the bridge with scenic views overlooking the valley. There's a small car park that charges a small fee or you there is local onstreet parking if you're lucky.Theres local wooded areas of Leigh Woods to explore nearby with free parking that you can walk to or view the bridge from for a nice day out
97,Very good site to see,"Absolutely outstanding masterpiece of engineering and must be seen by all. Easy parking, beautiful views and a wealth of history to learn about. We visited the visitors centre and were welcomed by two volunteers. I feel terrible for forgetting the lady’s name as she was lovely and friendly, she gave us more ideas on where to go. Antony was fantastic too, a very interesting man with so much knowledge about the bridge and the history. He kindly gave us a free short tour full with great information and facts. We would definitely recommend visiting even if you’re just passing."
98,IT'S FREE,Well worth a visit to a bridge years in the building that Brunel never saw actually finished. Masses of information at the visitor centre and tours provided if required. Well worth walking over the bridge for the views. This like the visitor centre is free.
99,Suspension bridge,Great view from on the bridge as well as off. It is £1 to drive over the bridge (and they only take card) but you can walk over it for free and there is a great park with a viewpoint of the bridge on the southern side. There's a few bars and restaurants along the water edge which would also offer a good view over dinner. So happy to have seen it - great piece of history.
100,Great views and amazing engineering,"Drove over the bridge cost a £1. very interesting view however no opportunity to stop. Had to travel to a remote location to get parked and walk back in the rain :-( (in our case). The weather then made getting to the tourist hut undesirable and we opted not to, instead climbed the short distance to the observatory above it.  The view from here of the bridge and soundings were excellent and free. The weather prevailed however and we moved on without sampling the offerings of the observatory caff."
101,Walk the line ,"An engineering marvel, we walked across, a nice viewing point from a nice bridge, not a lot more to say!"
102,Beautiful views,"A great post covid attraction, very quiet when we walked over it.  Parked close by and had no other people walking over at the same time.  Walked up the hill on the Clifton side and had some stunning views.  Lucky also we had very little wind.Shame the visitors centre was closed as this really is a masterpiece"
103,Spectacular,The bridge is pf course magnificent. Make sure to go to the visitor centre on the far side. Its very detailed but super informative of the construction and intricacies of this amazing feat of engineering.
104,5*,"Amazing engineering, one way system implemented for Covid with no stopping/overtaking but was an enjoyable wander across on one side and back on the other, superb views over the gorge!"
105,"Beautiful bridge, seen for miles and from which you can see for miles",I love bridges. The short walk of about 25 minutes or so along the banks of the river that lead you to the curve that reveals the bridge slowly was lovely. The bridge was spectacular. Enjoy.
106,Beautiful bridge with nice views on both sides,Excellent architecture and great history. Has the most amazing views of the Avon Gorge from the bridge.
107,A daily tour of Bristol ,Go when the sun is setting. Totally amazing. The views are amazing. Stop and ensure you take it all in.
108,Very nice!,"An icon of a better time. Cost £1 by card, was still sturdy not much rust, great views. What more can I say about a bridge?"
109,What an amazing structure,Have my 2 beautiful Granddaughter for 3 weeks thru the summer..Got bus from Pill to the bridge..walked across..its walk one way to left back on right (covid 19) so quite an easy walk...then walked into town stopping at the Wetherspoons for a drink girls were hungry so they had a pizza..shopping then to to eat at another Wetherspoons ..nice day out ....
110,Iconic bridge,Absolutely stunning piece of engineering created in ancient times. The way location of the bridge truly define the need of a bridge. Very ecstatic view from the cliff and a walk  over is truly trilling experience taking us
111,Worth driving/walking over! ,"amazing area, looking over the river and bristol - make sure you go for a walk through the downs if you are in the area!"
112,Lovely Walk on a Windy Day,The Bridge and surrounding area is well worth a visit. The information place was closed due to Covid but that didn’t spoil our enjoyment of this wonderful piece of engineering and the spectacular views afforded to the visitor. We walked there fromthe City centre in about 30 minutes
113,More great views,you have an amazing veiw of bristol and if you ave picked a nice day you will see hot air balloons. i really reccomend it and it is for all of the family. it may not be so good if you are afraid of heights
114,Worth a £1,"Nice to walk to the bridge, go to the visitors centre then visit the observatory. It’s got to be done if you visit Bristol... it’s iconic after all!"
115,Wonderful architecture,"What a view. Definitely worth a visit if nearby. We walked over and then up the windy path to the tower on the top of gorge, only takes a few minutes but gives you a beautiful view of the bridge and surrounding area. Lovely bit of history."
116,Wonderful views and good visitor centre,Have been several times before but this time walked fro Bristol zoo direction so get different view.
117,A must see in Bristol,This is one of the landmarks of Bristol and it's a very nice from the city center (about 25 minutes) along the river! Walk up past the observatory and get a great view of the whole bridge without using a wide angle lens!
118,Rob P,"Was nice to see this spectacular and famous suspension bridge! if you drive through it, the cost is one pound"
119,Cliffton Suspension Bridge,"No visit to Bristol is complete without going to the Clifton Suspension Bridge. Brilliant and the views are superb! Also, make sure you go to the Observatory on the hill above the Bridge. It has a camera obscura and a “giants cave” ."
120,Awe Inspiring especially when viewed from below.,"The views of the valley are incredible. Worth the £1! But wish we'd walked across, not driven.The views are insane"
121,beautiful view,"We parked in Clifton, walked to the observatory to view the gorge and bridge then walked across the bridge to the visitors centre. The views are great and its a truly impressive piece of engineering."
122,Beautiful bridge,"Best bridge in the world, and I've seen a few now! The views are awesome and its Brunels best work IMO."
123,Still as spectacular after 40 years!,"Absolutely beautiful bridge, the engineering behind it is crazy as well. We really enjoyed it. Amazing view"
124,A Long Wished for Visit to this Bridge,Saw this bridge on a rainy day and it was still great. The information center has really good information and the staff are really nice
125,Stayed locally with great view of bridge day and night.,Great views from this bridge though over very muddy waters. Good bit of Bristol history and a top ten spot to go to. Looks great at night when lit up and nice to walk across. There's a visitor's centre there open during the daytime. A fantastic walking / cycling trail that runs under it for the more adventerous and you can take great photos of the bridge from the ground up.
126,Stunning ,Yes well worth a look at. Walked over and went to a viewing platform away from the bridge but actually higher than. Have a look if you have a mo.
127,Beautiful ,Iconic Bristol Bridge. A must see if you are just in Bristol for the day. Walk up to the right from the East side and there is a viewing area above the bridge.
128,Bike tour around Bristol with a sat nav ,An amazing feat of engineering crossing high above the stunning Avon Gorge which in itself is interesting as there is a wealth of rare fauna
129,a grand day out,"After visiting SS Great Britain, this was the absolute must see. Great engineering and fantastic view!"
130,Long walk on new year's day ,Drove over today by accident. Great bit of British history. Great views over the river and city. Worth the £1 toll to drive over!
131,Beautiful City Icon,"Walked from the town centre which is uphill, perhaps 2.5 miles. Walked across the bridge (one way system in place due to Covid). Unfortunately visitor centre and toilets not yet reopened but was a nice place to visit."
132,Interesting,I had to cross the bridge as I was going into Clifton village it’s an experience I can tick off the list but I am not going to write home about it
133,The most beautiful view!,20/1/20 fantastic run across the bridge and out to Ashton Court and then stopped on bridge on way back to watch beautiful sunrise. So impressive.
134,Well worth the walk from the city...,"Clifton is a very fashionable area of Bristol with loads of Georgian style properties. The bridge is stunning , especially at dusk We thought the best view ( apart from walking across it ) was from the observatory , a few minutes walk away."
135,Great spot to watch sunrise on a early run!,Driving through Bristol is not on my most pleasant experience however once you get to Clifton and park near to the Observatory you are in for a thrill. There is also an excellent cafe at the top as well.
136,Clifton suspension bridge,"Went to lookout over suspension bridge.  So didn’t actually walk along it.  It’s pretty up there , place for picnic and an interesting cave with an extra look out.  Get taxi from centre of town as it’s a long assed walkExplore the little village beside it with quirky shops"
137,Great experience if you can avoid the staff,We planned our running route to go over this on a weekend away. Well worth the detour!  Great views and amazing to see up close.
138,Great views,Went for a walk on clifton downs and decided to look for the viewing point for the bridge. Was not disappointed. There are not many awe inspiring fusions of british design and british natural beauty that can challenge the sight from the view point. The view of avon gorge is also pretty impressive. I would also thoroughly advise going at sunset as the lights and the views together are really worth it. Obviously its a bit cold this time of year so bring a coat. :)
139,Masterpiece,"Walked over the bridge from the Clifton side and explored the excellent small visitor centre. On the way back over the bridge, we watched climbers scaling the gorge. What a sight! The bridge is an icon and it was amazing to see it up close."
140,A wonderful piece of engineering with great views.,Fun to learn the history of an amazing engineer. Visit the little museum just after the bridge to learn about its design and construction .
141,Wonderful piece of engineering,"The bridge looks amazing, do not miss walking over the bridge. There is a visitor center for more information. The history of the bridge, and in particular the life of Mr Brunel, is very interesting."
142,It’s an icon,Calling off Sunday afternoon on our way back from Devon the weather was set fair we thought Clifton suspension bridge.Now parking east side of the bridge is near impossible so we crossed the bridge in the car £1 toll fair enough then looked for a place in Clifton to park again easier said than done eventually after much huff and guff we found a spot around 10 minutes walk to the bridge... well for once it’s free parking sundays. It’s well worth it fantastic structure and the views are spectacular to say the least sun proviso (always looks better with the sun out) ! I suppose if I’m going to grip the council has put up large metal fencing both sides of the walkway that slightly restricted photography I suspect it’s in place to stop anyone thinking of jumping off the structure.Busy here plenty of onlookers recommended if your around the Bristol area
143,Beautiful by Brunel,"Lovely bridge.  Unfortunately though, unable to use the viewing points, they have temporary fencing all over them.  Not sure if it's to stop people jumping off the bridge or some sort of Covid excuse to prevent people loitering.   I may revisit when the fencing comes down."
144,An Icon,Agree with all the 5star reviews of this amazing feat of engineering. Well worth a visit especially on a clear day.
145,Cold night but beautiful,Well worth a visit. Wander across the bridge to the visitor centre. Welcoming and very interesting for adults and children alike.
146,Very interesting visitor centre for all ages,A must see if visiting Bristol. Lovely bit of architecture and nice views. You only have to pay £1 to get through the toll charge.
147,Never disappoints,"While on  a short visit to the area we went to the bridge at the height of Storm Francis!  So no chance of walking over as we had originally planned!  And the visitor centre had not yet reopened after the Covid lockdown.That said, it was a great experience to drive over and back - and only £1 each way.  Even in the torrential rain the view from the bridge is quite something."
148,Great view,The bridge is a great piece of architecture with lovely views of the valley leading into the heart of Bristol. A good spot for photos.
149,georgous view from the cafe in the park above the bridge,"Worth a visit if you are close, the bridge is a tourist attraction, a short walk from Clifton. It’s interesting - but not unmissable!Free if you are walking across... a pound of driving. Has a small visitors centre."
150,Sunday walk,"What more can I say? probably one of the most iconic sights in the South West, always been meaning to walk over this phenomenal piece of architectural history. Finally did this today, no show, no razzmatazz, just a tremendous piece of engineering."
151,day out in bristol,"Great bit of history with excellent views, Amazing to think it was built over 150 years ago. Only £1 to cross value for money."
152,Nice view from the viewing platform,"One of those things that has to be done if you are in the area. Great views from both sides, and you can drive across for one pound. There are also a couple of side streets on the Somerset side where you can park for free. This makes it easy to walk across and back without paying ridiculous prices as at the other side of the bridge. Caution, as you are on a bridge that's rather high make sure you wrap up warm. The wind can go straight through you if unprepared"
153,Beautiful landscape,Incredible piece of engineering; the bridge clings to the steep sided valley and hums with traffic. Its a toll bridge but not expensive!Well worth a visit if you are about even if its brief just to say you have seen it.
154,History of Clifton Bridge,"Don't drive across and walk instead if you can. The view from both sides of the bridge is amazing as you walk across. Also make a visit to the shops in Clifton. It's very pleasant. We had a breakfast at Foliage Cafe, 17 Regent Street, Clifton. The food was delicious and a very cosy cafe with a lot of indoor plants."
155,Must see this engineering wonder,Worth a visit if your in Bristol. Drive through the lovely Clifton village with lovely shops and cafes.Continue towards the bridge to find a parking space that has pay as you display machines on the side of the road. If you walk towards the observation centre you will have a lovely view of the bridge that you can then walk down to and cross on both sides. If you prefer you can drive across but there is a £1 toll charge.
156,Must see of Bristol,"There are wonderful views from the bridge and it's worth taking a walk across it. Also, do visit the Visitor Centre - it's very interesting and will help you understand just why this bridge is so important and so fascinating."
157,Wanted to Visit for 50 Years Since Driving Under it as a Kid,"It's free to walk over or one pound to cross over by car but you need to walk, to appreciate the fantastic views of Bristol and the Avon Gorge plus of course the marvellous building of the suspension bridge itself. There is a small visitor center with lots of information, make sure to bring a camera as the views are amazing, day or night."
158,Great walk!,"Beautiful bridge over an impressive gorge. If you go, do visit the Visitor Centre which is free and very informative about the bridge's history. The lawns on the Clifton-side feature benches perfect for a good read, or perhaps just a sit-down."
159,Clifton suspension bridge,Don't just drive over the bridge park up and walk over it each way that way you get a real feeling of the huge scale of the bridge and the clever engineering that went into the design and build. If its a nice day there is a very pleasant walk on the city centre side of the bridge that you can do that takes you above the bridge where you get a super view of the bridge and the valley.If you are going over the bridge in a car do be aware that there is a £1 toll to pay which can be paid cash or contactless card.
160,Mever tire of visiting this engineering masterpiece,The heart of Bristol. I have lived in bristol all my life and still get excited crossing it. It looks amazing when it is lit up and night!
161,Spectacular view,"We were staying at the Hotel Du Vin so with a great view to the bridge. The next day we drove over it, so cute and the views down the gorge beautiful."
162,on the wish list for a long time,On a beautiful sunny day in September we visited and walked across the bridge and looked around the visitor centre.  The views are amazing and the volunteers know their stuff.  Parking is free in Clifton on the weekend so if you're interested in a good days out definitely don't miss this.
163,Just walking by...,I visited at night on foot and it is spectacular! I have driven over it a few times while I have lived here but nothing compares to actually walking across and experiencing the sheer majesty of the structure
164,Amazing,"We took a run from City Centre to the bridge (<2miles) at sunrise. It was so beautiful! We went up into the park to view the bridge and gorge. We then came to run over the bridge, there is a pedestrian path. Don’t miss this view!"
165,Amazing! But What Else Would You Expect for Brunel's Bridge!,"The Clifton suspension bridge is an amazing attraction to visit day or night, but I highly recommend crossing the bridge at night."
166,AN AMAZING PIECE OF ENGINEERING AND HISTORY,"A lovely location. It is possible to walk up to the bridge via Clifton village, cross over the bridge and down the other side coming back into Bristol itself along the river and past the SS Great Britain. It is a long walk but well worth it"
167,Suspend Belief,You must go and see a bridge!?! My thoughts when reading ‘What to do and see in Bristol.” But it is a must. Stunning views and a masterpiece.
168,Lovely views!,Amazing piece of architecture with an incredible majestic existence well done Isambard  Kingdom  Brunel
169,Clifton Suspension Bridge,Bristol has many great features the ss great Britain Cabot tower the cathedral but there is one that is such an iconic part of the Bristol psyche that puts it in a league of its own the Clifton suspension bridge for the best view go to conservatory or go and have tea and sandwiches on the conservatory cafe overlooking the bridge and the open top bus goes there get off at Clifton village and it's a five minute walk
170,Proper older fashioned engineering ,"On a damp and windy day our guide a real charactor told us all about the history of the Bridge , how it was built and how today it operates. Well worth na visit and to learn that it is as the name says just suspended between the towers was fascinating. The Visitor centre again told the story and was a very interersting visit. Thank you"
171,Epic engineering,"We had a lovely time, sit on one side of the bridge and enjoy the beautiful view or walk up the hill.  The view from the hill is breathtaking."
172,Worth a stop...,"Great place to visit and have a stroll across Bristols iconic suspension bridge built by I K Brunel. Lovely little visitors centre. A few minutes away is an array of beautiful shops, bars and cafes in Clifton village. A day out for family and friends alike."
173,Beautiful ,Having been living in London all my life I never quite experienced a site of natural beauty as good as the Clifton suspension bridge. It has a historical link to the early engineers of Britain and the view whilst walking along the platform was to die for. It was extremely steep yet very exciting. I would defianantly recommend to anyone visiting Bristol.
174,Gorgeous views. ,"To put this engineering masterpiece in its proper setting, first you have to view it from below. Drive along Hotwell Road and find a spot to stop and look up! You'll see the mighty bridge springing over the precipitous sides of the Avon Gorge. When you've seen it from the bottom, jumpo in your car (or catch a cab) and go to Sion Hill, park your car and walk the short distance to the eastern bridge abutment, where you'll find that, whilst it costs 1 GBP to drive across, it's free to walk! (50 years ago, when I was student in Bristol, they used to charge a toll for pedestrians too, 1 'old' penny, if I remember right!). So walk slowly across, savouring the views and then walk slowly back. The scale of the bridge and the gorge that is crosses, is awe inspiring.  You don't have to be a bridge 'nut' to see why this is one of the engineering marvels of the world. Its history is well worth finding out about. In my humble opinion, this is one of the four greatest bridges in the world (The other three, in no particular order, are the Millau Viaduct in southern France, the Forth Rail Bridge in Scotland and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Why not check them all out and see if you agree?)"
175,Great views,We accidentally went over the bridge cost us a pound each way but so glad we did as it is very impressive and worth going to have a look
176,Beautiful during the day or at night,It wasn’t that an extraordinary sightseeing to see rather than a big bridge. You pay £1 to cross by car but there is path road to walk. There is a small mobile coffee shop on the road if you need any refreshments though there’s not toilets around. It’s better to go in the morning rather than at night as you can see the city better.
177,Very nice great view.,Access to both sides of the bridge on foot meant we had easy access to the great views and even though there were lots of people about enjoying the bridge we did not feel crowded or rushed. Stunning during the day and evening with a really close up look at this wonder piece of history
178,Visiting U K Brunel sites in Bristol,We regularly use the Suspension bridge to visit Clifton and love walking across it. It is iconic and definitely worth walking over rather than driving so you can take in the views of Avon Gorge and Cliftons buildings..
179,SepsisAloud,So we'll worth a visit just for the views. If you don't like heights it can make you feel a little dizzy when walking over but worth it just to take photos.
180,Worth a trip,Well worth a visit to this historic bridge! It’s a shame Clifton village wasn’t as appealing!Go across to see its delights.
181,Worth the visit,"Drive across (for a toll of £1), but for sheer joy, a fantastic view and to fully appreciate the engineering and design of yesteryear - you have to walk across the bridge.  Absolutely fantastic."
182,Like a cloud,"What an experience!  The visitors center is a must, very well explained and  friendly staff.  Free to enter.  We left a donation to help the non profit making Clifton Bridge Trust, continue to preserve the bridge and keep up the good work.  Private tours can also be organised.  Parking is slighty difficult.  We parked on the streets on the west side of the bridge, not the Bristol city side.  Be prepared to walk.  Well worth the time spent there and then walking around the park and Clifton, where you have some lovely local shops and cafes, added to the experience."
183,Great Visitors Centre,Wow what a wonderful bridge. Very unique. I spent the morning in Clifton browsing local amenities and then did some reading on the bridge and found out it has quite a history. definitely a place for a cool picture but be careful when it's windy!!
184,Wow!,I go over the bridge on my way back from sport and go slow to take in the beauty. It is an iconic part of Bristol with a unique history (just like the towers) and is a must see for anyone nearby.
185,Great to see Brunel's iconic bridge,"My wife and I visited recently, we parked near the zoo and walked the short distance to the bridge. We have seen this bridge from below and in photos so many times, but when you stand on it for the first time the scale is impressive. On the far side is a small information centre (on the right). This centre is free (voluntary contribution requested) and is full of information, well worth a visit if you are in the area."
186,One of the iconic landmarks of Bristol,"The visitor centre was very informative with very friendly staff and a great free tour, worth waiting until night to see the bridge illuminated"
187,Worth seeing,Exactly what it says on the tin does not disappoint. Really gives the wow factor and still the landmark of Somerset
188,Amazing sight,"This is one of Bristol's must see's. It is a beautiful piece of engineering whether you are walking or driving over it.  Free if you walking and £1 pound each way to drive. There are various places to see it from, the observatory or if you wanted to sit and enjoy it the white lion bar over sunset is one of the best places to see it. At night it is lit up too so it's worth seeing twice if you can."
189,Bernie Clifton suspension bridge. ,"What can I say about Bristol's most famous bridge? Great architecture, great views and a good place to walk your dog nearby!"
190,Quick visit to the view point,"We came away absolutely delighted.Tour guide entertaining. Information staggering, Views amazing !This was a birthday gift to my husband.He loved it, and will love sharing his new found knowledge"
191,Sunday Afternoon,Neat bridge that is maintained by voluntary contributions. Great views of the bridge from the park cafe that is situated above  the bridge
192,Fantastic ,"Fabulous architecture! Came from London specially to see the famous suspension bridge, it was a beautiful experience! Highly recommend! We have some Great photos from there 👏🏻😍"
193,Just Gorgeous-Brunei’s Bridge a Vision,"If you like huge engineering made out of many large bits of metal from an era when we built really big things really, really well then this is a must!Designed by Brunel but built after he died, it is really impressive, spamming a massive gap. The walk across (free) is very pleasant and the views are epic. How on earth they even began to construct it is mind-boggling. And the local area of Clifton is rather lovely too; posh shops galore.But be warned: (a) it is very, very long way down in the middle and (b) the walk up from Bristol takes quite a while (40+ minutes) and does involve a very steep hill."
194,Amazing VIEW,"Fantastic views when you walk across for free (£1 for cars by contactless card). One side of the bridge is used to walk in one direction, no overtaking people allowed for safety. The other side of the bridge is for walking in the other direction.  High fence protecting you from falling/leaning over, gaps allow phone/camera for great photos. Also pavements both sides  are protected from the passing traffic by solid iron barriers and cables. The paintwork, road and pavements are in excellent condition, you feel safer knowing the bridge is well maintained."
195,A stunning piece of engineering,"Last visited this bridge 40 years ago and it's just as fab as I remembered.  Be warned, it does close in high winds, so visit in good weather if you can.  Don't miss the Clifton Suspension Bridge Visitors' Centre on the far (Leigh Woods) side - really informative time line of the bridge construction.  And a swift half at the Coronation Tap nearby to finish the visit!"
196,VIEWS ,This bridge by Brunel is a Bristol must see. Take a walk across this beautiful bridge to admire this feat of engineering and enjoy great views of the city.
197,Impressive,"One of the nicest bridges in the UK. It is worthy going there if you visit Bristol, which is a lovely city."
198,"Bridge, cave & observatory","Brunei’s  bridge which spans  the gorge is an engineering masterpiece in its day. The free exhibition at the bridge is excellent and  provides the historical information of the bridge designs. The views from the bridge are stunning and visiting the bridge should not be missed, it’s well worth the effort."
199,Iconic must see,"Well, it's a bridge really. Yes, a historic one and it has good views up and down the Gorge, one direction towards Clifton Downs, the other over a rather unlovely part of Bristol. But that's about it really. There's a footpath and you can walk across and look down from the centre at the water and the astonishing amount of mud on the banks - enough to create interesting patterns and formations- and contemplate how far down that is.  Count the seconds till you see the stone you've dropped hit the water.  Not the only thing, as evidenced by the Samaritons signs installed on the ends of the bridge. Interesting to do it once, but I wouldn't say it's worth travelling for unless you are big into bridges or Isambard Kingdom Brunel. But the nearby Clifton caves, railway and camera obscure are interesting and might make it worth a trip."
200,Beautiful sight,"A visit to this location proved to be very informative, the museums charts and photographs interesting. The bridge offers great  views along the gorge and seemed higher than I thought."
201,A must see!!,Do this. It’s worth it. Lovely. Cute area of town as well. Quick trip w kids before their train outOf Town. Glad we did it!
202,nice ride,"An amazing piece of Brunels engineering, a lovely  structure in itself,  with amazing  views to boot. A toll charge  applies for traffic,  but you can walk across for free."
203,Clifton Suspension Bridge - a must on any Bristol visit,A must for visitors/tourists to the area. Don't forget popping into the visitor centre.Brunel. You genius!
204,Very nice experience ,"I was staying at the Marriott which is about 1.5 miles walk, be warned it is uphill but well worth the walk. I got to the bridge and the sun was shining, it was fairly quite and the views were stunning. Well worth a visit if in Bristol"
205,Just a big bridge,we were a few days ago it was all very beautifulwe had a good timewe will come back soon Very nice experience
206,Must see on any Bristol visit.,We drove across then parked in the town below the bridge. Limited parking. We walked up to the bridge and crossed a couple of times. Great views. Very busy with commuters when we were there; vehicles and foot traffic.
207,well worth the drive,"Recently visited Bristol celebrating a Birthday within my group of friends. A local gentlemen recommended an excellent place which provided magnificent views of this awesome structure.A short taxi journey to The White Lion pub (also does food), has a spectacular outside area which looks directly onto the bridge.Well worth a visit."
208,Brunel History,The Clifton Suspension Bridge is a very impressive structure with extensive views down the Avon George. It can be crossed by foot free of charge but there is a toll for vehicles. It is well worth a visit whilst in Bristol
209,One of bristols wonders.,Amazing structure completes a visit to Bristol on the train route set out by I K Brunel and a visit to see the S S Great Britain.
210,Enchanting,"It’s a bridge that doesn’t really go anywhere, but the style and look of this bridge is a site to behold"
211,Too pricey ,"Terrific views of the Portway running beneath the  bridge, alongside the river.  I remember, as a child, thinking the cars were toys!!  Constructed over a hundred years ago, by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, this is one of the greatest bridges in the world!!  (No hydraulic excavators in those days either!!  Please make a detour to see this amazing bridge (or go along the top route and drive over it!!!   Superb........"
212,loved it,After seeing the bridge on our drive into Bristol when we told our teenagers we would walk (mainly uphill) to see it they said but we’ve already seen it from the car! Luckily when we got there they were very impressed even in the rain! The view is amazing and well worth the walk
213,What a bridge,"Bridge opened in the middle of the XIX century. In its beginnings it was a doll bridge. It is more than 400 meters long and the views of the surroundings are spectacular. It is without a doubt one of Bristol's landmarks, and well worth the climb."
214,Stunning bridge...,An interesting insight into how the bridge was designed and built. The walk across the bridge was worth doing (despite not being fond of heights) to see it up close and for the views. Great to see this iconic structure up close & personal and to marvel at this feat of engineering. Well worth a visit.
215,Amazing piece of engineering,We did not go into the actual bridge buttresses but visited Clifton and walked over the bridge in both directions and then photographed the bridge Fromm beneath in the gorge.A remarkable bridge and an iconic image of Bristol
216,It's high up!,"Beautiful bridge, enjoyed the virw with olives, cheese sticks and red wine.Have to pay £1 each way to get over it so unless you need to, park on the side your on"
217,Worth a look at ,Great views of the bridge from the footpath below and a walk in Leigh woods. Then we went to the observatory and had views from above. It’s really quite spectacular. Went over in the car for £1. If you have never seen it it’s definitely worth a look
218,""" an amazing sight..""","Took my daughter back to Uni, had a few hours spare so we went for a lovely walk across Clifton Suspension Bridge. I would highly recommended to take the walk across the bridge, well worth it - weather needs to be nice though :)"
219,Amazing Architecture,Well what a fabulous bridge. Get out and walk across. Amazing engineering. Brunel was a genius. So worth a visit.
220,Another reason to visit Bristol,Finally got here. We have visited Somerset many times an have never visited the bridge. What a fabulous bit of craftsmanship. It has amazing views across the gorge. It was a bit cloudy on the day we visited so must return on a sunny day. There also the observatory and cave.
221,Amazing view,"I did the guided tour (free every saturday at 3pm) and was wonderful! A lot of fun facts and all the history.... Even if you can't go to the guided tour, try to go at Saturdays because there are volunteers to answer all your question.Don't forget to visit the Visitor Centre when you can see old pictures and a lot of information.And go the observatory where there's a observation point."
222,Amazing!,Wandered up to the bridge today. Didn't know about the visitors centre. It's well worth the trip if you are looking at the bridge. Free entry (donations) friendly staff and good exhibits. I would say about a half hour visit. There is a section for children to construct different types of bridges.
223,Interesting enough,"Another great piece of architecture, perfect for anyone visiting the area. Highly recommended to all."
224,A superb piece of engineering,"Brunel's iconic bridge, which must be visited to be appreciated.  Fantastic feat of engineering, with fabulous views of the Avon Gorge."
225,Clifton Suspension Bridge ,But no parking meant we couldn't walk over it which was disappointing. We did drive over and under and it's an incredible structure but not at all welcoming for visitors. No signage even for local parking...
226,Amazing Construction,"Visited today after a gap of nearly 40 years (last visit was in primary school) it amazed me more than it did then.t’s free to walk across the bridge and take in the breath-taking views and marvel at the unbelievable feat of engineering.There are all different facts that you can read as you walk across on both sides, giving you all the information, you need to enhance your visit.After walking it, we decided that we had to drive over it too.All in all a very enjoyable visit, one that I won’t wait a further 40 years to re-visit."
227,Don't look down! ,"It was quite windy and grey but the village of Clifton and the bridge left an excellent impression. The bridge is so impressive with a view of the gorges down below, the river Avon and the roads with a view also on the coloured houses in Bristol. A must-see."
228,One of England's engineering marvels.,It is thrilling to drive across this amazing example of Victorian engineering.  Well worth the one pound roll.
229,Just enjoyed the experience!,"My wife and I caught Bristol Harbour ferry to The pump house , and decided to walk up to the bridge , it was only about 30 minute walk but all up very steep hill , not for the faint hearted. The bridge is a wonder thing , amazing feat of engineering, the views are outstanding in all directions including down , a long way down . We never went to visitor centre , so can not comment on that , but just a visit to the bridge is well worth it just for the view"
230,Worth a look,"One of the main attractions in Bristol, this bridge is definitely worth a visit. It's an impressive long bridge over a very tall cliff, on Sunday afternoons there are free guided tours that can be boring at times but better than just crossing the bridge."
231,Very impressive ,"Really interesting. Got there easily on bus 8 from Bristol. Did the cave thing, which was ok - see the bridge from the side of the gulley."
232,Good views,We decided to get the train over to Clifton and head out for the day. Clifton Suspension Bridge is about a 30min walk from Clifton Down railway station.Once you’re there you can walk over and take in the lovely views of the Avon gorge. To walk over it’s free to take a car it’s £1. The bridge itself is an amazing piece of infastucture and the views are beautiful. Head up the hill to the old observatory for better photos. Great to do when the balloon fiesta is on.
233,Beautiful...,"This is a landmark in Bristol. It speaks for itself as it's a suspension bridge. You can walk across this in either direction. I didn't see it as part of a tour. I passed by whilst completing the Gromit Trail. We were on the Clifton side of the bridge & walked across to the other side to see the statue, which was part of the trail. It was a warm clear day & we had great views  of either side of the bridge.There isn't anything there other than the bridge, but on the Clifton side there is agreenery, a small park & coffee shop a short walk away at the Clifton Observatory."
234,Pretty,We visited the suspension bridge having walked up from Bristol. We followed the river and then walked through the National Trust park to reach one side of the suspension bridge. Amazing views crossing it on foot and looking up at the industrial engineering of its time. Walked over to the observatory on the other side then down through Clifton. Would have liked to have seen the visitors centre but closed due to COVID.
235,Wonderful views,An amazing feat of engineering by the highly innovative Mr Brunel. Great views from the bridge. There is a visitor's centre at one end and toilets at the other. Free (of course) and right next to the observatory which is also worth a visit
236,Free to walk 🌉📸🌳,"The bridge itself makes you think about how much work went into it almost 160 years ago. The visitor centre is excellent - free to go in and with volunteer staff, who were knowledgeable and friendly. Visited the Observatory afterwards - excellent cafe here."
237,Good views. £1 to drive over,"I’m assuming this is due to coronavirus but everything is very user unfriendly. No stopping on the bridge, walkways made very claustrophobic by metal fencing, and god help you if you want to look at anything around the bridge. Wouldn’t recommend while COVID-19 restrictions in place.The hill next to it is nice though."
238,Good photo opportunity,I didn't realise it was possible to walk over the suspension bridge so it made it doubly interesting. You get great views of the river and gorge and can appreciate the engineering required to span the river. There is a visitor centre on the west bank and you can get some great photos of the bridge from the observatory on the east bank.
239,Great visitor centre and tour,"Costs £1 to cross the bridge, well worth it. Marvellous piece of engineering. You need to get out of your car once you have crossed to really appreciate the bridge."
240,Enjoyable walk!,This was on our bucket list for many years so we traveled by local Bus from Bristol city centre to Clifton and walked across this bridge in both directions. It is staggeringly high up and a technical achievement of immense proportions to have built it. Not to be missed.Make every effort to visit if you are in Bristol.
241,Free walking tour,"I was jammy with the weather, which was beautiful for October, but had a lovely afternoon crossing the very famous Clifton Suspension Bridge on foot and soaking up the atmopshere of the surrounding area."
242,The Historical Vaults Tour at Clifton Suspension Bridge,There is a gem of an visitor centre at the western end of the bridge run by volunteers with good quality information boards and displays. Visting it helps to put the construction of the bridge is historical context and the engineering that made it possible
243,bridge,It has long been my wish to visit this icon. We were staying at the Caravan Club Site so followed the riverside walk that goes under the bridge giving good views as one approaches. We then ascended through Leigh Woods (National Trust) and along North Road to the bridge itself.We went into the small but well presented Museum before walking over the bridge itself.A superb walk and visit.
244,Good for a half hour visit,I found it really interesting and easy to understand how the bridge came into being and why. The walk across was easy and the views fantastic
245,It’s functional ,We stopped by on our way from Cardiff to Bristol because we heard it is really nice. It shouldn't disappoint. Crossing the bridge with the car costs £1 but you can also walk over the bridge for free as I understood. There is parking available. You need to pay for it though. A little walk up the hill and you will get to the top with lovely views towards the bridge. There is even some kind of Grotto which you can go inside and have a totally different experience. Can't judge on it because we didn't do it because of the queue. If you are in that area I would highly recommend to stop by. There is a small cafe where you can get hot drinks and a little to eat as well. Even if you only have 30 minutes to spare. Do it.
246,Well worth a visit,"Whether you pay £1 toll to slowly drive over this truly amazing feat of engineering, or you leisurely stroll over it, the view of not only parts of Bristol, but the incredible sight of the gorge and river below you, are stunningly brilliant..Its situated in the CLIFTON area of the city, hence its name..Plenty of local buses go to this area of the city, so dont go paying taxi fares to get here..Look up official city bus tours to check their routes too..Dont leave Bristol without taking the time too see the truly amazing feat of engineering.."
247,Spectacular interesting ,"Drove over , paying the £1. toll and parked up. Walked back across and visited the visitor centre which was informative.Walked back and really enjoyed it.Lovely views across Bristol."
248,Great views,"If you like bridges, dams, or other pieces of past engineering designs it's the place on your to do list anyway!Brilliant"
249,New Years walk,"We walked over this suspension bridge which opened in 1864 and spans the Avon Gorge above the River Avon.  It links Leigh Woods in North Somerset and Clifton in Bristol.  Both sides provide stunning views of the countryside, and it is a wonderful legacy of the work of Brunel, a 19th Century architect, also responsible for construction of Paddington Station, Thames Tunnel and other notable public projects in the 1800s."
250,Definitely visit while in Bristol,There was a free walking tour arranged for Sunday afternoon.  No booking required.  Our guide was informative and funny and it was a very interesting trip across the Avon Gorge.
251,£1 each way ,"This was one on my bucket list and I wasn’t disappointed, what an amazing structure, with the recent Covid-19 pandemic social distancing is in place so I walked over one side of the bridge and back over the other, my fascination has now been quenched."
252,"This really IS an ""icon"". It symboliises Bristol.","This was one of my priorities on what to see whilst in Bristol but thanks to the constant torrential rain,high winds and not so good visibility when I finally got to the bridge, I decided to not walk accross it as I was soaked to tjhe skin.   Maybe next time.  Maybe the sun will appear or actually be dry next time."
253,Spenny,"We never realised that Bristol was so hilly but the journey up to the bridge is, in itself an experience, through some quite narrow roads lined with impressive houses and, especially on a Sunday, bonnet to bumper cars.The first sight of the bridge, from the back seat of a car was fantastic, and the trip across was something long wished for, even though the view of the gorge was limited from the car.Obviously, you can walk across, but weather was not conducive on this occasion for us to do that. Maybe another time."
254,Amazing ,we took a walk over the suspension bridge as part of all things Brunel! plus went in the giants cave which is accessible from the observatory looking over the bridge and saw the camera obscura as well. good fun and the kids found it interesting too. definitely woth doing!
255,Well worth checking out this engineering marvel!,"Well done to whoever made the decision to stop runners going cross Clifton Suspension Bridge! Lost count of the number times we have had to quickly assume single file or take cover as runners come charging down the narrow path across the bridge! One way also makes sense and should remain after lockdown.Nothing against runners in general, plenty of open spaces to pursue your running interests around Bristol but it does seem slightly antisocial charging across a busy tourist spot!"
256,Weekend in  Bristol. ,"Well worth a visit.We got the service bus from the centre of Bristol to Clifton, (No 9) a £5 day rider ticket pp. So excellent value as we used them to get to the other side of the city.A short walk from Clifton village centre to the Bridge, Gorge and The Observatory with the excellent 'cave/steps' down to the viewing platform, halfway down on a ledge of the gorge. (This was an unexpected pleasant surprise), The cave was £4pp and well worth it with some further stunning views.The weather wasn't brilliant on the day so it wasn't that busy on our visit, so we had the platform virtually to ourselves.The Observatory and café roof top also gave excellent views.A nice walk across the Bridge which also gave stunning views of the City and Gorge.One of the highlights of our visit to the city."
257,Fabulous views,Fortunately due to where I live I regularly have to cross the bridge and it never disappoints.Whether by car or on foot I am always in awe of the engineering.
258,Great architecture and views of the Avon Gorge,"A walk across the bridge is one of the cheapest activities available anywhere. The Suspension bridge is the City's symbol. And Bristol LOVES I.K. Brunel, who designed it (and so much else locally, like the Great Western Railway, the SS Great Britain...) The bridge stands on one edge of ""The Downs"" a massive open space owned jointly by the people of Bristol, near the Camera Obscura, glamorous Clifton village, and, a few hundred yards from the far side of the Bridge (follow the road to the main junction, and carefully cross-over  to the ornate gatehouse on the other side of the main road). you've now reached another huge park, called the Smythe Estate."
259,Great experience ,"We were not sure if we would be able to go on the bridge and walk over as it was the weekend of Storm Ciara.  But sun came out, wind dropped and we had a lovely walk over. Stunning views"
260,Wow! ,"We live in Bristol but have never taken the children for a walk across the suspension bridge. We parked on the Leigh Woods side and walked across to Clifton village. Cold, windy, dark but such pretty views. Worth a visit in all seasons and time of day."
261,Outstanding,"Have been here with friends from London for a weekend off, so we knew we must visit here too.The bridge and the surrounding area was very clean, catering places observed social distancing very well whilst visitors could enjoy their visit nearly as normal as before lockdown restrictions.Let my pictures talk!"
262,Holiday visit,"The engineering greatness of this bridge can never be fully realised or comprehended by most people. When designed & built it was so far ahead of its time.Located in a stunning & beautiful location, both close to Bristol & the M5 motorway, it is ideal place to stop & visit, even for a short break while travelling up or down the M5."
263,Amazing architecture and history!,"Myself and my daughter went up to the suspension bridge this morning to watch the sunrise and hoped to get a glimpse of any hot air balloons- it was around 5am. We more or less had the bridge to ourselves due to it being so early. We approached the bridge from Clifton Village and asked the first attendant if it was open to walk across and asked if there was a good view of the sunrise.He explained it was now a one way system due to Covid and was really lovely and helpful saying that we would get a nice view across the other side of the bridge. We took photos along the way and it was a beautiful sight. We got to the other side and as we went to cross over to walk back, we took a quick photo of the view through the bridge on the road. Then a voice bellowed over 'ON THE PATH!' (it was 5am and there was no-one around) I said please can we just take 1 as it was so beautiful and he responded again 'ON THE PATH'.Anyway I said ok, fair enough and then asked is there a good viewpoint on this side that you know of to get a nice photo of the sunrise and he responded rudely & rather aggressively 'WE AREN'T HERE FOR TOURISM WE JUST GET PEOPLE FROM A TO B!'. I was quite shocked by his nasty response and was slightly confused, as I was under the impression that the Suspension Bridge was an important place of interest in Bristol therefore attracted tourism. I think a little refresher course in customer service and general good manners is needed or whatever you do, do not ask any tourism related questions to certain bridge attendants - It obviously makes them very angry!!"
264,magnificent piece of architecture and screams Bristol,"The Clifton Suspension Bridge, approached through the excellent village of Clifton, is a significant heritage site, fantastic feat of engineering and the views along the gorge are amazing, especially when one thinks of all the ships that would have passed along the river in times past!"
265,Beautiful ,"A walk across this bridge was on my wife""s bucket list so off we went. Amazing sight but unfortunately I suffer with the fear of heights and was not able to get more than twenty metres onto the bridge. But the reason I am making a comment is the very kind chap maybe security in the booth at the entrance came to my aid as I was about to pass out. He was very kind and even suggested he walked me over himself, which I declined. But I would like the firm that employs this man should be very proud of the respect he showed me. Thankyou."
266,Beautiful bridge and surrounds,Came to Bristol earlier this week for a couple days away. The Clifton suspension bridge is not to be missed! For a good view it’s probably best from the observatory found just uphill from it.Managed to catch a hot air balloon flight while viewing!Perfect for a picnic.......or smoke while taking in the sites 😎
267,Beautiful Bridge,The bridge and its history are brought to life by the visitor centre which is well worth a visit for 30 minutes. Little ones enjoy the upstairs where they can use wooden 'bricks' and shapes to try and reconstruct the bridge. Excellent histories and information on the walls that I have often recalled and repeated!
268,WOW,"Built in the mid 1800’s, this is the most iconic image of Bristol. Spanning the Avon Gorge and Avon River it’s so worth a look and a drive over (one pond toll, goes to maintenance). Absolutely beautiful."
269,Very impressive.,"It's the focal lush point of Bristol.  I drive over it as well, but they must get rid of the charge ..."
270,Great views,"We had gone to visit Bristol and the Clifton Suspension Bridge was on our list to see and was our first stop. Brilliant. Highly recommended to any visitor to take the walk across the bridge, go into the interpretation/information centre and then walk back. Well worth it."
271,Wow factor,"We stopped here on our way into Bristol to visit this famous bridge and we were very impressed. We managed to park for free for an hour on the side of the road just off the side of the entry point to the suspension bridge. Top tip the visits centre has toilets if you've had a long drive! Then we walked over the bridge, up to the viewing point and the mini castle with the cafe which gave a good view and then walked back. Great place to stop for 15 minutes and get a photo."
272,Great views from historic bridge.,"I made the mistake of standing on the middle island between the lifting barriers to get a photograph down through the centre of the bridge (not in anyone's way) but an officious jobsworth was quite aggressive in telling me to move, not listening to anything I said but working himself up into a lather. There were no signs prohibiting my presence there. Once I'd vacated the spot, we walked both ways across the bridge on a stunningly sunny January day.- the views are magnificent and the engineering achievement is as incredible today as it must have been when Brunel first conceived it."
273,Impressive bridge great views ,Got charged £2.50 going one way. Thought we were going to wales. Didn’t. Then had to pay a quid to get back. I’ll take the Dartford crossing in future!
274,A really insightful exhibition,"Seeing this icon of Victorian engineering close up is a 'must' if you've a couple of hours spare in Bristol. Crossing on foot is free, but not ideal if you suffer from vertigo - and it's a great way of finding out if you have. The visitor centre wasn't open when we crossed but the bridge experience speaks for itself. Take a cup of coffee at The Observatory above the eastern end and take in its magnificence."
275,"Excellent, Superb views of the Gorge and City","What more can anyone say about Brunel's marvel. If you visit Bristol, you must see and walk over the bridge. We are very proud of our bridge. Parking near, not great. Better of using public transport or parking up and walking a bit."
276,Beautiful sights ,"One of several must see places in Bristol is the Clifton suspension bridge, a spectacular piece of engineering and well worth a walk across and back, busy traffic wise using the bridge, great views up and down the gorge."
277,lovely views,"What a wonderfull piece of history. The bridge is an excellent example of  of Brunel's ingenuity and has stood the test of time. The work of the bridge Volunteers/friends is truley something else, the are so dedicated and passionate. The views from the bridge are a must to see, for all visitors to Bristol."
278,A beautiful feat of engineering,Great experience for a pound. The bridge held and I made it over. I guess others may not be so lucky.
279,Interesting,Came here the other week with my children as we had to walk passed it to get to the Clifton observatory.  It certainly is a feat of engineering - bit wobbly as cars drive passed you.  There was a free guided tour but we did not have time to make use of this. Got some great photos though.
280,Stunning Bridge - interesting history,"This is Bristol's most iconic symbol, it's history is fascinating and worth researching - for example Brunel designed it but never finished it, it was completed in 1864, five years after his death. walking over it is a great experience because it is so high above the Avon gorge. Besides good views from the bridge there are also good views of it from above, from the side and from the gorge below - all worth doing. The visitor centre at the end of the bridge is also worth a visit."
281,2 hour Hardhat tour of the bridge,"It is just a bridge that crosses a river, so what's the fuss. Well it is still standing when more recent constructions have had to be closed and it has many design features that pioneers bridge design. I have a fear of heights so cannot really attest to the views, but am assured they are amazing. I walked across and back to say I had done it, but spent most time just admiring the construction. Go there and just muse on the abilities of our forebears that we seem to have lost sight of. Inspirational. Sadly the visitor centre was closed when we went"
282,Wow!,"Travelled to Bristol by car, travelled over the bridge to the visitor centre and spent some time looking at the exhibition.Walked over the bridge taking the terrific views of the Avon Gorge, walked up the winding path to the Observatory where you take in the magnitude of the engineering of the bridge, visited the cafe for ice cream."
283,A feat of engineering worth visiting.,"I just love this bridge, Clifton Gorge and the whole of the Clifton and Durdham Downs wildlife area."
284,unimaginable views. Technical brilliance,It costs £1 to drive over the Bridge (they take contactless) and there is a small museum nearby. There is parking in the residential streets near by if you want to walk across the bridge just to say you’ve done it.
285,Beautiful View,"Greedy council takes a £1 every trip.  That is inexcusable,  for people who need to cross it. Avoid, to punish council."
286,A wonderful visit full of nostalgia,Both my partner and I had decided to cycle to the Clifton Suspension Bridge. It took us a while and a bit of effort but it was well worth it. When travelling on foot or by bicycle there is no fee to cross the bridge. If you have a car we noted a few spots you could park up and walking on foot to the bridge. The bridge itself was very impressive and worth checking out if in Bristol.
287,A must to visit,"Honestly, this bridge is an absolute feat of engineering and that’s before you even get to the time it was built! Parking seemed a little bit difficult (we got really lucky and got one of two spaces right next to it). Really cool place to spend an hour or so walking around and taking photos"
288,Amazing views,Certainly worth a trip... I cycled across it on a recent tour of Bristol and Glastonbury... certainly recommend as its stunning.
289,Impressive and so peaceful,"Designed by Brunel in 1835, this bridge is possibly the most iconic sight in Bristol.  It's a toll bridge and a crossing by car costs £1 a go.  You can also cross the bridge on foot (for free), offering great views across the river and Avon Gorge.It's worth climbing up to the Clifton observatory for even better views."
290,Great Example of Victorian Engineering,Our Technical Tour guide David Steen was an incredibly informatative and interesting guide. And we loved the stories of Brunel! To go down under the bridge was a huge privilege...
291,A must see when visiting Bristol.,"Have been wanting to visit this bridge for some time so arranged a few days in Bristol to allow a visit. The bridge itself and the views of it, is brilliant as it spans the Avon Gorge. the river tide was out at our visit but, even so, it was still well worth the visit. Good views from the observatory above the gorge."
292,Walk over the bridge,"this was something I wanted to do for some time and now I have done it I am planning doing it again, I am organising a trip for club members that wish to share our experience"
293,Engineering Marvel..,I love it. It's so characteristic. Lovely.Expecially in the night when his lights are all turned on and it shines in the dark.
294,Gorgeous place ,"I was at a meeting nearby at the Engineers House and decided to walk over after work one day.  I’m glad I did, beautiful views."
295,Great!,"how this was made is anyone's guess, it's a great example of british engineering at its best - come for the afternoon"
296,"Incredible history, a masterpiece to be seen","....but don’t go out of your way! The bridge is, well, a bridge and you can visit the ‘lookout’ for a Birdseye view of the gorge and a climb down to the caves to see the vista from the giants mouth cave, but...this a ‘while we’re there, let’s do it’ kind of thing. It’s certainly shouldn’t be a must do on anyone visiting list."
297,An icon,"One of the most iconic sites in Bristol designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, but completed after his death, and with some changes to his original design.  Look out for differences in the two stone bridge supports - they are not the same."
298,'Must do' when in Bristol,"Probably Bristol's most famous landmark, built by the great engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, in 1864, the bridge as amazing to see now as it was then.  It is possible to see it from afar from locations in the city and to visit it, just catch a bus to Clifton.  The bridge allows cars, bikes and pedestrians to cross.  There is a toll for cars, while bikes and pedestrians are free.    If you drive north out of Bristol on the A4 road, you will pass under the bridge."
299,Excellent display and very informative staff,"The Clifton Suspension Bridge spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon, linking Clifton in Bristol to Leigh Woods in North Somerset. Opened in 1864, it was built William Henry Barlow and John Hawkshaw, based on an earlier design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It is a toll bridge and costs £1 (October 2019) to cross in your car."
