0,Take the Bloody Shot,"In the opening scenes of the James Bond movie ""Skyfall"" they race across the roof of the covered bazaar in Istanbul and suddenly find themselves on the top of a train racing through the Taurus Mountains. James and the bad guy are fighting on the roof of the train, M says to Eve the other agent ""Take the shot."" Eve says ""I can't, I may hit Bond."" M says, ""Take the bloody shot."" And the story evolves from there. This is the viaduct where the scene was shot. It is in a gorgeous spot in the Taurus mountains, north of the city of Adana.  In May of 2012 I was riding the Erciyes Expresi from Kayseri to Adana when my Turkish friend called to say, ""They are going to take everyone off the train at Pozanti because they 're filming the latest James Bond movie between there and Adana and the line is closed. It was Skyfall. You can travel this route on TCDD, Turkish Railways and it is a scenic ride indeed, but to go to this viaduct by car is a better idea because you can take the time to take it all in. You might even see a train go by. There is a picnic area there and you can have tea.  For James Bond fans it is a must see."
1,Fantastic,"The bridge and the mountain view is an awe! The Varda Viaduct is locally known as ""Alman Köprüsü"" or ""Koca Köprü"" (literally: German Viaduct or Big Viaduct), is a railway viaduct situated at Hacıkırı (Kıralan) village in Karaisalı district of Adana Province in southern Turkey. Designed and built by Imperial German engineers as part of the Baghdad Railway. The building of the viaduct was coupled with the construction of the Ottoman-German project of Istanbul-Baghdad railway line to connect Berlin with Basra, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to enable direct supply of oil to German industry. The most difficult terrain on the route to overcome was the section at the Taurus Mountains between Konya and Adana, more specifically around the region of Belemedik, where in a distance of 12 km (7.5 mi) 22 tunnels in a row had to be dug in twenty years. In 1903, the construction work force, consisting of German technical staff and thousands of multi-national workers, settled in a camp newly established in Belemedik, where all necessary facilities such as hospital, church, school, movie theatre and even mosque were built. The construction began in 1905, and in 1907, the main works were completed. Technical details were accomplished in 1912. The railway on the viaduct went into service in 1916. The train jump scene in 007 Skyfall movie was shot on this bridge. The bridge is over 100 years old and still holding strong."
2,"The James Bond bridge (actually the ""German bridge"")",The bridge was also called the German Bridge because it was built by the Germans. The steel case stone masonry type bridge was started to built in 1888 within the scope of a contract between the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamit II and German Emperor Kaiser Willhem in order to complete the Baghdad-Hedjaz Railway line. The best way to visit the bridge is to take the “Erciyes” or “Toros” railway express from Adana to Hacikiri province. the bridge is 500m far from the railroad station. On a clear day Seyhan Dam Lake and Adana can be seen in the distance. The famous Kapikaya Canyon also can be seen from Varda bridge.
3,Take your camera!!!,"Beautiful bridge built by the Germans in the 1910's. Beautiful scenery and surroundings. The trip there on its own is worth it. Very popular among people of the area. You can get something local to eat, tea or coffee to drink and there is a bathroom if you don't want to use the bushes. Everything minimalistic.Scene of one of the clips in the Skyfall movie. Be sure to be surprised by the movie tricks that were being used to make it look different than the real thing. Beautiful plants in the ravine and all around. There is an easy hiking trail down into the river."
4,Worth the trip,"It is not easy  to get there- a friend gave us a lift- but we really enjoyed the view. I even watched James Bond movie, because the bridge appeared in it."
5,Perfect,"only possible to visit in a car (or on a train!!!). Quite windy roads -approach from the west if you want an easier driveThis is the one at the start of Skyfall, see youtube for videos"
6,Varda railway viaduct earns popularity after the movie ‘Skyfall’,it's the perfect place you can see as numbers in the world.that's what you can see in James Bond.it's still being used.and there's a train.you can eat the traditional food that is sold there.the price is very reasonable and secure.at the same time you can visit the canyon nearby and there are many beautiful places to eat.don't come back before you eat.you won't regret it.
7,school trip,"We went here to watch the sunset, the views are amazing, there's even toilets available that were very clean. The only trouble I had with this place was the road to it, you need to pass a few more attractions to get here and there's soo much traffic and cars everywhere... I think this could be approved to increase tourism in the area. We thought about going back several times, but glad we made it."
8,Interesting place,"we have been together with 18 art student to draw all the railway stations in Adana. ıt was amazing experience. The area itself very charming that bridge has built by German engineers and still living what means living- still trains are pasing- very nice, high and solid."
9,Amazing!,James Bond inspired trip. Pretty bridge but there is not much around there to do except the mountains but great for a picnic or bbq. Get a good view of it from the small tea place opposite.
10,German bridge in Adana,"A very nice, clean, beautiful, picturesque place to spend time with the family and make remarkable photos."
11,The Varda Viaduct and the mountain view is an awe!,Being a James Bond fan this was a must on my bucket list! A fantastic place to visit and totally unspoilt! Visited on a Sunday and very quiet! A must visit if you are staying in and around Adana x
12,Bonding with history,"Although it is a bit out of the way, easier to approach from the Ankara autoban road, it is an amazing sight! Out in the Taurus mountains, it is snuggled in a valley and rises into sight a grand,tall and amazing bridge! Definitely worth a visit!"
13,Nice day out.,"The best way to get there is with a private car. So we rented a car. It took 1h 15 min drive to reach the bridge from Adana city centre. We went through a beautiful scenery all the way: hills and mountains, tall trees, even a small waterfall with geese and ducks not too far from the bridge. We reached the site just on time to witness the train crossing the bridge. The view was breathtaking! We were also very happy to find restrooms on site. They were new and very clean."
14,worth the trip!,Visited today. Great drive up. A bit scary. Seen lots of locals. Great piece of architecture. A little scary looking down from top.
15,Interesting train bridge,"50 km from Adana with the last 10 km on dirty roads. Road improvement ongoing so should be a pleasure driving in the near future.Bridge is impressive. Great photo shooting location with the bridge in back ground.The road around the ravine (passes through the rock) is extremely narrow and not for the faint hearted, especially when passing oncoming traffic.The bridge top has hand rails only on one side. Hold on tightly to young kids.Dusty road but worth the visit."
16,"Skyfall bridge, German Bridge, Varda Koprusu","Beautiful railroad bridge constructed by Germans, thats why its called Alman Köprüsü, good place to have an outdoor walk and enjoy scene."
17,great architecture with fabolous view,"Its not easy to get here but its absolutely worth it! The bridge is beautiful and the view is amazing. You can spend the whole afternoon there, just sitting on the rocks and watch the view and the train coming by. If you have the chance to visit you definitely should!"
18,Skyfall bridge,This is good for a short trip with some hiking to the bottom if you want.  It was built in the early 1900's and took five years to build. At the nearby by tea stand the have a picture showing how they used a cable car to build it. There is free parking and drinks are available. Bathrooms are a short walk and are newly built.
