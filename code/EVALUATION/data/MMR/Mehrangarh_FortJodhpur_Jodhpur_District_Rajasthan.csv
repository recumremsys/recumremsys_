Mehrangarh fort was built by Rao Jodha in the year 1459. The fort is spread over an area of 5 km and is built on 125 m high hill in the outskirts of Jodhpur city. It is considered as one of the most formidable and magnificent forts of Rajasthan,There are seven gates.  These 7 gates are made by different rulers over the time to represent the valor over their enemies .The main palaces located in the Mehrangarh Fort are Moti Mahal, Phool Mahal, Sheesh Mahal, Zenana Dude, Takht Vilas and Jhanki Mahal. There are also two temples located inside the fort - Chamundi Devi Mandir and Nagnechiaji Mandir, dedicated to Goddess Durga and the Kuldevi respectively.There is also a museum within the Mehrangarh fort, which exhibits a rich collection of palanquins, musical instruments, royal cradles, costumes, arms, furniture and paintings.One can see the panoramic view of the Jodhpur city from this fort . 2 hours is required to visit this fort completely .

You certainly get a feeling of what life was like in this part of India over the centuries. There are plenty of viewing areas to photograph the fort and the views over Jodhpur. Allow at least 2 hours. There is a very good souvenir shop with books and items of clothing and also a fine café to rest. The views from the roof gardens and main restaurant at sunset are amazing and well worth booking a meal. As darkness falls the Fort is progressively lit and beautifully displayed.…"

Most of the Fort is a museum which gives a great insight into Royal living.There is a nice cafe inside and few shops selling local handicrafts.Must visit spot.
33,Group tour to Rajasthan.,"Mehrangarh fort is best place for city people and outsider due to two reason, one this is only fort in Jodhpur having a glimpse of king dynasty. Yow could see canons and various type of safa(cap),along with culture how the queens can sit in jharokha to indulge in the discussion with king and his kingdom men.Second thing the temple of Maa, kuldevi of kings is also situated in campus of fort, so people of city used to visit the fort for this reason also.As this is not govt. property, still its holding is with King Gajendra Singh, so you will find his personal there, but now the tickets of the visiting fort is increasing year by year. This fort has lift so you can go straight at top floor then you can see fort floor one by one while moving downwards. This fort has several restaurant for tea, coffee, lassi and fast food etc.Good place in Jodhpur to visit. There are restaurant"

54,I am amazed at the preservation of this ancient architecture. ,"Must Visit Fort when you're in/around Jodhpur. I found this fort quite different as compared to other forts that I had visited earlier, one of the difference was that it was managed by a society and they ensure that every section is well managed and they also give opportunities to people living in the surrounding areas to let them display/sell their handicraft items on monthly/rotational basis, so that everyone gets an equal opportunities. And yes...do not forget to avail the guide's services, otherwise you'd miss main attractions :)"
55,One of my favourite place in Jodhpur,"Mehrangarh Fort, together with Jaipur's Amber Fort, is probably the most splendid of Rajasthan's royal residences.

62,One of Best Fort of India ,Must visit if you are in Jodhpur. The view of blue houses from the fort is just amazing. You need 2-3 hours easily to see the fort so plan accordingly.

76,Amazing and Interesting place to Visit,Spectacular fort over Jodphur.  Audio guide interesting and well paced.  Mix of indoor and outdoor locations.  Well maintained. 
77,Best fort experience in Rajasthan,"When in Jodhpur, one must see this world’s second largest fort. We reached there around 12 noon which was not a good time as it was very crowded. Most people visit other touristy places and then come here. I would recommend to go to this magnificent fort first in the morning. We took the lift to go up and it was well worth the wait and small amount of money. We did not take any guide as most of the required information is written all around....and detailed information we may not even remember after sometime! The views from the top are fantastic. Toilets are clean. The museum is nice and the museum shop is well worth a visit."
78,"Unbelievable, truly felt as if I was being taken back in time.","Mehrangarh Fort is very well preserved thanks in large part to the Mehrangarh Museum Trust managed by Gaj Singh, the present maharaja of Jodhpur. It's the reason that it wears its 500 years lightly. Tours to the fort are well organized; our guide, Ashraf (given to us by staff of Raas Hotel) was knowledgeable, articulate, and very responsive to questions and comments. The fort is well signposted, has properly designed rest and refreshment areas, its public toilets are spotless, and it is surprisingly free from the kind of vandalism one sees in other similar heritage sites across India. It takes about 2-3 hours to go around the fort to get an idea of its size, its significance, how it grew, the logic for its architecture, and the various rooms and halls that have been immaculately preserved. The fort is floodlit from 7-9 p.m. each day and is a magnificent sight from any place within Jodhpur. To be enjoyed best accompanied by a drink with music from old Marwar.A most educative and satisfying experience!"
79,Feeling the Royal thrill..one of the Best fort  of India,"If you have a half day time with you then its worth visiting this one of the largest fort. Beautifully designed and built by then King with safety. The Museum, Darbar, Mahal, Cannon, Temple, everything still the same. Rather then me describing here you will just feel it when you visit."
80,Very educational ,"The fort would be worth visiting for a tourist! Dive into the history of Jodhpur by visiting it! The view from the top is amazing! Try spotting the blue houses!Tip- Use the elevator to climb up and come down by foot,won't be tiring!"
81,Beautiful fort and city views,"Its an imposing fort visible from far distances and  one of the largest forts in India, it undoubtedly a must visit. A visit to the fort will make you realize the foresight and the attention to detail that was envisaged even during those times. Built by Rao Jodha in the 1400's  the fort is located some 400 feet above the city and is enclosed by thick walls. Inside the fort  there are several palaces known for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards. The museum inside the fort is fully stocked with items used by the royals of that era and is definitely not to be missed. Also inside the fort are several brilliantly crafted and decorated palaces which include include  Moti Mahal (Pearl Palace), Phool Mahal (Flower Palace), Sheesha Mahal (Mirror Palace) etc. There are galleries displaying a rare collection of armour from every period in Jodhpur, Palquins, Paintings, Turbans and a lot more. Also donning the top are cannons which protected the fort during times of war.What is amazing is the view that one witnesses from the top of the fort. You can see the entire city from up there and also the Umed Palace across the town. Sunsets are beautiful so be there during that period; its amazing.There are some shops selling souveriers and other local stuff and cafeteria inside the fort if you are in for it. There is a lot of distance to be covered walking once you are inside so keep yourself liquidated and make sure you go in with a lot of time you sure will need it."
82,Beautiful Fort,"We have been to amber fort, red fort and agra fort and personally this one is my favourite . This never ending walk up to the castle and its grounds can get quite tiring in the heat of sun city .The battlements and ornate design make this piece of architecture artistically Marwar. Offering great views of the Blue City, lovers of India should not miss it."
83,Breathtaking experience,This has to be one of the best kept and most magnificent forts I have seen in Rajasthan. It is worth a visit. Just past the ticket counters there are some good sports for photos of the blue city!   I think paying for a tour guide is worth it but it was a little difficult to find…
84,Impressive Fortress,"The buildings, fort and history connected to this place is totally worth a visit. It’s worth noting it says it’s free in the Lonely Planet but this is just for the forecourt area you need to purchase a r600 ticket which comes with a audio guide which is defiantly worth and…"

95,Truly the largest.,"I will not go to the historical part of this magnificent structure as plenty is available about the fort in the web world. One must visit the fort to appreciate its sheer grandeur & architectural splendour. Built in the year 1459, the three tier entrance gates of fort were designed with sharp 90 degree short turns to make it impregnable.The museum is well maintained for the visitors to appreciate glory of the bygone era. The fort is illuminated at night till 9pm."

101,Shown place for weddings,This was my second visit to Mehrangarh Fort after I had first visited in 2013. I had mentioned in earlier review as well that this must be one of the best maintained forts in the country. With elevator you can reach at the main level from where there are museums and galleries…
102,Sight of magnificence...,Whilst India has scores of forts to visit this one in my view is one of the best. It is imposing and stands 125 metres tall. The audio tour is well worth the cost as it takes one through the history at 33 spots along the way. There is a range of well decorated rooms and museums…
103,Impressive dort,I was expecting this fort be really nice but it was disappointment. There is nothing special about this fort. Agra fort or fatehpur sikri or any other fort in Rajasthan is far better than this. I would rather visit Jaswant Thada Or jodha desert park. Entry fee is Rs. 50 per adult. Parking is availabile.
104,Good Place for history lover,This is a terrific fort to visit. The audio tour is very good and the whole place is well organised and laid out. The carving and lattice work is impressive and the museum artifacts serve as a great history. This is a definite for anyone in Jodhpur. Tour can be done without a guide just use the audio tour.
105,RJ TRAVELS8,"Overlooking Jodhpur, this Fort is a monumental, impressive structure. Expansive and magnificent, this was one of the more impressive Forts I’ve seen in India, surpasses, perhaps, by only the Fort in Agra."
106,Very beautiful and fascinating architecture,This place is surprising. The interiors are magnificent and the views of the fortifications and wall made it well worth the trip. 
107,Excellent upkeep,"Loved the experience. Good view of the Blue City. It is Huge and well maintained. Best time to visit is between October to February. Knowing its history is interesting. The Museum is great. Gift shop has variety of collections to keep. Cafeteria. You can spend half a day here, so arriving here by afternoon would be better. Guided tour was helpful. Mr. Lobo guided us through, without missing any important things. Nicely planned. He explained well about the history and have very good knowledge about this place."
108,You must visit,Huge fort with beautiful city views from the top. You can take the lift to the top and walk down. Worth a visit for 2 hours.
109,Do not miss this!,"This magnaninous heritage of Jodhpur mesmerises you with its history, its royalty and magnificent architecture. From the walls of fort you can see entire jodhpur and pseudo aerial.view which breath taking as well  You see life style of kings & queens during those times and get…"
110,Must do in Jodhpur,"This is one of the must visit in Jodhpur if you like historical structures. Entry is chargeable. Parking is available. It is a big impressive palace of Marwar royalty which displays their history and lifestyle in different sections like palanquins, weapons,dresses, etc. From the top, the blue  city can be seen. Cafeteria,shop,toilets, etc.everything is there inside the fort. U cn also do zipline. There is an escalator to take guests to display area, but wld suggest walking instead to get a feel and soak in the grandeur. Hire a guide or audio guide or read the boards about various displays. Could be very crowded on holidays. Infact, royals are smart enough to make money out of such palaces by displaying their wealth and lifestyle to make more wealth. Need around 3 hours to see the whole palace. Must visit in Jodhpur."
111,Majestic,We visited the fort on 4 Jan 2020. Property is well maintained. It’s very clean. It is advisable to take the elevator for going up and then take the tour of the fort. Food at the restaurant in the fort is over priced. Won’t advice to go for it. Not worth the price.
112,Scenic,"What remains in the mind after visiting Mehrangarh is its astounding high walls on the highest hill in the area...it really towers above everything...but that is not all...it is a well managed place (except the toilets)...it has good collections of artifacts...the Museum shop feels like an extension of the museum itself with the lovely collection it has. The Mehrangarh cafe and the Palki cafe (the latter being lower priced) are both good. The only down side as I wrote earlier were the smelly toilets...my wife was even more unhappy with the ladies' toilet. The place has a very steep gradient so we saw some elderly people struggling on the steep incline and decline, although we did see information on a lift...it said INR 50 per person...although I am not sure but for the persons with disability, it is free and the price is charged from the others"
113,Great historic forte at Jodhpur,"Huge Fort, too much to walk and tiring. But worth the visit. You can see sheesh mahal, moti mahal and phool mahal here."
114,Magnificent Mehrangarh Fort!,"Wonderful palace to explore, has one temple and the roof has lot of canons with a beautiful view of blue city. Do visit the fort and Jaswant thada nearby. One can also experience local musicians with their instrument at the entrance along with shops selling beautiful Rajasthani Artifact."
115,Good for half day,"The Mehrangarh fort just mesmerized us..we just visit the fort twice during our stay at Jodhpur,,To start with..the access to fort from our Hotel is through Fateh Pol..a less crowded entry..we avail Audio guide for the fort..very well sequentially narrative to guide of entire fort with all history..The royal Architectures..the Collections and rooms are really overwhelming experience..The added attraction of the great view of the Blue city Jodhpur and great sunrise from fort..This is the best fort of all till today I have visited over India.."
116,MEHRANGARH FORT,"I found it a must visit in Jodhpur. Fort is still in good shape. IF you are in India, you will find that most of the forts have been destroyed by Britishers / Britishers. Many films have been shoot in this fort."
117,Beautiful fort ,"I find both the Amber Fort in Jaipur and this palace equally impressive but for different reasons. Whilst the Amber Fort is large, in all proportions, this palace has smaller proportioned living/entertaining areas but the sheer size and height of the walls and it’s layout really are something else.Built in 1459 it’s built on a 125m high hill and uses every bit of its position to dominate the landscape. If possible I’d suggest that you walk up through the series of gates to gain access to the main part of the complex but for those who might find this something of a challenge there is a lift (for an extra charge).It’s an impressive Rajasthan structure but the rooms are surprisingly ‘human sized’. (Curious Fact: Swings were an entertainment for those in power.)The shop there is also worth a visit and represents pretty good value (containing all sorts of offerings from Jodhpur Flying polo shirts at IRS1300 to Christmas decorations at IRS250). However the painter near the cash desk has an unusual take on salesmanship demanding why you aren’t buying his works of art whilst you queue up to pay.Overall a great place to visit. Allow plenty of time."
118,A modern fort,"A must-visit while in Jodhpur - this and Jaswant Thada, which is much smaller. Pro tip: the guys in the main courtyard will do a free turban tying demonstration which is fun to watch and photograph. Pro tip 2: there's a beautiful temple which you can visit for a moment of…"
119,Mehrangarh family trip,"I would say that this is the #1 attraction that you should visit while touring JodhpurAccess: 1) Easily accessible - road goes directly to the entrance of the fort (Unlike Udaipur City Palace that requires a little walk to get to the entrance from the parking area, though they offer golf carts at a price)2) They charge an entry fee and a portion of the proceeds go towards the well maintenance of the fort. If you are visiting for the first time, I recommend a guide Fort: 1) It is a massive palace/fort, very impressive and is extremely well maintained (compared to the Goldent Fort of Raisalmer or even the City Palace of Udaipur)2) The tour will go over three main levels of the fort/museum that provide visitors a sneak peak into Marwar Royal life-style; you also get a beautiful view of the Blue City from the topServices: 1) There is a cafe, a restaurant, restrooms at various places and multiple shops inside the fort (Again, I have not seen cafe/restaurants inside other forts in Udaipur or Jaisalmer) - gives visitors opportunities to spend a little extra time exploring the museum and exhibits2) The tour starts at the top and that requires walking/climbing stairs. However, they do have an elevator (at a fee of INR 100) option - that gets you directly to the starting point of the tour.  Our guide informed us that this is only fort in Rajasthan that offers the elevator facility! Other notes: 1) Just like all forts in Rajasthan, can get crowded on weekends and holidays. We visited the fort on Jan 1st - it was fairly crowded. 2) I suggest allocating a good half-a-day ( 3 to 5 hours) for visiting this fort so that you can get a good overall expereince.  Must see in Jodhpur! Strongly recommended!!"
120,History & Culture at One Place,The fort is very well managed in terms of security and cleanliness. The audio guide tour is very interesting as it gives detailed description of the fort and the antiques kept in the museum.  If you are not willing to walk all the way to the hill top but at the same time you…
121,Mehrangarh !! Must Visit Attraction,"I liked this fort very much, really it was very beautiful and grand fort.You can go by lift also,they charge fifty rupees per person, they drop you at top of the fort, from where you can come down to see the fort.One should hire a guide to understand the history of the fort but…"
122,Very impressive,It is a great fort. Looks imposing from all side. Too crowded during the early time and closing time. You may visit the same during the lunch time where the queue for the elevator is less. Elevator costs Rs. 50 per person. It is only for going up. 
123,Yest another beautiful fort,Easily one of the best forts in country. Very well maintained. But going there without guide is criminal. Lighting in night is breathtaking. Sitting in terrace restaurant and enjoying Rajasthani hospitality was unique experience.
124,Fantastic fort with so much to see,Must to visit that fort but without guide it is of no use. Only for people who really want to know history.
125,Beautiful and well maintained fort,Amazing Fort and history. Audio guide is very good. Views around are great. Lots of stairs and steep ramps in case a issue

128,Amazing trip to India,It was a wonderful experience exploring the fort. It's museum and artefacts. Good historical place to remember. The architecture of the fort and it's structure is simply awesome and adorable. It reminds us of the art prevalent during that period of the kings.
129,Fantastic place,"One huge fort, with history speaking in each and every corner of the place. A must visit if you are in Jodhpur and the fort provides a breathtaking view of the city."
130,Well maintained Fort with great views for photography ,Amazing fort with beautiful views and well worth a visit inside and out .As you exit the fort at the back you arrive into the blue city which is quite beautiful.Really worth walking around the old town even if it’s a bit dirty.
131,Beautiful and Family Friendly,"Absolutly do not miss a visit to Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur. The foundation of the fort was started in 1459, quite how they built it I don't know is a mighty construction, the drive to it is impressive and gives a flavour of what is to come. We had an audio guide which I would recommend, this is very informative and you learn so much. We saw many forts on our tour of Rajastan and I think that for me this is one of the most imressive. I would allow a good 2-3 hours perhaps even longer if you can. There are various cafe and restaurants to get refreshments and gift shop as well."
132,Imposing Edifice,It is such beautiful fort ..and very huge property.. but guides are available and they do their job well!! Very well maintained .. we loved visiting this place .. must visit!!
133,Get there early,"This huge Fort is an Architectural marvel, dating back to several centuries. Many of the memories of the bygone era are well show cased and preserved. Must see place."
134,Excellent place to visit,We loved our visit to Mehrangarh Fort. It was spectacular. The best of all the forts we visited. We took the audio guide and it was worth having. We spent a few hours in the Fort and the interior and exhibits were the best we have seen. The views over the city were amazing and the staff were also friendly and helpful.
135,Best Fort in India,Many Bollywood movie's have been here . Once you start your tour you realize having seen many parts of the Fort in various movie's . There are various cafe's and souvenir shops inside the fort. You can even do zip lining @ 2000/- per person here .It takes approx 2 hour's to see…
136,Historic ,Large fort built about 1459 on a mountain bluff. by Rao Jodha of the Jodhpur Royal Family. Lots of amazingly beautiful intricate stone carvings and architecture. Pat of India's rich heritage.
137,Brilliant,Amazing fort and beautifully maintained by the current Maharajah of Jodhpur. Take your time and notice the exquisite detail in the stonework and other artefacts.
138,Worth a visit,"The Fort is a ""must see"". Fantastic. Massive. Majestic. There is an elevator which is a blessing for senior citizens.  The upper floors in the Palace are not to be missed as they have rooms which are amazingly beautiful. Recommend to avail a guide. Rates are fixed and receipts…"
139,Must Visit Fort when you're in/around Jodhpur,"My experience of visiting Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur Rajasthan was awesome. I went with my father, mother, wife and elder son.The hill where the Mehrangarh Fort is situated is called Bhaurcheeria. It means the mountain of birds.Rao Jodha, the chief of Rathore clan of Rajputs…"
140,Amazing Edifice!!,Not much to see only  living and bedrooms of kings..Good gatherings of tourists on Sunday Good music available calm place to enjoy you day and feel the heritage the golden era of the Rajasthan
141,Must visit place.,"The fort occupies the entire top of the cliff towering above the city. On the territory of the fort are museum exhibits and temples, chipmunks frolic, and of course there are excellent views of the city."
142,Visit to Mehrangarh Fort,The fort is free and worth the visit. The museum has a small charge and was very interesting. There are many rooms of the maharaja completely furnished. This is the best palace museum we have visited in India (of many). Money and taste have been deployed well. There is a massive museum shop with beautiful reproductions available. An extension of the museum for the jewellery. Access the fort through the main entrance a 300m walk up steps from below for great views. But leave by the back entrance which allows you to stroll in the gardens and pause for a cold beer and lunch in the fort before the gate. The path is cordoned off with a guard. Say you're  going to the restaurant and he'll wave you through. It's also the way to the zip wire run by flying fox. An amazing experience if 1.4km zip wire in six sections across battlements and lakes. Safe and well run.
143,Must go to the top,"The forth is looking so beautiful and nice, place is clean ,Fort is big,architecture of fort it so nice."
144,Must visit in Jodhpur,Very historical.need 3 hours to see whole place. Amazing collections  Need 3 hours to do justice to see everything Even akbars sword is displayed 
145,Jodhpur’s royal pride,Fort so popular but not tourist friendly .. Extensive walking if you want to see full or else limit through one life in operation with so many tourists. Not a right place for elderly since nothing exciting to be seen
146,Must Do in Jodhpur,"If you only have a few hours in Johdpur this is the place to visit.  The climb is easy and gets more interesting as you reach the amazing fort.  The size, architecture and great condition of this landmark is hard to comprehend. "
147,Magical! ,Very nice and impressive fort. Really worth a visit. Museum very nice and good view of the surroundings
148,Excellent,"Fantastic visit guided by the audiobook, which was very informative. It is quite extraordinary how this fort is constructed our of the hill."
149,Go early to avoid crowd,If you love history or even if you don’t the mehrangarh fort is a must visit. It looks different from outside and inside is completely different story. It’s a big place so need atleast 2hours to see the fort properly. I would suggest hiring a guide to know certain historic details which they  know better.
150,Jodhpur's landmark and unarguably so,"Long queue to get in to the fort, but absolute worth it. Breathtaking historical significance and incredible views across Jodhpur. One way in and one way out routes. Crafts inside is interesting and the souvenir shop a bit pricy, but otherwise a brilliant experience "
151,A grand monument,"Really big fort- it costs 600 ruppees to get in, comes with free audio guide which is very very good. Around 2-3 hours long very intreating and well kept. Worth it "
152,Audio Tour Disgracefully Minimizes Barbaric Practice of SATI,A top a mountain and visible from almost every part of the city. They have a lift facility at a cost. Once you enter the museum and move across every level and room at the end you will have options to buy souvenirs which are reasonable compared to most souvenir shops.
153,Well maintained and huge fort,"Founded in 1459AD the Fort is breathtakingly stunning. It houses a museum, Arms, Costumes, Paintings, Elephant Howda’s, Palanquins, and the most stunning architecture from the medieval period of Indian history. 600 rupees entry, includes audio guide. If visiting Jodhpur this is…"
154,One of the best maintained forts of the country,"We visited quite a number of forts, palaces, and other monuments on our trip to India but the fort in Jodhpur is truly stunning. The scale is huge but the intricacy and delicacy of much of the building is amazing. And it affords wonderful views over the Blue City."
155,Jewel of rajasthan ,Had been here with family n friends and really happy to spend my time exploring this beautiful and huge architectural historical fort. It is spread in a huge area and one needs atleat 3-4 hours to completely and deeply seeing the fort. the Architecture is marvellous and well…
156,Fantastic Fort! ,Fort Mehrangarh is beautiful place .. lovely location..Very well maintained by the trust..uniformed n well trained staff..humble n Cooperative too..small n lovely shopping too..amazing cafe..impressed to see the maintenance..
157,Beautiful fort. Worth visiting ,"The Blue City is all about this fort! It’s on top of the city so wherever you staying, whether in the heart of the city or farther away in Umaid Bhawan Palace, you get to see the fort.  Getting to it, it’s better to reach by a car or a tuk tuk rather than walking as it’s a bit…"
158,Excellent,We visited this fort on our first day of arrival in Jodhpur. Our guide Mr Hari Lal ji was well informed and took us around. The museum is well kept and maintained extremely well.
159,DO NOT MISS THIS,"For those that appreciate history and architecture, Mehrangarh should satisfy that for you. Huge and majestic, a leisurely stroll with the audio tour, stopping for photography and a wander through the museum will take a good 2-3 hours. Comfortable shoes are a good idea. The Fort is well-maintained and offers excellent views of Jodphur. If visiting in the morning, drop by the nearby Jaswant Thada for good morning light."
160,Trip of Rajasthan,I never tire of visiting Forts in India and this one was superb - the perfect view down into the old city (and the blue that gives Jodhpur its title of the Blue City).  There was so much to see with every section getting more and more Wow!  Don't miss this when you are in Jodhpur!
161,Dr.,"What fabulous views from the fortress over the blue city, our guide explained that the blue houses are the Sect or people that used to work in the temples, priests etc. The fortress palace is amazing, beautiful condition, with a wealth of history, it’s best to employ a local…"
162,Amazing place ,"The fort was amazing and really historical. One of the best views of the Blue City. I really enjoyed it and gave a great scope of the city. When I was walking down, I met a really nice guide by name of Ritesh. He just started guiding and is trying to gain experience. He showed me the local areas that I saw from the fort but now I was able to see them up close. Took great photos and was a good way to see the area around the fort! A very fair rate was well. The fort was amazing, one of the best things on my trip. And if you’re interested in a guide for the local parts of the blue city, I can recommend Ritesh. His phone number/whats app is +91 7976202392"
163,Amazing architecture,"We have visited a number of forts in India during our travels and this fortress is by far the most incredible. The fort rises 500 feet above the city of Jodhpur on a very prominent headland.It was truly amazing how thick the forts walls were - 50 feet in some places. It is one of the largest forts in all of India and has been extremely well maintained over the years. Inside the fort you will find a myriad of intricate carvings and the museum contains beautiful paintings, battle armour as well as numerous royal palanquins used to carry royalty. Many locals say that the fort is one of the 7 wonders of India."
164,"Incredible visit at Mehrangarh Fort and Museum Shop, complete with purchase of gorgeous silk kurta/tunic!",It was very nice fort.we loved each moment here.The fort was still strong building.We can't explain in writing.You must see the fort in lifetime.
165,The Majestic Meharangarh,"Very nice place,   From the entrance you can see the entire ""Blue City"" .The history, art work and the decor is well preserved. We were able to see entire fort without guide, self explanatory."
166,Royal experience in Mehrangarh Fort.,The best and most well maintained fort I have visited till date in all of India. Do spare at least 3-4 hours for this Fort. Buy an audio guide which covers 33 points. 
167,Nice,Fort was too old but still in well maintained condition. Good place for those who love history. We have enjoyed our trip.
168,Leisure,Truly sight of magnificence. Wonderful tour of Royal Heritage. Adorable. Audio guide facility provided is highly recommended. Flying Fox - Zip Line is add on attraction.
169,Hum sath sath hain ,A very interesting place to visit with great views of Blue City. Architecture was stunning highly recommend 
170,Riding the stairs of history,Great views overlooking the blue city of Jodhpur. Well worth a look around for a morning. There is even an elevator for those with limited accessibility.
171,500 years of history and marvel ,Best fort amongst all others that I have been to. The first fort I came across that has a elevator. The fort has many paintings which are 400 years old made of gold & still shine bright.  Not to crowded as compared to City Palace Udaipur. Also entry tickets are way cheaper than…
172,beautiful architecture,One of the beautiful forts with a really rich history. Better to reach early and take a guide for the little details.  The handicraft shop towards the end is a decent one 
173,Holiday ,"You really do need to visit the fort if you’re in Jodhpur.  It has so much history and the views are fantastic.  You don’t need a guide, but it is well worth paying a little more to get the audio guide.  We thought it was one of the best we’ve heard."
174,Beautiful ornate fort ,Must visit place in Jodhpur... Spend minimum 3-4 hours... Visit in morning around 9.00 am ... one can see the panoramic view of the Jodhpur city from this fort...
175,Mighty Mehrangarh.,Another intricate and well decorated fort. Awesome views from the top across the city. It was quite busy when we were there so being early to beat the crowds and heat is a good thing. Some very nice displays.
176,Mehrangarh Fort - Majestic Symbol of might,Visited with friends in Jan 2020. Enough parking place just 50 meters away. Had our morning breakfast in one of the cafe at the basement and bit costly and the taste is not so great. Better to have a breakfast elsewhere if time permits.Availed Guide service and paid the elevator fee to reach upstairs quickly.Fort has collection of materials from Royal family and one of the few forts in Rajasthan where it is worth to visit.
177,As majestic as its name!!,Great place to visit. There are some beautiful rooms and exhibits plus the building is in excellent condition. It costs INR50 to use the lift up but walk down it's probably worth it. You can take photos almost everywhere and for INR100 They will show you how they tie their…
178,"Majestic, magificent architeture and opulence of kings","The fort walls are made from the rock on which it stands.Entrance to the fort is free, there is a fee for the museum.  You enter near the old city.Make sure you do not miss out on the panoramic ramparts and antique artillery. I feel that a visit to the connecting museum is a must do."
179,great,Must have your guide to get maximum valueNew elevator for fee helps accessRajasthan history displayed with appropriate prideMarvelous creations by past kingsThey certainly liked their liked their women folksWarring culture prevalent for defense and for kingdom fortunesThese days the first is part of a trust foundation that dedicates revenue for maintenance and operation with charity acts also part of the ethicGreat photo ops.Views spectacular from topEngineering marvelSimply fantastic
180,One word- SUPERB!!!,"You can get the the fort either by car or elephant our travel agent would not book the elephants and I am so glad we took the car. These magnificent animals are worked so hard in extreme heat, I know they need to make a living but it's awful to see these animals suffering so…"
181,Once visit,"Before we came here, we had already visited Agra fort, and the Amber fort in Jaipur, so I thought I'd be a bit tired of forts. Mehrangarh fort really impressed me though.The main reason why this fort stood out above the others is the audio guide. At other sites you have to haggle for a guide and be stuck with them for your visit, so we declined that and therefore missed out on hearing all the history and interesting stories. This audio guide - in several languages - allows you to walk around at leisure and brings to life the incredible tales of war, palace life and Rajasthani culture. This was the first site in India where I felt a connection to the place. What's more, whereas Agra fort and Amber fort are just empty - albeit beautiful - ruins, Mehrangarh doubles as a museum, with art and historical artefacts to look at, as well as information about what you're looking at. Other famous sites in India could learn from Mehrangarh's approach and become more engaging for visitors.PS you must explore the ramparts, go down to the temple at the end and sit on the floor to look through the slits in the wall. It's the best view of the blue city in all of Jodhpur."
182,Amazing Architecture and Collection,Loved the view from up there. The Jain temples are just too good. History in its full glory. Nice shopping ideas too.
183,Marvelous,Very well preserved fort with much to see - even if you have seen other forts. The audio guide was wonderful. Easy to follow and understand. Highly recommended. It is also free. If you see something you like in the museam shop - go for it. They look to be good quality. Prices are reasonable.
184,Feeling Royal,The fort is built with utmost precision and detailing. The fort is well maintained and we can see and explore history..Best for family visit..
185,a must visit place,The fort is well maintained and the museum is worth seeing. Our local guide Sandip Singh was most helpful. 
186,Majestic ,"The imposing Mehrangarh Fort, built in 1459 of burnished red sandstone, often called the ""Citadel of the Sun"", and it's acknowledged as one of the best preserved forts in all of India. It has an amazing views of the city. it felt peculiar walking from one building to another, as…"
187,"Not to be missed in Jodhpur, but also worth making time for if in Rajasthan.",Excellent museum which is well laid out. Impressive buildings and original decorations in a number of rooms. Great view across the blue city. Well worth a visit
188,A heritage property now reduced to commercial property,We went here with family comprising of senior citizens and kids! So we needed activities to cover all. The fort is resplendent in its past and present glory. It is very well maintained. Best part it has a lift service to help senior citizens enjoy some part of the fort! Never…
189,Tourism ,One of the best forts I have visited. Its truly majestic. Will need 2-3 hrs to cover the fort. Hire a guide approx ₹.200-250. The fort has multiple levels and had an amazing view of the city. Do plan to take the nature trail that is part of the rock garden to get an amazing view of the fort from outside.
190,Most beautiful fort in india,This place is absolutely amazing - on a par with the Amber Fort but with fewer people and none of the irritatingly persistent street sellers . Both the fort itself and all the items on display are extraordinary . It is one of the highlights of our trip.
191,Do the fort with the audio guide,The fort is well maintained and well equipped with staff. There is also a lift available to go to the top for those who can't walk long. One must book a guide for detail understanding of the fort. They also have a zip line for the adventurous ones.
192,Beautiful Historic Mehrangarh Fort,"The fort itself is free - the museum (=inside of the palace) is not , but price ticket includes a very well made audioguide. This is one of the most beautiful I have seen, very well preserved and clean. It can be a bit crowded so try to go early in the morning. Furthermore, it…"
193,Was expecting more,"Meharangarh Fort will take around two hours to complete the visit. Make your visit technology enabled. Take a audio guided tour. It's lovely to move around with the audio guide, don't forget to carry your earphones."
194,Best fort in India,"This is an impressive fortress built on a hill overlooking the city. When inside (it is worth taking the elevator to the top then walk down the various levels) visit the various royal chambers and view the magnificent artifacts on display. Oh, and at the top enjoy the views of the ""blue"" city below. This attraction is an absolute must when visiting Jodhpur."
195,"Awesome, very helpful staff","Allow 2-3 hours for the fort as there is a lot to see, including magnificent views of the city and city wall from on top, to numerous artefacts, rooms and architectural delights."

197,Royal Fortress.,I was amazed to find the Mehrangarh Fort at par with international standards in terms of facilities provided. They provide an audio guide in different languages. The artefacts have been aesthetically preserved and in-depth explanations are provided for everything. You get a glimpse of Rajasthani culture and heritage through this Fort and a spectacular view of the Blue City of Jodhpur. A must visit guys!
198,"wonderful, wonderful ... wonderful",Forts in Rajasthan transform you into another world.  A must-do if you are in Jodhpur.  Shops in the fort have some exclusive stuff.  The cafes are interesting.

200,Historical Marvel ,"There are a lot of forts to see in India, but, along with Jaisalmer, this was my favourite one on our trip. Very impressive and well maintained. Great views over the city and surrounding country. An easy walk round and plenty to see. we went in a downpour and it was still fun…"
201,Artical Fort ,What a structure. Beautiful architecture. Mindblowing view. Tip: Buy the lift ticket and go to the too first. Then come downwards admiring the fort. Needs 2 hours to watch at leisure.
202,Blown away,"Hello friends and my guest Reached Jodhpur on 22nd January 2020.And the next day we visited Mehrangarh Fort.And saw that it is the largest fort in India.My guest was surprised to see.And friends, I wish that you too once came to Jodhpur and see the beauty of Jodhpur.And you too will be surprised to see this fort from inside as well as from outside."
203,Exquisite,"A must see - fascinating insight into the Jodha rajput court culture and history, which ties the Rathore clan to the people and land of Marwar. "
204,Great site,"Visited this fort with family. We hired a guide n it was worth the details he explained us . It does have a lift facility at extra cost ,to take you to the main level. A very well maintained fort by the Present Maharaj of Jodhpur n his team. Worth visiting. "
205,Nice,Spectacular views from the top of the palace. Went for a wedding and setting and scene was breath taking
206,Number one sight,"Awesome ambiance, Priceless collection of valuables and other things of the Royalty. Get an insight of their life, luxuries availed and customs and traditions from the exhibits. Some traditional stuff put on sale to promote artisans were really good."
207,Mehrangarh Fort,The fort is beautiful with plenty of scenic views of the city. Be sure to get there before the crowd hits the fort though as it can get a little crowded and rowdy.
208,A must do ,This fort is magnificent.  I did the self guided tour and not only learnt about the fort but a great deal about Rajasthan.  It is well looked after and has stunning views.  
209,Best time to go around in Winters,"It is outside the city but certainly worth the trip. Astonishing architecture, a very worthwhile Museum, perfect views of the surrounding landscape and the city and a lot of nice little birds. Yes, a lot of walking and a lot of steps but with a good guide a more than interesting…"
210,"A fascinating history, well presented",Don t know how someone would try to enter inside. This place is huge and very fascinous. After the ticket they give you audio guide that gives you a lot of informations.
211,Hang out,"This Fort is stunning in it's Beauty and it's history. In it, one will go through generations of historical eras. The audio that comes with the entry fee is useful though inaccurate because it is biased and personal. Visitors are constantly reminded of the greatness of the…"
212,Well go if you must,Entrance Fee : RS 120/person for IndiansLift : 50 Rs/ Pearson (Take lift and reach the top and then come walking visiting the fort)This fort has many Cafe also....overall good fort to visit but like anyother Rajasthani fort.
213,India trip,"We have visited a few forts and palaces in India (in Jaipur, Delhi, and Udaipur), but this one is by far our favorite. The fort is impressive, as it sits on a hillock above the city. The entrance is a short climb from town (one entrance is near the blue city and the other is in the old city).You can walk around the ramparts and through the gates for free. I highly recommend paying for the museum as well, which comes with a free audio guide that is very well produced. The museum ticket allows you access to the palace itself, including several impressive rooms and courtyards, and some interesting museum displays as well. The displays are well explained with signage in English and Hindu. Overall, everything here is explained, maintained, and restored with great pride and is well worth the visit."
214,Whole city,"I was visiting Fort, after a period of 20+ years. Ensure to be dropped off, right at the entrance / ticket counter.There is a tendency by drivers to drop off at the lower parking lot this increases the walk time/duration esp walk on dust/loose mud.A lot has changed, esp with barricades as there are numerous points, now not part of the visit.Perhaps due to some past incidents or due to maint issues wrt trust/mgmt.Get there early, as all tourist guides were hired up and en route visit.We were left with no option, but to opt for Audio Guide device.Winter months, sees a lot of crowd esp on weekends and on long holidays, so plan accordingly."
215,Good place,"Great place, excellent facilities including a lift if one wishes to avoid the steep climb, great view of the city"
216,journey back in time...,We enjoyed the scenery and beautiful buildings. It wasn’t too crowded. Was glad for the lift ticket for my mum who has knee issues.
217,Beautiful fort,"Jodhpur is a city in the Thar Desert of the northwest Indian state of Rajasthan. Its 15th-century Mehrangarh Fort is a former palace that’s now a museum, displaying weapons, paintings and elaborate royal palanquins (sedan chairs). Set on on a rocky and more. Before this fort, I visited other forts like Amber Fort,Jaisalmer Fort as part of my Rajasthan tour. But,in this fort, one thing was very disappointed me that separate tickets for climbing the fort and for elevator in addition to the entry ticket as the elevator shouldn't be charged and it should be provided for ease of climbing/reaching of tourists like old age and children. And other thing , selfie stick usage charges are also there as camera/mobile phone is free, I don't understand why thhi discrimination exists. The fort guide charges are also too expensive starting form RS 500/- which won't be affordable for lower middle class people, Govt must consider about the same and offer previlages to visit these ancient forts for memorising our fore Heroes... The Fort converted Museum is really  a must visit place as part of Rajasthan Trip to witness and remembering the past and ancient times art, sculpture,palki,arms used etc"
218,Historic and Classic,"We are having an amazing trip through Northern India. One of the highlights is the tour provided by Dr. Jeetender Singh Kamsot in Jodhpur. His deep knowledge of Indian history and culture, fun personality and attention to every need of the traveler is admirable. Thank you very much, Susan and Dmitry"
219,Amazing ,Must visit place for those who are close to history and want to enjoy the efforts put in by our great warriors in building the fort.
220,Worth the walk ,"Very relaxed visit to the main fort just after 9am, not many people up and about at that time.Well worth the 500 rupees entry fee plus 50 for the elevator ride to the top level. If you are young and fit the walk isn't bad.Plenty of things to see here from the Maharajas collection plus a view across to the 'blue city'."
221,Beautiful and impressive,"A towering and very imposing fortress top of a hill. We had a guide to understand and appreciate this massive structure. A word of warning, there is a steep climb, but there is a hidden lift if required. The building itself is impressive as are many of the exhibits inside. From…"
222,An epic Fort on a hill,Really enjoyed our visit to the Fort. Beautiful to look at on the inside and out.Audio tour was very informative as well.
223,"Amazing fort, must do","You get a good view of the blue city. The history is interesting. There is only one lift though, which results in long queues. Try opting for a guide for the best experience. "
224,My favourite spot in my tour of Rajasthan,Time stands still when you walk through this fort and feel the history these walls have witnessed. It's an absolute must visit for anyone!  Take a guided tour if you really want a complete experience of the place and delve deeper into its History.
225,Amazing fort and Tour Guide,"an absoloute must do when in jodhpur, take a slow stroll arpund this place, you get amazing views in so many locations, offers wonderful views of the blue city."
226,Excellent - must have a guide,"A fantastic fort which has been well restored. Palaces of various ages, some of which contain interesting museum items including miniature paintings and howdahs. "
227,Magnificent fort,"The Architecture at its best. The view, the vibe, the history everything is so amazing here. there are two ways to reach there one by the walk and the one with elevator there are tickets for visiting it, There are also shops and cafes in it too. And from the top of the fort you can enjoy the blue view, must visit in jodhpur"
228,Royal Experience,It was indeed a treat to visit this place since I am very fond of history. Very well maintained. We had booked a tour guide and also bought that tickets of elevator. It saved lot of our time. Elevator charge is Rs 50 per head one way. One can walk down very easily from the top of the fort!!! The view of the blue city from the top is breathtaking!!! One can also enjoy zip line which we avoided due to lack of time. Three eateries are there in fort it self where you can have light snacks to proper meals !!!
229,Visit to Jodhpur,Visited as part of our India tour . The building is as impressive on the inside as it is on the outside . Beautiful rooms and colours and easy to spend a couple of hours exploring
230,Truly beautiful historic fort,Nice tour of the fort. If you can walk uphill for 10 minutes would suggest to skip the elevator especially when it's crowded. The wait time for the elevator can be more than the time if you prefer to walk. Don't miss the top of the fort where you get to see all old cannons and amazing view of the blue city. There was also a temple at the end but I didn't venture in. If you go there in the evening don't miss the sunset from the fort.
231,Imposing Fort of Jodhpur,I attended a wedding function at this site on the roof. Maintenance is poor. Service of food & drinks are arranged by the owners (Taj Ummed Hotel). The quality is awfully poor. The crew and dancer girls poorly dressed right from door to roof floor service area in the name of…
232,Worth it,"This is a place that we have read about in a hundred novels, a walled fortress, intricate craftsmanship, awesome stone architecture and history comes alive as you walk through the rooms."
233,Great place to visit,Easiest fortress to get to! You can walk up through the blue city up there. Better in the afternoon as you’d get a better view of the city 
234,Mehrangarh Fort,"While walking about,  it brings you back in time. Makes you wonder how magnificent structures were constructed without the technology that we have today.  Amazing view of the Blue City from back side of fort."
235,Amazing architecture ,Set high up on a hill with lots of history packed into it. Would definitely recommend hiring a guide as it’s hard to understand all the history without one
236,Imposing Fort,This was part of our Jodhpur visit over the new year. We were a little skeptical on the 1st day of visit- since it was immediately after our visit to Umaid Bhavan Palace. We took a very good decision of taking the guide- Mr. Vikram Singh Rathore- a very knowledgeable person and…
237,Should watch as this is one of the main spots in Jodhpur.,Minimum time required 3 hours . Rs 30 per person and take lift ticket for one side rs 50 per head and return you can walk and enjoy the beauty . Very big fort .
238,Beautiful,I’m a photographer. Not one for museums much but I didn’t mind these ones because the views and the architecture and the photogenic surroundings were amazing. We were there on a cooler day and it was perfect.
239,Must see!!,"What I liked -  1. The audio guide was really good 2. Fort is well maintained  3. View of the blue city from the top is good  What I didn’t like so much - 1. The path to follow wasn’t always very clear. There were guards to direct people but with too many visitors, that’s not…"
240,Magnificent Mehrangarh,"The most beautiful Palace I have ever seen. It is so big, there isn't a whole lot inside, but the outside views are incredible. Don't be rushed, go early and get the composite ticket and do all the rest of the 8 things on the ticket. There are a few hawkers up the stairs so just keep your head down and get to the top. Really fun exploring how big it was."
241,Breathtaking Fort,"From looking in Lonely Planet guidebook and online, I was under the impression that the fort was free to visit aside from the Museum which cost 600Rs and was open 9-5. I got to Fateh Pol (the quieter entrance gate) at 8.30am but was told I couldn't enter the fort grounds at all…"
242,A wonderful fort and very well maintained.,"This palace seems plain from the outside, but has many spectacular rooms, and museum quality displays to visit.highly recommended for a visit. We saw a turban rolling demonstration and also a musical interlude with a zither player."
243,Fantastic views of Jodhpur ,"So many forts in one country, but this one is definitely worth seeing.  It’s a good workout too as the internal roads are steep! There is a lift but you miss 3 stops on the audio guide too ( this is very good and complimentary with your entry fee (ca €8) Do the zip lining too!…"
244,Amazing fort with a breathtaking view!!!,"This huge fortress and palace, perched on top of a high rocky cliff, will astonish you with its history and beautiful royal chambers. There is an excellent audio guide, or live ones if you prefer. You may also encounter traditional musicians and elaborately dressed guards.…"
245,Good fort to Visit,"The audio guide is excellent. The tour is planned beautifully, very exciting for young children as well"
246,Amazing experience ,Good place to visit Make sure you take I'd as we didn't and were not able to use free information headsets Bit overpriced 
247,Amazing Fort plus Blue City views and walk!,A beautiful clean museum. We had a guided tour which was informative and really insightful.  Would definitely recommend.  The views around  the museum are stunning so remember your camera
248,Excellent monument and very well maintained,"You do tend to get forted-out in Rajasthan and after a few the memories tend to merge into one.  At Meherangarh we saw more intricately carved stonework.  Most impressive was the gallery displaying historic miniature paintings for which the state, and city, are famous.  The…"
249,Fantastic ,"I was speechless much of the time I was there! The overwhelming grandeur and beauty of the place leaves you just marvelling at how they built it for one thing! The audio tour is excellent, the myriad of attendants were very friendly and helpful, the courtyard cafe was good value and welcome after 3 hours wandering round! I would definitely allow a good two hours for the tour and if you like taking photos, a power bank and three hours is necessary! It's the most spectacular place I've ever seen and unmissable on a tour of Rajahstan."
250,Magnificent fort,"Spectacular! Mind blowing, to see a perfectly preserved fortified palace like this was just amazing. The entry fee includes an audio tour that was informative and provided a glimpse of what life must have been like here. The views are stunning from the top, 2 hours very well spent."
251,Of course - you have to go there!,The city view is breathtaking and don't forget to take the lift if climbing is difficult. It takes at least two and half hours to complete this visit and add more if you intend to shop inside.
252,One of the most well maintained forts of India.,"The fort grandeur made our jaws drop for the second time. Frescoes along the walls catch our attention. From the fort, we see the panoramic view of Jodhpur. It seems a blue carpet is laid at the foot of a hill.  The fort is rightly called the Citadel of the Sun. Much has been…"
253,Spectacular royal palace!,I just love this place. This is my second visit and I can see that there have been many improvements for safety and access. This is one of my favourite (of the many) forts in India . Mehrangarh should be on everyones list for an Indian visit. No pests and hawkers as with other…
254,Historical gem,Esthetically maintained amicably arranged guided tour made us spellbound. We visited the fort on 30th Jan 2019.
255,Mehrangarh Fort,"This is a must-see!  It is a spectacular palace, with displays of furniture, art - and gardens.  The detailing, and beauty, are amazing.  One of the Great Walls of India there has tremendous size and detailing - much more elaborate than the Great Wall of China.There is a very large, elegant gift shop inside the Mehrangarh Fort, with a wide range of beautiful clothing, dinner table items, books, jewelry, etc. - at reasonable prices. (It is far better than shopping on the narrow streets in town, with small, often broken roads and no sidewalks, and dangerous traffic.)It will take at least two hours for the visit to this amazing Fort and Palace.Don't miss it!"
256,Not to be missed,Another Fort for sure.  You pay the entrance fee and you have the audio for the tour. But it has been renovated and it's clean. They also added some art around the fort.  We spent few hours. 
257,Well maintained fort,Must visit. It's gorgeous and the view is breathtaking. Please do allocate at least 2 - 2.5 hours for your visit.  Also please wear shoes - there's a lot of ground to cover.
258,Beautiful fort,The royalty of this place...the infrastructure....the artwork is going to mesmerise you. Not enough before you realise it’s the best of forts and palaces across Country. The fort back road is full of traffic jam but there’s parking available so the cars could be taken uphill half way. Another route is from Brahampuri padamsar....you could walk the huge 7 gates or Paaul as said in marwadi...The palace is right inside the fort and next up is temple...avoid to go on peak days of temple offering...You can carry your food and water bottles inside and spend one full day...Early trailing is the best time...You can easily see the whole city in blue wash from top of fort enroute temple...There is jail from back old era and the stories do talk about several hidden surang or underground routes...well we had strong connection due to this being our native town !
259,Use the audio guide option ...,"The Fort is worth a visit; However we were horrified by the fact that the Audio Tour minimized the barbaric practice of Sati, suggesting that it was an honorable and spiritual act voluntarily carried out by devoted widows of the rulers.  Nothing is further from the truth!!  The…"
260,Fascinating insight into Jodha rajput court culture,"Just when you think you’ve seen enough forts comes this place, which is just different enough to hold your interest. A small but steep climb is involved but you can purchase a ride. Audio guides available. Food available on site. Heads up ladies: squat toilets and no toilet paper."
261,"An amazing, beautifully maintained fort and palace","Allow at least a couple of hours to explore the fort, there is an informative museum which you could spend two hours in by itself, there a few cafes dotted around to get a drink as well as a bazaar if you want to pick up a souvenir. The fort itself is enormous, you can pick up…"
262,Mehrangarh fort,"I cannot possibly add on to what others have already written. Just that best to go early before crowds come in, take the lift to go up and walk the way down. Washrooms are the cleanest in all of India. The museum shop does have some very affordable items. Best to buy here, coz…"
263,Must see in Jodhpur,Visited last December. We took a cab with a driver.There are two parking lots .One at the top of the hill next to the gate and the other one way down.I think if the top lot gets full then you need to park down and walk all the way up which is a fair walk .Since one of the members of our group was in a wheel chair  the cops allowed the cabbie to drop us off at the entrance and pick us up from there.I would say this place is partially wheel chair accessible.From the gate it is a cobble stone pathway  all the way to the ticket counter.From there  lifts are available to go to the top. From the top you can have stunning views of the blue city and get to see a small portion of the fort.Beyond that the fort can be explored only on foot and involves lot of walking and climbing stairs .I didn't have a guide with me and I really didn't know any of the history but nonetheless  the visit was soo worth it.felt Iike I had a glimpse into the glorious past...There are some small stalls and a cafeteria but I didn't try it out.Restrooms are available and there is also a souvenir shop . Intermittantly I could also hear some musicians performing ..Highly recommend ..
264,Grand Fort!,"Built in 1459, one marvels at the incredible design and architectural feat of building something this massive and imposing so very long ago. Many palaces within and a wonderful museum filled with beautiful royal artifacts that give you a glimpse into their world. Well worth visiting and spending several hours wondering about - with fantastic view of the blue city below."
265,Amazing,We got there early (opens at 9 am) to beat the crowds but others thought the same way. Wasn't a big deal however and didn't seem that busy once inside. Got the audio guide which was very good. Need at least 2 hours maybe a bit longer if you walk to the temple at the other end of…
266,Grandeur of Rajasthan,A beautiful fort... with loads of history.... if you are a history buff then go with enough time and a bottle of water. Fantastic carvings and trellis
267,Great and huge Fort ,"Access to the fort is steep, so not great for anyone with limited mobility, however, if you can manage the walk up, it's well worth seeing. The audio guide is well done, with good 'pacing' from one item to the next. If you are using the audio guide, be sure to do the whole tour.…"
268,Excellently Displayed and curated,"We really enjoyed visiting this fort, there is a fee to enter, and audio as well as guided tours are available. We did not take the tour options and found that all of the rooms had posters with relevant information, and that was good enough for our family. The terrace on top is a must see! This for it had unique displays, the kids and I both enjoyed."
269,Excellent,"We loved this....and all the musicians  - the Blue city, the history, everything....the icing on the cake was the The Mehrangarh Museum Shop - we found some of the BEST gifts and items there.....really a super selection of great work - well sourced all in one store.....and then the market stalls outside....this Fort needs 1/2 day - enjoy the vibes....don't be rushed!"
270,Wonderfull,"an amazing ethereal experience... if you are interested in forts and history, you are sure going to like this place. some people will say it takes 1.5-2 hrs to see the place, but that's only of you are going to scan through. If you want to go at your pace, and soak in the…"
271,At the Centre of the Blue City,"Audio tour is excellent, make sure you carry either a passport or bank card to deposit as security for your headset. Lift available to access fort without climbing steep slope but you will miss some of the audio points. Fantastic history and artefacts within."
272,Center of blue city,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the fort. There is plenty to see and it's fascinating to hear about the history of the place. It is a must see for a visit to Jodhpur.
273,a must visit when in the city!,Go at 10 a.m. in the morning to avoid the crowd which comes @ 9 a.m. it will take you around 2-3 hours to look around the palace. There is a separate ticket for a lift to go up. I suggest you take the lift while going up and walk down while coming back and take a guide to…
274,Excellent experience,"Start with the elevator to the top and come down. We had a tourist guide, but you can rent audio guides and proceed at your own pace.  The objects on display also have legends in English. Allow between 2 to 3 hours for the visit, mostly if you want to see the garments, palanquins, swings and armory collection. You will lose track of all the magnificent courtyards and latticework. The museum shop deserves another half hour; prices here are fixed and the crafts show high quality."
275,A powerful experience ,A single word review should suffice... Lot of ground to cover... U can go with audio guide or a personal guide... At least 3 hours required to enjoy this place... So start your tour with it first thing in the morning...
276,Great monument from a Golden era,I thoroughly enjoyed the opulence and grandeur of this fort. The bedrooms were simply ecstatic and I would to recreate this essence in my dream home.   They audio presentation was informative and last just over an hour.   Entrance was steeper than usual at Rs600  Well worth the…
277,Palatial sparkle,"Complete it in an hour. Take a driver's licence for deposits for the audio guide, cheaper than renting a guide and handing over cash as a deposits. And get your palm read, it's weirdly convincing!"
278,A must visit with a good guide,I am amazed at the preservation of this ancient architecture. The magnificence and meticulous workmanship of the craftsmen.  And creators in the olden days
279,Just wonderful,Upon entry you have a choice to buy an elevator ticket. I would suggest using that to go up and see the fort on your way down by walk. Every room is fascinating - be it the phool mahal or moti mahal. The architecture is breath taking. The enormity of fort in all its grandeur is…
