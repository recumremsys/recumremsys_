0,Fun but be careful,4 of us did a private transfer to this big waterpark from Didim with IMAX tours for a decent price that included the entrance fee.There are no cash payments once inside and you put money on a card to use for any food and drink purchases which you reclaim any balance leftover on leaving. The food and drink is mostly the fast food variety but reasonably priced and a fair quality.The rides are fun but some of the bigger ones are pretty scary and can give you a bit of a battering so be careful if letting children on andthere is a separate area with smaller rides for the little ones with plenty of sunbeds around.
1,Adaland Waterpark. ,Visit adaland! We payed £20 each and got transferred there and entry Food isn't that expensive surprisingly! We had 20TL meal deals which filled is up! The rides are AMAZING like so thrillingThey're super scary some I couldn't even do! I'd recommend the double dingy ones they're fun; be prepared for loads of steps and walking
2,Beware the admission price,"we booked adaland through our rep at a great price transfers were included too! We arrived at 10am and before you know it the day is almost over! Me,my partner,sister,brother in law and friends had the most amazing day here, there was so much going on and endless fun! The slides were amazing and no big queues at all. The swimming pools were clean and there were several pools to chose from. They had a stage where there was entertainment such as party dances and this was great fun for all ages! Food stalls were great and reasonably priced, however to spend money at the park you need to top up a card they give you but if not all spent you get the money back at the end of the day. We also attended the dolphin show (extra price) which was absolutely amazing! Would highly recommend Adaland, perfect for families and small children also!"
3,Fantastic,"We went to Adaland with sea Travel Company on September 6th 2017.The man who had guide people in front of the Dressing room and safety box building was very rude and bad behavior with tourists. He treated with peoples like prisoners.The food and beverages was very expensive, I bought 2 cola and 2 beers 50 lire.In exit time from the park they didn't pay for the deposit money in my charge card because internet was disconnected .or maybe not."
4,Good fun with plenty of rides!,"The whole park is located on top of a mountain. we went thwere with transfer from our hotel and it was a unique experience, the slides were excelent and the staff was nice."
5,Excellent day ,"We arranged this,trip through Jimmy at Kusadassi Tour Company.  Very well organised, bus was on time and park is clean with lots to do.  I'd advise not to do dolphin show, these shows in all the waterparks from Florida to Europe are cruel - the dolphins are kept in tiny tanks and perform only because they're starving.  This is not entertainment so please just use the water park, and don't be party to animal cruelty."
6,Great fun,The  most biggest waterpark in europe.ıt was amazing for us because fun in the sun with friends-adaland aquapark and kusadasi
7,Great day out ,"The waterpark was good and recommended to the families , the food is expensive and doesnt worth , the water dance is very good"
8,August 2020 visit.,"We brought our tickets through our rep at a very reasonable price including transport. It was a great day out, lots to do, great slides for everyone."
9,"Unsafe, rude staff, useless life guards.","for so much fun the price was really fair. in comparison to other water parks in Europe, was even cheap! All types of slides.Every slide has two guard life where you start and where you leave the slide, they take care of your safety very well."
10,Fab little day out,"We visited just the Dolphin park at Adaland in May 2018. We booked the Dolphin Park through the Hotel travel agency and saw the sea lion and dolphin show. Our Children loved the show especially the dolphins. Whilst we were there one of the three dolphins appeared to not want to do as they were told and ignored all instructions, preferring to spin on the stage. This in no way impacted the show and was actually quite funny. After the show we chose to pay the additional €100 each to swim with the dolphins. This lasted about 20minutes but was a great experience. My children went for a ride on the dolphin and we fed, got kisses and stroked the dolphin. A photographer was taking photos which are an additional price we paid €120 for all the photos but they were brilliant. This was a great experience and I would recommend doing this if you are able."
11,Best place to swim with dolphins,"We booked this trip at sundial travel agency on ladies beach. Great value! And the transfer was included. You pay less than if you go directly to the park and pay at the gate. The park is very big with a wide variety of slides. A lot of thrill slides for the older children. The staff was very friendly, the food at the restaurants very affordable. The zumba dancing in the fountains was fun.  You can go rafting as well for an extra 10 lira's per boat. We went to aquafantasy last year but definitely preferred adaland."
12,Amazing and wonderful,"Its very overpriced knowing that Turkish Nationals can pay different rates.  we nearly paid 100 e for a family of 4 which is a bit much in Turkey. you can try to get cheaper tickets from sales agents in town.      some slides didnt open till 1 pm, some queues are very slow- we were waiting for about 40 minutes for one of the biggest slide with a ring-- kidz were freezing while waiting. slide was totally crap- our ring got stuck in a middle around 20 meters from the ground. Try the park if you have money but dont bother if u are on a budget unless you can get cheap tickets. we tried as we wanted to compare it with other parks in Europe."
13,Amazing,For the Turkish people the have lower prices 85 Lira's but for the tourist dubbel. Sorry we were decided to go to the other parc Auqua Fantasyland. So much fun there and you pay 90 Lira'sWe were staying in the Lion hotel Kusadasi perfect place to stay clean and good food!
14,waterpark,"Really very big aquapark. On the sun it's very difficult to go from one slide to another one on the ceramic floors.Do not go to Amazon slide - it's slow, not funny and too big line to it, we had to wait for 30 mins to go down it, but it wasn't worth it. We started from the loop blue - the scariest one, so all the rest were childish afterwards. Also great ""slide and fly"" slide, but be careful. Most of ppl hurt themselves during flight to the pool.Also there are some ""all inclusive hotels"" entertainments like dancing in the rain. Seems to be funny, but it starts during the hottest sun. Photos are extremely expensive and it's impossible to trade for better price even if you take a lot. For digital version they ask extra money. Didn't like the attitude of these sales guys at all."
15,Kusadasi,it is a good place for kids with the regular fare of water rides and dolphin show is a must watch. HAlf a day is good to spend
16,Great waterpark! ,"This was a complete rip off!!  Adult price is from 9 years up wards, so I paid full price for my 10-12 and 14 year old. About a 3rd of the slides are only accessible for 14 and over. My kids are excellent swimmers and were gutted as all the other slides had no thrill element. They queued for 20 minutes to get to the top of a big slide and told as they were about to step on they were not allowed. A sign at the bottom would have helped. When entering the park they told us cash is not  accepted anywhere so you have to buy a top up card, they will refund any unspent cash unless you pay by card in which case any unused credit is kept by them. I saved about £100 to spend in gift shop and photo booth on way out, they only accept cash in those shops, so we lost £100"
17,Great Place,We spend here 1 whole day. There are plenty of nice water slides but the waiting lines were huge. The food inside the park is cheap and good.
18,"Great waterpark, a lot of fun",Lots of variety from simple easy slides to n pretty crazy ones! It’s reasonably good value too with plenty of lifeguards on duty.
19,Slide and fly ,"I visited as an excursion from Palm Wings resort in Didim which meant a 10am to 4pm stay in radiant, reliable August sunshine. I had 3 daughters with me aged 7, 9 and 11, all of whom thought the day was great. We headed for the key attraction initially, the Amazoon 'World's longest family slide' and waited an hour (mostly in shade) to get to top for about minute ride, which was fun but definitely not worth the wait. The rest of the day was a resounding success with numerous slides, tubes and pools which were great, we visited only about 50 per cent of them. Some of the rides are restricted: the amazing slide and fly is available only to aged 14 and over - I managed a gut wrenching belly flop from c 15ft in the air- not for the faint hearted! I saw no-one apart from adults/ older adolescents using the pink and blue 360degree loops. One tunnel restricted to minimum 150cm height and many had minimum 120cm height and these are variably enforced. However there is plenty for little children too. The safety of the rides was very good with single occupancy carefully checked. Be careful to secure your locker keys as I lost mine and it cost 5 lira each to recover. I also lost the dreaded payment card but got it reimbursed after producing receipts- staff were helpful in achieving this. In future I would load up this card from bank notes, not from debit or credit card as you cannot get any leftover currency back with latter. Unless of course you either know exactly what you're likely to spend OR leave enough time to spend the remaining card's credit. All in all this part of the experience felt a bit like a con which left a distasteful aftertaste in an overall brilliant day. I would give 9 out of 10 if I could. Just a reminder that you're not able to bring in drinks and food from outside, bags are checked for this."
20,Excellent day out,"We went there on 1 day of our holiday, we had a great time and good laugh. The slides were v good, loved the big wave machine, but didn't stay on long enough, other than that it was good."
21,Fun day,"We went there on an organised day trip while we stayed in Didim/Altinkum. Have to say we really enjoyed it there, it was really really quiet there, I would say 150 people maximum in the whole park. Water slides were good, except that ski jump death slide thing (it really hurt when landing, my choice of language wasn’t the best HaHa). Food really good price even if it was fastfood, 2x burger, chips and can soft drink 64lira about £7 for 2. It filled a hole. Dolphin and Sea Lion show was great, pretty entertaining (although it was separate payment for it) it was worth it. It is great for the younger kids and small families, 2 separate fun pools with little slides etc.Lockers free of charge, small fee for safety deposit box. It’s a cash-less water park, you charge up a pre-payment card as you enter park and you use it as you would a debit card, when you leave when you finished in there, any un-spent money is returned to you when you give card back. We would recommend for a chill-out day and probably will return the next time that we are in Altinkum."
22,Family birthday visit,This water park is amazing and very well staffed life-guards at every pool. There's lots to do it an amazing day out for people if all ages. Even the sea life part of the park is amazing.
23,British Review - Best Waterpark Ever,"We visited on a week day so there were no queues. There is a great selection of slides, some tame some terrifying but its great fun. The food was nice, and not too expensive. You aren't allowed to bring any food with you. It's a short taxi ride from Kasudasi city centre. Get there early to make the most of the day!!"
24,Brilliant,New abject slide&fly is amazing and dance ran is very nice and beautifulTher Is good place for all of 1day
25,Too Busy waste of time,"Great thrill rides, hardly any queueing and very clean. Good value for money meal deals too. Free lockers and plenty of beds around the park to chill on between rides. Great value day out for the family."
26,Day away from Hotel,It is an aqua park north of kusadasiOver all it was clean an it was not too crowded. Properity is really big and have from very regular to very nice slides. Some slides have weight limits.By paying entrance fee u can use most of rides for unlimitted times . Dolphin park is devided by a door on left side of park and have a 20euro seperate fee. They have option of swiming with dolphines by 90euro extra fee too. By 10tl per 2person u can buy rafting tickets. Consider that it is very bad part of park. On my next visit even it was free i would not attend. By hearing of rafting i thought its like Antalya rafting but in Adaland it is with a cano which u shall paddle ur self. Its lazy hard and making u really tired.A dive pool is also beside rafting which was nice. Foods are available there. FYI Beer was 15tl. Donner was 23 tl. At all park has lots of stairs and makes u really tired . So try to sleep well the night before u are going to visit.It worth the visit for at least one time specially if ur hotels aqua park is small and u r looking for some adrenaline
27,Fantastic,"Even though the park is closed in April, we got to watch the Dolphin show. The Trainers and Dolphins were very good and friendly. We almost had a private show as there were not many people at this time of the year. Kids cannot forget Maya (the dolphin in the middle). Sea lions on the show are very adorable. The lounge has good scenic views as well."
28,Best water park!,"Very big water park, with modern facility,  exciting slides. We went from 10  o'clock to 17( opening to closing). It has fastfood,  so dont worry for lunch. We found the ticket from tourist shop (next to ladies beach) cheaper than their website. I highly recommend it.  its a must-see."
29,Adalar was fun,Was great day out some fast slides and life guards great with children didn’t que for more than 5 mins shame food was so poor
30,Great but price high for it,"It took 90 minutes from our Hotel at Palm Wings Beach Resort to visit this water park.  It is very large and has a great range of slides but my children weren't big enough to ride most of them.  We did spend 45 minutes queuing for the Amazon family raft ride which was ok, then the aqua coaster which we loved.  The kids area has lots for them to play with, buckets, great theming with a pirate ship and lots of little slides.  My kids also enjoyed the pools and the jacuzzi pool was fun, along with the wave pool.  We didn't have any pictures taken as we didn't have enough money with us (weren't told we would need to put the money onto a card when we got there).  Also could have  had pictures with the parrots, but don't agree with it."
31,nice waterpark,This was the best place in kushadasi which I went.it has lots of good facility to enjoy.The zoomba dance was also great and the water which spread from the ground was amazing.
32,Disappointing,"This water park is brilliant accommodates all ages and has enough slides to keep everyone occupied for hours, there’s plenty of food and drink stops, and the dolphin park is amazing and the staff are too"
33,Amazing,"I booked online a week in advance and our children aged 2 & 1 went free.  Adult price was 50TL per person.  The otopark was empty on arrival as the water park had closed for the season.  We collected our tickets and made our way up to the dolphin cafe which had a huge terrace overlooking the sea.  Drinks are hellish expensive though - sprite was 8.50TL when it is usually 3TL in the local shops.  At 2pm we were allowed in and there was plenty of seating.  The sealions performed first followed by the dolphins.  The hanlders were excellent with them and did some fantastic stunts - there were long pauses at times where there was no interaction with the audience unlike other dolphin parks I have visited.  Also, the commentary was very difficult to understand.  Apart from that, we had a great day out and my daughter has been asking to return every day since!"
34,Such a shame ,"The place is worth a visit. There are plenty of water slides to chose from with very small ques. One of the highlights of the park are the free zumba and step up classes that take place in the middle of the park with water being sprinkled everywhere. No better way to cool down during a hot day! However, one of the most annoying things is that you have to pay extra to get a ticket in the Sea park and a different ticket for the Dolphin park. The so called biggest water park in Europe is really three parks with three different entrance tickets. The Doplhin show , however, was worth paying for as the show was very interactive and the trainers involved members from the audience to participate in some of the tricks such as dancing with the dolphins which was great fun."
35,"Great waterpark, we loved the slides, would definitely go back","We visited here as a family group of 13 had had an enjoyable day out. Lots of choice of slides and a couple that are like nothing we have been on before!! The slide and fly was brilliant Fun, but did produce a few bruises when hitting the water! The tall yellow slide which 6 of us went in a raft for was brilliant if a little terrifying. My criticisms are as follows;Children over 10 pay adult price but were still unable to go on ALL of the rides due to height restrictions. In my opinion child price is because not all slides are available so if they consider 10 adult priced then all of that age should have access to every ride. We had a 10 year old in our group who was very disappointed he had to sit some rides out. Beware the floor is very very slippery! I myself slipped down a flight of steps and have some impressive bruising to show for it, wear your flip flops or beach shoes!!No comment on the dolphin show as we do not agree with these things, you pay extra once in the park, so we did not attend. We were very sad to see a parrot being paraded around for photos in temperatures of 38 in the direct sun for hours at a time. The children in our group were quite upset at his/her treatment. I think the practice of using animals like this should be banned."
36,Day Trip,During our holiday in Turkey my friends and I visited the water park for one day as part of our holiday with Tui. We were not disappointment by the park. There were a variety of water rides/activities. I’m not a huge fan of heights/fast rides but there was still plenty of things for me to do. You got an Adaland card which you could put money onto and use at the restaurants. On departure you could then be given back any money not spent.  The changing/locker facilities didn’t seem very hygenic but we only used a locker which was helpful. If you wish to visit a water park during you visit I would recommend Adaland highly. Its a great day out.
37,best water park we have ever been to.,"Adaland is great place to take the kids. Top tip is to get there early and establish a base in the quietest area, around the diving boards at the top of the resort. Swimming with dolphins is a truly memorable experience and good value"
38,Great fun!!!!!,Do not give this place your time or money they charge extra for tourists €24 or 124 lira when it's only 80 lira for Turkish people!! Their reason for this is that Turkish people are poor!! What a joke
39,Small,We visited here after trying aqua fantasy waterpark. We found ada land to be dirty and some of the slides certainly unsafe. Locals pushed in and there seemed to be no system for fair sharing of the rings needed for the flumes. It's a free for all with the locals keeping hold of them rather than passing to next person to use. No staff to assist this so spent more time waiting to get a ring than in the queue. Food was poor and the wave pool floor was filthy. Tip: go to Aqua-Fantasy-Aquapark instead. Much better
40,A Must Visit ,Kusadasi was only one of our layover stops but this aquapark here is one of the main reason I stop by Kusadasi everytime I go on a holiday. It has this magical feeling that makes you want to go back there once you step out of it. It has numerous type of with and without boat rides which are full of excitement and joy. I would highly recommend everyone to see there for themselves at least once in their life.
41,Great place,"Had a fantastic day in adaland either sealions and dolphins!!!Fabulous show and excellent value for money, and you can have your own personal photo taken with the dolphins after the show!!!"
42,Fab day out,"We have visited Turkey in other areas and Adaland is a lot more expensive to what we are used to but we had a great day out. Due to the coronavirus we had to fill forms out before we were allowed entry, we had our temperature taken and questions asked along with ID and contact details. This process didn’t take long and was for the safety of staff and guests.  Once details were given you walked through a tunnel whilst it sprayed a disinfectant at you. Some slides were not on but this didn’t spoil the fun. The place was very clean but the floor gets very hot so wear your flip flops or pool shoes. Food and drink was not bad priced inside. Lockers were free of charge and we had no problem at all. Staff all wore masks and they asked you to be social distanced as much as possible. Staff do take photos and again these are not expensive. Overall we had a brilliant day out and would return if visiting Kusadasi"
43,Well worth a visit.,I was been in other aqua park in the world but the this park is very good . Really a water park . But the dancing not good .Istanbul aqua park was better .
44,An amazing day out!,"The dolphin show was great, but you can not take your own pictures with a camera unless u pay 10€ for a band to allow you to take pictures whilst at the show. But if you have a mobile phone you can take pictures for free !! You can swim with the dolphins after the show but is quite expensive. You can also have pictures taken with the dolphins but unsure how much they cost.The dolphins and their trainers where great and involved children and adults.We booked our show with a tour company in kusadasi town, but you can pay at the gate on the day."
45,Great place. ,"Great dolphin show for the kids, could have had a better package to interact more with the dolphins. Amazing scenery around dolphin arena.."
46,Great two days at Adaland.,"Must go to Adaland if you are in KusadasiA whole day we spent in this aquapark and we enjoyed every minute!!They have tobogans for every taste and courage!! I tried most of them, and the coolest is Amazon river with that boatYou just forget about hungry, thursthy!! They need elevators or something to get up faster because there are a lot of stairs and they need also more variety of food."
47,Water Park ,It is amazing park only inconvenience is they ask you to load some money on their own card but we couldn't not purchased pictures with the card or was not a cash machine in the premises Over Wall it was an super good experience I recommend
48,Wonderful,This water park has the best facilities for a fun day out for all ages.  Plenty of places to eat and comfortable resting lounge beds.
49,Family day out with the grand children,Never actually went to the waterpark but it looked great! I swam with the Dolphins instead. Amazing experience with lots of fun & interaction with these magestic gorgeous mammals. A good 20 minutes infact. Very well informed throughout & funds go to conservation of the breed (obvs percentage).
50,great fun!,"Wonderful day out, there was 7 of us we paid £148 for entrance, slides were good and enjoyable, loved the food"
51,Poor quality won’t ever return,"very large water park with full facilities and catering for all ages. we spend a full day here in June which was early season so not crowded. we also went to the dolphin show which was amazing, the children had a fantastic day. there is a gorgeous man made beach with salt water pool beside the aquarium, no one was on it when we visited."
52,Fun for all!,We have 2 teenaged girls who loved this place. They have been to several water parks and liked how yhey didnt have to wait too long for even the most popular rides. We didnt want to see the dolphin show. We did want to swim with the dolphins but found it too expensive. There is no discount on entry price even if you go in only 2 hours before closing time. The Slide and glide can be quite painful if you hit the water too hard. We had a lot of laughs together.
53,Fretwell family.,"Went on a Monday Middle of August great day very clean  food prices are  good  slides are great  biggest queue was 15 mins for family slide the big yellow one, the rest only 2 to 3 mins, note height restrictions  some being 1.2m Thomas cook price £20 each so I booked in town for only £15 saving £20 which paid for drink and dinner for  the 4 of us at the park happy days"
54,adaland,"This water park has some of the most exciting slides we ever experienced, best for teens and up. Rain dance was lots of fun. However it is too big and too spread out and we found ourselves walking around more than sliding. Also the water tasted absolutely gross. They must have one of those salt filters.  Can't really recommend I'm afraid, other aqua park in Selcuk way better"
55,Great day out,wonderful day! with wonderful location and weather! nice personnel and exciting games in last open day of aquapark!
56,RIP OFF DOLPHIN PARK,"I only did the swimming with dolphins experience with my 12yr old daughter, so can only comment on that, not the rest of the park.While the experience could not be described as cheap (around £80 each, plus another £80 for a CD of pics of two people, £50 for one person with the photos taken by the park staff -  though you could have people that accompanied you take pics from free, but not from the best position), it was a very enjoyable experience, with the staff obviously not only keen you enjoyed yourself, but that they had a good relationship with the animals.You start with a talk about what's going to happen, what to do and maybe more importantly what not to do and then go and put a bouyancy jacket on and get in the water with the dolphin - two were in the pool with us, though we interacted with only one of them.  Park staff were taking photos throughout, though as I say any accompanying family were free to watch and take photos, though their position was not as good.  The experience in the water lasted around 25 minutes and you got to touch the dolphina few times as it swam along the line of participants a few times, individually ""kiss"" (yes, as salty as it sounds!) the dolphin, ""dance"" with it and swim withe the dolphin.We came in on a cruise ship to Kusadasi port and for info, the taxi was Euro16 return."
57,Holiday,Loved everything at this aqua-park. You not gonna believe that it is the biggest aqua park in Europe until you visit it
58,Fantastic day,"we went as part of shore excursion, and what a delightful place. the dolphin show was great as where the sea lions, there was audience participation which was fab. it was really clean and tidy and the staff where friendly. i would certainly recommend for a visit"
59,ME HAPPYYYYY :)))),"the park is as any other park is....waterslides, pools, restaurants and its big attraction, the dolphins. Now I am rampantly against keeping any big sea animals, dolphins or whales etc in pools for our amusement and this is no different. That aside the dolphins do provide great entertainment for kids, big and small alike. Still they should be in the sea and not in a pool. Rant over. Other than that the day is fun and reasonably priced but not cheap."
60,recovering dolphin photos,"We had a great time at Adaland, lots of good water slides.The slide and fly is a must!I would not recommend going to see the dolphins in captivity 😥Much nicer in their own habitat."
61,Waterpark,Excellent water park with something to suit every age group.  Also very good value for money as you can spend the full day there  and it cost about £20 each.  Definitely be back next we are in Turkey
62,Kids loved the dolphin show!,We paid 180 TL ((about £20 each) from an agent in Kusadasi.  On the internet they were 197 TL and with our tickets we also got free shuttle service to and from our hotel so worth speaking to the agents on the street occasionally!Some great slides - check out their website for full details.
63,"TOP, Great Fun","We visited this Park in June.  The dolphin show was fantastic, the session show only lasted a couple of minutes.The Dolphin swim was worth the money.  When it came to purchase photographs we paid 80 Euros to have all pictures of 2 swimmers on a cd.  There had been pictures taken from the dolphin show and we asked if we could have these on the cd and we were told we had to purchase the photos only and this would have been extra per picture.For the price of the entrance to the show and the dolphin show this totalled to 104 euros which was a lot of money and tonne told you would have to pay extra for photos which you could have on the cd was a con."
64,"Great fun, fab dolphin show & variety of slides!","Amazing waterpark, one day there just isn't enough. Park is hugh and have almost 30 slides. So much fun."
65,A little expensive,A lovely day for the family. Lots of very big slides. Nice and clean with life guards in every pool for safety. Good choice of food and drink. Not expensive for a meal. It's however not suitable for disabled guest's. Lots of steps and inclines. The best part of my day was the dolphins. You can swim with the dolphins but this can be come expensive for a family. Lovely veiws.
66,Totally empty but nice dolphin show.,my friend and i we have visited there and it was one of my best experiences in kusadasi i would eliminate one star for safe boxes becuz the give a key that you dont know where to put it!!!and also we didnt have a hair dryer there!!!
67,I do not recommend,This is a wonderful water park with many  scary and enjoyable slides. To just sit and watch the 'Slide and fly' water slide is worth the entrance fee alone
68,So much fun!,"Great for teens - loads of slides and several pools. Big queues for tallest one but otherwise not at all crowded so short queues, plenty of sun beds and cafes. Dolphins are well cared for and swimming with the Dolphins was the highlight of our holiday. The trainers were great. Remember flip flops as the floor is burning hot. We got a taxi from main town for 10 Euros and he collected us at the end. Didn't get to do Dolphins until 5pm so bear in mind if you are cruising and have to be back on the boat. The communication about this was a bit limited which was the only negative."
69,Pretty Good,"Adaland is a big water park in kusadasi that is a good way to spend a day if you are bored of the beach or pool. There are rides suitable for all ages from little slides for tiny tots to very fast rides the teenagers will love. You can't take food in but there are various cheap restaurants that are perfectly ok for burgers , pizza and Turkish food. You will get your photos taken throughout the day and theses are then all put on a big notice board for you to buy if you want for 15 lira each at the end of the day. At the entrance you exchange you cash for a credit card and at the end of the day exchange anything you have left back. The park is not too crowded and everything runs very smoothly with the lifeguards/ staff very attentive and watchful. So , why only 3 stars?  The price on the website is advertised as 75 lira ( 55 for under 9 )  but when we got to the ticket office the girl there said 100 lira each.  Luckily I was with turkish people and as soon as the girl realised this she looked sheepish and said ok 75lira. Whether she was personally pocketing the difference or it is adaland policy to rip off tourists I don't know but this year in turkey I have lost count of the amount of times this sort of thing has happened. Rather than welcome tourists the Turks seem determined to overcharge and rip them off at every opportunity which is going to backfire badly as there are very few Europeans willing to risk coming here already so treating the few who are here badly seems idiotic. So a good day out but make sure you aren't ripped off for not being turkish"
70,Fun day out.,Went here for the day in June 2017 as it was only located a short distance from our resort. Loved the slides everything looked clean and well maintained. The floor there was too hot to walk on especially as the heat was 34 degrees! My advice would be to wear flip flops etc when walking around.
71,a waterpark it is,It's amazing many slides and very high. You have 2 pools big enough special for the kids. You can eat sit everywhere there is place for everyone. Every pool have minimally 2 lifeguards.
72,Great day out ,me and my family really enjoyed visiting adalandfrom huge water slides to the lazy pools  everything was 5*
73,Very good water park,"We visited here on Sunday as a family of 7 with 2 children. There are many rides, they are however spaced out and many hidden. The rafting and dolphin show are additional.We all had a great day.They will take food and drink off you however you can take in frozen water. Food very well priced. I would not say this was bigger than Siam Park though."
74,Fun day had by all,Well if you like getting wet and wild and pushing some wet geforce you really need to go here.this place has every type of slide from those who just want a quick dip to those who want to thrash around quick turns steep drops even shooting off the end of a slide into the air before hitting the water. This place is great for all kids even the big ones like me.
75,Scammers with the prices / oplichters met de entree prijzen.,"Great family day out & something for all ages, we visited beginning of season so there was no queues but some of the rides didn't open until the afternoon - I can imagine it becomes quite crowded July/August and quite difficult to get sun loungers! The place was very clean including toilet facilities and the park appeared to be well supervised - they operate a no cash system so when you arrive you can pay a 5ltr deposit for a plastic card which you load cash onto to purchase food & drinks at the end of the day if you return the card your deposit and any money not used is refunded! Only one food stall was open & it had very limited choice, but again this was due to it being beginning of season - drink fries & burger cost around 18ltr - saw signs for a vitamin bar & Waffle House which would of be been nice! Had a photographer on site randomly taking pics and offering more organised photo shoots - obviously another money making spin for the park but the pics came out nice and cost around 20ltr each (fiver gbp)! All in all was a good family day out - we booked through a vendor near our hotel and it worked out to be £16 per person which included pick up & drop off - grand daughter aged 3 was free."
76,Great day out and slides amazing,I've been to both Aqua Fantasy water park and Adaland. Aqua Fantasy seems bigger with more slides etc.but I enjoyed Adaland better. Less queues so more time on the slides. My kids preferred this also. A very beautiful water park indeed. A great day out.
77,Great water park ,"Firstly I find it very hard to believe it’s the ‘Best water park in Europe’ as they advertise and what’s advertised around the park?! We had to first que up outside to fill in a form relating to COVID-19 which took about 10 mins. They then take your temperature and ask you what hotel you’re at etc. From here we then paid roughly £25 per person (quite steep for Turkey). Once inside you have to put all your personal belongings away in a locker (free) and keep the key on you. After that if you wish to purchase any bits in the park you need to use cash to top up a card which they give you the money back after if you have anything left over. (This is a 5TL deposit for the card and if you lose the card you don’t get any money back!)We then went and tried to find our way around the park but there’s no signs with where everything is nor is there anyone to ask to show you around etc so you just have to find your own way which is really annoying considering the size of the park.Once we did find our way around there is a massive hill to get to the big slides but due to not being able to wear flip flops you are forced to leave them down at the bottom. Thus, you’re trying to run around bare foot on the scorching hot sun baked floor which literally burnt our foot. I would definitely advise to wear rock shoes as these are allowed.Lastly, if you want to do the rafting you have to pay an extra 25TL on top which is t a lot of money however isn’t mentioned.Overall it was okay however wouldn’t go again."
78,Not up to previous standards,Great fun place with all you'd want for a day of water splashing fun! Staff are friendly and helpful and very safety conscious. Just lots of walking between slides.
79,Excellent day out!,My son really enjoyed swimming won dolphins . Think it's a bit overpriced considering that you swim in a group and you only get a few minutes with the dolphin to actually swim or touch . The show was good and staff very friendly .
80,Great day out.,"Adaland was a fabulous day out for the whole family with a great selection of slides, almost none of which we had to queue for. Although not everything was open on the day we visited, there was more to do than we had time for. I'd highly recommend a trip, it was so fun."
81,Very Hit and Miss,The ticket price is 110 tl for adults 90 tl for children.The place was good however you have to wait minimum 30 minutes sometimes up to 1.5 hour... the number of people to enter the place should be limited
82,Everything you wish in a waterpark,Excellent and lovely aquapark the staff are very professional with clean and treated water my kids was very happy and satisfied A+ with highly recommendation ;
83,Supper park,"We were picked up from hotel, after breakfast and reached within half an hour, an attractive Aqua park , said to be the largest in Europe. . This multi storey park is full of greenery,scenic view and various swimming pools of Different depths. Special options for kids and teens are available. Rafting tunnel of 460 meter from the height of 40 meters is thrilling. Food and drinks are available within the Adalanda Aqua park of Kusadasi. Raining fountains with musical dance arrangements are there for an hour at midday, . This is amazing. One must not miss it if visit Kusadasi. One day 5-6 hours recreation in water world ,fun music and thrills is very enjoyable particularly in summer season."
84,Interesting,My kids loved it here. The castles with water slides fir the smaller kids are amazing. The huge slides for big and small brilliant. Just the food wasn't great. Average take away nothing special. And expensive for it as it's very basic. Other then the food the park it great.
85,Brilliant ,"We recently visited Adaland and had packed a picnic to take. We weren't advised by the rep when booking that food and drink isn't allowed into the park. We were told to leave our picnic with staff and pick it up on our way out. If your wanting food you have to purchase a resturant card and the price ranges depending on which resturant you want to eat at.The slides were ok but once we'd been  round a couple of times we were bored and ready to go home! The wave pool isn't that great either. If your wanting to see the Dolphin show you have to pay further money to see this which we thought was a bit much after paying £60 pounds to get into the place!!We left disappointed, hungry and a little let down by the whole experience. It's safe to say we will not be visiting again."
86, Very good attraction,We have been to adaland before as whole family it is quite good as far as water parks go very good slides and a big selection! Changing and showering room needs improvements.
87,Loved here,We all enjoyed time at the park. Usual restrictions. Good rides friendly staff.  Food and drinks available but we were all inclusive at the hotel so food and drinks cost you here.
88,An excellent family venue,The landscape is very beautiful. But there are a lot of stairs so I could not use all the means.we were tired after 3 hours.100 stairs for one slide.One suggestion: Please assemble escalators
89,Warning,Adaland was a spur of the moment idea. We went with 3 teens and an under 10. They seemed to all get on for once. They had pools and slides available for all of them. All of the children spoke about if for fays after. We even decided to go back a few days later.Booked through the hotel and was quite cheap for a full day out.Perfect for any children above about the age of 8.
90,Efsane!,"This was rated as the best Water-park in Kusadasi so I was probably expecting too much. It was a nice water park with all the things you would expect, lots of slides and a wave pool, and the kids had a great time, but it  wasn't exceptional, and when compared to other parks I have visited in other countries, I don't think I would remember it.In saying that, it was clean I have no complaints"
91,I thought I hated waterparks,"We have been to Adaland to give our 9 years old daughter the swimming with dolphins experience. We stayed at the Pine Bay Holiday resort which is at walking distance from Adaland. I recommend this experience to all parents with kids able to swim, it was our daughter’s holiday highlight!"
92,Adaland,very good long ride but worth it.trip was done on the first day so we booked with a rep arrived on time. no waiting day was good but it was the end of season and the park was shut just the dolphin show. had to pay ten lira to take photos and you couldn't really as they moved to quick.
93,Great day swimming with dolphins ,"A fabulous day trip! Transfer from hotel took 10 mins, showers lockers provided no extra charge. Sunbed a plenty!!! So many slides of all shapes and sizes!! Dolphin show and a chance to swim with them at an extra charge😁"
94,A big dissapointment,"This water park is supposed to be one of the best, however I would say I've been to better water parks, staying the whole day is far too long as there's not millions to do. Most of the day was spent in the pools to try waste time. However the food within the place was great!!"
95,Great water park,"Went to the water park with family - a lot of fun but it's pretty pricey, even for Turkey. We went on a rather chilly/rainy day so there were no lines - the slides were great. One slide though I would not recommend - the double ramp slide that launches you into the air - fun, but I hurt my butt! On the whole is a fun day trip but could get very expensive very quickly depending on size of group, souvenirs, etc."
96,Great ,Family visit and well worth it.  The slides are amazing get their early as queues do form later in the day.  Food is reasonable to purchase there also together with any photos you may have taken.   Would visit again.   We brought a family ticket from our rep on site which was REGAL and cost us £20 per person which included transport to and from.   We were picked up at 9.30am and returned 5pm.    The children were classed as adults as ages 13 and 14.
97,Good day out,"We travelled at the start of the season and the dolphin and sea park was not open, although the price of the tickets were still the same as peak season. There was a small lazy river but the larger one was in the dolphin area which was closed. The slides were good fun apart from the slide assistant suggested that 6 people could use a boat to travel down the large yellow side, only 5 used the slide but we nearly tipped over the edge due to the weight of everyone together. Poor health and safety. We then went to eat and queued for at least half an hour before reading a small sign at the front of the queue saying that you must go to reception to get a card to put money on to pay for anything in the park. This wasn't clearly stated at the gates and was just unnecessary. Also no maps of the parks so hard to tell where everything is."
98,Swimming with dolphins experience ,"Excellent! We went twice in August; first time afternoon spent mostly in Dolphin Park (2 kids swam with dolphins, a great experience!) second time in main waterpark. Clean and good water quality. Rides are excellent and staff helpful. WEAR FLIP FLOPS! Walking surfaces get very hot in sunshine. Downsides: There are no clocks anywhere to be seen despite some events being timed. Food is limited (but OK), and you cannot take your own. You may have to queue for rides without shade!"
99,Beautiful Aqua Park,Lovely well kept aquapark. Great fun but the day trip was too long. We would have been happy leaving after lunch time but bus collection was 4.30pm.
100,Overpriced but good fun,Definitely the best water park so much to do and see. Money goes on a plastic card rather than carry it with you all day plus lockers and safes if u wanted to use for small fee. Fabulous choice of water rides as we have kids age 9-18 and there was something for all to do. Europe biggest water park with the longest family slide was amazing just the walk up the stairs to get to the top was long..... As end of season not any real queuing either. We didn't go see dolphins as additional cost and £90 per child to swim with them but the main park had so much you need not worry Rafting /jumping off high boards/ slides and fun pools everything for the whole family
101,Family Visit May 2018,"Dolphin show was very nice and enjoyed by all. Swimming with dolphins was a once in a lifetime opportunity which was exquisite. However, it was not long enough for money spent."
102,RIP OFF,Kids found it very hard to get on slides with height restrictions Also food very basic and expensive
103,Minder valide mensen,Good park nice rides good value quite on my visit Aug 2016 parts of the park closed but in general good fun and plenty of rides pools etc and all value for Money
104,Nice day out!,Lovely day out at £25 each with transport from Altinkum 1.5 hours away booked with IMX tours.Plenty of slided to keep us adults occupied.The slide where you fly off can be dangerous but luckily i landed spot on. Others were not so lucky & the life guard kept having to jump in. It was good to watch though!The food was ok & reasonably priced. Just the usual burger and chips etc.It wasnt overly busy & id say longest we qued was 15 mins.Lovely grounds & i would go back. Its definitely not the best water park in europe though.
105,Just wide area not big!!!,"Had good time and funny, variouse pools, good staff, clean, we enjoyed our time but some parts were closed, not too big but enough, there are dolmush for transporting in 3 lira for each persone,"
106,Be careful and have fun,"Best water park we went for the day and had great fun from the time we went in until we went home ,food was nice and not too expensive"
107,Dolphins ,"The best aqua park I've ever been to!An amazing place for family fun.We visited it to swim with dolphins, but we also took advantage of all the water attractions.Staff were very responsive.Thanks for the unforgettable moments!"
108,Little dude loved it ,Went to this water park with 6 kids ranging from 3 to 12 and each child loved every part and lots for all to do staff was very helpful and friendly and the dolphins part was absolutely fantastic
109,The water park,The park is so wonderfull with so fun but the staffs are rude and didn't explain very well.I was injured but the doctor was there and helped me soon.
110,Great dolphin show,Our daughter swam with the Dolphins and it was a dream come true. Staff where very friendly and happy. Dolphins look well cared for and pools where clean. It was a little more expensive than we expected €100 for 20 min swim. The show afterwards was also brilliant and although there where not many people they did a show like the place was full. It's worth a visit.
111,Day out ,Had a lovely day here. The thrill seeking rides are something else! You literally take off! The park is impeccably clean with lots of toilet facilities around. Good choice of restaurants and a cashless system in place so you can store money and valuables in the free locker. (Or pay for a safe)A lot of the rides have a height restriction of 1.2 but there are kids areas and family slides
112,nice ,"Travelling from Didim to Kusadasi was a long 2 hours' drive but once we got to Adaland Water park  it was well worth the trip!  The place was not too busy and it is very clean.  You need to put some money on the card to spend in the shops inside the water park (you can get a refund back if you don't use all in the card). Plenty of sun beds & pools nearby to chill with music on the background. No queues to go on all the water slides. The slides were good & suitable for all ages (obviously some slides have height limits).  Food choices were  limited but  good. No local Efes beer & all imported beer which was bit pricey.  Unfortunately the Dolphin area was closed during our visit. You have to pay extra for the Dolphin show.  Apart from that, it's a good water park and we had an absolutely amazing time.  The pictures from the official park photographers came out really good (mine was funny).  Make sure you pick one on the way out!  It could get busy in the summer!"
113,Extreme,"Had to contact Adaland as we lost our photos from the dolphin swim, within a matter of hours staff had found my photo's and supplied a link for me to download them from, exceptional customer service over a year later. we have been a few times to Adaland and always enjoyed it but 2017 with Dennis(the dolphin) and the professional trainer will stay with us for the rest of our lives as a MOST MEMORABLE time! TY to ALL Adaland staff who have helped make my personal dream come true"
114,Satisfactory,Big park and lot of options to have good fun hours. You can enjoy easy ban or go for hard and very high jumps.
115,Very nice and clean water park,We visited Adaland for the dolphin show it was really good. We all enjoyed it. The dolphins and sea lions was really very clever. Was apparently the cheapest place to swim with the dolphins.If you have children it's worth the visit
116,Adaland,price of entrance was 27$ in the gate but you can buy ticket 20$ in city . games was good but workers of there cant speek english and didnt care about visitors . lost my glass and they didnt let met to seek and also theire selft didnt seek to find it.also i expected at least towel or shampoo but ...
117,gooood,That's very nice and funny to me. Many games and 3 of  them is very emotional and hi energy. If you go to kushadasi you are very crazy if you not going to there.
118,Full day of fun,Best day of my trip and best birthday in there. The food was not very good and expensive. Staff were very friendly
119,rude staff and expensive food and beverages,"Undoubtedly wonderful place to spend your day in. I would put 8 points from 10.Few tips:-I would reccomend to buy tickets online and simply take a mini bus from the city center (#1). Park is open till 10pm summer time.-They dont explain on the entrance but you have to buy a special card to be able ordering food and refreshments in the bars. So better to do it while you are down there.-Yes, floor is super hot be ready.-I hope it was just not the most cleanest day today, I pretended I didnt see some ugly dust.. just to feel better. Anyways 8 from 10. You should experience it yourself."
120,Average waterpark,Fantastic water park over twenty slides. Numerous pools plus plenty of beds in the sun & shade. Loads of lifeguards around. The bwst park I've been too.
121,Unforgettable experience!,A great day out and lots of fun. Really cheap I would recommend buy tickets from one of the vendors they are often cheaper then buying from Adaland and it includes transfers as well. At the water park there are plenty of rides and things to do. No need to take your own food as there is a food court. There are locker rooms so you can keep your items safe and secure.
122,Adaland is a great fun great value day out,"Lovely day out, great place for all ages. My 2 daughters and I swam with the dolphins which was a lovely exsperience but quite pricey!. Food well priced aswell put 300 lira for a family of 7 on the card and was just the right amount."
123,Way too big and too spread out,"We decided to give the water park side ago this year after doing the dolphin swim on last years holiday, we went on Wed 10th August arriving at 10am, the park was pretty quiet most of the day and getting a sun bed anywhere you wanted wasnt a problem, no long waits in the heat at anytime during the day for any of the slides or rides.The park is very clean and well maintained, would definatly return, a great fun filled day out had by all."
124,"there are too many steps, and too few activities and entertainment in compare with Dubai water parks","We loved every second, we have about 5.5 hours from when the bus dropped us off to been picked up and we could of done with longer. The kids didn’t want to leave. The older two (16/14) loved the slide and fly and drop slides and my youngest (8) loved the slides with the rings. All the staff were friendly and really like the payment card so we didn’t have to carry cash round with us all days"
125,Wonderful water park,"Brilliant fun day out, spent whole day here and don't think we did all the slides haha. Food was good, wish we had had time to fit in the dolphin show too, maybe next time, as we will definitely be back"
126,Fun day out,"We had planned to visit Adaland before travelling to Turkey as a family, and it exceeded expectations. The number & variety of rides was exceptional, and the longest wait for a ride was less than 20mins, with most being around 5 mins. The highlights for us were slide & fly (new ride for 2016), Amazoon and Freefall. Would highlight recommend for all families, particularly if you have teenage kids."
127,exciting!!!,Awesome water slides and a dolphin park too. It costs more to ride with the dolphins but well worth it.
128,Good visit but....,"AMAZING! Amazing does not even cover it! We got to swim with dolphins! as well as watch and take part in the dolphin show, where first children were taken closer and then wet by them, and then they took the women closer and we too were soaked! Best day of my life i highly recommend. It cost us 90Euro each to swim with them and then 256TL for a disc with 68 photos of the experience on it."
129,Great activities,"This waterpark was great for the day and a short walk from our hotel, Pine Bay Holiday Resort...great slides and my smallest child was over the 120cm so she was able to go on most that she wanted. Lots of sunbeds. Food was reasonably priced to me. 6 euros for burger/kebab meal ish i think...Dolphin show was very entertaining and my children loved to see the dolphins up close. Also sea cats were funny and entertaining introduction. Dolphin carers/ staff seemed to have very good relationship with them treated them well, with two eco-warrior children, this was important to us.Photos available from onsite photographers very reasonable to me 5 euros i think.Booking note: Be careful that your email works in Turkey first before you book online mine did not, we purchased third party ticket supplier online tickets, when we arrived they couldn't find our online booking and payment and as my email didnt sync in Turkey i had no tickets to show, they claimed we had not paid and we had to rebook for the next day. Even the next day we were not on the online booking list but my husbands email worked, luckily.Great park, would return if we went back to Kusadasi."
130,Lots of Fun,"Was a great place to take the children. Plenty of slides for all ages. My three children age 11, 7 and 21months had plenty to do. Would go again."
131,Fun,This water park blows all others out the water...excellent...slides are excellent with a good buzz factor...cant recommend enough....
132,Adrenaliiiineeee,"Nice hobbies, many kind of water structures, foods size small, not good for it, you may take some snacks with you, there is a safe case for your belongings, so many pools are available"
133,Great Fun!,"There are two water parks in the area this and aqua fantasy.  Both are great so if you have the time do both!I went with my family who are 13,11 and 9 years old (all above 120cm).  This park I also has dolphins and rafting experiences, which are extra if you want to do them.The park has rides for all ages and some which I wasn't sure I wanted to go on.  They are strict with height but allowed my to take my go pro down the rides ( something aqua fantasy don't).  The food is ok and is a little on the expensive side, but you have to expect that. There is a card system for buying this nhs, which you have to load money into.  Some reviews say you can't get your money back. This is true if you use a credit card.  If you use cash then it's no problem.The staff were great, spoke English very well and were always helpful.  The park is clearly older than aqua fantasy, but please don't let that put you off.  It is a great place to visit so go go go."
134,Trip to Adaland,"The slides are very fun to do. A few a painful but still fun somehow. Didn't go to the dolphins or animal section, since I didn't want to support this section."
135,Good splashing fun ,"If there is one thing for sure, the Turks know how to build a Waterpark. Excellent Park and good value for money. We went twice!"
136,Rude staff & smokers everywhere,Brilliant day out plenty to do for kids and adults raft slides are brilliant food cheap as well very clean and plenty of life guards to keep your children safe
137,Adaland,Really big water park. Great fun for all the family. Many different water attractions. Spacious. Variety of restaurants.
138,Great family day out!,"Brilliant place for families with children of all ages,you can choose to go on the water slides or just chill by one of the pools. We went and loved every minute of our day out."
139,Good day out but....,It is bit out of the city centre but is worth to do it. It is one of the biggest ones in Europe we got the information. You pay around €40 p.p. and can enjoy all the day.
140,Amazing waterpark,"Day trip out with the family lovely clean water park we swam with the dolphins then had fun on the water slides sunbathed. free lockers, showers provided please where flip flops as feet can get burnt whilst walking around"
141,A good waterpark,"Very disappointed with this park. I was already aware that you have to load money onto an ""adaland card"" but thought this was a great idea as they refund anything that you haven't spend and it saves you carrying soggy notes about. What the sales etc don't tell you is that they only refund cash so if you top it up with a debit , credit or even a post office currency card they don't return anything back to you. Surely if they have the means to debit the card they should also be able to credit the card too. It just stinks of a scam and they must be making a fortune by it. We had booked a trip which included transport. When we originally booked the trip we were told it was 6pm return but on the day when we were dropped of we were told it was 5pm. False advertising yet again. We were outside for 5pm waited around until 5:15 when we decided to contact our rep to see what was going on. At 5:45 we were finally told that the adaland driver had left at 5:05pm as we wasn't there. He needs to get his watch checked because we was there bang on 5pm but even so to only give you 5minutes grace is disgusting. The staff were really unhelpful and didn't want to know. Thank god for our rep Max from regal who went out of his way and organised us transport back to the hotel. If I were you I would save my money, the parks pretty naff so I'm not sure how they can keep a straight face whilst saying the number one water park in Europe so add to that the rude disinterested staff, the credit card scam and the fact they smoke everywhere even in the kids pools this has got to be the worst water park I have ever been too."
142,amazing fun,Half of park wasnt open so a little disappointing wasn't told this when we booked. Definately not a full day needed to visit. Was very clean
143,Wow what a park,"We have visited here since 4 yrs ago and apart from one new slide nothing has changed and it has lost the “buzz” that you get from other European water parks.  We had 3 older teenagers with us who were soon bored of the tame slides apart from Slide & Fly - just be warned there is a high percentage that you will get hurt on this slide when you hit the water (yes it is amusing watching people slap the water with backs, faces, etc but not when it is you). The zip wire is permanent closed so just the 2 slides - be careful We booked tickets in UK so got them for £16 each (entrance only as we have a car). Do your homework as they charge more for tourists. Unless they add some more big rides then we won’t be going again. This is more suited for under 15s I would say. Get there early as it does get busy with long queues"
144,Amazing place,- Efficient well run waterpark that prides itself in cleanliness. - Internal card system avoids cash and on return of card the balance remaining is paid back to visitor. - - - Variety of slides and late afternoon disco incorporating water fountains to Arabic music is worth the entry alone.
145,Big day,"We went twice to Adaland with a couple of days between, both days were amazing. We were travelling with our three kids aged 3, 7 and 10. Fortunately our boy, aged seven is around 125cm high so he could go on all the rides with his older sister and they absolutely had a blast riding all the slides, so did I by the way. The park is very well organized so there are short distances between the rides. On both occasions when we visited we stayed the whole day, I recommend making a day out of it if you go there since it isnt really cheap going there with the whole family, especially when a 10 year old pays like an adult. Anyways we went two times so the price didnt scare us away. I was a bit worried that my youngest wouldnt have anything to do but there are at least three pools with some activity for the youngest and they wont get easily bored there. The food court is very good on my oppinion and all the children ate like lions, very happy about that. We also went to see the dolphin show and it was really fun for the kids. One hidden quiet gem at the site is the seapark. In the seapark there is a seapool that is amazing to go and dive in for fun, I recommend going there if the slides start to get boring... which they wont. Anyways have a great time at Adaland."
146,Good value,"We hv a family of a 19 year old and our son who was 9 and wanted to go for his birthday. We were all pleasantly surprised with the whole park! There’s something for everyone. We loved the wave pool to the biggest slide. Children’s lovely pool area to floaty and fast rides on ‘doughnuts’. The views were beautiful and we couldn’t fault a thing. We watched the sea lion/ dolphin show which was lovely too. We went on 2nd Sept and the worst queue was about 4 people in front of us!! We were very lucky as I’m sure a week or so ago it would hv been very different. Only problem we had all day was they didn’t know about online tickets and this seemed to cause a problem for entering - they sorted it in the end, but it was frustrating! All in all an excellent day for very good value of money in return."
147,Great slides,"This water park was great, a good selection of slides and pools, the only downside was that it was slightly outdated and some of the slides are a bit rusty and hurt your back where the links in the slides were. A good range of slow/fast/scary rides. Only thing is they don't spray the walkways often and the sun makes it really hot so you burn your feet easily and have to run everywhere."
148,Too big aquapark,"Lovely day out with the kids had loads of fun and the park is huge so,loads to keep u going for the full day would definitely recommend going here but book with tours on the street as better priced compared too hotel reps"
149,Great fun! ,Big fun and a lot of adrenaline! Very clean. A lot of attraction. Dolphin and seals park and the show was amazing.
150,Swimming with dolphins,The food in the park is average at best but ride queues are ok and we had a great day on the slides. The floor tiles are so so hot and you can’t wear flip flops on rides etc so suggest you invest in some swimming shoes likes in the pic. Yes it’s not the newest water park in town but we had a good day.The dolphin experience is amazing and so worth the 100 Euro per person. We had a ratio of 3 people to 1 dolphin and had 20 Mins quality time with it. Brilliant fun and the dolphins looked well looked after
151,Not god value,Had a brilliant time here with friends and partner. Slides are great had loads of fun. It wasn’t overly crowded which was good so didn’t have to wait long to go down slides. Lifeguards on every slide and pool which is good. Outside Zumba twice a day which u can join in with whilst getting  wet with jets of water  great fun. U  putmoney on a special card for your lunch and drinks so u don’t have to worry about carrying around cash. Over all a great day out for kids and big kids .
152,Adaland water park,"This was a great show to watch , started of very slow and it was definitely the perfect weather for it to, but would of been nice if there was some sun shade to sit under , Show lasted 45minutes worth the Money to, 3 Adults and a baby was £14 per person under 3year old Free..."
153,Fun day,Visited mid August with my family. Free shuttle from hotel. Shuttles were busy so had to let 2 go before we could get on one. Queues at entrance but didn't have to wait too long. Internet sales queue was smaller and much cheaper to book direct rather than through a rep. We found out after it was half the price. Adaland is good fun. Things for all ages. Food and drink quite reasonably priced. Several times a day there is dancing under jets of water led by two staff up on a stage. Very popular. Lots of sunbeds available too. Would return.
154,Top-up cards inconvenient if not all attractions are going to use them,"It is like the water park, will definitely return to druzmi here more than once, the mood is good, do not want to leave-("
155,Waterpark,"It's very nice, but so overcrowded (( queue is very long. Cheaper then others parks, but 1 day is not enough for this park. Quite and peace. I recommend it!"
156,First time,"Many of the rides feel unsafe, the 'slide and fly' in particular was awful (Pic related, that's what happened to me). If you've been to any other waterparks you won't be impressed. Dolphins seemed very subdued, which was sad to see."
157,Great water park ,adaland is located next to ephesus princes and tusan hotel and you can go there by walking.in adaland aqua park you can find many facilities for every one in every age and every day at 3 pm you can go for rainy show which it is the best program for every one.
158,Best aqua park in kusadasi,"great fun day, travel via dolmus from kusadasi and pay at gate, buy a card at entrance and pre load with cash, lockers free amazing slides for all ages"
159,Great day out,Absolutely fantastic water park! The slides and facilities all to a high standard.. Good food for price.. Lots to do and see! Friendly staff.. Recommend a visit to anyone..
160,A great day out! ,"Great place for families with young and older children ,our 3 loved it . Plenty to do for everyone and rides were from pretty basic to too scary 😂 Prices in the park does not bite also and you can enjoy some nice ice cream and foods. Dolphin show next door was amazing ❤️"
161,Alright,"So much on offer here at adaland. Cannot recommend this water park enough!!! So much on offer there is something to please everyone. My children had an absolute ball which made me very happy! Definitely visit here while on holiday in turkey, you won't be disappointed 👍"
162,A little over priced for what you get. ,"Came here for the day during our holiday to Kusadasi. It wasn't too expensive to get in (about £21 for an adult). Changing rooms are basic but seem surprisingly clean which was good.The park itself is a good size with plenty of rides. You go down most on rubber rings with makes it more comfortable, and there is lots of choice from lazy, enjoyable ones to the full on adrenaline ones! The Hellslide is brilliant!I also went swimming with the dolphins which was well worth the money and a fantastic experience. The staff were mostly friendly and all in all it was a really fun day out!Top tip- don't go on the small yellow slide next to the almost identical one in orange. It has a sharp angle change near the bottom and it really hurt!"
163,Brilliant day,A place you don't wanna miss while in Kusadasi! Funny for both adults and children. And swimming with dolphins...no words needed❤ We've been there on a monday so there weren't so many people...quite relaxing.
164,Dolphin show,"Great day out 2 adults 6&11 year old booked with rep and got 6yr old free werent happy at gate woops. Sun loungers plenty. I would only say take your own snacks if kids get bit hungry after lunch as only sell drink and ice cream burger, chips etc. Would recommend day out here."
165,best waterpark ever,"Park would be great if they did something about the ridiculously hot floor, burns your feet to walk and you obviously can't take sandals down the slides so have to walk. Ruins the day. Lots of slides and food is cheap."
166,Wow,"Great must visit place, whole day of fun, always plenty of beds, very easy to get to, No6 dolmus goes straight from centrum. Slides and pools to suit all ages. One piece of advice would be to take some gel shoes as walking around in the sun soaked tiles can burn the soles of your feet."
167,Action packed 😁,"I have been with my son (8 years old) he was amused. so much slides, good fun with dancing fountains . Day there past so quick. I bout that trip at my tour rep (Regal Holidays, Alex) and honestly it was much chipper then over there directly or a online, 33 euro for me and my son. You can attend the dolphin show at 2pm but tickets sold separately. or ask your tour rep. TIP: when you just come in, put some money on adeland card because all food or drink you can buy just with this card and it really annoys run back and forward to get this card."
168,Fun but overpriced,"Aqua park set in hillside so lots and lots of steps to climb but good slides. More signs needed to direct you to slides you are trying to get too!!! Opportunity to swim with dolphins, not cheap but well worth it, very enjoyable."
169,Good place to hang over in the summer,My children loved watching the dolphins dance and entertain us they were excellent Anyone going to Kuşadası go to adaland It’s a breathtaking experience
170,Fun slides didn't go dolphins,Dance Play Swim & have fun •••Raindance program was unforgetable and the games where very fun ... Big place with too much to do for a complete day 🍻😎👌🏼🕶👙💦🌭🍹🏄🏼⛵️🎉🎊
171,A must go to Park,"Many slides and all of them are awesome. I really liked the dark hole. There are 2 slides, which are called capsules - but they are for people who love adventures."
172,Brilliant ,"Watched the sea lion and dolphin show on 17th May, the show was great. I got a kiss off a sea lion and had a dance with a dolphin. The children had their picture taken with the dolphin and they loved it. Tip though it's far cheaper to get a taxi and pay on the door than to pay the excursion price"
173,Fantastic park ,"Great day out, lots of fun. Good deletions of snacks and drinks. They have a prepaid card system so you don't need to carry you purse around. However if you top card up by debit/credit card, they will not refund your money."
174,Holiday,Visited here last year with  teenagers and wasn't disappointed. We went there as they wanted to swim with dolphins and we weren't disappointed. Very well organised.  Great attractions. A good day was had by all.
175,Good Aquapark with Dolphin show,Good slides and not too crowded. Food was ok and not more expensive than town. Clean toilets. Not very far from the town.
176,J O'Brien ,"I couldn’t rate this water park higher, very clean and so much to do. I’m not a fan of water slides but I went on a few."
177,Amazing fun! ,"We was returned at the beginning of September after visiting in May what a difference , the whole park was open. The downfall we had to wait longer to get on some of the slides. It was very hot that day so we had to wear flip flops walking around other wise you burnt your feet on the ground . I felt like I got a work out with all the steps. But the day flew over we felt like we needed more time there. We had photos taken and they beautiful . Was a brilliant day out"
178,Great waterpark,i visited adaland in july 2017 . i had a very good day in adaland. this waterpark is amazing . they say its number1 in europe and its true. when you enter the park you face so many exciting slides and water games. wow adaland is so fun . you enjoy you laugh you scream you dance . it was my best day in kusadasi. they make you satisfied . the adrenaline degree is so high  . i suggest you to go there and make beautiful memories . good luck and have fun
179,So fun! ,"Arrived 1000am place looked great then im told cash has to be deposited on a card, easy to lose & also im given a key with no elastic or no other means to keep safe, its a yale key handed over with a gleeful smile as im told its 5TL if its lost. Turkey aw over the back is it! Slides are ok big 1s dont open until 1300??? & extra €50 to see Dolphins. Why dont yous open the good slides when park opens & bearing in mind €25 lets you access waterpark & dolphins at Aqualand Tenerife would you want to be ripped off atthis hole?? 3 rating overly generous but not anyones fault but my own the i have no patience to wait 3 hrs for a decent slide after paying near £40 pp"
180,Great day out,"It was a nice place, the water from the pools was clean, the place is nice to hang over if you are in a hot sunny day!"
181,Best day of the holiday! ,"Much smaller than you imagine, couldn’t stay for a whole day. Many slides of different varieties but long queues. Nowhere to jump from a height which would have been fun. Also, the food places aren’t the best - lots of greasy food and no nibbles like crisps etc. The locker service was free and really easy, and a shop for anything you need (we forgot towels and they were cheap to buy from the shop). The water park is half salt water so just bear that in mind!"
182,Very good,Absolutely amazing. Floor burns your feet really bad. Loads of different slides and activities. Rafting was brilliant and was only 10tl for two people. Jacuzzi was lovely and there is a pool for just swimming and relaxing.
183,Fun in the sun,"Our 12 yr old son absolutely adores this place. Great range of slides, for all abilities! Queues aren’t bad as there are so many slides. We ate at the sit-down indoor cafe where they serve meatballs, rice and salad. Tasty and good value. Great family day out!!"
184,Very good aqua park,"Great day out with something for everyone, thought it was a little expensive too swim with dolphins though especially if you have a few children"
185,dayout,"Visited  here whilst on holiday with my son an daughter. Good selection of rides to go on with and without rubber rings. Disappointed by the Crazy River, not sure what was “Crazy” about it apart from you just walked round in it. Have visited better Waterpatkd in Cyprus and Tenerife although we did have a good day, Liked the idea of the cash card to use to save carrying cash round.Photos and food were reasonably priced and queues were not long which was a surprise, worth a visit if you have a skate day."
186,Fantastic waterpark,"Covid info: We had our temperatures taken at the door, walked through a full body disinfecting tunnel (which sprays a very light mist) & had to give all of our tracing information at the entrance. In addition, everyone is made to wear a mask to get through admissions. Once inside, there are antibacterial stations everywhere & sun beds are socially distanced. All staff wore masks throughout the day. Very few customers wore masks once inside. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Regular park info: Lots of slides suitable for all ages & bravery levels! You need to add money onto a card to spend inside the park & are given the remaining balance in TL once you leave. This worked well for lunch & ice creams but the photo man said he operated in cash only? This was a bit annoying. Also, the main pool is very deep- my daughter is 5 foot tall & she struggled to stand up comfortably. Food once you are in the park is really cheap - we fed a party of 2 adults & 3 kids for less than £18!!! Views from the park are stunning. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Kuşadası. ** We booked with our hotel excursions rep."
187,Very Good Aquapark,Some amazing slides and a very well maintained and clean waterpark.Food was cheap at just over £4 for a meal deal and icecreams around 50pFloor can be very hot so take flip flops or similar.Only disappointment was that you have to pay separately for the Dolphin show.
188,Dolphins ,It should be in your program if want to be in kusadasi.it is one of tge greatest aqua oarks in the world.you will have a pleasent time there.try it
189,Great!,"Great fun, well staffed, fair priced food & drinks. Great selection of slides and pools. Bare in mind, age restriction on the slide and fly, 14 years old+ and weight restriction on the trap door type slides.Opens at 10, closes at 6pm complete fun in between"
190,good not perfect,Adaland best entertainment ever for about 60 lira or less can enjoy allinclusive  day there  with food  and soft drink with the price if you book your tickets online you get it cheaper very  good bus services  to and from adaland drops  you right  outside the  door most great fun day out for famiky
191,Dolphin Swim/Sealion/Dolphin Show,"This park is not safe, if you love your life dont go there. I went in the rides and they are old and not safe, I got hurt in one of them, I could not breath and the life saver did nothing, I got bruises all over my body because of the fall from one of the rides, hit my head. NEVER AGAIN, I did not experience the swimming with the dolphins so cant comment on that. But it was a total waste of money. When you get inside there are only a few water rides, not that fun."
192,Very rude staff,We went whilst on holiday as a surprise for our 8 year old daughter who also swam with Denis which was absolutely fantastic and worth every penny . The show was excellent and I would recommend to anyone looking to visit .we will after go again as now my wife wishes she'd have swam with the dolphins to .
193,Unexpectedly not very pleasing!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Please don't be swayed by some of the political opinions on here - adaland offers fantastic value for money and an amazing dolphin swim experience- I've been lucky enough to swim with dolphins throughout the world and the facilities at adaland are modern and extremely favourable compared to other places and the trainers seemed well informed and cared for the animals in their care- have a great time!
194,adaland,"Clean, great slides, lovely staff, well run, reasonably priced.  A day at Adaland has plenty for everyone, we will be back next year."
195,Holiday ,"Lovely day out, ordering food was a disappointment, waited ages for my order, not many slides, good lockers and safes for valuables, saw a few people hurt themselves on the slides , very clean, Life guards always on duty"
196,Amazing day,"for every entertainment and sliding game, you must get on so many steps. and too few variety for a Europe water park. i n compare of Dubai water parks like WildWady, i do not enjoy from Adaland."
197,Great,"Has to be the most scenic watermark visited! As set on side of mountain, spectacular views of Aegean and surrounded by exotic, lush countryside. Great selection of rides. Brilliant kids area. Spotlessly clean and well staffed."
198,Briliant day out!,"Fantastic water park with loads of great slides, but the highlight of the day had to be swimming with dolphins, a once in a lifetime experience i will never forget!!! It's a little expensive to do, but well worth paying the money as we got around half an hour in the water with a dolphin, got to swim & dance with her & feed her fish!!!"
199,Mrs,"While on holiday we spent the day at Adaland, we arrived at 10am before we knew it, it was already 1pm in the afternoon. So much to do lots of big fast slides and also ones for the whole family. The slip and slide looks scary but once you have tried it you will really enjoy."
200,Wow,Brilliant slides. Plenty of beds in shaded areas. Plenty of lifeguards. Changing facilities were basic unfortunately no seats to put bags on and no hanging hooks. Floor was wet all the time .
201,Brilliant ,"Good slides, we had a really good time here. My only negative feeling was based on one slide, which made a really painful injury for me. The slide,where you fly in the air, and arrive from really high. I followed all the orders, as position as how to keep my legs and hand, but after I arrived to the water it hit me so bad. The doctor said in the park, that I'm not the first one who had an accident like this, so in this case I'm wondering why there is no sign to warn people about this.Other than this, We had a good day, with lots of fun."
202,Pure talent and brilliance ,After reading so reviews I was apprehensive about taking the children here but was pleasantly surprised. Its extremely clean and not over priced on entrance fee. Also the snack bar restaurant was excellent on price and quality of food. There are loads of flames and pools and there are great areas for toddlers to play aswell.Overall an amazing time here.
203,The Largest and amazing Aqua park,Paid on the gate not sure if you get a discount booking in advance but no matter as it was still great value for money considering you can spend all day here. We took our own drinks and snacks so I can't comment on the food. The dolphin show seemed expensive but the slides etc were great fun (although some not for the fainthearted). We would go back again for sure!
204,Don't miss it,"Had a great day out there, there was only a few people there but it has not long opened for the season, was great tho had the park to ourselves so no ques, our son an us enjoyed all the slides, I found it was reasonable to eat the and the photos wasn't expensive, we enjoyed the day there, and would go again"
205,All inclusive at aqua fantasy,"Had an amazing time, the dolphins show was amazing. You need to bring your own towel. Food is not great, just to get you through the day. The rides are great, you can get as adventurous as you like."
206,Dolphin park ,Had a great day out at Adaland. My older boy loved all the water slides and my 2 younger kids had a ball in the kiddies pools. Get here early to have a whole day of fun. Also went to the dolphin show and it was brilliant!
207,trip to se do;phines very good really liked again out of season so only dolphines to see,"We didn't visit the water park as it wasn't open due to being out of season. The dolphin park was €15 each. After a hilly walk up to the waiting area we were taken into the ""stage"" area. The sea lions came out first and they were fantastic!! Very very cute. Then the dolphins came out, the host was talking is through dolphins but due to the language it was difficult to understand his English as he was talking rather fast for us to catch much. Some of it seemed a little flat but I think that was due to the size of the audience (10 people) but just when we thought it was over we were called up to the front along with a few other adults and we were given the chance to touch the dolphins!! This was a lovely touch to the end of the show proving it's not just for kids!! We would definitely go again!!"
208,Overpriced.,"We had a really great time, highly recommended. Over 20 rides kept the kids busy all day.  Food was also reasonably priced."
209,"Poor, dirty waterpark","We went a day before they closed for winter. And it was still quite busy but not overcrowded. Staff were friendly and helpful. They have some nice slides as well as diving pools, lazy river, etc. Very western. If you have lunch there you will need to get adaland magnetic card that you can prepay to (unused moneys get returned at the end of the day). All in all very good experience."
210,Great day out,"A full on day of rides, with only one ride having about a 40 minute wait time, the rest of the rides the queue was no longer than a few minutes.  Many lifeguards around, park clean, food and drink very well priced (love the waffle house!)"
211,Fantastic ,"Negatives first: Admission.... because we are foreign we got charged 240 lira (about £23) turkish nationals get charged 130 lira (about £12) can you imagine rocking up at Alton Towers and being charged almost double because you aren't English? We found this disgusting, its not something Tortuga does and it is not something Aqua Fantasy does so it clearly isnt a ""turkish thing"" this propelry p!ssed us off for the first hour of being there, almost made us want to come home, disgraceful practice.Slide and fly, there are zero warnings about the H&S aspect of this ride. It is likely you will get bruises so please god be careful on it, its great fun and if you have to do it you have to do it but ouch! Its been over a week and my bruises are yet to go.And thats it, after the first hour of being annoyed we had a fantastic day, there are so many slides and rides and pools for little ones it was amazing, we spent the morning on one side of the park going up and down the horseshoe rides and big tubes, then after lunch climibing the tower and doing the family slide and racers etc, chilling in the wave pool. For a day out it was brilliant, I think Covid helped as it was really quiet so didnt have to que for anything, not sure if I would want to be climbing those massive towers on an exceptionally busy day but all in all, there were 10 of us and we had a great day out, just need to sort out that admission because that is beyond awful, almost racist!"
212,Best experience ever!!!,there was nothing amazing. I was there last year August and we were expecting it a bit more entertaining.
213,European largest water park ,"Some equipments are very dangerous! for example, this 2 slides hurt me seriously. my arm tendon injured and when I arrived to hotel, the pain forced me to call 911 and go to the hospital with an ambulance. they should rebuilt the slides or at least, They should explain the dangers of this slides.be careful when you choosing this place an specefecly this f*uckin white slides!"
214,An Entertainment Park Suitable for All Ages,they have free transportation. The price is 70 Turkish lira. The water is not clean. stuff cannot speak English
215,Amazing Day,Nice to have everything in the one place. Nice staff. Great to have photographers get snaps of all the fun moments. They print them off so you can purchase them at the end of the day. The dancing with the water jets and dance instructer was great fun also.
216,A good place ,"So I will get to the one star rating in a bit but here are my top tips. 1. Purchase some of the swim / beach shoes (see the picturefor am example ) before you go as the floor is absolutely roasting hot and trust me on this without them you will have real issues going from slide to slide. The floor has ceramic tiles that just absorb the heat.2. It’s a cashless park so when you go in you pay a 5Tl deposit and load money onto the card. At the end if the day you get any cash loaded returned without issue. NOTE if you lie money with a credit card they will NOT refund any unspent money. 3. If it’s busy be prepared for a wait and watch the queue as the Turkish love to push in. 4. The photos taken by the photographers are like that in a cruise!!! They take your pic and then you can view them and purchase as wanted. They were 5euro each or they will do a deal of you buy loads. 5. You cannot take your own food in and as such if they search your bag and find it they will keep it until you leave. 6. Some rides have a 95kilo weight limit for health and safety (top 4 rides) and they have scales so you can’t blag your way onto the ride plus min height for some is 120cm. So why the one star? Well that’s because no matter how many times and ways I told the staff serving the burgers that my wife was allergic to tomatoes they still managed to contaminate her food and as such she had an allergic reaction.  I tried tanslate app on my phone to explain but they either didn’t care or didn’t understand either way it went wrong. A burger meal is around 22tl which gives a burger, fries and small drink. A can of coke is 10tl. They also do a small pizza for 22tl. They have free lockers and hundreds of sunbeds so no issues there. So in summary not a bad park but clearly some issues to resolve."
217,Better than the first visit,"Being honest i've been to better parks, but this does have lots to offer and price wise is good value, we went with two teenage girls and they had a ball all day.  One of the highlights was the disco with the water fountains great fun."
218,good family show,We brought our little lad to watch the dolphin show and because of the time of year no one else in it. So the staff made him feel really special they brought him up on stage he got to feed Mya and he was then shown how to get her to dance with him. He was also put into a little inflatable boat and the trainer and Mya pushed him around the pool. He loved it but would be better if more people around
219,Amazing experience ,Adaland is excellent with loads of water slides plenty of fun for kids of all ages the staff are polite and welcoming go every year
220,Great day,"We spent a day at adamant and thoroughly enjoyed it , there is plenty to do for all ages and would recommend giving it a visit"
221,Amazing experience,"Massive park, or at least felt so on the Sunday we visited, kept two teenage boys entertained all day , it did seem quiet and queued for the most about 15mins for only one ride. For £100 with transfers for 4 it was a bargain. Very recommended day out . Be advised no cash accepted inside the park and you have to setup a prepaid adaland card on arrival, any money not spent you can get back on the way out , they don’t make it hard to do."
222,Great day out,"Went in May with 3 children aged 9 and twins who are 6. My 6 year old were just over 120cm so tall enough to go on all the main slides, which they did to my amazement. The park was very quiet so meant we could go straight on every water slide without any queues. The staff were very helpful and giving directions to each slide. Very reasonable priced food and drink. Also photographers taking photos as you walked around the park and only 3 euros or 15 Turkish lira a photo. Very reasonable I thought considering what we would pay in the UK for the same. Will definitely go back next year when we visit Kusadasi again"
223,SWIM With Dolphins !!!!,Just take your swimming dress and join lot's of fun .Dont go for Rafting..It takes time and energy ^_^we paid 30 $ per person
224,Thrilling rides,"I`m now a grandmother and up to 2015 had never taken part in activities like these but my goodness what a fabulous adventure. I don't swim but I`m not afraid of water either it was magical, we were there first thing in the morning so we had very little queues to battle through, until later in the day. The only complaint I have is when coming down one slide on a tyre type of slide I was bashed up against the outer edging smashed my shoulder and back, they said nothing but the rest of my family who were waiting to come down were asked to wait almost 10 minutes while they fixed up some padding that wasn't there when I bashed up against it.   Almost 1 Year on and the shoulder is still sore. But it was very enjoyable food good , shopping good, Dolphin show also a must see."
225,**********Time for a splash**********,"Visited for fourth time, first when children were small now they are 16 years and still had a brilliant time. The water rides are great suiting all the adrenaline requirements!!!  It is a full day of fun and there is plenty of space and loungers for everyone. Buses are organised by hotels and tour operators. You can also arrange for restaurant taxis to bring and collect you free of charge once you bring a party to eat in their restaurant- we did this as we had a group of 7."
226,A wonderful relief from the intense heat,"Because  many parts were off, so I didnt enjoy so much. Of course I paid for full. I also damage alittle. Ithink some part were not standard."
227,Missing it,"It is the best Aqua Land that I have experience, Listen my advice: Please try all games and don't deny anyone, Because you will regret. Make a day with fun and excited and a lot of nice remembers"
228,Beautiful,Our first time in this park it was very good and loads to do great atmosphere over all would go back kids got on everything water a bit salty and lots of people skiping the ques staff would want to keep an eye out can cause a bit of trouble as we had see you over all good and dolphin shows are a must if your visiting
229,Wonderful. ,"We have just returned from a week in kusadasi and one day took a trip to the dolphin park. We enjoyed watching the dolphin and sea lion show first then stayed to swim with the Dolphins and it was amazing. It is always something I have wanted to do and when I found out you could at Adaland I couldn't return home without doing so! It cost approx £150 for 2 of us to swim with the Dolphins, plus entry and we also decided to buy the photographs to remember the day. It is defiantly a once in a lifetime experience and something not to be missed whilst you are there."
230,Nice day out,great day here well worth a visit food prices are not expensive entery prices are not expensive good family day
231,Fun,"Came here for the dolphin swim. We never went to the splash park so can't comment on that side. First of all the show was very entertaining, my son was lucky enough to picked to go into a boat and have the dolphin jump over him and be pulled around in the boat. He loved this! The trainers were lovely. We then went for the dolphin swim, my sister has done this before a few times and said it was the best one she's done. My son is 7 and again loved it. After the swim we purchased the photos. We decided to get the disc, with all photos on which was 80€ (personally I think it's a lot of money) but were told all the photos from when my son was involved in the show wouldn't be on the disc, we would have to pay more for those. When we explained how unfair that seemed the man who seemed to be in charge then started to talk to the girls in Turkish and make fun of us, which is absolutely disgusting. So it's their reaction and the photos price which made me leave this review. Which is a shame because they spoilt what had been a lovely afternoon. Also my mum has problems with hips and struggled to walk around inside Ada land as very hilly. Having said that the driver of the bus actually reversed so she didn't have to walk as far.It's a shame I can't score them separately. But we wouldn't go back"
232,Great for teenagers ,"Big territory, many slides. My favorite was slide and fly. It's really fun, but closes one hour before the aqua-park closes. You can also spectate a beautiful view on Kushadasi, while waiting in a que 😊🏊🏼"
233,Fun packed great day,"I went to Adaland as I had heard so many good things about it. But far from our expectation, it was so crowded, and the food service was not good and handy at all.There was no digital bracelet to buy food by it. Also there was no digital locker available like other water parks, and we had to carry the keys of our lockers with ourselves. It's funny these days if you use traditional keys to lock your lockers."
234,Fun day with water slides,I traveled to Kusadasi in September 2019.On this trip I stayed at the Fantasia Deluxe Hotel.I stayed at this hotel for a week. My stay at this hotel was enjoyable. The staff at the hotel were very friendly. The cuisine of the hotel was also of high quality.The entertainment and the animation team were also great. I appreciate TripeAdviser for his tips.
235,adaland water park,"One of my favourite attractions to visit while I'm in turkey, my 2 kids love it what a day out for all the family some amazing slides"
236,Stairs Galore ,"Dolphin show, swinming with dolphins, and aqua park. The longest run pipe slalom in the Europa..  you can reach up to speed 70 km/h.Best experienced with hero5 go pro. Awesome. Your child will be amazed... sure thing to need to do..."
237,Suoer fun day out  family of 4 only £60 with transport!,"Had a great family day here plenty of slides and diving pools etc.. hours of fun highly recommended for all ages,, food is reasonable but not great could do with more variety like aquafantasy or tortuga.For the age of the park its great but could be a little cleaner"
238,Water slides galore!,"Clean place,friendly,helpful staff speaking all languages. The slides are brilliant. Had so much fun all day. You won’t be bored it’s huge. Great for all ages. Plenty of sunbeds at all times."
239,No stopping the kids (and adults),"It was very big and beautiful with its big water games and simulations like seashore and river. It have also different water slides such as U-shape, waterfall, and Europe biggest water slide with 480 meters length."
240,many thanks,"Had a great day here with the family. Wasnt crazy expensive inside for food etc either. Would recommend going here. Only issue I had was hitting my head on one of the flames, it really hurt!! Heads down guys!!"
241,Fun day out!,It was amazingWonderful ridesinteresting and exciting Great life guardsIt was great the photographers were really professional and the food there was delicious but a bit expensiveYou have to go there
242,Swimming with the Dolphins is amazing!!,The pools are great this place is great for the kids the slides are great I went a few times I loved it
243,great value - great fun,"A lot to do, well maintained, clean, nice staff and more than decent prices! Would do again, only regrets not doing the dolphins that day, that part is too pricy (100€)"
244,Water fun,some games are very dangerous.  me and my friend both got injured and my neck and back are injured bad.never go there again
245,"Big territory, not long ques","Don't try and take any food or drink in with you, they check every single bag. We took some food for one of our children with special dietary requirements, obviously this is hard to explain and the food was taken off of us and we were given a token to collect it when we leave. It wasn't a picnic and not enough to to feed the four of us. So this didn't start our day very well. You also cannot use cash in the park you have to put money on a preloaded card. Make sure you use cash. If you use cash the deposit for the card and any money not used will be refunded, if you use a debit or credit card to load the card there will be no refunds. There are free lockers to use for any valuables. Some of the slides open at different times. We queued for 20 mins to get on the Family Slide (giant yellow rings) when we got to the top we found the delay was so they could take at least 10 pictures of each family/group going on the slide. Not acceptable. Please take some pool/beach trainers (like hot tunas) the floors get extremely hot and there are stairs everywhere. Plenty of sun beds in the shade and in the sun. Burger, chips and Cokes work out 20TLThere are picture opportunities with Parrots etc and the price per picture is 10TL but you cannot use your preloaded card to pay for these, only cash. They have a souvenir shop on site too but again you must use cash, you cannot use your preloaded card. We did have a good time and the boys enjoyed the slides they went on and the pools were nice too. They have music and water fountains on around 3pm which adults and children enjoyed. There are is a Dolphin show and you can swim with them but that is extra.Lots of improvements but it was a good day."
246,Lots of fun,Overpriced entry fees and far too busy.Expect a 30 - 50 minute wait for the biggest slides.Spent more time queuing up than actually going down the slides Food expensive for what you get never again not worth the money
247,Family trip to water park,"What a great place to have lots of fun with your family or as a couple. They have great rides and great facilities,if you are in the area you should visit this place....."
248,Kids loved it,"This was such a good day out! There were loads of slides and pools which were so fun! The idea of an Adaland card which makes the place cashless is a great idea! Everywhere is relatively cheap! There is photographers which take your photos and they are only 30TL which is quite reasonable! Also the food is reasonably cheap too considering it is a large water park! Only 35TL for a meal of a pizza chips and a drink, which works out to £5! Great day out that was safe and great for families!"
249,Fun fun fun,beautiful place we really love it specially kids love this place we going there every year few times when we are in kusadasi
250,Many rides feel unsafe,"Quite dirty, disorganized, rude staff, the main long slide was not working and they dis not care or apologized even though most people go there precisely for this attraction.I would not go back. Waste of time! Nothing special."
251,Swimming with dolphins ,Nice day off with children. I'll recommend to go during weekdays as is not busy at all. Good for kids and adults if not like beer(15 TL for 285ml) ....about £3.5  .Better to buy it from outside.
252,Very gooooooodddddddd,This was an amazing day for my family. We were picked up at the hotel and took direct to Adaland. My wife wanted to swim with dolphins and was one of her busker list things to do. Whenever we have been to previous shows in other countries it has cost in excess of £300 to swim. At Adaland £80. You watch the show which is truly great and they get the audience to join in. Then after the show you go with a trainer who guides you through the experience. If swimming with dolphins is something you want to do I highly reccomend this.
253,AMAZING!!!!!,"Absolutely brilliant day out that didn’t break the bank. Although there was a lot of walking involved and your feet get burned the whole day was fun, the food was average but not expensive and the queues weren’t too long for the slides."
254,Good,"When you arrive you given a top up card to load cash onto as nowhere in the park accepts cash.  You soon realise that this is not the case, the photos that are taken only accept cash as does the dolphin attraction.  This is quite inconvenient when you have topped up the card, put all your things in a locker to then find out you have to go back to the locker to get money out after you have already walked to the dolphin show!  We watched the Dophin show and decided to swim with them afterwards, this cost £80 per person for a 20 minute swim.  Your photos are taken throughout and then you have the option to buy them afterwards.We visited Adaland as part of an excursion from our hotel, we arrived at just after 10am, so we had an hour or so in the pools before lunch and then the Dolphin show started at 2.30 by the time this finished and we had swam with them it was time to go home.  It was a very rushed day, perhaps better to make your own way there and back."
255,Absolutely! This place will guarantee you 100% fun in Kusadasi area.,Visited here on 24th of June. Family with 3 kids one teenager an 11 and 10 year old. They all enjoyed it as did we. Food reasonably priced. Would recommend this waterpark to anyone.
256,Floor was too hot!,"So, the language barrier is a little tricky but you manage. You arrive and you have to put some money into a card, that's how he accept payments. Once you're done you go to the changing rooms where you've got to write your name on a piece of paper and you'll get a key for the locker. Once changed and sun cream on you're free to swim and walk you please. I'd strongly suggest before you do anything, go to the shop and get some rubber shoes, you can wear these in the pool but you don't realise how hot the tiles get, so purchase some shoes!! If you're a little worried about slipping or unsteady  on your feet, the ride staff will help you on. Everyone is so polite and more than helpful. Some have really good English! You then (if you want) get your photo taken with a gorgeous Macaw parrot with a Captain Jack Sparrow impersonator. That was awesome! Well worth the trip!"
257,Average,"We went here as a family in April 2017, although it was Easter holidays this place was completely empty. Just us and another couple. We stayed for the dolphin show and the kids got to meet the staff and dolphins and have photos taken. It was a nice hour or so."
258,Always A Good Day,EXCELLENT park for people of all ages....Dolphin show is a must...Overall well worth the money.Any money you dont spend on the card you can claim back....
259,World of wonder,"Adaland is super fun aqua park and located not too far from the city of kusadasi. Reasonably priced per person- 110TL- included most things in the park. Only thing was the swim with dolphins and something else we didn’t do. Warning- this place is not built to USA spec. Adults should examine the each ride before they let their young children go down the slides.There were a couple where I followed the instructions from the staff and still bruised an ankle and my bum.Recommend aqua shoes and goggles for rides. The walking surface sometimes gets very hot and the slides create so much splash you can’t see where you are going. Take some cash with you as you have to buy one of their park cards to purchase food. You put money on the card then you can purchase from the vendors inside. Prices are a little high, as all places like this are, but the food was decent."
260,Ticked something off bucket list,Well this was meant to be a show however it seemed at points the staff didn’t know what they where doing or what was happening. Luck it was cheap. At least kids enjoyed watching the mishaps.
261,Have fun,"Visited adaland last week. Me and the missus had a good day. Found the entrance fee a little too pricey. Around £28 each and then you have to pay an extra €8 for the dolphins show, and another 10tl if you want to take pictures. Also you have to pay 10tl for the rapids. Other than that... Yeh it was good day. 7/10 for me. Entrance tickets should be about £10 cheaper each and then you don't mind paying the extra for the dolphins and rapids ect ect. Don't let this put you off though. We still had a fun day on the slides."
262,Omg,We suffered some injoury and there we're too many others with minor one.Its two dates that my head and tongue! Have some problem!
263,OK very expensive inside ,"It was too bad that the park was so empty. I guess the park is based on thousands of people a day. And I guess we were with about 40 people that day. They had a lot of slides, really fun though. A lot of rough ones. By every slide there was someone to help you and guard the slide. But there is only one place to eat, and you can only get a burger or cheeseburger. It was actually really expensive for what you get. MacDonalds is way better. And it´s your only option..."
264,Adaland ,"We had a great day here! So many different pools and slides. Such great fun! The water coaster especially was great! Also loads for kids to do. Food and drink were really reasonably priced inside too! The floor did get quite hot to walk on, but they were trying to hose it down where possible. I would definitely recommend a trip!"
265,Amazing place,"Qualified personnel, good list of services (internal cash card, procedure of card-balance management, food courts etc)And the main... Very cool slides for all of ages.Thank's for a good time in your aquapark."
266,The best Ever,"This place is a must visit for you and your family. KIDS will love it!Just be ready to pay for your food and extras like dolphine shows, or swimming with the dolphines."
267,Brilliant,Whatever you do don't arrive when the park opens; it's a free-for-all for the locker keys and resembles a melee rather than an organised queueing system.   Best to arrive after 11.30 or so. Aside from that there are some great rides and it's well worth the admission price.
268,Please assemble escalators,"Enjoyed our day at Adaland - plenty to do and lots of fun. When you get in you can put your belongings in a free locker or pay 5lira for a safe. You have to put cash onto an Adaland card which you use around the park and at the end of the day you get any unspent cash back (5lira deposit taken). There are loads of sunbeds around the park and plenty of areas to sit. The park has a lot of different waterslides, the walk up to them is very tiring and long however they are good fun. The long coaster was good and the slide and fly was fun to watch but looked scary!! Not many queues for the rides which was a bonus. Lots of lifeguards all around the park. The lazy river would have been better if it had had rubber rings to float around on but it was okay. We ate at a fast food cafe - it was 21 lira for a burger, chips and coke. It was an average meal. The rain dance was great fun. We decided to go to the Seapark/Dolphin park. The aquarium wasn't anything special, just a few fish and a turtle. The tropical reef pool was lovely but thought it would have been warm. We were disappointed as the tropical lazy river and slides were closed. The beach was so quiet and relaxing but we ran out of time as we had paid to see the Dolphin show (12 euro each). The show was amazing and worth the money. It was an hour show and the dolphins were fantastic. The show was interactive and organised really well. Overall the whole day was fab, if we had more time we may have been able to go on more rides and try the rafting. The park was bigger than I expected. It was clean and the staff were friendly. It was worth the money because there was lots to do and see. I would go back. Its a great day out for families."
269,very funny,"Slippy floors loads of slopes my kids fell over so many times it was unbearable, the slides are all up in the gods, takes you 10mins to catch your breath with all the stairs to each slide! The one positive thing was the small children’s but is excellent!"
270,WORTH TO SEE,"Fantastic day out. Mid August and not overly busy. Plenty of time to go on each slide Several times. Biggest queue was family slide. 20 mins. Best slide by far was the trap door. Kids loved it. Plenty of food options. The rain dance session was unique and great fun. One word of warning, do not take a pack lunch, it will be taken from you. Load the park credit card with money to save you carrying cash around. You can only purchase photos with cash!!Awesome day out"
271,Amazing park ,"Lots to do in this huge water park. Pools, chutes, slides, canoeing, you name it. It was relatively busy when I was there and the only down side was having to queue for the main attractions. Dancing in the water jets is a must. I didn’t see the dolphin show ( that was extra) approx £20 a head included transport. All in all good value for money 🤓"
272,Full option aqua park,Brilliant day out with the family at a superb water park.  Things to do for all ages and reasonably priced fast food places to eat. Would recommend to anybody who visits Kusadasi.
273,Dolphin show ,"The kids loved it here , they had the energy to run around the massive park trying every water slide on offer , a full day of thrills for them , I found it very expensive for the food drinks etc , especially when you have to pay to accompany the kids at full price so I would recommend if you haven't the energy or inclination to trek and queue for at least half an hr on every slide just drop the kids off and go somewhere else for the day"
274,Brilliant lots for all ages,"We went as a family, mainly because the kids wanted to do so. We didn't count the slides but I am told there are 27. We booked the trip with our Thomas Cook rep Sam who told us everything we needed to know.Inside you get a card instead of carrying money 5tl deposit and then you add money to it to spend in the water park for food and drinks etc. What was nice is that any money you don't spend you get back at the end.There was lockers and changing rooms, toilets were clean and the photographer was lovely.For a family it a great way to spend a day out of the hotel just remember to take your suncream"
275,Great fun for all ages,Myself and my son enjoyed every minute...... hated leaving definitely got to visit if you go to Kusadasi
276,Wonderful day out!!,Been to over 20 different water parks over the years and this was probably the best so far. Well set out easily accessible very friendly and knowledgeable staff throughout. Not like other water parks with whistle happy jobsworths. Over 20 slides ranging from your toddler slides to your thrill seaker rides. Also a chance at a cost of swimming with dolphins at a fee which our granddaughter did and was great value for money. Free lockers and plenty of changing facilities. No need to carry money as you need to get a card to put money on for use at all the catering facilities but these are reasonably priced and decent quality for such a facility.
277,perfect plecae,thıs ıs wonderful place really very bıg and crowded ı m perfect time whit my family see you next year
278,Great day out,Excellent day out with lots of slides and pools to try out.Word of warning when it is very hot you need to wear something on your feet that you can keep on for the rides.
279,Very nice,Yup. Best trip of the holiday. Loved the whole day there. Great rides and a fab day had.The free lockers were a blessing No need to say any more .. Do it!
280,Dangerous,Dont go if youre not able to walk well all paths are very steep and with lose stones so not disabled friendly. But the kids had a blast they loved the slides and the dolfin show. Shame is that you had to pay for everything seperate.
281,It was fun,Very low quality and unsafe. The operator don’t know about the time and can’t help you. Wave pool is very Ridiculous! Most of items are close at start of season. Don’t advise you to go. Waste your money ...
282,A++++,Huge place and a lot of fun. Enjoyed every second. Very beautiful area. I absolutely loved it there.
283,amazing experience,"I really enjoyed there.I think it was very safe. If you obey staff advice , you won't be injured.you should get a card at first and charged it. If you bye a swimming shoes , you can use it for all area and in the pool also.because walking without shoes is a little hard.I recommend this Aqua park very much.we enjoyed a lot there.there was a doctor stayed neer the main door, and he gave me a pill for my headache free.he kindly test my blood pressure free too.you can bye this tour from the city cheaper than tour leaders who stay at hotels."
284,Good,"The wife and I and the two teenage kids had one of the best days ever here.We were super impressed with the security i.e getting in and losing our card, monitoring and tracking, lifeguards and guidance.My wife enjoyed the Zumba in the water jets, which was packed, the drinks were so cheap as was the food - £4 for burger, chips and drink is unbeatable as well.  Also there's alcohol available, but be careful!The slides are well-guided and easy to find, with assistance from staff.Also there was a massive selection and it took us the whole day to get round everything, with a bathe in between.My wife and one of the kids said the dolphin show was great and they got up and danced and were really impressed with it.  Cost less than £12pp.Tickets for the park were £15 ish as well.Slide and Fly is by far the best (and most scary), the flumes are really fast, so work your way up the scale, the rafting and rubber ring rides are more lazy than thrill.The place was very clean and everybody seemed to be having a good dime.  There are parrots to pose with, the photographers were great and enthusiastic, the lifeguards were sharp to pull people up on issues, its burkini-friendly, kid-friendly, elder-friendly and sun-god friendly!Take the sun lotion of course.  The floors can be pretty warm if barefoot and slippery as expected like everywhere hot and wet.  The roads there and back are windy and also need to be careful there as well, couple of nice beaches nearby and Ephesus not too far away either.Wave machine was a little disappointing but relaxing all the same."
285,A fantastic day out for all ages,"The slides are insane...really fun! Definitely go and visit, it's so nice to chill in be massive pools. :)"
286,Great family day out,Nothing special here. No comparison to Siam park in Tenerife or the one in Abu Dhabi but was still a good day out. The kids pools are good with plenty of slides. For the older ones again there is lots of choice. The sky and fly slides are definitely for the brave. Food reasonably priced. No money allowed inside. You have to load cash onto a card. Any money left over they give you back in cash. Lockers are tiny. Changing rooms ok. Be sure to do some dancing in the water feature near the restaurants. Wouldn't rush to come back unless the kids wanted to. Lots of sun beds around. Quite hilly
287,Disappointed and delighted,Nothing has ever made me want to go to water parks. I’ve missed out. Loved this place. Paid £20 per person for entry and transfer which was 1.5 hours away. I don’t know if that is reasonable as have no comparison. I was prepared to be the belongings watcher but wanted to join in! Lazy river wasn’t that lazy. (I’ve seen inbetweeners 2!!) I was duped into going on a ride. So glad I was! Loved it. Went again and again. Free lockers. 5 lira for a safe. Food reasonably priced. Wasn’t overcrowded. Plenty of sunbeds in the shade and sun. Lovely big swimming pool. Great fun dancing in the water jets to live music.  Many lifeguards around. I wish I had taken my sea shoes with me. Can only go bare feet on rides unless your footwear straps on your feet. Ground was so hot it’s was painful at times.
288,Waterpark fun for all,This  is second time that i go Adaland with my family.This aqua park is big with various facility.Travelers should get chipper ticket from travel agency.
289,Overpriced and just an avarage waterpark,"Went with wife, four kids, mum and dad. First of all don't take your own food and drink as they search everyone on entry and remove it from you so that you buy the terrible, cold food they sell at their cafe. Once we had been searched we found our spot for the sun loungers and went straight for the slides, exited with the anticipation of the thrills to come. It didn't happen. We were turned away from the bigger slides and told that they were not open until 1pm. No rafting as it was closed which disappointed my mum who is close to retirement and quite frankly couldn't really handle anything else. Wave pool not open until 11:30 so spent the first few hours with not much to do. Don't bother trying to complain because they are not interested unless you are parting with even more money. When the slides did open the were fun and very entertaining. The dolphin show is really good with opportunities to have photos taken with the dolphins at the end at more cost. Costs about 25 pounds per person to get inand if you want to take your own photos you have to buy a wrist band for 10 lira. Don't try talking in pounds or lira because they are only interested in talking euro which just over complicates things. Would not visit again as its a rip off, however, it may be different at peak season."
290,Amazing,"A little bit scary for some people, but such good fun once you throw yourself down them! Perfect for kids - kids pool/ mini slide area too Take lots of sun cream They do dolphin shows which actually look very well maintained, clean and the dolphins seem very happy."
291,Nothing open and overpriced ,"Everything seems outdated. Very careless the toilets were dirty, and the smell was pretty stingy. I do not recommend."
292,Amazing!,"We didn't really know what to expect, however Adaland definitely exceeded our expectations - it was fantastic!My boyfriend and I were the only two English people there that day at that time for the dolphin show, as the amphitheatre was full of excited Turkish school children from various schools on a school trip - yet the staff of Adaland spoke in Turkish and English for the demonstrations and explanations which we greatly appreciated! It was so interesting and entertaining. The dolphins and Marco the sea lion were very happy and well loved and looked after. Great visibility for the crowd and spacious enclosure for the animals. The trainers and the animals are so talented! Would definitely recommend Adaland to anyone!"
293,Loved the show,We vere been today there.Amazing area wth amzing wiew.All activites are spectacular.We didnt understand how we spend our time there.Just hamburger is quite of small.Prefere you to bring there some food and beverage.Personels are quite kindly and young even if they apply very bad salary.There is almost all around in Turkey like slave workes.But the boys are very kindly and quite careful about safety.Kuşadası realy have amazıng wiev with all place just in center arabic and kurdish shopkeepers are deceitfuly so better to spent time in hotel or any closed aquaparks.İts make the tourism in Kusadası very bad.Prefere to all one visit kuşadası but just in all inclusive hotels and visit to Adaland.İf you have child it ll a unbelievle present to visit Adaland.....
294,Dolphin Show,Very good time. Food is bad. Drink so much water. Protect your skin form sun burn. Smiling in picture and looking too camera.... have good tme.
295,Water babies dream! ,"I am 52 and swimming with dolphins was my oldest wish. Finally, I have done it!!!!Staff is great, my Allegro is gorgeous, everything is clean, well organized and I was flying for days :D   THANK YOU GUYS 😘"
296,Bad experience,This is my second attempt to submit a review. My first one was rejected because I was critical of the dolphin show. I'm not sure how I can tell the truth if trip advisor does not permit candid reviews. I do not recommend this place.
297,Very nice water-park. it would have been perfect if they did have all the attractions open.,We was yesterday with my girlfriend and we have amazing day expectly on raftling its work from 14:45 to 15:45I suggest everyone who come to kusadasi to visit this akvapark.
298,Holiday,Do not bother coming here unless you are Turkish! I was overcharged just for the fact that I am british. For 1 adult and 1 child I was charged 183 lira but had I been Turkish I would have only paid 90lira. Absolutely disgusting that after bring tourism and money to the country we are charged even more
299,For all age groups,Very nice place but after a couple of hours it's all the same all over again. Some of the attractions were closed.
