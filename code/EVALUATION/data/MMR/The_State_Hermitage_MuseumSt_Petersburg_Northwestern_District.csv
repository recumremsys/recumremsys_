0,Spectacular city of St Petersburg of grandeur and antiquities,"We were very intrigued with the spectacular views of grand heritage buildings and churches with colourful domes of St Petersburg. We couldn’t take our eyes off the opulent buildings lining both sides of the Neva River. We were awed by the extravagant exhibits in the museums backed with interesting and descriptive information from our wonderful local tour guide, Marina, who spoke English well. Hermitage Museum, Peterhof Palace and Pushkin’s Catherine Palace are not to be missed. We had 3 funtastic memorable days touring St Petersburg, well taken care of by local guide Marina who was thoughtful in organising and maximising visits to the impressive itineraries. Highly recommend Marina Slobozhaninova, contactable at slobozhaninovamd@mail.ru  or  +7911 123-80-89  She has good command of English. She’s attentive to our safety and enjoyment under her wings."
1,A  must vist for every fan of the arts,"My view of the summer palace got completely changed after visiting the palace.The museum has got rich collection of history and a day is not enough to see even 30% of the collectionsI strongly recommend, it is worth to see once in a life time"
2,Too big to enjoy,"In St. Petersburg you will have to visit this museum. It is huge and the known objects, like the peacock are really worth a look."
3,Tour guide couldn't be more vague,Of course we visited the Hermitage. Incredible the greatness of this place and its history. We bought the audio guide tour in the Apple shop on line. Fantastic experience!
4,Not enough time for all!,"We and our kids spend almost 3 hours in the hermitage, the kind were really impressed by all the beautiful rooms. As soon they got bored we slowly moved to the exit.Very nice!"
5,Fantastic,"Beautiful architecture. Not expensive tickets, perfect for seeing the history of Russia. Very royal objects. Very beautiful."
6,Absolute must-do while in St.Peterburg,"We had an amazing experience taking in the beauty, opulence, architecture and paintings. The Prodigal by Rembrandt was a must see for us and we were not disappointed! It was larger than we expected and we could take as long as we wanted.One review recommended the cafe in the General Staff building, so we collected our coats, rugged up and crossed the square. Our ticket covered that building. We wanted to see the Impressionist paintings anyway. The cafe there had tasty, generous servings and the best mushroom soup! Thanks for the tip!"
7,Virtual Tour of the Hermitage,Several Rooms and Paintings.Sculptures as well as icons. Loved the outer pillars. Humanoid structures supporting the roof.
8,Wonderful museum,The Museum itself is in the Winter Palace as well as four other amazing buildings that are all attached.  Our guide mentioned she had to study for a month and pass an exam to qualify as a tour-guide of this place! It is beyond the pale experience.
9,"Fleeting visit, enough to whet the appetite!",The whole of Romanov dynasty that made modern Russia is depicted here with exquisite art work and paintings.It’s a must do activity to know about the Russian history from the time Tsar Peter the great moves the capital to St. Petersburg from Moscow which stood till the October 17th revolution
10,Hermitage,Amazing museum with such a number of chefs d’œuvre !And the palace is really beautiful !Then the other part which is more modern contains a collection of paintings we’d never seen! A really nice day in the Ermitage
11,Precious museum,"You needs a day or two to see this place. It is spectacular but criminals target tourists in St. Petersburg and I would not recommend visiting St.Petersburg due to the criminal activity there. We were robbed and it was so well organised, the criminals are professionals. I would recommend Yekaterinburg or Novosibirsk of Irkutsk, even Moscow over going to St. Petersburg."
12,WOW!,"We visited in winter, it was easy accessible. The winter palace surrounded by snow was magical!  Chilly outside, so make use of the cloakrooms. This is a vast museum, residence and art collection in one!Think Versailles&Louvre in one breath! Allow yourself enough time to admire. The floors, walls, ceilings, light fittings, curtains, and then there is art! Remember the BC collection on the ground floor... it is mind boggling to see that great artifacts are part of this collection. But after a few hours in here, vodka and comfort food is a must!"
13,Absolutely beautiful,This had so many wonderful things to see. We loved the Peacock Clock and were awed by this immense palace. Problem....it is so crowded that you can't always get close to what you want to see
14,Fantastic but don’t waste your time on the Peacock Clock,"Huge and impressive, much like the rest of St Petersburg, could spend hours visiting this immense museum. Quite busy even in January, but worth it , good value."
15,Unique experience,The huge collection of the Hermitage is impressive. We visited the Winter palace and the Staff building. For us the impressionist collection in the Staff building was amazing.The winterpalace itself is a beautiful palace but unfortunately the various rooms were not explained at all. In various  Art in the room was disturbing; the roomS were beautiful and the art was distracting
16,HUUUUUUUGE museum.....Challenge you see it all.,"We visited this magnificient art museum and palace - it is literally full of art works that it is simply not possible to see it all in one day. We had the foresight to book a tour (my wife and I were alone) and on the day and time we duly found Ms Alyona waiting for us who took us directly to the main entrance without us having to wait in a queue. She was very well versed in all that there was to see, and explained all to us in very good comprehensible EnglishWe were impressed by her very good knowledge of where the works which we wished to see were located especially the one and only Caravaggio - It did not take long for us to realise that we were in very good hands and we spent four hours of viewing, admiring and enjoying both the beauty of the art works themselves as well as the beauty of the Palace itself.The Tsars certainly had very good taste as far as art is concerned.Thank you very much Ms Alyona and Ulko Tours for rendering our visit a memorable one - ray"
17,"Well-preserved interiors and excellent collections , a pearl on the map of Russia",Very beautiful museum/palace inside and outside! You need to check this out if you are in St. Petersburg.
18,Highlight of our trip,The best museum and historical miracle I have seen in my life before. It is very big and planned. You can follow the monuments in historical schedule at museum . The best work art
19,A MUST!!!,"This museum is like nothing I've ever seen before! The beautiful art works displayed amongst the grandeur of Catherine's Winter Palace is breathtaking and mindblowing at the same time....each room you enter is more grand than the next...you hardly know where to look first!We were lucky enough to do a roughly 3 hour guided night tour of the Hermitage (an on-shore cruise excursion)...we were basically the only group in the entire museum so could get up close to the exhibits without the crowds and make our way through more of the rooms to optimise our experience there...it was the perfect way to see what in reality was just a snippet of this entire place. No matter whether you're an art lover or there just to see the opulence of the Tsar's era...this is a MUST DO....crowds or not, this museum would be worth the wait!!!"
20,A must visit,Beautiful museum and gorgeous building. Sadly we only had half a day so could only see a fraction of the exhibits.
21,Must-Do in Saint Petersburg!,Charming esperience. Please go also the next front door Palace which has collections from Impressionism to Fauves.
22,Hernitage,"The Hermitage Museum is fascinating. There were rooms of different royal architectural style showing the extreme opulance of the former Tsars and Tsarinas. But what we found very fascinating when we had enough of the opulance, was the excellent exhibition halls on ancient Asia and Siberian culture. The ancient mellow frescoes were beautiful as were artifacts from burial mounds or kurgans. These included a horse buried with its warrior king. The ancient textiles and domestic objects were beautiful and though there was not a huge amount of English there was enough to understand what it all was and you can always follow up after if you want. Photography was allowed and guides and Russian public who spoke English also tried their best to give more information. It was a welcome quiet corner of a very busy museum."
23,BIG,"Couldn’t imagine the wealth of items inside its walls! Beautifully presented.with respect to their history everyone should visit! Use the audio guide as it helps a lot! Impressive, regal and unique! Give it ample time, then go opposite to see the paintings and around the corner to see Peter the firsts home, all with the same ticket!"
24,Horrible employees,"Wonderful museums, with a huge collection of paintings, and several buildings, however, the excessive crowd, very long queues and the security procedure are just frustrating."
25,Mesmerising,"Great city, great architecture. Worth visiting for 100%. Feeling you will have staying on the Palace square are impossible to describe. Need to come and to try. The Hermitage inside is one of the world masterpieces."
26,Huge museum,The Hermitage is a major reason one should visit St Petersburg. The museum was a palace so this is a big part of the story of the place. We loved the Rembrandt paintings as well the peacock clock. One could spend days there and only skim the surface. Please note there impressionists are in another building. The gift shop is terrific.
27,Amazing,You cannot visit St. Petersburg without seeing the Hermitage.  You can spend all day touring the large museum or like us getting our tickets at 4:30 when it closes at 6 and run through with a map and see the highlights.  Not expensive to tour. Different options.  Loved it.
28,Museum is a must see,The Hermitage provides many workds of art that one only ready about. The museum is so massive to really take it all in you need several days (maybe weeks) to tour and appreciate. It is also crowded so be prepared to walk at a shuffle in many part but that is okay since there is so much to see.  Be sure to have a map so you can find your way out.  Best advise is to slow down and take in all of the sights.  A guide book or app for the Hermitage would proove helpful  I ail go again and again and again.
29,"One of the ""must sees""","massive cause the palace is massive, there’s more than 200 rooms and the colours are amazing, the externals are great."
30,So big to be tired,"Hermitage is one the greatest museums I have ever visited, it really impressed me a lot, wonderful Da Vinci, Rembrandt... Spectacular! Reccomend to take tickets in a ticket machine, no lines, no stress, only 700 rub."
31,Owsome,"Amazing place, visited during the evening so a lot less people and it’s just amazing. Lots of beautiful art work at the building is incredible. Can’t recommend enough"
32,Massive experience ,"The grand facade of the Hermitage Museum along with the Tsar's Winter Palace built on the huge expanse of the Palace Square is the most majestic icon of St Petersburg, Russia. Situated on the embankment of river Neva on one side, this a place which no tourist can afford to miss.The building complex comprises of the Winter Palace of the erstwhile royals, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage,  New Hermitage and Hermitage Theatre, which are usually frequented by the tourists.This is the second biggest museum of art collections after Louvre in Paris.The collections run into millions. One gets mesmerized looking at the exquisite paintings and art works by the masters.Going through the entire museum complex gallery after gallery can easily take a whole day."
33,"A Must Do, when in St.Petersburg","Feels impossible to see the whole collection in one day. We spend 3 hours just visiting the Dutch artist hall and then some highlights like the golden clock.It would probably take days to see everything. To skip the lines, buy your tickets at one of the machines."
34,The Hermitage is Magical!,A must when visiting St. Petersburg!An incredible place with so many different things to look at.To think that the place was for one family makes you wonder.The exibited objects from all over the world and the different rooms in one place
35,Wow!,"This place is huge to fully walk around. There is a massive collection of fine art work from all of the Grand Masters, with I believe has the largest collection of Leonardo De Vinci's work anywhere. You either need to spend a full day walking around here or try to pick and chose what you want to see.The cloakroom was packed solid with tourist when we came to leave, badly needs better organizing somehow.It is well worth a visit when in Saint Petersburg."
36,Buy tickets online to skip the lines,"Stunning collections of art pieces! I walked around for over 4 hours to visit most of the highlighted rooms.This is surely a MUST visit in Saint Petersburg. The structure and decoration of rooms are truly luxurious, elegant and beautiful. Historical art pieces have been kept and showed throughout the year. Never to miss this!"
37,Unforgettable experience ,This is a definite must see when visiting St Petersburg. The vastness of how enormous & jam packed opulence is just jaw dropping. Wear proper walking shoes as this museum is really big with sooooooooo much to see. 3 levels of incredible artifacts so carefully taken care of. This will take you a full day to see. There is a coffee shop downstairs to take a break & if traveling with small children the bathrooms are all on the lower level & very far from most things. Prepare well. Navigate the various inter leading rooms with the numbers at the top of the doors so you can see where you are on the map so not to miss anything & also find the stairs to the different levels. The babushka’s are friendly with no English & try their very best to assist you. And incredible experience
38,a must,"I think one the best attraction of St Petersburg, State Hermitage Museum. I found it amazing. First, it size...unthought of. You need lots and lots of time to see it completely. An art and antique lover can spend as time here as he / she wants. The building has many halls each with different type of art, culture and history related items. Very diverse collection. Its so huge that we could hardly cover 10-15% of it in nearly 3 hours. But it has so many things to attract. If you have a passion for history and art, go early in morning and spend your full day. For a random traveler like me, going any time and spending 2-3 hours would be enough. But dont miss it."
39,Wonderful,"We visited The Hermitage Museum as part of our 2 days with Alla Tours. We went in early to avoid the crowds. An amazing collection of art from around the world. We spent 2 hrs there, you could spend a month and not do it justice. Our guide Roman was very well informed and made the visit very interesting. A fleeting visit, highly recommend."
40,The heart of St Petersburg,This place is incredible. A maze of art and historical records. You can wonder around at what ever pace you are comfortable. There is an audio system available to help describe special features. These pieces are invaluable. But the painting collection is exquisite.
41,Amazing palace,"Hermitage museum is gigantic in all aspects, huge in size and endless of items to look at. We bought tickets online and used the separate entrance, very smooth and fast. More than 300 rooms filled with history and items. We enjoyed the museum and are impressed of all items, on top of that it also carries a lot of history - a must visit attraction!"
42,An amazing place!,We were on a guided tour for 3 hours. This worked well as we did not get lost and saw highlights of the collection. Some amazing pieces and also the history of the rooms and the palace - walking in the steps of the tsars!
43,The State Hermitage Museum,We visited this great museum with a local company. We were impressed how much unique pieces of art this museum keeps. The history of this museum is amazing. I recommend everybody who comes to Russia visit this museum.
44,A huge museum that gives you a big experience.,"Is not only the building, the art inside, is the history, the surroundings, everything. You can spend at least one day inside, if you love art two. You can walk everyday, cross the river, stay at the front and talk with locals"
45,One of the world's greatest art museums.,"Beautiful museum on Neva riverbank, consist off several buildings including Winter palace with vivid colors and stately architecture. Guide and audio guide is must have. Very nice Jordan staircase and winter garden from Catherine the Great. Interesting peacock clock gift of Potemkin to Catherine. Great collection of Rembrandt, flemish painters,Matisse, Gauguin, Monet, Cézanne and Renoir. Also Raphaels and Jupiters hall off sculptures. At a time both of Leonardos paintings including Litta Madonna, was in Florence, but even without it there is lot of others. Crowd is constant, but reasonable."
46,"A must to visit, and plan well ahead","Magnificent old palace that contains artifacts and art from BC days. There are so many rooms it is unlikely you will be able to see them all but those you do see are spectacular in respect of their opulence.Tip is to buy your ticket as you enter, machine on right hand side, to save lining up. Coats are to be left in the cloak room so leave them there before starting the visit, it will save you time."
47,Almost too good,Excellent Museum with All the Beautiful Collections. Tour Guide Marina From ULKOtours was vey Hospitable and Knowledgeable.
48,Heremitage,"The museum is contained in a massive complex of old palaces. The buildings are absolutely lovely and there is so much to see. One visit is never going to be enough. However, you can take a break at the cafe on the ground floor to recharge your cells!"
49,An amazing experience,The Hermitage is a museum on a very grand scale and contains superb works of art. Centrally located in St Petersburg it is accessible and should not be missed.
50,Beautiful architecture,"Very big palace with more than millions items/collections to see. It is a must place in the city, however pls note that if you are not fan of arts and history, it can be boring/overwhelming for you"
51,Overwhelming,"The biggest museum I had ever seen! Nobody can visit this museum in one day, like a maze, absolutely need to a guide."
52,World-renowned Museum,"Nice museum, must see if you are visiting the city. In front of the museum there are few machines where you can easily get tickets and avoid unpleasant staff. I expected more. Building is amazing, I never seen so much marble and things from malachite. For me the building was more impressive than the museum exhibits. Two tips. First don’t count on the map. It’s extremely confusing. I saw almost all important museums in Europe and this one has the worse map ever. Don’t get surprised if you jump from room 15 to 129. Some rooms you can access just thru stairs and it’s not so obvious. Also it’s difficult to find room number. If you ask for help in English...well good luck. Second not everything is translated to English so if you are really interested in exhibition get an audiobook."
53,Lucky we are staying for 1 week,All museums tells about history and culture and this is not different. Only to find that this tells about this part of world. I have been to many museums: large and small.But this one was huge. Opulence was everywhere right from the entrance.I am sharing few of pics...Enjoy.....!!!
54,With a group,Everything in conection with this museum is extraordinary. I was impressed and I could stay there for days. It couldn't possibly be described. I have been in most famous museums in the world but this is my favorite.
55,Terrible cloakrooms and worst customer service ever!,"We visited this world famous must see museum as part of a guided tour which included the amazing gold room, which is worth the cost of the visit in itself. I would however give a couple of tips; when visiting the main museum; don't bother with a guided tour as they have a idea about what you want to see that may be very different from your interests; also arrive early or end up queueing for ages. In spite of it getting very crowded and the rooms that the tour guides highlight becoming rammed the rest of the museum can be relatively easy to walk round."
56,Hermitage,"This palace like any other large building is perhaps too much for one day visit. We bought tickets online and found out there is a separate entrance on side street to get in. Visit in February was a good timing as it was rather cold, rainy and grey weather out side. Decorations are just massive and there so many details in the decoration and the interior. I'd say interior design and decorations are perhaps more interesting that the art pieces in this building. With the same online ticket there is another art museo across the square with some great pieces from Matisse, Picasso, Monet etc."
57,Overwhelming!,It’s a great museum plenty of elements for all tastes and would be much better with little more organization of the journey along the many galleries. For instance short time visits could be more focused on certain aspects rather than letting the visitor deciding at random where to go.
58,Nice ,This place is massive and spread through several buildings. Not possible to see it all in one visit or even several visits. Arts and treasures throughout and is a must visit when in St Petersburg.
59,"Nice museum, annoying queue",This is a great museum but overwhelming in size. We spent about 2 hours with our guide and we barely scratched the surface. There were tremendous crowds which made it hard and it is the end of the season! But definitely worth the trip. Don’t miss it.
60,This is a fabulous Museum,"This former palace is decorated in a style you would expect from a very grand palace, one would almost feel sorry for our Queen having to live in such a hovel!It is full of works of art by famous painters, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Botticelli, Canaletto and many more.  The surroundings are magnificent.  The only problem is you would never have enough time to look at everything.  It was very busy and if you stayed too long at a particular painting then you lost your guide as parties of other tourists filled the gap between you and your guide.  I was separated from my party and rang my husband who asked where I was, never have I been able to give directions such as I did that day.  'I am standing at the top of a grand staircase I can see an enormous picture by Rembrandt of The Return of the Prodigal Son and I am standing next to a malachite urn that is twice my height!I was surprised that the Russian authorities allowed natural light to stre3am onto the paintings, which did make getting a decent photograph difficult.I am still processing what I saw and am definitely going back one day."
61,So much more than art!,"This is an unblievable collection of art, jewelry, Fabrege and pieces in an amazing building. The architecture outside is deceiving as it is almost plain compared to the interior. Room after room of  gold leaf, fantastic decorating, inlaid flooring and more. Don't miss it."
62,GetYourGuide 'Beat the queue' guided tour.,Our Winter Palace visit was filled with gold and jewel encrusted everything and we could not be more impressed.  Standouts included the giant urns made of semi precious stone mosaics and treasures brought in from Western Europe and Asia.  The museum was full of works by masters I had not seen or known about.  Wonderful!
63,Huge ,"This museum, aside form being located in an incredible palace of the Czars, has one of the largest collections of art, artifacts and other treasures from Imperial Russia. One of the main reasons for coming to St. Petersburg is to visit the Hermitage. Be aware that in the summer, it is incredibly crowded as the large cruise ships come in and the museum gets swamped with rage tour groups. Try going early upon opening or hiring a private guide."
64,You need a entire life to see everything!,"Visited the Hermitage museum and, as expected, it was busy but the groups were well controlled. The exhibits were wonderful but difficult to describe - worth a visit."
65,Wonderful if you like classical art!,"If you have travelled a bit and seen many places in France and England etc you may think a palace is a place. To a certain extent that is true, but the Russian palaces have a different charm and colour to European ones. This is a beautiful palace - don't miss it."
66,RUSSIAN MAFIA PICKPOCKETS-racist ,"This is a stunning building with paintings from the ""old masters"" dotted throughout. It makes a British stately home look like a twnt but is just too big to see in one day."
67,Must visit,"To visit The Hermitage was my long childhood dream. It took more than 3 decades and the weight was worth every second. My dream had come true. It was unforgetable and soul moving. This is the place all humans must visit to feel the past, present and future, to learn and feel themselves."
68,Must do,We had the honor of visiting one of the great museums of the world in September.  The Hermitage in St Petersburg Russia houses an unbelievable series of collections from around the world. It is one of the few places that you can see works by Michael Angelo side by side with Leonardo Davinci.  The Russian works are amazing in their quality and quantity. Even the rooms that they are presented in are works of art themselves. It is not easy to travel to but certainly worth the effort.
69,Loved this museum a lot!,"We managed 3 hours in this beautiful building before it closed for the day.So much to see, so much History. One of the best!"
70,Mind blowing experience ,"We spent 7 hours in the museum and never saw it all. There are just so many rooms and so much to see.  World Class artwork, furniture and fittings.  A must see when in St Petersburg and, very reasonable priced."
71,Outstanding,"What a fabulous city, so many things to see and doThe Hermitage museum is extensive, so many rooms, such a lot to see.The architecture is stunning, an abundance of gold and marble"
72,Awesome Collection,Did it with a private guide. So selected a few themes and history review ofPalace as well as Romanov .. fascinating.The exposed represent barely 8-10% of the Hermitage owned items...In the evening we followed up wit 2 hours in the vis a vis building with a treasure of paintings the Morozov collection (Monet/ Renoir/cezanne/ Gauguin/ Matisse/ Picasso)There is sooo much to see yet. A return is scheduled.
73,Must visit,"This was my second visit to this incredible museum, the first during the USSR regime. The museum is in better shape now although you could see it much better before, now the crowds are so huge that it is not worth the time unless you pay extra for a private visit before the museum opens to the public. I can not recommend any other way to visit it. We were a group of four with a guide and we could walk through the place at our own speed without worrying about crowds, there were justa few of us. When we were going out, we collided with hundreds of people getting in and we hd trouble exiting the place. Since the place is huge a mere 2 hour visit only gives you an idea of the place, go several times if you can... I highly advise to visit it in the cold months of winter or if you go during the summer to get a private visit."
74,Wear Comfortable shoes,"This is a must see if in St Petersburg but be prepared for crowds and be patient and you will get to see what you want. It would take several visits to see everything as the museum is made up of 4 buildings, the New, Old & Little Hermitage and the Winter Palace. There is an amazing collection of paintings including pieces by Rembrandt, Leonardo, Raphael, Goya & Rubens."
75,Fabolus,"So many exhibits to see at the Hermitage, that you need two days to really see the art work and all the other exhibits. Make sure that you have a translator for all the information  that you will need. You will run into many big tour groups."
76,Wow,What an incredible experience. Everything on display was so beautiful. The organised tour (from our cruise ship) was extremely interesting. We had very knowledgeable guides and feel very lucky to have seen this.
77,Wonderful ,"This place is everything you think it is...Fantastic architecture, awesome decorations and of course artworks aplenty."
78,Unbelievable and breathtaking,"This is by far the best art museum in the world.  I was amazed at the variety of art and the array of splendor and opulence throughout the museum.  It is massive and there is every kind of art one can imagine there.  Also, there is great gift shop and an excellent cafe.  This is a must see for anyone that loves and appreciates art and culture."
79,Good collections and too much for one day,The museum has an impressive collection of art but you really have to take in the surroundings as well.  There were crowds around some of the better known art works but it was not hard to break away from the tour groups and really drink in the grandeur of the palace itself.  If you like impressionists you want to walk across the square from the palace for those.  That branch houses a very large collection of impressionist master's painting collected by two families during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The lines for this part of the museum were almost non-existent.
80,You could spend a month here!,"Very nice place with rich history.It is good for families, tourists .Very well organized, they have different parts of history."
81,Too much in one day,Its an amazing musium. Ticket is 700  rubles for all the area. When entrance we had to give our winter jackets to the cloak room. Musium is amazing. It needs atleast 3-5 hours to complete all area. I like most the history of the Sars (kings) of russian. That is awesome. 10000 of itemas are there to see. Bigger than i expected.
82,Amazing,"Numerous fantastic exhibits starting from ancient Egypt to 20 th century. European and Russian artist from all over the world are represented. The Winter palace itself is something magic. Art collection is on the par with Louvre. You need to spend there several days to fully appreciate the museum. Try to visit during European summer as the weather can be really bad. It can rain and be cold around 10 degrees Celsius, so warm clothes is a must even in summer. Allow at least a week in St.Petersburg to have a chance to visit other museums and enjoy magnificent city architecture. While nights from mid June to beginning of July is the best time to visit."
83,Russian Louvre,"Awesome museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. Sometimes we use to go there with my friends.Fantastic place. Highly Recommended..."
84,Wonderful collection of art!,I really enjoyed this museum there is so much to see it would take months to view everything.Go at night when it is all lit up it is so beautiful.
85,Better than the Louvre !,Fantastic art displayed in quite the most spectacular of settings.  Easily the best large gallery I have ever visited.  It is too much to do in one visit - two is the bare minimum.  The views out over the frozen Neva are also breathtaking.
86,Terrible & frankly racist service,Everything was spectacular and our guide was fantastic. It helped that we got in 1.5 hours before it opened to the general public. So much to see. Need to go back to see more.
87,Magnificent,We took a guided tour through the museum and our guide led us to the most popular exhibits. We did not need to stand in line as we had a set entry time. The crowds in this museum are huge and no way would i want to navigate through without a tour guide.
88,"Amazing, huge - a must do even though one should really consider to have a guide",A definite must do!  Be prepared for a sensory overload.  The museum is situated in the Winter Palace and houses an outstanding collection of artworks.  The palace itself is so magnificent that it is a feature in itself and we found ourselves admiring the surroundings as much as the paintings and art works.  It is impossible to see all the exhibits in one visit but you get a good experience of the beauty and majesty of the place.
89,Excellent but Hard Work,"We went with an amazing tour guide, honestly I believe those places must be visited with a tour guide to take you through the highlights of the place."
90,"Too busy.  Rowded, worrying about being robbed",A very nice palais. It is very huge and well located. Absolutely worth a visit when you are in st peter
91,Lots of palatial rooms,"Because of its size, I had to visit it twice in order to see all the rooms and on most of them, I still went through fast and forward. I wanted to see some other things that turned out to be in the museums' treasury. I did not know that (not done my homework). The only thing I did not understand is why do they have once a day on a certain time group visits in the treasury and do not allow foreigners who miss the time to go with the Russian group? A personal disappointment in regards to the administration. To put this aside, the whole building is breathtaking and well organized..Good for research if you are interested in a certain topic, good as a family and a leisure activity or for personal interest."
92,Amazing! ,A visit to Hermitage is like dream come true. A art and cultural museum ranked 2nd in the world. A knowledgeable guide along will help better understanding of the things inside.
93,A must do - get your tickets online but don’t hope to skip the queue!,what a fantastic place. the rooms are just out of this world and you would need 2 days to do the entire place. the exhibitions are fantastic and well worth a trip.
94,Pay extra for exclusive visit,The collections and the pieces are a testament to the rich and deep history of Russia. It is not surprising that there are so many visitors. Just be careful with your belongings and be prepared to face the throngs of people and the crowds that seem to be never-ending.
95,Must to visit the second large museum in the world,"There are 3 floors - 1st floor -antiques of the world, 2nd floor -Russian culture,and European countries. 3rd -Far East & Central Asia.all displays rare treasurer of the world , especial.Russiae"
96,Highlight of St Petersburg,"The collection of Paintings, Sculpture and Furniture that this Museum holds is staggering and has to be considered up there with the top Museums in the world. One visit only just scratches the surface of all on show. As well as the artefacts the Hermitage is a beautiful opulent building in its own right. The only downside are the crowds - get there early and enjoy what you can before it becomes inb areas to croded to be able to properly take everything in."
97,So Disappointing,Such a gorgeous place! Lots to see so glad we had a tour guide to make sure we saw everything we should. Words just cannot describe the splendor and beauty of the State Hermitage Museum.
98,Must see,Hermitage is definitely a must to visit when you are in St Petersburg. I have been numerous number of times and each time find something new and exciting. I strongly recommend read and decide what you want to see - and good walking shoes. Hermitage is huge and you need to plan…
99,A Highlight of any holiday to St Petersburg,"Easily the most stunning museum I have ever been to, with such an impressive collection of state rooms, artefacts and amazing collections of paintings from all around the world. It was such a large collection, we felt ourselves getting lost multiple times! But most stunning. I recommend to book tickets online via the official website prior to your visit, and arrive with your printed ticket at least 25 minutes before opening time so you can experience the museum at leisure. Do plan your visit carefully and pay attention to opening hours and the weekly day off."
100,Large place with a lot of art,The main and the most important place to visit in Saint Petersburg in my opinion. Buy thickets online to avoid long queues and then you will find yourself immersed in the ocean of history of mankind since the beginning of the time. Be prepared for long visit.
101,Impressive collection,"We actually preferred our visit in the early 00s, when it seemed we saw a wider range of art genres and periods in the Winter Palace. This time we came too late to see all the other parts of the museum and missed seeing impressionists and modern periods. The palace rooms are impressive with elegant furnishings and lots of glitz."
102,Must see,"We spent the day here with a guide but to properly see all the exhibits it would require 3 to 7 days.There is everything here from antiquities to modern art, artifacts from tsarists times to the present.  In some respects one has to question how this the palace and museum was able to acquire all the exhibits at a time when the Russian Empire was largely comprised of serfs.  During WWII many of the exhibits were removed from the site for safekeeping while children were not evacuated from Leningrad, the previous name of the city.Regardless, this is a remarkable collection of exhibits housed in a beautiful setting."
103,Amazing does not even begin to describe it,"We were in St Peterburg, Russia, and were very excited to go to the state Hermitage Museum, offered by a local tour operator, Red Star Travel. Finally our wish came true! Of course, it could be more chilliy, but we were in the middle of summer, so no complains! A definite must-go museum if you are in Russia!"
104,Awesome,"In my opinion this is too large to enjoy in one visit and we felt frustrated as one of us had pre-booked tickets for both the Diamond and Gold Rooms and trying to fit in other exhibits in between the times and finding the Rooms proved very difficult so we stayed nearby and missed many exhibits in the numerous rooms.  It was full of huge groups with a leader shouting in all languages and so difficult to get by them.  The toilets also had large queues, so quite an unpleasant experience battling through.  When we finally left the Palace to go across the square to an exhibition of Impressionist Paintings we ran out of time and missed several rooms.  A frustrating experience for us."
105,Must see,"This is a an absolutely incredible museum that you just cannot miss if you are making the trip to St. Petersburg! Each new room is more awe-inspiring than the next and walking through the halls is like walking through history. For the best experience (and to make the best use of your time) find a good tour group to take you through the Hermitage, as it will save you a lot of time and waiting in line getting into the palace, as well as giving you a better idea of what to do and where to go once you've entered (it's a very big, very crowded place!). It's an experience I will never forget!"
106,Very impressive,We tour with a private guide from SPB - tours. There was a lot to see. We got in before the general public.Some of the opulent rooms were rich and luxurious. There are many steps.I could have spent more time looking at all the works of art.
107,Since 1764,"My wife and I spent approximately 4 hours exploring this wonderful palace and the surface was barely scratched.  I have a camera full of images to remind me of the magnificence of this structure.  However, nothing can equal the experience of wandering through this museum and seeing the history of St Petersburg and indeed Russia unfold.  From Peter the Great in the late 1600's to Catherine the Great in the late 1700's, their story is told in beautiful murals throughout.  It is a marvel to see."
108,One of the best museums in the world!,"Hermitage at the Winter Palace was definitely the highlight of our first day in Russia... visiting this museum was akin to seeing the masterpieces of the Louvre in the setting of Versailles Palace, but grander and more opulent with over 3 million pieces and 120 rooms. We were awestruck!"
109,Magnificent museum,The place was packed with tour guides with groups. But this does mean you get a good commentary on the significant exhibits. But there is a lot more to see.We had a great guide.
110,Be sure to book a pre-opening tour to this overwhelmingly beautiful museum,The  Hermitage museum was absolutely beautiful and amazing. It was very much worth going to see. Also our tour guide Liza with Ulko Tours was very knowledgeable and informative.
111,Huge!!!,"We could have spent a couple of days in this museum. But we took a guided tour for 3 hours and definitely felt like we covered most of the highlights. Once having been guided and had some major items pointed out, it would have been lovely to have the luxury of spending some quiet time taking them in at our leisure. It's a truly amazing collection, and the interior of the building alone is worth the price of admission."
112,Touristy visit for a day,"The Hermitage is the main attraction in St P, or at least it was for us. Such a collection, and such history. You can't see it all but we loved it. It helped a lot to have our own guide who had booked a time slot so we could walk past the long queue. We also found at that the Impressionist collection has been moved to the General Staff Building across Alexander square, and wow - how good is that - and so few people, even no queue!"
113,FIRST CLASS VISIT IN THE GOOD HANDS OF MS ALYONA OF ULKO TOURS,"I had planned my St Petersburg visit around The Hermitage. Seeing The Hermitage was at the top of my list and everything else was secondary,Because I wanted as much time as possible in The Hermitage, I booked the five hours in The Hermitage with The Gold Room. The Hermitage was magnificent but the crowds were just out of control. There was so much chaos and mania that I fell down while going up a magnificent flight of marble stairs. The crowds ruined my visit and I was travelling the end of September, the so called shoulder season. I can not even imagine what it would be like during the season.It was difficult and sometimes impossible to hear my guide because there was so many groups and so much talking and noise Also,it was often difficult to get up close to the art work. I had originally booked an evening tour to The Hermitage but it was only three hours and I wanted as much time as possible so I changed my excursion. I regret the change.I suggest an evening visit to the Hermitage."
114,Too crowded!,"If you travel to St Petersburg, this is the one thing you most not omit. Paintings, sculptures, furniture and other artefacts are just wow. The architecture, the fascade and everything tho! That is the best. Save the whole day for this amazing museum."
115,Amazing!!,A huge complex of inter-linked buldings housing so many works of art that you could easily spend several days here.  The Gold Room is stunning and the Peacock Clock by Cox is incredible.  It is worth arriving early as it soon gets very busy.
116,Wonderful,The guided tour with Maria was superb. Maria's knowledge of History and the Arts was outstanding. The Hermitage Museum is an absolute must for anyone visiting St Petersburg and I would definitely recommend a tour with Maria at GetYourGuide. Her English is perfect and she explains everything in an interesting and clear way.
117,"Must visit, so much to see",This was the highlight of our trip.  Hard to imagen how large the complex is.  It is very crowded.  I was on a tour for three hours then had a couple of hours on my own.  Even with a map it was hard to navigate.  It was also very crowded.  So crowded it was hard to see some exhibits.  Not to be missed.
118,HUGE OPULENT MAJESTIC,"You could spend days going through this Museum, The rich history represented there is beyond comprehension. Hire a guide it is worth it. The gold room has so much to see it gets boring. Unbelievable how close you can get to the art work."
119,Amazing architecture of the Hermitage,"This place is paradise for art lovers, there is just so much to see that you couldn't even imagine, we got to see some of the world's most famous pieces thanks to our knowledgeable tour guide, I know I will remember this place for the rest of my life"
120,Work in Progress,"Amazing place/collection, this is the place to see in case you have only a short stay in St. Peterburg, IMHO needs at least 3 hrs. Tickets are easily available on the machines near the entrance."
121,opulence and GREAT paintings,"The place really is something special. It is huge, and you could spend forever in here. Without a guide it is of course a bit hard to get out as much as you would with one - however it is real fun to just stroll around and get lost.I loved to just walk around and enjoy the palace itself which is really amazing. A must do out of the things I did during my extended weekend holiday.In December there really was not any irritating queues and strolling around the palace you had all the room in the world  - I assume with more tourists the wait time can become quite long and it would make sense to buy the tickets in advance."
122,Extraordinary experience ,Nothing prepares you for the splendours on the Winter Palace. It is massive and packed with treasures at every turn . If you spend 1 minute at each item it will take 7 years to see everything .
123,Huge fascinating museum,Wear your walking shoes.  There is so much glitter and precious stones and ceiling art and endless rooms full of gold leaf and art that it is impossible to describe.  You can see some of it on Google Earth.
124,The Hermitage Museum is truly outstanding,This museum was a part of our two day itinerary with City Break Tours. For me it was the most impressive place to visit in St Petersburg. The exhibition is extensive and you need years to discover it fully. Definitely a must.
125,One-Day Hermitage Visit,"We went early to have time to see as much as possible for one day. Since we went in December, there were not so many tourists. This was good because It probably is very busy during the high season. Cloakrooms are inside to hang coats and leave bags. There were at least two cafeterias inside to sit and relax after all the walking. The art is beautiful and if more information about the history of the art there is tour guides and also translation to learn more. Did not disappoint and warmly recommended as many others have done already!"
126,Mind blowing ,"This museum is just as large as the Louvre in Paris so be prepared for a lot of walking. You must check your coat and they do not allow large bags, sacks, or backpacks. It was crowded in October so I can't imagine being here in summer during peak season. There is so much to see and various rooms with different art and sculptures. Plan to be here a couple of hours and that still wont be long enough."
127,Must see,"The museum itself is wonderful. You can see anything about anything, and still have thousands of things to see. Our tour guide told us that if you spent 1 minute looking at each painting, you’d need 7 years! I highly recommend buying the St. Petersburg card. Not only does this grant you discounts at stores, but more importantly it allows you to skip the line and get museum tickets for free (depends on the museum). At the Hermitage for example, we didn’t have to pay extra AND we skipped the line. If you don’t have tickets, you’ll be waiting in a line for at least an hour. Be warned!There are a couple of cafes in the museum, but there aren’t many options (especially for vegans/vegetarians) and the food is overpriced. I’d recommend eating before you enter the museum."
128,"One of the biggest and most prestigious museums of the world, situated in an historical building.",Can't begin to explain the wonder of the Hermitage Museum. Similar to the Louvre experience. Be prepared for walking and climbing so dress comfortably. We visited in the summer so most of the rooms do not offer air condition. There was a line to get in confirming that this is a must visit on your St Petersburg to do list. Our tour director was very well versed and art appreciative so her vast knowledge was relied upon to explain the pieces of art and the various time periods in Russian history. Be prepared to be wowed and take in the wonder of The Hermitage.
129,Incredible Museum,"Everyone says the same thing, its huge & so full of art that it would take years to see it all!  The lines can be long and even in a tour you will have to wait in parts of it.  We took the tour offered thru our Viking cruise & it was all day, having said that part of the tour was offsite to see behind the scenes were they keep the clothes & carriages.  I do recommend a tour guide of some sort because they tend to focus on the highlights & there's so much to see, Part of the tour we could take pictures and part of the tour we could not.  The entire museum is gorgeous inside and out.  There are impressive pieces across the museum.  I had no idea of the Russian richness.  Such a eye opener to another life years gone by.  Fortunately for us we did not have any problems but I did hear about pickpockets and we were constantly reminded to be aware.  Men do NOT keep your wallets in your back pockets."
130,Fabulous Museum,"Overall I think the museum was okay, but as it was such a large one, my tour guide was incapable of explaining anything in detail to me. I asked him what the enormous statue was, and he responded saying that, ""this is the main statue of Russia, no actually it's the Russian statue"". Whereas the research I did when I got home said that it was the 'Russian Hermitage Statue'. He himself was not aware and this fact annoyed me. The museum may be good but it's too large to be explained by one guide. I learnt absolutely nothing out of it, and it wasted my $70, not to mention my time too."
131,Review of state Hermitage museum,"This is a great place! Take your ticket through the net or on the side you can find machine for tickets where you can buy cheaper ticket then inside . The most impressive museum I have ever seen.If you spent a minute on every piece , it would take you 11 years to look at everything ."
132,So much to see!,"As you can imagine this is a very popular attraction , it was busy in Autumn so I can imagine what it is like in peak season. We had a personal guide which helps with entry and just getting around this large Museum."
133,World Class Art Exhibit,Hermitage is a big miseum so is better to make a selection of points of interest.You have also guidet tour of jewelry room but it ‘ s good to have info when it starts because i think there is just one per day in english and it takes quite a long time.so it’ s better to plan in advance.and also buy your ticket on ticket maschine not to waist time in the ticket line because all discounts are just for residents and normal ticket you can get slso without waiting .French impresionists are not in the main building but in general stuff building which is on the other side of the squere.
134,Excellent Museum,A must see stop in St. Petersburg. One of the most impressive and opulent palaces I have seen. Gets extremely crowded there fore I would recommend paying extra and going before regular hours.  Guided  tours are very helpful because of the size of the castle .... amber room is a must stop
135,Amazing Experience,"Indispensable visit of this musuem. Be prepared to see many rooms, all so nicely decorated, hosting great paintings from world famous artists."
136,Almost unbelievable!,"As everyone else has said, the exhibits at the Hermitage are truly mind blowing and world class.  We planned our visit with our excellent guide Nina (from Tzarina Tours, who organised the tickets so we basically just went straight in) for Wednesday afternoon so we could see the Peacock Clock.  I wanted to do a review just for the peacock clock but it doesn’t appear to be separated out on TA.  Would have only given it 2 stars.  After several hours with Nina covering the main exhibits, we went back at about 6.15pm to try to secure a good spot to see the peacock clock, considering that it was peak season in mid-June.  There was already a small crowd but we were able to secure a fairly close spot and then as time went on others got fed up and left and so we actually ended up in a prime spot right in front of the clock.  I had thought the clock was at 7.30pm but it turned out that it was not until 8pm, so it was a long wait for a large crowd.  But then when the time finally came and the man entered the enclosure to wind the clock and start the performance (which lasts about one minute), he crouched down to wind the clock but then stood up about ten seconds into the show, almost obliterating the view for anyone directly in front and ruining any photo opportunities.  Those on the side would have had a better view though.  Don’t know whether we just got a bad day or if this is normal.  But a nice touch was that they did allow small children to come and sit inside the ropes, so long as they didn’t touch the glass enclosure.So a long wait to have the view obscured – we would have been much better off using the time to view other exhibits in the museum.  If you want to see the clock in action, just get there 5 or 10 minutes early and you will probably see as much over the crowd as we did from right in front."
137,this place is massive. literally and figuratively.,Amazing place...you could spend days in here. The building is as amazing as the exhibits. Wow...just wow
138,Cruise Ship Excursion,I went to the hermitage before I became a trip advisor member.We had a private early morning tour before the main public with red October. There were 9 of us on celebrity eclipse cruise ship. It gets very busy once open so I wouldn't recommend if you have young children. It's huge. You'll never get round all of it. Funny how you imagine great works of art. They are so much smaller in real life!
139,A fantastic place to visit,"We arranged a one-day tour of the Heritage Museum while in St. Petersburg during a Northern European cruise.  The museum is well kept, but crowded (not surprising).  The countless works of art are aw-inspiring and the history regarding the palaces and how the Hermitage came into being is fascinating.  Russian history is a jumbled mess of murder, incest and betrayal, but again, it is fascinating.I highly recommend visiting the Hermitage, but do so with an outside tour group, as the line to get in was very long."
140,Awful staff,although there is simply too much to marvel at very very worthwhile to spend the time; took 2-day ticket which worked very well
141,One of the World's Great Museums,Even if you just visit the outside.....this historical site is beautiful. We did not have the time to explore the inside BUT the outside already took our breath away. I love old architecture....it is filled with people's skills that excelled on excellence and took pride in their work. You will love the details in all of the buildings you will pass in st Petersburg. SUCH BEAUTY!
142,somehow,I am a professional tourguide and I have seen many museums in my life. But the State Hermitage beats them all.Just you need a lot of time as the collection is huge. I spent 2 days and still did see just 50 percent of the rooms... as I live in Estonia I will come back after a week to see the other rooms.I did read and hear about crowds and rude tour groups in the main season. I had a totally different experience in January (Wednesday and Thursday)... no crouds at all and Wednesday evening I had some of the rooms for me alone.
143,The Hermitage is a Bucket-list destination ,I defy anyone to visit The Hermitage and not be gobsmacked by its' vast corridors and displays. We spent at least 3 hours in there and probably still didn't see everything.Everything is well displayed and there are detailed descriptives next to each piece giving an explanation of the history of each item.The only disappointing part of the building is the gift shop areas dotted around the place - they feel like an afterthought and really don't reflect or make the best of what this place is about in terms of merchandise or souvenirs.
144,Fantastic experience ,"I enjoyed the outside of the palace and the interior decor as much as I enjoyed the art.  Maybe more than the art?  We spent 5 hours between the main museum and the impressionist wing.  I felt like so much of the time we had a difficult time finding the rooms we wanted to visit.  So large and confusing.  There is a LOT of Russian art as well, which was very interesting.  I am glad we went and knew it would be tough to manage in just a few hours."
145,Hermitage is like a dream! ￼,The state hermitage museum has to be seen but you need plenty of time. Amazing pictures and artifacts.
146,Beautiful building and amazing artworks!,One of the reasons I went to St. Petersburg.  The museum is so awesome.  The collections provides a snapshot of history.
147,absolutely mind blowing,"I dream all my life to see the Eremitage and Vinterpalace  now I have done it and it will not take long time before next visit. It was stunning , brilliant, fabolus!"
148,Would have to see it to believe it!,"The Hemitage is the Centre of attractions in St Peterburg. The architectural beauty, the historical narrative, the internal beauty and the art / artifacts collections will leave you most satisfied - maybe wanting more. I've been fortunate to visit this museum twice and would not mind a third visit too. It is a full day affair and should not be rushed. The summer months are too crowded, especially with bulk tours which can be noisy and overwhelming in a pristine place like this. Wear comfortable shoes. In case you're visiting in non-tourist months, you could have the place to yourself. A guide / e-audio guide are a must , else you miss out on the relevance of the displays."
149,Need all day.,Hermitage is one reason to visit St. Petersburg and is not just an incidental add on to a trip to St. Petersburg. Unfortunately I could only spend a whole day there... plan to visit again to spend atleast a week at Hermitage. Audio guides are available and are a must. The cafeteria is good too. Mesmerising collection and hugely informative and interesting for an art lover.
150,Must see,This place rivals the Louvre in Paris. It has artwork by every world renowned master that you can think of.
151,Hermitage ,Absolutely fantastic ! Can’t beat it. Must visit.’amazing collection and staff at the museum are all very helpful!
152,Add this tour in on your trip to St. Petersburg.,This needs no introduction.  The collection of fine art in the Winter Pace is out of this world.  Every visitor to St Petersburg should squeeze a half day for this.
153,Huge. Get a guide.,Over the years we have seen quite a few things but this place ranks as maybe the most amazing. Security is quite tight and a bit of a faff but its worth it. We visited as part of a tour which made the whole experience more straight foward as it focused on the highlights. The place has over 1000 rooms yes a 1000 so it pays to be selective over what you see.
154,Huge,"VIsited late morning and one of us had two planned tours of the Gold and Diamond Rooms with over an hour to wait in between.  After eventually finding the Gold room I waited ten minutes as the previous group had just left. Our group had fifteen people and I understand sixteen was the limit so it was difficult to stand by the exhibits and hear and see what the guide was talking about.  I happened to move over slightly to another exhibit to take a look in comfort and immediately a very rude man told me to get back.  Another tourist was also met with the same rudeness.  We were only a few steps from our group anyway. It was interesting and had many exhibits dating back centuries.  My companion decided to stay in the Cafe after accompanying me to the Diamond room as I was told if you arrive late you cannot join the group,and we had to ask a couple of times how to get there as there are many staircases and with the huge groups it is difficult to get by them.  The Diamond room was interesting but not what I expected, apart from the two horse blankets which were festooned with hundreds of diamonds, and had never been put on a horse !!  They were a gift from a country I cannot remember.  I was expecting the ‘Crown Jewels’ with more rings and jewellery but was told these are kept elsewhere ?We went out of the building to see an exhibition of Impressionist art but unfortunately we didn’t have time to see it all before it closed.It is true what people say - you need a couple of days there."
155,An once in life time visit.,My very first virtual tour and it was splendid!!!!  I felt as if I was right there in each room soaking up the history.
156,Wow,Such an amazing museum!!! Get proper walking shoes because you have loads to see. Everything is so well taken care of and so beautifully displayed and integrated. Really one of the most beautiful museums I have ever visited!
157,Great Russian experience!!,"A must visit place in St. P. Cannot miss it.  Lots of heritage obviously and if you have a guide, it will be much better to understand what you are looking at!"
158,Spectacular place but not worth the risk of being a traget for criminals,This place has a definite Wow factor and without a knowledgeable tour guide you can spend a month in there. Best to have a guide just show you the highlights and guide you through otherwise you can get lost in there. This place is unreal. Beautiful building and spectacular decor and showcases some great history and art that will blow your mind. Exhibits are very well presented and in Chronological order.  Our Tour Guide was a specialist in Art so this was a real treat so that you can truly understand and appreciate what you are seeing. A must see if in this fine city.
159,Great museum,"You will need a fair amount of time to explore the 400 rooms containing millions of artifacts! Each room is different, containing original pieces you will see nowhere else in the world. No visit to Russia is complete without at least a day at this gorgeous museum."
160,The Sate Hermitage Museum,"Amazing museum! The Hermitage occupies what was once the Winter Palace.  The Hermitage consists of six buildings displaying over 150,000 famous paintings, sculptures and more. It is full of countless treasures and history. It would take you years to go through each exhibit. As you enter, The Grand Staircase is breathtaking.  We were on a tour with a Viking River Cruise guide, Alexey.  Alexey was so knowledgeable and knew how to stay away from the crowds, when possible.  I strongly recommend that you take a tour of The Hermitage.  To do it on your own would be too overwhelming.  The museum is crowded and we were constantly warned of pickpockets.  Be aware at all times!  Don’t miss this wonderful museum.  So many treasures and not enough time to see it all."
161,Hermitage Museum,We had a full afternoon visit to the  but you would really need a couple of weeks to even see a quarter of the exhibits. What we did see was wonderful and I was in awe of the paintings by some of the great names in the art world. Wish we could have spent more time there but our tour itinerary would not permit this.
162,So much to see,"The Hermitage is a famous Russian state museum which is located in the center of St. Petersburg. The facility is housed in as many as six majestic buildings on the banks of the Neva River. The most important is the baroque Winter Palace. The residence was built in 1754-1762 for Tsarina Elizabeth according to the design of Bartolome Rastrelli. A fantastic place. The building itself from the outside makes a huge impression. Beautiful interiors, excellent collections, many great works of art. One of the world's largest art and antiques collections. Beautiful paintings of famous masters such as Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, Dega ,  Rubens, Titian, Gauguin, Picasso and Bosh. It is worth preparing for a long route, in one day you can not see everything. It's really worth visiting this place ."
163,An encounter with Russia´s greatness,"When you are queing 45 minutes to put your coat in the cloakroom at the start of the visit with just one babooshka serving the entire queue, or then waiting 15 minutes in a queue for the toilet because they close them regularly through the day, then you promise to give them a bad score. At least before visiting we did read that it is best to buy your ticket outside electronically because you can otherwise queue a long time for a ticket.But once you get inside then the experience is so brilliant that you forget all this. Of course, don't ask the babooshkas who sit on their chairs all day anything at all as they are from the old Soviet style of public relations and will sigh and puff and turn away. And this was not to me but to my friend who was Russian. They are rude to everybody!But again, the building and the contents are just unique. We walked for 3 hours and were still seeing new and wonderful things. Just perfect.Then at the end we were set to quue at least an hour with the same single babooska to get our coats but a lady said we could go to the front if collecting the coats rather than depositing. So this was a relief.Really if I visit St Petersburg again I will visit The Hermitage again. It is an amazing building with unique collections."
164,Walking back in time,Really one of the top museums in the world.  You could spend days looking at all the treasures.A skip the line tour is a must unless you like waiting. Also if you are staying in St. Pete get one of the multi-day entry tickets.  First day do a skip the line tour with a guide and second day go late afternoon by yourself after the tour buses have left.
165,Impressive but too crowded,It was the first time I had visited Hermitage. One of the most amusing museums to see. You can find here a lot of world masterpieces!
166,The Splendour is just incredible !!,It has a great collection of art. But it's very difficult to see all items. So you should decide what do want to see. There are a lot of greek and roman sculptures and painting of renaissance. And of course the Hermitage is beautiful palace. All rooms are decorated rich
167,A must see,The queues outside make you think it will be extremley busy inside but its not and the rooms its just jaw dropping so much beauty. You walk from one room to the next and its just amazing I am not one for museums but so glad we queued for this. Your ticket has a time on it but take no notice of that as they let the big groups in first. But well worth the wait.
168,Jawdropping...... but be warned.,"Completely loved the State Hemitage.  Wow!  We were on a cruise ship excursion, so we were ushered through and had many of the outstanding items poined out.  Everything is first class, best available.  Lots of gold and outstanding art!  Go there!"
169,Not all masterpieces,"There is so much to see in this amazing museum, that you need many visits to see just some of it. Worth a private tour before or after hours to really look and enjoy..Amazing how much is in this one place."
170,Disappointing,"We went to the Hermitage with Alla Tours while on a 24-hour stopover on our Norwegian Getaway Baltic cruise in August 2019. It was only a quick two-hour tour but we saw many of the highlights - the grand entrance stairway, the Peacock clock, hall leading to the theater, sculptures including one by Michelangelo, and many paintings by Rembrandt and others. As the second largest museum in the world, this is definitely a must-do while in St. Petersburg!"
171,"So much to see, so little time","One visit to the Hermitage is not enough  - it is extensive and should not be missed.  It was very busy in certain areas, the guide map details each of the exhibitions and buildings.  This is a museum on the grandest scale.  The Hermitage is a series of buildings (including the Winter Palace) along the Palace Embankment. Having a guide enabled us to see the highlights of the exhibitions with some of her History of Art Background knowledge.  Again we were able to be on our own in the entrance hall as we had an early ticket for the day, Romanov family rooms in the Winter Palace seem like an 'add on' to the extensive historical artifacts.  This is not to be missed on a visit to SP"
172,An absolute must,"My girlfriend is Russian, and with her family we traveled to see the Hermitage. I am from New Zealand with dark skin and don't look Russian. We were attempting to book a tour to the diamond room.I was unable to be in the same tour as my girlfriend and her family because I had a New Zealand passport, and they did not believe I spoke enough Russian. A silly rule but they enforced it.However, despite my girlfriend being a qualified teacher in English and living in an English speaking country for years, they didn't allow her to be in the English speaking tour.It's ironic that these out of touch rules exist in the same palace where they did 100 years ago. Didn't see any art there anyhow, just a strange celebration of the same imperial artefacts that ruined the country."
173,Spectacular,The thing about Russia is that even in the cities there is a lot of open space...you never feel cramped...st Petersburg is no exception...lots of open space yet cosy and extremely safe. This summer palace converted into a museum is the heart of the history that St. Petersburg was all about
174,"Stunning buildings, wonderful art collection, best experienced with a guide",This is the most amazing collection of art and history gathered into one museum. It has been estimated that it would take 3 years full time to view all the 3 million plus exhibits if you were to spend 3 minutes viewing each item. Puts other European museums to shame !
175,Interesting museum but missing the impressionists collection now,"Incredible - plan beforehand what you want to see if possible because it’s impossible to see everything. Definitely the imperial state rooms, then choose the art collections that interest you. There is a cafe for snacks. You have to remove coats and leave them in the cloakroom and your bags are scanned - no liquids."
176,Go with a personal guide,"One of my favorite museums in the world and still after several visits it feels like I am there for the first time!! The opulence is incredible and somewhat chocking- the collections to die for of course and the architecture itself is worth its own visit!! Go early and buy whatever private viewing you can, it’s so worth it - the crowds are overwhelming at times and nowadays everybody acting like photographers but without courtesy for others… I am sorry to sound negative but it’s sad to see how manners sort of disappeared the past decennium… If you go without extra frills, go early and slowly to these majestic staterooms and just indulge on the beauty - from the grand scale to the attention to details!!! You just can’t skip going!!"
177,Worth a visit,"On a recent tour to The Hermitage we were treated to a quick (2 1/2 hour tour) of splendour that we have never seen before.  The architecture of the Winter Palace! The collections!  The art!   The staircases!  When I asked our tour director, a day before this trip, if we would be able to spend more time there after the tour,I was told that most people found that enough!  So.....at my insistence, on a new and separate ticket, we went elsewhere in The Hermitage to see the French Impressionists.  Much less crowded than the many tour groups in the main areas of the Winter Palace.  Definitely worth the side trip."
178,Amazing experience but very busy!,If you haven’t been to the Hermitage you are in for a treat. The original museum has a very impressive collection of classical art from all over the world.Gallery upon gallery of priceless works which match anything you see across Europe The new and more modern addition to the Hermitage is a stunning space and offers so some wonderful works in a more contemporary setting The Palace square is best visited in the summer when it has a real buzz with lots going on around it
179,Amazing,"You all know about the Hermitage.  It's a museum in a palace.  In some rooms, I was more impressed with the opulent ceilings, walls and floors than I was with the art.  It's jaw dropping.  Tips are to purchase your tickets at the kiosks located inside the courtyard.  There are kiosks on both sides of the courtyard.  When you enter the building, you will see lines of people waiting to purchase tickets.  Go around them to the cloak room.  Go to the larger of the cloak room.  Do not stop at the first cloak desk, but push yourself through the crowd until you find a cloak desk without a line.  There is also a bathroom in the larger cloak area.  Other bathrooms are found on the ground floor near the staircases.  Then you stand in line for security scanning.  Once you are past that, the crowds thin out since it is such a large museum.  Maps are found on racks near security.  I had some trouble finding the new Hermitage building, but was given good directions by the person selling audio guides at the top of the main staircase.  Basically from the top of the stairway, you go left, then left, then follow the halls.  It's worth seeing the museum more than once.  I booked extra time in St Petersburg so that I could go to the museum 4 times.  So much to see.  The cafe in the Grand Staff building is good.  The Winter Palace Cafe is limited."
180,Not long enough to visit,"It is huge and you take into consideration that you will need a lot of time if you want to check out all three floors. The rooms itself are an exhibition, but with the objects the place is just amazing. There isn't just Russian art and history, but also from other parts of the world."
181,For ever in my mind and my 💙,"We are really not into Museums, however this one is an exception. The size of it is amazing. You could spend weeks there. Articles from all over the world. What  ever you do if you go to St Petersburg DONOT miss the Hermitage Museum."
182,Amazing Museum,The museum is huge. You can literally walk around for hours and hours. The architecture was incredible.
183,Amazing ,Was very disappointed with the service. In the museum website it was mentioned that we can leave our carry on bagage in the cloakroom. However on site after buying tickets we were told that they meant a small bag by “carry on”. We were checked out at that time planning to spend the day in museum before our flight. Then we were told to approach Kempinski hotel in 100m were supposed to be  a paid bagage store. We went there and been told that it’s onl for hotel guests. You can imagine how pissed off we were when we had to enter the museum in turns. Unorganized terrible service!
184,Whew,"A great tour through part of the H A very large place so if possible, grab a map and a coffee and workout what you really want to see. You need a lot more time then is allotted on group tours so go back for a second look if you have the time. If you need the cloak room for bags, coats etc go to the far end....less of a queue"
185,Like nothing you've ever seen.,"We spent a week visiting Moscow (which was great) and St.Petersburg (which was not so great).The Hermitage was quite good but really no better then The National Gallery or any of the big London museums.As in London, Huge crowds of Chinese visitors dominated the proceedings.But the worst experience which visitors really should not have to undergo was the exit.You had to pass through a relatively narrow area to exit the building, no other exit was permitted. We were told that there were 3,000 people in the area, many of them Chinese groups hanging around and blocking all movement. We were also told by our tour leader than pickpockets abounded here - we had actually seen them in operation in town earlier. Everyone seemed to be nervous and were hanging on to each other like migrating elephants. The progress was very slow, very hot and frankly for old or for children, downright intimidating.Would I go there again - a resounding NO, mostly for the security at the end rather than the exhibits."
186,Lots to see,"This stunning building completely blew us away there is so much history and memorabilia to look at you will need a few days to check it out , you will also leave just in complete ore of this stunning palace a must visit when in st Petersburg"
187,The best I have ever experienced,"It is make up of a few buildings - Winter Palace, Small Hermitage, Large Hermitage, the Theatre, the New Hermitage and the General Staff Building.  Catherine the Great bought lots of Western Europe's best collection between 1764 and 1774. It is now one of the world's leading museums.We saw Leonarda Da Vinci's Little Madonna, Peacock clock, Michaelangelo's famous crouching body and many other paintings.Worth visiting."
188,Hermitage,"The Hermitage is immense in size, and even a year ago it would take fa few days to enjoy its magnificence - paintings and sculptures from the most famous artist in history, large regal rooms. It's so big and there is so much on display, you may feel it's endless.We came with a tour guide so it helped enter on a scheduled time, since the queue outside was immense."
189,Crowds Ruined My Experience,You could spend days in here but we opted for a quick fly by each room which took about 2 hours. Good time to visit in February as no waiting for tickets and major exhibits easy to see.
190,Must visit,"The grand entrance with the magnificent marble staircases leading up to the first level, the sparkling mirrors, red carpets, stupendous chandeliers - is no more. Now it is the exit with no lighting, dusty stairs, dull mirrors, greyness everywhere.The art galleries are so overcrowded with tourists from a large Asian country that it is impossible to move, let alone see the pictures. There was no time when the overcrowding didn't exist, and the entrance queues were very lengthy. Not sure what the answer is - perhaps the museum opens from 5pm to 8pm especially for the massive groups of tourists and the rest of the day for everybody else. And reinstall the beautiful entrance. I'm very grateful that I have seen the Hermitage Museum previously in all its glory."
191,Fantastic Museum!,"This museum is massive and it is unforgettable.We spent four hours in this amazing museum and believe me that’s not even close to being enough time to see everything they have including priceless artwork, thrones, furniture and so much much more. It’s very busy during high season so you’re best off going there first thing in the morning in off-season if you want to have an incredible experience at this fabulous palace. The architecture, the gold, the artwork and everything else is overwhelming and just amazing.  It’s an absolute must do it for visiting Saint Petersburg Russia."
192,Best museum in russia,For this place to see you need 6 month very Very big dollars and very beautiful and you need to see this please very long time must visited
193,Almost unbelievably impressive and beautiful museum with ridiculously bad cloakrooms,Really liked it but allow a few hours. Buy tickets upon walking through from machines. Two queues to enter building. Check shortest queue is normally the tickets already purchased.Upon entry no costs so go to cloakroom and place your coats and gloves for free. Remember the booth operator to collect items from.Many stairs at entrance. Grab a map. Rooms are numbered above doorways. Use you locate where you are.
194,4-Hour Worth Walking!,"The rooms are stunning (as are the crowds), a bit difficult to negotiate without a guide.  Definitely worth the time."
195,"Massive, choose your exhibits wisely","Apparently this is the second largest museum in the world, second to The Louvre. Having been to both, in my mind it is hugely better in all aspects to The Louvre. Over the course of a six night stay in St Petersburg, I spent over six hours in the museum. The highlight was the Contemporary French art gallery . The museum is a mixture of old and new buildings and both are perfect. One could easily spend the whole of your holiday in the Museum and still only a fraction of the exhibits."
196,Try Night Visit,"The Hermitage is absolutely huge, the building itself is impressive, and the collections inside are vast and amazing.You will never see everything, don't even try. We had a tour guide (from a tour company, not from the museum) who picked out the most amazing bits and showed us round. I would certainly recommend getting a guide, either from a tour company or by joining a guided tour at the museum.Definitely worth going, but don't expect to see everything. You can't take large bags into the building at all, and all coats and smaller bags must be left at a cloak room. You can't take food and drinks inside, but there is a coffee shop."
197,Audio guide useless,"The museum is very good, the collection is unique, but the exposition is out of the ordinary. It seems that the main goal of the museum’s management is not to show but to preserve. So they try. Turnstiles are very ““ pleased. ”And the signaling of the paintings, too.The nameplates have a very small print, you bend over to read, and then there’s a peep to the whole hall and rangers running from all legs .... Save on lighting in ""non-title"" halls. Moreover, the mass of paintings turned out to be behind the glass, darkness and glare do not allow us to really examine what is written there."
198,Venice of the North,It is beautiful with lighting effects ... though cold during the Winter ... gives the visitor another perspective
199,A real 'must see',"Day 1 at The Hermitage was amazing. We Arrived 30 minutes before opening and joined a small queue. We had not paid to “jump the queue” and found the ticketing straightforward though a bit  hectic. Dropped our bag at the cloakroom, picked up the audio tape and started our exploring. Some of the audio for the English was not accurate ie different items not in the room keyed in and a number of rooms had no information at all. There are small descriptions in English for most displays so you get the gist. If you don’t have a lot of time plan ahead to see the items you want. We spent 7 hours and have not finished the Winter Palace. Lucky we are staying longer and will go back. Plan your toilet breaks as they are not many to be found. It is a must see."
200,Interesting. ,"The Hermitage was a bit of a disappoint for me as this was a “bucket list” visit so my expectations were high.  It was very, very, crowded and hot and lots of pushy Chinese with poorly behaved children.  I also though the art of quantity without quality.  They building has been refurbished and it alone is worth a visit but the artwork - largely meh.  It does illustrate why there was a revolution!"
201,OPULENCE AND GRANDIOSE,"This is the world's second biggest museum (after the Louvre) and you can easily spend a day here.  However if you come for the impressionist paintings, they have now been moved to the gallery on the other side of the square.  Get tickets from the machine at the square entry to save yourself an hour's queue.  Amazing history of Russia inside, especially since 1600"
202,Holds the history of Russian Royalty,"One of the attractions worth visiting in St Petersburg. If you are interested in history and yearns to learn more, it’s a place worth visiting. Just keep in mind it’s closed on Monday for visitors."
203,The Gold Room,"We were part of a tour party with Viking River Cruises with early access to the premises which meant we had a guide and a head start.   This was originally the Winter Palace but is now a museum however the building and rooms are breathtaking as are the collection of art and exhibits.   There is just so much to see you cannot do it all but I felt our guide did a great job picking out the best exhibits.  So many paintings by truly great artists in one place.   We went end of September out of main season and were told they get 20,000 visitors a day and certain parts were ridiculously crowded but in summer they get 40,000 visitors a day so it would be unbearable I think but one of the things you have to do.   It's quite hard work walking around.   My advice would definitely be to get a guide if you can who can show you the best things."
204,A lot to see,"The museum is huge.  On par with the British Museum or the Louvre.  Can get very crowded at times.  Unless you have days to tour it, you will have to be selective.  We were with a tour guide which was a great way to see the highlights. Particularly enjoyed the Rembrandts, especially the ""Return of the Prodigal Son"" which is on permanent display."
205,THE MUST SEE IN ST PETERSBURG,"My wife and I did this as part of a bus tour group affiliated with our Cruise ship. Since this museum is huge, on the scale comparable to the Louvre, I believe is is recommended to take some kind of a tour, due to how much there is to see there. One item not to miss is Leonardo da Vinci's (or possibly one of his pupils) Madonna Litta (late 15th century painting). The madonna and child are in a dark room with one arched opening either side giving the subject matter its light. The Christ child holds a goldfinch  in his left hand, possibly symbolizing his future Passion. Considered to be the second largest museum in the world, it was originally started by Catherine the Great, with 200 paintings. The museum is housed in what was the Winter Palace, the elevation along the river is quite impressive, with its many window openings, half columns and uniquely distinct light green pastel color."
206,A few tips,"Hermitahe is one of the world's most famous museums. I do not tthink there is a need to say more about the palace and the exhibition. However, new visitors may need to be aware of ""logistical"" challenges, especially completely mismanaged access (ticket purchases, long lines, excessive crowds, etc.). Having professional guides would definiotely help - they might get you in bypassing the main line (it might take hours of wait otherwise). ."
207,The biggest must see,"I went here 2 weeks ago. I was so excited to finally go to the hermitage, to realised, when I walked in the first room, I’ve been pickpocked. The interesting part, is that as there is no human right, nobody cares in there, they send you only out of the museum to go to the police station (and it was there a lot of police but they refuse to speak to me - as I’m Italian probably they are really racist with everyone) what a awful experience. I walked out with an empty bag and really bad memories. Never again"
208,Another must see,"In here your eyes will not be able to switch off, there is so much to see, it is excellent, extravagant and very beautiful. Words can't really do it justice, it's a must see attraction but at the same time make sure you like big crowds!"
209,Great,"So hige museum. Many collections of painting, scuy, and anciant war custom. Takes 3 hour to see only 3 second for each collection"
210,Beautiful place ,I was prepared to spend most of the day at the hermitage and that was not enough. The amount of paintings and art and rooms was overwhelming! I am not sure but this has got to be one of the largest museums in the world. Be prepared to get lost but you will enjoy every minute of it.The best way is to decide which rooms you would like to see in advance and try to find your way through them. Booking in advance is recommended
211,Stressful at times,"So many times, I'd been looking at artwork in magazines & galleries, only to read ""the original is in the Hermitage....""... so I was so happy to eventually get there! And in March, when there are not so many tourists.. mind you, you'd need a massive number of visitors to make the place feel busy! The museum is the 2nd largest in the world (after the Louvre) but it specialises in only six areas of human history.. so the collections in those topics are vast (look them up yourself!). Stupendous setting - the Tsar's Winter Palace is now part of the museum, and it's hard to imagine a place so opulent constituting ""home"". TOP TIP: We went with a tour group, who took us round the main areas, then left us to it - which was a great way to get a feel of the place before becoming overwhelmed.TOP TIP 2: If you are into the Impressionists, go to the 4th floor of the old Barracks opposite the museum. A wonderful collection.Surprisingly, very little English art, but that's the only quibble."
212,"Trip back to complexed and beautiful hisorical human past, mostly:-)","Be prepared to queue . Best with a organise party, their very strict about queuing have seen queue jumpers given short shift. Be patient it really is worth it but there is so much to see so allow plenty of time. It can get very crowded around some of the showcases,"
213,A must visit when in St. Petersburg...,How anyone could visit St Petersburg and not visit the Hermitage could not be explained - take a day or even two to see the wonders that lie within.
214,Magnificent Museum,This museum is huge. I spent nearly 4 hours wandering the halls and I think I saw about 1/4 of it. For 800 rubles it was certainly worth the price. A great example of European art and culture.
215,Endless Number of Exhibits - Outstanding and a real Adventure,This is without a doubt one of the best museums in the world. The building itself is worth visiting but it has some of the world's masterpieces too.
216,Some worthwhile tips.... but worth the visit,"One would need more than just a day to fully appreciate everything in it.  I would describe it more as an art gallery than a palace.   Having said that it is awesome.  Looking out of the windows onto the square, you could easily conjure up a picture in your minds eye what the…"
217,Hermitage,"Huge! Absolutely fascinating.Beautiful.A credit to the caretakers.A must to see bygone era of Opulence and the History. Waited 40 years to see the museum and well worth the wait.Winter is a good time to visit, no crowds."
218,Needs a Good Tour Guide,"Is a must, to see how they used to live, needs more time then they allow you because is always very busy"
219,"So big, so good.","I have visited many of the world's best museums including the Louvre, the Prado, and the Vatican Museum.  The State Hermitage museum ranks right up there with them with excellent exhibits.  We spent about 4 hours and we did not do it justice.  Should have planned for a full day at least.  During high season the Hermitage can be crowded."
220,Fabulous treasures,"This was my second time to visit. Spent 4 hours and wish I had a whole week. The place is in 2 buildings. It is wise to preview in advance what you want to see so you can head right there. I zeroed in on Egyptian civilization, Roman and Greek sculptures, and Impressionism. Cafe us small and may be too busy if you rest when everyone else does. Wear good shoes and be prepared for massive crowds."
221,Amazing structure and museum,I could not wait to see Catherine’s collection of art and it did not disappoint. Her collection was exquisite.  I highly recommend a visit to this museum along with Catherine collection there are other arts if work and showcase that are phenomenal.
222,History and culture at the same place,"On a cruise in Russia one has to take your passport out with you, then everyone’s warns how many tourists are robbed and have to somehow make the 700 mile journey to Moscow to the embassies. The Hermitage has the worst reputation. Yes it has some beautiful paintings if people actually let you see them and beautiful gold in the gold room, but the hassle and tension wasn’t worth it, go in January when it’s freezing and no tourists just pickpockets!"
223,No words to decribe,"Must go!We bought ""skip the line"" tickets. Still we were queuing for one hour. So bring warm clothes.But don't worry. It is well worth it!The most wonderful museum I've ever been at."
224,So much treasures to see in The Hermitage Museum,"This treasure is THE reason to visit St Petersburg.  At the very least spend several hours in the morning, then lunch or rest and return to spend more time in the afternoon or evening.  It is huge and can be overwhelming but taken a bit at a time there are works of art beyond imagination."
225,How can one review perfection?,Visiting this museum will take the whole day or at least half a day. The architecture and the interior of the building itself is amazingly beautiful. All the exhibitions are really interesting. We love the Egypt section and the painting section. It is worth to spend a day there.
226,A very good museum,"I would budget the entire day for visit, some guides only give you a few hours to visit which is not enough time to fully explore"
227,Amazing Museum,We spent 1.5 days at the Hermitage and it was still not enough time. Knew before going it was one of the most revered museums in the world. After visiting I understand why it is considered so highly.
228,Amazing,"We bought two-day online tickets.After approaching the ticket counter we were pointed in the direction of the main entrance and told to simply scan our barcode.  After lining up there, we were told that the online ticket's barcode would not work and that we would have to use a separate entry.We went back to the ticket counter to clarify where we should go, and were told once again to use the main entry, to which we replied that we'd been turned away.  The woman in the ticket counter phoned the information desk, and a woman came and informed us that we would have to go outside and use another entrance made especially for online tickets - and walked away.  I then asked after her, ""where abouts outside?"" to which she barked in reply, ""You have the information on your ticket, so read it."" and stalked back to the information desk, only to look at her phone and do nothing in particular.We were left aghast and disgusted to have been spoken to so rudely, as paying customers, especially after being given the wrong information, twice, by the ticket counter staff.We eventually did find the online entrance (through no help of the information included with the online ticket) but the whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths and just about ruined the rest of our day.Additionally, later, when we asked various staff members for directions, none of them proved to have given us the correct information.Overall a great museum and worth going, but don't bother asking the rude, incompetent staff for anything."
229,So much to see!,This review will never come close to describing how massive a museum this is with such a huge collection that apparently would take you 10 years to admire even if you only spent a single minute at each exhibit.  Basically you name it and they have it.  We spent 3 hours there with a local guide who did a great job giving us a taste of the major exhibits. I particularly loved the green malachite exhibits.One of the most impressive places I have ever visited.I would love to return several times to look at specific rooms.Highly recommended.
230,"Beautiful, enormous and crowded.","We booked the guided tour through the site visitaresanpietroburgo.it (highly recommended) Our guide Irina was punctual and precise in organizing the route starting from the Palazzo di Stato Maggiore, which houses the amazing Impressionist collection, to then continue with the visit  in the majestic buildings of the Hermitage.  Many are the advantages of having the guide: you avoid the tickets optimizing the times, and you move easily from one room to another, without the danger of letting you miss the most significant works ... A mine of artistic information and links  historical-cultural that go far beyond a simple audioguide.  If you want to round off your day, I recommend the suggestive carriage ride around the Piazza del Palazzo ... 4 minutes fabulous at an acceptable price (5 € per person)"
231,The Hermitage,Visited for one day and it was amazing! We went around 11-12 on a Friday in December. There was no lines so we got in very quickly. We bought the tickets from the machines out side of the Hermitage and the tickets were very affordable. I loved the architecture of the place and was in awe of the place. I spent a lot of time looking at the ceiling & chandeliers. Highly encourage to visit the museum (even if museums are not your thing).
232,This is a mind-blowing museum,"Great exhibitions, great pieces of art. Long waiting lines if you dont have tickets. No material available to find yourself around in the museum/building. Staff dont speak English or any other language."
233,Amazing,"My tour guide, Olga, was amazing.  She was thorough, considerate and knowledgeable.  I did the morning tour leaving at 10:00 am, and I would highly recommend this.  We skirted past all the lines (and the ensuing chaos) and the visit was really enjoyable.  I had multiple opportunities to view world famous masterpieces in almost complete solitude because I chose the early admission.  Had I waited even 15 minutes later, it would have been a different story.Olga was really amazing, and after the tour when I was in the gift shop reviewing one of the English-language guides, I realized that she had shown me 90% of the highlights from the guides in just 3 hours.  She has an intuitive knowledge of the museum, Russian and European art history and a lot of general knowledge to really make this worthwhile.  I can't recommend this tour enough.  The Hermitage is overwhelming with its wealth of art, and an experienced tour guide will help you to really appreciate it."
234,Hermitage Museum - Outstanding,"Don't worry about booking on line justvturnbupbat 10 and wait for 30 minutes in the ticket queue, so many people buy on line they stand in their own queue just as long, the place us great and the ticket also allows entry into the principle building, well worth the 700 rubles"
235,Excellent,"Not being into art at all, I spent a full afternoon there, amazed by the magnificent rooms (I actually did not really looked at the art itself, the surrounding being so incredible)À definite must do, as you probably well know it already"
236,Very crowded ,The Eremitage is not to miss; unfortunately due to the mass tourism you should buy your ticket online. Allow 2 days to visit the Eremitage.
237,Prepare to be Overwhelmed,"We were in the Hermitage for about 2 - 3 hours! It needs at least 2-3 days to explore this museum, and even then you would not cover all of it. It is truly magnifcient. A must see if you are in St. Petersburg!"
238,Amazing Palace and Museum,"The State Hermitage Museum is without any doubt an amazing museum with a vast amount of European, Russian, Asian, and so forth, art.What spoiled the experience however is the behavior of the visitors while queuing to get in. The waiting time is non negligible, beware of that. So people start getting nervous to get in and therefore try skipping the queue - which is rather annoying - or you realize that the one person in front of you was actually queuing for an entire group that shows up just before entering - which is even more annoying. Also, even if you are allowed to enter for free (like students) you have to pass by the main counter and cannot use the ticket vending machines (if they actually work, because they didn’t when we were there)."
239,Simply stunning,"this place was amazing. the attention to detail and everything is just awe inspiring. when i grow up, i want a place like that. haha"
240,Amazing,"It really lives up to its reputation as one of the great museums of the world. Impossible to get it all in in one visit. We focussed on the Siberian Antiquities wing, and was richly rewarded."
241,Highly recommended Hermitage ,"The plaza that never ends.  So bland so dull.  It belies the treasures  inside however.  The Hermitage is filled with unique pieces you've never seen anywhere, like the Peacock clock.  It's so Extra."
242,So much to see,"I visited the museum on a rainy morning, standing in line for hours, but it was a unique experience.  It was amazing to see the works of artists from all over the world, and it is worth spending hours ..."
243,one of the most magnificent palaces I've seen,"What can I tell? If you like museums, this must be in your top three. This is like the Met, the Louvre, the Vaticani. This is better than the Britsh Museum, Rijksmuseum, the Kunsthistorisch Museum Vienna or Prado. At one side of the square the old splendour of the Hermitage with its old European masters, Russian glory and the antiquities. At the other side a 21st century building with Picasso, Cezanne, Van Gogh and name all other Grand masters of the 19th and early 20th century. I have booked 2 days in a row and that wasn’t enough. Tips:Order your tickets in advance, it’a only a little bit extra. But you can skip the lines. Avoid the main entrance when it’s busy. There are more and more modern ones. And don’t get lost!"
244,Here are few tips to make your trip a little hassle free + a map to help navigate.,We didn't book tickets in advance instead used the ticket machines in the courtyard to avoid the queues inside. Was very busy with groups and no room in cloakrooms so I'd suggest arriving first thing or later in the day. Make sure you get map to navigate and enjoy the fascinating collection. I'm not a huge arty fan but you can't help but be wowed at the Hermitage.
245,Incredible!,"The reputation preceded it, but it was absolutely deserved. There is a huge amount to see, so decide in advance what you are interested in. We looked mainly at the rooms and Russian culture. Don’t miss the art collection over the road at the staff department."
246,Must see,A must for any visit to St Petersburg. This overwhelming museum will transport you back in time. Allow plenty of time to do it at your leisure and visit the museum cafe to revitalise yourself. Find the peacock clock!
247,Stunning and beautiful collect,"Can be very busy with coach parties. Be prepared for airport style security on entry., and you may have to drop a bag or coat in the cloakroom. Be prepared for a whole day here. It does have a good cafe however."
248,Wow,"You can have a comment of an unknown painter, and just beside have a Bosch painting without any comment. 500rb for nothing."
249,Amazing but busy,So unexpected but those working at the museum are not at all trained to deal with tourists. One of the worst services of my life.
250,Set Aside At Least 3 Hours to Tour This Museum!,The Hermitage Museum is the museum of art and culture. It was founded in 1764. I would suppose it will take you 3-4 hours to see it all. There are cafes at the exit way for a quick snack. The Museum is magnificent and no words will be sufficient to describe our experience. It is surely a must visit.  SEE photos.
251,Wow,"We were lucky to have a pre-opening tour. Even then the museum is crowded and the attendance urges you to keep on walking. When we came out people queued up over several blocks. Sometimes the museum is open for free, but then it 's completely impossible to see anything. We advise you urgently to book a guided tour, since individuals are run over by groups and there is too much to see to make a choice what to see."
252,So much to see,Its big....so big that to see everything would take three days..But its such a wonderful sight you must visit.. Takes a while to see the remarkable building and square...Its a must see..
253,Must-See in  St. Petersburg,I have been here twice.  First time was in 1984 and again in 2019. The crowds now are huge so pre-booking is a must to avoid terrible queues to get in.  The Hermitage contains many masterpieces and is a must see for SPB. Toilet facilities are very limited  at the entrance with long queue for that too
254,Wow,"The State Hermitage Museum is located in the Palace Square, in the center of Saint Petersburg, the main city in the North-Western region in Russian Federation.It is an enormous (really it is one of the biggest museums in the world) museum, where you can see a lot of artworks of different periods of the history and different places on world. In fact, the architecture and the rooms of the palace are an incredible museum, where some tzars keep their private collections, which nowadays are this museum. In fact, you can see some buildings, where you can see Prehistoric Art, Classic and Helenistic Art, Roman Art, Far East Art, obviously Russian Art, or Italian, Spanish, Flemish paintings and different paintings of artistic movements like impressionism, surrealism, etc. Incredible! you can walk during hours and not finish the visit. Incredible! Fantastic! Great place! Rooms, halls, stairs and artworks: a perfect combination!(see also Winter Palace of Peter I, the general staff buildings)"
255,The no. 1 place to visit in Saint Petersburg,"Buy tickets in tickets machine inside the Hermitage yard, to avoid queues. And be ready to spend at least 4 hours there. Although, the cafe inside the museum is not that good, so don't go hungry :)"
256,Amazing,Very awesome. Was there nearly for three hours. This is one of the must visit places. Definetly take a tour guide.
257,Fabulous museum!,"Words are not enough to describe the wealth and opulence of this museum. Half day is not enough to see every room and appreciate the endless masterpieces and designs, but at the same time it can be quite overwhelming. We were kind of lead to believe the Golden Room would be worthwhile visiting, so we paid for extra tickets and went in. I was faily disappointed, although it displayed an interesting ancient gold collection purchased by the Russian Empire, nothing was not impressive and we wasted our time there, whereas we could have been looking at more beautiful and interesting rooms in the Museum."
258,not to miss,"In case you are an artist or a history buff, this is not one days tour, but you can spend a week at least studying it's magnificience. We friends, had the luxury to visit it only for a day. It is worth seeing at daytime as well as, wih beautiful lighting, at night. A rare experience if you are in St Petersburg, which as you know is nearly that you are on edge of Europe!"
259,"This museum is a must-see.  unlike other famous museums (Prada,Louvre,Reiks)","First let me say that I visited on a Tuesday in November. Having read lots of reviews, especially the summer ones seem to indicate a complete different experience than the one I had. So keep that in mind.  There was a 5 minute queue to the ticket boot, and I handed over my UK college student card which the lady in the ticket boot studied for at least a minute. She then sighed deeply, and handed it back to me with my free entry pass. Hurrah! (I have read that peopel have had problems getting their student cards accepted if it doesn't have the ISIC logo, but as it is not actually stated at the ticket boot that they only accept ISIC cards I decided to try my luck. It worked).I handed in my bag and jacket to the cloakroom. Oh my, rude doesn't even cover the attitude of the attendant. She looked like she wanted to be anywhere other than there and treated everyone with the utmost discontempt. If I would even dare to have half the attitude like that in my job I would be fired on the spot. Security was a breeze, even when I had to get back out again to retrieve a spare battery for my camera (and face the wrath of rude woman at the cloakroom a second time). They let me back in without any problems. Now to the actual museum. Wow. Ah-ma-zing! Both the interiors of the palace, the massive over the top decorated rooms, and the art works were superb. As it was a weekday in November it really wasn't busy. I could move freely around the rooms, no pushy tourists around. Yes, certain tour groups were annoying but as others have said, they don't actually seem to care much about what they see and just want a quick photo before moving on so if you waited a minute, they would be in the next room. I even managed to get photos without anyone in them which is apparently very rare :)I focussed on seeing the 1st floor interiors, and the (Early) Dutch and Flemish paintings. I also saw the Rembrandt exhibition (which was basically a few paintings they normally house anyway and sketches) and the portraits of the Russian Royal family. This took about 3 hours in total. I would have loved to have seen the Italian paintings but got quite tired and there aren't many spaces to sit down, so that will have to wait till next time. One note about the Information supplied: I didn't get the audio guide as I didn't want to pay 500R for it. There are signs in the Palace Rooms explaining what the room is / used to be, and photographs of what they used to look like around teh time of Nicolas II. However, there is much lengthier info in Russian then in English and if you don't read Russian, you do feel like you are missing out quite a bit. So bring a good guide book that can tell you about the rooms as the map doesn't have any info on it either. I then went back to the cloakroom to retrieve my things (read: have them thrown at me) and walked to Peter I 's winter palace next door. I am glad I did not pay for this as I did not feel it was up to much. A few rooms, some clothing and that's it. All in all I had a great visit. My tips are: go in quieter times if you can, bring a student card if you have one (preferably an ISIC one), if you have to pay skip the winter palace of Peter I, bring a good guide book or Google beforehand so you have an idea already of the rooms, and watch your belongins if it is busy as I have been told that pickpockets operate freely in the museum. And put on your best smile for the ""lovely"" ladies at the cloakroom ;)"
260,Just wow,"The fact the impressionists collection has been stripped out is a major failing, I only found out too late to go to the other location, given all the queuing delays."
261,Summer Palace - Hermitage Museum,"Beautiful museum, could have spent the entire day here. Actually liked it better than the Louvre. If you like art museums you will love The Hermitage."
262,Mind blowing ,"From start to finish, a great experience. We bought tickets online in advance and had no line to get in (used the side entrance), checked our coats and bought the audioguide (incredibly useful, as not everything is in Russian and English, but also, not a lot of audio descriptions compared to all the artwork to be seen, more could be included). The building is amazing! So beautiful! But do come up with and follow a map plan, get yours at the entrance and make it a point to organize how you view it, it was confusing the flow of the exhibitions...and don't forget to visit the opposite side of the museum (not mentioned to us upon arriving at the Winter Palace) as they host the modern art of the Hermitage collection and the building is equally amazing."
263,excellent,"If you are going on a cruise or just going to St Petersburg make sure you see this museum. If you aren't with a tour group make sure you are there when they open. Bring comfortable shoes and take in every bit you can of the museum. I don't think it can be done in one day, but what history. They do have places to hand your coats. Just Enjoy!"
264,"Don't Try to Skip this, a must.",I visit every time I come to St Petersburg. Buy a ticket online and start at 10 am. Special entrance through small Hermitage for online tickets. It usually gets busier later on.
265,Wonderful! biggest on world! incredible museum!,"So incredibly beautiful. And even if you don't like the styles, you only can be amazed by the overwhelming richness of all collections"
266,A Massive Museum filled with incredible art and artifacts,A Must do ! Make sure you don't do a commercial group Tour. Get a personal guide who is a qualified PhD or similar in History and/ or Impressionism as this place has the best Rembrandt collection anywhere in the world !
267,GRANDEUR & HISTORY,According to my fitbit I walked 9517 steps in this place and I have to be honest i'm not sure I actually saw all of it... it is just stunning everywhere you look..
268,The best museum I have ever visited,"This is the one museum to see if you only have time because there is just too much that you could never be able see in a few weeks. The entry lines are about an hour long so bel prepared to wait in line. If you are with Viking Cruise Lines you are able to skip it. The art is the best compilation of artists: Rembrandt, has the lines. If I were to suggest the must see attraction is The Golden Peacock Timeclock."
269,"Crowded and busy, but worth the effort.","This is obviously the place to go To really cover it all you need the full day. If time does not allow I would recommend to visit the wonderful collection of impressionists, which is unique in a way and one of the biggest in Europe.And of course go and see Rembrandt, it is a must seeOtherwise it is so great there will not be enough space to describe"
270,one of the best,"The second world largest art museum in the world after the Louvre.  Of course you have to make a visit.  Luckily we were on a tour organized by our Cruise.  With tickets for a guided tour we had a special entrance. Bags and coats have to be stored in the coat room. The tour guide was very knowledgeable.  The museum is amazing and you can easily spend several hours or a whole day depending on your interest.  We visited on a Sunday in early October and it did not feel too overwhelming in terms of visitors.  There were of course large groups that “took over” certain vantage points, but you could find a space to enjoy undisturbed."
271,Hermitage is beautiful,Came as part of a guided tour just the two of us not as many visitors in winter. But just out of this world truly magnificent in everything you looked at well set out can get extremely busy and hot in summer no air con. They it is number two museum in the world I would make it number one building and rooms are just amazing. Looking forward to going back some day.
272,Overwhelming ,"Make sure you have at least a whole day available for this artistic splendour! And also pay attention to your personal belongings, I've heard many stories about visitors being pickpocketed."
273,You visit St. Petersburg for the Hermitage Museum,One of the best collections in the world! So extensive that the two-day pass is not enough to see half of what they have! I hope to return!
274,Huge!,A must do - gorgeous outside and fascinating inside. If you don’t want to pay for a tour all the exhibits have English descriptions on them. The inside of the Palace is just so beautiful it’s worth going to see this alone. I had a teenager with me and she enjoyed it. A word of warning - the queues are huge! Buy your tickets online but DON’T pay extra for ‘skip the line’ as there is no special queue. We went over the New Years so it was super busy. There is a different entrance for online tickets but no ‘skip the queue’ line. You get into the same line as you would for everyone else who has bought tickets online - that said the line is shorter than it would be if you just rocked up & bought your ticket at the gate. Still the wait was still 45 minutes so get there early.
275,Amazingly thorough and informative introduction to one of the great museums of Europe,"I’m not going to repeat what ours have already mentioned about how incredible beautiful this place is. First, buy skip the line tickets online. You won’t regret this as the queue for normal tickets was very long. And I mean very long. If you buy the skip the lines tickets, you’ll enter the museum from a different entrance (marked nr.15 on the map) where there is hardly if any queue. And around this part of the museum wasn’t crowded. Second, do some research about the history before arriving. It will help you understand & know what your looking at. And it will also help you plan a bit better, all that you want to see. The cafeteria, Others have mentioned that prices are quite high/expensive, which isn’t. It’s almost the same prices elsewhere around the city. So don’t stress about it and just enjoy you day.I’ve included a map of the 3 floors. I found it much easier to have the map on my phone, because I use my phone to take pictures and have the map all in one place. Plus it was easier to zoom in, which made it easier to navigate. If you found my post to be helpful, please do give it a thumbs up."
276,Hermitage,"The original time for the tour was changed the night before so our guide showed up 15 minutes late. Because I had another tour after this one, I had about an hour and a half on tour instead of 3 hours. Our guide didn’t give us a lot of information yet we moved very slowly thru the museum. The guide made comments that I think were supposed to be funny or something, but for the most part I had no idea what he meant. I think with a good guide and one that speaks with enthusiasm is needed for this tour to be interesting. The museum is big so allow extra time on your own to explore."
277,Don't try to see it all,"If you're in St. Petersburg, you really have to see the Hermitage, and that's a well-known fact, as the crowd lined up outside waiting to get in will demonstrate. It represents Imperial Russia and all that was glorious about it. We visited with a private guide, with a specific time of entry, and it was still a madhouse. The fact that it was raining probably had something to do with the craziness, but there was a huge crowd trying to get in a single door. It's hard to believe that a place as important as the Hermitage has such a sub-standard entrance. Unfortunately, that crowd outside came inside with you, and I found the tour itself to be a bit of a cattle call - you were herded around in large groups, to allow traffic to move alternately in both directions on a single center hall. Notwithstanding my complaints about the crowd, the building is simply spectacular. The Throne Rooms (one large, one small) and The Gold Room are awesome. The scope and majesty of the palace itself is awesome. You could spend as much time as you want in this group of buildings, but you probably need a couple of hours at a bare minimum."
278,An exclusive Hermitage of art and culture,I'm a history guy but honestly not an art museum guy.....so I thought.  The Hermitage just sucks you in.  There is such an extensive collection of the world's masters and then some.  It is utterly amazing.  Hard to fathom the importance of what lies within the walls.  Handicap accessibility is limited but the staff went above and beyond to assist me with my father in a wheelchair.  A mind blowing museum and palace.
279,This museum is massive and it is unforgettable.,"The Hermitage has a remarkable collection of paintings. In particular, I found the Rembrandt paintings to be among the finest I've seen anywhere in the world.However, in my opinion, lots of the huge collection seemed to be second-rate art from first-rate artists."
280,Fabulous ,This was again included in a package visit on our cruise.  An early start to the day meant we had the privilege to enter before the museum opened.  What a treat!  this has to be the most incredible collection of art treasures in the world.  The visit was enhanced by our knowledgeable guide who it seemed knew every painting and treasure in the place.  We were told that it could take 7 years to just look at each piece for one minute.  sadly we only had around 1 and a half hours so barely scratched the surface.  If you are in st Petersburg and only get to one place then this must be it.
281,Such opulence!,"At first I expected it to be like any typical museum but when I went in, I saw they had everything and it took way longer to explore than I expected. I was there about 4-5 hours total and I only saw a fraction of the artwork there. I recommend you spend 4-8 hours there over 2-5 days (I only went there twice over 2 days)."
282,Amazing and a Second visit will be needed,"A definite must see, but even in a small group of six people, it would have been better if our guide had a wireless delivery system. What you need here is no more than 3 hours with a guide, then two or three hours to explore on your own or as a couple. Use the cafe for a break in between. Why not go at 4pm, after the boat groups have left?"
283,Huge collection,"This place is so vast that you need to be prepared to spend quite a few hours there. Plan what you want to see and take time, do not rush. If you feel tired go to the coffee shops and have a coffee and rest your feet. You can easily get lost and we landed up walking past the same area several times and every time saw something different. There is really so much to see but if you in St Petersburg it is worth a visit!"
284,Amazing!  ,"Of all the things I have seen and done - this is the best.  You are walking in the footsteps of great persons once living there, overwhelmed by beauty and history. The time, however long, is too short - I did not ever want to leave. Please use a guide to help you sort, move forward and get the history of what you are seeing."
285,Note for electric wheelchair users,"All one can find in путеводители is only for make a wish. Where u enter, u are happy and also if u we’re cuing u find it worth. Just enjoy. The moment. The time you have for this fantastic place.PS Plan your visit. Explore every before u book your ticket. For get the best."
286,Art heaven,This very impressive attraction has wheelchair access via a revolving door.  There is a chair lift to access the various sets of stairs but it has size and weight restrictions which are not well publicised.  The museum has its own manual wheelchair which they provide to visitors who need itMy wheelchair (Jazzy Salsa) was too big for the chair lift and I unfortunately could not do the tour but anyone I spoke to said it was worth a visit
287,Someone use to live here!  The Winter Palace,Queues can be a nightmare. Systems for tickets and entry can be hard to understand. Once you get in the confusion continues - the organisation and layout are a bit of a mish-mash and it is hard to work out what paintings are where. You can easily get to the end of a very hard day and discover that you failed to see a few really special paintings. The Rembrandts are superb. But the way most paintings are displayed (lighting especially) is poor and they suffer a lot from glare.The modern works (in the long horseshoe shaped building opposite the main Hermitage) is better organised and has some fabulous Impressionist works.The whole experience is a bit of a marathon. We are very fit and yet still we were exhausted and even a little frustrated at the end of a frantic 10hr visit. Glad we went but it was not a relaxing experience.
288,Amazing art history ,"Of course you have to see the Hermitage, and from the moment you're through security and you go up the opulent staircase it's amazing. It's absolutely huge so you can't see everything though. The sheer scale of it and the crowds might be almost overwhelming for some. We were surprised at the huge number of Chinese tour groups and it was sad to see how rude, pushy and generally disrespectful a lot of them were. So be prepared for large groups crowding round all the famous exhibits, pushing and shoving. Some people just seem to want to stand right in front of every art work, have a photo of themselves and then quickly move on to the next thing without actually bothering to look at anything properly! It can be hard to get close enough to see and you'll either have to jostle or try to wait for a short gap before another group swarms in front of you.I'd expected to see many fabulous paintings but there's a vast array of other things as well, such as Michelangelo's Crouching Boy sculpture and the amazing gold ""Peacock Clock"" which was made in London.We went with a guide and I's recommend this. Ours was great as she was able to pick out the highlights in each room which meant we made the most of it in the time we had and saw much more than we would have done if we'd have gone on our own.  She even pointed out a dog that bears a striking resemblance to a certain Russian President!Is it worth going? Yes definitely! Photos are allowed inside and there's also a nice café."
289,The must see location,Incredible. One of the best museums I’ve been to. I’m not sure where to start- the rooms go on and on!!! The Italians do shoes; the Russians do massive rooms and huge chairs! A must visit. On-line tickets save the queue.
290,Spend a Week,"Impossible to come up with any new superlatives to describe the sheer extravagances to be experienced, but a simple word of caution to ensure you avoid frustration and disappointment:  go EARLY.  By that I mean be there at opening time or you will be forced to endure ridiculous queues, seething mobs and completely obstructed views.  Essential advice.  It's a zoo!!"
291,Den of Thieves,"Well, the lines are absurdly long, but if you go inside and buy your tickets from the machines, you’ll save one hour of your time! Be prepared to be stunned!And also, they have an audioguide that you can download in your cell phone. I picked the 3 hours one."
292,"Beautiful, but big and not organized","This is a must see but if time and budget allows, break it down to a few visits. Impossible to absorb it all in one day. The state rooms alone are a trip alone, then the artwork. Otherwise go on a Wednesday when it closes at 9pm to have extra time. Every 3rd Thursday of the month the entrance is free. Monday’s are closed. Download a self guided tour as the details on each exhibit/room are sparse. It is not clear which direction to take. Worth planning ahead what you really want to see. Buy your ticket at the ticket machine as you come through the arch and avoid the long queues. You must leave your coats at the cloakroom, free of charge. You cannot take water with you and the cafes are at the end of the tour so you may need to take a break."
293,Not What It Was!,"I'm not going to bang on about size, as everyone does that. Yes, it's huge. And there's a lot to see. I'm also going to start by saying that it's monumentally wonderful. And did I mention awesome? It's that too. And wandering round the Gormenghastic complexity of all those fabulously decorated rooms in the Old Winter Palace makes you realise exactly why the shots rang out that July day down at Ipatiev House. So that's the background, and I'll concentrate on the cavils (an why not - it's a review).Many complain about queuing, and it's clear by the white lines on the square outside that queues happen, but we'd bought our tickets online beforehand, and it was off-season (mid-September), so we could walk straight into each of the buildings without  even stopping. Indeed, the pair of us had Peter the Great's original palace to ourselves.Now, my first cavil here is about tickets. Reasoning that we might like a visit that was easier on the feet, we splashed out on a two-day ticket, thinking that this would allow multiple entry. Nope. You can go into each building only once per day. So once you're in, you're in to stay, and if you want to go back, you have to wait until the next day. I can see why, in peak season, this is sensible, but it would have helped to know.Second cavil: audience. It's the world's biggest collection of artworks, and it's obvious to anyone that nobody can see them all without spending weeks there. So, targeting seems reasonable - making a list of the sort of things you want to see. And here you hit a problem of information availability. The plans of the buildings give you room numbers and a vague description of what's in certain sections 'Egyptian artefacts'; 'Dutch Painting'. But there doesn't seem to be a resource on-site that tells you what's in which room (so, for example, if you want to see Catherine the Great's jewellery or the Picasso Blue Period stuff, no-one there can tell you where to find them). Yes, you can fire up the website, but that's really something to be done in advance, and it would be useful to know that. Clearly, then, unless you do your work in advance, using the website (whose search facility isn't terribly helpful), then once you're there, you're stuck. And the staff aren't terribly helpful or well-clued-up.It seems, really, that the audience, for the most part, is casual, generally undiscerning visitors who just want to say they've been.On a side-note, you have to laugh at Trip Advisor's algorithms. While writing the review for The Hermitage, I notice that the 'could you say more about it?' questions were hysterically inappropriate: 'does this shop sell athletic apparel?'; 'does this shop sell electronics?'. And, lastly, 'does this shop sell art?' I answered 'not sure' to this last one. I'm saying nothing."
294,Magnificent!!,"IMO ranks with the Louvre, Rijksmuseum, the Metropolitan and the Pergamon as the world's greatest museums."
295,Don't mention Ekaterinburg,"The State Hermitage Museum is the second largest art museum in the world and has the world's largest collection of paintings. The gallery is organised with artists from each country grouped together and in total there are three million works of art although only a small proportion of those are on display. The museum is made up of six separate buildings all running alongside the banks of the Neva river. The buidings are elaborately decorated inside with a LOT of gold...so even if you are not a fan of the art, the palace buildings making up the museum are a feast for the eyes in their own right.Because there is so much on display, it would be advisable to have a guided tour so you can focus on the more famous, significant or valuable pieces. It can get very busy at times, but our 'early entry' guided tour started 30 minutes ahead of the public opening times so we got to see a large part of the museum free from the crowds, which was well worth it.There are expansive collections of the most celebrated artists in the world, it truly is an amazing museum, and if visiting St Petersburg for the first time it is one of the must see attractions."
296,Biggest Museum in the World,"Plan,plan and plan some more. If you can get a map of the Hermitage and plan what you want to see especially if you have one day or less. Photos don’t do it justice so think about getting one of their DVDs."
297,Lovely museum and architecture,"Due to COVID-19, only limited access was available, but on the other hand, was able to see without much crowd.I wish the route was setup better so that we could see more of the displays."
298,Guided tour,"Follow a few rules to make your visit easier.Buy your ticket from the self help ticket machines to the left and right one you enter the courtyard with the trees. You can pay by credit card. Just make sure you take out the actual ticket and not just your receipts, as the ticket sometimes takes longer to come out. Then skip the queue as they are waiting to buy tickets inside, just walk to the front and show your ticket, inside is chaotic. If you are wearing a coat ( which is a must in Autumn/winter) or have a big bag you will first need to check them in at the cloak room with is even more chaotic, so just remember which check in you went to as there are many of them , they are all numbered. When you want to collect your coat, you can go to the front of the queue as they get full and need people to collect before they can accept more, so don’t wait in the queue to collect.... the trip is worth the effort as it contains many things to see, as most of the reviews will say...And go early.... as it gets busier especially when there are cruise ships docked."
299,Must Visit Museum,"Don't let your guard down for a single moment. There are thieves and spotters everywhere. Fully prepared for this, I was guarding my expensive camera for 3 hours and occasionally looking out for criminals. But as I exited through a mostly empty lobby at the end of our tour, I let my camera hang to the side as I walked at quite a pace. I made a few notes on my phone and put it away and carried on walking. As I descended into the busier cloakroom area someone tried to push past me gently on my left side, then suddenly knocked my shoulder. A second later someone ""stomped"" right across my path with a rucksack, obviously designed to make me look at him (the decoy). 3 seconds later I realized my camera was light and discovered the lens was gone. I spun around and could not spot anyone suspicious immediately behind me or in the crowd. Another man called out from the side benches - ""they went that way!!"" and so I headed off in that direction unable to find anyone acting differently.(He could well have been in on it too). The whole thing only took about 5 or 6 seconds. Our Russian tour guide quickly spoke to the Hermitage staff who responded that it was all my fault and that there was no CCTV footage available. The museum knows full well that tourists are robbed of tens of thousands of dollars worth of belongings each day at the Hermitage and choose to do nothing about it. I was told another tourist from Italy was robbed of $5000 cash the same morning. Reporting it to anybody is pointless including the police. You are on your own in a society that is corrupt and complicit. Enjoy the Hermitage as much as you can, but constantly scan each room for the spotters and pick pockets that prey on tourists. Don't get into crowds (almost impossible) and watch behind you at all times. Sounds like a fun day out right? Treat everyone around you as a criminal. Once you are targeted there is little you can do. Looking back at photos taken by my partner I believe I was followed for some time before I gave the gang a few seconds of luck. I've since read it's a good idea to cover all logos on cameras and lenses with black tape and reverse the straps which advertise the type of camera you are carrying. This crime wave is common in many places throughout the world but in St. Petersburg the criminals are exceptionally well prepared and trained. The one thing I salvaged from the whole experience is that I will always be the better person. Honesty and integrity can never be stolen or bought. Those are priceless qualities that have to be earned:)"
