0,Amazing,"Spent my birthday here, and done the cage of death dive with Wendell.... absolutely had the best experience ever, highly recommended.... love this park, will definitely do cage of death again"
1,Well worth it we did the VIP tour and it was Fantastic,"Had a great time visiting here and doing the cage of death with william was worth every dollar to get so up and close with the beasts and admire how lucky your behind the tank watching closely how they behave and act whilst in there getting fed etc!And lucky enough to get the photo package from the photographers to showcase it when i get home..The croc dive was a real highlight with packages for photos ranging from around $30 for one photo up to $115 for a choice of 3 pictures a usb with the entire photos and 360 degrees video included,i went for the $99.95 package which was the 3 pics printed out with all footage on a disc with about 271 photos in total and the video.and the picking of 3 photos out of 271 was hard enough as the photos all come out so good with the animal so it might take some time picking it out haha..you will be instructed about the procedure of the dive which is well explained about whats what it all and you will be in the water for about 15 minutes which was plenty of time in my opinionThe cost was $170 to do the crod dive which also includes all day entry to the park where your able to come and go wether you need to goto shops etc:.it is worth really checking out the session times of the park for feeding and other activities,the staff are pretty knowledgable when it comes to the crocs and the other animals,personally wish i did stay for most of it now but had a flight out that arvo so couldnt experience it after 2:30..i enjoyed watching and learning the feeding of the barramundis and the stingrays was really good seeing it up close aswell as getting chance of watching those squirting fish shooting the bugs out the clamps really fun doing that!.they also have plenty of other animals aswell as turtles and baby crocodiles to admire also,resturant is located on the 1st floor which offers all your hot food,icecreams,savourys etc if you get abit peckish and its worth checking out the souvineer shop on the way out great presents(if you have kids) to keep them enterained with some plush's clothing or even these cool eggs that hatch after leaving them in water."
2,"Foggy mask, not worth the $175!",Had a wonderful experience visiting Crocosaurus Cove. I also did the cage of death experience with the crocodiles and it was amazing! Highly favourable towards the staff and very professional. I would highly recommend visiting this while in Darwin. It is conveniently located right in the heart of the CBD.
3,Cage of death,Honestly all i can say is WOW! I had the best time at Crocosaurus Cove doing the Cage of Death. Staff are extremely well trained and very friendly and accommodating. All the animals are beautiful and all even the reptiles put on a great show! I cant wait to return!
4,So much fun,Was a great day out - feeding the crocs and my partner went into the cage of death - would definitely recommend :)
5,Amazing,"Had a fantastic experience at Crocosaurus Cove. The highlight was the Cage of Death - a truly exhilarating experience. The team at Croc Cove were professional, friendly and enthusiastic. A great day out."
6,Crocasaurus ,"An amazing experience in “The Cage of Death”. Diving with the Crocs a surreal experience. A great set up central in the CBD, the service from all staff was excellent and the Handlers very professional. The Crocs were amazing to see close up."
7,great experience,"We had such a nice time in the ""cage of death"". Really awsome experience and very helpfull staff. In total we did not find the rest of the Crocosaurus that interesting, but then agian, we dont think its fair to compare it to the cage of death :) We got the ""full photo package"" which had some nice pictures in it"
8,Great experience,I did the cage of death with crocs Will & Kate and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. One of the most exciting things I have done in a while & would do it again for sure. It also has one of the best reptile collections I've seen. Located in the middle of the main street so very easy to get there.
9,CAGE OF DEATH,"We went to Crocosaurus Cove for the Cage of Death. Would definitely recommend doing that experience, otherwise maybe a little small and light on offers.Photo packages for CoD etc. quite expensive; should be more inclusive of the experience; did a photo shot with a baby croc prior, wanted extra charge for those photos; I purchased the big photo package with USB stick and reckon those extra shots should have been included in this package.Crocosaurus Cove would only benefit from giving people more photos as they then share those pics on social media which increases their publicity."
10,Graham’s Crocosaurus Cove Day Visit,"Had an amazing experience doing the cage of death croc dive. The staff were very welcoming and knowledgable, they made me feel at ease regarding the croc’s happiness! Axel was an amazing croc to swim with, although it is mildly terrifying I couldn’t recommend it more !!"
11,Check out the Cage of Death!,"My daughter swum with the crocodile and said it was the highlight of her trip!!I did the VIP experience and found our young tour guide passionate, knowledgeable, friendly and really loved her job.My 2 yr old Grandson loved the Crocs & was able to pat a baby one and also the lizards as they were able to walk around with me on the tour.Probably not quite enough to do there for a full day but certainly filled a half day up nicely.Prices were reasonable & I was able to get a discount through being a member of NRMA."
12,Croc Cove,"Had a great day out with a mate of mine, went to Crocosaurus, watched people swimming with crocodiles in the tank, we held snakes and lizards, looked at a heap of snakes lizards and other reptiles in the tanks, saw the big Barramundi in there and the other fish in the tank, going to take my girlfriend back there to swim with the crocs can't wait, awesome...."
13,Cage of Death,Very cool place.  Family friendly.My partner and I experienced the Cage of Death. Highly recommend it!
14,Awesome,Highly recommend doing the Death Cage at Crocosaurus Cove. Amazing experience for one or two people. Incredible to be that up close to them and visually look at them in a safe environment!!
15,VIP tour.,"Amazing!! My husband & I did the cage of death & it was an unforgettable experience. Well worth what you pay. To get so up close with the crocodiles is incredible. In the water for 15 mins but feels so much longer, they feed them right in front of your face so your only cms away from their mouth. Face to face it’s unreal. Highly recommend on a trip to Darwin!"
16,VIP Tour,"Amazing Experience,Been lowered into the Water with the Wild Croc,I got William & KateScary at the introduction,Signing your Life To Something Wild"
17,Great experience for families & couples,"My husband and son (15yo) did Cage of Death, great experience, got the heart racing! I did the VIP experience with our daughter (12yo), this was awesome. Fantastic guide, very knowledgeable and amazing getting up close to the animals. Would highly recommend it."
18,You need to check this place out,"I went in the 'cage of death', swimming with a croc, and it was one of the coolest experiences of my life! Staff were professional and friendly. The experience of being in the water with a croc was simply amazing!!The rest of the park was ok but not super interesting for someone who has been to many Australian wildlife parks. BUT, the cage of death made it all worth it. Would do it again in a heart beat."
19,Crocosaurus Cove,"Enjoyed my experience, was happy to be put with Axel after requesting a big croc.  He put on a show and I loved how close he came, we virtually touched noses through the slits in the cage. Overall though it ended up being very expensive with the photo package! I believe the baby croc photos should be free to simply be placed on the usb after already purchasing the full photo package from the cage of death. Also especially considering the venue doesn't have its own designated parking either and the street requires pay. Also the cage could do with scratch repair or replacing, again considering how much money theyd make on these alone that happen throughout the whole day everyday. Glad I ticked this off my bucket list though"
20,Amazing!,"My husband an I did the cage of death, and what a bloody good experience getting up close with these amazing animals worth every cent spent, the rest of the park is good Also with shows running all the time not just the feeding of animals but learning about them to seeing how powerful a crocs bite is ect, food at the cafe was good as well, Only major down fall is parking horrible to find a park make sure you also have Change on you as the paid parking does not accept cards."
21,Croc swim,Crocosaurus Cove is a great family friendly place. The cage of death experience (adults) was fantastic! Was lucky to see Axle - a 900kg croc up close. It was fascinating.
22,AMAZING!!!!!!!!,"My wife and I did a couples cage dive with the two crocs William and Kate. The croc handlers were all very professional, understanding the behavior of the crocs to ensure a memorable experience for us. Huge thanks to all the staff at Crocosaurus Cove. Highly recommend."
23,Swimming with Crocs!,"Love crocodiles and did the cage of death, such a awesome experience and fun day! Would do it again for sure"
24,Great Family Day Out,We had a great time in the Cage of Death. Scary looking but very safe and fun. I didn't want to get out. Our chosen croc was 5mtrs long. The place itself need a complete make over but the experience was great.
25,Incredible,Loved it must do when your in Darwin we had heaps of fun in the cage of death  and got awsome pictures with the crocs
26,What a blast,My daughter and husband did the Cage of Death and it was an incredible experience.  They went in nervous and came out with smiles a mile wide and haven't stopped talking about it.  Crocosaurus Cove is a great place to visit.  The staff were lovely.
27,Stressful baby croc,We did the cage of death swimming with Crocodiles. A fun activitie on holidays . Bought the photo package with USB for souvenir. They were very professional and I felt safe all the time .
28,Excellent but..,"Hi,  some very good aspects but I’d swam with the croc and found the staff very poor.  The females (all female is ok but it is odd its all female) were young and with a poor knowledge.  Example i asked one as i got in the cage if the water was fresh or salt (basic i thought as these are salties) however she just could not answer it.  She had told me earlier how knowledgeable they were on the crocs.  I found the consuming by crocs of the string which they tied the meat on to be odd.  What’s it do to their digestion tract?  It’s 2019 not 1850 on animal care.  The photography team were a disgrace and i wish i had not paid them a penny.. rude, dismissive and unhelpful.  It’s all such a hassle when people pay you money and you might need to spend 5 minutes with them!  It’s a shame because i found the place informative and well set up in some ways.  Urgent management intervention required here."
29,Great Experience,"Overall we had a great time at Crocosaurus, the only down side was the baby crocodile. My kids were very excited to hold it but the croc was feisty and wiggly. The staff person explained that the croc was not used to be held, that's why it was struggling. .. We could see that the little baby croc was under a stressful situation as its body was tense and it was doing some noises. Hopefully we will get a better croc next time."
30,CROCOSAURUS COVE,"Awesome day, heaps to do and see. Very informative....but the crocodile tank OMG was fantastic. Highly recommend...."
31,Most Australian Experience!!,Did the cage of death experience which was definitely an experience not to miss when visiting Darwin. It is slightly overpriced and photos should be included. Overall the cove itself and the experience were really good and I would highly recommend to others.
32,Amazing,My husband did the cage of death experience. It was really good and we enjoyed it very much. The pictures they took of the experience were amazing and worth every penny 😊
33,Crocosaurus Cove,OMG !!!What a amazing Day ..Wendell is the second largest Croc 🐊 in captivity..OMG what a high we have been on the best experience ever ...
34,Great tour and guide,As a whole Crocosaurus Cove was a wonderful experience. The highlight for me was doing the cage of death and being able to get that close to now one but TWO crocodiles! Thank you to all the friendly staff for such an awesome experience!
35,Crocosaurus Gold,"Went swimming with these awesome creatures. Loved loved loved it. Rest of the Park was great.. staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Right in Darwin. Close to taxi, Coles and cafes."
36,Reptile Rangers,We did the VIP big croc tour. It was excellent. We have a reptile mad 7 year old so he loved holding a crocodile and snakes and lizards. Our guide was incredibly patient and informative. She was clearly passionate about the animals and passing on her knowledge. They have a great range of reptiles in the reptile house and viewing areas for the crocs let you feel really close to these terrific and terrifying creatures. We were there most of the day - well worth the money.
37,Must do in Darwin,"Great place to see Crocs... Right in the heart of Darwin... The ""Cage of Death"" was just stunning ans amazibg, never seen a Croc so close to me... Fantastic experience..."
38,VIP is the way to go,I did the cage of death and that was one amazing experience! I would like to see a bit more back up though maybe at ground level. You never know when something could go wrong! To see such a massive creature up close and personal like that was second to none.
39,Fantastic experience!,"first time visiting Darwin, so seeing those massive crocs up close was great. Watched from the sidelines the people who went in the water with the Croc.......I was happy with that. The children and grandparents enjoyed it too, so good for a family outing."
40,Awesome experience in the centre of Darwin City,Visited Croc Cove with another couple. Excellent experience heaps to see & the Croc’s are huge. Make sure you experience the Croc feeding. Also if you are keen on the history of Darwin they have a documentary running in the “theatre”. It’s definitely worth taking a break & watching this.
41,Awesome adventure,"Fantastic experience. We did the Cage of Death....AMAZING!!!! Staff were very informative, professional and friendly."
42,Scary but a lot of fun with crocodiles. ,"Great experience swimming with a magnificient beast, great staff.Will take my family anytime.The experience of a lifetime."
43,"Kind, straightforward, full refund","I attended today with a Cage of Death experience and a VIP tour and had Chantelle as my guide. The safety brief, for the Cage of Death,  was easy, keep everything inside the cage. During the VIP tour Chantelle was so informative. Everything rolled off of her tongue, she knew what she was doing like a pro. The conservation that this place conducts is wonderful. You MUST do a VIP tour to really grasp the gravity of the efforts being obtained at the park.Thank You Chantelle so much, you're a credit to the park and I'm sure you will succeed in any employment you choose to stay with."
44,Terrific!,One of the highlights of our trip! Was a great morning out getting close to some big crocs and even holding a baby one. Staff were so friendly and knowledgeable. A must for families or thrill seekers wanting to get into that croc cage.
45,"Mysterious, Fearsome and Fascinating",Crocosaurus Cove is a must when visiting Darwin! Loved the Cage of Death. I was lucky enough to get up close to Axel the croc.
46,Spend the whole day,Great experience swam with crocodile .  Very professional guides explained everything clearly.  Really enjoyed the adventure.
47,Cage-diving with Leo was a spectacular experience,"I visited Crocosaurus Cove and took the VIP tour under the guidance of Jess. Jess provide a real insight into the life and times of crocodiles, other amphibians and reptiles. There were five people in the group, and Jess ensured that each one had the opportunity to get a real hands on experience with these amazing creatures. She provided a very professional and friendly experience and I thoroughly enjoyed my day at Crocosaurus Cove. Thank you Jess! Jess and the other friendly staff made my visit fantastic and one of the highlights of my visit to the NT"
48,Crocs in the heart of the city,We did the 'cage of death' and it was absolutely awesome. The knowledge from all the staff and the background stories about the crocodile is excellent. A very good day!
49,1 ft from a 16 footer,"Was a great chance to view Crocs in an enclosed safe area. I did get into the, Swimming with Croc experience, although the total price, including a photo package, was hard to qualify, but in saying that, one only lives once & Im glad I did it. The rest of 4hrs was spent meandering through all the complex, which also included having  lunch at the Cafe. Plus did some Great souvenir shopping just to buy a special memento or 2."
50,Cage Of Death,My friend and I did the cage of death - was incredible to be so close to the crocodile when it was feeding
51,Wonderful experience in the heart of Darwin.,The girls doing the cage of death were fantastic they answered all my questions and made my dip in the water much better I really got close to the croc they are a credit to you
52,Cage of Death,"we had such fun at this place , make sure you  get to hold a live snapping croc and get a picture of this   and go in the morning when the cross are hungry for feeding time"
53,Brilliant,Crocosaurus Cove was great family fun lots to see.  My husband even got to swim with a Great and had a good time.
54,Great place in a very central location,"I loved Crocosauros Cove. I especially enjoyed 'The Cage of Death' experience and the reptile exhibition. I gained a new appreciation for crocodiles after seeing one up close. The staff were friendly, helpful & knowledgeable. A must do while in Darwin."
55,Great day out ,first stop when i got to darwin and loved every minute i was there. learnt alot about crocs and even got to touch a baby croc.
56,Fusion of Indian and Thai Cuisines,"I just loved the Cage of Death, incredible to be so close - the team at Crocosaurus Cove made sure we had a great time."
57,Great experience with the crocs,"The Crocosaurus Cove was so much fun. We did the Cage of Death which is not as scary as it seems and it was an unforgettable experience! We also held a baby crocodile, a snake and a lizard. There’s heaps of great shows to watch during the day and lots of cute animals. Definitely worth going."
58,A must see for all ages,We did the VIP Tour and it was just AWESOME!From getting to feed a fully grown crocodile to holding a baby one this experience was just WOWOur guide was very friendly and so knowledgeable.  Not only about the crocs but also about the other animals in the Cove.The great thing is the tours are for 8 or less which means the guides can get to know YOU over the 1 1/2hrs tour.Recommended!
59,what fun place to go to ..,Who ever thought of this idea was on the money ... but I think you need a new cylinder as this one is get’n pretty hard to see out of due to all the scratches on it otherwise it was friggen awesome ✌️😎
60,Cage of death,Safest way to get close to a croc..and survive.  Good bar good gift shop and very good staff who spins some good stories about local crocs
61,Amazing experience with all the marine life.,"Went as i had not been here before. Very good, very educational. We ended up spending over 2 hrs here. Worth the price and good value."
62,Crocos everywhere,"Croc cove has been the highlight of our holiday, very friendly staff and the cage of death is a must if you get the chance. They are an amazing animal the croc."
63,Exhilarating ,Excellent experience with the cage dive my daughter thought it was really good as well.She did wish it could be slightly longer
64,Do the VIP Tour!,Fantastic place. Been there 3 times now and each time was just as good as the last. Great for kids..
65,You have to meet Bruce the Crocodile.,"This place has crocs everywhere you turn from juveniles to 5m monsters, and the rays & reptile house were pretty cool. It was very 'relaxed' with young staff members & we kind of just did our own thing. The kids loved getting fun photos taken with the baby croc- blowing our budget to purchase them- and the other hands on experiences. Overall we enjoyed it, although the full drip-buckets under tanks was a little off-putting... I can see that a croc cove/aquarium in the centre of Darwin could be huge or with more caged crocs & animals may not be for everyone!"
66,Well worth a visit.,"I survived the Cage of Death dive and it was fantastic.  It was SO wonderful to see these amazing creatures up close and personal, they are amazing animals.  Their whole body is so strong.  I swam with William & Kate and William is just lovely, he looked me in the eye which was wonderful.  The whole centre is very interesting and all the talks they give are very informative.  It is a great place for all ages.  I would highly recommend this attraction."
67,Wow,"This was an eye-opening experience to crocodiles.  I booked my trip to Darwin to see and be educated about crocs and Crocosaurus Cove was my first stop.  I did the VIP tour followed by the Cage of Death and I was not disappointed.  Matty was my guide and he was fantastic.  His passion about the crocs and other reptiles was incredible.  At first, I was skeptical about the size of the enclosures, but the crocodile’s seemed very happy and well-kept.  They have some rescues there and of course famous Burt from Crocodile Dundee.  Kate and William were having babies which wouldn’t happen if the crocs were not treated excellent.  Truly, an amazing experience.  I was able to learn about crocs, feed a full grown 80 year old croc, feed little crocs, hold a 18 month croc and blue-tongued skink and than swim with a big croc.  It was a great day."
68,Amazing place,We went in tank with the crocs and found it very boring and a waste of good money. I think they have seen to many chicken dinners  and are sick of it all.
69,Great Experience and highly recommend ,Hubby and I visited and took part in the Big Croc Feed VIP Experience and it was fantastic. We learnt a lot from our tour guides and not only fed a Croc but head a snake and a baby crocodile. Would visit again and would recommend anyone to visit.
70,Cage of death !!! ,My daughter and son aged 21 and 18 recently went in the cage of death. Although nervous thoroughly  enjoyed it and spent the next hour telling us how awesome it was. The overall place is interesting as are the talks.
71,AMAZING IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!,"This is a great place to visit and suitable for people of all ages. I did the Cage of Death with my partner and it was an amazing experience, totally worth the price! This is the only place I've come across where you can get so close to the crocodiles. It was my favorite place from my trip to Darwin."
72,Cage of death,We had such a good time on our tour. We got to feed a big croc as well as juveniles and hold a really young one. Our boys really enjoyed everything about it. Our guide was very knowledgeable and great with the kids.
73,Great time and fantastic staff!,"Amazing an upclose experience. Extremely safe, had the chance to witness the sheer size of a 80yr+ salt water croc."
74,Cage of Death,"It was an Exciting and thrilling experience. Very safe. I spent  15 minutes indide the cage. Huge size Salt water water crocodile.My only comment , that cage got lot of scratches so photos taken was not sharp and clear. But  Once in a life time experience. Must try in Darwin"
75,Highlight of our trip,"Wow what an incredible day! The ‘Cage of Death’ was an adventure of a lifetime! The staff were friendly, helpful and informative.The crocodiles were enormous living dinosaurs! I’ll never forget my 60th birthday!"
76,First time visitors,One of the best things I have ever done.  You would never get so close and personal with crocs of all sizes.
77,Fun & enjoyable trip,This place was unreal. We paid additional $$$ to swim with the crocodiles and it was awesome. To think we were that close was amazing. Only feedback I would give is that the showers where you prepare (upstairs) are in desperate need of cleaning. It’s as though they hadn’t been done for weeks with lots of grime on walls. So bad my partner refused to use them. I hope whoever reads this from the company gets onto that as a number 1 priority. I’m not marking them down because of that. The staff were informative and friendly and engaging. Well done to all. I did this with my daughter Chanel as it was her dream to do it so.....tick - we did it! I highly recommend it. Graham and daughter Chanel (Blue Mountains)
78,Good for an outing,"Unfortunately this review is poor! I spent the money over the weekend to get in the cage of death, whilst the cage itself was amazing, up close with the crocs. The staff and service after this experience was the most longest horrible experience and ruined the thought of ever going back again! We had a group of 12 people that all paid to enter, not to mention 3 croc dives and top photo packages for the kids croc photos! We were asked to wait in total 50 mins, and then asked when we got back to collect our photos to wait a further 20 mins! We had gone and eaten in the canteen for half hour to give them time to print all our pics to be asked for another 15 min wait! Beyond poor staff time management, the place was close to empty but yet unable to provide!"
79,Great stop off in the CBD ,"We are 2 older people who ventured into a thick perspex cylinder aptly named ‘The Cage of Death’. The cage was lowered into a small freshwater chlorinated pool where the awesome 5m Leo was waiting. Initially reluctant, curiosity got the better of Leo and he was lured closer by the delightful Dana, who was tempting him with meat suspended by a pole. 23 minutes of viewing Leo underwater with goggles was a terrific experience. To be able to view such a majestic creature close up was very special indeed. The experience cost $260 for 2, which includes the adult entrance fee of $36 each. We opted for media package for $99 which included 3 printed selected prints, plus the entire video footage of the experience and 120 odd photos on a disc. Overall, a wonderful experience and not anywhere near as scary as we thought it could be. Thankyou Crocosaurus Cove!"
80,Crocs Galore,"Great experience, cage of death. staff were very knowledgeable and friendly . Would recommend to visitors."
81,Great experience,"We did the cage of death which I couldn't recommend more! We were in good hands and felt safe from start to finish, it was brilliant! We stayed for a while after looking around the rest of the cove, we even got to hold a baby Croc and some reptiles! Our visit was really insightful, we learnt so much, all the staff are so friendly and very knowledgeable. Memories to last us a life time, would definitely go back and do it all again!"
82,Junior Adventure Rangers,Yeah swimming with crocodiles was absolutely fabulous. I got up close and very personal with a 5 mtr saltwater croc... put it on the bucket list people... the let down was the hard sell on photos...really bugged us and wouldn't leave us alone..
83,A hidden gem in the city.,It’s the most incredible experience tone up close to these massive creatures and very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Highly recommend.
84,Good day entertainment,"We had a really fantastic visit to Crocosaurus Cove on Thursday 1st August.  My husband went down in the cage with crocodiles William and Kate, as was blown away with his dive. We found the whole place so interesting, and held a snake and a skink in the reptile house, had a great coffee mid morning there, and soaked up a lot of information, both by watching the crocodiles, hearing the talks and reading all the signs.  We ended up spending the whole morning there as it was so well organised, definitely value for money!"
85,Junior Rangers,had a great time swimming with a huge croc the service was hood and the people very helpful and friendly I will tell friends and family about the experience
86,Animal abuse,What a amazing & memorable experience the Cage of Death was !We had a lovely day with helpful & friendly staff & we didn't have to travel hours to get there !
87,Animal Cruelty,My friend and I are travelling through Australia and came across crocodile cove through a travel agent. We could do a cage dive with the crocodiles which sounded amazing and right up our street! The tickets were a bit pricey but well worth it! The cage dive was incredible! Able to take my own GoPro and not pay a whole lot extra for our own photos was a brilliant plus! The keepers were very kind and informative. They clearly cared about the animals they were looking after. We have a wonderful day and stretched it out as much as possible in the boiling sunshine.
88,Great Learning Opportunity ,"I have a healthy fear of crocodiles and wasn’t quite sure what made me sign up for the cage of death. However it really wasn’t scary, the water temperature was perfect and our crocodile performed for us getting us some excellent photos. So we were happy that we did it. Of course they definitely get you with the cost of the professional photos!"
89,A very informative demonstration,Was a good experience with William and Kate and then the viewing of the other Crocosaurus marine life was great. A great reptile mixture. The meal and coffee very refreshing. Thank you.
90,Hot and steamy,"My son loved the Jr Rangers, thank you very much. We have been here before and renewed our territory pass."
91,More than just crocs,"On our 5 day holiday to Darwin my partner & I had 3 very unique Crocodile experiences and this one is a definite must do. Staff were great, the experience was amazing, felt safe the entire time. I highly rate it if your after a solid Darwin holiday activity."
92,Initially sceptical,"I understood prior to the Cage of Death experience that I was paying $175 for essentially 15 minutes. But I’ve always wanted to do this experience, so I splurged on the cost. The staff were very friendly and took me through the safety briefing and answered any of my questions. The biggest issue was that the mask they gave me kept fogging up. They bragged that they were giving me a new mask, but they clearly did not treat them to prevent fogging up. I’m a scuba diver and there are many simple ways to treat new masks to take care of this issue. Plus they should have anti-fog spray to use just before you go in the water. I kept having to take off the mask and clear them. It was super annoying and a waste of my precious time in the tube!What really frustrated me was that I was paying $175 for this experience and I couldn’t see! I told the staff when I got in the tube that the mask fogged up and they essentially ignored me. Then when they called out to see how I was doing during the experience, I told them again that the mask kept fogging up. They just yelled back, “Ok!” And that was it. When I finished and expressed my disappointment, I got a halfhearted, “Sorry.”Aside from the foggy mask issue, the rest of the experience wasn’t that great either. The pictures show a croc swimming underwater in what appears to be a large enclosure. Complete marketing gimmick! The enclosure was actually quite small and the croc just swam in slow circles around for the first 10 minutes. I have an underwater camera, and I never got a picture of the croc in its entirety because it kept half its head above water. And that’s normal for a croc (which I’ve now learned), but don’t make your advertising look like this croc is going to be doing anything super exciting while you watch it! It even completely stopped moving for about three minutes and just sat there in the water. The last five minutes of the experience they have you sit on the bottom of the tube and they feed a small piece of chicken to the croc, which livens up the croc and it opens its jaws for you. That’s it. For $175. It’s completely ridiculous! And then they’ll gouge you again on the photography, but I elected to skip this because I had my own camera.Overall, I was super excited for this experience and then was quite disappointed with what I actually got. Save your money and go do croc experiences out in the wild instead."
93,Cage of death,We chose to go for the cage of death. Not cheap but worth it. It would have been an amazing experience if the goggles provided wouldn't have been such a nightmare. They kept breaking throughout the entire dive. Missing out on lots of the action specially when you have only 15 minutes under water. Recommendation: Bring your own goggles.
94,Worthwile to visit as it brings you in close contact with the croq's.,was not overwhelmed with the visit.  had all the essentials and it could have been because it was very hot
95,Croc cove,"Worth the money. A one and a half hour tour of the facilities including the opportunity to feed a big croc, hold and feed baby crocs and reptiles. Guide was informative and personable and would recommend."
96,A must do at least once!,"Fun morning out, lots to look at and learned plenty. Nice to hear the stories of how the Crocs came to be at the enclosure. Enjoying kwatching a brave young woman 'swim with the Croc'."
97,Up close and personal with reptiles,"We booked in the cage of death croc swim but were let down by the dodgy,rude,ripoff, ransom demanding photography company. The company is run independently to the croc park. We were falsely accused in front of other customers of taking photos of the images on the computer screen and when we tried to prove this wasn’t true and demanded an apology for the embarrassment caused we were told to leave. We spoke to park management who contacted the owner who is also didn’t care. They ask for you to commit to buying photos before they will come out and take any photos and afterwards the photos weren’t that great. Stay away there’s much better croc viewing around"
98,Croc feeding tour,Wow what a great experience the tours and cage of death is a must do for anyone who goes thereThe staff there are so passionate about the attractions and the animals they work with
99,Crocs up close in main st of Darwin. ,"We spent the best part of a day here; seeing the feeding shows, swimming with the baby crocs, and the cage of death. The team were friendly and knowledgeable, and worked hard to engage our 4yo and his short attention span. I do agree that it can be hard to see such magnificent animals in enclosures, but they seemed calm and relaxed. Furthermore, these seem to be the crocs that were captured due to the risk they posed to people (and therefore themselves) and could not live happily and safely in the breeding farm, so this is a far better option than the alternative. The cage of death was a phenomenal experience, and I feel fortunate to have been able to witness these animals up close. Well worth a visit."
100,Really interesting,"Great experience here! A lot of crocodiles in this park. Really awesome experience here. Other than crocodiles, there are a variety of other reptile displays. Stunning display. Highly recommended!"
101,Awesome experience,Great fun seeing Crocs in their native habitat I recommend you visit here!!  We didn’t want to visit the top end without seeing real live Crocs - you will love this park.
102,Jaw dropping,Great location in the middle basically of the CBD. Cool croc feeding show. Lots to do. Great staff. Well worth a visit.
103,Amazing swim with the crocs,"We did the VIP tour which was great for the younger kids and the Cage of Death was good for the adults, both are highly recommended."
104,Fantastic!,"You have the option of coming and going all day to interact with marine life at certain times.  EG, croc feeding, fish feeding, snake talk and handling. We have never seen snakes to be so active in their pens before...possibly as it was shedding season.   The talks were good, and feeding the crocs gives you a sense of how powerful they are... even the young ones."
105,Disappointing Ripoff ,The cage of death experience was awesome from start to finish.  We were put in with Leo who put on an amazing show with the help of the awesome trainers.  Ended up getting the USB with all the photos takes as well as 360 degree videos.  Have reviewed the photos and watched the videos a few times to relive the experience.
106,Up close ,"Overall I really enjoyed my visit here! I loved seeing the crocs and all the keepers were very knowledgeable about them. There wasn’t as much to see as I thought but it was still cool. I loved getting to hold the baby croc, although buying a photo of me with it was pretty expensive for one. You can take photos on your phone from outside the photo area I believe but being on my own I didn’t have a choice but to buy it if I wanted the pic. It turned out so cute though, and they take a ton. I would recommend this place if you love reptiles! There’s also the cage of death (I think that’s the name) you can do; I didn’t do it but I watched others and it seems neat if you wanna get up close to a croc."
107,Fantastic experience,Croc cove was amazing. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly and answered all questions (even the ridiculous ones). Seeing crocs for the first time was mind blowing and getting to hold a baby croc was special. The reptiles and fish were great to learn about. Awesome day with plenty of shade and air con
108,A great afternoon,"Right in the heart of Darwin, this is a must see. Watched people in the cage of death. Crocs weren't that active in the morning so if you plan to do this, afternoon might be best. A bit hit and miss depending on the crocs' moods. Fish and croc feeding was informative, but hard to see if there is a large crowd. A really nice reptile display and bubble windows for a closer view of crocs in their pens and pools. Held a baby croc, but photos are expensive if you want more than one."
109,Solo trip to Darwin,"my grandchildren 9 and 14 had a great day as we did the vip and junior rangers.  They learned  such a lot and their experience with holding the snakes goannas, lizards etc. as well as feeding behind scenes with Will and the girl ranger who took such great care with them,  It was delightful day!"
110,Great experience,A small attraction in Mitchell St. Amongst the bars and restaurants.  Crocosaurus is ok. Excellent signage about crocodiles and very informative.  There are 5 or so large crocs ie:over 5m. Big boys! Lots of smaller crocs and some reptiles and fish too. They offer feeding sessions where a brief talk is given.  I felt that the croc feeding was a little like teasing the crocs to perform.  Some people pay to go inside a glass cylinder and be in the water with the crocs.  Again the crocs are teased with food to perform.  I'm not sure how I feel about the place/experience actually.  Cheaper entry if you buy tix from hop on hop off bus counter or grab a flyer with 10% discount...brings it to $32.50.
111,Excellent,"Average, overpriced for what you get to see, spent less than an hour here. Felt sorry for the people doing the crocodile experience... so expensive and the staff had to lure the crocodiles to even move an inch."
112,Amazing giant crocs,This is an interesting experience. I wouldn’t say it’s the best croc experience I’ve ever had and I also didn’t realise some of the crocs bred in there are used for meat and leather. The surface tank w fish and stingrays seems too small to have them all swimming around in there together. There’s a lot of interesting information in here though all in all probably wouldn’t have gone in due to animal welfare..I’m sure they’re fine I just don’t fully agree with the amount of crocs in there with nothing to do..I’d be bored in the tanks there! If you want to see a croc up close though and learn some facts go for a look for sure 👌🏻
113,Bloody goggles! Overall good.,"Cage of Death was amazing. Staff are friendly and extremely professional. I you are visiting NT/Darwin, put this on your bucket list."
114,Knowledgeable snake handler,"Such an exhilarating experience, with a lot of laughs and as many oooooooo's. Seeing these amazing creatures up close is unforgettable"
115,Informative ,"We really enjoyed the VIP Tour and feeding the big Croc was a highlight, very happy with the tour guide who took the time with our 2 children autism, worth a visit"
116,"Excellent staff, great croc dive experience",I had a great time feeding crocodiles and handling various reptiles. My tour guide Aleisha was so knowledgeable and passionate about her job it was so great to see.
117,Well worth the money,"We had a ball here, very informative, kids had a ball (14 & 3 years) the highlight for the kids was being able to get so up close and personal with the baby croc (and hold it) Very informative! Thank you!"
118,Croc Cove and Cage of death,"We studied about the show time prior to visiting the place. Remember of any discount voucher such as groupon deal or hotel fliers with 10 percent discount. But even if you ended up paying full price it is worth to visit. The entrance isn't appealing so we waited til last day where there was no more places to visit. But we spent few hundreds of dollars in the place without any hesitation and stayed full day enjoying every minute in the place although it was absolutely sticky humid day. Most animal in the place were actively moving unlike to other zoo where you hardly can see any movement. There are shows after shows and it isn't just boring one way but interacting and experiencing reptiles such as feeding lizards some insects, touching and hugging baby crocodile, feeding a sneak (by staff) right in front if your eyes, see humungous crocodile top to bottom, lots of baby crocodiles and feeding them and much more. If you follow its timetable, you can easily stay half day or even more without realizing the time. Best of all were staff. From the ticketing til souvenirs every interacted staff were extremely kind and knowledgeable and this made my day even better. Thank you and well done."
119,Cage of DEATH,"Spent ages here, kids and parents loved it, heaps to see and do. Staff very friendly and helpful, make sure you go to presentations and get photos taken with the baby croc"
120,Amazing experience,"Went there first time after being in Darwin for about 3 years. Very unique and different experience to other croc places. Never got so close to those giants so close and observe what they are like from under water. Staff there are friendly and very helpful. They took every chance to enhance the experience and they did take some nice photos. Overall the cage is a must go if going to the place. If not interested in the cage, then jumping croc in Adelaide river night be a better choice."
121,Perfect,Such an amazing experience and great place to learn about crocs! The croc cage was amazing would recommend to anyone
122,One foot from a large croc,"We had heard much about this attraction and stopped in on a Sunday morning. $36/adult. Very enthusiastic staff and shortly after arriving, got to see fish feeding the croc feeding. Staff were knowledgeable and shared lots of information related to what they were feeding, and you could tell they have a passion for the animals they work with. Crocs, turtles, other reptiles-snakes seemed very active during our visit."
123,Highly recommend the 'Cage of Death' experience,Got to hold a baby crocodile - really soft skin - wonderful layout and selection of tropical and reptiles a fun family place
124,Great experience! ,"Al & Dana were amazing tour guides for the kids. They had the world's time to answer all their questions, shared a treasure trove of facts and information about all the animals, and was super informative and helpful. We cannot recommend this experience enough, all families visiting Darwin should do this!"
125,VIP tour and Cage of Death,"We found the personal tour fabulous!  Our guide was very knowledgeable and clearly has a passion for the animals.  Up close and personal, feeding big Burt, a great morning!!"
126,Close up croc education,"Very exciting and thrilling experience, was very nervous being lowered into the tank with two crocodiles but we felt very safe in the cage and did not feel unsafe or in harms way at any point! The sound of the crocodiles jaws snapping is like no other. Wonderful experience and would do it again!"
127,Cage of death,"After doing skydiving and bungee jumping I wanted to try another exacting experience so I have decided for the Croc Cove. The workers there are great, very friendly and they love and take care of the animals including the crocodiles. Being able to get so close to a crocodile doesn't happen very often and this sort of interaction makes you respect those big predators even more.I loved my experience, thank you Croc Cove team!"
128,Fantastic,"We had limited time and teenagers who were keen to see crocs up close. The VIP tour was brilliant - it allowed us to learn a lot about the Top End's crocs, hold a baby croc, feed juvenile salt water crocs and monster Burt and also learn more about Australia's reptiles with some python and blue tongue lizard close encounters."
129,Cage of Death!,Amazing even if you don't take kids. Plenty of crocs to see large and small. Good cafe to eat and drink. Well worth a visit and reasonably priced.
130,Fantastic,The attraction of seeing crocs in the middle of a City was somewhat exciting! The price could of been a little bit better considering the place is quite run down and staff were walking around or should I say moping around! If you are going to charge so much for an entrance fee you need to do something a bit more for your money! More experiences with the crocs that don’t come at an additional cost! Very lacklustre and the croc enclosures look very tired and old
131,Fun and not dangerous,Really good show. Many people jumping in the see through cage for you to watch the crocs being feed above or below the water. Although the crocs being feed so regularly are very docile and don’t do a hell of a lot. Big Barra on show and some monster crocs!
132,You want to see big crocs?,Really disappointed with our trip to croc cove. The print pictures and over all photo package was poor quality. We were promised over 150 photos we did not get. And print photos were really poor quality aswell seemingly faded and with flash visible. Only bought for the sake of the photos would not recommend. Also the highly stated croc jumping etc. Was not the case at all.. the crocodile we had axel  we later found was half blind and did not move very much. Whole experience can only be described and disappointing and not exhillirating as we thought it would be.
133,clean,"It was such an amazing experience and couldn’t be more impressed with the show Leo gave me, he was super active Id recommend doing it to anyone"
134,Just come and look,"Always check this out when in Darwin, guides are knowledgeable and friendly about the crocs. Getting to hold  a croc is a great experience, as is seeing them in the pools."
135,One of best experiences ever!!,Great few hours spent there. Not bad entry price. Parking close by. Animal keepers happy to have a chat. Crocs are very cool. Reptile house was good to get out of the heat for a bit.
136,Love crocs,We did the private tour and it was very well done and the guide was vey helpful and knowable even with our kids.
137,The only way to see crocs up close!,"Up close and personal with crocodiles, fish and snakes. Such a brilliant day. Such a great chance to learn about all the residents and interactive opportunity’s. Recommend for families with younger children, you can get so close under above and next to some massive crocodiles"
138,Great place to visit and interact!,"Crocs everywhere as the name would suggest, some huge ones too.  Kids got to hold and feed crocs as part of the visit, no additional cost.  Unless you buy the photos 😉 a great place in the heart of Darwin."
139,Amazing experience and friendly staff,Do it. No hesitation. It was a fantastic experience. I loved every minute of bring in the tank with William.
140,Average,"Great reptile show although all the lizards were trying to dig their way out of the glass, (poor things). The crocs were a bit lethargic due to doing the same thing each day. Love the overhead tunnel you can walk through and get up close. The death cage was booked out for that day but we found that we got close enough to them through the tunnel and would be a waste of money to do the cage."
141,Excellent service,It’s kind of like hang gliding... you’ll feel nervous before and at the beginning up until you’re in the water for about a minute then curiosity kicks in and nervousness goes. It’s safe and no where near as scary as you may think. A great experience and worth doing at least once (croc cage). As for the rest it’s very informative and a great day for people of all ages.
142,Pretty cool,"We regularly visit Crocosaurus Cove as locals and always enjoy it.  The crocs are always up to something new and an exhibit is often new and changing.  Being able to come often is great.  The wraps in the cafe upstairs are always super yum and fresh.  The crew their are very friendly and helpful.  If you can't get out to the wilds to see Crocs and other reptiles I  their natural habitats then this is an awesome option.  Take your time and walk around, and if you like grab a pass out for the day nd come back later that day if you need to do something else."
143,Being in the water with a 6m saltwater crocodile. Whats not to like?!,"Facing nature’s top predators is not new for me.  In 2009, I caged-dived with two female great white sharks off the coast of South Africa in the wild.  Meeting and seeing, Leo face-to-face was much more personable.  I felt that the male crocodile and I shared a harmonious synergy.  The staff is professional and knowledgeable.  The establishment was clean and had some of the best exhibits of reptiles that I have ever seen.  I was very impressed and this experience will remain an indelible memory for me.  I highly recommend this fantastic facility to everyone.  They also have a great gift shop and photos of your cage-of-death encounter."
144,Amazing experience,awesome .... great shows they put on ..... the feedings were super .... the tank looked a bit scary for me but did see and hear the screams from some for woman lol .. got to hold a three year old baby croc ... how soft they are .... well worth the trip
145,Wot-a-Croc,"The crocs are huge! They put on a heap of informative shows throughout the day to keep the whole family entertained. Quite a small attraction compared to other wildlife parks, but you couldn't expect anything lager in the middle of the city. We spent a great couple of hours wandering around looking at all the crocs, fish and reptiles!"
146,So brilliant,"Awesome experience being able to see crocodiles in the centre of Darwin City. The kids really enjoy the crocodile feeding and being able to hold crocodiles, lizards and snakes. They also offer free annual passes for locals!"
147,"Cool experience to ""swim"" with the croco","Great day out in the middle of town, my family thoroughly enjoyed their time here. Feeding of the fish, stingray was a hit, feeding crocs, great reptile display. Fascinating place with an onsite lunch/snack venue. Great family day out and so close and personal. In such awe of the mighty crocodiles."
148,didnt like it,"The cage of death was awesome, so was the baby croc. Adam was great and very informative about the different animals."
149,Scary but So Much Fun,This place is run down and disturbing!  Terrible enclosures and really not appealing in any way. We walked through but wished we hadn’t.  They offer a cage in the water with the crocodiles for a photo and the poor croc was taunted until he finally gave them the photo they wanted. It should be shut down!
150,Great experience swam with crocodile,"I visited this with my 26 yr old son and 10 yr old granddaughter and we all really enjoyed this attraction. You must go when the amazing staff give talks about the history of the crocs. Where they came from and how they ended up here. They have a real passion about these animals and it shows. See the feeding times and watch the animals feed, observe when a paying customer goes into the cage with these animals. All this is done with great viewing. A great souvenir shop is there on exit. A must see if going to Darwin."
151,Magnificent 760kg Leo viewing close up and personal,Did the VIP tour with Jess and had a great tour with the family Everyone enjoyed it will go back again another time
152,Crocs crocs and an old bugger,"Awesome experience and staff couldn’t have been more informative and helpful , would recommend this to anyone that wants to get up and personal with a Crocodile. We also had them take photos for us which was a nice touch ."
153,UNPROFESSIONAL RUDE STAFF,What a sensational experience. So exciting and fun. Not a moment of being scared. Well worth every bit of money. Dana was just great explaining the process. The only thing I'd change is not use my own camera when having the jump shots so I had a better photo.
154,Disappointing ,Really amazing experience with amazing staff that are full of great knowledge of the crocodiles will be back for sure
155,Awesome,All rangers there were really nice and helpful and looked like they enjoy their jobs would recommend to anyone that’s interested is a great place
156,VERY good ,"I went to Darwin for a girls trip, there was 5 of us booked in for this activity. On the day of the activity I fell ill and could not attend, my friends had arranged for me to do this two days later. My booking was for 3.30 - I called that morning to ask to change for an earlier time but was advised that it was fully booked. I waited around all day on my own while all my friends attended a party, i was told to come 30 minutes prior to my booking. when i came and gave my name i was told that there was no booking under my name. I explained what had happened about me falling ill and asked if they forgot to swap the names around or to check other times that day - there was no booking rescheduled under mine or my friends name. I was very frustrated as I had only called that morning and why was nothing said about a Male name booked in then. The girl Cassie was extremely rude, telling me that I was a horrible person, telling me that it was not her fault or any of the staff fault that it was my fault for falling sick. then she tried to tell me i might get a refund and if i dont its due to me own fault for falling ill. She continued to speak to me rudely infront of other staff, customers and then also the manager. My experience was completely ruined and I had to leave Darwin that evening and was not able to do this activity. They did not try to accommodate me in any way. The manager gave me a full refund but I am still extremely dissatisfied and would never recommend this place for the  way customers are spoken to! IF CASSIE HATES HER JOB THEN LEAVE - DONT ABUSE CUSTOMERS"
157,Excellent VIP big croc feed tour,"We drove past this location and were really surprised it was right in the centre of Darwin city.  We attended specifically to do the crocodile cage dive.  We booked a couple of days prior and paid over the phone.We arrived at the set time and were greeted by a polite lady at front counter, she then guided us to where to attend for our croc dive briefing which we did.We were given a very thorough and detailed briefing by a lovely young lady - I wish I had remembered her name.  She was clearly safety focussed and also focussed on the wellbeing of the crocs.After briefing we met with the photographers and opted in on a photography package.  This was optional.  Our family were able to also take photos below and above the water for us.We ventured to the area to enter the cage.  As they were getting it ready, another young lady gave us a detailed briefing about the croc.  They love their jobs and their crocs.My wife and I did the croc cage dive together.  It is only 15 minutes in the water, 10 below and 5 minutes on the surface.  Our experience went slightly longer.  As soon as we entered the cage (a clear thick Perspex cylinder) and started being lowered into the water, the croc became curious and started swimming over to see what was going on.  The time in the water was amazing.  Our croc wasn’t particularly active but we were very happy with what we got.  He swam around us and slapped his jaws a few times at the meat.I dearly wanted my daughter to do this but the minimum age is 15 - she missed out by 10 days. :(At the end, my wife and I were so glad we did this.  It wasn’t cheap ($170 for one, or $260 for two) and it’s not for everyone, but certainly something to remember.As well as the cage dive, there are aquariums full of sea life, feeding shows, etc.There is also opportunity to handle a baby croc and get photos which we also did.  Again, the photographer was very careful with the baby crocs and ensured they were being handled correctly.A very memorable day by my family."
158,Crocodiles,"Wow looks small from the outside but large inside, we paid to do the feeding tour, includes a guide for the day and handling of lots of reptiles and crocks. Was a real fun day worth the visit, and it's in the CBD"
159,Excellent,"Worth the visit, it's an amazing opportunity to get up close and personal with the top predator in the world"
160,Amazing!,"Cage of death was an experience not to miss!  Do not need a full day here, but worth a visit. Good fun."
161,Amazing Experience,Not an overall big place but jam packed and worth a look. They have croc feeding times and lots of other animals to see. Worth your time.
162,Unreal a must do and amazing experience ,"Great experience, definitely a must do activity. Its not as terrifying as one would think from the pictures, I was actually more facinated than anything. Also felt very safe in the tank so I wasnt nervous, though I was thinking of emergency escape paths :) The pictures came out great but just very pricey. Kinda unreasonable in my opinion but you want to capture the moment so they capitalize on it."
163,A must do,It was a great up close visit with crockadiles.Swim with them was Excellent.Parking could be better.Overall it was a good day out and would recommend it to everyone.
164,Cage of death swimming with Crocodiles ,Unfortunately was unable to go on the VIP tour due to numbers but still visited and checked out all the animals and exhibits. A lot of hands on interactions which will appeal to families and kids.
165,Well worth seeing,"Great tour, beautiful animal.  Friendly staff.   If you as enamored with wildlife as my wife and myself are, the tour is worth the price of admission"
166,Better than we thought,Crocosaurus Cove is a lovely place to visit.It’s obviously home to some rather interesting crocodiles of varying sizes.The staff gave us an interesting insight into the lives of the crocodiles. You can even feed some of the smaller crocodiles!There’s also a large selection of reptiles and small mammals within the complex.
167,Crocs in action,A hidden gem in the Darwin CBDGreat facility and very informative and friendly staff. I highly recommend one of the VIP tour options as we loved every minute of it.
168,Cage of Death,"Was given this  as a surprise Father’s Day present. Must admit I was a bit wary of the whole thing but took the view that no one had been eaten by the crocs in all the years it was open so the law of averages were on my side!!It turned out to be a fun time in the “Cage of Death”. The water was warm, the crocs performed when required (they do this day in, day out so are pretty cool about the whole thing). Once I realised I wasn’t going to be morning tea for William and Kate, I enjoyed being within a hand width of a 5metre predator - thank god for Perspex, even though it showed the scratch marks of many close encounters!!Do it if you can...it’s more fun than you realise!!!!"
169,A good place for families ,What an amazing experience! Loved getting up close with these magnificent creatures. The croc was as interested in us as we were in him - probably for different reasons involving dinner though! Thank you so much to the friendly awesome staff for making this stress free and for providing helpful tips and advice to us.
170,day with grandchildren,We went to see the crocs (as we didn't see any on a river cruise in the wet season when they stay in the water most of the time) but were most impressed by the feeding of the sting rays and the snake. The talks by the keepers were well timed so you could move from one to the next and were all very knowledgeable
171,Cage of Death,Loved it what a great place the staff were great our guide was very informative and we loved feeding the crocks. we will definately visit again.
172,The Cage of Death,"All the staff were so nice and welcoming. We got to see the crocs being fed and learnt the origins of each one. I went into the cage of death, and whilst it was terrifying, it was absolutely an incredible experience. 10/10."
173,Cage of death!,"We visited crocosauus cove to take the daughter out and get up close with some of the wildlife around darwin.She absolutely loved it and had a great time, she didn't want to leave..The fish feeding that is done had everyone watching intently as there is no sound like the boof of a big Barra.Overall we have a wonderful experience here yet again, if your in the city give it a go."
174,The cage of death is massive!,"Loved the troppo nights at Crocosaurus Cove (usually a Wednesday or Friday night from 5pm, but we accessed a bit earlier for a look around). Highly recommend the information sessions with the chance to feed small crocodiles and also get up close and personal by having a hold of a small crocodile. The staff are excellent and knowledgeable, and were very entertaining. There’s even face painting and balloons for the younger ones, and for the game ones, you can even hold a snake."
175,"Cage of death is fun, otherwise skip it","Came in the morning after finding a 20% off voucher in the local guide from the visitor information centre. We enjoyed holding the snake and blue tongue lizard, and taking a photo with the baby croc. There is both outdoor sections and air conditioned sections."
176,Great day out ,"The handlers are amazing... so brave, very knowledgeable, I really don’t know how they do it!! The demonstrations were great, and the information boards were really fascinating. Brilliant!"
177,Crocosaurus Cove Darwin NT,Unfortunately I wasn't that impressed with the place. Very limited space is given to the Crocs and reptiles. I didn't realise it was going to be such of a zoo. Not much time needed to see it. If you want to see Crocs get out of town and head to the tours.
178,Over priced,If you're visiting Darwin you simply must take a dive with the crocodiles - very worthwhile experience. Staff are knowledgeable and helpful and friendly.
179,Plenty of crocs,Such a great experience and a fantastic insight into a world most of us know so little about. WOW! The education and (almost) contact was exhilarating. Crocs big and beautiful and creatures great and small. Just one of the best attractions in Darwin that everyone must visit. Make sure you get in and up close to a crocodile to see how beautiful they truly are.
180,Cage of death!,Very Good place to visit with lots of Reptiles.  The Guy who show me the snakes was good happy to chat and answer questions.  This is a good place for kids
181,"Up close and personal, great day out.","If you enjoy watching crocodiles being kept like fish in the back of a lorry then you’ve found your paradise! Roughly 50 baby crocodiles were stored in a room about the size of a badminton court. Furthermore, the heartbreaking thing is that a select few baby crocodiles have their mouths taped up with see-through tape and are placed on the shoulders of careless tourists and then a flash is struck straight into the eyes.HORROR!!!"
182,Don’t waste your money,Excellent experience in the cage of death and staff are very friendly and knowledgeable highly recommend
183,"Seeing is believing, great croc location.","From the exterior we thought it was a bit dated, and it is but the attractions and staff were great. Staff were so passionate about their work and animals. And the personal croc feeding was great fun - and very brave."
184,Interesting Zoo,"Good chance to see these big creatures right in the city! Worth a visit if you’re in the area, and the cage of death is an experience!"
185,Not that impressed ,Fantastic experience with close up views of crocodiles. Well worth the ticket price. Highly recommended.
186,Unique Experience,"I could stay here for hours with fascinating shows such as fish feeding, croc feeds etc. staff are very friendly and informative and price is very reasonable. Crocs are incredibly fascinating creatures and you get your fill here!"
187,VIP experience,"This was a great experience which was worth the money. My daughter loved holding a baby crocodile and getting to feed one. I absolutely loved getting in the cage of death with Leo, it was a fantastic day"
188,"Small, centrally located",Family loved it. 2-4 hours hours plenty of time to spend and not get bored. I had the AMAZING experience of swimming with the crocs in the “cage of death”. To be honest I was very nervous!! I’m so glad I did it. Very safe. Very professional. Very much worth it!! Cost was $170 and photos (optional) were between $30 (for 1) and $110 for a croc USB (with 3 included large prints) with well over 100 photos taken by your own photographer. (Ps. There’s no hard sell for the photos). 6 year old got to feed a croc from a stick (free) and hold “fluffy” the 1.5 year old croc (free). There’s a mini version of the croc “cage of death” for kids where the kids can swim protected by glass from much smaller crocs. This is included too. Staff extremely helpful and friendly too. Thanks for having us.
189,Close Crocodile Encounter,"We easily filled 1/2 a day. The talks through-out the day were great, particularly the reptile feeding was fantastic!"
190,Must do,"What a great attraction in the heart of Darwin! Amazing exhibits and informative film on Darwin.Thoroughly enjoyed the croc feeding and narrative.A must see, use the Hop On Hop Off bus and get tickets with a 2 day pass"
191,Great way to kill the time ,"My son and husband had a great time swimming with the crocodiles. The staff are friendly and helpful. The park is very small and not much to see or do, needs a face lift."
192,Crocs get-away,If you are limited for time this is easy-as to get to right in the heart of Darwin. Enjoyed our day and probably a good start to your holiday in darwin
193,Super excited!!,"We arrived in January. I highly praise the cleanliness of the park, the enclosures, the staff so informative, helpful and friendly. The park bus was helpful so take advantage of that for future travelers. My hubby did the cage of death dive and loved every exhilarating minute. You can see passion in staff faces for their beloved animals.Almost three months have passed and I imagine things are very different at the park as they are all over the world. Best of luck to everyone during these times."
194,"Average and tired attraction, Bad photography.","Well worth visiting especially if you do the VIP Tour. Amazing, friendly & knowledgeable staff. The power of the crocs when you are feeding them is awesome.Well presented attraction with the animals being well looked after.Highly recommend & I will be going back on my next visit to Darwin"
195,A quieter crocodile experience,"Terrible keeping those big animals in such a small area to perform for human amusement, set them free, don’t know how you can work there."
196,Don’t Go ,An awesome way to see how the croc is so supreme in water. They are so graceful as they move in the water for their size. Got to hold several snakes for the first time & loved it. The handler made me feel at ease which obviously the snakes sensed. Great experience. So much to see.
197,Fun time had,"What a great experience up close and personal with these beautiful animals, very friendly staff!!!!!!"
198,Cage of death and other exhibits,I love this place and I'm so proud of the staff there as their service is top notch! The experience was so unique to Australia that anyone who comes to Darwin should definitely visit Crocosaurus Cove!
199,Save your money,"This was a great opportunity to get up really close to huge saltwater crocodiles as well as baby crocodiles and study them through the glass. We started off with the croc feeding and information talk before heading to feed the baby crocodiles with some meat on a ‘fishing rod’. There was also a swimming area close to the crocodiles (but separate) where you could swim all day for free to cool down. My daughter held a crocodile and had some photos taken. When we collected our photo, which cost $25.95, I noticed that the crocodile’s snout had been cut off. We let the guy know and he printed a new photo straight away and apologised that the photo had been printed so poorly. It was also possible to hold a crocodile without having photos taken and the guy was happy to answer all our questions. If you get a wrist band you are able to come and go throughout the day as you please so we returned after lunch for the fish feeding and meeting the reptiles. We got to hold a snake and blue tongue lizard. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing so many crocodiles and getting to hold and feed them was a great experience. We had a great day and were glad we went."
200,Holiday,"Crocosaurus Coven has all the exterior clues as a “tourist trap”. Exaggerated posters, flashing lights, street touts and down town location made me a bit suspicious but I did want to see some big crocs so I paid my $28 seniors day ticket price and went  in. The place is a bit down at heel and could do with a good spruce up but it has a fantastic display of big crocs ( and I mean BIG) plus younger breeding crocs and a good sized aquarium. The ranger talks, which are included in your admission were  informative, well delivered and just the right length. To get a good overview of crocodile behaviours and see some big ones, I recommend it."
201,Great interactive experience,"Our first reaction was, what an odd spot for a crocosaurus display - it's in a main street. But it works! The display is informative and there are some massive crocs you can get up close and personal with. We did the Cage of Death where we got in the tank with the crocs - it was pretty cool to be up that close to them. Highly recommend it."
202,Surprising,"Unassuming on the outside, enormous on the inside.Fabulous to see the crocodiles up close at feeding time, as well as being able to enjoy other informative talks with the animal handlers."
203,🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊,"Although I appreciate that some of these crocs would otherwise have ended up in far worse accommodation, and I’m sure they are cared for by their keepers, the treatment of the smaller crocs made me uncomfortable. The exhibit with high density smaller crocs that would ultimately end up in farms or other zoos (and I suspect the farm aspect was being downplayed here) seemed unnecessary, and this facility was actively breeding from a pair presumably to further supply juveniles for this purpose. The baby croc photos made me most uncomfortable of all. Baby crocs being offered with jaws taped shut (not sure for how long) for high-flash photograph opportunities with manhandling tourists is not in the best interest of the animals."
204,Exciting and Thrilling,"Traveling with husband, and two daughters (14 & 12 years).  Looked at the general administration charge v the VIP tour. Decided to try the VIP tour, & it  was worth every cent."
205,Do the Cage of Death,"Absolutely loved the day there. The staff were fantastic and showed so much enthusiasm, passion and love for their animals and their jobs"
206,Deceivingly large display,The first thing we noticed was that the staff here are professional and clearly care for the crocodiles (and other reptiles). We came to Darwin specifically for the cage of death experience and it did not disappoint.  The staff explained that the crocs are a little slower in the heat but Leo was magnificent regardless.  It was totally mind blowing to be able to see him and watch him move from under the water.
207,Crocosaurus rip off,"Staff were nice, but the prices to do the croc cage dive were extortionate for what you get, we paid $260 for 2 to share a cage. The crocs are generally uninterested in the cage, and to add insult to injury if you want the pictures they take for you, that will cost another $100"
208,Fun and informative,"We took our son as he wanted to go in the cage with the crocs. So as part of his Xmas gift, my husband joined him in this once in a life time experience. They both got up close to the big croc “Will” & said to each other if we ever this close out of here we’d be goners. Jakob said it was awesome & so glad he had the opportunity to do it."
209,Made me uncomfortable ,Its a nice experience to be able to get into a cage to watch the croco at close distance.If you want your pictures taken you have to be prepared to hold your breath and dive in.
210,Rex and Julie,"We were amazed to see the brave guy in the pod with the crocodile. The silicone didn't seem that strong but, I suppose it must have been safe. CC was a great experience!"
211,Great experience,"My wife and myself were eager to Come within an arms length of a beautiful Australian Crocodile.   We were lot disappointed.   We never felt unsafe, the cage was secure, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.   They lured the crocodile right next to our Cage, and we were able to see how beautiful these animals are.   It’s well worth the price of admission"
212,Wow!,"Honestly I felt sorry for the croq's but can understand why but it gives you a very good impression of these animals but would prefer them in the wild. We did the ""cage of death"" and it is worth the experience."
213,Swim with crocodiles,"The cage of death is the only way you will ever get so close to a man eater without being harmed. To eyeball a croc so closely and to see the power in them is a sight to hold onto for the rest of your life. The photo package and 360 degree video of our swim has amazed all our friends and family. The other exhibits at crocosaurus are also value for the entrance fee even if you do not enter the cage of death. It is the only place I know of where you can almost touch 5.2m crocs just on the other side of their acrylic tank walls and eye ball them without any danger or the need for 10m separation by fences. Great value for the whole family or just by yourself with many hours of wandering around or watching the demos such as fish feeding, croc feeding, reptile feeding etc etc."
214,"Visit this site for a ""Croc Experience"" in the CBD",The lady who did the demonstration was very knowledgeable and gave an interesting commentary. The closest I had ever been to a live croc. The cafe food was reasonably priced. The holding for the crocs were a little sad looking for me. The reptiles were interesting. Quirky location.
215,fantastic place to visit,Staff went out of their way to ensure the best experience was had with close ups of the crocodile underwater and feeding.
216,Great experience!,"What an amazing experience, totally appreciate the size and stealth of these crocodiles. The staff were very professional and friendly"
217,Cage of Death,"Highly recommend the Reptile Rangers experience for young children. My children aged 5 and 10 were thrilled to feed, hold and interact with a number of different animals. They absolutely loved feeding the little crocs and the big one too! A fantastic afternoon which I highly recommend as a school holiday outing."
218,Tank diving with a Crock,The croc show was well worth seeing.  These huge old beasts and the not so old ones are magnificent to see. You really learn to respect them when you see how fast they move from scratch. Being able to feed them was also a treat.
219,Omg,"Main objective was to experience the cage of death.Booking was made online seamlessly and a confirmation Email received and a reminder Email the day before.First thing they brief you on is nothing to do with a safety brief that they ask you to arrive 30 minutes earlier for, but its all about images that you can buy and its sold under the ""our expert photographer"" sales pitch. The experience is fun but you get more energy from the  jumping crocodiles on the river tour than you will ever get here. When I received the images over 80% were for the trash bin as they all had glass reflection, out of focus and just amateur shooting. Not what you expect to get when you pay as much for the photos as for the experience.The facilities are run down from the shower areas to the conditions of the scratched cage and observatory glass. There is nothing to do if you do not time your visit with the display schedule. Everything they were trying to do was to sell sell sell. Touch a baby crocodile you must pay, take a photo with a baby crocodile you must pay, use your mobile to capture your child with a baby crocodile that you paid for additionally, that to has rules and you must stand far away to take a pic. It is certainly NOT value for money unless you are going to the cage of death that no one else is offering."
220,Animal cruelty disgusting,You would never guess that a croc attraction would be in the middle of town and we drove straight past it the first time. There are several feeding shows throughout the day. Can be crowded and views might not be good.  Able to hold a baby croc and buy a photo. Well worth the visit.
221,See those Crocs up close,The place is run by children.  We arrived to find that they had given our slot to someone else without even asking their name. Once that was cleared up you get coerced into paying for photos.  It then becomes a photo shoot rather than an animal experience. The glass is so scratched you can barely see the crocodile anyway and the photos come out unclear. Then the staff are extremely rude and give attitude. Overall we spent 360 dollars and it wasn't worth it at all.
222,A Good Time,Such a highlight of our trip! The cage of death was so interactive and informative. The displays are amazing and the whole experience felt really hands on.
223,Awesome experience,"A fun way to get up and close to crocs in a safe environment. The croc feed is worth a go and i didnt have time (or the courage) to get in the tank, but it did look like a total blast. The fact that the place is in the middle of the busy party hub of Mitchell st adds a bit of a surreal aspect to it. Totally worth a visit and some great photo opps."
224,Really Cool Experience!,"We're locals, so bought the ""Territorian Pass"", which gives 12 months unlimited entry.Crocosaurus is a great place to hang out for a couple of hours exploring, or the whole day if you want to see the shows and get the most for your money.There's a lot to see, and the entry fee is in line with most tourist attractions.Watch out for parking, though. There's usually plenty of on-street parking nearby, but it's time-limited to 3 hours."
225,Tandem Tank Experience,"Great VIP guided tour of all reptiles and of course the main attraction, the Crocs, especially feeding time.Enjoyed the fish feeding too, well worth a visit."
226,Wow.,"We went here and didn’t really know what to expect, it was great staff are nice interesting shows .Has a kiosk it’s in the middle of Darwin shops."
227,VIP Tour of Crocosauras Cove,"Took my 5yo son for a visit and  had a lovely time. The staff were very informative and helpful. Will definitely go back, especially with the annual family pass."
228,The best!,"This attraction is very well run and the staff are well trained, informative and friendly. I learned a lot about crocs and other beasties. So although I’m sure the critters are well cared for I still have an aversion to animals of any genre being captivated, caged and trained for human amusement"
229,Well worth it.,"We went here solely for my son to experience the cage of death. It did not disappoint, we got some great pictures and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We had a wander about and looked at the other exhibits.  Not a bad way to spend an hour or so in the centre of Darwin."
230,Violation of Animal Rights,Good experience everything was fun really love it and really excited of the cage of death once in a life time!
231,Another off the bucket list,"We had an bloody awesome experience. We felt safe the whole time, it makes you absolutely realise why we need to be croc aware. The staff where fantastic. A definite bucklist occasion."
232,Not bad!,"Amazing experience, Highly Recommended. Great job from staff very friendly a credit to them all. Well worth the visit."
233,Don't bother,We spent a very enjoyable experience at this location.  The venue is quite small however the tour guide was very knowledgeable and engaging. All exhibits are up close. A wide variety of animals to handle and interact with.
234,Snap it up,Staff were wonderful - informative and friendly. But when you hear that massive mouth snap shut just a few inches from you it will be clear why it’s called the “Cage of Death”
235,Hangin with the crocs,"This experience was super cool and felt super safe. The staff were very professional and ran through worst case scenarios, they had a full action plan that ensured you knew what was to happen, I found this really calming. The experience was amazing and Axel put on a nice show for us. However, the cage was incredibly scratched and was hard to see out of when raised above the water. But overall I loved the experience!!"
236,Getting close up to Crocs,"The Big Croc feed VIP experience was worth it. My teen son and I loved it. We got to feed crocodiles and hold lots of reptiles. The staff are nice, helpful and knowledgeable. Recommended 😊"
237,Darwin Trip,Located in the heart of Darwin city this is a great way to see crocs up close and personal as well as learning about them + other animals through the live shows :)I always take interstate guests here and they have never complained!
238,You only live once !,"We went to Crocosaurus Cove to fill in time and were surprised by how interested we became in the different species of lizards, snakes and crocodiles. The staff were pleasant and enthusiastic about their work and we welcomed the opportunity to touch some of their charges."
239,Unexpectedly interesting,The beautiful aboriginal lady was so nice and patient to explain to us the reptiles and even her family lifestyle which was rather interesting. She was also helping us with the fishing for Crocs which we enjoyed much. Lindsey was another lady from Canada who helped with photography and the time spent chatting and feeling the 2 crocodiles was really nice....she is really a bundle of joy and enthusiasm. Thanks girls for making the visit memorable and Crocosaurus are fortunate to have you two in the team. You make us wanna come back again...great experience on my first day visit in Darwin. Cheers Ian and MichaelSingapore
240,Crockadiles,"I visited one morning as part of a breakfast work function. I’m not sure that I would’ve visited otherwise. The breakfast itself was ok but the real reason we were there was to see the crocodiles. And it was pretty cool. There were a number of tanks with crocs varing in number/size from varying viewpoints (eye level/underneath/overhead). I found one containing 30+ medium sized croc the most interesting. There was a baby croc that you could hold for photos for a period of time, but he got a bit stressed out after a while and was returned to his tank. We saw some people doing the experience where you get in the cage and go in the water with a croc but this wasn’t for me. I also understand it’s pretty expensive. There’s a gift shop too but that’s not really of interest to me. Overall I’d probably spend an hour or so there as an optimum time. Kids might enjoy hanging around for longer, I’m sure they’d be fascinated."
241,Crocosauras Cove Brilliamt,The Cage of Death was amazing. A definite must doPrices vey reasonable.Easy to findVery friendly staff
242,Awesome,"This was an excellent way of seeing Behind the Scenes at Crocosauras Cove.  Our guide, Sarah was extremely knowledgeable."
243,Great 1/2 day visit,This place is a disgrace and the fact that they have won awards is unbelievable.  Have voters for these awards actually been on site because how they market the business and the reality of what you see in person are two very different places indeed.  Blatant false advertising and a rip off!  Don’t waste your money - it’s a shocker!
244,Crocosaurus Cove,Wife very brave to be put into a crocodile cage. She had a blast time watching crocodile swimming around the cage while husband awed watching her.
245,Thank you,"There shouldn’t  be any crocs displayed in the middle of the city, held in small concrete pools, just so that tourists can be amused. If you want to see crocs, go on a cruise by the Adelaide river, and see them in their natural environment."
246,Croc review,"Great education on crocodiles and more informative than other croc tourist attractions. The extra croc cruise makes the visit worthwhile with a greater concentration of crocs than a typical adelaide river cruise. If your short on time I'd stick to here. Orher animal  attractions seem like an afterthought, but enjoyed by the kids nevertheless."
247,Cage of Death,"A bit unsure what we were going to experience but the 1.5 hour tour was informative and interesting and we had the opportunity to feed crocs, hold on to many reptiles as well as a baby croc. It was well organised and a good experience"
248,Local nasties,"Wonderful wildlife experience. Great displays of crocs, snakes and many different types of lizards. All animals kept in captivity but are all kept and looked after very well. Staff very helpful and provided wonderful advice on the history of all the animals. Def worth a visit whilst in Darwin."
249,Awesome cage dive,"Such a cool experience. You are greeted in the gift shop and taken upstairs where you have to go over some saftey procedures. After that you changed into your swim wear and off we go. You are lowered into a cylindrical plexiglass tube and hoisted into the water right next to a 6m croc. They are A LOT scarier when you're only 10 cm away. The whole experience takes only 15 min of which 10 are almost below water (water up to your chest), and the last 5 are knee high when they feed the crocodile next to you. One advice if your wear glasses (and are heavy near sighted): the swim goggles they provide will not fit over your glasses, so bring your own."
250,Amazing morning,"Big crocodiles is the main attractionBut there's other animals too Nice cafe for lunch, and good souvenir shop as well"
251,Wow A must to see,Great place to see Darwin's wildlife up close and personal. Very informative tours. Cameras are a must. Plenty to see and do.  snack bar on site. Adults $37.00 Must see while in Darwin. Good to know the crocodiles are rescued  ones
252,Very Interesting and a lot of fun,"A very good day, easy to get to in the middle of the tourist area in Mitchell St, can stay as long as you like, lots to see inasfar as crocodiles and other water creatures, fish mantras etc. The cage of death was terrific well worth the cost and getting up close to the crocodiles, totally safe. You get a lot of photos taken, plus a CD or USB, and six large prints for the price of $99, We wanted a USB instead of the CD we were told we had the full package and baby croc photos was included.We had photos taken with a baby crocodile, when we went to collect the photos and USB  it was all extra for a total of$165. A little disappointing but a very good day, just be aware of the extra cost.l"
253,Dissappointing..,"The staff, facilities, enclosures and animals were amazing we really enjoyed our time there.  However it was really expensive for the family to do the cage of death and the price of the photos at the end was disappointing.  Maybe a package deal with croc swim and photos would be better."
254,Great experience,"We took our 4 sons here at the weekend and we had so much fun. We arrived at 9am, it was  peaceful and quiet. This gave us a chance to really have a look at all the animals without having to rush on.The reptiles were very fascinating and the staff were very friendly sharing their knowledge.My wife had a go in the cage of death, again good safety brief, friendly and knowledgable staff and a fantastic experience. Price is very good with the deals on at the moment and everything set out well and easily explained.We will be back."
255,Take the tour!,"I could only recommend Crocosaurus Cove if you have never seen a croc in the wild, and you can not get out of Darwin City Centre. Admission (even on a Family Package) is expensive.Yes, there are over 200 crocs on display - but many of them are small.  The information centre does have wothwhile info on the life of a croc, and there is an opportunity (at additional cost) for kids to have a photo with a baby croc whose mouth is safely taped shut.  Onsite food is expensive and service is slow."
256,Pretty cool place,We enjoyed our time at Crocosaurus Cove. The thrill of swimming alongside a 5 metre crocodile was breathtaking. This mysterious fearsome and fascinating creature is awe inspiring. The staff were informative and kind. Our environment was safe at all times. We recommend this experience to everyone.
257,Cage of Death,"That's an amazing feeling to see those creatures in real so close.There are not only crocos but also different species of fish, reptiles, snakes. Must see!"
258,Took our Grandaughter,"Plenty of crocs to see from young to old and also very informative staff regarding crocodiles, opportunities to see feeding displays and also to swim with the crocs in a glass cage"
259,Fantastic,"We came with family of 6, various ages from 11yrs to 18yrs. All thoroughly enjoyed the visit. We bought the VIP tour and feeding experience, which was well worth it. A tour guide took us around the park and gave great insight about the crocs and the other fish and reptiles.All in the group were able to feed a huge croc, and hold a baby croc, blue-tongue lizard and a couple of snakes. A brilliant experience all round, would highly recommend this for families with teenagers and younger.We were able to come back in the evening for the annual ""egg raid"" where the rangers go in to the croc enclosure and rescue the 30-40 eggs from the nest. These eggs would otherwise be crushed or the young eaten by the parents. An excellent experience to witness, and several heart pounding moments for the staff as the big croc came up out of the water to have a go at them."
260,Cage of Death ,Crocosaurus Cove was a little disappointing. It was around $140 for 2A 3C and only took an hour to get around it. The reptile enclosures weren't as well kept as others.
261,no screaming here,"From the moment we arrived, all the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. Safety was a priority. Very mindful of the crocs welfare. The ""dive"" was amazing! Certainly up there with our great white shark dive!"
262,A holiday must do!,"This attraction is great for providing a safe environment to get up close and personal with not only crocodiles, but other creatures from the area.  Easy to get to, being located right in the centre of town.  It is very typical of many marine life attractions.  If you re game you can do the Cage of Death and get amongst the crocodiles.  Interesting to watch others do it."
263,Great adventure,The staff are megga friendly and the range of crocodile exhibits and shows could occupy a full day. There is commercial gift store onsite and also a top market crocodile leather shop next door for up market purchases.
264,Fantastic thrilling experience!,"Great facility with interesting nocturnal reptile display, outdoor surface and below water crocodile tank views and the awesome face to face cage experience providing a unique opportunity to view these amazing reptiles."
265,I’d do it again ... it was a heart raiser,"We went to the croc cove very excited to see some crocs, however we were very disappointed at the treatment of the animals.1. The fish and stingrays did not have nearly enough room to swim around2. The large crocs have a tiny pool to swim in, with no shade, and the area they are in is not very similar to their natural environment3. The baby crocs are treated EXTREMELY poorly. Their mouths are wrapped in tape while they sit ON A TABLE!?!? waiting for people to take photos with them. This made me extremely sad.The plus is the staff are knowledgeable and great presenters however people need to respect animals much more than they currently do. These creatures belong in the wild and there are many outdoor tours you can book to see them where they belong!!Very disappointed to see another case of abuse of power by the human race."
266,Great entertainment,"Went into the Crocosaurus with a gut feeling that it likely wasn't an appropriate environment for such large animals. The size of the enclosures and layout were far worse than expected. Considering that the largest crocodiles are over 5m long, they only had a few meters to walk and swim around in. Furthermore, the younger small crocodiles were jam packed into small enclosures virtually sitting on top of each other due to the limited space. A small crocodile had its jaws taped closed and used a prop for photo taking while it thrashed around.We left with a strong sense of sadness and sympathy for the abused animals. Do not make the mistake we made by attending and go see these beautiful creatures in their home in the wild."
267,Family fun,A quieter venue to experience crocodiles and reptiles. They have croc feeding shows and you can have photos with a crocodile. There are toilets available and a cafe. Souviners shop on the way out.
268,Prehistoric Creatures Rule Here,"The Cage of Death was a unique experience, and totally awesome, though a bit costly. Worth it, though.Try to catch a snake feeding, you get a lot of extra knowledge about the snakes of Australia and what to do should you get bit."
269,Great day out.,Folks a must doPark is in middle of city and for interaction and education OUTSTANDING plenty to keep u entertained both young and oldWe did cage of death and would advise all to do Staff are great.. this a must do..
270,Great fun in the centre of town!,"Very disappointing. Tired and in need of an overhaul. The Perspex is so scratched in most of the exhibits you can barely see through it. Observed someone doing the “cage of death” croc experience, listening to the “keeper” yelling at the poor croc and trying to get it closer to the Perspex tube for the entertainment of the people inside was sickening. “He’s just being stubborn” as she poked a pice of chicken in his face. No he just wasn’t interested and should have been left alone. This went on for at least ten minutes.There’s a small pool area where you can swim and apparently see the smaller crocs through the perspex. Full of leaves and again very tired looking. Couldn’t actually see the crocs clearly. The reptile exhibit is very basic, the website claims they have the “largest display of Australian reptiles in the world” 😳😳 I don’t know what they’re counting, must be all the eggs out the back 🤷‍♀️ All in all the whole place is not as presented on the website.Save your money and do a croc cruise"
271,Cage of Death,The highlight of our visit was the boat tour.   Without the boat tour it would not have been as interesting.     Our guide on the boat was very good.
272,A must do!,"We arrived at about 10am and were greeted by wonderful staff members. The pricing is tiered for general admission, guided tour, or swim with a crocodile in the Dive tank. We opted for a guided tour which allowed us to feed big Burt (who was on Crocodile Dundee) who is 80+ years old and massive!!  He ate ALL of our food too!  We were given the tour and a lot of extra information about the animals in the Nocturnal room, Crocodiles and training of the Crocodiles. We could hold a baby crocodile, got to take selfies with him and even gave him a kiss. We came back a week later and did a dive with William. The absolute best experience ever and woukd do it again in a flash!!  A day without the swim took us about 4 hours. **  If doing a general entry, get there by 9:44am so you can join in the attractions, feedings and listen to the really informative talks."
273,Cage of death,My daughter and her good friend thoroughly enjoyed this experience. They loved learning new things about some of the animals and especially loved feeding the baby crocs.Definately recommend it!
274,Fascinating place well worth a visit!,"It was worth doing in a smaller group and the VIP allowed us to see everything in detail, not rushed and questions could be answered face to face with focused attention."
275,VIP tour,"Unfortunately due to COVID-19, we were not able to go. I had purchased my tickets in advance and contacted them about a refund. With no questions or hassles, they refunded me the full amount: WOW, wish the airlines make it this simple! THANK YOU Crocosaurus Cove (and Sebatian who helped me): gotta love Australians, so friendly and kind! Hopefully when the pandemic clears, we'll be able to visit."
276,Great way to spend the morning,Cost : 31$ for adults Value for money :yes Time spent there : 2 hours Experienced feeding time of the big crocs : yes - worth it - plus the crocodile people spoke to us about each croc and gave us a demonstration of a croc bite force Swim with the croc availability ✔️Feeding the little Croc ✔️One ticket gives you all day admittance even if you leave the facility you can come back again on the same day ✔️Reptile/snake/nocturnal creature habitat ✔️Under the water tank walk through ✔️Would 100% recommend it
277,Better than expected,Definately worth a visit.  Lots of crocodiles to see as well as somes snakes and  other reptiles.  Food and drinks available and a gift shop on your way out.  Allow a couple of hojrs to have a good look.
278,CROCS IN CAGES,"Kids love it, good activities and guides that explain everything and are always happy to engage with the crowd. The food is decent there which is surprisingly refreshing for the city. They also look after the locals with a yearly pass so that works well."
279,Exciting,"Front desk person was informed, helpful and courteous. Information given to move around the site was clear. The croc displays were entertaining and informative. The handlers were experienced and gave a useful commentary. The reptile display is of a very high standard."
280,Crocs,This is a must tour if you want to no more about the crocs. This will take you about 2 hours to complete. Well priced tour. Swim or hold the crocs. Also don’t forget the reptile tour also.
281,4 Vans In A Caravan LOVED this place!,"It was fantastic, The guide was wonderful and so accommodating to young children, especially with the questions they asked.Would definitely go again"
282,Make the effort to see this place.,Bit of a disappointment really. The crocs seems to be so lifeless.  Guess well fed so don't have to move much.
283,The people made the difference ....,This spot is the best way to seeand feed the crocs during the wet season. Buy a VIP pass and get up close feeding the crocs. You can handle them as well as pythons if you like. I gave the perspex tank a miss. I dont need to actually swim with them. Right in the middle of town so easy to get too and the staff are awesome.
284,Something for everyone,"This is a great attraction in Darwin City Centre. There are activities for everyone. For the teens and adults, the Cage of Death was fantastic, it was safe and you get so close to the crocs. For family members that would rather stay dry, the VIP tour was excellent, it was a small group and lots of interaction and information about the animals. Well worth it."
285,Cage of death ,"Initially sceptical and looking to kill some time, I was pleasantly surprised by both the size and diversity of the site.More than just crocodiles, although they steal the show, feeding manta rays was an experience too."
286,Amazing cage of death was a must!,"This was amazing I went eye ball to eye ball with a predator. To get so close is what blows me away and it was a big, very big crocodile fun and cool"
287,Cheaper tickets for locals!,We weren’t sure what to expect and thought we’d be in and out in no time but that wasn’t the case. They have a few very impressive specimens on show including Burt - the crocodile from ‘Crocodile Dundee’.Enclosures aren’t very roomy or much effort made to have them look like anything from in the wild but they do give you a great view of the crocodiles from all angles. Just fascinating. And the nursery is amazing - so many baby crocodiles - an incredible experience.
288,Right in Town,"Great for kids. A little expensive so look for a discount voucher, particularly if you have a local connection. The crocodiles are bigger than you think! The reptile feeding is your best chance to get close and personal with a creature."
289,VIP experience is a brilliant way to experience crocs up close,"It was really a unique and unforgettable experience. Leo didn't want to make a move at first, so the staff was very nice to change me to William. William is energetic and very cute. Recommend for photos as well."
290,Entertaining and easy to get to,We had a spare day and decided to have a look. Being in the CBD  make it so easy to get to. Great experience and a must to show the kids.
291,Expensive Crocs in the City,There is a lot to see here which is deceiving from the outside.We managed to easily spend a couple of hours with the highlight being to hold a baby crocodile and have your photo taken by a professional photographer.We would recommend this for everyone.Crocosaurus Cove is right in the middle of the city which is a bonus.
292,Cage of death,"This is a great place to see and learn about Australian reptiles.You can hold and pet a bluetongue,snake and a croc(baby).When we were there, the picked eggs from nest, while mum and dad croc still were in the pen, very exciting!!We spent around 5 hours in the cove, very entertaining."
293,"Fantastic ""Cage of Death""","We were there between 10:30 and 1:30pm.  It was hot, very very hot and steamy under those shade structures.  The only activity that really interested us was our own feeding of the baby crocodiles.  That was something we had not participated in at other animal parks we've visited over the years."
294,Love this place!,This is a very decent diner. Our group eat here for dinner. The menu is quite extensive and would satisfy travellers from Asian. We had barrumundi which really taste as authentic as can be in our hometown. The curry is delicious and goes well with the rice. Recommended.
295,Better on the east coast,"I arrived in Darwin late and worried I wouldn't have time to make use of my all day ticket before my cage time. I didn't need to. There's basically 1 fish tank, a reptile room that, while nice, is the same as any other reptile room I've been to in Australia,  and a few tanks with crocs of all ages. I will say I didn't see any of the presentations, so I can't comment on them, but it kind of felt like it was an older park trying to stay alive. For the cage of death they tell you to get there 30 minutes early, But I just sat there for 20 minutes. The cage itself was really cool. Because of the tank you're in, I felt totally safe and just fascinated by watching the giant bull croc move around under the water. At $170 Australian for 15 minutes, I wouldn't do it again, but I'm glad I did it the once. Be prepared to spend even more though as they wont send anyone to get photos unless you agree to purchase at least 1 photo, starting at around $40. I ended up with a package because I'm a solo traveler and wouldn't have had any otherwise, but it did feel like the place just wanted your money, especially with few visitors (at least for the short time I was there). Was it worth it, totaling at around $300? I dont know. I'm glad I did it because when else am I going to have the chance to swim near a croc, but it's definitely not something I'd do a second time at that price."
296,MoreInteresting than I thought it would be,"Crocosaurus Cove in the heart of Darwin is a MUST DO for anyone travelling to Darwin. Its easy to get to in the heart of the city. The Cage of Death was worth every cent, absolutely amazing!! The staff are generous with their time and nothing is a problem for them...their friendly and always up for a chat! 10/10."
297,Up close and personal!,"We booked in for the afternoon VIP Tour and given it was a quiet day there was just the two of us on the tour so very much a personal tour. Unfortunately we did not get the name of our guide but she was excellent and very knowledgeable. You get to feed one of the big male crocs as well as some of the younger ones. You get a tour of the reptiles and can hold snakes, lizards, etc."
298,Great service and friendly staff,It was great to come so close to a large crocodile. I had wanted to see a Crocodile up close for many years so was great to finally achieve that dream.
299,Educational crocodile sanctuary ,"The price seemed a bit too expensive at first, but I was positively surprised. You get a lot of value for what you pay for. I would recommend to do the different scheduled activities, like feeding the crocodile juveniles, watch the feeding and get to hold the reptiles. The scheduled events were appropriately spaced out so you could go through the exhibitions on your own but never really have to sit and wait for the next event. Overall, very informative. I got a good understanding of the lives of crocodile. All staff was very friendly. Didn't do the cage of death, and does not really feel worth the money.  Also the price to buy photos were ridiculously high. Just the normal entrance fee is good enough."
