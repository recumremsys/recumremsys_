0,Awesome,this was the main reason i came to san fran on vaction. i didnt really know what to expect but it exceeded my expectations. i had soo much fun
1,too scared,"When I visited San Francisco, I wasn’t that keen on going to Alcatraz but figured that it was something you “had” to do while there. I was surprised at how good the audio tour was, with sound effects and good voice acting. I really felt  like I was there. If would recommend dedicating most of the day to this, take some lunch and walk around the island if the weather is good enough. Seeing San Francisco over the water is a decent view."
2,"Terrible experience, dirty and disappointing","The reason we visited San Francisco was because my girlfriend has always wanted to go to Alcatraz.The island did not disappoint. After disembarking from the boat we had a talk from a park ranger, which was informative.I recommend the film, shown in the theatre, gives a lot of information on the early history of the island.Take the complimentary audio tour, you will learn much more with it. We were fortunate to catch a talk on the bird man, given by one of the rangers, in the dining hall, which was entertaining.From leaving pier 33 to returning took 5 hours for us, but we wanted to see everything. You could easily shave an hour and a half if time is an issue. My girlfriend is thrilled to have finally been on the rock."
3,Insightful,"Alcatraz was the first thing I booked (after flights) for our whole USA trip, you def have to book months in advance otherwise you will really miss out!It was one of the highlights of my whole trip, we absolutely loved it. We went on the first trip across, i would 100% recommend doing this as you are then the first on the island and don’t have to queue to start the tour! When we came out the queue to get in and get your headphones and pack for the tour was super long! The tour itself is fab, I love that it was self guided and told by former inmates, I learnt a lot and felt that nothing was missed.I would a million percent recommend visiting, but remember to bring a jumper and don’t wear shorts (even in summer as it’s chilly!!)"
4,Somewhat Disappointing,Alcatraz is a must see when in San Fran.We went in February so it was fairly quiet but the ferry service to Alcatraz was still busy. Recommend booking in advance for the allocated timeslots to leave for the island.Great audio tour is very atmospheric with Alcatraz being so much more than just the jail.
5,Cool but not nearly as interesting with the buildings closed.,"I had been to Alcatraz about 15 years ago but my partner had never been. I was fascinated at how much the tour and the grounds have changed since my last visit. The National Park Service is doing an amazing job at maintaining and appropriately reconstructing as they can and the educational experience (audio tour and signage) just continues to get better and tell more and more of the story. There was also an extra exhibit about the native people and their struggle with the government over Alcatraz over the decades. It's hard material, but I'm so glad the history isn't being white washed. The flowers and birds were also pretty impressive in March. I would highly recommend getting out there as early in the day as you can and spending as much  time as you need."
6,Alcatraz Awe,"An absolute must if visiting San Francisco. I bought my ticket online, quick and easy. I went alone and felt totally safe and had a great time. The trip itself was very informative as there was an audio guide. The prison itself is super eerie (and I went during the day) however I would recommend as you also get great views of SF & Golden Gate Bridge"
7,Overpriced Captive,We did the Alcatraz night tour. We found the tour the be very informative and highly recommend. Vey well organised.
8,Maybe next time,This was really cool tour of the old prison.  I cant say enough positive things about the process and facilities.  Really cool history.
9,Awesome Experience ,"I had made Alcatraz Tour reservations a couple months prior to the COVID pandemic and called the booking agency in mid-April 2020 to cancel due to obvious reasons.  I was informed that Hornblower Classic Cab, the operator, would be refunding the charge, however, City Info Experts, the marketer, was not so willing and elected to instead provide a credit (good for 5 years) for the next time I use their services.  In order to use this credit, I must call the company and let them know that I have it with them and, I assume, the original confirmation from the order to verify the transaction took place.  I have a feeling they are just hoping people forget they have the credit and just pocket the processing fee as I suspect most people will not remember having it or retain documentation to prove they have it, especially if it's another 3 years before they re-book the tour.  I'm a bit taken aback and disappointed that they wouldn't offer a refund and get a sense ownership lacks compassion even during a pandemic crisis.  That being said, I definitely will try to avoid using their services going forward."
10,Interesting ,"I booked a tour for 7/22. But because of the covid situation our travel had to be cancelled. So we cancelled on their website on 6/22. Nearly a month after (7/18) we still have not our money back. We contacted by email their customer service, they are always very quick to answer to say they don't know when we wil be paid back. Bad behavior !"
11,"Fascinating, and a great excursion","Quite an interesting tour that was well presented, except they take too many people and we all had to line up outside on the way back for quite some time in the cold."
12,So interesting. ,"I booked my tickets on line months before we cruised. When the cruise ships are in there are no spaces left to purchase tickets.  It was much cheaper to purchase tickets on line than through cruise ship.  When docked at the pier you are right next store to where you catch the Alcatraz ferry/boat.  You need at least 2 hours to visit Alcatraz with good walking shoes and it is all up hill.  Just remember if your ship is late docking you may have to forfit your tickets, so make it at the last sailing if this applies.  I found Alcatraz to be very interesting if you like historcal things.  There is a gift shop when finished with interesting trinkets."
13,Absolutely worth another visit!,"Well worth the bucks! We showed up early and got out to the island on an earlier tour, no problem. Found prices to be reasonable and didn't get ripped off on any merchandise."
14,MUST SEE,We really enjoyed the tour of Alcatraz.  We got there just in time to take the escape tour which was very educational.  The audio tour of the cell block is a must do.  I just wish they would lock tourist in a cell like they used to.  Plan on being there a while there is a lot to see and learn.
15,You MUST stop by this Island when you visit the Bay,"Booked this tour in advance online (90 days before) to ensure I got the day I wanted.  It is very well attended.  Price was £31 per person which includes the boat ride, tour of the prison, audio tour & access to the whole ""Rock"".  We took 3 hours so allow a morning or afternoon.  You book onto a tour starting time but can stay all day if you want.  The prison is very informative & definitely interesting.  The walk around the garden is enjoyable (even in January) If you are a history buff or enjoy films, you will enjoy this as it is very historical.  It is managed by the National Parks Service so well worth the money as you are paying to not only pay for its keep but to keep it maintained for generations to come."
16,Can not get a refund,"I went to Alcatraz in 1993, I loved it then and loved it this time too. We opted for the night tour. You get over early enough to take daytime pictures and then its into the cell house via the showers where inmates would have entered on their arrival at the Rock. The audio tour was good and its quite an eerie place to be during the day but night time ups the anti somewhat. You must book your tickets some time in advance to ensure you get tickets. Enjoy!!"
17,Alcatraz Island ,Visited Alcatraz with my family and truly enjoyed the Island. I was actually surprised at the knowledge that was provided. We all had a great time and are glad that we got to experience it. A must do if you are in San Francisco. We were visiting family from NC and would definitely go back again. Don’t miss this if you have the chance to go.
18,Loved it! ,"Well, after watching and loving the movie, p I had to go visit and tour the island when the opportunity presented itself. Definitely worth a few hours of your time and the $40 ferry ride. Self-guided audio tour is simply great and right to the point. Maybe 45 minutes or so. But You can stay as long as you like on Alcatraz island, but the last ferry leaves at 4:30pm. Definitely check it out if you are visiting San Fran."
19,Great visit,This was a great tour.  I learned many things that I would never have known.  The tour was an audio self guided which I really liked.  The island is actually very pretty and the ferry ride out was pleasant
20,Night Tour ,"Have always wanted to visit Alcatraz and was glad I did. It’s really really busy and lots of areas not open to the public but the information is good. We picked up an audio tour at the main prison and I think this is essential for an informative visit, you can pause and re-start it again as needed. Great attraction."
21,Informative tour--can't beat the view,We did not make the trip but viewed it from two different locations in town. We spent a lot of time reading about the history of the building and people. There were several great areas from which to view & photograph Alcatraz
22,"Amazing, Unique","I would highly recommend doing the Alcatraz Tour if your in San Francisco. It was well worth it, very interesting & informative. The ferry ride over is a beautiful way to see the city from a different perspective to."
23,Great tour and go at night if you can.,"We booked in advance to ensure we got the date & time we wanted. It was really well organised from collecting the tickets at the pier to boarding the boat. There’s a little buggy to take you up the hill. It’s a 15-20 minute steep walk up so if in doubt get the buggy. There’s signs to tell you what time the buggy goes back down & they will also let you preboard the boat should you need more time.Once you’re inside the prison it’s all pretty much on the flat apart from steps to go up but I’m sure I saw a sign for a lift.Everyone we came into contact with was polite & helpful. Do not delay, book today! You won’t regret it. Oh & definitely get the audio tour."
24,amazing experience,"This is not a “fun” visit but one which is thought provoking and emotional. Sure, many of the criminals kept in these atrocious conditions were terrible but there were also some who had committed minor crimes... And most likely there were also a few innocent victims... Overall with the help of an excellent introductory guide greeting the arriving tourists, an introductory film and a free audio guide the museum provides a very good insight into life at the prison when it was still used as such. Well worth a visit."
25,Fun to be in Jail ,"We took the Alcatraz tour, booked 3 months in advance, the prison is actually boring. The view of the city from the island is excellent, though. There are better things to do."
26,Must see trip! ,This was a great day trip to Alcatraz. Very informative audio tour. The Indian occupation exhibition was really informative. The boat trip over was great.
27,A Must see,I have to admit that I wasn’t really that keen on seeing the prison but it’s such an icon of San Francisco you kind of have to see it. If your doubting going I would highly recommend you do. The prison for me was just ok but the cruise their and the island itself is so nice that to me it was worth it just for that. There’s amazing views of the city and the Golden Gate bridge and there’s lots of small paths which were all very pretty. We were very impressed by the audio book which was one of the best we’ve ever used. The one thing that would make it better is the ability to skip a section if not interested. Overall we had a great time especially with the cruise and just walking around the island.
28,"Experience ""The Rock""",Paying full price for an outside look was just not worth it.  The COVID excuse is lame. There were low numbers of people and they could have easily had the tours.
29,Interesting tour,"This was the highlight of our visit to San Francisco and we booked our tickets well in advance to ensure we weren't disappointed. This may be necessary at some times of the year, but when we visited we were able to take an earlier tour.It is a 30 minutes boat trip and although it was a misty morning it did clear and we got some fantastic pictures. We opted for a self-guided tour so we could go at our own pace, but for us the best part was the audio tour of the cell block, which is included in the admission price. It was really interesting covering many aspects of former residents and daily life. Our tickets also included two days on one the hop-on/off bus tours, and evening bus tour. Also included was a visit to Mdm Tussauds."
30,"Horrible service, Fraud Company","We spent half a day on Alcatraz, it was definitely a must do as a visitor in SF.  We went with 8:45am tour and it was the best because we were the first on the island.i recommend watching the 15-min movie at the beginning as it brings context about the island history then take the complimentary audio guide to visit the prison. Well documented and not too long or boring. We loved this visit."
31,Must see when in SF,we had to do the visit but at the last minute we preferred to cancel because we were afraid of having a problem on this island and of getting stuck there
32,Cancelled tour ,"We don't regret having visited Alcatraz and having heard the stories but unlike some tourist spots, you wouldn't want to go back a second time - but that was what the prisoners said!"
33,Cancelled tour,"Booking for the tour was fairly straightforward and the fact that only one company runs the tour makes it very easy. When we got off the boat we attended an information talk given by one of the ranger. Then we headed to watch a short film about the island. Make sure you take the free audio guide and then head to a self guided tour of the prison. There was a special exhibition in one of the buildings however we were unable to get to it. There are some great views of the San Fran city from the island. We spent just over 4 hours at the island, one can easily spend more time but allow at least 4hrs to make the most of your visit. My only comment will be regarding the terms and conditions listed in pre-booked online tickets. It asked us to arrive at the pier an hour in advance and bring an ID for everyone who was taking the cruise. However when we got there, we were told to come back 15mins or so before the boat departure time. We could have used that time elsewhere instead of waiting at the pier in the rain. Also the pier building is closed for renovations, so we had to wait outside in the open with only a few under cover areas. Our ID's were also not checked."
34,Lovely Island between the Sea,"We bought our tickets from the trusted Alcatraz cruises site and we selected the night tour option and we found it odd that it started at 3:45pm. I did research and saw that in winter months that’s the last tour. Well to my surprise we arrived THIRTY minutes prior to our time and the line was astronomically long! Surely not this many folks paid extra for the “night tour.” We were sardines on the ship and in the prison. I spoke with a few folks and they ended up paying regular admission fee to the island and we paid $60, yes $60, extra for the night tour. We were able to leave Alcatraz and then I see a group of folks start the actual night tour which started at 6:45. I bought our tickets months out and everything. I felt scammed and extremely disappointed."
35,This trip was awesome.,"We did Alcatraz as part of a bundle with a city tour beforehand.  Great place to visit , just be aware of the time you go and what time the last ferry is , as you need at least a couple of hours to get around .Get the audio headset which describes what your seeing with commentary from former guards and inmates . A definite place to go if you have the chance and time ."
36,Alcatraz visit ,"This was my first trip to San Francisco, California and I really wanted to visit Alcatraz. A friend of mine warned me to purchase the tickets 2 weeks before and she said I have to go to a official web site if I want to see it from inside.My husband and I made a decision to buy the Behind the scene tour. When we got there, we were greeted by our guide Steve, who was an amazing guide. He was a history professor at Western Washing University and his knowledge was just outstanding. Not that he just explained the history about Alcatraz, he encouraged us to ask questions and he put everything into a perspective. My husband and I really enjoyed this tour. It is two hours long, but trust me, it seems like 30 minutes!"
37,"Lovely Island, interesting tour.",To say I wasn't really that keen on going here was very true but I did enjoy the tour immensely. The history of the place is cool and the audio tour is extremely well done and a great way of making you fully understand why this island is terrific in the pure sense of the word. I would have loved to have gone at night however as that would be a trip!!!!
38,Awesome,"Great trip, we paid £100 for 2 & booked before we travelled, not sure if the Hop on Bus does a cheaper deal, so worth checking a price to but in bulk."
39,Hard Time,We had a very interesting day but we feel we made a mistake taking the 1230 ferry as we did not have enough time to see it all. Leave on an early ferry is our recommendation. A must do and see while in SF. All staff at the park were friendly and very willing to answer questions.
40,A must do in San Fran,We were on the first ferry over to the island.   Great tour and lots of information.   Very good time.  I would actually like to go back sometime.
41,"Isolated ""Rock"" In The San Fancisco Bay.",The audio tour was absolutely brilliant. So interesting and easy to follow. They really told the story and got you engrossed in what Alcatraz was like from different perspectives.
42,"City Info Experts, LLC -- 3rd Party Marketer **BEWARE**","The tour was not as wonderful as what we read on the website.Firstly, there was no social distancing on the boat and there are 150 people on the boat per trip. Some people with no common sense stood so close to you to take pictures. Some people's masks were only on the chin for the whole boat ride. What's the purpose? Why not the staff on the boat do a better job by giving people strict warnings and have better arrangement?Secondly, the tour on the island was unsatisfactory. There was no tour guide to guide you or answer any questions you may have on the island, except only one girl who works there at the entrance was available to answer the question. Because of COVID-19, a lot of places on the island were restricted and the signs like 'do not enter' is everywhere. Just walking by ourselves from here to there doesn't help understand the history or the stories on the island at all, not to mention that a lot of introduction notice boards on the island were too old to be read! The whole island, to be honest, is not in a good condition and needs to be maintained better for the tourists from all over the world to enjoy. There are flies everywhere you go. Bird poo poo is everywhere, too (I've attatched a picture)! Many buildings on the island were not in a good shape. A lot of green vegetations are growing on the wall like crazy. On the introduction page, you may read that 'tour includes a 45 minute audio presentation called 'Doing time: The Alcatraz Cell House Tour'"", but we didn't find that on the island unfortunately. We didn't expect to pay money or spend time on such a deserted place.I will not recommend any of my friends to waste energy to visit this place. I hope one day when things are back to normal, the island will be in a better shape and be more welcoming to show people such magnificant piece of history."
43,History,Booked online so not expensive. Crew were extremely helpful and on the Island the Park Rangers and staff were friendly. They cater for any visitors who have difficulty walking and provide a shuttle to the cell block. A fantastic experience with the audio commentary a real highlight. If you visit San Francisco be sure to go but book in advance it gets busy and you may not get the day you want.
44,"Worth your ""Time""; get it?","Luckily we had booked months ahead. There was a very long line to get on the ferry and we almost did not get onThe prison is a great place, lots of information, talks, exhibits, spectacular views etc. Really a great day out We spent 5 hours in all and we were talking about the trip for days afetrwardsThis is a must"
45,A Sight to be Seen,"My family and took a trip during our Spring beak and at the very beginning of the COVID-19. We were luck to be able to walk up and buy tickets 40 min before the ferry left. We were able to walk through the whole island and really experience Alcatraz. It was beautiful but eerie. To be able to see the island without people everywhere was nice. DO NOT skip the audio tour. There is so much fascinating information that you will miss otherwise. Alcatraz is a definite must see. Unfortunately we did not get to see the Golden Gate Bridge because the fog was so thick, but we did see many migrating animals that take over parts of the island."
46,Intersting,"Be warned it can be very cold, we left the pier in fisherman’s wharf for the 20 minute trip to the island temperature was 30% when we arrived at the island it was cold and once the mist lifted it was very pleasant but windy.Really good tour worth the money gets very crowded not sure that I would go again as it felt Abit eerie, in places staff were so friendly and really new there stuff."
47,Be sure to visit,"We eventually booked tickets for Alcatraz & enjoyed a fabulous experience. Tour from start to end was so well organised.  We arrived at the pier approximately 30 minutes before our tour as advised. There is plenty of outdoor seating around while you wait for your tour time to e called; also toilet facilities there.  When your tour time is called, you get in line & in a very well organised manner you get on board the ferry. On the island there is an audio tour; brilliantly done; toilet facilities & shops.  Just an extremely good tourHOWEVER; we initially booked tickets on-line through a company called ticketing@citoinfo.expert.  DO NOT USE THEM. They take your money; send you a receipt; NEVER SEND YOU TICKETS!!"
48,The Rock,"So good that I came again after 25 years but this time brought my partner with me, enjoyed the whole tour. People wer  very nice and there is a lift for the disabled and elderly"
49,Must See,"We took the trip that just included the crossing and an audio guide. The guide was informative, but at times certain places get busy so you end up losing your place (which makes it all the more interesting).Definitely a highlight of the few days we spent in the Bay area."
50,Great audio tour - very immersive. But crowdy!,I've visited Alcatraz a few times since I live in San Jose. I've been there when I was in elementary school as a field trip and I was there early this year. They have improved the tour process A LOT! The only downfall is that as time passes more and more places within Alcatraz are restricted to tourists. I do understand why they do this but it's just a bummer!. Make sure to go when you are nearby
51,impressive,"We pre-booked direct with Alcatraz cruises. Foggy on the way over so couldn't see the Golden Gate bridge, but it had cleared on the way back. Plenty of walking on the island but worth it, and the self-paced audio tour is excellent. Such an interesting place and so much history. Highly recommend this as a must do if visiting San Fran. On arrival we saw the sign said fully booked for the day and people were turning up and disappointed that they would miss out as they hadn't pre-booked. A good half a day is suggested to take your time and get around it all."
52,Awe3some time,"Not the island, but the boat that took us there had the best bananas i have ever tasted.As far as the island goes, it was very informative. I went with young kids, the island had there attention the entire time. The stories that were told were spooky all the way too sad. I belive every little mind out there should take a trip and learn about the things that were here."
53,Good Day and Visit,"We spent a half day here and easily could have stayed longer.  We were lucky enough to join the tour of the gardens, very neat to see some areas closed to general public.  Plus the tour of the cell block very interesting.  Views back at the city are awesome!"
54,Big Fun,Plenty of history with lots of walking. This is not good for anyone who has a Challenge of walking. I took my dad and he is older and has breathing issues. It was just too much.
55,Alcatraz,It was okay. There aren't that many bathrooms. I mean like 2 that's it. No food. No live tour guides. Recommend the boat tours instead  what a waste of prime real estate. Oh you better not be old or handicapped. Not friendly for that.
56,Interesting trip,"Tool the ""Alcatraz Cruise"" ferry to and from the island. Everything was super organized, the audio tour is really well done. Overall a great day trip."
57,San Francisco’s Coolest Experience,"We did not visit it but friends explained their experiences to us, we were afraid to visit this same island if there was a very well-known film shot in this prison, to do for those who are looking for thrills"
58,"San Francisco has lots of things to do, this is one of it","My family of four (two kids, 9 and 6) had a great time visiting Alcatraz Island.  Purchase tickets online ahead of time.  The boarding process was easy and the boat ride over was fun for the kids.  The self-paced tour (get the audio headsets) was informative for all ages.  Lots of pictures and the grounds are enjoyable to walk through as well."
59,Great spot for sightseeing ,"This is one of those tours that is not only interesting, but you remember it from then on.  it was chilly and a bit unpleasant at time, but worth it."
60,Must see,This is just a place where one has to visit . But the most interesting place here is the garden. It’s full of plants . The building itself is not so interesting and the tour is boring.
61,Cool experience but not worth $40/person,"While we had to wait to board the boat to Alcatraz, it wasn’t that bad. On the boat ride over, I felt it was a bit crowded but the views were amazing. Once on the island we were greeted and the stories started.   You then go inside and receive your headphones and gear. Please make sure you get one in the language. I speak only English and I’m not sure what language mine was in which totally bummed e out. I could get through the crowds to get a different head set. I was only able to read what I could find. My family was impressed with the history on the tour."
62,"We had to view from the shore as everything was cancelled, well worth the walk",This was our first visit to Alcatraz and the night tour and additional programs were amazing. So much information and the audio tour is done so well.
63,Top notch visit,This was something unique to do. The weather was absolutely perfect end of February and the crowd was not bad at all. Enjoyed the ease of boarding riding the ferry to the island and being able to enjoy the self guided experience at my own pace!
64,Crazy,I was promised 4 weeks ago a refund after our holiday in June was cancelled. After numerous emails no one from the company can even be bothered to acknowledge my query. I can honestly say it's the worst customer service I have ever experienced.
65,Interesting place to 'Pass Time',Our family really enjoyed our tour around the cell block and following the audio tour brought it all to life. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
66,Alcatraz,"We recommend booking this in advance as I hear it can get full before the date. We opted for the 10am departure so there was time to get there in the morning but also plenty of time to explore Alcatraz. Boarding the boat was simple and there was plenty of space. Once we arrived, a park ranger gave an insightful and instructive talk which, credit to him was humorous at the same time, and then everyone was free to explore. We looked around the outskirts of the island for a bit, luckily the whole island was still open as the ranger informed us that it would be partially shut in later weeks due to bird nesting. We then proceeded to the free [included] audio tour in the main prison area. This tour was long enough that you get to see everything, but short enough that you don't become bored. The commentary was excellent as well, no monotone voices or long pauses etc. We then went on exploring and also watched the short film that is available, though the room was very cold so it was hard to concentrate! We then departed on a boat of our choosing (you just rock up whenever) and were transported back safely and efficiently. This is a must do if you're visiting San Francisco."
67,Great information,"Seeing San Francisco without going there is a  terrible mistake , I know it's  expensive but the view is amazing and the different stories enthralled me ; especially the inmates who managed to escape and after the visit, I spent hours searching for information about them, did they eventually succeed in reaching the seashore or did they drown? The museum shop is full of quotes and it is really worth seeing. We went there in February , around ten and it was not crowded  and we booked one week in advance .The weather was perfect and the view is superb !"
68,The Best!,A million people visit this place a year & you can completely understand why. Even the ferry ride there & back was exciting. There’s a brilliant audio tour of the cell block which explains everything & it adds to the feeling of hopelessness inmates here must have felt. An incredible part of history plus you get the best views of the city & Golden Gate Bridge.
69,Loved this tour!,"I had an amazing time. Would recommend it as the guides know the information and enjoyed what they were doing. Going into areas like the hospital and dungeons were just incredible.  An experience I will remember for a long time, especially the door slam."
70,Had a good time,The advance purchase of your tickets was much needed and the earlier you go in the morning the better your time on the island and of your tour.
71,Fantastic Place to visit,"We deiced that as this was an opportunity unlikely to come up again we paid extra for the behind the scenes tour.  It was great.  Firsty, there are only a maximum of 30 of you.  Its an unrushed tour seeing sites and listening to stories that you dont see/hear on the 'regular' tour. You then join the regular tour to see the rest of the island.  This was definitely worth the cost."
72,Alcatraz ,Excellent tour.  We went on a rainy day but never really got that wet as 75% of the time you are covered.  Awesome job by the National Park Service on this one.  The guided audio tour was exceptional.
73,Very interesting - Make reservation early,"We took the night tour which was awesome because there was almost no one on the island. However it was summer, and it never got dark so it wasn’t creepy. This is still one of our favorite things we’ve done in the city. The history and stories of this place is captivating. Do not skip out on this place when visiting San Francisco but wear a sweater or jacket and comfortable shoes."
74,Rainy day tour,I’ve been twice and can’t recommend it highly enough. The audio tour experience is so well done and very engaging. It’s a fascinating piece of history and a one of a kind San Francisco experience. You’ll enjoy it and learn a lot!
75,Loved it,Was an amazing experience. Learnt so much about the island and it’s history. Would go back in a heart beat.
76,Definitely worth the visit,This is a well oiled tourism machine and you will be there with a lot of other visitors.Despite this I found the place very authentic and thought provoking re the experience of being in such a prison.The cruise there is nice. Well worth a visit!
77,Alchtraz tickets,"Book ahead! We did even though we visited in February and we couldn’t have gone if we hadn’t. The ferry works to a tight timetable so they throw it about a bit when it sets off, and the tides and the wind can make it a bit rough and there’s a bit of a climb from the dock up to the prison. However it’s worth the effort. The ticket includes a really good audio guide in which former guards and inmates conduct you around the prison. Very informative and entertaining. Enjoy the journey back with views of the bay including the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges."
78,Alcatraz. ,We went on a Friday morning. We were the first group on the island for the day. The park rangers were very helpful and knowledgeable. I’ve been on an Alcatraz tour a few times throughout my years and this was one of the best. I liked hearing the audio tour from the inmates or guards. It made it more ‘real’. Because of the time of year we went we were able to go in the Agave Trail. 9 months out of the year it is closed due to the birds that migrate there. I recommend this tour to everyone.
79,You dirty rat,"Guided by an Audio tour , this island is the history of San Francisco. We spent an hour and got chance to explore the history of Alcatraz."
80,Organized and historic,"We took a Hornblower cruise tour to the island. The walk to the prison is up an incline but there are vehicles that assist the less able. The prison tour stars by collecting a headset and recorder. The narration in English is superb, clear at the right pace and with directions which will never leave you confused or lost. A piece of American history unfolds before your eyes and is described so eloquently through your headphones that the end comes too soon.  We arrived early for our cruise but we’re allowed on an earlier cruise without fuss. You leave the island when you are ready. Boats left every 30 minutes. Well worth a visit. Brings to life films like the Bird Man of Alcatraz and The Rock. Kind of good too to see where Al Capone once stayed. Don’t hesitate..book it."
81,Great trip with kids,"This was the best tour. The stories that you hear, through your headphones, as you walk through are amazing and make you feel like you are part of the story. I wish that all national sites would take lessons from this group on how to give tours. They are amazing and so educational."
82,Alcatraz,"From the second we stepped off of the ferry over, our experience at this national park was incredible. The rangers are fun and helpful. Plan for a fairly steep walk up to the prison from the dock. The audio tour is included with your ticket and you need to do this 100%. The audio tour is what made this experience so incredible for us. We did the Sounds of the Slammer which is one of many exhibits/demonstrations that we could have participated in that day. All in we spent about 3 hours there but certainly could’ve spent longer had we not had time constraints. Probably the highlight of our trip."
83,Good to Visit,"Waited years to do this & it was more than worth it, Quality 👍Book early as this tour sells out fast, avoid the ticket touts near the ferry."
84,Lived up to expectations,"If your going to San Francisco this is a must. They offer head sets so you can navigate around the prison cells at your own pace.There are Rangers onsite and they tell you some history which is great and informative. Our ranger John did a mini tour and tells you some great history and about him and his wife doing a swim across the bay amazing story. We went in the day and pretty much went everywhere, we was there from 11pm till 4pm so made the most of it. If your a film fan and you have seen The Rock, escape from Alcatraz going there is great to see it all.Book in advance, we used Alcatraz cruises and booked the day ticket. I know you can book the evening tickets and you can see the hospital only on the evenings. Friends have done this but you only get about 3 hours on the island. So if you want more time then go in the day. Some great views of San Francisco bay."
85,Great day! Strongly Recommend ,"Boat journey across was pleasant and well managed. Entry onto the island allowed for everyone to know expectations clearly. It’s very beautiful in an eerie way. We went straight to watch the film, unfortunately the clarity of expectations had been missed by some who were eating loudly, there were no staff present to stop this. The film was really interesting. We then went to get the audio tour. This was brilliant, I don’t think I would have enjoyed it as much without the tour. Prices in the shop are way too high but products are good. I would only go the once, but I’m glad I’ve done it."
86,A Must See,"Bought tickets in Feb 2020 for Alcatraz. Company changed my tickets to a cruise without my consent. Called tickets after calling several times. Received refund confirmation Mar 15, 2020 with 15 business days wait. UPDATE:. 19 May 2020 and still no refund. Called several times and spent hours on the phone (on hold). There is no excuse to hold my $185 for 2 months and not have the common courtesy of contacting me.Fraudulent company. Will never recommend!"
87,Great experience ,"I highly reccomend this and it was just a short walk down the bay street.  Sea lions, views of bridges and bay.  Great time."
88,Fantastic tour,"I have lived in SF for almost 20 years now and have had countless guests visit the City; the Alcatraz tour is one activity or tour that is often overlooked. Or what happens, is that people want to do the tour last minute and frequently they are not able to get tickets. Think about going (as a couple of with a family, probably with kids over 12 years old) and plan in advance.... it does sell out."
89,Incredible ,"A bucket list stop, for me. I have always liked history and the US park service has done a wonderful job with telling Alcatraz history. From a fort, to federal penitentiary, Native American occupation and grassroots movement is all told. Best part is the cellblock, take the audio tour as told by former guards and prisoners, really fascinating."
90,Beautiful,"While I’m not quite sure what I expected, we did enjoy ourselves. Would I go again? No, it’s one of those, once you see it, you’re good. It’s VERY crowded, and you are herded along. We even visited in March, not a super busy time.Not much time to really look at things. The history is interesting."
91,Great few hours,"One of our favorites from our first trip. We did the night tour during the summer and it was amazing. We sailed into the fog and arrived on the island, and after about an hour or so the fog had dissipated leaving some amazing views of the city. Be sure to bring a heavy jacket, it’s super chilly on the island! Make sure you get your tickets far in advance to make sure you can get in. If you show up without one you can’t go on the boat."
92,Great exoerienve,A must visit while visiting San Francisco. Impressive for the history behind it but also for thr  grat views of the bay
93,"Alcatraz, seabirds, escape",When you go to San Francisco you must see Alcatraz. Not so much for the tour of the cell block but more for the history. There’s so much more to Alcatraz than the prison. The guides are excellent and provide lots of fascinating stories. Go between October and February and be treated to the agave trail before the birds take it over.
94,Really worth it,"The whole visit is extremely well organized. The ferry leaves on time, you’re greeted by a park ranger who gives you all the info you need, and the audio guide is excellent (and available in many languages).You can stay on the island until 16:30 (no matter at what time you get there)Only warning, buy your tickets in advance online! In busy seasons, it can be sold out up to 1 month in advance"
95,Really interesting ,I've though about going here for ages and I am so happy I finally made it! It is interesting and beautiful. Be sure to check it out!
96,Alcatraz Island,"It was neat to visit this unique piece of history. Learned some unexpected things from the tour pamphlets. We happened to go when the flies were in full effect and it was fairly obnoxious. One of the park attendants said the flies only tend to last for 2 weeks or so and were far worse a few days before. I recommend you check into the flies before booking if having them crawl on you by the dozens is something that could ruin your time. Will return after Covid, in non-fire, non-fly season when we can take the guided tour into the cells and hear some great historical stories."
97,Very informative and interesting history,"We took the ferry and we were there in twenty minutes maybe less.It was clear and sunny, but cold and windy.The guided tour was good and well run.Alcatraz is such an iconic place, and we all know it from books and movies.We explored the grounds which  are very well kept and visited the buildings of the prison.We heard and learned many things about the prison.In the end, we were pretty tired, especially for the weather conditions, but also bored.What we really liked was the views of the city: it was amazing and second to none from the island.Book the tour much  in advance. ."
98,"Amazing views, eerie but must see!","Wow!  Knowing the story of protests and death and more here made this trip surreal! But actually taking the audio tour - walking in the prison and feeling the chills and hearing ""sounds"" was an experience that is unforgettable. The audio tour is WORTH IT!! Hear the details = look in the cells, get the actual story as you move through the cell blocks on Broadway and more. The Black Hole is just the creepiest feeling I have ever experienced! Anyone who tours here and would take a chance on the outside to actually end up in any confinement -- you just have to ask WHY would you do that!! LOL! Bling Blinky of TEXS Shout Out: The island is beautiful - historic and haunting! A Must See!!"
99,Alcatraz,Took my wife and family for her birthday and it was great. Everyone enjoyed themselves. So much fun history and the walking tour really makes it awesome.All the staff were friendly and helpful. They really run the place like a well oiled machine.I would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting San Francisco. It was the funnest thing we did while vising the area.
100,Night Tour,"Popping over ob the boat and arriving at Alcatraz, it really feels earie; like that scene of every movie you've ever seen of Acatraz; but this time you're the prisoner.The site is extremely well-organised. The history is both fascinating and slightly disturbing. We got locked in one of the cells to get the feeling which the prisoners had. It was surreal.Thoroughly recommend the tour and this trip; look out for the seals at the harbour on the way over."
101,A bit of history ,"Alcatraz trip was fun, educational, and very interesting !  The walking tour was really well produced.   Amazed at how the prisoners lived in such a small cell.  Freezing in the winter and baking in the summer.  Not easy time.  Famous inmates was al Capone, machine gun kelly, the bird man of Alcatraz and Mickey Cohen.  I really enjoyed this trip.  Well worth the price."
102,Audio tour is fantastic!,Smooth and quick trip out from the dock to the island. It was busy but I imagine in summer it would be crazy. Good introduction by the rangers on the island followed by a short movie. The main highlight of the island is the audio tour of the prison - again bustling and busy but I imagine worse during summer months. Its a must do if you're in SF. There are also amazing views back toward SF for the photo lovers.
103,trip around the bay,"I loved the tour! The secret is to go in the morning and catch one of the ""Garden Tours"". This tour was so unexpected. Our guide told us so many detailed stories about different times in history on Alcatraz as we walked the grounds. Highly recommend this tour. Afterwards make sure to go inside and do the regular tour too! I spent 4 hours on the island and really enjoyed my experience."
104,Come and learn the history to deepen understanding USA,Always wanted to visit and wasn’t disappointed. The audio tour is fantastic. Highly recommended. One of our highlights in San Francisco
105,"So interesting, but so messy","I cannot believe that such a beautiful island was used for this purpose. I understand the concept, however it is a shame that this is how it will remain. Great experience learning about the history of the island."
106,Must see In San Fran,With the ferry ride over and back around 2:00. Covered the whole island. Audio tour was great. Pleasant surprise were all the flowers in such a desolate and ugly place.
107,A must when in San Fransisco,Fantastic visit to Alcatraz. We took the 9:30am ferry. I’d suggest getting to the dock at least 30 minutes (45 if you want a better spot in line) prior to departure. It took us about 3-4 hours total. Our time included an hour long tour with a park ranger who did a fantastic job of talking about the various film history of the island as well as all attempted and successful escapes. The audio tour is crowded but worth doing as well.
108,Californian Road Trip: Day 12,"Wonderful trip to pier 39, travelled on the cable car which was a great experience, bay was nice, the bridge was stunning, also Alcatraz."
109,Nice piece of history,"I went with my 17 year old daughter and we loved it, even though it was cold and wet. My daughter loved the plants, gardens and birds nesting. We both talked out how weather would have impacted people living here and made this a very difficult environment in winter. We noticed the colours (lots of green and pinks) in the paint work, lichen, moss, flowers and the shadows. The shadows cast wonderful stories. The bird life is so abundant and the rock is clearly an important nesting spot. Start with the audio tour, as it is really excellent. Take a moment to sit in the recreation yard and look closely at the gardens. A really surprising place."
110,Cool Tour,Its a must fi you visit SF. The tour is a little bit expensive but Worth the visit to see and realize how that prison worked and how many people worked there and of course to know everything about the prisoners
111,"Very interesting, book in advance",We missed our timed ferry annoyingly but we were quickly directed to the standby queue and were boarded on the next boat which we were grateful and relieved for. Quick boat ride across and then straight into it with an excellent audio guide. Not too busy and the route takes you on an interesting route. Gift shop has some unusual souvenirs. If you go to San Francisco... why would not go to the Rock!?
112,BEST TOUR,"The visit was a lot of fun. The parking lot across the street from the pier was not fun. $48 for all day outdoor parking. Very convenient but expensive. Ferry ride to the island is very clean and organized. The ferry had overpriced food and drinks. Not surprised. No food sold on Alcatraz. Can buy water. The self guided audio tour of the old prison ya very informative and entertaining. The whole tour, including the ferry ride to and from, is a little over three hours. Need to be able to walk uphill to get to the cell block from the pier. I believe golf cart like transportation is available to disabled and elderly.  Many good gift shops on Alcatraz."
113,Beware of Buying Tickets Off Site,"Well worth the visit to hear all about the history. The audio tour was the best way to hear all about the different areas of the prison area, it gave us a great insight into what it would have been like to be sent there. National Parks are doing a fantastic job with the upkeep of the beautiful gardens."
114,Exciting,"Great tour of Alcatraz.  The lines were manageable, the island interesting, and we had a great tour.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to know about this very interesting piece of history!"
115,Doesnt disappoint,Wow! What can I say? An amazing experience for all the family. Don’t think twice about visiting Alcatraz. Very interesting and educational day out. We were lucky enough to meet a past in mate and have a photo/ autograph. Would love to go back if I visit San Francisco again!
116,Alcatraz - behind the scene and night tour,"Was very much worth the time and money. Do the Night Tour if your schedule allows, you get more information"
117,Great attraction!,I loved every essence of Alcatraz!!! From the head phones telling the stories of the inmates to being able to go into a cell. Do not miss this!!!
118,So much history,"If we get back to SAN Francisco this is on our list as I’m sure the tour will be great, still good seeing the place from the shore worth the walk"
119,One of most unique places in the world,"The place is the one of the most unique places that I ever visited. It is a museum on the entire island by itself. I truly enjoyed the boat ride, the self guided audio tour, the walkabout, the scenery of the San Francisco Bay, the jail, the stories, the famous escape ... etc. I would say this is the must-visit of San Francisco. Pick a good sunny day and plan for at least half a day there for the great experience."
120,So very interesting!,"Alcatraz was my favorite, literally. The way how they guide you through the ex-prison is an experience. You don't have bored guide with you that tells you the same story he tells groups every day, we had audio guides that were interactive. You're able to follow everything said, and you're not rushed. Sometimes it's like being in the past, they play sounds, people screaming, shouting, a faked reality. We both had a fun time, Alcatraz is absolutely a place I can recommend when you're in San Francisco!"
121,Great for all ages,"We did the night time tour, which added to the atmosphere of an already amazing, haunting site.  The island-bound boat trip was in the late afternoon and provided a great opportunity to see the Golden Gate bridge and also to circle Alcatraz island before docking and walking up to the Prison.  The audioguide is spectacular, voiced by former warders and inmates."
122,An interesting place to visit.,"From the minute we boarded the boat and sailed across the Bay to Alcatraz Island to the minute we left the Rock , every second was amazing .The history was incredible , The tour guides were knowledgeable and engaging. We loved hearing the stories and walking around the Prison . It was surreal"
123,Memorable trip,"This was the highlight of our trip to San Francisco!  What a neat and informative piece of history.  We rode a very nice ferry to and from the island.  On the island, we participated in a walking tour with a guide, as well as a self-guided tour with an audio headset.  Both were very well done!  Interestingly, the island's history goes beyond the prison.  This is a must for any visit to San Francisco!"
124,Creepy but very interesting ,i visited in September 2019. This is a great day trip. a short crossing on the ferry around 20 mins. You also get a self guided tour on headphones and follow this around various parts of the island. After the tour you can go to exhibitions or talks. The views back to the mainland from the island are stunning. I would recommend this as a great day trip
125,Great experience,"Definitely go to Alcatraz, but I'm not sure if we'd recommend spending the money for the Behind the Scenes Tour.  Our tour guide, Erick, sympathized with the Native occupation of the island and minimized the impact of how buildings were burned down during the supposed ""peaceful"" occupation of the island.  He also spoke in depth about how many inmates were unnecessarily punished for misdemeanors, while on the other hand said the worst of the worst came to Alcatraz.  Mabel gave a far more balanced approach to her comments and admitted that there are complex issues when it came to the treatment of inmates.  The audio tour is very good as a stand alone, but the political commentary on the Behind the Scenes tour was offensive."
126,Fascinating place,"Simply amazing! The audio tour was awesome, esp. listening to former wardens and prisoners caught my heart.Recommend the night tour so u can watch the sunset. The best viewpoint is from the entrance to the courtyard 🤩Completely worth of money, highly recommended ☺️"
127,Enjoyed this experience ,It is a surreal place and a wonderful tour to take as there is nothing you can compare the visit to. The views of the bridges and city even make it more surreal! One must visit when visiting anywhere in the near vicinity. Make sure you book in advance to avoid disappointment!
128,Worth the price,The audio tour of Alcatraz was great. We were escorted through the prison with the audio monitor. Very easy to use and understand. The best audio tour I have ever had. Long walk up the hill to get to the prison. Wear comfortable shoes and be in good shape.
129,Unbelievably Amazing!,The trip was flawless! The crew on the ferry was helpful and friendly! The tour was thorough and very well conducted! I was very glad to be a part of it!
130,Exceeded expectations ,"Make sure to get your tickets to The Rock for the time you want to depart before arriving. They have an easy to use website for booking. You’ll take a short cruise directly from the pier to Alcatraz which has some nice views of the city and bridges from the bay ... as long as the fog is low. The weather was fine and didn’t notice anything that would give us caution for sea sickness. (Note: the only food for purchase and approved location for eating is on the boats. There are bathrooms on the island and the boats). The boats did not seem crowded. Once on the island, they give a real quick introduction and let you know what is open and if there are special tours available. The main exhibit is the jail at the top. It a bit of a walk up some ramps. There is a tram for those with mobility issues (think powerful golf cart towing a few more golf cart looking cars). The audio tour was really good. It walks you though the prison narrated by people who used to work there and prisoners. They talk about the conditions, areas, and breakout attempts. There’s more to do there, but make sure to do the audio tour. The largest of the souvenir shops were while exiting the main prison at the top. (Last note: don’t bring luggage or anything larger than a standard backpack). We enjoyed our time, but were hoping to see more about the time that Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery saved San Francisco from ..."
131,A memorable visit! ,I loved wandering the island and learning about the history. I just wish the tour aspect was more orderly. At times I was confused where to go and what I was listening to because I was going out of order to avoid crowds. I think it could be a bit more interactive.
132,Alcatraz self-guided audio tour & ferry ride,"A must-visit place when you come over. A different experience with an audio-tour, it feels like you were there when those events happened. You can skip the Garden Tour unless you are into composting but the Guide was funny, warm & endearing. Tip: the schedule time actually refers to the time the ferry boat leaves."
133,Great Experience ,"Exploring Alcatraz was fascinating. I debated paying the extra $ to take the cruise that docks on the island & am glad I did! The tour guide gave us a great overview when we arrived & then took us on a basic tour to get us started, after which I went to the current exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of the Indian Occupation of the island. The Indians of All Tribes occupied the abandoned island and began the Red Power movement that has continued through Standing Rock and more. The art, photos, & personal stories were powerful. Next was the traditional Alcatraz exhibits and audio tour. It's all self-paced after the tour guide's beginning tour, so I wandered around for about four hours to see everything. There were two small booklets available for $1 each about the island and escape attempts that I was happy to buy. It's easy to imagine it as an active prison, especially with the audio tour that included the voices of actual former Alcatraz guards & prisoners. The contrast of the warm community of Indians of All Nations and the harsh prison was hard to wrap my head around, but in either case, the grounds themselves were absolutely beautiful, filled with greenery and flowers of all kinds, and the views of the city skyline, the Bay Bridge, and the Golden Gate Bridge were amazing.I highly recommend visiting Alcatraz. They say the average visit is around two and a half hours, but if you don't have kids rushing you along, I'd plan to stay longer - there is just so much to absorb!"
134,Trip of a lifetime. ,"Having a last minute trip to San Francisco, I was worried Alcatraz would be booked solid. Delighted to book less than 7 days before and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Completely professional from the time you show up at Pier 33. Staff are well trained and time efficient getting boats away on schedule. Nice cruise, great views. National Park Staff were on site to greet. Audio tour was informative and harrowing. The building is freezing inside, the wind howls through the cell blocks. Seeing the shower block, dining hall, library, recreation yard and guard HQ gives you a real insight into the inmates world. There are some really sunny spots on the island. The gardens are meticulously maintained. You choose when you come back. I went on 10am boat and took 12.25pm one back. Must See in San Fran."
135,Amazing Alcatraz,"Nice views from this destination!Apart from the package being fairly expensive, especially if you had pre planned and booked online, the service charges is another 25% of the entry and ferry ride.Paid $39 per person plus another $14 for charges, should have just purchases tics at pier 33."
136,Fascinating,Everyone needs to come here on their visit to SF.  The tour by the Park Service is excellent.  The ferry trip across the Bay is gorgeous.  The history is impressive.  Be prepared for cold weather.
137,Great experience,"I usually hate audioguides, but in Alcatraz it’s like walking around listening to a great audibook while you actually walk around in the surroundings."
138,Bucket list,"Normally you don't visit prisons, but this is an exception.Abandoned prison on an island wasn't my idea of an introduction to San Francisco, but we all found it fascinating. It's great that the condition was preserved, so the atmosphere was still of a prison, still a bit creepy.Quite a bit of walking which was hard on my 50yr old knees, but we made it with no trouble.Added bonus were the views of San Francisco across the bay."
139,Excellent !  Educational !  Interesting !,This is a first class trip with a great audio commentary provided for the tour. Short trip across on the boat with stunning views if the island and the bridge. Take your time to go around this iconic place. Would definitely recommend this as a must see when your in San Francisco.
140,Great tour of an amazing historical site,"Alcatraz is not beautiful in an aesthetic way (I mean, the jailhouse, the Island is a wonder of nature), but it is in the historical sense."
141,A must-go in San Francisco,After our holiday was cancelled in March we were promised a refund and even given a specific date at the end of March. They apologised and said there was a backlog 5 weeks ago. Multiple emails later we’ve still not received any money back. Won’t book with them again if we look to go back next year.
142,Short break with Alcatraz tour,Alcatraz was very interesting!  You take the tour boats from the pier and then you can walk around on your own.  There is a recorded tour guide w/headset that guides you through the different sections of the prison and its history
143,"Amazing visit, with great views on both bridges and city",We enjoyed the in-depth audio tour of the building. Guests were directed in different orders so everybody wasn't crowded around the same area at once.
144,Historical & Interesting,"My husband and I visited Alcatraz island in the afternoon. Views from ferry are beautiful! The tour accompanied by audio is fascinating, it was interesting to hear some of the former inmates share their experience. While we were there, we also visited the exhibit featuring Native American artists sharing their experience at Alcatraz via art. Totally worth a visit!"
145,Alcatraz,Learnt alot about the history of the Island before it was a prison.  Tour involved walking to the different parts of the island.
146,Simply Outstanding ,Can not recommend this enough for anyone remotely interested in 20th century West Coast history. The boat trip from the pier is easy and if you take early or later boat ride is uncrowned most days
147,Audio tour makes it worthwhile ,"Excellent, well done experience on Alcatraz Island from the National Parks. The boat trip is what you actually pay for (the island is technically free) - and I felt it was overpriced for the length of the trip (comparing it to the similar, slightly longer ferry to Incholm Island and Abbey near me in Scotland. That is £14 at full price for an adult, about half what an Alcatraz ticket is.) Shame if the boat has been privatised as I think NPS could probably do a better, more interesting ferry at a lower price.If you are going at a quiet time of year buy your tickets on the day, at the window and you can get a “buy on get on free” deal which makes the price a bit better. We were there mid February and it was really quiet (no awful crowds!) and the weather was sunny and in the 60s f. We were able to get the half price ferry tickets, it was very quiet.The main building is well preserved (much better than Mansfield Penitentiary, where Shawshank Redemption was filmed, in Ohio). And the audio tour is one of the best I have ever been on, and I have done a lot at castles and things in the UK. It has past guards and prisoners on it and their input is very informative. They direct you around really clearly and keep you moving, slowly enough to see things, but insuring you don’t get bogged down in one place for too long. Really interesting and I can’t recommend it enough!We had someone with a double stroller / buggy for towing with us and they were able to do everything we were. The staff were really nice about helping them to the elevator and then taking them to where the start for the tour was etc. The double stroller fit everywhere too.The boat staff were friendly and helpful to the double stroller too. Food is available on the boat but it wasn’t great. It was fine though and good to eat something before you get on the island where no good is sold. There is a picnic area and if I went again I would take one and eat something there when we got there.The gardens and the view on the island are great too. Overall an interesting experience I would recommend."
148,Fun day ,"First time to visit a penitentiary of any kind. Totally taken back. It's big but so small so closing in. Must have run as a processing plant would, move A to B then to C, return repeat and the hardest part must be what looks so close and you can hear the sounds of San Francisco and know you can't be part of that life or at least not for a long time. One could hear but could not see, one could smell but could not taste. Hard time."
149,Fascinating! ,"Despite thinking this trip would be somewhat dark, it was unexpectedly positive and uplifting. The history of the Native American Indians occupying the island and the beautiful wildlife, renders it an island of ambiguity. Book ahead. Seriously. 1m visitors a year. Brilliant experience."
150,Great visit,Very impressive tour and organised well I hope history what ripped again because it’s scary how was tried
151,"Fascinating place, excellent day out - best to pre-book the ticket.",Really enjoyed my visit - excellent guide (joe) and the audio tour was great- voiced by the guards and prisoners
152,Great trip ,By far this is the best tourist activity you can do in San Francisco. Take the Behind the scenes or the Night tours as you will avoid the crowds and the experience is very unique. We were really impressed by Alcatraz and all the story behind it. Much more than a famous jailhouse
153,A must-see part of the San Francisco experience,Well worth the time.  Plan on 2 1/2 hours. Were a jacket because it’s cold inside the cells.  There is no heat and the breeze blows through it.  Loved it!!
154,Good tour,Is very nice that you learn about San Francisco and some famous characters that once lived in this prison
155,GREAT,"This was a great tour, having the past guards and prisoners in the audio really added to the experience. It is an amazing site but disappointing they have allowed its deterioration, especially when it is a tourist icon of San Francisco."
156,There’s more to Alcatraz then you think. ,My daughter and I visited Aalcatraz in January this year. Such a  beautiful spot with stunning views of San Francisco. We had thought we might be a bit underwhelmed by the tour of the actual prison but the Audio Tour was superb. Being narrated by former inmates and prison guards the Alcatraz experience was really brought to life for us. We would recommend catching the ferry in the morning so you have plenty of time to  explore the island before the final ferry leaves in the afternoon.
157,Fantastic place,"Alcatraz Island is San Francisco Bay,. You take a ferry to get to this notorious former high-security prison.. The prison has a fascinating history. As far as is known, no inmates ever escaped successfully, the water of the Bay is very cold. The jury is still out on one group  who escaped their cells and were never seen again. By the way ""alcatraz"" is Spanish for ""pelican."""
158,Totally worth it,"Great trip, interesting information loved the headset tour of the cells a must for a trip to sfo. You can see the current in the sea its a good day"
159,Spooky,Had four days (not enough) in San Francisco on route to Honolulu Alcatraz was high on things to do list and wasn’t disappointed
160,Surprisingly engaging for our young teenage daughter,"We recently took the Alcatraz self-guided tour and it was really interesting.  Seeing the actual jail cells was wild.  They are so small.  Seeing the solitary confinement was creepy.  The views from the prison were breathtaking.  I learned a lot of facts I didn't know, either.  Someone else you don't think about - the grounds (that the prisoners tended) were quite beautiful.  Something interesting to do."
161,Required Visit,"Super informative, the walk through audio tour was great! Suitable for all kinds of travellers wanting to know more about America’s history"
162,Fascinating,"We did the ""behind the scenes tour"" which included the hospital ward and ""the dungeon.""  Included was a great docent who was extremely knowledgeable and also the audio tour witch hits the cell blocks and administrative building.  Plan ahead and BOOK EARLY--Alcatraz is one of the most popular tourist sites in SFO."
163,Greyline,Make sure you book well ahead as they only take so many people a day and it is a very poppular venue.  The head phones are excellent and many different languages can be used.  The commentary by former inmates and guards really helps you appreciate the life style on the island
164,Surprisingly lots of fun,Definitely a most when visiting San Francisco. A very interesting self guided tour. Great picture points to see the City from another point.
165,Best part of San Fran.,"Wanted to visit for years and was not disappointed one bit. From the breathtaking views, to the history this place is a must visit"
166,Must visit - but only once,One of the most amazing trips I have ever been on it’s great to see and hear about all the history surrounding the rock. It has beautiful views of the bay and tells a chilling story of the people who attempted to escape.
167,Visit to Alcatraz,We are a family of 5 with 3 teens / pre-teens.  The self guided audio tour was a winner and well done.  There were also great views of the city and Golden Gate.  We booked online which was worthwhile as the tickets were sold out on the day.  When you first get to the island a ranger gave an induction.  This really didn’t add much value and I would recommend going straight to the self guided audio tour area to get ahead of the crowds
168,One of the best tours we have taken anywhere,"Such a fun tour. Audio tour was great and entertaining. Glad to experience that part of history. Wish I had time to go on the night tour, but I could barely sleep after even experiencing the day trip! Boat was spacious and the island is well kept."
169,Wonderful Experience,We had pre booked our tickets and boat time 6 weeks before our holiday and were so lucky to have a beautiful sunny February morning.We arrived at Pier 33 30 minutes before the sailing time and boarded the ferry 15 minutes before departure. The crossing takes about 10 minutes with spectacular views of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge.The island is a National Park with protected wildlife and beautiful flowers. We then walked up to the main prison building and followed the audio tour. It takes about an hour to do the tour which is a fascinating trip back into the history of this notorious prison.I can’t wait to watch the movies about the prison again when I get home!We so enjoyed our visit and speaking to an author who lived on the island as a child of a guard.I can’t recommend visiting the Island enough! A must do!
170,An enjoyable excursion to see Alcatraz.,"People said you can tour the place through YouTube but it’s really something worth seeing in person. The boat was clean, people who organized the trip are caring and friendly and I was impressed on how to audio mechanics was telling the entire story. I enjoyed it a lot and it’s highly recommended!"
171,Educational and interesting ,"Legendary prison with  interesting history. When I was kid I saw this place only in the  movies. Of course it was really interesting for me to visit it, visit but not being here, i mean not sitting there 😆😆😆. Captivating excursion."
172,Walking around in a book.,Very enjoyable visit. Extremely interesting. It takes about 3-4 hours dependant on whether you do additional talks at the end. Strongly recommended but if you do the evening tour make sure you wrap up. It’s bloody freezing.
173,Enjoyed the visit to Alcatraz,"As with everything in San Francisco there was some steep uphill walking to be done but there was a little buggy for the less able.The free audio tour was by ex inmates and wardens and very informative. We went on the 9am ferry and it was nice and quiet when we arrived, it was getting very busy when we were leaving. Gift shop was expensive. The ferry over was quick with plenty of seating and gave great views of the island and San Francisco. There are benches on the island and picnic tables under shelter and toilets where you catch the ferry at pier 33."
174,Educational,"You have to visit Alcatraz if you have a few hours to see any attraction. The history at this National park is incredible. The officers that run this park take a lot of pride and the deserve kudos for all of their work. They strive to educate people and preserve history. We learned so much on the island, everyone was so kind and friendly and you get to explore at your own pace the entire time. There is just as much to see inside the prision as there is nature to take in while walking the paths around the island. All ages can participate. Handicap accessible. The views and photography opportunities make this tour worth the cost. I would go again with friends or family who have never been here before."
175,Excellent visit to Alcatraz Island.,"We came as a family of 4 ( ages 21, 25 , 50 & 54) Originally me and my brother were only tagging along as my parents wanted to go, but we all ended up loving it and are so glad we did it! Such an interested day with amazing views. I have a condition that affects my joints and fatigue and the staff were so accommodating to me and my Family, even with my illness being invisible they took our word for it and helped us out to get to the top of the island. It was very much appreciated! Would 100% recommend, a must do!"
176,Guided tour was LONG,Recommend a visit to Alcatraz! The audio tour was interesting! Learned a lot about the prison and inmates! Learned a little about some escape attempts! I thought there was an eerie feeling while touring the prison. Great view of San Fransisco from Alcatraz!
177,History,Great way to spend an afternoon. Very interesting. Not the kind of thing you do lore than once but something you got to do!
178,Great visit,"Not being able to visit inside the cell block, or any building on the island except the restroom was disappointing - thanks to the virus.  Passengers on the ferry were limited to 150, which takes about 15-20 minutes each way.  But all you can do is walk outside the buildings which kept my visit to just over an hour, including a 5 minute stop at the gift shop.  They could have discounted the tickets or allowed smaller groups to enter the buildings for a limited time, but that was not an option.  Although it was nice to see the island, if you want to fully enjoy your tour experience and get your money's worth, consider waiting until after this virus mess is over."
179,Very interesting with great view of San Francisco,Great place to travel solo..Atmosphere amazingTour guides knowledgeable and personable The whole experience was set up with thought and care
180,Pleasantjourney intothe past,"The feeling you get when you enter brings you right back in time. The audio tour is excellent and take about 45 minutes. Ferry ride over is 15 minutes each way and tickets include both for $39.Gift shop is perfect and the view is worth it alone,"
181,Bucket list ✔️ ,"Seen the pictures on tv , read the stories, never thought in a million years I would ever visit , but I’m glad we did . It’s an amazing experience and what a place , the audio tour is a must and the history of the island is very interesting."
182,A must to do in San Francisco,"Short boat trip, excellent intro to the island and the rules. Did the audio tour and really enjoyed it."
183,Wow,Was great! Better than expected. History so interesting. Many options to learn. We enjoyed the audio tour. Easy to follow. Beautiful site of harbor. It was not crowded the day we went. Comfortable.
184,Highlight of our SF trip,"With COVID, the tours were partially closed. You were allowed to go on the island but not allowed the enter any of the building, or do the audio tour from my understanding. I can understand the reasoning, but the tour company also decided  to keep the original ticket pricing...but you're getting less than half of the original tour. We decided against it. While we didn't set foot on the island, it was still cool to see from land. Great views can be had from the piers in Fishermans Wharf!"
185,Boring!,"Do not leave San Fran without a visit to Alcatraz Island.  Dependling on what time of year, would consider pre-booking before you leave if for a family.  My two teenagers thought it was going to be, well...boring, but to their surprise they found it very interesting and really pleased I had added this to your trip."
186,Great piece of history,"A very moving and interesting trip across to the island. Ferry staff very helpful, fairly priced and overall a great trip out."
187,An EYE opener,Well worth the money and an interesting visit to the island . Does not take the 2.5 hours they claim though -we were done in 1.5 and that was with a 20 min soak in the sun outside
188,Great Experience,"I have resided about 100 miles south of this isolated ""Rock"" for pushing 70 years.  About 12 years ago, a former GF and I visited it (She wanted to).  I remember it as truly a sobering and somewhat daunting visit, as so many hardened criminals lived out the remainder of their lives there.  About ten years ago, my sister came down from Idaho for a visit, her husband wanted to visit Alcatraz,  they had even purchased tickets in advance, so again we went.  My wife and I reside 210 miles apart, with San Francisco about midway between us.  So, often, I see Alcatraz Island sitting ''out there alone in the bay,"" a lovely sight on a sunny day.   She is a lovely woman, has no desire to visit ""The Rock"", which suits me fine as twice was once too many. I'm glad I went, have now visited it twice, but have absolutely no desire to return and would much prefer spending my time at much more pleasant and enjoyable CA places, such as the ever magnificent Yosemite or even Death Valley in the spring when the cacti are in bloom.    Handsome Mel"
189,"Interesting, well done experience and audio tour, privatised ferry is overpriced for what it is.",Bought tickets onlineReally well organizedTimed tickets for boat busy but did not feel crampedAlcatraz is brilliant with headset tour which you can stop and start at anytime ( like to go out and walk the yard)After the actual tour there are other places to see like boiler room and newly opened hospital wingRecommend
190,Must see trip,"Broken Record Time but a must see in SF...history alone, the tour was worthwhile but the natural “beauty” of the island was amazing.  On the ride out, sit on the left [port] side of the ferry for great views of the city.  We observed dolphins and a lone seal as we cruised...and plenty of gulls.  A lot of walking and steps [tram ride is available for those that maybe in need of some assistance] but the audio tour was well done and the pace was appropriate.Very well done US Park Service."
191,A must see,"This was one of the highlights of my trip. Just the boat ride out to the island made the trip worth it, as it offers great views of the bridges and the city. The audio tour of the cell blocks was very informative and interesting. I really enjoyed all of the beautiful flowers on the island, as well. I wasn't traveling with small children, but all of the ones I saw seemed to be having a blast. I even overheard a young girl ask her mom when they could come back!"
192,Pretty Cool!,The National park service and the charitable historical society that support Alcatraz do such a phenomenal job of telling engaging stories about a fascinating place. I highly recommend the night tour as the views are unparalleled. My eight year old LOVED it.
193,Happy travelers,"My husband and I took the ferry over, the view of the City was spectacular. The island itself beautiful! We did the self-guided audio tour, wow! Fantastic! So much history, very well put together. And the prison itself is pretty cool"
194,Great Tour,"Boat cruise to get there took around 15-20min, water was calm.Boat clean.Food on board as usual, pricey.Better to eat before boarding.Bring a bottle of water.Tour with free audio guide, good enough.We spent around 1.5hr there, good photo ops.Kids and adults enjoyed it.Take pic of the return boat, so you know when to go.Recommended."
195,You have to see it to believe it,"Incredible to see, the audio tour was just unreal. An absolute must-see. Only a couple of toilets on the Island, block down at the docks and another up at the cellblock. You can only eat down at the dock. Lots of tours throughout the day. We had an amazing experience, would definitely recommend a trip over."
196, Been there three times and I still enjoy going ,"We were not disappointed in Alcatraz! The audio tour is very well done and timed just right.  We enjoyed strolling around taking pics and discussing what we were taking in. My daughter has wanted to vist for over 10 years, so happy we made it happen and  we were not let down."
197,"Great 3 hours, great for kids",For the Christmas Holidays we went ‘home’ to California for the first time in eight years. My oldest daughter and her husband treated me to a tour of Alcatraz Island which had been a bucket list event for me. It was a beautiful day and truly enjoyed the trip. Have read nearly every book and watched every movie about the history of the island but experiencing the ‘rock’ first hand was a lifetime experience
198,A little chilly but lots of fun,"Visitors to San Francisco need to put a visit to Alcatraz Island at the top of their list. You need to pre book this tour as it fills up months in advance. Also check to see the best place to park before you catch the ferry boat. Once you arrive at the island, it is a walking audio tour of about 2-3 hours. The views of the city are fantastic!"
199,A must see when in San Francisco,"Book a LONG time beforehand . Thistour sells outShortboatride accross the bay Spent @ 2 hrs looking at the old buildingsYou can d9 aguided tour ,but a person meets travellers from the boat and explains a few things"
200,Alcatraz,"Worth the tours, this is such a classic part of modern history and won't disappoint. tour the cell blocks and recognize the parts from movies filmed here"
201,An absolute must! ,A trip to Alcatraz is well worth a visit ! The short ferry trip of around 15 to 20 mins is simple and enough to get some great views of the San Francisco Bay Area. The visit itself is very informative and with the audio feed provides great insight to the history of both the island itself and the infamous prison. The audio guide is not just a walk through of the prison but includes details of how the prison functioned.
202,Alcatraz Island (Prison),"Been to San Francisco many times and never visited the Alcatraz. Costs $39.90 and is an absolute essential if you come here. Gives you an insight into the Penitentiary system. It is the history behind this place and how the US Army recognized this place as being of strategic importance and developed it as a military fort that is sometimes lost. Shows how strategic the US Military has been for over a century and a half. When you understand that, you recognize how the military power of the US has evolved over the last 150 years."
203,Excellent fun ,The audio tour is great as you’ll learn so much more than just walking around on your own. The whole island is really interesting and a must see whilst in San Francisco
204,More than a Rock,"Certainly a must see when visiting San Fran. You can spend as much or as little time there as you want between ferry crossings but don't miss the last one as breakfast isn't served anymore! The audio tours are excellent and you really get a feel for the place and you can move around at your own pace. The grounds are really well maintained and internally there is so much to see so make sure you have allocated enough time to visit as you wouldn't want to miss anything. There are some quite steep roads to walk up to the entrance, however there are trolley buses available for those who may struggle with the gradients.Throughout the tour there are guides who will answer any queries you may have to make your visit memorable.Don't miss it!"
205,Excellent and informative ,Have always wanted to do this and was not disappointed. Luckily got a beautiful day to do this well organised trip back in time. All cruise and national park staff were friendly and exceptionally efficient. Trip cost $80 for 2 with alcatrazcruises.com and was well worth it. The island is steeped in history and this is well described by the introduction of the park ranger. The audio tour is excellently put together and narrated and also ensures a congestion free tour of the cell blocks. Sore on the island is interesting and in no way a rip off as you sometimes encounter. Can not reccomend highly enough.
206,Very interesting,"Have visited a few times before years ago. Same great tour. This time brought kids, was worried pre-teen would be bored and 8 year old wouldn't be interested. Both were following the guided audio tour, asking questions, and holding me back to keep us in synch. A great time."
207,Not just a tourist trap ,What a blast. We went to Alcatraz Island for our son’s 13th birthday. We had a great time. The weather was spectacular so the boat ride was very smooth. We appreciate the history of the Island and the walking tour was educational. We did the night tour which was very interesting and believe it’s a different “vibe” at night. I was very cool to hear all the different story’s of the prisoners that lived on the island. What was surprising as I didn’t know there were families that lived on the island during the time it was open. We would differently recommend the tour and would attend it again. Enjoy some of the beautiful pictures we took.
208,Scenic Chilly Prison Tour,"Lovely tour, very sad but also educational. Really easy to find bathrooms and roam around on your own."
209,Excellent tour and a Must-Do for San Francisco... often overlooked and a last minute add,What a ride! Just amazing yo be a witness of history. Book well in advance and don’t miss it. Think that a cloudy or misty day works better for the visit...
210,Bit of history,"A short ferry ride in the thick fog, which cleared as we spent a fascinating 3 hours seeing and exploring this historic site.  The guides and staff were all friendly and helpful and we left with vivid memories and some wonderful views of the Bay and San Francisco itself."
211,JUST AMAZING ITS A MUST VISIT ,"This is quite a unique place to visit. It can be difficult to get a ticket, so you have to book weeks well in advance. I would recommend booking via the official website as opposed to tours. It's the cheapest and most straight forward option. You take a ferry to and from the island which is very pleasant and provides nice photo ops. Once on the island, you are given a briefing about the different things you can see on the island, which include the prison of course and some nice nature. In the prison you can get an audio guide which is very interesting. There are also special demonstrations at certain times. Look out for the schedule when you land on the island. My favorite was the demonstration of how the cell doors are controlled. All in all a very interesting place."
212,Good to visit to learn about history,"Really informative yet interesting guided tour, which flowed nicely. Well preserved (of what was accessible) and never knew about Alcatraz Indian history, so the exhibit was fascinating. Super friendly and helpful staff in the main gift shop too after the tour and they must be exhausted as its rightly very busy.Can't imagine someone spending a few days in San Francisco without visiting."
213,Life on the island,Tours are well organized with automated headphone tours. Much time is allotted to tour the grounds and wasn’t overcrowded. The ride across was fast and concessions were great. Learned a lot we didn’t know about Alcatraz. I definitely recommend it as a must see tour while in the area.
214,No 1 Attraction,"Alcatraz was incredible and 100% worth the price, definite must see trip when you're in San Francisco. We spent a couple of hours on Alcatraz before getting the boat back which runs regularly throughout the day. Overall, an amazing experience."
215,A Favorite Tourist Attraction,"What a terrific place to visit.  The stories are amazing and the guides were wonderful.  A really great day, but book well in advance."
216,Must see!!!,Really great boat ride over to the island where we were able to view the prison up closer and personal.  Highly recommend as it had a lot of cool history.
217,Alcatraz,"If you can, do the night tour and try to get to some of the talks after the tour ends.We can't recommend this attraction enough and like all American attractions, they do it well.  If you can get to be alone in one of the wings, you will feel a little more history and it makes you think.We had been looking forward to this for years and it still exceeded all expectations.Thank you."
218,Definitely worth a visit!,"Very interesting history about the prison and its prisoners, but also learned a lot about early American military history as well as the American indigenous rights movement and its occupation of the island in the 1970s. Take advantage of the free audio tour in the cell blocks. You can do it all in about 3 hours. Make sure you book direct and ahead of time with Alcatraz Tours (the official operator for National Park Service) and avoid the crazy mark-ups by other tour companies."
219,Gangster island,We absolutely recommend going to Alcatraz to see and listen to the history of the place.  Worth the ferry ride out there and back.  Pricing was good too.
220,"FUN! Historical, Worth the Trip!","As much fun it was to visit Alcatraz we were left wanting more.  It would have been nice to be able to see the other half of this beautiful island (it made me want to stay if it were a resort which it very well could be) beautiful grounds, beautiful views. We were only able to see San Francisco bay side."
221,A must see when in San Francisco,Best sight to see in San Francisco. Great way to spend a half day when in the Bay area. Audio tour in great. The views from Alcatraz is worth the trip.
222,The BEST!!!,Excellent experience. Did audio tour and was fantastic.Very well done by National Parks. Very efficient ferry service.
223,Night tour was stunning! ,"I enjoyed very well to travel  this place, everyone get fulfill trip with great experience  with family members.."
224,Amazing!,"Great ferry ride over to Alcatraz and a good commentary throught the walk of cells, excersie yard etc.Worth the trip and easy to book before you visit San Francisco to avoid the queues."
225,Awesome Tour,A great day trip.  So interesting.  The ferry ride was fun.  And then the tour of the island was great.  Everyone should do this when they visit San Francisco.
226,Learning more about the history of the island. ,"My opinion is, if you even have just a glimmer of wonder or questions about this place ... you MUST go.  You will not be disappointed !My advice again is get your tickets as early as you can, even before you get there. Book the Ferry Ride there ASAP, right after the plane ticket! We were shocked when we arrived at the Ferry Terminal and the day was sold out !  We were so lucky a kind gentleman from a tour operated had 2 tickets his group did not use, he sold us them at face value.... and we were on the next Ferry over. Alcatraz will captivate you. The walking tour is 5 star, shows you absolutely everything you wanted to see. You even find out how “they” escaped.  You see it!Seems unreal."
227,Excellent tour,The audio tour was fascinating! The weather was perfect for exploring the grounds! Highly recommend!
228,Excellent. Don’t miss. ,"We loved our trip to Alcatraz. Not only a really interesting tour of the prison, but a beautiful island with breathtaking views of the city and also of Golden Gate Bridge. Worth the money and a lovely day out."
229,The best of San Francisco,"Go find out more about It. Start from pier 33, you may get you ticket for alcatraz cruise. Depart almost every half and hour and include evening tour too."
230,A must see in San Francsico,Great tour to Alcatraz. Encourage to visit! Actual inmates and Guards talk on Audio Tour. Very moving and informative. Worth the time and trip to island.
231,Night tour,Tour guides are brilliant and very helpfulAudio tour is fantastic and tells you about everything you can imagine
232,So interesting. ,Wether you are intressted in history or Movies you gonna get a great day. If the sun shines you can get a terrific sight of the famous bridge
233,Alcatraz,Book way ahead    this is a must see to do in San Francisco has  a free self tour headphones   boat trip was good
234,Very interesting well worth it .  Especially enjoyed commentary from former inmates and guards,A lovely short boat ride and arrive at the island. Greeted by guides who explained a little of the islands history very informative. Took the tram up to the prison musuem which was very handy. Walking through the prison we utilised then audio guide which really made you think about how life was like on there. A must see.
235,Great visit,I had no idea how beautiful this island is!  The gardens are gorgeous with so many blooming flowers even at the beginning of March.  It’s also a bird sanctuary. The 45-minute audio tour of the prison was fascinating and was narrated by 4 previous prisoners & 4 guards.  We spent a long time there taking it all in.  The scenery on the ferry ride of the Golden Gate Bridge and the island were fabulous too!  Highly recommend this tour!!
236,Whole reason for our trip!,Book an early time as there’s so much to see. There are daily tours that run once you arrive on the island. The Rangers are friendly & knowledgeable. As well as the tour around Alcatraz prison & island there is an informative exhibition on the Indian occupation of Alcatraz in 1963. Do not miss.
237,interesting and worth a visit,"Absolutely fantastic must see tour of Alcatraz the famous prison now a famous tourist attraction for all tourists on Alcatraz Island.  Me and my friend Robin Daldry caught the ferry from Pier 33 over to Alcatraz then once we got on the island off the ferry we were amazed by looking at what there was on the island.  We did the audio tour inside Alcatraz which is the best part of the tour and it's definitely must do where you see the prison cells that the likes of mob boss Scarface Al Capone once lived in while serving time in prison which made you go wow people actually  lived in these cells all those years ago.  There is more to Alcatraz than just the prison there are other things to explore on the island like other buildings and you can learn the history about people who lived and were brought up on the island and the American Indians that once lived on the island as well which I didn't know about before so it was really good to know all that while there.  So I would definitely recommend Alcatraz to everybody to do when they go to San Francisco, California."
238,Interesting place,"The island inspires you. You cannot stop listening about the history of the island, while being navigated by gadget provided at the entrance. However, interruptions of my Alcatraz journey  by other visitors a bid disappointed me."
239,A Must-Do,"My wife and I enjoyed our excursion to Alcatraz. The self-guided audio tour is informative and effectively paced. It was enlightening to better understand how long the prison actually operated, what the cells looked like and what being there looked like from the prisoners viewpoint and the guards viewpoint (various previous inmates and guards are narrators on the audio tour).  What we did not appreciate previously is that many of the guards and their families lived on Alcatraz so there was quite the community there."
240,This is a must stop when you are in the Bay area.,Great tour extremely well organised and professional very interesting tour and site I would had highly recommended booking in advance as whilst it was winter and a weekday it was fully booked
241,Family trip,"Great  place to visit and very interesting, be prepared for a lot of walking. But well worth the extra exercise"
242,A deep dive into Alcatraz history,Just go to Alcatraz don’t need cruise under bridge in winter too cold and rainy. Don’t pay more then $50 pp Approximately 3 hrs which is enough time. Do an evening time...even 330 because it gets dark by 430 in January month. Gives you that erie feeling 😱
243,Great time. Very educational ,Honestly it is quite scary for me to think being locked up there and surrounded by chilly waters infested with sharks. Wow
244,Father son,This half day journey is really interesting and knowledgeable experiences. You will get audio tours after the passionate speakers on the way walking up till you get into the prison. our travelers enjoyed this trip. And when we got there there were not as many travelers as usual due to lots of Chinese travelers can not enter USA from Feb.2 onward because of the COVID19.
245,Top exhibit,"Beautiful day well organised,  Interesting tours .  Most talked about prison,  its a shame it closed down ."
246,"Short Cruise, Nice Tour, but no info on Cage and Connery ...","If you want to visit Alcatraz make sure you book a fair way in advance. We almost missed out but some tickets became available just before we arrived in San Francisco. If you do miss out - make sure you keep checking, some might pop up closer to the date, like it did with us.It was one of the best things we did in San Fran. The boat trip doesn't take long and the boarding is very well organised. The Ranger who welcomed us was so informative and enthusiastic. The Audio guide tour was one of the best we have experienced. All our kids - 9,13 & 15 learnt so much and enjoyed completing the Junior Ranger booklets. A great time was had by all, just make sure you leave enough time to explore everything there is to see."
247,Alcatraz,A great way to look into the history of the rock and really get a feel for what it was like. The audio tour covers great history.  Don’t miss walking through the garner areas. Be prepared for a long climb to get to the cell house!
248,You have to go ,very well organised trip by the cruise company. Informative audio tour. Good views of the city. Well worth the travel.
249,2020 San Francisco,Great trip to iconic prisonTour is well organised. Tickets can be bought online and you avoid ticket queuesSome queuing to get on boat (if you want seat up on deck)If disabled let them know and they give priority boarding (as well as a lift up to the cell block)Short trip to island - opportunity to have photo taken and buy refreshmentsOn arrival quick introduction on quay then make way up to cell block where you have an audio-tour (included in tour price) which you can take at your own paceSee cells library exercise yards admin areas and dining room- commentary by ex guards and prisonersSome other areas to explore on your own though many areas cordoned off as unsafeNo refreshments available on islandTimes of boats back displayed in lots of placesVery interesting and excellent views of San Francisco and Golden Gate Bridge - both from island and boat
250,Amazing!!!,Buy your ticket online and print the QR code to skip the line. The day started blanketed with fog so a disappointing ferry ride over but when this cleared to blue skies it was absolutely epic. The views of San Fran and Golden Gate aren’t to be missed. The island itself is easy to navigate. The audio tour is a must and included with the ticket price. Solemn; tear jerking and amazing. You feel ghosts of the past around you. Walk down to the yard and look out the door...
251,Fascinating even though I wasn't too enthusiastic at first!,"Took Behind the Scenes and Night tour. Great way to see the basement, foundation, and garden of your island. You join the night tour right after the BTS but the last ferry leave later then u may be done. We had to wait 30 mins until we could leave the island. So time your evening according. We went back and watched the movie and attended some guided tours to kill time. Breezy. Wear layers and prepared to be cold"
252,Amazing!,It’s a great experience - audio tour of the cells is very good - views from the island are amazing. Touristy buy interesting and fun
253,Prison Life,"There is a lot of history and folklore about ""The Rock.""  Great place to site see and the San Francisco Bay Area scenery is truly magestic.  The ocean air is usually coll to cold so dress in layers.  I reccommend this tour for people without walking issues."
254,Great experience!,Book ahead and wear comfortable shoes/sneakers. It's a rather steep incline to the top with plateaus to stop and take pictures or catch your breath. Some beautiful picture spots along the way of San Fran and the Golden Gate bridge.
255,Fascinating history,"Absolutely magnificent to be able to visit the famous prison. Well worth the trip as the prison is slowly becoming extremely old and deteriorating, unfortunately in years to come this prison may not be able to take tourists. So if you want to see this prison put it on your bucket list to do. Ps- pending on the season you may have to book your tour weeks if not months in advance. Please don’t turn up on the day without a ticket you will not get on the tour."
256,Must see ,Grab your tickets on Pier 33 and jump on the ferry that takes you over to the island.  Nice ferry ride but take a jacket as it can be chilly on the water. Once on the island you get to explore with a audio guided tour.  Hear the tales and chilling stories of what life was like on the island for the inmates and guards.  For a better experience read up or watch anything on Alcatraz before you go. Bird man's cell a tad creepy.  Kids found it interesting but got a bit bored.  (Ages 8 to 15) Great historic location.  Glad we prebooked our tickets so we didn't miss out
257,A must is visiting San Francisco ,"Great staff to help with questions, and the guided audio tour was really well done. Highly recommend"
258,probably the best attractions in san francisco,Great trip on ferry and then a steep hill up to top.beautiful views.A good few hours to be had as there is a lot to see but your tour headphones are fantastic as they take you to all the worthwhile sites.
259,Worth going,"Great audio tour. Busy crowds, but historic venue captured very well. Leave a good 2-3hrs minimum to really enjoy all this place has to offer."
260,A must do when in San Francisco,This location was a prison as well as very old military fort. The fort use to shot cannons off across bow's of ships that were not flying any colors. This is also a much better spot to view in the early Fall months that are fog free.
261,Excellent Tour,"We were in San Francisco on a gorgeous day in February. A perfect day for a boat ride to the Rock. Maybe it was just me but I found the famous prison to be depressing. The thought about men trapped in these horrible bare cells year after year, and it was sad. I understand they were terrible criminals. But penning them in animal-like cages was disgustingly in humane. They didn’t deserve a country club. But cages....no."
262,A thought provoking visit...,Booked tickets with Alcatraz Cruises. Nice big boat with good seating.Alcatraz island was fantastic. Good audio tour so you don't need a tourist guide.And the boat ride over gives a fantastic view of the bay.A must visit when in SF.
263,Don’t miss ,Great informative audio tourTakes 2-3 hours to get aroundBook ahead online through official website as this place sells out weeks ahead during busy periods
264,Alcatraz @ Newyear,The whole tour is guided by an audio tour. It is an interesting tour about life in the prison and its inmates. It is creepy as everyone is walking round in silence listening to the audio guides. The actual island is beautiful and you get a lovely view of San Francisco. I would say not suitable for small children.
265,Stories that made me cringe,"A boat to the ""Rock"" and you're back in the 50's. Birdman, Al Capone, Machine Kelly, Mickey Cohen, 4 of the most famous tenants. Use the personal tape player to learn history. Not to mention the excellent views of the City by the Bay. A lovely ferry ride to the National Park. Great time in San Francisco, everybody's favorite city."
266,Fantastic,"Fantastic Place to visit, really interesting and immersive. The whole place is really interesting. Would Highly recommend"
267,Interesting but a little ‘hyped’. Expensive,"When you land on Alcatraz, there are restrooms and maps available.  There is a short intro by a guide and each day they offer 3-4 different lectures.  There is a small tram that is for the handicapped and will take you to the top and then back down as it is a steep and long climb to the cells.  The staff were very helpful and accomodating.  The audio tour was great.  It was good to have it to point out particular cells and places where things took place; things that may have gone unnoticed without the audio tour.  The prison itself is in awful condition and is understandable as to why it was closed.  The views from outside were beautiful."
268,Alcatraz visit,Very interesting and thorough history of the island and the prison. Worth visiting if in SF. Audio tour is very well made and engaging.
269,Learned so much and had a lot of fun! ,"See the history, enjoy the ferry, listen to excellent audio narrative and get transported to the past..."
270,Absolute Must in San Francisco ,Love the tour and getting a feel for prison life. The views of the City from the island and the boat ride out add tot he experience.
271,Well worth the trip!,"Tours to Alcatraz (by boat),normally need to be booked within 3 months of your visit, but we only needed a day or two to book. Tour slots fill up quickly. The latest tour is 1:30 p.m. It's an audio tour directing you where to go. You can pause,take pictures or venture elsewhere and resume the tour. It's great hearing the stories, learning the history and seeing as you go along. I certainly learned something!"
272,History,It is much smaller than we expected but rich in history. It is definitely worth a trip to The Rock !
273,No1 location to visit in San Fran. ,"Well organised and interesting, informative tour. Definitely get the headsets and walk around at your leisure. Interesting history as well as a refreshing ferry ride and great views."
274,What a place! ,If you want to do the guided tour and the self guides tour plan for at least 4hr on the island. If you really want to hear everything if not you can go directly to the self guided tour which was cool but difficult to navigate as everyone is going in different directions and you will run into and bump people. Also get there early as there is a two part check in system and typically a line for the boat. If you want a seat as well be there early as seats are limited on the boat. It was really cool to hear about the island from the tour guide and past inmates but we had limited time because of our next tour.
275,Very good from start to finish,The best bus tour to do.      The best bus tour to do               The best bus tour to do.The best bus tour to doThe best bus tour to doThe best bus tour to do
276,Night tour,"Great tour package and a must when visiting. Nice boat trip out, steep walk up but worth it, audio tour is fab and such a great story to hear and views all round"
277,BEST part of San Francisco so far....,"Get a taste of history, plus amazing views of San Francisco.  The audio tour is informative, but you cannot rewind. We caught the first ferry to avoid the crowd."
278,Fun and exciting ,"A must visit National Park in SFO.With your paid ticket you get free admission to 4-5 other San Francisco area.This island prison was for the most vicious criminals.The stories sent chills up my spine.The audio is super full of informative stories with sound effects.The island is a sanctuary for many species of birds. Once migration begins for some of them, areas are protected so they can breed.We had a great experience.Dress warm or you will be cold and uncomfortable the entire time you are there.Keep in mind you are surrounded by water and all the buildings are concrete and cold!Make your reservation on line, it will save you a lot of waiting."
279,Glad I’ve been ,"The place sort of oozes with despair - a genuine lack of hope. This prison housed some of the most dangerous characters in the history of criminal justice. It is confining, cold and sad. It's residents had little value for human life or decency. It is a profoundly eye opening experience. Make the trip."
280,Great trip to Alcatraz !!,Excellent tour.  Things to do for all ages.  Nice gift store and friendly Park Service employees.  Take the tram to the top and walk down.
281,Alcatraz Cruises,"The boat ride on the bay alone is worth it. Then you get to wander the island and learn about the history. The views of the city from Alcatraz are outstanding, so take a camera."
282,A must do,The tour takes you out on a boat all the way through the bay with great views of the Golden Gate bridge and the bay bridge. You can also view some sea life and then get the excellent tour of the prison.
283,Woooaw . Amazing feeling,"Fascinating place and such beautiful views from the island.  Audio tour was very interesting, make sure to also buy a $1 map and go around the whole island.  Learnt more about the history of the island than I thought I would."
284,What a great day trip,Worth your time and money! Make sure you order and reserve your tickets along with departure time online several weeks before you go.
285,Wknd,It was once interesting and frightening place. Audio tour was super. Nature on the island is beautiful and the views are wonderful. Hard to belive that was scarier place in the world.
286,More insightful than I thought,"This is a must see! Absolute best self guided tour I've ever done. Give yourself plenty of time to see everything,  at least 4 hours."
287,Iconic! An absolute must. ,"If you have more than a two days to freely spend in San Francisco, I would recommend Alcatraz. Short boat cruise to island is very pleasant. Program in the is good organized. Most of the places are not permitted to visit (i.e. second floor of the cell house, kitchen, number of buildings in the island  so on). Not much material left inside. You’ll have to visually imagine the life in the island by listening free audio tour. The audio tour is quite good by the way. My Overall experience was good."
288,Loved the experience. ,"Well organised, very informative. Highly recommend you visit if you can. One of the highlights of our holiday"
289,A very intressant journey,"The walking electronic tour guide, you can move at your own pace, stop the tour at any time, then continue."
290,Behind the scene tour,"Buy timed tickets in advance to avoid queue at box office at Pier 33.  The boat queue moved quickly once boarding started. Calm day so the short boat ride was great with soft drinks and snacks available (although lots of people seemed to have brought their own).  A guide greets new arrivals at the island pier with the usual H&S info and 2 minute what you will see see. A map for $1 donation is available here, then after a short walk up hill go indoors and watch an introductory film. Then continue up towards the cell block.   If you need help walking there is a shuttle that will take you from the pier to the top of the hill where the cell block is.I recommend taking the self guided audio tour but listen carefully to the instructions and look at the signs and stop the tape if you are falling behind to read more of the information or just admiring the view or you might find yourself missing a section.  It was interesting to hear the story of the island from multiple points of view - guards, prisoners, families and the special exhibition about the Indian occupation.  Having finished inside (at the obligatory shop) and handed back the tape, we wandered around the island (some steep stairs) back towards the dock (parts are blocked off during bird nesting).With great views of San Francisco and the Bay and you can easily see why the ""escapees"" thought they could swim to freedom and why they probably did not make it."
291,Good but not great,bring your own earbuds (they have only 3.5mm audio jack) to listen to a narrated tour of the rich history of the prison. pause the audio as you like and take it in at your own pace. there's also nothing like seeing the city from the water! highly HIGHLY recommend.
292,Disappointed with the Political Leanings of the Behind the Scenes Tour...,Do yourself a favor and book a Behind the Scenes nigh Tour!  You won't be sorry.  You get access to areas that the rest of the public can't and get a personalized tour.  I highly recommend this tour.  Bring a camera!
293,Informative tour.,Absolutely worth a trip. Beside the history the view is just amazing but also listening to all the stories on audio guide and seeing the tiny cells gives you a picture of how it must have been there
294,Behind The Scenes Tour,This is a classic San Francisco landmark that is definitely worth the visit. Be sure to buy your ticket for the ferry ahead of time to make things easier: I hopped off the streetcar and walked straight into the line for the first ferry of the day. Definitely do the audio tour as it really helps you to visualize what life was like for the prisoners who used to occupy the cells on the island.
295,Best Birthday Present Ever!!!,"Amazing views from the ferry, eerie but must see attraction when visiting San Francisco. Book ahead through the official website for the best rates, arrive early so not rushed. I visited as one of my days out while in the USA for a work trip. I’m so pleased that we made the effort to book ahead!"
296,Great Tour ,"Interesting but highly overpriced. This park is listed on the USGS site that accepts the “America the Beautiful” Access pass but because of the ferry, they charge full price."
297,Winter on the rock ,"One of the best tourist trips ever! Informative, well paced, well organised would definitely recommend"
298,Well worth the trip,"Be sure to reserve your tickets in advance and plan to spend a few hours on the island, learning about its history.   The grounds are fairly well preserved and the tours are well spaced.   We were fortunate to visit when crowds were light.   The breeze and the views back to the city are magnificent!"
299,Put this as the top of your list,"Do yourself a favor and read up on Alcatraz history before you go, you will enjoy it so much better. So much history to this little island.  Pro tip: Get there early and bring food and water. Enjoy the whole day there."
