0,ASIA's Longest Drive IN Beach,Muzhappilangad Drive-in Beach is a Asia's longest drive in beach where you can enjoy your driving on sea shore. Entry fee is 40 for car and 20 for bike.Must visit place in Thalaserry
1,Good to see something unique,"Muzhappilangad Beach is famous for being Asia's only drive in beach. At about 7km from Thalassery in Kannur, you have 4 km of sand that awaits you to simply drive along as you soak in the view of the beautiful Malabar Coast.  Along the way, one gets to munch on delicacies from a number of shacks that offer authentic Malabar cuisine. It is often considered a swimmers paradise as the black rocks protect the beach from deep currents. This is a perfect way to relax and soak in this clean and well maintained beach."
2,Biking,Muzhappilangad Drive-in Beach is the only driving beach in kerala and the longest one also . driving here is a real experience to have
3,Nice & Clean,"Muzhappilangad is considered to be the longest drive-in beach in Asia. This beach is about 12 km south of Thottada, where we were staying, and about 15 km south of Kannur. It took about 15 minutes to drive down via NH66, the Panvel Kochi National Highway, till Edakkad, then we took a right turn at the Muzhappilangad Post Office to reach the beach. We had to pay an entry fee of ₹40 for the car. The ticket had a message from the Kerala Police which said that the speed limit on the beach is 20 kmph.There were all kinds of vehicles on the beach; buses, jeeps, cars, SUVs, motorcycles, vans, scooters, bicycles, tuk-tuks with passengers as well as tuk-tuks selling ice-creams and snacks. Still the beach did not look crowded and there was ample space for people to test their driving skills. Families were playing games like cricket and football and others having a swim in the sea.We had a cup of coffee at a nearby restaurant and drove down on the beach for about 3 km till we reached a break in the beach due to channel of flowing rain water from inland. There was a group of rocky islands further south, and an island known as the Dharmadam Island, which we could see in the distance. We could have gone further but that would mean driving into the seawater shallows. So we turned back in time to watch the sunset before driving back to Kannur. The total length of the drivable part of the beach must be between 5 to 6 km.The drive was very smooth and the sand was firm, but there were some undulations in the sand which acted as mild natural speed breakers as our car sailed over them quite gently. However, one must be careful not to keep the car stationary in the shallow water for too long as the receding waves wash the sand away under the tires and the vehicle may get stuck. And drive safe, as everyone thinks that they own the beach!"
4,Amazing Experience,Muzhappilangad Beach is one of the best drive beach in India. It is more than 5 KM lengthy. I have visited two times there. You won't find any food stalls over there.
5,"No Road Rules, But Learn Driving Here.",Muzhapilangad drive -in beach is largest drive -in beach in India.it is clean and quiet .the specialty of the beach is the thickness of the sand.And can drive 4 km distance of this beach with beautiful scenic.
6,What a place !!!!!,"Muzhapplilangad is arguably one of the best drive in beaches in India, it has 7km long drive path where you can drive your two-wheeler or car. The beach is never crowded and you will have complete privacy with family."
7,Clean beach,"One of the TOP 6 -DRIVE IN BEACHES of the WORLD is in KERALA-MUZHAPPILANGAD DRIVE-IN-BEACH is of 5.5 km length where most of the people come to drive rather than to play in water. This beach is the longest Drive-In Beach in India and is featured among the top 6 best beaches for driving in the world in BBC article for Autos. Even though Goa has many beautiful beaches, it does not have a Drive-in beach. You are allowed to drive for around 4 Kms."
8,Fun but watch out for speeding cars,"Muzhapilangad beach is the longest drive in beach in Kerala, situated in Kannur district. It has been portyayed in the malayalam film Thattathin marayathu and at times, adventure tourism events like para gliding, micro lote flying etc are being conducted. The beach sand has the fluid from a micro organism, due to which it can withstand vehicle weigt for some duration. If you park your vehicle in the beach for long duration, it may go down a bit in sand, not a big deal."
9,Family trip,"Muzhappilangad beach is the most popular tourist destination in Kannur district and rightly so. This is one of the very few drive-in beaches in Asia and has recently found a place in BBC's list of top drive-in beaches in the world. Apart from being a motorable beach, this place is blessed with immense natural beauty. Overall, a must visit place in Kannur."
10,Nice beach and awesome sunset,Also known as the drive in beach it's bout 10km from kannur town. The major attraction here is that it is the only beach in India on which u can drive a vehicle without the problem of the vehicle getting stuck in the sand .It's worth a visit and is very pleasant
11,Once in your life,This Beach is very nice beach in kannur district in kerala.we can drive through beach more than 5 km.from this beach we can se darmadam island also
12,One of rare beaches where you can drive but still not splash sea water on your car,"Muzhapillangad beach is one of the cleanest beaches I have been to in India, less crowded, almost a stretch of 5km beach where you can drive with waves hitting your car all through. Very scenic place, enjoyed taking pics. Stayed at a place called Samudra Homes, sea view from this home stay was amazing. But it wont be wise to spend more than a night here at Muzhapillangad, as there is no other place to visit apart from St Angelos Fort (at 10kms). Overall a nice experience for a one day trip."
13,Unexplored but polluted by Vehicles,Muzhappilangad Drive-in Beach is great for spending evening time.Please avoid Sundays to visit because beach almost crowded with vehicles and local tourists. There is a speed limit on the beach 20 KM/H.
14,Different experience,This beach is between Thalassery and Kannur and Muzhappilangad Beach is the only drive in beach in Kerala and the largest drive in beach in Asia .You can drive about 4kms in this beachThe sand is hard enough in this beach and you can drive your car on the entire stretch of the beach. The excitement of driving a bike or car over the waves is really high.
15,Nice Drive-in Beach,"Muzhappilangad beach, beautiful beach for driving, we all like and enjoy few hours here, good atmosphere and average facilities"
16,Unique experience,🇮🇳 indias one and only one drive in beach Our muzappilangad beachIs beautiful and unique beach Enriched with state and interstate tourists as well as foreigners Repeated accidents and lack of maintenance makes the beach little problematic
17,Best beach in India (biggest self drive in beach of Asia),"This is one of the most impressive places to visit in the whole of Kerala. The longest drive-in beach of Asia, this place will mostly be crowded on weekends, holidays and festival seasons. More than four kilometers of lone and level sands where you could drive by the waves is something you would find nowhere else in the country."
18,amazing ride,"Kerala’s only drive-in beach and perhaps india's only one, the Muzhappilangad beach which stretches across four kilometres of sand is a place, where one can drive down the entire length on his vehicle. It is also an ideal place  for sampling the famed Malabar cuisine from the many eateries available in the immediate hinterland. Big Black rocks protect this long, clean beach from the currents of the deep, making the shallow waters a swimmer’s paradise. These rocks also provide habitat for Blue mussel,  which also is a delicious seafood. The Beach attracts bird-watchers from all around the world as varied species of birds flock here during various seasons.The beach festival is held in the month of April and it forms one of the important tourist attraction of district Kannur in Kerala.This festival attracts largely young adventurous people who try many driving stunts in cars like drifting and wheeling in bikes.A little away 100m from this beach you find d find another beautiful attraction of private island Dharmadam island, which can be reached by walk at times of low tide."
19,Muzhappilangad beach,It was a awesome beach it was only one drive in beach in kerala. Kannur district's most visiting pace is muzhappilangadu drive in beach
20,Muzhappilangadu Beach,This is a very long beach easily approachable from National highway. Nearest town is Thalassery about 7 km away.we can drive through the beach.sun set is beautiful.swimming is allowed to a limited extent only. Not much of lifeguards in case of emergency. No eating places nearby. Local population is good.worth spending some quality time here. We never get bored here.
21,Muzhappilangad drive in Beach,The beach is between Kannur and Thalassery . Easily approacable from highway. It's the only drive-in beach in Kerala. The evenings are very crowded.
22,Driving beach 🤩,For visiting Muzhappilangad Drive-in Beach we gathered lot of happiness. A very interesting experience. Long sandy flat beach which cars are allowed to drive into. The sand is quite compacted to support the weight of the car and in most areas wide enough for at least 2 to 3 cars to drive in parallel. Just make sure to not drive into the salt water as it will corrode the vehicle. This is a must visit if one is in Kannur/Thalassery. Enjoyable place.
23,Fantastic experience ,The most ever beach of kerala we had enjoyed. This beach is the longest Drive-In Beach in India and is featured among the top 6 best beaches for driving in the world in BBC article. Muzhappilangad is the only Asian beach featured in the list. It is considered as the longest drive-in beach in Asia. It is one of the important tourist attraction in the district of Kannur in Kerala. The youth also try many driving stunts in cars like drifting and wheeling in bikes as this is a paradise for driving along the shore. Great scene and did so many photography Enjoyed refreshing moment of life.
24,Driving beach ,"If you are in Kannur, you should not miss this drive on beach experience. Beach is very panoramic. Sunset is specially great time to be there. Beach is about 4 Kms long and you can drive in water or just on sand. Not much commercialised. So you will not find shops (one tea spot and couple of local ice cream sellers). Water and beach itself cleaner than other beaches in Kannur. Overall good fun."
25,Pleasure to drive,This place can be reached by travelling about 15km from Kannur in Kerala. This beach is hardly 1.5km from the National Highway. The speciality is one can drive through the beach. Being monsoon the beach was shortened. So there was not much vehicles. So a few fishermen fishing with nets. The catch of the day was crabs. I asked whether it was planned or... They replied that the plan was for fish. But it's worth a fine catch because crabs are sold at about Rs.200/kg.
26,Drive in beach ,Loved driving car on Muzhappilangad drive in beach.Its pretty safe and a must visit beach while in kannur. Make sure you get a nice pressure wash for your car after the drive.
27,Drive in beach,"Muzhappilangad beach (also Muzhuppilangad) enjoys the distinction of being the only drive-in-beach in Kerala.Probably among the best drive-in-beaches of the world, lengthy stretch of 4 kilometres can be driven with ease without any fear of getting stuck in sand.And the good news is, it is rightly legal to drive along the beach.The 7 kms long beach attracts its fair share of visitors, mostly those who want to enjoy a fine ride through the sandy shore line in their car or on motor bike.The beach is almost empty during weekdays"
28,Drive in Beach ,"Lying close to Kannur railway station and Calicut airport, Muzhappilangad Beach is famous for being Kerala's only drive in beach as 4 km of sand and a shimmering Malabar coastline can be viewed from the road.  The waters are protected from deep currents by the black rocks that protect the beach so this place is considered a swimmers paradise as well."
29,Amazing Beach 💙🌞,The beach is situated near Kannur and also has a beautiful ambience. It was a drizzling day and there were high tides. So we weren't allowed to drive in the beach. We weren't allowed to enter because of the strong tides. Just make sure that you go in a better time so that you can enjoy and come with loads  of memories.
30,A wonderful place to be,Must visit place in kannur. You can drive your car on the beach. It was amazing. Beach is clean and surroundings awesome.
31,Enthralling attraction,It is one of the famous beach in Kannur. I have visited here many times with my friends and family members. Many people are coming here for drive and relaxing. It will be very crowded on holidays and weekends. We can easily reach here by road. It is very beautiful and amazing beach and it is very neat and quiet. Morning and evening are the best time to visit here. Sunrise and sunset are very nice to see. We will get tasty and variety of food items from good hotels with reasonable price. This place is completely safe so that we can enjoy here with family and friends.

37,Drive in beach ,This is the only drive in beach in Kerala where you can drive your vehicle along the shore  for almost 4 kms through the beach
38,Superb Experience Driving on the beach,"Muzhapallingad beach is ideal for a beach  ,but make sure when you are parking that's you are nearby as tides may suddenly turn .It is a very scenic spot and note it is not in kannur but more near to thalaserry.Ideak time would be early morning .The beach is gas done rocky areas which can be reached during low tide"
39,What more. A drive in beach.,Excellent beach; 10km away from kannur; must visit. Very clean and beautiful beach. No 1 beach in kannur.
40,Drive in Beach,"Drive-IN beaches in India are very rare, this one located in Kannur, Kerala is a paradise for all those who have a dream of driving along the beach.There are few things that you need to know  before you head there,1) Keep in mind you need to clean your car after you drive in the sea water, or it's gonna rust your car.2) Do not go very deep in the water with your car or place it under the water for a long as the wheels will do inside, and it will be quite a task to take it out.The villages near the beach will charge you around 2000 to take the car out such inside the sand ( Beware )The best time to go there will be around 5 pm in the evening or early in the morning, where it won't be too sunny and you can click beautiful pictures of your car by the sea."
41,Fun @ the beach,Great place near Kannur to relax and recharge. Amazing drive along the beach for 4 kilometers. Typical Arabian sea beach with less waves and a clean sand. Definitely a best among the north Kerala beaches. I would suggest to visit in the morning.
42,Longest drive-in beach in India,"Unique experience of drive-in. On the way from Thalassery to Kannur, you can enter the beach with an entry ticket for your vehicle. Go in the evening, though it will be crowded, to enjoy the sunset."
43,Great empty beach,"Muzhappilangad Drive-in Beach (മുഴപ്പിലങ്ങാട് കടപ്പുറം) (5.5 km length)[1] is a beach in the state of Kerala in southwestern India. It is located parallel to National Highway 66(formerly National Highway 17) between Thalassery and Kannur.This beach is the longest Drive-In Beach in India and is featured among the top 6 best beaches for driving in the world in BBC article for Autos.[2] Even though Goa has many beautiful beaches, it does not have a Drive-in beach.longest drive in beach in AsiaThe beach festival is celebrated in the month of April and it is one of the important tourist attraction in the district of Kannur in Kerala. The youth also try many driving stunts in cars like drifting and wheeling in bikes as this is a paradise for driving along the shore.

49,Amazing,Must see Drive in beach in Kannur district.....Clean long drive IN beach.Also better place to play football
50,A new enjoyable Experience,"This is apparently the only drive in beach in India. The expanse is 4 kms which means you get to drive a fair bit. The sand is firmly packed which makes it conducive for driving.There is a nominal entry fee, taken next to a signboard saying 'driving on the beach not allowed'. However, it is an experience-of-a-lifetime. You can drive your vehicle almost touching the water. There are a few stalls where you can grab a bit.It is a great way to watch the sunset. If you get too close to the water, you may feel a bit of a pull; so be careful. Also, there are people walking on the beach & children playing in the water; so take care while driving."
51,One of kind experience in India,The best drive-in beach in north Kerala. Probably the only beach in India where they let you drive your cars on the 4km strech.
52,One of the best expireance but with few points you must take care,"The wow experience...!!!, scenic beach which is the only drive in beach in Kerala (i guess). was quiet and calm area."
53,Splash them waves - one of the best drive in beaches,"It pretty nice and clean beach, it about 13 km from Kannur city, if you have your own vehicle than no issues to reach there, of you are hiring an auto rickshaws they will charge you the return fare as well which in total will be around 250, the beach is around 1km from the main road, one can get busses to the city from the main road. The beach is secluded you will see people in there 4 and 2 wheelers enjoying the ride. You can take bath it's safe. If you are taking you vehicle there keep an watch on the tide so as not to get stuck. Preferably carry your food and water as there is only one shop I noticed."
54,Best experience sitting in your own car ,This beach is one of the best sights of Kerala which is actually gods own country. Do not miss this place.
55,The Only Good Beach in Kannur,A must visit beach in India and this is the best drive in beach in South India. I have been here once and I liked the place. Little far from the Kannur city but a must visit place in Kannur. Highly recommended!
56,Good experience ,This is a unique beach in India where you can drive your vehicle literally on the sand. It's one of the best beaches. You'll find numerous vehicles. The sunset is very famous here. It's a fun beach.
57,Have to experience once in Life,"when you are on kannur, you have to visit this one. approx 5 kms long strech right on beach, you can drive into water & splash it around.Not many beaches offers you such experience. Sand is thick enough to carry weight of car & gives you immense experience. be careful not to go too much inside & wash your car later .sure worth visit."

61,A beach....,Clean long drive in beach which is more than 4 km long .Visit during low tide to get a beautiful wide shore
62,Amazing drive-in beach,May be most under rated tourist attraction in North Kerala. Most exhilarating experience. Sparking sea to one side and greenery to one side. Unique experience driving through sandy beach.
63,A must see place in the district,"A nice peaceful beach near thalassery. Probably the only drive-in beach in South. Suggest not to take your vehicle into water, the salt content in sea water may harm your vehicle parts. Get a good wash for your vehicle immediately after you leave this place."
64,Only drive in beach in kerala,"We visited this beach at Muzhappilangad on our way back from Kannur. It,s the first time we are going to a drive in beach and the experience was wonderful. The sea is very calm without much waves. You can walk, jog or drive along the water edge. The weather was also fine. Since it was morning hours, there was no crowd, only two or three cars were there. we spent around an hour here. Ver nice experience."
65,Very nice drive in beach,"What a beautiful beach it is !!! Had an awesome experience there, as it is the only beach in India  where we can drive. That particular feeling is the highlight of the whole experience. The sea shore has many seashells as well, which is also an attraction. Not very much recommended for bathing over there in this beach, however driving is must. Get a bike there n enjoy the beauty."
66,Excellent experience,This drive-in beach is the most fascinating place which is well maintained and have responsible staff to take care of it. We liked the cleanliness and eco practices at most of the tourist spots in Kannur. The local community are very hospitable.
67,Cycling,This is the best beach in India for family with young kids. It's a flat beach n kids will HV fun . Don't forget to eat ice cream on beach
68,Drive in Beach,"It is supposedly India's longest drive-in beach and sure it lives up to its reputation. Driving on the beach is pleasurable and while one needs to be careful of folks on the beach it is totally a very different experience. Overall the place was clean and though not many options for snack, etc. it does have a few mobile carts for ice-creams etc.The waves are very gentle and totally safe even for small kids and is a nice place to just laze around in the sea. Evenings are wonderful though am sure it would be equally amazing during the day time"
69,Wonderful experience with drive in the beach,"The beach is beautiful. Not much crowded and clean. As it's the only drive in beach in India it's a must visit place. Warning, don't drive too much in the sea as your car might get stuck in the mud."
70,Wide beach in Kannur,"Nice & clean beach, which is one of the longest beach in India. Maintained well with good control of crowd & cleanliness at the best."
71,Drive in,"I would rate this beach next to Kovalam on playing in water. very safe to play during my visit on 13th August. Driving through beach is good, but will complete in few minutes. But playing in sea water is real enjoyment and we did that on the beach for more than 3 hrs."
72,One of the most exciting  things to do in Kannur,His looks to be only clean beach in Kannur. Drivable beach for around 4KM. Be careful not to go in to drive on wave just wait and let it come otherwise your vehicle might stuck in sand. A different experience
73,beautiful long beach,"The one and only drive in beach in Kerala. The approach roads are very small, but once you get onto the beach, a lovely sight awaits you. You can spend hours here admiring the beauty of the sea and the beach."
74,"Great place to drive, relax and enjoy with family",This is the only drive in beach in Asia so it is must visit place. Make sure that when you travel to this there should be no cyclone because they won’t allow youbto drive car at that time. Nice place for taking pics and different feeling in driving car on sea shore
75,One of the best drive in beaches in India,I think it is the only Drive-in beach in India. Excellent Drive-in beach. We can drive very close to the water for about 1.5 KM and it is a thrilling experience. Must see place.in Kerala.
76,Drive with Sea ,"Main attraction of this place is this drive in beach.Driving speed should be 20km/hr.But most of them are not following the rule.It is a different experience to drive so close of sea.MMesmerising view,Just loved the place"
77,best drive in beach in kerala,This is such a picturesque beach setting that one will not forget so easily. If in Kerala this place must not be missed.
78,one of the amazing beaches,"the only beach in asia where you can drive with sea. amazing sites and wonderful experience. the rough arabian sea will give you mesmerizing views.be care full about the speed of your car, generally people overspread which could be very dangerous."
79,Extraordinary setting for a beach,Quite an unique experience of driving on the beach. The beach is absolutely clean and flat. A must visit tourist place in Kannur.Beware of car rentals. They have hidden penalty clauses for driving on the beach.
80,fantastic place,"nice beach,you can drive your car on this beach.You can also walk about 500mtr in the water as the beach dosnt sink.Nice to  enjoy with family and Friends.A garden is attached to this beach,to relax and watch sunset"
81,Awesome driving on the beach,"My family was on our road trip last week and reached muzhupilangadi beach on Saturday at 4 pm. We parked our new vehicle near the water and went with our kids for swimming. After the sunset when we reached there we have forgotten that during evening it will be high tide and our SUVs wheels are almost submerged and we could not drive out. The locals tried to call craine service which never came, atlast we could convince locals by offering 2000 rs to pull the vehicle out of water. Later other people told us that it happens regularly in the beach, locals will wait and later come bargain and settle for huge amount to pull the vehicle out. So my dear friend, it's one of the best beaches less Goan beaches and it's funny to drive but don't park near the water."
82,Sea beauty,This Beach is wide and neat. It is drive in beach. Good place to visit with family. It is easy accessible. Roads are maintained well.
83,Amazing drive-in beach,"The only drive into beach in India. Its amazing driving on the sands and the shore. Would highly recommend having a full car wash as soon as leaving the beach, to protect the car from sand and salt"
84,Excellent beach to drive & play,"This is one of the two drive-in beaches in india ( the other one being Mandarmani in WB). Absolute fun to drive right into the beach. You can drive along the shore for around 2kms and watch the beautiful sun set on the Arabian sea. There are a couple of vendors selling some tea, ice cream, etc but the beach is relatively clean. During post monsoon you can see the beach filled with sea shells, star fish, etc, most of them alive. If you drive too close to the water there is a chance you will run over them. Since it is not too deep and the waves are not too harsh, you can play and swim without any fear in this beach. One of my all time favourite beaches!"
85,an unique experince,One of the few drive in beaches in India. The sand here is very hard so it is really safe to drive. The beach also is very clean and good place to have fun in the water. Unfortunately there aren't any good hotels nearby so will need to stay in Kannur itself. A visit to Kannur would be incomplete if you do not visit this place.
86,Start your engine.,"Its a  must visit. I was on a bike trip to Bangalore, i saw a board Muzhappilnagad beach 1KM. Just took a detour and experienced a lifetime feel. Avoid during monsoon, best timing during the day is mornings or evenings where you will have  a wonderful backdrop sky. Its just 10 rs for two wheelers and 40 for cars. There are 4 entry points to this beach and you can drive for around 4.5 kms. Dont get into the water, I did the mistake while taking photo and bike got stuck. People who like travel go for it, you can have excellent food near by Thalasserry resturants as well. There are small tea shops run by ladies, park your vehicle and dont forget to have chai from there."
87,Loved the drive in beach.,Beach is very beautiful and its around 5KM long stretched cluster. You can take your drive through the beach.
88,Only in the evenings,"The only driving beach in south India, wide area for a titillating drive amongst the waves. The sand is super thick and it does not soften except close to the sea. Remember to wash the car/motorbike to avoid salt water corrosion. The stretch is close to 5 Kms and tends to get crowded during weekends."
89,Hidden Beauty!! ,"The largest drive  in beach  in India. Most beautiful  and attractive to the riders, family, and couples. The pleasure  is calm and silent  sea and the most attractive sunset."
90,Drive in Beach - The BEST,the best drive in beach in kerala .beautiful but not too crouded to have fun .I think one of the best places to have a family trip without others involvement
91,Must visit place for beach drive,One of the only beach in kerala to driv. u hav a good strech to driv and there is heavy rush during weekends. Driv carefully since there are lots of kids all around
92,Good drive in beach in Kannur,longest drive in beach in India. Amazing place to have a life time experience of driving on a beach with family.
93,"Drive, Drive, Drive",I can say one of the best drive in beach in India or probably Asia. Very clean and nice beach to enjoy the beach driving experience.
94,Nice,Such a beautiful and clean beach where you get to drive your car as well 😊 it is a jewel of a place. Swimming is absolutely not advisable and stay clear of this place during the monsoon time since the water comes up way high so you won’t be able to drive on the beach.
95,Awesome,"This is the only one Drive beach in India. But  please do not do stunts because local people were witnes for so many stunt activities and accident so now they will not allow you they will warn you.  It is great experience drive in beaches and is great. please service your vehicle after done it, if you dont want ruin your vehicle"
96,One of the best beaches,"If your on the way to north Kerala it's a must watch*hardly 4 kms from calicut-kannur highway.#only drive in beach in South India .#no restaurants available near by so it's always better to bring eatables&drinking water.#vehicle tips1.do a wash immediately after the drive as the water is highly corrosive.2.park the vehicles away from the beach after the 4km ride on the beach ,as it is very difficult to lift the vehicles from sand shore if you park it close to the beach."
97,Great beach for driving ..,Beautiful sandy beach with Drive in Beach. It has become a craze among local youth to race with their fancy bikes and cars on this only drive in beach in Malabar state of India. So those who want to have a walk on the beach be careful please.!!
98,Excellent drive in beach ,"Such a beautiful beach, i really enjoyed and one and only driving beach in kerala. Wonderful sunset view has there."
99,Holiday,"For Rs. 30 (entry fee), it was a unique driving experience along the 4km stretch. The beach was not very crowded, but you must watch out for people who are standing in the water catching the waves. Suitable for all cars and two wheelers as the  sands are quite hard. After a couple of laps up and down, we parked and got into the water  to catch waves. The beach itself was quite clean and the waters nice. Definitely  recommended,  in fact a must do if you are holidaying in kannur."
100,Once in a lifetime experience,"Great ""drive-in"" beach perhaps the only one in India and the longest in Asia.  Be careful where you park your car.  As long as you are driving it's all right but when you park near to the water every time the waves pass under, your vehicle gets swamped into the sand beneath and then your car is stuck and can't pull out of water.  There are a group of locals who are waiting exactly for this to happen.  They come over and then tell you the only solution is to call a crane and pull it out.  Then you are scared further by quoting how exorbitant the cost of crane is (10000/-) and how it might take several hours for it to come.  Since it would be getting dark and there is the probability of high tide coming which could wash away your car, you would 99% succumb to the pressure and agree to the extortion by these locals who would easily pull out the vehicle and take away a hefty amount from you. So what should you do ?1) Avoid parking near water, after driving through, always park at dry place towards land.  2) If stuck gather a few people (5-6) who can just lift the rear of the car and you can easily put it out.  3)  Look around there would be few others like you stuck with their cars, pool in them and help each other to lift up the rear side.Note : 4x4 won't have this problem.Note2:  Remember drive in on sea water could rust your wheel and underside of your car.  So after having the drive-in fun do at least a basic water wash same day and get a pressure wash done at least the next day.  Hope this helps.  Follow these few things and enjoy your drivein as it still is a great experience.  The beach is very neat."
101,The best beach of this place,Nice beach with 6-7 km long stretch wherein you can drive with Car. It is Sticky n very salty water N sand and cleanly maintained beach. We can spend 1-2 days near by beach homestay. Samudra homestay is an decent one. You can make this beach as part of your along with Kannur St George fort and Wayanad.
102,Unique experience,"i hope there is such type of beach is available in India very beautiful and very attractive,You can nicely drive the car in the beach,new experience"
103,What a Beach !!!! Simply wow !!,"You can drive up to 3KM on sand and just next to tides. You can have great photos with your family, car and sunset at beach.You can get great snaps on golden sands. But- There is no discipline. You may feel like you are on F1 track when you try to walk on the shore. You may have to brake hard when you drive on shores to avoid reckless drivers, people who pop up suddenly in front of your vehicle, etc. There is no proper guidance, no proper police monitoring. Though beach/life guards try their best, they are very much limited in numbers to cover all 3KM- so be careful while you play in sea.I would say find a place where less number of cars are plying. Park your car, enjoy the beach, be very cautious about reckless drunken drivers. Be very watchful on your kids."
104,Really nice drive-in beach.,"For a few rupees you can drive on to this stunning beach, but be careful. It is possible to choose an unwise route and get stuck!"
105,Excellent driving beach,AN excellent beach to have fun and don't miss this place . Probably one of the best beaches in Asia to drive through waves
106,Drive with the waves ..,"I visited the beach two timea during my 6 days in Malabar Beach Resort. I love this beach. My family loved the beach very much. my two years old son was playing for hrs in beach and he enjoyed the small water creatures exposed in beach water. He saw star fish, live snails and crabs in beach. He really loved them and he was super excited through out the water time. My 10 years old son enjoyed waves and play with younger brother.there are good snacks shops and you can take short breaks in between play time. We enjoyed sunset on both visits and it was worth waiting in the evening. I never saw public transport to this beach, so please plan accordingly."
107,One of its kind ,"It’s the only drivable beach in India , so I am told!! Drove my bike during sunset time and had lots of fun."
108,A nice drive in,Adipoli adipoliAdipoli adipoli.. nice place. For family and kids to enjoy beach peacfully .once you get your vehicle on the salt water or had splash with your car on the sea water make sure you thoroughly wash your car inside out.... Or ready pay a a heafty amount on corotion of metal part... Or may you need change entire parts... Beware...
109,A must visit if you enjoy travel,This is the longest drive-in beach of Asia ( as told by local residence and we spent an evening there enjoying thoroughly with my family and friend's family. REcommend to go for anybody who visit Kannur.
110,Amazing and a Must visit,A good drive in beach in kannur. For ma visit it little bit rush with vehicles. But anyway its nice.
111,Made my day..,The best Drive In beach. speed limit is 20 kms/hr so we can enjoy the ride as well as the beach while seating in car.
112,Exhilarating,What a place! An amazing drive-in beach. One of its kind in Kerala. Just dont miss this place if you happen to go to Kannur. A must visit place!
113,Must Visit,Awesome Experience.Driving in water is thrilling experience.Rs.30 is entry fees which is nominal.You could drive at your wish and can go littlebit inside also.At last corner of the beach your kids could collect beautiful shells and they will enjoy lot.Most amazing place seen till today..
114,Great drive!!,"A very beautiful and clean beach.Kerala’s only drive-in beach and perhaps india’s only one, the Muzhappilangad beach which stretches across four kilometres of sand is a place, where one can drive down the entire length on his vehicle."
115,awesome drive-in area,"This is a beautiful beach with a really nice view. It's a drive-in beach so if you have a car or bike, you can drive into the beach splashing water.. Movie style. The sea was rough owing to the monsoon. There are no lights or promenade to walk on the beach. Won't recommended it in the evening. It's very good as long there is sunlight. There are no shops nearby the beach."
116,Once in a lifetime experience,"When first visited Kannur for a friend's wedding in 2011, things to do was suggested by the hotel guys was Drive in beach. We were all surprised to hear and thought probably it is allowed to drive to some extent and park vehicles after that....... But that was just surprising to see it was literally the drive-in-beach where you could drive n drive for kms. A clean beach to play and enjoy.Again yrs later we visited the beach with family and children... it was just the same clean beach. You can leave kids to enjoy the sand and water (beware of reckless drivers).... they just enjoyed playing and never wanted to leave the beach at all. Our vehicle was driven a few mts inside the sea, was fun and lost our rear number plate LOL,,, but was fun! Only draw back is no toilets/ change rooms  and thus difficult for children and women."
117,One of a kind beach,Wow experience to drive on a beach!!! It is approx 4km long. You can enjoy every moment there. Did a car wash immediately after the drive
118,Awesome drive in beach,This is the first time I visited Kerala. Very clean beach with good maintenance. Amazing experience you will find with drive in beach on sandy road. Upto 3 km streach we can have driving. Nice beach
119,The best ever beaches we had enjoyed,"awesome drive and it is wonderful walk too... we can even collect small sized crabs, shrimps, starfish  as a take back home ... those who wanna collect... very quiet beach i must say... the entry fee is rs.30/- but no time limit restrictions... if u have small kids and want to be there for more than 2 hours make sure u have water bottles and some snacks.. as there are no shops... but what ever one eats or drinks jus don dispose the garbage in the open..."
120,"""A for AWESOME""",I took a detour on my travel from Mangalore - Mahe just for experiencing the longest drive-in beach in India and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I entered the beach from the north side at Edakkad and drove the full length of the beach before exiting at Dharmadom bridge. The entry fee for a car was Rs.30 (as on Sep 2016). The sunset at the beach was beautiful and a sight to behold.
121,The must-visit place in Kannur..,We had a nice time here driving at beach. There are very less beaches in india where things are not commercialized yet. This beach is one of them. My kids also enjoyed the quality time here. You can drive along the beach having icecream. Look wise this place is awesome. A must visit if you are at Kannur.
122,Cool experience ,"It was great fun driving down this beach. Atleast 3km long, you can splash along the sea waves while you are driving watching so many birds. Just be careful not to stop your car for more than 2-3 mins at one spot as the receding water will move the sand & you may get stuck."
123,Drive-in Beach experience.,Best & only drive in beach. Awesome time spent. You can walk the entire stretch. Its neat & clean beach. Night walk is bit scary but worth riding. Few beach house stay available for cheap (i paid 300/ night). Great food.
124,Good spot for an evening drive by the sea,One can drive in a beach and great experience too. Its a long 4.5 kms and  clean beach area. Even one can learn driving with different feel
125,Nice Drive,Variety experience. Only drive in beach of Kerala. Vehicle rent facility is not available. Need your own vehicle.
126,Right next to Highway,Lovely driving beach. Good views. Shallow beach.Worth a look and a visit. You can take a Tuk Tuk ride along the beach.
127,Nice one,"This is true fun for cars and bikes. Just drive along side the long sea beach. The sand is pretty firm, cars wont sink unless you go in water.Spend at least an hour here, and also drive carefully."
128,It's a Big Drive beach,The beach was visited many times by me. The beach is simply awesome. The drive in is the unique point. You can drive through the beach in a vehicle. A must try
129,Very Interesting Place To Visit,Best place to visit during early hours...and you can enjoy beach driving :)Easily accessible via road and train...and you get evening snacks from nearby thatkada too...(eatery)I will give it 5 star
130,Pre wedding shoot ,This is a drive in beach and one must experience driving in beach having waves hitting on your vehicle 😁 This beach is a gift of God’s own country to tourists . This beach will give you an excellent experience and one must feel it .
131,An experience to remember,Very good and clean beach. You can play for hours and still want to play more. Beach does not have any refreshments and toilets.
132,Muzhappilangad Drive-in Beach,Well maintained clean beach even though hundreds of vehicles drive on this every day.The water also clean for a dive in or beach play.
133,Good place for an early morning or evening beach drive,An excellent and rare experience of driving on beach the beachThis is also an clean beach to get wet.The best place to visit in kannur
134,Amazing exp,"If you are driving to Kannur do not miss this place. It's an experience that you'll cherish for a long time. The best time to visit the beach is during morning or evening if you want to enjoy both the sunrise/sunset and driving. The sand in the beach here is almost as hard as concrete which allows you to drive. You can drive for about 5-6 kms along the stretch with fresh sea breeze hitting your face and company to you along your drive. The beach is usually crowded with children and adults alike most of them playing so drive very slowly and carefully. Caution: Do not try to drive at night, you may not realize and drive into the sea. Also the roads leading to and from the beach are very narrow and navigating them becomes a challenge. Before you enter the beach for a drive, do get out of your car to check whether it's safe to drive. If the sea is rough it may be closed (it happened to me once)."
135,Its a Wonderfull experience to have a-drive in muzupilangadu beachThe one and only drive in beach in kerala.... ,good driving experience.....enjoyed here...must visit as only place in kannur worth going....olz do carry ur eatables drinks...nothing much available on beach...... Drive in sea waves....😁😁
136,A non utilized Beach,Driving in the beach is an exhilarating experience . Best time to visit is in the evening as u can have a perfect sun setting in the Arabian Sea
137,Wow...Amazing...!!!,"I drove from Bangalore, heard about this beach from our resort manager. This is one of its kind of beach, really enjoyed driving.  It was a great experience a must visit place in Kannur. Just be a bit alert and use only drive-in path to drive (don't drive too close to the water and to the extreme right where sand is un-even) to avoid Tyre getting entrapped in sand. Good place for seafood lovers to get direct supply from fishermen."
138,Drive through the heart off the beach....,Almost 3.5 Km fantastic drive through with minimum speed control. all time police patrolling for safe ride and beach hosts for clean and safe guards for any help.
139,Good,Nice place to take your car on a spin. Long stretch almost around 4 to 5 kms. This beach is between Kannur and Thalasery. It was first time for us to drive around on a beach shore. Lots of cars and people enjoying driving their cars. Nice location for photography enthusiasts.  Can spend all evening there. Shacks serving small eats and drinks. Well maintained beach. There is also an  entry fee to get into the beach.
140,One-of-a-kind experience,This is a awesome place where you can literally drive your car through the beach and kissing the sea waves breaking on the beach. Awesome place for photography enthusiasts and driving maniacs. Must visit place if going to Kannur and may give other places a miss for an experience here.
141,Must go place for Car Lovers !!,"Bored of roads... Now time to drive on waterMost beautiful driving beach in Kerala, don't stop your vehicles in water more than 2 min, after 2nd min you will not able to drive your vehicle without other's help!!!"
142,Drive in beach,"It's a good Drive-in Beach and can​ be enjoyable for friends, family in all age groups. Having such a great natural resources it has not been promoted or have a great facilities. It can be developed to international standards but still a great Beach for drive-in, which is top of the world feeling.."
143,activity,"A good experience, both as a beach and drive-in beach. people drive up to there to enjoy the scenic beauty and the beautiful Sunset. A must Visit in Kannur"
144,Fabulous experience,Awesome this is d only beach in India were u can drive vehicles on beach.morning or evening is d best time to visit
145,Drive in beach ,"If you are travelling to thalassery by car,Dont think again to go to drive in beach because you wont get another place like this in kerala. No doubt you will enjoy the beach drive."
146,It was so much fun driving on the beach,"Awesome experience to drive in a beach. The beach long ~ 3Km. Relaxing beach, visit early in the morning for a relaxed time. Evening get crowded."
147,Excellent experience,Awesome place to with family to stay away from city life Thank you Mr Rajish for making our trip so memorable
148,New Experience,Great beach where you can drive in the water. Not much of shops or beer or coconut except one. But nice beach
149,Excellent drive in beach ... the only one in india,"Nice drive, with water hitting your car wheels. It is around 2 kms drive. It is a must visit if you are visiting a place nearby Kannur."
150,India's longest drive in beach,The only beach to take your car/two wheeler right across the beach area for a titillating drive amongst the waves. The sand is super thick and it does not soften except close to the sea. Remember to wash the car/motorbike to avoid salt water corrosion. The beach is close to 4kms and tends to get crowded during weekends.
151,Family vacation in drive In Beach,"You can enter this drive-in beach from 2-3 entry points. Each point has a ticket collector, yes, this is paid beach for the car - Rs. 30 is the nominal charge per vehicle.Almost 1 km + of beach to drive in. The ticket collector's do warn you not to drive close to the water - to avoid getting struck. Infact, sea water is not very good for your car's underbody too.We drove on the beach a couple of times, mostly on the tracks of the previous drives. Some places has loose sand but the car was able to pull through.Very nice to park the car on the beach and chill out. Being on first experience of a drive-in beach, this is a must do for a motorist."
152,Fun!,"It was first time we went to drive in beach and believe me it was amazing experience.The beach is quite big so one can find quieter place easily, you just have to drive little. It's quite clean beach there are small moving shops to sell few things on the beach.We were aware that salt water damages the car but still how can one hold themselves w/o driving and splashing water all over. It was fun.There is some entry fee which is very nominal. When we were there is was not crowded but seen reviews which says it gets crowded on holidays so plan accordingly.Overall it was  great experience and everyone should visit this beach and have experience at least once."
153,bad taste,"Perfect time to visit this beach would be early evening.. It is a Drive-in beach.. you can take your car/bike right on the beach and have some fun in the water(salt water corrodes the metal body of the car.. if you are having a splash, make sure you get the car water-washed later on).. we experience a beautiful sunset while we drove the car around..there are a couple of out outlets where you can get some refreshments..Will surely recommend this place.."
154,Drive in beach,This is a awesome beach for a ride.we have like it so much.This place gives a good sunset and sunrise view. It's a must see location.
155,Kerala's One & Only Drive-In Beach .. Must Visit Place,Only ride in beach that I am aware of in South India. It is as easy to ride a two wheeler as a four wheeler. Early morning rides will be a good experience. You can witness the fishermen getting their catch of the day.
156,Good beach,beach is good almost not polluted ...tourist visiting please make sure to maintain cleanness to help authorities to continue the same
157,Exhilarating experience,It was fun driving in the beach. The beach is very safe for swimming. Even kids can swim freely. Waves were very gentle.
158,Awesome experience... never had before experience ,I guess this is the only Drive in Beach in Asia. I am sure that you will get a different experience by driving through this beach. Only problem is very narrow roads.
159,Great experience...drive in beach,"A Great visited in the morning. Best place to people who have affinity towards beach and driving both at same time. One of the ideal places to visit, if u plan a trip to Kannur Kerala. Driving a car with the view of beach and the breeze from the sea waves will push you to the cloud nine.Without a vehicle you can't enjoy much in this place and a best place to snap some awesome pics and capture video while you drift in the car at sea shore. Enjoyed very fresh time."
160,Had a good time,I really enjoyed the drive in beach  it's a beautiful experience . More than 6 times I visited the place . Very neat and clean in the beach side  every one just one time visit Muzhappilangad......
161,Excellent beach for driving and playing,"Nice beach, drive is an experience , very memorable, car wheels wade through water smoothly for almost one km."
162,Drive in Beach in Kannur,"It is a wonderful experience to drive in the beach with the waves almost touching your car windows. Drive the whole strech. It is well maintained, clean with toilet facilities. You can also rent bikes to drive in the beach. Beach is also ideal for playing."
163,Superb beach,This is one of undiscovered treasure tourist place.We enjoyed a lot. Driving was fun. Beach is full of Shells.Kids can collect those. Not crowded or dirty at all.
164,A Crescent protected by giant black rocks,"Morning 5 to 8 is the best time where you can enjoy driving through the complete stretch of the beach peacefully,not much crowded during this time.You can see fisherman catching the shore  line fishes."
165,DRIVE IN BEACH,"You can take your vehicle on the beach.Go at sunset/sunrise, you would enjoy much. Must go beach if you are heading for kannur."
166,"Must visit, first beach where you can take your car.","The Beach is nice and the beauty is that you can drive in , there are some vendors selling ice creams and other stuff, will be lovely to drive in evening, the length of the beach is quite a lot"
167,Beautiful,This is the best driving beach which i ever visited. Stunting cars and bikes are unforgettable experience. Really a beautiful place.
168,Good drive in beach poorly maintained,I think the only drive in beach in kerala. Used to see lot of people driving there. Suggesting.........
169,Awesome beach,Very good drive in beach. Longest drive in beach in the country. But very poorly maintained. Even good rest rooms are not available. No good eating places or entertainment centred for children.
170,Driving beautiful beach ,Good drive in beach and excellent place to relax. be careful when your walk on the beach .. there will be vehicle moving all across the beach. good place to watch sunset. approaching roads to this beach are narrow.
171,Beautiful drive-in beach ,"It's a very long flat stretch of sand making it ideal drive-in beach. Sand is firm and not as white as the other kannur Beaches. Not ideal for swimming as I found other beaches in kannur better.Like other beaches in kannur, there are no option for food apart from occasional ice cream trolley.Beyond the iron sickle and hammer sculpture, the beach is less crowded.Make sure you drive on firm sand else Tyre may get stuck in the sand.You may get a chance to see a fisherman coming from the sea with his catch.One can easily spend couple of hours in the beach."
172,Drive in Beach,This is one beach where you can drive your car without any fear though you may find it scary at first glance to see water reaching shores & you driving the car along the shores. The sand is thick & car doesn't sunk. Only advise is don't take car in the water as it may cause corrosion of metal parts of car (if contacted).
173,Beautiful drive on the beach !!!,We are enjoyed more than compared with other beach.Because on there make a ride with car.The best of the beach in kerala.It's a only beach for make a ride i know.
174,A long drive in Beach,Good place for a drive and relaxing. Not much amenities nearby. But the views are amazing. You have to reach during low tides for a complete drive through the beach. Beach is really clean and tidy.
175,Exploration mode on...,This was my first experience at a drive in beach. Beach is clean and neat and not very shallow so you can walk quite a bit inside
176,Longest drive in beach in Kerala,Had a great time. Rs 30 will be charged per car for entry. Seeing the sun set on a beach driving my car was an experience I'll never forget. Unique in every way!!
177,Amazing experience driving on the beach,The beach soil is so hard that you can drive your car or two wheeler on beach. When we visited (in the afternoon) the beach was deserted and we had nice time there. There were no shops when we visited this beach. so take enough water bottles and eatables when you go there. Also we had difficulty reaching the beach. We hired two autos and went to beach. We asked the auto drivers to wait to take back us to the hotel as we did not find any autos or other private transport near the beach. Apart for the commutation and drinking water issues it is a nice scenic place to enjoy.
178,Badly maintained beach,"As the name says, the uniqueness is that you can drive on this beach.  3+ km - long enough to enjoy the drive and take a few pics (of course).  It is a clean beach too.  Worth visiting if you are in the area."
179,One of the best drive by beaches,"Extremely clean as compared to other places, shallow water with a gentle slope and easy to find less crowded spots thanks to it's huge expanse (6.5 km long). You can drive the car almost upto the water, but be careful as we saw many cars stuck in sand as they went too close to the water. We were able to take our grandmas with limited mobility right to the water, something which would have been difficult at any other beach!The water is quite clear, and please maintain the beauty of the beach and avoid littering. Must visit at kannur."
180,A long  beach with heavy traffic!!,This was one of the first and best experience to drive on a driving beach. The water is better and clean from rest of the places like I have visited. Overall a must visit place!!
181,Pristine and Secluded Beach,"This is so amazing, drive through the beach during the sunset, such a wonderful experience.There is places to take rest, to have some snacks and enjoy a weekend evening you wont get disappointed."
182,Good for an evening visit,Travelled solo. By the help of surya residency nadal staff could get a bike. The drive was awesome Absolute bliss
183,Must watch in north kerala,"Lovely stretch of beach open to the public to drive. You can expect all sorts of vehicles on the beach. Try not to get too close to the water lest you get stuck in the sand. This beach is well patrolled by the police and they were very active in ensuring people don't drive too fast . But then there is always an errant tourist so watch out for sudden oncoming vehicles and an occasional walker. Overall a very enjoyable beach and yes, don't forget to give your vehicle a good sweet water wash the same evening !"
184,Just Awesome to drive in beach,only drive in beach n Kerala... nice to visit ... i dont know about western tourist will like the place. because they like to take bath in see and sun bath...... This is not the see for them...........but when you are in Kannur visiting will the beach will not be a bad experience.
185,Just unfolded another wonder nature offers..,"A nice and rare beach for those who love driving. But... The beach and surroundings are not well maintained by Kerala Tourism Department. So facilities of even urinal are not provided. Not even a shelter to sit with family. And the most unlucky part is Kerala Police will fine you Rs 2000/- if you drive in this driving beach having the tyre of vehicle touched in sea water. No where in beach you can see an Alert board denying driving in beach. But still Police will fine you, that too Rs 2000."
186,India's Only Drive in Beach,"Just unfolded another wonder nature offers by driving through the entire stretch of the beach. You can really drive so close to the sea water watching waves real close from your car. But one needs to be careful not to get the car over the sea water as the sea water is highly corrosive. In case if you do, make sure you get a proper wash just after the drive. Found fishing boats fish bring fresh stock frequently and squad on the beach jump into action by bi-forgetting fish/ crabs, which will be sold on spot.Beach is clean, but expect nothing else. No fine dine options, no hot/cold beverages available, and what is available is not hygene."
187,Awesomeness,Excellent drive in beach. Beautiful view. And it's the longest stretch ever seen worth a view once.It's quite dangerous to park cars though. As the water keeps rising
188,Don't miss this if you're in Kannur,Long drive in beach. Very clean. Nice driving spaces. Can enjoy with kids and family. Awesome climate. want to visit again and again
189,Nice ride on the Beach,It was really a drive-in beach. The local people collect some toll to take the vehicles onto the beach for a drive along the waters. Can see many local fishermen on the beach.
190,Amaze your self by enjoy a drive at This Beah,"Beautiful sands, and views , not crowded . Early morning or evenings are the best times to visit . Cars and bikes used to be allowed on the beach, I think it has been stopped now."
191,Best drive in beach in India,Treat to the eyes. Simply awesome beauty with clean beaches. Patterns made by crab on the mud is fantastic
192,Nice beach,"An out of the world experience with a long stretch to drive freely, Has a Hard sand hence its easy for vehicles to be driven along the complete stretch without the fear of getting struck. No snacks are sold on this beach hence its best to carry your own or pick it up before entering."
193,AWESOME DRIVING BEACH,A wide drive on beach which gave us a beautiful view of a rocky island parting the sea and a beautiful sunset.
194,Best of all,The drive-in Beach was beautiful. It was amazing to drive right next to the ocean. It is a must for everyone who visits Kannur.
195,Enjoyed driving in the drive in beach. I was told that it is somewhere between 3.5 to 4kms long beach.,For a wonderful drive in experience through beach. Long Beach not much crowded and clean. Friendly people.
196,Very Nice and Clean Beach,One of the best beach seen ever. You can drive in beach. Eyeful watch of sea. Due to rain we couldnt spend much time. But worth to go.
197,Best  Drive in beach...........,Safe beach. Loved the drive in. The waves are not rough. It was just right for my 5 year old kid to play safe. The entry ticket is Rs. 30 for the entire day. You can be around this beach until late in the night. It is quite safe. Booked a hotel room right in front of this beach. Palm Resort. The owner was very very hospitable.
198,A very beautiful and clean beach.,I had read about this beach on trip advisor and so decided to visit it.I would strongly suggest to visit  this beach.You can drive your  vehicles comfortably on the beach without  any problem.The below photos can be viewed for reference.If you are in kannur you must visit this place.
199,Heavenly drive-in beach. ,"Wonderful experience driving on beach and ocean water touching your car tyres, there was river which was joining the ocean too on both extreme."
200,Natures wonder!! alas with wrong people to manage,This beach is very long and we rebted a car so that we could drive through the beach it was very delightful experience. We went on a Sunday so there was rush but still because its a long beach we had pur own place to play in the water
201,Go for Drive-in Beach experience,"Simple put, dream of drag racing came true. Couple of km beach where you can drive. Do have tuck shops available for refreshments. Must go."
202,WagonR drive was terrific,Have seen this place in many films and watched with surprise that films stars drove jeep/car through sea.  I had been there with friends in an SUV and drove through the beach . It was such a good experience and we had enjoyed a lot.
203,Beach drive ,Ideal place for a nice drive. The sea & waves are calm. Spent a nice relaxed day here ... Fun to drive the car on the beach
204,A beautiful drive in beach,The is an impressive stretch of a well maintained beach. Good for a walk or jog. Even more fantastic and thrilling is the drive on the beach.
205,Unique...,Beautiful and serene place. Ideal for a holiday away from the crowd. Lot of homestays at low rates. Enjoyed with family.
206,Great drive-in beach but beware of where you park,"Had read about this place in a travellogue in xbhp. So during Diwali 2016, went there with my wife on our Ninja 650. Its a once in a limetime experince. The bike cutting through the ocean water.... Priceless experince.Overall beach is very clean."
207,Drive in,"very clean and nice beach. not crowded and not touristy, so good for just hanging with friends, family. :)"
208,One of a kind experience,Must drive on the few kilometres beach in your car with beautiful sunset at the background.  Reasonable charge for it.
209,Great place,"I went here in monsoon season, if you are planning to go there go in September to April this is best to visit, I enjoyed here lot only they ll allowe after 5pm, you can drift very long sand, avoid to park vehicle on sand it's can sunk, don't follow the Google map it's show very narrow road, there are many way to come here get help from local."
210,Great fun,"I went with my friends on a car and I must say it was worth visiting on personal car. Beautiful beach and fantastic views at time of sunrise and sunset. You can go there any time of the day. Best part was self drive. Beach is long and it’s clean. People can enjoy sea, play, take pics. There is a connecting small island nearby which you can go by walking but only at time of low tides. Kannur is a must go place. You can spend weekend 2 days over there. There are other beaches as well here. Plus Dharmadam island, a light house/ museum, etc places."
211,Only One Drive In Beach in India,"A vast 100 Mtr+ beach stretch from shore to sea, great experience driving from one end to the other."
212,Fantastic beach,"my first ever experience of a driving Beach,,in south India a place not to be missed, cool experience"
213,Went to see what all the fuss is about,drive upto the water in your vehicle. drive along the waves on a 4 km  stretch of the beach. nice clean beach. safe for swimmers. a must see on your itinerary while visiting kannur
214,Good drive on a beach... ,The Driving beach once you reach the Beach you are surprised We are enjoyed Drive and playing most u want playHow to reach From Thalassery to Kannur Road near the Highway just 400 meter onlyEnjoy..
215,Amazing experience,"One of the few beaches in the world where one can take their vehicle onto the beach without fear of getting bogged down in the sand and drive along the shore with the waves lapping at ur tires. An enormous expanse of sand to drive along, it's definitely worth the experience."
216,Be careful while you park your vehicle,"It is an experience everyone should try, driving on the beach is so much fun, I recommend to go there around the sunset. It's fabulous. The water is safe for young children. It's shallow and the waves are mild."
217,Worth a visit,"Not a place where you can swim or catch waves, but certainly the spot to take your car out for a spin. Although mainly locals, this is a once in a lifetime experience where you feel like you are in a car commercial. It’s safe, fun for photos and you get to see the local youngsters taking their motorbikes & cars for a fun outing."
218,Unique Experience,"One and only drive in beach in Asia, must visit, almost 4 kilometers distance to drive through beach but make sure that u washed your car after surfing."
219,Pleasant beach ,Very clean beach... took my car and drove down it is a nice cinematic feeling driving in the beach... there was a small stream of water (pure) flowing into the sea at the end ... was pleasantly surprised to see such a thing in India. It is must to visit place... you can take football and play in the water... there are bikes which you take a ride... if you visit in the evening you can witness beautiful sunset. This was the most memorable place we say during this visit to Mahe
220,Very nice and refreshing,This beach is something that you should experience driving. We went on two evenings and stayed there until dark. Very clean and you have some shacks for snacks along the beach. Screw pine bushes (Thazhampoo) are maintained along the beach with other shrubs making it a natural protection. We could sight couple of jackals wandering in the night (around 8 pm) to feed on the crabs/fish. A must visit
221,drive in beach.,Probably the best place to drive you vehicle on the beach as you fine a long drive in beach here but make sure you service you care after the drive (salty water...)
222,Best beach for Family with kids,It's one the best beaches to drive in.BBC had recently voted it as the third best in the world.Its relatively a flat beach excellent for driving with all sorts of vehicles however with a speed restriction...Evenings are the best time to admire the beach with the sunset over the horizon..It gets crowded at times but still worth a visit.
223,Super,"I have visited many beaches, but this one stands apart. One of its kind, where you can just drive into the beach. Just be careful not to drive into loose sand, or the vehicle might get stuck."
224,A great drive on the long beach.,I visited early morning for a drive on the beach. It's a delightful experience driving along the beach. In fact I drove very close to the water. Locals will ask you to stay away from water but I didn't paid much attention.
225,Amazing beach with very gentle waves.,We went with another friend and it's awesome.Beach is very clean and tidy.The whole family enjoyed it.
226,Drive in Beach - Unique,Nice experience to drive on the beach. First time I did it. Beach is drivable and people provide directions easily.
227,Too good,"Great experience, preferably go in evening to avoid the sun. Great sights and views while driving on the beach. A surreal experience."
228,A very calm and nice place..,The sand is probably on the harder side and that allows you to drive vehicles over it.The beach is long and has rock formations which make it less barren.
229,Superb experience,"Just about a km is this Drive-In beach, Pay about 30 bucks to enter the beach area, and you get on for hard sand beach lane for about 3km stretch. you will find lot of people playing football and cricket throughout this lane"
230,Super experience ,After wasting my time in mahé I got to know about this beach. And it’s the most amazing thing to do in and around mahé. The driveway drives u crazy.. it’s clean and awesome.. A must visit..
231,Awesome place,"It was an amazing experience to drive car on the beach. visited twice, once in the evening, it was crowded at that point of time, fishermen were busy with their work, got to see many diff fishes, crabs, star fish etc. Next day again visited in the morning and found the beach relatively less crowded, had more fun thn, Sad part was people throwing garbage on the beach, requested them not to do so, but..."
232,A Good beach to walk around ,"Well maintained beach, the sand is hardened it seems as in night water comes up and recedes in day time thus allowing cars to drive. We saw many people driving, some standing through their sun roof, overall a great atmosphere with icecream shops around. But access road is very narrow, we entered from post office road. They charge 40 Rs (around half an US dollar) for taking car inside, it’s displayed there."
233,The beach is beautiful !!,Amazing place ... Sound is black and hard .. we can drive for 3 kms on the shore Best time to visit is evenings before sunset awesome experience
234,Best. Drives Beach ,Went twice in bike and had a beach long ride.. The floor is so hard that you can easily drive through it. A must visit for any riders..
235,Drive in beach,Enjoyed to visit for almost half day. Very nice beach and please dont miss this one. You can drive your car in this beach but do be careful to maintain the speed limits. You will love the beach and try to be a little early so as to avoid the rush. Seating areas are available if you need any. Please do visit the near by small hotel to have good really tasty snacks. Enjoyed very refreshing time.
236,good for family,out of the world experience of driving on the beach... its quite long beach... very clean and maintained.... carry change of clothes and have a relaxing time
237,Just Kannur things ,"Around INR 50 to enter the beach area for cars at the time I visited. Absolutely amazing experience driving down my car and splashing the waves. Just about the exhilarating experience when you do a desert safari in Dubai, with sand .. Possibly 1-2km long shoreline and you can nearly drive till the end of the beach. Good shoreline, one can walk into the sea for some distance as it's not deep. Watch out for vehicles if you are in the water.Tourist support center like restrooms definitely needs some attention."
238,Unique driving experience. and a nice beach for playing in the water.,We visited around noon and fortunately the whole beach was just to us. Entry fee 30 bucks. Did multiple drives on the water back and forth. Make sure your car windows are rolled up! :)
239,The best Drive-in beach in India,I am surprised to see how you could drive the car very close to the sea in fact you can drive through the waves. I avoided driving through the waves to prevent rusting in the car. You can drive for 3 to 4 kms along the shore & enjoy the amazing views of the sea.
240,Sometime alone with family away from city life,January 2nd week we and my daughter and husband just married visited to this beach every time this week is feeling a new atmosphere is there a Kerala government to develop a beach like Miami thank you
241,good beach for its kind,"This is one of those rare beaches where you can take your car for a spin. A word of caution is not to venture too deep into water, you can get stuck in sand with a water logged car and a water logged ego!!!."
242,Great -Enjoyable Experience,"I had read about the beach on web and saw some pictures but real experience was way more amazing. Its one of its kind of experience that you are driving on the beach, a long stretch of 3-4  KM along the waves. The best part was that is is not crowded. Govt should really take measures to advertise it globally."
243,Good Drive in Beach ,"Different experience to drive on a beach, not seen anywhere else. Beach is average otherwise but must go if are nearby..."
244,Drive -in beach,Thrill of driving on the beach. Such gentle waves lapping at your feet. Lots of shells. People were even digging for live oysters!! Very nice to go around 3p.m to 6p.m.
245,One and only drive in beach in Kerala,Good for a special drive along the beach. Just be careful not to disturb the fishermen there. Go to the end of the beach to experience the rocky beach and the fishermen busy with their business. Keep the place clean when you visit friends...
246,One of its kind,Road track on the beach. Racing cars frightening the birds and poluting an already fragile environment. This is quite scandalous.
247,An amazing driving beach.,"I have been to Kerala nth time and never knew about this. Apparently famous within the locals, but not yet touristy. This is lovely drive in Beach and very clean. Entry to the beach is a nominal fee. Enjoy end to end beach drive. One end of the beach also has the famous CPI M symbol on the rocks towards the sea!! It can happen only in Kerala :D"
248,Dream come true,"I read a lot of reviews of this place and I was a little skeptical about driving on a beach because some review has mentioned that their car got stuck. When I went there on the beach then I was relieved because sand is well settled and there is no chance to get stuck unless you really go into sea. Beach is not that good, it's little muddy but good place to drive slowly and photography."
249,"Relax, Relax and Relax !!!","Enjoyed the sunset drive on the beach and water with water splashing all over us, amazing experience"
250,waterfront drive,"Its like basically a path through hell to reach the paradise. The narrow worn out road leads you this hidden excellence, short yet covered in serenity.Best part, it is not overcrowded (don't know about weekends). The waves crushing through the tires while it skids (Sarcasm) but the view is mesmerizing and unpolluted.Cons: Takes good 30 minutes to reach from the main road as the road is narrow and undergoes both way traffic in single lane. Traffic jams are horrible."
251,Amazing ...,"What's better than driving on beach? I had an amazing drive . Visited last week in the scorching heat. That was the only mistake. So , drove on the beach mornings and evenings when it was cooler. Late night walks on the shore a must . Watch out for foxs , plenty of them evening onwards . You can even buy fish from the fishermen. Saw a Lot of locals drive to the shore and buy fish . Early morning dip in the ocean a must!"
252,awesome beach!,Nice place to hangout with familyBut needs some infrastructure improvement for safety concerns and families needsexample neat toiletssecurity Good lighting
253,Best Place in Kannur,Go for a drive-in experience.A cool place to visit.. It's not much crowded. A drive & Sunset view can be an awesome combination!
254,Enjoyed the Drive,"Great place to warm up. Long beach good to walk and drive. Old city, slight delay in peak time. Must visit"
255,Beach drive,We really loved the experience of getting to drive right at the beach. We intentionally decided to visit in the afternoon to avoid crowd and it was a good decision. Hardly 5-6 cars were there and we loved to drive our car there. Please follow the rules - do not drive faster than 20-25 km/hr and avoid going into the water (as advised by the authorities).
256,Interesting place to drive,"A hard sand beach which allows your car to roll on the sand effortlessly. U wont feel like coming out of the beach. Just co tinue to drive, drive and drive by the beach.   A very happening beach with a lot of vehicles always on the beach"
257,Nice drive on the beach,Been there for car driving practice.Perfect for solo drive along the waves.Don't eat local eatables around the beach as it is not hygienic.Bring your own water bottle too.
258,A nightmare beach,"Drive in theaters were famous in the 80's, but drive in beach, I hadn't heard of. A visit to Muzhappilangad drive-in beach near Kannur was a pleasant surprise and whole lot of excitement. Off the highway connecting Kannur to Thallasery, there are multiple sign boards leading up to this beach. Once you veer of the highway, narrow country roads lead you to the beach. There is a small entry fee of Rs.30  per vehicle. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the driveable stretch. About 2-3kms long, the white sand beach offers an incredible drive along the waters. Cool breeze blowing, water splashing all around your car, the drive is a memorable one. You will definitely be tempted to zoom along, but beware of the speed limit; 20kmph enforced more for safety. Spend an hour or two here, enjoy the drive and cool breeze and gobble up ice creams from the mobile cart. Must do thing!"
259,Only driving beach ,This sand is different. How can you drive .. on a beach.Just drove across the length of the beach .. roughly about 1.5kms one way.
260,Got bored driving on the road?? Explore  Muzhappilangad  Drive in beach,Must visit if you are in Kannur. Heard about this place long back but didnt get a chance to visit. Driving though the beach is really a unique experience. We visited around 1pm hence there was no crowd and we could drive peacefully. :)
261,Awesome drive in beach,the route to the beach is narrow and twisty but the short drive is worth it. I love this place. Please do something to promote this place please !!!!!!
262,Nice Beach,"This was the first time we drove on a beach, it was so much fun... you can drive on the 4 km stretch.... lovely place."
263,Ride on the beach is super fun,It was a different experience altogether driving on the beach! Evening is the best time. Beware of the rash drivers and do not go too close to the sea.
264,Only drive in beach in Kerala,Had never driven on the beach before till I went to this beach. Different experience.The crowd was less even on Christmas break. Nice sunset .
265,Will come back to enjoy the clean water.,Visit in the mornings when there is less crowd and tides are not so high. Walk over the beach/drive or just sit and relax.
266,Beautiful,"Nice place, but we could not drive and tide was high but enjoyed the beauty of surrounding. Make sure you carry water and food with you as nothing available on beach."
267,Amazing stretch of unspoilt beach,"It is quite thrilling to drive on the beach , try to go in a afternoon when the crowd id less.Not many eateries on this beach.The beach is only good for driving  but is bit dirty otherwise."
268,Excellent!,Beautiful place... Awesome view of the ocean... Gud tides... Note tat driving is nit allowed during June and July... So we actually missed driving on the beach... Nothng much in terms of food...
269,🌊 seaway 😜,We took our motorcycles on the beach and had loads of fun riding it in the sand. The sunset is beautiful. It's a very clean beach with cooperative tourists. Everyone has fun by being careful about others' presence. Weekdays are preferable. You have to pay Rs.10 as the entry fee…
270,best experience ever,"It's literally a drive - in beach....OMG...just drive into the beach...It's a shallow beach, very calm. No much tourists also. There are fishermen who catch fresh fishes and sell them on the shores.If you are in Kannur please don't miss this opportunity. It's a must visit place...the beauty of this beach can only be experienced.Loved this place...Highly recommend"
271,Magnificent experience!,"very nice and clean place  am every year going with my family....don""t miss this place its very long drive in beach ..its realy  beautiful   ,local people are very helpful , its best think is ..definitely you not  see any plastic or other wastage  in this beach"
272,Superb ride nxt to beach 🌊 ,It was a nice experience with my friends for a weekend. The beach made our day. All can enjoy. Highly recommended to all type of visitors
273,It's our best trip,Just do it and don’t forget washing your car after Experience it to believe it is different can’t explain in world much
274,Excellent Drive-In Beach,We had gone here for pre-wedding photoshoot. Its was appropriate for shoot has it was not crowded. Driving our car in beach was superb.
275,Largest drive in beach of asia,Surely worth two hours in the evening. Take an SUV if you have one. Clean beach. We enjoyed a lot here.
276,Crazy car driving experience through sea,"Second time I am driving this beach,couple of years ago  visited with my friends  and this time with family It was a great experience"
277,Fun to drive in ,"You may not believe that you can drive your own car in a beach, splashing sea water on both sides, as if you are driving on a water-logged road.   Yes, it is in our own country; not in US or Australia.   A few days ago, I was lucky enough to have this rare experience, which was unimaginable to me and my family till then.   This is not a fairy tale.   You can also experience the same, if you go to Muzhappilangad Beach at Edakkad, near Kannur in Kerala.   You can see lots of vehicles plying on the beach, partly in water and partly on wet sand of the beach."
278,Driveable beach,"It was nice experience for my family, as they have not experienced before. The beach was clean. It should have more vendors"
279,life time experience,"very good experience to drive along, with the waves on one side. good adventure. make sure you do not venture more towards sea to get your vehicle stuck."
280,Must do - Best experience,Less crowded than what i expected so really enjoyed the drive. Make sure to go there early in the morning or late evening.
281,Special Drive. Must visit place in Kannur.,"Because why wouldn’t you hoon on the beach in a tuktuk?! We enjoyed a jolly spin on the beach and played dodge the cars driving through the breaking waves, watched the learner drivers and the cool dudes burying the back wheels of their motorbikes. A tuktuk ice cream man cruises the beach for your convenience too."
282,There is a reason its named the best drive in beach in Asia,"Where else will you have the pleasure of driving your vehicle on a beach? As long as you are careful, the drive is a breeze and hence it is no wonder that this has been rated among the top 6 driving beaches in the world."
283,Good experience must visit,"This was a different experience for us, never having driven a car along a beach.Be sure to go there before sunset and spend 1-2 hours there.. just enjoying a walk or a drive!"
284,DRIVE IN BEACH,"Kerala is known as God's own country for some unknown reasons. Everything related to God is given an holy status.. But after visiting this so called only Drive-in beach of Muzhappilangad, one would feel whether people of Kerala regard GOD as master of all dirty, unclean, umhygeinic things.This beach is dirtied by the visiters as well as locals who drive their cars in crazily speeds and destroy the beautiful sandy beach and its eco-system.There are no toilets, or change or showers near the beach. Result locals visiting the beach relieve themselves on the beach itself may be GOD only knows they want to please their Gods. In fact travelling across length and breadth of Kerala one will not find public toilets even in big cities, forget about beaches and hill stations. So it is only routine practice of locals and traveller to relieve in public places thus the major cause for dirtying and polluting this beautiful state."
285,Mans,Enjoyable...!!👌👌👍🏖 ride ur vehicle 🚗 in d water 💦 super drifting on sand....!!! Burning tyres.....!!💨 going crazy 😜 wid frnds...!!!!
286,The Best Drive in Beach I have ever visited,"Everyone kept asking if we had been to the beach so we went. The novelty is that for a small fee, you can drive your car or motorcycle along a few kilometers of packed sand.  Not the prettiest beach, and nothing there except for a few ice cream vendors, but we drove our scooter to the opposite end and took some photos.  Have seen more beautiful beaches."
287,Awesome beach!,* It will be a different experience driving on the beach with the waves hitting the shore a few meters away.   * Entry fee has to be paid to enter the beach with the vehicle.  * The drive path is almost 4 km long.  * The statue of the Communist logo at one end of the beach is a…
288,Awesome Experience in this drive in beach,We were a bunch of friends who went there for a drive. It was a superb experience as usual. The tide was low and we drove across the lengths and breadths of the beach. The beach was not crowded and we had our space. Most of them in the group were going there for the very first time and they loved it too. Over all its definite must do when in Kannur.
289,Interesting place for a short drive,"we are always found of traveling,eating new food,exploring something new...all can be come under one place it is something extra ordinary..and makes more happy and relaxed it is something related...."
290,"nice & beautiful drive in beach, gem of south india","Post lunch our hosts took us for a drive on the beach..a new experience for us..loved it.. however would recommend that one does it early mornings or late evening as it's too warm in the afternoon..my fellow travellers, kindly do not litter the place"
291,Probably the only drive-in beach in South,If you are passing by or in the area definitely worth the detour..I went there around 11 30 am so there were very few people there..but too hot at that time.. evening would be better
292,Mrs,Astonishing beach! It took 9 minutes to drive from one end to our turning...but not the end of the beach. Good fun.
293,An ecosport in Muzhappilangad,how can people be so incredibly silly to regard it as a great idea to drive up and down a beach honking and showing off their silly haircuts? there are plenty of roads to choose from. no need to ruin what would be a peaceful location. there arent many left in our country
294,The Only Driving Beach in South Asia!,Best time is to visit in the evenings..otherwise u can't sit n relax anywhere... This place isn't good to   get into the sea. U can only enjoy driving along the shore and nothing else!
295,Why do you search for another.....,"Tides are good to play (was there on a full-moon day). Little crowded on weekends. Don't drive too much in the water, I saw some cars got into s/w problems (due to steering lock, brake lights)"
296,Awesome experience,"This is definitely one of my firsts. Recommended by a friend, he mentioned that I should not miss this. My recommendation is the same for everyone who's reading this review. You can drive parallel to the waves or in other words, waves would be touching the car tyres and you can just splash and dash your car at a good speed."
297,The rare experience of driving your car through sea-water,These are moments you'd reminisce for a long long time. It's mostly crowded in the evenings. Just live the moment.
298,Must visit beach in Kannur,"I generally dont give a 5 star ratting but this no doubt deserve a 5 star ratting . probably because this is the only drive in beach in India and there is no competition against it. You can drive your car in the water it self. just do it to feel it.You can see many alive  star fish and shells at the beach.BUT FEW POINTS YOU MUST TAKE CARE1. Sea water so salty which might damage your car.2. Dont park your car till the place where waves reaches, because once water will come and go it will pull the small sand/mud particle and your wheel will get jammed and you will need people to pull it out and i saw few car suffered with that.3. Dont be over exited like me ;) and drive your car in more water, my car spark plug got damaged and i spent couple of hours at the service centre.The beach maintenance people should post these kind of points there."
299,Awesome drive,A drive-in beach.....need I say more.....the thrill of driving in the waters is something you will never forget
