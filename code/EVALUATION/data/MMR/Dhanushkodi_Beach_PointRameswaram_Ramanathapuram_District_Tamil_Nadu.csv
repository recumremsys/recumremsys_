0,Awesome!!,"Dhanushkodi when translated means ""end of the bow"". The site of confluence of blue and green waters of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal is absolutely breathtaking. It is connected with the original Indian mainland only by the Pamban Railway Bridge.  The place has been reduced to ruins and mystic stories today due to a cyclone in 1964,which had the intensity to destroy the city.On a clear day,you can view the Srilankan coast from here.Though, it is just 18-20 Kms from Rameshwaram,there are no restrooms or hotels here .Though vendors are aplenty selling cool masala cumbers and watermelons. Do carry umbrellas ,sunscreens and drinking water.Loved the shoreline,blue sky and  the confluence of two major seas. In route ,there were quaint and picturesque fishermen Hamlets..They had loads of shops selling some very good stuffmade of shells ."
1,Got shrilled! Gulf of hallucinations.,The Arichal munai beach in Dhanushkodi is the extreme end of land from where the island of Sri Lanka is about 18 kms. The beach is not so impressive but the road to the beach from Rameswaram is very scenic. On one side of the road is Indian Ocean and on the other side is Bay of Bengal. A marked difference in colour can be seen. Indian Ocean is rough while Bay of Bengal is calm.  Travellers can enjoy this scenic journey apart from historical importance.
2,Historical and mythical site,"Dhanushkodi the tip of India where Indian Ocean and Arabian sea merges is the place from Ram Seth bridge was formed has a tearful history behind it.  During 1964 cyclone the entire dhanushkodi was merged under sea.  The  damaged portions of the church, railway station and few more buildings in the elevated place are standing as  memorials for the incident.  As there was no census taken in 5hose days Noone could assess the actual number of deaths but several hundreds of dead bodies floating in the sea proved the death should be more than 1500.For several years reaching the point was difficult due to bad roads but thanks to the central government  who have laid excellent road two years back and you can reach the point in 30 mts drive.  Autos, taxis are available from rameshwaram.  But see to that you go before 4 pm otherwise you will be denied to go near the tip.  Do not miss."
3,Historic Landmark ,"Earlier there were no roads to go to arichamunai, the lands end where three sides are covered by water. The old Danushkodi is like walking back into history. The destroyed buildings of the church, railway station & post office in the 1964 cyclone stand testimony of what happened to this place. To go to Arichamunai previously there werent any roads and you have to either walk or take 4 wheel drive vans or jeeps that were available. Now the govt has laid road till Arichamunai and you can drive down in your own vehicle.The place will amaze you with its scenic beauty. Evening or early morning is the best time to go as it becomes too hot in the mid day. Be careful not to venture into the sea as its dangerous and ppl have lost lives here. Though one side will be calm(known as woman sea) and the other side will be with waves(known as male sea) its better not to go far into the waters. Swimming is now banned.The drive leading to Arichamunai is very beautiful as you dont get to see this kind of landscape anywhere else. The road leading from Rameswaram to Danushkodi is beautiful too. At some places you can get down and walk into the shallow back waters for pictures."
4,MESMERIZING SCENIC VIEWS,"Dhanushkodi Beach is actually at the end of the road which leads to the tip of the land mass beyond which is Adam's Bridge. The beach is a popular tourist spot , however there are no life guards and hence it is advised not to swim in the waters."
5,Nice place to Visit,"This is the tip beyond which Ramsetu starts, which essentially means you start seeing islands that belong to Sri Lanka.The beach is clean, and it's an amazing drive from Rameshwaram with sea on both sides of road.There is an abandoned town here as well, but very commercialized."
6,Dhanushkodi: A must for travel enthusiasts,Dhanuskodi  is the place where the wonders of nature and man become one. This town has a vast stretch of beach is surrounded by Bay of Bengal on one side and Indian Ocean on other side. Amazing place to see
7,No words to express.. really,Who said that the amazing blue waters are there only in Mauritius/ Thailand/Langkawi.. Dhanushkodi is a gem of India.. It is a tip /point where bay of bengal amd indian ocean meet.. Bay of bengal is quiet and u can walk through the waters..the indian ocean is rough and high…
8,Rameshwaram,"A unique windy Beach along the Bay of Bengal situated on the tip of the Pamban/Rameswaram island. This Beach is distinctive because a catastrophic cyclone in 1964 had almost wiped off the surrounding – trails of destruction are evident even today on the way to the Beach. What,…"
9,One of a kind,The end point where Bay of about Bengal and Indian Ocean meet (Confluence) about 27 km from Rameswaram. Open only between 7 am till 5pm.Note the timings.
10,South india Tour,The Dhanushkodi Beach is almost at the lands end. The security here is tight. The beach itself is one can stroll on the sands
11,A long walk to the tip of Dhanushkodi. Entry to vehicles are restricted before 2 Kms.,This is the furthest point on the Island of Rameshwaram and is the closest to Sri Lanka. In British colonial times and for years after independence it was the launching point for the ferry to Talaimannar Pier in Sri Lanka. Thousands of people have travelled through here. The train used to come here daily from Chennai. In Dec 1964 there was a terrible storm or cyclone that devastated this area. The last train was washed away killing 110 people. Thousands perished here. It was a mammoth natural disaster that left this place a ghost town.
12,peaceful,Different place of dhanushkodi two side sea and the sea middle of road. The dhanushkodi beach end of Indian border and big story of this place raman seetha ravan
13,Beauty of the sea!,"Dhanushkodi was destroyed in 1964 by sunami, known as ghost town. But you can see the meeting point of two oceans. The tourism Department should do something to promote the spot belonging to Ramji, the Ramsetu between India & Sri Lanka."
14,"MESMERIZING, Ram sethu",A must visit place and if possible drive from Rameswaram to Dhanushkodi to whiteness the amazing natural beauty!!
15,Just Go for it,Beautiful beach at the tip called Arichal Munai. Serene place with water on three sides. Beach colour was so beautiful bcos of shallow water. Must see.
16,Must Visit,"Splendid view, two oceans meet here. Ram setu n Dhanushkodi are same points. Ram setu is not visible , also you are not allowed to cross after a point at beach. India's last border point."
17,Beautiful,"""Anne kadal"" vs ""penne kadal"" The water body was fascinating. The locals have coined the one side as Anne kadal which is mens/gents sea since the water is calm. Penne kadal is ladies/womens sea since the waters were violent. "
18,Impressive land formation,"Dhanushkodi beach lies on the tip of the Rameshwarm island , where Bay of Bengal merges with Indian Ocean.  Dhanushkodi meaning ‘end of the bow’ is a small town located at the south-east end of  Pamban island in Tamil Nadu. The temple here is described in the Ramayana but currently has nothing but ruins which have been left behind due to the ravages of the sea and time. The boulders around the sea between Sri Lanka and this place known as Adam's bridge, are believed to be used by Hanuman to reach across Sri Lanka. Dhanushkodi was completely destroyed by the cyclones of 1964. Kodandarama  Swamy temple is  the only salvage of the cyclone. Idols of Rama, Sita , Lakshmana, Hanuman and  Vibhishana ( brother of Ravana)  are available  here .The Government declared the town as Ghost town and unfit for living after the storm. It is advisable to go during day time to the village and return to Rameshwaram before sunset as the entire 18 km stretch is said to be dangerous. Here you  get an amazing Sun rise & Sun Set views , but entry to this point is banned from 5.00pm to 9.00am."
19,Rameshwaram: Jai Shree Ram 🙏🙏,Have visited Sangamam where both bay of Bengal and Indian ocean meets. Its only place in Asia where you will be standing in Indian shore and getting mobile Tower or service from srilanka Airtel.
20,Not Worth,The national highway leading up to the endpoint on Dhanuskodi is absolutely fabulous. We could see ocean on both sides. The endpoint (with Ashoka pillar) was too crowded for our tastes. 
21,The Ghost Town,"Awesome place at the tip, beautiful ocean ..it gets quite hot.  headed off to dhanushkodi, its awesome with ocean on both sides and the narrow road in between, at the end is where we can park car and go to the ocean. there is also a nice temple in between.also enroute you can…"
22,Travel with parents,Last point of India... Amazing place with sea on three sides.. Close to Sri Lanka.. Infant our mobile was catching network from srilanka
23,Rameswaram tour,"The Ram Setu till Arichal munai / Dhanushkodi is historically important and also a natural wonder. The narrow road runs straight for 20 Kms with Sea on both sides.    With National Highway extended till the last point,  its an easy drive in own vehicle.   You can also get Taxi…"
24,A place worth visiting,This is the tip of India which is very near to Sri Lanka. The route to this point is very scenic and we can see blue waters on Indian Ocean on either sides. Very nice place to chill and eat tasty pineapple & other cut fruits sold by locals. Very nice place to click lots of…
25,Last land point of our country,"Beautiful Beach, very close to Srilanka Border as told by our guide. Blue water, peaceful. Paradise on Earth, must visit place during Rameshwaram Visit."
26,Amazing place ,Dhanushkodi Beach Point is a pilgrim centre. As you face Sri Lanka you get a great feeling. the beaches are getting dirtied by the local vendors. The local authorities mut interviene immediately.  
27,Sri Ram 48 km Floating Stone Bridge in Indian Ocean ,"It is one of my long dreams to drive through Pampan Bridge  up to Dhanushkodi which is the extreme end of the Indian Subcontinent.  Dhanushkodi is an abandoned town 23 Km away from  Rameswaram .  The road connecting to Rameswaram to Dhanushkodi is opened in 2016 and now you can straight away drive to Dnaushkodi, The travelling is really wonderful through the road .Bboth sides full of greenery for some distance and thereafter   you will be in the middle of two oceans.. Really wonderfull and memorable journey.  You can see ruins of the   1964 cyclone still stand high to show its splendour.The  riuns of a Church, Old railway stations, Post office and naval base is visible.Tourists can drive  Dhanushkodi to Arichamunai (4.5 KM) in their own vehicle and end up with Pillars of Ashoka.. and park your vehicles here. It is bit congested area.Then you can walk through the   pristine beaches,  One side is Bay of Bangal and other side Indian Ocean.  Really wonderfull  beach.I was awestruck at the sight of crystal clear water.  If you visit rameshwaram  please do not miss Dhanushkodi. it is really a wonderfulll place where past meet present.TIps. It is very hot and humid place. So keep your cap, sunglass, Sunscreen, water bottles ready. small shops sells water, snacks and sea shell ornaments. Food especially seafood are available on small huts along the side of the road. But  no idea about the quality.  Morning and evenings are best visit this place. But it is not advisable to stay there after sunset. It is virtually a noman island after sunset."
28,"Beautiful place, landmark to tick in lifetime",The beach where the three oceans come together. Also used by the locals for religious baths. From a distance it has pretty shades of green. Has pretty much a sandy beach.
29,Dhanushkodi .... Trip ... Not what one expected,"This place is overwhelming. As you enter Dhanushkodi, you see the seas on both side. Firstly the sight of blue water will excite you. Then as you shall move ahead, you will realize that seas on both the side are different.  While the waters on your left are calm, the waters on…"
30,Nice beach,"This is only abondoned town in India . We can see the tip near Ramsethu . The road will be opened by 6:15 am and closed by 5.00pm . The ruins of Dhanushkodi will tell the past history of 1964 , 1948 .. . Can taste the local fish on road side restaurants . Searched for traces of…"
31,Fantastic beach visit!,"Opened some time back, the road from rameshwaram right to the end of dhanushkodi until the last point of the beach is just amazing. Driving on a small stretch of land with water.on both sides. Color of water is diff on either side and th waves behave diff too. This is a must do and something I am keen on doing again 😊"
32,Good place to see both Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean,"Dhanushkodi Beach is the The Last Point of India, where to oceans Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean meets. As per Ramayan Dhanushkodi is the place where Ramsetu was built. This is Very beautiful and clean beach, but not for bathing as police issued warning due to many accidents in…"
33,"""Bow's end""? More like wit's end!",This is the furthest beach which you can reach in Rameshwaram.The road to the beach in itself is a great travelling experience with sea on either side.Water is really clean.There are only one or two shops near by so do carry your water bottle.
34,"Filthy, overcrowded, stinky","Bay of Bengal on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other, Dhanushkodi once used to serve as an important port for both traders and pilgrims. Ferry services were available between Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar, a town in Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon). The distance between…"
35,"Must visit, its a last point of India!",If you are on a pilgrimage and devotional based tour then Danushkodi can be avoided. It is a nice ride though the narrow roads mean there will be a huge crowd and traffic blockage in and out.  My understanding was that you had the bay of bengal / Indian ocean on one side and the…
36,"Serenity, beauty, calmness...Time stops here","Trip to Rameshwaram is incomplete till the time you haven’t travelled to “dhanushkodi” and “House Of Kalam”.Hot weather,but beach bath will didnt let you feel it.Try to spent more time in any uncrowded part and you will definitely love it.Will get melons,Pine apple,green mangoes to energise and rehydrate your body.Dont forget to click photos with pillar having national emblem on top.No fee.Will get public transport in ₹30 ticket from rameshwaram but still must book a taxi,cab as there are other places also nearby(abandoned church,vibhishan temple and other temples) which cant be left.For more accurate details check pictures uploaded."
37,Nice roadtrip,"A visit to Rameshwaram is incomplete without visiting Dhanushkodi. This is the end portion of Sothern India, a meeting point of Indian Ocean & Bay of Bengal. Srilanka border is 18kms & Ram Sethu stone bridge is 8kms but its under water & cannot be seen. A guy with Teliscope kind…"
38,Best sea beach In india,"This is not just another beach because of the layout of the place. The sea on one side (Bay of Bengal side) is completely calm while the one on the Indian Ocean side is windy with waves eating on the land.Beach is big enough for peak season. Water is shallow and no stones, so it…"
39,The best in India to travel,Dhanushkodi Beach is closed due to short cyclone in May 2018 . We couldn’t go all the way to the end as roads were broken and police barricades. We had to stop at old Dhanushkodi village. But even after that the road to Dhanushkodi is majestic and beautiful with sea on both sides.
40,Nice Beach,Dhanushkodi Beach lies on the tip of the Rameswaram island. Such A Attractive Place. Very Interesting While Driving form City To Beach Area. The main attractions of the beach are Ram sethu view point and the Adam's Bridge. 
41,Unique and beautiful experience,"Dhanushkodi is at the tip of Rameshwaram & a must see, just the drive to Dhanushkodi(the last 4 kilometres) is an awesome experience as there is an endless stretch of ocean on both sides of the road. it gives you an amazing sense of serenity. You can also get down to the beach &…"
42,No words to explain.. ,Drive till here in early morning (for sunrise) is good experience.  Beach on one side is clam and on the other side is opposite. Awesome experience of driving between the ocean on both the side.
43,Danushkodi end point is closed for public now,"Sri Ram Setu...(Setu in India means Bridge). 3rd November 7292 B.C,  the final war, to rescue Sita, had started..is a 48 Km ( Floating Stone Bridge) built man-made 9000 years ago by Lord Ram's  Army to cross the Indian Ocean at Dhanuskodi, India to Srilanka to rescue his wife Sita who was abducted by King of Srilanka - Ravana in a Flying Chariot (note : Wright Brothers invented Aeroplane in 19th Century only)...signing off 2019 from Sri Ram Setu start point at Dhanushkodi, now its topping the charts as a must visit Tourist Destination for Spiritual Bliss after confirmation by NASA & Discovery Channel.... ......for years, there has been a debate around Ram-setu.While some believe it was built by Lord Ram's Hanuman (Monkey) Army and is also mentioned in the Ramayana, Hindu Ancient 9000 years old Epic.Is it true? Scientific analysis suggests they are :This is the promo of Science Channel owned by Discovery Communications.In the promo, an archaeologist says, ""The rocks on top of the sand actually pre-date the sand."" The most interesting bit about the case was that the ocean sand was was 4000 years old, but the rocks on them were at least 7000 years old.This discrepancy shows they were probably placed there."
44,"Obviously Little crowded,but worth visiting","On the way to Dhanushkodi, there will be the destructed churches, houses and buildings, and some shops which sells various crafts made of seashells like chains, bracelets etc.  Crossing this, you will reach the Main attraction : Dhanushkodi Beach, which is the end. You will feel…"
45,Beautiful Place,"20 kms from Rameshwaram, Dhanushkodi is a strip of land which has Indian Ocean to it's right and Bay of Bengal to it's left.This place was destroyed by flood in 1964. It's not a habitable place. However, for natural beauty lovers, the turbulent Indian Ocean and the contrasting serene back Waters of Bay of Bengal side by side makes it a beautiful watch.At the tip of Dhanushkodi, the two waterbodies merge and no is allowed to touch the tip of the strip of land since it's said to be highly dangerous.One can also visit a temple (name forgotten) in Rameshwaram where the floating rocks will be given as prasadam as a token for giving donation.(I brought one)Dhanushkodi can be reached either by public transport or private car and Sri Lanka is just 29kms away. There's a light house, which is used as a vigilance for any suspicious vessels/ scrupulous exchanges between China & Sri Lanka.There are small shops in the dilapidated structures which sells various decorative items, pendents, pen stands made of sea shells, various other sea shell products.Sit on the fine sand near the shore and delve into the depth of your thoughts, not ocean."
46,Awesome,"Dhanushkodi beach is a dangerous beach in rameswaram.,Because waves are more powerful.wave heights was above one meters."
47,Quick trip to Rameswaram,"What a wonderful experience! Great drive from Rameswaram on the newly opened road! Scenes of devastated Dhanushkodi town, the old railway station and church are very disturbing! As you approach the beach and lands end, mobile signals will go off! And what a beautiful beach it…"
48,W,"The road from Rameswaram to Dhanush kodi was very scenic with backwaters on either side. But when we reaches the spot, except for the fishermen's hits and shops selling sea-shells there was nothing much. There we found a dilapidated church with bear walls and no roof. There was…"
49,memorable trip !!,"Road to reach this point is between the Bay of bengal and Indian Ocean, you can see water on both the sides of the road, Lot of old memories are there on the way which destroyed during the cyclone."
50,Colourful ,The beach is situated at the tip of the Rameshwaram Island & about 20 KM away from the main town from where the place is accessed by a nice motorable road passing through a strip of land with sea at both side. The entire route provides excellent panoramic view with blue & wavy…
51,Nice view and very good experience,"We visited the place, very nice,clean and a history with this place.The Ram setu bridge was built in age of Ramayana..Ram and Hanuman sena built the Ram setu to reach Srilanka.It is a Historical place.it is informed us that Srilanka is nearby from here.one must visit this…"
52,Beach,This place was memorable and found interesting looking at the photographs and write up hanged in the Vibhishana Temple.
53,Wonderful,Visited this site where left side is Bay of Bengal and right is Indian Ocean. Left is very windy and seemd rough waters while the opposite is true for right side. Where the two meets creates a colliding waves like it is hitting the shore.
54,Excellent place!! ,It indeed is a surreal experience visiting Dhanushkodi. It is an ocean to be preserved. Unfortunately people seemed to have made a mess of the parking area and eventually it is getting dirtier. The Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal together makes it so soothing to ones eye.
55,Beautiful beach at the tip of South India,One side is the Indian Ocean and on the other side is Bay of Bengal. The place has the ruins of the Tsunami. Now the road is open you can go with your own vehicle. Worth to spend Evening in beach will children. On the way to beach there is small hotel for having sea foods.
56,Rameshwaram,We were a family of four adults.Beautiful sight of the last point in India.rolling waves add to the breathtaking views of the ocean.  With so many tourists visiting this place it lacks a toilet.  The drive to the point is amazing.  Incredible India.  Regards Udhbir Singh
57,Amazing,"This is a beautiful pristine beach. When you drive into dhanushkodi's excellent roads with beaches on both side, it really feels like driving right into the end of land. The beautiful beach is an excellent destination for the great ride. There are no public restrooms or other…"
58,Southern most tip of India ,"The southern most point of India and got relevance to history of Setu , but other than that it’s a place where two sea joins and white sand and blue waters ...very picturesque place..plan to visit in late afternoon or evening hours as it’s quite hot in daytime parking space at…"
59,No words to describe,"Dhanushkodi beach is a meeting point of the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. It is 18 KMs way from Rameswaram can be reached by road. A popular belief is that, it is where Vibishana a brother of Ravana surrendered before Rama. "
60,Awesome place to be at,"It was wonderful indeed at Dhanushkodi beach, white sand with neat greenish sea is beautiful. Waves of sea wash off your feet and sometimes drench you upto waist. A trip to TN is incomplete without this beautiful place."
61,Tour,"There is now a tarmac road right the way to the end of the Dhanushkodi peninsula, which opens it up to many tourists and pilgrims. This has reduced the tranquility of the place but has enabled many more people to enjoy it and also provided good trading opportunities for the locals"
62,Nice Beach,"3 Sea's meets here where Sri Rama landed to scout the island of Sri Lanka. He knew where is Sita and crossed the Sea on Stone Bridge.The stones,were written Sri Rama's name on it and floated and bridge constructed was made easy.The bridge called Ram Sethu is still under water as…"
63,Dhanuskodi Beach,"A most memorable trip towards Dhanushkodi from Rameshwaram. Abundance of natural beauty for photographers.A place where Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal meet.A unique feeling while going through,both sides can see the original wild beauty of sea with white sand border.Thank you so…"
64,Amazing beach,Two seas meet here; the sea shore is between two seas. One side sea with waves and other very calm and clear.  Nice place to see and bath.
65,Wonders of Nature,"I have been to so many beaches, but driving to Dhanushkodi is most memorable. Roof top of my car was opened and driving in NH  with sea on both the sides, nothing can be better for eyes. I went in evening as well as in morning ."
66,Journey to the end of India Main Land,"The drive to Dhanushkodi is a good experience.  One one side the sea water is calm and on the other it is not. The place is clean. Walk on the clean sands.  One should go a bit early. We reached there at about 5 pm. After 5.30, the police do not allow people there as a safety…"
67,Best beach in India,"Must go place if you are going to Rameshwaram. The road from Rameshwaram to Dhanushkodi is beautuful, water on both sides. Bibhishan temple is in between.One can see the remnants of the ghost town. After 5 pm, one can go to Dhanushkodi for security reasons. If you are in…"
68,Visit with Family,"It is quite a deserted place,a ghost village in ruins enroute Rama Sethu. You can stop for few clicks,roam around and thats it."
69,It's a great feeling to see 2 seas simultaneously on your left and right- one is silent and there other is rough,Where the Bay of Bengal meets the Indian ocean and the vista is super fabulous.Avoid weekends to avoid disappointment because of mad rush. Beware of pufferfish on the Indian ocean side.
70,Amazing drive,"Visited on 17th Dec,2019. Danushkodi beach the end point where you can go via Jeeps is closed for public now and not allowed as of now. You can go upto 5km before and park the vehicle and  walk for and see the ruins etc. But disappointed as not able to go to end!"
71,Wow place,"In one word, it is spectacular view, distinctly two colors of water of Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal visible,on the way view sunrise, Fish lover can enjoy the sumptuous fresh fish fry in the lunch hour on the road side stalls at Dhanuskodi,"
72,Superb place,new road connectivity open for tourists till ARICHAL MUNAI..wonderful experience. would had been great if permitted to view RAM SETU ....
73,Absolutely amazing drive,Danushkodi beach is amazing with Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean on either side. The journey to danushkodi itself is breathtaking as the land shrinks and becomes almost a ribbon with mighty sea on either side. It is a unique experience not to be missed. The sangamam where the two…
74,Natures wonders,I couldnt believe the color of water here. This place is around 20 km from main Rameshwaram. On the way you come across the vibhishan temple and also one view point which is also a checkpost. The last 5 km strectch is open from 5 am to 5 pm. We got delayed so werent allowed as it was 5.20 pm.However this point is also very scenic and we had some good sunset views here. The next morning after the mani darshan in the ramanathswamy temple we headed to dhanushkodi beach. So we were here around 6.00 am and the place was completely to us with 3 more vehicles. It was absolutely stunning at that hour of day. There was dynamic Indian ocean on one side and calm Bay of bengal on the other. The drive itself was fantastic. When we reachd the dhanushkodi beach we felt the time had stopped. One wouldnt be able to believe it was India !!! I simply loved it.
75,Rameshwaram -Madurai trip,Hidden gem of India. Worth the 4 km walk from the vehicle drop off point. Try to go early morning or around sunset time. Don't miss when in Rameshwaram. 
76,Different experience tour ,When we reached dhanushkodi it was closing. We still managed to reach at the end. It was peak season in rameshwaram with so much crowd that they didn't allow the car to go till the end. The beauty of walking in between the sea is awesome.
77,Excellent view,"Feeling proud, beacause when we are standing at the beach, that is the end of a big country ""India""...This is the border line of indian ocean and bay of bengal..."
78,Good Silent 👍 beach,"The geographical location of the beach, as an extension of the Rameswaram Island, makes it worth visiting. Unfortunately there are no amenities, no lights, no wash rooms and no proper parking arrangments. No signages, no street lights. The government should pay attention to improve it."
79,Beautiful,Dhanushkodi beach is the best place to witness a beautiful sunrise. The road that leads to this beach has ocean on both the sides making it an amazing experience.
80,Amazing drive,"There are beaches like Juhu beach at Mumbai, Marine Drive at Chennai, Alibagh, Goa and Trivendrum and then there is Dhanuskoti beach. The beach is west most tip of Rameswaram the meeting point of Bay of Bengal and Indian ocean. Towards the end of the beach you may see RamSetu…"
81,Windy - stingy sandy winds and risky beach ,"One of cleanest beach of India. Situtated around 20 kms away from Rameswaram, this one is end point of India from where Sri Lanka is almost 60-70 kms away through sea route. This one is the ghost town which is due to 1960s Tsunami. You will not allowed to stay beyond 5 pm. Have…"
82,Neat and clean,You are literally at the tip.  On one side is the Indian Ocean and on the other side is Bay of Bengal. The place has the ruins of the Tsunami. Very peaceful place. Not too many people. Should cost about a few hundred rupees to get here from the Rameshwaram temple by auto or by…
83,A must when in Rameswaram ,A must see place during the visit to rameswaram. Ashoka tomb at its end show the pride of india..............
84,Amazing blue waters..,The place is having very clean and white beach. It's very beautiful. The road to Dhanushkodi was made just Couple of years back which is something that should have been done long back. Please visit the place for sure.
85,The last land of India,"Very pleasant place, one side bay of bengal and other side indian ocean crystal clear water, here u can see cyclone effected places means u can see demolished structures, beach will open till 05pm after police will stop vehicles and send back. So plan early. In this place…"
86,Interesting and Exciting Place to Visit,"The best time of the day to visit Dhanushkodi is 6'oclock in the morning.  A smooth and straight road flanked by two beautiful oceans run from Rameswaram to Dhanushkodi. The 30 min journey is most enjoyable. When you reach the farthest tip of Indian soil closest to Sri Lanka, one get to see the lapping of Bay of Bengal with its characteristic calmness as compared to the roaring Indian Ocean with bluish green waves.Since there is no man made structure for the visitors it is strongly advised to visit during early morning or late afternoon to avoid the scorching sun.It is also strongly recommended to keep the beach clean and not to take a dip because of unpredictable and interfering ocean currents.There are no coast guards to alert the visitors."
87,Rameshwaram,"The drive from Rameswaram to Dhanushkodi is very pleasant. With water on either side. While the beaches are good, there are a number of cautions on getting to the water.  On the day we visited on 23 rd Jan, the road was being closed for traffic from 5 pm onwards in connection…"
88,Awesome place,"It is very scenic, no  bias on Ram setu angle, but should visit for it's beauty. It has nice drivable road, can drive till end, and occasionaly will be welcome by Sirlanka Airtel. Recomend to travel either early moring or in evening, mid noon it is tool hot, swimming is not…"
89,Beautiful Place,"This place is 35kms from the temple.No mobile network in this area.Well maintained clean beach, 15 kms to Sri Lanka from the beach ."
90,Last point onif India,"We have seen it in ads, now is the time to explore ourselves! Straight road with beach at both sides, and goes all the way up to the tip of India"
91,Excellent Beach ,Awesome place must visit Dhanushkodi..Very neatly maintained place. You have to hire a local taxi and drive to Dhanushkodi. Buses are available but if you hire taxi you can visit 3 places 1>Sangama of Bay of Bengal sea and Hindu Maha Sagar 2>Dhanushkodi(Old Church and Old…
92,Sea ocean view at nature's best,Had visited this place with my better half while visiting the Rameshwaram Temple. I could not see any floating rocks. Its a place worth seeing.
93,Sangam,"This place cannot be explained in words.. If you want to feel the bliss of lonely waking amidst the group of people who are passing by your side, then this is the place.. My personal feeling is that, one should come to this place alone and spend atleast 3 - 4 hours, seeing each and every demolished place.. They remain as a witness of the anger of Mother Nature.. Just see each and every place which is left in pieces after the 1960's Tsunami.. When you take a lonely walk thinking about the life we are leading now, then I'm sure after returning from this place, we will surely reduce our unwanted expenses And understand the value of life.. Come and feel the difference.."
94,Ghost Island,"One can feel that this is last point of India, after effects of Sunami & devastation is visible. Foodie can enjoy fish & rice at shaks at roadside, food is excellent "
95,Pamban Island..must visit this place,"Must see place if you are going to Rameshwaram. You can drive your own vehicle to the end point of the land in Rameshwaram and on the way you can see some old buildings and church that has been destroyed in 1964/65 cyclone. Spend some time on the beach and if you put on your google maps, you will be amazed to see how the land narrow downs as you move towards the tip point."
96,Remotest beach of India connected to mainland,dhanushkodi beach is clean beach.the way to the beach is wonderful scenery.we can see the remnants of the houses which was destroyed in tsunami
97,Vitamin sea,Amazing nature made place worth to visit. Blue seas of Bay of bengal and a thin line of land... beautiful naturally creative place . The origin point of Ram Setu...And abandoned village of old dhanushkodi... Really amazing.
98,must visit place in your life,"Very good place to visit.Bay of Bengal at our left...very calm and composed.Indian ocean at our right...waves..aggression..Both meet at this point.Sand is very fine.Tsunami destroyed this place in1964.We can see destroyed railway station,post office,church etc.here.

99,Gents vs ladies,"one of the lesser known beaches in India, this one is amazing blue waters...white sands...and full of fun...the road that leads to the tip of India, probably very close to srilanka offers amazing views of the ocean on all sides....enjoyed every bit of our time...."
100,beach,Unique view of India ocean & bay of Bengal merger. One of the best road in the country to reach the tip of the sea. I highly recommend this place for memorable trip.
101,Dhanushkodi beach,Actually this is the best visited sea beach by myself. You can see the bay of bengal and indian ocean in both sides.
102,Windy and sands,"Dhanushkodi beach is one of the beautiful places in India, where you will see the bay of Bengal in one side and Indian Ocean in other side. It is the southern tip of Indian subcontinent. Beautiful place. It is really a heaven in the world.. You will be driving in the road were…"
103,A good place to see beauty of ocean,"You might have read about DhanushKodi already. My experience with Dhanushkodi is, You can see waves on one side and a calmness on the other side. Its one of the finest, awesome places to visit with family and will enjoy for sure. "
104,Good views,"Neat and clean beaches. Drive from Rameswaram to Danushkodi is memorable. Peaceful place, must visit."
105,lovely beach....,Visiting Holya  place like Rameshwaram would be great blessing and worthy pilgrimage to be at this Jyothirlinga Temple. This ancient temple built in an Island with great sculpture and grandeur really mesmerizes. Its historical and mythological significance reveals the mightiness…
106,Ram Setu by Lord Ram proven by NASA,"The original town of Dhanushkodi having been washed away/destroyed decades ago, what is left is a slim strip of beach, at the end of a long road, barren but for few dilapidated ghost buildings! The road splits the waters into two. On one side of the road, the beach is calm and cool that even baby children can sit and enjoy the sands, tepid waters. While the beach on the other side of the road, quite contrastingly, is extremely windy, keeps throwing bucketful sands on the road! And the waves are high, and rapid! It is a natural wonder as to how Indian Ocean & Bay of Bengal behave in this fashion at the same location!"
107,Good,"Visited mid-morning. Views of both oceans (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) stunning. However, traffic causes major obstructions. Many road-side vendors selling fruit and ice cream, but the site is not well cared for and suffers from excessive littering. No toilets. Warnings against bathing because of the undertow. Glad to have seen where the India- Sri Lanka land bridge once was."
108,We Were In Srilanka Almost,Dhanushkodi is the abandoned place in tsunami in 1966. There is a railway station and a old church which are abandoned also there is a place where lord Rama promise to make Vibhishan King of Lanka and above all these the end point is very eye pleasing where you will find sea all…
109,Southern Tip of Bharat ,The best beach in Tamil Nadu. Clear blue waters. Clean and neat long beach. Excellent place to unwind.. 
110,Avoidable,Trip to Dhanushkodi Beach involves 35 minutes drive from Rameswaram. Start early for a wonderful view of the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean side by side. Don't go in the evening hours as u are not allowed to go. I guarantee you will have a spectacular experience on board.The…
111,Historical,"I went to Dhanushkodi Beach. While the rest of India is vying to get ahead in the race for prosperity, this town seems frozen in history, reflecting it grandeur and beauty. It is great place to go."
112,Fantastic experience!,Excellent beach with clean water. Road available till dhanuskodi (20km away from Rameswaram. Worth to spend Evening in beach will children. On the way to beach there is small hotel for having sea foods. 
113,A kind of beauty in imperfection-Dhanushkodi and Pamban Bridge,"At the edge of the country, about 35 km from Sri Lanka.. this pristine beach is remarkably well maintained and clean for the number of people visiting this beach. It is said that Lord Rama constructed the ram setu to rescue Sita from Lanka from this point. The waters are blueish…"
114,APJ Kalam Memorial,Dhanushkodi beach is serene with very less crowd. Lot of sea-shell shops nearby and lot of sea food restaurants.
115,Amazing beach with views spreading as far as the eye can see,"The road to Dhanushkodi view point is just so amazing, where you can see Bay of Bengal on the left and Indian Ocean on the right, and it joins near the Dhanuskodi view point.Sunset was mesmerizing as well. This place has its own history. One from The Ramayana and another one from 1964 Rameswaram Cyclone. A must visit place. It opens from 6.00am to 4.00pm. This is because it is Indian border and Sri Lankais just 20km away! So, get there earlier possible."
116,Dream drive,Visited in morning about 10 am. The road leading to the point is superb sea on both the sides the colour of water is just so beautiful it takes your tiredness away. You have to walk atleast 500 meters to reach the last point of Dhanushkodi. There is a telescope which shows you…
117,Evey one must visit,"When I last visited about four years ago, Dhanushkodi beach was not accessible. But now the road lead to Dhanushkodi is better than national highways. Must visit beach."
118,Nice drive,"It was great experience for seeing dhanushkodi beach and knowing all the facts of Ramayana.we were very happy for seeing this place as ,we can  see the Sri lanka border from dhanushkodi is only 13 km. enjoying alot for knowing all the facts of ramayna, and dhanushkodi beach…"
119,A beautiful view of two oceans at one point,"While you are still young and can appreciate nature at its best go there.Driving through to Dhanushkodi will definitely through the iconic Pamban bridge. You would have a spectacular view of the ocean from there. I went there from chennai , so what am used to see is waves that carry lot of dirt in them. To some extent I thought thats how the sea would be even inside, given that we send all pollutants to the sea. That perception changed completely there. I went with family there so they wanted to go to temple. Nothing wrong against that, but I just preferred to go to dhanushkodi beach again so went in twice. Place is not commercialized so you wont find big eateries, its actually good else the place will end up having lots of plastic pollution. Except for few 'cut fruit' selling vendors you wont find any commercialized activity.The place does not have electricity, and its not needed as well for us since tourists wont be allowed to go post 4-5 PM. Post that place its only local residents who have got prior permission to be there. Now coming to the beach- Since the road to beach point goes deep into the sea, you would see the sea in its actual Blue color, step inside water and you would see water so clear that you can see your feet so clearly. Since there is not much pollution the beach sand is clean and white. The road to the beach point is narrow, so if you are driving then you have to go all the way till police allow you and take a U turn. On holiday season expect lot of crowd and finding a parking spot for your vehicle may be difficult (not a nightmare still). Every other driver would understand your problem as they too would face the same problem. Expect no mobile signal from indian mobile co. You may pick up Airtel from Srilanka. Unless you want to cook up your mobile bill and god forbid some problem from indian authorities, never connect to that. The only mobile signal I got is BSNL and that too getting substantiially into our main land but not in Dhanushkodi.The local fish market person had a small stage on a big staircase, I was wondering the purpose and he explained that its for getting a mobile signal :-) . He went on to explain that normal feature phone has better reception and smartphone wont work there. Apart from battery life this was the first time I heard a smart phone losing to feature phone.  You can walk till the end where there is an ashoka pillar and a round about around it. someone told to me that you can see srilanka from there, I tried hard but could not. May be in the night we could see some light from srilanka, but you wont be allowed to stay in Dhanushkodi beach point post 5 pm anyways. I blamed it on the High seas for not being able to see SrilankaJust go for it if you are a nature lover and want to see the ocean at its best."
120,Awesome beach..,"Known for being the beautiful beach of the ghost town , the Dhanuskodi beach offers a very memorable lifetime experience. It's the place where the waters of the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal meet. The beach along with the town is a major tourist attraction in Tamil Nadu. The…"
121,"Dhanushkodi, Rameswaram.",Visited this place on 28th Feb 2020 and spend some time. Quite peaceful and can be called as South-End end point from where Sri Lanka is around 20kms. The drive to beach point is also good. Worth to visit.
122,Beautiful Place,Come for the ruins of the town destroyed in 1964 by the cyclone. Also take a look at the beach (no swimming--even if the locals are) and the fishermen's thatched houses. Enjoy the drive along the thin sliver of beach that runs for miles until it hits a busy end point where some…
123,End point of India,Two water bodies fighting against each other to retain their identity - the shaant Bay and the dramatic India Ocean! What a scene... One of the most beautiful sites to definitely see in your lifetime!
124,Dirty beach,Thanks to TN tourism for building this great road stretch of 25 km from Rameshwaram to Dhanushkodi and RamSetu.  What a wonderful and unique feeling that we had while driving. Just like a black horse riding on a sea.  Few things to Note: 1. The place entry will close by 5 pm 2.…
125,worth a dekko,"Heard lot about Dhanushkodi from travellers on the beauty of this place However I didn’t found anything mesmerising except the drive to this place. If you have your own conveyance, then you should visit this place. There is road along with sea which is breathtaking - on the way…"
126,FOR SEEING RAMSETU,Driving on a small strip of land with sea on both sides is a surreal experience. Thought that this perhaps is the place where Rama and his army worked to build a bridge on the ocean makes it magical.  Its an awesome destination and must-visit in Rameshwaram.
127,AWESOME! AWESOME! SUPER AWESOME,"Dhanushkodi beach , one of the best place to visit in South India. Must visit and enjoy few hours, lifetime memories"
128,The end of india.,The moment we reached there everyone was amazed after looking at nature's beauty. How Bay of bangal and Indian ocean water is mixing together is beautiful to watch. Behavior of both the ocean is amazing.Route from Rameshwaram to Dhanushkodi is also good.
129,excellent beach,"If you come to Rameswaram, do not commit the blunder of not visiting this point! It is in the midst of high-sea! We had to wait and wait, as the road was closed due to the Gaja cyclone. But the wait of 2 days was worth it! It's a memorable trip as you drive on a road into high…"
130,Tip of the land at South East India,"A very beautiful beach, that was once a happening hub of many activites! Having been washed away by a storm in 1964, the remains narrate a very sad story! The beach in itself is such a beauty that one would not want to move out of this place! Only families that survived the 1964 cyclone are inhabitants of this beautiful sea hamlet! The last time we went, that is 4 years back, there were no such roads that took us to the beach. We had to get down and take a TUV that was driven on the sand. Now, there are good roads and the vehicles take us till the beach. Do visit the remains of the storm..An old church, the post office, the old railway station and do check from the local inhabitants about Dhanushkodi. You would leave with a very heavy heart!"
131,amazing,"The beach is vast and less polluted. Visit time is restricted till 6, just at sunset. This is located near the ghost town of Dhanushkodi. Good place for time lapse photography. No beach guard is there at most of the areas. Waves are rough and kids have to be careful."
132,Mysterious Dhanushkodi,The best place to go for last land of india. By road both side ocean view. Awesome view. A day at d beach will give u the thugs u need to refresh your life
133,Excellent clean beach..,A pleasant 30 minutes drive from Rameshwaram town with good road condition. Great scenes driving on a narrow strip of land with the calmer Bay of Bengal sea on one side and the rough Indian Ocean on the other.  Lots of food and souvenir huts along side the road to make the…
134,Hauntingly Beautiful,The place is related to era of Sri Ram while he was going to attack Sri Lanka . Lord Ram prayed Samundra to allow him to cross and reach Lanka. Bay of Bagal & Arabian Sea meet here . Nice place to see Last tip & end of Earth . 
135,The best sunrise from Rameswaram,One of the rare places in and around Rameshwaram where you will find a clean beach. Not far away from SL. Your mobile may switch to international roaming here.Drive to the place is a bliss. Abandoned town adds to the appeal.
136,Idyllic beach,"An excellent place to spend some time, evenings are the best time, unfortunately the district admn restricts the entry to the place post 5.30PM, so early mornings are suggested. Also during Dec 2018, i could see that the Police personnel were not allowing anyone to go near the…"
137,Visit the tip of india....thanks to the nice road..do not miss,We had been to Rameshwaram and Madurai in Aug 2019.  The trip was organized by Holiday's mart ltd Delhi... It was a memorable trip with lots of Fun and Enjoyments..Thanks to Holiday's Mart for the excellent service and coordination ..  This is my 5th trip through them.
138,"Mesmerizing , scenic, out of the world",You cannot miss this place if anywhere around Rameswaram. Public allowed only during day and until 6pm. Later this place is under BSF security. There is no facilities except few fruit food vendors. You have a few curio shops maybe 10kms away near old ruined church & railway station. The Round About at the edge of India is an simply beautiful due to ocean all around you. You are jutting out of a 20km stretch into the Ocean.
139,Gulf of mannar,This is not just another beach because of the layout of the place. It is close a 3km stretch with a narrow stretch of land with road running on the middle and sea on both sides. The sea on one side (Bay of Bengal side) is completely calm while the one on the Indian Ocean side is…
140,"The Last Point of India, where Ramsetu was built","Dhanushkodi, perfect bend of nature. 22kms distance from nearest town Rameswaram. Well connect3d with road and railway. Driving towards Dhanushkodi will remain a wonderful experience. Best time for the visit is afternoon. There is no covered area from rain. Motorbike riders-…"
141,Amazing Place,This place is really awesome to visit... one side of the road is ocean with tides & the other side of the ocean is calm... very good views of beaches and this is the place where Ramasethu starts... Srilanka is just few kilometeres away from this point.. My family loved the adventure sports in rameswaram...
142,"Pristine beaches , nature for now unspoiled ","Well connected road up to approximately end point. Beach is big enough for peak season. Water is shallow and no stones, so it is safe. "
143,Dhanushkodi Visit 😊,Beautiful and serene place a bit crowded in holiday season but you can still find a peaceful spot. Drive to the tip is mesmerizing must visit place. Has it's own mythological significance so do visit the place.
144,End point of India,"Gorgeous sights. Clean beaches. Clear waters. Sea faring birds diving in to catch fish. Sight of 2 oceans - Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean next to each other. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to step into the water on account of the proximity to International border and as well as the shifting sands."
145,Ultimate,"We were a couple out exploring Rameshwaram and Dhanushkodi. The Pamban bridge and temples in Rameshwaram sealed the deal of the trip. Dhanushkodi was the icing on the cake. We rent out a 4x4 Mahindra from the hotel for 1200/-, decent enough, and had a personalized drive through…"
146,Vacation ,It's a long road trip of 20 kms from Rameshwaram. Few huts and dwellings can be seen during the entire journey with sea water on both sides of road. The speciality of the place is that placid and clear water seen one side and restless waves hitting other side of land could be…
147,Couples,Just another beach with a collapsed village during 1964 storm. Disappointed as we were not allowed to see the place where Indian ocean and bay of Bengal meet. Don't know the exact reason for not allowing. Some say it's due to sand storm which is hard to believe
148,"Clean, very clean",Trip Advisor rates as #3 of 25 things to do in Rameswaram. We should make this #1. The newly laid road is like a runway and great place for a road trip.Remember to go before much 1800 hrs as they close by 1800 hrs.
149,Mesmerizing beach ...,Well honestly once you reach there one starts wondering why did I come here? The drive is superb from rameswaram about 20 KM only. The Bay of Bengal on the left and the Indian Ocean on the right. Wonderful sight. Dhanushkodi itself. Devasted town and nothing to see. An abandoned…
150,This one is for a bucket list,The newly laid road is excellent to drive on. The view is uncomparable. The road continues for 4 more KMS post Dhanuskodi. The sea on both sides of the road is breathtaking. Its clean and nicely maintained road and beach. We can also view the Ram setu on the left side.
151,Must Visit,"During RAMESWARAM trip, we visited this place. One side you can see clear blue sea of Bay of Bengal and other side Indian Ocean. One will feel excited after seeing the spectacular end point of the land. As per mythology, Lord Sri Rama built a Bridge/Sethu from here and SriLanka…"
152,Nice place. ,one side of the beach in clam &silent and other side of the beach is rough....it is good spot for photo clicks...it is also called as ghost town because of its history
153,Very Scenic ,"Must visit place in rameswaram. Dhanushkodi is open from 6 AM to 5 PM, so my advice is to visit at early morning 6 AM so you can see the Sun raise and it will be very less crowded. We have left rameswaram (Room) at 5:30 AM and reach the Dhanushkodi by 6 AM and roads are awesome…"
154,Beach visit,"More than the place itself, its the road that leads to it. Sea on both sides, the roads leads straight to the beach, the land’s end. There are couple of other attractions on the way. The entry to the place is closed by 5:30 in the evening. You can just chill out there and enjoy…"
155,Important geological and religious site,"Situated about 20 kms from Rameswaram, Dhanushkodi is a picturesque spot and a ghost town.   The Road from Rameswaram was, earlier, not in good shape and also stopped short of the tip or end point. People had to go over the last stretch of sand by jeep vehicle.  Now this newly…"
156,Tarmac all the way!,Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean merging place.... very nice experience.... Must see everyone one....it is located 15 km away for Rameswaram Railway station
157,A beauty to be preserved,An early morning drive to Dhanushkodi is a must do. Try reaching there before 6 to beat the rush and enjoy a beautiful sunrise.You might be stopped at the checkpost which opens at 6 AM but you could still enjoy the beaches along the beautiful road before the crowd gets there.The road is excellent and the drive enjoyable with the sea on both sides!
158,Clean beach,"Great view , clear sky and must visit if you are to rameswaram . Many sea items are also been sold there."
159,Visit under free time from home ,The historical context is that it is the site of one the worst natural disasters to occur in southern India prior to the 2004 Tsunami - the 1964 Cyclone which killed thousands of people and left this town a ghost town. The ruined buildings are the remnants of a once bustling town that was the launching point for the ferry to Sri Lanka. A whole train got washed into the sea here. The geographical significance is that it is the starting point of the mythical bridge to Sri Lanka that Lord  Rama built. Other than that there is not much to see.
160,Lovely beach,a must see site in Tamilnadu. at small distance from rameshwaram town . a little hard to reach.......
161,Good road for easy access.,"This is one of the most beautiful beaches we can see in India. We do see the mix of Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean. The drive from Rameshwaram to Dhanushkodi beach is beautiful and the place which was destructed in the 1964 cyclone. We can see the destruction there and is eerily haunting, if you are alone on that beach. Travel during weekdays when the crowd is less for the apt experience."
162,Must visit to see Indian ocean and Bay of Bengal meets here.,"dhanushkodi beach is a wonderful beach to enjoy. You will see less crowd and it is the advantage since you can spent more time and relax, swim freely in the beach"
163,Awesome View.,The road is excellent. Not much things to see there. Both the sides of the road is sea and sand. The view point is good but crowded. overall a good place to see. In the way lot of shops offering fried/ curry fishes. In old city there is a ruin of church and railway station.
164,End point.,"Road to Dhanushkodi is extremely good and the place will give a nostalgic feeling by mixing mythology with reality. Very scenic, But lot of scope for improvement to attract more tourists."
165,To viist the only abondoned town in india,"A trip to Dhanushkodi is a must when you visit Rameswaram, We had an early morning drive at 5:30 to 6:00 AM to Dhanushkodi. The trip was totally blissfull including the walk in the beach. Interestingly my Mobile tower started getting messages from Sri Lankan Operator"
166,Must visit place in Rameswaram,This island is known as ghost Island because of current living condition. We can reach this place by road. The road connectivity to this place is very good. At this place you can see the onside Indian Ocean and the other side bay of Bengal.
167,Awesome place must visit Dhanushkodi,"I have visited this place in 2011 when there was no road to the beach.  Except for road, not much has changed !!   Worth a visit and spend some quality time.  Pristine and unspoilt beach.  Plan to go during morning hours.  The entry starts at 7:00 and its worth enjoying the way…"
168,Dhanushkodi Beach,"This is a lifetime beach, I think serene, is the perfect word, the vast expanse of water will thrill you, by evening ng 4-5 pm the officials donot allow you to go near the beach and start consolidating.... Met new ppl from very far areas , indeed a place not to miss ..."

Time seems to stop here as you merge within yourself. Explore this best beach so clean , so pure so yours ...Best place…"
170,Beauty at its best!,"It closes by 5pm although due to security reasons. So go there before that. Imagine a 4 lane road, flanked by INDIAN OCEAN ON ONE SIDE AND BAY OF BENGAL ON THE OTHER. That’s the  road to DHANUSHKODI from Rameshwaram. ALL THANKS TO NARENDRA MODI who got the road constructed right…"
171,"Spectacular place, take the bus! ","Nice place to visit good views here see deferent type color of water, end of Indian field, wind speed is very high."
172,Beautiful Beach,"It was a very nice place to visit. We booked a cab at Reke India, rekeindia.com and had a trip in Tamil Nadu for 5 days. The trip was so good and this was a memorable place. The drive on dhanushkodi road was remarkable with sand breeze. It took 30 mins to reach dhanushkodi from…"

174,Dhanushkodi Beach,A nice check point - given its geography. Place worth checking is the ghost town nearby Beach is very windy and not an easy place to be. 
175,Awesome Place!,Better to go during the middle of the day! Crowd is above moderate as the dry land area is very less. water is safe for everyone to play. 
176,Nice Beach,wow what we were listening from childhood....our preachers used to tell about the Ram Setu etc...it was amazing to be at the place in person.
177,Dhanuskodi beach,"First of all, this is the most serene beach ever. Nothing comes close to it.  - No phone signal ( Only Srilanka's phone network is shown)  - Picturesque view of Indian Ocean  - Clean and clear water - Beautiful Sunrise and Sunset point. - Highly Recommend !!! Just Go ... 😇"
178,Dhanushkodi beach,Fantastic point of sea beach maintained by local body where you can see sea from all side. Cars can go there and it's very lovely place. Seaguards boat also moving around and at one point many fisher boats are running and looking very lovely. Nice place to visit while in…
179,Nice place,This place is serene and the mighty wind will welcome you with white sand. Walking in this area is really difficult due to strong wind but the roaring sea is a treat to watch. Overall a great place to be and enjoy the mother nature with her roar.
180,Mesmerising Beach,Nice place to travel. best view and very very good drive from Rameswaram. Worth driving there atleast once.
181,Absolutely gorgeous!,"excellent place to go.. must start early by 3 or 4 pm to reach the beach,, long inhibited area to be crossed. entry is closed after 6 pm.  but once u reach, its just fun all the way.. easy to take bath, super fun for kids, may be slightly crowded but the sunset view is awesome.…"
182,What a place!!!! But poorly maintained. ,Excellent beach with 360 degree sea view. Parking and marketing facility is there. You need to drive 20 KM from Rameswaram
183,Wow,Dhanushkodi is an abandoned place after the Tsunami hit the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu. More over the vehicle entry to the tip is restricted before 3 Kms from the tip. As such the visitors need to walk almost half an hour in the hot sun to reach the tip. The government…
184,One of cleanest,"This is great historical place which proves the Ramayan is true story,The evidence is the adam's bridge built by SRIRAM"
185,Oceanic view of Indian Ocean and Bay of bengal,"If you dream of visiting a place surrounded by ocean, this is it. Experience of sunrise is awesome. I guess sunset also should be equally good, though have not experienced personally. It should be in bucket list of any travel enthusiast"
186,Tip of India,"I had a very unique experience at Dhanushkodi Beach - both frustrating and beautiful.   On Day 1 of our trip, we reached Dhanushkodi at 4pm but were told by police that we had to leave our cars behind. We walked a little and then turned back as it was getting late.  On Day 2, we…"
187,Best place to visit in rameswaram,We visited the beach on 14th October 2018. On one side there is Indian Ocean whose waves are constantly touching the shore with high intensity and on other side Bay of Bengal water seems to be calm. 
188,Nearest point to Sri Lanka,This place hold the bridge build by Vanar sena as mentioned in Ramanyan which happend 10000 years back and is proven by Nasa Images as well. Last point where you can go in a 4 wheel drive vehicle or bus service which take you till the last point and worth visit...as sand and…
189,This you need to see once in a lifetime,"Very well developed roads and bunds from lashing sea waves. Area is kept clean with lot of efforts. Ample parking, good munching fresh fruits and very courteous locals. A pleasant site not to miss."
190,Beautiful Beach,One can see the meet point of bay of bengal and India sea. Eye catching view. Must visit this place if you are going to Rameshwaram.
191,Family trip,"The drive from Rameswaram to dhanushkodi is a sight to behold.. absolutely picturesque,with bay of Bengal on the left and indian ocean on the rightOnce you reach the end point of convergence, it gets too crowded.Nevertheless the journey has lot of options for sea food lovers, fresh fish roasted and served on a platter..The calm sea on either side makes you want to believe in mythology even if you happen to be an agnostic. A must visit.."
192,Dhanushkodi beach at the lands end is yet another beach worth seeing. The security here is tight and one cant go beyond,"A nice beach. Crowded.For me it is more than the beach, history of this place pulled me here. Dhanuskodi is a Ghost Town which was abandoned after 1964 hurricane. The killer waves swept through the town killing everyone who dared to ride the hurricane. I can only imagine the horror they went through by looking at the ruins of this beach town. A sense of sadness will dwell upon you when you walk through these ruins. I felt small in front of the power of nature that could unleash such a destruction upon us. I see people are living again in this place to cater tourists who visit this place.   It looks like how soon we forget how fragile this place is.. I believe there were three major incidents in the last century itself.  Indian Govt.(or TN State Govt.)  should declare this place as a National Park and forbid people construct their dwellings."
193,Best place to witness sunrise,"Unlike earlier when people had to take 4*4 jeep drive, now the roads are well laid till the end point where people can get down and spend some time on the beach. On both sides of the stretch, we can see ruins of old times like church, old railway station etc. Morning or evening…"
194,worth seeing when you visit Rameshwaran,"If you visit Rameswaram, do not miss this, its just beautiful, blue waters as long as your eyes can see. Just sit back and relax and watch the waves in the ocean. The drive itself is fabulous . If you like the Ocean you can spend good 4-5 hours here."
195,Neat Beach,Dhanush kodi beach is very famous beach in india and located in rameswaram Madurai. Very nice beach and so many films shooter here. Visually beautiful one.
196,Serene beach,This is 25 Kms from Rameswaram and a wonderfully serene place despite lack of proper tourist infrastructure after the horrific tsunami few years ago . The seas are rough but the views are amazing . A must visit
197,No words to describe what danushkodi is,"Have visited this place few weeks back. The sea here will give you a feel of back waters or lakes. All together different experience. Around 20 kms away from Rameshwaram. Road is very good. On the half way towards Dhanushkodi beach point (from Rameshwaram), we found an excellent beach on right. Its still virgin & unexploited. The end point is also good. Small roadside shops will be present. You can find destroyed railway station on the left & old church on the right."
198,Tour to RAMESWARAM & nearby places...,Drive to the beach is amazing. Sea on both the sides of the road. Waves on one side and calm water on other side.Great place for photography too.
199,In the High-Sea! Must visit point!,Must see place. Nature's gift. Fantastic scenery and beach. But as usual poorly maintained. Beach is Full of trash. If it was abroad it would have been world attraction. But the road to Dhanoskodi is very well maintained. Its a scenic drive. We have such fantastic places in…
200,Pristine Beach,"though the bathing is prohibited but you can take small dips and enjoy the clean sea, lovely view of the Sri Ram Setuwhen you travel to the place you have sea on both sides of the road, a must visit place"
201,Beautiful Place,"It is a beautiful beach and the waves from both oceans make it a captivating visit. However, the restriction of no swimming was a letdown. The ruins of the 1964 Tsunami that wiped out the entire population was very eerie to see but a reminder of the power of nature."
202,"Perfect blend of ocean,land and backwater","Historical space , not interested not interesting. Rameswaram is a Hindu religious place and also architectural excellence. Lot of touts in the temple, they extract money from you.  "
203,Dhanusodi Beach,"Lovely place, border of India, interesting part is after reaching here we got message from Airtel Srilanka that welcome to Airtel Srilanka ,which is actually not true, We are at the extreme border of India and Rameshwaram. Good place to enjoy , seashore and beaches are so…"
204,Amazing sight,"On 17 Jan 2019, i with my friends went to Dhanushkodi place from where we can see 2 oceans meeting. It is near Sri lanka, that we get SRI Lanka network on our mobiles 🤣. I was so happy on reaching this place."
205,The Best Attraction Of Rameshwaram,"If you are on a trip to Rameswaram, you might probably end up on this beach as it is really close by and totally beautiful.Dhanushkodi means the tip(kodi) of  Dhanush (bow) and derives its name from the legend where Ram,upon return from Lanka, destroyed the Ram Setu on Vibhishan's request. You can find some local guides showing travellers the floating riacks which were used in Ramayana to build the Ram Setu. The rocks seem like hardened sea foam and are lighter than they look. We stopped to shoot some pictures. It can be covered in a day's trip. It is not only a site for Hindus as the place is filled with different migratory birds. It is a heaven for bird watchers during the months of Nov-Feb. You can enjoy watching them swim in the shallow backwaters or flying high and swooping only to hunt. There are a few temples, if you care for them, which are very old and not that well maintained. Taking a bath is not advisable. You can see Bay if Bengal on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other while driving towards the tip of the place. You may stop for a snack of fish fry(local Tamil Cuisine) in the small shops near the main tourist points.Total price for 4 in a 5-6 seater vehicle: INR 1800 (Inclusive of tital 15 tourist points)Meal(Lunch Thali) for 4 in a standard AC restaurant: 800 INR"
206,What a memorable place...,"Nice and clean beach, security personnel available to see traveller must not go in the beach after a certain point"
207,Dhanushkodi Beach,"This beach is very clean and beautiful regardless of the number of visiters. I saw no plastic! There is not much to do than enjoy the meeting of the Bay of Bengal with the Indian Ocean. That itself is beautiful and an experience to be enjoyed in person. We enjoyed it more because it was a nice breezy December morning and weather was great. The beach does close at 5pm for the safety of tourists. Many devotees from the Rameshwaram temple also come to visit the beach, so don't be surprised if you see many people dressed in red or black attire."
208,very sensational and beautiful beach,It is a must visit place if you are travelling to rameswaram. 40-45 minutes journey from main city. You will find sea on both sides of you and beach is vey clean and also water is very fresh.
209,One of the must visit places during your rameswaram trip,"We went there by hiring an auto, it is around 20 kms from rameswaram. ramasethu is just near to dhanushkodi"
210,Rameswaram/ dhanuskoti ,December is a good time to visit the place. Very peaceful and calm. Perfect hangout place for family trip.
211,A scenic and historic drive ,One should not miss this Beach to experience the Cool and Breezy sea sight which is spectacular. Regular Govt bus services are available to reach this place which is cheapest compared to other mode of transport which are exorbitant.  
212,Great historical Place,"this place is breathtaking, road is in middle sea. you will discover eternal peach at this place. one side of sea is full of waves while other is calm as lake. I cannot express my feeling in words. You need to be mark your presence at this place"
213,Excellent views ,Visit the place for the remains of a city which was a habitat to humans before 1964 and also enjoy the shores in the morning and evening as waves are worth a watch during high tide.
214,A scenic road but nothing much to see.,Conglomeration of the ocean and the sea with water in various colors was indeed amazing. The beach has options of multiple vendors for finding eatables so that guests can stay long hours; this is the land's end as well
215,Sight seeing on 29 octa,"To reach Dhanushkodi,road has been built till last approachable point.Road is very well maintained.One side is ""Bay of Bengal"" and other side is Indian Ocean.Beach is good.Cleanliness is not upto the mark.Due to rains and heavy winds ,we could not stay for long time.No vehicle…"
216,What a view,I reached this place around 4 pm. Its one of the another good place to see the beach. Once side the aggressive ocean and the other side silent ocean. Spend good time. Place to see is the deserted Church and Railway station. Again place should be kept clean and garbage free. My Airtel Postpaid connection went on international roaming. so secure your phone too.
217,Wonderful Road in between SEA,A place which so beautiful that I don't have words to describe. One should visit the place whenever u get an opportunity. Amazing... picturesque...out of the world...neat and clean. A must visit
218,Two oceans meeting point,"If you are visiting Rameswaram then do not miss this beach. The beach is clean, serene and simply beautiful. i am not much of a Beach person but I fell in love with this place. The sea here is not very silent and you get large waves so be safe with small kids.  The authorities…"
219,Nice place to spend an hour,"Head to Danushkodi , if you’ve never been . I went 20 years ago and at that time you had to walk several kilometers to reach the temple ruins and beaches , later you could book Jeep rides , as recently as three weeks ago on my latest visit , Danushkodi is connected by a super…"
220,VISITING TO DANUSHKODI,It was not in our plan to go to Dhanuskodi. But we decided to go there anyway.To our surprise it was a very beautiful place.We were late and police started to tell people to go back at 4:45 pm as it closes at 5 pm.When going from Town to Dhanuskodi there were numerous small…
221,Mesmerizing,The strip of land between two mighty oceans was a sight to behold. While the Bay of Bengal was calm the shores of the Indian ocean were throwing up huge waves. Sparkling blue water and golden sands took my breath away. It was a communion with the Creator.
222,Peaceful ,"Its beautiful place and beautiful feeling. You are at tip of India and can experience two oceans. Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. You can actually see and feel the waves coming from two different directions. Now, Indian Govt has made road network this last point so it is easy to go. However keep in mind of high temperature there and make sure you carry you own water bottles there because, there is nothing available there to eat/drink."
223,Awesome,Excellent place and soothing to view. Nature at its best. Not to Miss this place. Amazing view of the sea.
224,Temple dharshan,This is very clean beach with nearly white sands and endless views . People who visit the beach throw lot of waste especially plastic which gets accumulated over time 
225,Serene experience,Dhanushkodi is definitely one of a kind place which is not just beautiful but probably few with ocean on both sides. As you drive through the narrow road your heart will totally be elated and really overwhelming. Must visit!!
226,Must visit beach,"Great place with awesome view , must visit, it’s open till 5 pm only , post which police ask everyone to leave .. The road till end point of dhanushkodi is very enjoyable "
227,Awesome,"As a part of our Rameswaram visit, we went to this beach called Dhanuskodi beach. Its about 25 KM from Rameswaram. The road is beautiful with seas on both sides. hence it looks as if one is going in the sea. The strange part is that the sea on left is silent while on the right…"
228,Great beach ,"This is one of the cleanest beach I have ever been. One can reach this beach on the way to the main Dhanushkodi point. Blue waters with no tourists, it would give you a private beach feel. A must visit place!"
229,Paradise in south india,"Cannot describe this in words, the drive till the tip of the beach is surely one of the best in the world. Ocean on both sides of the road for few kilometers is breathtaking. Do either early in the morning or late in the day."
230,Floating Stone (You cant lift it),This is a must visit place for those who come to Rameswaram. It is at a distance of around 20 km from Rameswaram and the road is metalled and smooth. Previously one could reach the beach by changing vehicles for around  4 km near the beach by truck or any four wheel drive…
231,good place to enjoy,"Waste of time and money. No development of the beach whatsoever. No restaurant, no facilities, no shed to save from harsh sun, no signages. All vehicles are stopped 1 km before the point and you hv to walk in sun. Best to avoid."
232,Must See,"This is just another dirty beach as usual in India. It has a rather nice view and location, and it is very long and narrow which is interesting, but the overall rating goes down for me because of the garbage so common in India. I am not sure if I ever seen a nice decent clean…"
233,"Serene beach , easy access, less commercial.. clean and pleasant",Nice place to visit. southern tip of india  looking  sea at both side.  on the way you can visit Kodandaramar temple where king Vibhishana ( Ravana's brother) had Pattabisheka by lord Rama. good feelings to be there. have a  good binocular to see the shore of Sri Lanka.   Even…
234,Much Hyped.. But Drive was great!,Beach was ok. You could see Bay of Bengal on one side and Indian Ocean on the other.  Water was clear and beach was clean.  Beach closes at 4:30 pm though and many of areas is restricted.
235,A serene beach,Mostly crowded through out day if you are traveling by bus i think the last bus is before 6pm as it is believed that it is risky to travel after sunset(not sure about reason) its the best Beach and must visit.
236,Blissful Morning Experience,"Very nice place, end place of the land the beaches are clean an isolated place with few shops.You can buy shells here and shankh for worship"
237,Pristine and amazing beach,"Excellent clean beach....not much crowd on weekdays....water is so clean and green ...one can see how the natural calamities destroyed this beautiful place...it's a beautiful spot for taking the pictures...best part is no commercialization ...but not suitable for swimming...the water looks very shallow but local people advise you not to venture the sea....further ahead one can see the border of India and srilanka is few km away ..one can see the merging of Indian ocean and bay of Bengal...which is quite visible from the difference in colours...And at this spot, one can enjoy the swimming ....the wavy nature of Indian ocean and the silent quiet bay of Bengal..Will advise to go earlier in the morning and in the evening"
238,Heavy,The beach is really clean and nice. But it's not allowed to take bath or swim there due to the possibility of jellyfish which can be dangerous for humans if it gets in contact with a human. But overall you will find the beach so clean and white sand. Love the place.
239,One of a kind experience ,One of cleanest beach. Almost 2-3 Kms road towards end point is covered by sea water. It is delight to be there. We visited this beach 2 times during our one visit only.
240,Ok,This was once washed by cyclone and re built . you cannot miss the sunset from here. landscape is beautiful
241,Ram setu meeting point of Indian Ocean & Bay of Bengal.,"Superb place and mesmerizing view to one side is Bay of Bengal and the other side is Indian Ocean hold hand in hand with each other an island in the middle,just 40 kms from Sri Lanka sea route and the floating stones of Ramayana is a treat to eye felt blessed to be there.must visit place in Rameswaram"
242,Wow nice place,"This is has it's beauty and you will be surprised by seeing this place. This is the place were Bay Of Bengal and Indian Ocean meets but you can see the difference clearly. A small land is dividing them, Bay Of Bengal is very calm and on other hand Indian Ocean was tidy. Someone…"
243,Beat the blues,If you wish to visit some place away from hustle bustle of city..  pristine beaches with white clean sand and amazing sunset view. You must reach there maximum by 1600h. The police starts clearing beach before high tide.
244,A must visit!,The road to this beach is a beauty in itself. ..loved the drive. The beach is super clean and great fun. .thoroughly enjoyed it. Bathing not allowed. 
245,Must See: Not just another beach because of the geographical layout,"We drove to Dhanushkodi and were very lucky that we could go right upto the end.  The road was a Sail...almost 15 km, straight as an arrow.  The beach was beautiful - though we did not swim there because the sea was a bit choppy on that day.  Looking across and imagining the Ram Sethu was a moving experience."
246,Stunning views!!,Good location we have been 4 elders and two kids under 8 year old.we stayed at Jiwan Residency location and property was great.we went to Dhanushkodi beach loved the locat8
247,Mesmerized by the sea,The drive to this place is amazing and mesmerizing. You drive with water on both sides of the road. And now with the roads open till Ram Setu...you drive literally till the end of land
248,Beauty of Nature,Need special vechicle other wise local jeebs available on rent good place sea foods available taste is good.
249,Just Wonderful ,"Very good beach, water is pure and clean, but request tourist not to throw anything in sea because it will hampper the natural habitat. Guide was good with me he took 1500 for full sight seen"
250,A Must Visit When in Rameswaram,"Seriously this place has something inside! As I crossed each spot, something was not ok. Till I came out of that place, I felt like being watched. The monument brought the hell out of me; when I saw people everyone was seem to be well known. I know that, my mind was playing games within me but couldn’t resist."
251,Dhanushkodi Beach,This is very good experience for nice and clean beach.  No many food options available at beach and it is away from main city of rameshwaram
252,Breathe taking feeling,"You must visit this edge of the state, it is so amazing with heavy windows, the old roughed up town and with the ocean on one side & the sea on the other. It is an amazing drive / ride."
253,Very good and take bath here is ausum no crowd,The trip to dhanushkodi from rameswaram was really awesome. we can drive a distance of 4-5 kms with indian ocean on one side and bay of bengal on other side of us.it is a wonderful experience. the beach is usually crowded. so we can prefer some other beaches while coming back to…
254,Interesting place with plenty of history and geographical significance,A place that keeps you calling again and again. No one should ever miss this wonder full place. From 2017 June onward new road to Dhanushkodi which is a great boon to all travelers. Now you can go their in you own vehicles. You can see the two sea joining together.  One in blue…
255,must visit for unique experience of travelling in middle of ocean,"This is an absolute must-see if you happen to be around Rameshwaram. For perhaps the first time in India, I have seen sea in turquoise blue (what we normally see in photographs of great seaside resorts of the world). There is a new, paved bkack top road that takes you to the tip…"
256,Road Trip To Dhanuskodi,I really love this place when once I saw it's beauty... It's beauty can't describe by words.. must visit this place and enjoy the nature's beauty.... Meeting point of peaceful sea( Bay of bangal) and roaring sea( Indian ocean).
257,Breathe Taking View,We visited evening. Waited there till guard ask us to leave. Such a beautiful place. Bay of Bengal tides are running towards ocean and Indian ocean tides were very smooth and meeting point of two waves that is a site to see.
258,Simply Wow. Genuine feeling of reaching the end of the road.,Over crowded and not managed properly ...... A lovely place that could and can be maint as a ideal historical and natural scenic spot .....
259,Tip of the India and near to srilanka,"Bus is available for Dhanuskodi from Rameshwaram, fare is less. You can take Bus 1B to reach this place and bus will reach end of the land area. 3km wide road and both side sea..out of the world experience, you will literally feel this place is end of the land. One side Bay of…"

261,Dhanuskodi breach ,"the beach is pictureque, but i believe it is dangerous to swim - so dont attempt that. the ruins in the backgroud gives it an attitude"
262,Loved the view ,"Great to be on a strip with sea on all sides. There are ruins of an old city you can see here, which is beautiful. You can see floating rocks in a temple: Its really heavy but still floats on water!! To go to the end of the road though, you need government permission."
263,Wonderful experience amidst ruins of a town and beautiful beech.,"I visited Rameswaram with the main purpose of visiting this place and I must say its an amazing experience in person. I drove here in my car and the last 5 miles presents you with some real, one of a kind view. I just wish the police let you walk deeper into the beach as quite a…"

265,heavenly,Simply fall in love at first sight for this place very awesome experience at this beach. very neat and clean beach. one of the best beach in india.
266,clean and serene beach,"What a wonderful beach, was glad to see it's uniqueness where not having a single resorts being built.  The views go far as the eye can see. The only disappointment was that we could not make out the Sri Lankan coastline."
267,Very Clean & End Of Indian Territory.,Surprised to get Airtel notification that I was within Airtel Srilanka. Dont know what was the Arial distance from Srilanka but the looks to be very close. Great site. Deep inside the sea except one small approach road  . One side Bay of Bengal with its great waves and other side was a  Calm  sea  bringing a combination of cool and harsh feeling. Good Road has been made by Govt with out any taxes. Suggested time 3.00 pm to 5.00 pm. It closes at 5.00 PM
268,Clean Clean Clean,"The journey on the neat and tidy road leading to the beach is truly an amazing experience. There are scenic spots along the road which serve as an apt background for photography. With beach water covering both sides of the road, one feels like being at the mid of the ocean…"
269,It was interesting to recall Ramayan,"Hey guys , I am big devotee of lord Ram so Ayodhya always attracted me as I was frequent visitor to such religious place until I had been to Rameshwaram. What to say about this place.same peaceful place as Ayodhya. State & language never matter if you are good human . Tamilnadu is such place where hardly u get someone speak Hindi but I always got good and helping people . Anyways this island in India or small tapu u can say. I did not know this is one of char dham in India which I got to know after I came back. So if you want to visit temple properly , they do puja 4 times since morning to evening. Temple is very big so it will take 4 hrs to see . There are 4 gates in temple so u May get lost if u don’t remember way. Later we went to dhanushkoti ..what a place man ☺️..place where bridge connect to Sri Lanka.. I will put some pics , you just see and realise. Then panchmukhi hanuman , we got stone which float in water and we donated some money as well. Padmanabhan bridge has rarest water colour I ever saw . Okay so Kanyakumari and Rameshwaram are in same state but water colour is different in both places. This is really magical for me. I feel to be blessed to be on earth and visit such beautiful places on planet. Guys go and enjoy. Feel nature and beauty created by god. Have fun guys,.cheers 👍👍Jai Shree Ram 🙏🙏🙏"
270,just get into the beach .. take google map and see where exactly you are standing  ..,After seeing beaches in rameshwaram I didn't expect much. But this place surprised me so much. One side is quite beach other side waves. There was a policeman saying till what place we can go to water as he said last year one kid died there.
271,Nice Place to Visit the beach,"On 30 th Dec 18, I alongwith my family reached Dhanushkodi during our trip of Rameshwaram. It is very near to Rameshwaram on the same island. Beauty of Dhanushkodi is really mesmerizing and one must visit it. Recently, road has been constructed up to last point of Dhanushkodi, where on the one side bay of bengal goes and on the other side of road, Indian ocean goes. Entire stretch of this road connecting Rameshwaram to Djanushkodi is very beautiful. lord Ram started his journey for Srilanka from this place. During last cyclone, all the structues have been damaged and now there is no permanent habitation there except some  temporary hutments of fishermen."
272,lovely beach,"Plenty of other reviews here will summarise how beautiful the beach is... Out of this world! Instead, I will give the advice that you can take a public bus from Rameshwaram Town (centre of the town, not the bus station) all the way to the beach saving you a lot of money versus hiring a jeep. They do not run regularly so you may have to wait a while to return. If you don't want to do that there are taxi options at the beach."
273,"Clean, serene and end of the land",It's may be the best beach i have ever seen. An unforgettable memory in my life. It is around 18 Kilometer away from Rameswaram. Buses are also available. 
274,Awesome straight line Drive to Dhanushkodi,"just get into the beach .. take google map and see where exactly you are standing  .. and say WOW ..that's really an amazing moment  . you are at the tip of India .20-30 KM walkable distance to Srilanka just and ocean in between . They said , on clear nights you can see lights from Srilanka .. very clear water , I never knew that we had blue beaches in India .. One of most important spot in Hindu mythology . Waves are very unpredictable  .Around 10 KM stretch road from mainland to the tip of India . One side of the road you can see calm and quite waves while the other side the waves are a bit aggressive .And every six months they interchange their behavior according to the wind direction it seems (*knowledge shared by a local guide) ."
275,Nature's Marvel in the tip of India,Wow it’s nice place. Nice beach and sand.You can spend few hours there easily but try to come there as soon as possible because later on sun is too harsh and you can walk on beach so long. Please carry your water bottle and something to eat.
276,Cool and Breezy Sea on your sides,Excellent beach parking available best place to play and relax  With beautiful scenic view.... Spent around an hour playing
277,Dhanushkodi Beach,"Such a beautiful location with mesmerizing views around. Completely a empty place, no houses, no shops, restaurants etc. at the tip of India where ram-setu (Adam's bridge) lies. Sri Lanka is just 22 KM away and if both governments allows, the trip between two countries could be just couple hours by boat. This is also Sangam of Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. The Indian ocean part was very calm while the Arabian sea was very wavy - yet it was beautiful to see around and I loved it. Unfortunately, there is no proper infrastructure to allow tourist to even take rest which I find bit disappointing. However there are some some small sheds types of local restaurants (few kilometers before the main location) which serves nice local fishes and one can take rest as well."
278,Nature's Delight for travel enthusiasts!,"Situated at the distance of 20 kms from Rameshwaram, Dhanushkodi is a very good place to visit. However, swimming is not allowed, you will experience unforgettable moments."
279,Different Terrain from all other beaches ... visited by @GhumantuBaba,Nice place to spend time with family. Clean beach and lot of place to spend time. Fresh sea food  and sea item available for purchase at reasonable price.
280,Wow,"From rameswaram you can hire vehicle or take public transport (bus) to dhanushkodi.  It’s abandoned so long ago. It got a long beach side road ride where you can enjoy the scenic view of Indian Ocean (roaring waves and light green colour water), the opposite side is Bay of…"
281,Going back into history,"This has to be the worst beach ( if i can even call it that ) i have ever visited - there were dirty diapers strewn around, an overwhelming stench of fish in the air & filth everywhere. In fact we were so depressed with the view that we did not even stop at the ruined church or…"
282,A place where road ends,I had been to this beach with my family last week which was fantastic experience.  We could see and experience the two seas Arabic ocean and bay of Bengal merging together . It was a wow feeling. Very nice road has been provided till the end of the land where we took very good…
283,Excellent place to visit...,Drive from Rameswaram to Dhanuskodi was very good. Beach at Dhanuskodi was usual ... a bit crowded. Old devastated town can be seen but may not be a must-see.
284,Amazing,"In my own experience i can provide 5/5 rating. Driver was very supportive with pleasant behaviour. we are really Happy with services,driver are patient, and so professional, If any one looking for local sight seeing and out to check all things to do in Rameshwaram you can…"
285,Air Lanka in India,I recently visited this beach with friends.The pristine beauty of the beach made me go wow.The place is full of cool breeze and crystal clear waters. One has to take his/her own vehicle to reach here.On the whole a very beautiful place to visit.
286,Clean,"We were a group of bikers and we stayed at Rameshwaram in a hotel. It was during the October month. We started our journey from Rameshwaram towards Dhanushkodi at five in the morning. Before starting, we were not too sure if this abandoned and lonely town of Dhanushkodi had…"
287,Must see places - rameshwaram,"Miles of isolated beaches, a few fishing boats, and the intriguing broken structures of this 'ghost town' gives it a unique character. It's sad to think that the town was destroyed by cyclone not very long ago. The remains have formed some interesting structures due to wind…"
288,Wonderful place,It's one of the beautiful beaches I have been to. The colours are so good and the waves are big. The endless view is so mesmerising that you will want to stay there forever. The sand is really soft and not hard and one has to be careful of this beach as we heard numerous stories…

290,Super beach,"Plan visit to get excited in a rainy day. You will be amazed and will enjoy for sure. But if you are going in a summer, plan to go early morning before 10am to escape from hot weather."
291,A different terrain,It's a very beautiful time to spend there with my lovely friends ... I love too spend time with him .

294,South end point of the country,Alright let me start off by saying this is one of the most cleanest beaches I have ever visited. On one side you can see calm relaxing waves and on the other side there is the rough nature of the Bay of Bengal. Depending on the date there is a small little gate which will let…
295,Nice beach. Closest point to Srilanka..,"The beach is soooooooo clean and the place is soooooo windy, couldnt even raise my head due to the strong gushing winds throwing sand.And what a moment when my google maps shows me standing at the last point of the Indian landmass.An amazing place that can be visited again and…"
