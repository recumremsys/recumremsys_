7,experience it yourself,"Had visited this famous gurdwara in Amritsar a long back ago. It is a popular tourist attraction and is visited by tourists as well as devotees.This gurdwara is a holy place for the Sikhs. It is known as Harminder Sahib. The main Gurdwara is covered in gold leaf which gives it a golden look. There is a sacred pond which is used for ritual bathing. The gurdwara complex has religious centers, langar etc. Inside the main gurdwara, there were bhajan singers and a holy book known as the 'Granth Sahib' enclosed in the middle. Before entering the gurdwara complex, had to remove footwear. A code of conduct should be maintained. Women have to wear scarfs and men should tie a big handkerchief on & around the heads. Had got my head tied with a handkerchief by a man and admired the golden gurudwara as a school going child. It was so calm and peaceful.This gurdwara is an ideal holy place of worship for those who would like to seek blessings. It is a must visit and should not be missed when in Amritsar."
8,A MUST SEE!,"Sri Harmandir Sahib is the official name of the Golden Gurudwara. It is in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. The Gurudwara is surrounded by a sacred pool and group of buildings important to the Sikh religion. The complex is the most important pilgrimage site in Sikhism and it is also called Darbar Sahib.Maharaja Ranjit Singh had the upper half of the building built with approximately 400 kg of gold leaf. The Golden Temple is surrounded by a number of other famous temples like the Durgiana Temple. The fourth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Ram Das, who had initially constructed a pool here, founded Amritsar, which houses the Golden Temple or Harmandir Sahib. It is here that Sage Valmiki wrote the epic, Ramayana. Rama and Sita are believed to have spent their fourteen-year exile in Amritsar, the epicenter of Sikhism. To the south of the temple is a garden, and the tower of Baba Atal. The Central Sikh Museum is atop the Clock Tower. The ‚ÄòGuru Ka Langar‚Äô offers free food to around 20,000 people every day. The number shoots up to 100,000 on special occasions. A visitor must cover his / her head before entering the temple premises. The Granth Sahib is kept in the Temple during the day and is kept in the Akal Takht or Eternal Throne in the night. The Akal Takht also houses the ancient weapons used by the Sikh warriors. Guru Hargobind established it. The rugged old Jubi Tree in the North West corner of the compound is believed to possess special powers. It was planted 450 years ago, by the Golden Temple‚Äôs first high priest, Baba Buddha. Guru-ka-Langar or the communal canteen is towards the eastern entrance of the temple complex, and it provides free food to all visitors, regardless of colour, creed, caste or gender. Visitors to the Golden Temple must remove their shoes and cover their heads before entering the temple. The temple is less crowded in the early mornings on weekends. The temple surroundings are immensely clean and kudos to the kar sevaks who make sure that the temple surroundings remain spic and span."
9,WONDERFUL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE WITH UTMOST PEACE OF MIND !,"Golden temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib is an incredibly divine place to visit. It is not only a delight to the eyes but has the devotional spirit and positive vibes flowing in there. It is so peaceful that You definitely feel connected to God. The hygiene practice at the temple is commendable- proper shoe lockers, cleanliness in the temple and around the temple and the system to enter the temple is so well managed. The Sikh people continuously volunteer to ensure that the temple is kept clean at all times. Very pleased with the management, and of course, felt divine and peaceful throughout the time spent there. In fact, with the divine spirit within, one can spend hours and hours inside, and yet not feel like leaving the temple premises."
10,Walking distance from Hotel Grand Sawera. Amazing Golden Temple. Free food served 24 hrs and the golden dome surriounded,"Harmandir Sahib(Golden Temple) is a Holiest Temple in Amritsar, Punjab.

12,My favorite place in India,"From April 10th to April 17th, I visited Amritsar in Punjab and experienced the wonderful festival of Baisakhi! For those of you that don‚Äôt know, Baisakhi is the festival which celebrates Sikh New Year and the founding of the Sikh community in 1699, known as the Khalsa. On the 13th and 14th the festival took place and it was a marvellous sight. I had to wake up early in the morning to witness Amrit Sanskar, an initation ceremony for Sikhs into the Khalsa and it was magical to see lifelong Sikhs achieve a dream of theirs to become a member of the Khalsa. For two days straight after Baiskahi, there‚Äôs a non-stop reading of the Guru Granth Sahib, otherwise known as an akhand path. Not going to lie, as an atheist, I did find it slightly boring myself however the devotion in everyone‚Äôs else faces was quite remarkable. I celebrated Baisakhi by taking part in the festivities. I played a game of Cricket and Kabaddi, an Indian Sport which was very fun and left me with a ton of sand in my mouth! There was also some Bhangra dancing which I found really fun and enjoyable. Overall, I think Baisakhi is a marvellous spectacle. It may be boring in parts if you are not a Sikh, however all in all it‚Äôs something I believe everyone should experience and rejoice with,"
13,An awe-inspiring visit exhibiting the best of humanity,Harmandir Sahib is a sacred place not only for Sikhs but for all humanity. It is place to redetermine our faith in humanism as preached by all the ten Gurus. It was so mesmerising that we visited in the morning as well in the night
14,Beautiful and serene,The time you enter the golden temple(Harminder sahib) you feel so relaxing. All Volunteers are in so discipline. Just sit nearby to a pond and listen to kirtan.
15,Unbelievable  Peace Amidst All the Crowded Chaos,This is the most holiest place of worship for Sikhs in India. The gurudwara is beautifully lit up in the evening. It is open everyday from 4.00 am to 10.00 pm.
16,Peacful place!,"My visit to Amritsar was purely to visit the Golden Temple, the visit totally moved me, it‚Äôs a haven that is full of peace and serenity. We went on the first day around 3pm and it was very busy. It was amazing, I shall never forget the moment I reached the temple. I found it extremely emotional and moving. Our second visit was a 5am, again a totally mesmerising visit, we watched the sunrise as we queued to get into the temple. I feel so blessed that I have visited the Golden Temple, can‚Äôt wait to go back üôèüèºüôèüèº"
17,by night and in the morning light,"The holy of holies of Sikhism. It was an awesome experience visiting this magnificent temple. I came both day and night, but the latter is much better when the temple is beautifully lit up."
18,Baisakhi is Incredible at Amritsar!,11of us travelled to Amritsar by taxies to visit the Golden Temple. What an amazing welcoming place everyone of us was overwhelmed by it. The centre of Amritsar itself was lovely and very  colourful. I would thoroughly recommend a visit here.
19,one of the cleanest places in India!,"Harmandir sahib, also known as the golden temple is the centre of sikh faith, in India and across the world. The temple is in the centre of amrit sarovar. The central sanctum of the temple is a two storeyed building and is covered with gold. Around the lake, there are various important buildings of historical importance in the sikh faith. The temple looks very beautiful in the evening. A must visit if you are in India."
20,Truly Amazing ,Golden Temple is located in Amritsar in India. It is a very beautiful temple of Sikhs. It should be visited.
21,Wonderful experience of Sikhism Panth,"The main reason that we visited Amritsar was to visit the Golden Temple and it beyong rating. Our taxi driver acted as our guide and without him we would perhaps not have experienced all the facets of the Temple. We made our devotions in the holy pool, queued and  walked through the Temple,saw the food being prepared and then took part in eating (langar) with the other pilgrims who were almost all Indians.Our taxi driver was excellent and it was the experience of a lifetime."
22,Breath taking...,Golden Temple is the main reason for our visit to Amritsar... Try to stay close to the Golden Temple complex so that you can visit Golden Temple in the night... It is a divine experience to see the temple all lit up.In the night you cannot go to the inner sanctum sanctorum but the night time experience is divine.We went again in the morning and had langar which should not be missed.The temple also hosts a Museum of Sikh History and should not be missed.The langar is a community kitchen which serves food to all the people who visit the temple and is a divine experience.Go there and be blessed.
23,Incredible faith,The place is so neatly managed by the followers of Babaji. From the walkway to access the Golden Temple untill the Darbar Sahib it's an experience worth waiting in the long que of worshippers.People from across India. And the world were enjoying the Harmandir Sahib experience
24,Absolute divinity! ,Whenever i am on my business Trip to Sri Amritsar Shaib I always Visit This Place Alone to Remove Stress From my mind I visit this place Every 2 months . Approx 5-6 times a Year. The Golden Temple is just 10 min by walk away From Amritsar Bus stand. And approx 2 km from Amritsar railway Station. Due to busy road all time so Go early in morning. Better to book a hotel near by Golden Temple.
25,Stunning,"Nobody can visit this temple and not be moved by being surrounded by thousands of Sikhs paying homage at their most holy place.The spirituality exuded by the devotees even affected a hardened atheist like me.   This is not a place just to visit and see, despite being as beautiful a building and location as it's possible to find on this planet.And the huge scale of the food halls providing tens of thousands of free meals every day to anyone and everyone shows a 'giving' religion.India has thousands of buildings worthy of visit. But some places, and particularly  at the Golden Temple, you 'experience' India.We are India regulars.  But the Golden Temple made an impact on us."
26,Beautiful,"Majestic. Serene. Soothing. Full of positive energy.Amritsar is golden temple. Whenever one visit, do have the langar sewa. It brings out the spirit of service towards humanity and develops humility in one self"

30,Spectacular,It is so peaceful when the verses from the Granth Sahib are being read and sung. Walk around the temple and go the library. The best time to enter the temple is before 8am if you want to bow before the Granth Sahib
31,Beautiful,"Golden temple is nice place to visit. A must to visit in Amritsar. I visited the place recently and it was an amazing experience. Amritsar is cooler than Paris. It was an overcast evening with temperature 2*C but as the sun set and lights lit up, it was a spectacle to behold. It is the holy shrine worshiped by the Sikhs globally and it is open to all people irrespective of their religion. 1. Wearing turban cloth is mandatory for all and is easily available locally. 2. You have remove your footwear for which Temple management has counters to take care of the same. If you are in groups, ask for a gunny bag to keep your footwear together. It was a peaceful and religious experience for me.Please have the 'Halwaa' (Sheera made of pure ghee). It is offered by the Committee to all after coming out of the shrine. It is sweet and healthy. Please have it.Overall nice experience."
32,nice place,Golden temple is the prime place for worship for Sikhs and all religions are welcomed to the premises
33,Up there with the Taj Mahal and real.,"The Golden Temple is one of the highlights of Amritsar, of India even, and rightly so. The entire temple complex is huge, super busy, and one of the cleanest and most peaceful places that I have ever been to. The people there, from the visitors to the volunteers are immensely helpful and sweet. The temple itself is wonderful and awe-inspiring, but the langar and the devotion with which volunteers give their time and effort is something that I have never experienced before. I would recommend taking lots of time in hand and volunteering your own time as well. If possible, make the time to visit the temple during the day as well as in the evening/ at night to see it all lit up."
34,Mesmerizing,"We visited Amritsar in December 2019 and stayed for 3 days, had complete blessing from Wahe Guru Nanakji including getting a berry fruit under the holy berry tree inside Golden Temple, many many darshans of Golden temple and taking multiple times Langar inside Golden Temple and realized we are totally blessed by Baba Guru Nanak ji"
35,More then one visit!,"Worth every penny we spent on our independent trip to visit the Golden Temple at Amritsar. The Temple itself is very busy yet despite the hustle and bustle we found the surroundings serene.  We visited the Temple at 20:30 in the evening to witness the sacred book being taken to its overnight resting place and again the next day to see more. Our guide Ami was very knowledgable and showed us the kitchens where they prepare and serve over 30,000 free meals a day. Everyone is welcome. A must visit site if you are ever in India"
36,Stunning!,"In 2015, we‚Äôve visited many places in India, but our visit to the Golden Temple, in Amritsar, was by far one of the most special. Our guide, Preet, who became a beloved friend, made our tour very special. He took us to see the sunset in the Golden Temple... This ended up being my favorite place in India! And I‚Äôm sure part of the reason for that is because Preet is a unique guide, dedicated and full of knowledge. We finished our tour with a delicious dinner and, until today, after 5 year, we wear a Sikh bracelet that Preet gave us. I‚Äôll never forget what he told us: ‚Äúthese are for you to remember to came back here‚Äù. And we hope we will soon! Thank you, Destiny India Travels! üôèüèº"

46,"Wonderful place,","Regenta Central in Amritsar is just superb and guess just five mins away from GOLDEN TEMPLE!Just remember my Waheguru and offer prayers , be a helping hand termed as ""SEVA"" to others."
47,"Surreal, Enchanting and Heavenly","I had two wonderful days in the golden temple of amritsar. In the evening of the First day by random I met Varinder Nashid (Winni), a volunteer in the temple. He showed me the whole temple with all its buildings, even though, naturelement, the golden temple. There we got easy access without long waiting time. Very impressing was a glance behind the scenery. Hi showed me the preparing of the food by hundreds of volunteers, the gigantic huge pots for boiling and cooking, underneath were big fire ovens, in which other volunteers packend huge amount of fire wood, not small bricks as you would image, no, big ones as trunk of trees. Yes, and in fact, the they put big trunks into the big ovens.The langer hall is one of the places where the visitor get their meal, which is for free, but it is more or less intensively exspected to spend some money. Even though a very great number of visitors has been there the atmosphere is quiet and peaceful.The volunteers are friendly and helpful so i enjoyd it very much. Tank You Varinder !!"

Don‚Äôt miss the biggest free kitchen in the world that feeds 100 thousand people daily, open 24/7 .getting in only barefoot and with a scarf on the head ."
53,Awesome ,The most important site for Sikhism. Bustling with people all the time. The langar here is must have if visiting Amritsar.
54,Peace and Tranquil,Spent an interesting morning at this holiest of places for Sikhism. Really impressive construction and the social work carried out here by volunteers is something to behold. We were very impressed for the organised way everything is done and how caring and spiritual the environment is.

Very clean and peaceful.This is the holy place for the Sikh community but we noticed there were people from all religions and countries.One must eat the food they serve free at the temple.The night visit is a must goThere are large ques but we'll managed and move quickly however recommend to go with a guide who will show and explain in detail.Our guide ravish was excellent.It's a 2 hour visit. The local markets around the temple also very interesting.
56,Sublime!,Ek Onkar Satnam. My favourite place in this world. No words to describe how peaceful and joyous I feel as always at this place.
57,Holy Place,"If anyone visits Amritsar without intending to see the Golden Temple . . .well, there must be something wrong. The centre of the Sikh religion is a must-see in India and does not disappoint.  Make sure you have a head cover, be comfortable in bare feet (there are storage facilities for shoes), and try to come early.  The crowds start to grow quickly in the morning and don't seem to let up in the evening.  So see the inside of the temple early in the morning, and the outside in both daylight and at night.  A magnificent sight, especially at night.It is also worthwhile to visit the kitchens where thousands of people are served food, without charge, every day.We are not Sikh, but it was clear that this is a special place."
58,Humbling and Awe Inspiring,"1. We boarded the bus from Delhi at night and reached Amritsar in morning. You can take a e-rickshaw from bus stand, 10rs per person. 2. Deposit your shoe and bags free of cost and go inside the temple. 3. Temple is very beautiful, and crowd is managed quite well. 4. You can go for the darshan. It will take 2-3 hrs depending on people there. After that take prasad from inside. It is 50/100rs only. 5. If you have some time, plan for langar in golden temple. Amazing food. 6. It will be afternoon till you are finished with all this. You can now go to wagah/ Attri border retreat ceremony. 7. And jaliawala bagh is next to golden temple."
59,The Golden Temple is a pleasant and peaceful place in Amritsar.,"The abode of God, well Maintained, Its a must when visiting amristar, the world heritage site, incredible at night all lit up."
60,Day trip to famous Golden Temple,"This is one of the iconic places to visit in North India.  The temple is beautiful but extremely crowded on weekends.  You will have to walk a lot and fights the crowds.  If you plan to go inside the temple, then go on a weekday and not on a weekend.  The langar (where they serve free meals) is worth just seeing even if you do not want to eat there."
61,Well worth a visit,"Everything is just so pure n divine at this holy place. The Golden Temple, beautiful lake with colourful fish sights, kda prasad, langer.All managed so well."
62,Place exudes peace and calmness.  ,"THE place to visit in Amritsar, no doubt.Superlatives r less to describe the sanctity & the way it has been preserved."
63,Peace and calm,"Golden Temple. Without any doubt, is one of the most serene places in India and the World. The vibes you get after just setting your foot in this place can't be put into words. One of the most likable thing about this place is, it's sevaks(people serving this place). Sevaks are all humble and friendly here. This place doesn't discriminate between faiths and race, anybody can visit this place disregard their religion or ethnicity. This place is filled with love, peace, and harmony. While visiting Langar(Mass Food Canteen), it was all about the unity of the sevaks, they don't charge for their service and they do it for the community. I salute the spirit of Our Sikh Brothers! I'll always remember their hospitality."
64,Great Legacy kept alive by a great community ,"The Golden Temple is very important to Sikhs; similar to Mecca for Muslems or the Vatican for Roman Catholics.  However, you don't have to be a Sikh to be impressed by the Temple and its surrounding complex.  We visited during the day and thought it was spectacular and went back in the evening and, with the lights, it was even more spectacular.With over 100,000 visitors a day, the Golden Temple is a very busy place.  The ""langer"", or community kitchen, provides free meals to anyone who wants one 24 hours a day - about 100,000 meals a day.Visiting requires a bit of a hike because vehicles are not permitted in the area surrounding the complex.  Then, it's shoes and socks off as the visit will be barefoot.  The temple is in the middle of a large pool that is surrounded by associated buildings.  A visit to the interior of the Golden Temple will require joining a very long line that could require one or two hours before a brief visit.  That's in addition to walking around the complex to enjoy its wonderful exterior appearance.  Allow 1 - 2 hours for a visit plus the time required to stand in line if you want to enter the Golden Temple.  We were more than satisfied with our viewing of the complex without joining the line to enter the temple."
65,Terrific,The view of the Palki arriving and the devotees thronging to get a place near it was so pious. The atmosphere around was very soothing
66,Must see place .,One of the most interesting facts about the Golden Temple is that it‚Äôs foundation stone was laid by a Muslim Saint Even the Britishers sought blessings for victory in the Golden TempleIt welcomes people irrespective of their religious orientationsThe Golden Temple attracts more people than the Taj Mahal
67,Fantastic place of worship,Visited this place on new year. Beautifully built. Stayed here and worshipped for few hours. Construction is amazing. Shops nearby are decorative.

71,Serene tranquility,This is such a lovely spiritual place. The golden temple is breathtaking especially at night. We ate at the langur which was incredible and so humbling. Highly recommend a visit.
72,"Serene, peaceful, holy, beautiful","Definitely humbling but absolutely awe inspiring to visit The Golden Temple and gain insight to The Sikh Religion. To see the many volunteers working to supply visitors with food or perform services around this amazing and beautiful site, truly humbling."
73,Holy Delight,golden temple is a paradise on earth. everyone should visit this place. in words is difficult to explain. it is most beautiful worship place
74,A beautiful spiritual experience,"Only one word ""Incredible"". On any given day there are thousands of devotees visit this temple. Despite being religious temple , the pace is so clean and for that hats off to the management."
75,Heaven on Earth,Visited the Golden Temple during our recent trip to Amritsar.We went with another english couple from our hotel who were both Sikh's which was helpful as they were able to explain the specifics of the religion.We queued to go through the temple and spent a couple hours there taking in the moment and the ambience and feel of the temple.Definately worth a visit
76,Holy Visit,"Were fortunate enough to visit here at night to experience the palki sahib ceremony and then again the following day to see the food being prepared to feed upto 100,000 people every day free of charge. Very moving experience and such a beautiful setting."
77,Culture at its best,"This was my second and my wife's third visit for Darshan .To avoid unprecedented rush on Guru Nanak's 550th birth date, visited a week after (On week day) and had normal crowd every where from Delhi .Since lots of reviews share almost same Stay at Ramada Amritsar was excellent . Since most reviews have repetation , I am sharing exceptions only :1)  Avoid darshan between 6 and 6:30 PM, when evening special prayer done. Try to be slightly early and you can sit down during this prayer.Otherwise ,We were in the middle of the Que,standing still for this additional half an hour, as entry was stopped. Very very straing for senior citizens like us.  2) While coming back in the Swarn Satabdi  in afternoon ,felt like we are still in the same environment of Sri Harminder Sahib. Were in Coach 14 and after start  realised we are with a group of devotees who visit every month 3rd Tuesday from Delhi and come back on Wednesday. They transformed the Coach 13 to a kirtan place and we had live telecast of it in C12, C13 & C14 . In addition, All passengers in these coaches were continuously  served  with excellent quality snacks,drinks and dinner( even to those who are not in the group devotees) ,with no return expectation . Like us,almost every one refused Railway food and engrossed in the Kirtan. This continued almost till the end . We thanked to the Group organisors  This trip will last in our memory for this factor also"
78,Incredible temple ,"A visit to Harminder Sahab aka the Golden Temple has been on my list for a very long time. So we decided to visit it on a winter weekend thinking it would be the best to visit and it turned out to be a great decision. We reached the temple around 8am and stood in the queue for no longer than 30 minutes and were inside the temple. 30 minutes is the lowest you would spend given my friends had visited earlier and had to wait for about 3.5 hours one time.The temple has 2 upper storeys as well. They won't allow you to stay on the lower ground for a very long time unless you get a place in the limites deating that is avaiable inside. But you can easily find a spot on the first floor and look at the granth sahib and listen to the holy prayers from above. You can also sit and retrospect in peace on the second floor. Since it was a cool winter morning, we enjoyed sitting in the sun for sometime. There are two parallel queues to enter the temple. The one on the right side is faster than the left. The only difference is that the queue on the left enters the temple from the front while the one from the right, which is faster too enters from the right side of the temple. But they are basically the same since you get the same view. So we preferred the right queue. If you are visiting with small kids, you can always tell the sevadars/people handling the queues and they would help you in avoiding the queues.Facilities for bathing are available for both men and women. Langar is available 24x7 and I would highly recommend that. The complex is incredibly clean and hygenic.The multilevel car parking facility is just a 5 minutes walk from the temple. So you can easily park your vehicle there and walk towards the temple. Battery rickshaws also operate in the distance and one can avail those facilities too."
79,It is much more than .....GOLDEN  TEMPLE,"Absolutely remarkable place for worship unbelievable patience for devotees from the volunteers.. no pushing/ shoving at the sanctum sanctorum, despite very high turn out of people. Visited temple 6 times in almost 3 days at different times.. it was the same. Also, cleanliness and hygiene was mind blowing"
80,Incredible spiritual experience,"I am a young Punjabi Woman born and bred in London. I have visited the golden temple in the past when very young,and remember the experience being lovely with my Nan and family. This time it was different I had taken my Fiance there for the first time. Walked around and had langar with my whole family. We took pictures and after taking a selfie we were surprisingly stopped by one of the sevadars (helpers/staff) and told abruptly and rudely to delete the selfie. I asked why? And he replied because I did not have my scarf on my head. I was confused because I did. So I looked back at the picture and showed it to him and he still disagreed. (I took the picture from above and mine and my partners head was tilted slightly back, so in the picture it looked as if I hardly had my scarf on but you can clearly still see it on my head!?) So he stands there and is very intimidating. I refused to delete it because he was wrong. He then puts his hands on the phone, and tries to take it off me. My partner intervened and said we will delete it. So this made me very upset and frankly angry. He ruined the whole day for us, we were so happy when we went in and then that happened and it was all a shock. This young mans attitude was so shocking, I said he had no right to speak to visitors in this manner and should learn some respect as his working in such a sacred and respectable place. This was not the end. We continued to walk,and as he didn't like my confidence in speaking my mind and giving my opinion as a young woman he began to follow us while we were walking inside. We got to the end of the temple, and almost at the exit, where there was two other senior staff members standing. I knew at this point he wanted to go and complain about me. So I let him walk before me and say what he wanted. I then followed after him and said please explain the situation properly don't just say we refused to delete a picture. So I explained the whole situation from the beginning and he still had the nerve to continue to debate and show a dirty attitude even in front of his seniors. I clearly said to them all just because you are given the job of taking care of this sacred place does not give you the right to demand or show aggression, power and authority to innocent people and situations. I did not know or understand what he had against us, but he clearly has an issue. I am Indian Punjabi and my Fiance is European. I am a very spiritual person and respect all places of god and worship. This was a horrible and embarrassing situation for us all. This sevadar (the young staff memeber) began to point his finger at me and threatened for me to be quiet,raising his voice. This made my partner very uncomfortable and he did not understand punjabi or what was happening but just noticed his aggressive behaviour. My partner stepped in the middle as he thought he was going to approach me or get closer. The other senior staff members also held him back and told him to calm down. They had there hands together and asked us for forgiveness. It was too late. I already made up my mind that I would never step foot in that place again. And I said it too. I dont agree with this behaviour and no one should have to go through it. I told them to teach their staff some manners and to remind them that they are working in a holy place and that type of mentality or attitude is not something they should be showing visitors. So today I saw pictures of the Indian actress (Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh) her husband visit there too for their anniversary. Now the amount of hair on her head showing was a lot more than what mine was in the picture I took, yet this whole fuss was made by this ONE man. Im assuming no one bothered her about her hair showing because she's a famous actress right? What rubbish. Not only this. My sister and her husband also visited a year ago, and were told to also delete a picture they had both taken because apparently he was holding her by her waist? I have seen so many pictures of visitors and tourists couples and families do this,but why was it a issue this time? I also believe in the power of treating people with respect,if any of these two men working at the Golden Temple had better manners and a little more respect in how to come across to a Woman and speak to her,I could have handled that situation better myself by just staying calm and actually deleting it. But by the way he approached me and my family he straight away had a major issue with something. What it was I will never know. But this ONE MAN changed our experience there once and for all. I will never visit again unfortunately due to rude staff like him who ruin peoples experiences and family time. The place itself is beautiful,it is unfortunate and sad that they have hired young men like that one who forgot where he was for a minute and what he is actually getting paid or not getting paid to do. My partner and myself will never forget that experience. This is really something the Golden Temple staff should be aware of and take seriously amongst their staff, as we all know word gets around and if it continues this way foreigners and tourists and visitors will stop coming; we are all the people contributing to the economy in Amritsar and the Golden Temple. This would be so sad to see drop if people begin to feel like they are being treated wrongly in such a famous,sacred,holy place like that. I again want to say that this was my experience and I am like every other person who wanted to visit pay my respects and show my family around. This was a horrible experience and one I will never forget."
81,A MUST visit even if you have to go to Amritsar just for that,"Nice place to visit in Amritsar,  it is very peaceful place. After visiting the temple you will find that your mind become very peaceful."
82,HOLY SITE IN THE WORLD,If you think all Gurudwara are same. Then you may not be right. Off course all religious places have an aura but this place is truly magical. I have been to this place 3 times in last 3 years and with every visit I feel there is more to this place. From 15 mins to 3 hrs and still I feel I need to spend more time here. The feeling of serving others before thinking of oneself is outstanding here. And the cleaniness is unmatched. It's impossible for a place to maintain itself with the kind of footfall it has and also to serve people like the way they do. The Khada Prasad is available from 3 am in the morning till 9 pm in night and the place is open through the night. So miss to eat the free meal here called the Langar
83,Early morninh @ Golden temple,"Serene , peaceful and a great experience.Must visit the temple kitchens that serve Langar ( free meals ) - the largest in the world .Seeing the temple complex lit by night is a must do ."
84,the best place,Heaven at earth. Best place for inner Peace. Amazing views specially on evening time. Everyone should visit this place to feel its positive vibes. Free Langar (food) facility available for 24 hrs.
85,Bliss,"After 15 yr I am visiting golden temple and was in complete awe. The place has developed so well. All city local attractions such as golden temple, partition museum and Jallianwala bagh are connected so well. In one day a persons can visit all three locations, can do shopping and have food."
86,Don‚Äôt miss ! A great outstanding attraction ,"The serene Golden temple with it's surrounding and it's people and hospitality are a must visit for every Indian. Our 2 yr old was wailing and after waiting patiently for 1.5 hrs, the aged gentlemen in our line asked us to go ahead in the line. The courteous devotees were kind enough to let us through although otherwise we would prefer to wait in queue. The entire place is warm and so peaceful. Must visit"
87,Simply awesome. Definitely recommended. ,"Must experience the morning prayers. Having said that, you should see the temple during the day time as well- it is a different experience.Morning time, you should leave around 3AM. Had a wonderful experience. You will feel the power of the temple. People are so polite and doing sewa everywhere. Will surely visit again."
88,Day trip,"Calm, peaceful place, situated at the centre of the town.  Do visit all the three floors of the temple.Queue to go inside the temple varies and mostly takes an hour, so plan accordingly"
89,Favorite Temple in India! ,This religious place requires no reviews actually. The hotel complex is very well maintained and is very clean. I am blessed that I managed to pay my visit to Satnam Waheguru Ji.
90,amazing and atmospheric,"Peace, peace and peace, this is what we want these days and Harminder Sahib Ji is one of the spiritual places where you can get this. Sit and relax there for a while whenever you come."
91,Stunning temple,I visit the Golden Temple now 6 times in different seasons and years. I feel always awesome and it is poignant.
92,Sikh and You Shall Conquer ,"Magical, Peaceful, Bliss, Divine...no words to describe beauty, vibe and peace of this Holy Monument."
93,Wow place ,"Sikhs around the world must be so proud for their legacy having golden temple. . Always a wonderful experience to visit this place. Beautiful monument and even more beautiful people, serving mankind irrespective of their class , creed and religion. . More than 75000 people are fed here without a single question. Most of the work done here is by hundreds of devoted volunteers. . Amaizing üëåüëå"
94,Amazing..!!,"Sikh culture is so beautiful, we felt so welcomed and really enjoyed the lunch provided in the Langar hall."
95,Outstanding,This is the main attraction of Amritsar and is a peaceful place to be at.The place is very clean and the water is very pure.Saw very big colorful fishes in the pond.We went on saturday and the place was very crowded specially if you have to visit the main golden part between the pond.It also also offer prasad .
96,"Beautiful, Divine, breathtaking ,etc...","It was my great experience to visit the Golden Temple...The Golden Temple is well-known throughout the world as the supreme religious place of Sikhism. There are four gates here which are reflective of the fact that the doors of Sikhs are open to people of every religion. The structure of the gurudwara is very beautiful. Gurudwara made of marble and gold is a symbol of very amazing art. The environment here is very clean and tidy. Followers of Sikhism serve the devotees who come here with a lot of heart. Thousands of people take food in Prasad every day in the Guru's langar here.Sri Harimandir Sahib (Golden Temple) has four gates. One of these gates is by Guru Ram Das Sarai. There are many rest places in this inn. Along with the resting places, the langar runs here for twenty-four hours, in which one can receive the offerings. There are many shrines in Sri Harimandir Sahib. Of these, the Berry tree is also considered a place of pilgrimage. It is known as Ber Baba Budha. It is said that when the Golden Temple was being built, Baba Budha ji was sitting under this tree and was monitoring the construction work of the temple."
97,"spectacular by day, more spectacular at night",The place is so peaceful and beautify. When we visited there was a huge queue to visit inside the temple. But must say it is worth watching
98,Must visit place in Punjab ,Great place and must to visit in Amritsar. Peaceful and disciplined. Heavy crowded during the weekends.
99,Blissful!!,"We visit before vaishno devi, so it was full day impact and enjoyed a lot. We visit Golden Temple before sunrise and realy we experienced beauty of temple. We also served for 'Langar', we are pleased."
100,Out of this world,Golden Temple is the place to go before you die. Holy place to be in. Great tourist guide. I have been here many times. God bless
101,peaceful with positive vibes,We attended the evening ceremony with the guide and witnessed the incredible care and attention given to the Granth Sahib.We  returned in the morning and saw the temple in more detail together with the langar hall. It is wonderful to see what arrangements are made to look after all the pilgrims.The building is magnificent to see - the gold really shines on the sun.There is a foot wash to go through on entry but it did little to reduce the obvious presence of unwashed feet  when the crowds are large.
102,Impressive,Feel blessed at the entrance itself. Sikhs are serving water taking care of shoes. There is a carpet path from shoe drop to temple. Recommend to stay in this place from late noon will sunset. Just change of  color and its reflection in water is a lifetime experience.
103,Holiest Temple,"An amazingly beautiful temple complex. Though its quite busy, tranquil spots can be found easily as it's huge. Very clean ( important to know since you have to go barefoot).If you want to witness the carrying of the Holy Book to and from the Akal Takht, then the best time to visit is late evening. We went in at 8:30 so we could get a ""Darshan"" of the Guru Granth Sahib inside the Golden Temple and then after doing a ""parikrama"" along the outside walkway, we positioned ourselves very close to the building where the Book is taken to its resting place for the night.The next day our guide took us to the ""langar"" kitchens. It was fascinating to see how much food was prepared and served by volunteers.And on the third day we just sat and absorbed the peace and beauty inspite of the many people walking about since most were in awe of the place."
104,A place full of peace and harmony,A very clean and peaceful environment.  The movement of people around the sanctum is very organised ( no pushing and shoving). Very helpful guides around the place to advise and direct. Very happy that we made a visit to this pilgrimage centre.
105,Very soothing experience,Awesome divine place for people from all religions. One need to visit twice to observe the beauty of this temple one in day time & second on evening. The visit is incomplete unless have langer here.....too delicious
106,Blessfull Place,Awesome place to visit. It is holy place that is so beautiful I would suggest that you visit this temple in night
107,Calm in the midst of crowd ,"The surrounding area around the Golden Temple is best managed by the authorities and hence the flow to the Temple is the most regulated one. Everybody comes in the queue, in discipline, and in good mood. There is a free well-managed service for keeping shoes, chappals. There are adequate counters and the same are managed by adequate well-trained persons. There is no rush, no pushing, no hurry, no authoritative attitude. Its only Faith, Service,Humanity, Discipline, No amount of appreciation can do justice to what the temple authorities perform in their duties to the faithful. Everything is clean, pure, and all sanctity is maintained at all levels. Persons of all faiths come but there is no discrimination, no partiality, no preference, everything is conducted in an orderly manner. You get water, food as prasad, and every care is taken in every manner and in every respect. Faithfuls observe the sanctity, discipline, cleanliness, and there is no need to interfere in the matter. And inside the sanctum sanctorum, you get the Bliss and Peace of mind that cannot be expressed in words or feelings. Compared with Mumbai Ganpati Darshan or Vaishno Devi Darshan the flow of faithfuls is managed in the best manner. I would love to visit the Golden Temple whenever I happen to visit Amritsar. Nice spiritual experience with utmost peace of mind."
108,Fascinating place,I have visited this holy place many a times but the last visit on 31 Dec 2019 was some thing unique. Visited with family to seek blessings for the new year. No words to express the happiness. A PLACE MUST BE VISITED WAHE......GURU... JI  DA KHALSA... WAHE.....GURU  JI  DI FATEH
109,Phwoarrr,The most sacred place on this earth where we get inner peace.Good crowd management.Whenever you will go to amritsar its the place where you must go.Waheguru meher kri
110,Visit at night is magical ,"The entire gurudwara,it‚Äôs management, the cleanliness and above all the serenity and tranquility one gets visiting this place is unbelievable. Although the queues are long but worthy the wait. There are separate queues for people with young children. We spent 4-5 hours there. Don‚Äôt miss it in the night. It‚Äôs even more serene"
111,amazing,"The temple is loocking so so beautiful and good,nice temple in punjab,the temple is big and beautiful creatures."
112,Nearby ,this is the most peaceful place i have been to in my entire life and sikhism seems to be very interesting religion to get the knowledge about.
113,Must visit,"Amazing place to seek peace and blessings. What is more amazing is knowing that the number of foot fall per day is more than one can ever imagine still it's clean and bathrooms are something that every public monuments should learn from them how to keep the washroom clean inspite of lakhs of people using it. I feel no place on the planet can match this place in terms of peace , cleanliness and how you are treated inside the gurudawara."
114,Must be in Amritsar,"Let us get straight to the point ‚Äì your religious affiliations kept completely aside, Golden Temple is brilliant & mesmerizing ‚Äì and a must visit place. If I try to remember the iconic tourist places in India, then obviously the Taj Mahal is clearly #1. My place of birth ‚Äì Kolkata ‚Äì and its Victoria Mahal would also be in the list. Delhi with its plethora of monuments including India Gate, Lotus Temple, Red Fort, Akshardham Temple ‚Äì as a tourist destination would be there (this is different issue that being a resident of NCR, my review contributions of Delhi is pitiful ‚Äì may be a 2020 resolution). Also, it would be quite fair to put the Golden temple in the league of brilliant places one must visit in India.The brilliance of the place is due to myriad and complex factors at play ‚Äì not limited to the religious under currents that one associates with a temple. For starters, the wide pedestrian-only access leading to the temple allows one to soak in the cultural heritage of the place. On both sides of the pedestrian zone, one can see numerous shops selling local stuff that range from Amritsari jooti (sandals), to ear rings, and numerous other knick-knacks. The fa√ßade of the place is consistent with homogenous design ‚Äì to such an extent that the Mcdonalds signage gets camouflaged in the background.One reaches the entrance of Golden temple ‚Äì after about 8-10 minutes of walk from Ranjit Singh chowk where the car parks are located. Remarkably, one common problem that tourists face in any famous temple is that of quacks and thugs trying to fleece you ‚Äì however, in the couple of times we went to this temple, we faced no such problems whatsoever. In fact, one incident warrants particular mention. There were number of hawkers selling ear rings ‚Äì and there was this gentlemen with a small suitcase with very limited collection of stuff waiting for his turn. Warmed to his (mis) fortunes, especially when our family was buying ear rings in truck loads, I approached the man and asked him if he was not upset with state of affairs ‚Äì to which he politely said ‚Äì God shall take care of me. No wonder this was Golden Temple in Amritsar ‚Äì a place where a Langar (community kitchen) runs 24 hours ‚Äì and we are told about 75,000 people have free food there DAILY ‚Äì possibly the biggest such community food service in the world. With limited staff manning the kitchen, there are number of voluntary sevaks (care givers who donate their work free for community welfare). After leaving our footwear and collecting a token (again no fees are involved here), we entered the Temple ‚Äì after stepping through a small pool of water to wash our feet. The temple inside was brilliant, mesmerizing and paradoxical. ‚ÄúBrilliant‚Äù because of its sheer expanse and its architecture. In fact, some of the views from high above made the temple look even more fascinating.‚ÄúMesmerizing‚Äù because of the exquisite Golden Glow of the temple seated at the center of Amrit Sarovar (Lake of Nectar or Lake of Holy water), also from where the name of city was possibly derived. The lake was presumed to carry holy water and even in December chill, we saw pilgrims taking a dip.‚ÄúParadoxical‚Äù because walking across the whole periphery I found numerous occasions where ordinary pilgrims were picking trash from the ground and throwing in dustbins ‚Äì and this was same city where just outside you could find number of places where waste was not managed properly. The vast expanse of the temple was spotlessly clean ‚Äì and again we are told that the carpets that lay across the periphery for pilgrims are washed regularly. Keeping such huge compound spotlessly clean was almost a miracle in itself.After traversing the periphery of the lake clockwise, we entered the bridge which led to the Sanctum Sanctorum. It was pretty busy place where crowd movement was very slow. It took us about 1 hour to reach the main temple right in middle of the lake ‚Äì while it was very busy, there was not too much of push. Then there were separate queues for females ‚Äì though few females were part of common queue.Inside the main temple, we made our prayers and came back. Some though were sitting around the central temple and making extended prayers. Almost everywhere one could see thick carpets for sitting of pilgrims. After collecting our prasad, we came out. Apart from the beauty and views, there was an envelope of serenity and calm that had descended the whole place.Late in the evening, we went back only to see the brilliant temple glowing in tremendous glory. Again we are told that temple is open almost from early dawn till 10 in the night ‚Äì so you can schedule your visit accordingly.To sum it, the place should be in your must watch list ‚Äì and if possible, try to visit twice, once in day and another time at night. Go there not just for the beauty but for the elusive peace with the bhajans (religious songs) playing in the background. PS: Some small areas of Improvement at this brilliant place:‚Ä¢	Separate queues for people over 65 years or wheelchair bound people should be created on the bridge ‚Äì like the one made for women pilgrims for their safety.‚Ä¢	Movement of vehicles, pickup/drop near Ranjit Chowk needs to be streamlined‚Ä¢	Pockets of litter near parking lots needs to be cleaned up & Street vendors should be regulated."
115,Mesmerising experience,Visited in December with family. It is a temple which should be in everyone's must visit list. The temple is very beautiful and large with lake in between. The  temple was very crowded the day we visited & it was extremely cold. However the experience was very good. Had very tasty halwa dripping with ghee as prasad. The place was very well managed by kar sevaks. Only problem was they do not allow baby stroller inside and the campus is huge.
116,Nice visit,"The most messmerising view of Religious places ever seen. The Entire area is so so neat & clean Which is next to imagine with more them 1lakh footfall daily. The atmosphere is silent with no loud noise. The langar is the most talk about in the whole world is amazing, We were blessed to have the langar as prasad.Not to miss sight in life.Wahe Guru"
117,Heavenly,"Well, I have no word to explain the beauty and power of this holy place. It is out of describing in words."
118,Wahe Guruji,We had the opportunity to see the temple both at night and during the day. It is an amazing and humbling experience which no one should miss. The calmness and serenity of the place is just mind boggling. Never miss an opportunity to visit if you are in Amritsar.
119,Peace,Wonderful experience. Felt like in heaven. The darshan were very smooth. Parshad was hot and nicely done
120,Serene,"If you are in Punjab and looking for an escape for the masses, stop in here.  Take you shoes off and have a nice walk around the reflective pool while gazing upon the holy golden temple."
121,Golden Temple,Very beautiful and serene though there is so much crowd visiting the temple. We went in a Thursday eve and it took us about 1/2 hour in the queue. It didn‚Äôt feel too much at all coz there was no pushing or shoving . The langar was a humbling experience. When we went back on the weekend the crowd was overwhelmingly and we only did the Parikrama as the wait in the queue was anticipated at 1.5 hours or more. One has to be careful to keep your head covered at all times and couples cannot take cozy pictures .
122,Try to see the Golden Temple during the day AND night.,"Wahe Guru Ji... No need of any review... It's ultimate, ek naam. Wahe Guru Ji daa Khalsa te wahe guru hindi fateh"
123,Divine,"Irrespective of your religion, you are most welcome to this Gurudwara of Shikh. This place is highly pure. Lots of people give their time volunteery for many works like cleaning floors, giving foods, collecting shoes, etc. Everyone work with no ego and no returns. And the food is available for free 24 x 7. Temple is looking great in Gold. I love coming here... Peace for Soul."
124,Fascinating visit.,Visiting the Golden Temple was blissful. Seeking blessings and getting to know the history about it was quite interesting. After seeking blessings we headed towards the langar to offer our service and experience some delicious food.
125,Peaceful experience,Bliss for the family. Just the perfect place for peace of mind. Do visit if you go to amritsar. Best part is that people from all faiths are welcome.
126,Divine meeting .. surreal experience,This is an amazing site and a must for every visit to the golden temple. The car park for the golden temple is great and a perfect place to park to make the most of your visit. The walk from the car park to the golden temple has been renovated to create a heritage village which is easy to navigate and clean. The route also includes other places to visit so I would recommend using the car park when visiting.The golden temple itself has signs in English and easy to navigate. I would say that it gets very busy in the evenings so stay close with people in your group.
127,Simply divine,Waited a long time to visit this Temple & it certainly didn‚Äôt disappoint.It is magnificent.My friend & I walked around it several times with our guide Preet who was a mind of information.Didn‚Äôt queue to go in as it was very long & the virus was headlines so sadly we decided to pass on it.However it didn‚Äôt spoil our visit as there was so much else to see
128,No words are enough for the tiltle.,"The Golden Temple is simply out of this world. I first laid eyes on it at night and it was a huge Wow! The gold glistened and shimmered whilst the lake around, after which Amritar is named (honey lake) was still and calm, reflecting the colours of the lights, marble of the buildings and gold of the temple.We visited again in the day time, but nothing beats the night time visit. We saw the food being made and served and dishes washed for hundreds of thusands of pilgrims per week who are fed for free by Sikh volunteers. This is an amazing place run by amazing people."
129,A place which gives a golden touch to mind and heart,Feel the meditation while visiting with family. World's largest kitchen serving Langar.All religious beliefs are welcome to come here
130,Waheguru!!!,"It's really a divine place, It was my first time I visited and it's a beautiful place the gurudwara, the langar hall.I am really amazed to see the beauty of Golden Temple."
131,Do not miss this,We visited the temple both in the evening and during the day. The gold leaf shines beautifully at night against the night back drop.During the day the sun makes it equally beautiful.The ethos behind the temple is one of equality for  all and actively help the homeless. A most spectacular place to visit
132,Wow wow wow ,"It‚Äôs a life time experience to see the golden temple at night in its glory.. I was equally proud of the fact that we still have such clean and calm places in our country still.. and the Kandahar prasad is worth savouring for sure.Don‚Äôt miss the chance to be there in the durbar of Guru saheb, this is a spiritual experience you don‚Äôt want to miss."
133,more than one day in the Golden Temple,"Our visit to the Golden Temple was very nice. The area is peaceful, the langar was tasty and the structures and lake were serene and lovely. However, the reason I gave it a 4 star is that we were conned by a chap pretending to be doing seva at the mandir every saturday. he cheated my friends of 2100/- and us of 500/- under the pretext of buying prasaad and atta for the langar respectively. This is obviously not the only chap doing this and the temple authorities should make every attempt to clamp down on such activities which mars the overall experience."
134,Amazing experience,Golden Temple which the Punjab have beautiful and nature live temple where the real god are come to bless
135,Beautiful Temple,"We were at the temple by 4am, and got to experience the carrying of the holy book on a chariot. It was mesmerizing, truly beautiful. There was so much crowd but no pushing. Everyone was orderly. Despite my freezing feet, going there at dawn was worth every minute."
136,God's Places,Just words cant express much about the golden temple. It was such great experience. The history of the golden temple  just gives you goose bumps!
137,Religious Place,"Amazing place. So serene, quiet with thousands of visitors and spotless. Amazing architecture and ambience. Sikh's of course know how to show and revere their most holy place. Que for seeing Akal Tacht wasn't bad, only an hour. Dusk views are amazing. Langar worth a visit although we couldn't had a meal as can't sit on the floor! Spent over 6 hrs there. Surrounding areas are full of souvenir shop and authentic local food including Choley Bhaturey restaurant. Worth a visit."
138,Peaceful and beautiful ,"You can feel the divine power as you enter the gates. The peace and the calmness can only be experienced after visiting it. Harminder Sahib is visited by devotees all through the year in large numbers. Though the premises is huge but is continuosly cleaned by the devotees and they call it 'seva"". It is a belief to take dip in the sarovar before visiting inside but it a choice entirely on the devotees. You should definitely enjoy the delicacies served in langar as it is extremely hygienic, free of cost and is served fresh daily.Must visit if you are planning for Amritsar."
139,Serene Spiritual Experience,"Me alongwith my Mother, Kids & Wife visited Golden Temple on 28-December-2019 at around 11:15am in the morning. Golden Temple zone inside is a huge area. We visited end of December‚Äô19, the temperature was 4-5 degree Celsius in the morning time. We reached around 10:40 am in the morning. Firstly, in the temple premises we all deposited our shoes and after that walked barefoot along 80-90 meters and washed legs with warm water and entered inside the temple. After entering the main premises traveller definitely surprise viewing the massive area of Golden Temple premises. The temple is built around a man-made pool (Sarovar). The gate we entered ‚Äì we walked around 250 ‚Äì 300 meters inside the premises and reached the main area from where the queue starts. It is an open house of worship for all men and women traveller. It has a circumambulation path around the pool. Here we experienced slightly uncomfortable as there was a massive crowd were waiting to see the main part of sanctum sanctorum of The Golden Temple. My mother is a senior citizen and my kids are faced problem after met the big queue for around 1 hour 15 minutes. But after reaching the place, our mind senses with peace and we experienced a nice darshan for around 4-5 minutes.  I noticed Sikh pilgrims taking dip in the pool in the freezing temperature. No additional security check-up etc. noticed which we always experienced in other religious places in India. There are additional buildings include a clock tower, the offices of Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and a langar ‚Äì a free Sikh community run kitchen that serves a simple vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination. Nice prasad a halwa made from wheat, ghee and sugar, known as ‚ÄòKarrah‚Äô is distributed to all the devotees and travellers without any cost.I feel this is a must visit place for all the Indians and I will definitely visit Golden Temple once again if I get a chance in my lifetime."
140,Enchanting,Golden temple the view in the night is so beautiful the positive vibes the prasad was yummy.. the arrangement at Darbar is just outstanding..
141,Serene,"After visiting many of India's cities and temples, I can honestly say that this is one of the main highlights.  Do NOT hesitate to make a special visit to Amritsar and this temple."
142,"Amritsar: A Place of Heaven
[‡®Ö‡©∞‡®Æ‡©ç‡®∞‡®ø‡®§‡®∏‡®∞: ‡®∏‡®µ‡®∞‡®ó ‡®¶‡®æ ‡®∏‡®•‡®æ‡®®]",anything we write will not be enough. words cannot express this place of worship. absolutely beautiful and amazing place.
143,Golden temple review.,"Blissful, Heavenly & Spiritual...must visit for everyone. Feeling totally refreshed and re-energized.Satnam Wahe Guru"
144,Golden temple visit ,There are no words that can describe the beauty and positive vibe of the holy Golden  temple.its sparkling clean and what a feeling it was to be able to do darshan properly..
145,Golden Temple,"Golden Temple, the name explains it.. but does it, justify this one no.. This place isn‚Äôt about made in Gold or the History., this place is about humanity, so many believers, yet not a single push.. So much food, yet not a single morsel, is wasted.. well I m writing this blog, for all the people who want to see the Granth Saheb and pay the homage some as close as one hands distance.. the best time to do that is early morning at around 3.30am but if u aren‚Äôt an early riser.. no issues, do that late evening around after 9pm when the closing time of the darshan happens.."
146,A highlight of any trip to India,Excellent in all sense. It is huge. Well maintained. Truly spiritual and devine.24hrs Langar with free food and tea are awesome. Lighting at night make it slender. Provision is there for staying within temple complex apart from many budget to luxury stays with lot of eateries around. Best place and must see attraction in Punjab.
147,Peaceful Place,A beautiful temple!!! Amazing amount of facilities provided to visitors - place for foot ware storage; people cleaning the premises continuously; drinking water in multiple places; well formed queue; food service ‚ÄúLangar‚Äù; ‚ÄúPrasaad‚Äù offered as soon as you exit Harminder Sahib; places to wash your hands. Truly well organised; A lovely & historic place to visit
148,One of a kind Temple,"Visit the Golden Temple early morning and in the evening for the magical lighting and cool temperatures. See my photos of the kitchens, volunteers, etc under my review of Narinder's  ""Amritsar Excursion"", who opened our eyes to the behind-the-scenes preparations required to feed 40,000+ daily for free. It is an amazing and moving experience."
149,Holy place golden temple,We had been to Amritsar for spell of 5 days in total. All these five days we all went to the temple several times . After entering the temple premises the atmosphere inside gives a golden touch to both mind and heart. We had been to Langar and noticed the miracle service provided by disciples.
150,VISIT TO SWARN MANDIR AMRITSAR,"The Golden Temple Complex is the most amazing place. It is incredibly beautiful but more than that is the incredible atmosphere generated of tranquility and serenity. The place is busy with many, many Sikh pilgrims but it doesn‚Äôt feel crowded. There is often a very long queue to enter the Harmandir Sahib to see the Holy Book. A visit to the kitchens is a must and very humbling. We visited twice, once mid morning and again in the evening to see ‚ÄúThe putting to bed ceremony‚Äù. Do try and visit twice, the evening ceremony is even more atmospheric."
151,Always charming,"A true wonder of them world.A slide show is available showing the massacre of the punjabis by the British.Humbling as they provide free food for thousands everyday,24 hours a day.The queues though are extremely long.They do encourage you to help in the kitchen.Everyone must be barefoot and with head covering,which can be provided.wouldnt have missed the experience."
152,Nothing Can Prepare For The Spectacle,"Visiting for the visit time, I'm impressed with the hygiene practices in this temple. Right from shoe locker to the prayers. There are plenty of locker for shoe you can use them. Next please don't cover with shawl because it will keep falling better use small piece of ""Kesari"" colour cloth to cover your head. Follow queue for Darshan. I visited twice, best to visit early morning because less queue."
153,Breathtaking,good place to visit. best if you have guide. we had none but one sardarji helped us and explained importance of the place and historic details.
154,FOR ALL RELIGIONS (ALMIGHTY),This was my second time at Golden Temple.It's beautiful !!We have visited during the day and at night. At night with all the lights looks more beautiful.
155,Beautiful,Rooms are very neat and clean with modern amenities just 5 minutes walking distance to golden temple
156,Absolutely beautiful Golden Temple,"No words to explain how one feel when you enter harmandir sahab! It is such a beautiful place that you actually feel in presence of god! You can spend hours here, it may look chaotic but it is the most peaceful place..."
157,Amazing sight,The holiest place of all! This havs exceptionally good peace and environment. The beautiful people also.
158,Spiritual Homeland of Sikhism,Being in The Harmandir Sahib was an experience in itself......What beauty....What faith....How clean and disciplined everyone was and there must have been thousands there...
159,Special place,Had a chance to visit the Historical Golden Temple.  You have a spectacular view at Golden Temple.  I believe only blessed  people can reach here.  The great 'langar' where poor and rich  people of all sects  have food together.
160,The cleanest tample,Memorable mesmerizing experience. Everything is professionally managed. Devotees from all faiths makes it standout as symbol of religious harmony.
161,Golden Temple with Roobaroo Walks!,"Beautiful place, here you can experience the friendly Sikh people of India. Inspire of the masses of visitors a very relaxing stay!"
162,Best sightseeing day of my Indian holiday.,The moment you enter this magical temple your soul start feeling the sensation of majesty.I true soul touching experience.
163,An amazing Experience,"We spent our Holiday in India visiting Delhi, Agra, Rajasthan, Kerala, but this part was my favourite, do ensure you visit the Temple at night and also during the day to see it in properly, this surpasses the Taj Mahal for me, a working living monument full of love."
164,Great experience ,"Golden temple is a must visit if you love temples. The moment you enter the temple, you feel positive, serene and peaceful. Must go holy place, specially in the night for peace."
165,Visit to Golden temple ,"As a tourist, the glorious Golden Temple is everything it says on the guide books - it is beautiful, clean and welcoming. I really liked the contrast between the rugged streets of Amritsar and the serene inner courtyard of the Golen Temple. Photography is now 'loosely' banned after some incidents over social media - so be discrete and the guards (dressed in blue and holding a spear) are generally forgiving. Ask about the meal timings so you can enjoy a free meal in the largest kitchen in the world."
166,Amazing ,"Visited as part of a tour to Rajesthan. It is difficult to put into words just how amazing the Golden Temple is. From the Temple itself, the food preparation areas, the utter calm despite vast crowds it is an amazing place to visit."
167,Beyond 5 stars,"Such a beautiful experience. This was a highlight of the trip. The temple is gorgeous, the visitors are respectful, and the attendants are welcoming. And of course the food was delicious."
168,Amazing,Must visit to see in the daytime and the evening to see the full glory  of this place.If going into inner complex to give prayers try very early or late as the queues can build up and be prepared for you personal space to be invaded as it can be crowded.
169,Beautiful Temple,"Day view is average as compare to night view. Langer is 24 hours and average. Temple closes (Darshan of Grinth Saheb) by 10.00 PM. what amazes me is the seva towards keeping temple clean, and right outside whole Amritsar is worst than a garbage dump."
170,Best of Amritsar,"Definitely on my seven wonders of world. The people there are so pure and so volunteering. Absolutely no discrimination of rich and poor and any other. Everything is free from Darshan to Prasad. Even the compulsory head dress is given free to be returned later. Very beautifully organised. The Gigantic Guru Grant Sahib in the two upper floors, the sacred chanting and reading of the book is so divine that devotion comes by default."
171,GOLDEN TEMPLE VISIT,"I would call it eighth wonder of world. We visited it after dusk and probably it's the bestTime to visit the place. In the evening the temple looks very beautiful, the view is breath taking. We had to stand in the queue though for half an hour so but it will always take that much time because of crowd. December is not a very good time to visit as it is so cold in this month. Parking is available near the temple but it's usually full. Golden Temple must be in your wishlist of travel list."
172,The golden experience,The absolute hifhlight of our amazing trip to India.  As a non Sikh it was a priviledge to briefly share the beauty and peace of this incredible holy site.  And the kitchens...... WOW...indescribable.  just go
173,"""Eternal""",We took a few hours to visit the Golden Temple which has been an ambition of mine for a long time. I was not disappointed
174,Scenic and Peaceful,"Super Impressive because they have created systems - whether it be line management, world‚Äôs largest langar, cleanliness, volunteer service. Add to that the Golden Temple itself - and you get a great package. Went both early morning and evening with prayers going on. A good feeling of peace and calm here. Cannot recommend it enough !"
175,Supperrrbbbb,Visited the Golden temple one evening to see the ceremony and then in the daytime.We had to cover our heads and wash our feet before entering the area. Our guide took us on a tour round the temple - lots and lots of people -some were preparing food for thousands of people who go there every day to be fed. Never seen anything like it - the size of the cooking pots - and all these people giving up their time - children included were shelling peas. It was quite an experience - All the splendour of the temple and yet so many poor people.
176,Amazing place & well organised ,"I have been twice to the Golden temple, it is always a pelasure to visit the temple. Hordes of people throng this shrine from across the globe. Would adivse to visit early morning as it can become crowdy/hot during the later part of the day."
177,Divine Feelings,A must visit place when you're in the city of Amritsar. Try visiting during the early morning hours.
178,Visit to Golden Temple,Amazing site. Definitely need to visit the temple both at night and also in the day to fully appreciate the buildings and general area.
179,Harmandir Sahib,Very good arrangements. It was very crowded when I visited this place. There was a long queue to enter the Sanctum Sanctorum. I also did not take the 'Langar'.
180,Awesome place,"This temple is worth a visit both during daytime and night time. Go around the lake and enjoy the many praying rooms, the peaceful praying areas, the wonderful patterns on the marble floor, including a perfect Flower of Life!"
181,Ek Onkar Satnam,"Its an out of the world feeling once you enter Golden Temple premises. The vibes are so positive. One of the best temple experience I have visited till date. The management is very perfect and disciplined. No chaos at all. The staff are also very humble & soft spoken. No body forces for any alms or donations. Zero irritation. The Langar is unbelievable & beyond imagination. People irrespective of their status are seen giving ""Seva"". The approach road from Jallianwala Baug to the Temple is like international class. For me its one of the wonders of the world."
182,Darbar Sahib,Was a blissful spiritual experience to visit Golden Temple. The queue was long but kept on moving. Spend a lot of time around the temple.
183,Fantastic,"I have never seen the Golden Temple anything but crowded. There is always thousands of people here from nearby local visitors to tourists from across the globe. But despite this crowd, there is a peaceful environment inside which is difficult to match or fathom. The moment you step inside this gurudwara you are bound to feel calm and  serene. It hardly matters whether you are a Sikh or not, your mind suddenly takes a spiritual bend and you are at peace with your inner self. Over the years facilities in and around the temple have been improved dramatically making it a more comfortable experience for visitors. Direct access via any vehicles even till the main entrance is now prohibited and you have to walk a bit to get to the temple and then a bit more walking once you get inside to take a complete round around the sarovar and then enter the inner shrine. The karha (prasad) and langar inside are tasty and not to be missed. The community kitchen runs 24X7 despite being one of the biggest of its kind in the world, serving food to thousands and thousand daily. No shoes or socks allowed inside the temple and your head needs to be covered at all times. Due to the continuous flow of devotees and tourists expect to spend at least an hour inside if you want to do darshan of the main Takht. But its an experience of a lifetime which needs to be repeated every year. So don't miss it for anything in the world."
184,Such a Holy Place,by water. The center is connected by a walkway. It is better to walk all round the temple. The center is very crowded.
185,Visited on Gurpurab,For many years the wanting to visit the Golden Temple has been on the bucket list. Finally the window of opportunity arrived and certainly no disappointment was felt seeing it after so many years. Our visit will never be forgotten with memories which will be passed on to family and friends
186,Amazing place,"This place is so calm, peaceful, positive. Its truly a mesmerizing and beautiful place. The view in the night is just awesome. Must visit."
187,Divine place,"This was one of the best trips in India.Please note absolutely imperative to visit the temple before sunrise at least once, Experience is simply magnificent.Try your hands on some volunteer work, Also enjoy Langar which is Community meal provided to everybody."
188,Peace of mind,üôèüôè no words to express when u reach here We can feel him everywhere and if heaven is anywhere it‚Äôs here
189,Every Indian Must Visit - No Religious Restriction ‚Äì Beautiful Place to Visit,"The surrounding area, the Golden Temple itself and the whole atmosphere of the place was not to be missed on a visit to India!"
190,Visit to Golden Temple. ,Do not leave Amritsar without coming here. You can visit the kitchens with a guide and will never have seen anything like it. It‚Äôs one of the most amazing places.
191,Brilliant Temple in the City of Sikhs,"Few places touched me the way the Golden Temple did.....a truly magical place with an atmosphere and energy second to none.Walking barefoot  through the  marble floored temple complex in heavy rain , a feeling of peace and energy enveloped me .The most amazing thing is the completely voluntary based free kitchen that feeds thousands of people 3 times a day. It was a privilege to see it and help  for a short while  and i long to return there.A must see for any    traveler   interested in culture or spiritualism.Amritsar itself is a beautiful , organised city with a variety of places to stay and things to see.Dont miss this special place. It has an atmosphere and energy second to none."
192,Worth the trip,"This was my first visit to The Golden Temple. I was absolutely overcome by the beauty and tranquility of the Temple. They feed everyone who wants a meal. This is all done by volunteers and is free. There are different rooms with volunteers preparing food all day long, it was amazing. The Temple is made from twenty four carat gold. You must visit both day and night, both times it‚Äôs breathtaking. A visit to their holy book within the Temple is a must. There is a sense of peace there."
193,Experience of Spirituality ,"This shrine is a must-visit irrespective of your religious beliefs or lack thereof. It gets thousands of visitors from early morning to late night and everything is well organized by volunteers. There is so much peace and positive energy in the place that it is worthwhile just sitting around the water body and absorbing some of that energy,"
194,Divine Experience,Cant explain the experience you have to visit this place for wonderful experience this place is 8TH WONDER of this world
195,Very spiritual,"This is a unique experience unparalleled worldwide. It is absolutely gorgeous to see the temple and the surrounding buildings - excellent photo opportunities. You have to take your shoes off and wear a head covering - VERY IMPORTANT. Additionally, you should definitely wait in line to get into the temple itself. It is so worth it! Bottom Line: This will be an unforgettable experience. Take photos and remain respectful!"
196,Wahe Guru,Most peaceful and humbling place. The sheer number of people volunteering here will make you feel humble and thankful in life.
197,Mesmerized,"Scenic and peaceful religious place, also extremely well managed in terms of handling the crowd. The place is mostly managed by volunteers who do the job seamlessly"
198,paradise on earth,"Visited first time ,amazing place with great management.its around 3 km from railway station and 4 km from bus stand."
199,Good Visit but rush on sundays,Great humane place.It's a real symbol of humanity.It's a bit too religious though when you see the behavior of people who are guarding the place. They don't even encourage you holding each other's hands being a couple walking inside the temple.
200,Blissful & serene experience,Really a bliss of place with really nice mogul era like artwork all across. Golden temple is clean and really well maintained. A safe place for tourist where guest from all walks of life are welcomed to visit n worship. Volunteers guide and treat everyone with respect n assist tourist if anything is required.
201,Divine and Glorious,"A very special experience. Sikhs are very generous in sharing, including the free meal 24 hours a day"
202,Spiritual and devotional,"1 item ticked off the bucket list. The place is just divine and it was an amazing experience. The only 2 things that needs attention is 1) the sevadars are just plain rude, if there are rules we will follow but no need to be rude. 2) the adjoining places to the temple need immediate attention from civic bodies.. otherwise it is an experience everyone should have once"
203,Amazing place,"No words can describe the awesomeness of this holy place!  Clean and organized.  Ensure your head is covered and dressed decently as a respect.  Amazing system of leaving your footwear prior to entry to the temple, by receiving a token , they know exactly which is yours upon collection."
204,Soul warming,"The Golden Temple is amazing in itself, but it is the kitchens and the thousands who are daily fed there, which really makes an impact.  Our JULES VERNE tour showed us in detail all that is done to serve the thousands of visitors, and it is very impressive.Sadly however pollution levels were very high. Amritsar was covered in a grey smog and the gold on the temple hardly shone at all.  This was my second visit - I came here first in 1978.  The blue skies I saw then and the sparkling gold leaf on the buildings was not repeated;  I was left with a deep sadness at how things have changed.  Nevertheless, an incredibly worthwhile visit."
205,Awesome,"It has been a great privillege to have visited golden temple.Its a huge complex  very well managed in all respects and everyone is dedicated to do his best . Having darshan is not a problem que is lond at all times but assure to be in single line which is on the right side..yu can locate easily.it takes about 10 minutes to enter the main chamber.no words can describe the feelings you get complete dedication by all.yu can also go by stairs on the top of chamber.maintaince is superb all fittings are neatly polished.ensure to do parikarma. of the pond, must have langer parshad very simple but amrit. see the service they provide in offering yu and promptly inspite vo heavy rush. no waiting..its worth watching.yu too can offer your service monterily and in return they give your dry prasad.must see once if yu have not visited."
206,Must visit,"Just wonderful place , unique in world, never seen such devotion anywhere in world.Must visit in day and night time as well."
207,Mesmerizing,"Went here as part of our tour. My wife an I were simply blown away with this place. The Temple is stunning to look at. We went there with our guide during the day then returned in the evening on our own. It is free to enter. On our morning visit we started by walking around the lake simply soaking in everything. You have to remove your shoes before entering. There is a place to deposit them. We were then shown the kitchen area where food is prepared for hundreds of people on a daily basis. This in itself is absolutely fascinating to watch. We then visited the food Hall where people eat for free sitting on the floor in long rows.. We then had to queue for about 20 minutes to enter the temple itself. This was quite emotional as we walked around inside. The very book that is part of the Sikh religion was there under a cover. You are not allowed to take photos or dwell for too long inside it was simply amazing.We returned to the Temple in the evening after dark to see the grounds and Temple all lit up. This place looked so different at night. It was stunning.You are not allowed to take photos once in the grounds and there are security people who try and enforce this. However, if  you are discreet and are not spotted you can get some amazing shots of the Temple and surroundings. As I said before once inside the Temple the no photos rule is very strictly enforced.We would definitely recommend visiting here."
208,FEELS GOOD,The very first place to visit if u r visiting amritsar peace of mind. Hatsoff for everything cleanliness and maintenance supeerb how the have maintain the way of worship everything was perfect
209,Ancient temple of India,"I can hardly put into words the UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC experience we had with Roobaroo Walks in Amritsar.  The coordinator Anupam was simply awesome in helping us get set up with our tours.  Tours is really a paltry description of the activity as they were DEEP CULTURAL EXPERIENCES.  Our guide Tarundeep Ji was an incredible man!  After spending two days basking in his knowledge of the City, Sikh way of life. We were beyond thrilled. Harandir Sahib (Golden Temple):  You cannot put into words what you will see here.  It was one of the most stately, loving, peaceful, and generous places you will visit in India (I have been around a bit).  The beauty cannot be appreciated with out actually seeing it. Online pictures plainly fall short of the spectacularness of the home of the Guru Granth Sahib.  It is a living book and a living place.  Tarundeep did a marvelous job of giving us just not the visual and historical facts.  He gave us the spiritual essence of the most holy place for the Sikh community.  You cannot help but be compelled to service when you get there.  DO NOT MISS A CHANCE TO HELP IN THE COMMUNITY KITCHEN (service is reward honor the spirit of the place)!!! Go in the evening as the beauty is almost hard for the mind to process!  Take time to meditate in the heart of the temple and let yourself the absorb the 'life' of the temple.  The guide will make sure you miss NOTHING, and you will walk away with a new piece of culture to meld with your own."
210,Great experience,"It was a mesmerizing experience to visit this temple. After waiting for 1 hr in queue, we got the darshan but it was worth  the wait. Tip:- it is better to visit at night when you can watch the beautiful campus glow with lights!"
211,Stunning Complex,Truly one of those rare places in the world where it is easy to find inner peace and quiet. All people are welcome to come. The experience is truly humbling and provides great peace and a chance to introspect even when it is crowded. It is a must visit. The presence of God can truly be felt here.
212,Devine,Visited twice during our short stay. Great guide bought this amazing location to life. We were able to view the food preparation and provision of meals for all visitors.....any visitor can do so. Amazing generosity and the tour offered an iteresting insight into the Sikh faith. The location looks very different at night...less busy but still vibrant. Go visit
213,Just superb,"You enter the Golden Temple With your head covered & bowedWith folded handsWith moist eyesWith prayer in your lipsYou listen to the calming kirtanYou behold the magnificence of His creationYou thank Him for what He had givenYou thank Him for all His BlessingsYou just enter the Golden Temple, seek his Blessings & emerge glowing under His careWahe Guru, wahe Guru, wahe Guruji"
214,Forever in memories,"One of our best evening followed by a day visit ever.This is a real place of worship not just something to view, its full of life, beautiful, very spiritual and a must for everyone to visit who possibly can.Forget about feeding the 5000 here its 100s of thousand a day in day out...visit the kitchen see the food being prepared served and the astounding washup. All carried out by locals who do it to make things better.Don't miss the story of the book...its uplifting.Dress respectably and enjoy the sight."
215,"Its the GOLDEN TEMPLE, after all",The interior of Golden Temple is awesome and the best thibg is you can sit on first floor or second floor offer your prayers. They have provided the proper path.Kadah Prasad seems a bit change to me.Gur ka langar... The community eating is also good who want to eat that with full respect.Machines took place of human hands changed the taste a bit but head off to all the administration and Sikh community who permit 24hrs entrance and food.
216,Mesmerizing,"Very famous place and religious.  We have spent a day.  There are too many options to stay nearby, shops and restaurants.  We tried lassi, which was amazing."
217,Peaceful,Please visit this place in the morning and evening if possible to enjoy the sheer beauty.Had food at the Langer and kudos to everyone for the hospitality shown.
218,Golden,Great place to visit and experience the culture. We loved it and will be back. I went 2am and it was the best time to sit and absorb the positive energy.
219,Amazing ,"so nice and rewarding, so heart warming to see so many people with devotion and faith. Great serive by the ""Sevak"" made us all feel welcome"
220,Wahe Guru Complete Blessing Mesmerizing Golden Temple,"You may see hundreds of pictures of the Golden Temple, and yet nothing will prepare you for your first sight of this Supreme shrine. It's breathtaking, sacred in its splendor and resonant with the deep faith  of millions.It does not matter what your faith, beliefs, origins are; everyone is welcome into its hallowed precincts. It's worth coming here with an 'insider' who can explain the landmarks and rituals and history, but even if you are coming here uninformed, the soul resonates with the peace that you come here for.Early mornings, the 'amrit vela' or divine time, are ideal if you can make only one visit. This is the time the Temple is still lit up to look like paradise, the crowds are less and the 'paalki sahab' is reverentially carried from the Akal Takht to the Harmandir Sahib. You can soak in the vibrations of the first invocation of the day and see the sun rise over the amrit sarovar or holy water. Feel blessed!"
221,This is what a Temple should be like,"We visited our first evening to see the evening procession and found the whole trip absolutely fascinating.  There were hundreds of people viewing and worshipping.   After the ceremony it was interesting to see about 50 men, women and children cleaning all the brass railings and sweeping up the petals.    We returned the next morning to see the preparing of the food for the needy who amounted to thousands.   Please be aware that you will be bare foot inside the temple grounds and both men and women have to keep their head covered and baseball caps are not suitable."
222,Golden Temple Marvellous,"Sure a beautiful place, Definitely go daytime & night , It gets very busy so go early morning & early evening its a bit quieter."
223,Marvelous,"Our first visit. Beautifully well maintained place. It has Ora all around. Didn‚Äôt have to  wait for long for darshan. Completed the visit under 49minutes.I wonder how they manage the constant flow of bhakts. The people doing seva at jute ghar. The langar has a constant flow of bhakts to taste the prasad. The ladies peeling garlic & onions and the roti making corner. Their devotion is incomparable.We visited couple of times, sat their for hours near the water body. People are just coming and going. The temple looks so beautiful in the morning sunrise and evening sunset. A must visit for all"
224,Amazing Golden Temple,"I am always impressed by the management of the temple. Everyone is particular about the upkeep and decorum and i am grateful for that. Picture taking is strictly prohibited in some areas. Head must be covered and socks are not allowed so in winter, the floor is cold but there are mats that one can walk on. The langar area is impressive in both the quality of food and organization. The temple where the Granth is - requires a certain amount of wait - we went at 9 PM in November so it took only 30 minutes and we got to see the ceremony of wrapping the book. The mandir is beautiful and awe-inspiring. So much beauty on the walls. It is worth the wait.Also, the temple is beautiful at night. Sitting by the sarovar is very peaceful."
225,Amritsar,"This place is like Heaven on Earth, it feels so peaceful to be here and you can feel the positivity around and inside you. you will always find this place filled with people from around the world each & every day."
226,The Golden Temple,"The peacefulness I feel every time I visit is worth the bullcrap it takes to visit India in general. Definite must see for travellers, enjoy the early morning ritual during sunrise."
227,Immensely Satisfying ,Visited after also most 15 years found the place more organized and surroundings refurbished. A very peaceful place to be and feel blessed to have their. A must visit while you are in india specially Punjab
228,Place for Pure Soul..,"Nice place to see and get blessings. But need to very carefull with Bribers and lots of Bargainers to take money from all. Also, need to wear a Cloth or a Handkerchief on head for men and for women saree covered in head. It takes minimum 2hrs for darshan."
229,most peaceful,This place is so beautiful and vibrant. There are loads of scarves outside for free to put on so no need to buy one from the many people trying to sell them to you on the way.I thought i might feel awkward in there but not at all. Very pleased i went to visit
230,Visit,"This place is out of the world, peaceful, calm and the beauty of the place is simply mesmerizing. Must visit if your in Amritsar."
231,Mr,This is one of the best places I have seen in my life and I thank Almighty for the experience. I have visited this temple thrice in last four years and couldn't think of a single not so good experience. Accommodation is easy if you are a group of 2 or above. Room rate starts from 200 INR which are provided by temple administration. The temple pond is clean and so are the rooms Central Museum is a must visit where one can see the manuscripts of Guru Granth Sahib One can carry home the feel good feeling back home ....
232,A much awaited visit ,"There's no other place that comes close to the spirituality you experience here! Take into account the weather - and decide the time of the day accordingly for a visit because the queues can be fairly long. Eg prefer afternoons in winter, and early mornings / late evenings in summer"
233,Must visit Gurudwara. And don't miss the Langar ,This was my 7th visit each time i come makes me so much at peace and its just Blissfull the moment one steps in there it a feeling cannot be put in words
234,Harmandir Sahib(Golden Temple) - Sacred Temple in Punjab,"Eat pray loveThis single place embodies all three together. Do make sure to go to the roof top of the temple, it has a different sense of spirituality"
235,Pilgrimage ,"it is a great advantage to visit twice, nighttime and daytime. You will experience the very special lighting at both times. I think thousands of people both times, all so devout, all so friendly with folded hands and bowed head greeting. We were taken many photos of, as Europeans. the amazing queue of young and old and children on the bridge over to the temple, standing in line for hours. One is humbled by the beauty and the worshipers."
236,Holy place,Went during the day and again at night to see it illuminated. Breathtakingly stunning. Long queues to get in. Fabulous picture opportunities. A must visit.
237,Pure and serene ,"A must visit place for everyone. The ambience of the temple and surrounding is just mesmerizing, full of positive vibes."
238,Awestruck by the beauty,"The entire complex is so well kept, clean and hygienic. All crowds were managed very well and there was no pushing / shoving for either the Darshan or the Prasad which followed. Excellent place to visit and experience the divinity of faith without any bias of religion!"
239,Serene and pristine,"Temple eat very clean and quite. Both men and women need to cover our head with scarf or cloth. No need to by, at the entrance of the temple they provide the scarf for who don't have to share. Return the same place after use. Footwear counter available. Morning and Evening have book ceremony if have chance do watch. Dining room was big and been served with Chapatti for whole day. Kitchen was big too, lot of volunteers to prepare and cook. 3 hours wait to enter in temple. We went on weekend so very crowded. Not sure on weekends"
240,Peace Of Mind,This is a most amazing place. So very beautiful. It is good to get a guide and to visit in the evening to go inside as the queues are very long during the day. The Putting to bed ceremony is a must and you learn a lot about the Sikh religion.
241,Divine,"A must visit place in your lifetime. although there are so many peoples then also you find so much peace here. The complete complex is so neat and clean. All the services are free here. Sit there, close your eyes and listen to beautiful prayers and you will be blessed with peace and calm in your heart and mind. Morning 4 am is so peaceful. you have to cover your head all the time."
242,Golden Temple,It was magnificent! It needs to be seen both and day and night. The kitchen is a marvel; to see so many thousands of meals being prepared 24/7 all by volunteers. The Temple is gorgeously lit-up at nights.
243,Tranquil,"Well what can one say about this iconic site... it‚Äôs truly an experience that one needs to experience first hand. To add to the grandeur of the temple itself is the community meals, the volunteers who feed the masses it‚Äôs truly an emphasis on how religious beliefs should be practiced"
244,Wonderful visit ,"You are going to fall in love with this place once you visit, this is the most famous place not just in Amritsar but accross the world, one of the most sacred place, popularly known as ""Golden Temple"".Firstly it's very beautiful, clean and calm.All this is achieved by seva (volunteer service) performed by all type of human out there. Will definitely visit again whenever I visit Amritsar or nearby."
245,Peaceful,"The Golden Temple is absolutely stunning! We had the chance to walk through the area where all the food was being prepared for the 100,000 a day diners! It was a fabulous experience. Would highly recommend a visit."
246,Tranquil,"The serenity, peace, beauty and positive vibrations that you indulge in simply by being at the golden temple is incredible. You will come out of the temple humbled."
247,Worth two trips,"Beautiful temple, make sure to wear something so your feet can be bare as you need to wash your feet."
248,The most important pilgrimage site for the Sikhs,"Trully an amazing experience, must come here early and do the line to go inside in order to get a fully immersive experience. Do not miss the food in the common canteen afterwards, very tasty and clean!"
249,Wahe guru! ,Truly magical religious temple. A must go at night. The reflection of all the lights onto the water is gorgeous. The sad part is the amount of homeless people that uses this place as a home.G-d bless the Sikhs for their compassion.
250,Everything awesome about this place...,"Our party of five were fortunate enough to have Rabia from City on Pedals as our guide for a 3:30 dawn visit to the Golden Temple. Rabia guided us through the Temple, finding fantastic vantage points for us and taking us into the kitchens. There, we helped to make chapattis for the langar and saw the giant pots of dahl being made. We had access all areas which was much more than we expected. It was a fantastic tour, worth every penny. Wholeheartedly recommended."
251,Bes gurughar,I bet this the the heaven on earth and for first time experience it is mesmerising. Special thanks to our guide to bestowed us to Prive to understand the pious place
252,Beautiful temple,"Visited Golden Temple in last month of 2019 and it was absolutely marvellous.StructureStructure of the temple is made of marble and the temple section is Gold plated.Temple is surrounded by a lake and the Holy Book of ""Guru Granth Sahib"" is kept in the temple. (Pardon if the information provided is wrong.The main temple is located in between the lake and the view is marvellous at night when the temple is surrounded by lights. The atmosphere is devotional and at all times holy scribes from Guru Granth Sahib are being recited. The best part of the temple is the simplicity with which people are being treated. Did not find special VIP line anywhere. All are being treated equally and everybody gets an equal opportunity to devote. The services such as shoe keeping, prasad line, water serving are also very simple and not a single person is found asking for tips etc. Surprisingly also did not found any place for donations. There is a lot of space to sit around peacefully and meditate. Found many people staying inside the Gurudwara. Really a marvellous place and full of devotion. Will surely like to visit once again. The only suggestion I have is there should be informative audio / video help available to give historical information about the Gurudwara. There should be 3D show or something alike which will make people aware of the historic importance and piousness of the place. Do attend the evening prayer. I was quite lucky to attend the same and was is the main hall wherein all the rituals were performed. Had a very close look of the same and trust me it was very devotional and makes you get involved. It just can't be described in words, you need to experience it to feel it."
253,Treasure of Punjab,"Golden temple is changed alot in last few years the cleanses and maintenance of the place is so good, so many shops is there and so many development is going on. You will not feel your in india for a second. People doing there service for free."
254,Harmandir Sahib,"Easy to visit. Be ready to leave shoes at the shoe depositry, and  cover head. It is all free, including food, but make a good donation."
255,Prepare to be moved,It‚Äôs easy for transport from hotel as it is nearby the hotel . Being the most visited tourist spot the person visiting amritsar will never go without exploring the golden temple
256,Highlight of our Indian Holiday,"One feels the holiness when you are in the outer yard, taking your shoes off. Absolutely clean, even though thousands of pilgrims are flooding the temple. I recommend to go twice, at daytime and in the night, when the temple is beautifully lit. The spiritual atmosphere is fascinating. Have a dip in the Holy water of the lake. Other Religions are very welcome. Walk around the lake and pray!"
257,Even better than it looks in the photos,"It was so peaceful. So beautiful and calm. I went there night and day time. Both time, it was awesome. You cant get enough of it.  It is divine. It is something you need to see by yourself and live it. No words enough to describe the Golden Temple."
258,Jo Bole So Nihaal,"A beautiful ornate temple in a lovely setting.  I would recommend to get a guide so that you don't miss out on the history and detail.  Try to avoid weekends and/or Hindu god birthdays as the queue to get in will be massive (I don't have much patience I am afraid).  Don't forget to go round the museum and the kitchens where they serve up to 50,000 people 24 hours per day - an amazing operation run by volunteers (look out for the 5 chapati making machines that can churn out 20,000 chapatis per hour at peak times !).  Obviously, this is a ""must do"" - why else would you be here !"
259,"Peaceful, Humbling, Inspiring","Its busiest, crowdy and yet peaceful Temple. Yet securities dont allow to catch photos sometimes. but everyone click pictures. I also had a little bad experience of one of the Sardar! Visit temple before sunrise once!"
260,Wahe Guru,"This is an amazing place, quite stunning and atmospheric. It rained the day we were there but no matter - we still had a great visit. We couldn't actually get into the temple proper (big queue) but that didn't matter. It is a must see."
261,Nice Experience,Moment u step at Golden temple serenity & peace u feel can't be explained simply superbJust feel like staying more time there
262,Must Visit!!!! ,"As always, this place will give you peace of mind.Due to Covid 19 full protection equipment are placed like automatic sanitizer machine at entry.You can stay here easily there are lots of Niwas(accommodation) .Price was very affordable for a day .It start from 200 ."
263,Unforgettable Tour,"Simply amazing! Shining so bright, marbel is everywhere, you can enjoy this place for hours without feeling bored. One of the best places in India, must visit!"
264,Heart touching experience,The Golden Temple was spectacular. My friends and I went back every day just to sit and soak in the atmosphere. There is a vibe in the air there that you will not find anywhere else! It also has a safe place to keep your shoes and belongings!
265,Most peaceful place on the planet earth,"Great place to visit with family. I will prefer to spend the night at this place because the view of night is really heart throbbing and awesome. We went there from Chandigarh by evening train and we were there by 10pm and from railway station we took auto otherwise there is free service of bus to Golden temple as well, its just 10 minutes from station. For rooms you can go at the back side of Golden temple dharamshala is available but i will prefer to book it online according to your tour because on Saturday and Sunday they are mostly full and there will be no any vacant room. Other than this there are some local people also providing rooms facility little costlier than dharmshala but still on very nominal cost. Whatever you choose but at 4am don't miss the prabhat feri in Golden temple that is great thing to watch and after that you can make it to your queue. One most important thing plan your tour to at least of 2-3 days to enjoy the trip there are so many places too see in Golden Temple itself after that there is partition museum, durgiana mandir, wagah border, jallianwala bagh and so many other things to see. Plan with family or friends it will be great trip and unforgettable üòä"
266,Life time experience ,"Our first visit to the magnificient Golden temple had a mesmerizing effect on us all. Though we waited for nearly 2 hours in the queue, once you step into the holy darbar -  It was being thoughtless and free in the darbar.  Awesome feeling of being in a meditative state.  They are strict with certain things of covering your head so If you have your dupatta slippin off your head, you can encounter any stranger walking up to you and asking you to correct it. We had the opportunity to sit for some time inside the sacred place and listen to the melodious kirtans. Thanks to one of the volunteers who asked us to sit in a corner for flower prasad."
267,Must visit special place,"No words to describe the divinity, peace and happiness this place brings in, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world where everyone gets mesmerized by the beauty, history and greatness of Guru Nanak ji and not to miss the world famous langar, services offered with love and care and one must visit the place both at day and night to see the difference..loved it"
268,One of the World's Special Places,How can a place that's so busy be so peaceful and relaxing. Full of nice friendly people. Beautiful place. Not as busy at night. A highlight for any trip to India.
269,Amazing peace and tranquility,"u need a scarf to enter the temple, u get to buy it around the area if u dont have one and its like INR10rs onwards. Dont miss out the prasad and lunch at the temple. And when u buy the prasad u need to offer it to the temple and then taste it. I must say this cz i had made a mistake by tasting it as soon as i got it, as I did not know that it was to be offered there and then when they return it it can be taken."
270,Diwali at The Golden Temple,You need to walk quite a bit to reach the temple from the road and with kids it becomes a little difficult. There are lot of eateries and shops along the pathway to the temple.Golden temple shines in the evening and is a treat to the eyes. The temple looks beautiful and with the lake surrounding it only adds to the beauty. The temple glitters like 'gold'. You'll find huge crowd inside the temple waiting in the queue to enter the main temple as well as in the outer area surrounding the lake. There are guards everywhere around. Covering your head is compulsory to enter inside and kerchiefs for the same are provided for use at the entrance itself. The best time to visit the temple would be after sunset.
271,A life time experience,"We went there in the month of December, when it was raining and the temperature that time was between 8 degrees to 13 degree. It was extremely cold. When you enter the lane to go to golden temple there was many people attaching you to offer you tour of wagha border, offer you rooms which are cheap in rate, etc.The inside of the golden temple is go amazing, peaceful place. They also have langar wher you get free food to eat which is amazing."
272,What a serene but spectacular place,"So amazing, such a peaceful place to experience and it calms your soul! We were lucky enough to volunteer in the kitchen. That was so fabulous, must try"
273,On my list for a return visit. Superb,"FANTASTIC. VERY crowded, so be prepared for the crowds, but nonetheless an unsurpassed experience.I was told to go at 4am to avoid the crowds, but even at that time, it was very crowded. Check with your hotel which time is the best and where possible avoid weekends and Sikh religious holidays, where the crowds can be expected to be much more."
274,Behind the Scenes Tour with City on Pedals,It‚Äôs a great place and everything here impressed me so much. This was one of the main highlight of my tour to India
275,Simply stunning!,"This has been on my bucket list for years and does not dissapoint. It's pristine marble is regularly cleaned during the day bu volunteers. You can walk around the sacred pond and see the temple itself glimmering in the middle of the water.There's inlaid marble details (similar to Taj Mahal). The temple itself is well worth the time it takes to line up with all the other devotees and tourists. The lines are long but keep moving.A bonus is to sit in for one of the communal meals. Apparently there are more than 120,00 served each day, free to anyone who wants to line up for  meal sitting. It's a big dining room (maybe 700 people at a time) and you're served a thali style meal, very tasty. The whole complex is an experience. Well worth repeat visits, even just to sit and soak in the ambience."
276,Family,"The Golden Temple will take your breath away when you first see it, it looks amazing gleaming in the sunlight.You must go to the kitchens to see whats cooking, the noise is deafening, especially in the washing up area, but it is a must.We made 2 visits, one morning and one evening. During the day there was a 3-4 hr queue to get into the Temple, which I wasn't prepared to join, however in the evening, our guide managed to get us inside, right up to the roof, this was spectacular and should not be missed."
277,Beautiful temple,"You will join several hundred pilgrims, so remember to cover up and wear something on her head. There's a long line to go and visit the actual Temple - but you only get 1-2 minutes inside. You can feel the spirituality, humility and kindness of the Sikh people . Go and visit the huge kitchens and dining area. There's no entrance fee, but remember to take an offering."
278,Holiest place in India for Sikhs,"Such a beautiful mix of spirituality & community! They serve 30,000-40,000 plates of food per day & have temporary dorms for pilgrims, also. The temple itself is stunning! Great for families to visit & individuals to worship."
279,What an experience,"Just don‚Äôt have words to describe how it feels when you visit this , so much of kindness , love and peace Don‚Äôt forget it to take lungar that‚Äôs the most lovely thing to have there after blessings"
280,Spiritual heaven,Must do.. at least once in your lifetime.Dont miss the food at the langaar.Go at different time of the day
281,Golden Temple,"It is crowded but no congestion, it s wet but very neat, its rush hour but very organized, it s loud but very pleasant. I can keep on going. The first sight of the Temple at the moment we enter the Main gate, stuns you. The tranquility of a beautiful maintained lake and the Islandic Temple construction is a new experience. Even though its crowded, there is no congestion to walk and the helpers are doing a great job in maintaining the premises. It s cleanliness is 2nd to none in India for such a crowded place. One has to visit during day and as well as at night as it gives a great look. A special mention to the Free Dining side of the temple. The food is so delicious and perfectly organized to manage the crowd, doesnt matter how full it is. The devotees who are doing the Seva are so kind amidst their tough day of work. Be it the Shoe storage or the Luggage room, it s professional and what touched me is that I stored a dirty shoe and when I got it back, it was well polished. This temple is for everyone irrespective of their origin and truly felt the divinity."
282,Simply Amazing,A lovely place to be and dont miss the visit in the night with the lights its a blessing. Its the most serene place to visit the volunters are so helpful n courteous its a great experienceBe careful of the shopkeepers and shopping outside as they tend to cheat you with ome shop offering the item at 300 the other would offer at 600 of you enter the wrong one and not bargain be assured u r looted
283,Stunning,True it's believers it's a paradise. Must visit but don't be rush relax and enjoy the power the vibes of this sacred place.
284,Golden Temple,Great gentle people surround you as you journey through one of the most emotional places I have ever visited.
285,Wonderful Temple!  Amazing hospitality!,Has been a long held desire to visit and it didn't disappoint. I've been to a few places of worship around the world and this is the most beautiful and serene..... despite the cold weather. Having a free meal with all the other pilgrims was a great experience and no stomach issues after. Visited three times.  Definitely go at night to see the sunset and at dark when lit up. Stunning.
286,Peacefull,"Should visit once in lifetime if you get an opportunity nice calm place , don‚Äôt miss to visit at night , it really looks beautiful."
287,Satnam Shri Waheguru,This is one of the places in the world that tugs at the emotion. In a chaotic country this is a spectacular sanctuary. An amazing sense of order given the huge number of people. The temple itself is an absolute marvel. Really worth watching the putting to bed ceremony. Visiting the immense dining areas and kitchens where thousands are fed for free every day was such a moving experience. The Sikh officials and volunteers were so friendly and welcoming. I will treasure our two visits morning and evening forever
288,Adobe of peace and sanctity,"There is not other way to say this so I will put it out there first. the most spectacular , clean , well managed,  majestic and serene place  I have ever visited . It's the best thing to do in Amritsar and it's open from 4a.m to 10 p.m . It's rush time almost all the time but an hour is what you would take to complete your visit. It's very well managed and very clean so there is no trouble queueing up. The golden temple surround by clean water is a wonderful sight. You can take a dip in the waters at a specified location. We happen to visit during the night and the lights and reflections were stunning. We tried the langar food too. It was good and please do not take more than you can eat. Wastage is not a good thing. Btw the langar is open 24x7 and it's free. The se food is served to everyone regardless of status or class or any other worldy divides . In the house of God all men are equal. This message is personified here in every way. Please note that all women should wear a head cover (no caps) and the same goes for men too. If you don't have any, there is one available for just 10rs. Per piece at many locations before you enter. It's easy to walk from the main Street but an electric auto-rikshaw is available for 5 rs/person. Photography is allowed at certain locations only and cameras can be taken inside with no extra charge. P.S. do take a seat the steps near the water and let the feeling of calm sink in. A very pure place to be indeed."
289,A must,It was much better than what i expected. Outstanding serene and beautiful at sundown. This Friday 7th Feb was the birthday of the 7th Guru so there was a special darshan and fire works etc. it was awesome to be there to witness it. Its a must to visit
290,Simply Awesome,Make a point to visit temple in night . Its hypnotizing and a leisurely stroll on boulevard  like surrounding is worth taking.
291,"Being Punjabi, Golden Temple is one of my hearts !","It's as usual a great place to be in for a weekend,  a perfect mix of pleasure and devotional spirit. Worth visiting throughout the year and don't forget lunger, 8f you are there. A caution would be to be beware of pick pocketing in the markets around Golden Temple."
292,Just Beautiful / Blessings ,No words can describe this place. You have to see it to believe how amazing it is. The children enjoyed themselves so much and wanted to go back. Its a holy place that welcomes everyone.
293,Bliss,We were fortunate enough to go at night to say the view was spectacular would be an understatement Be respectful men have to have their heads covered you can by an orange scarf for 10rups ...you can watch the parade of the holy book It is busy however you just seem to find room ..A brief word of warning you have to remove shoes and socks and it can be quite slippy negotiating stairs ..What ever you do don‚Äôt miss an opportunity to visit this temple
294,Stunning,Incredibly clean well managed place with a great peaceful vibe. Not to be missed at all.Lines can be a bit long at times. So plan with some time in hand.
295,Amazing,"Best decision to reach the temple at 3:45 a.m. Unforgettable views, mild breeze, heartfelt gurbani...jo machhli bin paniye kyon jeevan paye."
296,Golden temple,"I‚Äôm not religious at all, in fact I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm an atheist but there is something about this place. I‚Äôll call it humanity. Loved the fact of everyone helping everyone."
297,MOST DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE EVER.,Some experiences are difficult to describe. This is one of them. Simply go and immerse yourself into the Calm Spirituality of the place.
298,Stunning ,"You can feel so much at peace with yourself. The ambience, the vibe is so amazing. This place is so serene. It‚Äôs The highest place of worship of sikhs. If you need to experience the real thing, come at around 3am in the morning. What you‚Äôll witness at this hour is going to be simply out of the world. You‚Äôll feel that you need to visit over and over again to just be here and do nothing. They‚Äôre very strict when it comes to following the rules. Whether you‚Äôre a nobody or a celebrity, it doesn‚Äôt matter, you‚Äô have to stand in the same queue in order to enter the holy ‚ÄúDarbar Sahib‚Äù."
299,Divine place,It was fantastic.  I wouldn't know where to start to describe this fantastic place other than to say it should be on everyone's bucket list
