0,impressed and respect,famous hindu place in mauritius and around the whole region even a lot of visitors fly in for special celebrations from india and souht africa. two big statues and others to see.
1,Statues and shrines,I saw this lake and temples from airplane when I become on Mauritius. Hindu people coming every day on this place. In lake is and water from holly river Ganga
2,GREAT NIGHT TO THE LORD OF SHIVA üïâÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôè,Visited here on a tour of the south of Mauritius.  There were a lot of people there praying etc so felt it was wrong to take photos. Our guide explained to us all about the different gods and their significance which we found very interesting. We also walked up to the viewpoint which has great views of the area and surrounding areas although this was a bit of a trek up the hill to those who aren‚Äôt very fit!Would recommend to others if touring the south of the country.
3,amazing place,Visited the Ganga Talao on the 23rd November 2017.  Absolutely beautiful place and a must visit in Mauritius.Priest was very accommodating at the temple.
4,Great temple of God Shiva! Must visit place!,"The Ganga Talao is the most visited religious places in Mauritius.The priest is very welcoming and eager to do your prayer, but the temple itself is in dire need for an upgrade.From the money being generated this is the most untidy, unkept temple that I have visited. The statues‚Ä¶"
5,Worth visit,"This is the most popular  Hindu temple in south Mauritius.Almost all the Gods are there with beautiful idols.Situated near a water body ,this is a must visit  place"
6,In awe with Mauritian people,"Again a beautifully curated temple in the island and this one has a long following and beliefs of people but I am not a temple type of tourist hence the journey here was not something I enjoyed. Since I am from India,it was just great to know such followership in an African country. The statues of Lord Shiva and Maa Durga were a sight though"
7,Temples ,"A very beautiful area and temple to visit during a tour over the south of Mauritius. The view is great, very interesting to see and you can enter the temple itself. Near the temple there are two very large Hindu statues, where a lot of monkeys spend their time running and playing around."
8,Indian Culture,Very honoured to be in Mauritius during this festival and see hundreds of people making their pilgrimage to the holy lake.We actually visited the Grand Bassin the very next day and it was nice to see although the many visitors had certainly left their mark on the area as it was very dirty with rubbish strewn everywhere....if only us humans could learn to keep the planet tidy!
9,Mrs Naidoo,The talao was maintained by Hindu Community in the country of Mauritius and they need standing ovation for maintaining the tradition even after 150 years.
10,"Great location, very touristy",The temple and the talao is one of the most peaceful place in mauritius. You can feed fishes AMD the bell chimes from temple make the place so calm. A must visit.
11,Visited as part of a trip arround the island,"Very nice and holy place for Indian people. They come here to pray. There are 52 percent of Mauritian people are Hindu, so this place is never empty. There are around 7 temples in the area and between them a lake which was form by volcano."
12,Great visit,It‚Äôs a religious Hindu site and a worship place and it‚Äôs nice to see it in Mauritius! On arrival you are greeted by two of the biggest statues in Southern Hemisphere so it‚Äôs very impressive!
13,Hindu temple,This is the best hindu temple in the Mauritius. There is a river touching the temple with small fishes touching one's feet. There r shrines of many hindu gods and the place is really religious. A must visit site in Mauritius
14,Awesomely postive energy,"A sprawling layout of Hindu temples spread out wide. You can find the locals visiting the place with a lot of reverence who come seeking divine blessings. Quite happy to spend a couple of hours exploring the place. Happy to see the cleanliness and well maintained area.A word of advise, park your car ahead and closer to the temple rather than at the first parking. Else you will have to walk quite a bit."
15,An interesting experience,"Has loads of temples with different Hindu gods around a lake. Its a must visit if you believe in Hindu religion. Place around it it very good . We combined the visit with Seven Colored sands, Victoria falls & charmel. Loads of natural parks around the route "
16,Average,"What a nice place, good place to know about Hindu and their traditions, it‚Äôs quiet and peaceful, the view is amazing, the lake is beautiful, it‚Äôs so busy by the end of January and the beginning of February other than that it‚Äôs nice and quiet you must visit."
17,A hindu temple,"great place to mind and soul relaxation, i feel very good when i visit a ganga talao grand besin i come every month this place ."
18,Beautiful and unique,"Was quite mesmerised by looking all Indian gods at one place. The place is so spiritual having Lord Shiva‚Äôs only linga outside India and also having shrines of other Hindu gods, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavira, etc."
19,Amazing Hindu experience,An interesting tourist place but at the same time a place of Hindu worship. A complex with different statues - very big and very small - of various deities.
20,Amazingly spiritual and humbling place,A lovely temple recommended to visit in Mauritius. You are greeted by the huge statues of Lord Shiva and Durga Maa before entering the temple. The statues are visible from a great distance.
21,Try come on a festival day,"To appreciate this sight it helps to understand that hundreds of thousands of the Hindu faith walk to sight from all over the Island each February. This helps to explain the size of the site and the many seating areas around the extensive lake. The temple itself is relatively modest but visitors are welcome - with shoes left outside. There are some interesting shrines inside as well as shrines to specific Hindu Gods outside on the edge of the Lake. Overlooking the site is an enormous Statue of Shiva, a beacon to the faithful. It must be a spectacular sight during the pilgrimage but probably best viewed on TV rather than in person."
22,Grand Basin - spiritual experience,Ganga talao is very good place to visit..It has one of the  most famous  Jyotirling ( shiv Temple)..  Near ganga talao approx more than 100 feet tall  lord Shiv  murti installed..
23,Not worth the drive,Lovely to visit this sacred lake. Very peaceful and beautiful views from the top - worth a visit to this beautiful place
24,"Maha Shivratree, Great Night of Shiva","Religious place for the hindo religion ,, very nice and organized with all the holy lake , our tourist guide explained all, it was nice to know about other cultures and religions,,,"
25,Peaceful Location,Visited Ganga talav and the various temples made in vicinity.. It was very peaceful and almost all common dieties that Indians worship are there. There is even a place to do havan. To go around the entire place in you should have some time and be ready to climb up and down. Otherwise you can just visit the temple at the base. Overall a very serene place
26,Not to be skipped,It is the most important Hindu Pligrmage site in Mauritius. There is a belief that you must carry Gangajal from India and mix it in the waters of Ganga Talao. The lake is beautiful. When we went there was a heavy downpour. But this gave the whole place a mystic look because if the mist. It has huge open parking area. The teo imposing statutes of Shiva and Durga are very good. We could not enter the temples because of the weather.But had our Parathe besides the lake.It was a memorable experience.
27,A must visit,Big lake with various Hindu Temple to visit and open for every religion. There is also big Statue of God Shiva and Maa Durga. This Lake is full of Fish which will fascinate you.
28,Temple Run,"The movement you come to this place, you will think as you are in India, It's peaceful and calm. Temple is beautiful, the story of its origin is amazing. a must to visit on your South Island Tour. Great journey to this place."
29,Calm and pious location! Extremely beautiful ,"Out of festivals, this place is very calm and you can enjoy a stroll just by yourself or accompannied by couple of monkeys. Teples close quite early, so come before 3pm."
30,Fascinating,"Good place to visit and get blessings.. Elegant temple structure and beautiful sculptures..  At a short distance from the location, one can see big statues of Lord Shiva and Goddess Durga.. A must watch!"
31,Temple complex,A beautiful Hindu Temple setting entered by a long road which brings you to Lord Shiva and Lord Durga statues.  In 1972 a Hindu priest from India poured sacred water from the Ganges into the lake introduced the name Ganga Talao. In the temple setting devotees will be praying to Hindu deities with offering of fruits or vegetables. Incense sticks are abundant providing a welcome aroma. There is definitely a spiritual feeling walking around the temple grounds.  Small shrines and colorful statutes such as Lord Ganesh (elephant) dedicated to popular Hindu deities adorn the edge of the lake.  Admission is free but donations are accepted.  A few coconut eating monkeys bounce around the grounds.  You will be able to walk into the actual small temple but you will have to remove your shoes.  Most visitors do not know that you can actually walk up to the small door on each side of the central entrance and view the offerings ceremony that takes place.  Parking is not a problem.  Definitely a worthwhile visit for the family.
32,Beautiful and serene lake,"This place is on the tourist trail so you will be surrounded by many other people - we visited quite a few temples and had some places to ourselves so whilst this is an impressive site, there are other temples that are far less crowded.  The Shiva statues are huge and it is fun to watch the monkeys"
33,"Even if not religious, great place to visit for cultural insight","Part of south tour, Hindu temple well maintained and clean. Almost all Hindu deities can be found here.dress appropriately"
34,Worth visiting but all a bit overwhelming if you're not religious,"A Must See for All because this is one of the Iconic Cultural places to visit in Mauricius. In Grand Bassin you can see tall status of Lord Shiva and Lord Durga, the hindu temple is very beautiful and the harmony and the history is amazing."
35,Stop off on tour of South Mauritius ,Fortunate to have visited here in February at the time of the Hindu festival Maha Shivratri so got to witness part of the pilgrimage and the many prayers and offerings being made to the many colourful shrines here
36,A mini India in Mauritius,"Ganga Talao - Grand Bassin, is the lake like area surrounded with Temples and Large Statues of Shiva and Durga. A must visit for those who serve Hinduism. For the rest, you are witness the grand art and monuments."
37,South tour ,"Very tall impressive statues of Hindu Gods, One of most interesting places on the island.  calm and peaceful. the volcanic lake- house a range of fishes and you can touch them as they are fearless of humans, Climb the top of the hills and discover rare plant/ flowers only found in Mauritius. You can pray and receive the blessing by priest on site, watch out for the monkeys, friendly but they can snatch your bags or cameras they are merely looking for food they are fond of bananas.Many other statues can be seen, the landscape and forest are untouched."
38,Blesses,Although there are many tourists I was amazed with the open and friendly attitude of the Hindi. The atmosphere is very serene and quiet. If only every religion was so peacefull.
39,Peaceful,"Visited several times, seeking the blessing of the holy site. It gets very busy during the week long Shivarathri Festival. Seen the dedicated locals  that observe a fast and pull chariots that they have built and beautifully adorned themselves from their hometowns to the holy site.  Plenty of food stall at the site during the festivities. To appreciate the beauty of the lake and the little temples dotted around, it's best to visit after or before the Shivarathri period which is usually between February and March each year. The exact dates are based on the moon cycle, hence the change in dates each year. The new Shiva and Sakthi statues that flank the entrance are worth the visit. Very tranquil space."
40,Temple,"An interesting spot, I visited on a Sunday so many locals there praying and paying respect. Was a very tranquil and spiritual place, a few monkeys around the place and it was nice to see families and a variety of festive colours, better than your average temple."
41,Visit with friends,You can see the giant statues of Shiva and goddess Durga. A place to pray and to see giant eels coming near to be fed.a lake of plenty fishes and peaceful place with the sound of the bell ringing all day long
42,"Very interesting, unique on the island",The Grand Bassin is a holy lake for Mauritian of Hindu faith and the Hindus of Mauritius declared it a Holy lake. By the lake is a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and other Gods. Overlooking the lake is the statue of Mangal Mahadev (Shiva statue) which is of 33 meters (the highest statue in Mauritius).
43,Holy Temple by the Lake,Being an indian I wanted to visit this place. Pond surrounded by templates and felt true inner peace.
44,Great religious and spiritual experience,One of most interesting places in the island. Really Asian -Indian atmosphere there - calm and peaceful. U can touch to the Indian gods there . Very funny monkeys come the play from the forest.
45,Highly recemmended,It was amazing seeing all the buildings and landmarks/statues. Our guide mentioned the pilgrimage that takes place up towards this area.
46,Iconic Cultural Place,"One of the most tranquil and serene places on earth  which is situated in the south of the country, it is a MUST go place to visit ."
47,Visit if you are a devotee,A very peaceful & energizing place. As you go to the hill you will see a giant Shiva statue which is amazing so something like this outside India! You can feed fishes in the pond and get blesseings from small temples of different hindu gods.
48,An abode for many Indian gods!,"A serene and peaceful area, the place has many Hindu Gods. Some are even placed in the lake - which is not very common in the temples. It was great to see so much devotion in a place so far from India."
49,Interesting cultural site,It is a very peaceful and spiritual place. There are many hindu temples around. Wild monkeys are one of the biggest attractions there as they eat the fruits offerings placed from the devotees to god. Many fish and eels are omnipresent in the sacred lake. Tall statues are also big attractions there.
50,Place of calmness,"The idols of Durga and shiv ji are a one time see. They are not huge and nothing spectacular purely from tourists view point. The temple is nice and calm and silent. From a religious point of view, it is a good place to go. I am sure during shiv ratri it would be a must visit spot"
51,nice temple,"Ganga Talao and the surrounding temples is a significant religious site in Mauritius. I was lucky enough to visit on a festival day, Ganesh Chaturthi, so the temples and lake were full of life and colour with people chanting and worshiping and making offerings to Ganesh.  It truly was an experience. Even on a non-festival day the giant statues of Shiva and Durga Mata are impressive and the lake offers a lovely place to stroll around. And if you are visiting the Petrin side of the Black River Gorges National Park its only a few minute's drive from the park entrance."
52,A serene spiritual place,Grest place to go! Specially now as Maha Shivratri is about to start so the preparations and decorations is worth looking for. Apart the view is spectacular! Get the positive vibes and the spiritual feeling is very intriguing as one would feel surrounded by god's eternity
53,Tranquility and Hindi,We recently visited to perform the Shivrathri Prayer. This is such an amazing place and each year in February thousands of people visit to perform the prayer dedicated to our Lord Shiva. One is at peace at this tranquil surrounding.
54,Calm oasis - worth a visit,once u r here u feel u r in india. with devotional songs played at the background it has a beautiful temple with a lake in the front
55,Ganga Talao,"You will be welcomes by the tallest idol( of Southern Hemisphere) of Lord Shiva and Maa Durga on both sides of the highway.The grandeur of the idols will awe you. Then comes the Ganga Talao - the sacred lake of the HIndus with the idols of various HIndu Gods and a couple of temples on its bank where you can pray , ring the bell and get prasad"
56,Well worth a visit just to view the statues,"Nice place.Good trip for tourists as they can book 1full day to do Mare aux vacoas reservoir,then go to Grand Bassin.Then you get Alexandra falls.Then you have the amazing view of Black river gorges.then finally do chamarel 7coloured earth.It is on the same way.:)hope this helps."
57,Amazing area,"very peaceful, calm temple to visit. We were on the tour so did not get to spend too much time there, but will definitely go there again"
58,Ganga Talao,"We visited Ganga Talao as part of the South Mauritius guided tour offered by the travel agent. I understand the Ganga Talao name inherited from River Ganges India as the water from the holy river was immersed in the lake to make is holy place. Temple complex situated at the Ganga Talao  hosts various gods but mainly Lord Shiva. Few meters away from the temple before entering you find two very tall statues of Lord Shiva and Goddess Durga. The temple sacred and well maintained. I was told that during Sivaratri temple gets huge number of visitors.  Priests are very friendly and with no special dress code, I find lot of foreigners visiting this place."
59,"Ganga talao, Mauritius","very beautiful place. but if you are not indian you should first read about this religion, because this place is holy for them. this is not place for tourists"
60,relaxing,"It was good to see how the 5th generation Hindu migrant families have preserved the culture. The crater of the volcano filled with water has been added ‚ÄúGanga jal‚Äù, thereby making it revered place."
61,Nice,Went there on the 1st of Jan. Was a bit crowded. Clean place. Lots of temples to do prayers. Relaxing moments.
62,Amazing Place to Visit ,You will like the place if you are devotee. It is primarily a temple with very tall statues of Lord Shiva and Durga devi.No other activities at this place.
63,Awful ,Popular tourist attraction and prayer site for locals. The foggy weather builds up an atmosphere. Hiking up the hill is a plus to get a panoramic view and for photos.
64,Amazing ,"We drove from the hotel to Ganga Talao to see the temples and offer a few prayers. The imposing statues of Lord Shiva & Durga (each 108 ft high) as you enter the temple complex fills you with a sense of awe and reminds you of how minuscule you are in the greater scheme of the universe.Entry to the temple complex is free(don't let your guide tell you otherwise). Th temple priests are friendly, helpful and understand that the temple complex is as much a religious sites a tourist attraction. Blessings and offerings can be done with the help of the priest (for FREE with NO NEED to buy any special prayer goods before hand) and there is no compulsion to put anything in the donation boxes, though a courteous donation of Rs 200 would suffice for a group of 4 visitors.A walk up to the Hanuman shrine at the top of the hill overlooking the lake is a must. The view is amazing. Although the walk is easy, there are steps (very good concrete steps and walkways with hand rails and rest points).The kids were amazed at the fish in the lake. We fed the fish with pieces of bread and there were shoals of 100s of fish (including tilapia and 2 or 3 other species).The grounds are well kept, parking is well laid out and marked and entrance is FREE. The ablutions are very neat, clean and tidy. A must for the culture vulture and spiritual traveller as well as the general sight seeing trip as well"
65,Impressive,"This was on my tick list for Mauritius having read many reviews, inland and high up. We had a car as we were touring the island.It is obvious on the approach road that this must attract huge crowds for Hindu celebrations as it was three lanes each side and lots of parking.You cannot miss the huge statues as you approach, we got out here for pictures and were greeted by lots of wild monkeys, who obviously are used to tourists and being fed.  A guy had taken lots of bananas and the daddy made sure he had the lions share of them.A little further on will take you to the lake and the temples, it was quite busy.. lots of statues on the edge of the lake and a priest blessing everyone who asked.We also witnessed a ceremony with fire, singing and bells, lovely smell of incense and very calm.I would of loved to see a big celebration like Diwali, it must be amazing."
66,Mesmerized,"The entire culture of India was at display at the Ganga Talao ... the statues, temple and the pond much neater and cleaner than the ones we find in India.What a positive energy."
67,You cannot but be impressed,"Considered an incarnation of Ganges in Mauritius, local Mauritian Hindus consider this lake holy and take annual pilgrimage during the 'night of Shiva' (Shiva-ratri). The lake is teeming with fishes and life and surrounding the lake are dozen or so temples of various deities in Hindu panteon including those of Buddhists and Jains."
68,2nd most important place for Hindus,The temple and Shiva statue are in a very peaceful location. Only managed to take a look at the statue as we were driving through. There were no crowds and parking was easy.
69,"""Immersive and lovely experience""","The Grand Bassin is a lovely area, with lots of temples and culture.If entering a temple make sure you are respectful.Plenty of wildlife running around too.  Also, lots of walking involved so wear appropriate footwear.There is a toilet block"
70,Interesting,The attraction that beckons people in are the tall statues of deities. As a holy place we found it serene and there is no one there who hassles you for money which is a contrast if you visit some holy places in India.There are various small temples inside but they are less interesting and of course there is the crater lake which is an important pilgrimage site in February.
71,Part of south west tour,"We went to see Grand Basin this year and it was truly fantastic place! You can see a lot of colourful monuments, also there are small boards with information about gods. The main temple is just beautiful, the music is addictive. If you are lucky, you can observe the rituals performed by locals. Also, monkeys are hanging around, so be sure to find them!I've made a short music film about this temple on YouTube: Mauritius - Temples & Monkeys - 4K(2:25 - Ganga Talao/Grand Bassin)One disadvantage is that the place is located at the top of hill/mountain, so it's windy, at least in July-August. Just take a jacket and you'll be OK."
72,Serene Hindu temple,A place of deep spiritual value of you are Hindu. Even if you are not of you get there early there is a definite feeling of other worldlyness. Get there when it is busy and it's like any other tourist sight. Would not go there just for this but as part of a visit to the central Highlands
73,Serene,one of the best things that you can see in Mauritius. being an Indian you must visit there. There is a temple of lord Shiva and its 13 jyotirlinga there. Two amazing tall status of Shiva and maa durga are there at the entrance.
74,"Shiva, Durga and Ganga talao",Very impressive statues of Hindu gods . Make sure to go with someone who has knowledge about the Hindu faith who can tell you stories about all the different gods. It makes the visit so much more interesting.
75,Okay,Temple is located next to lake. This temple has so many Statue of god & goddess. One will connect to your inner peace when here. Regular prayers are done to Lord Shiva & other gods here.
76,Nice place of interest.,"We visited the holy site of Hindus in Mauritius. Truly spectacular, with nice temples, statues, all set against the backdrop of a beautiful lake. However it is very touristy (and we added to that, I realize), which detracts from the experience somewhat.I would.recommend seeing this while in Mauritius. It is special"
77,Serene,"A little magical place, with a unique atmosphere.The entrance is guarded by the great figures Shiv and Durga. There are several Hindu temples in the area. We came across a ceremony with fire, singing and bells, a wonderful smell of incense and breaking coconuts. With the same broken coconut you can bless a new car on the spot, we have also witnessed such a ceremony. The place is very peaceful and definitely worth a visit."
78,Sacred place,The fact that this is also the place of the 13th jyotirlinga is a divine thing. the place houses idols of so many hindu gods and that it is maintained better than any temple in india is amazing to see and feel.
79,Very nice to see during South tour over Mauritius,"We visited Ganga Talao as part of our tour of the South part of the Island. The giant Shiv and Durga statues that greet you as you arrive are breathtaking. The actual Temple by the lake is a nice size, and offers the ability for you to take part in a puja (blessing) to Shiv - this was a lovely touch, and was actually the first religious ceremony that my husband and I engaged in after getting married, so it will always be a special moment for us (despite neither of us being particularly religious). The deities of various different Gods around the lake are beautifully made and prove a real sense of beauty, calm and serenity. We really enjoyed this part of our trip and would say it is definitely worth a visit."
80,Colourful & Spiritual ,"These temples/statues are along the ""Scenic Route"" in the southern part of the island. We passed through on our way from the tea plantation to the seven colors area. The statues are simply huge and the pedestrian walkways on the side of the roads gives you an indication of how many people come for the ceremonies here. For us, it was worth a pass through but that's about it."
81,It is worth visiting to get to know the Hindu culture,An amazing experience. A sacred site for Hindus but a marvellous place for meditation for people of other religions or none
82,Just beautiful,"Amazing Hindu experience. Not the most fancy Hindu Temple from the outside, but has a special air about the place and all the Beautifull statues around with sacrificial offerings, makes it unique.It is a Big place surrounding the sacred Lake, where you are more than welcome to entrer the different areas, as long as you respect the area and the hindu people there doing their prayers."
83,Peaceful,"Even for non-hindus interesting to look at. Your guide will explain to you, what people use this temple for and everything about its history.As luck would have it, we were there while a wedding was going on and were able to witness that."
84,Temple with peaceful surrounding,This place definitely has much spiritual energy. The vibe is amazing. So peaceful and calm. Rich in history as well. We were fortunate that the head priest was present and offered us the chance to do a small prayer. That was so special
85,Stunning Hindu Temple - A real sense of serenity!,"As an Indian, we weren't too keen on visiting a temple in Mauritius. We have seen a lot back home. But it was a part of our south island tour so we went anyways. It started raining profusely by the time we reached there. Its a nice temple with a huge Lord Shiva statue."
86,Lovely temple,"Beautiful place, nice to get to know hinduism and see How People practise it. Dress respectfully. There is a really good street food restaurant in the side of the road to grand bassin. Really delicious and cheap snacks."
87,Lovely place and fantastic statues - the biggest in Southern Hemisphere! ,"The grandness, cleanness and culture enriching experience we felt at this place. Spiritual energy and divinity can be found in any place which are serene is defined by this very place...a must visit."
88,Fascinating religous site !,The temple is worth the visit and we enjoyed it. The place was quite peaceful and clean. The new two (2) Shiva statue are huge and stunning . All the statues around the lake had been decorated for an upcoming festival and they were stunningThis place is really spiritually fulfilling . One can feel the vibrations when praying to all the different Hindu Gods. Overall: highly recommended
89,Pride of humanity - God- Meet - Human,"If you are intrested of hinduism, this will be good place for a visit. Otherwise its just a lake, some statues (tho i have to be honest, shiva and parvati statues were cool!) and monkeys. You can get a blessing or something if you want, we didnt cos i dont think religioin suppose to be part of tourist entertainment. But place, all in all were nice, lots of trash wich was kinda sad to see."
90,Knowing others...,"A lot of places to visit. From the top hill beautiful surrounding view. Free car park, no entry fees."
91,Beautiful hindu temple,"We visited here‚Äôs as the final stop on a tour in the south west. On arriving you see the large statues of the gods which are beautiful of shiva and lord Durga. You look tiny against a picture next to these. When walking up to the temple there are loads of monkeys beware as they steal any food or your handbag if left. The temple is so beautiful the pink building at the top of the river and the large building surround by statues of the Hindu gods. The river had so many fish that could be clearly seen and you just felt such an energy when on the grounds. You had the option of going in and making a blessing which we did, I respectfully took my shoes off and covered my shoulders as much as I could with the shawl I had taken. As mentioned you felt the energy in the temple and we came out feeling great. After a good look around all the statues we made our way back. It was a great final stop and it has a great energy to it. I believe it can be very busy in February for one of their festivals. Definatley worth a visit."
92,Astonishing Site,"Wow !    We stumbled across this almost my accident , very memorable, a must see for all faiths and atheists alike.  The glorious statues are mind blowing and very humbling."
93,Ganga Talao or Grand Basin ,So we are driving to the black gorge and nature reserve and it was suggested we pass through Ganga Talao to see the Hindu Temples.  The scenery in the area was like a lush rainforest.  There is a large highway heading into this area and what a surprise is waiting when you drive toward two huge Hindu Gods.  The shear size of the gods truly makes you say WOW!  Knowing nothing about the area it became apparent that this is an area of pilgrimage for the Hindu faith.  There were able parking facilities.  Beautiful brightly coloured temples and statues surrounding a large lake.  There are monkeys at the main pink temple but they don‚Äôt bother you as they are feed fruits so nice to take photos.  The place is such a surprise in the middle of a nature reserve.  Plenty of public bathrooms/toilets too. Well worth the visit.
94,Amazing experience on Mauritius,A calm and sombre place with the beauty of the idols of gods and goddesses partially in the water flooded with the small fish in abundant number. Small but beautiful temple with a typical style of teeka (vermillion) applied on the forehead. One must visit the place.
95,Very memorable experience,"This is worth spending time and having an informed guide , the two large statues followed by the temple and the figurines of the gods were very interesting and presented a great photo opportunity"
96,Interesting but only an hours worth of viewing,"We came here to see the big statues that are kind of landmarks here.There are giant figures and it‚Äôs amazing to see just how much big they really are.After a little bit of walking around we came to a temple where you get a blessing from a sham-men for prosperity, health and good partnership.The Hindi people come here to get a blessing for finding a wife or to find a relationships.This place is very spiritual even if your not an Hindu... just come here and enjoy the great smell of incense in the air and maybe you can get a blessing for a good match ü§©"
97,History of Hindu people,"An interesting cultural site for Hindus and non-Hindus alike.  Our taxi driver, a Tamil, was able to give us a lot of background on the statues, the temples, and the religious practices.  As a non-Hinud, I wouldn't make a special trip to visit, but if you are in the South and want to take a sight-seeing tour while you are there, it is definitely worth a stop and a look around.  The site was peaceful and well-maintained."
98,Jai Maa,"Its location is beautiful, spread on a side of natural lake. Just meters before the temple, there are two 36-meter tall statues of God Shiva and Goddess Durga, on either side of the road. A calm and relaxing place, could have sat for hours looking onto the lake.When you are able to visit this place, take few more steps up to Hanoman temple. The view from up here is even more stunning! You will see other parts of this beautiful island too."
99,Amazon visit and temple ,"Ganga Talao literally means Ganga Tank. There is a serene  lake/tank where the temple is situated. Most Hindu temples have a large water body -- a tank --- next to them. And since River Ganga is a sacred water body for the Hindus, this tank has been named after the Ganga. As soon as you enter the area you notice two giant holy idols before you. Goddess Durga and Lord Shiva. They are both over a 100 feet tall, made out of solid concrete and steel. The Shiva icon is easily the tallest in Mauritius, and may be one of the biggest Hindu Shiva statues in the world. Further down is the Shiva Temple itself, on the banks of the serene lake/tank. Our taxi driver (a faithful Hindu) advised us not to go inside, because we had not taken the ritual bath and observed fasting or other rituals. Being Hindus ourselves, we did not want to disrespect local customs,  so we sought divine blessings from outside.I am not sure if this ritual was a strictly enforced mandate or a just a tradition; but we believed that it is best to follow local customs wherever we go. You could check with a local before you visit the temple.On the other side of the lake is a ""Spiritual Park"" which not only has Shiva, but also other Deities like Hanuman, Gayatri, Rama and so on. There was also an idol of Sri Mahavira who is greatly venerated by people belonging to the Jain Religion and Shirdi SaiBaba, a Sufi spiritual leader worshiped by both Hindus and Muslims. In that sense the Spiritual Park was truly eclectic.  People of all religions come here.We visited Ganga Talao on a weekday, and this was just few days after the celebration of an important Hindu festival called Maha Sivaratri. So the Ganga Talao was empty and we had a peaceful visit. I was told that on festival days there are huge crowds and there is hardly standing room in the temples. The Gods were kind to us, but it would be best to check with a local, so that you avoid crowded periods."
100,Lord Shiva Pilgrimage,I wasn't too bothered about visiting here as I'd seen many temples in India. However the taxi driver suggested we should stop and take a look - so glad we did. Down from the impressive statues one can wander around the fish filled lake and relax - watching the monkey doing their things and generally taking everything in. Enjoy...
101,great visit,We loved this place. We were fortunate to be with an Hindu friend who explained to us the various rituals surrounding the temples. This place is so beautiful
102,Ganga Talao,"This is one of the worst places I have visited. Lake is not scared, full of rubbish and banana skins which were are meant to feed the ‚Äúgods‚Äù. How about feed the dogs that roam around, malnourished and in a bad way, no instead feed the invisible gods. Boxes everywhere to put donations in. No thanks. We left within seconds. Appalling. Will advise anyone who goes to Mauritius to never go here."
103,Seeking Divinity,The temple is simple structure with many Hindu Gods. The lake is very nice and it is a peaceful place.
104,A very special spot in Mauritius,"This is just another average hindu temple and being an Indian, you can actually give it a skip. Yes, the view around was good and the lake was peaceful but there is a lot of other places in Mauritius to spend your precious time at. However, if you are not an Indian, please visit here. The priest will go extra length to give you satisfactory dose of spirituality and you might enjoy seeing a lot of Hindu diety idols in a single place with a good view of the lake."
105,Go if your are not Indian,"Visited this beautiful temple with our driver for the day. What a tranquil spiritual place, truly awe inspiring."
106,Great Experience,"We saw it on the way to tea plantation and just had to stop and see. It's beautiful even for those who don't know Hindu, very impressive and spacious place to make you realize how important it is for Mauritians."
107,"Peaceful location, beautiful lake","The Big Lord Shiva Statue is a sign of true spirituality and describes that size does not matter - every poor is a rich and every rich is a poor because money, arrogance and position can‚Äôt define the purpose of our life - what defines the purpose of life is service to humanity and Grand Bassin is a place to service to humanity despite of your religion, ethnic, color and nationality. This place simply connects god and his creatures so called humans through spirituality, love and kindness. If you are fan of meditation then it‚Äôs a must visit place for you in Mauritius. You have most of the gods here from Hinduism. Nine planet temple is so special and spiritual and tells us the definition and power of each planet. The incredible Ganga Talao is filled with small and big beautiful fishes.... all I can say at the end OM NAMAH SHIVAY...... Glory to Lord Shiva.... it‚Äôs a heaven where you get the opportunity to meet your god and try to find the difference between heart and soul."
108,MOST SACRED PLACE FOR THE HINDU ON THE ISLAND,"We visited this place in the last part of our trip to Mauritius.It is in south Mauritius.As you arrive near to the temple two huge statues of ""Devi Maa Durga"" and ""Lord Shiva""bless you.A little ahead Ganga Talao is situated,where many temples are there.Main attaraction is temple of ""Lord Shiva"".A huge water body is there,which is known as Ganga Talao.It was informed that long ago some priests had brought holy water of river Ganga from India and poured in this place.Since then ,this water body is known as Ganga Talao and rain water get collected here.It has become a religious place for hindus of this country."
109,Average Temple with a lake  ,Beautiful experience.. very peaceful and serene ..definitely recommend especially if u are a hindu..Fed monkeys and did some yoga at feet of Lord Shiva!
110,Wow,"Beautiful temple and statues (of Shiva and Durga) in a peaceful, lakeside setting. Even if you're not Hindi (or religious in any way), it's still a tranquil place to visit."
111,Ok,"We wanted to skip it but our driver convinced us to visit the place. It is nice but nothing wow. If you are interested in Hindu culture then it is a place to go for sure, otherwise do not bother. It looked bit dated to us."
112,Very Relaxing,"Worth a visit. Nice lake in the crater of dead volcano. Very peaceful, but we did go in quiet season."
113,Serenity at its best,"It was a very solemn place to be when I visited. I was one of only maybe 10 people there but I have been told in peak season hundreds make a pilgrimage to Ganga Talao, the tradition is to walk there bare foot I believe. It has recently really rejuvenated as I visited once around 6 years ago where it seemed run down. A great visit for Hindu‚Äôs and all religions alike."
114,Hindu temple,"Loved this, from the giant statues on entry to monkeys, lake and temple. Dress appropriately, even though lots of tourists don't. We visited on a Sunday when lots of Hindus were leaving offerings, which added to the atmosphere,l. We didn't enter the actual temple as we didn't want to intrude"
115,Wow what a surprise!,"""OM NAMAH SHIVAYA""Every year in the month of February we celebrate the maha shivaratree to the lord of Shiva. We do our sacrifice for the pelgrimage to walk through grand bassin to celebrate the ceremony of ganga jals mostly my pleasure to invite all of you happy maha shivaratree and all the tourist coming ur pleasure to visit and do prayerüôè"
116,Beautiful temple on the island,"We did it with our friend from Mauritus. We just hired car and he showed us a lot of interesting places in Maurtius including this one. We had really bad wheater, was very cold and raining, we had to put heating on in car to warm up:))) So if you are going to visit, this part of island be prepared! It is very peaceful. Also you can experience beautifull view on almost whole island, if you are lucky with wheather!"
117,WOW,What a fantastic place to visit even if you are not the religious type.Amazing statues at both locations.I would say that this was the best place we visited on Mauritius.There are toilet facilities down at the lake location.Plenty of parking at both locations.Well worth a visit.
118,South of island tour,"If you are a traveler that enjoys learning about other cultures and traditions, this place is for you. The tranquil atmosphere, and beautiful scenery will take anyone's breath away. We got there just as it started to rain, and it couldn't have been better. The weather added to the beauty and grace of Grand Bassin. Locals come from all over the island to worship and pay their respects here, and it was such a honor to witness this. I would definitely recommend stopping by here for a bit."
119,Interesting and educational,"The complex is big, so make sure you allow for enough time (2+ hours) to visit everything without a rush. There are people giving offerings to the monkeys by the lake shore. The walk to the temple at the top is worth it - even on a hot day - the view from the top is stunning. Informative and unique experience for young children who have not had prior exposure to the Hindu religion"
120,Nice place to visit,"On our day trip through the southwest and the center of this island we had to see this 33 m (108 ft) tall sculpture of the Hindu god Shiva standing with his Trishula (trident) at the entrance of Ganga Talao (Grand Bassin), a crater lake situated in the district of Savanne in Mauritius, which is the tallest statue in Mauritius."
121,Ok,this was one of the best places in mauritius. i love it very much. it is calm and peaceful. have a lot of people. it is unique temple on the lake. great temple.
122,Hindu Temple Experience,"Before even arriving, it was amazing to see how really big the statues of Lord Shiva and Lord Durga were. Seeing them in pictures does not prepare you for how huge they are. My kids have never experienced anything other than a Christian church so they had an opportunity to learn while watching some of the locals attend and give offerings. Unfortunately it was very, very wet and misty so the views of the lake were not as clear as they would normally be, however this maybe even added to the atomospher at the end of the day. One must just remember that while this is one of the major tourist attractions, it is still a sacred place to others and this needs to be respected."
123,Amazing place,I was put off by the obvious disregard for the dress code observed by the people visiting the temple. Most religious places across the world have strict dress codes. I would blame the temple authorities for not enforcing it and pandering to tourism.
124,Pass Through,A visit to the Hindu Centre is a must for anyone seeking something beyond themselves. It is a truly humbling experience. The statues are enormous and the humility of the folks working at the centre is catching. I was humbled.
125,Decent,"From the two giant statues, to the the lakeside temples to the plethora of Hindu iconography you cannot be anything other than impressed and even if you have no particular interest in the religion itself it is a place that will bring a smile to your face and that can't be a bad thing. Go gawp."
126,Maha Shivratri,Nice experience. If the enter the temple as a foreigner the priests seem to go out of their way to involve you and really make you feel welcome.
127,Sacred Hindu location,"I visited as part of the Authentic South tour with Destination Soleil - see my review under the 'Destination Soleil' page.The Sacred Lake is definitely worth seeing, but it's all a bit overwhelming if you're not religious and don't know that much about Hinduism though - but I would recommend watching a YouTube video to see how busy the area gets during the Holy festival, when everyone makes a pilgrimage to the area, it's incredible!"
128,Holy lake with great temple of Lord Shiva,"Won't deny that the sights were pleasant to look at, but the temples were very average and I had to go as a family obligation. On my own or with friends I wouldn't think twice before I drop the Grand Bassin for something else."
129,A Day to Pray (& feed the fish),We visited here as part of an organised tour.  What an amazing place.  It was so calm and peaceful.  The statues at the entrance are huge - you don't really get the perspective from the photos.  Definitely somewhere to visit just avoid the loos!!!!
130,Shivrathri,Spiritually uplifting. Was most enthralled by the beauty of the nearby temples and shrines.  Will definitely re visit.
131,Impressive,"Ganga Talao consist of several temples dedicated to Hindu Gods and Goddesses, including a 33-m (108-ft) tall Shiva Statue. There is a little hike up to a peak where you can enjoy views of the lake and surroundings.Located in the South, it is a great visit to combine with Chamarel and Black River Park sights."
132,Beautiful crater lake with Hindu temples.,"If you are an Indian, this place will not interest you unless you are too religious.Average time spent by people is 2 hours but we only spent 20 min."
133,beautiful place,"An amazing area, very tranquil, and has a calming effect, with 2 of the tallest statues we have seen. Well worth a visit"
134,Peaceful,"This lake is sacred to Hindus, and as you approach along the main road, the first thing you see are two giant statues of Hindu gods.  From the car park you walk down to the lake, and I was amused to see that the water was so high, people were sitting on seats with their feet in the water!  But I expect this was done on purpose so that people could bathe their feet in the sacred water.  The modern temple has several shrines with images of gods, which are colourful and very impressive.  Nearby there is another temple with several buildings, also very impressive.  I enjoyed my visit as it made me feel as if I was back in India!"
135,Serene and clean ,We went here as part of a tour. It was brilliant to see locals praying and offering gifts to their gods. You can be blessed too if you wish. You do not have to pay to do so but they do say that there‚Äôs a donations box. A walk up some steps to see from a higher angle. I would say that if it‚Äôs not your religion then it‚Äôs only an hours worth of viewing but definitely worth popping in if you get the chance
136,Nice place for relax,"There are several shrines/temples and two giant statues surrounding a lake. There is a shrine up a hill, from where the view is beautiful. But since we don't follow Hinduism, didn't add much to our trip."
137,See as part of a tour of the central plateau,Bowled over by the statues of the Hindu gods just above the lake.  Our guide was very good at explaining the significance of each of the Hindu gods and the stories attached to each one.  A must place to visit.
138,Serene and peaceful ,We visited as part of our wild south tour with mautourco and we had a guide who was Hindu.It was great to see the statues and visit the lake. Learning about the gods at the same time.Great to see lots of monkeys walking around also.
139,Serene and peaceful,"This was a lovely little stop to add to the south tour. I was worried and had bought extra clothing with me to cover up before looking around however a lot of tourists walked around as they were (shorts, strappy tops etc) and the priests did not mind. There are two very large statues as you drive up. Then when you arrive to the body of water, it is surrounded by smaller statues of various Hindu gods. I didn‚Äôt enter the temple as I didn‚Äôt want to disturb anyone praying but there were zero restrictions and everyone was welcomed to join. 4/5"
140,Religious place ,Visit Grand Bassin in the morning. It was calm and full of Blessings. When we drove through we saw the big statues of Mangal Mahadeva and Durga Maa. Then we went to the crater lake and also visit the big temple by the lake then walk up the top of the hill. You can see an amazing view of the crater lake itself. In the way out we saw another beautiful temple with 108 Shivlings. It was amazing. There were loads of monkeys and the devotees were feeding them. A place I would recommend everyone to visit. Take with you a pure heart and you will feel the blessings there!
141,No pride,Our visit was on a very wet afternoon and it was very misty. I would like to go back on a clear day. The lack of visitors however meant it was so peaceful and tranquil. It is free to enter and walk around etc. you may leave a donation. I wish they would consider an entrance fee so the upkeep could be better.
142,To get your inner peace,"We visited Grand Bassin recently on the way to another part of the island..After reading a few mixed reviews prior to the trip I wasn‚Äôt sure it was actually worth going out of our way for but so glad we did!!We were met with a colourful array of Hindu God Statues overlooking a beautiful calm lake.It was such a beautiful sight on and despite there being a lot of people in the area it still felt peaceful.We had a driver who was kind enough to explain who each of the Gods were and what they symbolised(and any extra helpful information).I‚Äôd definitely recommend a visit when in Mauritius, it‚Äôs a fascinating place that everyone seems to come together in a lovely way."
143,Relaxing and Pious,"It is one of the rare natural lakes in Mauritius, formed inside the crater of an extinct volcano and is the renowned pilgrimage place for Mauritians of Hindu faith. Every year in February, during the Maha Shivaratri week, thousands of Hindus walk miles from every corner of the island to bring their gifts for Lord Shiva at Grand Bassin."
144,Lake side temple,"You should be interested in Hindu religion at least a bit in order to enjoy this visit, otherwise you will not find it attractive. For them this is the 2nd most important place of pilgrimage in the world with nice background story you can found in lonely planet pdf about it. The access is absolutly impressive with the huge road and place to park that is practically used fully only once per year when they gather there. Another impressive thing are 2 gigantesque sculpture that receives you at the entrance."
145,Intresting place,"There's not much to see here.  No information and the place is deserted.  Two huge statutes, a lake and some buildings which need repainting.  All in all,  a bit tatty"
146,Place of Pilgrimage,"It is amazing to experience the piece and tranquility when you are here,irrespective of your religion."
147,I am humbled,"After visiting the sites in the south of the island, we ended our day by visiting Grand bassin. It's an interesting spot for the hindu community but everyone can visit. Such a calm lake surrounded by small temples and there are 2 huge statues for the god Shiva and his wife (?). Worth for a 30 mins - 1 hour stop. It's free to enter, be aware that you need to climb down on stairs."
148,An Awesome Place to Experience Local Culture,I attended Ganga Talao with a group from my university on a misty day in January. The weather was not great but it actually added to the atmosphere. It was such an amazing place--very spiritual regardless of your religion. You couldn't help but come away with a sense of reverence for such a holy place in Hindu and Mauritian religious history. We happened to be there for the blessing of a couple and it was lovely to witness. We also were all blessed there too which was really nice. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Mauritius.
149,"Great place for Hindu worshippers, Big statues","Had a car for three days and this was on the ""to do"" list. We are not religious at all but its always good to go and broaden your horizons. The weather wasnt particularly good on the afternoon we visited , its quite high above sea level and probably best visited in the morning before the cloud and drizzle move in. Extremely peaceful and tranquil place. Both of the idols are huge and not something you will ever see in the uk. Had a nice walk around the lake and in the temples, just remember its respectful to remove your shoes! Take some bananas or fruit to feed the monkeys near the idols of Lord Shiva and Maa Durga. There is no admission fee and you can walk around the whole area for free, there are no refreshment facilities that we could find so make sure you have some water with you and food if you need it. The only bad thing to say is that the toilets are disgusting, make sure you take some sanitising gel with you to wash your hands with!"
150,Spectacular Hindu Site,"I first visited Grand Bassin/Ganga Talao in 2000 a few days after getting married, and I've been back on almost every visit to Mauritius since then. It has developed quite a lot, with more statues and shrines, plus of course the two huge statues of Lord Shiva and Durga at the entrance to the holy area. Since my last visit in 2015, the management of the Grand Bassin has improved - the grass was cut, shrubs trimmed and everything kept admirably clean - apart from the toilets, my wife said, where there was no paper, no soap, no towels (you have been warned!). Do take the time, if you can, to walk up the small hill to the Hanuman temple; it's not a taxing climb as there are easy steps and handrails both sides. Potentially, it gives you a wonderful view over the lake and all the way out to the coast. I say 'potentially' because Grand Bassin is not renowned for bight, clear skies - it's often grey and misty, if not actually in the midst of a downpour. To my mind, that all adds to its rather special atmosphere. In Mauritius, your clothes dry off quickly, so why worry? Talking of clothes, the only jarring note were tourists wearing inappropriate clothes at this holy site. Whether or not you have any religious belief yourself, you should have the courtesy to respect those who do. It's not a beach, so please don't go there in shorts and crop-tops. It does, though, make sense to wear shoes that you can slip on and off easily, as you'll need to remove shoes if you enter any of the temples. I found it easier simply to walk barefoot because you can get a better grip. And the textured bricks used for the paths actually give quite a nice sensation when you walk on them.If you're wondering about the huge road leading up to this rather remote rural location, that's because Grand Bassin is the destination for thousands of pilgrims during Maha Shivratri (the next pilgrimage will be on 4 March 2019). It's all a big contrast from what it must have been like back in 1897 when the lake was 'discovered' as a holy site."
151,Gang Talao,We made a stop here on our way to the south of the island. Although the religious significance is lost on me I found it well-worth visiting. The statues really are impressive and there is an air of tranquility. We did not want intrude at the small temple as there were many worshipers and viewed it from a distance. We only spent 30 minutes there which was sufficient.
152,Great place with free monkeys.,"The place was maintained so well with adequate parking space and restrooms. We had gone as a group of 25 with varying ages. So serene, peaceful and super clean.."
153,Peaceful and so tranquil,"Visited as part of a tour of the south of the island. Unfortunately the heavens opened as we arrived, and so we did not spend much time here. Very busy, with many large statues. Probably would have given a higher rating if weather had been better."
154,Great place to see!,Such an important place to so many islanders. We felt very honoured to be able to share the experience. So calm and serene a real chance to reflect on life.truly amazing
155,The temple is worth the visit !,I loved the super sized God statues.  With the clouds moving in the background it felt like the statuses were moving.  The energy and vibration was high.  There are many traditions and folk stories about its origin.  We made offerings to the Gods and said prayers. The priest on site was welcoming.  Our guide even got us to make a wish and throw a coin into the basin.  The tranquil sounding are great for meditation and yoga. Watch out for the monkeys.  They were enjoying terrorising the visitors for their fruit and food offerings.
156,Feel like you are in India !!!,"Impressive setting. But not worth visiting, when it's foggy. We couldn't hardly see each other. It was crowded with locals having their ceremonies. Amazingly beautiful statues."
157,Serene place,"I'm not religious at all, but have a keen interest in learning about other cultures and religions.  So despite the nay-sayers who think this place is not worth visiting, it most certainly is, providing you have a guide who can explain the idols to you, who can give you a bit of background on the religion.It is what it is, a religious prayer facility with thousands making there way there to pray every day, so expect it to not be pristine and clean, do not expect sculptures worthy of Michaelangelo's David or the Venus de Milo.  Go with the right attitude and heart, and appreciate that this may not be your ""thing"" but go to learn, go to absorb how the Mauritians spend their time in prayer, go to drink in the sights and sounds of something not Western.Go with an open mind.We found it fascinating and enlightening, even though as said, I'm not religious at all."
158,super amazing place,"If you have the chance to go there, i would definately reccommend it. You don't have to book a tour to get there, there are soo many parking lots at the location and the drive there is very scenic (from Black River). Just consider that you are visiting a holy place for the hindus and make sure that you are dressed appropriately and also behave accordingly."
159,"Visit here, It's great and free.","We pulled over on a whim to see what this body of water that we were passing was, and I'm glad we did. A large body of water with little stands for people to give offerings of some kind. Walked past about 5 groups of people burning incense and feeding fish. Spotted four stray cats and a couple dogs along the way. Fish danced at the top of the water. The cats looked very well fed, and I watched as one watched a school of the fish by the shore very intensely. I speculate they eat the fish. Even though the day was gloomy it was an immersive and lovely experience."
