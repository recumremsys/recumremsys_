0,Zoo Day,"It's a wonderful place for family time. It is a big park with a lot of trees, ponds, and cafes. You can spend in Zoo 3 or 4 hours and didn't catch it. You can find here the rare liliger (tiger+lion) Kiara. Another famous zoo family is the polar bears Kai and Gerda with their cubs, every year they have one or two bears. You should see it to enjoy it."
1,Rather small but really worth to visit!,"I love this ZOO. It is really easy to spend whole day there. There are a lot of animals.The greatest collection of felines. Beautiful ligar (hybride of lion and tiger).the only one thing it is not a good idea to come there during the lunch time with children. There are not only animals but also a good amount of places to stay with children like kind of amuzement park, you can ride horses. Also one of the distinguishable places is place with huge statues of dinasours. All children like to spend time there.You will not regret of visiting this place!"
2,The Zoo,There are many different animals and attractions. The park with a Zoo is large. It is situated in a great place on a very large square.
3,Worth a visit,"The best place in the city,especially for walking in open air.A lot of animals and new dolphinarium. Great place !"
4,Amazing place,"Reviewing this place is pretty hard, the park itself is very nice, it is on the outskirts of town in woodlands and you can easily spend an entire day there as it is massive! however, the cages for the animals are a bit of a mixed bag - the new section is lovely with clean and well-designed pens for the animals while some of the older sections are pretty horrifying, particularly, the brown and black bears looked thoroughly miserable exhibiting pacing behaviour and sitting around in their own filth. However, it is probably your best chance of seeing an Amur/Siberian tiger in Siberia and they have one or two snow leopards, an extensive collection of birds of prey and a very engaging polar bear with a cub. Unlike European zoos it also has rides and a dino park with animatronics, and you can feed some of the animals (although some of the guests were feeding animals that were not on that list!)"
5,Lovely zoo. Cages could be bigger though,We liked forest. Air is clean! A good playground for children. Usual set of animals))) interesting for children. Great pond!
6,Must see in Novosibirsk,We really enjoyed the Novosibirsk Zoo.  It is large with many animals.  There were unusual animals and the
7,"MUST VISIT THIS ONE, if you have time for absolutely nothing else in Novosibirsk !","Beautiful place for walking with children. Big area. Lions, white bears, elephants and other animals and birds are there."
8,Beatiful place,This zoo is surprisingly well kept and is a great place to spend an afternoon (on a summer day) with your partner or kids. Whereas not a must-see this place clearly provides a great environment for relaxation after a potentially stressful city tour in Novosibirsk.PS: they have ligers (a cross bread between tigers and lions)
9,"Large venue, small cages...","Novosibirsk is boring, but the ZOO is a fine place to spend the afternoon - lot of animals, stands with sandwiches and drinks and all is very clean. I enjoyed the visit."
10,An exceptional zoo,Beautiful modern zoo with many exotic animals. The best zoo I've ever seen and definitely better than the one in New Delhi. White bears are the best thing to see here. And make sure to take a ride on the observing circle - you will get a memorable view of city.
11,Ok zoo ,"We visited Zoo park on a sunny weekend with friends. The entrance is amazingly beautiful . We clicked some good pictures . We saw Royal bengal tiger , Polar Bear , Kangaroos , variety of birds , monkeys , parrots,peacock ,Jaguar & Cheetah . But the real attraction was Chimpanze .Sitting on top of a branch with a scarf on his head . He was trying to get some relief from blazing sun . Everyone was very excited to see him.  The park is huge with joy rides , ice cream kiosks , restaurants , buggy ride for childrens. Neat and clean toilets are available on charge basis.I found many beautiful species of plants & flowers . There is Dolphinarium fir those who love to see their show. All in all it was a great day . I recommend to go and have fun if you have 5-6 hours to spare ."
12,Amazing zoo,"Arguably the best zoo in Russia. Huge, with large spaces for animals and the feel that You are actually out in nature reserve rather than in zoo... Must visit!"
13,Bears and white tigers,"Very big zoo located in the grove. It's collections of big cats, monkeys and birds are one of the best in Russia and Europe.The crew of zoo are the real fans of their work. And citizens are very pride of Zoo and call it the Best place in Novosibirsk."
14,Best thing in the city,A lot of animals here. Very interesting place. You can walk all day long and not enogh time to watch everything... everything very good.
15,Good to walk summer time,"The Novosibirsk zoo is a great place for families! The zoo features many species of animals. They even have a liger! The zoo is large and includes an indoor exibit. The zoo itself is very clean and animals are kept in great condition. I really enjoyed myself there.Outside of the zoo, one can buy some traditional souveniers - I bought a Russian doll for nearly nothing."
16,Excellent Zoo,"Currently the main attraction in town! Spacious, comfortable for both animals and visitors, lots of entertainment for kids. Located in a forest, with a big lake inside. An impressive and diverse array of animals/birds kept with great care both out- and in-doors. An item of pride for the locals!"
17,The best place in Novosibirsk,"Great place to come to relax and go for a stroll. There a lot to see, also there are many food stands and little cafes."
18,Best place in town,"The City Zoo is a great place to go and is very popular, it is situated reasonably close to the City centre and has many good amenities, The site is in the middle of the existing birch forest and there is a great variety of animals including a few rare ones like the Liger (mix of lion and tiger) and a white tiger and his family, probably the most popular attractions are the Polar bears who love to perform and play and the Orangutans who have developed a way of fishing for treats, but only when the keeper is not looking! The Zoo is open for most of the year even when there is a lot of snow on the ground in the winter period"
19,Best Zoo in Siberia!,Wide variety of animals and they are improving the enclosures so itâ€™s less depressing for the animals.
20,Weekend at its best,"I have been visiting the zoo for over ten years now, taking groups of children.  It is a great place and has improved tremendously over the years.  It now has new reception buildings and great facilities.  The animals are well looked after and in spacious facilities.   It has a very wide selection of animals and reptiles and you could easily stay there all day.  It is very friendly.Beware of some of the anilams putting their hands through the bars and grabbing your food, or even your telephone.  I have seen this happen more than once.  It is not an expensive attraction and very familiy friendly.The triplet cubs of ligress Zita -- half-lioness, half-tiger -- are exploring their open-air enclose are a great and unique ttraction!"
21,Mixed feelings,"If you have children or you with your partner this is a great Zoo. It has large territory, you feel more like in a park. The Zoo is home to lots of different animals and has beautiful lush foliage and flowers all around. The animals were all close enough to see them (much closer than in European and American zoos), and because it was sunny day they were very active. You can find polar bear, lion, tiger, snow leopard, liger (across bread between tigers and lions) and other animals of Siberia and north Russia. The information points were great in terms of educating of interesting facts and habitat. Even was very sunny beautiful day in October ( +16C) and it appeared to be very crowded going into the park, while in the park it didn't feel crowded. But if you have young children and are coming at the weekend, come before 12 pm  to avoid queuing and parking issues. I definitely would recommend it to families, both young and old alike who spend your time in Novosibirsk."
22,Amazing animals,"Nice zoo with a lot of animals that we (I am from Brazil) are not used to see in our country! For example, the beautiful   Ligre, wolves, and polar bear!! There was a big bonfire right in the entrance, to keep visitors warm. I would go again if I had the chance !"
23,Great place to visit ,"This zoo soooooo big, At least two hours walk! You can find polar bear l, Lion, tiger and animal in Siberia or north Russia ! Good for a family for visit !"
24,Nice zoo,"A lot of the animals were tired in the winter, but the zoo is clean and well laid out near the city center. The wolves are awesome as are the siberian tigers."
25,They have a liger!!,"it was really big, clean, with great variety of animals, didnt expect to find such a sightsee here in Siberia, visit Novosib only for the Zoo))))"
26,a nice afternoon,"It was a great place to spend during the sunny afternoon. The gounds are well looked after and you feel the community spirit when looking at animals upkeep. Great settings, you feel more like in a park."
27,Biggest Zoo I've Visited,It is amazing place! A Lot of animal in perfect condition. It is very impressing the birds like eagles. Other than animals there are a lot of other things for family that it can stay for all day inside.
28,Tourist,"Need 3 to 5 hours to walk all the places, very nice place to visit for a whole day! You may also visit Kids railroad nearby"
29,Worth a visit,"The best place to visit the zoo is sunny weekend in the summer. Area is very big so make sure to have plenty of time in order to see all of the animals. Number of species is great indeed. Some animals are allowed to be fed.On the territory there are several places where you can have a snack. Also there is a Children's Railroad that worth visiting too. I recommend to visit zoo for families with children, couples that want to spend some time together, or anyone who haven't visited this zoo yet."
30,Great nr of cats,It is the best and maybe the only place in town where you can invite guests to Novosibirsk. It will be interesting to both adults and children.
31,Fun place to visit for young families,many animals in good living conditions. pleasant walk along the alleys in the forest. The polar bears ( mother and cub) and the Amur tigers were very impressive. Very peaceful atmosphere there.
32,They have a Liger!!!,"Been there with 2 kids in July 2016. There are surely some zoos with larger space allocations for animals, and some of them looked a bit miserable - but maybe this was in the eye of the beholder? Anyway, the variety of animals in the zoo is impressive, and the kids also liked the dinosaur-themed exhibition (extra admission is required) and the various slides and rides (not cheap, but reasonable). The place would benefit from more maps at intersections, as it may be unclear where you are and where to go. Don't forget your bug spray if you go in the summer - mosquitoes and black flies will eat you alive if you don't."
33,Very nice zoo,"Open space, fresh air! Great place to visit with kids!"
34,Family visit to Zoo,I visited with a group of students from the University and we had a lot of fun walking through the zoo. It was interesting to see familiar animals to me that seemed exotic to my Russian friends and animals that I had little experience with seem common place to them. There was definitely a huge variety of species and well worth a visit. One critique I have is that the grounds are vast and it seems that some animals are repeated. Pretty sure I saw otters in two completely different parts of the zoo. It can be easy to get lost! Also many of the exhibits seemed a bit small for the animals they contained. Over all though I had a great experience and would recommend it to others traveling in the area. Just don't forget to bring rubles for the bathroom! :)
35,Best zoo I've ever visited,Definitely best in Russia. Must for visit in Novosibirsk. Zoo is very large. It will take whole day there if you want to see all animals. There are places to eat just prepared Shashlyk for nice price. But it should be visited in Summer because in winter many animals live in warm places and not available for visitors. Some cages may look too small but the size of the cage is determined by animal scientists. For example some animals that have to run a lot have very large territories.
36,A horror show,"If you like the idea of a Zoo then you'll enjoy this place. I know there are strong opinions out there, but this place does not disappoint. The curator of the Zoo Mr.Shilo put his heart and soul into this place and it truly shows. We came in June on a hot day and were greeted at the door by attentive personnel. To the right of the entrance door we spotted large animal colored wagons, which are free to take for up to three hours in exchange of your passport - I had three toddlers with me, so needless to say it was an amazing find. One more thing, if you are visiting in the summer months bring bug spray if you don't want to be eaten alive. We loved seeing all the animals, riding the train, jumping in what seemed like a 100s of bouncy houses and resting in endless number of cafes. Two favorite cafes to mention: best food is at the one located at the bottom of a small bridge right by deer cage. Best view is at the Lake cafe. You can sit down under the trees and people watch."
37,Great place for visiting in Novosibirsk ,"We went to this zoo in December and loved it!  The animals are very close to you (much closer than we are used to in American zoos), and because it was cold, they were very active.  We only had 2 hours, so we ran to see the polar bear, the tigers, and the lions.  I wish we had had much more time!  The zoo is very large, and I am not even sure what we missed.  It was also fun to see people pulling their little kids around on sleds.  Highly recommend this zoo!"
38,"Great zoo, plenty to see","this place is great! It's out of the way, yet easily accessible by public transport, the grounds are so vast, you wouldn't be surprised to find out that you've been there all day and haven't seen everything yet! Food stands and summer cafes are dotted all around the place, serving excellent shashlyks and pirozhkis for surprisingly low prices. Take the kids and have a great time in Novosibirsk zoo!"
39,Great local attraction,We spent at the zoo more than 6 hours and do not sure that we saw all the animals. The zoo is huge and in a very beautiful place. Animals in excellent condition. If you have a free day - this place is worth your visit!
40,Nice Polar bear ,"Foresee half a day to visit this nice zoo. Nice collection of wild cats (lion, tiger, snow leopard, etc)."
41,Wonderful even in Winter,"The best zoo in Russia I believeYou can show kids animals in comfortable conditions, large forest territory  Wide range unique animalsKids were happyI woke only add more virtual education programs thereAnd problem with parking, be prepared"
42,Very Cool Zoo,"If you came to Nsk in summer, this will be the point of visiting. Many animals and birds, rich amphibian collection and,of course Ligr! The hybrid of tiger and lion. Beautiful and calm place."
43,Cute white bears and lots of big cats,"Big zoo, lots of raptors (birds), cats, parrots and hoof animals. Highlights were the big cats, native Siberian mammals and the Liger (hybrid of lion father and tiger mother). Not so happy about the small cages for the brown bears."
44,Amazing experience!!,"Big Zoo with many animals, liger (lion+tiger), white tiger (something awsome)"
45,Great Zoo- Very Beautiful,They have an incredible habitat for primates.  The polar bears are awesome and so are the tiger/lions!!!  It is a wonderful zoo.
46,"Trains, reflecting Siberian culture","Truly worthwhile a visit. The zoo has large territory for a nice half-a-day walk. Many large ""cats"" live there. But the favorites are the family of white bears."
47,Surprisingly great visit,"Wide variety of animals, from several parts of the world. It's really well organised, tidy, absolutely beautiful and fun, everyone was having a good time, you could easily tell by the smile on their faces. I loved it!"
48,Good day,"Wow...amazing how people rave about how great this zoo is! Yes, some of the exhibits are pretty awesome and the grounds are simply gorgeous. HOWEVER, keeping a giant bear the size of an oversized truck is downright cruel!!!!!!!! The polar bears did not exactly look happy on lame poorly painted blue cement. They could do a MUCH better job by ripping out all the crap like the games, shooting galleries, other stupid distractions and built REAL sanctuaries instead of relegating these animals to cages! If this is the best zoo people have seen, I'd hate to see the ""other"" zoos they've been to!!!!! Good for a nice walk, but heart breaking if you love animals!!!"
49,Best attraction,"Zoo was amazing. Iâ€™m not the person who likes to go the zoo, but this time due to mu business trip i visited this place. I really in a shock how animals are comfortable there. Cells were very clean and not hungry"
50,Best Zoo in Russia,"The zoo is great to say the least, saw polar bears and brown bears... which I wanted to see so badly. Zoo has amazing animals, you wont be disappointed. But the only draw back is the cages, trying to get q good picture with out he cage in front is really hard. I eventually leant over a few barriers to take a few pics like this."
51,Hallmark of what a zoo should be,"I never imagined myself going to a zoo in the middle of Siberia but that was rather fun! It was a bit odd to be among a lot of russian children, but I saw a lot of animal which are rare in my home country."
52,wow,It was a nice outing to go to the zoo. The cages for the animals could honestly be bigger. A lot of the animals were pacing up and down the small cage. Seemed like they were agitated or disturbed. That needs to be reconsidered definitely.Was lovely to be able to see the Liger :-)
53,Great place to spend a day!,"This really is the best thing in the city. However, I found myself to be very sad in this zoo. Many of the enclosures are way too small for the animals. It really broke my heart."
54,Good place for weekend walking,"the zoo was very nice even in the cold of late autumn (Nov 1,2009)Enjoyed the zoo very muchhere are some photos belowbecarefull walking as it is very icing in the winterI guess in the sumeer and warm months this would be alot better"
55,Best zoo?? Really??,Great open space with comfortable cages and good views of the whole variety of exotic and local wildlife
56,One of the Best Zoos I have visited,"It was one of the first places my husband and I went to in Novosibirsk.We did enjoy our day there. Animals seemed happy there. Though I wish the brown bears could have biger cages. Polar bears are the real stars :-) Almost all the attention of tourists belongs to them. If you are hungry, you will find many cafes with traditional russian snack food and drinks. It's easy to get to from the city centre and you will find a lot of things you can do there: animal watching, eating in cafes, having a ride on an observation wheel (there is great view of the city),etc."
57,White bears my favorite ones...,"There are a lot of animals(snow tigers, ligers,polar bears, monkey, etc.) and cafes, artificial waterfall, sculptures of dinozaures, carussels.The best time to visit Zoo - is summer. If you will go walk through dendropark, you will stay at the bank of  the river Ob, where you can swim, play tennis, and your children can get on the little railway - my grand daughter admires it."
58,Very nice zoo witha lot of animals to see.,This is a must see when visiting Novosibirsk in the summer.  One of the most impressive zoos I've ever seen.  Be sure to allow ample time.  It really takes several hours to see and enjoy everything!
59,good for a walk,Really felt like i was out in the nature although i was in a big city. This zoo had nothing to be jealus of the London's one. White bears were the best)))
60,One of the best places in Nsk! Biggest Zoo in Russia,"Nice vist for an afternoon, you will probably see wild animals never seen before, only here. got a change to see 2 white Siberian bears, and tigres - for me the main thing. others animals are to be seen as in any  other zoo. ah make suer to check out the house upside down your children will simply love"
61,Incredible zoo!,"Huge territory, amazing decorations. Lots of species, some of them are extremely rare. Strongly recommended:)."
62,Couple of hours to spend between meetings,"This is a #1 attraction in Novosibirsk without any doubts! This is one of a very few real world class places in the city. It's well planned and located inside a well preserved natural forest (looks beautiful in any season!), has a lot of animals and they have plenty of space so they don't look jailed (well, it's not exactly true during famously cold Siberian winters when some of them are moving into heated space and it's not always that spacious, but they still are being treated fairly well. Also, this is why there are not that many large tropical animals there). It's affordable, clean, has things like statues of the dinosaurs, lots of trails, so you can have a nice work out walking around, everything is modern and well designed."
63,The best zoo I've ever seen,This zoo is truly exceptional. I went there myself because I wanted to see a liger. But I saw many other animals I had never seen before. You need a minimum of three hours to visit.
64,Good place to visit,"Once located in the very city center in a congested space last decade the zoo enjoy the plenty of space in the near suburb area. It is a wonderful place to relax summertime, especially with children"
65,Good place to visit in summer,"Being a local, I've been to the zoo many times and I enjoy it a lot. The zoo is very big and has a lot of animals, and should be admired first for its scientific and nature preserving roll and only then for its entertaining ability.Keep in mind that it's quite hard to see the entire zoo in one go, especially if you are going with kids: it's simply exhausting. I hope that this will be solved somehow in the future, perhaps with some sort of transportation within the park. However, even though I personally never went through the entire zoo in one visit, I always enjoyed watching animals in the half I got to see.Novosibirsk Zoo is not as interactive as some others zoo can get, which can result in one's experience to be described as 'dull', but then again, Novosibirsk Zoo is much more admired for the great variety and not for entertaining and interactive presentation of animals. So if you like watching animals as much as I do, you will have your fun. Animals are cute. Unless it's a hot day, most animals will be hiding then.When planning your route around the zoo, don't miss liger, the mix of tiger and lion exclusive to Novosibirsk Zoo, the snow leopard, the only cat that lives in the snow regions and also one of the least represented species in nature (less than 100, all of them in Russia's Dalny Vostok), and, of course, white bears: they are very playful and always super fun to watch (many visitors say that they feel like watching white bears is the only thing worth the ticket price in the entire zoo).To conclude, Novosibirsk Zoo certainly has its flaws, but it doesn't mean it's a bad place to visit. Well, it might, but not necesserary. In fact, I am certain you will have a lot of fun and enjoy your visit."
66,The best ever zoo I've seen,"Fantastic opportunity to see polar bears, including a new born cub who is amazingly cute. Lots of cats to see. Some cages were very small, for example the brown bears"
67,My favorite place in hometown,"Maybe it is fun to go with other people, but it is not a particularly interesting or fun place to go as a solo traveler."
68,"Not Bad, Good for an Hour or Two","Must visit. Have to be a little patient to see all the animals. I am against animals in zoos, but visited this one due to being highly recommended on various websites including TripAdvisor. I was not disappointed. Also, the zoo does work sincerely for conservation. Was lucky to catch a glimpse of the Liger as it came out only when lunch was delivered. I did see many animals which I never saw on Animal Planet or NatGeoWILD. Animals appeared healthy. Few of the cages were small, but most enclosures were large. African lions were not looking miserable in the cold (I visited in Mar2018, when even noon temperature was -1 or -2 Celsius) - of course, lions used to be found in southern Europe too (before they were exterminated there). These 2 facts imply that lions obviously tolerate cold temperatures. Moreover, the maned wolf (found in tropical South America ) looked quite comfortable in the cold. A very varied collection. Hence, must visit at least this in Novosibirsk, if you don't have time for anything else."
69,Really one of just few places that worth to visit (better at summer time),"If it can help   reproduction of endangered species in the wild,I'm OK with the zoo concept but here a lot of cages are really small and I felt sorry for the bored animals.Nevertherless,could be the only chance for you to spot emblematic Siberian species such as polar bear or snow leopard.Good shashliks(meat kebabs )served in an open air terrace  in the middle part of the zoo."
70,Wonderful Zoo,"the zoo is easy to find and a nice escape from the city if you have an hour or two. cages feel like cages and seem small, but there's a huge range of animals. there are buildings where they host the animals that can't take the cold, and i went into 2: one was great, with the tapirs, zebra and a ton of monkeys in nice enclosures. the other one was kind of miserable, stinking and cramped. there's also a small area next to the entrance with some reptiles.it was cool to see some arctic wildlife in siberia. worth it if you have a few hours to kill in novosibirsk, but not a must-see."
71,Good zoo (maybe best in Russian's Asian),"This zoo really warmed my heart when i was there. They don't have as many resaurses as Ekaterinburg's one, but when you there you can see how this people love their work! They have the very first ligr in the world. It is rather small, but very clean and nice! I would suggest people go there."
72,Zoo is symbol of our city.,"Probably the best thing to do in novosibirsk but compared to other zoos in the world, it's barely average.  The animal enclosures are a bit small.  Fairly clean and some low end amusement rides for the kids.   Good for an afternoon visit"
73,"Very interesting animals, but bad living conditions",Zoo opens at 9 AM local time. I liked polar bear and baboon most. Must apply mosquito repellant or else be ready to be bitten in summer time. Very well maintain. Also has lots of rides to enjoy and lots of restaurent if you are hungry. you are allowed to carry scooty. The total area is vast and it may take anything between 3-4 hours to complete the visit.
74,Novosibirsk Zoo Park,I was in Novosibirsk in September and our host family took me and a friend to visit the zoo. It is a large area but it seemed the cages were rather small for some of the animals. The polar bear was a highlight and they were swimming up a storm when we were there. Great place for young children!
75,"Plenty of animals, small cages","I am from NZ and have traveled extensively and visited many zoos, this one was on my list even though the day I arrived it was -35 (stupid me). Firstly the staff were very helpful at the ticket office although they spoke no english. There was no map and as I found out all the signs are in Russian with no pictures so I ended up wandering around lost in a blizzard. When I did find some animals by chance their condition and that of their enclosures was sad and disappointing. Warning: If you are from the West, this is not the type of Zoo we are used to - be prepared and go in summer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
76,Lions and Tigers and Bears Oh My!,All the animals looked well fed and clean but some looked as tho they would of had bigger pens . Plenty to see .
77,A day at the zoo,"I have been to the Novosibirsk zoo many times throughout my life.  This zoo has come very far, in terms of quality, from when it was first constructed.  The exhibits are numerous and the animals, from my perspective, seem to be quite content.  My personal favorite exhibit was the polar bear, who seemed to be basking in the attention from the crowd; it was performing corkscrews in the water and strutted gloriously before it's audience.  The food is quite good.  The food mainly consists of many shishkabab stands.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I would recommend this zoo for anyone's day out in Novosibirsk and especially if you have children or friends interested in animals and the wilderness.Also:  The children's train runs to the zoo, so if by any chance you have a desire to travel upon a traditional Russian railway system, take the opportunity to do so.Thank you! Enjoy the wonderful city of Novosibirsk; it is my favorite."
78,Awful and cruel.,"I can't say that I have been to many zoos but I was very impressed with this one. I don't think I was able to see all the animals and birds - there were just too many. Pretty views, lots of flowers. So many things for kids to do - like canoe ride. You can see the animals so close - its unreal. The most impressive thing about the animals that they act like actors on the stage: polar bears play with people volleyball like game with a canister. Bears and tigers parade themselves right in front of people, and a gorilla is trying to give something through the cage to the crowd that stands around. So many birds and others things. Just great. I love it. I wish I had a chance to go severals times to see everything."
79,nice zoo))),"There are many train wagoons exhibited, each of which tells a different story. The only problem was the timing of the visit, which was right after a 30-hour Trans-Siberian ride, and I was sick of inner atmosphere of trains!"
80,Old Fashioned Zoo,"The vast majority of the animals are kept in old fashioned metal cages, mostly that looked way too small for the animals needs. Having said that all the animals looked quite healthy and well enough fed.  There is a wide range of animals but somehow they never created any 'wow' factor."
81,Great,"I am not a fan of zoos, and didn't plan to go originally but this seemed one of the main attractions in Novosibirsk. I did not have time to see all the zoo, but a lot of it was well laid out with larger cages than sometimes. The polar bears are spectacular but it's still sad to see them confined and being tossed food by the crowd. Zoo seemed well maintained and tidy. I'm still not a fan of zoos but consider this a better zoo than most."
82,Probably the best place to visit in Novosibirsk,"Went on a trip back in 2014 and this year was the second year visiting with family. Nothing much has changed, the animals are still amazing. Just this year we came at a time when most of the lions, and monkeys were not in their cages. The polar bears were out - Mum and baby playing, but Dad looked a bit depressed. Other than that there's a vast variety of animals, although you'll need plenty of time to walk and explore the grounds. Food kiosks around, but I'd recommend you bring your one water, sandwiches and snacks and have your own picnic. Favourite attraction about the trip was seeing a money that was luring tourists to give him bananas with one of his toys."
83,Big Cats!,"While it was interesting to see the display of Siberian creatures all in one place, the zoo was old-fashioned by American standards and the space given to the animals was small. I felt bad for them. Bathrooms are hard to find and security is non-existent. We saw a group of drunk Russian men antagonizing a poor male lion. They even reached in to his enclosure to smack his paws. This would have been a crime in the US. Overall, it was a good experience, but best to go in Summer when things are easier and more accessible."
84,Looking a bit old and faded,"There are ""ligras"" - mix of lion and tiger and even ""liligras"" = lion+ligra. White beers swimming pool is really great - they make real attraction with empty plastic 10-litres bottles."
85,Not bad,The zoo is always a thing for me. Like / don't like... I'm very interested in animals and this is a great way to spot them. Novosibirsk zoo seems to be specialized in all sorts of cats. A great number including a Liger (crossing of Tigre and Lion).
86,Amazing place,"I was at the zoo in January 2016, when the temperature was -25c. The only animals out were some antelopes and a polar bear, but the zoo was quiet and lovely. I can only imagine how nice it is when the sun is out!"
87,Slow stroll,"Not that I've seen many zoos live, but I've read of and seen on TV many of them. So I can assure you that you should vist this one even if you were to NY or London zoos just for comparison. And if you haven't visited NY, London or Moscow zoos, then you jast have to visit this to be completely amazed and get a lot of positive emotions."
88,You'll enjoy it!,"You will see polar bears who stand-up and clap 'hands' for an ice-cream that visitors drop to them. You will see and if lucky hear lions. Monkeys are so funny that not only your children but most likely you as well will spend half an hour laughing at them. White tigers, leopards, Emas etc... Really nice place to go with children"
89,A world class zoo,I recently moved to Novosibirsk to teach English. My wife and I visited the zoo on our day off and we didn't have time to see it all. It's all surrounded by forests with walking paths making it beautiful in the fall weather. Huge variety of animals too. I can't wait to try walking through it during the winter.
90,An extensive zoo which has many exhibits to see!,"An extensive zoo with plenty to see, including countless species I'd never seen or even heard of, and cotton candy bigger than my head for 50 rubles. Unfortunately both the Siberian tiger and the liger were nowhere to be found (sleeping inside their enclosures, perhaps?) which was a disappointment as those were the only animals I'd really wanted to see. Despite the impressive array of species, I was very distracted by the fact that most animals weren't in enclosures-- they were in cages much too small to live comfortably in. Many of them were pacing back and forth tragically... so if you really care about animals this place will only depress you. :/"
91,The real pride of Novosibirsk,"Likes:Lots of big catsDislikes:People feeding the Polar Bears icecreams - not good.Still, not a bad zoo and certainly better than London Zoo!"
92,Great place!,"As a plus, I have to say that there are a lot of animals you won't find often (said from a Westerner's perspective) -- they also have a lot of Siberian animals, which is interesting. BUT the living conditions of the animals are terrible, for most of them cages are too small with no possibility to hide from the masses of people around them. Sorry to give such a bad vote, but I really got upset after a time and will surely not support them any more."
93,Novosibirsk Zoo - real gem!,"I wasn't expecting the settlers kept in such a good condition. A very good opportunity to visit liger, snow leopard and other original wild animals."
94,"although i prefer animals were left  in the wild, generaly a good  zoo",Being one or the only location in the world with new feline species. A lion mixed with a leopard for example.
95,Better than most zoos,strangley only  land  bears ( not  polar bears) were in  a small cage and  fed  from  a  pan ....so not  encouraged  to  forage
96,I was very impressed,"This is definitely one of the best zoos I have ever been to (and I have been to very many). The animals here are unique and very interesting. The rules for feeding animals are very poor with many people feeding them lollies and ice cream. A few children were feeding the bears, cookies, which was quite sad to see as it can very well damage their health. A monkey was given ice cream and bananas by visitors and others were given sugar lollies.. very disappointing. The Liger (gross between lion and tiger) is definitely something you must see."
97,Americanski in Russia,"Definitely not appropriate for young kids, unless you want them to witness a bloody mess... Most predators have live prey animals in their cages, which they ""hunt"", kill and devour, the place smells like blood and gore. It was too much and I was shocked!"
98,Beautiful in summer and in winter,"It's the first place which came to my mind when I'm asked, ""What is worthwhile to see in Novosibirsk?"" A lot of animals. Polar bears are really funny, ""ligr"", the cross-breed of lion and tiger, is unique. You'll enjoy the walk along spacious open-air cages, swan lake and so on. Many small small restaurants, food kiosks, shish-kebab stands. It will be ideal place, if there would be more bathrooms and water fountain. As it is in the forest, take a repellent along, though mosquitoes here is not so bad."
99,Great place for families!,"It seemed like the animals were in distress, shaking their heads back and forth pacing themselves up and down. Small cages? They should go to LA in the states and get a real understanding of what a zoo means. Throwing human food and rubbish into the polar bears enclosure making them do tricks is wrong. Its not a zoo its an awful circus."
