0,Poovar island ,Very good place. Very attractive and lovely. Family and friends like to visit this place in holidays.
1,Golden Sand beach - one of the most amazing views ever,Beach is good and water is clean and blue. But cannot swim in these waters. interesting to see the meeting of the waters here.
2,Serene and beautiful ‚ò∫Ô∏è,"One of the best beach in South India.clear and clean blue water ,golden sand, neat shore. Very exiting view of waves will take you in a different world"
3,Offbeat,"Nature is beautiful and one can enjoy it in this poovar island with backwaters leading to beach. The area is so good and we can go for boating either early morning or in the evening to completely get immersed in it. Backwaters leading to beach is so good.But Boating cost is way too high and makes it less deserving. If you have seen a mudhaliyarkuppam or a pichavaram boating in tamilnadu or even the aleppey boating is cheaper compared to boating in Poovar and there are several private operators who show fancy pamphlets for the sightseeing but they are all highly overrated. If you are okay to spend money on it, go for it.. else stay in poovar island to enjoy and relax near backwaters. There are many options for the stay and some are decently priced as well.Also, there are so much of plastic and littering everywhere around the backwaters which needs to be taken care and tourists should have some concern over littering as such. Its a habitat for so many birds and other living creatures and we shouldnt spoil the living in the name of tourism."
4,Best place for Meditation!,We took a boat. This island was included in boat tour. It has a very clean water. Very good view and very quite place. 
5,Beautiful place to visit,Enjoy beautiful place & its worth watching backwaters. I was amazed by its cleanliness. Golden coloured sand
6,Great Experience,"an Estuary where Arabian Sea, lake and river meets. Visited in evening and excellent location. The sea is very rough and not advisable to go near or swim at all."
7,Very nice property but needs maintenance,Beautiful Beach with less commercialization. There is backwaters just next to the beach. Life guards present at beach. Sea is generally rough here
8,A beautiful place - but spoiled by the boat operators,"This is a beautiful place. Tranquil backwaters, mangrove forests, a clean river entering the sea on a wonderful beach.But you see all of it only a tiring and annoying negotiation with boat operators who quote you double or triple the actual price. Of course, all reviews here warn you about that and even advise you to negotiate - but it just leaves bad taste in your mouth and unable to appreciate the beauty around you.This was the only negative experience I had in Kerala. Try as I might, I just couldn't enjoy the backwaters with a surly boatman and after knowing that I had been duped. Enjoy the place, if you can."
9,Awesome and highly recommended,"Poovar island is a beautiful place with a lovely view of the golden sand beach. There are a lot of resorts on the island. The boating aroung is very good, and there are boats which take you to the beach. The other side of the island has a view of the ghats. The boats take you around the mangroves."
10,Poovar island resort visit on Feb 10,It's is a beautiful place. The boating in back waters is the main attraction. From backwaters it leads to Golden Island beach. The sunset view from here is excellent.
11,Wonderful experience,Nice boat rides. Great beach with white sand and backwaters. you can see migratory birds and mangrove forest here.
12,Amazing Poovar Island resort,"This is very beautiful and scenic place. Boat riding here is better then Alleppey (personal opinion). They claim that small part of movie Anaconda was shot here, without commenting on authenticity of the claim the place was awesome. on the way to beach (while in boat) there are couple of resorts from where boatman on special request gets a chilled beer ÔÅä. Floating restaurant serves decent food as well. The beach here is literally a virgin beach. Very clean and beautiful."
13,Magical Tragedy,"A beautiful place if you stay in 5 star hotel ....boat trip lovely round the lagoon and great waves from the sea ...food excellent but extremely bad mannered so called wealthy Indians on holiday  treaded the staff as a lower form of being ,  Was not amused and many of them got very drunk,,,,staff were wonderful and very patient"
14,Very nice lagoon ,Me and my wife visited this place last week a great graceful place very good nature peaceful praying place quote for photographers
15,Poovar Island,This place was amazing. Very calm and scenic. Beautiful place. Visited with my daughter for my bday and it was a perfect setting. Although kids are not allowed in the floating cottages but the land cottages are good enough. The property is lovely. Access is only through a boat. The ride on the back waters is great and Serene. We went on a back water cruise through the Mangrove Forests and backwaters. It was good. Also went to the beautiful kovalam beach which is just about 17kms from the resort. The food was good. I suggest you go in for the alacarte instead of the buffet. Buffet could be improved. The chef cooked some amazing butter garlic prawns.... Yummmmmm. Thank you chef! But quite dint like the buffet. Also the cocktails need to improve.The staff at the resort are very polite and helpful. Forever smiling üòä Special mention of Akash at the chayakadaüòä and Preetha from house keeping. Visit poovar island resort for a calm peaceful stay and a different experience. Please be warned of the floating restaurants outside the resort. They cheat you. We visited the Sea food floating restaurant outside.... They show you one fish and charge very exorbitant but when they come and get it is some other fish which is just not worth the money. I recommend you eat inside the resort. The chef will be glad to cook up to your taste üòä or visit the shacks on kovalam beach... They have some amazing food.
16,must visit in kerela,"Good floating rooms, good service, must visit.Calm and quite place.  River view from floating cottage is amazing. Beach proximity by hotel boat."
17,Worth for money,"Unique experience. The Floating Cottages gives and experience of sitting by the river side, view of the Golden Beach and the Arabian Sea at a distance and watch the world going by. Watching the sunset, sipping coffee and the cool river breeze feels like heaven. The property is huge with lot of greenery and birds. Can spend time with nature and quite walks. Yoga, Activity centre, Ayurvedic Spa and  evening entertainment are available. The boat ride on the backwaters is exciting with the birds and natural passages. The Floating Cottage room is compact with all modern facilities; the food is good and room service is available. The staff is very kind, helpful and service prompt. The Security and Boatmen at the jetty are welcoming. The Buggy drivers are very helpful. Dinesh from and Arun are very helpful. If you want to experience a calm and peaceful holiday with an unique experience then this is the place to visit.  Will definitely go back again!!!"
18,Awesome Experience ü§©ü§©,this place can only be visited by boat .it is lo located at the back waters. Just a place to gaze in boat
19,Experience in resat,Can see the union of sea and backwaters across the beach. Amazing views. Located at junction of kerala and tamil nadu. Houseboats are available at poovar beach.

23,Holiday,"A great place to spend a day. The island is green clean and gives a good back to nature feelHowever do bargain at the boat ride place. They demand a lot from tourists, ask your driver or companion to deal with the boat vendors.A pleasant day spent."
24,Best place to see natural beauty in Trivandrum,"Poovar is one of the natural wonders where, the lake, river, sea and the beach meet the land. A rare find in Kerala, the southern state of India.

30,Good,Poovar is a place where you can enjoy the nature at maximum. Golden sand beach without much crowd and you can enjoy the back water boat rides.
31,Awsome resort,"Backwaters, view of Neyyar river merging with the sea, some quality time in the evening on a beach, a boat ride through mangroves.. These are some of the things you can experience at Poovar. An hours drive from Trivandrum (Tvm) & midway between Tvm & Kanyakumari. Poovar is a must visit when one is in South Kerala. Lots of stay options available, basic to premium."
32,A pleasure trip,"Boating from poovar Island to Golden sand beach,  Elephant rock,  Mother merry,  Etc also nice experience to travel through motor boat,  it is much costly approx 2500/- for two person and additional person 500/- for 1.5 hour,  if u want to visit by walk you can visit Golden sand beach may find different way from Google map approx 1.0km away from Boating site"
33,Beautiful place.,We went to Poovar Island Beach Resort. The boat ride with all the picturesque surroundings in backwaters of Kerala was mesmerizing. The view from the resort and the sea there was also very good.
34,Small haven to unwind,"Poovar boating is enjoyable and can be remembered for many years. Boats go through mangrove forest, backwaters, elephant rock and drops at golden sand beach.After spending few hours there, they pick up. No need to hurry. This beach don't have waves. So children can play for hours here in this beach.Try to book boating through online. It's cheaper in online than booking in person."

Various sight seeing places are there like mangroves forest, Mother Mary statue, elephant rock, coconut island, floating restaurant, floating cottages, etc. A must visit place near Trivandrum.‚Ä¶"
39,Not as per expected.,I visited last week in Poovar. Boating is amazing. I never seen in India this type cleen beach. Boating charge is 4500 for two hours. Kumar  was our boat pilot. He is very fredly and good photographer.

42,Stay at Poovar resort,"20 km distance from the bus / railway station, but a must see place. The boating in the river gives fantastic view of the island but it is expensive. Worth visiting."
43,Super,Poovar is known for back waters and golden sand beach. Back waters are a different kind but not better than Allepey.. there are steamers those take you to beach and show mangrooves . Be careful while booking streamers . They are greedy people. Backwaters in Alleppey are much‚Ä¶
44,Worst visiting,The boat takes you thru backwaters and is well organised. There is a church and some lovely birds enroute
45,Great place for activity and nature,"A must visit place for every nature loving enthusiast who visit Trivandrum. It's a place where the river, sea and estuary can be seen. Wonderful backwater boat ride through mangroves is breathtaking."
46,Amazing,This is new attraction in Kerala. Backwaters are competing the Alleppey. Added advantage is the beach. The confluence of river with he sea is worth visiting. The boat ride though is very expensive.
47,Great place to be with friends,"Very beautiful boat ride in the  Neyyar river backwaters leading to Arabian Sea. Boat pass through narrow passage of water with a view for birds, Mango and other trees.Stopped on the beach for 10 minutes and back to the starting point after one hour. Cost for two people for one hour is Rs.2500 and Rs.3500 for an hour and a half boat trip."

50,Poovar island,"Poovar, a natural wonder in Kerala, is a small island with a gorgeous beach, lush exotic greenery, coconut groves, banana plantations and emerald backwaters. Have to stay there for a couple of days to experience its amazing backwater and beaches. Also a land of amazing resorts to stay in"
51,Best place to spend time with family,"It hardly takes an hour to reach Poovar. It's wonderful beach, backwaters, Poovar River boat cruise and the sea! A church is its landmark.Fun is to be on the beach sandwiched between Poovar river on one side and Indian Ocean on the other. Isn't it enchanting?"
52,Mr Naveen,The best way is to take a boat ride through the back waters in the mangrove that open up to sea and golden beach.
53,The Place where the river meets the sea.,"Has visited with family.. Fantastic experience staying there. From pick up to drop by poovar island resort representative was complementary. Family loves this place, children likes swimming in pool.. Fantastic ambience of rooms and island resort. Morning walk different experience. Resort has children play area and other exercise tool / area. Recommend to visit with family."
54,Poovar boating 2 hours heaven near by,We visited this beautiful back water place during drive to Kanya kumari. Its really worth to visit by boat trip as through nice forest and ireland inside the lake. everyine must visit it but do bargaining with boat man.
55,Entha place !,This is one of the best place to spend time with family. Quite secluded island from the city. Way to this island through backwater is an awesome experience. Kids in our family had a great time over there.
56,Boating,We visited Poovar island in Nov 2019. It is a nice place which is approximately 20 km from Kovlam and 40 km from Trivandrum.  One can reach here in a taxi or public transport.  Poovar island is on the bank of neyyar river.  The sight of Neyyar river meeting the sea is wonderful. A must visit.
57,"Nice, but expensive boat ride",Awesome place. We friends visited on 11th Mar 2018 on occasion of friends birthday. Worth place to see. 
58,Beautiful but pricy ,Nice experience from the poovar backwaters. its real mangrove.normal mangroves trip time is 1.hr... that is inef for that trip. boat mans they are offering 2.hrs or 1.5 hrs its really waste. 1 hr is more than inef
59,What a place man !,"First and fresh experience is reaching in this Island resort by boat. Boat cruises through Nayar river for twenty minutes providing you view of scenic mangroves and  back waters.We checked in the floating cottages just standing on the confluence of RIver, Lake ,Land,  Back water and beach. You are just out of this world view from floating cottages is awe aspiring. Greenish and huge resort on the back of floating hotel adds to the beauty of this place.  I would say one would like to see it before one dies.  My words can be judged by visiting that awesome and scenic island. Resort has all sorts of rooms, grand swimming pool,  restaurant with great ambiance, Gym, Massage center , place for DJ night. It offers many a thing to do and unwind. Just relax and immerse your self in the luxury of Island. Go for one hour boat ride of mangroves.     Mighty Arabian sea  hankering to kiss you. Beach is neat and clean as very few people visit there. Staff is courteous and  attentive ready to help you out. Food being served is extensive and wide spread, lot of choices to  make from.Yummy and delicious food make you night out a memorable life time experience."

Room is neat.Green and pleasant atmosphere.Food at restaurant is tasty.20 minutes boat ride to resort entrance, 1 hour boat ride in lake surrounded by forest was exceptional. Staffs are friendly."
62,Review,Must visit place to watch the beauty of the neyyar river converging into the Arabian sea. Good place for BIRD watching.
63,Holiday vacation,Beautiful greenery throughout the journey in the boat. Disappointed that not much else to see. The golden beach is littered with plastics and broken sandals shoes etcand many vendors just trying to sell you something. Not value for money at ruppees 3500
64,A DAY TRIP WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS,"Very nice five star level its very super, environment full of Eco friendly, kids useful play games,dancing moment very nice experience, foods are very nice, neet and clean, room service are very satisfied,"

74,Poovar island resort,"This is one of the most beautiful places in Trivandrum. There is Mangrove forest and this beach and can see river(lake) meeting sea. Sunset time will be best if you are staying there. Beware of the localites as they tried to loot me. Need to bargain as much as possible. Before you order food in any of the restaurants please check prices, also for the boating bargain as much as possible."
75,Beautiful backwater boating,"Poovar Island at Trivandrum is good and safe place to visit with family.....Golden sand beach is awesome....Boating charges are little expensive....Before get into boat take sufficient amount of snacks and fruit cuts for children from outside, because the food is very expensive in the floating restaurants...In the same time having food in floating restaurants is indeed a fun...."

80,awesome place and a must visit place,Wonderful place to visit in Kerala. You need to go by small boat to take round of Poovar Island. It takes around 2 hrs to see around places and go to golden sand beach. You can stay in resort on Island as well. This places is where one part of Movie 'Anaconda' filmed. Nice experience to go around through small boat and kind of jungle. You can see many birds also. Worth Spending some time on floating resturants and golden sandy beach
81,Poovar Island...Awesome felings in backwaters,It‚Äôs a beautiful beach where you have to take a boat to go to the beach itself . A proper place for morning walk. This beach as such is not commercialised like the other beaches in the country. The place could be maintained a lil cleaner. Highly recommended if you are planning‚Ä¶

83,Poovar island,This is must see place in Trivendram. You can reach by boats there. And boats are easily available. You can enjoy sea food there. The area is surrounded by greenary.
84,Explore poovar by motor boat,"We had booked floating cottages for a different experience. It looks serene but only after sunset as during the day tranquil water front gets lot of boat traffic. Not sure of other rooms but floating cottages need some maintenance plus the disposal from the cottage should be away. The beach is not a bath-able beach due to steep sloppy coast. If you expect to enjoy beach, this is not a place for it. The restaurant serves real sumptuous food with large variety. The staff is very friendly and supportive."

95,Not exactly as island but OK to go for Golden sand beach !!,"One of the best canal rides I had in Kerala, showing bird sanctuary, estuary , floating restaurants and resorts. Prices for the ride are a bit high.Minimum Rs 3500 for 2 people."
96,Charming place - stunning beach and backwaters,"It's the place where river, lake and sea meet. The boating amidst the pristine greenery will be a breathtaking experience... There are a few resorts too which are lined up on the shore.. To reach the beach, one has to head straightaway from Poovar town or else cross the lake by‚Ä¶"
97,Don't miss this place,the beach is the not amongst the best but still the view of sunset is good but it needs some cleaniness
98,Awesome place to Visit,"For me, Poovar island visit was the most fascinating visit.I enjoyed awesome views of backwaters, sea, sunrise n sunsets from my window, residing in the floating cottages, fabulous natural scapes n much more..i will surely go again there."
99,Leisure place after a boat ride,Poovar is 30km from Trivandrum and is known for its beach and backwaters. We stayed at the Club Mahindra resort in Poovar - it was lovely. The boating tour takes 1.5 hours and costs Rs.2000. It is something to be not missed as the views were excellent. Be sure to get on the boat‚Ä¶
100,Poovar Island Trivendrum ,We had an easy and enjoyable visit to the temple eventhogugh it was a hot day. Beautiful architecture with clean surroundings and easy access . The security and temple staff.wete helpful and enabled a fruitful visit. Close to the main toad with ample parking .
101,Scenic is an understatement,This is located in Trivendrapuram..it has many resorts too..this village has beach which is the tourist attraction I would say..place is good ..if you visit in the morning you will love it more with peace..
102,Boat ride  at Poovar,Poovar island adventure is indeed a beautiful journey. Through the back waters and mangrove forest and then finally reaching the beach where river and sea collides
103,Excellent place to visit,We sets with our family poovar island it's a very awesome place and all enjoying here all staff are is good and iam so injoying
104,Best of Kerala views,There place is very scenic and beautiful but the only drawback is that the boat operators ask for a lot of money. There are numerous boat operators but your have to haggle for money as they charge an exorbidant amount of money. They were asking is to pay RS 3500 but eventually settled for 1100 rupees. The boat ride was for 1 hour. Next time if anyone goes please bargain with them and don't pay more than 1500rupees.its prettier than alleppey as they take you inside narrow areas and it's full of mangroves and pretty birds. We spent only 15 mom at The golden sand beach as it was very hot but the mangroves Forest area was very scenic and pretty..poovar is easily reachable through buses from East fort trivandrum or through taxis.
105,Poovar Backwaters are a must if you get a chance to be there !!,"When you are on this island you are away from the mad rush of the city life, very peaceful..backwater on oneside and sea shore on the other side...one can get to see lot of floating restaurants.. very good resorts too"
106,Amazing place,"Around 40kms from city but every part is worth of the ride u wud c curd sanctuary and place where anaconda movie was bin shot dere is floating island, mangroves coconut grove floating resort floating restaurant especially non vegetarian then Stephen's restaurant da best.. It also includes Triveni sangam were lake meets sea and sea meets ocean den there is elephant rock Cz it looks like one and mother Mary Nd Jesus statue Nd most of all golden beach but be careful not everywr u wud b allowed to touch water. WUS luv to visit again."
107,GOOD RESORT,It's an island resort for which one needs to access through a motor boat provided by the resort.  The garden is very nicely landscaped with lovely trees. The rooms very lovely and large.   We had a very comfortable stay and would certainly recommend this place.
108,Breathtakingly Beautiful!,"Poovar Island is in the southern tip of Kerala. We enjoyed the boating ride, you could see many birds, forest trees such as mango and pineapples. trip covers dense mangrove areas. Poovar Golden Beach, Elephant rock, Pieta Sculpture, Floating restaurant etc will be covered on your journey.We started our journey at 7:30 am and we were the first to take the journey, so the waters covered with withered flowers and fragrance were simply superb.We stayed in Kayaloram Resort and they them self offered boat rides at nominal price.Still I feel boat rides in Poovar area is much higher. The person was friendly and let us play in golden beach for 15-20 minutes. Would recommend Kayaloram boat club for others too.The only reason for reducing 1 start is the local people following you in bike to get people for boating. Its irritating to answer them. We were stopped in 2 to 3 junctions by these locals and were asked if we need boating. Seeing Boating price @ ~2000+ its better some corporate comes and take over. Prices needs to be controlled."
109,Exotic island in gods own country...,"Boat trip to poovar island starts with the early in the morning and it is just 20 km away from trivendrum.Morning or evening time ride recommended also you can do the bargain for the ride.And kindly take 2 hour ride there are packages with 1 and 1.5 hr ride as well.Sometimes you are not allowed to enter to step into island and which is where I rate this ride as overestimated and below expectations.So if they are really allowing you to go to poovar island golden beach then please do this ride , otherwise don't.Since if you will get very good rides in allapey and thekkedy."
110,Poovar Island Resort,"A great place to have boating on the backwater, a short drive from TRIVANDRUM, worth the drive a nice place to spend quality time."
111,Honeymoon Diaries,the island has maintained its pristine charm and beauty..its clean and sure spot to visit..estuary experience is mesmerising..
112,Nature and Nature ,"Greeny infrastructure and neat environment. Worth visiting.. Kids park, Activity Centre, swimming pool, Gym, yoga more and more.."
113,Poovar Backwaters ,"Beautiful experience what I had here. Boating service is there in the backwater and it is beautiful. You will get the package for 1 hour to 2 hours. You can see the golden sand beach where the meeting point of the river and Sea. Package is start from 2500, though it is little expensive but if you are a Nature lover then you can do the complete justification with the amount."
114,Nice property,You need to take boat ride and which is must do in poovar island. It is 3500- 4000 for pne boat 7 seatrr. You will go through the experience of entire back water.
115,Beautiful,Poovar island is a good place for boating ride. The rates of the service provider are very high need bargain to get best of that. Overall good experience
116,Must see a place,Good for family and kids.nice place to hangout from the busy life.nice staff and facilities are good.
117,Excellent boat ride,"The location of Poovar island isn't great...nor is the beach so clean.The boating around  the island near mangrove trees is a bit hyped. It's best for couples who are looking for some peaceful time with nature alone. I think it's almost 40 minutes sail.For a family with teenagers, it could be quite boring.Nothing much there...place can be avoided."
118,Peaceful retreat,"It's beautiful one time go island. You can go by either boat or by road also.But be aware of these boat travellers. They are really cheaters. I got cheated by Deepa boat travellers and the auto driver. It's harldly 30 mins up and down, but when they talk they tell you so much fairy tells with photo graphs. Again I tell you it's just a ordinary island beach.Don't give more than Rs2000 to 3000 for up and down. Even this amount is too much for the place.Don't go by photographs and videos."
119,Average Beauty with thugs all around,Nice place for the back water cruise with your friends or family. The scenic views are mind blowing and relaxing. The people there are down to earth. You can enjoy the best of traditional see foods at reasonable price.
120,Superb,"Best place to visit with family. Good pool, huge place to roam around, excellent place. The best and nothing else to say"
121,beautiful place,Serene and beautiful! We had a lovely two hour boat ride in the backwaters at Poovar. The time spent at the Golden beach was fun. We went on a day trip to Poovar island and kovalam from Trivandrum. The boat ride was the highlight of the day and we are likely to cherish it for a long time!‚Ä¶
122,Great place,"I really love island the beautiful touch and waterfall, boating ride and some cool nearest places all these makes me attract towards there lovely journey"
123,A different experience,Very nice island. I got tickets amount Rs 3000 for four adults and two kids. Please do bargain. Go and visit poovar island.

126,A bit hyped,"Back water visit was very nice and enjoyable, I had a very juicy coconut on my tour which was very refreshing."
127,Good day trip,"We booked a speed boat @ 3000 for one hour, the journey was nice in the lagoon, the boat stopped near a snack/cold drinks outlet but the juice was awful, orange juice has onion smell, and overpriced??? Then stopped near the sea beach, very nice and beautiful, but the ocean waves are dangerous, be careful."
128,Terrible experience,it is very good...... the view from poovar island resort to golden sand beach is outstanding... the pool maintenance is very clean and water is not too cold to step in
129,Visited with Family in Dec'2018,"Beautiful property, amazing views,Perfect management  and courtegeous staff .Awesome food and high quality cleanness .In short worth to stay here .Best vacations time spent here ."
130,breath taking beauty,"Once you reach poovar island you will find many local people on bike asking if you want to do boating, try to bargain with them . they have 3 different packages of 1hr, 1.5hr and 2hr. We took a package of 1.5hr for a boat and they charges us 2000 INR.¬† The best part of the boating is the golden sand beach try to go during morning hours as in the afternoon is gets too hot and the sun starts burning. The golden sand beach is really good , there are small stall of eatables there and also you can also stay at 1 of the resort on the poovar island."
131,Must visit place in Kerala,"Located some 20 to 25 kms south of Trivandrum , this island is very beautiful , you need to catch a boat to travel to its 15 odd points which includes mid water small church , deep forest of mangroves , floating restaurant , elephant like rock etc , memorable visit but word of caution , ferry boat charges are very high n on good bargaining  one can bring down the cost from 6k to 2k or even less , for 2 people,it takes about 90 minutes slow smooth sailing in motor boat which is quite pleasant and soothing , you may see some birds also enroute."
132,lara boating,I had a great time here. It was one of the best places to visit in Poovar. I am so happy I came here. One of the best decisions ever. Ambience is very good.
133,Highly overpriced and bad customer service of Karaikkattu Bavk water,"Great place, peaceful environment, excellent greenery, superb lake view room, breakfast buffet was so awesome. It's totally an amazing place and awesome resort"

138,beauitful back water experience,This is great place for enjoying nature and some activity. The boat ride through the backwaters is awesome and you get to see a lot of greenery and a variety of birds. The estuary where the sea meets the backwaters is beautiful and you can spend some great time at the Golden‚Ä¶

143,Nice backwaters,Poovar is a island which is one of the most beautiful places in kerala. The whole area is mush green and makes the place more cool and lovable. All kinds of sea foos are available here. Very calm and peaceful area which is best to relax and have peace. The water ways and canals‚Ä¶

145,Poovar Island - Best place to visit in Kerala.,The Poovar beach is at south most corner of Kerala near boarder of Tamilnadu. Excellent beach ever seen. Kerala is full of beaches. Back water boating is a exciting experience here.
146,Review,It was awesome experience to have a boat ride in backwaters of Poovar Island. Expensive but worth trying.
147,"Good place for relaxing, boating",Neat and clean beach Silent backwater Nice horseride It's an ausome place to visit once you are in trivandrum 
148,Poovar Island. Out of this world.,"IT was A Good Experience AT Poovar, It was HARDLY 28 KMS FROM OUR Keys Hotel TO Poovar , We got A Agent  NEAR POOVAR Who offered 4000 RS boat ride for 2.5 HRS COVERING MANGROOVE ISLAND AND A BEACH.

151,Ordinary beach island and boat people are cheaters,"Very good resort to visit, had a good buffet. Nice experience. Awesome location spot. Rooms are clean and good interior."
152,Excellent boat ride,We have visited the place with my family and found a place secure and enjoyful. But rates are varying should need sop
153,Good place to vist,"The place is good for people who like boating.  No speed boat options.  The boat ride takes minimum 1 hour to cover the places.  They take to the mangroves , floating restaurant,  golden beach.  Just besides the beach is the place where the back water meets the sea water.  The beach offers some junk foods.  There is horse riding activity.  This place is hiuse to many bird varities. Its very butiful and not to be given a miss by nature lovers."
154,nice but not clean,Totally worth spending a day here. Hire a shikara boat. They take you through the backwaters which even have narrow mangroves which adds to the charm. There are floating restaurants which serve acceptable food. You can place your order on the way to the golden sand beach and the food will be ready when you return to these floating restaurants. The golden sand beach is where the backwaters meet the sea and it is sooooo beautiful. The sand actually looks golden in sunlight and the sparkling sea water in its front will make you keep staring till your boat handler begs you to return.
155,Good place to be in peace,Very good ambiance. Good hospitality. It's really s heritage island.Very neat & clean rooms and bath rooms. Children enjoyed in swimming pool. Good restaurant offer veg and non veg meal. Over all it was a memorable experience.
156,First stop during Poovar backwater,This resort is ultimate and you feel that it‚Äôs gods own country starting from pickup it was ultimate stay staffs are very good and hospitality was good good swimming pool good rooms good Ayurveda centre good restaurant with good food and we had a nice boat ride coming here is value for money very clean n neat resort very rare you will find words are not enough to write for this resort
157,Boat ride theme,Poovar back water and Iceland is an average place to visit. We stayed at Trivandrum. We hired taxi from Trivandrum to Poovar. We reached at the Iceland by small boats from the nearby parking area. The boat charges were too costly (3500 per one hour). Boatman was polite and was‚Ä¶
158,Exciting,"i was staying in Kovalam and went for backwaters ride in poovar..whole family, especially the kids enjoyed the boat ride very much, though nothing much to see except the backwaters..passing through the narrow lanes and mangroves forest id the highlight.."
159,"Sit back, Relax and Enjoy your Beer",It was a wonderful experience we had in the resort. Environment was calm & quiet. Ambience was awesome. Must place to check in. 
160,Poovar back water cruise,"Poovar is the only golden beach of India. It's located at about 30 km from Trivandrum. It's got backwaters with mangrove forests as well as lot of wildlife in terms of birds including kingfisher. You must take a personal motor boat to enjoy the calm scenic beauty of the place. After the mangrove, you reach the beach where sun rays falling through water make the sand look golden. The water also is comparatively clean. To make it more memorable book into one of the hotels located on the shore...... Mahindra and Estuary are good choices"
161,Very good property,"Poovar island seems to be one of the more captivating places to visit in Trivandrum.  The 2 hour backwater cruise provides more than enough variety ! We didn't stay in any property, but had a great time during the cruise.  Below are the few interesting items part of the‚Ä¶"
162,Visit to Poovar,We stayed at Club Mahindra.  The place is good the staff are very courteous and helpful.  The food is very expensive here and the Taxi charges exorbitant i.e. Rs 40 per KM for trip including for the round the trip;.  The boat cruise is good but very expensive.
163,Nice Boating Experience,Nice surroundings. Nice adventure... Good service. Good activity area. Enjoying and rest. Feeling calm..
164,Waste of Time....,Out here the river boat tour going into the sea is a must do. I loved the birds sighting and the green nature backdrop. Beautiful place but you can't swim in the sea there.
165,NICE BOATING,A one-hour visit by boat will be a different experience. Those who are bird lovers will find the place a heaven with hundreds of birds. The golden sand beach was awesome. The floating resorts are nice too!
166,Boat Trip to Poovar Island‚Äôs Golden Sand Beach,"A remarkably innovative piece of architecture in a unique scenic space close to Trivandrum. Combines the beauty of a beach with the splendour of an estuary and backwaters. Built like a heritage property. The floating cottages, which rise during high tide and go down at low tide‚Ä¶"
167,A must visiting place,We have stayed two nights in povar island it‚Äôs amazing staff is well educated and humble I recommend everyone to stay here and have a wonderful experience.
168,Must Visit and enjoy Boat Ride,"As name tells its POOR! really poor with experience. The island was been closed for people to get on to due to cyclone warning they said, but seem to be true. The people who let us explore this are really kunning. They charge per person and that to with lots of LIE. (Insurance‚Ä¶"
169,Very nice place to visit,"The Golden sand beach is one of the most amazing views you will see. You can hear the sound of waves even before reaching the place. And as this comes in sight, you can see the amazing waves hitting the sands and going so high.  On the sand you feel like you are a on a very small island with water all around. One side you have the serene calm water and the other side sea is raging madly.  It's a must have experience.‚Ä¶"
170,Beautiful Beach with Backwater nearby,"The resort is extrondinary than what I expected. This is one of my best resort in Kerala. The check-in was smooth and people were very friendly. You don't have to think of going outside, since the resort has all the features like non payable events,boating, yoga, steam room, spa and so on. Me and my family enjoyed and we will  keep coming and will try floating room next time."
171,Excellent trip ,"The motor boat ride on Poovar back water was an ecstatic experience. The greenery and the beauty of the place was spell binding. Extended rows of Palm, Coconut, Banana tress dispelled treat for every eye.The flora and fauna of the place was beyond words describe. The fish in the‚Ä¶"
172,A land locked island,"Now there is nothing to see in back water. It‚Äôs a wasting of 3,000 rs for 8 members. After wasting 30 minutes of negotiation for boat riding, it‚Äôs completely waste of 1.5 hours. There is nothing to see on gold sand"
173,One day trip,"We had a boat trip on the backwaters of Poovar leading to the beach and island. It was a treat. The backwaters are peaceful and tranquil with an abundance of wildlife, the  beach area is lovely and the overall experience excellent."
174,Only one word for it : Splendid,"Serene atmosphere, backwaters, beah, what more you want for a 2 day stay. Awesome non veg cuisines. Excellent hospitality by the staff. Thanks a lot for having us."
175,Nyc stay..different experience..only food is little costly../,"poovar island is indeed a mini backwaters and a hidden treasure. Situated near trivandrum one has to reach this island by ferry only. lush green and mini backwaters is what i called. wonderful to visit for long weekend with extended family or friends. Very warm and helpful staff. one lady among staff also helped me wearing saree. The ayurvedic centre has great courses for people who wish to stay long and experience nirvana.Their massages are very good, concentrated on ayurvedic massages. For the people who enroll for treatment in Ayurvedic centre are given separate satvik and healthy food that includes fruits and unthinkable variety of juices and food preparation.Food for geberal people are buffet as well one can order al la carte too. They have wide variety of both veg and non veg preparation. Alcohol is not served in this resort. one can get of ur own and can consume in their own room. The island has many other resorts and resorts situated nearby backwaters and beaches where one can reach by ferry, its free from any resort u stay. People staying in poovar island generally plan to go to padmanabhan temple too."
176,Must visit in Kerala,"As Poovar is an estuary of Neyyar river, it has its natural beauty and splendour. Being there is like doing a meditation/prayer. So you can make a trip not as a tourist but as a pilgrim or a seeker. "
177,Trivandrum's go to place ! - backwater river cruise,"we took the boat and did the one hr back water tour, it was pristine, peaceful and beauitful. Really gives you a taste of kerala in a short time."
178,Amazing place to relax ,This is also one of the beautiful place to visit near Kovalam. You have to hire boat to reach this island. There is also white sand beach. Very beautiful small island with some resort to stay.
179,its a better version of allepy,It‚Äôs an awesome place to relax .. Property is just on the Island and full of greenery . Entire staffs are helpful to provide ur need on time .
180,Unique Experience,"Boating experience is very good while it is very costly. We took a motor boat for 3500 Rs for one and half hour. It showed us Mangroves, beach, canals, Birds, etc"
181,very good experiance,Take the backwater cruise on a small boat and explore the island from around it .. Visit the beaches or the lake restaurants for veg and non-veg food options..
182,Thrilling boat journey but nothing very special ,"There is a mini boat ride of about 2 hours which will take you through some of the very beautiful scenaries - mangroves forest, exotic birds, floating restaurant and cottages, golden sand beach and coconut island. Also there is a point where the backwaters meet the sea which they call the Sangam. Amazing trip and highly recommended if you visit Kerela."
183,Poovar Backwater,Good experience of boating through the poovar island It takes approx 2 hrs to complete the boat ride 
184,Beautiful estuary,A memorable stay for our group.A must visit place to enjoy a perfect stay.A delicious food and to rejuvenate your life .

186,An Estuary where you can enjoy the Seashore and Backwaters together,Arjuna Backwaters Boating. Pathetic place to begin with. You must avoid going to this place at all costs. Highly priced with boat operators conning visitors by partnering with drivers.  We went to Poovar on 31/12/2017. Our cab driver insisted us that we go to Arjuna Backwaters‚Ä¶
187,Like a dream come true.,Poovar island is a nice island located in the backwaters. We had hired a boat for the day and visited this place and found it ideal to spend the day there. Although we did not stay in the resort we had lunch there and found it very good.
188,Exotic and Elegant Island Resort,"We visited with our family of 18 people and stayed for a night at the resort. This is a ideal place for stay with excellent ambience and facilities. This place is unique as this is one of a very few places in world where ocean and backwaters coexist. To conclude, this can be termed as Indian ""Maldvies"" experience."
189,Golden Island ,It has a nice experience.Hospitality and ambience is very superb.I loved this place a lot...Thanks team poovar island for beautiful experience
190,Good place!,We stayed here for 1 day and think it is too less to enjoy the facilities. It is damn good one and one should definitely include this for karela trip.
191,Amazing location,Quite enchanting place! Wish the garbage was less and the providers use eco-friendly electric boats!
192,Poovar island resort ,"If you are in  or around Trivandrum, this place is a must visit. I went there with the bunch of my friends and belive me I had my best time there. Back water boating is just phenomenal and a Kingfisher Strong makes it even betterüòâ. Beaches are also pretty much clean and the views in here makes it a perfect spot to click pictures and gives you an amazing chance to impress someone! P.S. This place might be a little heavy on pocket! Cheers?!"
193,"Awesome experience, too much fun.","Reaching Poovar Island by Speed Boat is itself an exceptionally magnificent experience of life!  A narrow strip of land separating Arabian Sea and Neyyar River where you can stay an hour or so just watching the murmuring Arabian Sea, taking shots (still, video and selfies) standing on an unique golden beach or advancing green sea waves,, riding on a horse, enjoying ice-cream and lot of fun !  But, actual surprise starts only after that when I was taken to a floating restaurant, St.Arya Bhavan cradling on Neyyar Rto have a sumptuous lunch with beautiful dishes. On finishing the lunch, actual fun unfolds - a motor-boat cruise through lush green mangrove forests !Total package was for one and a half hour and it was really exciting !!  However, one can book a package for one hour also !!Before booking the package, one can ask Mr.Jestin or Mr.Vijay for a detailed briefing.  Both of them are very helpful and witty too, to make the travellers feel free in all respects.  In my opinion, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for each and every traveller."
194,Amazing place to visit,"Cruising around Poovar Island is worthwhile activity! We saw many wonderful types of birds in their natural habitats - egrets, kingfishers, hawks, snake-head birds, etc, etc. Our boatman was indeed a veteran at sighting these birds & pointing them out to us. He even try to get‚Ä¶"
195,Nice place,was fun visiting something so maintianed so spotlesslyEnjoyed a lot. Good experience. Foods are testy and good. Can spend a time with this place. Princes also confertable comparing to other resorts
196,Pay a visit to god on a hot day,"If you are an environment enthusiaist, then you must visit this place. Inspite of many establishments on banks of the these mangroves, they have maintained the mangroves and have not destroyed it. A boat ride takes you through these mangroves for you to enjoy and understand the beauty of the place. If you are lucky enough, you can walk on a shore, which has sea on one side and river on the other side called as the golden sand beach. Overall, its an optional sightseeing place in between Aleppey and Thiruvanthpuram."
197,No words,Good facilities and had very good time in resort. I would have given all 5 rating except room service which definitely need an improvement as 1 hr is too long period for serving tea. Alsoboth soup and tea served was not hot. Advise customers to ask and sign all bills they order‚Ä¶
198,Family Vacation,"1. Untouched virgin island and Mangroves.2. But the Boat ride of 1 hr is Rs. 2000 and for 2 Hrs. is Rs. 3000...3. Food is brilliant if you are a Fish Lover - Snappers, Lobster, King Prawns etc... The helpings are enough for 2-4 people.5. The Waves are very strong and you have to be careful not to cross the danger line set-up by the authorities.6. Great family weekend get-away.... Not too much crowd"
199,PLEASANT BOAT RIDE,We have booked our Poovar Sunset boating package with Kingfisher Boating Club through their website.  The ride was very enjoyable. We have booked two sunset boats for Rs. 4000 only which is an affordable rate.  They don't have any dress changing rooms actually but toilets are‚Ä¶
200,Beautiful - take time to visit ,Pozhikkara in poovar is where Neyyar river meets the Arabian sea. The place is scenic but the beach is dotted with garbage all over. Boatride that begins from pozhi will  circumvent the two islands  formed by the river. I had a short trip with boat driver on his way back to‚Ä¶
201,Took our guests to Poovar Island,"The trip was mind boggling. we visited Anaconda Forest,mangroves,birds watching place,neyyar river,golden sand beach,A beautiful Mother Mary Statue etc. The guide Hussain was brilliant he took us around and even cooked fish for us.never thought the fish can be so tasty to eat.he‚Ä¶"
202,Lovely island to visit once,"This island has got the best backwaters in Kerala I would say - after seeing Allepey as well. This has got the best views though the stream is narrow. Boating charges were quite high and as we visited in peak season (last week of December), could not bargain much. The place at which Neyyar river joins the sea is a visual treat to eyes. Green trees on both the sides of the narrow stream were too good."
203,a paradise for bird watcher,The resort is beautiful and full of greens. The environment is very admiring and we're having a wonderful experience.
204,Pristine and Virgin Beach & Mangroves,2500/hour for two passengers.poovar back water is more enjoyable as compared to alleppey .little bit amount will be reduced if you bargains.
205,Wonderful outing,"Poovar Island is very close to Kovalam (and Trivandrum). You get there on a boat trip. There are several companies, but when it comes to the price, they're more or less the same. We took a 3h boat cruise and we sailed the back waters of the rain forest. Several birds were spotted (mainly egrets and eagles). Once you're on the island and the beach, the waters are quite roughThis place located on Kovalam-Kanyakumari road around 30 kms from Trivandrum. There are several cruises in motor boats to reach the island but are generally expensive. The cruise however offers a scenic beauty of the Neyyar River, floating restaurants, floating houses, a church and a rock elephant island. The canals along the mangrove forests gives a unique perspectiveWon't get much into the place because it has everything expected out of a place like this.Would like to point out the sky high prices for the boat rides which in no way are justified..Anyway going there be careful and bargain /haggle..They will charge on hourly basis..So for a family of 4 they will charge per person for whatever time..Eg for 4 persons they will charge around 5.3 to 6.8 thousand rupees for 2 hours..The catch is to do some homework before and don't let your taxi driver decide the place for you (commission etc hike the rates)(AMMA boat rides,/ poovar boat rides etc are all in a row and charge atrociously to cover the commission for the driver)Same ride for 4 for 2 hours can cost you as little as 3100.Happy backwater riding just don't get ripped offThere place is very scenic and beautiful but the only drawback is that the boat operators ask for a lot of money. There are numerous boat operators but your have to haggle for money as they charge an exorbidant amount of money. They were asking is to pay RS 3500 but eventually settled for 1100 rupees. The boat ride was for 1 hour. Next time if anyone goes please bargain with them and don't pay more than 1500rupees.its prettier than alleppey as they take you inside narrow areas and it's full of mangroves and pretty birds. We spent only 15 mom at The golden sand beach as it was very hot but the mangroves Forest area was very scenic and pretty..poovar is easily reachable through buses from East fort trivandrum or through taxishe kids enjoyed the boat ride very much, though nothing much to see except the backwaters..passing through the narrow lanes and mangroves forest id the highlightBasically the boat trip in the back waters is the highlight. The experience beats Alleppy backwater trip hollow. This is much better.The boat guys ask you for ‚Çπ2000/- to ‚Çπ3500/-. I paid just ‚Çπ1000/- for a great trip. Don‚Äôt pay more than that. We were just 2 in the boat. Go for the early morning trip as you can see some birds at the sanctuary island als"

207,Mini backwaters meeting the sea,"On 11/10/19 I have visited this Island through a Motor Boat (Two boats hired for 9 members) per head Rs.700/- for 90 minutes drive.

209,Beautiful island,"worth trying once for sure... it was wonderful ride through mongoose island to golden beach, floating restaurants etc."
210,Welcome to poovar island,This is a good place to visit. Poovar island is 30km away from Trivandrum International Airport and 27 km from Trivandrum main bus terminal and Railway station. Guest can choose bus as well as taxi to reach this location. Most attraction is the boating through the Poovar lake.‚Ä¶
211,Poovar island resort,"Poovar is where the Neyyar river meets the sea and hence, boating is the main attraction here. There are around 33 boating centres and it is quite easy to bargain the prices during offseasons. The standard prices go up to Rs. 2500 for two for 1.5 hours of boating whereas at offseasons, the prices can go as low as around 250 for a person. There are a few floating restaurant options during the boat ride but the prices are quite high. The boating takes you through mangrove forests, coconut groves, a bird sanctuary and the estuary beach. The beach has water with a bluish tint and is far more beautiful than other popular beaches in Trivandrum."
212,Welcome To Poovar island Resort,Excellent landscape! Lovely boat ride! Exciting travel. All the resorts take you for a ride! Just enjoy
213,Magnificient boat-ride on the lake,You should bring your own water bottle and visit early morning or evening.also bring with some food.if possible dont swims in sea.
214,Splendid Boat Ride in the Backwaters,We visited the Poovar beach a few days ago. We hired a boat-ride through the Neyyar river prior to reaching the Island. The boat ride through the ravines with mangroves on both sides along the route was mesmerizing. The oarsman and the boat were from the Sai Boat Club. He was‚Ä¶
215,Visited with family and young children ,"We took the Karaikattu back water boat ride on our way to Kanyakumari . It is a unforgettable ride , along the tranquil backwater of Kerala.    This place is on the way to Kanyakumari , as you cross the Poovar bridge   take a right turn (slope down) before cross the Poovar‚Ä¶"
216,Poovar Island Boating ,"A must visit place. Charges are very high. One need to bargain. The boat people have two rates . For 1 hour and 1.5 hour. Don't get fooled , both are same. 30 extra minutes are actually wasted on the way as they slow the speed of boat. We did the ride for 2000 for 3 pax , for 1hour 30 minutes. Be careful."
217,Our 25th Anniversary,"Good stay and good food, nice place good view ...... I will come back soon with my family.... nice ambience  thank you..."
218,Serene place ! away from hustle and bustle city life,"Myself with my hubby got to visit Poovar Island on 14th Feb'19 and stayed at Poovar Island Resort. We have reached this lovely place via boat ride.   A beautiful Island to spend time, got to visit Poovar beach and had great time there. Must visit place"
219,Poovar island resort very nice place,"Me n my husband stayed at Poovar Island, Floating Cottage for 2 days n 2 nights.. Pros:  1. Wonderful stay.. 2.good services 3.courteous staffs different- Special thanks to Mr. BENNY (arranged for candle light dinner and cake as it was our 1st marriage anniversary)  4. Different‚Ä¶"
220,Poovar Island,We need to reach Poovar Island by boat. They have boating packages for 1hr and 1.5 hrs.They charge around 4K for 1 hour for 4people and 6k for 1.5hrs.We took 1 hr package . They just showed the elephant rock and Mother Mary statue. There are beautiful birds to see on the way. This is a place where river from TN and a river from kerala join with  arabian sea. This is not idle  place to play  in beach.There are few Restuarants on the backwaters and cottages where u can stay.cottage costs above 20k per night.There is also a Horse riding in this place. Those who wish to enjoy nature beauty with boat should visit this place for sure.
221,Poovar Island Resorts hotel,"lara boating charged 1700 for 2 people for mangroves only. ride was for beach and all the points for 2200, but beach was closed  for xmas. i think the ride was worth may be 1000 - i feel lara boating literally cheated."
222,Nice facility and must watch place,Breathtaking views. The boat ride is good but very expensive. I paid 4000/- for a simple 1 Hour ride. The backwaters are not clean. You can easily skip the island if you have already enjoyed the backwaters of Kerala.
223,Simply amazing,"So Yea I came to know about this place through one of my friend. This place was mesmerizing when I checked on the net. So then I booked rooms because I wanted to enjoy with my family. It was a unique experience to stay inside the resort from 11th till 13th of May 2018. The place was filled with only positive and green vibes because it was covered fully with lush greenery which was the best part about the property. It is a very well maintained property with good hospitality. To start with breakfast which had a very good spread that included omelet, pancakes, donuts and even idlis which was an amazing way to start the day with. To mention specially F&B manager Mr.Sajjan and Mr.Nambi's hospitality was splendid. Thanks and regards from Haripriya, Bangalore"
224,Nice place,"We took a boat ride through Neyyar river to the beach. It cost us Rs. 5000 for 8 people for 1.5 hours. Initially they tell you much higher rates, so bargain hard. The ride is through mangrove forests, ending at Poovar beach. You get to see varieties of birds on the way. The‚Ä¶"
225,One of the best experience,"Took an early morning boat ride where we could see birds like Kingfisher, myna,eagles chirping. Adjacent one can see concrete row houses, elephant rock, ancient church, in-built restaurant, Poovar island etc"
226,Awesome resort in poovar,Nothing exciting except for a few birds have seen better mangrove swamps in Malaysia and clear backwaters in :Langkawi Beach resort
227,Different herritage place,Beware of this overhyped place. They will charge you like anything to have a visit to golden sand beach from backwater. They will show you very crisp photograph which will not match even 25% reality and time allowed to spend on beach is 20 minutes only. Govt. should take some action to manage this place better.
228,Good,Basically the boat trip in the back waters is the highlight. The experience beats Alleppy backwater trip hollow. This is  much better. The boat guys ask you for ‚Çπ2000/- to ‚Çπ3500/-. I paid just ‚Çπ1000/- for a great trip. Don‚Äôt pay more than that. We were just 2 in the boat. Go for the early morning trip as you can see some birds at the sanctuary island also.
229,Backwater,"Worst experience in my 8 days trip in kerala. Boat ride is expensive (INR 2500/- per hour) , the beaches are full of garbage and horse poop, the backwater is very small. Total waste of money and time.Do not come to poovar. Stay in kovalam"
230,Flourishing mangroves!!,A place worth visiting and better to go with prior online booking. Utilised gaviya.com for booking back water cruise and was happy with the crew and condition of the boat.
231,Lake Surrounded By Forests ‚ù§Ô∏è,"the river flows into the sea ..and you can find ""pietha "" where the dead christ was taken from the cross and laid on the lap of mother mary after he was crucified..there you see the fisher mongers village too..on one side we see the lush greenery of coconut trees on the hills‚Ä¶"
232,Had a good time,We visited Poovar Backwaters and Island while on our way to Kanyakumari. The entire trip took around 2 hours and all the while we were ecstatic. Poovar island is reached after a short ride through dense mangroves and seeing such a serene beach with emerald blue water was immensely soothing. The entire trip I would say is a must while visiting that region.
233,A Different Backwater Experience,"This was totally unexpected ...the entire Poovar Island was full of surprises. The strip beach between the Arabian Sea and the backwaters was the highlight for me. Had Coconut water, Palm fruit juice and then cucumbers and fresh raw mangoes. Just standing in that narrow strip‚Ä¶"
234,Beautiful back water,"Went to Poovar Island for a backwater cruise and trust me, this is one of the best activity that I ahve done in my life.The cruise really gives breathtaking views of Kerala backwaters and especially the mangrove forest.Definately a worth a visit in a lifetime."
235,Good resort in a Fabulous location,"We took a boat from Leela Back Water Craze which is a member of the Poovar Backwater Welfare Society. They have fixed rates. They charge Rs 2500 for 1 hour per person and Rs 3500 for 1.5 hours for 2 persons. For additional persons it is additional Rs 500 per person. The boat was very nice, it was covered, it was clean and they gave us life boats. The boatman was very knowledgeable about the area and told us names of various plants, various birds and also how the river water is emptied in the ocean and how backwaters come from the sea.The boat ride was extremely good. I loved it through the mangroves. Also the Golden sand beach was really good. The view from the Golden sand beach is wonderful. The Arabian Sea can be seen and the blue colour is lovely though no one is allowed to swim there.There are floating restaurants where you can have fresh fish."
236,An estuary to visit,"Just before the unforeseen floods in Kerala, we had been to this ‚ÄòGod‚Äôs own country‚Äô and enjoyed some breath-taking moments along the Malabar coastline. We visited a number of beaches and temples, but one of our best destinations was Poovar Island‚Äôs Golden Sand Beach. Tourists mostly gather around Kovalam and Varkala beaches in Trivandrum but believe me, this one is a must go place. If you love blue sea, golden sands and lip-smacking seafood with tranquility as a complimentary offering, then you should not miss to visit Golden Sand Beach. Very few tourists visit this virgin beach but believe me, it is perhaps one of the most eternal coastal destinations of India, but hardly talked off!"
237,Worth a trip.,Staying in the estuary island or any resort and travelling to the island and taking a boat ride in  the back waters is a good way to explore the area if you are not going to alieppy
238,Beautiful and and amazing ride,"It was a great trip to poovar, as a trivian, i had never been to poovar mangrove forest, but it was wonderful experiance for me to travel there,"
239,Awesome place,Excellent destressing getaway and a pleasant boat-ride. Pl. choose the timing of the boat ride appropriately so that you can enjoy the ride and sometime on the beach
240,Clear water,Midst of the river and Arabian sea in the middle of thiruvantha puram and Kanyakumari....very good spacious scenic and good place to relax. reaching this place was exciting as its a 10 minute boat ride..
241,Trip,"I took the boat ride on 25th of December 2018 with my friends.First of all, the boat ride is highly overpriced in the first place. The same ride can be booked online at 50% discount.Secondly, the behaviour of manager is very rude and misbehaved with us.Thirdly, he took money for 1.5 hr ride at Rs. 3500 including discount of Rs. 500 at the time of boarding but finished the ride in 01 hr and when we asked to return the money, he started misbehaving and acted as if he never talked of 1.5 hr ride although he accepted the money in first place. The cost of 1 hr ride without any discount as per so called rate chart is Rs. 3000 for 3 pax.In all, the manager ruined all the experience and walked back from the negotiated terms. I would suggest not to avail service from this vendor and secondly not to come through with local drivers as they are all invlolved."
242,"Arjuna Boat Service and Back water, Nettoor Cochin",Awsm mentain of natural beauty the most important thing isawsm place with beautifull nature advantures swimming pool more many activities best service delicious food....Othe most important thing is that suparb vegeterian testy food in kerela thats means a lot bcz itsss to hard to get testy vegetrian food in this place thank u so much...üëçüòä
243,Nature at its best,"Terrible üò° the hotel was filthy. the staff disappeared when you ordered drinks we waited 1 hour 50 minutes.the room smelt of raw sewage, the mattresses cover was stained with human waste, the  sink and toilet was black, the food was not good,my husband caught gastroenteritis at the hotel, and was hospitalised for 5 days, we would NEVER come back to this hotel ever again or recommend it to anyone. I have photos to back up this but unsure as to put them online"
244,Poovar Backwaters,"I came to know about this place through my friends. The most attractive thing I felt was the boat trip to the resort. The only path to the resort is through boat, so we need to park on the parking area, little bit far away from the resort. First I felt little bit annoying but I must say the 15 mins boat trip to resort blows up ur mind. I booked the floating cottage for 2 days , that experience was different from any other resorts.. It‚Äôs a really great ambience , Hospitality and Food. I would like to thank to the Executive Chef Jeypaul , F&B staff for providing us  awesome food . The buffet is splendid . All Must try the buffet . Worth and value for the money. I Will come back next time to explore more here..Thanks Poovar for the memorable days.."
245,Very beautiful place to see - if you avoid the tourist traps,nice place to hang out.especialy with kids and family.lot of indoor and outdoor activities you can enjoy the river view as well take a boat to the sea
246,Memorable boat ride through Karaikattu back water,Went to the island while staying at a resort nearby. Had gone around the backwaters in a small 6 seater boat through the mangroves. Makes you feel that you are going through the Amazon forests. A nice strip of beach was there next to the backwaters. Can really spend a few hours‚Ä¶
247,Must visit,"this place is 15kms from kovalam, you have to hire a taxi to reach there. you will find many boats here, but very costly. i did boating for 2 hours cost rs1300. Best thing about this place is you will find varieities of birds here, lush green forest of mangroove trees.The driver will take to the mweeting point of back water with sea, that point is so beautiful. Sunset at the metting point is amazing, you will find many hotel and resort inside and near to the water."
248,The best place i visited in kerela,"The next time you visit Kovalam, do visit the Puvar island which is just about 20 kms away. The golden beach is absolutely picturesque and a treat for photographers. ‚Ä®‚Ä®The water is almost blue, aquamarine, and turquoise in colour depending on the sun‚Äôs position. Though not as popular as the Kovalam Beach, this place should definitely be on your list. It can get isolated and sometimes you may be on the receiving end of untoward behaviour but it‚Äôs definitely not dangerous. You will have a lot of fishermen for company and sometimes you get to see the real fisherman action too. A great spot to click some breathtaking images of the sea and the backwaters."
249,Where backwater and sea merges ,So Calm and tranquil.It seemed like I was in the amazon basin floating through the thick jungles.Enjoyed a lot.
250,Surprisingly Enchanting Island,This is a very good property and we all enjoyed a lot here more than us the kids were enjoying a lot . The good food and the restaurant service was excellent and the reception staff was  top-notch.  Very excellent  service we got it From The receotion
251,Good Place to visit,"Deciding it was too far to travel to Allepey or Kollam for a boat ride we stopped at Poovar.It was quiet and we had a boat to ourselves manned by the amazing guide Christopher who had abundance of information to impart.Murky looking waters masking gliding snakes,exotic birds and‚Ä¶"
252,Upto Estuary Island Resort car can take you,This is one of the best place I ever visited in Kerala. Near to Thiruvananthapuram. You can drive down easily. The place for nature lovers. You can spend 1 full day here...
253,Its a beautiful place to spot birds (its a natural bird sanctuary),Nice place to visit with family.. Nice rooms nice staff... Great experience ever... A must visit place
254,Getting There Is Itself An Absolutely Delighting Experience !!,i personally suggest you do not go specially for Poovar cause you will not find anything which is mesmerize you and in the picture it shows there is a Rock and Jesus Christ PBUH statue over there but there is a road as well will will lead to you a Tamil Nadu border somewhere so Please do not waste your time and go for Mangroves in the same backwater..
255,Excellent place with Back water boating,"this was a quick trip, agents followed us asking if we needed a boat trip.  Round trip in the backwaters cost us approx Rs 2500"
256,Poovar Island,"We decided to explore the back waters of Poovar with the Selfie boating group, a relatively new establishment. We were a group of 12 , so we hired 2 boats. Mr. Babu was very gracious in helping us spot birds. Pace was good along the long winding river and we had a wonderful time. Reasonably priced as well. He also took us to a floating restaurant that had an option of choosing a fish with however we want it cooked."
257,The trip to Poovar Island Beach resort through the boat going across the backwaters was mesmerising,"Worst experience.Broucher shows mangrove forests and all but dont go with those pictures, these pictures are fake.U will juz see Shrubs not forest.I will highly recommend dont go with such stupid things."
258,Boat ride,we stayed for one night here . we liked it very much and i would recommend to negotiate with boat operator while going for back water ride
259,Excellent place to chose for a day out,"Poovar can be accessed though a sped boat ride on Neyyar which is approx 2.K / one hour and 3.5 K / 1 and half hours. These rates are for 2 people and additional people on the boat are charged an Rs.500 / person. But it is indeed a must visit and total value for money. During the ride the boat passes through the wonderful creeks in the backwater. Fauna is just amazing and nature is at its pristine best with greenery all over. The boat reaches the sangam, an unique visual where the Perryar rives meets the Ocean, Simply one doesn't want to miss this sight. You can take a stroll on the Golden Sand Beach, extremely well maintained and a great beach, but swimming is not allowed. During the ride you have the option to catch a bite on the floating restaurants. Also the elephant rock, a beautiful sculpture of mother Mary and Floating House resorts can be viewed during the ride. If you are in the area don't miss it and don't miss your camera. Highly recommended."
260,Good for half day trip,we reached the island late evening around 5.30 and got the opportunity to see the sun set which was serene.  just too romantic as well as peaceful at the same time.
261,Exotic !,Really good foodGood service ( room service)They were able to provide us with what ever we asked themAfter all worth for the money
262,An outstanding back water place near Kovalam,"Poovar is a costal tourist village lies in the outskirts of  Trivandrum district of Kerala state. This village attracts tourists for its scenic beauty with backwater, and beach. It is very close to Vizhinjam, another tourist attraction. Number of luxury resorts at affordable‚Ä¶"
263,pool side candil light dinner,"The boat journey was enjoyable but the return Waterway should be much clean as it was chocked with Water Aquatic weeds.... One slice of golden sand island between poovar river and arabian sea was nice.... But cost of the journey was too high... We spent a beautiful afternoon and Thanks to Biju Anthony, our accompanying driver in Kerala tour, for taking us to this beautiful place."
264,Intresting place for Bird lovers,"Our stay here was awesome. As we arrived, we had a ferry ride to the resort. The resort is filled with activities and fun. The pool here ia amazing. Must visit."
265,nice place to visit,"The Boat costs around  4000 Per boat which can accommodate 8-10 People at a time. The boat takes you through the river, Marshes where you get chance to have a look at the birds of the marshes. Coconut Island, Floating Restaurant and white sand beach. Enjoy the orange coconut water along the beach and enjoy the giant waves of the sea. However you are not allowed to enter the water."
266,Too good,"We, the group of six adults, loved Poovar island - we loved doing back water boating as it was a fantastic 2 hrs tour through natural jungle"
267,Poovar Island,Poovar is around 30 KM ie 1 hour drive from Kovlam and is on the way to Kanyakumari from Kovlam. Nice natural place with a great boat ride experience. You will fell very close to nature while enjoying boating there. Also the golden sand beach which changes the beach line as per‚Ä¶
268,POOR ISLAND | Beware of localites there!,"Poovar Island we visited while moving from Trivandrum to Kanyakumari. It is 30 km from Trivandrum and if you want to explore the place, you have option of hiring a motorboat and entire thing can be done in 100 minutes including half an hour at Golden Sand Beach.  The nature can‚Ä¶"
269,Good Place,"There are boats that will take you for a ride, figuratively and literally. 1 hour is enough to cover all spots. If weather is good, you could stay longer. Beaches are not clean."
270,A ride which is a must,"We stopped over here randomly on our way to Kanyakumari from Trivandrum. We got to ride through the backwaters of Kerala, in the neyyar lake and see various birds, floating cottages and stopped at a beach for a few minutes. The ride was really peaceful and serene"
271,Kovalam trip,It's a must visit. The backwater ride here is far more better than Alleppey backwater rides. Water is clean and cool breeze. There is golden sand beach which is very beautiful. High tides and horse rides make this place amazing.
272,Good Boating experience .Its a place where 2 rivers fom TN and Kerala meet the arabian sea,"I have visited this place twice over a period of 3 months. During my first visit the prices were different which was 4k for a group of 5 and 500rs extra for addition person. Although we tried negotiating it did not workout, hence we went ahead by paying heavy. The place is‚Ä¶"
273,Best backwaters,"Poovar Island was visited as part of our trip around the Poovar backwaters. We didn't have time to enjoy the main backwaters in North Kerala so enjoyed a 2 hour boat ride at Poovar. There were two of us and a guide in a small boat. The guide knew where to find all the flora and fauna of interest and patiently waited whilst we took photos of kingfishers, eagles and egrets. The area was so tranquil and it was nice to get into the shade for a while. We eventually stopped at a large beach area close to Poovar Island where we had a choice of buying a cold drink or  fresh coconut. We travelled close to the monuments for photos with dozens of eagles enjoying the thermals above us. A lovely end to a memorable holiday. (Tip: book with a local and get a cheaper price!)"
274,Good ,Great place to stay. Just checked in-wonderful ambience. Very courteous staff. Had teething trouble with a/c but fixed it immediately and nicely upgraded our stay too...üòçüòçüòé
275,Arjuna Backwaters Boating Cruise in Poovar,"We booked a local boat to take us through the ""back waters"" of Poovar island - and it turned out to be a great decision (it cost about Rs.5500). There are numerous beautiful birds to be seen in their natural habitat during the boat ride."
276,Amazing flora & fauna! ,"We were travelling from Trivandrum to Kanyakumari when our driver suggested that we take this backwater cruise and we agreed. It was one of the most unique part of our Kerala trip though the cost (Rs 4000 for one boat) appeared a bit on the higher side for a 1 hour long cruise. But later on we came to know from online sources that there were cheaper options as well. The boating agency where we were taken was called something like Geethu Backwaters or so......if we ignore the high cost then I would say the trip was superb. We got a six-seater boat with a boatman all to the three of us. Technically the boatman is supposed to be your guide and explain you about the different spots....but ours did nothing. Still we were so  busy clicking pics that we did not need much explanation. The boat took us along the course of the Neyyar River till it met the sea. On our way we saw beautiful mangrove forests creating a thick canopy over the river. Slowly the mangroves gave way to the coconut trees which made us aware that we were nearing the confluence. The river met the sea forming an estuary and trust me the scene with the river, sea and the golden yellow sandy beach looked amazing. Near the mouth there was a beautiful statue of Mother Mary carrying Jesus. On one side  of river away from the beach there were beautiful cottages (of some resort) floating on the water which were really one of a kind and enhanced the visual effect of the place. Our boat stopped for some time on the beach and we got some time to explore the place. The view from the beach was breathtaking....I felt like I could spend hours there clicking pics. There were small stalls there selling coconut water and basic snacks. The option of horse-riding was also available. Also one thing....the beach had safety barricades near the sea which prevented people from going near the water. Even if somebody tried to cross the barricade and go near the water.....lifeguards were forcing them to come back due to safety reasons.....so forget your plan to take a dip there, if you had any. I would definitely say that it was the most unique part of our trip to Kerala for it was something which we were totally not expecting. If you are in Kovalam or Trivandrum then do visit this place without fail. Also I think accommodation is available there though I did not inquire about it."
277,Really good Sun set view,"I honestly did not know much about Poovar but on the suggestion of our excellent tour guide decided to check it out. And, oh my lord, do I highly recommend it. it should be like the 8th wonder of the world as it is such as a such an awesome boat ride through the lakes and lagoons of Poovar which are so peaceful and breathtaking. I highly recommend this trip to all my friends. Especially, Golden Sand Beach which is so much better than its congested and dirty Kovalam beach in the next town over. I would go again and again to for this trip. Highly recommended."
278,Island,"While going from Kanyakumari to Kovalam, we thought of visiting Poovar Island on the way. Poovar Island is just an stretch of land separating Poovar Lake and Arabian Sea same like Chilka lake in Orissa if someone have visited Chilka. One thing u must remember that the boat services ask for very exorbitant price, one need to have a very good negotiating skills (drill down to one fourth price on whatever they quote) to get a reasonable deal or the other way is to collect rates from different boat services which you""ll easily get from net, and then start bargaining. They are just bunch of looters. Plz fix the places with them where you have to go beforehand else they will not take you to all points. Ideally 1.5 hours is enough for a whole tour. You must see the sunset from Poovar Island. You""ll find some floating restaurants near Poovar Island. There is also a resort there if you wish to have a night stay. These resorts also have floating rooms to enjoy the lake from their floating verandah. Itz worth visiting. Will give you a little bit feel of Amazon Basin."
279,astonishing place,You have boating packages for 1hr and 1:30min with range from  2500 per couple Plus  500 r/s per child above 10Yrs and 4000 R/S for higher package. The speed boat will take you through thick Forest areas where you can see variety of Birds/Forest Mangoes/Pineapple etc. Although‚Ä¶
280,sheer experience,"Poovar is a small coastal, fisherman village located 35 Kms from Trivandrum and 20 Kms from Kovalam. Poovar is a beautiful island which is surrounded by river called Neyyar. Neyyar River ‚Äì It originates from Agastyarkoodam Hills near Trivandrum and after 56 Kms of flowing its long journey ends at Arabian Sea.It was an awesome backwaters boating experience... Travelled for more than 3-4 hrs in boat..we can find different boat services nearby this back waters..they will charge around 4000/- INR for all places..they had different packages at different prices..we can choose on our time and interest basis.."
281,Poovar Island and backwaters,"The Place is too good ... You will love to see everything around you... The trees, The Varieties of  Birds, The Forest .. everything is perfectly Perfect...You will in the boat which moves between forests... The feeling will be awesome..‚ù§Ô∏èThen you reach market in the lake.. where there will be different shops and Restaurants... But they are too costly.. the same thing you can get outside Poovar! Then you will go different points and in the end you will reach Golden beach.. on the way you will get to so many beautiful views and birds...But the most important thing is they will tell you the cost of boating is Rs.3500 for two person which is too much... But we Enjoy the Ride in Rs.3000 for six person for 2 hours...It's fun to go there but 3500/ for 2 isn't something worth giving for it!Though going through the forest in boat is One of the best experience I had in my life ‚ù§Ô∏è"
282,Good,We were taken here from the resort we were staying in. It was just a five minute boat ride. But then the beach is so dirty with people not having cleaned up after they have had a drink or meal. The currents are also very strong so you have to be very careful about venturing out.
283,Beautiful Backwater!,It was one of the best trips we went together with our guests. We spent about two hours at the place and enjoyed the backwaters too.
284,Greenery blends with the blue waters,We came here to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The Poovar Island team went out of their way to it special be it the room ( floating cottage or the cake and candle light dinner. Great food spectacular Ambience breathtaking view and a super star courteous and helpful staff only makes this Resort an out of the world experience. Thank you Poovar Island Resort team ....This trip is special and will always be etched in our heart
285,Amazing Island,"You must take a boat ride, we caught hold of a local person and it was very cheap, compared to reviews here on site. We paid Rs. 1000/- for 2 hours ride. It's beautiful to go through the backwaters and then reach the Poovar Beach, you must take caution at the beach as the waves‚Ä¶"
286,Must visit if you are in Thiruvananthapuram,"Won't get much into the place because it has everything expected out of a place like this.Would like to point out the sky high prices for the boat rides which in no way are justified..Anyway going there be careful and bargain /haggle..They will charge on hourly basis..So for a family of 4 they will charge per person for whatever time..Eg for 4 persons they will charge around 5.3 to 6.8 thousand rupees for 2 hours..The catch is to do some homework before and don't let your taxi driver decide the place for you (commission etc hike the rates)(AMMA boat rides,/ poovar boat rides etc are all in a row and charge atrociously to cover the commission for the driver)Same ride for 4 for 2 hours can cost you as little as 3100.Happy backwater riding just don't get ripped off.."
287,Excellent Hospitality,"It took us a bit of an effort to convince people that we really wanted to see the local beach from were you can see the fishermen, the backwater, mangroves and everyting (except th meeting point of the beach and the island, which they sell as an expensive tourist attraction,‚Ä¶"
288,most beautiful places in kerala,"Though I am from the capital city of God's own Country, this was my first visit to Poovar. The island per se was beautiful with rare species of birds. But the cleanliness was not up to the mark. The beach was dirty with plastic strewn all around. It would be great if resorts could pay some attention to the cleanliness of the beach."
289,Mind blowing,"Average resort, not much to write home about. A little too lonely for my liking. Nothings no much to do in and around the area. It‚Äôs now reachable by road as well as boat. One visit was enough! "
290,Heaven on the earth ,Try to plan a trip to Poovar if you are near Trivandrum. The boat ride here is simply superb and the glimpses are mesmerizing.
291,Backwaters,"Backwater ride Charges start from 3000 for Couple upto 4000 depending the length/route and the time of route coverage. There are a lot of beautiful spots in between like - Golden Sand Beach, Coconut Island, Tamil Nadu Border, Elephant Rock, Sangam of Arabian Sea and Neyyer River and more... It offers a motor boat ride for approximately 1.5 hours covering various Canals and more tourists points that what i have written above. Must doing activity!"
292,Lazy river,"This place located on Kovalam-Kanyakumari road around 30 kms from Trivandrum. There are several cruises in motor boats to reach the island but are generally expensive. The cruise however offers a scenic beauty of the Neyyar River, floating restaurants, floating houses, a church and a rock elephant island. The canals along the mangrove forests gives a unique perspective"
293,nice place to visit,"The monsoon had already set in. In fact, it had started raining on the day we reached Kerala. So, we got drenched when we visited Poovar Island. But, we enjoyed the trip including the drenching in the rains after the heat of Mumbai."
294,Poovar backwaters,"Are you travelling to Kerala and visiting thiruvananthapuram? Don't forget to visit Poovar island. Beautiful island located near by and can be reached via boat. Yes, you can easily get boat that will take you to the island and surrounding places."
295,Family island,"On our way down from Kovallam to Kanyakumari, our driver recommended that we pass through to take in the Poovar Island.  Really pleased that he did so as the place is a marvel to behold.   After parking up in the car park. We got on a small single man operated 4 person boat‚Ä¶"
296,Lovely,"You'll have to bargain with the operators if you want a reasonable price. We paid 750 rupees per person. Mangroves, birds and seeing how the people live was amazing. The rocks interesting. Shame on the locals and tourists for dumping rubbish in the mangroves and on, what could be, a beautiful beach. The operators and local business people should provide bins and clean up their act"
297,Poovar Island Club Mahindra,"honestly, Allepy felt like a waste of time after Poovar. Initially, I was skeptical but after visiting i felt we could have totally skipped Kumarkom and Allepy (provided you dont intend to stay in a house boat)"
298,Enjoyable and half a day timepass..,Those who visit Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) should make a trip to Poovar without fail and should enjoy the boat ride thro the lush green narrow back water and sip delicious sweet fresh coconut water on way and coffee/Tea or snacks in any of the floating restaurants.
299,Poovar Island,"Poovar is a tourist town in Neyyattinkara in the Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala state, South India. This village is almost at the southern tip of Thiruvananthapuram while the next village, Pozhiyoor, marks the end of Kerala. This village beach attracts tourists throughout the year. The beach is very magnificent that is has many 5 star hotels and Island hotels to attract more and more tourists."
