0,Impressive castle,"Himeji Castle is an impressive castle. It's huge, with lots of alleys, towers, small rivers and vegetation. It wasn't really touched by bombs during WWII. Even though, they reconstructed it and it is astonishing. However, from the inside it's quite empty. There are not many memories of what it used to be from the inside. Everything is quite new.It's one of the main reasons to visit Himeji and you won't be disapointed."
1,The most spectacular castle we got to witness!,"I have been to several castles in Japan and the Himeji Castle is really huge, beautiful well maintained and managed.The outer was beautifully white and details well kept. There was just enough (not too much) information to let you know the background and characteristics of the castle. Very impressive.Bonus: there were some cats in the park (part of the castle). So lucky to have seen them!"
2,The White Heron Castle - largely original and wholly impressive,"If you go to Himeji you have to visit the castle.  It’s a fairytale building and so photogenic.  We went in late November and got straight in but I’ve read that they restrict numbers on busy days - you should that out in advance to avoid disappointment.  There are steep steps inside the building (about seven staircases, more like ladders actually) but they are short and not a problem.I recommend visiting the castle."
3,Fantastic Architecture,"The castle is spectacular, one of the most see sights if you are near Himeji. The city is literally based around this castle and you can see that there is a lot of history in this place. There is a moat around the place when you first enter. The walls surround this place like... what you would expect for a castle. There is a nice little gift shop before you enter the castle. Once you enter the castle, you can see the interiors of the individual buildings such as the guard towers. The smell of tatami is strong in this place, especially near Senhime's room. The castle itself is windier than expected. Also, the amount of assassin hiding places. There is a story about the stones of Himeji, that they didn't have enough stones to build the fortress. So an old lady donated a stone to the castle. This prompted civilians from across the country to donate stones to build the castle. The wood of the castle comes from Taiwan. During world war 2, this was used as a garrison, but it was never touched during the bombings. Anyway, visit this place, this castle has so much history."
4,A whole new culture,"Himeji Castle is historic and one of the well-known castle in Japan.  A large castle with a long but scenic walk up to the castle.  At the top, there are great views of the surrounding area.  From Himeji train station follow the main boulevard north towards the castle.  Highly recommend to visit."
5,Wow.,"Such an impressive and imposing structure. Really interesting massive stone walls and moat surround the castle. The entry to the castle casts an intriguing tale, with twists, turns and tricks to keep out unwanted invaders. Spot the cross symbol on a roof near castle entry - highly unusual for this period... authentic mystery or contemporary prank? Be prepared to climb steep stairs over 5-7 floors within the castle itself, all in low light. 360 degree view of Himeji from the top makes the climb worthwhile."
6,"Himeji Castle, Japan.","This castle with its brilliant white exterior is very striking in appearance. It is the top attraction in Himeji and you can walk up to it from the station though we took the bus There are huge castle grounds from where you can get various views of the castle from different angles There were originally three moats but only the inner one has remained. There are six floors though one is a hidden floor ( from the outside) You enter the keep and take off your shoes and they give you a plastic bag to carry your shoes inThe stairs are quite steep and you have to mind your head as you climb the stairsAlthough the rooms are unfurnished there are many things to see including the huge long beams of wood needed to construct this building, nail covers, slits in the walls to attack the enemy , various trapdoors which were used to pour boiling water onto the enemy, places where weapons were stored and the view from the top shows the castle roofs and the fish shaped ornament ( fire protection symbol) on the roof. There’s also a model made of wood of the castle and you can appreciate the castle construction from this. The model was made so that they could understand the building in order to carry out renovations We found it very interesting"
7,A Must visit castle,"This is an amazing castle high up on a hill in the center of this small city. It is about five blocks north of Himeji Station. If it is raining, there is a parallel street going to the Castle one block east which is totally covered and wonderful for shopping.Definitely leave your stroller at the bottom because there are over 100 stairs to climb as you tour through the castle. You are required to remove your shoes, but they give you bags to hold them. I would definitely download the free Himeji Castle app which gives you an augmented reality experience of some parts of the castle."
8,Basic to Japan History,Travelled from Kyoto to Himeji to visit this beautiful castle. Certainly well worth it. Huge grounds with well maintained garden. Walked up all the way to top floor. Had a good view of surrounding area. Castle very well kept despite all the history. Note stairs inside castle can be steeped
9,Impressive castle,"It is said that Himeji castle is #1 castle and the most beautiful castle in Japan. I have visited some other castle in Japan, now I understand why it is said that. I recommend coming here if you like historical stuff and walking. Also, recommend visiting shrines nearby and that eating sea eel and Oden which are local food there. You will feel Japanese old days."
10,Typical Japanese castle,"We spent half a day wandering around Himeji castle and it’s surrounding grounds. Absolutely stunning. You can see the castle all the way from the JR station. It’s an easy 10 minute walk from the station. We visited in Autumn so the park surrounding the castle were in full colour, plus we even saw done late blooming cherry blossoms. You are able to go up inside the castle for a small fee. It’s worth climbing the 7 or so floors just for the view from the top. It was interesting to read about the history of the castle. The perfect day trip from Osaka!"
11,Astoundingly beautiful castle,"Claimed to be the most beautiful castle in Japan, it really is stunningly beautiful on a sunny day with a blue sky background. The inside visit was disappointing: there are very little artefacts and furniture inside, and the inevitable crowds make it all rather fraught as you shuffle round, up steep and slippery wooden stairs into the narrowing floors as you go to the top, then back down again for relief from the confined and crowded spaces. Don't miss the adjacent Kokoen gardens, which are a blaze of colours in the autumn."
12,Well worth the visit ,"I enjoyed my visit to Himeji Castle, there is a lot of history in it. To enter the castle, you need to take off the shoes. There is no elevator inside, and the stairs are pretty steep."
13,3 ways for a gaijin to apppreciate the castle,"You cannot have visited Japanese castles unless you have seen Himeji. An amazing building from the outside and so glad we went in it. The downside is there really is nothing to see inside apart from the fabulous architecture of how the castle was constructed. It is a shame that period furniture is not put in some rooms to give an idea of scale and time period. Hemji Castle  is also called the white heron castle as the exterior is suppose to resemble a white heron taking flight.Be aware that, as with most Japanese buildings, you remove your shoes and walk throughout in socks. The floors are uneven and wooden and therefore can be very slippery particularly when walking up/down the wooden staircases of which there are quite a few."
14,Excellent ,"When we came to Himeji, on the road to the castle we found next to station big naturally  looks restaurant with cascade levels for sitting. At the every level was tree, bourn. Few steps closer to castle we found Sega club, yes, its Japan´s game club, you can play just for 0,10Y, front of club they have many toys of Pokemons. When we came to castle, we saw many of Koi fishses in river under temple, walk through the park to castle was amazing, we didnt catch the time for visit it, we came little late for last visit, becouse we made stop in every corner, we only walk around, its really big area park, quietly and perfect for relax. I recommend this so much!"
15,We lost sense of time it was so awesome!,"This is one of the best and the most beautiful castle in Japan. If you visit this palace, you dont need to stop by another one."
16,Family trip with a 7 month old baby,"Hemeji Castle is the most beautiful castle of the many famous ones we visited during our two weeks in Japan.  If you just visit one castle, this should be the one.  You really don’t need to go inside, as that would be recommended for the young at heart.  The stairs are many and narrow, and the lines are long.  Even my 16 year old grandson didn’t think it was worth the money nor time.  The grounds are beautiful, and you can get some great photos by just walking along the outside of the moat."
17,Amazing English tour of Himeji castle,Absolute stunning castle but I recommend to see the western bailey outer part of the castle before the main castle.  Here it gives you historical details about the castle and the innovations they used to construct the castle.  The actual castle/main keep only has small and dark details about each each floor which to me was not enough as I wwould like more information for such an impressive structure.  We did the castle and then the bailey but I thoroughly recommend the other way around to appreciate the main castle/keep.You see the castle as you come out the main JR entrance and is about 1 km away so very close.  It will cost you 1000 yen and you must wear slippers and put shoes and umbrellas as it was wet when we visited in a plastic bag(s) they provide.  You are better off walking in your socks as the slippers  are not great climbing the steep steps between each floor.
18,Great castle tour.,"Himeji Castle is located in Hyōgo Prefecture. Not far from Kyoto and Osaka Is the most beautiful castle in Japan and has been ceded as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and next to the castle is a 33,000 square meter wide park.travel:When the train arrives at Sanyo Himeji station . Walk Continue for 15-20 minutes to the outer wall of Himeji Castle. Around the castle area there will be a moat around. From the road, we have to walk across the bridge to get inside the castle."
19,The most beautiful castle in Japan,"this castle with the surrounding sakura makes the whole place so lovely.. didn't have time to go in to the castle as i was catching a shinkansen to Osaka, but will definitely want to come back and explore the whole place.."
20,Amazing experience!,"Himeji Castle is majestic and picture perfect, a spectacular example of another time. The castle has undergone extensive restorations and is now full opened to the public unlike some that we also visited. The view from the top is commanding and well worth the hike up the 6th floors in the slippers provided. On days with predicted high volumes it pays to arrive mid morning as we found by lunchtime the access was metered to avoid over crowding. The west bailey was very interesting and informative. If you only do one castle make this the one."
21,Stunning,"Himeji Castle is probably Japan's most spectacular and well-preserved castle. The white, elegant exterior is quite impressive, however the inside of the castle is quite bare, with minimal exhibits. Visitors will have to take off their shoes to enter the castle, in order to preserve the wooden flooring. The castle offers great views of Himeji, down the Otemae-dori Street from the upper levels. It is easily accessible from JR Himeji or Sanyo Himeji by bus or on foot."
22,Most beautiful castle in Japan located in a charming city,"Our first view of this amazing castle was while walking down the main avenue from Himeji station. Built high on a hill it is an impressive sight. Unlike most European castles the main keep is finish in white plaster.If you visit the castle be prepared for a lot of steps if you want to go right to the top but in my opinion the climb is worth every step as it takes you through some great displays of life in castle in a by gone era.Well worth a visit, don't miss it!"
23,Perfect park for relaxing,"We visited Hemiji and stayed the night, specifically to see this castle. It is said to be the best, original castle in Japan and I have  yet to see anything to contradict the statement.The castle is easy to find from the train station, it dominates the skyline as soon as you leave Hemiji station. If you cant see it from the exit, turn around and look through the train station and you should see it from the other exit. To walk there should take about 20 minutes, although there is great shopping to one block to the right of the street that takes you there. This shopping district distrated us for a few hours and we arrived later than hoped.Two pro tips:1. When you buy your ticket (1000JPY, As at Nov 18), for 40JPY more you get entrance  to the gardens next door.2. On entereng the site , take an immediate right and 20m in front of you should be a small a4 sign saying free English tours. Theae tours leave as soon as the volenteer guide can get his bottle of water and write you nationality on a sheet, so should be private, unleas there are other English speaker in earshot when you arrive.Our goud qas Toshi and he was a wealth of knowledge. We undoubtedly would have seen the same things without a guide, but we would have missed out on so much of the intricacies in the disign of this castle as well as the history of the area.Thourougly enjoyed the day and loved the gardens. They even have rooms that offer a traditional tea ceremony. Castle, shopping, gardwns; a great way to spend a day in Himeji."
24,Speechless,Great little town that we really enjoyed! The castle and it’s construction is seriously impressive. White Heron CastleGreat views from up the top! Download a scanning app on to your phone so that you can get a link to some of the displays shown there. There are a few English guides around though we’d forgotten to organise one. We also paid the extra 40 yen to get access to the gardens which are just next door and lovely too see. Can have a meal there if you like but we went to a tea ceremony instead! Don’t miss it! Great sight!
25,Worth visit,"The outside view of the castle is sufficient, IMO. The interior is mostly bare and consist of very steep stairs (some more like ladders) that are not elderly friendly.Only consolation is a panoramic view of the city from the top level. It can get congested as the stairs are narrow and steep."
26,Beautiful white small castle ,Himeji castle is totally different from Osaka and Nagoya castle. Most parts of the building are from the original material since it builds. go earlier than 17.00 pm since it will close at 18 pm and you need and our to reach the rooftop.Very nice and Must visit!
27,A Must Visit for Castle Lovers!,"Himeji castle is one of Japan premier castles coloured in white which studded on the top of Himeyama hill. Become the largest on most visited castle, It registered as one of the first UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. Surrounding by cherry blossom is adding the beautiful scenery during spring. Next to the castle, we can also enjoying Japanese style garden as well as city zoo. Shopping mall and Handicraft shops are available near by."
28,pure Japan,"Himeji castle is an original castle so it is worth going out of your way to visit it. Most other castles in major places like Osaka or Hiroshima etc. are all reconstructions. Because Himeji castle is original all the surrounding buildings are gates are intact and the main tower of the castle is much larger than other castle and the interior is all original. The only downside is that because it is one of Japan's major tourist attractions there are huge numbers of visitors and the queue to get up and through the main tower of the castle can be very long, although you can go through parts of the castle on the way. Inside is very busy and it can take a long time to get through. At the top is very busy and it is hard to see out of the windows because there are always people in the way."
29,Worth the visit,"Himeji Castle also known as White Heron Castle  due to its elegant, white appearance, is widely considered as Japan's most spectacular castle for its imposing size and beauty and its well preserved, complex castle grounds. One of the beautiful UNESCO World Heritage Sites."
30,Stunningly Beautiful Castle,Probably  the most beautiful castles i have seen in Japan so far. When you enter inside you can feel the history. The old wooden structures and everything . There is a VR guide app that you can download . I didn't use it but it seems like a great idea . Definitely worth going
31,Interesting to see the difference between this and European fortifications,"Himeji Castle is the most beautiful castle in Japan that made me curious and visited for second time.  This time I spent almost 3 hours , really enjoying the majestic of Himeji castle.With an entrance ticket of ¥ 1040 including Kokoen Garden, since 9 am I have been at the location to avoid the long queues of visitors.Entering the castle area is required to take off the footwear.The building inside the castle is dominated by old and big woods, both floors, stairs, pillars and gates. There are 6th floors in the castle and through a narrow staircase to each floor to the top. Be careful while climbing the stairs to the top.From the top castle we can see Himeji city stunning view. Like the Kings and royal guards used to watched the surroundings from the top of Himeji Castle."
32,Amazing castle,It´s an amaizing castle made most of it out of wood! I loved it!It´s a Must when you visit Japan!!!
33,Impressive ,"The castle is truly impressive. Lots of stairs to climb to go up the main keep, but definetly worth it. Admission price is affordable. There are vending machines on the premises selling beverages so no need to worry on a hot day. Walk around the marked path to get great views of the castle."
34,"Glorious outside, disappointing inside. Don't miss the adjacent Kokoen gardens.","This might be the most beautiful castle we've seen so far in Japan. It's beautiful on the outside but we prefer the inside of Matsuyama castle since it wasn't empty and it had things to see and experience like in a museum (samurai sword and clothing, gun, etc.). Matsumoto castle was the one we liked less so far. The stairs are wider and less steep than in the other two mentioned castles so they're easier to climb. They give you a plastic bag to carry your shoes and walk on your socks. It took us an hour and a half and we arrived at 8:30 to have a good place in line when it opened at 9 (it would take longer if you go later with the crowds). The combined ticket (the ticket line is the one to the left when facing the castle) with Koko-en garden was great since we loved the garden maybe even more than the castle. They were the perfect combination."
35,"Outside impressive; inside, not so much","In Japan there are many castles to see, but for many people and also for me Himeji is the most beautiful one. This white castle is especially from the outside just gorgeous. Inside is the castle almost empty, but you still have a beautiful view over the castle and on top also over the city."
36,"Outside looks beautiful, but don't waste your time and energy inside",We went to a few different castles and palaces in Japan.  We are happy we went to Himeji as was different then some of the others.  This castle is very masculine and it is easy to imagine the samurais living in it. We just missed the cherry blossom season so on the one hand we could just imagine how beautiful it would look like with everything in pink.  On the other hand we did not have any lines and I could imagine when it is busy season it is very squished to go through the castle.  Definitely recommend to visit.
37,Himeji experience,"Beautiful from the outside, great views from the top but...theres nothing really in it HahaYou simply walk up to the top through tiny stair cases even removing your shoes at some poins, totally different to Osaka castle where there is so much to see inside."
38,"Incredible architecture, stunning views",We went to Himeji Castle during the Golden Week so there were lots of people (tourists came out in droves that day). We (im)patiently waited in line for 3 hours under the scorching sun just to get a glimpse of this awe-inspiring beauty. But it was worth it. The majestic structure was so well-preserved. You can even go inside and get to experience how people in the olden times must've felt living in the castle. The stairs going to the top level are quite steep though so be prepared for some physical exertion.
39,Don't need to go inside the castle,"This castle comprises some 83 buildings and is huge. It is quite a walk to get to the top of the castle but it is well worth it for the views of the surrounding area.It takes a good 2 hours to walk around and see it all so be careful as the place closes at 5 pm.This is a must see sight, not just for the castle but for the photo's you can get. Just beautiful."
40,Beautiful and understated ,"This castle is beautifully preserved. The access, by train, was very easy from Osaka. The whole place is quite large. It takes several hours to visit the castle, the long corridor and the nearby garden.It is really a must see attraction of Japan."
41,Himeji Castle,"The exterior of the castle is amazing, and the gardens seemed to be too (was raining when we went so didn't spend much time). When we got inside, the interior of the castle was bare, dark, and didn't have a heap going on. Would definitely recommend the grounds, as they're absolutely beautiful, but the interior of Nijo Castle in Tokyo was far more interesting in my opinion."
42,Imposing,"This wonderful and breathtaking castle is base for the development of the Japanese Empire since the 1600'sIts marvwelous interiors and surroundings give a good idea of what the empire took in terms of effort, organisation, persistence and order in their doing"
43,Gorgeous!,A great sight. Must-see in Japan. The castle area is quite big and the entry fee is really worth it and includes a walk through the castle.
44,Part of it under Reno,"The outside of the castle is pretty amazing, the inside less so.The crowds are enormous and it's really hard to enjoy the castle, feels like Disneyland.If you're traveling to Himeji specifically for the castle, you better enjoy extreme crowds.They should really limit the amount of people who go through daily."
45,Stunning!,"Yes, it is a must see if you are in Himeji and yes, the outdoor looks and the indoor structures are impressive. But why do you keep the rooms empty? It would be a 5-star attraction if there are replicase inside of how it looked like or some museum exhibition.."
46,The White-colored Castle,"The day we visited Himeji castle was a rainy day, but then from the station to close to the Castle there is a covered walkway, of course with shops and restaurants on either side of it. I did not find any pushy sales people in Japan. The Castle was awesome from the outside but on the inside , not so much. Maybe, we expected it to be like an European castle but it was not. One more thing, you need to take your shoes off and they give you slippers to walk on quite slippery and steep wooden steps. Once you start walking up there there is no way to turn back without going all the way to the top."
47,Magnificent Castle,Tons of history and ideal for studying a castle. The castle has been maintained well with lots of renovation. Be ready for a lot of walking inside the castle and in the grounds.
48,Beautifully maintained white heron castle,"As soon as you exit Himeji station you can see the castle. It’s striking and exactly what you’d hope for.The walk there puts the castle in perfect profile.  We got there at about 1015 and walked straight in, then through the Long Corridor, and into the castle. There are lots of stairs, some a bit steep but all with handrails on both sides.  It’s fantastic to see the quality of the woodwork in the castle.  Great photos and views over the courtyards and over the city"
49,STUNNING VIEW,"The view of the castle and the surroundings are beautiful indeed. However, inside it is absolutely empty. No furniture, no paintings and almost no explanations. It’s not worth the 1000 Yen."
50,Magnificent,This place was super cool.  The castle sits above the city like a giant.  It is just so beautiful when you are looking up at it.  The grounds are well maintained and have lovely gardens.  The inside was really interesting.  You can't wear shoes inside so make sure you are clean socks.  The castle is more of a fortress.  Everything in it was to keep invaders out.  So it is not filled with beautiful furniture or ornate items.  There is not really a lot in it. But reading the plagues when touring it explains the history of the castle.  It was not too far from Kyoto.  It was a wonderful trip.  Something you should see at least once.
51,Fascinating and impressive,"Was here a few years ago and already thought it was a beautiful castle to visit.  Went this time with the sakura in full bloom, it just blew my mind.   Good day trip to spend the day here if you are staying in near by big city."
52,Must-see in Japan - easy day trip from Osaka,"This is the top castle in Japan, the only castle to make it through history still intact accept for some renovations.  Never Burnt down like many have in history, made it through World Wars without being distroyed. Many other castles around the world have been rebuilt at some point in history. They have some free English speaking tours available. If your interested in hearing more details about how the castle came to be. Easy to get to. If you enjoy walking, there is no need to take a taxi or buss from the train station. As soon as you walk out of the station, you can see the castle in the distance and is. 20 minute leasurly walk."
53,White Castle,"It is a castle that can be easily seen once you stepped outisde the JR Himeji Station. It is walkable from there for about 10 minutes (depending on the pacing). But there are also buses running in the city starting from the station. Fee is flat for the first 2 stations (100 yen). The park inside is clean and has 2 attractions. Himeji zoo and the castle itself. Depending on the amount of visitors, long queues could form. You can start on the west gate towers then going to the main keep. The main keep is a 6 storey structure with steep stairs (not advisable for senior or with weak lower body strength), but this is understandable as the authorities wanted to preserved the structures and show its original form as much as possible. The flow tends to slow down once the top most floor is reached due to the amount of tourist and visitors wanted to take the city view of Himeji from the inside of the castle.After the main keep, you can go to the east tower of the castle.There are souveneirs at the base and vending machines. Reminders: - No drinking and eating inside- No toilet in the main keep of the castle- There are also tours done in english - You need to take of your footwear when entering the structures. A plastic bag will be provided for you to carry your footwears."
54,Beautiful Castle,This was our favourite castle to tour in Japan.  The town is lovely as well.  You can go inside the castle and climb right to the top.  You need to take off your shoes so be prepared to climb a lot of stairs in your stocking feet!  After touring the castle you can visit the gardens for just a few yen more.  It is lovely and we spent quite a bit of time in the gardens as well as touring all the buildings around the castle.
55,Interesting but not what I expected,"Himeji castle is a must see if you go to Japan! The building is very easy to find as it is straight ahead of the exit of Himeji station. And the prices are also very fair (1000¥ for 1 adult and 300¥ for children).The view is also amazing, but the building itself is truly the main attraction. The only thing me and my friend was missing was the lack of objects inside the main castle. It was a bit too empty on some places, but that is just something minor.I really recommend this place!"
56,Most beautiful castle in Japan,"We traveled a long way to visit Himeji castle. First impression was great. We saw it from afar, even from Himeji station. The castle looks stunning. Although Sakura was only 50% bloom, it's still breathtaking scene. We went there during Sakura blossoms season. There're definitely too many tourist from around the world. The wait time to go inside the main keep was around 1 hour. So, we recommended to go there early to take as much time as possible and enjoy!"
57,Spectacular military engineering,"This  Castle  , built in the 15thC,  is known as the “ white Heron” because of the soaring pagoda style roofing, which resembles the local bird ...It’s a massive structure, protected by a large moat, & 3 separate defensive stone walls .... one of them concave .... to make it more difficult for hostile armies to penetrate . The sight of the Castle, perched on a hill high above Himeji City , & surrounded, when we saw it in April ... with beautiful Sakura ... was one to behold . The castle itself is fascinating to walk through , & the location is easy to get to ... only 30 mins gratin ride form Osaka .... I certainly recommend seeing it ."
58,Splendid main keep ,Really enjoyed this castle it was well maintained and the views are stunning.  It was fantastic day trip from Kyoto.   The staircases are very steep so if you have problems climbing stairs probably best not to start the climb.
59,Stunning Exterior,Himeji castle is worth the day trip for sure. The place is stunning. It has all been renewed and so it feels like walking back in time. It is true is empty inside but that gives a chance to truly see the details. If you like architecture and history it is really great. The walking around the castle is also great with lich opportunity to see the roofing details along the way. Beware no strollers are allowed (you couldn't get them anywhere anyway) so you'll have to carry baby for the duration. Still worth it. The views drom the top are beautiful. The western buildings are also worth taking a look for a better idea of lovong quarters instead of a military building. It wasn't too crowded when I visited so I was really able to steep in the days of yore atmosphere. Not to be missed!
60,Spectacular,"Absolutely exquisite pagoda style castle, also know as the White Heron.  Long climb up the stairs to the top of the castle and obviously down again.  But well worth the effort.Shoes have to be removed at the entrance so make sure you have a pair of socks with you to pop on as the stone stairs are rather cold on bare feet.If going to the castle from Osaka make sure you board a special rapid rather than the rapid otherwise after Kobe the train stops at every stop"
61,"Himeji Castle, Kobe Beef & Herb Garden","Thankfully this is one of the handful of Japanese castles that survive in their original form and it is a beautiful building in a beautiful setting.  Its six steep flights of stairs from the basement to the top and although there is no furniture, there are interesting spaces and lovely views on the way.  We broke a train journey to visit and very glad we did."
62,Beautiful castle (with lovely wild cats),"This impressive Castle is used as one of the pictures to promote tourism to Japan, and with due justification!  It is visible in the far distance when leaving the Main Station, after arriving amidst an industrial landscape.  Suddenly there are wide boulevards reminiscent of Paris or L'viv, and one can easly walk the 1 km to the entrance to the Castle Park.  The nearer one gets, the more impressive the view of the castle becomes.  When the cherry blossom is out in April, it is one of most magnificent sights imaginable. There are masses of shops off the main walk up to and back from the Castle, which are well worth investigating!  If you have time, you can walk most of the way to the Castle under cover, taking in all the retail outlets on the way!Do not miss this opportunity !"
63,"White castle, a must visit place in Japan","Didn't originally plan to your the Castle, but so glad we did. Such an impressive fortification sitting high above Himeji. It's steep climb to the top up to the 6th level but there are lots of interesting facts on the how and why It was built. Then head over to the West Bailey, a 300m long attachment housing apartments and a fascinating film of the restoration work that has been carried out."
64,Stunning and fascinating... The oldest castle in Japan,I've visited most castles in Japan and this is one of my favorite. I was lucky to go when there were no tour groups going through so it was very quiet and comfortable. Highly recommended.
65,Absolutely a must do if anywhere near,It was a beautiful castle especially visiting in the spring time.Really busy place and long queue to get in but not much inside the castle but lovely view from the top.
66,Spectacular,The castle is really beautiful and is a must see in this part of Japan. Get there early during busy tourist periods as only 15000 are allowed in each day. The castle originated in the 1300's and has been modified many times since. The last major renovation was finished in 2015 and it is now in wonderful condition. The buildings are extensive. If I had a complaint it would be that there are very few artifacts inside any of the buildings. There are numerous information boards however.
67,Himeji Castle amaizing,"We visited about 3 years ago, it is an amazing cultural tour. It's a lot of walking and steps, I'd recommend for +12 yrs old. Quite an unexpected experience."
68,A must see in Himeji,"The Castle grounds were lovely in spring, so many great photo spots! The castle itself is beautiful too, and I loved the details and architecture. But inside looked pretty lonely and empty, devoid of any furniture to make it look like how it would have been in the past. This was a pity.Having said that, here's a tip, if you have young kids, go super early, preferably before 10am. Crowds build up later and there will be queues. We went early on a Sunday and though there was already a queue, it was acceptable for us. Wear socks as you would be required to remove your shoes and place them in plastic bags given. There are also many stairs in the castle to climb to go to the upper levels and the stairs are pretty steep. Would have to be careful.After visiting the castle, there was a flea market and a fair just across the street. Not sure if it is a regular feature, but it was lovely."
69,An overwhelming and beautiful castle rich on history,"Himeji Castle is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and rightly so.  The castle is a wonder, and very much worth the visit.  Japan Rail makes it easy, with simple connections and (of course) utterly reliable service.  The day we arrived, the castle was not crowded, even though it was a Sunday and we saw ropes and signs related to crowd management.  When it is crowded, a visit might be less pleasant.  We had hoped to visit the garden, too, and got tickets that included the garden, but unfortunately it started raining while we were inside, so we skipped the garden.  Nonetheless, we found the castle visit very much worth it.  The ‘augmented reality’ things seemed mostly gimmicky, and it is true that there is not much explanation about the various rooms and floors, but you really don’t need much explanation to appreciate the wonder that is Himeji Castle."
70,Enjoyed every second of it and would definitely want to visit again,"The first view of the snowy white castle is when you leave the rail station. The wide boulevard, a straight line from the station to the castle itself, is lined by Ginko trees and fine sculptures - some quite amusing. Don't miss the cast iron enamelled manhole covers with pictures of the town's emblem - white herons. Towards the end of the boulevard the outer fortified city wall comes into sight, then a couple of hundred metres further on, the magnificent castle gardens. Although we were too stingy to pay the 1,000 yen entrance fee we were more than satisfied with our visit. In the park we got talking to a couple of ladies in beautiful traditional kimonos - only to learn that the reason behind our conversation was to persuade us to become Jehova's Witnesses! Parallel to the main boulevard is a kilometre-long shopping arcade with coffee shops and restaurants"
71,Stunning,"Must visit castle, beautiful castle and city. Its only 1 hour by shinkansen from osaka. We went there day trip and definetly will be back again"
72,Majestic Himeji,"We were travelling from Osaka to Okayama and stopped at Himeji. The castle is worth a visit. It has a very rich history and was not so much damaged during WOII. The tour is well set-up, but visit early in the morning. When it gets busier, they will regulate the amount of people. This will take much longer, and is not pleasant."
73,Magnificent Castle,"We have visited quite a few castles in Japan and our verdict is Himeji Castle is the best among all. The walk into the castle itself is scenic with many Cherry trees lining along the road. Given the castle was recently renovated and reopen in 2015, everything was cleaned and well maintain."
74,A highlight of my trip,"It is not ranked as one of the top castles in the country for no reason! It's both beautiful and powerful. ""Worth the journey,"" as the guidebook says."
75,Well worth the visit,I can see why so many tourists visit this place. The castle is very stunning from inside and outside. However be prepared to walk up several flights of stairs if you decide to go inside the castle. The castle is a very short bus ride from the train station.
76,"Beautiful ""White Egeret"" Castle","We could see the castle as we walked up from the station as it's quite tall and has you reaching for the camera right away as it is an impressive sight. Once you reach the ticket office you have the option of buying a ticket for the castle, or a combined one with the gardens. As it was a cold day we decided to just do the castle, which was 1000 yen each. There are quite a few steps to get to the base of the keep. Then there are 6 flights of steps to get up to the top. There is not a great deal to see inside on the way up, but the views from the top are very good."
77,A ‘Must See’ when in Japan,"Not sure why this famous castle didn't grab us as much as other sites in Japan. Indeed, the temple complex of Mt Shosa - Enkyo-ji just outside town - had more of a wow factor for us and is highly recommended, particularly if you have seen Cruise's Last Samurai. Himeji is a beautiful castle to look at, no doubt, but the interior has little to see and the information in English is poor. There's a VR mobile phone system but you have to have a Japanese Google account to access it. Queues of people climbing the interior narrow stairs mean long waits, which detracts from the experience. So this is more of a seen it / done it location, at least for us."
78,Excellent ,The Himeji castle is one of the best preserved castles in Japan. It is close to the main train station in Himeji city. The castle has a famous panoramic view especially in cherry blossom season. The inside of the castle should be visited and it is possible to go to the top level of the castle where you can see the city.
79,Worth the long journey,"What an experience! Did you know that it’s not a castle but rather a watch tower for the emperor? We were lucky to have a free guided tour by a volunteer. A leisurely 20min stroll from Himeji Shinkansen station, stopping for a bowl of Uson Noodles with Prawn Tempura!! A lot of steep steps to get to the top..so be warned. Get there early to avoid the crowds. Some amazing Insta pics. Can see why this is the most popular of all castles. Please add to your bucket list."
80,Old world splendor in modern Japan,Most spectacular Castle in Japan... known from the James Bond Movie „You only live twice“. Also the interior is worth to visit
81,Ancient Feels,"The city of Himeji is dominated by this stunning castle.  It is called Hakuro--jo, the White Heron Castle, because of its brilliant white exterior and it is thought to resemble a white heron taking flight.  We visited at the time of the cherry blossom and the castle appeared to float on a cloud of pink flowers.We didn't take a tour of the interior of the castle (it's numbered/timed entry to the Main Keep) but the gardens are a delight.  Take a stroll around the back of the castle; it was an oasis of peace and tranquillity under the blossom !!  Or perhaps a boat trip around the moat ?"
82,My first Japanese Castle,"Personally, I love to see Himeji castle in the morning sunshine.Night time is also very fantastic.Of course, if you would like to go inside the castle, you need to visit day time.太陽に包まれた朝の姫路城は美しい。ライトアップされた夜の姫路城もまた乙。勿論中に入る事ができるのは日中だけです。"
83,Amazing FREE English tour,"Himeji castle (locals also call it Heron castle - Shirasagijo) is almost unanimously considered to be Japan's most spectacular castle. It is also a national treasure and protected as a World Heritage Site. It is one of only 12 original Japanese castles that has never been destroyed by war, fire or natural disasters. When visiting make sure to enter the grounds too. You have to pay for a ticket but it is well worth it. I was there first time in 2008 but the interior of the castle went through a renovation in 2015 and is now even more spectacular."
84,An absolute must,"Being a castle wich survived wars and bombings now it is an interesting visit to see the spaces inside. Do not expect the furnishings you saw in Kusorawa's Ran but small exhibitions related to the castle. Beware the stairs climbing up and then down! It's the only castle we visited, as recomended, but a good example as a building and as a whole set of fortifications. You can wander around at ease, if you do not mind the crowds which swarms all around."
85,A grand castle,"I came to Himeji Castle and I wasn't sure what to expect. I had seen many castles in Europe, but nothing like this. The unique designs and colors certainly rival Europe's finest palaces. There are also many gardens surrounding the castle along with a zoo and theme park, but I only went to the castle. The castle tour is fun. You walk at your own speed up many stairs. You have to take off shoes, however, to keep the castle tidy. The exterior is fantastic and a wonder to behold, but the interior does lack some of the flair of the outside. This contrast does keep the castle from earning five stars, but it's worth visiting if you're not too far."
86,An amazing Castle. A must tour.,Worth the day trip out to Himeji to see this beautiful castle. Was way less crowded than Osaka. And it certainly seemed much larger. There was some sort of AR app that we didn't download. But we saw others enjoying it very much. We felt like we could relax and enjoy this venue without being rushed in and out like many of the venues in Kyoto and Osaka. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting.
87,Take This Tour,"I knew I wanted to see inside one Japanese castle whilst I was in Japan and Himeji was a convenient and clear winner. Unlike many other castles that had been re-built or heavily renovated after World War 2, Himeji was almost untouched by the war and therefore had an immediate upper hand as you can actually see structures that are hundreds or years old. It does get super busy so I would recommend trying your best to go to it at off-peak times. That said, the only time I could go was at 3pm on a Saturday (super peak time) and it wasn't horrific. The flow of people was kept under control very well apart from the top floor where everyone ended up in a queue bottle-necked trying to get down the stairs. Still worth it. FYI - if you have a Kansai One Pass (IC card type) you should be able to get a discount from the entrance ticket. I forgot to show it however so no discount for me!"
88,"Amazing history, take a guided tour","It’s a Long train ride and walk to Himeji Castle from kyoto station but well I can say it’s well worth the trip!Superb architecture, very nice history, plenty of landscape and castle grounds for one to explore and rest. Take your time to scale the steep steps and admire the lush grounds.Personally one of my top 5 activities to do in japan. Just spend 1 day immersing yourself in this wonderful attraction."
89,Beautigl,"A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Himeji Castle boasts of its epic view around the city. Sitting on top of a montain, you can see the white color from afar. Prepare lots of water and be ready to walk a few hundred meters from the parking lot to the main castle. Be careful tho because stairs are short and very steep. Worth visiting!"
90,Great place and free guide service,"One of the best Japanese castle that I've visited thus far. Some form of climbing up of steep stairs required in the castle which could be difficult for old people or persons with weak joints/knees. Other than that, it's fantastic."
91,Step back in time,"A wonderful castle and a wonderful experience! It is within walking distance of the train station and casts an imposing feature over the straight walk up to the castle itself! We had a guided tour around the castle and the information provided was very interesting! The architecture and layout of the castle is inspiring! So many twists and turns to throw off any potential attackers! So much so that it was never actually attacked during its time in power. I couldn’t recommend this enough! As someone who loves castles, this is one of the most impressive I have visited! Definitely worth checking out for the historical value and awe-inspiring structure itself!"
92,Amazing site superb restoration work,"The castle and grounds are photogenic, but you don’t gain anything by going inside the building - it’s crowded.  If you want information, you’re better served going into the long corridor which adjoins the castle.  That is quite good."
93,Very interesting tour,"There's really nothing much at Himeji except for the castle, but is it worth it? Well, you just cannot miss this marvelous castle. And while it is pretty expensive to enter (JPY1000), it was pretty much worth it cause you can actually take photos inside. And do remember to download the Himeji app to make use of the AR experience."
94,Fantastic,"During our day trip to Himeji, a trip to the castle was a must. A spectacular structure steeped in history and beautifully preserved, we learnt so much. Do note that it’s a steep climb up to the castle and very steep stairs within the castle. It may not be advisable for the elderly or if you families with strollers. Would definitely recommend making a pit stop to the Himeji castle if you are visiting the town. Tip: if you have the time, purchase the ticket to the Koko-en gardens as well."
95,Impressive,"The price to get in, considering it's a historical castle in Japan, is surprisingly reasonable! We were surprised that a local offered to tour us around the castle and tell us about the history of the building structure, religions practices, and the families associated with Himeji Castle. Inoe-San, You made our visit delightful!"
96,Hidekazu Fujioka made this visit unforgettable,"This has to be the top visitor attraction in Japan, it is absolutely stunningly beautiful. We visited in a reasonably quiet day so there was no problem with queues. It is a bit of a struggle at times with the number of steps but take your time it will be worth it. Some of the staircases are steep so when coming down go backwards. An absolute must."
97,"Stunning castle from the outside, a long walk inside with a lovely view from the top",“Sakura” season has started. The harmony of white Himeji Castle and right pink “Sakura” blossom is very nice.
98,Has so much potentil to be excellent - put an exhibition inside!,"I've always wanted to Visit the White Heron Castle as the picture of this castle always adorned the calendars since I was young. Finally my dream came true and it's still the most beautiful castle in Japan. Not that I've visited all, but been to quite a few and this is still the most outstanding one.  So majestic! It's walkable from the Himeji JR Station. Around 20 minutes or so. Just straight down from the JR Station entrance. We took the bus, as we went to the ropeway first before returning to visit the White Heron. Climbed up to the tallest tower, although most of the artifacts are not there but can still admire the architecture and structure of the castle.After visiting the castle, we took a leisurely walk back to our hotel next to the JR station and it was a wonderful walk in the evening. Stopping by at the little shops selling green tea ice-cream and green tea. As we made our way back to the hotel, we got our bearings of where the shopping and food streets are. Sadly I couldn't explore everything as we only had 1 night there.Definitely intend to visit Himeji again!"
99,"Nice from the outside, disappointing on the inside","The castle was REALLY INTERESTING simply because of the fact that it is one of the most-preserved ones. The structure inside looks the same as it does in the past, thereby making Osaka Castle (with aircon and modern facilities inside) or Nagoya Castle pale in comparison (or even seem slightly fake).You'll have to take your shoes off and there's a lot of climbing and walking as you walk though all levels of the castle - thereby you're highly advised not to go if you're not very fit.Along the way, there are short and simple explanations on the place. At the same time, you may get the brochure provided for a better understanding.I went during the sakura season so there were some people camping outside the castle grounds watching the sakura as well.Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours there! The queue into the castle took quite long, but it's definitely worth it!!"
100,Too hot to properly appreciate,"Reasonably impressive castle, not much inside, much akin to chambord. Good views from top. As i said get there before the hordes. Nice garden nearby"
101,Empty shell,"Take a step back in time by visiting this beautiful castle.  It's an easy day trip from Kyoto or Hiroshima on the Shinkansen train.  Train station has a good number of lockers or varying sizes to store your bags while there. (Locker only accept 100 yen coins so make sure you have a few).  Explore the grounds and parks around the buildings, taking in the many photo ops.  The main building is a prime example of medieval Japanese wooden architecture.  Unfortunately, there are no furnishings in the buildings so you'll just have to imagine how beautiful it must have been.  The wooden beams and joints are pretty stunning if you think back in time to when these would have been hand hewn!!! Be advised that the castle is 7 stories high and the wooden staircases between floors are very steep with metal handrails.  Be sure to include the gardens in visit,  this a few extra Yen on your ticket but well worth it."
102,Great experience ,What makes Himeji saw amazing to me is that it remains almost entirley intact today as it was hundreds of years ago. Many of Japan's casyles had to be rebuilt or extensively repaired. Himeji's white appearance offers a stunning look. We went inside the castle itself. It was very crowded and the steps between levels are very steep. I would not recommend going in for the elderly or physically impaired. I've always wanted to see Himeji Castle and it didn't disappoint.
103,Great Himeji Castle,"We spent the night in Himeji because we wanted to see the castle. After reading other reviews, and having mobility issues,, we decided to not go in to the castle, but view it from outside. The staff were very helpful in showing us the route to follow to ensure there were no steps. Although the path was very steep at times,  it was concrete, and was easy enough to ascend. Definitely worth the effort to get up to the base of the castle and read the notes about the building on the way up."
104,Way better than Osaka Castle,The outside of the castle and grounds were beautiful during cherry blossom season. I'm not sure if it's worth paying to tour the castle. You can enter the castle grounds in front of the castle and get great photos without paying the entrance fee. The interior of the castle is interesting but there are very steep steps throughout and the grounds were definitely the highlight.
105,Impressive castle,"We took a day trip from Osaka taking Shinkansen train for half an hour ride. The castle looks much nicer than Osaka castle. Unlike Osaka castle with elevator, you have to walk six floors to top with steep stairs. Each floor is pretty empty but the structure and city view are great. We visited on a very hot day. There was no air conditioning inside. It was quite cool inside."
106,Surprisingly under-whelming,"This splendid castle, one of only twelve remaining ‘original ‘ castles in Japan is an absolute Must See if you are in Japan.  Easily accessible via Shinkansen and a brief walk, the castle is a delight of architecture and history.  Be sure to walk up to the top Shrine and absolutely do not miss the Shogun’s Gardens, one of the best in Japan.  You’ll definitely put a visit to Himeji as one of the top things you’ll do in Japan."
107,AR not working,"take train to Himeji Station. walking distance to castle. about 10-15 mins. pretty straight forward. just ask the locals in case you are in the wrong direction. part of the castle was under reno when i visited in mid Nov 2019. paid entry to the castle which would take u all the way up to the top. however, steps are narrow and steep. ceiling is low at certain areas. becareful."
108,Beautiful castle,"Himeji Castle is truly an amazing castle.  Make sure to plan a trip to Himeji for a full or half day (5 hours).  The castle was really gorgeous and magnificent, you can feel the hardwork and dedication of the Japanese people on maintaining and recreating this Gem.   Walking up and down each floors was an amazing experience.  Make sure to also visit the other halls around the castle.  Outside the castle there are also a lot of Locals dressed up as samurai's where you can take a picture with for free.  You can tell they are very proud of their history and legacy.  Himeji is a must visit if you are in Japan."
109,Combo castle and garden - fantastic day out,"The reason we chose to visit Himeji Castle was because we read that it was the best castle to visit. The castle is beautiful, but it is empty. Walking all the way to the top was great experience but there was nothing to see in the castle itself. The grounds were very interesting and we did spend half a day there. Outside the castle itself there were stalls with bonsai trees and beautiful flowers.Walking through himeji was fun and there were a lot of places to shop."
110,Last hour visit,Accessible readily from Osaka a visit is highly recommendedThe castle floats above its grounds like a glorious confectionaryThe stone work in the walls is amazing and the techniques used clearly explainedThereis enough information in English for interested foreigners although the interior is bare it gives a feeling for what it must oncehave been likeElements of the structure  are explained in small side displaysThe bailey a long narrow building is worth a visit to get a feeling for what living there must have been likeThere are quite steep steps through out the castle and no access for strollers or wheelchairsBusy but there is an attempt to control the throng in the keepWe did not bother with the top levels as the queue was hundreds of people long and we had other things to doWe were very happy to explore other areas around the castleThe 40 yen extra for the neighbouring gardens are great value as they are very beautiful
111,Highlight of our Japan Tour,"Himeji Castle was absolutely beautiful. There are no words that can describe how amazing it looks. It is definitely worth the train ride to see. I would like to make note that it is a bit of a walk from the station, not too long, but in the summer months can be a tough walk. Thus, we ended up taking a taxi to and from Himeji Castle."
112,Get there Early!,"Himeji Castle is a world heritage site -- a definite, must see when visiting Japan.  The castle is from the shogun/samurai era.  Amazing architecture with mostly tongue and groove construction.  Also stroll the nearby gardens to picnic and see the autumn colours.  Postcard pictures of Osaka Castle and Himeji Castle look the same, but Osaka Castle is a reconstruction whereas Himeji Castle is the original.  Postcards do not do Himeji Castle justice.  The traveller must go see, experience it, and be taken back in time to fully appreciate it."
113,Beautiful castle must pair with the gardens ticket,"Is it one of the absolutely ""must see"" attractions in Japan. It's an astonishing structure that makes you realise the power of the Shoguns in the years between 1500-1600."
114,Beautiful castle ,What a fascinating place!. The story behind how this castle came to be built and the clever planning behind its defensive measures was very impressive. We spent a happy few hours here and were glad we took the time to travel here on a day trip from Kyoto.Very impressive and full of interesting facts.
115,UNESCO world heritage site.,Astonishing and amazingly beautiful architecture which could withstand Bombing of world war.Little tough to climb the stairs.Worth climbing up the top of seven storied castle.Well maintained place to visit.
116,Good trip from Kyoto. UNESCO World Heritage Site.,"This classic castle, first in Japan  to be UNESCO is a must visit. There are a number of slides explaining the construction techniques and to go inside you must remove shoes for walking on the wooden floors. The climbs are via some rather steep stairs but worth it for the views. The only downside is a lack of furniture to give a perspective of how life was inside but you understand how it was used. Must combine the entry ticket with the lovely gardens nearby."
117,The White Heron,"Himeji may seem a little out of the way to get to but, my goodness, this castle is not to be missed.  From the moment one exits the train station, the castle dominates the town and, as one hikes up through the many gates, each turn seems reveal another gorgeous perspective.  The inside of the main building is mostly empty but there is information about the design and defensive features that is interesting.  I recommend paying the slightly higher fee and taking the time to walk over to the castle gardens.  Even in December, they were well worth exploring."
118,What a beauty,"This building boasts an impressive exterior, with lovely surroundings. However the interior leaves much to the imagination. There are no figures, or pictures, or even descriptions on what each floor was. This was disappointing as we had no idea what we were looking at"
119,The beautiful traditional Japanese castle,Stunning. beauiful castle just out of Kyoto by train. Quick walk from the Himeji train station. It was a cloudy day but the structure was so stunning that it made up for it. A must see
120,One of Our Favorite Attractions in Japan,Finally got the chance to visit this wonderful castle.  It is magnificent!  Quite some stairs to climb so this may be quite challenging for ppl with knee problem.
121,Brilliant castle well worth visiting,"Worth the 4 hours journey to and fro from Osaka.  A Unesco worthy castle that worth spending a day there. Slowly walk thru the ground and understand the history of the castle under different lords. Every tiles, every structure can indicate different era under different lords. Best will be with a guide who can explain the history to you clearly."
122,Most beautiful castle in Japan,"An easy walk from the train station is the imposing and magnificent Himeji Castle. Unlike many other Japanese castles, this has never been destroyed by natural or man made disasters. It is most deserving of its World Heritage Listing. The main keep is a 6 storey wooden structure with each level accessible by a series of relatively narrow wooden staircases. The view and the historical relevance make the climb to the top, worth it."
123,A Great Example of Japanese Architecture,Amazing ambience of the castle. We arrived at the Himeji station around 2pm from Osaka. A bit late and the station is not small. We met VERY friendly staffs who recommended us a cheaper train ticket and refunded us the difference of the fares immediately! Then explained us patiently how to get to the scenes and what is worth to see in such a short period of time. The castle closed at 5 and cannot get in after 4. It is a big castle and a bit rush for us this time! We decided to walk back to the station after visiting the castle. A surprised little noodle shop caught our eyes. Ekisoba (local dish) is only cost 380 yen and it is tasty in a chilly evening! People here are so friendly! Will definitely come back and stay in this beautiful little town for at least a night!
124,Beautiful castle,"It was worth the trip from Osaka to see Himeji Castle. It's absolutely breathtaking and awe inspiring. I would recommend learning a bit about the history of the castle before visiting. After travelling to different historical sites, you start to see how each fits into the history particularly Himeji Castle with regards to Toyotomi Hideyoshi.  Definitely worth the visit."
125,Highly-impressive Himeji Castle!,"Really pleased to have made the day trip from Kyoto to Himeji to see the commanding presence of this Castle.  But like many others, really didn't need to see the inside.  Walking to the castle from the drop off point showed it's grandeur and presence. We enjoyed walking around and then going to the Koko-en gardens.  We felt we had a very good day of sightseeing doing all of this."
126,As original as it gets!,"This magnificent castle is so beautiful for outside view, but it is amazing to see the inside the castle which is made of many huge wood pillars and dark rooms, prepared for wars without decorations and jewelries."
127,Must-see Himeji Castle while in the Kansai area,"We loved this original preserved castle. You have to take your shoes off when entering the castle and they give you a small bag to carry them with you. Be warmed that you will have to climb a couple of floors up and then also down, the stairs are fairly steep and there is not lift. Inside you get to see some of the original posts as well as a representation of the original panels. Besides that the castle was empty of decorations and there weren’t too many English signs to provide context. Nevertheless we enjoyed our visit and thought it was worth the trip from Osaka."
128,"Marvellous castle, fantastic tour with Fujioka-san","Beautiful place to visit. Definitely recommend this place.  Hundreds of steps though, so not suitable for everyone."
129,Lovely castle with hidden gems,Perfect example of Japanese Period Castle . Head set tour quiet difficult to use. However worth exploring at tour own pace.
130,Gorgeous castle,"We were so fortunate to see castle on the day they started offering English guided tour. Without a guide, we would have missed a lot of interesting details and history. There are a hundred visitors who go through here at a time and have to keep moving. it can feel like cattle or herd. So I'm happy we took the guided tour to give us information as we walk through the castle. The guide was very knowledgeable , hospitable, and she speaks English well. Definitely worth the ¥1000Wear or bring socks. You'll be given a plastic bag to carry your shoes throughout the castle. I recommend yoga sock with grip at the bottom as it can be slippery walking on the smooth wooden floors with socks. I highly recommend this site when visiting Japan."
131,Major bucket list item checked off!  There's an app for that!,"Beautiful grounds dominated by the towering white castle. It would be particularly beautiful in cherry blossom time or fall colours, but would likely be even more crowded with visitors."
132,One of the best in Japan,after restauration the castle offers a breathtaking view from many locations inside and outside.We bought the tickets one day earlier and went directly into the castle without to line up at the ticket office.Its advisible to come as early as possible. At noon they closed the gate due to overcrowding.
133,Get there early,"A must visit for historical places lover. The walk from the Himeji main station to the castle area, was only few minutes away. But because so many things to see during the walk, we ended up reaching there in 45 minutes 🤣.We went there on Sunday noon, and there were garage sale going on along part of the road. And then need to pass the beautiful garden and or zoo. Enter the castle, we needed to take off shoes and wearing the provided slippers. Prepare for the steep stairs. Many old people really made it to the top of the castle. View from the top was lovely. The inside of the castle was all beautiful wooden construction. Worth for the visit. Nice town, too."
134,Impressive Castle,"This stunningly beautiful white and black 400 year old castle is visible for miles around. Protected from intense damage during wars, it’s been carefully restored ensuring many of the stunning carvings can still be seen. Built mainly from wood from some very tall columns, the interior can be viewed footprints 1000 yen. Be aware that the wooden stairs to the various floors are relatively steep & are climbed without shoes. But the climb is worth it."
135,Majestic and Beautiful,We visited on a 33 degree Celsius day when it felt like 40 inside the castle. It is an attractive place to visit and the structure is massive. With the heat I only lasted till the mid point and I was disappointed that the castle rooms are not decorated to show visitors how the castle would have looked in its prime. I would love to visit again on a cooler day to properly appreciate the full castle.
136,Well-preserved Heritage,"A definite must see experience in Himeji. This world heritage site commands the surrounding countryside.This medieval era fort is great viewing. A word of warning, there are a lot of stairways to the top of the keep and low headroom. Not for those who are claustrophobic or have a fear of heights.Remarkably this castle never featured in an actual battle.Numbers can be limited so best to go in off peak times.Highly recommended"
137,White Heron Castle,"This is the most beautiful castle in the world.  Be advised that there are FREE tour guides in English at Himeji.  It is important to ignore the person outside the ticket booth selling $10 tours, this is not the real tour!  After buying a ticket to the castle enter the grounds and walk past the ticket booth, immediately turn left and you will find a FREE tour guide window in English.  These tour guides are members of a 50-person historical society dedicated to Himeji castle.My tour guide, Midori, was beyond wonderful to me!  I received a personalized 2 hour tour of the castle; just her and me.  Himeji was built with many secrets to surprise attackers, so I would have never noticed them without Midori's impressive knowledge to point them out.  I am very grateful for her kind tour!Definitely visit Himeji and experience it with one of the nicest historical societies I've ever met!"
138,Absolutely Stunning Structure,This is the first thing you see when you come out of the train station in Himeji.  It sets the backdrop for the city and does not disappoint.  The grounds are beautiful and offer a lot of space to explore.  Did not actually tour the inside of the Castle because it was Golden Week and the wait to get inside the Main Keep was almost two hours.  We strolled the rest of the area and went into the Long Hall.  Beautiful park at this castle too where lots of people assemble just to enjoy the day.
139,Worthwhile the day trip from Kyoto ,"Lovely castle and gardens with amazing architecture.  Pick up a brochure as its worth at least understanding a little of the castle’s history.  A short walk directly from Himeji Railway Station.  We stopped here and stored luggage on our way between Hiroshima and Osaka.  A good wander through the main castle filled in about 2 hours, but you could spend much longer exploring all the grounds.  Lovely place.  I’d recommend!"
140,Beautiful castke,"visited on a saturday in full sakura season, so crazy busy. But it is iconic and not to be missed. we went in the castle, it has been done out as it would have looked when built, so beautiful wood everywhere and space. It took about 90 mins from starting to queue to leaving the castle so well worth it, this was during the restricted access to the castle due to so many people."
141,A breathtakingly beautiful castle,This is another national treasure of Japan. It is the pride and joy of Himeji and understood when you visit. It is an architectural delight.  It was a castle that enjoyed only a peaceful time. The grounds in typical Japan fashion are gorgeous. And if you take your steps slowly you will get to the top!!!
142,A nice time at an impressive castle,"The highlight of the castle is the Main Keep.  The main Keep is a wooden building and externally the main Keep appears to have 5 floors. However, it actually has a 7 floor configuration  consisting of six internal floors and a basement.  At the basement are two toilets and a sink. At the first floor, we saw the decorative covers which conceal nail heads on beams connected to pillars. We also located the stone drops where in the past, allow the throwing of stones and firing on enemy soldiers. On reaching the second floor, we saw a garret room over the entrance and lattice windows which are opened. There are also many weapon racks as the main Keep was used as a weapon stockroom. At the four corners of the 3rd floor are spaces for deploying warriors in an ambush.  At the north and south sides of the floor, there are higher positioned windows, so there are stone throwing platforms.  High Windows at the 4th floor allowed gun smoke to escape. At the 5th floor, we could see two large pillars, east and west. These pillars extend from the basement level up to the 5th floor beam. The west pillar is rectangular whereas the east pillar is round in shape. The Osakabe Jingu shrine is located on the 6th floor.  Be careful when you climb the narrow , steep staircase. From the lattice windows we could see the city, Koko en  and the moat. Next we went to the West Balley . We had to walk through a long roofed passsage before getting to the room of Princess Sen. Do look out and note the different types of gates, towers, stone walls, roof tiles , windows, openings on the walls and the shachi."
143,Visit of Himeji-jo with volunteer Guide Hidekazu Fujioka,"Great Castel, High Building with Old region. You can go by rail way from Osaka with 1.30 hours. Good land scape with many plant."
144,Empty and Disappointing,"Sadly I found Himeji Castle a little disappointing, but in saying that, it’s still something you have to visit. The structure itself is impressive, with beautiful wooden floors and massive timber beams, but that’s about all. The AR app wouldn’t work, the QR site was average and there was nothing to see except the view. It was like walking through an empty museum. I enjoyed Matsumoto more, just for the display of armour and weapons. Also if you’re going in summer, arrive early, the heat is crazy."
145,A castle with a smart defense system that was never used.,"This fairy tale castle is always at its most spectacular in Spring, when all the blossom is out. The castle itself is spectacularly situated on a hill, approached through extensive gardens, some 2 km from the mainline station, and features prominently on many promotional posters and advertising for Japanese tourism.  Easy reach from Osaka, this is an absolute must-see venue for visitors to Western Honchu!"
146,UNESCO World Heritage Site --  A must-see!,"If you want to see an authentic castle which has never been destroyed or damaged, this is the place. Super impressive from top to bottom. Lots of history and great stories. Be prepared to walk up many stairs to get to the top but it's well worth it."
147,Simply Stunning!,"This is a truly magnificent castle and as you walk around the grounds there are many fine views of this astonishing building. It is built on top of the biggest, most impressive dry stonewall I've ever seen. The building itself brings thoughts of  Samurai. Used many times in films from Kurosawa's films to James Bond. This is a visual treat as well as an historically important part of Japanese culture. Don't miss it. When you have finished in the castle grounds, make sure you walk to the castle gardens ten minutes away. Wonderful."
148,Historic and Magnificant Castle,"The castle is superb and our guide Hidekazu was great, full of enthusiasm and interesting facts and anecdotes."
149,Japan Holiday 2019,Maybe I am spoilt from the castles I have visited in Europe. The castles in Europe are furnished with household goods from that era. Japanese castles are basically bare timber floors and a lot of stairs to to top floor.The zoo is there for the children and there are people dressed in periodic costumes for photographs.Easy walk from the train station and the town has a huge shopping arcade. From the railway station to the castle. There is an entry fee and it does get crowded.Worth a visit
150,Majestic ,This castle is an amazing sight to behold. It has been used in several films and is a UNESCO heritage site. It has been renovated over the years. The setting in gardens is wonderful. It is a steep climb up many sets of stairs inside and in my opinion it is many appreciated as a visual feast from the outside.
151,An inside view of ancient woodwork,"We stayed at Kobe close to the train station and getting to Himeji was pretty easy. I took the JR train from Kobe station to Himeji station which took 35 minutes and four stops. Then walked the 800m or so to the entrance of the castle grounds which you can actually see from the train station.The castle is supposed to be the oldest, best condition and most visited castle in Japan, and indeed it is quite spectacular. It is possible to wander around much of the gardens before reaching the inner compound without paying and get some decent photos of the castle, but the real experience is in visiting the inside of the castle and climbing the many flights of steep wooden steps to the top of the castle. Cost of entry was 1,000 Yen for adults.The castle is built pretty high and there are a lot of steps to climb even just to get to the first floor of the castle. There are several huge old wooden gates to pass through and a few sections of the castle with low wooden beams and stone walls. However, you can see lots of history in the materials  and ancient looking dark wooden beans and supports everywhere.To enter the actual castle you need to remove your shoes and are given a plastic bag and have to carry the shoes during the visit. This can be tricky if you are carrying a backpack or heavy camera since I believe there are perhaps 8 or 10 flights to climb up. All the stairs are made of ancient wood and very steep, but thankfully there are modern handrails to help you climb up and keep your balance. The higher you go, the smaller the rooms become.Within the castle areas are roped off so you just need to keep going up and up and then once you have visited the topmost room you descend the stairs which is actually a lot more tricky. Be warned that some of the wooden beams are very low so you will need to crouch when descending and ascending these stairs. Also, if you are visiting the castle in winter time as I did then be warned that it is very cold inside and  without shoes your feet may well feel very cold.On the way out of the main castle you can also visit some of the other buildings, one of which also required us to remove our shoes and walk I believe along corridors for 300m with small rooms off it, and as a kind of museum with displays in these rooms.All in all this was a brilliant experience and you cannot fail to be awed by the majestic splendor of the castle and it's architecture. It is certainly the best castle that I have visited in Japan."
152,Well worth visiting,"Even though you can see the castle from the JR train, it’s still about a 25-30 mins walk from the JR Himeji station.  This was unbearable on the hot day (when we visited) as there are no shade trees lining the street and we are surrounded by concrete buildings along the way.  When it sunny & hot, it’s best to take the city bus or taxi to the castle instead of walking.We skipped a visit to Osaka Castle in favor of Himeji Castle since it’s one of the original castles (not reconstructed).  It is a very regal white castle high up on the hill and very large grounds.  We set aside at least 2 hours to leisurely see everything including the Kokoen Garden.  Admission is 1040Y (including the garden), more than the Osaka Castle admission at 600Y.  Afterwards, it was a short JR train ride to nearby Kobe for a Kobe beef meal."
153,Just....WOW!,"Visited this on our recent holiday after a recommendation from friends.  From the outside the castle is very impressive - it has obviously been well looked after.  The view from the top of the castle is amazing but you really have to work to get up there, with many steep staircases to negotiate.  The interior of the castle is surprisingly bare, which is a real disappointment as other castles have relevant exhibits which add to the experience.  Aside from the exterior photo opportunities ad the view at the top, there isn't much else in the castle of interest.  We didn't visit the adjacent gardens as the weather was brutally hot, but we have heard they are quite beautiful."
154,Another World Cultural Heritage Site,"I had a slow walk, about 20min from Himeji Station to Himeji Castle.  Do not worry about the directions.  Once you are at the station you can ask the station staff or just look at the signage above you & you will not go wrong.  The Castle is already visible when you walk on the street towards it.  There is a nice shopping mall outside the train station as well as some shopping streets toward your destination. There are many eateries on both sides of the streets, even at the back of the alleys. Those restaurants & pubs lying at the back only open in the evening. Before you hit Himeji Castle, you will arrive at the town square.  Should you want to try a trishaw ride, ask for a good price.  I didn’t try but I saw tourists were talking to these strong men about some pricings.  There are many small shops in the square too. Some sell nice umbrellas which I bought a few (the staff could speak good English), other shops sell souvenirs.  There are restaurants there too.  The external path & garden of the castle was already so breathtakingly beautiful. Though the sky was gloomy that day, my phone camera didn’t quite stop clicking at the scenery.  At every angle I viewed, the castle was so majestic & beautiful.  Some trees were already turning red.I didn’t have the chance to visit the inside of the castle as the queue was very long.  More tourists were joining behind me and I gave up willingly.  Hence, I spent more time strolling in the clean park.  Air was fresh as it was breezy. I wasn’t disappointed at all.  After all, the entire compound was so nice for a stroll.  There were some structures erected at the open field which meant for the upcoming lights-up.  I spent about 2 hours all in all. On the way back to the train station, I walked on the left street.  I stopped at a small eatery selling udon.  I had a simple but economical bowl of tempura udon.  It was satisfying in this breezy weather."
155,Worth the visit,"It was truly beautiful, to say the least. It is quite a climb on to the top. Narrow wooden stairs. Might be a little tough for those with knee problems. Actually, there is nothing much to see inside the castle. The view from the top was really nice though. Walk around the garden outside the castle. You will be able to take a really nice photo of the castle. We bought the JR pass so took the Shinkansen from Shin Osaka. Took us only about 20 mins."
156,Probably the most beautiful castle in Japan ,We used our JR passes to take a 5p min trip from Kyoto to visit this castle. The castle is spectacular on the outside but rather boring inside. You climb up the seven levels on narrow staircases to the top and then back down again. However you do get a good idea about how the. Ashley was built. The visit is not recommended for small children or people with mobility problems. Make sure you buy a combined ticket and visit the beautiful gardens as well. They are a short walk away from the castle near the most.
157,Amazing castle,"My husband and I have wanted to visit Himeji-jo (Himeji Castle) since before we started coming to Japan with the Manjiro Summit in 2007.  We've been to many castles in the meantime.  It's actually a good thing that we waited, because they did a massive restoration and the roof tiles are white again.  It's so beautiful!  Since we had been looking forward to this so much, we bought the castle and garden ticket, signed up for a tour in English, and did some exploring on our own.  We got there between the two English tours, so we spent a lot of time in the very reasonably priced gift shop near the entrance, including a $13 Shiromaruhime plushie!  Shiromaruhime is a white ball with Himeji Castle on her head.  She's the mascot for the castle and is amazingly cute.  I bought a t-shirt of her in the shops across the street at the intersection.  They had American sizes and sample shirts.  There's an app for that!  There's a Himeji Castle app (it mentions it in the English handout), you click the Self-Guided Tour, and look for signs that say AR (augmented reality).  Some have videos that you can download, some let you look through the walls to see how the castle was put together, and some let you look out onto Himeji as it was many years ago. There are also 3 photo ""items"" that you can download (frame, Shiromaruhime, and samurai armor).  The AR by the well says ""Look up!""  You look up and there's an obake (ghost) of the lady who died in the well.  Yipe!The castle tour takes you up lots of stairs, so be able to walk up 6 stories (while carrying your shoes in a provided plastic bag).  There is a lovely view of the city from the top!  Once you start, you're committed, because the entire castle is one way only.  It was cool inside, even when it was 85 degrees Fahrenheit outside.  We wore moisture wicking clothes.  At the end of the English tour, we got to take pictures with fun outfits.  We walked through the princess' wing where we saw a video on the restoration.  There's a small gift shop on your way out.  I think it's a little more expensive than the one outside the entrance."
158,Absolutely beautiful ,"Our last several visits to Himeji did not allow us to enjoy the grandeur as the castle was wrapped in scaffolding. This time, lo and behold it was in it's full glory.Cherry blossoms all round, herds of people and grounds packed with picnickers. You get it, lots of people.True our visit inside was not as memorable as our first due to the sea of humanity but I would still argue that if you do not go inside the castle and climb to the 6th floor you have done your self a disservice. Granted you need to be able to climb and descend steep steps however if you can you must go in. Expansive grounds, lovely gardens, beautiful castle. Completely and utterly worth your time to visit and explore."
159,Historic Gem,"This place is worth making the effort to get to. In our case, it was pouring with rain but the castle itself is magnificent. We learnt lots - including how to climb extremely steep stairs in Japanese slippers which was quite an effort! We were lucky to be there on the last day of the special opening of the west keep - only done in Feb each year so we saw more of how the rooms were connected."
160,"Very impressive castle, worth a visit","Awesome Castle . Amazing views . Lucky to have visited on a clear sunny day which made for picture postcards . Stairs are very steep inside , not fir the faint hearted. Shoe removal required"
161,Best Castle in Japan,We visited this magnificent castle on June 17.  The weather was fantastic.  We were lucky to get an amazing English speaking volunteer guide Mr Komatsu who was humorous and knowledgeable.   He explained how the castle was supposed to function in the event of a war.  Very informative.   The walk around the castle took us more than 2 hours and we thoroughly enjoyed it. There are many stairs to climb and would be challenging for older people.  I would say it is the most beautiful castle we have seen in Japan.  A must visit for tourists going to Himeji.
162,A fairytale castle with WOW factor.,"Visited the castle as a couple and took advantage of the free guide service, she was amazing well informed excellent English with extensive knowledge of the  castle and made a real difference to our trip. I have always been slightly wary of agreeing to free guides (as most of them are not free) but in this case all payment was refused"
163,You must see this castle!,"One of the few castles in Japan that remains more or less in its original state. You can see it from far off and it gets even better looking as you approach. Visitors are allowed inside the castle keep but you have to remove your shoes before entering - no surprise there, this is Japan after all. The steep stairs do not make going up (or down) all seven levels easy, but we saw an 88-year-old grandma do it so there’s no excuse not to do the same."
164,Captivating Castle !!,"After 4 1/2 years, I finally visited Himeji Castle for the second time, and it was even more stunning than the first time. I even caught a rainbow in the morning with a perfectly clear sky. Himeji is one of the largest castles I've been to in japan, and the most expensive one, too, if you go inside. However, the walk around inside the castle is worth it to get a feel for what it was like in those years when the castle was used as a defense. Enjoy climbing steep staircases on dimly lit floors to admire the the holes in the walls for arrows and shotguns. The grounds themselves are also fun to wander around, so budget some time to really soak in the experience. You can also admire the castle for free from different angles and get some great photo shots. Try the bridge on the way to the entrance, the main grounds in front of the castle, and the Shiromidai Park just a short walk southeast of the castle on a street corner. Also, don't forget to explore the city a bit on your way to and from the castle from the station. There is a nice covered shopping street you can check for souvenirs and other goods on your way to the castle."
165,Can’t miss this- will be tricky if can’t do steps,Ken did a fantastic job of touring us through the Himeji Castle with lots of historical insights and interesting information. He also made sure to take us to all the spots for the best camera angles for pictures. A must for the Himeji Castle. Ken's added suggestion of a Kobe Beef lunch At his favourite spot in Kobe absolutely made our day. And a nice finish was the gondola ride up to the Kobe herb gardens. Thanks Ken for a great day in many ways.
166,Glorious Castle,"This castle is big. Not just big but MASSIVE. No photo taken of it exists that depicts just how imposing it is. You have to stand in front  (well below) it to understand. So beautiful.We didn't bother going inside as I wouldn't have made the trip up, let alone back down.Surprisingly on our way out I found the best part of visiting this location. We nearly walked past it as the set of stone stairs at the base doesn't even offer a hint of what lies beyond. We came across the most beutiful nature setting we've seen in Japan to date. A mixture of plant life (including cherry blossoms of course) that was simply magical! The backdrop and grounds of this area was a carpet of cherry blossom petals that looked like something out of a painting. It was hard to believe. Amazing."
167,Nice one day trip from Osaka,"Apart from the beauty of the castle, I learned a lot from the tour guide about the history of the castle and how it was designed to defend itself from enemies which was very interesting."
168,Get there early,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but had a great time. Gardens were lovely and the castle was easy to get around. Have to take shoes off when walking around within the actual castle. Great views of the surrounding area once at the top. If driving, plenty of parking available. Recommend a visit. If coming by train, easy flat walk up to castle entrance."
169,Himeji castle,You can see the castle right from the Himeji station. You don't need to go by bus. YOu can easily walk some minutes to the castle. beautiful nature and garden around the castle. It was an impressive view from the top of the castle over the whole city.
170,Picture perfect,"We took a day trip from Osaka to visit the Himeji Castle. As soon as we stepped out of the train station, we enjoyed the openness and quietness of the city, a good break from the busy Osaka and Tokyo. The castle is within walking distance from the train station so we opted to walk. The castle looked so beautiful and stunning from the outside. There was a small admission fee to go inside. We went in November so it wasn’t super crowded and no lineup to get in. As some people has commented, the castle wasn’t “furnished“ but you go in to admire the architectural designs and the constructions . We took our time on each level and no one rushed us. There were some steep stairs to climb going up to some levels so may not be suitable for everyone. Once on the top level, the views were spectacular. We were lucky to visit on a clear day so we could see far. After exiting the castle, I think most people just left. We walked around a bit and found out you could actually walk inside the corridor surrounding the castle. That was very interesting too. Our admission also included the entry to the nearby garden “ Koko-en ”. Given that it was the fall, not many flowers could be seen. It was still nice to walk around and enjoyed the quietness. If you happen to be in Osaka or Kyoto, I highly recommend this place to visit. One last note,  I didn’t know about the “Discover Himeji Castle with AR” until much later so I didn’t download the app. With the app and the QR codes at various spots, visitors could get more details about the castle."
171,Lovely castle - even better with an English Speaking (Volunteer) guide,"Himeji Castle is of course one of the most iconic images from Japan, and I wanted to squeeze in Himeji somehow in my trip. I did so by squeezing it in my day-trip between Kyoto and Hiroshima. The castle is 20-minute walk from JR station, or 1 bus away with 2 stops. Once you start approaching the castle, you start getting the beautiful views of the castle. There are huge grounds outside the entrance which afford nice views, to click photos of yourself as well if you want. However despite all the hype, I'd strongly suggest to not waste your time, money and energy going in. There is absolutely nothing inside, it's barren walls amongst a lot of steep stairs to get to the top from where you can see some city views. At the end of descending, I entered museum which detailed about the Castle and how it survived the WW2 becoming an iconic part of Japanese identity. This museum was a better experience than rest of the climbing stairs inside. I'd go as far as to call the castle not unmissable, and if you can't squeeze it in your trip don't worry- Osaka Castle looks majestic too, and inside that castle there is actually something."
172,"Nice castle, too crowded!",We really enjoyed this castle as it is extremely beautiful by also you could see it would be a very effective castle for defence.We did a day visit from Kyoto and it was very easy to get there and back.The grounds around the castle looked impressive too but it was a little too hot when we got there so we didn’t stay in the grounds that long.Our children enjoyed the visit and enjoyed the origami ninja stars that were given to them by a member of staff.
173,Japanese World Heritage Site,"Once you get inside the castle seems a little bare, we queued and climbed to the top, which gave a nice view out of the main keep."
174,Awesome Castle!,"the interiors are austere; the exterior is what makes this special, as well as the surrounding hillsides and views of the town below."
175,Number one castle in Japan,I absolutely loved this castle! It’s stunning and so photogenic. Well worth a stop if driving past or as a day trip from Kobe.
176,Great and Good Castel to visit ,"We visited the Himeji Castle as part of our tour of Japan and WOW! what an experience, you have to see this castle to believe just how amazing this building is and the view from the top is spectacular even when the dark clouds come rolling in and boy did it rain.The castle is the largest surviving example of traditional Japanese castles. It comprises 83 buildings the white roof of this UNESCO registered complex is said to invoke the wings of a heron taking flight, hence the name  Shirasagi-jo meaning White Heron Castle. Put this on your bucket list if your visiting Japan, you won't be disappointed."
177,Beautiful with the Sakura,within the walking distance and easy access from Train station. the historical castle with wonderful garden and surrounds. Don't miss
178,Sakura Bliss,It was greatest privilege bestowed on me to be able to walk the floor where many great samurai warriors walked such as Hideyoshi and othersIt's a hard work to get to the very top but hard work paid off at the end!!Not only I touched 400 old wooden pillar but also obtained excellent view on Himeji city!!Highly recommendStart early to avoid crowds and not to be pushed around by tourist
179,Magnificent castle,"It was already awesome looking the time we came out of the station. The walk on the road to Himeji castle from the station was about 15 mins or 20 mins slow walk. Along the road you can find lots of yummy food like the udon, ramen, gyoza and shopping streets, so it’s never boring to walk. Posted on the food in a separate post. In the himeji castle compound there was a small zoo which we didn’t go as that was not the highlight. Besides the castle, there are other structural compound at the site that u can visit first if the castle gets crowded. The stairway within the castle and buildings are steep, so if you are bringing young kids or elderly, it may be a challenge if you decide to go all the way up to the top of the castle. See one of the photo. For tall folks, be aware of your head as the beam at the entrance/exit of the stairway may be too low for u. Everyone will have to change to their slippers. They have it in big, medium and kids size. As I have slim feet, the slippers keeps falling off so for safety reasons, i walked bare footed while climbing up and down the stairs. I do see some kids having the slippers falling off too. At the top of the castle , the windows are with bars so it was hard taking gd views at the top. Anyhow, if u hv experienced a castle in japan before, the interior is more or less the same I guess. Another thing my sis noticed while going up and down the castle was that it was slighted slanted to one side which was true when we read one of the narratives. We went in winter and it was awesome already. Can’t imagine when it’s during cherry blossom. But still I prefer lesser crowd."
180,Beautiful!,"Like all big tourist attractions, get there when they open. It’s a convoluted course through the castle with lots of steep stairs so you don’t want to be bunched up in a line. The castle is in gorgeous shape with good signage in English. After the tour a visit to the third bailey is also worthwhile."
181,Amazing Cultural Site,"Saw Matsumoto and Himeji castle on my trip to Japan, both are outstanding, but Himeji being perched up on a hill, makes it stand out more for me. Every view of it is outstanding and really enjoyed the model of it inside the castle as well. Only an hour or so by train from Kyoto, so an easy day trip."
182,Spectacular visual feast,"We went to Himeji on a day trip from Kyoto via Shinkansen, and found it an incredibly worthwhile experience. The castle is stunning, sitting high on a hill at the end of a long boulevard, that leads from the train station. At the tail-end of the Japanese New Year's celebration, we were concerned about the crowds, but the hour, or so wait, as we wound up the narrow road to the castle, was itself enjoyable, and climbing through the castle itself a great lesson in history and craftmanship. It has been on my 40-year long Japan bucket list, and I was very happy I went.."
183,Incredible even without entering!,"It is definitely worth the commute from Osaka to visit Himeji Castle.  The tour inside the castle gives you a feel for the solid yet humble construction of the fort.  One note of warning, there are stair to climb to the top floor. Some stairs are quite steep.  The views from each floor is breathtaking. We were there during the cherry blossoms that just added another layer of beauty to an already beautiful castle."
184,Scenic castle within easy reach of Osaka,"We walked all around it first, and got to see egrets? roosting in a big tree.  A beautiful park behind it.  We saw it in the daylight, going inside for the whole experience.  It was a tad cold in there, in our stocking feet, but it was amazing to see the structure.  We saw it at night, all lit up and just a gorgeous symbol for the city.  The stone walls at the base, the smooth walls of the castle, so interesting to see. And so easy to get to from the train station.  15 minute walk up a broad boulevard with sculptures all the way.  We missed the street festival by one day!!"
185,Among the most spectacular castles in Japan,"The highlight of the castle would be when we took off our shoes and walked on the exact ground that the historical figures have walked on before. This was the first place I've been to that has allowed us to do this, and it was very interesting to view the castle's floors and architecture as it originally was, without destroying it with our shoes. There are many floors up, and I do not think it's accessible via wheelchair for that segment.Unfortunately, all the fun ended for us when it was time to go back down.Going in winter, none of us wore thermal socks, since our shoes were windproof and waterproof and protected us from the elements. Thus, wearing thin socks on the cold wooden floors started turning our feet numb towards the end.Walking up steep flights of stairs when just starting off seemed like fun, but coming down was much more difficult. Without protection for our feet, the rubber stoppers at the end of each step meant to prevent you from slipping actually started to hurt when stepped on. It was definitely very precarious and we were genuinely worried about falling or hitting our heads on the beams.Overall, it was still quite fun and very beautiful, providing a nice view of himeji."
186,What an amazing sight,My partner and I had an amazing time at himeji castle it was one of the best things about our trip.Be able to go inside and walk all the way to the top was an experience I will never forget. I will make sure to go back on my next trip to japan
187,not to be missed,"I strongly recommend this beautiful, well maintained and traditional castle. I really appreciate the architecture and guide visit of the historical location."
188,Amazing structure and beautiful gardens,With the JR railway pass it’s easy to do the 1 hour trip and walk from the station to the castle. Impressive building and the English speaking guide was terrific highlighting hidden features.   Plenty of walking and climbing stair cases. Not to be missed and do visit the adjacent garden.
189,Amazing Castle,"We made a day trip to Himeji from Hiroshima using the 7 day kansai west pass. It was a long but fruitful walk from the JR station to the castle as we stopped by souvenir shops and a nice restaurant serving beef bowls. The castle grounds are huge and takes a long time to cover everything including the long corridor. There is only one way up and another way down. Once inside, we must take off our shoes and change into special slippers that are provided for us. They will give us a bag to put our own shoes in which we will need to carry throughout the visit until we leave the main keep. Steps are very steep and narrow so it's not for the faint hearted. The view at the top of the keep is not that fantastic but it's a good exercise to climb up anyway."
190,Excellent but so busy,"from the first sight on distance already it atracting, and the whole walk to it is fun.plenty of toilets around. some climbing to to and I didnt see elevator.really worthwhile to go and spend 3-4 hours there."
191,sakura plus castle? splendid!,A must do for tourists in the area. We too a bullet train from Kyoto which only took an hour. You can walk right to the top of the castle but the steps are quite steep so reasonable fitness is required. Even despite the oppressive heat on the day we went we all had a great time.
192,"Great, but you need not go in the castle","Himeji castle was one of our Japan trip highlights. I can understand it wouldn’t have been so interesting for people without a tour guide, but we were fortunate to have a free English-speaking guide available when we arrived. He explained all the castle’s inbuilt defence systems and it was fantastic! Really clever and so well planned. A word of warning: the complete tour takes a long time and there are many steps and sets of steep staircases. It was quite exhausting but we’re so happy we went."
193,Way too crowded! Hard to enjoy.,"Although there was a sign saying that there were no English Guides that day at Himeji Castle, I asked if there were any.  And we had a wonderful volunteer guide that spent a few hours taking just my husband and I through the castle and grounds.  He shared so much with us.  I don't think it would have been nearly as interesting without his information, and all the rooms may have all looked the same.  Plan on lots of narrow steep stairways.  It was only 40 more yen to add the garden to the tour, and it was incredibly beautiful and larger than we expected.  Definitely worth it."
194,So Beautiful!,"Along with Matsumoto and  Kumamoto Castle, Himeji Castle is one of Japan's three best castles, and UNESCO world heritage site (1993) The White Heron castle is a real star of cinema. The great Akira Kurosawa filmed here his Japanese interpretation of ""King Lear"" ""Ran"" and ""Kagemusha"" (Shadow warrior), received the ""Palm D`Or"" in Cannes. Sean Connery  was spying on a ninja school in ""You Only Live Twice"", the fifth in the James Bond series. White plaster covers the outside of its walls and is even used to give stability to the roof tiles. Thanks to it, the castle got its romantic name. It is built on a hill called Hime-Yama and is surrounded by a plain. Tensyukaku (main tower) is a symbol of power of the owner of the castle. 7-tier 46-meter donjon is built on the highest place and was a convenient point for observing the possible movement of the enemy in the area. The area around the main tower was the most important part of the castle and was called honmaru (main fence). Political life took place here. The living quarters were behind the 2nd and 3rd fencing. The profile of the walls of Himeji differs from European castles. They are steeply up, curving in the upper part to the outside. they are very difficult to climb-for this curvature, which is called OGI-no-kobay (slope folding fan), 7-tier 46-meter donjon However, if the enemy is already climbing the walls, the battle is almost lost. Most of the attackers must be destroyed in front of the walls. The holes in the walls are designed for this. Oblong loopholes for archers, square for muskets. This is in most castles not only in Japan, but also in other countries. The ""trick"" Himenji gardens in the form of mazes with lots of dead ends in front of the castle. Moving to the donjon, you need to loop, from time to time moving away from it, which gives the impression of movement in the wrong direction, even when you approach it. First, it is highly demoralizing, and secondly, the warriors are shot out of bows and muskets. It is the invention of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the unifier of Japan, to which the castle passed in 1581. Political measures Hideyoshi stopped internecine war and protected castle better walls and maze.  The castle of The white Heron has lost its military importance. American bombers bombed it in 1945, burned down the whole neighborhood, but the castle itself is fortunately missed. Admission is 1000 yen.The castle has  no any reservation systems, that`s why you need to stand in line. During summer and vacations it can take around 1 hour. We would be willing to stand, but Japan Rail has prepared us another, third surprise for the trip. Railways blocked, Shikansen stopped for four hours by suicide. We got to Himeji in the evening and were forced to confine ourselves to external examination."
195,Keep your expectations in check and enjoy!,It looks like a miracle. You don’t need to go inside the main building because there is almost nothing to see. Just stay in the garden around in the late afternoon and enjoy the beautiful game of lights and shadows on the white walls.
196,Yes you do need to go inside!,"I’ve been to my fair share of castles and this is the most impressive. Be sure to download the AR app, which points out details like stone drops and weapons wracks that you might not otherwise notice. The Koen garden was also definitely worth it (combined ticket) and the special view was worth the extra price and wait if you have the time"
197,Beautiful during cherry blossoms,"When talk is Japanese castles, Himeji is definitely part of that conversation and rightfully so. It is among the best preserved monuments and still a breathtaking sight from near or far. Don't expect to see fancy stuff inside, Japanese castles are not about that, but the eperience in total is very much worth the time spent here!"
198,You have to see it in person,"If you want a taste of Japanese history a visit to the castle is well worth it. Mixed with the modern buildings around Himeji Railway Station, it is a focal point. You need a good pair of shoes and plenty of water.  There are lots of steps if you want to see all the available areas.  It is up a steep slope which could prove hard with a pushchair.The long renovation has brought the castle back to its former construction.  There are plenty of information plaques in English to enable you to fully appreciate the history attached.It took us a good 2.5 hours to see everything.  It was not busy when we met but there were signs that you could have to wait in line to enter.Non-refundable lockers are available.Worthwhile buying a joint ticket for the gardens."
199,You don't really need to go inside,Don’t bother going inside if you can’t climb steep stairs especially if there are lots of tour groups going in. You will be rushed.  It is very dark inside. You also have to take off you shoes and carry them while inside. Better to just take pictures from the outside.   Very disappointing.
200,A must see !,"Star attraction for Himeji and definitely worth the effort of the day trip from Osaka. Recommended to get a combination entry ticket with the beautiful neighbouring Kokoen Garden. Entrance fees also include the entry to the inside of the castle (main keep) where you would need to remove your shoes, into a plastic bag which was provided. Staircase steps to the different levels of the castle are pretty steep and do mind your head when using the stairs from knocking against the beam. Spent around 2.5 hours here."
201, Nothing much to see on the inside,"We spent 5 nights in Himeji and had a wonderful time. The highlight of the stay was visiting Himeji Castle,as it is one of the only original castles still standing. We were given a free tour in English, which made it even better. The guide was extremely informative and even spent some time afterwards talking to us about Japanese culture. We had a great meal at the shopping center across from the castle and topped it off with some matcha ice cream. As we browsed through the souvenirs afterwards, a concerned Japanese man approached us and told us not to buy anything near the tourist attractions and pointed us to the local discount store. We absolutely love the Japanese frugality!!!"
202,Spectacular,"While visiting Kyoto, we took a day trip to Himeji via the Shinkansen(which is pricy, but at 168mph worth it and in itself an amazing experience).And you must visit if you can; this UNESCO castle, built of wood, is simply amazing.  It's perfectly located so that as you walk out of the train station, it towers over the city.  And pay the small fee-40 yen-to see the lovely garden next door."
203,Castle that could withstand Bombing,Yep... this is pretty much a MUST visit place. The imposing castle dominates the landscape and certainly worth the stomp up the hill. We managed to park by the zoo and it is lovely walk round passed the bonsai sellers to join the throng of visitors. the walk up a hundreds of steps to the top of the Main Keep is very worthwhile.... Fascinating and a pleasant way to spend an hour or so.
204,Impressive castle,"Still well worth a visit despite the title of my review. We only walked around the castle and its surrounds rather than climbing up the steps or venturing further. Radiant white on a gloomy day it demanded to have numerous photos taken of it with statues, vegetation and the red bridge sharing the limelight. While you are there, try to make time to also visit the Koko-en gardens next door."
205,Impressive building,"Loads of trains go there, and easy walk from station. Some reviewers were underwhelmed with the interior as it is pretty empty, but the woodwork is pretty amazing. Wasn't that crowded when we went. Worth it +++"
206,One of the top attractions,We were in beautiful Kyoto but the crowd!!  Looking for a breather we made an impromptu decision to go to Himeji. A wide boulevard led one's eyes to the Castle sitting on a low hill towering above the city.  A white castle!  The open castle ground is such a pleasant break from the crowd-everywhere Kyoto.  We caught an English guided tour and were treated with colourful descriptions of the history and design of the wooden castle that was built around two massive wooden columns.  We got to climb the six levels and were rewarded with a beautiful panoramic view.  The air is fresh and view is clear.  the rest of the city is similarly delightful.  The Ko-ko-En garden has one of the most beautiful fall colours.  Certainly the antidote for the crowd-affected tourist.
207,"Nice castle, looks lovely from the outside","First off, this is an excellent castle and well worth a time. Book an English-speaking guide for the castle (they are free of charge but small gifts are appreciated) to get the most out of it. These tours take about 3 hours, and the guides will be able to tell you things about the castle you won't be able to find by just looking around.Some reviewers that say you don't need to go inside - I disagree completely. I imagine the reason many say that is because they expect to see a museum full of exhibits inside. Go inside Himeji Castle and you'll see very few. Keep in mind this an original castle (one of 12 left in the country), and not a reproduction. The castle is intended to be preserved in the same state as it was back in the 1500s, so you get an idea of how the castle looked and functioned in those times. If your intention is to see a castle with lots of exhibits inside, then this is not the castle for you. However, if you want to see one of the best examples of a Japanese castle complex, then this *is* the castle for you."
208,Cherry blossom fever at 700-year old castle,"Prepare to walk up a lot of stairs! My grandma (55 Years) mother (37), older brother (24) wife and I all enjoyed this castle. Parking you have to pay and castle is a little expensive I think but good experience. A lot of history behind the castle."
209,Masses of people but worth it!,"I won't say much about this magnificent castle, except that visiting it is a dream come true to any fan of Japanese history or castles in general. But I would like to say that choosing a guided tour of the premises with one of fthe English speaking guides adds very much to the experience and will lead to even more admiration of the defensive logic of its design. We were offered a tour by Hidekazu Fujioka san who is a native of the city, a mild mannered gentleman with humor and very good of English. He asked us how much time we had and whether we wanted the short tour. Upon answering that we had nothing to do for the rest of today, he took us on a tour that lasted somewhere between 3 and 3.5 hours, explaining to us the almost unending series of ambush locations, deceitful desing, ingenius obstacles etc, that were supposed to stop an overwhelming attacking force (though the castle was never beseiged or assaulted). The more he told the more the castle came to life for us. Otherwise we would simply have walked around shaking our heads mumbling 'nice walls, nice gates, nice pathways, nice stairs, nice towers' without realizing the unseen dangers that lurked behind many of its features. Do not forget to visit the well of Okiku and learn about the legend of a poor girl whose life fell victim to a plate and then turned to an angry spirit.Thank you Fujioka san!"
210,Prettiest Castle in Japan,"We visited Himeji (White Heron) Castle by train from Osaka, choosing to go from there on our trip to Japan purely because it was closer than Kyoto and we travelled independently instead of booking a tour because it was so easy using Japan’s excellent transport system and gave us the freedom to go early before the bulk of the castle’s daily visitors arrived, timing it so that we had about 20 minutes to wait unti, it opened. On arrival at JR Himeji station head straight out of the main entrance and take the good walk straight up Otemae Dori and as you get to the last stretch the Castle comes into clear view. Then when you reach the T junction at the top, cross over heading diagonally to your left to enter the park and ignoring the zoo on your right follow the curving road around to the left up to the castle entrance.If you get there early to avoid the crowds I would suggest you forego a guide for the visit because that will leave you with growing numbers filling your photos. For the same reason it’s probably bette to do as we did and head straight to the top of the Dai-tenshu or main keep first, the route being pretty obvious once you are in and gradually following steps up and around to the right initially. The interiors is on 6 floors (a 7th is below ground and we didn’t see any access to it) and the route is via a series of steep wooden steps. There is little to see on each floor and the interiors is unfurnished and undecorated though there are occasional displays of roof tiles and  text detailing the castle’s history. The weapon racks on the walls along the way also remind that this was a defensive structure and not merely for display, it was a military and political centre in it’s day. Take time too to enjoy the views outside as you ascend and to admire the structure itself as you get to stare out across 5e rooftops and over to the Nishi-no-Maru Bailey from where you will be able to look back and capture some photos of the keep hopefully with cherry blossom in shot. To admire the sheer bulk of the keep you can stand too directly below it in the large open space that is the Bizen-Maru bailey. The square San-goku-bori moat and outer buildings give plenty more to see on leaving the keep and once outside the castle heading back out to the road and turning right will bring you to Koko-en gardens which are well worth a visit and where you can enjoy a Japanese tea ceremony.We enjoyed our visit and owing the castle is original and not wholly reconstructed as so many were following WWII or subsequent fires only added to the sense of history. In summary then we found it really useful to visit independently by train instead of booking a tour, visited early to arrive shortly before the opening time. We also self guided and headed directly to the big point of the main keep, ahead of the growing number of visitors and avoiding queuing for the stairs while getting photos largely empty of other visitors. If you have any mobility problems though be aware that the stairs are steep and it’s a long way up to the top with the stairs narrowing as you go.Hope you enjoy your visit as much as we enjoyed ours."
211,2019 Spring has come Himeji Castle,"We managed to time our trip so we arrived at peak cherry blossom. There's nothing quite like it. Crowds were manageable (visited castle Sunday afternoon and grounds again Monday morning), the sight of the white and gray castle with the cherry blossoms is a once in a lifetime experience. The throngs of tourists, local and foreign added to the experience. Seeing old friends sitting on a park bench sharing a box of chocolates, beers, and bento boxes (depending on the bench bench) under the ephemeral haze of cherry blossoms a poignant reminder of what it means to be alive. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and departed Monday morning from Himeji. Really worth an overnight stay with plenty of good restaurants + Kokoen garden."
212,great,What a magnificent piece of Japanese life centuries ago.  We made use of the free english speaking guides.  There is a local volunteer society that has folks stand at the entrance with signs.  Just walked to them and one of the ladies took us around for the whole nine.  We spent 3 hrs with her.  It's a can't miss stop.
213,Himeji Castle,If you're thinking that visiting this castle will give you an insight into Japanese warrior living/artifacts then you will be disappointed. Visiting Japan's largest castle is more about seeing how the castle was structured and built. The interior woodwork is amazing for its beam sizes and how they are connected and massive floorboards. Be prepared for some narrow and steep stairways and slow queues especially as you near the top level. The views from the top especially of the tilework is interesting. You can see a replica of the 'tiger-headed fish (sachi) along the main street in front of the castle leading to Himeji station. I recommend getting the combined castle and garden ticket as the garden next door is well worth a visit. Be sure to allow at least 2 hours or better still 3 hours for the combined visit as the crowd in the castle can move very slowly.
214,Great views and amazing inside,"We visited Himeji Castle on our way back to Osaka, from an overnight stay in Hiroshima-Mijajima (Note: we bought the JR Kansai West Pass good for 5 days).We left Hiroshima about 9:00 am, took the Shinkansen train, and alighted at Himeji JR station. We stored our carry-on luggage at the station lockers, and opted to walk to Himeji Castle for about 15-20 mins, while passing by some nice shops (and flower planters) along the way. The Castle can be seen from the rail station.The approach to Himeji Castle is very scenic--with lots of picture-taking opportunities, with the rickshaw. The walk through the small bridge was delightful, and some cherry blossoms were still in bloom in the Castle grounds.From the grounds to the Castle requires a bit of walking, and climbing/navigating the 6 floors (7 including the basement) of the Castle can be a challenge--but is doable. The stairs are narrow, and steep, but visitors can opt to return to the ground floor upon reaching a particular floor.The views from inside Castle is lovely--of the castle grounds and the Himeji area. The inside of the Castle is mostly bare, except for small shrines; however of great interest is the all-wood structure and architecture of the Castle. Upon reaching the 6th floor, there is some sort of monitor which indicates that you have reached the top of the Castle. There are also shops where to buy drinks/snacks and souvenir items within the Castle grounds.On existing the Castle grounds, visitors can take a bus/trolley which goes around the Himeji area--on the way to the Himeji JR rail station. Visitors can alight at some nearby places of interests, such as the Botanical Garden. It was a wonderful day in Spring at Himeji, although we missed the full bloom of the cherry blossoms. Plan for about 3-4 hours for the visit."
215,Excellent tour of historical castle,"This world heritage site is a must if you are in the area, less than hour from Osaka with the Shinkansen and within walking distance from station.Besides the magnificent castle the grounds are great and there is a zoo as well"
216,My Favorite Castle in Japan,I had been worried by the horror stories of long lines but I visited just prior to the cherry blossom season and first thing on a Monday morning. It was very quiet.I was amongst the first visitors to the main keep and had plenty of time to enjoy the surrroundings and take pictures.
217,Truly a Japanese national treasure,"If you are visiting Himeji castle you must join the english speaking tour in order to get the most out of your visit. The tour is 1h 45min and I thought maybe that would be too long but it was so interesting that I enjoyed the entire tour. The guide pointed out so many things we would have otherwise not noticed or even understood what it was. We thought there would have also been a residence building, but these have been destroyed, only the military building itself remains. It was therefore not what I expected but it was a fantastic experience."
218,Plan your visit time to avoid crowds,"Visited here with a tour group from Inspiring Vacations Australia and it was well worth the visit.  This castle is said to evoke the wings of a heron taking flight, hence the popular name 'Shirasagi-jo' meaning White Heron Castle.  A truly spectacular structure with steep approach and steep steps within.  For less agile people there is no need to go all the way to the top but try to at least reach the first couple of levels to admire the construction and view from within."
219,Arrived just as it was opening and got round it promptly,"Best view is by far from outside, once inside you are in a permanent queue being managed around- far too overcrowded to an extent that made it unpleasant"
220,wonderful from the outside,"This well-preserved and well maintained castle give visitors a visual and visceral experience. Those with mobile device can access the AR technology to learn more about the castle but I find the posters more than adequate to inform the learners. Clearly posted directions meant crowds are kept moving and as alluded to in other reviews, be prepared to carry your footwear and climb steep stairs."
221,Queue Land,"Terrible queues, snaking line in cold for 1.5 hours, no info how long it would take to enter. Spoilt visit."
222,Worth the visit just for the view,"I get how people are frustrated about the lineup durinf peak season, but really? to expect a true old wood based castle to fill stuff?! Some of you are spoiled by the stone-built European castles that you can't understand how hard it is build and maintain the castle using traditional way! Osaka castle is like no history at all compared to Himeji castle.   You are supposed to step on the floors in the castles to imagine what was inside and what people were doing using the stuff/stairs/small windows.   This is a castle with true spirit, unlike Osaka castle which only told the story of 丰成秀吉 without much link to the castle itself.   Pay some respect to the culture and stop for a while for the instruction they had a lot of places."
223,Get a guide,"Stopped by as suggested by our travel agents to view this historic castle whilst travelling between Hakone  and Hiroshima and we were definitely not disappointed. This is a magnificent edifice set within lovely grounds and ""guarded"" by a big moat. There is much history to this impressive castle but, sadly, our visit was limited to the outside walkways as there was no English speaking guide on the Saturday afternoon of our visit  - not sure is this was unfortunate timing or the norm.However, it was a super attraction to see on a fine afternoon."
224,Most beautiful castle in Japan,The castle provides a window back in time and is a popular place to visit. Be prepared to climb pathways and reasonably steep stairs inside the castle (carrying your shoes - slippers are provided). Great views from the top and you get a good appreciation of the engineering/construction necessary to build it.Buy the combination ticket for the gardens (300 mtrs away) as they are definitely also worth a visit with great examples of water features and detailed layout.Castle is about 1km walk up the main street from the Himeji Station or a short taxi ride.
225,Magnificent castle,It was such a great choice to take a day trip from Kyoto to go here. The combined ticket with Harden is only 50 yen more. Very much worth it!
226,Japan's best castle perhaps,"We took the train from Osaka, which took us about 50 minutes. It might seem long, but it's actually just a few stops since the train skips local train stations. The train ride was lovely as it took the coastal route. The castle is about max 10 minutes walking from the Himeji station. We actually thought we would have to hike a lot, but you literally just walk through the main street from the station to get there. Upon entering the castle gates, there is a big courtyard with cherry blossom trees on the side. From here you get a good view of the castle already. We had a baby stroller with us, which we were not allowed to take in the castle. We had to leave this behind the ticket office,  where they have a designated are for strollers. If you are travelling with a baby, I HIGHLY recommend you bringing a carrier. We went to see the main keep, where we had to take our shoes off. We were handed slippers by the staff, however these were not really convenient to walk with on a properly waxed wooden floor and stairs. It got quite slippery, so at some point I took mine off. The stairs are very steep and narrow. Walking up with a baby in the carrier was quite a challenge as it got steeper and more narrow the more you ascend.Inside there is not much in terms of interior, that was all take out."
227,Beautiful,"Himeji Castle should be regarded as the finest surviving examplee of prototypical castle architecture in Japan.  Dated back to 1333 as a fort on top of Himeyama hill, it had then been rebuilt as a castle in 1346 and registered as an UNESCo World Heritage site in 1993. It was best known for its external white color.  Many tourists came here during spring and autumn period.   Occasionally there were night functions with illuminations around.  Highly recommended."
228,Amazing and well maintenance,"My best friend and I (both 21) flew alone to japan recently, and one of the best tourist experience we’ve had was at himeji castle. We didn’t plan on going on a guided tour, but walking in a nice man called Hidekazu (hide) Fujisoka Offered to give us a free two-hours tour of the place, in English. He asked for nothing in return, 100% volunteer work, and gave us the most interesting tour of the place possible. Honestly it was such a great experience, I saw the place in a completely different (much more interesting even!) light once I knew about the history behind the castle and the way it was built. Hide sensei was the sweetest guy as well!If you plan on visiting, I have to recommend finding  him at the entrance! Honestly, he made our day. I don’t know how exactly to contact him beforehand, but I added his business card to this review. Can’t recommend enough, truly."
229,Nice Castle,"We visited early afternoon on a Sunday with the blossom just starting – this has to be the worst possible combination for numbers of people and queues.  I believe they allow 15,000 people to visit the Castle per day and we must have seen all of that. We queued for ½ hour plus to get in and then it took a further hour to get up to the top.  Too many people from a health and safety perspective and borderline more than I was comfortable with. In the event of an issue it would be very difficult to clear the building quickly as there are only two very narrow staircases, up and down and a lot of elderly people visit. There are a lot of steep stairs, be warned. You have to remove your shoes on entry and the floors were cold; you may wish to wear two pairs of socks!  All said, it is a spectacular building and the visit was well worth it.  Just plan your visit time sensibly."
230,Excellent!,Took a day off from rugby to visit this magnificent UNESCO World Heritage site. We came from Osaka so about an hour on a rapid train. From the station exit the castle can be seen and a gentle flat walk takes you to the castle.The signage and interpretation boards are well organised and well written. Do go to the top of the castle though watch your head in many places going up and coming down. Plenty of rest rooms along the way. Luggage lockers just past the entrance.This is a site not to be missed. Get a combined ticket for castle and garden and chill in the splendour of serene gardens.
231,Breathtaking building,This is a wonderfully maintained wooden structure and gives a great appreciation of the period construction.  On the tour they have a video of the renovation that was recently done which follow the original methods.  The defense strategy of continuously turn attackers sideways to make them more vulnerable to the defenses is fascinating.  The castle is about 1 hour from Kobe on the JR rapid express and is only a 10 minute walk from the station.  It’s well worth the time to see.  Plan on a 2 hour tour.
232,Himeji Castle is wonderful but remember to bring comfortable shoes,"From Osaka only 40 min by speed train,from station 20 min.by walk, castle and garden close to castle are beautiful."
233,Wonderful place - even in the rain,There is so much to see at this beautiful place. We were told it would take about three hours to walk around the castle but it took us nearly a whole day.
234,Incredible,"My fifth visit to Himeji-jo, first in many years - the queuing was made palatable by the wealth of information our lovely volunteer guide gave us as we went up the numerous flights of stairs/ladders. He was awesome - and loves the castle and its many details - as well as its historical context (and loved imparting that knowledge).  A really memorable visit complete with cherry blossoms - great view of the castle from the top of a building called I-gure Himeji - there is a viewing deck if you go to the rooftop."
235,Lots of steep steps,"Visited here during the cherry blossom season so the area was filled with colorful trees dotting the landscape.  It was an easy train ride from Osaka to here.  With all the tourists visiting to see the cherry blossoms, it was crowded but manageable.  Bot sure I would wait in line to go up to the top of the castle as I enjoyed the view of the castle from outside more than the view from the top of the castle looking down onto the castle grounds.  Something to note if you are in a rush.  What makes this trip convenient if traveling from Osaka is that you pass Kobe along the way. We managed to hit both on the same day trip."
236,Wow,"Amazing, beautiful, spectacular…you can’t stop from taking pictures from every possible direction and angle.  After climbing to the top floor and looking around we were a little bit disappointed.  The view was nice, that’s all. The gardens and the territory around the castle are more interesting then the castle inside and the views from the top. Saying this, the Himeji Castle was one of the best sites we visited in Japan."
237,Free tour guides!,This castle is well worth the visit. It is absolutely stunning. You can also buy a ticket that includes the garden. Be prepared to go up lots of steps and also a part of it you need to go without your shoes .. so take socks or walk barefooted. Stunning views. It was very hot so take a cloth and wash it with cold water and keep it with you.
238,Visit to the Castle,"This stunning castle was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Japan. The exit from Himeji train station is clearly signposted and the castle is visible as soon as you leave the station, taking about 10-15 minutes to walk along a straight road (which itself has some interesting sculptures as well as shops en route). The interior of the castle is basically empty and relatively plain, but the exterior is stunningly beautiful and incredibly photogenic - you will be able to get some lovely shots from all sorts of angles as you go round the tour route. Take time to savour the detailing on the roofs, windows etc and enjoy the various views as well."
239,White Castle and elegant castle,"We stopped here on the way from Hiroshima to Kyoto, we left our luggage at the coin locker at the station - we went early so there were a lot of lockers available. The castle was only 15 mins walk from Himeji Station. WHEELCHAIRS / PRAMS - No accessible into the castle, you will have to leave them at the entrance, and a lot of stairs to the top of castle so I will not recommend for who has difficulty walking. *** ALLOW 2 HOURS HERE AT LEAST. ***広島から京都に行くまでの途中で寄りました。JRパスを持っていたので料金のことも考えることなかったです。荷物とベビーカーを駅のコインロッカーに預けました。大きいスーツケースが入るロッカーは７００円、小さいスーツケースとベビーカーが入る大きさでしたーラッキー。城内はきれいに保管されて、当時の達筆なども残されていて、400年も経っているのにとても身近に感じました。不思議な感覚。ちなみにベビーカーと車いすは城内に入れず、コインロッカーに預けていったほうがおすすめです。"
240,Unique in the world,"We visited Himeji Castle as part of our 12-day tour with Gem Japan Tours (highly recommended!).  It is a magnificent structure, and the grounds are beautiful.  We were fortunate to visit in late May, after the cherry blossoms had fallen, and so we didn't have to face large crowds.  We didn't think to supply ourselves with water before we began the climb up to and through the castle, and our energy began to flag the higher we climbed.  However, we caught a lot of nice, refreshing breezes, and the views were tremendous from high in the castle.  If you go, do yourself a favor and grab a water bottle from the concession before you start your tour.  Our Gem Japan Tour guide escorted us around and through Himeji Castle, relating a lot of history and legend as well as information about the engineering and construction of the castle.  Although the castle is empty of furnishings, there is still plenty to enjoy in my opinion.  I enjoyed climbing the steep stairs, and I especially enjoyed watching very elderly Japanese tourists climb the stairs with relative ease.  If it is high tourist season, I might not enjoy the visit so much with large crowds.  There is a shrine on the top floor of the castle, and a lot of visitors linger there to make offerings and to pray, which creates a logjam that results in people being stuck on the stairs between floors.  There doesn't seem to be an obvious escape route from this one-way tour of the castle, so once you've entered you are committed to the end, and heavy crowding could cause some people some discomfort, anxiety, or frustration.  Know yourself and your physical and mental limits, and take a reading of the crowd size before you commit to entering the castle."
241,Awe-Inspiring,"Despite trying everything from connecting to castle wifi, changing region to Japan, and a local SIM card, our entire group was unable to download the App. Very disappointed"
242,History at large!,I showed up to Himeji Castle after a short bus ride from the train station just as it started to rain. This castle has major curb appeal and is impressive even from the street. No way was I going to let a little rain detour me. The gardens inside this castle are immaculate. It is definitely worth a visit.
243,Spectacular,"I was on vacation in Japan with my wife and we were in Osaka.I saw information about Himeji online and decided to take the hour long train ride to go see it.The castle was probably the most amazing site I got to see during my two week visit to Japan.  Definitely worth  the one hour train ride from Osaka.Hint:  If you're coming from either Osaka or Kyoto and you're not Japanese, buy the one day ""JR West Kansai Wide Pass"" to get here.  You will need to bring your passport to the JR Ticket office to buy it in order to prove that you're a foreigner."
244,Samurai spirits must still be roaming in this castle,"This was the second tour with Narawalk we did.They were incredibly accommodating in booking this tour,and fortunate to get Motoko as a guide-( we booked this at the last minute)She was well informed on the history of the stunning Himeji Castle :And once again we enjoyed our tour immensely.We travelled by rapid train from Osaka.Conserving energy until arrival at the castle.which appearing white and majestic is like the stuff of fairytales....We climbed the seven floors of the castle- whilst Motoko enlightened us on samurai history and hierarchy and the building techniques employed in the castle. We then descended the seven floors( no elevators)....not for the faint hearted 😊And enjoyed the adjacent gardens with a wonderful tea ceremony as a conclusion.Motoko was good company and well informed.I would highly recommend this tour,Thank you!"
245,Earns its World Heritage designation,"We did a day trip from Kyoto on the shinkansen which is easily achieved. When you step off the train you get the first view of the castle in the distance and it just gets better. Most of the castle is accessible, and we went right to the top. Amazing the white paster against the clear sky. It's also worth visiting neighbouring gardens, which are well cared for.Not much else in the town we found of interest, but worth the trip to experience the castle. Must do!"
246,Super cool and old castle,"Unreal to look at this structure in person, so much history behind it I do recommend having a quick read online before going! Get the duel ticket for 1040 yen for the koko-en gardens entry (only 40 yen more)! Only takes about 90 mins for the castle! To get up the 6 levels in the castle you do need to be able to do steep steps"
247,Majestic ,"I had gone to Aioi on a business trip , when my Japanese friend recommended we take a local train from Aioi and travel to  Himeji station to see the castle , which we did.Travelling from Fukuoka , the fastest way would be to take a Shinkansen train to Aioi  and then a 20 mins ride on a local train from Aioi to  Himeji .Add  another  15 mins walk from the station , and you are  at the most stunning white colored castle you would ever see. ( As a matter of fact , you can see the castle in  the distance , the moment you step out of the station ) .Unfortunately , we couldnt go inside the  castle ( it opens at 9 :am ) and there was a whole lot of cleaning and maintenance work going on .  Once you enter the main gate  and keep walking closer to the castle , the beauty unfolds even more .For kids and animal lovers ,there is a Himeji zoo  inside the compound too ."
248,Himeji Castle,"An amazing castle, I only wish I could have spent more time to take it all in. The history is amazing. Standing on Samurai alley seen in so many movies, even James Bond ""You only live twice"". The castle is also a photographers delight so many different shots, good from just about any angles, lines, light reflections etc."
249,"""White Heron"" Castle Exceeds Expectations","We took a half-day trip from Osaka, taking the shinkansen took about half an hour, to see Himeji Castle.  We also took a taxi to and from the castle as it saved us time waiting for the bus and since there were four of us, it would've cost about the same as taking the bus.  When you get to the rail station, you can see the castle in the distance and when you finally get beyond the castle walls, what a sight!  It took a bit of walking to get to the castle itself and then many steep stairs to climb within the castle itself.  Like a prior review said, there isn't much to see inside the castle itself but what there is to see is very interesting, like where they stored the weapons and also the trap doors.  And of course, there are great views of the city below.  It was fun walking up and down the stairs, although someone with bad knees might not enjoy it.  This is in contrast to Osaka Castle, where you take an elevator up, then walk back down through the exhibits.  After we got out of the castle, we took many more photos of the exterior of the castle, then back to the rail station, and a quick trip back to Osaka."
250,A White Castle away from the crowd,"This was my first time to visit a Japanese castle and I can say that I was very impressed. Even from afar, you can see how majestic it was.From the train station, there's a long walk to reach the castle (maybe 20 min). I could not calculate much because we made a lot of stops to take photos before reaching the castle's complex.It is highly recommended to buy ticket to enter the castle. There's a ticketing machine and a ticket counter as well.When you reach the main gate of the castle, don't forget to get the brochure where you can select from variety of languages. The castle's complex has very good defensive systems in its design and architecture including its several layers of moats.It's required that you remove your shoes/slippers/sandals to explore the interior of the castle. You either go barefoot or with socks. The stairs to go up were quite steep and extra caution was needed to ascend.From the inside, you'll get to see the panoramic view of the town and the decoration of the tiled roofs.Do not get disappointed if you notice that it almost look empty and no furnishings. The beauty lies in the castle itself built with stones and woods and how it survived and restored to its glory."
251,A “must see”,"Upon researching, Tripadvisor forum users advised if one castle is to be visited it should be this one. This is one of the best on offer in Japan.Himeji Castle  known as White Heron Castle is heritage listed and has an elegant, white appearance.Don't under estimate the time required to view this property as it is huge and requires time and energy to view the property.There are many floors and rooms to explore.The Castle is quite close to the Himeji train station so either the loop bus or the public bus are great options getting there. Many of the public buses pass by."
252,Majestic Historical Japanese Castle,"The castle was truly spectacular to see, but what made the trip unforgettable was having Hidekazu guide us around. We learned so much and we are very grateful. The tour took about 2.5 hours and the time flew by. He knew so much about all the gates, and the tricks used to keep the enemies away and he knew all the good vantage points for pictures.  We loved our time here and it was all thanks to Hidekazu. I would highly recommend him as a guide, but even if he is not there, take advantage of the volunteer guides if you speak English. They are free!"
253,Beautiful Castle - Must see!,"If you're near the area - I was staying in Osaka and had a JR pass - then visiting Himeji to see the castle is necessary.The lovely gardens and surrounds, along with the building steeped in history.  You can feel and almost imagine what it would have been like living there during the ancient periods.  Stunning."
254,Majestic! Beautiful!,"Easy to find.It is possible to walk to from the railway station in 20 mins. Otherwise get the ""loop bus"". Ticket office near bus stop No.6 costs 300yen per person for allday hop on/off around the sights of Himeji.Ticket machine inside castle grounds nr entrance.Tickets.1000 yen. Castle building impressive, but not much inside? Grounds are free to walk around and good for the blossom in March/April.Great photos from outside across the street or inside the grounds.Can be busy. Lots/Lots of steps so only good for the mobile."
255,beautiful,"If you have climbing issues, this is not for you.  Instead try the gardens which are beautifully manicured and have great signage.  We did go up a ways but stopped when the steps got steep.  Everyone said the top was well worth the climb, just be cautious if you have walking issues."
256,beautyfull castle.,We visited on the first day of cherry blossom week. There were masses of people but it was all very well organised. There are over a hundred steps to the castle and then very steep and narrow staircases with the possibility of banging your head on low beams. The castle is made of wood and you have to take your shoes off and carry them in a plastic bag. Great views from top of 7 stories and interesting history of the many ways they stopped invaders. Cherry blossom in the grounds.
257,My favourite castle in japan!,We did a day trip from Osaka and arrived at the castle just before 10a.m. on a week day and this was perfect timing as it was just before it got hot and there were very few people there. We did not pay for a tour so that we could take our time and take photos. This is one of the many sites in Japan that requires you to take off your shoes when going inside the castle so I recommend wearing shoes that can be taken off easily. The castle itself is amazing and well worth the visit!We also purchased the garden ticket along with our castle entrance ticket. This was worth it. The gardens are lovely and they are a nice break from the hustle and bustle of a major city.
258,National Treasure,"An easy walk from the train station, a wonderful tour that takes you all the way to the top level of the castle.  Tons of great photography.  The grounds are large so plan on spending at least a few hours to walk the tours and the grounds."
259,Spectacular Castle,This is not what I expected when I was told we were going to a castle. This place literally feels powerful when you first see it! Immaculate grounds surround this “castle on a hill”! Download the app or use the free WiFi to listen to the audio tour e your smartphone. It’s free! Only problem it drained my phone quickly due to the GPS function. If you can make a side trip here do it!
260,Best of Japan,"Arrive very early (9am-10am) if you want to get inside this amazing castle during the cherry blossom season peaking at the moment. The stairs up into the smaller top sections are steep and since space is limited the number of people allowed to enter are controlled strictly. Regardless though the views of the castle, as well as from inside, are really something to behold. You can marvel at the technology used to build it, the sheer scale of it, the beautiful blossoming trees and when the wind comes up a bit, the shower of blossoms blowing across you. The Koko-en Garden situated beside it is worth a quick walk through as the trees are all also blossoming at the moment."
261,Could do better,"We went with Masuzu via JTB Sunrise tours.   She made all the difference on this tour.  She enthusiastically explained the historical facts and events sufrounding the building of the castle, and the events after. It was like reliving these people's stories as you went around the castle, stories which were very game of thrones-like. It took from the exhaustion of going up the steep castle.  We went to Akashi Kaikyo bridge after, which was also made interesting because of her nonstop explanations."
262,Wow,A six story  wooden structure that has been maintained and restored a few times in the past two hundred years this is a beautiful structure with most original parts intact. Be prepared to climb to the top for the views. We go to Nijo castle tomorrow so I will have a reference to compare to.
263,See the western bailey first,"We got an independent guide quite by accident. She approached us in the courtyard before we got tickets. Usually in Europe I wouldn't go for these sort of ad hoc street soliciting.This elderly lady was amazing!!! She really knew her stuff. English was on point. She did it for fun to stay occupied. And unlike guides who just recite the same thing, she could easily field my questions and deal with it.I would highly recommend getting a guide in some shape or form (even electronic). Otherwise you will kiss the real thought and beauty if the castle beyond the visually aesthetic Instagram shot."
264,Himeji castle,Go early as I did! The queues can be very long and you may have to wait before you are allowed into the main keep. Allow half a day to see all parts.
265,Gorgeous castle with huge grounds,"I had read the reviews about the queues so arrived just after 9am. Straight through and not many people in the castle and grounds. In June. Cost was 1,040 yen including the gardens. They’re located back out the gate, over the bridge and down to the right (about 3 minutes walk). The castle is basically bare inside. It has QR code scanning for information but it’s a bit limited. There are however free guide pamphlets in a variety of languages at the gate. A read up on the internet is recommended before you go."
266,Beautiful castle ,As soon as you exit the train station it is in front of you looking more majestic the closer you get. An easy walk to the castle via the Main Street or the arcade to the right of the station
267,Epic even in the rain,Fascinating original Japanese castle. Sympathetically restored a few years ago. Quite a climb up the inside but definitely worthwhile. Extensive grounds and it’s also worth going to the gardens next door
268,just stunning,"We decided to stop here on the way to Kyoto from Hiroshima and I am very glad we did.  We traveled on the early morning bullet train to ensure we secured an entry ticket (limited numbers are sold).  We left our luggage at the train station and walked to the castle (approx 1km).   It is a magical castle straight out of a fairy tale book.  The inside quarters of the castle was very cramped with tourists but still impressive to see.  We visited in cherry blossom season, so the gardens were beautiful."
269,THE Japanese castle,"One of the highlights of our trip to Japan. The architecture and the vastness of work that was done to hold this building up is just incomprehensible. I would highly recommend following with a guide through the maze of floors and rooms as they can tell you what each floor and room were used for and their survival mechanisms from within. I would highly recommend this to be families with teenagers and leave grandparents at the base unless they are very fit. There are so many steps. I had 15,000 steps that day and most were going up and down very small and narrow staircases. Do not let this discourage you as I'm in my 50's and not in the best of shape. The love of old buildings, architecture and history made every step and stair worth it."
270,Architecture from the inside is amazing!,We didn't bother paying to go in. Just walking around outside and admiring the castle from the grounds was enough.Like the Taj Mahal (which I have visited at least 3 times if not 4) just sit and gaze from afar. It's much more enjoyable that way.
271,Wonderful Castle,"It is really beautiful and highly recommend picking up at least the guide pamphlet on the way in to understand its rich history. Tickets to the castle and the adjourning ko-koen garden can be bought at the ticket booth, while tickets to the castle only can be bought at the ticketing machine."
272,One of the most spectacular things we saw in Japan,This was a bookend to our trip to Japan. I recommend going in the off season like we did. I'm sure this place is a madhouse during  peak season. We went in December is was cool but manageable. With all the walking we kept our core temperature up.
273,Impressive from the outside,I read many reviews commenting on the inside & lack of interest & they were right.However the outside is stunning and worth a visit. Don't miss the nearby gardens which are only 40 yen extra on a joint ticket
274,Brilliant castle experience,We did a day trip from Kyoto. Arrived at the train station about 11:45 and left at 16:00.It was just about enough time to see the castle and neighbouring garden and have lunch in the restaurant in the garden. We had no time to look at the shops.The castle is entirely made of wood and smells lovely inside. There is supposed to be a English guide but there was not on the day we went. There is a guided tour that runs on your smartphone with the internet but we did not bring out headphones so couldn't do it.
275,"Amazing, must visit","Himeji is definitely a great stop if you are traveling through on the Shinkansen from Hiroshima to Kyoto.  The train station has lockers in which you can store your luggage and it's easy to walk around the city and up to the castle (or you can grab a cab).  The castle is probably one of the more impressive pieces of architecture in Japan, although the tour inside is not so worth it.  Seeing the outside and then taking in the neighboring garden would have been sufficient for us."
276,Absolutely stunning,"This is a must-visit if you're a castle/Japanese history enthusiast. It is very easy to get to by a quick shikansen ride from Osaka or Kyoto, which makes it a great day trip option. From the shinkansen station you can walk, take a short bus or taxi ride to the castle entrance. The main keep itself as many have said, is empty. This is unlike Osaka castle which is totally concrete and modern on the inside. This can be a boring for some, but as history buffs this is great. We enjoyed learning about the architecture and seeing the preserved interiors, from the original pillars to the various trapdoors, weapon racks and other defensive structures. It was meant to be a defensive stronghold and not a palace, so you will not see fancy furnishings here. The stairs inside the keep can be difficult as they are very steep. There are handrails but it can be a challenge even for able-bodied folk as you need to remove your shoes, and socks are slippery on the wooden floors. Go slowly and watch your head if you are tall.The rest of the grounds are huge and would be gorgeous during cherry blossom season. Overall a gorgeous place to visit and an iconic sight of Japan in my view."
277,The best castle in Japan!,"You can't help but be impressed with this amazing castle, just a short 30 minute walk from the train station. Once you get inside, however, it's pretty barren. No furniture, very few displays. On one floor there are some weapons racks, but no weapons. Just an endless cycle of stairs until you get to the top floor where everybody congregates for the best views. I get the minimalism of Japanese aesthetics, but this takes it a bit far. Still, one can't help but be impressed with the structure. The website is very helpful in pointing out which days will be crowded or not. That might be useful on holidays because there's a limit to how many people they allow inside."
278,"Grounds are great, castle is fairly dull","We saw about 6 castles and this is tops.  Be sure to get a volunteer guide to get the important insights.  Expect to take at least 2 hours.  They totally dismantled and rebuilt the main tower 5 years ago.  15,000 workers involved at cost of 2.4 billion yen.  They weighed everything and total weight of keep is 5700 tons!We took train from Kobe port from cruise ship.  Once you get to Kobe station, JR train goes to Himeji every 30 minutes as does the return train- about $35 for two people round trip.  Don’t worry about bullet trains unless you have a longer trip planned.Not to be missed!"
279,Take the English guided tour ,"We called here en route from Hiroshima to Kyoto leaving our bags at Himeji station. Arrangements here were very good, plenty of locker capacity in three different sizes. The largest is 700 yen per day taking 100 yen coins but there is a change machine which changes 1000 yen notes. The walk from the station is easy and straight forward and takes 15 to 20 minutes, you can see the castle when you exit the station.Himeji castle has been painstakingly restored to its original glory in a series of restoration projects over many years. The end result is beautiful, every bit as good as the photos you will see.Entry is 1000 yen for the castle itself but you can get a joint ticket including the gardens for another 40 yen and this is worth the time. Once inside the castle grounds important to note that no food or drink is allowed. We spent around 3 hours in the castle itself but this includes a walk to the ‘West Bailey’ area to the right as you exit where there is entry to rooms housing an exhibition on the life of one of its occupants Princess Sen, the re-development of the castle and some of the techniques used in restoring the buildings to their original state, there are English language explanations in the museum. The main castle can be toured in a couple of hours. There are English language tours at 10am and 1pm daily but as we arrived outside these hours we simply opted for a self guided walk. There is a set route around the castle and good English language explanations on each of the seven floors in the keep. Shoes have to be taken off on entry so remember to bring socks.The gardens were a delight, they are around a 7/10 minute walk from the castle approach turning right once you reach the moat. There are thirteen separate gardens and the first one as you arrive at is absolutely stunning. We spent well over an hour here.A very worthwhile side trip."
280,Cool but painful,"Must try and include a visit to Himeji Castle during your visit, especially during cherry blossom as there are so many of them you can’t help but get great photos. Don’t skip the long corridor in the west bailey as this offers a lot more historical insight. Steep but short stairs in the castle, that should be doable by most. Like most sights at this time of year (or maybe always?) arrive early for a less crowded experience. We got there at 9:30, even from Kyoto. Expect to spend closer to 3 hours to get the full experience of the castle without rushing. No need to stay in Himeji. It is an easy day trip from either Kyoto or Osaka, on the Shinkansen, and a short walk straight up the main street from the station. As a bonus, spend the extra 40 yen and include the Koko-En gardens. Well worth it, some of the nicest gardens we have seen."
281,We stayed overnight to also see the castle lit up at night! ,"Less than 1 hour Shinkansen train ride from Hiroshima to Himeji station. There are clear signs which exit to reach Himeji castle. Once you are at the right exit,  u can see the castle from the train station. There are shops along the way to the castle."
282,Worth the visit,I recommend you get one of the free volunteer guides to take you on a tour of Himeji castle. We found a guide at the entry gate. This is a beautiful castle with an amazing history and design. Without a guide I would have probably walked away thinking it was just lots of wood and plaster.Himeji is a nice modern city and the castle is an easy walk from Himeji train station.
283,Himeji castle is so beautiful that I never get tired of seeing it.,"When approaching the castle grounds from across the street, I could tell that this day would be special. I could clearly see the castle in the distance and it was a beautiful sight to see. We paid the admission fee of 1000y each and began our slow walk up to the castle. I was amazed by the intricate layout of the walkways and gates. They seemed to crisscross each other and was definitely meant to confuse anyone trying to gain entry to the main building. First you are walking in one direction and then you are walking in another direction without knowledge of how you got to where you are. Truly brilliant!Once inside the main building, the rooms were cramped, dark and barren. Each floor had a stair up to the next level. As you ascended the stairs, the slope of the stairs got steeper and the stair treads and risers got smaller. Whoever had to launch and attack on the upper floors, they had to be very nimble and have small feet. I made it to the top floor, but I had to use the railings on the last three levels.The view from the top floor is terrific. You can look down Otemae Street from the top floor and see Himeji Station in the distance.The tour route leads you into an outdoor courtyard where you can look out over the grounds and the city. It was a nice spot to look at the beautiful high walls and the castle.As a person with a construction background, I was totally blown away by the walls of the castle and how they were constructed without any mortar or binding agents. The small rock shims were really cool. Whoever designed this building really had their head screwed on straight back then. I could not imagine building this without a computer."
284,Wasn't what I hoped it would be,"This was the most disappointing part of my entire trip to Japan. I think it had just been re-opened after a refurb but hardly any of it is original. The crowds are manic (I went in November).When you enter the castle itself it is just empty wooden rooms. Not sparsely decorated or only a few bits to look at.. it’s literally empty. So you go in and join a huge queue (about 5-6 wide) and walk extremely slowly, with many stoppages) up some stairs into more empty rooms. Then down again and out. The grounds themselves are a little bit better and have that wonderful and quintessential Japanese feel and wonderful finish but there’s nothing really to see. And I like going to temples and these kinds of places!Really disappointing."
285,Grand watchtower ,"I took about three hours visiting but could have spent more time here with better preparation, fatigue set in from the volume of information I was trying to cram in. A word of warning - much as I expect, and respect, the necessity to remove outdoor footwear and Don slippers I was not prepared for the difficulty of climbing narrow and steep stairways whilst not comfortably shod, if you have some of those socks with non-slip soles in you luggage this could be the place to wear them."
286,"Stunning beauty, fascinating history","First, one could venture in cluelessly up the ramp and stairs through the empty halls up to the top. Second, one could hire an expensive guide (rates I saw were ~$100 per tour). Third - which I highly recommend - is to accept the free tour offer from the ladies of the Historical Society, just behind the ticket counter. I was slightly skeptical at first but my guide, Ms. Nagata, turned out to be phenomenally knowledgeable. There are so many - infinite - interesting subtleties about the history, architecture, political-social-military behind the castle to be appreciated. I suspect that an enthusiast who lives in the area and grew up around the castle has so much more offer than a guide for hire. So, I recommend it. The castle was built in 8 years but housed a succession of daimyos from the Tokugawa clan who used it to control the restive masses far down south from Edo. From the military perspective the attention to detail in the design is nothing if not brilliant. Worth a visit."
287,Beautiful castle,"Let me tell you...we went here thinking this would be a better option to the million or so tourist infested venues in Kyoto.  We weren't wrong.   At first I was put off by a review by someone going on about nothing being within the castle and just a lot of walking and climbing steep stairs while wearing ill-fitting slippers.Let me tell you.  We ventured forth thinking we didn't want to spend the money on the actual visit inside and I took a leap of faith knowing we probably won't be back in our lifetime.  We were both glad we did.   There is a wealth of information within the castle and most exhibits are in Japanese as well as English.  In addition, they have kept the grounds and castle as historically correct as possible.  So yes, there are a lot of steep stairs and long hallways of gorgeous wood.  If you spend time here you will see the awesome workmanship and the continued restoration of this relic that has been around longer than many other countries have even been alive!  This place is awesome.  I wish I knew more about Japanese history to truly be enveloped by the stories, but unfortunately I know very little.  Even so, you get the idea of what happened here and how it happened. Mind you the museum at the end of the castle was closed and will be closed until April 2020 there was still a wealth of information.  Docents are very knowledgeable and even in halting English one sought me out with my daughter to show us some little known facts about the construction of the main Keep.  It was awesome and I wanted to go back and thank her again and again for such awesome knowledge sharing.  Please, please, please go here to spend an afternoon.  What we thought would be an hour or two visit to get pictures turned out to be a four hour excursion of delight!!"
288,Lots of Secrets at Himeji Castle,"Having often had to rely on an audio guide when sightseeing in japan, we where lucky to enjoy a fantastic guided tour of the castle and it's grounds. Our guide, Mihako, was very knowledgeable of the castle and it's history and answered all our questions on the day. She also offered to take our photo at various points in the tour. Definitely make the effort to get to the castle early to join the tour, it's well worth the effort."
289,Well restored and conditioned,"The last time we were in Japan, Himeji was under construction, so I wasn't going to miss it this time in all its glory. We arrived in Himeji after a brief 1-hour train ride from Kyoto Station, and the moment we exited the station, Himeji was visible. The 10-15-minute walk up the main thoroughfare to the gate gets more and more exciting and is one of those walks where you stop every few moments to take a picture, even though you know they're not great. Adult entry fee is 1000 yen and well worth it. We paid 1040 yen for entrance to the gardens next door as well. There are brochures in a number of languages and free guides, but we wanted to wander at our own pace as much as possible (I have a chronic foot injury, so I'm very cautious at these sites, especially as you must take off your shoes when inside). Additionally, Himeji has neat AR (augmented reality) spots throughout the grounds where you can scan a code and see an image and get info for various spots. We didn't do this but saw others who did. The immensity of Himeji is hard to fathom, with all of the towers, walls, auxiliary buildings, etc., but climbing up to the top gives you a great idea of how important its location was and how intimidating it must have been (and still is). Wandering the grounds is peaceful and quiet, even though there were big crowds in the main keep. I think many people must do the main keep and then let kids run around outside, which is great.All in all, Himeji was one of those travel moments that seems a dream - an icon of Japan, I never really thought I'd see it myself, and I'm so very glad I did. An excellent day trip from Kyoto, we also caught a small festival procession in one of the many shopping streets near the station.A note: while I am not anywhere near disabled, as I mentioned, I do have a foot injury but was still able to navigate Himeji well and saw many elderly people doing the same. The main keep is not accessible for those in wheelchairs, but the grounds certainly are."
290,A ‘must see’ attraction in Japan,"We had to run to get entrance tickets : 5pm is the last minute to buy tickets, then at 5.30 they close the windows and at 6pm they close the gates. Actually one hour is enough and we were lucky enough to be only a few tourists there (of course great for pics). You have to take off your shoes, they give you a plastic bag for them. There are a lot of stairs, actually it's wooden ladders at some places. So be aware that climbing up to the 6th floor can be pretty strenuous for some people."
291,Brilliant,"A friend of ours that works in Japan recommended we stop here between Hiroshima and Osaka, so we made sure we stopped.  You can see the castle from the station and it's an easy 15 minute walk from the station to the castle.  With so many shrines and castles in Japan, I honestly think this was one of the prettiest ones we saw.  At least on the outside....  This castle is situated so beautifully.  Besides the lovely moat, stonework and gardens surrounding the castle, the castle is still the centerpiece of the town.  Inside, there really isn't anything to do other than walk the many floors of very steep stairs to the top floor.  Once at the top, the views of the town are fantastic.  We were there in the deep heat of summer, so it was very nice to stand at the windows there and take advantage of any breeze coming through.  We'd worked up quite a sweat just walking to the top.  There were very few exhibits regarding the history or architecture of the castle, which was somewhat disappointing.  Still, it was a nice short excursion to see a very fine example of Japanese architecture."
292,One of the best castles in Japan,"I visited here with a group of local friends. We arrived quite late with only an hour to look around, but it did the job.From the outside it is indeed beautiful to look up at and also looking at the rest of it from inside also provided some more unusual angles. Climbing up was definitely a trek and as someone with arthritis in both knees it was not easy. I'm very glad I did it though as the views from the top close to sunset were gorgeous.  Is it worth climbing up if your not interested in the views? Probably not as each floor was basically the same ...polished wood and steep steps.I know Himeji is considered the best castle in all of Japan, but I think there are others that grab my attention more.The castle is about 20 mins walk from JR Himeji. There are buses too."
293,Over 400 years old - magnificent!,"Each time I am anywhere near Himeji during my frequent trips to Japan, I try to at least catch a glimpse of this iconic structure, which stands high on a hill. For example, when traveling by bullet train, I find that Himeji’s elevated Shinkansen station provides a nice, but quick view of the 6-story, 150-feet-tall, main keep. When I have the time, I leave the train to spend about an hour walking around the castle’s exterior and admiring what UNESCO considers to be the finest surviving example of early 17th-century castle architecture in Japan. The main keep’s mostly empty interior no longer beckons, especially its narrow, steep stairs, but was certainly worth a look when I first went here.My most recent visit took place in October when I introduced a traveling companion to this elegant structure. It has earned a nickname of the White Heron Castle, because of its color and because some said the building resembles a bird ready for flight. Constructed of stone and wood, this castle is the largest in Japan and is certainly stark white. Its grounds contain many feudal-era buildings, with the complex, as it appears today, completed in 1609. Short on time, we opted not to pay the 1,000 ¥ (about $10 U.S.) castle admission charge. Instead we crossed the castle’s inner moat via the Sakuramon footbridge and went through the large, wooden Otemon Gate. This entry route brought us to a huge free admission area, with many photo ops, beneath the castle. Various information boards offered details in Japanese, Chinese and English. Many cherry trees stand here and their blossoms bring huge crowds to the beautiful setting.We left our luggage in lockers at the Himeji Station and walked along Otemae-dori Street for about 15 minutes to reach the castle. Miyuki Street, a covered shopping arcade that runs parallel to Otemae-dori, was our return route."
294,Most impressive castle of whole japan,Get ahead of the crowds by being there when the ticket line opens at 9 am. Be sure you’re in good physical shape to meet the challenge of ascending paths & multiple stairs within the castle. This amazing UNESCO World Heritage Site is awesome to behold.
295,Amazing venue made even better by the autumn colours,"I'm not much of a history buff, but this was a really interesting tour back to the middle ages. There are steep ladders to climb to reach the top floor of the tower as elevators weren't invented when the castle tower was erected. Very genuine, many descriptions in English. Well worth half a day by train from e.g. Osaka. Many restaurants between the train station and the castle. If you can, try to avoid weekends as it was really busy the Sunday we visited."
296,Lovely experience!,The cost of touring the castle is reduced for students. As recommended by others tour with a guide if they are available.  There are seven floors and there are no elevators. If you plan to tour this castle be prepared to climb up flights of steep stairs. The views of the city of Himeji are breathtaking from the windows and get better as you ascend. It is close to the train station..
297,Must see! ,"Interesting, I’ll admit that we didn’t take the time to read everything though. It would have been better if we had waited for the next English tour, I think."
298,Like the Taj Mahal...sit outside and gaze,"I wasn’t sure if it was worth visiting, but I can assure you that it is. Firstly there are really good photo opportunities once inside castle walls. The castle is extensive, and you really appreciate the workmanship and incredible defensive arrangements it has by visiting the main castle. Be warned there are lots of steps, and you need to take off your shoes and wear slippers, I found these difficult to climb steps in, so finished off taking them off, so wear a good pair of socks. At each level there are small signage boards describing particular aspects of castle"
299,How can anyone give this less than 5 stars?,"My brothers and I came here the day after New Year's and the place was packed as expected. It was a great day trip choice for us coming from Osaka. The exterior park grounds are nice to take a leisurely stroll in. Once we were inside the castle keep, we were impressed with how everything is meticulously maintained over the years. There are great photo opportunities around every nook and cranny and you can get amazing landscape pictures of the surrounding cityscape. I can definitely see why it was one of the first Japanese UNESCO World Heritage Sites. I'll be sure to revisit this place in the future with the rest of my family."
