0,Must See in Agra,"I had thought of missing the Baby Taj due to time as there were more things we wanted to see in Jaipur and I even said why get a burger when you could have a steak as we were seeing the Taj Mahal properly the following day. Well how wrong was I as the Tomb of Itmad-ud-daulah was absolutely fantastic, mesmorising, fascinating and full of history, architecture and intricate artwork, From the minute was walked up to it we were in absolute awe and again just pinching ourselves as it was hard to believe we were actually there. For once I was almost speechless (okay this also happened quite a few times during this part of the trip and Mrs Jock has never enjoyed such peace and quiet from me haha) just uttering the odd wow. Our guide Arif was absolutely brilliant as he gave the full history of the tomb when and why it was built as well as the background in to the Mughal dynasty. The tomb was actually built before the Taj Mahal and is what Shah Jahan based the Taj Mahal on. He also pointed out some of the intricate artwork that we wouldn't have noticed or appreciated without his input as he also told us of the techniques used in creating the artwork. Even though he will have done these tours many.many times before his passion and love for the art. architecture and history was clear as well as infectious (not that we needed much to totally hooked on the whole history and beauty of the gardens, tomb and surrounding buildings. I was also in my element as there were so many photo opportunities so I was snapping away. Just a word on people or children asking you to take their photos. If they ask you just to take their photo's they are likely after money but of they ask if they can take a photo with you (and this will be locals as well as visitors to the sites rather than travelers) then it is because they are proud that someone with our skin colour (as well as being fascinated by western culture) is visiting their country and city and want to have their photos taken standing beside us to show their friends. Once we knew this we were happy to oblige and would smile and let them stand next to us for a photo, sometimes each friend would wait to take their turn. Mrs Jock had the most requests and felt like quite the film star haha.We spent quite a while (I am not sure how long as I was too busy just enjoying and soaking it all in) walking round the gardens, buildings, looking at the river scenes behind the tomb as Arif would tell us the history as we walked or just stood and admired. He also had a good balance between informing and letting us just enjoy what we were seeing in peace whilst taking photos.We completed the full circle and reluctantly made our way to the exit although not before glancing back every so often to take yet another look. It was certainly a steak in it's own right and definitely not a burger :-)) As we approached the exit Arif phoned Michael our driver and within seconds of leaving he appeared with the car which we got in to just as sellers were trying to get us to buy their trinkets, postcards, books etc."
1,You cannot miss this monument,Had a great time with my guest it was haunar to show our culture and history to the different country people it was great time with Harry thans to gave me the great aportunity to show you the our country
2,Great architecture.,"This was our last main site visit during our tour.  I can seen why it is called the baby Taj, looks similar.  The art work is very lovely and detailed.  The gardens are more as I expected at the Taj.  Would be nice to have stayed here longer and not during the heat of the day.  Maybe better to see it near sunset."
3,The Baby Taj - it looks like a jewellery box,There are always places with culture and history that are important to visit and same goes with this monument as well.Do visit if you want to see good architecture with serne surroundings.
4,Very Nice Tomb - Beautiful Carved Marble Monument,This is one of the old place to visit and see some olden memory of the indian history. We have seen this historical place.
5,‚ÄòBaby Taj‚Äô - an equally impressive monument!,We visited the place during the day time. The place was average but we had expected something more from this place
6,Great compliment to the TM,"It is the place we must visit in early morning or in sunrise the place is also called 'baby taj ' beautiful silent place to visit ,need some entyfee to visit the place it is near to yamuna river so from back side the river seen beautiful ."
7,wonderful structure,we were lucky to be here when it was not busy... was a lovely walk around quite peaceful compared to outside the walls!
8,Amazing delicate designs,"The baby Taj was a positive surprise. We were not expecting much from it, but we were amazed by its beauty. Just include its visit when you are in Agra!"
9,Happily Surprised,We visited here during our tour of India üáÆüá≥. We did it by ourselves which was fine and have a lovely few hours just walking around the beautiful gardens and lovely views. I was was very disabled friendly which was great as my partner uses a mobility scooter and was about to get around.  Just a few things to point out if your going on your own.... be aware that unofficial people will ask you to show you around and then demand money from you!! They are nothing to do with the place and the security guards are just as bad wanted money of us for taking photos of us together and they are really persistent and don‚Äôt take no for an answer easily. Just stand your ground. Tipping  are a big thing in India for anything....
10,Tomb of Who?,Visited the place after the Tal Mahal. It felt good as more intimate and less visitors. The building is really nice.I do really recommend it for a visit.
11,Unmissable,"I really enjoyed our visit to the Baby Taj and although not of the same grandeur of the Taj Mahal,  it is an impressive building in its own right.  What's more you don't have the incessant crowds.  It has some nice gardens leading up to the monument and before entering you must either remove your shoes or purchase some shoe covers. It is situated on the bank of the river where  you are able to watch everyday  local life going on by.  Entrance should have been around 500 rupees for foreigners but we got in for free as we visited on World Heritage Day."
12,Beautiful place - The Baby Taj,"We were very surprised to see that the place was really quiet and not busy.  We may have visited it at a time when it's not a peak time.It is a very nice place.  Local people call it ""Baby Taj"" because it resembles Taj Mahal but with smaller dimensions.  There is a very nice small building near the entrance which contains a lot of informative displays regarding baby taj.  We were told that the best time to visit it is at sun rise and sun set because you can see Taj Mahal on the opposite river bank with wonderful colours."
13,Excellent,"i saw information on web , they said if at noon this place will close. but i visit there and ask people at there, then still open. so we bought ticket 200 INR/Person, if still have ticket Taj Mahal,  but u will pay more with tax if u dont have ticket taj mahal. this place not big like Taj Mahal and i think not really famous hehe. coz not much people visit here, but this place so beautiful. we can see Taj Malah from here. so if u have much time u can visit here."
14,Wonderful 'Baby Taj' without the crowds,"Beautiful place to visit, no crowds as they are all at the taj mahel. Very interesting history and worth the price to see it."
15,A fully grown up place,"A beautiful place with a gorgeous entrance gate, much quieter than the Taj of course, we visited around 4pm once the weather had cooled"
16,Sanjay Mudgal is the best way to see the Baby Taj,"One overnight stop in Agra and our guide took us to baby taj the afternoon we arrived as we were visiting Taj Mahal the following morning at sunrise.The first tomb in India built entirely of white marble, this ""jewel box"" set in beautiful gardens on the banks of the river Yamuna inspired the construction of the Taj Mahal. I love the story behind this tomb, Indian history is fascinating and I have loved researching for my Rajasthani adventure.Well worth a visit , its peaceful and very beautiful."
17,Do the trip early,"Baby taj is nice, intricate marble carvings. The place in overall looks really beautiful, a must visit place in Agra including Taj Mehal, Agra Fort"
18,A nice and comfortable stroll,"Loved visiting ‚Äúbaby Taj‚Äù because of its history and architecture. This jewel-box has four main entrances that are equally  designed, while each gate has different bottle patterns. Pretty good history behind it too."
19,baby Taj,A great visit to ‚ÄòBaby Taj‚Äô a beautiful place to see with an amazing history. Would recommend a visit here
20,"See it before Taj, ","When in Agra, you need to visit at least the Taj Mahal, the Fort and this ‚Äòbaby‚Äô Taj. Great view on the back side over the river! Shoe covers need to be bought on site, or you can walk bare foot or on your sock on the marble. More detailed decorated mausoleum compared to the Taj."
21,Bachcha Taj,The ‚ÄòBaby Taj‚Äô is gorgeous. We went here when the sun was setting and the light made the structure all the more beautiful. The intricate rock work is something to behold.
22,Baby Taj,"Went and visited the Baby Taj.  Thought this place was great and when I went, not too many crowds.  Thought this place was spectatular and nice to see it before the Taj.  Really nice place and remember to bring money for shoe covers to get inside."
23,Masterpiece,Went at the end of the day but before going to view sunset over the Taj Mahal.  Very peaceful and serene.  Late afternoon sunshine on this monument was lovely and the views over the river are great too.
24,See the Baby Taj before the Taj Mahal,"Just a short dricve away from the Taj, this Baby Taj is much quiter, has no queus and let¬¥s you enjoy the archictecture and the landscape far more undisturbed and tranquil. Of course it is way smaller and does offe much less details as well. But a good first step before you visit the big brother. Enjoy pictures on a muslim building."
25,Beautiful ,"This is my favorite monument in Agra. Visited this place to show my guests from UK bcz I run my own company ""Sachan Walking Tours"". They also liked it very much. It's a beautiful monument on the bank of Yamuna and marvelous example of pietra-dura."
26,Nice complement to the Taj Mahal,"Visited Baby Taj immediately after Grown Up Taj and was pleasantly surprised. Firstly there was hardly anyone else there which was great after the hugeness and hecticness of GUT.  Secondly it‚Äôs more colourful than GUT, really very pretty because of the use of pastel colours.  Worth a visit to see how BT influenced the design of GUT."
27,Baby Taj,This place is known as Baby Taj.It's beautiful and better when someone tells you the story about it.
28,Nice and quiet area with beautiful tomb structure,"During our holidays in Agra, I had visited this beautiful Mughal mausoleum which is also popularly known as the Baby Taj. This beautiful tomb in white marble which was built by Empress Nur Jahan(wife of Mughal Emperor Jahangir) in memory of his father is a must visit attraction after Taj Mahal, Agra Fort. The beautiful tomb is surrounded by well maintained, manicured garden criss crossed by pathways and canals(no water though) and we loved the view of the Yamuna river from the backside. We were mesmerized to see the decorations on the walls using semi precious stones inside the tomb. This place is open all days of the week from 8 am in the morning."
29,Worth a visit.,Nice place to be in with friends and family . Good place for photography with scenic view of river yamuna.
30,Nice baby Taj,"People refer to this place as ""Baby Taj"" but it¬¥s one of the 4 major attractions of the city, along with the Taj, the Red Fort and Soami Bagh Samadh. The interiors are not as well kept as the other buildings, some frescoes are chipped off, but the architecture, the inlayed marbles, the latticework are still wonderful. And it¬¥s not as crowded as her big sister."
31,Beautiful Structure,History of which I struggle to get over in a few words. Burial tombs in various rooms with such ornate mosaic walling and ceilings All just yards from the busiest of roadways. One enters via ornate archway via gardens with fountains ( they were being cleaned and not in use when we visited
32,Visit before Taj Mahal,This is a tomb so not much to see. But the building is VERY BEAUTIFUL details. Go see my instagram @stellameryl for the closer photo. You should sit in front of one of the window for closer detail photo. ALL WHITE building. My second fav visit after Taj mahal
33,Pleasant worthwhile visit,We visited the baby taj straight after the Taj Mahal and were not disappointed. There are some beautiful pieces and far fewer people. It's easy to get some great photos.
34,Well worth visiting,We were very excited to visit the Taj Mahal and to be honest did not know much about this so-called Mini Taj ‚Äì the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah. It is not that far away from the major Taj and well worth a visit to see the architecture and beautiful use of stone and inlays. We had a guide who was very helpful in explaining the history and pointing out the building‚Äôs features. Many of the family are interred within the mausoleum and the building is a mix of marble and semi-precious stones. The gardens are lovely and the whole place has a certain peace and beauty. Well worth a visit for at least an hour or so.
35,Serene and quite place,"Its very calm and beautiful place near Agra and called Baby Taj. You need to remove your shoes, slippers before entering into the Tomb.Its a hidden gem for sure in Agra, with Tajmahal taking all the highlights.Once Tajmahal visit is complete one should visit this place as well.Better to book tickets online for the Agra monuments. 7 in Total."
36,Baby Taj,Nice place it's not too much far from Red fort and Taj Mahal river scenery was fabulous it's called also baby Taj Mahal
37,Great visit at mini tajmahal,"This was well worth battling the traffic to visit. Our guide said that the tomb was one of the inspirations for the Taj Mahal and so is referred to as the 'baby Taj'. It was very peaceful walking around and almost void of tourists. Be warned though, there are plenty of monkeys on the site so don't get too close to them!"
38,"Much more than ""Baby Taj""",Not many people know about this or visit this. The approach is through old crowded area but totally worth it! We visited it in evening and there were only 2 more visitors. It was so serene and beautiful
39,Must Visit,"This is nicknamed the Baby Taj and it is well named.  We saw this site after we had visited the Taj Mahal and it is even more intricately adorned with stone carvings and stone inlays.  The nice thing was that there were very few people here, so you didn‚Äôt have to push your way through crowds.  To see the mastery of these people in carving and inlaying stone is marvelous.  This place is a must see when you are in Agra."
40,Baby Taj!,Really amazing place to see Outstanding Really bigWill visit again very soonGood Experience Thanks
41,Baby Taj Mahal,"Absolutely to visit, it takes 10 minutes in tuctuc from Agra Fort, quiet, excellent, there are a lot of monkeys."
42,Snow-white pearl,it was great and i love it personally i wish to go there as soon as possile again and again and defnitely i will visit again soon
43,Delightful site,"A lot of day trippers to Agra just do the Taj and the Fort both excellent of course, but if you can find half an hour to see slip across the Yamuna to see the Baby Taj. Not as grand, but beautiful, and especially given the lack of sightseers far more contemplative and restful. Our trip through the tiger reserves of Kanha, Pench and then on to Agra was organised by EncounterAsia. The service was impeccable throughout, even picking us up for the transfer from the airport hotel and guiding us through. However best of all were the guides.  A guide can really make or break a visit, but if you can try and get Sanjay Mudgal who took us to the Taj, Fort, Mehtab Bagh as well. Highly educated and knowledgable on the history and current events, humourous, charming, nothing too much trouble, courteous, just a real pleasure to be with, an outstanding guide."
44,Beautiful and delicate! ,This was one of the monument I wanted to see for a long time. When I saw this fully it proved to be much more than I expected. Structur provide an opportunity to photograph. Understand the mind of the lady about her love for his father in whoose memory this structure was built. One can see beutifull paintings on walls & roof.Structure has been declared world heritage monument & preservation is good & garden around structre is being well maintained.Recommended to must see specifically for those having interest in history & love to see old monuments.
45,Tomb of itimad - Ud Daulah,Agra is a city of great architectures this place is so amazing i can't tell you this place has amazing vibes great experience there the designs on the walls is just amazing but the water of that lake is very dirty and also Beware of Monkeys over there.
46,Peaceful place to visit!,"Personally, I liked this visit from the Taj Mahal. Also called the Baby Taj, it has amazing intricate carved out motifs inside the tomb. This is definitely a worthwhile visit and not to be missed."
47,Not a must visit,"I really suggest to see also this Mahal, if you are in agra try to go! The entry price is equal like other monuments you can see in India!!!"
48,Management is better than other places ,"This was a lovely small version of the amazing Taj. It was quiet and great to get inside to see the beautiful marble inlay work up close, it was very delicate, the marble looked like lacework in some places."
49,"A well preserved Monument , a reminder of the Mughal splendor and a architects delight .","This is a small but beautiful tomb away from tourist hussle bustle,very few tourist,good place to spend some time away from crowd,may engage va guide,it's also called baby taj."
50,Peaceful ...,Good but it should be maintained by Agra Government. If cleaned it can be much beautiful. Nice work.
51,Nice little hidden place,I believe this was built before the Taj Mahal just they call it the baby Taj.  This seems wrong to me since the Taj was built after this beautiful structure
52,Nice masoluem,"Last month my family and I went to Delhi for a short trip. We always prefer Delhi as a touring spot. In the last five years, this was our third tour. We generally plan our tour from beforehand but this time it was not possible because we suddenly decided to go to Delhi. Still, we got help from a travel company who assisted us in every possible way. It was a short tour so after reaching Delhi we decided to visit Agra on that particular day. We took the car which was booked for us by the traveling agency. This car took us from Delhi to Agra. The driver was very well behaved and his name was Balbir. We really enjoyed the road trip from Delhi to Agra. We traveled to Agra from Delhi via the Yamuna Express Highway. The scenery and the environment were really beautiful. Balbir gave some valuable information about various key spots while traveling so we were really grateful to him.Finally, we reached Agra. Then we decided to visit the Taj Mahal. As we reached the Taj Mahal, we took a guide whose name was Ashok. He was really knowledgeable and gave minute details about the Taj Mahal. As it was a Sunday so a large number of people were present at the Taj Mahal. Ashok guided us to a vacant area and told us everything about the Taj Mahal. We stayed at Taj Mahal for roughly for 2 hours. We were very satisfied with Ashok. We were very satisfied with the overall trip. In spite of planning within a short span, still, we executed the plan in a very effective manner only due to the traveling agency."
53,Make sure to visit the ‚Äúmini Taj‚Äù,"Went to Baby Taj after visiting Taj Mahal, spectacular little place walked around for ages, absolutely no crowds. Was only one other family there so practically had place to myself.  Loved the intricate designs of buildings and standing in tomb looking out over river, amazing at sunset. Only issues was once I had paid and was inside a man insisted I buy shoe coverings, thought it strange no one had done that at main entrance. So pretty sure I was conned, check at entrance before entering if you need shoe covering !!!!"
54,A Baby Taj,Good architecture in this city. This city is imp part of history and these places show it. Must visit.
55,Prepares you for the big one!,We went here first  before visiting the Taj Mahal because it is referred to as the ‚ÄúBaby Taj‚Äù. We knew it didn‚Äôt look like the Taj but is a marble mausoleum that inspired the building of the Taj Mahal. It is a hidden gem in that it stands alone for its beauty and architecture. The carvings in the marble are incredible and a wonder to look at and ponder.The location is not far from the Taj and definitely worth a stop. It is far less crowded and you will be glad you saw it.
56,Nice to see if your in Agra for more than a day,"Little known by other tourists its a delight to visit this monument without the crush of the crowds at its bigger sibling the Taj Mahal. If you visit both its an interesting comparison to make as this is also very well preserved, and certainly worth your while dropping in here for a couple of hours while in Agra."
57,The similarities to the Taj are striking - bring a flash,We came  here as part of our organised tour. The buildings are beautiful and very well maintained. It is definitely worth a visit.
58,Baby Taj,"This place is also called Baby Taj as it looks very similar to the much bigger Taj Mahal but is smaller. But it is very well decorated. You can visit this tomb of Shahjahan's Grandfather, also Mumtaj Begam's grandfather (Mirza Ghias beg), after you are done with Taj Mahal. It houses some more tombs other than that of the aforementioned Mirza Ghias Beg. You can take an autorickshaw to this place, book tickets to enter. Photography is allowed inside the premises."
59,Need maintenance,The tomb aka ‚ÄúBaby Taj‚Äù is definitively worth it. Most people skip this site because they are short on time hence the lines of tourists are inexistant. It is a very interesting story in a beautiful peaceful setting.
60,Better than the Taj Mahal,"This beautiful gem is over shadowed by the Taj Mahal but it's more beautiful, you can get closer, there were no crowds.Craftsman ship was exquisite, with much more inlaid stonework,bas relief and amazing painted marble ceilings.You come to Agra for the Taj Mahal but you must visit this."
61,The Baby Taj,"After the visit to Taj Mahal it seems that nothing can beat it, yet this little tomb is a rare beauty with exquisite carvings in white marble. Well worth a short visit. Pity it is not taken care better..."
62,The Baby Taj,"There were three specific things we did that made this Tomb visit truly memorable. Firstly we had a good guide for all our Agra attractions, so we had the life and circumstances of Nur Jahan and her husband Jahangir well explained and that story put the building of her father's tomb and the Mughal empire of c.400 years ago in a much clearer context. Secondly we visited the Tomb in the very early morning, and that gave us the opportunity to be there with almost no one else, in a beautiful misty light. The white marble and varying coloured inlays are just stunning. And finally we visited the ""Baby Taj"" first, so there was never a sense of anticlimax, just a further build up of anticipation for the Taj Mahal that was still to come. Very beautiful, and a real surprise."
63,Baby Taj,"This place is locally known as the Baby Taj and you can see why. It was built only a few years before the Taj and has very similar styles on display. There are actually paintings on the walls here rather than just mosaics and unfortunately many of these are in poor state of repair but don't let this put you off.It's a great place to visit as almost nobody else is there. It's a pretty magnificent building and although it doesn't compare to the Taj in scale, it's still beautiful and well worth a visit. Once you do some research around the Taj and understand where this Baby Taj fits in in terms of the family tree of the Mughals, it makes this place come to life even more and definitely gets our vote as a place to visit whilst in Agra."
64,Have to see,We drove by this place& as planned we stopped here to see the little(baby) Taj Mahal ..IT was nice to see where Akbar got his Inspiration..The design and architectural plans Made about 500 years ago ..amazing..IT is fun to do with kids also ..
65,Serene,"I went to the tomb during a visit to Agra. It is known ans the baby Taj. It was the first Mughal building created entirely in marble, rather than sandstone. There are steps so those of limited mobility should be aware. The site is of historical significance, so well worth a visit. Recommended."
66,A bit disappointing.,"This small tomb, yet very detailed in its decor, as a nice break from the bustling Agra Fort and Taj Mahal.  It is sighted on the Yamuna river too and we had a great vantage point to view the many cows and street dogs cooling off in the river!  It is easier to wander around in and meaningful as well."
67,A great addition to a visit to the Taj,"This is call Baby Taj, which I understand that the Taj Mahal borrowed the shape and some technics from it."
68,Mini Taj ,"We visited this tomb, sometimes called Baby Taj before visiting the Taj Mahal. It resides on the river bank opposite the taj and is serene and quiet. Our guide gave us lots of info, how it was connected to the family of woman for whom the Taj was built.The decorations have deteriorated but you can still see how beautiful they werein 1600's. It was finished before the Taj was built but has similar design. I enjoyed walking around this building."
69,Baby Taj,"I like this place, also has his own story, nice architecture, beautiful garden, a little bit not well taken care, it was very hot and no wind"
70,Baby Taj,Among many monuments in this ancient city this place has got heritage and good place to showcase photography skills
71,Quiet but very nice,"after the crowds at Taj Mahl we inisted to be taken to this place which is overlooked by many visitors. our guide was happy that we asked to viwit it , and it was a treat. he calls it the small Taj Mahal and it is amazing"
72,Monument to be viewed in peace,This is a famous tourist size near the Taj mahal.. Place is a well built tomb but recommended to be travelled in winters as it is very hot in summers in agra..... Overall a great site to visit
73,Beautiful,This is a nice 10 minute drive from Agra fort and seems to be included as part of a combined tour.Much smaller than the Taj but much more detailed inside.Try taking a picture of the ceilings with your camera flash on.Hardly any tourists when We visited so more or less had the place to ourselves.
74,Another amazing example of human ingenuity,"I went on a Private Tour Day Trip to Agra from Delhi today (see separate Review) and - after visiting both the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort - we went across the river to the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah.Immediately on arrival it was not difficult to see why this is also known as the Baby Taj. Whilst not exactly a miniature replica of the Taj Mahal, there are many similarities but one of big differences is that it only attracts a fraction of the number of visitors at the Taj Mahal. This is good news for those who make the effort to see both attractions - particularly as the ‚Äòbaby‚Äô was actually constructed from 1622-28 which was before the Taj Mahal.I would certainly advise more visitors to the Taj to also visit the ‚ÄòBaby‚Äô for what should prove an equally enjoyable visit."
75,Baby Taj,Also called Baby Taj as the tomb inside looks like a smaller version of the Taj Mahal.Beautiful place which I highly recommend to see if you are in Agra.
76,also the Baby Taj,As locals say this as baby Taj.This is another marvel of Parsian and Mughal architecture with Delicate stone work.This is the tomb of Itmad ud Daulah.
77,A charming monument,"If there were no Taj Mahal, this would be the site to visit in Agra.  Beautifully set on the riverbank, this gravesite is worthy of historic significance.  The site is a smaller scale than the Taj, but that is what makes it so appealing.  You will not find the crowds either, which allows you to linger in the tomb and gardens and appreciate this beautiful site."
78,Nice history ,"This is a beautiful building and worth seeing, along with the river next to it. We hired a tuc tuc for a couple of hours which allowed us to see this & go to the sunset, Taj Mahal viewpoint. Defo go & see if you have time to kill in Agra."
79,Visit as part of tour,"This is a more serene setting of a ""Baby Taj"" - Beautiful in its design.  The lack of large crowds held add to the experience"
80,Itmad-ud-Daulah also known as baby Taj Mahal.,"If you are short tour of Agra, avoid this. It is not nearby other attractions in Agra.If you are on longer tour in Agra, avoid this. You can probably cover Fatehpur Sikri, Mathura and Agra Fort in the time."
81,The Baby Taj,"Again this is another fantastic place to visit and absorb the culture of India,    so clean and well preserved"
82,Smaller yet detailed,"200 INR for entrance totally worth the price. Its the baby Taj, not so spectacular as the original Taj but if you have spare time in Agra put it in your list. You can buy a sho plastic cover for 10 INR."
83,Nice place to visit in agra,This tomb is much less visited than the Taj. It makes you appreciate the work and the precious stones in the Taj much better
84,Quieter here & you can see the early ideas that are carried out so beautifully in the Taj Mahal,"I saw this tomb as part of a Gate 1 tour.  It is just beautiful.  This tomb is not as Grand as the Taj Mahal, which is part of its charm.  The gardens had more flowers than the Taj as well.  It is often called the jewel box and I can see why.On another note when you rent the shoe covers here the guys will help you put them and take them off!"
85,Baby Taj or White Rose..What a wonder it is...!!! A must see place in Agra...!!!,This was the third and final stop during my day in Agra. I was lucky to be there when it wasn‚Äôt too crowded. Men on the side of the mossoleum will give you shoe covers for a modest tip.
86,Tomb of the grandfather of Mumtaz Mahal of Taj Mahal fame,"With theTaj Mahal and the Red Fort really a ""must"" if you are in Agra. Visit also the nearby Chini Ka Rauza Mausoleum."
87,Great spot less crowded,Good place to visit while in Agra. Apparently emperor Shahjahan got the inspiration for Tajmahal from this mausoleum . Excellent architecture but in need of some renovation/TLC
88,Another beautiful tomb in Agra,Also known as the baby Taj - it actually was the inspiration behind the Taj - has magnificent inlay work on marble - even more detailed than the Taj itself. A must see while in Agra
89,Breathtaking!,It is tomb of noorjahan's father. This is a well maintained and less crowded place compare to the Taj Mahal. Beautiful architecture make this place to must watch place.
90,Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah,"After seeing the Taj Mahal it is so easy to fall in love with the amazing architecture and skill of the buildings, this is no exception. A second must"
91,Tomb of Itimad ul Daulah,"You‚Äôll be disappointed if you go here after although it‚Äôs still quite beautiful in it‚Äôs own right.  Built before the Taj it‚Äôs the first of the three, the third being baby Taj in Aurangabad"
92,Visit to tomb,"Many who go to Agra, go there only for the Taj. Do make time for this lovely gem of masterpiece. The surroundings are quieter, the crowd is lesser, but the beauty of this place takes your breath away. Spend an hour or two just resting in the shade and admiring the beauty and thinking of the times that were."
93,Hot day in May,it is nicely build at the bank of Yamuna river also called mini taj which is build by marbel. very beautiful.
94,Beautiful inlay work on marble.,"less tourism than the taj mahal, but still beautiful with its amazing tombs, a red colored stones walls, a marvelous view on the river bank, green gardens and well-maintained place"
95,nice!,This is also known as baby taj. It is like a tribute to the taj when you look at it it‚Äôs a great place to visit for an hour it‚Äôs not a massive complex and is very nice to wonder around we came at the end of the day and caught the sun set it was quite pretty indeed
96,beautiful architecture of a tomb,This place was beyond my expectations.  It is a small beautiful fort which is well maintained.  The architecture is remarkable.
97,beautiful!!!,It's a nice place...called the Baby Taj..This place was built by NurJahaan as a mausoleum of her parents.The place is Worth a visit..
98,Intimidation at the Intimad,"After Taj Mahal, i consider this place worth visiting in Agra. There is a small fee to get entry. Photography is allowed free of cost. The view of Yamuna River is also awesome from this place."
99,The poor orphan of the Taj Mahal.,I don't remember everything about this visit because we did so much on that day. But I remember we enjoyed it and thought it was beautiful
100,"Older than Taj Mahal, but less famous","Small, beautifully curved, serene place on the bank of river Jamuna, burial place of the parents of NOIRJAHAN, empress and wife of JAHANGIR. Also a must visit"
101,Baby Taj,visit there if you were free and nothing else to do! also do not forget nothing edible is allowed and you will need shoes cover.
102,Try not to miss this one.,"If you have to visit Agra then this is worth a quick visit but as a foreigner you will be stung for 300rps at the gate and a strict bag check. The site is peaceful and a welcome escape from Agra. Nothing too much to see, 30mins is plenty."
103,Wonderful,"Little disappointed as visited after going to Taj Mahal. Seems Taj Mahal is inspired from this tomb. However, Taj Mahal is much grander and beautiful than this tomb. Spent less than 30 minutes at this place. Can visit but can't say a must visit"
104,Lovely place to visit,"Smaller than the Taj but beautiful and you can get closer to the central tomb in a wheelchair. We liked how it was smaller and more compact, another lovely place to visit woth inlaid marble walls and a pomegranate garden more complete than the Taj's as they continue to be sunken to allow easy picking of the fruits."
105,Peaceful place but not mini Taj,"It is similar to Taj Mahal in many ways, but I still found it worth the visit and recommend visiting this monument."
106,Inside fatehpur sikri,Small but still worthy to spend some time to visit here.  You have to take off your shoes to go into the tomb (just fyi)
107,Baby Taj,"There were not a lot of people here, which made it wonderful. Also the inside was as spectacular as the outside."
108,Baby Taj,"This was built by Nur Jahan (donoo if any relations to the man himself, Shah Jahan) for her father. Oh and she built another one for her brother in Lahore. This baby Taj is made of marble and as you walk towards it, you get mesmerised by the beauty and especially the cream colour. It has intricate design and has no dome but instead there are four distinct canopies in each corner.The structure is set in a beautiful garden with the usual geometric features. The entrance is a huge magnificent red sandstone gate. The architecture is beautiful and a real work of art. This place is definitely worth visiting."
109,Prototype for the Taj Mahal?,"This is a small jewel, really worth to see. Made of marble, located in the beautiful garden by the Yamuna River. Go there in the evening. Probably you will see the monkeys there as well."
110,A pefect side trip and an amazingly beautiful area,"Of course this is the first attraction in Agra, but still you should see it. Especially beautiful in the bright sun and at sunset."
111,Ok,"This is clearly bypassed by many.  Which also means it hasn‚Äôt suffered the graffiti and closed off areas because of vandalism as has the Taj.  Beautiful design, inlaid stone, delicate carved marble, stand in ornate rooms near the tombs, etc.  Great story about the period and influences operating."
112,The Baby Taj is just as beautiful ,It is a nice place with the work of marble and marble designs it has so many monkeys and dear and it is it is in the basement and it is so cold
113,One of the best in Agra,This is a marvellous place that is much less crowded than the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort.  Very well maintained and so different from Taj Mahal.  Carvings and pietradura are breathtaking.
114,About mini taj,Definitely worth the visit! Smaller but the carvings are way more delicate than Taj Mahal. Many people would miss it but I would recommend travelers who have time don‚Äôt miss it out.
115,Great place of history...,"Beautiful little place, grounds kept tidy, some renovation work going on. Nice taster to Taj Mahal but suggest you do Baby Taj first."
116,Baby Taj lacks nothing compared to the ‚Äúbig‚Äù Taj.,"We visited the Baby Taj after I read about it on the internet. What a find! The mosaic and artwork is much more impressive than the Taj Mahal and you don't have to battle the crowds. Of course the Taj Mahal is an outstanding building but if you're looking for a peaceful wander around a smaller site with fabulous artwork, you won't be disappointed. We loved it. You really should see both."
117,Agra is Not Just About Taj Mahal,"This was advertised to me as the Baby Taj and although it was influential in the design of that wonder, it is not of the same quality. Painted rather than the ornate inlaid stone of the real thing. That being said, I found it interesting and is well worth a visit, even if it's a relatively long journey from the Taj."
118,Don't skip it,"I liked the Tomb of Itmad... Also known as ""baby Taj"". It is far less expensive, much less crowded so you can really sit and enjoy the site, architecture and art on the walls. It also offers a great view of the river and the buffalos roaming in it üòõ"
119,Unexpectedly good,"If you do not like crowds, this is the place in agra. away from the fort and Taj, this is a beautiful monument on the other side of the river"
120,so beautiful monument,A visit to this miniature version of Taj enriched me in all possible ways. I and my family enjoyed it a lot and are looking forward to more such tours.
121,Not to be missed,The architecture of this building is amazing. Beautiful views of the Taj Mahal.   Best to visit at sunset.
122,Unexpected surprise,Very ornate and surprising place. Beautiful inlaid work. Burial place of grandparents of Mumtaz Mahal who is buried in Taj Mahal. Not too many people here as I think less well known but really worth a visit
123,AWESOME,"Little less known Tomb at Agra , but it was very beautiful . Less crowded , wonderful place to spend quality time ."
124,"Called ""The Baby Taj""","Yes this is the Mini Taj, the inspiration to the beautiful inlay work at the Taj Mahal. This site is very beautifully maintained besides the Yamuna, very clean and easy to access. Parking is just along the main road, 70‚Çπ parking for a car and 20‚Çπ entry fee, and yes you would need those you covers you used at the Taj!"
125,Hidden gem,I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs not known to people enough. The marvellous structure should be brought forth into the public eye! It‚Äôs a beautiful place and it‚Äôs said that Taj was inspired from it.
126,Don't forget this when in Agra,"It is easy when visiting Agra to see the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort and then rush on.  Don't!  The Itimad ud Dualah is a masterpiece in its own right and is well worth a visit.  In fact, if it weren't for the Taj, Agra would be famous for this!  It is small and need not take long to visit but it is worth lingering to take in its beauty and prefect proportions.  The story behind it is also worth knowing."
127,Must See,"Went early, straight after the sunrise trip to the Taj and we were the only people there. A lovely building with some stunning inlay work all over the building."
128,Worthwhile if you have time,Its a beautiful architecture with a huge garden area and river yamuna flowing right behind it. Good place to visit. Try to avoid during summer afternoon. Very steep parking charges outside.
129,Baby Taj is not to be missed,"This is a wonderful tomb which inspired the Taj Mahal.  Built by the most power Empress of India (the Persian wife of Jahangir & aunt of Taj Mahal) for her father.  Near the Akbar Garden across the river from the Taj (best to see both at the same time).  This is more a palace than a tomb.   Not much to see in the interior.  Had to rush to Akbar's Garden to view the Taj for 3 hour, only gave me an hour here.  If you ignore the ridiculous entry fee of INR 220, the building is enough different from the Taj to make it the second prettiest building in India (the alternate Taj near Mumbai is no where close in beauty).  This is a hidden gem...."
130,Beautiful!,"Your tour is not complete until and unless you visit this monument, unfortunately the congestion in the area is a damper, but once you are inside it‚Äôs awesome"
131,Baby Taj,people call it baby taj it has very nice tombs and carvings it is white like the taj mahal. it is great
132,Itmad ud Dayak tomb,A must visit when you are in Agra. A a bit unknown to most public. You could enjoy watching Eagles and also the cool breeze from Yamuna from here though the river is not in healthy state
133,An overlooked gem,"Popularly known as baby taj, this monument is to be believed as an inspiration to Taj Mahal and I can accept this fact after I experienced the monument."
134,Earlier Work of Taj Mahal Architect,"Not a lot to see once inside really.  Most of the tombs areas are very much the same, but its worth a visit.  The grounds are very nice to walk around and of course there are the monkeys and dogs roaming freely - very well behaved"
135,Interesting to see the earlier works of Taj's architect,The Taj is not the only 5 star site in Agra. The baby Taj is also terrific and even more intricately carved and inlaid than the Taj. Probably no more than a dozen people visiting when we went in the afternoon.
136,Beautiful,A very important piece of architecture in Agra. This is first tomb that is made of marble only and not red stone. This is the tomb of Mir Gheyas beg who was a minister in Jahangir and Shah Jahan's court. Mir Beg was the father of Noor Jahan who was the wife of Jahangir...This is a beautiful tomb and is a kind of prelude to the making of Taj Mahal...It is set in a courtyard with gardens around it and one side overlooking the banks of Yamuna river...really nice and peaceful place..the architecture is beautiful and one can spend time leisurely in viewing this place as the crowd of visitors here is very less..it  does not have the kind of popularity that the Taj has...but any one who is keen on history and architecture shou;d definitely visit this place...
137,One Of Best Things To See In Agra,"Although many people refer to this amazing monument (which is also known as Moti Bagh) as being the 'Baby Taj', our guide preferred to see it actually as the prototype for the Taj Mahal. It certainly is very impressive - the architecture is very intricate and detailed - and with much lower visitor numbers a rather more peaceful place to visit"
138,Fabulous architecture,This architectural gem set in the most beautiful garden environment is charged with meaning and emotion. We were privileged to visit with a really good and informative guide.
139,"A Fine & Pure Combination PERSIAN & MUGHAL Architecture , based on white marble and pietra dura inlay Carving","Sometimes referred to as the ""Baby Taj"" this is another Agra gem not to be missed ! Perfect gardens and wonderful architecture. A must see."
140,Don't miss it.,"you can tell that the Taj Mahal was inspired by this ""baby Taj"". Beautiful and a bit neglected by the tourist machine, well worth the visit"
141,Beautiful Little Taj,Another one of those moments when building are covered in Scaffolding.A quick look as it was not that impressive.
142,A small gem tucked away in Agra,Loved this place & would definitely recommend to other people. What an amazing piece of Architecture. Wow Factor!! So glad our tour guide showed us this place.
143,Beautiful Monument. Worth Visiting,"You will learn this historical monument is the earlier work of Taj Mahal's architect. It may be considered the Taj prototype. This was the first Mughal structure built completely from marble, the first to make extensive use of pietra dura and the first tomb to be built on the banks of the Yamuna River.All Walls and Domes are accentuated with floral, geometric and animate motifs, the decoration of which is rivalled only by the profuse and varied depictions of these same motifs in colourful paintings and inlaid stone used to enhance the interior of the structure .It was constructed outside Agra‚Äôs city walls on the eastern bank of the Yamuna in a garden originally owned by Itimad-ud-Daula himself."
144,A mini Taj Mahal with less crowd,It was a nice relaxing visit ... Not too much crowd so that's makes it easier to relax and enjoy your time without any rush.
145,A Gem,"The father of Taj Mahal or the first example of marble architecture by Mughals. This place is as beautiful if not more than the Taj. Set by the side of the Yamuna River, this wonder is calm, quiet and a delight to spend a peaceful afternoon or catch the golden sunset by the river."
146,Beautiful!,We visited this Taj later in the afternoon when it was getting dusk. The amazing marble with its inlaid semi precious stone is superb and the architecture fantastic. There are water features too but for us it was so interesting to view the Yamona river and see the buffalo bathing on the opposite bank as well as the bird life on the water. It was very quiet when we were there. Do look at the tomb of the Emperor and his family.
147,Great,"The tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah or the Baby Taj, should be on everybody‚Äôs list for Agra.  Very beautiful, stone inlays are of less expensive stones then the Taj, but the level of detail on the tomb is astounding.  Far less crowded and enjoyable than the Taj Mahal."
148,Good place to visit for an hour,Visited this after Taj Mahal and loved it. Restored gardens emit a wonderful fragrance to enjoy this beautifully decorated building. The lack of the crowds are welcome in this tourist-heavy city.
149,The little jewellery box,Staying in Agra there are times when you crave some peace and quiet. A visit to this site is just the ticket. It is the mausoleum of the Mogul‚Äôs mother‚Äôs family. It is right by the river Yamuna on the opposite side to the Red Fort and the Taj Mahal but on the same side as the Mehtab Bagh gardens. There are lovely gardens and some exquisite wall decorations which differ from those found in the Taj Mahal. The entrance fee is 250 rupees and the toilets there are very good.
150,Nice river view,"Also known as BAby Taj Mahal, this is one othe best places to visit in Agra. Many your guides might tell you that it's nothing and take you shopping etc. But dont listen to them and visit this place as it is beautiful and artistic. I am glad we did."
151,Great place to watch the sunset,"This baby Taj was not on my list of things to do, but it was a great site.  as nice as the larger version but not the same scale.  dont miss this"
152,Mini Taj Mahal,Its a nice place tp visit if u are in agra but it wouldnt be my priority! Just go there if u want to take a few pics!!
153,Very Pretty,"While not as large or publicized like the Taj Mahal or Agra Fort, this little gem should not be missed if you have the time.  A major significance of this mausoleum is that it was the first building of Mughal architecture of white marble instead of red sandstone.  It was built by Empress Noor Jahan in 1622-29 to honor her parents, who are buried there.  The inlays and detail are exquisite!!  Called the ‚Äúmini Taj‚Äù by locals, many of its designs were incorporated into the Taj Mahal which was built later.  A peaceful place, less crowded and with a beautiful garden.  Try to include it if you can."
154,Impressive on a smaller scale,This in some ways was actually better the Taj Mahal and is not far away. It is often known as the Baby Taj. Much quieter and still very beautiful. You have to take off your shoes and the floor can be wet. Nice views and gardens.
155,Tourism,"This tomb was built before the Taj, but definitely you see the architects practicing the style used ultimately to build the Taj.  It's smaller, but also nicely symmetrical.  The walls are not pure white marble, but rather engraved with delicate geometric patterns--like a big piece of Belgian lace.  They also first started doing the semi-precious stone inlay on this tomb.  It's in a nice, typical garden alongside the river.  Very peaceful here--unlike the Taj you won't be fighting endless crowds.  More likely you'll have this place to yourself, as I did on a Wednesday afternoon!  Truly enjoyable."
156,Great...,The Mini Taj. Not very huge or prominent but magnificent nonetheless. The calm and serenity surrounding the place was astounding. Definitely a must visit
157,do not miss it !,A magical place with ambiance to wallow in. A great experience. If we could go back tomorrow we would
158,Baby Taj in Agra,This is a must see when you are in Agra.  It was completed in the early 1600's in a peaceful and beautiful area.It was built before the Taj and houses the mausoleum of Mirza Ghiyas Beg and his family.  There is also a family connection with the woman who inspired the Taj Mahal.
159,beautiful and impressive in its own right,This is Nur Jagan's father tomb. Very beautiful and Taj Mahal is built as per this.  Work on white stone are very nice.Good to visit
160,Do three things when visiting both this Tomb and the Taj Mahal,"I didn't expect to be as impressed by the ""Baby Taj"" as I was.  It was amazing to wander the property (we did so in the early morning) and see the ornate marble & designs. I loved sitting out by the river and watching as people started their mornings.  I wish some of the upper levels were open so we could explore even more!!"
161,A Real Gem and Tranquil,Well worth a visit. Lovely views and an interesting history. Very different to the TM and complimentary to it.
162,Incredible Workmanship and Beauty,"A lovely little (by comparison) gem, easily visited in combination with Metab Bagh, beautifully situated along the river."
163,Recommend in Agra ,"Agra in a day is hard work. But this was a lovely and peaceful last site. Wonderfully understated, quite and not crowded it was a great place to just sit and watch.Really worth the visit"
164,Awesome Baby Taj Mahal,"In some aspect, I found it beautiful than the Taj, just that it was much smaller. The facade is more beautiful as it has some colourful designs on while marbel. Maintenance is good but a guide service by the Govt would make is better."
165,Baby Taj is a Must See,"Went here on our tour of the area, giving us a fantastic viewpoint of the history of Agra. There is so much to see in this are  worth a visit"
166,Beautiful mausoleum known as the Baby Taj,This place also known as the Mini Taj Mahal is a must see for everyone visiting Agra. The building is beautiful with intricate details on the walls.
167,Must go!,An incredible Tomb in white marble and very detailed inlay work. Extremely peaceful and stunning architecture. Number 2 on my list of where to visit in Agra after the Taj.
168,Lovely place to visit. Very intimate.,We came here near the end of the day after visiting the Taj and the Red Fort. It's an interesting place to visit and well worth the effort. We had a guide which was worth it as he told us all about the history and architecture of the place so we got the most from it. A definite must see.
169,Exquisite mausoleum in marble,"Lovely building, nice views of the river. A bit of peace and quiet away from the madness, well worth a visit."
170,Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah,"Itamd Ud Daula is in a way more silent & peaceful than Taj Mahal as rush is very less than Taj Mahal. You can relax, draw a painting for many hours without being distracted by any commotion around the area. Designing wise this mosleum is symmetrical from all 4 side having 7 graves in it. It was built by Mughal Empress Nur Jahan in year 1621 much before Taj Mahal. A must visit if you came to Agra. You can plan your visit as- Early Morning Taj Mahal because of rush factor and then Agra fort. Take some rest in hotel. Afternoon, you can visit here. Ventilation is so good, even during warm days, you will feel coolness inside mosleum.My advice is to avoid any guides on the spot as history is pretty well documented unless it is very necessity. Just enjoy the design and architecture of the place.Enjoy your visit!"
171,Baby Taj,It is the first marble building in the india.Also known as white gem.It signifies true respect by daughter to father.Greatone.
172,Baby Taj... take your time and explore ,"Our guide was invaluable for explaining the historical significance of this site.  Enjoyed the quieter location, the peaceful grounds and the ability to look at everything up close.  The skill and craftsmanship is amazing.  It would seem anticlimactic to see it after the Taj so I would suggest viewing it after the Agra Fort and before heading to see the Taj Mahal.  You will appreciate it much more then."
173,Poorly maintained,"I visited this Tomb because of a recommendation by the tour guide, and I liked it very much, but because of the time, which was just before sunset, the light was poor inside, so we could not see the details well, but we had a clear idea what was inside because of the small museum at the entrance, the place was quite because not too many tourists know about it, but this is the inspiration behind the famous Taj Mahal, that‚Äôs why many locals call it baby taj, it is a great place to visit but because it is small in size it will not take long to see it all."
174,The high water mark of Mughal patronized architecture,Go with a guide. Fascinating story behind the beautiful intricate carvings and stonework. Alternative sneak peek at the Taj Mahal.
175, Nice to visit,This mini Taj does not attract much attention from tourists. It has very similar design and architecture to the Taj except for the dome. Remove your shoes to enter the tomb. Avoid taking the shoe cover because it is just a used cover but they will still ask for tip and payment.
176,"Beautiful, serene and rather under-rated","We came here very early in the morning.  It was the best thing because we were the only ones here.  I believe it is not as well known as the Taj and is not visited as much.I absolutely love the inlaid work here.Too bad there is no water running here anymore.  It would have been very beautifulTo the side of the entrance gate is a little history of the site.  It will just take you 5 min to go through it.and again, beware of the guy looking for tips.  He tries to rent you booties like they make you wear at the Taj.  However, these booties have been used many times because there are holes on the bottom of the booties.  And there is no requirement for booties here.   It was kind of amusing."
177,The so-called Mini-Taj is a delight to see.,"This is a wonderful place to visit; calm, lovely gardens, views across the river and a beautiful tomb.Accept the Taj Mahal will be busy and then enjoy Baby Taj with much fewer tourists.Highly recommended."
178, I'timƒÅd-ud-Daulah's Tomb ,"a nice stay if you are into architecture of this period.  Very quick stop,  and glad we stopped there."
179,Truly beautiful,"This place is a dream! Smaller than Taj Mahal but beautifully decorated! It looks like a jewel box. Unlike the Taj where you will find crowds of people, here we were almost alone!"
180,Beautiful tomb,With such a glorious past Etmad ud daulla is not just another mughal building but it has its own story of love deciphered through beautiful inlay work and architectural wonder...!!A must visit place locally called Baby Taj but it has more to seesand observe than Taj Mahal itself.The inlay work done on Etmad is actually repeated in Taj Mahal.. All floral and geometric patterns are knowns as quintessantials of then mughal era buildings... Beautiful gardens to accompany the White Rose... A must visit when in Agra...!!!Please do feel the soulful work it is...!!
181,Beautiful Mughal architecture,"They call this the Baby Taj, and when visiting, one can see the resemblance: smaller, less majestic, but also carefully detailed and symmetrically laid out.  Worth a trip."
182,Amazing ,"Known as the mini or baby Taj because it has a similar profile, this mausoleum is well worth visiting. It is quite a small site, but the building itself is beautiful, very decorative and has a restful air to it. There are some wonderful murals and the layout of the main room of the mausoleum is an echo of that of the Taj Mahal.Sadly, there is less attention to the maintenance of this monument than there is at the Taj itself and there is some graffiti damage inside it. However, a visit here should still be on the itinerary."
183,An Underrated Gem,"Whilst the Taj Mahal gets all the kudos, the Baby Taj gets overlooked. There was only a small fraction of the number of visitors here compared to the Taj Mahal. That made it much more peaceful  and calming a place to visit.The inlaid work into the marble is a world class piece of art, and is well worth closer inspectionAs much a must see as the TM"
184,Baby Taj - fabulous.,"This is a must see. There is so much in India. I used Odynovo Tours I found this agency online and was a little nervous as they did not have a lot of magazines and guides discussing their agency but I found only good reviews and decided to work with this agency.  I spent a lot of time with Queenie Yang planning a trip to India. Wonderful, reasonable and unforgettable trip. Mr. Sanjay was wonderful driver and I honestly wish I had booked a longer stay in India. This organization checked in with me throughout my visit to make sure my trip was going as planned and every one was very helpful and resourceful. I will use them again!"
185,Amazing,"And if you have already seen the Taj Mahal and the Fort of Agra, and you have some more time in Agra, something which you must visit if you are in Agra... beautiful monument."
186,Just as beautiful,"This is what they call the ‚Äúbaby Taj‚Äù and I can see why. The material of construction, style of construction, and layout are very similar. Of course it‚Äôs not as big and not as grand, but still a beautiful place."
187,Impressive ,Easy to overlook with the wonderful Taj Mahal close by. But don't!!  It has none of the crowds and is an exquisite building and garden in which to while away an hour or two. Haggle hard with Auto-rickshaw driver and you'll get there for under Rs150.
188,Mini Taj built before Taj Mahal in th years before 1600,"India has so many incredibly beautiful monuments, this is yet another one.  This is definitely worth a visit.  Called the Baby Taj, it is often forgotten by tourists so its worth visiting just to get away from the crowds.  The tomb is detailed and quite beautiful in it's white marble and semi-precious stones."
189,Baby Taj,"The Taj Mahal is the main attraction in Agra, and rightly so, but if you have an afternoon or morning spare I would encourage everyone to visit the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah. It was built by the aunt of the woman the Taj was built for, and was the precursor design. It is significantly smaller than the Taj Mahal, but perhaps even more beautiful in its decoration. Absolute MUST SEE."
190,Itimad ud daulha tomb,"Also known as the Baby Taj, this was the first marble mausoleum in Agra. It's much, much smaller than the Taj Mahal, but impressively pretty nonetheless and only 250 INR for adults to get in (kids under 15 free). It's over the river from the Fort/Taj, so we combined this with the Mehtab Bagh for an afternoon's sightseeing and really enjoyed it."
191,Worth the visit,One of best tomb of the Mughal period. The architecture is still mind blowing. And the sitting place beside the bank of jamuna is good. Only be aware of the lovers... They occupy most of the sitting places
192,A Little Gem,The tradition involves offering shawl in the tomb. Beware - cost of the shawl are expensive and the money paid is for the businessmen and not offered to the tomb services
193,A good one,"Mugal emperor Shahjahan built this to honor his grandfather and all the family members.  Shahjahan built this before Taj Mahal, so the simulation is strong, and people call this baby Mahal since the name ‚ÄúItmad-ud-Daulah‚Äù is hard to remember.  Personally, I like this better than Taj Mahal.  The amount of details, decoration, and construction is amazing.  Sadly, it has been damaged by visitors with poor security fundings.  I highly recommend this place if you like Taj Mahal, or get tired of crowds, want to find a peaceful and beautiful place to visit and admire."
194,Beautiful Tomb,"Parent's tomb of the persian architect of Taj Mahal, this monument is a hidden jewel.You will also enjoy the view of the river side where locals spend their afternoon swimming their to refresh themself."
195,Beautiful,"Tomb of Etmauddaula (and other spellings|) also known affectionately as the ‚Äòbaby Taj' built some twenty years before the Taj Mahal itself. A similar style to its grander neighbour a few miles away, anywhere else it would be considered a substantial beautiful building. But in Agra it obviously suffers by comparison with the main Taj but is nevertheless well worth a visit to see a lovely building."
196,A Taj Mahal preview,"This duplicate of Taj Mahal which Shah Jahan built for his beloved wife's parents ... is a must see attraction.The exquisite work, the little beautiful gardens & the tranquillity u find in this place can't really be found at the real Taj due to the more crowded visitors in the real Taj."
197,Very impressive building without the crowds of the Taj Mahal ,"I would recommend seeing this before visiting the Taj Mahal. Known as the ""Baby Taj"" a visit here is an excellent 'starter' before seeing the Taj Mahal as your 'main course'. When we visited there was hardly anyone there despite this being a major historical site. Our guide explained the significance of this building which really helped us to understand why it is so important. Either go with a guide or read up on this place before you go.It really whets your appetite for the Taj Mahal and should not be overlooked."
198,Mini Taj,I dont understand why people call this Mini Taj. This is nowhere like Taj but still has its own charm and attractive.The carvings  and paintings on the wall are good and makes your visit worth. The back area on Yamuna banks is good for a resting some time in the hot climate of Agra.
199,Stunning ,I've been to Agra before but not visited this.  Again this is a spot that requires a guide to explain its history as that is where the enjoyment lies.  The similarities to the Taj Mahal are striking and the fact that it predates the Taj makes it all the more interesting.Worth a visit - plus you can go in amongst the tombs with your camera.  If you have it bring a powerful flash - the murals on the walls are beautiful
200,‚ÄúBaby Taj‚Äù,"Very calm and peaceful, Baby Taj is a nice, nice piece of architecture. Beautiful place, strongly recommended..."
201,A beautiful mausoleum on banks of Yamuna,An awesome monument counted in the seven wonders. The rate is 50 per person for the general review and 250 if you want to visit the masoleoum and taj both.
202,Peaceful and beautiful ,"People said it is a smaller version of the Taj Mahal.  I actually like the environment better than the real one.  It was quiet when we visited the site and the site ground was clean and well kept. The buildings are of very interesting Indian architecture with intricate designs.  It is definitely worth a visit,"
203,Beautiful place,This is a wonderful and peaceful site. The buildings are finished to a high level of craftsmanship and everything looks wonderful in the sunlight.
204,It-mad-ud-daula,"The Baby Taj is absolutely stunning.  There are fewer crowds here, enabling appreciation of just a shockingly beautiful edifice.  A must go"
205,Baby Taj ,Stunning beautiful inlay work covers the building. Made all of marble like the Taj Mahal. Definitely not be missed if in Agra.
206,Wonderful Artwork,Grand building with plush lawns and inlaid stone Murals and floors. worth viewing as it is a window to the stylish lives of the Mughal  Elite.
207,"Charm of Taj Mahal & yet serene, quite",A visit to the tomb is a must if you are visiting Agra. The building is a real work of art. Ensure that you have a good guide for the day.
208,Beautiful and well worth the visit,"I've been to Agra a few times but somehow I've missed out on visiting the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah. But not this time - I made it a point to visit after the morning sunrise at the Mehtab Bagh which isn't that far away in a taxi/uber. A mid-afternoon visit is an ideal time to come as there aren't that many tourists. The entire visit can be done in about 30 minutes but I stayed a bit longer to sit in the shade and just enjoy the sights. Be patient if you're taking an Uber as it appears not many folks come around this area. For first time visitors, I would start with seeing the Baby Taj as the construction began before the Taj Mahal palace. You'll get a greater appreciation of the history when you see the Taj the next morning at sunrise."
209,A great Monument,"After you are done visiting the Taj Mahal, make sure you make a short trip across the river to visit the tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah.    It is essentially a mini Taj Mahal with the minarets at the corners of the building rather than separated from the structure.  Sure, it‚Äôs not nearly as large or beautiful from the outside, but it‚Äôs still a beautiful marble building with walls & ceilings that are much more decorated than the Taj Mahal.  We enjoyed it ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth a visit.  And while you are there, make sure that you look out over the river at the rear of the tomb to see the laundries along the riverbank.  It‚Äôs quite fascinating to see, especially the way that all the colors are separated."
210,Not worth the tjme,"Not far from the Taj Mahal and just across the river from the Red Fort, this baby Taj is the most serene and beautiful building I have been to.  Yes the Taj Mahal is impressive, but in my mind this is much better.  If you miss out on this building, you hvn't seen India."
211,Ignored structure but very beautiful front.,"Worth a visit, 250r entry if you pay on card (300 otherwise) We visited in July and was very quiet. Nicknamed the baby Taj"
212,A tomb of its own standard,Known by most as Baby Taj. We arrived at about 10a.m. and couldn‚Äôt how empty or detailed it was. An absolute must do when in Agra.
213,Excellent craftsmanship of the tomp of Jahangir's In laws,"Most people focus on the Taj, but the Baby Taj is a must see. It's totally different in its shapes, architecture, etc. and has beautiful views across the river. It looks like a mini jewelry box! Way less crowded than the Taj too."
214,baby taj,Great place to visit.  Not many tourists.  Very peaceful.  Well worth it. As beautiful as the Taj without all of the hassle.
215,Nice memory,"Emperor Jahangir built this mausoleum for his wife Nur Jehan's father.Serene ambience, and good work. The well proportioned monument is a small gem worth visiting in the city of Agra.They have also introduced a touch screen interactive display as there are no guides here."
216,The grandeur of Baby Taj,"Tomb of Nurjehan's father is a replica of Taj Mahal. There are so many conflicting stories about Taj Mahal - one also being that Taj Mahal was a temple. Don't know what came first, but this monument just like Humayun Tomb is also a replica of Taj Mahal and in red stone.Needs some care and love of ASI. View of Yamuna was really nice. Great place to just sit and ponder next to the river."
217,Don‚Äôt Miss Out ,"Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah or also known as Baby Taj was so beautiful! The entry fee for foreigner is Rs 310. Also not so many people know this place so it is not crowded, and you can take as many pictures as you can. Also made of white marble, Baby Taj was said to be the inspiration of Taj Mahal. Baby Taj is the tomb made for Mumtaz Mahal's grandparents. If you happened across Agra, just don't miss this place. Although smaller than Taj Mahal, its beauty is to be compare with."
218,Baby Taj,"This seventeenth century mausoleum of the Mughal era in the Motibagh area of Agra was built in the honour of Mirza Ghiyas Beg, who was one of the most reliable and dependable functionaries of the Mughal empire, during emperor Jahangir's period and hence was known as 'Idimad Ud Daulah'. Mirza Ghiyas Beg happened to be the father of Nur Jahan, wife of emperor Jahangir and grand father of Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Shah Jahan.  The construction of the mausoleum, built by Nur Jahan is in white marble with inlays of other stones. The similarity with Taj Mahal, constructed later by emperor Shah Jahan are the symetrical construction (looks same from all sides) and the white marble as the main building blocks. Hence this monument is also known as 'Baby Taj'. It is said that the the concept of the world famous Taj Mahal was inspired by this monument.The property which has entry ticket of INR 20.00 is situated on a big sprawling compound on the bank of river Yamuna. There are a few other smaller constructions in the site. Shoes and other footwear are not allowed inside the premises. However one can wear disposable shoe covers as in the case of visits to Taj Mahal.Inside the mausoleum there are graves of Mirza Ghiyas Beg and his family members.This is a must visit place while in Agra, to view a monument with such a likeness to Taj Mahal, though smaller in scale and much less talked about than the world famous Taj.    m"
219,Baby taj,"This tomb is commonly referred to as the Baby Taj given its likeness to the Taj. What I didn't realise was that this building was built first. It is beautifully crafted with all the carving and in-lay that you will see at the Taj. The tombs within are interesting with their unique way of designated which gender is buried there. One thing we liked was that there were not too many people at this tomb and we could walk around in relative peace, enjoying the magnificent building without jostling with too many people."
220,Baby Taj,A miniature version of Taj Mahal. This was made of cream coloured marble though with the same geometry of the 4 pillars. The adjoining garden is pretty big and well maintained too. The best part was this place was not crowded like the mainstream attractions. Liked my visit.
221, Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah ,This building is the precursor to the Taj. The architecture is highly ornate and in very good condition. Well worth a visit prior to visiting the Taj
222,Really Beautiful and Quiet!,One must visit this place to understand the sheer marvelous of Islamic architecture. The marble tomb dedicated to Noor Jehan wife of Jehangir is beautiful. Not like Taj Mahal but surely a very beautiful building. One must visit to truly understand the beauty.
223,Beautiful!,We visited early in the morning to see the prototype for the Taj. More ornate inside than the Taj and in a lovely setting next to the river
224,Not to be missed!,"If you see Taj Mahal first, then this one will not offer much, but the view behind the building is very picturesque."
225,Gr8 architecture ,"Known as the ""baby taj"" or the ""Jewel box"", this tomb is a little gem. Beautiful artwork throughout - used as one of the design plans for the Taj Mahal."
226,Peaceful. ,This is yet another beautiful tomb in Agra - not at all busy. Visitor entrance fee is only 250 rupees each. The gardens are very well looked after and very clean compared to the rest of Agra.
227,baby taj! next in line after taj mahal in agra! not to miss!,"If you would like to skip the busy city of Agra and if you are looking forward to talk to nice people, ""Itimad ud-Daulah"" or ""Baby Taj"" is worth a try. Just pay R200 to enter the site. I will leave the rest to your own imagination..."
228,Miniature Version of the Taj,"This is a little gem of a mausoleum in Agra. Similar in design to the Taj Mahal but much smaller and easier to access and visit. Made of white marble with inlaid semi-precious stones the interior is wonderful with lovely wall paintings and ceilings. The gardens are also very pleasant. Beware, you must take your shoes off to enter. There are a couple of men who mind your shoes for a tip but they are out of the way a bit and may be difficult to see."
229,The mini taj ,"Stunning mosaics, tranquil gardens, totally delightful. A must see in Agra. The Baby Taj has its own individual personality and is not as busy as the Taj Mahal. Absolutely loved this beautiful building and the gorgeous gardens."
230,Good for old architecture lovers ,Not worth paying entry fee if you are foreigner. Completely ignored by Tourism industry and Archaeological survey. It is tomb of Jahangir's father in law.
231,Baby Taj,"This is much less visited than the Taj Mahal of course, but there is a hauntingly beautiful and intimate feeling that one can get by lingering here, especially around sunset. The gardens are small but much more lush than the Taj gardens, with a more authentic Mughal style of flowers and fruits filling the quadrangles rather than lawn (which is an English penchant unadapted to the climate)."
232,Important Precursor To Taj,Tomb of Itimad ul Daulah is located in the outskrits of Agra. It is a worth visiting place. People can take public transport from Agra.
233,Nice place,Interesting historical place to visit for an hour or so. Parking relatively easy. Some refreshment nearby.
234,Beautiful and serene atmosphere,"It is a smaller and more ‚Äúmodest‚Äù version of the Taj Mahal, but it is also much quieter and very beautiful as well. It is worth the visit."
235,Beautiul,"This 400 year old mausoleum which predates the Taj Mahal is a fantastic example of the architectural achievements of the period.  It is much more relaxing to visit and easier to get up close to walls, etc as it is not subject to many visitors - there were less than 20 when I visited midday and half were locals."
236,Baby Taj,"The complex is purely maintained, marble is chipping off the buildings, street dogs roaming freely in the premises, no local Guides available. This doesn‚Äôt match the hype about being the Baby Tak or the precessor of Taj Mahal. Government has completely ignored this monumental else would have taken some pain in restoring the building, filling up the fountain and waterways and even cutting some wild grass in the gardens and planting some flowers instead. Even the view to the Yamuna is pathetic, lots of trash and garbage lying around the banks of the river. There is a eery air inside the tomb, can be because there are 11 graves lying inside in the dark. Only one guy is there to provide shoe cover for 10 Rupees as entering inside the tomb with shoes is not allowed.Overall u can easily skip this one!"
237,A Road Trip from Delhi to Agra,"This is an iconic building. The first muslim monument, built completely with marble and immense use of inlay work. Karan from Sachan Walking Tours helped us to understand the gradual development of Islamic buildings in India. Another lovely tour of Baby Taj."
238,A jewel box!,If you have the Taj Mahal on your list make sure you add Itimad-if-Daulah to the list. A delightful sight to see with the beauty and aura of any sight you will see. We also found the quietness of the location a real break from the bustle of other places.
239,Baby Taj,"It is a nice place to loll about for a while. But made all the more interesting by having a guide to tell you the astonishing story and subtleties of the development and history of this place; just fascinating and really enhances the experience, as it did for the many other places we visited in a full day in Agra (2 night stay)."
240,great historical visit!,"Small structure, not well kept or managed compared to the Taj Mahal. Maybe as a side show to your Agra day trip but don‚Äôt make it a destination."
241,Baby Taj,"In some ways the Etmad-ud-daulah monument is even more beautiful than the Taj and I specifically refer to the inlay work. However, hooliganism by tourists and, may be, nature, is spoiling this beautiful architectural heritage."
242,A hidden jewel!,Absolutely beautiful tomb. Well worth the effort. Spend some time admiring this little jewellery box. lots of lovely picture opportunities.
243,Loved it,The Tomb is set in a a marble building thought to be the example for the Taj Mahal. There are mosaics in geometric patterns of inlaid coloured stones around the tomb while the perforated screens are made of marble which would explain why the construction took over 6 years to complete - the craftmanship is stunning. The structure is square with minarets at each corner. The tomb chamber itself has a painted and gilded roof while the tombs although marble look like wood.
244,Baby Taj ,You will regret or may be not ( because you don't know what you have missed). I would rate it's detailing above the Taj. I mean my words.
245,OK if in Agra,"Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah is a Mughal mausoleum and is also referred to as Baby Taj. This tomb was made by Jahangir‚Äôs wife Nur Jahan, for her father Mirza Ghiyas Beg.The mausoleum is set in a large cruciform garden, criss-crossed by water courses and walkways. The walls are being made by white marble which are encrusted with semi-precious stone decorations like cornelian, jasper, lapis lazuli, onyx, and topaz. The intricate work on the marble is certainly noteworthy."
246,Beautiful Baby Taj,Tomb of itimad ud Daulat is in Moti Bagh in Agra .It was a mausoleum actually . One can visit the place if in Agra and have time and interested in history . It resembles Taj Mahal and also called baby Taj
247,An Excellent Monument,"Known ans the baby Taj, entirely in marble, rather than sandstone. It was the first Mughal building created  There are steps so those of limited mobility should be aware. Simliar to Jehangir tomb in Lahore."
248,Baby Taj,"Mini Taj(Baby Taj) is a  Mughal mausoleum in the city of Agra located on the eastern bank of the Yamuna River. It is also called Tomb of I'timƒÅd-ud-Daulah.Along with the main building, the structure consists of numerous outbuildings and gardens. The walls are made up from white marble."
249,Extraordinary,"Historically important, architecturally among must see, practically neglected. But one should pay a tribute to the makers nonetheless."
250,Beautiful Parchinkari,"One of the most revered monuments in Agra, this monument is a must see for all tourists. A local guide can be very helpful but you should bargain the rates before the tour."
251,Beautifuk,Poorly run and maintained site with a lot of  people roaming around in predatory way - incl. the slipper people- destroying any atmosphere . Hot in April and no drinks facility that's right. Not enough interpretation. Strict rules re- no tripods we overheard.
252,A beautiful pious monument,"This is located in Fatehpur Sikri, about 50 km from Agra. The tomb is made from white marble and has beautiful carvings. It is dedicated to a famous Sufi saint who was revered by great Mogul king Akbar. Many people come here to pray and ask for fulfilment of their wishes."
253,Stunning!!,"Must visit for history buffs. The first time I visited this place, i had no clue about the story behind it and I passed it off as just another monument. This time, i read up and was enthralled ! The rag-to-riches story was truly interesting ! Google for more ;)"
254,"A replica, beautifully crafted","This is a beautiful monument. This pre-dates Taj Mahal and it is very apparent that Taj Mahal was inspired by this Tomb.It is very well maintained and preserved. The coloured precious stones are still intact on most of the walls, unlike Taj where Britishers took away all precious gems.The place is quite and serene and very few tourist around.This along with Mahtab Bagh, is a must visit place in Agra."
255,Baby Taj,A wonderful architectural delight...beautiful and well cared for by the locals.  Met some delightful fellow travelers with whom we shared tea
256,Pre Taj Mahal - Baby Taj,"This funerary monument was built by the same architect of the Taj Mahal, several years before. Many elements of the architecture relate to older islamic architecture like the ceiling corners, similar to some in the Alhambra in Spain, but also some elements that are later used for the Taj. Is interesting to get a tour guide to do this visit as they can explain in detail what you will see.Some people call this the 'Baby Taj'. I think it is a terrible name! The buildings are not even really related."
257,Third place visited during tour,"Marvellous site, really worth the visit. TIP! There's a stroppy old man with a white moustache who yells at you to not carry your own shoes when you go inside the mausoleum. That's because he wants to charge you to look after them. You don't have to. It's not a busy site so you can take lovely pictures through to the Yamuna. The marble work is very beautiful, the whole thing is a gem."
258, It is a nice place,"A must visit when you come to Agra. The tomb of Noorjahan's father and mother are not very big, this place would draw your appreciation due to its excellent worksmanship of the tomb and and the building."
259,A saml jewel,"The empress Nur Jahan (Jahangir's favorite wife) built this small, gorgeous tomb for her father, Mirza Ghiyas Beg (pronounced Baig), a Persian nobleman who became Jahangir's chief minister. Beg was also the grandfather of Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of the emperor Shah Jahan. The monument, one of Agra's loveliest, was supposedly built by workers from Persia. The tomb incorporates a great deal of brown and yellow Persian marble and marks the first use of Persian-style marble inlay in India‚Äîboth features that would later characterize the style of Shah Jahan. Particularly in its use of intricate marble inlay, this building was a precursor of, and very likely an inspiration for, the Taj Mahal (for this reason it has earned the somewhat goofy nickname of the ""Baby Taj"")."
260,BEAUTIFUL PLACE,The place made me astonished with its architecture ... I mean so advance in those days ... I loved visiting the place
261,Beautiful,"A little off the beaten track, this delightful mausoleum is well worth a visit. Peaceful and beautiful."
262,Mini Taj! Infact it‚Äôs more beautiful ,"Baby Taj as its also known is actually older than Taj Mahal itself. When viewed from afar, it does look pretty disappointing but it has a serene beauty of its own. Its marble inlay work is of a different design from those found on Taj Mahal. There isn't as much visitors here so its pretty calm."
263,Nice Experience,"This predates the well known Taj Mahal. I will not give a 'spoiler' - just go and view this well preserved monument. However allow a bit of time and look at the painstaking, loving craftmanship."
264,Miniature Taj Mahal,"This is a mausoleum that enshrines the remains of Mumtaz Mahal's parents, her first husband and first child plus her close lady in waiting. This was a piece of history that I didnt know whereby she had an earlier marriage. All the while she had been associated with Shah Jahan and the Taj Mahal. The building is a smaller version of Taj Mahal and with lesser architectural finery when compared to Taj Mahal. Nevertheless the architecture is very much like that of Taj Mahal where Iranian workmanship can be seem on the walls. Scriptures were crafted into the stones of the wall and the way the mausoleum was built ensured that the 4 corners be used to entomb the related figures to Mumtaz. You cant leave Agra without seeing this."
265,spectacular,"I loved exploring the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah and could have spent hours here. The details in the design are incredible. We arrived here at around half past 9 in the morning and it was lovely and quiet, which only added to the serenity of the place.Definitely one to visit while in Agra."
266,Little Taj ,"To really appreciate it. Otherwise, it will look not interesting, by comparison. But, by itself, it is a small gem."
267,Beautiful,"Though it doesn't have the grandeur architecture, or the beautiful love story behind the Taj Mahal. But the Taj Mahal's inspiration originate from this. Love the design (though simpler), but it embellished well on this building, making it stands out uniquely."
268,Loved this place,"It is erroneously called the mini-Taj, but this is a diffferent monument in itself with a distinctive character. There is a gallery next to the ticket counter and it is advisable to read all about this monument at the gallery before venturing inside."
269,visit there if you were free and nothing else to do!,It is very beautiful symetrical building which was buily by Norjahan. It was built before of Taj. Amaging .
270,Beautiful place of ‚ÄúBaby Taj Mahal‚Äù,"Many architectural Gurus have said that the design and construction of Itmad-ud-daullah is far superior to the Tajmahal. In my numerous visits, and stripped of an architectural degree in my hand, I am inclined to agree and believe the pundits. The megastructure of Tajmahal, the strategic location are you mesmerizing that people forget this Tomb. If you visit Agra, please do not forget to include Itmad-uid-daullah. If you do, it would be like going to Paris and skipping the (now under renovation) Notre Dam!"
271,A Gem,"the person this tomb was dedicated to was a persian amir in exile, a father-in-law of the 4th mughal emperor (jahangir) and a grandfather-in-law of the 5th mughal emperor (shah jahan) ! although it's not as big and grand as the taj mahal, it's cute and delicate, extensively decorated with white marble and patterns inside and out! it's also a transition piece from the red sandstone building  (the humayun tomb in delhi) to the white marble one (taj mahal). I personally think the wall decorations and patterns here are more beautiful than that of taj mahal."
272,Average it was,"The tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah in Agra also goes by another simpler name ‚Äì the Baby Taj. The Tomb of I'timad-Ud-Daulah is a masterpiece of the domeless class of Mughal tombs. It is the first building finished in white marble and marks the transitional phase from red stone to white marble, from Akbar's tomb Sikandra to the Taj Mahal. Behind the tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah is the Yamuna River. The Baby Taj is a great alternative sight to see in Agra, especially if you‚Äôre looking for something a little less crowded to see than the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort."
273,Marvel of Islamic architecture.,"Almost as beautiful as the Taj Mahal, the marble inlay work and decoration are very impressive.  Definitely worth a visit!"
274,Nice ,"This site, dubbed the ""Baby Taj"",  is a mausoleum that preceded the building of the Taj and became a model for some of its architectural and artistic concepts. If it's on a visitor's touring schedule it should be viewed before seeing the Taj."
275,nice place,"The entrance gate, gardens and exterior are impressive although the interior chambers are fairly ordinary.  The ornate exterior has some similarities to the Taj Mahal.  If visiting late in the day be warned that the stones are very hot when you remove your shoes."
276,"Just Nice:  Not Better Than the Taj - however, a very very nice building!!!!  Hidden Gem :)","Noorjehan , wife of Jahangir , built in honour of her father Ghiyasuddin Beg who was a powerful noble in the court of Badshah Jahangir . He earned the title Itimad ud Daulah means pillar of iron . A beautiful architectural marvel, it was supervised by Empress Noorjehan and is a must see attraction of Agra . Amolak Rattan Kohli"
277,The so Called Baby Taj,"This building is truly a work of genius.  The inlay work and symmetry make this one of the most beautiful buildings in all of India.  Missed by many visitors to Agra, I would highly recommend making time to see it."
278,much less crowded than taj,"The mausoleum faces the Taj Mahal on the opposite bank of the wide river. The nearby street is busy with traffic and sellers but you enter the mausoleum grounds in peace. In front of the building there are flooded gardens and without too many visitors its easy to take photos..A man dispenses shoe coverings and you climb onto the marble terrace. Inside the mausoleum there are four rooms, each with two tombs The outer walls are filled with intricate panels, some with pierced white marble, others with inlaid semi precious jewels in various botanical designs. Some restoration has taken place but it has been sympathetically addressed. The site benefits from its lack of visitors and it is only five minutes away from the main river bridge."
279,Must see,"Located on the east bank.Not a must see, and certainly not as striking as the Taj Mah...but also not as crowded."
280,Lovely Baby Taj,This is a very interesting place and time in History. I recommend a guide to help you make full use of your visit. They know small details that add charm and further understanding of the times and lives lived in those days. What's more? You'll also find a variety of deer that roam freely in the garden.
281,Baby Taj,Baby Taj - Itimad-ud-Daulah is a beautiful inlaid marble tomb of Mizra Ghiyas Beg.  The details of the parchinkari are stunning.  This is well worth the trip.  I also loved the Taj Mahal but this smaller tomb is well worth making time to see.
282,A great end to a hectic day,"Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah , described as a ""Jewel Box"" or as ""Baby Taj"" , in the city of Agra ,Uttar PradeshTomb of Itimad-ud-Daula is a  mausoleum situated on the Yamuna River just outside Agra, on the way of Sikandra.The favourable time would be from October till the end of March as the weather remains cool and is pleasant to travelIf you want really enjoy This monument Beauty Then ,  I must say that in Visit of ""Tomb Of Akbar"" in Sinkadra & Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah , visit in the same day .Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah And Taj MAhal NOT visit in same day because you can not much emphasizing The Beauty differencing between these two Monuments  Tickets - Different Tickets Charges Applicable For Adults, Children And FOREIGNERS And Citizens of SAARC/BIMSTEC(Free entry to children up to 15 years)Note: Foreign Visitors who purchase Agra Development Authority (ADA)‚Äôs Pathkar (Toll tax) ticket of Rs.500/- forTajMahal, need not to purchase any other Pathkar (Toll tax) ticket, if he/she visits the monuments viz. TajMahal, Agra Fort, FatehpurSikri, Akbar‚Äôs Tomb, Itimad-ud-Daulah‚Äôs tomb on the same day) .Must Have Hat /Cap  Water Bottles , extra bag for your Garbage/ Empty Bottles / Food Packets . Wear Easy / Comfortable Shoes .No Locker Room Available in This Place.This was the first Mughal structure built completely from marble, the first to make extensive use of pietra dura and the first tomb to be built on the banks of the Yamuna River.All Walls and Domes are accentuated with floral, geometric and animate motifs, the decoration of which is rivalled only by the profuse and varied depictions of these same motifs in colourful paintings and inlaid stone used to enhance the interior of the structure .It was constructed outside Agra‚Äôs city walls on the eastern bank of the Yamuna in a garden originally owned by Itimad-ud-Daula himself.Out The monuments The Space Of Parking Is less for Vehicles , so take some time  for parking and un-parking your vehicles ."
283,very nice,"The tomb is usually very quiet, and offers an unparalleled chance to examine truly gorgeous inlay work in the peace and reflective solitude that the crowds at Taj or Agra Fort don't let you have. When we went at midday on a Saturday, there were only a few dozen people in the whole complex, and it was much more serene (and clean!) than most places in Agra. The building is small, but exquisite, and offers a chance to see Iranian influences on Mughal aesthetic. It's a unique fusion of styles and motifs, and so, so worth it."
284,Good,"Loved it, loved it, loved it.A lot cheaper than the Taj Mahal plus you don‚Äôt have to pay the tax on the entrance fee if you have your TM or Red Fort ticket to hand.A lot less crowded and has very good gardens plus you can climb and wander a lot more freely.What I also got from this was sadness: not because this was an expression of someone‚Äôs love but rather because you can see the once mighty Yamuna river dwindling away (visit Delhi Red Fort as this will put some further context to how important the river was to the ruling Moghuls).Plenty you of wildlife to be seen and the artwork with its wonderful colours is stunning. Again this  sheds a whole new light on how the old buildings around Agra/Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan would once have looked."
285,Good whistle stop,"The tomb of Itimad-ud- Daulah's - nicknamed Baby Taj - is not as famous as Taj Mahal, but it's older in fact. It may be smaller than Taj Mahal, but it was built with the same marble inlay work for which Agra is famous. And the inside of this peaceful building may - dare I say it - even be more beautiful than Taj Mahal."
286,Over looking the river bank,"If you have time this is a good one to see, but if you're short of time don't stress. It's a nice precursor to visiting the actual Taj."
287,Baby Taj,It is a most refreshing and delicately embellished monument with some of the finest inlay work that can be seen anywhere in the world.It is a delight to visit this monument and marvel at the artisans and craftsmanship...sadly not many people visit this place but that makes it even more attractive to spend some time in a quite corner on the banks of Jamuna...
288,Yet another gorgeous site,"Tomb of I'timƒÅd-ud-Daulah is a Mughal mausoleum in the city of Agra in Uttar Pradesh. Often described as a ""jewel box"", sometimes called the ""Bachcha Taj"", the tomb of I'timƒÅd-ud-Daulah is often regarded as a draft of the Taj Mahal. But not many know till they reach is it is the exquisite tomb of Mizra Ghiyas Beg.  This Persian nobleman was Mumtaz Mahal‚Äôs grandfather and Emperor Jehangir‚Äôs wazir (chief minister). His daughter, Nur Jahan, married Jehangir. Must visit this place as it is on the way to Mehtaab Bagh as well"
289,Also Known as Baby Taj,I was thunderstruck when i saw the magnificence of this place. Everyone should see and admire it's beauty. Visit on the afternoon
290,Another amazing sight in Agra,"Built in the decade before the Taj Mahal was started, this tomb is considered the prototype for what was to follow. It is beautiful. Well worth the time and tiny cost of entry. Much of the techniques used in the decoration of the Taj Mahal can be seen here though not as extensively. Maybe visit this mausoleum before going to the Taj Mahal, take in the incredible architecture and then see how even this is relatively simple when compared to the Taj Mahal."
291,A really treasure,"The Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah, which is also called the mini Taj or the Baby Taj, is a must visit for those interested in Mughal history or architecture."
292,A jewel in the midst of Agra,Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah also referred as the baby (Taj Mahal) .It is a nice place to visit and has good old architecture and beautiful carvings and inlay work but this place is ignored and no tour guides are there to tell you about the history of the place but the place is worth a visit
293,Very nice,"The Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah was designed by the same person who also designed the Taj Mahal so you can see some similarities as you walk up the long walkway and see this tomb in the background - very similar to the Taj Mahal layout.   On either side of the Tomb, there are matching structures - also like the Taj Mahal.  Both the Tomb and the Taj Mahal have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage sites because of their historical significance.  When comparing the Tomb to the Taj Mahal, the Tomb has much more detail in the hand-carved marble that covers virtually the entire exterior walls - very nice!  The Tomb and the Taj Mahal are both very stunning structures to visit and look at and both of these beautiful monuments are located in the city of Agra.  Both of these Monuments are must see places to visit in India."
294,Mini Taj Mahal,"The tomb of Itimad-ud-daulah, also know as the baby Taj, is a very impressive tomb and well worth a visit.   Not as crowded as the Taj and much smaller, the craftsmanship used to build this tomb is just as good."
295,Another accessible site,"The Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah, also known as the Baby Taj or the Jewel Box, is yet another hidden gem in Agra. It is quiet and peaceful in comparison to the other Taj, but more than repays a visit. Apart from it being the first marble mausoleum built in India, it has wonderful gardens that are well worth your attention, and being located on the river, it has lovely views in all directions. The architecture of the tomb is very similar to its more famous namesake, but its hexagonal corner towers are shorter and the whole building is rather more square and squat in shape. None of these differences in any way detract from what is simply a stunning and beautiful building, however. The quality of marble, inlay work and carved screens are just perfect. Its history also makes fascinating reading, so do your homework before your visit!"
296,Peque√±a Taj,"It is a good example of  pieta dura or large inlay work, but it is visible from the Agra Fort road. Getting there is difficult, and the traffic is impossible."
297,Baby Taj,"Itimad-ud-Daulah is a Mughal mausoleum in the city of Agra in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Often described as Baby Taj, the tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah is often regarded as a draft of the Taj Mahal.Ticket: RS 300 per pax"
298,Absolutely gorgeous!,"While the Taj Mahal may be all about grandiose and magnificence, the Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah, is beautiful with its detailed and intricate work. It doesn‚Äôt see too many visitors so you can go anytime to see it."
299,Go here before the Tajmahal ,"The Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah, aka ""Baby Taj,"" is another example of the amazing architectural style of this era of Indian grandeur, as the mausoleum has many artistic and architectural details that make it stand out. For example, the chiselled windows, paint, fountains, and towers. This mausoleum is normally not included in the Taj Mahal tours. However, if you love architecture, tell your guide to include it in. The first time I visited the Taj Mahal back in 2014 the guide just showed it to me from a distance saying ""it is like the Taj, but smaller and nothing else to see."" Well, I had to be the judge of it and he was wrong. It is another remarkable edifice worth visiting."
