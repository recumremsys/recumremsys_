12,Eve.

Not only did I realised the meaning of this being registered in world records for the size of Adiyogi, but‚Ä¶"
34,Stupendous AdiYogi ,"It is a testimony of how immaculately an idea can be translated into reality. Sadhguru, the founder of Isha Foundation, promotes Yoga and considers Adi Yogi to be the first person to spread the idea of Yoga to the world. It is a symbolic way to create an awareness around that‚Ä¶"
35,Must visit,Our visit to adiyogi place was an inspiration and a kind of extreme Joy.  We visited standings. Had a wonderful dip in the surrounds of blissful place.
36,"If you Love Shiva, You'll love this place !!!",Visited on a weekday. It was not at all crowded. Had a peaceful time. The bust sculpture is simply magnificent. Beware of bees hive on the ear of the lord though.

39,The infrastructure of the whole campus too poor.,A beautiful place to visit and meditate . Excellent architecture . Must visit the Sri Shiva sanctum . Must also bath at the energy pool for different gender . So refreshing for the body and Soul .
40,Superb place never miss to visit it.,A must visit  place and calmness at it's best.Surrounded by western ghats there lies the ADI YOGI statue.
41,Massive structure in massive landscape,"visited Isha centre and stayed for a couple of days, ideal place for relaxing and to make your mind cool. they serve 2 meals a day with the room. "
42,A Calmness Around You ,"I am recommending this place For a small 2 to 3 hours relaxation trip in a calm location who is searching peaceful atmosphere.  BIG STATUE OF Lord siva for photographers, Big silent Hall for meditation.  Surrounded by nature(This peoples destroyed a huge area of forest)  other‚Ä¶"
43,Good,"Decent place near to coimbatore, worth a visit once. Meditiation and yoga class session were the highlight along with the Shiva statue obviously."
44,Great place to visit in Coimbatore ,"I visited this place as a part of group. There are guides to show us around the place. The whole visit started with depositing the shoes, mobile at the counter as it is not allowed inside the place. As a part of rituals it is necessary to take a dip in surya kund to get the energy level high. Than there are two temples or pran kendra one for Shiva and other for parvati. Though they have different names. Once you finish that, you can proceed to see the big statue of Adiyogi standing. I love the visit though it is tiring as one need to to walk in barefoot for long."
45,"Amazing, simply",A place one should visit if you are in the vicinity of Coimbatore. the surroundings are amazing.  Great place.
46,Shiva Statue ,"Plan for an hour trip outside of Coimbatore for a quiet visit to this peaceful place.   While the space is highly ‚Äúprescribed‚Äù (meaning you are directed along a path to locations in a certain order), it is definitely lacking the ‚ÄúDisneyland‚Äù feel of many large‚Ä¶"
47,Adiyogi Shiva,Excellent place to relax. With good greenary and calm place. Feeling more relaxed. Big statue is awesome.
48,Shiva...,What a painful existence if not being able to at least once experience such freedom and estacy in a life time
49,Must Visit,A very holy and nice place to visit.Situated in midst of mountain a very serene place to visit. Must place to visit for peace and mind and surrounding nature's beauty.
50,Peace with commercialism ,"Everyone should atleast visit once. This place so calm that one would feel like meditating. The idol of Lord Shiva stands so beautifully with the mountain range is background, one would feel like getting lost in the divine."
51,Blessed,I visited isha yoga centre for the Guru Pournima program. The ashram is a must see for anyone curious to experience a consecrated spiritual place.The Adiyogi bust statue is awe inspiring beyond words. There is a small shrine below the bust with a Linga and sapta seven rishis :)Must visit! üòÉ üëç
52,A mammoth monument of Shiva,Shivaaaa... Shivaa..Shiva. Abode the Best interaction with the Superme. enlightenment.  Experience the Best of Shiva. The chants keep you calm.  You can travel in a Bullock cart. For a price of 10/- per person. And in a golf cart for 50/- per person. But my suggestion. Don't Ur‚Ä¶
53,Beautiful,"Inside the Isha Yoga the place was somewhat dry and no proper guide or explanations, for a first timer we were a bit lost as we didn't understand many things that were going on. And also for the woman's holy water dip it would have been nice if there was a proper changing room‚Ä¶"
54,"Lord Siva 112 feet statue,",Well well designed and spacious.. The entry and exit roads are a bit cramped tough. Avoid weekends if possible
55,Magnificent statue,"For anyone who is looking to step onto a journey of spiritual awakening through the guidance of ancient Indian spiritual knowledge, this is the place."
56,Great location ,"Do you want to feel the greatness of the creation and the creator HIMSELF ( not fully,  but to try a bit),  then Please visit this place without fail.. If you are really a person of good understanding, then you will surely startAnd try to understand the vastness of the creation and the universe.. Yes. ..Let me explain.. A gigantic statue of around 110-120 feet tall (it's just up to the chest level statue)..We look like a very small ant when compared to that statue..Now comparing ourselves with the universe, we can understand how great the CREATOR is.. Nothing more to say... Just feel this.. You will become silent after returning from this place.."
57,Commercial not spiritual,I think this was conceptualized by Isha to pull in more crowds being a landmark attraction. Best time is to visit during sunsets for a nice breeze and a good click.
58,Must visit place,The worlds most peaceful place.many holly places in the world including Vetticon in Rome. Ajmeer in Rajasthan and many temples all over the world . Those who needs peaceful mind have to come here .This is my own experience .I myself visited all the places and find peace here‚Ä¶
59,Amazing and Peaceful Experience,Must visit and dip into theerathakund as it will tune the body and mind for meditation based on my personal experience
60,Isha foundation,"The Yoga Centre is different world than the usual. The environment, the ambience, the meditation centre  is ideal for Dhyan Yoga. While meditating, one is in a different world, very calm and quiet. Even from a tourist angle, the place is worth all the effort, the Adiyogi statue is beautiful in its simplicity."
61,Serene & Peace,"Photos do not do justice to how majestic Adiyogi looks in real life. With the 850m walk providing a selection of refreshments on the way including fresh coconut juice and various other snacks, it is perfect for a family experience."
62,Must be in bucketlist,"its a great work of Art, you should visit the place , take care of weather as in summers it can be very hot and humid."
63,Adiyogi symbolizes a meditative form of Shiva  Great place to visit (Swatch Temple),"Its good to visit this place, either solo, friends, couples , families.We can consider this place anyway like entertainment, temple, park, etc..Doing meditation in a calm place with a group is a different experience though"
64,I drove to this place from Bangalore directly,"Beatiful place, but far away from coimbator. Need your own vehical to travel. The Ashram is away from the city in the middle of coconut  orchard and at the foot hill. DIfferent architecture. One can pay and do some rituals. Otherwise fold your hands , sit near Dhyanalingum and return. For everything you need to pay. Including washroom! Clean and beautiful"
65,Place which is beyond imagination and peace of mind and body.  A holy and energetic environment to enjoy with devotion.,Magnificient Shiva ---but calm ....with meditation and poojas happening in the footstep..Lot of changes and improvements happening actively at Isha centre.Enjoyed Silence at Dhyana mandapam...I visited this time late evening. My nephew developed allergic reactions due to some ant/insect bite. Being a medico i immediately recognized that he needed some medications to contain his allergic reactions and sequelae. I was bit tense and enquired the people at Information centre..was told that medical centre would be closed by evening and was directed to Isha health centre which was not easy to find..being coimbatorian i have some idea about near by villages and took him to Alandhur with the help of locals guiding the route..Took IV medications from a clinic which releived his distress..Thank God..He is fine.I request the admin of the centre to consider this feedback as this place is surrounded by forests and high chances for insect stings and allergic reactions which sometimes are medical emergencies.
66,Marvellous statue of Adiyogi,"‚ÄúBetter to see something once than hear about it a thousand times‚Äù this was the travel quote which worked behind our decision to visit this mammoth statue on 10th March 2019 with friends and family after hearing much deliberations from our friends. As planned, we reached the destination at around 7.30 in the morning. While observing the statue we found that there is no need for any exclamation in mind about the capacity of this statue attracting thousands; Adiyogi statue is very much charismatic indeed.We took a walk around the statue proceeding towards yoga center by depositing our baggages, mobile phones at the entrance. This Yoga Centre is completely plastic/mobile/littering/hustle free, serene as well as holy. A gentle smile appears on every volunteer‚Äôs face and they welcome everyone with positive vibes. The fragrance dispensed in the air and the chants echoed in the locality added a nourishing feel to our mind, soul & body. As far as my mindset is concerned, Dhyanalinga temple is a place which we should never miss at the Yoga Centre coz the total set up is created to squeeze out our internal peace by sitting there without any movements and thoughts. Please be noted that a normal cough or sternutation will be unbearable during the 15 minutes hardcore meditation session in that Dhyanalinga temple. We had a wonderful time there and pepper wine eatery caters delicious food in degradable plates. I am of the view to learn remaining silent and smile is to be included in the academic curriculum. We all forget our amours which we have within ourselves relating to  our social status, financial soundness, political power, family back ground, qualifications, physical appearance, job etc etc which will be very much beneficial  and I am damn sure, visiting these types of places will surely help us to break these amours & to find our ‚Äúinner space‚Äù."
67,Not impressed,Worth visiting for spiritual growth and experience of bliss. One must visit Devi temple and Dhyanlinga along with Adi Yogi. Also take dip in the Surya Kund.
68,Adiyogi,Silent place and they teach meditation and good you will find peace and it is located below hills and nature cool weather.
69,Nice place,"This was the 1st place i visited when reaching india, and it was the most spiritual one too! upon arriving, i saw this big statue of shiva. walked around, saw devotees all the way through, and there was prayers going on.  People were also meditating around the statue.  Then i walked over to another place, and this is where the real magic was! no phone was admitted beyond this point.  1st went to some kind of lake, with a shivling, there was a swami and a devotee in the water.  The latter was swimming to the middle of the lake to the shivling for prayers. it was unbelievably calm and relaxing.  then i went to another place, where devotees were requested to sit down for 5 minutes and relax, in the hope of reaching a stage of meditation.  this was THE experience of the place. absolutely awesome and spiritual place."
70,peachfuul place,"Must visit place. Out of the world experience. The location, the background, Jet black Adiyogi Shiva...Oh My GOD...it‚Äôs just perfect...Anyone will easily fall in love with the Adiyogi....The calm, smiling face of Shiva makes you sit right in from front of him for hours together. I just did not feel like getting out of that place. The background is surrounded by Vellangiri mountains which adds to the beauty. There are some natural waterfalls you can see which appears like a silver lining on the mountains.With blue sky and Velliangiri mountains in the background...Adiyogi just looks stunning...A big salute to SADGURU and his entire team for this brilliant thought and efforts they have put in to make ADIYOGI a reality."
71,Mesmerizing view of Adiyogi,Went to Isha foundation with friends. Very neat and calm place. Highly perfect for following daily healthy rituals. Lucky to be present in First Sermon by Sadhguru. He addressed Public for the first time in the year 2020. Tempted to extend my stay. But could not stay. Will‚Ä¶
72,must visit place,"This is a good place to visit when you visit the Isha Dhyanalinga temple - located just on the opposite side of the road to Isha temple , this is a place which religious people and tourist people like alike. This is a huge statue in the middle of a well cleared land which‚Ä¶"
73,Serene and peaceful.,"This belongs to lord shiva... When you see it... you find yourself in a new world.. I had to go there recently with my family members... It's not very far from airport... We reached there within 1 hour.. Very beautiful and must visit place,, if you are going Coimbatore..."
74,Beautifully crafted ,"The huge portrait of lord Shiva, would just make you feel out of the world. Serene beauty with lush green landscapes is a feast to eyesüôÇ"
75,Pleasant Feel,"The place is so charged up with energy, takes one into trance so easily! I travel to this place every 3 months. The locale is very scenic - green all over! This is adjacent to the Isha Yoga Centre, another must visit place."
76,"Jai Shambho, Jai Bholenath . .  .!!!","This is nice place to visit, no tickets for Darshan. Very neat and clean . This is under maintenance from Isha fondataion .. there is bull raid car also so that one remains as village culture.. "
77,Mesmerizing large dark statue,"What is not to love. Was at Mahashivaratri 2019. The experience was one of bucket list proportions. The energy, music, ambiance and of course Sadhguru were off the charts! Prior to Mahashivratri, the walkway to and from Adiyogi were lined with mobile shops, selling various food and drinks. We stayed it ISHA itself, in Mansarovar class. Great experience all around!"
78,Mesmerizing,Adiyogi is located at Dhyanlinga temple in Isha center. One may feel spiritual vibes at this place & lots of positivity scattered around.
79,31 August 2019,"which was once a peaceful and calm area a few years back is filled with crowd..foothills of vellingiri, .the statue is a good sculpture work.."
80,Symbol of Divine,"We spent about 4 hours at this facility and experienced meditation and prayer. Sadhguru, the founder of the Isha Fiundation is a very learned person and an author of a New York Times best seller called ‚Äú inner engineering - a yogis guide to joy‚Äù. A must read book! We were shown‚Ä¶"
81,Devotional place,I discovered this place thanks to our driver Jai. Very nice place but how hot it is ... very clean. It is unfortunate that the carpark is so far from the dhyanalinga ashrama.
82,Amazing place,This place has great strength which provides you Calmness and inner peace. This place is located outside Coimbatore and travel time is about 1 hour. Surrounding is great. Place provide paid parking. Statue of Adiyogi is sublime and calm. There are snacks and tea stalls inside.‚Ä¶
83,One of my favourite place to visit.,As you all know india is birth place for yoga and isha yoga is doing a good job in coimbatore situated under velliangiri hills with greenish and cold climate bringing a relief for our soul
84,No words to describe.. Just feel it,"It is mind blowing place, the vibration is very different here, too calm, very much clean, we felt like we are at heaven"
85,Absolutely GREAT,Amazing sculpture and a mind blowing ambience makes it an unforgettable experience.. Early morning is the best time climate wise.. 
86,View if from the top of Velliangiri hill ..!,This is one of a kind experience and without a visit your trip to Coimbatore can never be complete. Better to book accomodation early in the Centre itself.
87,Must visit place in Coimbatore,Do booking to stay overnight at the aashram.  Day trip would be very tiring and not let you feel the energy created by sadguru. 
88,Must place to visit,This is one of the parts of your visit to the Isha foundation. On one side of the road is the ashram (incl. Dhyanlinga temple) and on the other side is the mighty statue of lord shiva in the adiyogi form. It is 5-7 mins of walk from the end but the option of bullock cart is also available for a nominal charge. The statue stands with all its might in the natural surroundings comprising of vast open spaces. Looking at the statue makes one feel like the Shiva himself is present. There is one small temple in front of the statue where one can offer prayers
89,Rexaling.. ,Nice place to visit with friends and family also I enjoyed a lot with my friends thank you so much I plan to visit again soon
90,Awe Inspiring,The adiyogi is situated in a place where it‚Äôs surrounded by mountains and as u keep going closer it gets on to you and it‚Äôs beautiful - try going early morning or evening . It‚Äôs very hot or prefer a rainy season
91,Serene experience,Attended 1 dhyan session. it is life changing I can say. I hired a car for 8 hours and visited the place.
92,Mind if you want peaceful mind.,Though great piece of structure but at the  same time giving serene feeling when you go closer to Shiva. If you are in Coimbatore don't miss a chance to visit Adiyogi and Isha Foundation. Do spare four to five hours and feel spirituality in the atmosphere.
93,om namasivaya,As part of ISHA Yoga we walked for 10 min to this immense place.Very well done and great to visit.Take some tome out and visit the whole temple etc etc of the ISHA place.
94,A must visit temple. ,Nice place to Meditation Pray  Eat good canteen available inside Selfi or photo with big Aadiyogi statue Cart riding (per head 10) Well enjoyed one full day  
95,Peaceful and beautiful place to visit,"On our second day at the Isha Yoga center in Coimbatore we decided to elk over and visit the Adiyogi Statue. This was the rainy season in Coimbatore so periods of sunshine, strong gusts of winds and rain showers would alternate one another every few minutes. The Adiyogi statute is located about 1 km. from the main Isa Yoga Center - we brought our umbrellas but the intermittent gusts of winds often turned the umbrella inside out. The rain showers alternating with sunshine meant that we were blessed to see many rainbows arching across the adjacent Majestic Vellangiri hills as we walked. I wore my dhoti - in spite of the umbrella the winds blew the rain diagonally and I was soaked but the dhoti was made of fine cotton so the moment the sun came out the dhoti dried rapidly. As so many have written the Adiyogi statute was awesome ; the sculptor had done a perfect job of capturing a serene appearance of Lord Shiva gazing at the heavens. The statue is 112 feet high to illustrate that there are 112 ways to attain moksha. The statue wears a long chain made of many strings of rudraksha beads. I said my Om Trimbakam prayers as I cicumbulated the Adi Ugi statue. In front of the statue is a small shrine housing the Yogeswara Linga. We then sat down with other devotees, listened to Sadguru‚Äôs taped mantra played repeatedly as we meditated silently."
96,adiyogi,The Adiyogi statue is good ..but having heard many people talk about it we expected probably too much .. 
97,excellent place to re fresh your mind,"Magnificent statue, very soothing feeling. The Isha Yoga area covers a lot of space including Meditation centers, place for short/long stays...."
98,Isha Yoga Centre,It was so damn peaceful and calm. You can meditate without any disturbance and would only hear chants.
99,Spectacular,"its a place situated inside a forest, surrounded by western ghats mountain. its a  good place to go for a picnic for friends, family, couples. But if you are looking for spiritual feeling..sorry. you can go and sit it in any temples for that not here."
100,A place for mental peace,It's an wonderful place of religious importance recently built by Isha foundation in the Sylvania ambience of western that's of Tamilnadu..the location adds value to the centre
101,beautiful,"Good to see, Must visit place. Alongwith Siva statue; one can visit Ishayoga (Dhyanlingam) Located at the footsteps of mountains."
102,Another Spiritual experience in India,Good very good atmosphere.peaceful dhiyana Mulayam.but the walkable distance is more.Requirrd free vechicle transport.
103,Adhiyogi,Folks visiting Coimbatore should plan a visit of Isha Yoga Center. Blissful location with the serene surrounding.
104,Mesmerizing bust of Adiyogi,Took A bullcart ride to Adiyogi and enjoyed the great view of the area. It was really Windy and the statue looks great with the setting it was erected in.
105,New World,"Adiyogi shiva, beautiful place, we enjoy few hours here, overall good atmosphere , but not so cool atmosphere, because we visit here in a hot season, "
106,feel peace... experience nature also....,"If you make a visit to Isha Yoga Centre you can also visit Adiyogi Shiva , its in the same property, you can easily spend a whole day in this Isha Complex , Adiyogi Shiva can be visited early in the morning or in the evening when there is no direct sunlight, because it is  in a‚Ä¶"
107,Spiritual place to visit,I visited the place recently with my friends and we all love that the place . The place was peaceful and and if given an option we would like to go again.
108,Peace and serenity ,"my self visit my family and frds it was amazing trip for us full day enjoyed there .....thiyanalinga , lingbairavi, chandragunda ...peaceful place in velliyangriri foothills    very nice place to vist "
109,Amazing Infrastructure and pure divine,"Adiyogi shiva, a must visit place to enjoy few hours, large area of sceneries and big adiyogi statue, superb"
110,See it to Believe it,This place is so peaceful and the Adiyogi Shiva Statue is so beautiful and calming. Extremely pleasant experience
111,one of its kind,We have been there this week !! Very impressive and a great experience.A must have in Coimbatore. Will never forget this.
112,Amazing Structure,Wonderful sculpture. Please try to visit in early morning. Make sure you finish your visit before ten to avoid extreme heat.
113,The Yogi Adobe,In the lap of the Seven Mountains a great place to visit. Adiyogi alongwith Dhyanalinga is a must visit place for followers of Shiva and even for others..
114,Excellent place to spend time with family,"We have been visiting the Adiyogi for about 6days now, since we have been living at the Isha Ashram for a week. All i can say is AWESOME any other word/words fail this experience. I have walked to the Adiyogi as early as 6am then also in the afternoons and then around sunset too. In that respect IF you can manage an early morning visit then you get less crowds, good weather, peaceful atmosphere Combine it with the chants from the temple on the stairs it is breathtaking.The aftermoons and evenings are great too if you are ok with crowds trying to click selfies and pictures lots of  noise in the background etc. To be honest i dint mind the crowd too much as being an Indian I am used to this. I hope you are blessed by the lords grace and warmth when you visit the site. Om Namah Shivai"
115,Excellent place!,The feel is amazing to be standing next to this huge monument. Makes you think beyond this engineering marvel located about 50 km from the city of coimbatore.this is a part of the Isha Yoga Centre and this is my 3rd trip to this place. It leaves you spell bound looking at this magnificient structure.
116,Bholenath,"The structure is magnificent, completely made of steel and gives you a divine feeling. Surrounded by greenery Adiyogi stands alone and can be sighted from a long distance. A must visit place in Coimbatore."
117,Spiritual and blissful,"Good pleace to visit, around 35 minutes form the main town. Plan to spend 2-3 hours at least. Very spiritual and quite place "
118,Second biggest Shiva in India,"A total waste of a trip. The organization of this tourist attraction is very poorly run. Be warned before going. There is no clear direction. There is no translator. There is no one to help you. I have been to several ashrams around the world and was shocked to see the lack of organization. There is not even a visitor's desk or help desk. Only Tamil is spoken so do not expect any guidance or help from locals.  In fact, i was surprised to encounter how unpleasant people were and unwilling to help. It's a nice statue but not worth the terrible experience otherwise."
119,The first yogi Shiva surrounded by beautiful Velliangiri hills!,Could not explain any better.. we have reached by evening.. what  a majestic look surrounding the green hills.. even we could see water streams from far away in those green hills. It was  great enjoyment being there .. worth every penny and effort to go there.. highly‚Ä¶
120,Largest Bust sculpture award for a reason,A beautiful and bright atmosphere very conducive to yoga and meditation. There is a consecrated lingam at the place. 
121,Sath Guru,"That ""112 feet Shiva statue"" in amid of hills and lush green nature. So soothing for the eye to see and heart to feel. A place where if u don't visit by yourself u won't know the essence of it. Such a lovely beautiful place in this Earth. No words to describe the Shiva statue in‚Ä¶"
122,The First Yogi!,Isha Yoda best place for dhyanam in Coimbatore. Good environment and calm place. We can spend the time with family. 
123,So hot!,this is such a beautiful serene place and definetly a must visit who ever in coimbatore.. the view is simply superb as from three side you will see mountains...
124,very peaceful ambience,"Fabulous addition to the centre is a sculpture .. huge image Of shiva in meditation. The really nice part is the setting .. with the surrounding hills on which one can spot some waterfalls. Good alternative for people handicapped or who just don‚Äôt want to walk, is to hop on a bullock-driven carriage to the main Isha yoga centre and the gift shop (Which we always check out) the staff are friendly and it‚Äôs a tourist friendly place to spend some time in meditation or just to walk around and take in the ambience ‚ù§Ô∏ècan buy some interesting food if so inclined."
125,Very touristy,"A little touristy with the oxen carts, golf buggies and souvenir stalls but still a calm place to visit."
126,You are one with the divine here!,"Location is extraordinarily beautiful,worth visiting  The quality of the sculpture made looks so magnificent,one feels ‚ÄúOm Namah Shivay‚Äù  Only care to be taken is that you should not venture in walking when the sunshine is strong,say between-10 am and 3 pm  The flooring is very‚Ä¶"

128,Surreal Experience!!!,"Wnderful atmosphere , very calm and serene. Shiva statue is just amazing. little far from town but a must visit place. either visit early morning or evening "
129,Standing till sky,"Though it is quite far from the main city (about 45 kms), but it is worth the visit. Extremely peaceful - surrounded by hills on all sides. Must visit!"
130,Divine experience,Sath Guru has become a prominent spiritual leader in India and is also very well known internationally especially for his talks on numerous subjects. Make sure you visit the covered in ground pool to obtain that very special feeling of bliss.
131,A spiritual and magnificent destination,An amazing place. Worth the visit.... travel from Mauritius and came to Coimbatore mainly for Adi Yogi. Offering Jal to shiv linga and once done the most interesting part is the Kala Dhaga wish fulfilling thread same needs to be tied up in the trishul. One must try the coconut water.
132,Nice place to Visit.,It's a must see place if visiting Coimbatore... it's huge and build beautifully... surrounding is full of open land and you can click pictures with your family...as mentioned it's a must see place
133,Divine,"It is situated in a very serene place, which makes us to go into a trance with Lord Shiva, worth a visit. Must place to visit when in coimbatore."
134,The bullock cart ride to Adiyogi,"When we visited the place where the Yogi statue is made, made me feed good inside.  This could be my imagination, but that is what I felt.  We took pictures and also spend some time sitting in the prayer place.    While being slightly away from main Coimbatore, we felt that the‚Ä¶"
135,A must visit,"You need to walk a bit far from main gate of Isha Yoga Centre, else you can take bullock carts or buggy to reach Adiyogi StatueYou can visit cool water pool with Shiva lingas ; visit Linga Bhairavi temple and lastly enjoy the meditation session for 15-20 mins"
136,Beautiful Adiyogi Statue,"As you all might have seen on TV or the internet, it is surely a HUGE sculpture with a few awards tagged to it.112 Feet Tall, weighing 500 tonnes. (Heard that 1 Lakh Rudraksha's were used to make the Rudraksha garland around the neck. Just a rumor, might be false.)A mesmerizing view and a great place to visit at least once.Ample car parking space and almost well organized. Has a little work and maintenance to be done. Commercialized due to lots of shops near the place, but it is needed as it is on the outskirts and nothing could be found nearby.But overall an absolute delight to visit in the evening time around 5 to 7."
137,Magnificent!,This is not a tourist spot but the AdiYogi statue is imposing and one cannot but be awed by the same.  This is in the vicinity of the Dhyanalinga and Bhairavi temples associated with Isha Yoga Centre.  Absolutely worth visiting for spiritual reasons as well as for the excellent‚Ä¶
138,Superb,The concept here is that Lord Shiva is the first human being who had achieved the ultimate in yoga and was the mentor to the Saptarishi n have shown 112 ways of achieving moksha. Hence the bust of Adiyogi is 112 feet
139,Vastness of the creation makes us dumbstruck with eyes widening.. ,"If you are in Coimbatore and have some spare time of 2 to 3 hours, you must visit  Adiyogi Shiva temple by Isha Foundation of Shri Sadhguru. The very first sight of huge Shiva idol visible from long distance touches your heart with spiritual feeling. The Shivlinga located in‚Ä¶"
140,Busy but Peaceful,Very amazing bust of ADIYOGI SHIVA.. Well conceived art form. Difficult to imagine the way it has been shaped up. Will remain as a landmark of the locality. Recently introduced evening  light show is the one NOT TO BE MISSED..
141,Om Namah Shivay,"This is my second visit to Isha and first visit with my dad, a must visit place.   My dad liked this place lot and told me that places also kept well maintained.  I request all people who visit Coimbatore, please do visit Isha without fail..."
142,The Stupendous Shiva Statue,"Travelled from Palakaad on friends recommendation. It is quite a ride by car (couple of hours) with plenty to see along the way. Well worth stopping at the roadside coconut vendors for some refreshment.The temple statue is quite spectacular set in rolling fields with a back drop of hills. There is a small souviener stall and info on the yoga centre.We visited on a hot sunny day and there is almost no shade so water, hats and suncream are a must. The only downside to our visit was the very hot steps that you climb barefooted to reach the bottom of the statue."
143,Awesome and unique,This is 112 feed shiva statue surrounded by hills and natural beauty.This is very energetic and motivational place.Near is Esha yoga centre one must visit and meditate here for some time.
144,Engaged at Adiyogi,"Its soul searching place. After reaching here the ambience the cool breeze makes you sit hit and admire Adiyogi for hours, one feel so relaxed and nirvana. A must visit place both in morning and late evening. One can carry along camera/dslr and also have some own food here (in case planning to stay quite long)."
145,Mesmerizing,Great location when I enter in the valley of Coimbatore and reach that place my experience is amazing spiritual and difficult to express in words. I just fell and experienced that movement
146,Wov - What a great location NOT to MISS,One of the tallest Shiva statue and must see for visitors. The place is well managed and can be visited by people.  Photography is allowed here. 
147,AMAZING!!,Very good tourist spot specially who are inclined for Yoga.  The status of Shiva is amazing and a very beautiful scenic place.  Must visit place.
148,Shiva shakti,A very good scenic place to visit. Adhiyogi with the backdrop of western ghats offers a superb view.
149,Mahashivaratri Surreal Experience!,This place is huge and the Adiyogi is standing there kingly. A place which will give you a tremendous peace.
150,Better to see something once than hear about it a thousand times,The Adiyogi is a place associated with ISHA.   In the south it is linked to the famous Guru Jaggi Vasudevan and his school of shiva thatva.   The temple has a famous linga and linga bairavi.   Both are given equal importance during fesitivites and poojas. Nadabrahma is a method‚Ä¶
151,New Laser show is Awesome!!!,"Had been to Dhyanalingam earlier but this was my first visit after inauguration of the beautiful , and enormous Shiva's statue..The Adiyogi ( The first yogi) . This ""bust"" is one of the worlds largest one at a towering 110 ft and is seen from quite a far place. Somehow , as soon as I land here ,  I have always felt out of the world of mortals and moving into a soulful journey . The 5 minutes we spend inside the dhyanalingam in padmasan meditation , is one of the most private moments I have experienced. Once done , the whole mind gets refreshed ..something like a reset button pressed in our subconscious. I have felt this each and every time I set foot outside the place.One lands in the entrance from where Adiyogi is seen and you walk around a km inside before you are in touching distance of this engineering marvel. From there u walk into the Ishayoga premises where you finally land up at the Dhyanalingam . The whole premises is filled with Sadgurus teachings and a sense of contentment around.Whenever you feel that the world is eating into you , take a break and drive to this place and become one with your inner self"
152,Spare time and visit ,"Awesome place , very energizing , Adiyogi Shiva statue is a must watch . The place looks very rustic and peaceful , they have huge place for parking , volunteers are helpful."
153,amazing place,It took is around 1hour to reach from out Hotel Zibe. The area is well maintained with ample parking and and beautifull weather . There are food stalls as you walk from the statue to the Isha foundation. However i would recommend eating inside the isha foundation at the their‚Ä¶
154,Magnificent...Amazing ,A great experience to be there in Sadhguru 's presence for the Guru Purnima 2019.A lot of people yet the intensity.
155,Spiritual place!,"This is one of the places I have ever felt to be pure divine and spiritual. This is situated at 25 Kms from Comibatore under the foothills of Velenagiri Mountains. The entire time spent there was worth it. There is no enty fee into the premises. There are primarily two attractions, one is the dhyanlingam and the other the divine structure of Adiyogi Shiva. Before getting into the dhyanlingam, it is advisable to take a holy dip in the kunds (Tanks) specifically for males and females. Suryakund for males and chandrakund for female. There is a nominal charge of INR 20 for the attire to get into before proceeding to the kunds. It is suggested to take the holy dip. Its not just refreshing but also stabilizes your body energy. After the holy dip one can proceed to the Dhyanlingam for the meditation. This is the place where your mind, body and soul gets synced. There are souvenir shops as well as canteens for food. Do nto miss the laser light show during the evening at Adiyogi Shiva though it is conducted only on selected days."
156,When Shiva himself stands tall infront of you,"Amazing place to be in the foot hills. it was too hot, still we loved the place and dont mind even going again. The Adi Yogi Bust is one of the largest and mesmerizing. The Kund is awesome..."
157,Part of Aadhilinga ,"Peaceful vibrations! Huge Shiva, Adi Yogi! We must congratulate the maker! What expressions are brought here in the face! Salute & pranams to Sadguruji, who invoked the deity!"
158,"Great work, very soothing feeling",The place is enthralling. Ignore the crowd and concentrate on Shiva. It's a bliss. I drove for 6 hours from Chennai to visit this place. It is just 40 kms away from Coimbatore Airport bdw. The Siva's statue is mesmerising. You'd want to sit and meditate (or atleast relax) for‚Ä¶
159,Poor experience..read on,"It will be rightful to say that this statue is completely in the lap of nature,surrounded by mountains,,coconut trees,.The natures view is picturesque from here.ISHA foundation has maintained it very well.  This 112 ft statue is of lord shiv,‚ÄùADIYOGI‚Äù. The amavasya and poornima‚Ä¶"
160,Peace and tranquility,"Located in the mid of farm lands in the backdrop of the western ghats, its a must visit place near Coimbatore. Very calm. Suggest visiting it early in the morning (around 8am) or around 5pm in the evening to avoid hot sun or better carry umbrella or hats."
161,First visit so excited ,"Wonderful place with modern temple created by Sadhguru based on ancient Indian culture. Meditation is easy in this place situated in Vellangiri Hills (Dakshin Kailash) away from digital technology. No cell phones allowed in campus, restricted timings for food service, though snack outlet is available. Lovely environment"
162,Amazing Views and silent sound experience,Far from a distance when you see this huge Shiva idol with a backdrop of beautiful western ghats you will fell in love with this place. The carvings and beauty of this masterpiece is unmatchable. I still cant get over it.
163,‚ÄúBeautiful place in the lap of mountains‚Äù,"Surreal Experience ever on my birthday! I felt so lucky to spend my special day at Adiyogi. I had booked Ola Cab which had a facility to pickup and drop back - Isha foundation package cab. Driver was so helpful and he made our trip a memorable one. I cannot express my experience through words, as one should go there and feel the bliss. Looking at the huge adiyogi statue - i am sure you will forget all your worries and sorrows. At the end you will only attain that complete satisfaction after being on the divine land, full of positive and wonderful vibes around."
164,Om namo shivaay,"Around 1.5 hrs drive from CBE airport..Attractions: Adiyogi statue, holy bath and main temple..Total time except travel: minimum 3 hrs Park near Adiyogi statue at the official parking lot.."
165,A monument beyond imagination,"The Place Aadiyoga is place of peace and sround of Nature,place is realy intresting and its want to steel hear for a long time for distroy of daily routine tensons.must visit Thanks GURUJI"
166,Adiyogi Shiva centre,"Isha centre is away from the hustle bustle of the industrial town of Coimbatore. I visited this place as a part of my official tour to Coimbatore. I had no idea about the place and thought it was just about the statue. We reached at about 6 PM when the sun had still not set. We spent a good amount of time around the statue of Adiyogi capturing its various profiles as the sun set behind the hills that constitute the backdrop. The small open temple in front of the Adiyogi statue had a group of young girls (probably volunteers) chanting mantras in the praise of Shiva. This added a unique tranquility to the place.We walked to the Isha centre through a pathway behind the statue. The statue is a recent addition and maybe therefore there seemed to be a bit of 'under construction' feeling as we approached the pathway to the Isha Ashram behind the statue.The main entrance of the Isha Ashram was majestic and aesthetic. The architectural beauty of the place, the horticulture planning and the elements used in constructing the place are simply fabulous.Once inside the complex, we walked through an array of shops selling knick knacks and souvenirs (some of which were quite expensive). We were required to submit our phones and shoes before entering the temple complex. They enter your details in a computer and use technology to ensure that you don't misplace your prized belongings.The temple tour is almost like a production line. We have to follow the designated route before we can enter the Dhyanlinga hall, the key attraction of the place. We passed through the Suryakunda (a pond with mercury shivling for men), Chandra kund (a pond for women), ling bhairavi temple and finally the Dhyanlinga.Dhyanlinga sanctum sanctorum appeared to be a masonry brick structure. It has a huge shivalinga inside and the slightest of the sound made echos through the hall. This hall has a very pleasing vibe and energy.If nothing else, the architectural beauty of the place will take your breath away.We went to the curio shop and I purchased the dhoti that everyone seemed to be wearing there. I found the prices to be reasonable, comparable to other 'organic' brands in the market.As we were exiting, we could see the Adiyogi statue light up with massive floodlights. The sight was one to behold.I think it would be worthwhile to spend a night or two in this beautiful place. The Ashram offers residential cottages at reasonable prices.It should be a must visit place for all lovers of architecture and those seeking some tranquil moments."
167,Silencing of Mind,In the forests of siruvani with lushy green vegetation n the world famous statue - blessed to visit!
168,peaceful visit to the ashram,Adiyogi - Shiva is located amidst a hilly region in Coimbatore. Expect strong breeze. However if you ar visiting in the morning choose to be there early as the sun will be scorching down relentlessly. This is a pure man made structure and if you expect some kind of connect - go to Dhyana linga. The few minutes inside is pretty good and that's about it. Rest all - sold spirituality. Must visit place as an attraction. Choose your day based on weather.
169,Simply beautiful!!!,"The best part of our day trip to Dhyanalinga & Adiyogi was the bullock cart ride ... though it is just at a walkable distance , the hot summer day made us go for this ride for a very small fee ... the  cart has long bench like seats on either side , very comfortable, & can‚Ä¶"
170,Nice ,"Everything about this place has the authentic traditional Tamil Nadu touch to it, with a mix of modernity and it is so gorgeous. The Adiyogi bust statue is unique and beautiful. The Dhyanalingam is out of this world experience."
171,Isha Yoga@Vellingiri Hills,"People were mostly just taking selfies here. The ground is used for gatherings during festivals. I was here just before mahashivratri and they had constructed a  huge stage for the upcoming celebration function. Quite a walk from the main campus, sometimes you will find a golfcart to take you there from the parking, sometime you won't. Be prepared to walk, in scorching sun if you visit during the day as there is barely any shade the whole way. Visit in the evening before sundown."
172,AdiYogi at Velliangiri Mountains,"I visited this place with my friends....I am a hindu.....so i know the worship of lord Shiva,3 eyed man,my grandpa used to tell me the stories of lord shiva.... coming to the place.... it's so nice and clean...Must visit place even if you are not religiously inclined. This place is full of sheer natural beauty and positivity in the atmosphere. Weather is mostly pleasant.Picturesque site. Peaceful atmosphere. Canteen and parking facility available."
173,Good place,This is one trip you cannot afford to miss if you‚Äôre visiting Coimbatore.  If you‚Äôre here- it‚Äôs obviously as part of the trip to the Isha yoga center.  Whatever we say about the adiyogi bust will not do justice to this beautiful edifice. The construction is awe inspiring and the‚Ä¶
174,Imposing Shiva,"We had seen the photo of Adiyogi Shiva earlier, but it did not prepare us for the experience of seeing the statue in actual. The huge bust of Adiyogi Shiva is made of metal, covered with a black coating and is located on flat with the backdrop of surrounding mountains. The‚Ä¶"
175,There is No Adiyogi seen in Shiva ,"Wow - we were mesmerised by the AdiYogi It fills us with immense pride that in india a place and statue of this size is Maintained well , clean and extremely organised The way Isha foundation has turned a barren land into a fantastic ecosphere and provided some employment for locals is something to be witnessed Zero discrimination! AdiYogi is for everyone !Must visit for any one travelling to CoimbatoreSimply osum!"
176,Adiyogi,We had a few hours to spend in Coimbatore so we decided to visit this place. We were pleasantly surprised to find a clean and well organized ashram. The shiva statue is impressive and has good details. We took a short bullock cart ride to the first stop which had a temple and a‚Ä¶
177,Superb place.. mesmerizing adiyogi statue,"The statue of Shiva looks extraordinary from distance, but once you come close, you will not have the same zest and zeal which was from a distance. The distance is also too far away from Coimbatore. The main focus is because of Our Prime minister went there for opening. Overall‚Ä¶"
178,Namo Namo Oh Shankara Bholenath...,"While in Coimbatore we took the opportunity of visiting Isha foundation. The volunteer hospitality of Mr Anand Singh was immense , he explained patiently the history as well as various places that we eventually visited there !!"
179,A must do at Coimbatore,"Had been to the temple for the first time after listening to many of my colleague and was curious to visit this place , visited it was constructed beautifully and had made this visit helpful to know more on religious reasons and had found dhyanalinga was maintained quite and an helpful place for meditations"
180,Ones stop destination for your Spiritual awakening process.,Speechless - one word for the entire ambiance. So perfect that you will continue to admire the sculpture for long.
181,Serene and peaceful,Awe-inspiring statue acting as the facade of the ashram. Will be brilliant in moonlit nights. A definite place to visit.
182,Divine Bliss,"Not so far from coimbatore, but the place where the shiva statue is location is really serene.  Best time to visit is during early morning or late evening, afternoons are very sunny and you won't find much shade.  There are two entrances to the place, we entered through the front side, don't know much but there is back side as well. ‚Ä¶"
183,Nice combo along with Isha Dhyanalinga Temple,The surrounding area of the area is not well developed.  Very muddy and inconvenient to park the vehicle and to walk around.
184,"A divine, mesmerizing place",Beautiful Shiva (very young) and makes anyone automatically to fall to prayer mode. Hatsoff to Sri Sadguru who made India to be proud of these locations liked by whole world.
185,Most amazing place near Coimbatore,"It has 4 places to visit in this complex: Aadi Yogi steel face, an inverse brick dome with a huge Siva Linga inside where complete silence is observed (kids not allowed), a Devi temple and a cold pond with another Siva Linga where you can dip and feel refreshed/ blessed. It has a fun bullock kart ride as an eco friendly paid system. Canteens are there; they safe keep cell phones and shoes when you enter for collection later. Persons of all faiths/ religions are welcomed. It has separate yoga classes and stay arrangements too."
186,Serene and peaceful,"The hype and advertisements associated with this place is completed out of pace. It‚Äôs a high standing metal statute created by an individual to show to the world. There is no serenity, godly feeling and above all the face of the adiyogi is so much in resemblance to the yogi‚Ä¶"
187,Majestic & mesmerizing Adiyogi Shiva,Visited in group during SRPC meeting at Coimbatore on 11th Aug 2018. A calm and peaceful place for meditation.
188,A must visit for the scenic beauty & Grand size of Shiv statue ,The statue is so peaceful and calming. The expression on the face of Shiva is worth the visit and of course is a highlight of the place. Extremely pleasant experience I want to visit again.
189,Being Coimbatore,"I saw it around 7 PM when the sun had set. It looked so majestic. A small crowd was there. At 8. 8:30 and 9 PM  3 buses leave from there for Coimbatore, so return is almost guaranteed. Saw Sadhguru on YouTube saying something like its manufacturing process and its effect on us, even if one does not believe such things, it is a wonderful experience."
190,Very peaceful!,a must to visit place in coimbatore. never miss it incase if you are in coimbatore. wonderful place near the mountains. amazing bust statu. only one of its kind.
191,Good but maybe we expected too much,"This place is about 45 - 60 minutes drive from the city.  Locals say it is 30 Kilometers anywhere from the city :) The calm and peace of this place can be felt  miles away even when you get on to the road that leads to Velliangiri Isha Yoga Centre.We left from the city early morning by 6:30 am as we had to come back for our business meetings by 11:30am.  We realised this is one of the most peaceful time to visit this place. Even as your car turns into the entrance the mammoth Adi Yogi statue welcomes you. The sheer size of it in all its grandeur is such a befitting gift for that one hour ride. As you keep walking towards this statue where you also have the Yogi Linga in front of  Adi Yogi, a strange sence of calmness seeps in. After a good 15 minutes of meditation here you can move towards the main temple area the linga bhairavi, and the dhyana linga dome. Once you pass through the Snake entrance it is a different world by itself. It takes you back a few centuries in terms of peace and calm and serenity. The air so pure and cool, with all kind of birds and insects playing their own orchestra, and the Velliangiri mountains around you for visual delight, If you cannot walk upto here from the Adi Yogi  Linga meditation temple there are bullock carts. There are also  huge seperate areas for people to come and do their daily yoga practice here. There are two segregated, energised ponds called the chandrakund for the ladies and the Surya kund for the gents. These are supposed to have huge healing propertiies and spending a good seven minutes in this is very beneficial for the body and mind. Unfortunatly we could not do this for lack of time. We did visit the Linga Bhairavi  temple which has a female priest. The way of paying respects is also different from the way we usually do. We had to deposit our cell phone etc at the entrance to this place so unfortunately could not click pics. the best is yet to come. the Dhyana linga dome that has been consecrated by the Sadguru himself is an experience in itself. I would leave it to you the reader to experience than explaining it here as no one can do justice to it. However please maintain silence as you are told, and keep looking for instruction placards held  by volunteers. As  it is a silent zone. Never miss this opportunity to spend that 15 minutes in meditation inside the dome. Life changing for a few, and definitely thought changing for anyone who enters it. Ther are various workshops held by the foundation. you can enquire there and get yourself registred if you feel the need to do so. A cafeteria provides wholesome South Indian basic meals at very nominal prices. There i also a huge residential area for ppl staying there for various purposes. this is off limits for day visitors. Do not mis this for anything in the world. Basic thing to remember. This is not your regular Hindu temple. This is a place for inner peace, calm, respecting other fellow beings and appreciating what god has given you. So maintain the decorum and respect the space."
192,Blissfull visit,Excellent Experience from Dip in Water and then Darshan of Linga Temple and Devi temple and then Yoga and later to Adiyogi Shiva with Sir Sadguru Chanting voice and excellent peaceful experience. The best was bullock cart travel across temple to Adiyogi and Prasadam was Superb. 
193,A serene experience,This place is just outside the Isha Foundation highlighting the first guru as Aadiyogi dated back from 15000 years when there was no existence of any religious. It is believed that Lord Shiva has given guidance to his seven disciples. This is a 112 feet statue indicating those‚Ä¶
194,Experience sublime divine bliss,"A wonderful serene and must visit place in Coimbatore. Sadhguru ashram has Adiyogi bust statue with a smiling face and  majestic look. Further 2 km away is Dyanlinga temple  which has a huge Shivlinga established, a meditative place. A different experience.There is a souvenir‚Ä¶"
195,Hyped and reall,One of the beautiful place to visit. Lord Shiva statue located at the centre with greenery surroundings on all sides. With three sides surrounded by mountains with cloud cover
196,Best place in Coimbatore,This is located outside the beautifully made Isha Centre in the midst of the beautiful Velliangiri mountains. The grandeur of the statue and the blissfulness on the face is one of its kind. The location is so serene that one could visit this place at different hours of the day to experience the effect of  sunlight on the mountains.It is located around 1.5 hours away from Coimbatore airport. I stayed at the Isha Centre for 2-3 days and I would recommend it to anyone interested in Yoga and / or meditation. The Dhyanalinga inside  reflects great energy. Rest is recommended to be experienced personally üôÇ.
197,Breathtaking,Isha Yoga centre is functioning at the outskirt of coimbatore city and tourist attraction. Transportation facilities are available from coimbatore city and buses are plying. Adiyogi Shiva statue is about 1 km from the entrance of Isha Yoga centre. Statue is the largest bust sculpture.  Statue of the Hindu deity Shiva with Thirunamam on the forehead and this was inugurated by the prime Minister Mr.Narendra Modi.
198,Family ,Adi Yogi Statue is Awesome.    Must visit !!!  Surrounding area is still being developed and I am sure within a year or it will be a transformed place.
199,Nice ,What an amazing experience! It was drizzling when we visited & the surrounding mountains were shrouded in clouds. & there was the bust of Adiyogi emerging gracefully from the land. You can visit here & then head to the Isha Ashram by foot which is about 7-8 min walk away or‚Ä¶
200,Great experience. Felt blessed,"This Adhi yogi statue was constructed recently in the campus of Isha yoga centre.. The statue seems to stand majestically with a smile on the face.. You could feel yourselves a minute dust in the universe after having a Silent view and sitting in a corner for a meditation.. If your concentration is very sharp, then you could see your anger, hate and other negative things being turned in to dust and mixed in the air, when you merge completely yourself in the vastness of the Adhi yogi statue.."
201,A must visit place,"Last evening we had a quick visit to AdiYogi. We reached there @6.00. Yesterday being cloudy there were low visibility. We the first time we entered thru the gate it thrilled me... as I go close and near to the status it simply amazed me. I realized there must be someone who is there and guide us. We also have paid homage to Lord Shiva and meditate there as well.Overall, a very nice, quiet place worth a visit when you are around....."
202,New addition to Isha Yoga Centre opened by Shri Narendramodi PM of India,"The statue is breathtaking, but for me, the main draw was the idyllic landscape surrounding it. Very peaceful atmosphere, and the perfect spot for LOTS of photos. You should also visit the Dhyanalinga, it is right next to the Adiyogi statue.Younger kids will get bored quickly though, and they may dislike the moderately long drive from central Coimbatore."
203,Excellent place to visit,"Usually crowded in all days especially weekend it would be even more, try to visit early morning or late evening if you want to enjoy peace.Room booking are available but book prior,Ashram is maintained well cafeteria food is little pricey but quality is good."
204,A place to enjoy on the foot hills of Western Ghats,"Must visit place if you are going Coimbatore for even 1 day. Just take out 30 minutes and go and see the beautiful Lord Shiva statue. We were there for about an hour, however I could have spent their some more time. Much larger space for parking, washrooms, sitting, and of course a very beautiful views from each side."
205,Amazing place,"Complete tranquility around the place, barring the usually noisy crowd. The huge idol is eye catchy from any angle and is visible from a distance. There are no forced donations and fleecing priests. The volunteers around the ashram are most humble and know how to deal with kids with calm."
206,Adi yogi,Its a poweful energy space. Onecan emerged in the peace and serenity of the powerful Yogeshwaraya linga and Dhyanalinga
207,"A must visit, not to  be missed!!!","Well the statue is good, but after going there there was not much to see. Was really disappointed as the statue of 112 ft is visible from entrance. "

244,good location,"Unlike any of the faces and expressions of Shiva that we get to regularly see, this behemoth overwhelms but does not appear unreal. The calmness of the face, the jawline, the flowing hair, the bareness of the bust almost thrusts the energy of the Lord himself of seeking his powers through this peaceful yoga of his, a spell that you yearn to experience as you get closer.  But somehow, it turned out to be a neutral experience since I was undecided if I had to look at it as a work of art to appreciate or to relate to it as an idol of God, that was recently put up. Nevertheless, the heat got me going and I concluded that it was indeed great, for the various merits that I first noticed. A new place, that too with the entire area laid out in stones, on a very hot afternoon, I burnt my soles looking for shade even after dozens of steps. Keeping in mind different age groups of visitors, the managers may have to consider making suitable arrangements to have a carpeted or cooled walk way.  I am happy with the calmness of the face and the bust is a unique form of Shiva that stays in the mind. Devout or not, an experience there is a tribute we can offer to the human effort, epitomized by Sadhguru.  ‚Ä¶"

293,Mesmerizing,"This is a statue of Lord Shiva  that was inaugurated by Prime Minister  of India couple of years back. It is an immensely popular tourist as well as devotional place. The statute is said to be 112 ft tall and shows only the torso of Shiva in a dhyan pose. It is located on the outskirts of Coimbatore in Sadhguru Ashram and is approachable by a good but long road. Both OLA/Uber and autos will go there since the ashram falls within Coimbatore limits as such - the prices will be a bit on higher side as distance from city center is 20-30 kms.  Getting a vehicle for return journey may depend on chance, so better to hire a vehicle for round trip as the place is far away from main city and hence public transport is not so easy to find.The Ashram is split into two main parts -first part on one side of road is called Isha Yoga Center. And the other part which hosts this statue has its own Parking. The place gets hot after 11 am , so considering the Coimbatore weather, better to visit before that or in evenings.You can take a walk around the statue (parikrama) - you are allowed close to the stature if you deposit shoes and walk barefoort. Or you can go round the statue, from a slight distance, if if you have shoes on.  Public amenities like clean washrooms are available at the spot. While you visit this, do make sure to visit the Isha Yoga Ashram also on other side of road (walkable distance), so take out sufficient time  when coming to this side of Coimbatore. Mobiles and bags etc. etc are allowed at the statue (though you need to deposit them when entering the Yoga Ashram).It is a mix of modernity and tradition, religion and tourism. The place is a MUST visit if you are visiting Coimbatore or Ooty."
