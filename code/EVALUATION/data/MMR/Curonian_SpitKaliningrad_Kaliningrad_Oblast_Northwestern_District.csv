0,Worth it if you avoid touristic spots,"If you want to visit the Spit, you really have to think through the logistics. If you're staying in Kaliningrad, you have two choices: you can try and catch an early bus straight from Kaliningrad to the Spit (with stops in Zelenogradsk and all three villages in the Spit) or you can go to Zelenogradsk first either by train or by bus and from there take a local bus 210 to the Spit and hop on and hop off where you want. The 210 bus has a fixed schedule but it doesn't run too often so make sure you have a plan (what you want to see, how you're gonna move from one spot to another) and a timing schedule (the Spit is 42 km long and you can't walk it in one day). The bus doesn't run after 6 pm. Taxi one way is about 1000 rubles. Entrance fee is 150 per person and 300 per car (you still have to pay for 150 rubles for each person in the car on top of 300 rubles). If you come by bicycle, make sure you have a lock, you won't be able to take it with you everywhere. It's an amazing place but the most popular spots are crowded with tourists and filled with dubious grill cafes and Amber stores. I didn't enjoy being there and regret wasting my time to get there. If you really want to be alone and enjoy the nature, I suggest you visit the Royal Forest (Korolevsky Bor) at the 6th kilometer and then the Swan Lake (Ozero Lebed) at the 42nd kilometer. These are beautiful, quiet spots with very little to zero people. You can further minimize your chances of being in a crowd by visiting on a weekday."
1,Amazing place,"If you visit Kaliningrad you have to visit the Curonian spit, and preferably with the excursion group, it is the easiest way.At the spit there is three main attractions to visit, the Efa height, the dancing forest and the beach. In the first one you will enjoy the view of the Baltic sea and the curonian bay from the same view point. As for the dancing forest it is very remarkable with its trees and personally I felt this area have some energy and high electromagnetic field."
2,Beautiful Landscape and Beaches,"It's quite a drive, but you get out of town to see see, basically, a nature park with sand dunes, nice woods/nature/birds etc. Interesting history of the building and the myths of the Spit."
3,Curonian spit ,"Peaceful though many people. Unique ecosystem. If you can, get a reservation to see the bird banding station that catches, bands and releases thousands of birds on their migratory flight"
4,The Curonian Spit an Nida Town in Lithuania,"Interesting that you have to take a ferry to reach it. There are paved roads and 4 settlements. You can not go into the Russian section. One settlement is a fishermans village. 3000 people live on the split. A very popular touristic place, full of nature. Suitable for biking."
5, Cycling,"You have to pass a checkpoint and buy a ticket. They might also check documents. After the checkpoint you have beautiful nature on both sites of the narrow road (drive carefully). It's worth to explore the Curonian Spit for at least one full day. If the weather is good, stay longer! Take a spray against ticks and mosquitos!"
6,Crowded in summer,you go for 60 kms and you hope soon to be in place where you will remain breatheless. sorry but this did not happen to me. nice long forest like the ones you find everywhere in the north. does not deserve a deviation for a visit.
7,Beautiful landscape with opportunities to hike or swim.,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend 5-6 hours on tour to the Curonian Split, but, boy, was I not disappointed! The tour bus company provided a good driver and a tourguide. The trip to the Split took just over an hour. On the way to the split we also stopped at the Zoological Institute of the Academy of Science ""Fringilla"" where we saw a demonstration of the researchers catching migrating birds and ""ringing"" themAnother quick ride and we had time to spend looking at the Baltic Sea shore and the dunes. It is a walk to the dunes - keep that in mind. Also, quite a few steps, so take it slow ) It didn't look handicap accessible. Another important point - stay on the trail, don't go into the dunes or forest. It is prohibited, and you will most certainly be fined and be talked to by security. On my trip I've witnessed 3 couples that got in trouble.I have thoroughly enjoyed most of the time on the beach of Baltic Sea. The sun was out, the wind wasn't too strong. It was about 45 degrees outside, but I still took shoes off and enjoyed a walk in the water. The sand is white and very fine. Would be a gorgeous place to visit in the summer!"
8,Excursion ,"Nice scenery with good weather, but the transportation facilities are not enough, solo traveler like me can only go to one trail. Trails are dispersed."
9,Wonderful National park,"I recommend the Curonian Spit anytime of year really, but if you take advantage of the short summer along the Baltic Sea you can find a paradise here in good, flat bike trails among conifer forests, good spots to watch birds, and wide, white sandy beaches."
10,"Interesting enough, if you have time","Wopnderful place, amazing nature. You can easily sped a few days there, walking on the beaches, through the woods, going up to the duna hill. Very particular ""dancing wood"". For those who loves to be with the nature, there is no a lot of entartainment there... Possibility to eat or buy something at the small village of Ribachy."
11,"Good view on the sea, sand mountains, very short time on excursion","So interesting and different nature. I recommend travel here for all day. Also you could rest at the beach, so don’t forget to take swimsuits."
12,The light,"I suppose in the summer it's hard to travel by bike by the single road without bike trails. But we were there in may, so the traffic was calm. The nature is beautiful, but I prefer mountains."
13,Took a day out,Surreal landscapes and great scenery. It's definetely worth going here - find out a little more about the history and weather before heading out. Lots of spots to get down and wander around before the final end of the Spit on the Russian side - plan ahead!
14,"World Heritage Site, difficult to decide what to see","You will need transport to reach the Curonian Spit but it well worth the effort, there plenty of hiking trails and it is possible to swim in the Baltic Sea, an invigorating experience, it is not recommended to swim in the Curonian lagoon due to pollution. There is wildlife to be seen, we saw a wild boar and her young, probably attracted by the tidbits offered by passing motorists. There is a charge for entering the area, and it does get popular with locals at the weekends. There are plenty of snack bars and restaurants some of them are on the beach."
15,ok,Really is a highlight if a trip around the Baltic. Amazing sand dunes. Very well maintained on the Lithuanian side. Really has to be experienced
16,Total must,"Any time if the year you may go there and come back with tens of photos, beautiful amber, smoked fish and - the most important- recharged batteries. That what nature does with our souls. Welcome to my world 🌎!!!"
17,"Great attraction, but tourist unfriendly","The Curonian Spit is a must-see destination for anyone going to Kaliningrad.  It is only an hour's drive away.  It's a combination of Sand Dunes, Pine Forests, the Baltic Sea on one side and the Curonian Gulf on the other side.  You can walk from one coast to the another in under 15 minutes because the Spit is a narrow line of land between the two bodies of water.  And do visit the Enchanted Forest with many twisted trees. It is definitely worth walking through the forest and feeling its magical energy.  :))"
18,"The place is wonderful, but I would just like to quote a joke : if you advertise for a""spit"", be prepared for the worst","Stayed at Ecolodge Zen in the village of Morskoye.Right off the lodge you can climb the facing hill and emerge in WWII history with Nazi Germany authentic bunker and coastal artillery, and see two seas simultaneously! Stroll through the magic woods and exit on the dune of Efa, the highest in Europe, with magnificent views.From there, cross the main road to cafe Vinland for breakfast, and then head south to the mysterious Dancing Forest, an utterly reinvigorating walk, then continue on to Rybachi village for a hearty fish meal at the famous Rybni Dvor.Life is complete))"
19,A bucket list destination if visiting Kaliningrad,This is an amazing natural structure. You get to it from Kleipeda using the 5-10 minute ferry. It is very popular with tourists. Nida is the main town with plenty of hotels and restaurants.
20,Amazing !!!,"A very long and narrow site and I assume the best place for the largest sand dunes is Epha's Height (at the 42 km mark). To see more than a  single place you need your own method of transport, public buses are not enough."
21,The Curonian Spit,I had a day's tour here and found it very interesting. We started at the bird ringing  centre and then moved on to the dunes and then the Dancing Forest. Being part of a group made the travel easy but I can imagine that if you were alone language could be a problem. There were quite a few Russian tourists also there at the time. If you enjoy the outdoors then this is the place to visit.
22,Desolate Paradise,"I have recently visited Kaliningrad and I managed to get a guide to drive me there, they charge 300 Roubles per car and if I can remember we started with Lesnoy village and ended with the swan lake, I absolutely love this place nice beaches, pine trees, the dancing forest everything, the only problem is that due to the nature of this place they cannot build proper toilets so they only have biological toilets or mobile toilets, with no flushing and they are very smelly and I was told that before they didn't even have those so people were just peeing and pooing anywhere.But otherwise it's a great place to be in specially at the top of the hill in the swan lake.I would also like to go to the Lithuanian part at some point."
23,Svetlogorsk and curonian spit,"Took a trip along the spit as way of familiarising myeslf with the region. The journey was interesting, passing many small settlements before arriving at Pillau. I drove to a car park on the coast and walked along the coast watching the very busy shipping canal into the Baltic which is the reason Kaliningrad was retained by Russia after the war. You can see the ferry go across the break in the spit which is a journey for another day. There could have been a hundred people fishing off the pier and the beach was also busy with beach-combers looking for Amber. A thouroughly beuatiful spot and well worth a visit."
24,InKalingrad tour of Curonian Spit and Svetlogorsk,"Long long way but very very nice view from the viewpoints! Don't be lazy ) u ll have a lot of nice pictures there) But be careful and don't step out from the wooden road,dangerous."
25,Great nature.,"That's a unique national resort totally worth some of your time. The nature is beautiful, there're places to see and the restaurants at this place are quite famous for their cuisine."
26,Nature and fresh air,"Such an interesting place, we certainly didn't expect to see a desert landscape next to the Baltic Sea. But within a 15 minute walk from west to east there we were strolling over a wooden walkway through a pine forest, and up to top of a rolling sand dune. The views were spectacular, looking out from a platform especially built to facilitate the need to snap as many pictures as possible was most welcome. Sadly we found little on the sad history of this location"
27,Time spent with nature,"Must see destination while visiting Kaliningrad. Better to take organized tour or go by car, transfer by public transport will make you tired. Clean beaches and sea are exciting. Nice place to stay for couple of days."
28,Worth a visit,"The Curonian Spit in the the Kaliningrad Oblast is a great place to visit. To get there from Kaliningrad city you go to the central bus station (next to the South railroad station) and take bus # 593. There are 4 buses going there eveyday, and the price is 120-140 rubles (September 2013), to one of the last two stops in the spit. It takes 2 hours to get there, but you travel in the countryside, which is beautiful.Once there, I managed to get lost in the forest, and then I finally found my way through the dunes. It is not allowed to step foot on the dunes, by for me it was to only way to get right on track to Morskoye and then take the bus back to Kaliningrad. The largest bit was nearly a 3km walk on the dunes, and some of them were higher than 30m.There are other attractions in the Curonian Spit, which you can get acquainted with at the friendly information office next to the Drama Theatre in Kaliningrad."
29,A place in heaven!,"I visited the spit as part of an organised tour on a coach, and really enjoyed it. Not because we saw something 'amazing' or 'special' but because we were outside in a beautiful natural habitat, surrounded by fresh air, pine trees and sandy beaches.It is a great place to wander around and just take in some scenery, and breathe some fresh air! Be aware of the weather though, as if it starts to rain it may get muddy. I'd recommend wearing long sleeve shirt or raincoat, and trousers with closed shoes in order to avoid picking up any forest insects (ticks) if you are going for a stroll into the 'dancing forest'. A beautiful place, but it is quite a long drive from Kaliningrad so be aware of this before setting off."
30,Do not forget to book this trip,"There is much to see and do on the Curonian Spit: Hill of Witches, amber hunting on the beach, restaurants, amber stores and hiking in the forest that covers most of the Spit. You can also see the Russian Kaliningrad from the huge sand dune at the southern most point by the huge sundial"
31,Amazing ezperiance,Worth a drive! Fascinating history and nice beach (I’m and Aussie is I have a high standard)... don’t annoy the border guards!
32,Unique nature attraction ,"Nice place, but not with such amount of holidaymakers from both sides. Good for crossing Russian border (quick)."
33,Unusual nature spot,"In the Russian part there is no seperate bicycle road, there is from Nida, but you have to search for it. We spend a night in Rybatsji, which was a nice experience and has a very nice Amber jewelry store and a good restaurant (next to the road)"
34,"Unique landscape, quiet and unspoilt.","The Curonian Spit is a beautiful place to walk around, see the dunes, the sand, the sea!Untouched corner. Be sure to take a trip there.There is a chance that you can see the animals."
35,Beautiful Natural Area,"This is the place, that everyone has to see! very nice atmosphere and picturesque scenery! here you can find a lot of interesting places, but for me it was a view on both the see and the bay!"
36,"Scenic, unique Russian culture",The beach was full of what I think was hoverflies so every time you were still for a second there were 10 of them on you. So relaxing at beach was not an option. There's a direct bus from Kaliningrad but not that many and no aircon and takes two hours. It can be pretty hard to find a bus back as well. The nature is quite nice but I wouldn't say it's worth the time if you're getting there by public.In hindsight booking with tour company is probably smarter.
37,wild,"Duna, forest, birds, see... You can enjoy just everything while you breathe in and breathe out. No time. No cities. Just you."
38,Красота !!Amazing!!! English -Russian review,"Beautiful national park, 150 entry per person (and 150 per car), so not really expensive (note: keep your ticket, they can check it inside the park at any time). Nice stops with hiking/walks, museum, bird station. Restaurant in Rybachi only, guesthouses are in the settlements, try Morskoye settlement (guesthouse Morskoe) small village, more quaint than the others and beautiful guesthouse, walking distance beach.Beaches are very clean, no garbage or dirt. Beautiful sand. Definitely worth to go on a day trip or even stay 1-2 nights to enjoy evenings. I would get a private car or driver, not a bus tour."
39,Unique,"The Curonian Spit gave us a chance to walk through the desert, bicycle through the forest and swim at the beach...all on one day!  Liking to eat fish might be a prerequisite, but life on the Curonian Spit must be pretty good!  Lithuanians appreciate the importance of a good cup of coffee more than other places:  our morning was rescued by a Lavazza barrista with her Smartcar kitted out with an espresso machine, and in the afternoon we enjoyed a perfect espresso served up from a bicycle-mounted Lavazza machine!  Life is good!"
40,Close to sea🌊,"No one should miss this place if you like the great outdoors, unspoilt  beaches and beautiful sceneries! The place is so charming you could think you are in a fairytale setting! Just get a bike and get lost in this great place!"
41,On a day trip from Kaliningrad by public transport,"I camped on the Russian side, It was insanely beautriful, a real gem of a place... as i watched thze sun go down you could hear russian military jets sonic booming as the broke the sound barrier overhead... super magical place..."
42,Beautiful and sometimes unique nature,"Like a previous contributor, I walked from Zelenogradsk but you don't have to. Bus number 596 (Svetlogorsk to Mopckoe) runs from the main bus and train station. Its 20 roubles flat but I don't know the frequency of the service. You can walk along the beach, then cut inland and walk along the road, or better still use the well marked paths in the woods at the edge of the lagoon. Be prepared for mosquitoes though! The road itself is narrow but traffic is infrequent so its not totally unfeasible to walk it. Its just boring. You will arrive at a ticket office where you must pay 150 roubles to enter the park, much like Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree etc. The most striking thing here is the sense of splendid isolation. I did not meet a soul in 10 miles walking through the woods at the edge of the lagoon. The bird life is amazing with numerous strange calls and song and there is a viewing platform where I wished I'd had binoculars. The platform is quite rickety though, as are the boardwalks (pictured) so I advise extreme caution using them as any foot or leg injuries here could have dire consequences for the solo traveller."
43,very unique 100 km spit between the Baltic and the lagoon,"This was a great day out, especially the visit to the Bird ringing and tracking project. This was followed by a visit to the seashore and the heights. Only slight drawback was the lack of English speaking but we got by OK."
44,Spend a whole day here,"Visiting this part of the oblast was my reason for renting a car. Nature in all her glory. Dunes, beach, forest. Rain and wind during my visit."
45,Good halfday outing,Nature lovers should visit at least once a scythe until it does not have dirtied ...All I want to somehow get to the Lithuanian side and compare ...
46,Wonderful piece of coastline,If you are a unique natural landscapes fun it is  must. Wonderful clean beaches with white sand and the Baltic Sea and Curonian Lagoon both in walking distance. It is really worth to stay here for a couple days to relax.
47,"Wild nature, clean, civilized","The Curonian Spit is a combination of beautiful beaches and beautiful landsape. The best beaches are just behind Lesnoy (approx. 13 km from Zelenogradsk) or near Vysota Efa (approx. 42 km from Zelenogradsk). There are parking opportunities and public bus services at both places. The beaches are clean and broad. They consist of fine sand and the access to the water is flat, an ideal place to swim. The Entrance is charged and you can find some fast food sellers or restaurants there. I recomend Rybny Dvor in Rybachy. There is also a gas station in Rybachy."
48,Huge beach...you can see Russia from here.,"1. We were on excursion from a tourist company Junona and best memories were from bird station Fringilla, where the story from a person, which handles birds counting was jut superb and I recommend to each to do it. The person told a short story about birds counting and showed with two birds how to do it. 2. Second interesting site was place with twisted trees (see pictures).3, The worst of the excursion was the shortage of time, so as at view points which are possible to see in map to this place we spent most of time and there wer very small time left to visit seaside (the view points are on sandy mountains from channel side), but seaside is very beatiful and You can swim too. My advice would be to visit seaside more then sandy mountains from the channel side and take a car better, then go with an excursion."
49,Excellent,"As some other reviewers have noted, it's very personal whether this is your cup of tea.  I experienced unusual serenity and tranquility in the vast expanse of the dunes, the Baltic sea, and the endless cloudy sky, coupled with a refreshing smell of the evergreen forest.  I recommend biking if you are in shape for a 30-50km run, stop several times along the way, and don't neglect the bay side of the strip of land."
50,Must see place,"A unique place that separates Baltic Sea and a lagoon. I've been there in winter and want to see in summer, too. Must see before u die."
51,"Wonderful nature, nice clean beaches",Looks like the dutch islands but than with an baltic feel with very beautiful views and beaches. But needs some developments for tourists.
52,Beautiful day trip,"I just did a day trip from Zelenogradsk to Nida, visited the museum, Müller's Height, Dancing Forest, Efa Height and Morskoe, however it's extremely tourist unfriendly.There was no excursion available when I asked at hostel reception, there was no car rental available from Kaliningrad to Klaipeda or Riga by any company, and there seemed to have no one-way bike rental from Zelenogradsk to Smiltyne so I have to take buses. The authoritative bus timetable can be found at Zelenogradsk bus station, there is a bus every hour and I followed until to Morskoe, but the only afternoon bus continuing to Nida didn't come on time and I ended up stuck at the border until someone offered me a ride.I wonder why the hourly buses terminate at a small village Morskoe but not continue to the next major town in Nida, this causes a bottleneck in the transport system on the Curonian Spit."
53,Such a beautiful and natural,"We traveled from Klaipeda, Lithuania to Kaliningrad via the spit and visited a number of sites along the way. Very beautiful. Be sure to stop in at the bird migration center."
54,"Amazing nature, but poor infrastructure","We booked a whole day tour with ‘in Kaliningrad’ to svetlogorsk and the curonian spit. Olga was our guide and seven of us travelled in a minibus. Olga described the history of the area (oblast) in great detail and with interesting anecdotes. Both she and the driver, Aleksandar were helpful all day. We saw parts of the spit and Svetlogorsk which is a beautiful town with many beautiful houses and many market stalls which sell Amber at a very reasonable price.Great tour, very efficient company and a super guide, OlgaThankyou"
55,"great for walking, riding bike, bird watching","Some years ago I visited the part of the Spit in Lithuania, and was fascinated by it. The Russian part was - not surprisingly - similar, but less developed and more aimed at bus tours. There are several walks to do, but the most interesting part for me was the Ornothological Station, where birds and caught, ringed and released. If you don‘t speak Russian, be prepared to miss out on a lot of information."
56,Saturday jaunt,"gorgeous place, full of calmness, nature and beautiful views. great places for hiking. and do not forget to visit Nida - really nice place with a chilled atmosphere"
57,Just relax and enjoy!,We see it from nida and kaliningard. Feels just like seeing niagara falls from canada and usa. Former is more touristic while the latter is a true and protected national park. We hired a private guide who is so experienced and full of information. It made the tour very interesting and memorable.
58,Impressive ,"We (me and my wife) had visited the Kuronian (maybe Curonian is the right version) spit in the second half of July 2018. First of all, the place look quite unique to us, as it is a narrow and very long stretch of land (almost 100 km split almost evenly between Russia - region of Kaliningrad and Lithuania) that splits a sort of lagoon from the Baltic Sea. The Russian side includes nice beaches, a wooden path for visiting the sand dunes, the ""dancing"" forest (with strangely twisted pine trees), a very nice research station for studying migrant birds, some places to stay over night accompanied by good restaurants. Should you look for a peaceful rest in the middle of nature having also the possibility of eating very well (most dishes being local specialties) , pray for good weather and go there in summer time for a few days - no one would be disappointed.For the 6 hours that we spent there, the weather was impeccable (sunny but not very hot), a silky breeze accompanied us in most of the visited places and (last but not least) I could use my credit card to pay for the delicious lunch."
59,Beautiful place!,"The best beaches in region, variety of nature, dunes, some nice restaurants and hotels. Advise to go there only by car"
60,Very impressive and definitely a must see,"Fantastic view, good place for resting. Better go there for whole day and see all parks and rest on the beach."
61,A stunning slice of nature,"We did a guided half day tour to the Curonian Spit. Only approx. half of the spit belongs to Russia,the other half belongs to Lithuania. It is a picturesque area, but we have similar beaches and dunes in Australia. We saw some old log cabins and a place where they catch birds in huge nets, ring them and then set them free again. I visited the area because I have family ties in the area. Nothing special, but ok."
62,"pristine nature, great view","It was not for the fisrt time I've been looking at the nature from the same side! Wow.. But it is amazing! Словами очень сложно передать все ощущения и запахи соснового леса, приятный шелест в ушах северного ветра. To be perfect don't forget to take some hot tea and chocolates because there is not so many places to have to eat something. And remember that all food is delicious with the nature..."
63,heritage sight . well preserved,"We travelled the entire lenght of the spit coming down from Lithuania. Spent the night in the small village of Morskoye, and got to feel the village life. Cool landscapes here, with sanddunes, beaches, forest and a weird wonderful little area called Laughing forest (with twisted Trees). They probably sell up the spit more than it deserves, it's not _that_ special nature-wise as they sell it to be, but just being in Kaliningrad is cool! Recommended to stay a night in one of the small villages, like Morskoye, and roam the beaches and dunes during sunrise or sunset."
64,A great place!,"Great beaches! Amazing scenery with miles of secluded coastline, totally unspoiled.   Although the roads are not the best....but we did explore."
65,Birds.,"The frozen Curonian Lagoon at the peak of winter was a beautiful sight, though one has to bear the cold while outside. The Pine and spruce groves covered with snow makes a good picture. Please go to blog http://www.papumashi.blogspot.in"
66,"Extraordinary place, worth a visit","Reading the review of those unimpressed I have to say the road along the spit itself reminds you of any other normal wood, however it's what behind those trees that's so interesting. What's important is to take a guide with you who would tell you everything about the spit, from the way it was formed through its forestation and show you the most interesting spots.I loved the stay at Curonian Spit, the walks were amazing, with wonderful humid air smelling of pines and breathtaking views of the sand dunes against the backdrop of a forest. Very unusual. And the Dancing Forest topped it all, with its eerie atmosphere that makes you feel quite apprehensive. You have to see and feel it for yourself, it's quite an experience. Please, go eith a guide, you'll enjoy it much more!"
67,Curonian Lagoon-Baltic Sea,"The most beautiful place in Kaliningrad region. Its a perfect place for relaxing near the sea or gulf. Clean air, pure nature and tranquility! I recommend you to go to the pic EVA. There is amazing view!"
68,Excellent national park,"Once you arrive on the Spit you are immediately surrounded by the beautiful forests and views of the area. We found ourselves face to face with a moose one evening when returning from Nida after dinner, thankfully we were in the car! The area is exquisite, very peaceful and quiet and ideal for a retreat. There are many restaurants and as this is very popular during the summer, it caters well to tourists. Like most of Lithuania, this is a cheap place to stay, eat and drink. A climb to the top of the dunes reveals the true beauty of the area. You can look over to the Russian part of the spit, back into Nida and over the sand dunes themselves.. A truely beautiful part of stunning country."
69,GREAT NATURAL LANSCAPES IN A FAMILY ENVIRONMENT,one of the best nature parks i have seen in a while. the trees are winding and beautifully preserved. a well displaced location but a nice drive through the woods too!
70,Incredible nature,"We booked our trip through the tourist agency inside Hotel Kaliningrad.  Lucky us came a few minutes before 11 in the morning, and bus left 11.The guide spoke only in Russian.  She never ran empty of information and spoke in the microfon more or less all the way.A couple stops, until we came to Curonian Spit which was breathtaking.  By the Baltic sea we had a soup of borscht in the Vinland-restaurant before going home.The trip cost 1180 rub, and you must plan to spend about six hours.  Bring cloths according to weather."
71,Every time I come there I hate myself for not coming earlier!,"Beautiful natural attractions. We traveled over from Klaipeda to Kaliningrad We slept on the Russian side of the coast, for free .. The road is good, the border crossing is easy. The Lithuanian side, very clean, and the maritime museum at the end of the road is very beautiful. From there you can go on the ferry to Lithuania."
72,Beautiful Curonian Spit,"The unique nature, great views and landscapes - and the story of people's struggle with the nature - or, to be more precise, sand - for their living space there."
73,"Beautiful, but I expected more","This place is the best opportunity to relax on the coast and make friends with history of Kaliningrad region. There you can stay for some days or weeks with tents or rent a house. There is a museum of birds and you can see wild birds, animals. There is a dancing forest where are trees in different shapes. And you can visit place and see how the amber is getting"
74,Beautiful nature,A very special and unique part of Baltic coast which is ideal for romantic couples or singles looking for lonely beaches and relaxing rest. Yet all comfortable infrastructure and full cultural life from Nida to Klaipeda!
75,Very beautiful views,The Curonian Spit or Kurische Nehrung is an amazing National Park and a must see !! Honestly i never heard it before and i was really surprised when my fantastic Tour Guide Katerina told me about it. For sure is this the highlight of Kaliningrad ... but the city is beautiful as well.
76,Beautiful view!,"Olga from InKaliningrad tours took us for a day trip to Svetlogorsk and Curonian Spit, and it was an amazing day.  Olga is a fantastic guide, the van was very comfortable and the driver excellent.  Both Svetlogorsk and Curonian Spit we definitely worth a visit, scenically beautiful.  If you have a few days in Kaliningrad, I would definitely suggest doing this day trip with Olga and InKaliningrad Tours."
77,Amazing diversity,"This long and thin sand dune can be reached in about one hour's drive from Kaliningrad. After the neglect under Soviet rule the current management are actively preventing the loss of sand and implementing the tree planting stabilising the dunes.The Max Planck Research Centre for Ornithology is definitely recommended if only to see the huge net bird traps, allegedly the largest in the world.The Dancing Forest, a combination of unusually twisted trees for which there is no scientific explanation, is also interesting although the whole experience is a bit over-hyped.There are plenty of viewing platforms with excellent panorama on both sides of the Spit as well as raised walkways to protect the dunes."
78,Sand Line,"An uninspiring 40 mins drive from kaliningrad town with abandoned fields and grass being illegally burnt on the way.. The spit is a stretch of land linking kaliningrad with lithuania (border half way along). Seemingly protected by unesco- not that you would notice- and with a fee to enter. Really not much to see- it consists of a long road with trees on either side but no dune/sea views really. You can stop off at a  few places to see the dunes but I was not really inspired... There is also a spit museum although I could not really see the point of it and not worth a visit. A couple of deer and a small wild boar enclosed outside and odd exhibits inside. There is also a ""dancing forest"" which is made up of twisted trees. Again- nothing special. Better to miss this area out and instead head over to the town of Svetlogorsk for a short visit. (And you can get there by a train so another plus.)"
79,Wonderful place,"The split, a sand peninsula fingering its way into the Baltic close to Kaliningrad is a great short excursion. It has a surprisingly interesting history and, besides being one itself, has several natural wonders, towering sand dunes and a forest of ""Dancing Trees,"" all of which can be reached and leisurely enjoyed at the end of gentle hikes. For us it was a shady relief from some very hot days. A surprise to my eyes were parking lot hawkers stands selling fish and ice cream in the same shop side by side! Both tasty, by the way, but not on the same plate. Lots of neat woodcarving along the ways."
80,A lovely unspoiled stretch of land.,I visited here as a part of a tour. Beautiful coast line with sandy beach and lots of wild flowers all around. Beautiful drive to the park
81,for nature-lovers,"The Curonian Split is the area belongs to Russia and Lithuania, I visited both parts of it, full of small Village, Sandy dunes and beaches, with Forest. In summer season russian part is totaly crowded but lithuanian not. Worth to visit In June or September."
82,just wow,"I admire Curonian Spit, perhaps one of the most amazing and impressive natural beauties of Lithuania, and the effort to protect it. This area, also called the Sahara of the Baltic Sea and included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, consists of about 90 km long narrow saber-shaped dunes that divide the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea. Curonian Spit and its surroundings is a national park that is very well protected by the state. In this national park created with pine trees that people have planted with their hands for years, they have carefully lived more than 30 species of endangered birds and more than 800 different plants. I can say that I have never seen such a good visuality anywhere else in the world. The charming town of Nida and the small ""Ethnographic Homestead  of Fisherman"" named fishing house museum, ""Gintaro Galerija Muziejus"" named amber museum and ""the Horizontal Granite Sundial"" are also worth visiting in Curonian Spit."
83,BEAUTIFUL AREA,"\i am lithuanian, originally from seaside city of Klaipeda and I love to visit this place really often especially in summertime. Nida and Juodkrante are best places with amazing views! YES!!!!"
84,Highly unusual - a must see,"I walked about 10 km by the sea from Zelenogradsk to Lesnoje. Windy day, very few people, I enjoyed. Tried to walk also in the forest, but beach was better. The road for cars is too narrow for walking. Public transportation rare."
85,A must-visit in summer,"This is one of the most beautiful and unique place at Kaliningrad area. It's totally worth to visit. Beautiful dunes, a lot of wild life, dancing forest and clean wide sand beach. For the lunch or dinner I recommend to stop in Kurena cafe. They have very good fresh fish caught every day. Do not skip their doughnut holes with wild forest strawberry jam."
86,free in the Nature,"The landscape is very beautiful. There are several places for hiking or swimming, especially near Vysota Efa. The beaches are clean and not so crowded and at least in summer, the sea is good for swimming. There are several places for eating and also a gas station is there. It is very long and you need a car to get along. You should plan at least a whole day to spent there. An entrance fee has to be paid."
87,Make sure to take a guide with you,"Great national park with sights, parking lots, cafes, walking routes. Good sea views, sand dunes, wild forests and animals (if you are lucky to spot ones)."
88,Walking on the dunes,"Curonian Spit is one of the certain MUST DOs in Kaliningrad region. This mixture of the beautiful, sometimes unique baltic nature and some impressive engineering creations deserves a long, unhurried visit. I skip the sad part of how I went there with the public transport (if you have a chance, avoid bus 596) because once I got to the Spit itself all the disappointments of the road were completely forgotten.Curonian Spit has its own application which helped me to enjoy the nature adding to the magnificent view a good portion of knowlege.The Spit is very big and requires at least half of your day to see something, but I would not say there are tourist recreations here and there. The ones I saw frankly were not the examples of good choice for the lanch or rest. so my advice is to take some sneks with you.With limited time I only had a chance to see the part of the Curonian Spit and I definitely look forward to return for more."
89,"Dunes and dancing trees, fish and ice cream!","Compare to Lithuanian part of this half-island, Kurshskaya Kosa looks not so fascinating as it seems to be. There is no opportunity to visit this place without a private car, compare to Kaunas ferries.As it was mentioned, nature is amazing. However, Lithuanian part seems to be clearer also with better equipment."
90,Very nice,"The Curonian Spit is a beautiful stretch of land separating the Lagoon from the sea. It has wide sandy beaches, safe for children to play and paddle, and is carefully looked after to preserve its natural beauty and habitat of flora and fauna."
91,Beautiful place to see the Baltic sea!,This place dazzles you. The billowing dunes that go on into the distance are amazing to watch. It is worth coming here twice (like I decided to do) to really appreciate the full area. There are lots of different paths to take along the whole Curonian Spit. And moreover there are very few tourists here.To get there from Kaliningrad there is a public bus. I think it was number 592 that leaves from the Southern bus station (right next to the railway station). You go into the station and buy a ticket at the ticket counter which costs 139 rubles one way. There are four departures a day. I took the one at 9.35. The bus stop (number 8) is just in front of the ticket counter and there are lots of shops nearby to buy lunch. It takes two hours to get to the furthest point the Curonian spit: Morskoe. This is about 45km. The bus though stops 5-6 times along the way and also stops in Cranz.  I took the bus at 15.40 back. You can then buy a ticket in the bus on the return. There is a small friendly hotel in Morskoe where you can have a coffee whilst waiting for the bus back. 100 rublei for a coffee.
92,Worth the drive,"The unique geography of a lagoon and the Baltic sea on either side of the spit gives stunning view and as yet untouched by commercialisation. Though there are a few eateries, best to carry a picnic basket and enjoy the view. The dancing forests are also fascinating."
93,Not for those who do not value nature or require entertaining.,"Belongs at Unesco, this great park has an Unique history. The trail is approximately 41 km long till border and you can visit by foot, bike or car."
94,very good,"The Curonian spit separates the Baltic Sea from the Curonian lagoon. Hence on one coast you can be mercilessly blown by the wind, while on the other you can enjoy some warm sunbathing. The Nature is enchanting with trees on the dunes, high sand dunes, a sudden border of Europe splitting the spit in two, between Lithuania and a relic of Cold War, the Russian occupied Koenigsberg district. Nice sailing, tasty food, friendly people, Thomas Mann's house, good wine at Nida's Invino, you have a perfect blend between comfort of ""civilized"" world and a powerful Nature. It is mindblowing to think that in winter everything is covered by a thick layer of ice, and that in June it all comes to life with birds, flowers, trees...."
95,Absolutley amazing,"A hundered Kilometer sandy dunes separating the Baltic Sea fro a lagre lagoon. Wide white beaches and beautiful forests. An extraordinary landscape, blue skies."
96,Nice daytrip out of town,"The Curonian Spit is a 98 km long, thin, curved sand-dune spit that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea coast. The minimum width is 350 metres and the maximum width is 3.5 kilometres. The Spit is almost equally shared between Russia and Lithuania. Very popular in the summer. So wonderful walks to be had. Entry fee is 600 Rub per car."
97,not worth visiting,"Kurshskaya Kosa NP in Russian Kaliningrad region is a part of Curonian Spit thin strip of land dividing Curonian Lagoon from Baltic Sea. The other part of the spit is further north in Lithuania.Easy to get to Morskoe from Kaliningrad's Yuzhny Avtovokzal on bus #593, there are two departures in the morning. Coming back may seem slightly inconvenient, but there are a few more buses running to Zelenogradsk in addition to the Morskoe-Kaliningrad service. I'd do it this way if I was to repeat the experience: Kaliningrad to Tantsuyushchi Les (km 37), visit the Dancing Trees, walk to km 42 and visit the Efa dunes, visit the beach on the other side of the road, then bus from Efa Heights (Visoty Efa) either to Zelenogradsk or Kaliningrad."
98,One of the most beautiful sights,Thanks marina to take me to this man preserved wonder and it was pleasure hearing history of the region
99,overrated atraction,"Красота ! Чистый воздух! Танцующий лес впечатлил, интересные деревья! Рекомендую!!! Это обязательно надо увидеть !Beauty ! Fresh air! Dancing forest impressed, interesting trees! I recommend!!!This must be seen!"
