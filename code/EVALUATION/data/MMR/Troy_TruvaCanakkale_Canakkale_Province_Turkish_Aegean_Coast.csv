0,A lot more to see,"Most people think there isn't much to see in Troy but if you get the feel of the place and the various levels of troy it really is special. Read up the legend of Paris and Helen, stand by the stone roadway where hector rode down to meet Achillis. Look out at the land that was once water and imagine those 1,000 ships. The Iliad talks of this windy place with such poetry that when you stand at Troy you are with Homer and his words. Loved, loved the place."
1,Not much to see,"It is an interesting place only if you visit it with a tour guide that provides all the neccesary information for you to understand what you are seeing. Otherwise, you will see a lot of ruins without meaning. There is a lot to walk in uneven grounds so it is not a good visit for the elderly."
2,Bringing the Myth to life ,"It was good to go there and see a little bit about history.The place is not so big, You do not need so much time.İn summer is really hot."
3,Fascinating history!,Great to be able to see the site. The history is amazing and gives a little realism to the myths we read/see. Amazing how many layers of history with so many generations building on top of the last. Saw the replica horse at the site and then the wooden horse that was used in the movie is in cannukle town.
4,amazing historical site,very nice experience to see this very old city and how they build it . if you have read homer them you will be much more better
5,Myths and Legends,"Nice historical place to visit, but it is so much more attractive because of the famous story behind the site. We were there end of season so we had the whole site almost to our self. Combine this trip with a trip to the Canakkale Martyrs Monument and Anzac /Gallipoli"
6,Troy,"this is a long trek around the grounds but well worth it , the heritage is there to see everywhere you go there's pillars or coffins and parts of buildings great if you like archaeology"
7,The Troy Archeological Museum is top drawer!,Amazing place for a day out for history lovers. Definitely visit the museum and drive to this place is equally beautiful.
8,leisure trip to turkey,"Not much to see, just the ruins, that too incomplete. Troy Museum is the only attraction worth visiting.If travelling from Istanbul on a day tour, worthwhile skipping Troy altogether  to save time."
9,Interesting site,"The recreated wooden horse is not very impressive but a walk through the site is amazing. Do make sure somebody explains the site to you, or read about it in advance. The multi-layered city was very important in history even though Helen of Troy may have been a myth."
10,Eye Opening ! Archeological Wonder !,"Fun to see this Hollywood re-creation Located along the waterfront, it is nice to stroll around the area and pick up an ear of steamed or roasted corn.   Worth about 30 minutes"
11,The must for archaeology lovers,"a great place if you loved the story of troy or you love history all together, its a quick bus ride up from Canakkale and is definitely worth it. there is also a nice big field with beautiful flowers and views right at troy"
12,More than just the wooden horse ,"Not usually a fan of guided tours, but the truth is that not a lot of Troy is left standing and you need someone knowledgeable to explain the layers of Troy 1 to 7. We went with Hassle Free tours whose guide was splendid."
13,Going back to ones school days,"wasn't sure what to expect, its one of those places everyone has heard of and it wasn't a disappointment, I would like to recommend good footwear for this site as the wooden walkways can be very slippery, as with a lot of sites in this country there are a lot of cats and dogs, but like all the locals they are friendly"
14,Troy,Homer's Troy... You will need a good guide who can tell the story as you go around the archeological site. Need to visualize how the city was built and reimagine how it was during the reign of Priam.
15,Boring ,"This place is a must if you have a passion for history. Not well preserved or reconstructed, but being in such place takes you back to dates where it all begins and helps you to understand more what you've read."
16,A Legend Come to Life,Must see in the area of Canakkale. Great place to visit and soak up some history of the ancient city of Troy.
17,"Nice to see, but difficult to appreciate","There's a reason why all the photos posted are of the replica horse as there isn't really much left to see at Troy.  The site has been destroyed and rebuilt so many times it was hard to get a coherent picture of the size and layout.Worth going just to say you've been there really.p,s. the Trojan horse replica used in the Brad Pitt film is located in the town, not at this archaeological site."
18,A place of legend ,"There is no rebuilt of the ancient city and it is difficult to imagine how the ancient city looks like. There are about 9 cities built atop each other, named Troy 1 to Troy IX. To have a meaningful visit, a guide is preferred. Most of the time, we followed the boardwalk to view the ruins.The Trojan horse at the entrance of the ruins is a good place for memorable photos."
19,Now 10 Cities at One Site,A must see site but does require some imagination. The views over the plains to the sea in the distance helps you imagine the ships arriving to do battle. The Trojan horse is a little naff however the replica on the sea front in Canakkale ( left over after the filming of the movie Troy ) is visually better.As there are so many levels to Troy - each new settlement build on top of the previous one - it can get confusing but some of the remaining ' mud brick' walls followed by the 'stone walls' does help in picturing how far back in time this city went.I particularly liked the excavated road and ramp remains going through one of the city gates
20,Worth a look,The site offers ruins and a fake Troy horse that makes for good pictures. You need to be into History with a good set of imagination to enjoy this place.
21,Not much at first site...get a guide!,"Probably not many people have never heard anything about the Troy war… Even if the ancient Greek history was not your favorite topic at literature classes at school, most likely you have seen the movie with Brad Pitt. Anyway – if you’ll decide the visit Troy archeological site, make sure to do your homework and read a lot about its discovery and excavations. Otherwise you might be disappointed if you would be looking for remains of actual city of Troy. Note that it has been damaged seriously quite a few times, so there are not that many things to see there. Therefore you will really have to use your imagination! But once you’ll do that you can feel the breeze of ancient times!"
22,More than movies,"This is for archaeology lovers because it is one of the oldest sites. Therefore you need a bit more imagination viewing the area. There are nine layers to Troy starting with Troy I dating from 3,000 BCE, and ending with Troy IX at 500 CE. They label these layers for you to see. Heinrich Schliemann did much damage to the site in 1868 when he came and dug for gold using improper digging techniques, which was unfortunate. It is best to come with a guide to interpret the site."
23,Historical Site,"the open air ruins give you an idea of the past. Although most areas are still closed to public, you can see it from a distance. The Troy horse is there if you could climb the narrow stairs."
24,Horse,"Initially thought Troy was not interesting at all as compared to the other ancient sights in Turkey.  But was pleasantly surprised when we toured the ruins and learned about the history of the place. Actually being in a place that existed thousands of years ago,  stuff that you only saw in the movies is a remarkable experience. There's a lovely gift shop by the entrance/exit. Worth the visit."
25,The illiad,(June 2013) If you like Greek history then you need to check out Turkey. The troy site is very well marked and I was on the On-The Go tour there. He covered some of the layers of Troy and the theories. There are good books you can buy there with more detail on the history of the different layers of the site.
26,Awesome display of many eons of Troy,"Even though this has become commercialised, it is still worth the visit just to see the various ruins and eras that was Troy. The wooden horse statue is really a joke and to be honest I found it silly. The ruins are amazing and it was great to have a good guide to explain the various ages that were Troy. Not to be missed."
27,Unexpected ,"Great ruins and tour by guide, a lot more to this area than I had ever thought. Would recommend to anyone in the area to visit, with a guide to fully appreciate the ruins and history"
28,More relevant with a guide,I found nothing special in this place except heat. We got few photos clicked but still i don't understand the hype
29,Trip to Trois,"Everybody knows troy, but moderns remnants evokes disappointment. There are some old walls around the area and a wooden horse. You can get into it. Probably it is better to wait until the new museum opens."
30,You need allot of imagination,"Not the most impressive ruins in the ""cradle of civilization"" but a must see as the old ruins date back to at least 3000 years BCE and probably more. We visited this 9 level archaeological site with the 7 day classic tour of turkey with Viator ( also recommended). Compare the replica Trojan horse on site to the one in town donated by the 2004 American movie ""Troy""."
31,Truva,If you are touring Turkey then Troy is a 'must do'.  It is difficult to comprehend the age of the rock walls when we come from a country where European settlement is not much more than 200 years old.  Turkey really is one huge Museum and Troy is an eye opener.
32,Troy ancient city - must visit ,"This 4000-years-old legendary city is a fantastic place to visit if you love history. It is full of rocks, sometimes scattered about all over the place. Thus, imagination is needed. There were several cities built / re-built on top of the original ""Troy"" each time it was destroyed. ""Troy 6"" is what archaeologists believe is Homer's Troy, which was destroyed by earthquake based on the latest research."
33,Escorted tour,"Not really a great lot at the place, but just exciting to BE there at the site of ancient Troy. To get the most out of it, probably best to take a tour (I didn't). Walked the entire site in one hour."
34,Troy,"We visited Troy on a windy and cold day. The ancient city was very interesting, you need a guide to give you the full history which is what we had. However it does look like there is a audio available which would replace a guide. It is clear there is still much to find of this ancient city and only the surface has been scraped. The Trojan horse is a nice site but the ancient is much more interesting"
35,Worth the visit,"Worth going to Troy to see the site and the wooden horse but I did not know what to say about the horse only very Touristy, in my opinion you would only go once."
36,"Amazing Ruins, Lousy Guide","This place is quite a lot of work to try to understand the history of the place.  Lots of stones!  With seven levels of archeological excavations, it's a challenge to absorb.  But, they make if fun one way or another, including with the modern mock-up of a Trojan horse, great for photos!"
37,Troy,Makes you remember that people lived before you on your lands. 2-3 hours will be enough to see everything. Shop is terrible...
38,Brownie points for toiletries and tea/coffee making facilities !,The city visit was full of dissappointment. It is a small city where you will not see remain standing or restorated.
39,Troy ruins are a must see for fans of history,Really enjoyed this place. A place full of history. Great for a quite day out. Lots of walking involved. Highly recommended if you are in the area.
40,Nice place to visit,"I have always wanted to visit the city of Troy, it was very interesting and was very informative but as I had been warned prior to going, there is not a lot left there to see.There is plenty of information boards that fill in the blanks and explain what the site would have looked like, also there is a replica Trojan Horse there for you to climb up and look through.Worth the small drive out from Canakkale, happy to have crossed it off the list."
41,"這是Brad Pitt 主演電影"" Troy"" 內的木馬,但是實際看更有震懾的感覺。",Loved visiting Troy.  Well worth the trip.  We were told that there wasn't much there but I thought it was great.  I've been to many other ruins around the world and it was up with the best of them.  Happy to recommend it.  Amazing to think there is so much more of it for them to discover as apparently only around 10% has been excavated.  Might need to go back in a few years time.
42,Its an absolute gem!,I guess I’d you’re into ruins you’ll like this place but the “horse” replica is rather ridiculous. Disneyland could do better.
43,Helena? Priam? Odysseus? Where are you folks?,Interesting to visit the ancient city of Troy - best to have a guide with you who can explain the history behind the sites. Huge Trojan Horse structure sits at the entrance as well - a pity it was closed to visitors and we couldn't go up the horse.
44,Must to,"If you have no specific historical background, Troy is a great start. The ruines are made well accesible for everyone. If you are more experienced in history, it might dissapoint a bit, unless you take the time to discover it with a good handbook or a local guide. In that case though, you will have to ignore the groups of selfie taking tourists that rush through it. Nevertheless, a visit to the historical sites in that neighbourhood is not complete without Troy"
45,"Very old, but not much left.",Obviously the wooden horse is not original but it is very well done.   Incredible to be walking along historical paths and grounds.   Added bonus were the very friendly cats.   We went 2 years ago and would probably go again.   So much to see and hear about.    There was nothing we did not like.   Definitely bring a camera or at least a mobile phone and sensible walking shoes.
46,Overrated,"Part of my friends learned that Troy is in Turkey not in Greece.The horse experience is amazing. It does not resemble perfectly the original one, but it is still amazing. You can climb up to the top.The entire site, the ruins if the city, is captivating. It walks you through thousands of years of history.Recommend!"
47,TROY,Sadly Troy was the least impressive of all the ancient cities we visited. It’s great to see it and relive the store of Troy but the ruins just aren’t as impressive as other ancient cities like Asklepion or Ephesus.
48,Guided tour round Ancient ruins of Troy,"You have to use your imagination to appreciate this place since there isn't much left, alas. Some good sketches give you an impression of what it once looked like  Some work done in the early 2000s seems to have improved things but it's mostly just stones and a tacky reconstruction of the Trojan Horse"
49,A Mysterious Attraction,What a truely amazing experience to have been able to walk through the ancient ruins with the guide showing photos of the artifacts and illustrations of the sites. I was able to take many photos. I enjoyed the tour and would recommend Hassle Free Travel to organise this memorable tour.C. Ackland. Australia.
50,Guided tour with Rustem Aslan,What a beautiful place to visit . Lots of walking so prepare and carry water . It's amazing to look at the ruins which is still clearly visible .
51,Troy,"The talk of 9 cities built on top of each other is confusing. No decent plan exists that shows you how they were built or to identify them, Been there seen it. The replica horse is just that."
52,Truva Ancient City,"From childhood you read and hear about Troy. You see it in movies but trust me when you are finally there, the experience truly is remarkable.  You are literally walking in the same places that you read about.  The fact that so much of it still remains after all these thousands of years just makes the place that much more awe inspiring.  The walls, the layers showing how the different Troys were built on top of one another, the remains of the streets everything combines to truly give you the feeling of being in another time and place.  Yes the horse is ""touristy as hell"" but you know what, we loved it all the same.  You can walk up and take some pictures and it adds some fun to the place as well.  Take time to separate from your group once in a while and really take in the surroundings.  Its worth it."
53,Amazing! But go with a guide.,"Troy must be seen, good historical place and well maintained. There is a parking place where you can leave your car."
54,Istanbul ,"To see the Trojan horse is worth while. You can walk up inside it and look out of the open windows. You can then walk around the open air museum of old remains of the city of Troy. It is very interesting to see the way that the town was built so long ago (with none of the cranes or equipment we have available nowadays). Quite amazing how some of it is still standing after so many centuries. As it is open air with quite a bit of walking ... hats, sun cream and water are recommended.There is a somewhat over priced store selling souvenirs within the complex... but take note of the little souvenir stalls on the side of the road before you enter (much cheaper and supports locals)."
55,Historical of sparta and troy,One of the most interesting ancient cities in turkey. Dont expect to see too much but its amazing by its history and exciting by the feeling it gives you to see where those heroes lived and fough and fought for what actually!
56,Brilliant Day,Visiting Troy is like a fairly tale come true.  We enjoyed the walk through the ruins and the scenary is beautiful.  We climbed the Trojan Horse and enjoyed the peaceful moments inside.  Very nice experience.
57,Ancient Troy!,Excellent attraction. Lots of history and information. Suggest that you get a guide to show you around to get the best out the visit
58,Amazing historical tour surrounded by the heritage of thousand years,Included as part of our Gate 1 tour. Our guide made the walk through the rocky ruins interesting otherwise it looks like a bunch of rocks. You NEED a guide. Reading the information boards (which has good info) gets tedious after a while. Also if possible go early to avoid the school kids that really take away from the experience. Note it will probably be very windy.
59,Great tour,"Visiting Troy seems to be the thing to do when in this part of the world.  We were disappointed with the guide who had been doing this too long and seemed bored and hustled us through.  The complexity of the multiple cities is hard to digest on passing through quickly ,  and the site is still confusing.  A new museum has just open but was not included on the tour because of time allocated.  A quick visit of 5 minutes indicated it might have helped educate the visitors if adequate pre visit time was allowed as it contains many of the best artifacts"
60,INTERESTING PLACE TO VISIT BUT A GUIDE IS NECESSARY,"A visit to a place like Troy is incomplete without a guide. A good and knowledgeable guide will tell you about the history and the ancient city and the things kept around. Language is a issue in Turkey, so better to have a guide who speaks your language and can explain you about the place. Without a guide a visit to Troy will be just like a walk and a photo session on the wooden horse. Also better to read about it a bit before you visit it. A visit to this place is included in the turkey museum pass.If you like history you should definitely visit the place."
61,Myths,"Most of us may have watched the movie of Troy and by coming to this place, we finally witnessed the reality of the historical sites. Although, we are seeing rocks & leftovers, it gave us a good history lessons on Troy. A must visit for anyone who want to know more of TROY."
62,Exploring ancient Turkey,"There is a lot of dissention about whether or not this is the actual site of the Trojan War though all the evidence points to it.  Of the city of Troy itself there is not a great deal left - city walls, a gate or two, reconstructed columns - and it takes a deal of imagination to think of it being the site of Helen, Paris, the Trojan horse et al.  The site is easy to get round and very accessible but tending towards the commercialised with a 'horse' statue you can climb inside and 'Roman' characters with whom to take selfies if you're that way inclined!"
63,Interesting visit,"What a place to be? It is an experience to see the period of history and recall the greek myths. I thinks if you are around for any reason, spare two hours and visit the place."
64,More than  just Brad Pitt's horse,After seeing the many movies you get an impression of what Troy should have been. What still remains are mostly the foundations and fortifications. Plaques explain what you are looking at. The foundations indicate that Troy was huge and on the water but now is inland. It was rebuilt 9 times. Worth seeing to say you were there.
65,ruins of ancient Troy,"No Wow factor , there's lot of excavation remaining before it's a major tourist pleaser;  but it is still worth a trip and walk about if in the area.  Somewhat confusing with so. Any levels being excavated and all have different stories"
66,Informative tour,Initially I didn’t have much expectation but I was pleasantly surprised that it is quite big historical site with 9 old cities built on top of each other. Pretty interesting!
67,History trip,"We were lucky to get there when the park was completely empty. What can I say - for those, who love history it's a must. But I am not a big fan so I was a little bored with watching the stones around. Probably you should take the guide to understand what was what, but if you don't there are still boards with navigation."
68,Fascinating glimpse into ancient Troy,A must see as the area is VERY well maintained. While a lot of imagination is needed to make the history alive :)
69,Lots of history and myths..,"Troy is such an iconic venue, everyone has heard of it -- however, the reality is disappointing.  The site has a tired, neglected look and feel to it, and appears poorly maintained -- the tour is informative, but the boards with the explanations are deteriorating (and in some cases unreadable) and its not always easy to understand what you're looking at -- and the new information center and museum is still not open.  The wooden horse is a cliche -- the other one on the promenade at Canakkale is more realistic.If you're staying in Canakkale (to visit the Gallipoli memorials) then it may be worth a visit if you've nothing else to do -- but it's not worth the drive from Istanbul just to visit this site, it's a long way to come to be disappointed."
70,Lots of Rocks and Hokey Horse,"A short drive south of Canakkale, Troy is a most interesting place. The audio guide is excellent and very clear nd well worth 10 lira."
71,So much history dating back to BC 3000,"It was good to see But dont get your hopes up if you want to see heaps of treasures , they are all in other places .But  you do get to see how Troy was built and wrecked by people or earthquakes and alike .The history of the place is what it is all about and there is years and years of digging to go before it is all uncuvered"
72,Stunning history ,"Good, very good experience. The sight is fantastic, you see, why the nine cities were built there. The histroric place is well organize."
73,Troy museum and Troy ruins,"Nothing to say on the place, this is Troy, but something should be created in order to get this place more attractive and interesting.Just one horse, reconstruction, it is not enought."
74,Homer's Troy,You should visit this ancient place with a professional guide. Feeling the life belonging to 3000 years ago is fascinating.
75,It's a must beacause of its historical and cultural importance,We visited Troy and was amazed that the city was built on two lower cities.  You can feel the presence of the ancient Trojans and can imagine looking across from Troy to where the battle for Helen was waged.  A never miss if you are visiting Turkey.John & Gail Laney
76,Nice place to visit,This is a must do when one has a few days to spend in Turkey.The legendary story is brought to light and one is treated visually to the ancient artifact and the construct of the city walls.. whole 9 levels of them spanning across who knows how long exactly..Be prepared to spend at least half a day to wonder around the place and appreciate the intricacy of the ancient world.The wooden Trojan Horse at the entrance is a good remembrance to take home and to keep kids entertained at least for a while. There is a cafe near the entrance as well if one needs to rest and keep away from the cold in winter.A must visit place and truly enjoyable !!
77,Great for History Buffs,Wonderful ruins of the many cities which were built in this site. They have a replica of what they think the horse looked like but the ruins are the highlight. As usual in turkey expect lots of dogs and cats. They mind their own businesses and are well looked after.
78,Ancient ruins,"Lots of rubble and as I am not a history buff, I could not appreciate the ruins as its mostly rubble. I was on a guided tour and even then it was difficult trying to imagine what it would have looked like in the past.Having pictures taken with the wooden horse and climbing into it was ashamedly the best thing we did at this site. Even then it was not all that fantastic.If all you want is to take pictures of the Trojan horse, I would suggest you take pictures of the one in the waterfront in Canakkale."
79,Nothing too special. ,"History buffs will love this! For those not quite up on their ancient history, best to go with a guide for a more in depth look. It's an archeological excavation site, so I found it hard to understand without our guide pointing things out to us. There is a replica of the Trojan horse you can go up in. There are toilets and a shop and cafe on site."
80,Feel the Ancient,A must see in this region. It is better to combine with Gallipoli visit. Well organised park and specially very charming for visitors who are interested in old history.
81,Troy -  Homer's ancient city of Troy,"The ruins of Troy are just that, ruins. Don’t expect re-enacted or replica city. Plenty of information boards in both languages mean you don’t need a guide. We went when it opened and there were already 5 tour buses there as well. Plenty to explore at your own pace."
82,A must-see site during your stay in Canakkale!,"Very nice place to visit. The place is next to the sea. Very nice view to take a picture. When you continue to walk, there has a lot of restaurant and at the other there has somebody sell fresh fish"
83,A Fairy Tale Come True,"As enthusiastic readers of Homer, we have wanted to get to Troy for years.  Our guide was able to explain the 9 levels of the city, and the history of the various invasions.  He also explained the Trojan horse as not a horse but as an earthquake system that took down the walls.  Fascinating."
84,Revisiting the reality of History of Troy!,"The Museum is amazing. If you are in Turkey, some 250-300km far away from Trojan Ruins, maybe you could negotiate about price of Taxi transportation. I got price of 600TL(100eur) for drive in both directions (500km).The view of Museum is great(35TL) but if you want to see all Site the price is a little bit to high for Foreigners(315TL).For locals only 70TL...:(But most of the arthefacts found at the Ruins are exposed very well. Everyone who love History and Archaeology should visit it."
85,Amazing place,The site of Troy at first glance is not much...just a pile of old stones. But with a good guide like  our Mr Oran it can really come alive! He explained all the layers and different periods and pointed out details we would otherwise have missed. He related it back to Homers Iliad and Oddessey as well. Many only think of the Hollywood movie and if so  could be sorely disappointed. The Trojan horse replica is a cracker! Very tacky but good for a fun photo!
86,Depends on What You Are Looking For,Has always been on the top of my list. Was pretty cool finly seeing the place with my own eyes. I went with a tour group. Although it wasent all I thought it would be. I recommend a few hours to have a good look around.
87,History abounds even though horse is cheesy!,"OK, we climbed the horse too. It is a bit of fun and keeps your place in your photos! The archaeological site itself is much larger, shows 6 distinct layers of history/settlement (so far) and has excellent signs and interpretative assists. You can look out from the higher parts to the waterways where the boats came in. Walking through the ancient walls and looking a the construction detail and carving gives you a new view of the old legends. Walkways are easy to navigate."
88,Enjoyable historical site,"Fantastic place, made more impressive by having an engaging archaeologist as your guide; he puts everything into perspective."
89,"Home of the epic Greek tale of gods, men, and the Trojan War",Such a wonderful experience to be able to see and be in the same place as the many Greek heroes I read about as a child.
90,Fascinating,"Three nights in this hotel.  Travelling with a small group of people on a history tour.  Well located on sea front, easy walking distance to ferry, bazaar, post office, market.  Nice bedroom, comfortable bed, very adequate bathroom / toilet. Toiletries provided - big tick !  Tea/coffee making facilities in room - big tick.  Vast variety of different foods available for every meal.  Clean, tidy, well maintained. Reception staff had limited Englsh, which surprised me. ( Yes, I know. I should have learnt Turkish before I travelled).  Reception staff ( all male) often seemed less than interested in assisting, - language barrier was obviously part of the problem, but I suspect that better  training is needed.  Wifi was unreliable, and had limited strength - couldn’t download messages. Lifts worked well.Quiet except for yowling, fighting dogs at night. Not the Hotels’s fault. It is “ the culture” we are told, to accommodate and feed stray dogs and cats. The city is lousy with big stray dogs and skinny stray cats."
91,Interesting excavation site of epic Trojan war,First ruins that we visited on this trip around Turkey. Not well presented and not handicap friendly. Interesting. The replica trojan horse was an attraction. Good view from the top.
92,"Troy, Turkey","Troy is a must for anyone who visits Turkey, specially those who are interested in ancient history.   There is a wooden horse at the entrance of the site and there is an official souvenir and gift store which has amazing things at a good price. The ruins are very old and you would expect to see something greater but it's definitely a good experience. I'm not a scholar in ancient history but I really enjoyed it."
93,compare the two horses,"great place to visit, they also has a staff ready there with costume to take picture with you and all."
94,Archeological excavations,Not really the best place I have ever been to. Just a wooden horse and some broken rocks. Not worth the money
95,Great History ,"This is a fascinating place. Although built around Homer’s work it offers an insight into a very ancient site, archaeologists have identified nine very different habitations.Troy is probably best visited with the support of a knowledgeable guide.  We were fortunate to be with Mehmet working with Riviera Travel who was both knowledgeable and passionate about the history of Turkey."
96,Cool site,"we went here this january 2015 and its so happened that the weather was really bad. There is really not much to see on the site but it will depend on your guide on how he/she will keep you tune on the troy story,thank god ours was really good."
97,Excellent display of ancient history,"Probably 1 of the favourite ancient cities in the world thanks to Homer.I actually had pretty low expectations going in as kept reading reviews saying there is almost nothing left. Well I disagree the ruins were a lot more substantial than I thought.I got there early in morning but the heat was still brutal so bring water and sunscreen in the summer.You can get here by local transport, get the bus from underneath bridge. The first bus was at 9:30am, wish it was a bit earlier. It takes about 60-90 minutes to walk around the circuit. The bus back was at noon.If you are in anyway interested it's worth a visit if you are in Canakkle."
98,Fabulous ,"It was fantastic! I went back to 2500 BC ! The ruins of Troia, is a place you shouldn’t miss it if you are into history."
99,Amazing history lesson,For all the hype there was not a lot thereWould give it a miss. There are better places to visit. Not a lot of information.Not much to see.
100,Not much to see,We visited Troy with a tour guide who skillfully explained the site as we walked around. Though it is well known for the story of the Trojan Horse there is thousands of years worth of history to see here also. It may be less captivating without someone to explain what you're looking at but there are information plaques throughout the site.
101,When dreams come true ,"I loved this place, lots to see and read and spend time walking around on the board walks. This horse has nothing to do with the ancient Troy except from the movie."
102,Learning the History of civilisation ,Worth spending a couple of hours to appreciate the ruins unearthed in the 1800’s. There are nine layers / strata of with the first strata dated back to 3000 BC.  The picture with a plaque near the bottom of the foundation showed the bottom layer of the fortification wall and city dated back to 2600BC.The 30 foot tall Trojan horse was built in 1975 by a Turkish artist.
103,TROY,"You need to see this ancient town and take a enjoyable walk! The wooden horse .. is enormous.. and be careful when you get in it! The view while you are walking is really good! You can also take a good photos with ancient gowns! You dont need a guide, you have enough signboards! But if you have one.. use it ;)"
104,Troy,We love history and exploring old sites therefore we absolutely loved walking around and exploring Troy. Our imagination ran wild and the tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and made the experience more memorable.
105,Magnificent ,"Because we all know Troy thanks to the horse, the tourism department has duly constructed a fake horse that you can climb into and pose for pictures from. There are also actors in period costumes to add to the drama. However, if you are interested in history, skip this bit and head straight to the ruins. It is fascinating to see the various layers of the city, one on top of the other, all labelled and distinctly identified by the colors. The curved wall that blocks the views of anyone who is trying to spot enemies is enough to set imaginations racing and as you look at the vast ruins, appreciate the grandeur of a civilization long gone."
106,Ancient ruins,"The museum opened in late 2018 and is frankly amazing. You move up 7 levels corresponding to the ages of history of Troy and surrounding sites, seeing the artifacts and learning about the history.  The archaeological process is also brought out. Allow a good 2 hours with teenagers. As with most museums in Turkey, you can't understand why it isn't full of school groups.It is entirely separate to the Troy ruins which are tired and unimpressive, but obviously very significant and must visit.  The museum opens up the ruins and provides a rich understanding of the layered history of the area and empires."
107,way to comercial,Those interested in Homeric epics and history in general will love this place. The site has been made easily accessible with walkways and the signage is better than most other sites.
108,Absolutely must seen.,You can see the statue made of plastic here.It was used for the movie and then it was donated to the city of Cannakale
109,Must admit our guide really made this tour outstanding....,"One of the most important archaeological sites in the world. I visit it without a guide, but the written materials provided at the site are sufficient."
110,I wouldn't go again I guess ,We went on a private tour to this location and found it to be incredibly interesting - our guide from Crowded house tours was very knowledgeable.
111,Big name but small view. ,"I suppose the horse was inevitable. However, the site is fascinating and reasonably well presented. It is not dramatic but together with the story, it is well worth it."
112,Must see ,Nice place for photo and full of history. Nice history. We can see the horse of trojan.The story between troy and sparta. We can see the rest of the war.The toilet in here is clean enough.
113,One hour is enough ,To visit an ancient site like this is always a privilege. Our visit would have been improved by clearer sign boards as often we struggled to find where we should be looking. Would recommend that you visit the museum first.
114,Troy visit,The moment you walk into the ruins and realise that this place has been the carded of human civilisations for almost 5000 years....One is humbled by this site which has been a witness to 9 cities...... I can only say one thing it shows the indomitable human spirit
115,"You must know and love history and or the Troy's history otherwise, is rock over and under rock","This is a small site with layers & layers of history.  The engineers and architects in the Troy are truly magnificent ! They already have drainage & 2nd floor buildings! So I asked our guide what part of Troy does the movie Trojan war belongs to. Per our guide it is Trojan 6, and all the character in the movies all exists except the fact that Achilles died in the middle of war not at the end of the movie. The treasures of Troy are so vast that Greek had to invade Troy , the helen(woman) part is just an excuse. Our guide even pointed out the mound of soil where Achilles was buried. Thanks to one farmer for not selling his land, we still have Troy to visit nowadays 😊"
116,Learnt so much,"We had a local guide here, he wrote a book titled Troy.... Very informative. You must get a guide or miss out on the significance of this site."
117,Worth a visit if your into history,"This city needs no introduction. Start with a visit inside the horse and then check the immense site, where archaeologists still discover many things (see the well) and envision its old history."
118,An antique city with a tail to be told and lived,Decided to go there after watching the movie. Learned a lot of history. Take the tour to make sense of the ruins.
119,Wonderful ,Thoroughly enjoyed visiting this ruin site with ongoing excavations.  Learning the history of the site and area was incredibly interesting.  The city walls show the difference between constructions of different eras.  The nine layers of ancient cities are labeled at the excavations .
120,Go with a good guide.,visit to trojan horse in troy is relaxing and view is great. only pity is that most are stones remains except the trojan horse which is preserved
121,A legendary place to remember for the rest of your life,"Small,  but mighty,   I  was really exciting being there.     The horse is a nice treat.  It might not be as other archeological sites,  but it is worth it."
122,National cemetry,It is so much more than just a few stones. You can see the differents ages of built.I was transported in past. I really enjoyed it
123,Trip to Troy,"There's not a lot to be seen, but the excavations are interesting.  Our guide was good, giving us explanations of why Troy was rich in the first place, how it would have looked and why things changed.  He was a local guide, with fairly strong feelings about the riches of Troy being removed, first to Germany, then to Russia.   We were left with a hunger to read Homer.   This tour is worth about 1.5 hours of your time; however, the museum, which is to open soon, will provide much more information and artifacts, and could easily round out the afternoon.  I recommend seeing Troy if you are in the area, but not for a special trip from Istanbul."
124,Must go place in Canakkale,"Museum not open ( yet) due to...they don't know! you can visit Schliemann trench, you can climb the horse, but that is all..."
125,A place of layered ruins....,"Its nice to say you have been there, but if your seeing ancient ruins is on your list I would honestly put Ephesus much higher on your list.  Troy is a long day trip from Istanbul, Instead consider fling down to Izmir for a night.  I think you will enjoy Ephesus much more.  (domestic intra-turkey flights are very inexpensive on Atlas or Pegasus Airlines)If you have more time, the Pergamum ruins in the village of Bergama are also worth a visit.We visited in August 2014 -- Sorry for the delay in reviewing"
126,History trip,"Not being a history expert, I was surprised to learn this is the site of 9 Troys, #6 apparently being the one of legend. So lots of different types of walls, and limited artefacts from 4000 years. Not as fully excavated space wise as other sites, maybe because they had to go so deep for the differnt epochs. Without my guide would have been lost, though, as he explained the different piles of rocks so you could imagine the origins."
127,Take you back in time,"I have a bias when I write about ruins, historical rocks, and Troy. I love all tree and I read the Odyssey or Iliad twice, saying that who is reading this review must understand that go to Troy was a dream to me. I had read before that the site was only ""rocks', so I had no high expectations about the place. It was a wonderful experience for me. We drove ~400km (270 Miles) from Istambul to Troy taking a good highway. It took ~ 4h driving and the road view is beautiful and as a bonus, we crossed the Dardanelles Strait at Çanakkale the shortest distance between the Geliboli (Or Gallipoli in English) peninsula to Asia. This is the point where the historians believe Darius and after,  Alexander - The Great crossed from Asia to Europe and vice-versa with their troops. In Çanakkale the Horse from the movie Troy is exposed, in the open air, for free, in one square near to the boat debarkment. From the city to Troy is about 30 min.  The Troy site is well preserved by the Turkish parameters and you can see several stages of digging and levels from the IX cities of Troy that were erected there. You cannot expect a full reconstructed city in a place w/ more than 6500 years old in an area with several wars, cultures, warlords, and earthquakes. To me the knowledge that in that place so much history and people passed it was enough. The emotion to touch and set my feet were Ulysses, Achilles, Menelaus, and Helen lived and breath worthed the visit. You still can visit the Gallipoli WWI sites when you're coming back from Troy on the European side and cover 7 millennials of history on the same day!"
128,Stories from your childhood comes to life,Have seen many of the sites of Rome and rate this higher.  An excellent job being done by Archeologists has brought to light amazing displays of many different Troy settlements going back 1000's of years.  A must see in Turkey
129,Loved It!,"City of Troy, this historical place lets you know about the civilizations lived, progressed on this land, took at least an hour to walk around the ruins although not so much left, but still gives you an idea. The horse gets the most attraction although it is not the original one neither. 25TL entrance per person."
130,So loved,"Compared to other archaeological sites in Turkey it rates only average. That said, its interesting seeing how cities upon cities were built over 1000 years with different styles.The wooden horse didn't excite, however for kids or those who have seen the movie, its good to recount the story.Wouldn't drive past, but wouldn't travel long distance to visit."
131,very nice,Saw the Troy ruins. The drive to up here was awesome. It was just like the movie. We saw the Aegean Sea on the way. The Horse's tail had been damaged and we could not go up. Overall if you like history its worth a visit.
132,Interesting and worth a visit,Just a tourist attraction. The wooden horse is a gimmick. Only went there because our tour itinerary stopped there.
133,Need a tour guide... and tome,"Nothing much honestly speaking, unless you like ruins. The wooden horse in the city center in Canakkale looks much better than the one in Troy."
134,Trojan Horse,Troy is uninteresting piece of ancient history. The ruins were very impressive and the stories of ancient Troy very interesting. Defiantly worth a visit. Didn't see Brad there though.
135,Much more than expected!,I did not know what to expect - what I found was a very interesting set of ruins - some 9 different levels of the city of Troy. Well worth the journey.
136,Ancient city of Troy,"Looking at the remains of the ancient city of Troy there are many parts of the city that have been restored and still under excavation. You will need a tour guide which explained the fascinating history of Troy and various layers of the ancient of city being build on top of the many times destroyed city plus why the city walls were build this way in order to prevent the attackers conquering the city! You can easily spent a couple of hours provided there is an experienced tour guide with you, if not you will be walking aimlessly as there is NO sign boards explaining the structures you are looking at."
137,A place where legends are revealed,Apart from the wooden horse and a dress up for period photo's there's only the ruins. I would not take small children here because they would soon get bored.
138,Is it a myth??,"It is truly an amazing experience to be in such a historical location, definitely worth the trip!! The new museum is very good, both beautiful and very educational, no problem at all going here on your own. The ruins themselves are in quite bad condition though, so I would definitely go with a guide to understand what you're looking at. Mustafa is a wonderful guide, knowledgeable and witty. He even wrote the troya guidebook that you can buy there ;). Look for him in the restaurant just outside the entrance to the ruins, where they also serve the BEST gözleme of your life!!"
139,A visit to Troy City,I went to this place and at the far end there are ruins of the city. The film Troy is made in this area and the wooden horse is in the middle of the city. Is this ma myth of a true story?  In the ruins still under renovation and digging for the any sign is also going on. So far no pieces of wood is found. To enter in this place you to purchase a ticket. A go place top visit and refresh your memories in the history.
140,Too much hype ,Really enjoyed visiting the old ruins of Troy. Was a couple hours bus ride from our accomodation in Çanakkale.I recommend a purchase or loan of a book that gives an overview of the different layers or different timelines of ‘Troy’ and shows what the city would of looked like.If you enjoy the story you’ll enjoy the visit.
141,Fabulous,"We came here around may 2017. The weather was very nice. And they have ruins from ancient city of troy. But sadly dont expect too much about the ruins because not much to see especially if compared with acropolis, or celsus. But the giant horse in the entrance is a nice touch."
142,Really impressive ,We got to this place on afternoon. We did the tour by ourselves and got public transportation to go and back. Just be aware on bus timetable on the way back. We missed the 5 Pm bus and we waited till 7:30 pm to get the bus back to downtown. It worth visiting if you like history but Little was remained in the area. Troy was reconstructed 10 times and it’s impressive how archeologists are trying to separate them on their searches. Read before getting here.
143,Troy(Truva),"I have always wanted to see troy and the site does not disappoint. It is an amazing archaeological site. The amazing history that can be seen in all the layers of construction is mind blowing. There are also artist renditions of what the city might have looked like when inhabited that will leave you in awe. I would recommend this place for everyone. If you are in Turkey, you should visit it. The facilities are not bad either. Clean washrooms, nice air conditioned gift shop. There is even a field where you can find column capitals lined up in the dozens. All from different time periods with different designs."
144,Worth visit for historical relics lovers,I visited here from Istanbul- be warned it's 5 hours each way to the drop off point then  a ferry and another 30 minutes to the site. Fortunately my trip included breakfast and lunch with a stop off on the way back where you could eat dinner if you wanted. The actual site was really good and the guide ( I was lucky enough to have a guide to my self ) was really informative and was able to compare and contrast other sites as well as give a good history of the excavation and the people who started the work and why. There are 2 horses to see one on the actual site and one as you get off the ferry which was from the film with Brad Pitt. If you keep your eyes open there is a third horse at the side of the road near a cafe as well. I wouldn't do the same journey again - it was an awe fully long day on the bus ( probably too much for children) but I believe you can combine tours and stay out overnight which might work out better for some people
145,Back in history,"Very lucky to have visited a place which appeared in many books on the Trojan horse and its associated legends, sort of dream fulfilled for me."
146,A Work In Progress,Hard to comprehend the age of this place and to understand the real significance of everything that has happened here over the centuries. Well laid out and easy to walk around but a guide is essential to really give depth and insight to this ancient site.
147,The Trojan horse,The historic archaeological site of Troy is truly fascinating.  We booked a guided tour from local travel agents Hellespont Travel who were really accommodating.  They’re situated close to the main Port.  The Tourist Information centre can give directions.  Definitely worth using the local travel agents in Canakkale.  Not necessary to book beforehand. We were driven to the site and prior to entry we picked up our guide who was extremely knowledgeable as he was an archaeologist working on the site. The history of Troy dates much further back in time to the legendary tale from Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.  We learned so much about the historical site that provided clarity and made sense in terms of the geological structure and the legend of Troy.  Would definitely recommend a guided tour. Without one it’s an archaeological site.  It’s a site not to be missed because of its historical content and because it’s so well preserved you learn a lot from going there.
148,It’s Troy! (But you need a good imagination),"Despite all the glory of the name, the Troy site does not seem remarkable at a first glance. It tells a very different story, though, the one of the history of modern archaeology, as you can see the results of amateurish methods that Shliemann used in the 19th century. It is really impressive to view all 9 layers of Troy at one glance"
149,The Fall of Troy: The Trojan War & Horse,"If you have time, drop by this place and transform yourself back to the ancient!It is good place to visit if you love history."
150,Awesome ,"I don't have enough words to express my thoughts / feelings about this place. Truly awesome, the history of the city. 2000+ BC, WOW. Really kool place, a must see"
151,Beautiful,We went on a trip to Troy booked through Crowded House nice luxury coach and lunch included The tour round Troy was very interesting made more so by having a very knowledgeable tour guide an afternoon well spent well worth the money.
152,A must,1 hour is enough to visit but after completing proper center and Museum it would be great place for all.  approx 6+ hours rad journey via Istanbul would be hectic but overall good
153,Worth A Gander,"Nothing spectacular.  95 percent of the stone work has been rebuilt or is reproduction.. at least they are honest about it. Refreshments on site limited to pop and ice creams. But decent cafe 2k up road.Worth a stroll round and perhaps a mecca to the time team watchers,  but an hours stop off your journey at best."
154,I went twice and can only say if you don't take a Guide that speaks your language you are wasting your time.,"You cannot imagine how bad this site is. WIth less than 20% excavated in past 80 years, it is just a waste of time and money to go there."
155,"A great place to visit, no matter what",I came here with my family and a very knowledgeable guide. We basically followed the guide who led us around the pathways explaining the full history of Troy and the different stages of Troy from antiquity through to it’s demise and then rediscovery and what happened to it’s many treasures. This is one site where you will definitely benefit from having a tour guide. He truly made the experience of visiting Troy come alive. There are many around. We used a local guide from Fez Tourism. An excellent experience.
156,Requires Imagination,I love my countyWhat a history is buried in these landsIt is place you kust visit and read and learn the storySeing the movie is not enough you should walk on the path
157,The Troy Ruins,An absolute must see. Far and beyond more than what we expected. But would recommend to do a tour with Hassel Free Tours
158,"Great History, Familiar Story, Easy Walk",thanks to our guide burak who was very knowledgeable about the place.he gave us a lot of information and made our experience unforgettable.
159,Amazing ancient site : easy to see why it was chosen,"The point of Canakkale city trip is the original horse of Troy & ancient Troy city with many places to go. Do not hesitate to buy one small horse in their official museum , it will help you to member this place when you get old."
160,The old Troy made accessable for all,The ruins at Troy are not as engaging as most other sites.  We were lucky in that we had an informative Tour guide who told us about the area.  That helped as you really need the information to bring it to life.
161,History,"With the exception of the fake horse we really enjoyed our excursion to Troy.   What we didn't realize that the city is made up of many different layers dating back thousands of years.  While the ruins are not as well preserved as others we've been to, just glancing over the field mentioned in Homer's epic was astounding."
162,Disappointing,"Personally, I really love history and Homer's Iliad so I was fascinated by having the opportunity to walk among the ruins of this magnificent part of our ancient history. That said, there's not a great deal to see there although the ruins are impressive in their antiquity. If you're wanting to see fantastic columns stretching into the sky or impressive steps leading up to arched openings to majestic views of the sea, you may save the time you've reserved for this tour and spend it elsewhere in places where you can see those things. There are many wonderful things to see in Turkey if you're a fan of ancient history. This one, however, is more intrinsic than visual."
163,Brief visit to historical site,"The main attraction is the Troy archaeological site situated very close to Çanakkale town. Whenever you visit, it's always a pleasure to check every stone on this site, discover layer by layer what the real history says and understand what is behind the myth. My only recommendation is to go with a good guide and a group interested in history. This is important because the first time I went there I joined a group of 3 guys that stayed almost all the time taking photos inside the horse in the entrance and we lost precious time to walk around all the place. In addition, Gallipoli is also close to the city and you can visit the famous place of Gallipoli campaign during WWI. The place is incredibly popular among Australian, Newzealander, English, and French citizens because it's closely related to their history."
164,Troy Historical Attraction,Obviously had heard of Troy but seeing it firsthand and having our guide talk us through it made it so much better.So much didn't know or had been misinformed (movie so wrong) and seeing it all close up and walking around it filled in a lot of what wasn't known.
165,"""Blown Away""","This ancient town and ruins take you back in time.  Imagine how it might have been then, experience it with the audio guide.  Take pictures with the recreated Trojan horse, wear costumes and have pictures taken - great memories.  Entrance fee feels a bit expensive but children are free."
166,One of the Greatest Experiences of my Life,We had received different information about Troy. I am so glad we decided to visit. Our guide was really terrific which I am sure added to the experience and our understanding of the site. The history is astounding and the architecture for each Troy had me totally enthralled. If you are even wondering about a visit I would suggest you  take the time and have a guide with you to enjoy the tales of long ago.
167,Worth to see!,"You can see what is left behind ancient troy. Some  well known structures can be seen at Berlin Museum, 14 level of establishment of Troy can be understandable at open area Troy Museum.  This is not my first visit the museum. Service facilities renovated and more convenient for tourist. Books, documents , information booklets are available at the shoping area. You need to spend at least 4-5 hours to make complete tour. Audible support or professional guides can helps your visite with small amount cost."
168,Better than advertised,"The Trojan horse at the ruins is just a tourist attraction. (I think the Trojans might have noticed soldiers looking out of windows!) However, the ruins are the real deal. They believe that the famous Troy was at level 6 out of 9 levels of civilizations. There were explanations displayed to let you know what you were seeing. You could do a self tour if you wanted. There is a nice wooden walkway around the ruins, so having to worry about uneven ground is not such an issue. We had seen Mycenae back in 2009, and wanted to see the other side of the Trojan War, and we weren't disappointed. Tip: Go see the Trojan horse from the Brad Pitt movie, it's down by the waterfront restaurants. It's way more believable looking!"
169,Interesting Historically but Not much to see.,"My trip to Turkey was special not for Istanbul or Cappadocia which are mostly highlighted. It is for visiting the ancient city of Troy. The Trojan horse that you have seen in the famous Troy movie, you can see it in real. The ruins of Troy is 30 mins drive from the city center. I do not have words to explain the beauty of the city that stands on the coast of Dardanelles. You can take taxi from your hotel to visit the ancient city of Troy."
170,Troy Tour,"Troy is only 30 minutes by car/taxi from Canakkale and is a must-visit place if you are in the region. Visitors will enjoy the tour around the ancient city far more in the company of a local guide. I can highly recommend local guide Mr Mustafa Askin, who owns the cafe you will encounter on arrival at Troy and who has worked as a guide for 40 years at the site. He is the ultimate Mr Troy! You will see the approximately 10 layers of the different era habitations that have existed at the site, Troy being one of the more recent ones. There are also great views also out over the plains that were the alleged battlefields of the 10-year Trojan war and the Dardanelles are visible also in the distance. The setting is stunning."
171,Good to see,"Just to be at Troy and absorb the atmosphere, to be where so many famous people from the past were. I dispair at tour guides and the one here did'nt disapoint me with inaccurate facts. It was city 6 attacked by the Greeks. An amazing place to see if you have an interest in ancient history."
172,"Troy is Troy, but .....","So, this place is kind of amazing, but it's pretty small. I was anticipating that, between my husband and myself (we both tend to dawdle at historical sites) we would need minimally 4 hours, but we did it two times round in 3. Things are well-preserved and educational signs offer you a great deal of history."
173,Great area,Fantastic. Had a great guide who made the tour very enjoyable. Lots of knowledge at a comfortable pace.
174,Historic site worth a visit.,"I was expecting a more interesting tour but shocked that we were the only two persons in this tour. Our guide Hasan was very friendly with a good information. Nice to see the huge wooden horse or Trojan or what they call it Troy. Went inside the horse, dress olden Greeks with weapons and had a nice tour in the ancient city of Troy. Great walls, blocks, roads, ramps, gates and many others.  This tour will be better for history lovers. Anyway we enjoyed our visit. Thanks for our guide Hasan for making this tour fruitful."
175,Worthwhile visit once in a life,The remnants of an ancient city steeped in history. Well worth the visit but only if you have a guide - without one it's difficult to understand what you're looking at (bearing in mind the city is from 3000 BC and therefore largely in ruins).
176,Great place ... For real history nuts. ,"I went with a tour group. I am glad my tour guide was able to walk us through and explain things. If I was on my own it would not have made much sense to me. Fascinating to see the old ruins but some more English information around the site would have helped.Even some models of what the different cities possibly looked like would be good.A famous historical site, pleased we went but could be improved."
177,Must see ,Visiting Troy is well worth the detour. Only 30 kms from main road and 15 mins drive from Cannakale. Layers of Roman ruins well preserved and good signage. Option of audio guide is available. One area shows 7 layers of civilizations that are being excavated. Great bathroom facilities. Allow sat least 1 hour for this visit.
178,Very interesting area and ruins,"Always wanting to go to Troy, we simply decided to go. Aside from the fact that the ticket person was a real dingleberry, we went in. Unfortunately for us, we came at the end of the day, with no guides. As a result, we simply walked all over the dog sites, trying to deduce for ourselves what exactly we were looking at. Some of the signposts were seriously rusted or condensate, making it difficult to read the city explanations. On top of that we were running out of time because the place was closing soon.Basically, if you’re going to go, go midday with a tour guide, that  way you will appreciate it more. It was still amazing to see an old human city, but due to constraints, the experience was underwhelming."
179,3 words... WASTE OF MONEY!,"When we visited , was more a last minute decision , so we were not really shure what was there . But once arriced there we didn't regret it . the only horrible thing is the horse at the entrance. The one in Çanakkale is more well done"
180,Great,"A fascinating trip. If you are interested in history, do visit. The archaeological remains make for a great visit. Do not however go looking for excitement or major relics from the Trojan War. The Trojan horse is a left over from the Hollywood movie Troy and make a good photo op."
181,"The horse is touristy, the site much more interesting",Challenging to visualize given this city had been rebuilt so many times...each newer civilization taking the residue of previous civilization to build their own. Fascinating to contemplate how myths can lead to discoveries...You teally should climb inside the horse when you ate here...
182,Must see,We've all learnt about the Trojan horse and so it was amazing to see a replica - better still to see the ruins of this ancient city with easy to follow explanations of the different epochs which have been unearthed.   The cafe was disappointing and so it is best to come prepared with a sandwich! Drinks were available but the advertised food was not.
183,Sensational site with a sensational guide,"I wanted to see this ancient city for quite some time and I have to say, my expectations came true! It's interesting to see all the old layers of the city and the views of the surroundings were very nice too."
184,Little Left,"Don’t expect too much. It IS Troy, but it’s also 3,000 years old! I would recommend the 10lr audio guide to help bring it to life.I was there on a (wet) Tuesday in October at midday. No one else around!"
185,Must see before die.,I was looking forward to coming hear sicne we've all watched the movies and heard about it in school. Though other then the giant horse to take a picture with there isn't much to see here.The ruins are nothing to really take pictures of and it's just more alot of history then site seeing.
186,Imagination required,"If you don't like history, just give it up. To be honest, the huge wooden horse is really ridiculous."
187,Troy,"We were fortunate to have a guide and to be frank....you need one. Without a guide you basically see a pile of rocks!This was not a highlight of our trip to Turkey but it was interesting. The Trojan horse from the movie is in Canakkale.....it's fibreglass, not wood. There is another highly photographed one at Troy that is wood, and even a crook looking one on the drive there that looks more like a llama!"
188,Tresure!,I visited this place with family. The wooden horse is very huge and nice. I is next to the beach which make your visit worth seeing both the horse and the see and its also in the center of the city of Canakkale so you will not waste any time visiting it. I advice you to visit it and take some nice photos there.
189,Enjoy the legend and the facts,"To view a site which has uncovered over 4000 years of history is mind boggling. I am sure that the construction of the various walls, ramps and such will provide much insight to the engineering ability of a historic society. While the water has receded in the past century or three, it is easy to imagine how Troy defended its city against numerous attacks, finally to succumb to trickery."
190,Confusing,"Troy was on my list of must see ancient sites.  In my mind I had a grandiose vision of what i would see there - I think because I've read the Iliad so many times i thought I would actually see the events of the war happening (Down from the peaks of Olympus he strode, angered at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver. The arrows rattled on the shoulders of the angry god as he moved, and his coming was like the night - Iliad BK1).  But i had read that the site was pretty shoddily excavated and was expecting the worst.  However, I was not disappointed with my pilgrimage to Troy.  As much as i appreciated Schliemann's finding this site, his archaeological diggings did also destroy parts of the site...I believe we must somewhat forgive him.i went through the site with a small group and learned where the levels of the site were and where the various buildings temples locations etc were (most groups move through the ruins far too quickly - 2 other groups quickly passed us along the way - so ensure your group meets your needs). After the group finished, i understood the layout of the site and i was fully oriented, i took myself through a second time at my own inquisitive and leisurely pace.  I enjoyed over an hour alone wandering Troy - there was literally no one else on site excepts the ghosts of antiquity..  For the most part there is a path that you must follow in Troy and you cannot deviate from the path (wooden walkway and ropes) so you can cannot wander the area as freely as some of the other ancient sites i have visited (understandable, considering the traffic that visits in any year).  i could have easily spent a day but had to catch a local bus back to Canakkale (take this bus from the little corner restaurant/souvenir shops down the road). If you're lucky, there is a local author and tour guide in this shop - Mustafa Askin.  If you don't get a chance to hire him at least grab a copy of his book ""A Revised Edition TROY"""
191,troy trip,The excavations at Troy are amazing. The replica of the Trojan horse is impressive and one should take the effort to climb in.Beware the steps are steep and especially when one goes to the second level one should take extra care. Parents with smaller children should take precautions as there is no safety railing on the top level and children should be well supervised.The city excavations are well signposted and lots of information is given on the various boards at each stop. One can use the audio guide or just read up the information at each viewpoint.
192,"Fascinating, excellently set-out and preserved open museum",Enjoyable day at Troia. Learnt much about the history of Troy. Our guide was a true Trojan & his enthusiasm rubbed off on me. Well worth the visit!
193,Great for a sense of history,"I think may is the best month to visit such a big open area. Later will be much more hot. We visited there with 4 children, 2 at age 2 and the rest at 6 years old. It was quite interesting for the boys at age 6. You can climb up inside the wooden horse. The stairs are steep so it is dangerous for kids. The parking lot is 5 tl. The entrance is 25 tl if you dont have a museum pass. With Is Bank credit card, the entrance is free. 6 years old kid is also free."
194,Authentic food!,"Am I the only one who thinks this way? This place is an absolute disaster! And the entrance fee is 25TL ($7+)There is absolutely nothing to see other than a horse and a whole lot of rocks! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!Maybe if you are into archeology is maybe sorta worth it but there really isn't anything to see here!I took the local bus from canakkale for 6TL each way, got dropped off at 1:15 and took the 2pm bus back. The path is marked for the route and you can walk it in 20 minutes."
195,I found it ok,There is a souvenir shop about Troy. Including a small wooden horse. You have to buy back. If you are interested. Please see the open-closed schedule. I went to close up. There is less time to explore.
196,Good display,"Unreal!! Must see!! Apparently some people say it's not worth it but that is absolute rubbish! Those people must of thought Troy was going to look like it did in the movie and probably thought Brad Pitt would be there waiting to say hello to😂 But in all seriousness it is very cool and a must see! Troy is so old and what it has to offer is awesome, guide needed though I wouldn't do the tour by yourself."
197,Big name and that it is,"Whilst the story of the Trojan horse is only a fable, the story of Troy is amazing. Cities built on top of cities, built on top of cities. There is even a site at Troy where they have excavated out to show seven levels of civilisation built on top of each other. A must see"
198,8 days in Turkey,"This was an unscheduled stop, and was pleasantly surprised.  We learned a lot and saw live stories I only read in high school.  The most fascinating thing I learned is the fact that actually there had been nine Troy (Troia) cities - one built on top of each other from pre-historic times of dried mud huts with doors on the roof to the Roman empire.  The Hellenic time happened during the 6th ""city"" of Troy.I realized that it was sad that, going into the city, all I could think of was seeing the Trojan Horse when there are many, many more fascinating discoveries and finds n Troy.  By the way, the mythological horse, if true at all, is long gone since it was made out of wood from ships.  A replica stands in the port town of Canakkale used in the movie of Brad Pitt."
199,Beautiful site of the epic city,"Not much to see. Just the feeling, that I've been there. Ofcourse, if you ponder a bit, it's an awesome feeling that you are standing on a site thousands of years old."
200,"Definitely interesting and well-done, but smaller than you think.","Went to troy on winter vacation. Nice place to visit. Make sure you bought the unlimited museum card for visit all museum, since the entrance fee quite expensive. You can finisht tour inside the ruined placed for 1 hour."
201,Wonderful,"Having studied this at school for about 3 years on the trot, it was great to finally visit. I had a great guide too, which is a bit of a must, as there isn't a great deal to see otherwise.That said I really loved it."
202,If in the area call in.,As impressive as it sounds inside it is a bit of dissapointment. It's quite complicated there are several cities on top and almost impossible to understand. Plus nothing major is standing still. It was very complicated for us
203,History everywhere!,Troy was one of the places I've always wanted to go to if I had a chance to and it didn't disappoint. Although the site is relatively small ithas some impressive ruins. I strongly recommend you visit this site with a guide.
204,Worth the visit,It was built before bc 2500. Homeros written Odessa in truva.  It's real old town and you can see ancient life. Can understand troy war.........
205,Trip to Troy,Excellent day at Ancient ruins of Troy. Very knowledgable guide Ibrahim. Learnt more from him in one day than all my years at school. Highly recommend him as a guide. Great guy with a wealth of information.
206,Interesting,"The site is in real ruins.  Its very shocking to see how badly Henry Schliemann organized the dig here, and sad to see and realize that if this dig had been done properly, how much we could have seen and learned.  However, with imagination the site gives us a road map to let our mind conjure up the marvel of Troy."
207,Impressive piece of History,We took a tour to see the ancient city of Troy and despite the cold weather and rain we enjoyed it thoroughly. You need a guide to explain you the history and evolution. The signs are not very clear and it is difficult to understand as excavations continue and some parts are really destroyed. If you love history this place is highly recommended. The place though is very destroyed.
208,Troy is mother to us all...,We booked a truva tour from the hotel. Lasts about 3 hrs alltogether. Be sure to book a guide who will inform you of the history behind the trojan civilisations
209,Just being in this place is an experience to remember,"Yes, there is a wooden horse. And the entrance to the ancient city, where the horse entered the city, is indicated. Most astounding however, is to observe 14 civilisations sandwiched on top of each other. Insightful. Do visit this ancient landmark."
210,Troy,"Even arriving early on an October weekday morning we found Troy to be swamped with tourists.  I can't complain, because I am one of them; however, we are a bit snobbish and don't like sharing our experience with so many people at the same time.   If you read the history of Heinrich Schliemann's  excavation before visiting the site, it will be a lot more interesting to see.  Troy is worth a visit for its historical significance, but it has neither the ambiance nor very interesting ruins to see (in comparison to many other places in Turkey).    The good thing is that it is a relatively small site and can be experienced quickly."
211,Chandler Family,"I have been there for many times and every year there goes worse. And I am very disappointed about the speed of excavations and restorations. There are many stones and structures but almost none of them hasn t labeled and tells nothing to visitors.This year it s Troy s year but only thing that I saw there new is money sucking merchandise shops. Especially photographer at there is very rude and expensive. None of the staff, especially higher ranks who are decision makers, in there hasn t read the Iliad and Odysseus. Because of that there are nothing about famous battle of Troy, Achilles, Hector and Agamemnon."
212,Not as expected ,"Most people in this world have heard or read about The Trojan Horse, the assault on Troy by the Greek forces and many movies have been made, the last one starring Brad Pitt back in 2004.Well here's a chance to visit this site that's a mix of facts and fictions.The modern built wooden Trojan Horse at the entrance may be kind of kitschy, nevertheless it is a tourists magnet for photo ops.A beautiful day made it enjoyable though the crowd can be a bit much."
213,Amazing,"If you watched the Brad Pitt movie, ""Troy"", then you would definitely enjoy this tour. You'll also see the trojan horse used in the movie."
214,Very Interesting,"The two wooden horses are totally different. The one left behind after shooting the movie is more beautifully designed and bigger. It is located near the harbour and good for photo taking. The smaller one at the ruin site is ugly, but with stairs to climb up to the two levels of windows where your friend can take photo from the ground while you stick your head out of one of the windows.Be careful when climbing up the ladders and the bird poo is a deterent to those who are brave to go up there."
215,Lot of layers of history there ...,"I booked through Viator. What I loved about Troy was how it was so amazing to see ruin after ruin stacked on top of each other.  There are the mud bricks from Troy 1 and 2, then the hastily fortified Troy VI-VII (Homer's Troy), followed by temples left by Alexander the Great (Troy IX). It's all still very clearly a city and you can *feel* Homer's epic in the walls.With that said, we missed the museum because our guide didn't have time. I get this in that it's a 5 hour trip each way from Istanbul. But....we stopped four times (once for breakfast, once for lunch, once for the guide's gift shop, then again for dinner) as well as, instead of tell us about the city in the bus, he waited until we were in the museum to tell us about the history (while we waited around). It would have been SO easy to trim at least an hour from it (maybe by making dinner - only at a gas station, anyway - no one even ate) 15 minutes, give us the opening spiel on the bus, and miss the stupid gift shop (the ruins have one anyway), which would have allowed us to at least *glance* at the brand new museum.(As it was, it was a 17 hour trip of which we spent maybe 45 minutes in Troy which is very uncool to put it mildly.)If I had to do it again, I'd rent a car from Istanbul and go by myself. That way I could see the amazing ruins (and read the cards - he moved too fast for me to even read about what we were seeing), then SEE THE MUSEUM THAT HAS EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN EXCAVATED. (As well as take my time admiring the views, reading all the notes, etc.)So definitely worth a trip if you're in Istanbul and are a fan of history, archeology or literature. But don't go with Viator. Just get your own car. After getting out of Istanbul, the freeways are clear and easy to navigate."
216,What a place 💙,"Our first stop in our group tour for the region of Canakkalae, the historical civilization of Troy made famous by countless stories and movies by the likes of Brad Pitt and Eric Bana.Entrance to the historical park is 25tl. And you greeted by a large Trojan horse replica ( a corny version though) for tourists obligatory photos. Further into the park are the ancient ruins of supposedly Troy civilization through different millennia where one civilization built above another through time. There is a wooden walkway through the ruins with info stops at strategic points. Not disabled friendly though. Tour can be done in hour and half. It was blazingly hot at this time of the year, 32°C."
217,Wooden Horse ,"We really enjoyed visiting Troy.  It's not all that far from Canakkale, and can easily be seen in a long morning (including the round-trip drive).  We had a local tour guide, who did a good job weaving the history of the site from a ""factual"" and archeological perspective, as well as weaving in the ""legend"" of what Troy has largely come to mean today.  My wife and I were both rather surprised at how small Troy is, and how much of it is still left to be excavated.  Troy's definitely interesting, but I think, if you were picking between Galipoli and Troy - given the remarkable amount of history both have (albeit in different eras) - I would recommend Galipoli.  It's bigger, more tangible, and there's probably a lot more to learn there - about WWI, about the end of the Ottoman empire and the start of the secular Turkish Republic, and about Naval history.... Regardless, both require a tour guide - I wouldn't recommend trying either on your own."
218,lots of history,"The Trojan horse from ""Troy"" (Brad Pitt movie) seemed more authentic.  Nevertheless still worth a visit."
219,Well Done Ruin,A visit to Troy City where we had the opportunity to witness the gigantic Wooden Horse of Troy. Back to history where the Trojan War took place. A highly recommended historical site for history lovers
220,Interesting archaeological site,My visit to Troy brought back so many memories about history at school. The tour leader was excellent in his presentation of the sequence of events leading to the Trojan horse / Helen of Troy. The walk around was very  interesting.
221,Had a small group tour,"if you ever will be in Çanakkale area, make visit at Troia archeological site. With an history of 5000 years!!! For sure you'll never regret that you've stepped on Hector's foot steps. It is unbelievable how good was preserved after 5000 years!!!"
222,History is buried,I didn't expect much. The guys in their costumes followed us and were a bit annoying to us. Finally they found some asian tourists to take pictures with them and their costumes ;-)The historic site is interesting and worth a visit. Sadly it started to rain when we were visiting. The good thing about rain: We had the whole site on our own then.
223,"Historical, fascinating","great place of trojan horse ,little bit long drive from istanbul but its near if from corlu .enjoy boat service in betwen"
224,Myth of the Trojan Horse,"The ruins of Troy are mystical and conjure images of ancient Greeks and civilizations of thousands of years ago.  Having read the Iliad and the Odyssey, standing on the site where it surely took place was wonderful.  Our guide was very good, the facilities are well laid out and easy to interprete.  The new museum promises to be a good addition, housing those artifacts not stolen by the Germans and then the Russians."
225,Serdar,"We have been lucky to visit this site during a low season when it was nearly empty. It is reasonably good display. The audio guide is simple but well explained and the signs are well documented. For information there is nothing else there than the archaeological site, no small old town around. If you travel independently a local Dolmus minibus will drive you there in 40 minutes from Canakale (under the bridge) for 5TKL (£1) per person. Same for the way back of course. Every hour or so but you need to look at the schedule on the bus door."
226,5000 years of History,"Went to visit the archeological site of Troy whilst staying in Çanakkale, took the local bus, 9tl each. Entry fee was 42tl (£6) Located on the eastern bank of the Aegean Sea, it is cradled in mythology and has been the stage for tragedies, wars and victories for many centuries.Alexandra the great, Roman emperors Hadrian and Augustus allegedly visited this ancient city of apparent blessed power.And of course the 10 year Trojan war.Now just ruins and the home of a replica Trojan horse (to scale which you can climb up inside), but worth a visit. You can read about each area from a plaque, or hire an audio guide at the entrance. There is also a free Troy Guidebook available from the Tourist office in Çanakkale which we read before visiting."
227,"History, history, History","Prior to arriving in Turkey, visiting Troy was supposed to be one of the many highlights of the trip.  Being at Ancient Troy was exciting, as I love ancient history.  However, there is only a small percentage of Ancient Troy that has been excavated.  There wasn’t a lot of structures in tact to get great photo opportunities.  The main photo opportunity seemed to be the poorly designed and constructed Trojan War Horse, which seemed to attract mobs of tour groups for several photos of the same angle.  If you are in Turkey, I would still recommend visiting Ancient Troy, however I thought the site could have been better presented."
228,Trojan Horse,"This was a great trip, with only four of us on the bus.  Bit of a long road trip there and back in one day; I was the only one silly enough to do it.  The other three people stayed in Canakkale, one we dropped off on the way and he went and did a half day Gallipoli tour and the other two we dropped off after the Troy tour.  Faruk was our tour guide and he was great - was giving him a hard time, he was not too sure about the Kiwi humour though.Well worth the long bus ride and loved the 'history', even if the Trogon Horse was not real.  The Villages of Troy are so amazing how the nine of them are built on one another like that."
229,Troy with a Tour,"We travelled 6-long pain staking hours from Kusadasi to this site of Troy!! Just to learn that the story about the trojan horse as known by many was only a myth!! It didnt exist at all and a monument of a wooden horse was erected on the site to keep the myth alive. This is the wooden horse of Truva. The other wooden horse you will see in Canakkale city proper is the wooden horse used in the Holywood movie Troy starred by Brad Pit and was donated to the city in 2004. The entire huge area was escavated showing remants of what was once a strong city of troy. You will be toured around the area under the scorching heat of the sun. Yes, its so hot in the summer that you have to apply sun block or better yet bring a UV protective umbrella with you. It all about history history history and more history. Iam lost in all the dates and events that were mentioned to us by our tour guide. For me personally, its not worth the visit. Honestly --- its not worth it. But if you want to see the trojan horse and for photo shoots then take the long 6-hour land journey to Troy."
230,A must to visit,Recommend a visit with a guide to explain the ruins. Should take about 1.5 to 2 hours approximately.
231,Fantastic experience,"Troy is such an iconic place in the mind of classical enthusiasts. Homer's story of love, treachery, revenge and bloodlust resonates in the mind but the landscape tells a different story. It's a story of everyday people living normal lives. The site is unique in that it offers 9 different layers of history showing how people lived over a large period of time. Troy is also a clear case of old school plundering in the name of archaeology when you see how much of a mess the German archaeologist schleimann made. He ripped apart the site and carried away the treasures to adorn his wife. Many western cities have pieces stolen from here in their historical museums.There is a large interpretation of the Trojan horse at the entrance to the site. An opportunity to climb this should not be missed although care is needed as it would be very easy to hurt yourself in doing so."
232,Fun for those who love history,"Well, It was good that I had a guide with me. If you don't you will just be disappointed because there really isn't anything there but rocks, considering that you have to travel 3 hours by road and a 30 minute boat ride, then another hour to get to the mythical place...  but still glad I came. The Trojan Horse was just build by the government. The Horse that was used in the film is close to the Cannakale port."
233,Not worth the visit,I did not know what to expect. But what an extra special treat it was. Would recommend it to anyone.
234,GREAT PIECE OF HISTORY,I am still gloating over the lmpact of my visit to Troy yesterday. The presence of the wooden horse at the entrance is surrounded by mystery. The legend has it that the Greek soldiers came hidden in it during the Trojan war though its authenticity is yet to be established. The ruins of the city are well preserved and a wooden pathway makes the place easily accessible.There is a great sense of well being as we walk around.
235,Should visit for the historical ruins,"This is the best place I ever been in the world,gives me goosebumps every corner.if you are thinking visiting this place (please) book official turist guide. Reason I'm saying there is a lots people doing this job for income and tell you different story's give your self plenty time to visit every corner."
236,History personified,Our second tour with crowded house. An informative and well organised tour. I have been to Troy before with another tour group  which was no where near as good as this one. Highly recommend Crowded House as a tour operator. The site has been renovated and there is a new purpose built museum. The guide was informative with good knowledge
237,Worst World Heritage Site,"Long thought a figment of Homer’s imagination it was discovered in the 1870’s by a wealthy German businessman. Nine successive civilizations built one upon the other dating back 5,000 years have been uncovered.  The current site is laced with wooden walkways and gravel pathways through the ongoing restorations and excavations. Often destroyed by fire and at least once by earthquake today the city appears to be little more than the ruins of foundations. But toured by a knowledgeable and experienced guide the city and its multiple incarnations come to life and is well worth the visit."
238,"Exciting, my dream come true as an ancient history nerd","A lot of history crammed into a relatively small area. The weather was inclement which spoiled things, but on a good day one could spend considerable time looking around the ruined walls and city - fascinating."
239,it was nice to see,"This place is incredible History going back 3000BC, Julius Caesar went there, Alexander built a temple, Achilles killed Hector according to HomerExcellent place"
240,Ancient city with a good story,"This is supposedly the place of battle between the Greeks and the Trojans.  Little actually remains of the various layers of a continually inhabited spot.The area was previously dug up by amateur archeologists who effectively destroyed the various layers of inhabitation.  The water system in the area has silted up.  As a result, there is little ""feel"" of what the battle would have been like.A guide is a must for this site."
241,Historical Place,"Lovely Drive , Lovely People good city. Worthwhile city to once in a life time, ancient site and good journey"
242,Exciting ,"We have been on the bus from Kudasasi for 6 Hours. Reach Canakkale and the weather was nice and sunny. Something our group was enjoyed walking and stretching along the bay after the long journey. There is a line at one of the highly recommended ice cream store, which only cost us 5TL, surprised it is so cheap. And along the bay, we had our taste buds on some muscles stuff with rice, a local delicacies not to be miss."
243,History lesson,"With a very large site and only a tiny fraction of the archeology now complete, overall the ruins are frankly not that impressive right now.  But a good guide will show how there were 10 distinct cities built one on top of another here, and will describe some of the famous characters that lived here.  There is the obligatory replica of ""the Horse"" that you can climb in and get pics - if you have the patience to brave the crowd.  The site can get quite overrun with tour bus groups at prime times, so if you are traveling individually try to get there at other times to see more."
244,"The ruins are excellent , the horse is just kitschy",We visited Truva early morning as a pit stop on the way to Kusadasi. It was one of the highlights of our visit to Turkey. You don't need much more than a couple of hours and it is close enough to Canekkale. Lots of info about what we were looking at and amazing to see history close up.  The kids liked getting inside the wooden horse.  I liked the fresh orange available because it was super hot even at 10 in the morning.
245,Historic site to visit when around!,"There's 2 trojan horses in Canakkale. The original wooden trojan horse and the trojan horse used to filmed the movie ""Troy"".Was happy to realise the in depth history of Troy. The various fortresses built to protect the city from invaders coming from the Aegean Sea. Saw the ruins of the various city fortresses over different dynasties. And the most original re-constructed Trojan Horse.Good to watch the movie ""Troy"" before visiting to enjoy the site better. Admission fee applies."
246,Disappointing after Ephesus,"The ruins of the Ancient Greek city of Troy. The place is amazing. The ruins are fantastic and the Trojan horse ""replica"" stands tall at the entrance of the site. The only problem was the fact that, for the ticket, they only accept turkish lira cash. You can use you credit card though."
247,Smallish site but worth it,Troy was very busy when we were there and it was the end of the day. I would not like to be there when it was more crowded. We had a guide to explain every thing and I recommend you do the same. You can be in and out of there within the hour.
248,Interesting but a little bit uninspiring ,"Homer was a historian not a novelist. I was taught this was a fable as a kid. Now I can walk the dig and say NO it is not a story, it is a chronicle."
249,Can not believe that a city from this time exists!,"After visiting Ephesus, which we loved , we were really looking forward to visiting Troy.........what a disappointment, the only decent thing was the wooden horse. We walked around the site expecting renovated buildings and all we got were plaques above piles of stones saying this is what it would of looked like. Very disappointing. Don’t bother going visit Ephesus or Gallipoli, much more enlightening."
250,An idea of ancient Troy,"I wanted to write this review for some time. First, didn’t have time, and then waited for more helpful votes, since I didn’t want to have more reviews than votes (my own personal rule). And now, I have some reviews to spear and my choice is Troia (Latin) known as Troy (English) or Truva (Turkish). So, we chose the route to include Troy in our May 2014 exploration of West Turkey. It was done at the expense of other ancient sites we could see during this time. The reasons were obvious, we read the story of Trojan War from “Iliad” of Homer when young, and saw many adaptations of the book on a big screen.  The truth is our expectations were high, and that is probably why we were disappointed with Troia site. The uncovered reminders were small, and honestly speaking they took all the glory from the story we knew. The reminders of the ancient Troia were far from the sea, and suggest rather sad fact that the city was much-much-much smaller in size that it was in our thoughts. The tall standing walls from the movies were in fact very unimpressive on the ground. Additionally, the archeologists were trying to preserve all reminders from before and after the war, and the visitors could be easily bored with too detailed labeling of Troy I, II, II, IV, or V indicating different time periods. It makes me extremely sad to say, but after seeing other ancient sites in Western Turkey like Ephesus, Pergamon, or (new dig) Laodicea, the score for Troy has to be very low!On the positive side, the “modern” history of how the place was discovered was very interesting. The story of amateur archeologist, wealthy German businessman Heinrich Schliemann winning the race of Troy’s treasure is a good one. At the end, the main attraction is wooden replica of Trojan horse. It is designed for tourists, with some windows on both sides for a few people to pose for a picture at the same time. It works since there are always a tons people there. However, if you have time, visit a near town ~ Canakkale. You will find on the sea-front promenade a great replica of the Trojan horse used in the 2004 movie “Troy”, starting Brad Pitt as Hercules, and donated to the city after. See the Truva Heykeli (Trojan horse in Turkish) in Canakkale’s attraction."
251,AMAZING PART OF HISTORY,"The ruins of Troy were much bigger and impressive than I expected.  Of course, there was the big statue of the Trojan Horse that provided photo opportunities, but the real site was the walk around the city ruins.  The walk was relatively easy with no climbing or rough areas, yet provided views of different dwellings and structural remains that were intriguing. One sign describing original foundation stones provided a date of 2500 BC. This site was better than I expected and I would recommend it for an easy hour or two."
252,Interesting ruins,"As part of a two day package tour with Crowded House, our visit to the ancient ruins of Troy was certainly facinating and it is amazing to see civilisation this many thousands of years old.  It must be said our tour guides stories really made the tour fantastic"
253,Very good historic place,"If you are traveling to Canakkale, you absolutely must visit the site of ancient Troy! This site is rich in history and so interesting to see the excavations taking place.  I think you could allow about 2 or 3 hours to properly see the entire site."
254,Exciting ,"I've read the addictive novels of Troy by P Gemmell, and wanted to see whether the site fitted the wonderful mind pictures. However there are no standing structures visible and the most obvious feature was the piercing wind, as described by Homer. The most impressive structure/reconstruction is the ramp to the castle, followed by the entranceway which is set at a right angle to foil attacking battering rams. There are lots of stones in the ground marking rooms of dwellings, and a reconstructed wall made of mud blocks, sheltered from the rain by a canvas tent. The sun came out when we looked at the remains of an entrance tower from where Priam may have watched Achilles drag Hector behind his chariot. There was no beach at all, since the sea - Dardanelles - is just visble several miles away. There are 2 wooden horses for the visitors, one large clunky horse at the site entrance with a window in it for photos, and a rather smarter one on the sea front in Cannakale town, a gift from the Makers of the Troy film of Brad Pitt/Eric Bana fame. This site is or more interest to archeologists and historians of the Mediterranean trade routes. There are clues to the presence of no less than 9 levels of development of the site, most before the rich Troy of Priam and Helen, and apparently the riches that were removed by Schliemann are in a Museum elsewhere."
255,Enchanting and Historic Place,"Such a culture lesson, so educational that I returned a few weeks later to do it again. It can be hot and the ground is uneven so be prepared with water, hat and good shoes."
256,Small and Mighty,"Excavations commenced in Troy in 1872 and there had been 9 different cities built on the present site of Troy, one on top of the other, commencing in 3000BC.  The largest city of Troy had a population of 800,000.  It was a very interesting site to be shown around and our tour guide was most knowledgeable.  However, the ground can be quite uneven in parts.  The Trojan Horse was built in the 1960's and it can be climbed internally for photographs!  A very interesting site to visit."
257,Disappointing,"We were on a cruise that had a stop at Cakakkale, Turkey and a tour to Troy was one of our options.  This is a wonderfully designed display of the city of Troy upon city of Troy again and again as the city was destroyed by enemies and by nature's fury.  Easy walking with frequent benches."
258,Beautiful ancient city,Went here a couple of years ago. Our guide was a gentleman of great knowledge who had written a book about the site. It was interesting looking at all the different layers that had been uncovered. Great view out to the sea which afforded a good advantage for those who wanted to protect their lands. Glad we went.
259,IN THE SHADOWS OF HECTOR AND ACHILLES,"What remains is not as spectacular as Ephesus. But Troy is in some ways more interesting.  There is still a lot left and the history dating back to 2,000 BC is just fascinating."
260,Day Trip from Istanbul,"This area is located in Canakkale, where the independence war against foreign military forces took place. British, French, Italian, Greek and other military forces jointly lost the war of Dardanelles to the Ottoman Empire. It is a site of sorrow a huge cemetery for all soldiers who fought the war on both sides. A story for all human kind to settle disputes without killing each other. Everybody should visit and learn the devastating ting results of war....."
261,But is it?,"I was awestruck through the whole tour, having grown up on stories of Troy and ancient Greek myths, and continuing my interest and reading to the present.  I felt I recognized the place when I got there, doubtless because of having read so much. I sensed I could see Homer's heroes and gods right on site. So much Western history started here."
262,Better than we had imagined.,We met a fellow traveler on a flight and he recommended this restaurant for dinner. My wife lived in Turkey for a while and has had trouble finding food that is authentic and reminded her of Turkey. This was the place! The food was fantastic the staff was really friendly and nice.  They had good music and a belly dancer every 20 or 30 minutes. Really enjoyed our dinner and would highly recommend this place to anyone else!
263,Amazing,"What an informative day we spent at Troy.  I knew very little about the battle until our guided tour, our guide was so passionate, he left nothing out.  Well worth a visit."
264,What an archeological gem!,"Do not make a visit to Troy with lofty expectations based on the legends of Homer or on Hollywood fabrications. Otherwise you will be sorely disappointed. Our tour guide explained that the man responsible for funding and supervising the excavation work here was only interested in recovering Trojan treasures. Therefore the excavation work was performed very poorly and many of the artifacts were damaged. As a result, much of the restoration was not possible, and much of the current site is not so impressive, certainly not to the extent of the wonderful restoration work we enjoyed at Ephesus and Pergamon.Nevertheless, I suppose a visit to Troy will be on the bucket list of many (myself included!), so a trip here may be worthwhile to you if you are in the area. It probably will require a little more than one hour to see everything.  There are a few sections that have been restored nicely: a small theatre; some of the city walls; and the pits where animal sacrifices were performed."
265,Fake horse,"Troy is an ancient city located approximately 30KM south of Canakkale.This archaeological site is popular with many travellers and tourists which is why our tour stopped here for visit.We had a great tour director was very knowledgeable in explaining the facts from legends, from an archaeological perspective, as well as the legend of the Trojan horse, Homer and the Iliad.Audio headsets are available, although I would definitely recommend a good tour guide to appreciate the full story.Don’t forget to climb up the ladder of the re-constructed Trojan horse near the entrance."
266,Another great  archaeological site,Troy was a fascinating archeological site with thousands of years of dynasties building one on top of the other. The audio was worth hiring but they ask for a passport. This was quite distressful.
267,Homers Troy,We visited as part of a Scenic Tours excursion in April last year. Our experienced guide was outstanding in his passion and knowledge .The Trojan horse is nothing great and only of significance to tourists who don't have the benefit of a guided tour of the surrounding historical sites
268,Average,"This is my second trip to Troy--the first in the mid-80's.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the good development since my first visit.  You now can rent audio guides and the ruins are well-marked.  The comfort station, book store, and cafe are very convenient and good.  I highly recommend a book to accompany your visit--""The Ancient City of Troy"" by Yuksel Ergen (local resident and owner of the Iris Hotel)--which will make this interesting ruins even more understandable."
269,Interesting Archeological Site,"Situated on the boardwalk at Canakkale, at the end of the rows of café’s, the replica of the Trojan horse is fairly big (20 feet high) and well done.  The imitation wood cement like material is convincing.  A plaque in several languages describes the rescue of Helen.This might kids interested for a few minutes but there is no interactive media with it.Have a look, enjoy its grandeur and the view on the bay and go have a drink on the many café’s and restaurants nearby.  If you schedule more than 10 minutes of looking at it, you are a history buff."
270,History fun,"There's a huge wooden horse at the entrance to Troy, one of the oldest, continually occupied cities in human history. The city of Troy was protected by a high wall built around the city. During the 13th century BC, the Greeks were at war with the city of Troy. This war was called the Trojan War. There is an old saying about Beware of Greeks bearing gifts!! This saying comes from the legend of the Trojan Horse."
271,Illead,"There are very few recognisable structures to Troy, aside from the Roman amphitheatre and the ongoing excavation of the communal bath. The rest is evidence of at least 6 different cities built on the site, which is elevated, and commands a great view across the plain to the straits. Easy to imagine seafaring ancient people inhabiting the space. The walkways are beautifully made, and the vegetation carefully controlled. Altogether a marvellous place to visit"
272,Fascinating,Very impressing tour.Nicely organised.I have enjoyed very much my second visit as well.Looking forward new findings of going on excavations
273,Quick trip from Canakkale to Troy,"Don’t bother, we had just visited Ephesus which was fantastic, and were looking forward to visiting Troy. Well what can I say, if it wasn’t for the replica wooden horse which is good the rest of the place is a walk around a wooden boardwalk overlooking piles of stones, with signs showing what the stone used to be, most of this site is overgrown, which is very sad. Sorry we were extremely disappointed ☹️ and wouldn’t recommend this excursion to anyone."
274,Trojan horse,"Listed as one of the UNESCO heritage sites in Turkey, this place should not be missed if you are into Greek history. Not much large structures to be seen here compared to other historical sites (e.g. Ephesus) but an hour or two should be sufficient."
275,More than you expect,"Until very recently, the Troy of the Trojan War was considered a myth.  However, I've touched the walls of the city where Priam watched as Achilles dragged the body of his son, Hector, before the gates.  This is an archeologial site that is far from complete.  There are 9 cities here, each built on top of the other.  Over the centuries, earthquakes, wars, etc. have taken their toll.  I hope the Turkish government realizes what they have here and work to make sure the site is developed more fully.  And, I hope that at least some of the treasure stolen from these grounds is returned to the museum in Cannakkale."
276,Layers upon layers of history,When i visited Truva the dreams come true. When i was child i read fir Elada Ahileas Hector and dream about
277,The Wooden Horse,"I have always had a deep love for Homer and the Bronze Age of Greece. Especially the Iliad and the Odysseys. As a former soldier, his description of Warriors is just timeless & spot on.But let us move on. If you are expecting some huge ruins or something like the Forum of Rome. You are going to be very disappointed. It is really a very small site for the foundation site  of Western Literature. None the less. It is a place for letting ones imagination to run wild. As you can see Priam's Gates, Schliemann Trench etc etc. So it is very hard to separate fact from fiction. The place is just that magical.Also if one looks out on the bay. You can see on a clear day. The peninsula of Gallipoli. Where the British Empire was stopped and Churchill's career was almost ruined by Ataturk and his hard fighting Turkish Infantry. You can also see the ANZAC / British War Memorial on a good day/Now for hints. Make sure to bring Sun Screen and do not be afraid to use it. Lip Balm is another good idea.  As it is always very windy here. Just like Homer said it was. Also a good pair of walking shoes is a good idea. There was also a nice park office with some nice displays and of course a replica of a wooden horse.But if you have read this so far. 1st Thank you and next. It is a really great place to take those who have a slow steady burning love of History.By the by if you want to learn more you might want to see the film ""In Search of the Trojan War"". It is 1st rate and will just overwhelm you about this Hill on the Western Coast of Turkey."
278,great Troy horse,Best time for your visit is spring or autumn. Please read Iliad/ Homeros before visiting..If you have time visit Assos ( behramkale village) also.
279,Awesome if you watched the movie,"I grew up hearing about ""Helen of Troy"" and even watched a movie about it when I was a child. So, of course, I was excited to see the Trojan Horse at the entrance.Our tour guide told us the mythology of how Helen, wife of King Menelaus. who was the most beautiful woman in the world, was abducted by Paris, Prince of Troy, and this brought about the Trojan War.Our tour guide told us the story of how first excavations at the Archaeological Site of Troy were undertaken by the famous archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann..This is a great place to visit if you like historical sites."
280,Very nice display of the historical levels of the cities of Troy,"The best and, I'd venture to say, only way to see Troy would be with a guide. Whether you want the story of Achilles fighting Hector, details of Paris and Helen's romance or facts on the nearly 4,000 year's old settlement it's the way to go. The souvenir shop is mighty pricey."
281,Do not come here with high expectations,"We enjoyed a personalised tour of the ruins of ancient Troy, where we learnt about the discovery and excavation of the city. An interesting fact revealed by our guide was that poppies, which grow abundantly there, symbolise both sleep and death. Sleep because of the opiate effect, and death because of their significance on the battlefields."
282,Worth an hour or two,"I visited Troy with my wife and in-laws. As I visited in early April I beat the crowd of tourists which will eventually embark on this place mid May. As we had previously purchased Museum Cards from Istanbul for 50₺ we were granted free entry. Otherwise it's 25₺ per person. Side note* if you can, purchase those Museum Cards, they are accepted at over 300 locations across Turkey and pay themselves off ten times over. Within the complex you have a photo area were your photo is taken whilst wearing Trojan/Roman type armour/clothing. 20₺ per photo. Completely optional.You have the usual tourist gift shop with a cafe. At the centre of the area stands the man made Trojan Horse, which is a replica of the original. Climbing the horse and taking photos inside/outside are free. A path leads away from the horse and into the ruins of Troy, literal ruins, plenty of scattered rocks and rubble. With very little of Troy actually standing. The only part worth seeing is the ramp to the citadel, citadel walls and the Ampitheatre. There is a well formed pathway which snakes its way through the ancient site with information on the various areas, can take up to an hour.Overall, I was happy I saw the area for what it's worth but will probably not visit again."
283,Still so much more to find ,"The history of this area is very interesting, with layers of buildings by defferent civilisations that the diggings have exposed. Takes around 2 hours to see it all."
284,very interesting place for history lovers,"Some 5Km from Çanakkale is the most important ancient site in the province is Troia, Troy. At the entrance stands a huge symbolic wooden horse, built to scale, using images from pottery and coins unearthed during excavations, it stands19m, 62.4ft, tall and weighs 11,000Kgs, 11 tons. The Trojan War broke out with the Achaens, circa 1200BC and it is in the famous ""Iliad"" by Homer, that the epic story is chronicled and immortalised. King Menelaus of Sparta, tired of seemingly futile and never ending wars, sought peace with King Priam.King Priam of Troy sent his two sons,  the Princes Hector and Paris, to broker a Peace Treaty, which was duly signed.During their stay in Menelaus's palace Paris fell in love with the Kings wife, Helen and she eloped with him from Sparta, aboard a Trojan ship, to Troy. Believing that she had been abducted, Menelaus asked his brother Agamenmon, King of Mycenae, for his support in his quest of rescuing his wife.He knew that without the mighty Greek army at his side, the walls of the Trojan city would be impenetrable.Agamemnon's army had slow defeated the Kings of the Greek States, but the fragile alliances were threatened by the very existance of the Kingdom of Troy, which was the most powerful rival to the emerging Greek nation. The conquering of Troy would give Agamenmon not only control of the important trade route upon which it stood, but it would unite the Greek States and, more crucially, give him total control of the Aegean Sea.The largest fleet the known world had ever seen, some 1000 ships, carrying the huge Achaen army, led by Agamemnon, sailed for Troy.Aboard his own ship, the greatest warrior ever to live, Achilles, son of Peleus, led the Myrmidons.Although few in number, they were the fiercest and most feared Greek fighting force,To avoid a prolonged siege, and the enevitable massacre of thousands of soldiers, Paris challenged Menelaus to single combat.  If Paris was victorious, Helen would remain with him and Achaen troops would withdraw from Trojan lands. However if he was killed, Troy would be ceeded to Agamemnom and Helen would return to Sparta.Paris, who was not a skilled soldier, failed in his quest, but was not killed.Refusing to accept his brothers defeat, and that of Troy, Hector killed Menelaus.   Agamenmon, in his supposed grief for his brother, placed the heavily fortified city under siege for ten years, but Achilles withdrew his troops after an argument with him. Patroclus was allowed to lead the Myrmidons into battle, wearing the armour, helmet, greaves, and carrying the shield of Achillies. .In the fighting that followed, outside the city walls, Petroclus was slain by Hector, who mistook him for Achilles.Seeking revenge, Achilles challenged Hector to single combat and, at the gates of the city, slew him.He lashed Hectors body to the rear of his chariot and dragged it around the city walls three times. The Achaens then took up a different strategy. According to Virgil, Odysseus, or Ulysses, the mythical King of Ithaca, suggested the construction of a huge wooden horseThey gave up fighting and pretended to be retreating home, leaving the gigantic wooden horse as a gift.The Trojans, thinking it was a votive offering to the God Poseidon, accepted it and took it inside the city walls. They were not aware that inside were a number of soldiers who, when the inhabitants were asleep, would slip out of the horse and open the gates, thus allowing other warriors to enter and capture the city.During the sacking of the city Priam was slain by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.Achilles was shot by Paris at the Scaean Gate.Using just a bow, Paris's arrow pierced Achilles's heel1.At the taking of city, Paris was killed, with a poisoned arrow, by Philoctetes.Ajax the Greater, the son of Telamon, King of Salamis, was a man of great stature and daring, but sadly slow witted.It was said that he could fell an oak tree with a single blow of his axe, but then trees don't fight back. When Odysseus, Ulysses, was proclaimed champion and awarded Achilles's armour, Ajax killed himself at what he considered a slight.According to ""The Odyssey"": After the fall of Troy, Ulysses wandered through the countryside for ten years. When he returned to Ithaca, his dog, Argus, so overjoyed at seeing his master again, promptly died of a heart attack.A second Greek legend says that Hecuba, the wife of King Priam, had a dream that her unborn would be a firebrand.The seers took this as a sign that the child would be the downfall of the House of Priam and of TroyWhen the child was born she abandoned him on Mount Ida.The boy was found by a shepherd, who raised him as his own.The child grew to be the most handsome of all men. Eris, The Evil Goddess of Discord, was not invited to the wedding feast of King Peleus of the Myrmidons and the sea nymph Thetis. She threw a golden apple which was marked ""For the Fairest"" on to the dining table. All the Goddesses wanted the apple but eventually the choice fell between Athena, Aphrodite and Hera. Zeus refused to award the apple and instructed them to go to Mount Ida, close to Troy and let Paris choose who should have the apple. The three Goddesses tried to bribe him, which made his choice all the more difficult. Hera promised him power, Aphrodite promised him the most beautiful woman and Athena promised him martial glory. The judgement of Paris was that Aphrodite should have the apple. The wrath of Hera and Athena is said to be the beginning of the event that led to the downfall of Troy. In return for the apple, Aphrodite aided Paris in his ""capture"" of Helen, after he deserted of his wife, Oenone, daughter of the River God, Cebren.Known in mythology as ""The Judgement of Paris"", or the ""Judgement On The Apple Of Dıscord"", it is said this was the real reason for the Trojan War.Whatever the legends, archaeological excavations have shown that there has been a settlement on the site since the Bronze Age, when it was a powerful kingdom. This is indicated by the strength of parts of the walls that remain. It has been suggested that there have been at least nine different settlements from different periods, with over 46 sub-levels. The first settlement, 3,000-2,400BC, was little more than a walled village, which consisted of clay-brick houses with wooden roof's. 1Achilles, the son of Peleus, was taken by his Mother, Thetis, to the banks of the River Styx. Holding him by his heel, she dipped him in the waters to make him invunerable, but the heel remained dry. Achilles was killed when an arrow pierced his one weak spot, hence the phrase ""Achilles' Heel"" refers to the small, but most potentially damaging weakness.The second settlement, 2,400-2,200 BC was a prosperous trading post with its buildings laid out on terraces. In the excavation of these layers examples of Mesopotamian metalwork have been uncovered. The discovery of pottery, made using a potter's wheel indicate the introduction of technology. These items and several structures are used as archaeological reference works.From that period there was a succession of villages until the area was populated by Mycenaen settlers in 1,800 BC.The city was surrounded by a 10m high sloping wall, parts of which can be seen today and it is refered to as Troy VI.Although it is sometimes refered to as the city of Priam, the general concencus amongst archaeologist's is that it was Troy VII that was the city that was besieged by the Greeks during the ten year Trojan War.After the Achaean army destroyed the city and it became nothing more than a large market town.But thanks to Homer and his ""Iliad"", the city attracted numerous people of distinction such as Xerxes, Alexander the Great, Julius Cæsar and the Emperor Constantine.Alexander the Great visited Troy IX on his journey towards Persia in 334BC.He bestowed special privilages upon the city and vowed to build a temple to Athena.Lysimachus was to honour Alexanders promise some time after Alexanders death in 323 BC.Under Roman rule the city  was known as Ilium Novum and continued to prosper and under the patronage of Augustus the city was completely re-built.The Temple of Athena, sewerage drains, an Odeon, which was a covered theatre of sorts, and megaron type houses which consisted of a portico and a large room, can be seen.Emperor Constantine considered Troy for his ""new"" Roman capital but decided on Byzantium, because of its strategic position, instead.The city fell into decline because of the silting up of its harbour and the advancement of the coastline, finally being abandoned by the Ottomans.Although many people visited, more so out of curiosity, the city eventually diassapeared from sight.One of the first persons to excavate the site was The American Consul to the Dardanelles in 1870, Frank Calvert, who had owned a farm, close to Troy, for a number of years. The farm was run by a rather dominating and foreboding lady and it was known as Kokona Ciflik, 'The Christian Lady's Farm'. The German ""archaeologist"", Heinrich Schliemann in 1871 struck up a friendship with the Englishman but, although they later argued, they both continued to excavate the site.Schliemann had made his fortune as a gold prospector in California. He had no scientific approach and his frantic digging did irreparable damage to the upper and earlier settlement layers. Schliemann gained infamy from the academic world, but not for his archaeological work, but as an avaricious, uneducated, amateur who had destroyed more evidence than he was to uncover. The scorn, ridicule and derision remain to today.After two years he eventually spotted something glimmering in a trench wall. Despite his assurance to the Türkiye's government that any treasure discovered would be handed to them, he had them smuggled to Athens. He assumed that this was King Priams treasure, but after further excavations it was proved that they were in fact from 1,000 years earlier. Schliemann actually discovered nineteen hoards of treasures over a number of years, which comprised of more than ten thousand objects of semi-precious stone and metals. These important collections of jewellery, anthropomorphic figurines, weapons and metal vases date from the middle to late millennium BC. The enormous amount of gold objects are an indication of the vast wealth of Troy and suggests that the city had been an important gold working centre since the Early Bronze Age. He unearthed basket and crescent shaped earrings, neck rings, hair ornaments, thousands of gold, silver and bronze beads and bracelets of gold wire. The plate metal consisted of silver flasks, gold and silver cups, a gold sauce boat and numerous vases. The two most famous pieces of jewellery discovered are the diadems worn by Sophia Schliemann.They are made of numerous fine chains with idol shaped, schematic pendants of sheet gold. The diadems were originally mounted on either a leather or cloth headdress which framed the face.  His wife was to wear the jewels at society functions for almost two decades before he donated them to the people of Germany in 1881. With the outbreak of war in 1939 they were packed and stored away but in the last days of World War Two they were spirited away to Russia by the invading forces after they entered Berlin. They disappeared for nearly fifty years, that was until the collapse of the Soviet regime, where they were discovered in the vaults of the Pushkin Museum, Moscow, in 1993. Today there is an on-going dispute between Moscow, Berlin and Ankara as to the ownership, with Türkiye claiming that neither country has a legitimate claim and demands the return of the treasures, as they were stolen in the first place. Although the jewels were taken to Moscow, the Russians left a collection of gold clasps and a variety of metal and clay containers and objects that are now housed in Berlin's Neuse Museum. In his excavations of 1890 Schliemann uncovered a large set of weapons. Four ceremonial axes, one made from Lazurite, and three from green stone, had been ritually broken after use and placed amongst the other weaponry as a symbolic gesture. As visitors approach the site today, they are greeted with the huge wooden replica of the famous wooden horse, which has been built to scale, after consulting images on pottery and coins unearthed on the siteFrom the visitors center a path loops around the site.There are terracotta pipes which supplied the Roman city with water from the slopes of Mount Ida.Passing through the East Gate, which was built between two parallel walls for defensive purposes, one climbs a flight of steps.The remains of the Hellenistic-Roman Temple of Athena are scattered around.The huge north-south trench that Schliemann dug undercut the great monument and most of it was destroyed.Because of his avarice he instructed his workers to discard and items that they discovered which related to the later city. Thus valuable information has been lost for eternity.The highest terrace was an area which was to become the forecourt of the temple. On the polished marble paving stones Xerxes, Alexander and sucessive Roman Emperors made their devotions.Further along the path are more pieces of masonry from the temple. A part of a ceiling plate is decorated with a flower motif with a small carved symbol, which is the artists signature.On the right of the temple are the foundations of the houses of the first settlement. From a wooden platform the vertical layers from the Roman city are visible.It was here, just inside the walls to the left of a ramp, that Schliemann discovered ""Priam's Treasure"".Passing the foundations of Priams palace and the southern walls of Troy VI one reaches a Hellanistic sanctuary with two wells, one of which the blood of sacrifices was channelled too.Further along there are fragments of the Roman city and the Odeon which was built, unusually, against the city walls for support.Close by sewage channels, covered with paving stones, can be seenThe South Gate is considered to be the Scaean Gate of Homer's Iliad.Like the City of Ephesus. the excavations of Troy are on-going, today.Daily 08:00-19:00 Tel Nos: 02862830536."
285,amazing,"Troy is an enchanting and historic place, embracing the cultural treasures of the east and the west, brought to life by the ancient epics.With over 5,000 years of history, Troy is  a fertle source of inspiration for poets, weaves together themes of power, victory and love, attracted people for hundreds of years and the many civilizations acquainted with Troy have been enriched by the descriptions of the legendary Trojan heroes and their exploits.  Troy is a priceless part of the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage ListThe ancient city of Troy is situated some 30 kms from Canakkale.."
286,Well worth a visit,Hello every one         How can i get there ????what agency could help me?? Or did you go alone ?????Thanks for the help
287,Fine Archaeological site,"Omero, the classic writer of the ancient Mediterranean history. Troy the city of his epic tales.You will not find any more what he described in his poems but will be interesting the same getting there and understand the real history of this culture.You will understand that the construction technics using stones are older than we think and remember."
288,Nothing to do with the movie,"One must not travel from Gallipoli south along the Aegean seacoast (or vice versa) without stopping in Troy.We visited the ancient ruins of Troy (actually, several eras of ruins on one site) 25 years ago. We returned with our children and were amazed by the effort and research that has transpired since that first visit. In 1994 there was no real entrance, no reception area, no footpaths, and no explanation per se. We wandered about the mounds and ancient walls and artifacts without knowing what we were doing, or damaging. Now the sight clearly and thoughtfully outlines the nine eras of Troy's history over five millenia. The archeological work is ongoing, well-marked, and awe-inspiring. The museum, a short drive away, is an absolute must-see. It just opened a year ago and looks like an artifact itself. It explains the history and legend of Troy chronologically as one ascends each level. It has intriguing interactions for kids. Many of the excavated artifacts are preserved safely in the museum. We visited the museum first for a couple of hours, ate lunch, then went to the archeological site itself for a couple of hours. You really can't do one without the other. The day left both parents and kids with a terrific understanding and appreciation of Troy and the region.Kudos to Turkey for this fantastic, classy monument to history and legend.FYI, the wooden horse near the giftshop is not an artifact, but a fun tourist landmark reminding us of Homer's Iliad. After the deaths of many heroes, including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax, and the Trojans Hector and Paris, legend says that Troy was entered by the ploy of the Trojan Horse. When we visited, it seemed surprising that some visitors thought the kitchy wooden horse was a real artifact. But it's still fun for kids to climb into."
289,Gods and Heroes collide,"A massive array of fragmented boulders, rocks, and old building stone, which were once walls. There is  a fair amount of wall sections remaining. Definitely a site now being marketed for the tourist trade.Nonetheless, there is enough to see to warrant a visit and the ruins conjure an element of intrigue and fascination when visiting such a celebrated and ancient archaeological site, whose repeated civilizations, over centuries, influenced so much of the world.  A civilization that developed in Mesopotamia before 7000 BC  (Now Iraq) . Maybe it is the site of the Homeric ancient city of Troy (?). Still, it is pleasing to gaze on the area that originated the phrase “beware of Greeks bearing gifts” (The amphora that depicts the wooden horse and its deception are now in the Archaeological museum in Mykonos.) A Saddle, showing the Trojans bringing the horse into their city, is in Milan. Maybe it is a myth, there are many interpretations, nonetheless, a romantic tale, told by Homer and now immortalized (once again) by Hollywood. Perhaps the horse really was a siege weapon of equine appearance?  There is actually 9 to 10 Troy’s, are built on top of one another. There is a walkway around and over the ruins, great for wheelchairs. Troy was once on the coastline, hence its once strategic importance, it is now 7 km from the sea. To lure the tourists’ (and their cameras) there is a huge wooden horse at the entrance, which is alive with people climbing up and in.  The film prop of the wooden horse (fiberglass?), used in the film, which looks more realistic, now stands in the city of Canakkale, near the shore, an area vibrant with night life, and Turkish coffee. It was donated by the producer of the 2004 film on Troy. (Warner)History enthusiasts must allow time to visit the new and architectural pleasing modern museum of Troy, which displays well documented artifacts, and does show the immense worth that this civilization has had on the many following generations. Allow 2 to 3 hours at least."
290,It needs restoration,"Maybe it was the weather.  Maybe it was the poppies in bloom.  But our early morning trip to Troy was nothing short of magical, which surprised us because many tour books had not given it much space.  Clearly labeled and criss-crossed with boardwalks, the various excavation sites have a marvelous countryside for a backdrop.  We skipped the museum (and may regret it) but  I left with images of Hecuba and the women of Troy bemoaning its fall. Brad Pitt's horse is, after all, just a wooden horse.  This is a MUST if you are in Canakkale."
291,"Ancient Troy, near Çanakkale, Turkey","Troy is an open-air museum displaying the nine levels of the city of Troy. The ruins are well-preserved and excellently displayed. There are information tables and clear signs. The museum is in a beautiful location, 30 km from the town of Canakkale. Recommended."
292,Not Much to see..but,"I organised to head to Troy on a whim during a business trip to Canakkale, and organised the tour through Helles Point (in Canakkale), who set me up with Crowded House tours. My guide was Sukru, and he was sensational! Very knowledgeable about the site, about the archaeological theories of the site and location, and the Homer mythologies too. So much information, and such a great site too. The Troy ruins are relatively small and compact, but there are some areas that are spectacularly preserved. You get a really good feel for the ancient site and for all the past cities that were located here. Definitely worth a trip down. I've visited lots of ancient sites around the world in numerous continents, and I was quite impressed with what I saw at Troy. Definitely check it out, and get a good guide, preferably Sukru!"
293,Ruins,"The ancient city of Troj is located on the shores of Strait of Canakkale city (Dardanelles) City was destroyed by earthquakes, wars and fire but still there are ruins to see it. U cn visit the site 365 days of the year. Ticket is 25 TL: 6 Euro - 7-8 US dollars. There is a cozy cafeteria for drinks and museum shop inside. WC.clean and inside the site. A large car park is available at the entrance (need payment). Friendly staff."
294,Interesting. ,"First inhabited in the early Bronze Age (from 300 BC), it was revived as a Greek city and later a Roman one and today the overgrown ruins allow you a glimpse of how the ancient city may have looked. There is history everywhere you look. We didn't stay too long but it is well worth a quick look!"
295,"Stones, stones and stones","The archeologicial site surrounding the ancient city of Troy is still under development. Each year new layers of the city are excavated. Since the history of the city is spread into thousand of years, it is better to visit with a tour guide or at least to rent an audio guide from the reception. It does not only tell about the history of the city, but also the development of the many states and cultures in Anatolia and Europe that are connected to this history. It is really amazing for visitors of all ages. Please note that the site is wide and open to sun, wind and heat during the day so visitors should have appropriate footwear, clothing and facial protection and should at least have 2 hours to enjoy this experience."
296,The horse of Troy !,"A drive between two straits ( Bosphorus to Dardenelles) .The Archaeological site of TROY ( unesco world heritage site)on the mound of HISARLIK(NW Turkey).A warm sunny afternoon found us standing under the tree at the archaeological site, listening to the well known tales of HOMER’s Iliad and gazing with awe at 4000 yrs of history.Seeing....The distant twin hills where Achilles and Patroclus could be buried...The green plains outside the fortifications where Achilles may have fought the battle with Hector and dragged his corpse...The faraway Mt IDA and the receding river lines.9 layers of civilisation from the Bronze age ( 3000-2600BC) to the Byzantium. TROY 1 to TROY IX( AD 500) .An early morning start found us driving along the blue waters of Bosphorus and Sea of Marmara....through the Thracian countryside....the distant purple hills, the intense blue waters and the yellow green farmland. Pockets of small villages with white washed walls and sloping red tile roofs with the neighbourhood mosque with the single minaret.Lunch was at a quaint coastal town- Eceabat, on the Dardenelles. The ferry crossing providing amazing views from the deck...of the receding Eceabat coastline, the blue waters of the strait , the constant seagulls and the approaching coastline of Çanakkale. Finally the drive to Troy.A long day...close to midnight when we returned.The wonders of Ancient civilisation, the legend and the site, wrapped up with snapshots of the picturesque Anatolian and Thracian countryside."
297,Interesting historical site,"I visited the city of Troy, which was the setting of the Trojan War as depicted in the Iliad of Homer, the poet. One wooden horse, which is symbolic of this Great War, was on display near the entrance.Refer to the map which shows the site where the cities of Troy was rebuilt over different period since 3000 BC.It was interesting to see the ruins as you take a walk along the board walk, and hear the story from a local guide. For all those who love history and archaeological sites, this makes an interesting visit for a UNESCO Heritage Site. It would take 1 1/2 hour to enjoy the walk around the area."
298,An unexpected finding,"""All my life. I've lived by a code. Honour the Gods.Love your woman. Defend your country. Troy is mother to us all. Fight for her."" Eric Bana ( Hector ) is the man."
299,The only reason to go is to be able to say you went,"雖然這是Brad Pitt 主演電影"" Troy"" 內的木馬,但是實際看更有震懾的感覺。所以很值得來觀摩。它是位於加歷奇市。向著碼頭方向,沿岸走一小段路就能看到。Although this is the Trojan in Brad Pitt's starring movie ""Troy"", it actually feels more shocking.So it is worth watching.It is located in the city of Galic.In the direction of the pier, you can see it by a short walk along the coast."
