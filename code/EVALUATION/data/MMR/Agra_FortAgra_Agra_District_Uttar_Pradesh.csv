0,A must visit for a history buff,One must definitely visit to see one of the best preserved forts of the Mughal era. It gives a glimpse into the lifestyle and the life of rulers as well as give context to what we have read in the textbooks while growing up.
1,Great Built,This is a lovely building to visit and the history really does give you a greater insight in to the Taj Mahal visit and the reasoning behind the build.  Fascinating history of family.
2,Stunning,Impressive fort in its own right  overlooking the Taj Mahal - needs to be visited to see the architecture and work that went into building it - stunning!
3,Not to be missed,Historic fort to be visited on your visit to Agra.  Amazing views and beautiful architecture.  Another must see in Agra.
4,Had an amazing time - IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT VISITING,Visiting here completes the whole story of why the Taj Mahal was built. Views from the fort are wonderful across to the TM. The grounds are very pleasant and supported by the local monkeys!! Very cheap to get in.
5,Awesome,Beautiful red sandstone fort - terrific stonework and carvings. Take a guide who will tell you the stories associated with this fort and especially the imprisonment of Shah Jahan (the builder of the Taj Mahal) by his son in a tower overlooking the mausoleum for his wife. A terrific view of the Taj across the river.
6,Marvellous like always,"The Agra Fort is an interesting tourist attraction, and on a good day you get an amazing view of the Taj Mahal, but unfortunately there was a lot of pollution when we went so the Taj was barely visible. Unfortunately only a small percentage of the fort can be visited as the rest is occupied."
7,A Must Visit in Agra,"Spent the morning at the Agra Fort and was amazed at the history and beauty of the structure. The structure is well preserved, allowing you to walk around and explore.  It was interesting to explore the area where Shah Jahan was kept prisoner by his son.  Such a beautiful white marble area.Agra Fort¬†is a historical¬†fort¬†in the city of¬†Agra¬†in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the¬†Mughal Dynasty¬†until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to¬†Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. The fort is a walled city."
8,Agra tour,"worth a visit if you are in Agra - there is a rich history and you get to see the view of the Taj as did Shah Jehan from the room he was imprisoned in...interesting gate, and protected ramp walkway through the walled complex..."
9,stunning,"Agra Fort gives you a nice glimpse into life of Mughal Kings & their way of living. The Meena Bazar, Deewan-a-aam or Deewan-a-khas inside it, help you understand how the life was around 400 years ago. Take help of a guide available there, so that you can understand the history associated the fort. Must visit after the TAJ MAHAL :-)"
10,Worth a Visit,Agra Fort continues to be one of the best monuments reflecting the true glory of the Mughal empire. The Fort is under conservation and looks more beautiful now. The over all experience would be better if they sold a little Map of the area which guided the tourists from one room to the other. And provided Audio guide for the monument ! Parking is messy ! And toilets are inadequate !
11,Explore Agra: Agra Fort ‚Äì Khas Mahal,AGRA FORT is the one of the must visit for travellers or local people.  You could enjoy the luxury of the palace and could see Taj Mahal from here.I am so impressive with the Palace of the King of India( in the past).
12,Very interesting and culturally pleasing,This fort is very impressive and worth a visit. I have visited both Red Fort in Delhi and Agra Fort I would recommend Agra fort over Red Fort Delhi both inside and out are impressive and much better than Delhi Red Fort this can be seen from outside and the inside is not so good.
13,Fort and palace of the Mughals,"The planning and architecture of the fort is awesome. It is must visit spot, if you are visiting Agra."
14,Fabulous View of Taj Mahal on a Clear Day,Agra Fort well preserves and still well maintained. You can see Taj Mahal from some of the windows and that's the best part of Agra Fort. Full of hidden history and lots of spots for pictures. Agra Fort have a lovely garden but please avoid to visit in summer from 12 am to 4 pm to hot. You have to walk a lot in Agra Fort. I suggest you need suficent time to visit this fort. This is one of the best forts I ever visited.
15,the Red Fort is a must if you are in Agra,Although in the shadow of other forts and the Taj Mahal this fort is worth doing. There are excellent view points to see the Taj Mahal and some excellent sites in the fort.
16,So much to see here before you visit the Taj,A very well preserved UNESCO world heritage site in excellent condition. If you are visiting the Taj Mahal you should include a visit to Agra Fort.
17,The City of Joy.,Hopefully if you see the Taj Mahal you also have enough time to see Fort Agra also. They are both very historic and well worth making the effort to see.
18,Worth a visit,Its a must visit place. What this fort looks even today makes you only wonder as to how this fort would have looked in its full glory. It makes you marvel at the brilliant architect and engineering.
19,Nice fort,This is a must visit attraction if you visit Agra. Only 20% of the fort is open to the public. The army occupies the rest of the fort. The history is fascinating. The buildings are magnificent and the interior would be even more so if the gold inlays had not been removed by the British when they ruled India. A good guide is helpful.
20,Wonderful,Agra Fort has been well preserved and when you see how the fort was built you understand how they must of used many men and animal labour to built such a fort.
21,Stunning Building,"We found this fort very interesting. It is huge and had wonderful views of the taj mahal and surrounding area. There is information in English which you can read, i wasnt offered to hire a audio headset ,not sure if they had them. Wasnt to busy first thing in the morning so was able to walk around and take photos easily."
22,An impressive show of strength.,This is an absolutely beautiful Fort in Agra - plenty to see and would definitely highly recommend! 5 Stars
23,God bless those Mughals,"It was a great day to tour Agra Fort.  The fort was amazing, such great history and a beautiful building."
24,Another Architectural Marvel,"What makes a visit here important, is it's connection to the history and story of the Taj Mahal. The Taj can be seen from the balcony that Shah Jahan used himself, to view his wife's monument.Recommend having a guide, as they will give you the history of the fort and ensure you see all that there is to see. Even though this is a fort, there is some beautifully decorative carving and inlay to be seen. This site should definitely be included on a visit to Agra."
25,An interesting and impressive red fortress!,Amazing Architekture from the Mogul era. üòéüëçIts well W√∂rth a visit when in Agra üòÄ. Start early to avoid the crowd and the heath. We can strongly recommend this amazing piece of History.. dont miss it. üôèü§îüëç We love this place üòéüáÆüá≥
26,Afternoon visit,"Usually overshadowed by the Taj Mahal, it is easy to forget that Agra has one of the finest Mughal forts in India. Walking through courtyard after courtyard of this palatial red-sandstone and marble fortress, your amazement grows as the scale of what was built here begins to sink in.Constructed along the bank of the Yamuna River. The fort was built primarily as a military structure, but Shah Jahan transformed it into a palace, and later it became his gilded prison for eight years after his son Aurangzeb seized power in 1658.Really interesting place, a must see!!"
27,Good trip,Amazing marvel and amazing  building with great view of Taj Mahal.A must see for everyone. Well maintained with great effort by the staff to keep it near and clean
28,Amazing historic red fortress--UNESCO world heritage site,Simply stunning. Would recommend bringing a tour guide to truly understand the history of this monument.
29,Very interesting.,"A must see when in Agra. Really interesting to get a glimpse of how the people of India lived hundreds of years ago. Beautiful views of the Taj Mahal throughout the fort, albeit the Taj did not exist for much of the forts history.A very clever civilisation with great architecture and wonderful sense of aesthetic beauty."
30,Interesting place,"The Red Fortress of Agra is a must see historical masterpiece.Built on the other side of the river from the Taj Mahal,  Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum for his favourite wife, who also bore him 13 children, and died in childbirth, from his wing of the fortress,  he could look over the river to where his lost wife lay, and visited her everyday.The Red fortress itself is a beautiful site, on par or above many fortresses you‚Äôll see in India, with such a love story of a Shah who never recovered from the loss of his wife to make it a magical place.It‚Äôs a 1.30-2.00 place to visit, but use a guide to get the most of the historical value of the fortress, and the heartwarming love story of a heartbroken Shah, it‚Äôs a fabulous prelude before the Taj Mahal and it‚Äôs significance in the story."
31,"Nice plan, doesn't worth a visit without the Taj Mahal","The fort is epic and shows the history and beauty of Indian architecture on a scale and size that leaves one in awe. The fort is busy but well maintained. I can only imagine what it was like to be a mogul back in the 15th century. We had a fantastic guide that knew the history of the fort. It links well with the Jaipur, Agra and Delhi forts."
32,Beautiful Fort,This wonderful red-stone fort is really a huge castle with a history that goes back over the ages.  A guide is a must as the history and architecture is interesting and needs to be explained.  It is incredibly impressive.
33,Another Amazing Indian Structure,"The Taj is not the only unmissable sight in Agra which has an abundance of riches. The Fort is still in use by the military and only 25% is open to the public. It is a highly impressive sandstone monolith with some areas of pure beauty inside. Even the functional areas of the private audience hall and particularly the hall of public audience are magnificent. Fabulous viewsw, well kept gardens and spotlessly clean."
34,"Under Renovation, But Still Worth It.",Very interesting fort. Sadly half of it is inaccessible due to it being used by the military. Still worth a visit.
35,Extensive fort complex,We visited in the afternoon after a trip in the morning to see the Taj Mahal.  The fort is very well preserved and there are great views of the Taj Mahal.
36,A sense of ancient culture,"The Agra fort is an impressive representation of Mughal architecture showcasing beautiful marble inlay work.  It has massive ramparts and like most forts it is surrounded by a moat which is now dry.  One can view the Taj Mahal from the fort at a distance.  You can only see 25% of the fort as the rest is under the control of the Indian Army but 25% itself is quite a bit as it is a big fort.  It was the main residence of the Mughal emperors till they shifted their capital from Agra to Delhi.This is where Aurangzeb imprisoned his father Shah Jahan who died here.The fort also has royal baths made out of marble, a mosque, a mirror palace (Shish Mahal). There used to be a private market place for the ladies within the fort and a  grape garden as the kings were fond of wine.  An hour's time is enough to view this fort"
37,Beautiful Site,"This fort is well worth a visit, ideally with a guide who can help bring the history alive.  And it's a fascinating history.It's a large complex but only a relatively small percentage is open to the public.  There are some great photo ops.  The red sandstone is lovely."
38,Worth the time.,A real day to remember visiting this part of India. Stunning buildings in a great setting with great views.A must see...
39,The seat of power of the Mughals during the 17 th century,"Great views of the Taj Mahal from here but that aside, a really interesting place to visit.  I would say it's one of the most impressive Mughal forts in India.  You can amble from courtyard to courtyard and imagine yourself living in those times, transformed into another life.  A definitely must-see if you're in Agra."
40,Agra Fort üëç,"This is a delight!  The history alone is enough to blow your mind.  Built initially by the grandfather of Emperor Shah Jahan who built the Taj Mahal, renovated big time by the emperor who was later imprisoned for years in it by a 3rd son, in a room facing the Taj Mahal.  It is so exquisite with scalloped entrances and inlaid marble. Older sections are painted but easy to imagine in its glory.  One has to imagine how the river used to almost reach the fort but is now sadly much smaller."
41,The background story is better,"This place is so much more than a fort.  It was also a palace.  It is spectacular.  There are also some great views from there. It will take at least an hour and a half to see it, but it is really worth it.  For any of the forts in India, it is a good idea to have a good pair of hiking shoes.  Regular shoes can easily slip on the stones."
42,Formidable fort,"Large red Fort, lots of fab buildings, busy attraction. Worth visiting... Especially with a guide to provide you with the historic facts"
43,Amazing,"The Agra fort is a good example of how the mugal kings lived.It is fairly well preserved and was the place of residence of multiple mugal kings.Also famous for the balcony from where Shahjahan, the builder of the Taj Mahal would view his wife's mosleum when he was imprisoned by his own son Aurangzeb.Worth a visit."
44,Incredible!,"This is an enormous Mughal fort. Currently, only 20% is available to be toured, the rest is used by the Indian Army. The fort has a few different architectural styles and some really interesting stories. Make sure you have a guide. Most tourists visit the Taj Mahal in the morning and the Fort in the afternoon. If you visit the Fort in the morning, it is quite quiet and peaceful."
45,A warm up before the Taj,Listening to the tour guide about this place is fascinating. Makes for great movie piece. This place is fairly big and you need time to really enjoy what this place has to offer a visitor.
46,Group Visit as part of a tour of India's Golden Triangle,Take a guide as you will learn a lot more about the fort and history of the tai. The excursion with guide is about 75 minutes. A really good excursion.
47,Totally worth the visit,Beautiful place to visit to see where the royal family (of the king who built the Taj Mahal) lived. Was under construction but nonetheless still had beautiful sites even after 400+ years. Again lots of tourists come here so expect crowds every time and everyday.
48,Agra Fort,Agra fort .it's beautiful place to know about history of Mughals . tickets is very reasonable for Indians 50 rs only . 16 points in Agra fort to see .
49,Nice example of a old fort,Besides the Taj Mahal this is a MUST SEE in Agra.The sheer size and layout for a 400 yr old building makes today's architects look amateurish !!!!That it is a functioning building used by the army explains a lot about it's design.Please allow at least 2-3 hours to appreciate this fort.
50,Historic fort.,"After visiting the Taj Mahal, we went to Agra Fort, where the love story began. The site is quite large and will take you about an hour to tour. Either Google the history or hire a guide, there are several waiting at the front gate ready to offer their service. The one downfall is the crush of peddlers on the walk leading to the fort, they are very pushy & in your face. They also don't take no as your final answer. It would be nice if they banned peddling souvenirs right outside the entry as you literally have to fight your way through them. Otherwise, well worth the trip!"
51,Agra Fort,Very significant historical site with amazing fortifications and a wonderful set of royal palaces. There are actually two. The old one was remodeled by Shah Jagan before he built the magnificent white marble structures. Some were not open but sufficient were and the crowds sufficiently low key as to make the experience something really special.
52,If you see Taj Mahal try to see Fort Agra also,"The city of Agra is fortunate to have some of the most impressive structures in the world:  Taj Mahal, Itmad-ud-Daula Tomb and the Agra (Red) Fort.  The Agra (Red) Fort is essentially a walled city area that had once housed some of the emperors that had ruled the area - Agra was once the capital city before being moved to Delhi.  Within the walls of the Agra (Red) Fort, there are some magnificent structures inside:  Jahangiri Mahal, Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Audience), Khas Mahal, Anguri Bagh Courtyard and Musamman Burj.  Because this area within the walls of the Agra (Red) Fort is so large, we had spent almost an entire day just exploring this one area.From the windows or balconies of some of the structures noted above, there is an excellent view of the nearby Taj Mahal - stunning view!  It had been said that the location of some of the structures noted above was to take advantage of view of the Taj Mahal.The Agra (Red) Fort area is another must see place while visiting the city of Agra."
53,Magnificent Fortress,This is an architecturally beautiful structure - like a walled city. From the lovely gardens through the ramparts & gates you will see beautiful artistically designed walls and inlays and cutouts. This was a very enjoyable visit - we did have a guide who explained what we were seeing.
54,History in real life,The Agra Fort is UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the finest Mughal forts in India. Built in the 11th century an era marked by invasions and battles. This red stone-fortified castle was also the site of India's rebellion of 1857. It is set among ancient gardens. Another MUST see!
55,Amazing Fort,"Visited the Fort late afternoon as the sun was setting.  A truly spectacular Fort with stunning views of the magnificent Taj Mahal in the distance across the banks of the Yamuna.One cannot help but be awestruck by the immense size of these Forts and how they were constructed in a time past when the only resources were sheer numbers of labourers with little or no machinery in contrast to what we now expect for any major construction project.A sight to behold and absorb the historic vibes from every step as you walk through the labyrinth of stairs, courtyards, arches, enclaves, gardens ..."
56,Undergoing renovations,"We were taken here by a wonderful guide with Explore India Journeys, It is not to be missed with the stunning red clay structure and rich history"
57,1st red fort in india,"The fort is a large palace complex, on its territory you will be met not only by the spirits of history, but also completely living chipmunks. Do not forget to take a treat for them!"
58,Former residence of the Mughal Dynasty,Absolutely Amazing! Went in November so the weather was perfect. Can even see the Taj Mahal from the fort.
59,Wonderful architecture and history,"Great place to visit and when you consider that it wasn't just a monument but an active fort & palace all that time ago.  A wonderful external colour, large walls, 2 moats and then the intricate workmanship inside is all quite amazing.The water system used then is amazing & still isn't fully understood today - captured rainwater on tanks, rainwater gutters, water features, use in toilets and for drinking and watering gardens. Pretty clever.Inside the fort walls are various levels and buildings, each with its specific purpose and its level of ornateness seemed to be decided by its purpose and importance.I would certainly recommend it. It does require some walking, some uphill steps and ramps, but is worth the effort."
60,Incredible fort and plaace with lots of amazing artwork and design!,"If u see the monument as a building, you will get to know vastness and grandeur of mugal era. But if you are a imaginative kind of person, u will witness the portrait of entire mugal clan.It was home to all mugals but less imprints of two of them. Akbar who built his own fort at fatehpur sikri and aurangzeb who was radical in thoughts, hence disliked art in monuments.Every corner of Fort reverberates stories of barbarian mugals. Its walls whispers the stories of conspiracy, stories of killings of close relatives. Shahjahan, maker of tajmahal lived here. Huge harem for his lust and meena bazar to target girls. U see how use of red stones changed to white makrana marble in shahjahan period. You will realise it was not mumtaj but his love to makrana marble which was motivation to bulid tajmahal. Muthamman burj, where shahjahan was detained. In the last years of his life, he peeped on tajmahal merely from a window.Summer palace winter palace shahjahan palace diwane aam diwane khaas and many more."
61,Welcoming by a group of pigeons circling over the lagoon in front of Agra Fort  Makes me very happy,"Visited this place back in December after arriving from Delhi. This fort/palace was once the residence of the Mughal Emperors, especially during the period when Agra was the capital of the empire. From the outside, it definitely looks like a fortress, something that can be said for many Mughal era palaces such as the Red Fort in Delhi and Fatehpur Sikri Fort. This was the first stop of the day on my tour around the city. It‚Äôs a great structure even after seeing the equally impressive Red Fort. The monumental Delhi Gate, Shish Mahal, the Muthamman Burj and Jahangir's Palace are some of the best things to see in the building. At the entrance to the fort were lots of guides offering their services. I didn‚Äôt use any of them and found it unnecessary."
62,The Best fort of India!,"happy to visit agra fort,really good historical monoment,you can see Taj Mahal from here & river Yamuna.Must visit place."
63,A must visit in India,"This is a UNESCO heritage site built in red stone. If you have visited Fatehpur Sikri, you may skip to visit this place. The Mughal ruled from this fort for some time. Again this place has palace, rooms where Jahangir was kept under house arrest, a view of Taj Mahal. Most part of Agra fort is occupied by Indian army and is not accessible. If you decide to visit this place, no need to hire a tourist guide.I wish to caution about a tourist/ shopping trap near Agra fort. Either your guide or auto driver will take you to a shop which pretends to sell authentic Agra made goods. First they will show you mini Taj Mahal prototype in moon light, morning time, evening time. Then they will try to sell you goods which are made in Agra. The salesman are very aggressive in selling products. The shopkeeper tells that it is owned by Uttar Pradesh government. But everything is fake."
64,Impressive!,"Most people visit Agra for the Taj, but the Red Fort shouldn't be missed. The 16th century fort has some stunning architecture and beautiful ornaments and decorations. You can do Taj in the early morning, go back to your hotel for breakfast, and visit the fort after that. That'll leave you plenty of time to go back to Delhi or where ever you're going next."
65,Another 5 star attraction in Agra,I had the opportunity to see the Agra Fort as a part of my tour of the Golden Triangle.  I always wonder how a king or ruler could build such a stronghold to protect his kingdom or his country as well as his wife or wives.  Agra Fort is one of the must to see in India.  This is a heritage of the Indian people.
66,Majestic!,"We found this beautiful fort very interesting, we would recommend having a guide or reading up on the history beforehand."
67,Trip to Agra,"A very large fort in Agra. The fort is huge, but much of it is not open to the public. It is a great place and takes 2-3 hours to see it all. Very difficult to find everywhere without a guide, but we prefer to do things ourselves. Worth a visit, if very crowded with tourists."
68,Red Fort,"Really nice place and highly recommended. This is where the king who built the Taj Mahal lived, for part of the year. The taj cost so much money and he wanted to build a black taj across the water and his son locked him up here after taking his throne. He lived in prison for 8 years until he died. It was beautiful and amazing views."
69,woder of world,"Only 20 % of Agra Fort is available for Vistors.Perfect view of Taj Mahal, from the red fort. The guide is required to understand the history of the Fort , don't pick the first guide you meet at Red fort and do bargain for the best rate."
70,Another Wonder,Pretty good fort that cost 600Rs to enter. Really nice if you haven't visited any other forts in India. Otherwise nothing special.
71,Another gorgeous fort,This fort is quite beautiful and in amazing shape. The stonework is stunning. The fort is large and accommodated many uses. I recommend visiting the fort with a local guide.
72,Trip to Agra,"Amazing architecture, spectacular views (even of the Taj Mahal)Well worth a couple of hours, you could even take an elephant ride if you were that way inclined."
73,Portrait of Mugal History,"The Agra Fort is also known locally as the Red Fort.  It is one of a number of beautiful structures in Agra and this fortress was built to protect this once capital city.  It is a walled city area that housed the emperors that ruled the area and all their staff, the city admin staff and ladies.  As you enter the fortress you have to walk through the outer gates and up the entrance path surrounded by 20 meter high battlements from which enemies were attacked.  The circumference measures 2.5 kilometres  - you can imagine it must have seemed impenetrable.There are incredible structures on numerous levels inside the fort and it is easy to be distracted and so you should have a plan for the day and tell your guide how much time you want to spend here.  The buildings are grand, the scale large and the gardens well tended.  There are good views of the Taj from the windows and balconies.This fort is where the creator of the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan, spent the last years of his life after being imprisoned by his son.The Agra Fort area is another must see place when you are visiting Agra.  You must have a guide with you to make the most of this experience.  Our guide (PK) was outstanding."
74,Very interesting if guided,I have visited Agra.It was a wonderful Experience there Nice cityAmazing historical Places.. Specially Taj Mahal.
75,Every fort is different,"After the Taj Mahal, the Agra Red Fort is the second big attraction in this dusty city. My driver Sharma arranged a local guide for me, who also led me through the Taj. Also thanks to Israr Ahmad who knows many details that would not have been noticed, it was a worthy visit. The fort is also a palace of the Mogul emperors who have left many wonderful buildings in north India. The system is similar to buildings in Andalusia in Spain, palaces inside fortresses - think of Alhambra but in many other cities as well (Alcazares, it can not be a coincidence that all of these building were built under Muslim rule). This fort is very large and you can visit part of it since the Indian Army uses the other part. The accessible area is by far large enough to spent two hours here and get a deep impresssion of how the royals lived in the 17th century. Just look at the pictures. Once you are in Agra, make sure you do not confine yourself to seeing the Taj Mahal only!"
76,Don't skip the fort,A must go place if you are traveling to Agra... A guided tour is recommended for the fort because there are so many things to know and from the fort you can experience the view of Taj Mahal on the bank of River Yamuna.
77,Do Not Come To Agra Only To See The Taj Mahal,"Enter across the once crocodile-occupied moat into the fort/palace complex, which is spacious with lovely gardens. This is where Shah Jahan was imprisoned in his white marble octagonal tower, with a view to his wife's mausoleum (the Taj Mahal) around a bend in the river. Take time to explore and understand the history of the buildings in the complex."
78,One huge impressive fort come palace,"I was looking forward to visiting this fort after researching before my visit and finding myself totally immersed in the Mughal dynasty and the great Emperor Akbar.  As I booked this holiday directly with an agent in India and arranged our itinerary, he had arranged a guide for our whole stay in Agra.Azar our guide pushed us to the front of the queue and proceeded to inform us of this fabulous fort, only 25% is available for viewing as the government uses the rest but it was worth the visit.   Magnificent architecture and clever planning, this fort was never attacked as it had a fort/moat full of alligators.  Shahjahan was imprisoned here by his son and we could see the Taj Mahal across the river. Don't miss it !"
79,AGRA FORT is the great place to visit,"What an amazing building this is, absolutely steeped in history from being build by Akbar in the 1560‚Äôs and his grandson Shah Jahan‚Äôs  input later down the line and his eventual death there. It was exceedingly busy when we visited so we did rush a little more than I might have liked. I could have stayed all day easily, the history of it fascinates me"
80,Awesome structure,"The Taj Mahal invariably steals the spotlight in Agra but the city also has one of India's most significant Mughal forts, Agra Fort. The fort was among the first monuments in India to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Agra Fort is renowned for its magnificent architecture, incorporating Akbar's signature Islamic and Hindu styles. Many tourists understandably choose to see the Taj Mahal at sunrise and go to Agra Fort afterwards."
81,Wow!,The fort has its own history and link to the Taj and we found having a guide extremely valuable for this experience. The fort is an impressive structure and a formidable defensive position.Despite it still being a working military base and therefore restricting access to the whole fort you are able to walk through the palace area. You can easily spend up to a couple of hours here absorbing the history.
82,"One must visit this Fort, which was also a palace!!!",Another fantastic place to visit - so rich in history and craftsmanship. Our guide was great and we enjoyed out visit
83,Go with a guide!,one of the best forts of Mugal era. you marvel how this was built with red stones at that time. There is an entry ticket and q will be there on holidays. there is lot to walk. interested in history then have a guide. you can bargain.
84,A red massive fort with a soft white heart,Agra fort is great in architecture and it's history. There are many buildings. They are luxurious inside and certainly look glorious in historic time. We can see Taj mahal from here.
85,The Agra Fort,I really enjoyed learning the stories about the four generations of the family who built this fort. It's definitely worth getting a guide to help fill in the details.
86,Fabulous monument. A must visit,Amazing to see the high level of engineering employed in the development of this interesting fort.   Be prepared for a long tour beginning with walk up an incline.  Highly recommended tour!
87,"Very large, clean and well maintained ","The Agra Fort dates back to the 1500's and was the Capital of the Emperor Akbar. It's an imposing structure and well preserved to show the outer and inner areas.While the main attraction in Agra is certaily the Taj Mahal, the Fort is well worth a visit. Depending on your level of Interest you can wander the grounds on your own, or opt for one of the many guides offering their services for a more in-depth look."
88,Our third Fort visit,"Agra Fort was amazing. It contains an area of 9; acres. It is a walled city. From here we could see Taj Mahal. It is a historical fort in the city of Agra, India. It was the residence of emperors of the Mughal dynasty until 1683 when the capital moved from Agra to Delhi. Our amazing tour Nadeem explained to us the history of Agra fort in great detail. He was with us all the time, helping us to take lots of interesting photos. Unlike other tour guides, he never left us alone unattended. Nadeem, thank you for telling us all the interesting history and guided us to every interesting corner of the fort."
89,Nothing special,This us a large fort with lovely views and gardens .It must have been very busy in its time as it has many buildings especially for the ladies who had to keep out of sight.Our tour guide explained the very interesting history.
90,Wonderful fort,"Agra was the capital of the Mughal dynasty for years. There are many grand mansions, palaces and courtrooms in the fortification.I found this Diwan-E-Aam or the Court for the Commons, notable for its plainness and balance. The distant view of Taj from one of the galleries is also majestic. And the place incites the memory of the authoritative voice raised by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for a place in the file lower than a little dominion.We wanted to have a look at the guardhouse where Maharaj was in confinement. However, the chambers are now in custody of Military, and thus no access is available there to the visitors.One thought came to mind, the tourist's guides which were making a strong followup to accompany would have been helpful for that.However, I noted the impediment of another group going through long discourses on history & then dropped that idea."
91,Taj Mahal,"We have spent 2 weeks in India with a tour group.  We have seen a lot of forts and palaces - Agra Fort is one of them.  To be honest, it is not that special compared to the others.  Only a small portion of the fort is opened for the tourist.  You really don't see much.  You can actually see Taj Mahal from across the river."
92,Very beautiful and special fort or kings palace  ,This is an attraction that is best appreciated with a guide conversant in its history.  It was built in sections and - most notably - is where Shah Jahan was imprisoned.  Without the history it's not anywhere near as interesting.Be prepared for crowds so go early.  Many school groups visit during the week.
93,What a view! ,"Nice fort, although nothing special. Similar to other red forts in India. You can skip this one if you go to Delhi's red fort."
94,Beautiful and such interesting history linked to the Taj Mahal.,Agra Fort definitely worth visiting! Really well maintained and interesting to wander around. It exceeded our expectations. We did not use a guide but I imagine this would be worthwhile.
95,Thanks to my guide Ahmad a swift entry and what a large and impressive fortress and palace!,"There are many forts in india,and this is one of the best with mogul architecture. If in agra and has time to see only few things,my suggestion will be agra fort and taj mahal."
96,If you are in the area...,The history behind the fort and that view is enough to make anyone‚Äôs heart ache.  Go here before the Taj Mahal for the first glimpse.  It‚Äôs worth it!
97,Very interesting place,"Interesting day out, great history. I would recommend having a guide to give you the best insight into the fort. It was very busy with tourists, I would recommend going early in the morning as it gets very hot later in the day"
98,Very nice; worth to see,"My wife and I visited Agra Fort, after our visit to the Taj Mahal. Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty till 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. The Agra fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857 which caused the end of the British East India Company‚Äôs rule in India and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain. Our tour coach dropped us off at the front entrance and we were escorted inside by a professional guide. A local guide can explain the history of the Fort to you, so it is a nice experience to have this knowledge at the site. Their were many Indian people viewing the Fort, even more than foreigners. The grounds are very photogenic, as are the distant views to the Taj Mahal. Looking at the photos on TA, it is hard to take a photo of something different, as we mostly have the same eye for beauty. There are plenty of stairs here, so wear comfortable shoes. A visit to this historical fort is highly recommended."
99,Massive,This was the oldest fort in once upon a time when the Mughal king was there .. palace looks like not so maintained but charm is there....
100,Nice but could be cleaner ,Outstanding Mughal architecture both inside and outside. We had a good guide who was very knowledgeable and made our visit extremely interesting. The gardens are beautifully laid out.
101,Second Fort in two days.,"Next best thing in Agra after Taj-Mahal, beautiful landscapes and incredible marble handcraft..................."
102,Great View of the Taj Mahal,"HIghly recommend you see this fort before you see the Taj Mahal.  Definitely have a guide--either one you get at the fort or one you pay ahead of time.  If you arrange for one earlier, then they are able to assist with getting your tickets and showing you where you need to be to get the best pictures.  There are many, many great stories about this fort and if you take your time you will really begin to understand a little of the story that is woven into this location.  Not set up for wheelchairs very well as it is an ancient location and the ground is very uneven.  Outside the gates there are many, many street vendors who will follow you down the street trying to sell you trinkets.  Decide ahead of time if you want to purchase anything (some stuff is pretty cool!!) but be prepared to discuss the price!!  A guide will help you with getting good pictures and there are many, many spots to do that.  Take your time.  Don't rush."
103,good place,"This a very impressive fort made of red sandstone built in the 1600 century  has a long history of occupation.Once inside the main feature is the architecture which in some cases quite stunning especially the ceiling's and columns,a little restoration work was being carried out but did not affect our visit,the best place to see the  Taj Mahal which is only 2.5km away is near the the octagonal tower on the north side.The fort is certainly worth a visit just for the architecture alone"
104,Must visit,A massive red sandstone fort standing high above the town. Inside a number of beautiful palace buildings lived in by the ruling family and their entourage. A large and attractive site - a little crowded in places. Beware of touts at entrance.
105,Exquisite place to visit,"the wealth this country once enjoyed is breath taking, how the other half lived is amazing combined with the history of the Taj this place is amazing"
106,Must stop in Agra,"Spent a couple of hours been shown around the fort by our guide Sakhander. Very interesting and very beautiful place and considering you only get to see 20% of it as the Indian army occupy the rest, quite large. Barter hard with your guide, never accept their first price."
107,Tour with tour guide Nadeem,The first standout on Agra Fort is that it is large and beautiful. Between the contrast of the white marble and the red sandstone it is an imposing building. Once you get through the fortification it opens up into vast courtyards and palaces that are splendid to observe. Bring walking shoes and water as it can be quite hot. Photographer Advice.- December (when we visited) can be quite foggy so don't bother trying to rush first thing in the morning. The haze will obscure many of your shots. I would wait till later and enjoy your breakfast while letting the sun burn off the haze. - The fort offers some unique challenges. You have a lot of wide angle shots and many up close shots. I did most of my shots with a 18-135mm lens and a cell phone panoramas.
108,Nice. Go there!,"Sadly the Agra Fort and its palaces does not have huge write ups in guide books as everyone rushes to the Taj Mahal, but on the opposite bank of the river Yamuna, there is so much to see. Take your first view of the Taj from the palace where its builder Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his son so that he could look to his wife's tomb each day! There are palaces, barracks and lots of monkeys."
109,Stunning palace of the Mughal Emperors.  Not to be missed!,"Went to Agra fort in Nov 2019. Really enjoyed the place. would recommend a guide it should not cost more than 200/- or 250/- rupees but bargain. Can get hot , carry a bottle of water ."
110,Beautiful Amazingly Well-Preserved Fort,"A must visit in a Delhi visit. Its the place from where the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb ruled before the capital was moved to Delhi.Just three kilometres away from the Taj, with some fantastic views of the Taj and the Yamuna river.The Maratha ruler Shivaji escaped from this fort from Aurangzeb's custody and went on to challenge Aurangzeb"
111,Agra fort,"A world heritage site, it overlooks the wonderful Taj Mahal, and is the Fort where the Taj creator, Shah Jahan, was deposed and restrained by his son, Aurangzeb.It is rumoured that Shah Jahan died in Muasamman Burj, a tower with a marble balcony with a view of the Taj Mahal. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638.The Fort gives you spectacular view up the river Yamuna, and across Agra.Well worth a visit."
112,Agra trip would have been incomplete without this,"You guessed it, another Unesco world heritage site. It is a beautiful red sand stone structure. On a good clear day you can see the Taj mahal which is at a distance of a couple of miles. Our chirpy guide let us know that the Emperor Shah Jahan who built the Taj Mahal was locked up here by his son and he spent his days looking across at the Taj. The fort is surrounded by lots of other monuments. Worth taking time to see things ‚Äì don‚Äôt be rushed by your guide."
113,Another jewel in the crown ,"Worth a visit. Interesting place. Beautiful building. The views are spectacular. A guide would be useful in order to fully appreciate the history of it. Our friend lost her phone in it and went to speak to security and they had it. She had left it in the cafe and it had been handed in. Such honest people!,"
114,The Large Red Fort in Agra,"Very busy around the entrance with visitors and the occasional monkey being nosey. Impressive moat surrounding the fort and can imagine in the day what it was like. Once inside it is immense and considering only 25% is able to be toured it is impressive.Towards the river side you get a very clear view not too far away of the Taj Mahal. The history  and stories relating to the fort are worth listening to. Spent about an hour here , maybe too short but enjoyed it and worth the visit"
115,Must see location when visiting Agra,"this agra fort is quite big in size.when you enter.again,security check first.inside in my opinion has not much to see.at one corner you can see taj mahal from a distance,quite nice.the rest has nothing impress to me.if you have too much free time, go there.nothing to miss"
116,Lovely and a must visit. ,"This place is another one of India‚Äôs gems and there is a reason why it‚Äôs on the Golden Triangle route.I would recommend getting a tour guide, don‚Äôt pay more than 500 as you can get them cheaper. It‚Äôs worth having a guide as there is a lot of fascinating history behind this place, and they get the best pictures."
117,Well worth a visit. Recommended. ,"Magnificent architecture, and well-maintained 16th-century walled-city fortress. To understand the rich history and significance of the structures, it is best to have a good tour guide."
118,very average ,An interesting history of an important stronghold. Very well maintained. Allow several hours to take it all in.
119,Sandstone Fort (1565),A most enjoyable tour as this fort has been in so many movies dating back to early TV and movies.We loved the tour and the stories and history.Great tour and dont forget to take a government registered guide as they have well researched history on the site and their stories are amazing.The guides do this for a living and speak several languages so they are professionals and the rate is fairly standard across their profession.Get the best of Agra by staying a couple of days.
120,A small part is open to public,"Beautiful and marvellous architecture, it is situated near to the Taj Mahal.Public communication is available to reach this place.It is a place of historical importance. History lovers will love this place. Better to take a guide to know details"
121,Fort with Family,"If you are here, you should probably go to the fort.  Interesting history and architecture.  A little more peaceful than the other Agra site!"
122,nice,"Worth visiting with a guide. The guide nicely draw your attention towards architecture, lifestyle, its usefulness, view of Taj from here etc etc..."
123,Good attraction of Agra,This would have been amazing to see in full action in the 1700s. A very big fort. The red stone is a feature of the area and a symbol of the builders.
124,Good place to see in Agra,"This palace--still a working army fort--is a must-see on any trip to Agra.  About 25% of the fort is open to the public, but it's a fascinating display of two different eras of Mughal architecture.  There is the red sandstone palace, and the newer, white marble palace.  All of the rooms offer a little explanatory plaque, but for a real experience go with a local guide.  You'll learn a lot about how these Muslim emperors lived, and the guide will add colourful legends, for example how Shah Jahan was imprisoned and looked over at his beloved wife's tomb (the Taj Mahal) from one particular balcony.  It'll invariably be crowded with young locals out to laze about on the lawns or take endless selfies of themselves.  Still despite the crowds, this is well worth the visit.  There are also great views from the parapets over the river and city."
125,The scale of the Fort is Unbelievable!,"From outside it seems to be a normal fort just like many others in India. Inside the palace is grand and unique in many aspects. Special palaces for the King- the khas mahal, queen Jodhabai palace, the palace of daughters Jahanara and Roshanara, the place where ShahJahan was house arrested, the balcony from where he use to see the Taj are all epic places. The View of Taj from here is just marvellous on the banks of Yamuna. The Diwan-I-khas and  Diwan-I-Aam are impressive and the seat of Birbal is still present where he used to sit in Akbar's court. A big impressive garden on the outside is well maintained and beautifies the place. There were two levels of security outside the fort. First line of defence was water channels full of crocodiles followed by a jungle full of tigers and lions. Really impressive architecture made of red sandstones. Just impressive and grand in every aspect."
126,Solid Fort,"But all the same, the guide explained all the detail and brought the place to life. Amazing views across to the Taj Mahal on the terrace and well worth visiting no matter how many forts you had seen already."
127,Visit,"Looking from outside it's just a typical fort with massive walls but the red sandstone makes it striking. Inside is quite impressive with its incredible maze of walled courtyards, mosques and lavish private chambers reflecting the grandeur of the Mughal Empire. Peaking through the lattice windows that look out across the river to the Taj Mahal is amazing."
128,Worth visiting,The marvel of a place that still exudes the power and majesty of the Maraja India then stripped of British greed. A place to visit absolutely
129,Amazing fort not to be missed.,We spent less than 2 hours here on a guided tour but could have stayed longer. You can see the Taj Mahal in the distance from the royal pavillions.
130,Loved it!,"beautiful buildings with an interesting history, always best to go with a guide to explain more about what you are looking atonly downside is that the guy in the ticket booth short changed me by 1000 rupees - I wanted to pay by card but ""the machine is not working"" so I had to pay in cash, I gave him 2000 he gave me change for 1000. I wouldn't normally think about checking someone on the official desk and therefore only noticed when i went to tip the guide so the lesson is always check your change"
131,Interesting,"Gives a good long distance view of the Taj as well, the locals keep the maintenance up to a great standard, magnificent architecture and a step back in history."
132,Not to be missed,It‚Äôs hard for anything to be your next stop after the Taj Mahal but the Agra Fort is an amazing place to explore. Parts of it are still occupied by the military and are off limits but that still leaves plenty to see. We particularly enjoyed the views of the Taj Mahal and the gardens. It takes roughly an hour and a half to see it all.
133,Better that the fort at Delhi,We visited Agra from Jaipur. It is roughly 220km by road. Visited Agra fort. It‚Äôs mesmerising!! Beautiful red stone structure with Mughal and Persian architecture.Information about different parts within the fort is missing. It would be advisable to read about the fort before visiting it. You will then enjoy it more!!
134,Agra trip,Enough remains of this walled city to connect you to the early mogul Emperors. It is hard to imagine it in its hayday when it was a working palace complex Well worth the visit
135,Amazing Architecture,This is also one of the nice place after Taj mahal to visit. Old and historical fort. Many tourist came here after visiting Taj mahal.
136,WOW!!!,Go with a guide if possible..they bring it to life.Much history to be gained.Fascinating building.
137,Magnificent fort,It's one of the best place to visit in Agra it's more interested to see the sunset from the Fort you gave beautiful view of Taj Mahal!
138,Go before visiting Taj,Do not confuse with the Red Fort at Dehli! The hard red sandstone is the only thing in common. This is a monument to the 16th century and architectural features abound. Look at the white marble parts inside and marvel at the amazing craftmanship.
139,Excellent,This place is truly stunning! The history and the architecture is truly breathtaking and the details are incredible.
140, Cool architecture,"Myself, my wife and my elder brother visited this well preserved monument and there is so much to see and know about this fort.It is well worth visiting this place at any cost."
141,Amazing,"My third visit to agra fort. Some more restrictions are imposed to save the monument but most of the part is open for tourist. Guide is must which one can hire from ticket counter. Ample paid parking is available so no worries for vehicle. Best time to visit is post noon, so one can clearly see the tajmahal from agra fort. It needs approx 2-3 hrs to explore."
142,One Of Many Forts,"this fort is a classic example of moghul architecture, it is built by indian and moghul styles. it need some more care and govt of India and ASI should also take more care"
143,Beautiful Structure,If you learn story of the dethroned king and see where he was imprisoned - it's worth seeing his view of the Taj in his old age.  Not an awesome tourist attraction but something to do in Agra.
144,Breathtaking,A not to be missed tourist trail moment. Especially if you are a history buff. A glimpse into the old world and grandeur of India. Plenty of photo opportunities and lots to learn from local guides. Mind out for the hawkers.
145,Great architectural fort,I visited Agra with my friends in June this year. I visited there all historic places. I liked the Red Fort very much. It is relatively less crowded city than Delhi. There are many nearby places to visit. Bus & Train Connectivity is very good for all places in India. Flight are very few upto Delhi only.
146,Stunning,"We have been travelling around North India for a month and have seen a few Forts. My expectations for the Agra Fort were high. Unfortunately there are a lot of areas closed off for repairs which meant that there wasn‚Äôt many places to explore like at other Forts. This is still a very impressive Fort. I understand that maintenance is required, so we probably just lucked out. There should be an audio option like at the Amber Fort in Jaipur, because there isn‚Äôt enough signage or information available unless you pay for a guide. We expected it to take 2 hours but one hour was plenty."
147,Great,This is another stunning piece of architecture. It is a shame that not much of it can be explored. Would love to go in the rooms and see more of the beauty inside this fort.
148,"If you're at The Taj Mahal, you may as well stop by - Nicole Rovig",The bulk of the Fort is occupied by the army but the 10% plus that you can visit is plenty.  The fortifications from the moat to the double wall and so on makes it formidable.  The accommodations of the Ruling family along with the fascinating history are splendid even if some parts have been allowed to deteriorate over time.  It is well worth a visit and as a bonus you can see the Taj Mahal in the distance from the Fort.
149,Family Holiday,Fort is big and beautiful and gives glimpse of life style of mughal emperors. About 25% of the whole area is open for public while rest is still used by Army. View of Taj Mahal from Agar Fort is also very beautiful.
150,Worth hiring a guide,"Beautiful place, we had the best guide who was so knowledgeable & friendly - I would suggest a guided tour for any would be visitor."
151,Golden Triangle tour,This was an amazing place. We went there after visiting Tajmahal. Tajmahal can be seen from here as well. Shah Jahan was imprisoned here by his son for his madness like making another Tajmahal which was supposed to be black.
152,An great history linked to the Taj,If you are in Agra you ‚Äòmust‚Äô visit the Taj Mahal and Agra fort. Google some background information before you go. The buildings don‚Äôt just look nice. There lies a nice a story in them!
153,A pleasant suprise,"We were taken to Agra Fort as part of our G Adventure Golden Triangle guided tour. It was only 15 minutes drive from our hotel. We arrived at 11:00 and left at 13:00, plenty of time to look around, lister to our guide briefing and even to rest. Queues at entrance are long but fast, to get tickets and to be searched, one line for men, another for women‚Äôs bags. Food is not allowed, it will be confiscated. It was very crowded but stayed very clean, no litter. Many areas to see in this fort. The architect and details of the structures were amazing. You can view Taj Mahal from the top, which was spectacular. It is worth the visit."
154,"An impressive representation of Mughal architecture, Agra fort showcases beautiful marble inlay work. Worth visiting.","This huge, sprawling red sandstone fortress was once a royal palace. We visited near sunset, which was perfect--not so hot, not so many people, and beautiful light for pictures.  We wound our way up the hill on cobbled stone pathways, passing through huge red sandstone gates, and emerged at the top on a beautiful green lawn surrounded by fortifications.  From there we headed toward the ‚Äúharem palace.‚Äù  Passing through yet another gate we found ourselves in a lovely Versailles-like garden with beautiful flowers‚Äîreds, orange, and green.  Located on three sides were the quarters for all of the women of the harem.  Continuing on up the stairs to higher platforms, we found the remains of a large swimming pool, and finally buildings of the former palace, including wedding chapels built for Jafar‚Äôs daughters and summer palaces for the royal family. From the chapel windows, views of the Taj Majal, the valley, and the river below were magnificent. Making our way back to more public areas of the fortress, we saw the Shah‚Äôs audience chamber‚Äîa large open-air building with many columns supporting the roof and an elaborately-carved balcony, from which the Shah would address his people.  Although some areas were in a state of partial disrepair, it was still amazing to see the remains of this incredible fortress.  Of course, the Taj Majal is the absolute must-see in Agra, but Agra Fort is also a site not to be missed if time permits."
155,Spectacular and grand in every aspect,Following our visit to Taj Mahal our guide took us to the Agra Fort. Again Arif was most knowledgeable and gave us a super tour ..It is important to visit the Fort in conjunction with the Taj to understand the history of it and what a wonderful place this is too see
156,Gigantic and bulky,A nice location to see Taj Mahal. 550inr with Taj Mahal ticket. Easy to find location. Good place for pictures.
157,Imposing !,"Imposing red sandstone walls and moat guard the royal residences of the Mughal Emperors, with the current external structure dating from the 16th century. Much of the interior structures are attributed to the rule of Shah Jahan, who was imprisoned here by his son from 1658 until his death in 1666. Historically and culturally significant."
158,Mughal Capital fort,"It‚Äôs a must visit place in my opinion, if you are in Agra. Lots of guides will approach you at the entrance offering their services. If you are a first timer and you like to know more about the history of the fort, it‚Äôs a good idea to hire a guide. They will be able to explain the history, they will show you the major attractions inside, they will lead the way through the crowd and they make space for you to capture photos ( they even take pictures of you). It‚Äôs a good idea to go there early morning to avoid the crowd. You will see many spots of architectural beauty/ wonders inside the palace. I strongly recommend visiting this place."
159,Its Magnificent,"This is the place the emperor Shah Jahan who commissioned the Taj Mahal was imprisoned. Not as big or impressive as some similar places visited on our tour, but still an interesting place. Worth a visit"
160,It's ok to visit if you are only going to Agra and really want to see a fort,"Found the fort amazing. Could not help but amaze at the scientific construction that made it possible for them to enjoy air conditioning at that time when there was no electricity. The sheesh mahal or palace of mirrors, bathroom of the queen, was closed for tourists but we were told by our guide how there were a thousand reflections of the queen in every tiny mirror piece that made the sheesh mahal.The open air prison of emperor Shah Jehan, from where he watched the Taj Mahal in his last 7 years, was magnificent.For people traveling to Agra fort, please use the online booking system to book tickets. The below scan code board is very useful.Standing in the regular queue to book tickets could take very long.Do ensure to book your main online by scanning the code on your mobile but you need another small ticket called ADA ticket to gain entry.do not forget to buy your ADA ticket offline( that costs Rs. 10 for Indian tourists)"
161,Beautiful but I wish we could explore it more,The trip to the fort was a journey down the history of India. Every pillar had a story to tell. You can even see the Taj Mahal from it on a clear day.
162,Interesting!,Was pleasantly surprised by Agra Fort. I have already seen a number of forts throughout India but this was my favourite by far.Definitely worth checking out.
163,A great start,"Had the most amazing tour this morning - great views, fabulous architecture and gardens, highly recommend your time being spent here!"
164,Another fort,"In the Agra Fort, many structures from the era of Mughal Emperor Akbar and Jahangir are non-existent now. Many structures were demolished or remodelled by Emperor Shah Jahan to build new structures and many were demolished by the British who had complete disregard for heritage, architectural marvel or for that matter anything which was not British.Most of the construction in Emperor Shah Jahan‚Äôs era was made of marble or the finishing was such that the structure looked like that of marble. One such structure is the Khas Mahal (Special Palace or Private Palace). This structure was built by Shah Jahan in place of an existing structure of Emperor Akbar in red sandstone.Emperor Shah Jahan‚Äôs historian Lahauri in Padshahnama calls it ‚ÄòAramgah e Muqaddas‚Äô (The King‚Äôs Bed-Chamber or sleeping chamber of the king). It is flanked on either side by identical pavilions or structures with curved Bangladar roof and chajja.These pavilions are built of red sand stone and are fully white stuccoed and polished like white marble.  The northern structure has brackets-and lintel openings, while the southern one has cusped arches. The northern structure appears to be from pre Shah Jahanian era, the southern structure was probably a later addition. There is confusion on the utility of these structures. According to some historians the southern structure was the private pavilion of Emperor Shah Jahan‚Äôs favourite daughter Jahanara who after the death of Mumtaz Mahal became the Padshah Begum (Padshah Begum was a superlative imperial title conferred upon the ‚Äòimperial‚Äô or ‚ÄòFirst Lady‚Äô of the Mughal Empire and was considered to be the most important title in the Mughal harem or zenana, in English it is wrongly translated as to being equivalent to that of Empress which is not the case in the Mughal Empire), thus this pavilion is also called Jahanara Palki and northern structure was the private pavilion of Emperor Shah Jahan‚Äôs another daughter Roshanara who supported Emperor Aurangzeb when he revolted against Shah Jahan and him; thus this pavilion is also called Roshanara Palki.Lahauri (Shah Jahan‚Äôs historian) mentions that the northern one was used by Shah Jahan for Jharokha-Darshan (viewing window), in addition to the Shah-Burj.The confusion arises because of the logic as to why would Emperor‚Äôs bed room or pleasure room be flanked by that of his daughters and that too when the main palace is separated by artistic Saraparda (white marble jaali curtain) which is divided into vertical sections each one bearing a trefoil arch. Emperor Shah Jahan led a colour full life with a harem full of his many wives and concubines. Other than these he had relations with the wives of his courtiers after the death of his favourite (as per popular literary sources) wife Mumtaz Mahal. So why would he want his daughters to be closely watching his activities?Aramgah or Khas Mahal is laid out in three receding levels; the main palace overlooking the river Yamuna in eastern side; open terraces; and the garden on the western side (Anguri Bagh) respectively.The main palace consists of a central hall, with Shah-Nashin (Alcoves) and rooms on the sides, and a large dalaan (courtyard) on its front, facing the garden. It is entirely built of white marble, painted with floral motifs, the gilded niches above the dados contained portraits of the Mughal Emperors, beginning with Taimur, which, like so many other things, were looted and taken away by the Raja of Bharatpur.The courtyard or the Dalaan has a big ornamental pool containing 5 fountains and 32 jets (still functional).Inside the palace water rippled through a shallow canal to a water-fall, behind which, true to the style, a Chini-Khanah (series of candle-niches) is provided. These water devices created an enchanting atmosphere in the palace. A Persian poem inscribed on the walls of the Khas Mahal gives the date of its construction as 1636 CE.This Khas Mahal is said to have served as a model for Diwan ai Khas in Red Fort Delhi."
165,Worth visiting ,"its super stunning this fort,i heard a lot about the Taj mahal but its more then i amazing while you see it live from your eyes,its mind blowing,That,s why its wonder of the world,specially if you can manage to be there for sun rise.i really like this fort,just people are annoying."
166,Beautiful fort steeped in history,"One of Agra most famous places. It's a really well maintained building and definitely the number two in Agra after Taj Mahal. If I remember right, the entrance fee is about 300 rupees for foreigners."
167,Don't hesitate to visit it,"We visited this fort on an afternoon, after travelling from Delhi to Agra.Our tour company arranged a tour guide for us, and he was with us during our Agra days. I recommend you come with someone and make these arrangements ahead of time, as it could be overwhelming to be greated by many people offering the same service when you reach the fort (plus others trying to sell different things to you).The fort is beautiful. My favourite section was the king's chambers (or cell), where you could actually see the Taj Mahal. The garden area is also gorgeous. I highly recommend this place."
168,Very impressive ,Although only part is open to the public it is worth a visit. Get the guide to show you the trick view of the Taj Mahal through the lattice window.
169,Must see!,Fun place to explore.  After out guide showed us the Taj we took a Rikshaw to the Fort.  The Fort was amazing.  History of the fort was interesting.  Another must see.
170,Nice fort to visit,"I visit agra fort in, December it's amazing and very beautiful. It's very good historical place for visit. This was very enjoyable visit. We hire a guide who explained what we are seeing."
171,Historical Fort Significant Past,"An amazing building built out of red sandstone, huge and  beautifully decorated with flower motifs in Moslem style.Different to the Taj Mahal but another incredible site  which is a must see in Agra."
172,A place of Historical importance,I visited this place with a guide. I would recommend using one otherwise you will see the building and surrounds but miss out on some pretty good information that makes it more worthwhile. You can see the Taj Mahal from within through the windows. Unfortunately my day was very smoggy so photos weren‚Äôt a great option. A tick off the bucket list though. You pay prior to crossing the bridge on the right hand side. Watch for people trying to sell tickets prior to getting in. Don‚Äôt take a bag.
173,I enjoyed this more than the Taj Mahal,Great fort although I'd say 75% of the fort is inaccessible which is a bit of a let down but still good for visiting and taking photos. On a hazy day you can't see the Taj though!
174,"Get a Guide and really enjoy this place, some great stories","I came to Agra Fort late on November afternoon and overall I was impressed with the architecture. The fort did not have good signposting within it to show the direction of travel and as a westerners we did receive lots of attention from domestic tourists, some of it unpleasant. There are some good views of the Taj although there are better viewpoints."
175,A trip to Agra,Better than Delhi fort. Guides in many languages not too expensive. Strongly recommend to get one as like in any Indian place if interest there is very little information.
176,Disapointing,"Only the red part is open, because the marble area is where the Indian army settles. This is the old palace of the Mughal Dynasty. You can find where the king judged people and international businessmen‚Äôs cases. The gate of the performance hall shows symbols of multiple religions: Judaism, Islam, Hindu, Christianity, etc., as the consorts were from all backgrounds."
177,Agra Fort - A must visit when in Agra,Magnificent structure and incredible history. So well preserved. We were with an organised tour so we were limited with where we could go but would have loved to have roamed and seen more. Its a must see.
178,Just a fort !,"Didn't expect that much with the fort but a very good experience visiting it! It has a very beatiful view of the Taj Mahal also, and t'he fortress conservation is very good."
179,Disappointing,"Many folks seem to go to Agra just for the Taj Mahal, if time permits try to get to Agra Fort, one of the best Mughal forts in India, we feel it is well worth it.  The scale of the fort is impressive, originally a military fortress it was later turned into a palace."
180,Impressive fort,"The fort is located at a major crossing just like the Red Fort in New Delhi and is therefore extremely congested. There was a long queue in the ticket counter, which was obvious too as the entire Taj Mahal crowd was queuing up at Agra fort since the later was closed. I finally entered the fort. It‚Äôs a nice and large fort, very well maintained ans clean too. Lots and lots of foreign tourists everywhere. The most spectacular part was the small windows carved out on the east wall from where shah jahan used to see the Taj Mahal. Man !! It looked spectacular from here. Particularly it was sunset time and the domes were shining white in the sun. There is significant walking inside the fort so a comfy pair of shoes is suggested."
181,"Enjoyable, lots of sections closed though!",May not look as good outside as some other forts but inside it‚Äôs beautiful.Really worth a visit and you have great views of the Taj Mahal too!
182,Beautiful heritage site... must visit this historic fort,"We liked this Fort better than the Red Fort, but both were amazing. If you‚Äôre in Agra, definitely take the time to stop for a visit."
183,Quite a large complex of buildings and gardens,"This is the home of the Shah Jahan, who built the Taj Mahal for his wife. It‚Äôs right across from the Taj Mahal so he could see it. A beautiful fort in its own right. Partially (80%) closed off as it‚Äôs still in use by the Indian Army but what you see is really amazing! We enjoyed going through it with our guide! Definitely get a guide do you get the full background story."
184,Massive fort/palace,With Mr Syed's help we explored the city of Taj . It was an awesome experience. He planned our visit in such a manner we can explore everything in a short span of we had at our hand. Thanks Mr Syed will again give you trouble
185,If you are in Agra not to be missed,"The walls are very impressive and very red sandstone.Once inside there is a lot of marble.Plenty of rooms to visit but none are furnished.Signage a bit hit and miss, which is a problem.Views to the Taj Mahal are a highlight."
186,Mogul History,This fort was bulit for Akbar in 1565. The place is also known as red fort beacause the walls of the palace is red in colour. I visited this place for the first time and i liked the fort as its totally open and The Great Taj mahal can be seen from here. The cost of ticket is 40‚Çπ for Indians. This place is also one of the oldest mahals in agra and can be visited once for its history and taj view.
187,Visit to the Agra Fort,Just another amazing place to visit. You could spend hours wondering around. It is so big you can get lost! A lot of history too. It's the following of the Taj Mahal. To many people trying to sell you anything - to many guides too (inside&outside). It's overwhelming and tiring.
188,Fort,"Agra Fort in Agra and Red Fort in Delhi have a similar architecture (Mughal I think, as it is also Muslim/Mongol). The Agra fort was built before that the Red fort, when Agra was still the capital of the empire."
189,Very good - visit when you go to the Taj Mahal,Do yourself a favor and hire a guide for this place. There was so much history and details about this fort that we discovered through our guide which made us appreciate the fort even more. It's quite impressive.
190,Vacation Trip,"A wonderful surprise since all the focus (at least ours) was on the main attraction that is the Taj Mahal.Crowdy, but you still enjoy the beauty of the site and the history present everywhere...if only those walls could tell their stories.A must see."
191,Home Shah Jahan... the builder of the Taj Mahal.,"The Agra Fort is #2 in Agra on TripAdvisor. The Taj Majal is #1, and for good reason. The Taj is amazing. The fort is  a 4 out of 5 because it's just that; very good. Certainly go and see the Agra Fort, and spend 2-3 hours. I believe that a section of the Fort is where the emporer spent the last 8 years of his life under house arrest by his son who dethroned him. Now that's interesting."
192,A must-do visit in Agra,"I initially thought our visit to Agra Fort was to 'kill time' before we saw the Taj Mahal.  Boy, was I wrong.  This is a must see while in Agra, and the story behind it very interesting.  Go!"
193,Worth the Look,"Rajasthan is all about forts and this was the least interesting one in my trip (Agra is actually in Uttar Pradesh, east of Rajasthan). In my opinion, Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur has more beautiful interior and stunning features, Chittor Fort is huge and high, offering great views in all directions, and Amer Fort in Jaipur is better preserved. After the entrance, walk up the hill and turn right to see the better part of the fort and its marble garden. I won't recommend going here unless you are not planning to visit Rajasthan. Even if you are staying only in Agra, I recommend allocating more time at Fatepur Sikri."
194,Worthy of a visit,"It opens at 6 AM. Tickets are available online at Archeological Survey of India website. You can skip the ques by purchasing them online. Commuting to this place is easy and we didnot find it hard in getting the parking of our vehicle. Parking is just across the road. You can hire uber/ola to reach here.Guide is must for all the visitors including Indians, if you are visiting Agra fort . They will tell you all the relevant detail which will make your visit way more meaningful, otherwise you will end up looking at the walls. Guides do bargain, so try your luck but be reasonable as they also have a family to look after.Its best to visit the fort early before 9 AM as it gets way crowded after that and you will beat the heat if you are visiting in any other season than winters.Its a must visit place if you are visiting Agra."
195,Set the scene before the Taj Mahal!,Agra fort is a historical monument beside Yamuna river overlooking Tajmahal.Nice built complexes contain Dewan e aam and Dewan e khas with mehals for queens.Major part of this fort occupied by Indian army.This fort offers a light and sound show at night which is quite enriching experience.
196,An interesting place,If you start your trip to India in Delhi you will already be familiar with Akbar by the time you get to Agra but leaving aside the truly stunning architecture what is before you is a fascinating insight into the courtly life of an emperor and his family and courtiers. Learn stories about judgmental elephants and favourite musicians and wonder at the lives of women and craftsmen.
197,Very interesting and beautiful site,Our guide Ravi. Having visited the Taj Mahal with him yesterday and previous day with another guide Ali to Fatehpur Sikri this was then the final link here (well until Delhi red fort) again the most wonderful construction in red sand stone. Ravi has such good spoken English and explains history very clearly and concisely
198,Good old Akbar,"I've been there the day after visiting the Taj to complete the history learning in site. Very recommendable to understand all the history. Hate the British devastation did here, but usual from the pirates of the world.I've made the tour with an excellent local guide from Taj Universal Trip : Shakil. Highly recommended."
199,The great palce of Mogul,"This fort was Capital of Mughal empire for quite some time. Later capital was shifted to Red Fort in Delhi. I wonder if capital would not have been shifted, then Agra would have been Capital of India....Strange thoughts...75% fort is an army base and rest is available for sight seeing. One can see Taj Mahal from this fort during sunny days. Shah Jahan was kept in Prison here for 9 years and died watching Taj mahal from his cell."
200,Fantastic view of Taj Mahal,"Visited 42 acre Fort Agra, also called Cloud Fort. 75% occupied by military. Built in 1555, taking 8 years, with an alligator occupied mote, an outer wall and an inner wall. Tigers in between walls. When we entered today men and women entered in separate lines for body checks. Saw the following: Front of palace within the fort. Islamic king, Hindu architecture, Jahangir‚Äôs Bath tub of solid granite, View of the Taj from  Shah Jehan‚Äôs prison."
201,Well maintained with great history,Just go see it! You will not be disappointed.  I would recommend a guide as they can show you so much more!
202,Essential visit,I guess you never get to remember enough of this forts history.  It's my second visit and I learnt so much more with the guide. It's worth having one. It's a beautiful place and a must when in Agra.
203,Different religious symbols in one building.,"Amazing place wich takes you back in history imagening how life looked back then. Worth of time and money, I would be sorry if we missed to visit it."
204,Well worth a Visit ,"Actually this was the king‚Äôs Shah Jahan and wife Mumtaz, palace .This is the king that built the Taj Mahal for memory of his wife in the 17 century. Very nice palace , only 20% open to the public . Great view of Taj Mahal from distance. Take 1 hour to explore. Entrance 8 USDLRS."
205,Love it.,Nice experience visit here after visiting Taj Mahal. But you have to walk lot of to visit Taj and red fort. Try to visit during the winter season.
206,Whoaaaa!,"I was amazed by the many innovations & extravagances that the Shahs had while living here.  We hired a guide who took us through the fort, which I highly recommend.  We learned so much history about them and were able to appreciate the designs of the fort even better than before.  Highly recommend!"
207,Amazing,"They way how Indian kings and their family lived is very interesting. especially the way they decorate basically everything. very colorful, which is nice."
208,:),"A pleasant surprise. Definitely hire a guide to make this tour worthwhile. Very impressive architecture and deceptively large palace. A must, to put on your sightseeing list!"
209,Mrs,While visiting the Mehtabh Bagh had to cross over to the other side where the Agra Fort was situated.The Fort has a great profile:It looks magnificent from outside.Good to study about it or take a guide to delve deeper in the past.See the Taj from this angle too.
210,Absolutely beautiful ,Worth a visit. The museums were very interesting. It was a shame that many of the buildings were inaccessible and uncared for.
211,Agra Fort,A very interesting place our guide was very good with lots of information - not that I remember it all there was so much to take in.
212,Magnificent site,Must see place in Agra.A historical place with some of common ruler having there contribution. Shahajahan who built Taj was house arrested in this fort .It is wonderful to see this which has wonderful carvings. View from here of Taj is amazing. Hire a guide compulsorily.
213,Chic palace,"OK, let us be frank, anything in Agra is going to take a huge second place to the Taj Mahal which is spectacular beyond belief.  That in mind this is a really good place to visit for a number of reasons, ironically one of them is the great views of the Taj Mahal!  The fort is really interesting and there is a lot of interesting detail to learn, the facilities are really well managed and this is a strong recommendation for an enjoyable visit"
214,Do not miss this one,Absolut impressive! You can imagine the history of the powerful family and how they lived and found their decisions. Seeing this creates ideas of the old stories.
215,Well worth a visit,"It's currently undergoing renovations, so parts of the fort aren't open to view.There is a small entrance fee but beware you will have people trying to hassle you to be your guide inside.It's very quiet, you can see the Taj Mahal from here on a clear day."
216,Giant,Agra Fort was the first stop on our tour and an excellent beginning to our trip of a lifetime. The rain had come a few days before our visit so the smog had all but gone and it was from here we got our first glimpse of the landscape and the Taj Mahal. The fort is another must . We had a an excellent local guide whose knowledge was first class and gave us an excellent grounding in the history of India and Rajasthan
217,History of Mughals,Second best attraction in Agra. We manage to get a really cheap tour inside so don‚Äôt grab one at the entrance as they will try to rip you off. A lot to learn and see in this place... we really enjoyed our visit.
218,So much history!,"Your Agra visit is incomplete, if you don't visit the Agra Fort, along with the Taj Mahal. The story of the two buildings is poignantly related. Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor, who built the Taj Mahal was imprisoned in the Agra Fort by his son Aurangzeb, and he used to view the Taj, from the Fort, which is situated on the opposite bank of the river Yamuna. The Agra Fort is an impressive building , with various other beautiful buildings inside it. The Mughals used to stay inside the fort and courtly life continued within it. Therefore, the Fort has buildings where the Emperor met the public, as well as private quarters. Shah Jahan's balcony from where he used to sit and watch the Taj is now off- limits , but I was lucky enough to be on it, when I first visited the fort as a teenager.We had beautiful views of the Taj from the Agra Fort and there was a lovely wind blowing too, which cooled us down. However, we along with many other tourists got caught in a very heavy monsoon downpour, that forced us to seek shelter within the fort for almost an hour. We amused ourselves by dancing and singing songs, while sheltering in an alcove.Ultimately, I just decided that we had to make a run for it through the showers, as best as we could. We managed to get out,wading through ankle deep water at the entrance and were soaked to the skin. However, we will always remember this Agra Fort trip because it was the first monsoon shower that my daughter experienced in India."
219,Enormous Fort overlooking Taj Mahal ,An impressive construction.  Red stone and white marble. A little bit crowded in the winter. 600 rupee entrance for foreigner.
220,May skip if already visited Fatehpur Sikri caution abrout shopping trap,Was One addition to Agra visit ...Place was good to knowledge ooit of view and can be visited when at Taj Mahal for its historic value...
221,Decent Fort.,Definitely worth a look. Much bettert then Taj Mahal! Can see most articles. Child friendly and good for a walk around the building.
222,Interesting,"The walls of the fort are 2.6km long, that‚Äôs a big fort. We got there at 7.30am and there was hardly anyone there which was great. We had a guide which helped the going to the best places but evidently you can only visit about 20% of the fort as the rest of it is still being used as a barracks. In 2025, it will all be opening up I believe. And Agra is the only city in the world to have 3 UNESCO sites, definitely worth a visit"
223,more of a castle,"A lot of (one day from Delhi) travellers skip this architectural masterpiece. Don't do the same mistake. The fort is really huge, really nice and you get also a nice view on Taj Mahal."
224,Impressive! ,"This is the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was built by the great Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1565. It a complex with notable buildings such as halls of public audience and private audience. The Fort is built with natural red sandstone from mines.  You will enjoy squirrels running around in the fort‚Äôs garden. SEE photos."
225,Fascinating fort ,"Visited, enjoyed and liked it.It is moghul palace w/ mansions located on big garden walled by a fort.It is characteristic by red stoned used, marble and stone carving craftsmanship."
226,Student abroad,"The overall trip was excellent, a little costly for the amount of time and places visited. Agra Fort visit had to be adjusted and we had to skip lunch. The guide who was very good took us to an art shop which was not needed and we wasted time there. Otherwise, the views of Taj and the Fort were breathtaking."
227,Detailed Architecture,"This is good to do after the Taj Mahal. Again, I would advise booking a guide in advance to explain the fort and who built/lived there."
228,Once Capital of the Mughal Dynasty,"I came again to Agra Fort and believe me, in the second time also I could not see the entire Agra Fort.  it is too big.  It's giant. So much history is hidden in it."
229,Wonderful ancient architecture,This was very impressive and definitely worth the time. An hour  or two would be sufficient to tour this UNESCO site. The view across to the the Taj Mahal was nice.
230,The glories of the past,This place is very big and log this place is in km very big and beautifully  this place views  is amazing 1st view full city agra 2nd side  view   Tajmahal & yamuna river perfect view this place history is very amazing and this place is the oneof the historical place ever... Must try.........
231,Interesting place to visit,"Was built anciently .Vast palace for Shahajan,built in a way that enemy cant attack and withstand any attacks"
232,Outstanding,"Not a dominating hilltop fort like say Jodhpur or Gwalior but a significant presence nonetheless. A substantial entrance leads into the first court-yard, from there you continue to a number of other buildings, internal courtyards and gardens to explore. One of the most picturesque being the marble building where now, unlike eight years ago, you'd have to encounter a good day without a pollution haze to see the Taj Mahal. For such a well visited site there is no signage or information inside, no audio  guide, acceptable at lesser sites perhaps but not one with so many visitors.  decoration though."
233,Loved it almost as much as the Taj,Positives:Beautiful architecture mainly built with red sandstone. Later additions included buildings built with marble. Lovely views across the river towards the Taj Mahal. Negatives:Only 20% open to the public.Verdict:Well worth a visit. Recommended.
234,More impressive than the Taj Mahal,A must seeMarvel at the workmanship from 500-700 years agoCrowded as you‚Äôd expectTry to ignore the hawkers
235,#2 in Agra,"This was the first fort I visited in India, and at the time I thought it was good. However, after later visiting Jaipur's Amber fort and Jodhpur's Mehrangarh fort, I realised how this pales in comparison. The part open to visitors is smaller than those, it's a less impressive structure, and it also has no information, displays or exhibits of any kind. On the positive side, there is a nice view of the Taj Mahal, and some areas are quite pretty, with archways and Mughal architecture. Parts of the fort are falling down which gives it an authentic feel.If you're only visiting Agra, and not going to Jaipur or Jodhpur, then you might enjoy this more. You also need a guide otherwise you're just looking at walls without any meaning. Once I'd searched online for a bit of historical context it was much more interesting."
236,A must-see,"I absolutely loved Agra Fort. I would even go as far as too say its better than the Taj Mahal. There is a lot more to see here and it feels like it has more history to it. Bonus, you get good views of the Taj Mahal from here. Plus, it doesn't seem as busy."
237,A great afternoon at Agra Fort,"Must visit place, near to Tajmahal, better to visit during winter. Better take ticket through online to avoid huge line."
238,It's Massive ... Great Place To Watch Sunset,"My wife and I visited the Agra Fort as part of a Golden Triangle tour with the TripaDeal group in February.Luckily, we had the services of a guide who was able to lead us around the fort and explain everything to us. Dated centuries old, this is a very big complex, with some very intricate marble buildings constructed. And being able to see the Taj Mahal in the distance is a bonus. Another Must See in Agra."
239,The former Kings view of the Taj,"We had a great time and did a short 6 minute video about our experiencing and sharing 3 vital travel tips if you want to have a good time.  Not part of the video but we highly recommend you use a reputable guide for this visit.  The fort is huge and so interesting, the guide really improves the experience.  We are DOUGandNIKI on YouTube go and search for us and watch the video.  You'll enjoy the 6 minutes and get 3 vital tips!"
240,Impressed,"Agra Fort was built in the year 1573 under the reign of Akbar ‚Äì one of the greatest Mughal Emperors. It took more than 4000 workers and eight years of hardship to complete the fort. Knowing the significance of its location, Akbar built the fort to make it the main residence of the Mughals. The fort remained as the main residence of the emperors belonging to the Mughal dynasty until the year 1638. The fort houses numerous impressive structures like the Jahangir Mahal, Khas Mahal, Diwan-i-Khass, Diwan-i-Am, Machchhi Bhawan and Moti Masjid. In 1638, the capital of the Mughal dynasty was moved from Agra to Delhi, causing the Agra Fort to lose its status as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. The fort is separated from its sister monument Taj Mahal by just 2.5 kilometers. Often described as the walled city, Agra Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Today, the fort is a major tourist spot and attracts many tourists from all over the world."
241,"Worth visit, guide useful","Apparently only 30% of the site is open to the public, but even then what you get to see is a massively impressive structure. This is another 'must see' in Agra, fantastic architecture with distant views of the Taj Mahal."
242,Impressive Architecture,"This place is very big and requires decent amount of time to cover it's entirety. And quite significant portion is under Indian Army's control which Tourists are not permitted to visit unless you have some special permission or VVIP! Has many sections from various gardens, parks, mosques, jail's and a view of Taj Mahal besides Yamuna river. Most of the place is made up of red stones and white marbles carved with Mughal architecture. A fort to visit if you have came so long!"
243,Better than Delhi fort. Guides in many languages not too expensive.,"Only ~ 20% is for tourists, 80% for the Indian Army, you will not see to much. You can have a look from outside. Almost all forts in India are mainly for soldiers, but offered as tourist place - not nice."
244,Must do in Agra,We had a very nice time at the fort .I would recommend a guide ..The background information that is provided enhances the experience so much
245,Must see,Well positioned between Taj and Jaipur. Beautiful. We had a guide and that made a lot of difference.
246,Enjoyed alot,"Agra Fort has some of the same detailed workmanship as Taj Mahal, but the impression is entirely different. The fort was a functioning governmental center, and the layout and functionality of the rooms shows that. I really enjoyed it."
247,Agra Fort,"This was booked via our agents with a tour guide, giving us an in-depth history of the family and fort.Excellent üôèüèº"
248,2nd visit,"Have you ever seen an elephant?  But the elephant here smiled and waved its tail as the drums heard from afar. Ready to shake his belly happily.  See yourself alone  Or insolvent Walking into the inside of the fort  The part that passed through the high wall and saw that far away, it didn't take long The marble stucco work decorated with glass.  Thoroughly to the point of focusing on the eyes  Artisans in the past, many gods are really eating The strength of the outer turret with delicate decoration on the inside  As though coming from a different terminal  But harmoniously blended into one body  Think that this visit to India will see only the emperors, each fortress is unique  Have different characteristics Like every fort that goes  And really get in touch closely Another thing that is impressive is the restoration and storage of work pieces in the past.  Saw that he did an excellent job"
249,Amazing history and details ,"One of the best monument of India. Very beautiful architecture, well maintained by Govt of India. It was the place where you Mughal Jahangir lived. You can imagine the real history visit over there."
250,Tied to the story of the Taj Mahal ...,The fort was really lovely and had so many interesting buildings and palaces to see.  It just kept going on and on with each one a little different than the next.  The views out over the river with the Taj Mahal in the background were great too.
251,Interesting but can only be partially visited,"It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638 when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi.  This site covers 82 acres, of which 20% is open to the public, approximately 16 a 18 acres.  It is constructed of predominately of red sandstone with a small area of white marble, the same as the Taj Mahal."
252,Worth going to ,Interesting visit. Grand design. Despite the haze/fog/smog we saw the Taj in the distance. Magic. Worth the visit! Unesco World Heritage site.
253,A historic place,"I didn‚Äôt expect that the fort is hiding the palace inside, made in the same kind of way as Taj Mahal.And the story is very interesting"
254,definately a place to visit when in Agra,"I did the once in a life time tour of Taj Mahal, with Subash. I wanted it to be special and he delivered on all grounds . No queuing, vip status , and the best pictures , to preserve my memory. Rajesh my chauffeur is the best ! Made me feel like royalty. Highly recommend this , Dr M Dhokia. UK"
255,Beautiful Fort,"An amazing structure, or series of structures, but it does require a knowledgeable guide to understand much of it. For those that love fortresses it is a castle, with still intact defences, crenulations, and guard towers still in place. For those that can only imagine the magnificence of Rome, it is courtyard after courtyard of perfect white marble.We took many pics of the monkeys, parakeets, kites, and chipmunks as of the miles of carved white marble and red sandstone. Particularly emotive is the sight of the Taj in the distance and mist, where the ruler who had built it could see it from his prison. There is also a balcony where bells were once attached to a golden chain that would announce a peasant far below asking for assistance. Personally, I think the peasant would have been happy with a few links of the golden chain.Anyone who comes to Agra and only sees the Taj, has missed a great and important site."
256,Way to Delhi,"Remembrance of Moghalia Sultanate.Takht-e-taoos,Meenabazar, sight of Taj,Deewane aam & Deewane khas etc unveil the historic era. Worth seeing with a Guide, explaining the story associated."
257,Disappointed!,"Better than expected. Considering that you can visit only about 20% of it, it is huge. Plan enough time for the visit: minimum 2 hours"
258,Agra fort - A Majestic structure to re tell history,"It seems that we all visit Agra for the Taj Mahal and that's fair enough but please don't skip the fort. It's a truly amazing building with an equally amazing history. Also, it's absolutely massive and offers great views on the Taj Mahal which is a nice bonus. As for many places in India, I'd recommend getting a guide since you'll be missing out on a lot if you just roam around yourself. Being from Europe, I don't know enough about the history of India and getting that kind of knowledge and insight from a local expert is invaluable and adds so much from the experience."
259,All time Great Fort,"Only a small portion of the grounds are available to visit,and not as much as what is described in guide books because of renovation.Some of the marble buildings are truly beautiful, with other viewpoint across the river to the Taj MahalAvoid crowds, early morning is good but we enjoyed the sunset time for the colours on red sandstone."
260,Splendid architecture and history ,"Like The Baby Taj, Agra Fort was somewhere else that I had thought of dropping due to time but also like the Baby Taj what massive mistake that would have been. From the outside you get the sense of the enormity of the structure with the huge redstone walls, turrets and gates but not the eloquent tranquility, artwork and beauty that lies within the walls.As you walk past the moat that was once filled and infested with crocodiles you go through the huge arched gate and then make your way up a fairly steep path and yet again we felt that we were back on a film set and not actually there. When you reach the top you a greeted with the sight of lovely gardens and beautiful courtyards and a real sense of eloquence and your mind can't help but think of what scenes were played out in the past within these walls. Our guide was again fantastic giving us the history, pointing out the artwork and just bringing the whole thing to even greater life. We walked slowly through the various sections, courtyards and ornate palaces. Everywhere we looked was simply stunning.We then entered another courtyard and at one end was Khas Mahal, which is a beautiful marble pavilion and pool that formed the living quarters of Shah Jahan. From the marble arches you get fantastic framed views of the Taj Mahal which still looked magical and mystical in the misty white light. Close to Khas Mahal is the Mathamman Burj, which is an intricate, ornate and quite stunning white-marble octagonal tower and palace where it is said that Shah Jahan was imprisoned for eight years by his son before his death and from where he could sit and daily gaze out at the Taj Mahal where is wife lay in the tomb of his wife. Our guide had another theory and that was is that Shah Jahan chose to stay in apartment so that he could gaze out from the balcony to the Taj Mahal as he was so struck with grief. He explained that why would his son imprison him in such a luxurious apartment with the perfect view over the Taj and I could understand where he was coming from. We stood for quite a while just soaking up this beautiful palace, balcony and fabulous views of the Taj Mahal in the distance....truly memorable moments.We the explored some more still in awe of everything we were seeing as we had no idea that Agra Fort would be so incredibly impressive and all this eloquent beauty was hidden within the most impressive fortified walls. I could wax lyrically (or not so lyrically haha) for longer about everything we saw and the history but I don't want to get boring so you will just have to go and see it all for yourself.Eventually and yet again reluctantly we made our way to the exit, down the ramps and through the impressive entrance and back out to the streets as hawkers swamped us trying to sell all kind of things whilst shouting only 20 only 20 (everything seemed to be 20 and by 20 they actually mean dollars haha). Within 30 seconds or so and as if by magic Michael Ryaz appeared with the car and we climbed in. Another simply must see in Agra."
261,A must see in Agra!,"Most of the places are closed for public. Waste of time n money. Could be more existing once places like Meena Bazaar, shesh Mahal and others are opened."
262,Allow time for Agra Fort!,"Without a guide to give perspective, this wouldn't be super impressive, with one it moves up a notch. Not strenuous, but it would have been great being a kid growing up here."
263,Our first fort of Rajasthan,"There is so much history here that I didn't know about prior to my tour, and I am very glad this was included as one of our tour stops.There is limited access as some of the Fort is still active with military personnel.  The architecture is fantastic, as I've found with many other sites we visited on our Indian vacation.The views within to the Southeast (I think) provide a distant view of the Taj Mahal."
264,Very well Preserved,Excellent architecture. Easy access from railway station. Tickets can be purchased online in advance. Ample parking.
265,Amazing place,"Wonderful heritage and architectural marvelous but indian govt not taking care of it. Entrance is a mess, lot of beggars and uncontrollable crowd! If only they maintain well ...."
266,Stunning,Agra is just 3hours drive away from Delhi.. we started our journey in the morning and reached the destination soon. The first place we went there was Agra Fort. It was a nice place and really huge. You will find lot of tourists here.
267,A wonderful addition to our itinerary,A small part is open to public and not worth the visit in my opinion. As there is not much to do around Taj Mahal it still is an option.
268,Amazing Agra Fort,This was the first day of my tour of the golden triangle having arrived in Agra at lunch time and spent the afternoon here. To see the size of the site and on a day of beautiful sunshine and a deep blue sky is quite something. We used a guide book and there were good explanations in english at most of the buildings as you wondered around. It certainly captures everything you expect and sets a high standard for the reminder of the tour over the next few days.
269,guided tour,"I loved seeing the fusion of Indian, Arabian, and Asian influences here! And it was all done by hand. It is a do not miss experience- but if you can, get a guide. It really makes the history come alive!"
270,Another fort - ho hum,"Visited this afort the day after the one in Delhi. Nice if you have not been to one before, very similar to Delhi.But remarcable in its construction and being preserved all this time is a challenge.It's well laid out and signposted accordingly.Just beware of the monkeys they can get quite aggressive when they are chasing each other."
271,Interesting Place - The Agra Fort,We only went to Agra for the Taj so we weren't expecting much but we had a good guide at the Agra Fort that shed a new light on the love story behind the Taj and a little into the Moghul dynasty. People have ruined it as they have scratched all over the walls.
272,Amazing place,"Forts in India are actually huge complexes that usually house the royal family in multiple palaces, and are actually like small cities. Agra Fort was considered a walled city, and was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Of particular note is the fact that at the end of his life, Shah Jahan, who built the Taj Mahal, was deposed and restrained by his son, Aurangzeb, in the fort. It is rumoured that Shah Jahan died in Muasamman Burj, a tower with a marble balcony with a view of the Taj Mahal."
273,Nice experience,It's Massive... the only down side was the congested entrance but after that it's well spread out... lots of history is attached ...
274,Nice fort / palace / garden,"This is kind of a place that looks good, but if you have seen forts  before then it's just another fort for you. However, if you have a guide, then he/she will uncover very interesting stories about different parts of the fort - so the place is a good to go if you have a good tour guide."
275,Average ,"The fort dates to 1565 when the foundation stone was laid on the site of the existing ruined fort. It was constructed in red sandstone under the sponsorship of Akbar the Great, the third Mughal emperor who reigned from 1556 to 1605, and was completed in 1573. The marble palaces were later added by Shah Jahan. The complex is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. The walls were impressive as we looked at them from the outside, even the Amar Singh Gate was impressive, but all pales when you enter and view the rich and elaborate architecture of the various palaces and halls within the walls. We had a fabulous tour of the interior, could have spent many more hours here to really appreciate the beauty of the architecture and ornamentation, the gardens, etc. And if that's not enough, there are excellent views to the Taj Mahal. The couple of books that I purchased contain enthralling information on the fort and the Mughal Emperors that resided there. Agra has two of the most historic sites that I have visited, now off to the Taj mahal."
276,Witness of cruel history of Mughal emperors.,Nice place to visit but due to so large area you have at least half day free for the whole area visit ...nice ..
277,Fascinating architecture and history.,"Suggestion- First visit Fatehpur Sikri and travel to Agra. It's possible to complete Fatehpur Sikri and Agra visit in One day. Tajmahal- it's marvel. Don't rush for early morning viewing. 2-3 hrs is perfect. Although I hired a guide, it is not required. Authorised guide is available between 200 to 400, if negotiated well. Entry from both gates is alright. My preference is west side gate. Enjoy the beauty of Taj. If you buying marble items, negotiation is must.Agra fort- must visit place. 2 hrs enough. No need of guide."
278,Good,"good services are given by them plz try it its amazing and fabulous , i recommend for you its amazing"
279,Amazing complex,Seems to be the only other old building that walking near the edge of isn't taking your life in your hands as they are crumbling away. Taj M is the other. Great gardens and fascinating stories of times past.
280,Worth a short visit,"There is nothing better than walking in the laps of glorious history that tells so many tales to enchant and mesmerize you. The fort was built in 16 century by Mughal Emperors Akbar and they kept it their capital till mid 17th century before moving to Delhi. It can be called as walled city and holds a remarkable resemblance to Delhi's Red Fort, which was built by Shah Jahan. It is said that Shah Jahan spent his last years in captivity in this fort having a window in his room that on-looked Taj Mahal, which was most dear thing to him till his last breath. It is very well preserved historical site that is also covered as UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are separate entry ticket rates for Indians and foreign tourists. Also, the fort is heavily guarded by the local police and para-military and you would be checked and frisked twice before actually entering the fort. So, be patient and co-operative. There are several things that you cannot take inside the fort, the list of which is labelled at the gates of fort and on back of ticket as well."
281,Absolut impressive!,We were fortunate to have Mr. Amit as our guide. He was very professional and explained each and everything. When you know the history of the Fort you really enjoy the visit.
282,Dr Ajay Jain,We visited with my family(Wife and 2 kids) on Christmas 2019 and it was excellent to be honest and lived up to expectations.Mughal architecture surely needs to be appreciated and agra fort is well maintained.However agra town as such is not clean and needs improvement . Even the train approach to the railway station is so unclean with lots of garbage.
283,Splendid fort complex,"If you like history then this is a must do. It may cost you ¬£10, but take a guide to show you around. You also have to pay to get in, around ¬£6.50, bit this is helping preserve the history. Some work going on whilst we were there."
284,A UNESCO World Heritage site,Not very nicely kept. Could have been more cleaner. Wish they restored it adequately. Its beautiful but losing it's charm.
285,Pretty good and vast,"We spent a couple of hours wandering around this first, and really enjoyed ourselves. We skipped the offer of being guided and really enjoyed finding our way about and learning (via the lonely planet walking tour) about the fort. It is very well managed, and the site is spectacular, a great visit which we recommend."
286,Amazing Fort with amazing history,"Spend at least a couple of hours and take plenty of water, e ticket in advance really helps. The view across to Taj Mahal is fantastic. Be prepared read up on what to can and cannot take in, anything from food, sweets, cigarettes, or anything like a pen pencil tripod will not be allowed. If on a organised trip you have safe place for the stuff not allowed in. Be prepared and read up"
287,Pretty good,I wouldn't go here for this site alone. Get it in a package with The Taj Mahal. Call ahead to see if it's open as it closes somewhat early.
288,To much to take in,"The best view is from the outside, I was disappointed I paid to go in. Didnt think it was up to much to be fair."
289,Worth a visit.,"More impressive than we had imagined.  After seeing the Taj Mahal the day before, we hadn't expected to be as impressed with the Fort as we were.  Well worth a visit"
290,Fort built for Akbar,"By itself, it might not reach the level of a ""must see"", but if you are looking to fill out the day, going to the fort after the Taj is a nice option."
291,Tajmahal and Agra fort,"We had already visited a number of forts on our tour by the time we got to this one, but the sheer scale and workmanship on display is different and impressive in every single one, so don‚Äôt get into the way of thinking ‚Äòoh, no, another Indian fort‚Äô. Go and admire the work of men without computers etc. who constructed them"
292,Agra Fort - a stronghold in India.,"Well, you simply have to look from the Balcony to the Taj, just like the king did all the time. In itself a splendid piece of architecture, if well explained it gives good insight into the history of the time and the colonial time. mot far away from the Taj, so can be easily reached."
293,Agra's Lal kila,"It was big crowd when I was there... Before your start reading review , IMPORTANT... Counter tickets are advisable , as in online you will not get both the tickets.. huge lines are there for entry and at the ticket counter window. Place is good to go and you may enjoy a lott if with your friends"
294,Great Mogul History üáÆüá≥üëç,"We booked a ticket later in the afternoon when it was cooling down, great decision as it was cooler and we saw the fort at sunset and lit up at night. Fantastic fort but not a quick visit as so vast. Amazing place as incredible architecture and gardens."
295,Very interesting and informative,Not what I was expecting. Only 20% of fort open. Generally in bad repair. Not a lot to see if I was honest. Without the tour guide who had a good knowledge of the fort it would have scored 'terrible'. Can not recommend.
296,Fort,Had visited the Agra for Tajmahal and need to visit Agra fort to spend remaining time after Tajmahal visit.  it is just a normal fort where king/queen leave.
297,A must for the History ,"They're working on it, but that just means they know what they have- too bad the native visitors don't. There is some graffiti, and the authorities are working on fixing and protecting the rest. There are some scalpers selling guided tours; don't be afraid to haggle a bit if you would like some local insight on the history."
298,Another architectural beauty in Agra ,"After you buy the tickets, you‚Äôll have to form in separate lines for men and women. The lines were up to 40 people long, (ladies‚Äô was shorter) but took less than 5 minutes. Security checks are superficial, but no snacks are allowed. I saw people discarding bags of potato chips. All the Red Fort is beautiful, but the white marble section is the best part. The fort is linked to the Taj by a 3 km park, that should be a nice walk, weather permitting, but this was a cold day.  Allow 2 hrs at least to visit the Fort. You‚Äôll have to be patient with the big noisy groups. I wish shouting was forbidden and guides forced to use microphones with earphones."
299,Better to go early in the Morning,"We went early in the morning, as it was still too foggy to go see Taj at sunrise.  This is a massive structure and although not as iconic as the Taj, still worth a visit.  Watch out for the monkeys.  One almost got my cell phone.  Good views of the Taj from the fort (if not foggy) and cool architecture and history."
