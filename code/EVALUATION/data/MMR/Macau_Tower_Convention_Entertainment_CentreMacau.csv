0,nice tower,"Tower offers great view of Macau and a variety of adventurous activities. From the tower's outer rim - the highest sky jumping in the world (233 metres), and the second highest decelerator in the world. Other than that - skywalk is less adventurous, but offers the best assisted photo opportunities."
1,"Amazing, fantastic ",A must visit site in macau. It is a long standing tower which offers spectacular views. The top floor has glass boundary and offers clear view of the city and the sea. It also has different activities like skywalk and bungy jumping.
2,Tallest structure in Macau,"This is a beautiful tower whose observation deck offer spectacular views of the city of Macau.  Although, having visited sky tower in Melbourne before, I had higher expectations, but it still is a good place for a tourist to enjoy the city views from the top."
3,Skyline walking ,The tower is supposed to be the highest in Macau. One can get a lovely view of Macau with its water lines from the tower top. Bungee jump sports is available from the top of the tower. It is worth visiting and taking time out to go up the tower and enjoy the magnificent view.
4,Fascinating,The see through glass floor at the top of the tower offers a unique experience in viewing the several bridges connecting macau and the taipa island.
5,Disappointing ,Macau tower is the tallest structure in Macau allowing you a view from the top and has added attractions like sky walking and bungee jumping (at a steep cost).One good  thing about this place is very fast elevators taking you to the top (56th floor?) though Burj Khalifa lifts are much quicker.Can spend some good time with family with good cafe available and relax.
6,A great place for an evening visit.,The observation deck at Macau provides 360 degree birds eye view of the city. Certain sections of the tower has glass floor which allows you to see the ground below your feet from such height. Perfect spot for adventure seekers as the tower provides bungee jumping and sky-walking. The lower floors of the tower has few places for shopping too. We loved the experience.
7,very quick up and down,"This is a famous and Tallest tower in Macau to experience the amazing view of Macau, HK and China from Top.Charges there to visit on top ~100HKD for tower and about 3500HKD for Bungi. If you are a Bungi lover u must try this.Good view from sea side."
8,Disappointed view ,"From the 233m tower and a 360 degree view, you get to see almost the whole of Macau. There are tickets with different prices for different things. There is a digital binoculars which can allow you to just point and see. You can also see people doing their bungee jump from above. Overall it is a great bird's eye view."
9,Cool place,Macau Tower is rather iconic. Fast speed lifts and several floors on top for observations for dining and for sky related activities. Several lower floors of shops and restaurants. Good for a visit

15,See a Movie Somewhere Else,"A trip to the top of the tower is well worth it, not only for the amazing views of Macau and mainland China, but also of people bungee jumping and sky falling from the top! Theres even a glass platform to walk on which is great."
16,Special Experience,"Macau tower is no different then rest of the towers in the world. With a panoramic view of the old city on one side and of the new city on the other, it gives you a clear vision of the ocean with lots of ferrys transferring. The observation desk offers  a coffee shop where you can take coffee and sit back relax while enjoying the view. The best part of the tower is it has the highest bungy point of the world.

That's all for the Tower."
23,Macau's best view,The best place to have panoramic view of Macau from both levels. Sky walk is thrilling and exciting  Bungi jumping is added attraction
24,Do you like heights?,Have to go to the top and enjoy the amazing view of Macau from the top floor. They have a lot of activities like bungeejumping and sky walk over there. I would recommend to go in the night to see the beautiful city of Macau with all its lights.
25,Mr,1 of the tourist spot a huge tower where u can have marvellous view of the Macau island. Different activities like sky walk sky jump though its safe but too expensive. It has got shopping mall with different international brands but once again its expensive. At the top there were transparent material fitted with which we can see through below right from the Tower that's quite scary to some but was really fun. A New observation out of many towers seen.
26,Spectacular view of Macau from Day to Night,Macau tower is just like rest of the towers in the world with a panoramic view of the old city on one side and of the new city on the other. Its right on the ocean side with lots of ferrys moving around. The observation desk has a coffee shop where you can take coffee and sit back relax while enjoying the view.

29,Will come back!,You can have some panoramic view of  Macau from both levels . Sky walk Bungi Jump Tower climbing are marvelous attractions
30,Boring place,"The Macau Tower is a spectacular place to view the Macau area, and over onto Mainland China, across the Pearl River.   We went up to the top, and had lunch, and during the meal the restaurant rotated, making it possible to look out over all of Macau at one time or another.   During the time we were there we saw people zip-lining down the side, and then later outside we saw the same thing.   The lunch was great, with a multitude of choices.  At the bottom level entry there is access to a number of up-market shops and also souvenir shops.   Well worth the visit."

There are glass floors to stand on and see straight down 80 stories. More adventurous people can bungee or do a walk outside via a harness on a rail-less ledge. Great views and it's quite inexpesive to go up.
37,Go on I dare you!!,The glass view itself is very scary for people afraid of heights. Spectacular views and offers a walk on the outside.
38,One stop for thrilling adventures,"This tour attraction is good for visiting! In the 58/F Zone you can see both Macau SAR and Zhuhai city. In the 61/F zone you can see the view more amazing .

48,"It would be a great view, without pollution","What makes Macau Tower unique is its location on the edge of the Praia Grande, the Skywalk, the AJ Hackett bungy jump and the Tower climb. You have to have a deep pocket or credit card and a big heart to do one of the above activities. Alternatively, you could get your heart racing by walking on the transparent glass floor on the observation deck floor. We were fortunate to have gone quite early in the morning and there weren't that many people there yet so we spent as much time as we wanted there. Having been to similar structures in Toronto, Auckland, Gold Coast and Melbourne, I rate this one pretty highly thanks to its view."

Apart from bungy, you can also try skywalk tour in case you don't want to jump but still want the thrill of the tower height.In case both of the options are too scary like it was for me, the observation deck of the Macau tower also has glass floors at few places so that you can enjoy direct view below and feel the scary height.Apart from the tower, the convention cente has regular stops as a mall with few eateries and stores to shop so don't miss this place on your Macau visit"

59,Macau Tower,"I highly recommend Macau Tower, it is absolutely a great place to visit with stunning views! Avoid weekends when it is really crowded. It can be fun to watch the bungee jumpers jump off the tower. Overall worth the price of admission!"
60,Must do when in Macau,skywalk experience is just amazing !you can walk at height of 230 metres with a breathtaking view of old macau and new macau ( cotai area) .i would surely recommend however i feel bungy jumping price is too high
61,Really a must see in Macau!,"Best place for a higher than birds-eye view of Macau. Adrenaline junkies can also skywalk or bungee jump, but not me though. Enough for me to see the sights. There's a restaurant and you can get snacks at the viewdeck too."
62,Amazing views and food ,"Although there are more stunning views in Asia, this is the best you'll have in Macau.With a two-story viewpoint one of them discovered you can see the entire extension of Macau and its islands full of resorts and casinos at 360 degrees.

65,Must visit,This is a typical tourist attraction to go to if in Macau however it is worth the view and they have thrilling activities to do. We did the sky walk as we were to scared to do the bungee jump.Overall experience and views were so amazing!
66,A 360 view of Macau ,Wonderful view from this tower with its glass floor.If in the area it is well worth to time.One can understand the lay out of the city.
67,The view,"Not much to say. An observation deck is an observation deck. The Macau tower does have some interesting views from all sides. The glass panels in the floor are always fun to walk on. There is the ""outside"" deck too a few levels up too."

71,Highest bungy in the world,Visited here as a 'must see in Macau' very touristy- and very much like any other tower and observation deck anywhere else in the world. Still good to see. The view is beautiful and really helps you understand the layout of Macau. I would recommend a visit if you have not been to Macau before.
72,Bird’s view of Macau ,"Have you ever gone to the Macau Tower? There is a 360 buffet restaurant where you can see the whole view of Macau, that is gorgeous. The afternoon set is delicious. The salmon with black truffles is very nice. And the waiters are very friendly. The most important thing is that you can see the whole view of Macau or people bungee jumping! But it is a bit expensive. However, if you want a cheaper option, you may want to choose Cafe on Four, on the forth floor in Macau Tower as well. The most delicious thing in the cafe on Four is the coffee ice-cream. Is not too bitter and not too sweet, and kids will love it too. You can also enjoy your lunch there.  After finishing your lunch, you might want to watch a movie, so you can enjoy your film with tasty snacks like popcorn on the same floor as Cafe on Four. Wish you have a great day visiting Macau Tower!  If you have a kid, we recommend you to go to Toys R’us on the second floor; it’s very big with many special things to see, so we recommend you to go to Macau Tower."

80,World’s Tallest Bungee Jump:: Would you dare to fall? ,I have spent a wonderful evening in this famous tourist spot of Macau. I stayed at the top of the tower from 7 to 8 pm witnessing the spectacular view of day turning into night. There is a variety of exciting rides at the top but they were too much for me. The tour was finished with a very tasty Portuguese buffet dinner downstairs. You shouldn’t miss this location in visiting Macau.

82,Lovely,"you get a 360 view of not only Macau but Zhuhai China too. lots of activities here, bungee, sky jump, sky walk, etc. Plus you can have tea or a meal with a view."

87,A must see place in Macau!!!,"It’s a must go to place in Macau. Apart from being an important landmark in the city it offers wide verities of activities such as highest bungee jumping in the world, Sky walk and tower climb. Most of the tourists are attracted to this; however the tower is not just this. It also has nice restaurants, shopping mall, theater and cafes. Most famous of all being a revolving restaurants with 360 view.  You can enjoy exquisite meal along with the grand view of entire city."
88,Worth the visit ,"Very nice to see this tower. Lot’s of adventures sports are there. You can do sky walk and bungee jumping. There is also observation desk , from where you can see whole Macau."
89,Magnificent view,Little pricey but worth to watch as this is one of the attractions in macau. On a cowar day the view is wonderful
90,Nice but expensive attraction ,"An amazing must visit Tower. AJ Hackett organised activities like Skywalk, Tower climb and bungee jumping. Skywalk was as close as I could get to affordability, costing me 5000 rupees. Got to walk around the railless outer walk path and catch a view of China and Macau."
91,No transportation after fireworks,The Macau tower is an attraction and the ride of elevator was excellent even with height of top floor reaching was not giving any bad feels.The Tower also offers bugy jump and skywalk
92,Good enough,"Great scenery of Macau while on the top,breath taking as it's glass floor,you can see the whole Macau,its a good experience though."
93,Amazing experience ,It was a good experience to visit top of the tower in the evening so that you can have view of entire city with flash of lights...
94,Revolving Restaurant,"Tower from where you can see Macau 360 we had lunch at the rotating restaurant which was amazing activities like Bungy Jumping, Sky Walk, tower climbing are a famous sport"
95,Nice view something for the evening!,We enjoyed the 360 degree view of Macau city. Walked around inside the tower on glass surface but didn’t have the nerve to try out the bungee jumping or the skywalk in the open .
96,"As observations decks go, this one is pretty good",Macau tower is probably the safest jump I have down thus far. The tower is 233 meter higher. You drop securely in between harness. It’s not a free jump like Victoria falls at 111 meters or Bloukrans Bridge in Cape Town at 216 meters.As it’s a Tower not a bridge jump. If you want the hight factor then it’s the jump for you. If you seeking heart pumping adrenaline then perhaps seek a bridge jump. I enjoyed the jump.
97,Cool view,Macau tower is excellent worth to visit if you plan to visit Macau you should plan your visit to Macau tower. Activity are expensive so can plan as per your budget. In night you can have a very good view all over Macau and china
98,Must visit when in Macau,"Macau Tower is the 2nd Tower after Bhurj Khalifa which i went to. Though it is not high as Burj Khalifa, Macau Tower is fascinating because of its bungee jumping facility, walking outside the tower and view of Macau."
99,Action,"we visited 58 & 61 floor alternately , excellent view of macau & opposite across river china area , lift for going up was too fast , we reach on 61 floor in hardly less than 1 min"
100,Things to do in Macau,"Visitors can see this tower from many parts of the city, and although we did not visit it we enjoyed viewing it from afar. I believe that there is bungy jumping here as well as entertainment, shops and restaurants. It took 3 years to build and opened up in 2001 with a height of 338 m."
101,Great Views,We happily watched the 360 views of Macau from 60th floor. You can also bungee jump and sky walk if you are a thrill seeker.
102,Spectacular view and feel,"Great views and interior design. Excellent view of Macau. What makes it such a special place is the fact you have 360 degree views of the city. Nowhere in the city provides views of it all, in the way the Macau Tower Convention & Entertainment Centre does."
103,Crazy!,A breath taking view of the whole Macau! Best to visit it just before sun set to wee Macau at day and see the Casino lights at night!
104,Just a regular tall building,"We were expecting a clear amazing view from the highest point in Macau, yet it was 9pm after a rainy day, there is no open air platform. The glass was very dirty and inconvenient for photography.We paid around 20 USD for each person  but we had no clear view, nor clear shots."
105,Not a place to be missed,"This is 1 of a tourist attraction in Macau if you are not in to Gambling and going for Branded Shopping... It is almost same as Sky Tower in Auckland, New Zealand. Entry fees to this place are MOP 135 and Kids and Senior Citizens has MOP 70... They take you to 55 floor which has an Observation Deck where in you can see the Macau in 360 degrees along with you can also do some Thrilling Activities like Bungee Jumping which costs you around HK $ 3488... SkyJump is HK $ 2588... Tower Climb is KH $ 2288... Skywalk is for HK & 788...  There is nothing extra to be done at this place... and if you like to have food than there are some Restuarant's where in you can have some nice food"
106,Awesome,Various exciting activities such as bungy jump and skyview are available here. Great view and visitors will be able to watch adventurers while they do their jumps.
107,Great view and we enjoy watching people bungy jump. ,The VIP SkyHigh Experience takes you up to the observation deck in a high speed exclusive elevator and includes snacks n tea at the 180° cafe & a gold pass telescope access to take in city views. The observation deck provides views of the Macao harbour and the city. There are bungee jumping and open deck walking as activities as well. Must visit if in Macao.
108,MEMORABLE MACAU,"A must for anyone that wants a view over Macau.If you are going on the open top bus tour around Macau, buy your tickets on the bus, they are cheaper than in the tower.One negative is the glass for photos. The shape causes reflections and images and waves, along with the color adding a green shade."
109,A place for the relaxer,"A place full of adventure for adventure lovers. Just beside the sea which looks dark yellow here, a contrast from hong kong where it is blue... the tower is a man made marvel standing tall on the reclaimed area of the Macao island. Bungee jumping is the most adventurous part of this visit. Want some adrenaline flush, do it. Nice place with a restaurant at the basement accepting HKD and MKP both. Must go place"
110,Beautiful place,If you like thrill of bungee jumping do visit Macau Tower..charges for entry are around 100HKD and for jumping 3500HKD. View is good. Instead of going up if you go to sea side you can see the bungee jumping better from lower view.
111,Nice,"This is a inexpensive visit you must do! What an amazing view of the city. You can go to the to floor and bungee jump off! We watched someone do it, I decided I would pass on the heart attack!We went during the day, it was very hot and humid.  I would imagine the view at night is better and cooler. I did not try the restaurant, looked like the food would have been good."
112,Nice I love the view ,"A great experience to have a view of Macau. It only cost us MOP 135 each person, for access to the indoor (58th. fl.) and outdoor (60th. fl.) area. And....you could see a breathtaking view of Macau bay area. They also offered outdoor activities such as budgee jumping from the top fl of the tower. Found some cool t-shirt from their souvenir shop. The price is reasonable with the product quality and unique design."
113,Nice but nothing special compare to other towers,Have been there once with family and had amazing experience and great view from there. You can dive from the top of the floor.
114,Good experience ,"You just cannot beat the view from the top of the tower. We also happened to have our rewards night in the convention center of the tower. Overall, unbeatable experience. And yes, you also can try your hand on bungy jumping as well as skywalk outside..."
115,tower of adventure,"Excellent view of city. Must visit place especially during evening when the city is lightened. There are other activities like skywalk,  bungee jumping can be opted."
116,Amazing Elevator Speed,A must see attraction if you want to see the whole landscape of Macau. Weather permitting of course!
117,Highest tower in Macau,Had our buffet lunch and enjoy the afternoon with the spectacular Aerial view of Macau.Its a different feeling here for sure
118,Amazing Views good trip,Worth a trip to the observation deck to take in the view of Macau. We received a discount of 10% off the tickets because we were members of the local HK bank.
119,macau sidetrip,"The Macau Tower Convention and Entertainment Centre offered some cool activities for those who had hundreds of dollars to burn, such as tower climb and bungy jumps.  We just settled for the observation tower which would’ve offered some good views if there was ever a day with good visibility.  Even with the haze, most of the Macau Peninsula was visible along with Zhuhai city on the Chinese side."
120,Proud experience,"What was memorable in this visit was when on the top floor, and having a good view of metro Macao, one's fear of heights can turn into fun. For while having a good view, a glance at the glass floor underneath can provoke fright that one might fall down. ha,ha,ha. So, a good advice is to keep looking at the view and not to attempt to look down.It was fun!"
121,Free food was simply ridiculous,"Expensive but worth visiting, better to combine towel entry with restaurant reservation. The 360° view is awesome, but the expensive bungy jumping is not recommended."
122,Good view ,Was on business event in Macao Tower.Food was nice but the most incredible is view. Highly recommend to everyone who is not afraid high views and good terraces.
123,Skywalk in Macau,"The place is clean and a exciting place for everyone , the view from top 61st floor is mesmerizing as you see Macau at one side and mainland China on the other side . Other exciting part is you see people getting ready and doing bungee jumping as they mention it it's worlds highest bungee jumping location."
124,Sky walk and Bunjee,Worth a visit to The Macau Tower.  If your brave enough do the bungee jump or the skywalk not for the faint hearted.  I just sat on the glass floor and looked down that was enough.  From the viewing deck you can see people doing the skywalk and the bungee jump.  Bus stops right outside and there is a cafe to eat.  Viewing of the area is good as long as there is good visibility on the day you go.
125,macau tower,"With the most amazing views of the city from here, you are ought to get once in a lifetime experience. SO many adventure activities to take part in, from Skywalk, to bungee jumping, etc one can surely skip a heartbeat here."
126,Outstanding ,"The view from the observation deck was pretty amazing! Walking on the portions with the glass flooring can be nerve-wracking but once you get used to the dizzying heights, you will surely appreciate the breathtaking Macau skyline. This is truly a wonderful experience that you must not miss when you visit Macau."
127,Would be okay if visibility was good,"The tower has on a normal day an easy access and is not really crowded. We went there to jump from the tower and it was not really special. It was (07.18) 145 MOP for the ticket and the ride with the elevator was fun. On top is the view amazing you are able to see the whole city. I had just one day in Macau, thats why I couldn't stay till the evening. I guess it's pretty, enjoy your day there!"
128,Visit to Macau Tower,Nice place..you can try adventure sports like sky walk and bungie jumping.The place has great view with china ta one side and macao at one side.The view is nice particularly at night with all the lightings .
129,Picture picture,"What an incredible view and experience during my adventures in Macau! Tower 60 and having a meal on the deck where you can see people bungie jumping from the top as they fall was an added bonus of enjoyment.  If you're visiting Macau, you must check out the Tower!"
130,Worth a visit,They offer bungee jumping and Skywalk that both offer as additional frills to the regular deck visit.
131,A great spot to see the entire Macau landscape,Pick a clear day to do it to benefit from views of the 3 main bridges. Its expensive for what is basically a ride in the lift. There are 2 viewing platforms and you can get coffee at the small stall. For more money you can visit the resteraunt or do one of the adrenalinefun things to do
132,Adventure seeker ,Visit the 62nd floor and what a view. Look out on to the city. Try the sky walk or bungee jumping if you dare!!Shops and eateries on the ground floor along with rest rooms.
133,Thrilling Options,"The view from the top of the tower is great. It's not free though, so check the prices before you come and consider pre booking the access ticket. Once you're up on the sky deck there's a bar and restaurant, glass floors, great views across Macau, and the Hackett Area for their bungee/skyjump/tower walk experiences. These are all very expensive, so look out for some online deals first. But, the sky jump was an incredible feeling and I'd recommend it if it's on offer. Overall, apart from gift shops and food, there's not much in the tower for tourists to spend time with other than admiring the view. Recommended as part of a day trip to Macau, but it won't take up your whole day."
134,Exciting height,Good and well maintained standards as compare to others towers. Well priced and worth to have visit when you are in macau.
135,Best place for an official convention !!,this was probably most well organized and quick ascend/descend at a tower ever across the world. wonderful views at both Macau and China. loved watching people walking on edge and getting ready to jump off. friendly staff
136,Fabulous view,"This is truly a great view and photo opportunity when visiting Macau, we did not eat , but went as part of tour. It was a great way to end the tour, at the top of Macau!"
137,Great Views,"Must visit in Macau.Go their by late afternoon before the sunset. As you can see both the day and the night views. Once you are inside their is no time limit and you can sit inside have have snacks and drinks. They have two floors to visit 58 & 61. 58th floor has glass floorings and you see down while walking over it..On 62th their is activities like sky walking. Bungee jumping and tower climbing. All expensive, but good experience if you have xtra cash to spare from your holiday budget. Overall gr8 place to hangout ."
138,Pricey ,Tower was fun and did not try the Bunzy Jumping. Place has all the designers clothing and accessories on the lower floor. It would have been more fun if the clouds were replaced by sun.
139,Adventure ,"I am afraid of heights but Macau Tower is a must see when you go to macau. I bought the ticket online via klook.com around almost 200k (IDR) per person but they have senior citizen (more than 65years old) price which is cheaper and children fare. When i enter the tower just go straight to the ticket counter to exchange the online ticket. Go to the lift to 61 floors. The view was amazing, you can do bungy jumping but too expensive for me hahha around 6million (IDR), sky walking cheaper around 1,3 million (IDR), or you want to climb the ladder up to highest part of the tower. I didn't do all of them. I just explore around which is enough for me, especially the glass bottom. You can take picture and see the road from 233 meters. So excited"
140,Good views from above,Worth a trip to the top if there is no fog. The views are amazing and you can see for miles. If you are brave enough you can jump off (or get pushed 😳) or do a walk outside while tethered to the tower!!! For those who have a fear of heights (as I do) it's not so bad as long as you don't get to close to the windows and sure to face the back wall of the elevator on the way up 😳
141,Amazing View and worth a breath,"Great view from here and gives you good perspective of the island. For the brave of heart, not me, you can bungee jump a meer 233 meters :)"
142,Not for the faint hearted,"Grand view must visit this place small glass walking place awesome city view,very too much cost bungy jump cost 500$ us dollars spend."
143,Good views of Macau,"Had the best buffet lunch, excellent choices with amazing 360 views from 60th floor. You can bungee jump too! Great staff, recommend a visit"
144,Amazing views,"Since we are doing the day trip in Macau, we wanted to visit this viewing tower to have a good view of the Macau city. However when we reached there, suddenly it became foggy and so we do not want to spend the money up. The tower price is not so cheap and there are selling quite a lot of souvenirs. Spend some time there and the next visit I will definitely want to try the sky walk or bungy jump."
145,Worth a visit,"For the best spot for a view across Macau and into China, what better place to pick than the Macau Tower.Whiled thrill seekers can walk outside on the tower top or bungy-jump courtesy of that free spirit that is AJ Hackett, the rest of us can simply take in the spectacular views.A must see."
146,360 of macau,Had a wonderful evening at Macao Tower. Me and my husband took skywalk.Location nearby Cotai area.Can get restaurants.Nice view in the evening as can see Hong Kong and all islands nearby with 360’ view.After 8 no shuttle service. Need to wait for cab or public bus. Had a hard time waiting for bus as drivers are not friendly.
147,Great views on a good day,"My husband and I put the Macau tower on our list of things to do in Macau hearing the view was spectacular. The view did not disappoint. My husband, in his early 60's, was very caught up with the bungy operation and ended up talking with Toad, the man in charge! My husband decided to do the jump and was given the VIP treatment by Toad and his crew. The jump experience was amazing and something he will talk about for a very long time. He has a video and pictures of his jump.The historic atttractions in Macau were nice but can be done in a day. The casinos are beautiful and actually smoke free:)Our only trouble in Zhuhai was a ""taxi"" ride. Regular taxi lines are long. Private drivers will approach you. Three out of 4 private rides worked out for us. One was a disaster. We were quoted a ride for 100 rmb but once in the cab the driver demanded $100USD. After much stress we arrived at hotel, I took a picture of his license and him and reported him to our Marriott concierge and the matter was handled. Grateful."
148,We went there during the fog,"Surprisingly we were thrilled by the experience! You can see the whole Macau, you can see people jumping off the tower (bungee jumping) just outside the window! Same goes to the skywalkers around the top! The 180degree Lounge was awesome too! Especially for people who would like to sit around having lunch or hi-tea, the food was amazing, the milk tea was perfect, the ambience was fulfilling. I'd definitely recommend you to buy a VIP pass to get complimentary hi-tea session at the lounge!"
149,"Must go, signature in Macau",Other than bungee jumping this tower does not have too much to offer. There is one Toys R Us store other than that not much to do.
150,What a view!,"I think if you are in Macau this is something you should go do, amazing views of the city. The city is larger than I would have thought from above, from below feels very small. I think it would be neat to go at night I was only during the day.."
151,Sky walk - WOW !,Ok not much except the tower to climb and see a view..but the tower is quite expensive so did not climb. But nothing very special that one will miss. It has mainly shopping centers
152,"Amazing views, exciting!!! ","Had dinner in Tromba Rija and its amazing, hope to try the skywalk next visit and bungyjump. The only thing is shuttle buses are not too convenient from other hotels"
153,I love sky walk!!,"At the end of my two weeks visiting Macau, I visited the Macau Tower, both upper observation decks, in late afternoon.  I had not realized that this is one of the world's tallest free-standing towers!  Wonderful for gaining a perspective of all I had seen, it was a ""living map"" of the three islands (Macau, Taipa, and Coloane), the University of Macau (where i had been staying), plus mainland China (Zhuhai) and a glimpse of other islands in the distance (I couldn't see Hong Kong,  though I'm told that it is sometimes visible).  Spectacular views, and I took lots of photos!   I loved seeing the beautiful Portuguese mansions lining the shore.  While I did not bungee-jump, I heard the excited screams of viewers watching those who did.   The place was clean and orderly. . . .  a happy experience and a cool respite from the outdoor heat.  I plan to go again on my next visit to Macau, and next time I'll take the Skywalk! There are lots of shops and restaurants at street level and below, plus art galleries (I enjoyed an exhibit of beautiful watercolors by a Macanese artist).  My schedule didn't allow time for shopping, though I appreciated the chance to have a light snack in a comfortable environment. Highly appreciated was the concierge staff!   I had a few transportation problems, and one of the wonderful agents on duty went out of his way to help me and solve the problem, which took over 30 minutes.   Four stars for him!"
154,Macau Tower... Mesmerizing view from both levels,"My wife and I took the trip to the top of the Macau Tower...inside only. You get great views of Macau and you can watch people ledge walk and take selfies and if you're lucky, get a video of someone bungy jumping. Lots of room but few places to sit, relax or get a cold drink...but still worth the trip up. Found a nice restaurant on the lower floor."
155,Lovely view,Greaat view love the rooftop restaurant too and the food there ... much better to visit at night when everything is lit up.For food and travel updates daily follow @ foodieandmoody on instagram thank you.
156,year end trip,Lovely visit !!! They also organise Macao jump which is around 233 metres which managed fairly well by group of individuals!! Service was awesome
157,Go there to experience adventure,There is nothing to look around! All the sight seeing attractions are costy. And it is quite far from other tourists attraction. It is a waste of time to visit this place.
158,Perfect,Excellent view at 60 floors high! The elevator is so fast. Haha! We went to the observation deck after our tea time at the 360 Cafe. Just in time for sunset. We also stayed for a while so we could see the view at night. I guess it's the best time to go there. Commuting to Macau Tower is not hard. There are a lot of buses and shuttles that pass by here.
159,Must Visit,"A tower packed with activities for adrenaline junkies. The views are good, but I would come here again only without little kids to make use of the activities (sky walk, sky jump, bungee jump). Overall it reminds me of the Skytower in Auckland."
160,Good View in Night,The tower are not for the faint hearted and those who have fear of heights. For you to enjoy the panoramic view of Macau and you can even see Hong Kong and China up there you will go to the 61st floor. There’s an indoor viewing deck with crystal floors you can walk and the streets are very visible. So if you have fear of heights you will not enjoy it but you can still try the experience and conquer your fear. The windows are glass so you will have a clear view of the place. It was almost sunset when we were there so I really enjoyed it since I love watching the sunset. It’s like younare very near the sun up there so it was all so big and reddish so beautiful. We also went to the outdoor viewing deck where you could those who are sky walking and bunjee jumping. It was an experience worth trying.
161,Amazing Buffet and scenery,"We went to the Macau Tower straight to the bunging jumping but stopped at the ticket entrance to see the tickets for 6,400.00($990.00 dollars for 2 minutes jumping). As you can imagine the line was empty. My son decided not to jumping because of the money instead we choose a great panoramic views of the city. There are a Mall with International Brand name Stores, a Small Casino and restaurants, We took the jet early ( 6:45 pm) (189.00 about $28.00 dollars) back to Hong Kong because we weren't interested in Gambling."
162,Not for the faint hearted ,"There's not much shops around inside Macau Tower. Unless you are an adventure seeker, you can do the bungee jump there."
163,Top of the world,We got a good discount on Klook for the admission and thoroughly enjoyed the visit.The views from 61st floor were fabulous and it was quite scary to see the folks walking out on the deck.it was even more scary to see people falling from the sky taking the bungee jump. But these are activities you shouldnt miss here.Don't miss the 58th floor's glass floor. We Almost missed this and stumbled on it while heading back down from 61st. The glass floor gave nearly the same thrill as looking down from the 61st floor.
164,Worth it for the views!,"This is the only place we liked in our Macau's sight seeing.Worth a visit compared to the rest. For the folks who prefer Adventure activities like Sky walk and Bungee jumping, this is the place, quite expensive though. Stay away if you are fear to heights."
165,Absolutely stunning.,Great wiev of Macau fast elevator 61 floor up in the sky.. bungyjump if you like.. best too see in night..
166,Bubgee jump is awesome,The ticket price is reasonable and staffs is helpful. You can join some interesting activity there. Public transportation is convenience.
167,Beautiful ,"Completely unexpected highlight of our trip to Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macau. The second tallest tower worldwide, the first being in Dubai, the elevator travel to the top took mere seconds and yet there is no sense of rising quickly. The buffet is exquisite, and none of the waitstaff rushed anyone. The windows were ceiling to floor with uninterrupted views of this very modern and safe city. An added bonus -- some people thought -- was that individual people were bungee-jumping from a couple of floors above right past our table as we ate. These dare devils have all the nerve, and upon landing they received a momento tee-shirt saying they survived the jump. I am not that adventurous but have great memories that will last a lifetime."
168,Eat and enjoy the views!,A little less extreme but the adrenaline rush is real at Macau tower glass walk.  We booked an adventure at Klook where we got on the observatory tower of macau tower and on the higjest floor we got to walk on glass floor.  It was scary.  The sky walkers and bungee jumpers outside the tower can also be watched while inside.
169,Dont miss this!!!,"We had a dinner at the 360 buffet which is rotating and overlooking the entire city. The food is good and a lot of variety. You can also do the worlds highest Bungee jump and a lot to do here like shopping, cinema and small restaurant. Its like one stop shop."
170,"Must DO, Won't Regret Going!!!",I visited  Macau in 2016.  January  we left Hong Kong to Macau but being built from the sea. I loved the casino and stores  absolutely  breath  taking. It is extremely  beautiful. Please visit when ever you visit  Hong Kong
171,Fabulous,"A great day out walking around the city exploring all the casinos and crazy Chinese tourists, But this ""worlds highest bungee jump came up short on my budget costing almost $600!! For a 30 second thrill.Good was expensive, traveling to and from is taxi only which again they know your a tourist so they hike up the price..Wouldn't go again!!"
172,Awesome views of Macau at night,Lunch or dinner at revolving restaurant with a few Indian specialty items is a good experience. On 4th deck you can find Indian restaurant and at ground floor one Spanish restaurant is also very good
173,Great glace to get an overviw of the territory,We booked a high tea experience in the revolving restaurant at the top of the tower. it was a great experience enjoying some great food with great views of Macau.
174,Excellent views,Anybody having plans to do a skywalk or bungee jumping can visit this place to get an exquisite experience.
175,One of my bucket list checked,Macau tower is in one of the main location for the adventure lovers. Please plan and book before you go. Unfortunately we couldn’t try we were out of time.
176,A nice view at an affordable price,Magnificent structure . Well plan and one can lot of exciting activities like bungee jumping to skywalk or just enjoy beauty of Macau city .
177,Delicious food,"Opted for the included Telescope & lunch buffet price. Great value for money spent.From the observation deck, fantastic way of viewing the whole of Macau including bridges & other areas outside the centre. Watched people doing bungy jumping."
178,Gambling with the heights of China,Excellent place to visit. Amazing views! You can see a little bit more of this interesting city. Worth it.
179,"Glass bottom scene, the height is excited ",great stop ...the observation deck at the 57th floor which has a portion of glass bottom was good ... the 65th floor where one can take skywalks and bungee jump was an adrenaline rush ...not for the faint hearted... the view was great ...must visit
180,Worth it just for the view,Macau Tower made my acrophia worth the try..We dine in 180°degrees restaurant and the chocolate ganache bar is hotel qualified in taste.Good customer service.Sky rocketted souvenir picture photo though
181,good place to view over Macau,"Always look and feel a new place at a different perspective and enjoy the experience. For the adventurous brave hearts they can go for Bungee jump, Sky jump, Tower climb or Skywalk, or all... for those like me, the non-adventurous, can just walk around the Tower for the 360 degree view. Not forgetting, look downwards, the windows which can see through all the way to ground floor. At the same time can see other people who do the bungee jump and skywalk.. We there took pictures in all kind of crazy poise, lean on the railing, sit or lie on the glass floor.Probably due to safety reasons, glass panels usually are tinted and thick which hinder the nice view. Pictures appear to be greenish and slightly blur.. it will be great if we can have a clearly “transparent” view. Travelers can consider buying a package ticket which include light meal and drink at the cafe on the tower. We missed it as we had just taken our lunch at cafe at level 4 when we buy tickets at the counter."
182,Awesome views,We went there for lunch. Very exiting panoramic view and good food court.The traditional food and the returning restaurant were very nice.
183,Only go if you want to do the jump! ,"The views from up there are stunning. We went just before sunset so we got to enjoy daylight, getting dark and nighttime. Great 360* design and the glass walkways inside the building (allowing you to see how high up you are). Awesome activities that can also be done from the top. Must visit, you won't regret it."
184,360 view of Macau,When you can see the whole city beneath you it surely gives you chills. You have to visit Macau tower if you ever plan to go there.
185,Fun,Macau is good develop country with lot of casinos. Macau is one of my bucket list country I visited this year.
186,"Macao tower, this can be seen from Hong Kong as well","We were visiting Macau in October and decided to have lunch at the revolving restaurant at the top, delicious food great selection would highly recommend."
187,Scenic tower,"Macau Tower stands out at the bay with no pretense. It is another ""thing-to-do"" place created with bells and whistles for those who are not into casinos  and historic walks. The 360 view is impressive but hard to compare with those in the big cities. The variety of top level activities like buggy jump, sky drop and sky walk looked safe and the participants seemed most happy with the thrill. It would be fun to attempt together as a group but they must prepare to pay. Pretty costly."
188,Nice view of the city,"Had a really enjoyable experience starting with the ride up as  the elevator rises and the ground falls beneath you. The attractions outside not for the elderly or faint hearted,  but offers thrills nonetheless to the spectator. Also enjoyed international buffet lunch at the revolving restaurant. You meet all sorts of people and nationalities visiting this iconic landmark. Budget at least half a day for your visit to enjoy all the sights and attractions."
189,"Must see and must bungy!,,,,,",Had been here on a clear & bright day. Mesmerizing views of the city in 360 degree. Amazing tower which offers skywalk & bungee jumping too.
190,Breathtaking!,Last stop on our bus rides - paid to go to viewing platform  Foggy day so not such great views as they could have been.  Went up to the Outside viewing deck (where the bungy and skywalks happen).Casino shuttles pick up from here so use them to get where you want (eg City of Dreams / Studio City etc)
191,Great Experience,"It is the highest bungee jump of the world! Very well organized! Besides that, you just look around..."
192,Wonderful views,Been to many skyscrapers around the world but this one is little disappointing. It's was like Macau doesn't have any attractions like a good skyscrapers so they made this . The view for up their is also not that great. Save your money for Macau Paris and studio City view avoid this.
193,Nice view. Sky fall is recommended. 360 degree restaurant good,You  get a perspective of the development the casino taxes have been funding.   Not the highest but worth a visit
194,Nice view. ,"Macau Tower is a great place who loves heights, unfortunately I’m not. me, my friend and her bf went there around 20:00, a little bit late already. It seems we just stayed at the top for 5minutes, so for me I didn’t enjoy the view that much.. next time, we’ll be back and we’ll make it earlier. For price per se, it’s worth it."
195,Good View Of The City And A Great Experience,"We had a great time at the Macau Tower!  Awesome views but the best thing for us was watching people bungy jumping straight past the window we were looking out of!  Wow!!!  Also, walking along the glass walkway up so high was a highlight for our kids!"
196,Best view of macua,You have to get to the top of this tower. We went to the top 2 floors where you can get a full 360 views of Macau and China. Awesome!!! You can bungee jump off the tower or do a sky walk around if you want to brave being outside at such heights.
197,Fun Visit in the Highest tower in Macao,"Reaching here is easy but there is nothing much to do apart from looking at a beautiful scenic beauty of the sea and a bungy jumping spot, which is quite costly. It has the highest bungy jumping spot.  Going upto the tower has some extra charges."
198,Nathan,The view from the top was amazing. I enjoy things like this so had to do it. The glass floor was a lovely extra and a good sized one. Watching people do the activités like bungee jumping off was also an added bonus
199,For First timer it's a must ,"We only looked around the Street level and the lower level.We decided not to pay to go up to the Observation Deck, nor did we choose to partake in the daring bungee drop or other pay to play activities."
200,Macau trip,"Love the view excellent even though its raining I can still see good view, it’s not too high but still me and my husband enjoyed. This is one of the attractions you should see in Macau 👍🏼"
201,Amazing place and an amazing view,We were very disappointed when we reched o Macau Tower.it is look like a simple tome if there is no transparent glads path to look down ... totally useless. Only bunzy jumping was good but the cost of bunzy jumping was very high .... everyone can't afford the price .
202,Good Place,"It was a great experience!A glass elevator takes you to the top in few seconds. There is usually a queue to go up.I would suggest reserving a time beforehand would save a lot of time.  They have a revolving cafe on top, Cafe 360. It offers buffet all day and they serve 360 dishes, yes Three Sixty! So you have a lot to choose from and a table that revolves around city on one side and food on the other.If you are the adventurous kind, you have an option to bungee jump from the top. I forgot but it's one of the highest bungee jump spot. They give you a Guinness certificate for that. and it happens during the night too."
203,Leisure,amazing height and well done job.one only wonders as to why the sky walk and bunjee jumping is so very expensive.
204,Good,"Great place to visit. Make a point to go on top. Mostly discounted tickets available with travel agents. Adventure activities available at top of the tower. Bungee jumping, Sky walk etc. However prices are expensive."
205,If you are not a gambler this is probably the highlight of a visit to Macau,It’s a nice tower but there is a lot more to see and do elsewhere. Unless you want to do the bungee jump or the sky walk of course!
206,A View Tower,"Great views, although be careful when you go as the weather will make a difference on the views. We went around mid-day and it was fine."
207,Good view from tower,The food is great and the view is fabulous ! The staff are very helpful and friendly. This is a must see when in Macau.
208,Just a big Tower ,It was mesmerizing view from 61st floor ...awesome and also took the ticket separately from klook which is comparatively cheap from the counter itself ..Glass view was awesome my family enjoyed very well
209,A star attraction of Macau,"For the price paid didn't think it was worth it! Could only go to inside observation and outside observation deck. We wanted to have a snack with the view (which we do at other towers)but was told that you would have to come back down then go to the restaurant as it is separate from them and a different ticket. Was there for 10 minutes, not really worth the money"
210,Great view! Oh so high! 😮,"I come from New Zealand, was a little surprising to see to see an exact replica of our Sky Tower in Macau! Right down to the AJ Hackett bungy on the side and the rotating restaurant! The high tea is nice and worth the splurge."
211,A must visit in Macau,Chose your time to visit when it is early evening. You can enjoy evening as well night view. We visited at around 5 pm and were there for 2 hours. View is spectacular. You can see even mainland China from here. View of roads and bridges and moving traffic is captivating. Go to 61st floor which is open after visiting deck. Wind here will blow you out. It was very cold in November. A must visit if you visit Macau. Didn't try bungee jumping which is the highest in the world.
212,Best view in Macau,It was good view from top.. really good experience.. it will take almost 45 Mins to finish Macau tower visit.. glass floor is good experience..Bungee jumping is there but too much expensive.. approx HKD 4000 per person.. Any way good experience.. must visit..
213,awesome experience,"This review is on Macau in general, people, especially westenerns need to know it is a country set up mainly for Asians who are there to spend a lot of money. Casinos had very little atmosphere and very expensive $20 to $100 minimum bets. Shuttle buses were free casino to casino but hard to get around. Not a lot of english spoken. We were given misleading information about the ferry service all in all I would never go back"
214,Stunning view and excellent food,we didn’t dare go up the tower and see the whole city within one minute in full 360 degrees. i wanted very much to explore what’s up there but it was not included in our itinerary that’s already too full. i knew i missed the skywalk and the bungee jump but that’s alright. i’m not an adrenaline junkie. seeing it fromafar suits me just fine. maybe next time.
215,Nice but only for Bungee,"You can get there by taxi. Taxi fee is affordable with meter, no worries. Sky walk is so amazing. You should go up to see the city. Must visit!!"
216,Good for city view,"This is a  gambling city and going to the tower is no exception if you see the line up of  CRAZY jumpers waiting their turn. The  view is outstanding and you get a true sense of what has been spent to make Macau the city it is. The glass floor was great  as you can see right down the side of the tower to the bottom and picture where you would  land if the floor or glass were to give way. Gosh were there people frightened out of their wits, some actually crying to get off the glass floor. And then across the river is the new city being built  and all the pollution of dredging of the sea bed for sand. As towers go , not the tallest but the view is great and if you have young children there is plenty for them at the entrance . Also has a good restaurant on the ground floor"
217,Typical tourist hotspot,"On the third day of our stay in Hongkong, we decided to visit Macau. We heard that this is the Las Vegas of Asia. I do not enjoy gambling but I do love the casino entertainment and admire their building architecture. The best way to get to Macau from Hong Kong starts by going to Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal located at Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan. We purchased the TurboJet tickets and set off to Macau via red high speed jetfoil ships, after clearing the Hong Kong immigration (do not be alarmed, they will take your entry landing ticket because you are leaving Hong Kong) we waited for our ship to sail. It took one hour to cross the sea to Macau. Once we reached Macau, we have to go thru their immigration counters then off to the terminal. Be aware that as soon as you clear immigration, there are many people in the terminal that offers you a sight seeing private tour of Macau. They charge between 500 to 700 Macau dollars for few hours of ""private tour"" and these people are very persistent to annoying level. The best way, is to approach the Tourist information counter before exiting the terminal, ask the staff for a map and directions to good spots in the city. They will also tell you what bus to take. Bus fare  is 3.50 Macau dollars. We took a bus to Macau tower. If you like to visit the casinos right away, cross the street to the casino bus station. Choose a casino that you like to visit, board their bus for FREE. Tip: The Casinos are all in the city centre. Take the bus to casino and let your imagination guide you. You do not need to play in the casino :) We arrived at Macau tower, no plans to bungee jump or sky walk so we purchased a ticket to Cafe 360 revolving restaurant and have an international buffet (lunch). Bring your camera. The restaurant gives you a magnificent revolving 360 view of the whole city. This is like our 360 revolving restaurant back home in Toronto at the CN tower. Food was great. After visiting the tower, we went to city centre by bus. In the city centre we visited few casinos. By evening, we decided to go back to Hong Kong. We took a free bus ride courtesy of the casino to the ferry terminal and board the TurboJet back to Hong Kong. All in all, fantastic day trip and experience. Met good people (fellow tourist) in the tower and casinos."
218,niice view bad food,We did skywalk there and explored a hidden strength of ours. Bunny jump is also an option. I've kept it for the next time ;-)
219,Amazing View of the City,One can truly see how Macau expanded. 2/3 of the land is landfill and was done after 1999. You can get views of China and the islands
220,Casino,"recently had a short HK trip with sidetrip to macau,rhe place was really an eye opener with so many developments happening in the area but macau tower by far to me was the most impressive sight,even if you dont do the extreme stuff you will enjoy spending a few hours on top admiring the views."
221,SOOOOOOOOOOOO High,The weather was good the day we went.  We saw the whole Macau area and Cotai.  We also watched people bungee jump.  It seems fun.
222,tower for adventure sports,the view was excellent and the food had great variety to be eaten at a sedate pace and try the bungy jump if you dare personally I didn't
223,Walk on glass floor,"Come here just to look see the tower is boring. Go for the extreme, tower climb, bungee jumping or sky walk. Being a scary cat n phobia of heights, I tried the mild sky walk n it's awesome. Great experience ever!"
224,Great experience ,"If you want more than just the casinos, Macau Tower - while not jaw-dropping or state-of-the-art - is a great way to explore a city and see its history and its place in the modern world. An affordable attraction that somehow transports you away from the city and grounds you in it as well."
225,Nothing much to do!,Just accidentally got to the place walking around from the Senado to the department stores. Very windy day when we got there so it wasn't really that busy. I'm sure it will be if it has not been raining as much
226,The glass flooring!,"If you have visited any tall building in the world, this is same. They just have few additions such as bungee jump, walk on edge...etc. nothing special. We visited this place and just walk around for few minutes because we bought tickets."
227,"Great views, limited attractions",We happily watched the bungee jumpers and sky walkers from inside the safety of the tower but were not tempted to try ourselves!  There is a great view over Macau (until the haze comes in) and it was worth the admission.
228,The Bunjee jumping is super overrated and overpriced ,"If your not afraid of heights then this is a must, it was so awesome being 61 stories up walking on the edge.  For your safety you're not allowed to bring your cameras but the guide takes awesome pics and it's included in the price along with a free t-shirt.  It is a bit pricey, a little over 100 USD per person.  This was one of the most expensive things we did but for me it was worth it and the kids at a great time."
229,Scary but fun,"We were in Macau for a official trip however we had extended our stay. Macau is a place only for gambling except this one attraction.  We were keen on bungy jump activity. We visted the Macau tower. If one is not keen on this activity then visiting the tower may not be very exciting as ther is a fee to access the same. Before visiting this place we had done some enquiries which was different than real , in terms of the bungy fees. Actually with all the camera and pictures the amount of this activity is approx 4800 MOP around INR 40k. I found that a bit expensive. However the technology used and the comfort of this activity is of top class. Very safe and excellent experience. After all you are to pay for your safety. Loved the bungy jump. It was superb."
230,The amazing SKY WALK,"Enter the elevator and blink and you arive at the top, watch people Bungy jump to the ground and wish that you were brave enough.walk around and take in the amazing  views"
231,Spectacular view of Makau city,Even if you are afraid of heights as I am it is well going to see only 51 seconds to go 61 floors ! Great 360 views a photographers dream has plenty of seating & refreshments
232,Very nice view ,es the casino is nice and big but this place itself is just magical...it will take you more than a day to visit the while complex and all the floors...its also interconnected to other of its sister hotels which are also special in their own ways...and when i say special..i mean SPECIAL in capital letters...you will just fall in love with the whole place...there is a WOW factor everywhere you go...highly recommend going here early using the FREE shuttle bus from the ferry or airport terminal and spending the whole day here...and if possible stay the night...
233,A thrilling experience for those who lobe Bungee jumping,One of unforgettable place in macau and dunno best words to describe  just awesome and cool place ever
234,WOW What a View!!!,Guess what since we were in Hong Kong (HK for simple) and since we need no visa for Macau - a day trip to Macau is definitely worth it. So arriving by ferry to Macau  - as you get out of the terminal first thing you see in the far - once crossing the bridge from Taipa - you see the Tower - the iconic landmark of Macau. So what you can do: - well you have the 360 degree observation platform - so you can enjoy the view of Macau - we were there on a rainy day so this unfortunately did not come true. - than you have there the restaurant  - so you can have a lunch with a view. - and for those of you - not the faint hearted - who are seeking the thrill of a lifetime you can do bungee jumping and you get the certificate of jumping the longest bungee in the world!! - as said not for the faint hearted is more than 100 meters drop. If you are in Macau - check out the Tower - is more to it than meats the eye - enjoy!
235,Outstanding panoramic view,"We were in Macau for a day trip and the group took us to Macau Tower Convention. We paid the fee so we can go up the view deck, and it was just stunning! The 360 degree view will give you a peak of the whole of Macau! A must try for travellers visiting Macau"
236,Different cities - similar attractions,"Nice veiw. Easy to reach. Cheap tickets. Good time pass. Once you reach here, you will pass 2 hours and you wint even realise."
237,Another Tower to climb,"Loved the view and experience going up, the sunset with a beer in my hand was gorgeous recommended to have another POV of Macao"
238,Amazing views of Macau,Great view was cheap around $20 aud for the view is great my friend did jump he said was good great day trip
239,Magnificant Macau Tower,"Definitely worth it for the views.  If you're an adrenaline junky, you can climb to the top of the tower, walk around outside it, or jump off of it.  It's worth waiting around just to witness somebody jump, and watching them fall by looking through the glass floor areas."
240,One-stop (fake) experience,The location is niceCan take some picturesBut to go up you have to payAnd the shops are all brands and quiet expensive
241,The Famous Tower,Booked on the same day. No hassle in entering the tower just show the voucher. Not crowded so we were able to take lots of pictures. Great 360° view of Macau. Bonus: seeing the bone chilling bungee jumpers😬.
242,The view is amazing,The view is good if the weather is clear. Will cost you the equivalent of $25.00 USD per person. There is a few stops to eat and some shopping available.
243,Macau Tower,"We booked thru klook with good price.We went their around 3pm. The elevator is fast! We gave them the voucher, they checked our name from their list and directly assisted us to our table. The tea set is ready and we're good! No hassle at all. The food is awesome. We like the view and enjoyed watching the people jumping. While sitting, we are rotated and enjoyed the 360 view!"
244,Go for the extreme,There is very poor arrangement on the transportation after fireworks. Many people stuck in there and no way to go.
245,Worth a visit during good weather!,"We went to the tower just to be able to see the view, having a drink. But the bar was closed. So we tried to have a drink at the restaurant, that refused us. The only thing we could manage to do, after negotiation was to take a few pictures, as the one you see with this review. So great view, yes, but terrible customer service. We would have survived without the long taxi ride to get there..."
246,Nice View--But...,Went there to see Macau at night. It was beautiful. The guards were also kind enough to take us pictures and guide us to the upper deck. Short yet good experience!
247,Fantastic,"It was a breathtaking experience from the moment we stepped into the glass-fronted elevator, within minute reached the level 58 observatory deck and enjoyed the amazing 360° panoramic views of Macau. Then visited the level 61 Adventure Deck to watch Skywalk and Bungy Jump. We walked around inside the tower on glass surface, seeing underneath itself was scary. Didn’t have the nerve to try out the Skywalk or bungee jumping. Overall a wonderful experience and a must do in Macau."
248,Go for the views,"We took their VIP entry and paid premium so as to experience what was there and to also taste the included VIP food. Maybe our expectations are too high as it’s intended for VIPs, but sorry for us it was a disappointment. The view was great though."
249,Great view!,It will be a whole lifetime great experience if you come here to do the bungee jumping and skywalking.I didnt so I still feel that this tower is just a high tower to watch over.
250,Adventure ,"Macau Tower was a long walk as the taxi Driver suggested us to walk. Neverthless the walk was worth with a can of beer and some real good wafers. Not much to offer in terms of food but was really good to see some really awesome buildings, bridges and the vast sea from there. The entry ticket is 135 HKD so be mindful, if you want to pend that money for the view. Also few more notes of advice, Do not spend on taxi if you are travelling from the hotel hub Cotai. There are shuttles running between the hotels to the tower. Like one that we took was from Macau Tower to CIty of Dreams. And if you are at Ruins of St. Paul's Church then you can take the option of walk as well (You would take around 20 minutes to reach by walk)"
251,food with a view,Good view.  Recommend to go a little before sunset. The picture you take will be better. The staff willOffer the VIP card cost  215mop (normal is 145mop) . The additions are telescope card and d lounge service. The food in lounge are not tasty. No water. The good thing is you can sit and watch bungee- jump people
252,GOOD night view,The elevator trip was incredibly fast! Recommending everyone to buy the souvenirs made by handicapped people. Bungee jumping is terrifying.
253,Bungy experience top class,"Not for the ones who fear heights. Perfect for the ones who love adventures like bungee jumping, sky walk etc...You get a beautiful panoramic view right from the top and is worth a visit."
254,Mesmerising View,Face your fear people! My heart is pounding and I gasp for thin air as soon as I goes up and when I went down I catch my breath and almost fainted. But still it was a challenge and a thumbs up to those who explore a little further...
255,Amazing View,We went here for the Revolving Restaurant. The spread is amazing. There are a lot of food choices. And it's overlooking the city. It was lunch time and we could see the city during daytime. Must've been also nice if we tried it at night to enjoy the lights.
256,360º view of Macau,"I guess this is where you go if you only have a few hours to experiencce Macau. You can certainly see most of it from here and parts of Mainland China. And there are plenty of attractions and entertainment opportunities in the building at the foot of the tower.We went there, though, for the tower. It is exactly what it looks like. You go up. Have great views. People try to tell you stuff and you come down.The only other thing we really wanted on ground level was a restaurant, but for some reason they were all closed.Got there by local bus from the bus station in the centre of town."
257,Highest bungee jump! ,Of course the views are great. You can bungee jump for a hefty fee if you want. The rotating restaurant on the 60th floor had a good buffet. Lunch cost 278MD (about$39US)
258,Mixed feelings,Not worth a visit for me. View is just normal. Similar to view from hotel room. Toilet was dirty and smelly.
259,Macau 360,"We attended a guided tour of Macau via Flight centre.The local agent phoned us the day before to confirm our arrangements. We were to be picked up from our hotel but for some reason- we were asked to go to another hotel lobby. We were met there and taken by taxi to the ferry terminal . As Macau is part of China ,we needed our passports and had to go through immigration and customs .it took a little while but was fairly easy and  we didn't need to pre-arrange a visa. On arrival we were met by our great guide who was a local. He took us by us to St Paul's cathedral(all destroyed in a fire). The ruins and the fortress and gardens at the top are dry pretty and provide great vista of the city. Our guide took us by the Tower- (you can bungee here) . Senado square is a ice spot with some intact Portuguese architecture. There are lots of casinos in Macau city- not as flash as Las Vegas though.The turbo jet boat from HK to Macau is fast- upgrade to the premier if you can though as it will be nicer."
260,One time watch!!,Best view and good place to visit atleast one tinmeNow its a fire work seasonBest place to watch fireworkAnd highest place in macau to view the city
261,Would definitely come back,"This is crazy! Every ten minutes someone is jumping off from the bungee spot. You can also: walk around the tower (the Skywalk), do some tower climb from the observation level up on the antenna or do a Sky Jump, basically you step aside from the same platform and your smooth free fall is controlled by strings and pulleys. It is the worlds higher commercial bungee jumping spot and the second higher decelerator descent facility. There are two observation decks, one inside and air conditioned, one outside. Two areas on the inside deck have glass floor.On the other hand, it's an excellent place to see Macau and China from above. On a clear day I bet the views are remarkable, unfortunately when we visit was a bit of smog. Two  things you'll notice. One is how different is the old Macau from Cotai Strip and urban areas in continental China. The second is the water around Macau, with all that streams and different colors at the mouths of Pearl River.On a windy day, an ease swinging is noticeable.One more thing. If it seems to you that it looks like Auckland's Sky Tower, you're right. After all, it was the inspiration for it."
262,Exciting Walk,"At first we thought it was just a walk around the tower , so it was easy and fast. But it turn out more like a fun photo shot session where the guide will stop us at different stop and take photos.Felt nervous at first but as we are getting used to it, the walk ends. What surprised us is they did not force us to purchase those photos, instead they give us  in free USB.They also email me the certificate after that.Worth a try as you can enjoy the nice view of Macao the the thrill of it."
263,Great View and Nice Lunch,"Was there on 20th April, an experience of a lifetime, did the skywalk and it blows your mind, the guy from AJ who accompanied us was simply awesome. It was worth it, we did this in the evening, I guess little less scary than morning. Promise to come back here.As a souvenir you get clicked, video recorded, a T shirt and the coveted certificate to be framed for life.Go for it guys"
264,Nice exciting visit ,"We came here for lunch in the revolving restaurant, which was fabulous. Amazing food and beautiful views. Though we didn’t go check it out, there’s an observation deck and bungee jumping from the top of the tower. There are also lots of shops on the lower level at the bottom."
265,Tea time in Macau tower,"Kids also had so much fun in watching people there to walk and jump above the building. Who dare to do this??? Lets come, I bet you are willing to try this attraction. COOL place"
266,Grand view,"Scary place but absolutely that was a fun place to hang out to look something different,amazing place,so high"
267,Superb Views of Macau,"I was lucky enough to come to visit the tower on a beautiful and sunny day. I had a discounted ticket (group) as part of a day tour. The views are fantastic, especially on a clear day - you can literally see the whole of Macau and part of China. ...and no, I did not jump!"
268,Nice view ans beautiful sunset,"Had an hour or two at the tower.  If you have visited other towers, it is a little formulaic.  Over a certain point you know you are going to get a great view, and there is the usual glass floor sections to stand on and look down, if you are OK with heights.  While all this may sound a little blasé, it is very much worth a visit.  We went on a very cloudy, rainy day, but the view was fantastic, taking in the absurdities of the casino buildings and the older sections of the city.  You can go outside and watch people brave the elements and walk around the rim of the viewing deck, some throwing themselves off it (bungy!!).   I don't like heights, but am drawn to tall buildings (CN Tower, Hancock Centre, Eiffel Tower, Stratosphere etc), and this one was pretty good.  We did not really look at the shops at ground level, but were satisfied ticking another impressive tall structure off the list!"
269,Great view from the tower,Not many visitors on the day of our visit so the mood was relaxed in the building. They were getting ready for some exhibit. The view from the tower is breathtaking!
270,Amazing,"Ten years ago I wanted to go up this tower, this year I was able to do so. I enjoyed the glass floor on the indoor observation deck, nice views of Macau. The outdoor deck is a bit too warm for me, I hope I get to walk outside the ledge one day. A must visit in Macau , great restos at the mall below."
271,Nothing spectacular ,"I really love the view from here. I wanted to try sky walking and bungee jumping but it was a family trip. Maybe next time I would dare but not really sure though because when I was in the viewing deck then I look down, my legs are already shaking  😂 Hopefully I could come back here again. It was fun watching those who were skywalking and bungee jumping. 😭"
272,Nothing much to go around unless you are interested to go to the observatory deck and view the whole of Macau.,"We did the Sky walk and it was awesome. BUT, we think the price was extremely expensive as we almost give away. The view is very nice, if you spend few days in Macau, try to choose a day with a good visibility."
273,Thrilling experience,"Personally not very interested in these sort of venues - it's a tower. There's some bungee jumping and possibly some walking around the top. Am sure there is a panoramic view and all, but seemingly just built for the hell of it."
274,Interesting place but a tourist trap,"Didn't mind spending a little more for a VIP ticket (208 MOP) that fast track you into the lift when there is a long wait line, free simple food and drinks and some telescope thing to do. The place is very clean, beautifully decorated and on weekdays not too many China tourists running around. There is an upper open air deck where the bungy jump and walking round the tower tour starts and the lower deck with air cond (and full glass windows which i feel so much safer - i am very scared of heights). There are some parts on the lower deck floor that is made of glass which you can see all the way down. Off course this is the few metres i don't step on!!!!! Got to see both sides of old Macau and Cotai Strip, parts of Zhuhai, China. Was there just after lunch hour so didn't get to experience day and night view. Maybe next time. There is a souvenir shop and a nice quiet place only for VIP ticket holders to have some snack. Got a place to sit and was right in front of the bungy jump. Saw all the daring men and women jump and took quite a number of photos while they were on the way down. Once done, show the security your VIP ticket and you don't have to queue to get the next lift back to Earth!"
275,Nice place to be in !!,"the view was very nice , but the food was very bad  but after all i was there just for  the view so i think it wasn't that bad"
276,Expencive,"The bunjee jumping is overpriced like crazy , i wanted to do it but it was for almost 3000 hkd and that is way tooo much .. u can do amazing stuff in Europe and US for 1/5 th price The place is worth a skywalk once .."
277,Great view with interesting activities,If you like adventure and thrill then go for it...bungy jumping...sky walking on the edge of the deck...its all there...The observation deck was nice and had binoculars one could use to see the city view...it was over all an excellent experience..found it better than most of these towers that exsist
278,A great day in Macau Tower,It was such a fantastic experience!! Not scary at all since we have the safety belt and all the wire will cling on to you. Is a must try when you’re in macau. Awesome!!
279,Nothing much to see,"If you work in a podunk town in China, and you love movies, you may think that a trip to Macau would offer a nice opportunity to indulge your passion.  This is NOT the place to do that.  Let's start inside out.  The auditorium is designed for lectures--not too much better than any college lecture hall that you have seen.  The sound is nothing special and neither is the screen.  In sum, this movie theater is an afterthought.  Outside of the hall is a snooty cafe.  They do not let you into the house until almost showtime, and the maitre d' constantly told people to leave.  ""If you sit down, YOU WILL BE CHARGED.""  Not a pleasant experience.  If you are a female, you will wait in line to use the bathroom because they did not build enough female toilets.  Another crappy building designed by a man.  The building and neighborhood are a major tourist site, and getting to and from the location can be quite challenging.   Ticketing was on the first floor when you walk in and it was the only thing that was well thought out.  The cashier was also most helpful. It is rare that I give a place a one star review, but this one earned it considering the price charged and the fact that it serves one of the wealthiest places in the world."
280,Macau Tower,"A one off visit to Macau with a Hong Kong Pass, so we had a pass to exchange for tickets. It was a quiet day, with quick access to the 58th floor.  It would be a sensational view, if it wasn't for the ongoing pollution and in our case a quickly approaching weather front. Now can say been there, done that.  At the time with a reasonable breeze, there were still plenty of takers walking on the outside tower platform walk and bungee jump.  In my case, my feet were firmly planted on the inside floor, which included some glass panels for standing on, to view the ground below at 223 m's from the observation deck, with the tower height 338 m's."
281,The Macau Tower and Revolving Restaurant Cafe 360,"Macau was a disappointment to us as there is really nothing much to see. Even the casinos look drab and unappealing, especially if you have experienced the buzz of Las Vegas where the atmosphere is one of happiness. Macau just feels as though it has lost its way with little to offer to the tourist. Anyway, the Macau Tower is not that high compared to the buildings in Shanghai or even in nearby Hong Kong. It does, however, boast the tallest jumping off area for bungee jumping. This is about the sole attraction that I could find to go to the tower. Watch scared young men jump off the tower and try to catch the moment with your camera. It's almost like watching lambs to the slaughter! There is more to the Tower as there's a number of restaurants and shops but that's it. Oh yes, you do get a good view of Macau and beyond. With hindsight it would have been better to stay in Hong Kong, especially as you have to go through immigration leaving HK and entering Macau and do the same on the way back. I know that stranger things have happened at sea but this takes the biscuit."
282,Excellent view of Macau and the Bay.,This is fantastic to do. We watched bunny jumpers which is great to watch.This is a must do when in Macau.
283,For the top view of the city,I wasn’t able to try the extreme activities but would love to come back again!!! I only went where we can walk around and see the whole city of Macau. Spacious and there’s restaurants as well.
284,helpful staff,"Had a very awesome experience in bungy jump. Really a thrilling experience as well. Only a daredevil can do it & i did. Very good hospitality. Team members are professional, friendly. I recommend my other colleagues to visit here once who is in macao. Hatsoff."
285,View from the top,A very average set up which was quite disappointing given the aura of the city. Can not recommend it as it is quite a mission to get up and very unorganised
286,On the roof of Macao City !!!,"It’s not nice to go there when the weather is not good enough. Can’t take a good picture . So, we even didn’t go upstairs, changed our location"
287,Tall!,It was an amazing experience.  The place was clean. Well maintained. The people were friendly. And above all the location was picturesque.  Great place to be.
288,High level panoromic area.,"I've been wanting to visit the tower since I knew about it about 11 years ago. Much younger then, I'd wanted to try walking the circumference of the tower but now, I'm pretty good with just walking it from inside the tower thanks to the see through glass where you can walk on and see what's under the tall tower.The view was amazing and it does allow you to have a good bird's eye view of the whole of Macau and how close it is to China."
289,Did not go to the top...,We went there early afternoon on a weekday - not a lot of people so it was easy to up and down. We enjoyed the views of Macau.
290,Great View !!,"We bought a package from Klook which includes a tea set but as we were running a little late, the front desk had thought we bought only entrance tickets to the tower even though my ticket shown clearly mentioned tea. A lot of time was wasted making us wait as the staff mentioned that she couldn't find records of our booking. She even made us wait 10 minutes and ignored us until I went over to the desk to ask another service staff about my booking of which he quickly mentioned about our tea and promptly apologized for his staff mistake. We had only about 30 min left to enjoy our tea and view from the 360 cafe. I would highly recommend getting the package just to relax and enjoy the views while dining. Just don't be late as the staff are really strict about keeping to the time."
291, Must watch,"The internet ad was very misleading.  We thought the ticket already included the meals.  Instead, the MOC$130+ is just an entrance to the view deck and that's it.  The elevator queuing was not that impressive - tour guides complaining, some were even arguing with the tower crew.  Safety wise the elevator was jam packed to the very inch.  Apart from seeing Macau from the top, there is nothing else you can do unless you spend some more for the 360 restaurant."
292,A good view on a clear day!,Sky walk was a bit scary to watch (more so than the bungee jump)U can't compare it with eiffel tower but watching the jet ferry and the mainland China from above was a nice experience
293,Will come here again with some bucks,"spent 5 days visiting my best friend.  While she had a car, I took shuttles and cabs to get around sometimes.  It's safe.  I went to the Wynn hotel (I took a shuttle from my friends place, but any hotel should have the information you need for the historical walking tour). They gave me several maps when I asked for the historical tour.  I started in the A-Ma temple (I took the cab) and followed the 24 (I think it's 24 or 26) suggested points on the map.  From the A-Ma temple, I walked it all the way to the St. Paul ruins.  I took my time in the Mandarin House and enjoyed the scenery as I walked around town.  Wear comfortable shoes and bring water.  It took about half a day, not rushing and giving time for exploration and even getting a bit lost,  but it's easy to find your way around.  I asked locals and they were helpful even when I just had to show them the map.  Street food at the St. Paul ruins is safe.  Even had boba.  If able, stay at the ruins at night, it's a different scenery, however most museums will be closed around 5 or 6.On another day, I went up to the A-Ma cultural village (it's breathtaking) and checked out the cute panda right below the hill of the village (if you go around 3:30 is when they feed them).  This trip is separate from the walking tour and you will need to take the bus or car to get there. Shopping at night at the ladies market is a must!Of course hotels and casinos are abundant to gamble and look around in, but since I lived in Vegas I skipped that part."
294,Good views but I have been to higher towers,"Took a cab here from Grand Lapa near Sands for 38MOP. We arrived at about 10.30am and there were only a few others. We bought the tickets 1 day before from Klook at a discount. It was quite easy to redeem at the counter, no need for printout."
295,Must visit,"This was an amazing experience. Walking over the glass was quite scary but at last I did it . People were also doing sky walking and bungee jumping . The view is so splendid from the glass shed. It was a short visit to the place , so could not explore so much.You should must visit this place."
296,Dive of the life ,"Unfortunately this was part of my city tour and I didn’t have enough time to do any of those ‘out door’ activity. That was shame, especially because otherwise there is no chance of an open view or take photos without glass re-flash. I like the glass floor spots.  I should have booked it as separately."
297,Average,"We went to 360 cafe for tea time, it was kinda foggy on the day, so didn't see much from the top. The cakes and dumpling for two people were kinda expensive for the price. I believe that would be much more beautiful getting up there in the clear evening, so you could see everything when it spinning."
298,Cool views of city,I wanted to do Bungy jumping for a while now but something or the other used to come up always. But this time I had made up my mind and what better place than the tallest tower @234m to do my maiden bungy jump. My jump was timed really well as it was the perfect time to have jumped as I could see sunset during my jump as well as see the beautiful city light up in lights during evening time. Beautiful view. This place attracts a lot of tourists and one can get amazing set of pictures.
299,Dont miss this when in Macau!,"We went here with some anticipation and, overall, would call it a mediocre experience.  First of all, it has a feeling from the outset of being tacky.  It has a Toys R Us and an Ikea on your way in.  There seem to be umpteen types of tickets and packages and just the basic ticket was surprisingly expensive (around $140 HKD).  It is very hard to pose for any kind of picture because it is very crowded and the tourists will literally stand in front of you while you are tying to get a photo.  The bungee jumping and skywalk really seem touristy in a cheesy way and were VERY expensive.  If you like the cultural aspects of Macau, you won't like this--it's like something stuck onto Macau that could be anywhere."
