0,PLEASE READ! must have reserved time slot!,We arrived here only to find that it requires an app download and appointment to see. It was completely booked for the entirety of our trip and we were unable to go inside. I've included a picture of the QR code to hopefully save someone else. Really disappointed we couldn't go.
1,Difficult History - Told Well,"The site is huge and free to enter, though you'll have to go through a security check to enter the grounds. The museum was extremely crowded, as there are many school groups and even military groups passing through. Expect to be jostled! Visitors should be aware of how contested this history is: China maintains that 300,000 people died, while Japan argues it is far less. Consequently, you will see the figure ""300,000"" absolutely everywhere. It's a highly political site. My biggest concern were the open mass graves (not 1, but 3 mass graves left open for the public to witness). I couldn't help feeling awful, not only that such horrible things happened to these people, but that they were then exhumed and put on display. It's well worth visiting, but not without its faults."
2,History is quite scary,"I went here over the May 1st holiday weekend. Unfortunately it was extremely crowded due to the holiday and free entrance, so I did not get to take the time to really take in everything. So be warned about trips there during holidays.As for the museum itself, it is one of the best I have been to in China. Lots of displays, with plenty of English translations. Relics and artifacts from soldiers, families, etc all with detailed descriptions. I could have easily spent 3 or 4 hours there reading everything, but the crowds made it hard. There is a nice park outside the main museum too. A must if you are in Nanjing."
3,China's holocaust museum,"I visited Nanjing just after May Day holiday, this is a must visit!  You’ll need a minimum of 2 hours to appreciate this memorial, although 3 to 4 hours if your not limited by time. Exhibits are both inside and out. so take an umbrella the total area is huge. Free entry, powerful sculptures throughout."
4,Historical,We went this morning before heading back to Shanghai. The tour is very well laid out. Crowds were not big at all and we did the full tour in 40 mins. It's free to get in. You must see this if you are going to Nanjing
5,Historical,"Visited during a National Holiday, it was very busy but the queue was managed well and so we were not waiting too long. You'll see excavations on unimaginable scales, and then the following exhibitions are very well done. The exhibition does have tinges of pro-nationalist rhetoric but on the whole, it was very informative and used photography and stories very well for you to build a sense of the context, events and aftermath of the Massacre.If visiting during busy Summer spells, bring sunscreen and water as we had to queue outside for a time."
6,Very well-done,"Being Chinese but being raised in the US, it was very informative and emotional to tour this site. very well done"
7,Beautifully done on such a tragic part of history,The entire museum was amazing clean and lots of graphics to to understand what's going on even if you don't speak Chinese/mandarin!
8,A place & time for reflection of horrific killings and women being raped by Japanese soldiers,"I read many comments before visiting this place.  It was not what I expected.  I was given the impression it was to commemorate what all happened in Nanjing (and China) in the 1930s and 1940s.  But, as another just posted, it's more.  It covers all of WWII - ETO as well as PTO.  It covers  what happened in numerous countries.  There are even front pages from various newspapers so you can also read about other events of the country (like FDR giving up his court packing plan).  Many photos, numerous relics, a couple of videos, and simply lots to see.  Yes, very subjective at some displays, quite objective at others.  If you didn't study up on WWII, you'll learn a lot.  If you know quite a bit about the war, you'll still learn something new.  Two metro stops in that part of town, one being closer than the other (line 5???).  Let the statue be your guide - woman with child and dove.  You can see her from afar.  Take the walkway ""between the walls of the curve.""  No one else was around for me to follow and I did plenty of wandering to find the entrance."
9,The Memorial of the Nanjing Massacre,"My husband and i visited during spring festival and it was pretty crowded but worth it. You should be mentally prepared as you will see many crude images of war, death and devastation which can be a bit morbid at times. Still is a good reminder of human cruelty and a good historic lesson."
10,An eye-opener and very sombre atmosphere,We came to Nanjing specifically to visit this museum and we weren’t disappointed. The memorial is beautiful and very moving as a tribute to all of the people massacred in 1937. A must-see while you are in Nanjing.
11,Visit to this memorial is very moving and respectful. It was largely visited by Chinese residents and some foreigners.,"This is a very interesting and worthwhile visit but was incredibly crowded on a July afternoon - maybe because it is free. It is quite far from the other attractions of the city and a large site, so allow plenty of time. The massacre is documented with contemporaneous records, objects and incredible photographs, all well displayed and with English descriptions. Some parts are a little harrowing, but it drives home this terrible period in history.  It was good to follow the advised exit route through the various memorials (some indoor) including the final water and monument after the main exhibition area."
12,Open mass graves...,"Upon entry, you are greeted with few statues crying out desperately. The museum is well designed and filled with history facts, videos and undeniable evidence. Highly recommended."
13,Heart wrenching,I was very impressed with how well done this museum was and all of the sculptures were incredible.  It's a very horrific subject but they have truly put together a great museum to memorialise it.
14,Fantastic place,"The first time I visited the massacre museum I didn't know what we were visiting. However, it was very apparent what we were in for the second I took notice of the statues that lined the pathway to the entrance. Each statue depicted the brutality and reality of the Japanese invasion of china and pulled no punches. On my first visit, I was so overwhelmed with the reality of what happened there that I sped through the museum just reading the main history and trying not to get too entrenched in the thick of the emotional backlash that this museum confronted me with.On my second visit however, I took the time to walk through with my wife and truly embrace everything there. I suppose, I was a little more prepared this time and teaming up with my wife who is a nanjing local, really allowed me to embrace the emotion that washed over me when we entered the hall of records. Both of us, left the with tears smearing the sides of our cheeks and immediately left with a friend to watch a comedy at a local cinema to lighten the mood.If you do travel to nanjing, then I highly suggest you visit the beautiful memorial and experience the tragic history of the war. Although, like my wife and I, I would have something uplifting to do after you leave."
15,Understated horrors,"Went there during our stay in Nanjing, to realize that they are closed until December 13, 2018 for renovations and to prepare for the anniversary of the event. Just be aware if you will be in the area during this time. We were still able to walk around the outside which was very tranquil as there were nobody around except a security guard."
16,"Not known history for Europeans, this will take your breath away","We came here on a holiday and it was very very crowded. There's an outside area which is rather scarce and the museum is very well-designed. There's so much information and pictures, videos, so much to learn about this massacre. Nonetheless, it can feel a little bit overwhelming and information overload."
17,The most solemn museum ,"Going through this memorial museum was a very somber experience. The history that is documented is extremely horrific, and can be quite upsetting. In the middle of the museum there is an open pit in the floor where a mass grave was found when they were excavating for the building. This is set up as an exhibit to show the actual skeletons of people killed during the massacre.Don't expect this to be a 'fun' day out. But I think it's a must see if you come to Nanjing."
18,Nanjing Massacre Memorial ,A very well done site. We learnt so much from this venue. Anyone who goes to Nanjing needs to put this on their list of must do!
19,"GRAPHIC AND CHILLING, BUT SUCH AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL ACCOUNT!","Really well done museum; however, I recommend arriving when it opens to avoid the massive and pushy Chinese crowd."
20,"A must visit, lest we not forget",This is the must see while you are in Nanjing. I had emotional moments while visiting this place. Deep story about the past and head for brighter future. And it is free.
21,An amazing collection of the truth,This place can bring tears to your eyes within minutes if entering. Everything has an English translation but if you only just go to look at the photographs you will be chilled to the bone A stark part of world history and it now includes world war not just the massacre of Nanjing Have a look but steel yourself to be wowed
22,Eye Opener,I didn't know about the massacre before visiting Nanjing. This is an excellent museum with clear explanations and wonderful exhibits. It was very moving.
23,Consequences of war,"A detailed explanation of the morbid war, must be told to generations. The trip took about 5 hours as the museum explained the start of war to the present. Lots of genuine artefacts to depict the war."
24,Nanjing massacre museum,"It is of course a very somber site, but well worth visiting. It is easy to access, right outside the metro station. Be prepared for long lines to get in, but it moved along quickly. Free entrance. We went around lunchtime and I think that was a good choice as the line afterward was much longer (maybe try going early also?). The crowds were sizable inside, so have patience. The exhibits are well designed with significant information in Chinese and English. The design is well done for the outside/memorial and there is a lot of information to take in inside."
25,A must-see Museum,"This museum is the best place to know our past. I have seen the pictures on Internet, but when u came here to see both pictures and the description together, you can feel the sadness and hopeless.Frankly speaking they do not display much bloody pictures, but the wordings are well-describe the situation and how Japanese army treated the local people and even kids."
26,The dark side of Imperial Japan,"This museum is like Jurassic Park, very dark inside, but instead of seeing dinosaurs we saw images of a lot of dead people.  Very sad place to visit.  I tried very hard to hold back tears."
27,"Moving, shocking, and stunning.....a must visit!",Not to many words needed. This site was the main reason I visited Nanjing. It was not a pleasant visit due to the specific history detailed. Overall the exhibits are well-done. It might be worthwhile to do a little research before visiting.
28,Not Always Historically Accurate,I thought I was prepared for the experience but found myself moved to tears before I even went into the museum. The sculptures on the walk to the entrance are so haunting and beautiful. Once inside the enormity of what occurred really hits home. Very well presented and leaves me with a better understanding of what really happened.
29,Worth a visit,"A must see... but not on a public holiday! We attempted to go on the last day of Chingming festival and promptly retreated as the queues were around the block. However, this does testament to what a great museum this is. The event of the Nanjing Massacre are well documented and presented in both English and Chinese.  Admission is free, not recommended for small children as the pictures can be very graphic. A fantastic place- go!"
30,Nanjings Best Museum,"I have just finished reading the book ""Rape of Nanking"" so the visit was timely. The viewing of the massacre sites was quite chilling. The signage in the complex is poor though. The War museum has great info"
31,Reminder,"I felt this memorial was well done with a great deal of artifacts and first hand accounts of the atrocities that occurred in the city.  Historical quotes from the victims, survivors, soldiers, and observers were presented alongside relics, photos, and newspaper clippings.  There is also a portion dedicated to the foreigners which played a helpful role during and after the massacre. As an outside observer it is a bit uncomfortable as the memorial leaves you feeling the two sides need to further come to terms on the atrocity at an attempt to fully heal the wounds of war."
32,Very important but very depressing,"The museum was easy to reach, very understated, and provided a very meaningful experience. We would recommend visiting this museum if you're in Nanjing."
33,Something really suggestive and emotionally strong.,"A really well organised memorial visit, from parking arrngements through to all aspects of what is an amazing recollection of details and items from this terrible massacre nearly 80 years ago.The most memorable for me was to see a photo of King George VI, his wife the Queen mother and the 2 Princess with Winston Churchill on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, the one Princess who is Queen Elizabeth II, the current Queen of the UK."
34,May history never repeat itself ,"visiting this place is a MUST! I think it’s not suitable for children.. being there made me somehow living that tragedy!!! the pain , Injustice,  and the Lack of resourcefulness .. i felt like the place is alive.It’s worth for visiting.. I usually feel bored visiting museums but this one you will be excited ,interested and wanting to see more until the end."
35,Museum?  Memorial?  Exercise in crowd control?,We had heard of and read about the 'Nanjing Massacre'. It was a very moving and sad place to visit. Basically it was on the site of many mass graves of the period. There is a lot of history and personal life stories from survivors and it is worth spending at least a day to read the full history and pay respects to the dead. In some cases only one child had survived from a whole family.It was interesting to see the many Chinese children and youth attending the memorial.When we visit China again this place will be on our schedule again. This place was the most memorable of our entire tour.
36,Open my mind,"There is nothing subtle or 2nd rate about this huge museum. A beautiful and well thought out facility, it makes you think, and perhaps a bit uncomfortable, but Is very educational.  I read Iris Chang’s book The Rape of Nanking, and felt that the museum was in line with her perspective.  I’m uncomfortable with the subject of rape, but the museum addressed it in a straight forward way with without overplaying the horror of what happened.I also read about the criticism that her book had received, and was wary of propaganda moments at this museum. At the end of the day, the museum did not inappropriately bash the Japanese, and I felt that we were all reminded how all of us as humans can act.Bottom line is that this was a very good visit, that taught a lot about the war in China, and forces all of us to beware of the darker side of mankind."
37,Remember the past!,"We visited on their long weekend and there were a lot of people visiting at the time.  Having said that it was well set out and catered very well for English speakers such as ourselves.  We had a interpreter with us who made it much easier for us to understand the significance, but, there were many explanations in English to help if you did not have one.  The Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne is the only place I can compare it to but it does not have as much detail as this particular museum.  Certainly a place to visit, but probably best to do so when it is not quite so busy as it was difficult to get to see a lot of the exhibitions without having to queue or push yourself into the crowds to view them.  Well worth a visit if you are into history. but take at least a half day to work your way around it."
38,Didn’t attract me much ,"Great Museum with lots of exhibits! Had a great time reviewing the history and I need to go back when I have more time. If you're interested in no holds barred WWII history, then this is a must see when you're in the neighborhood."
39,Nanjing Massacre Museum,"When you first got to the entrance, you saw the vivid display of the suffering people.  Then you read the description, immediately your heart felt so heavy and sad.  While we were walking inside, you just could not believe the extent of the cruelty of war.  It was horrified and terrible.  How could one human being exerted so much harm and damage to another human being! So many people killed, raped, and families destroyed.  It was very disturbing, sad, and emotional.  However it reminds people the destruction and harm war can bring.  We must strive for world peace.  This place is a Must Visit if you are in Nanjing.  A good history lesson.  Besides it is Free."
40,Very impressive and sad,This is a new exhibition of this historical event It is quite confronting but is very well presentedI can recommend going there as well as Nanjing itself . Nanjing has much to offer the tourist and I found it very interesting It is an easy bullet train trip from Shanghai
41,Very emotional,"This is a first class presentation on a terrible part of human history.  Very informative, well laid out museum.  Details are well documented in excruciating detail.  I have previously visited Auschwitz Concentration Camps and Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial, so was somewhat emotionally prepared for what I was walking into.  Another sobering reminder that we all need to love and respect one another!"
42,Much bigger than I expected,An Interesting museum in a good space. It was very busy when we visited (Chinese New year holidays) so we rather got swept through as opposed to taking our time!
43,Ok public holiday,"This reminded me of the jewish holocaust. It is very moving experience to see the images, video presentations and read the notes with each item displayed.Glad it was winter as crowds are low and we were the only caucasians in the museum.The Chinese do this exhibitions very well as we have seen with the ones such as The Three Gorges.We had one thing that was a minor difficulty. we walked the 60 minutes from the Frasier Suites using a mobile GPS which led us to the exit area. So another 35 minutes to actually walk the the security area at the entrance.Everyone should see this exhibition.We have a Chinese GPS dongle which allows us mobile access to the internet anywhere we are. $160 at the Shanghai airport, you keep the unit and top up when you go back again. Good if like me you go there regularly. Still cheaper that using your own GPS system."
44,A must see museum,This memorial is a must visit if you want to understand Nanjing and modern China. I was impressed with the lasting message from this memorial - that we must remember the victims of this atrocity but strive towards peace. It's not a pleasant couple of hours and I wouldn't take young kids but I'm very glad I visited. Leave thorough exit 7 and there's another free museum about WW2... We happened upon it by accident but it was another well presented exhibition.
45,Impressive,A definite must-see when in Nanjing - there's no entry fee.  I don't speak Mandarin and didn't have a guide but everything was very clear.   Such a cruel event and so good to see the positive and future-forward messaging.
46,Moving,This was one of the most outstanding museums we have ever visited. The story is tragic but well told and the city of Nanjing is a tribute to a city that was desimated but whose people are strong and resiliant and have rebuilt it in just 80 years.
47,Respectful Reporting and Commemoration Terrible Part of Chinese History,Of course The Nanjing Massacre Memorial is a compulsory visit for anyone in Nanjing. The memorial is well arranged and tells the story of the massacre in depth. A sombre place as is to be expected. The additional museum about the wider fight against Japan and Nazi Germany was also well set-up.
48,So moving,"We felt we had to visit this place while we were in the city. It’s a very stark reminder of an especially dark time in Chinese history, and its meticulously detailed in both the information it presents and the items collected and displayed. You could spend hours here, and aside from the queue which rarely moves, and the lack of sun protection while you wait outside, this is the kind of museum visit you don’t want to miss, especially if, like me, you have a fascination with all that’s morbid and grim."
49,Important place to visit,"The other reviewers are correct, this is a magnificent memorial, beautifully done. Unfortunately, we went on a holiday weekend and there were so many people inside that we were unable to read most of the information due to the shear number of people. The number of people inside the building felt a little unsafe at one point as if they should have stopped letting people in. Overall a definite ""must see"" but avoid a public holiday."
50,Very tastefully done memorial for such a terrible atrocity,"This memorial and museum is much larger than at first glance.  It could very easily turn into a visit lasting an entire day if you're into history circa 1912 (end of Qing Dynasty) - late 1940s (end of WW2 and end of Chinese Civil War).  There is a vast set of materials in this excellent memorial and museum, so prioritize accordingly.  Details:The most apparent ""main"" segment of the memorial bounded by your entrance into the museum (take exit #2 of the Yunjin Road metro stop on the red line), an informative underground museum about the events around the Massacre, names and foot imprints of Massacre survivors, the unearthed remains of victims, and appears to end with a ""Peace Sculpture"" (a white marble-colored female with a raised right arm with a dove and the left arm carrying a baby on-top of a black plinth).  You would be mistaken to think that the memorial stops there.  But no, that's not all.Once you cross an elevated footpath after the Peace Sculpture, the right fork  gets you to a copper-color cladded structure that is a sight onto itself.  That structure hosts yet another underground museum that explores how the events in Nanjing are related to the Tripartite Pact (Berlin Pact) between Germany, Italy, and Japan in WW2, and the military tribunals that tried the criminals from that period (including information about the Nuremberg Trials for Nazi war-crimes).  The military tribunal for the Nanjing Massacre is explored in the ""main"" segment, but there're more details in this other segment, and a lot of information about China's anti-fascist war narrative in the context of WW2.This is the other segment of the Massacre Memorial that I did not expect when I planned for my visit.  The ""main"" segment takes about 2.5 hours to experience, and this other segment is extremely extensive in scope and will take at least another 4 hours to explore. There was one factual error, though, that I spotted in this other museum segment: a photo of blind-folded individuals lined up and made to sit on the ground was labeled as Chinese in Singapore awaiting execution after the Japanese successfully invaded the ""Gibraltar of the East"" (i.e. Singapore) in February 1942 not long after after Pearl Harbor December 1941.  Although many individuals of Chinese descent in Singapore were undoubtedly killed by the Japanese in the ""Sook Ching Massacre"" of that time, the photo was actually of Indian (i.e. south-asian) individuals prepared for execution who refused to collaborate with the Japanese in Singapore.  That same photo (and a few others in the Massacre Memorial) can be also be found in Singapore's ""Changi Museum""."
51,"Wealth of info, but too crowded",Beautiful exhibition and memorial. Very informative and enjoyable for a history buff like myself. Highly recommend a visit.
52,Japan - China war ruins,"the great museum that was well organized and comprehensive presentation.copy the quote from John Rabe""Forgivable, but unforgettable"" past experience if not forgotten, serving as a guide for the future."
53,Massacre Museum,"Initially, I did not even wish to go this museum, as I felt these are the same everywhere in the world and I am no longer affected by the horrible events they are dedicated to. I couldn't have been more wrong. At first, I was mostly very shocked by the fact that I have never learned anything about what happened in China during the WWII. Then reading more and more about what happened, I was quite upset but was really glad to have learned this part of history. The museum inside the memorial is very well done, so even the people not interested in history can get into learning about the massacre. I don't want to call it entertaining, but it certainly was not dry and boring. I would recommend bringing something to drink and maybe some small snack, especially during summer. The area is quite large and I only saw one place where to buy something to drink. It gets very hot even despite the air conditioning inside during the summer weekends with many many people coming to see the site."
54,Excellent museum ,"We thought we knew about the Nanjing massacre but this excellent museum educated us and moved us. Spacious and architecturally interesting - the story of these Japanese atrocities is well told in Mandarin and English. We paid a small sum to hire head phones that gave us a short summary of what we could see in each area. Pictures, artefacts, eye witness accounts and news reports all contributed to a greater understanding of this shameful phase of China's history."
55,Autumn leaves,The Memorial to the Nanjing Massacre is easily accessible by taxi even from the outer city areas where we were staying near Nanjing University. From the beginning of the visit you were struck by the horror and suffering of the people of Nanjing during the invasion. Statues placed in a flowing pool of water highlight the innocent lives that were lost. The excavated mass graves are not for the faint hearted but are a place of somber reflection. The main exhibition area is accessed down stairs that brings you to a replica of the city gates. The massacre is described in detail in these rooms and you should allow several hours to view it properly. The memorial is a must see in China and is comparable in presentation to similar memorials in other countries. No shop selling books or other literature was disappointing as I would have liked to read further.
56,Historical,"Impressive is the best word I can use to describe this place. It has a huge impact with all the graphical arts exposed there. It is worth a visit as it is am impressive area, and monumental construction, but it can shock a little as well."
57,History must be told,"Remember that this is closed on a Monday. The sculptures on the outside get you in the mood for what is a sombre experience. Obviously the story is told from a Chinese perspective but it absolutely was a massacre. I studied history to MA level and I had never heard about this awful tragedy. The expats in the city e.g. priests, lecturers industrialists (e.g. Rabe who was a Nazi party member and Siemen's man in Nanjing) did alot . The foreign diplomats seemed to do very little.You don't need Chinese for this heritage centre."
58,Heartbreaking but till a 'must see',I had no knowledge of this event so I thought it would be a good idea to learn some local history. Was not disappointed. Large amount of artifacts and English was also used on all displays. Would recommend a visit by anyone visiting Nanjing.
59,A must see,My son was aware about the massacre of Nánjīng but I was not. The museum is free and huge with 3 sections. Yes it is crowded and there are strange elements such as crowds for video with no order. The evidence for the massacre is overwhelming and the story does need to be told. The horror of war is clear but the behaviour of the invading forces were shocking. The sad truth however was peace did not come from this as there was a bloody civil war with atrocities that followed. Having noted this there were real heroes both Chinese and foreign. There are issues that challenge ones perception for examples me the role of Germans saving many innocent people with safe zones. War is terrible so this is not an easy place but is as relevant as other sites of massacre.
60,Probably the best museum in China,Must see if you are interested in the history of a place. Very impressive buildings and presentations of a high standard. An emotional place that will touch the hearts and souls of anyone who visits. It is important to remember these atrocities so they do not occur again.
61,Amazing Massacre Museum ,Nanjing Memorial Place is a must if you got the chance to see it. I am living only one hour away from Nanjing and have seen it a few times. Sad memories which had not really to do with war. Brutal humans raped and murdered so many Chinese in all ages. Very sad reminder.
62,"Closed until December 13, 2018",I've been trying to rearrange my schedule to come here for years.  It is well worth the trip.  Sad images and stories about the horrible events during the war.
63,Good Museum,"The museum itself is worth a visit. It is well planned and there are English explanations. Just beware that it is a zoo. I was absolutely appalled at how the Chinese acted in a museum of this importance. Loud, pushy, tour guide with a microphone, far too many people allowed in at once and not the least bit respectful. I was unable to get close to many of the exhibits because of the crowds. It is also school field trip time so that makes it worse. I think it's a good museum, but somehow you have to find a time to go when it is not a zoo. Good luck!"
64,thoughtful presentation,"I didn't know anything about this part of history before visiting Nanjing, but once I landed I knew this was going to need to make my list. It is very easy for an English speaking visitor. It tells a lot about the history and has some pretty remarkable artifacts and presentations. This certainly isn't for the weak of heart since there are some pretty graphic images in the museum. I think this really needs to make your places to visit when in Nanjing. Very well done."
65,Excellent visit,"This is a very sobering place to visit.  Built to remember the victims of the massacre of upwards of 300,000 people, it is a very solemn place.  The memorial itself is very minimalistic, very stark, almost abstract.  It has a very grim feel, which if probably appropriate for such a horrific event in history.  The only reason that I do not give it 5 stars is that I visited on a holiday weekend and there were masses of people which detracted from the memorial to a small degree.  I would like to visit this place again when there are fewer people and when I can more fully absorb the magnitude of what it represents."
66,Moving experience,"When I went just a few days after the New Year it was very, very busy but once inside it was actually ok. They managed the queue and people well. The exhibits inside are heartbreaking and really give a picture of this terrible, terrible event. There is the museum section and when you come out a cafe, memorial area to pay your respects and an excavated area where you can witness the mass graves that these poor peoples remains were interned in."
67,"Very well done, but shocking ","This is conveniently located near the Yun Jing station.  It is free and you can take your own time to browse at each area. However, the place is crowded. So be prepared to wait or see an exhibit behind layers of people. Artefacts had been artistically displayed in black n white tones with touches of red. An average of about 2h is needed to view all exhibits."
68,A must visit...,"The atmosphere changed drastically from lively robust to solemnly quiet once you enter this place which held too many sad memories from the past. It can be quite eerie due to the silence, but everyone was comfortable with it. Spend a few hours walking around here and take in the information slowly. Those who died shall not be forgotten."
69,interesting history,"I really wanted to like this place and the effort is noble, but don’t come expecting to learn much or to be able to pay respectful homage.  The crowds make it impossible to do either.  Entry lines can take forever and scores of school groups move through en masse, hurriedly.  Then there are the adult tour groups, often with commentary.  Getting close enough to read the captions is a struggle.That’s just for the educational/museum component.  For something so important to the country and the city, I don’t understand why the hours haven’t been lengthened.The memorialization part is less congested, as it should be, because it makes the same point over and over and over.  At the entry are row after row of ledgers high up on the wall, presumably filled with some sort of official documents, then, almost immediately, there are the name-filled metal books listing victims while above are representative portraits.  So far, so good, but then you leave the building and encounter 1-an eternal flame, 2-a stone paved burial site, 3-an excavated burial site, 4-a darkened room with electric candles representing more specific victims, and 5-a reflecting pool and massive-for-the-site statue entitled “Peace.”  It would have been hard to have come up with something more trite or less subtle.  (There is also an equally massive relief centered on a bugler apparently rousing, I dunno, the citizenry? the troops? the conscience of the world?  Whatever, it is altogether discordant.)  It seems the design committee couldn’t bring itself to eliminate anything.I should add that the site is not just huge; it is also laid out such that when you finally exit, you are a LONG way from the metro station, the exit of which is directly across the street from the entrance to the building.  The walk thereto, at least in English, is poorly marked.Depending on your interest and patience, maybe you’ll be educated and moved, but you may also be thinking from the beginning, “Please, just get me outta here!”  5 stars for the effort, 1 for the experience, hence my 3-star rating.  Good luck."
70,A Moving Experience,"Visiting the Nanjing Massacre Museum was definitely a heart wrenching solemn experience. We had to do it after staying in the city of Nanjing for 4 yrs . That’s the first thing that came up when we first googled Nanjing. The best of the whole visit was coming out of it with a beautiful message .  “ BEAR HISTORY IN MIND , CHERISH PEACE”"
71,Incredible experience ,"This is possibly the best 'memorial' museum that I have ever seen, as it has been assembled in a sensitive and poignant way. There are many fascinating things to see and all have been set up in an informative and stylish manner and also with an english translation. It reminds me a little of the Twin Tower memorial that has been set up in its' use of marble. It is free to visit and is easy to get to as there is a metro stop a few minutes away."
72,Don’t forget Nanjing of 1936,"I read several reviews on this and it was a sombre experience for me to witness the 300,000 victims who perished under the Japanese Occupation in Nanjing. It depicts real life stories that are heart felt on what the survivors went through, similar to the Jewish Holocaust. There is a place dedicated for those perished and their remains are still there for people to pay their respects and remember them. Overall I would say it is a place not to be missed."
73,Great memorial to a tragic event,"Due to the content and nature of the museum, this is a solemn attraction. It’s beautifully designed as well though. Lots of detail and easy to read and follow"
74,Solemn,This museum is very good but serious at the same time. Unfortunately we went on a Saturday and were herded round like sheep as it was so busy so didn’t get to stop and read everything. I really would recommend it other than this.
75,Everyone Must Experience This Site,"It was a very emotional experience for me. Beautiful and great way to commemorate the victims. Enormous complex, depending on when you decide to exit, visiting all the associated buildings will take up to 2 hours. The purpose of the Memorial was to make sure the atrocities and its victims were never to be forgotten. Mission accomplished I would say."
76,MUST SEE,"The place is really good and well kept,  we went during the autumn vacations and so many people were there"
77,Astounding..,"I have to admitted that although the place’s message is to promote peace and letting the world to learn the atrocities committed by the Japanese in China, personally I would not forget nor forgive what Japan as a nation had done. The memorial is beautifully built and the exhibits are very touching. It is an honor for myself to visit this memorial, especially knowing that my grandfather participated in the Sino Japanese war in the thirties until the surrender of Japan in 1945. As a Chinese American, this memorial granted myself the understanding and clear perspectives of Sino Japan relation."
78,"Best ""horrifying"" museum we have been through","I went as I'm interested in Chinese history and the second world war outside Europe and it is definitely worth a visit, particularly the statues and footprints are haunting. The exhibition itself is almost overwhelming in terms of the visuals and materials available -  a lot of details and a lot of gory evidence of the massacre. I was surprised to see families with kids down to 2, 3 and 4 years old - I'd think it would be rather terrifying for children that young."
79,"Dark, Depressing and Manipulative",I have lived in Nanjing for the past few months and definitely appreciate this place more after visiting the memorial as well as the museum.
80,Remarkable ,"A humbling experienceI had read quite a few things before the visit  (strongly recommend Iris Changs ""The rape of Nanking"" if you can handle this pretty gruesome subjectWell presented first half but I did find some parts a bit too ""nationalistic"" for my taste300000 lives perished during a few weeks should work as a stark reminder of what we people can do eachother-as should the tens of millions of victims later from the Mao regime"
81,"This is a ""Must See"" if you're in Nanjing!",My husband and I visited the museum to learn more about the history of Nanjing.  We found that it was very well made and it was hauntingly sad and beautiful. We couldn't go through all the material because of the long lines (we went during the holiday) but it was still good even if we only got bits and pieces. Write ups were factual and unbiased in our opinion. A must-visit when in Nanjing.
82,Very powerful and good English for visitors,"This is a surprisingly low-key museum.  Very tasteful.  The Wikipedia article about the Nanjing Massacre is much harsher.The displays inside the Museum are mostly pictures and recreations of scenes of events from the time.  There are a number of pieces of military equipment, uniforms and such.  There's an interesting section about the efforts of foreign residents in NJ at the time which has a letter written on Third Reich stationary to John Rabe.The Museum really hits home when you get to the building, separate from the main section, housing one of the mass graves.  It is a chilling place.It should be mentioned that one needs to act with a bit of decorum there because the antics of some of the visitors at the time of my visit were appallingly disrespectful.  Climbing on statues for whimsical pictures.  Tossing rocks around.  And the person loudly barking into his phone in the mass grave building despite the angry glares from the people in there and in contradiction to the many signs requesting respect."
83,On par with the US Holocaust Museum in Washington,This Memorial is very visual. It really shows the horrors of war. It's worth seeing but you will not leave the same person. The images are truly heart breaking and also respect the resilience of the Chinese people.
84,Japanese Invasion of China,"Once you enter the memorial site you'll walk down along a row of statues, they look crooked and almost as if their stone skin has melted; old people and children, adults and babies, either dead or suffering. On the bottom of the statues are some sentences written in English and Chinese, giving a taste of how people were feeling as the Japanese were attacking. You then enter a large yard with a large cross and the number 300,000 in large numbers, representing those who lost their lives in the attack. There is also a large bell, every single details of which represents something, however it's too long to describe in this review. You can see a few more statues and then you'll follow a path dotted with several large stones, each one depicting the site where hundreds of people were killed. Further on you can see some of the bones of those who died and there is a small cinema that shows the events in more detail. You'll also see a museum showing the stages of Japan's invasion before the massacre, when they took they city and those who helped save thousands of people, there is also a hall dedicated to the survivors. At the end of the site is a large white statue standing on a pedestal representing peace despite all of the terrible things that had happened."
85,It would have been better if not for the noise,"it was great trip for me to walk the whole place. first it is free. so you wont need worry about how much to pay. the moment you walk into the place, the sculptures really bring you immediately into the horrible scene.the names on the wall , the stones, the photos ,everything in the entry hall is so impressive and very deep heart touch!I think they have regular tour guide to bring you through the whole exhibition which is quite good to follow the guilder. I think I will bring my child to see when she is older. and I have to say any Chinese should come to see and learn this part of the history and remind of the nice peace life now. it will make you cherish more your life!"
86,Tragic moment in China’s history ,"This place is very well done and extremely moving emotionally. Japanese tourism to the area greatly declined once this opened, understandably. Vivid presentation both with pictures, actual mass grave sites, video and sculptures.  All of Nanjing was a must do with a local tour guide who really knows the history."
87,Please go,The memorial site is very big and you could easily spend a whole afternoon or half day there. The grounds are gorgeous and the information is very detailed. I thought it was quite aggressively translated in some sections. Very well done.
88,Heart wrenching,Well done but not a good attraction. A sad episode. You do walk down through the exhibit and learn a lot.
89,Confronting and moving,"Really beautifully landscape and architecture design to frame the content of the museum - I really loved the statues and landscape outside especially and thought it was very emotional. The museum was very interesting, and it's such an important and recent part of Nanjing's history. If you are debating between going here and the Nanjing Museum, most definitely go to this one. I spent about 2 hours there and found that was enough. The museum flows through chronologically, so it easy to follow. I was there during mid-autumn festival and the crowds were A LOT and took away from the experience of the museum, so I suggest going on a weekday when I assume there are less people."
90,"""Always forgive, but never forget""","It's really important to go here as this reveal the truth of the Nanjing Massacre that happened during WWII. Detailed description of the massacre, should spend time there."
91,Great history museum of WWII,We were there on a holiday weekend with thousands of others. While that distracted from the solemnity and scale of the memorial it was strangely encouraging to see that this contemporary city has a clear understanding of its past which hopefully China will never see again on either side of the history lesson.
92,Depressing,"This place is built to appeal to your emotions, some of the halls are dark and emotional, if you have children with you just to brief them beforehand.I liked the later part of the walk where you are led to open spaces, the Peace statue.. the flow and planning of the museum space is superb.It is also near the subway so it's a good place to visit. Just that when you exit be sure to exit at another door near the subway too. :)"
93,Sobering experience,"This was one of the best sites to see in Nanjing. The crowds were crazy with field trips and other tourist. We wished it was more spread out and more English subtitles. We read the Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang before going to the city, so this is helpful in knowing the history. The outside of the museum is great  and beautiful to walk around. Take your time! Go early and get the most out of this museum."
94,Land symbolizing Peace,"I don't see what is the point to visit this place, again, one more to check-mark your list but I really did not like it at all, it is insensitive and more than peace building place it looks more like if they don't want to forget. Not recommendable if you are sensitive to these kind of topics and places. The installations are nice and well maintained. To visit respectfully"
95,If you like history... go there,"The museum was crowded on the Saturday afternoon of our visit.  Before entering the museum we walked by a series of sculptures depicting heart-wrenching scenes.  This memorial does not hold back on displaying the atrocities of the massacre, and its impact is powerful.  After exiting the exhibition, visitors pass through solemn displays of victims' remains. A peaceful garden at the end of the visit is not as soothing as one might hope, but it allows for a transition before returning to the routine of your day. I'd put this on a list of ""must sees"" in Nanjing, but be prepared for the emotional impact."
96,Painful and true - some propaganda,"we didnt know anything about chinese history before going to china, so we made sure to check out many monuments and museums while we were in nanjing, beijing,and shanghai on holidays.  The memorial of the massacre was quite interesting and not somethign i had even heard of before."
97,A must see ,"If you're staying in Nanjing as a tourist you will no doubt be wondering whether to visit her, and chances are that you will.Apart from being confronting about the obvious theme, it is very L - O - N - G.  Of a group of several people, all but one was starting to look for the exit door by what was it, the fifth, sixth or seventh hall?Interesting enough if you're into this kind of museum, but would just like to say in conclusion that the PEACE sign was very welcome at the exit!"
98,Emotionally draining,"The Memorial of the Nanjing Massacre was educational, and very broadening.  Prior to this visit, I had no knowledge of the atrocities that took place in Nanjing and across China during World War II.  This memorial needs to be a necessary visit for anyone coming to Nanjing."
99,Emotional moments when visiting this place,"This museum was actually very impressive and carefully detailed the invasion of Nanjing by the Japanese and all the things they did to the city and the people. Would highly recommend it to those who want to learn what happened in Nanjing during WWII, and the ending is very positive with a message of peace. Was very moved by the whole experience."
100,Surprisingly good museum,You enter in one door and wind your way through the museum on a one-way trip.  The place is huge and the information about the massacre that took place in Nanjing was very powerful.  It is very sad to hear the details of what went on there.
101,It's the Massacre,"It is a very emotional experience and I believe that if you go to Nanjing, you've got to visit this place. History has a lot of dark pages and this is one of them.Entrance is free and English language translation is provided everywhere"
102,Poignant reminder of a terrible attrocity,"A must-go. The experience may get to you, as it’s graphic in spots. Still, the learning of this event in history is essential. Also, go see the nearby WWII museum. It was huge and well worth the visit too."
103,A must visit!,"This site is absolutely brilliantly layout, and is a fantastic memorial, to remind people of the horrors of war. However when you read about this Nanjing Massacre, this was nothing to do with War, but basically brutal, human beings against the Chinese, rapes,murders, crime against all ages. A very sad reminder.A must visit in Nanjing"
104,Very respectfully done,"Given the historical significance, I would say this is a ""must see"", but I did not find it all that great. If you have read Iris Chang's book ""The Rape of Nanjing"", you are not going to learn anything really new at the museum, and I didn't find the presentation all that compelling. The descriptions of the battle are overly patriotic and clearly intended for a Chinese audience. Spend adequate time on the statues along the entry path - in my opinion, they are the best part of the museum, and you don't pass that way when you exit."
105,A must place to visit in Nanjing,"As a History teacher, a visit to Nanjing would not be complete without a visit to the museum. It is an awesome place, extremely well funded and jaw droppingly complete. Read as much as you can, absorb the horror and remember that this happened less than 100 years ago."
106,Not that educational if you have read Iris Chang's book,"Visited Nanjing for the first time and this was the only place I really wanted to visit here. The memorial is done up very nicely with many photos and testimonials of the atrocities carried out so many years ago. It is a really good place for locals and tourists alike to visit to comprehend the horrors of war, similar to the holocaust museum I had visited in DC. My only gripe is that the visitors should respect the solemnness of the place and gravity of the incidents that happened so many years ago. Maybe it was the weekend and there were many tourists but it was really noisy and children were running all over. The staff should try to ensure that noise is kept to the minimum."
107,Informative but chaotic,A rather tough memorial place. Very well setup. Try to go on a weekday as it was too many people when i was there.
108,A must do in Nanjing,"I have been to the Memorial twice now, the first time was about 5~6 years ago, then I went again this weekend. I read ""The Rape of Nanking"" (which I highly recommend) before I visited the first time, and this trip I recalled many of the things that I had forgotten in the interim. Overall, it is a pretty good memorial, but is a bit heavy - 300k farmers & civilians slaughtered by the Japanese. It is worth a visit, but don't expect to have a light-hearted afternoon after visiting. In hind-sight, it probably would have been best to visit just before happy hour..."
109,Learn from history,Main purpose of this trip is to come to this memorial. It was very sobering experience to witness the horror of war and what human beings can do to another.Took some time to take all in and the whole memorial was well maintained and documented.Worth a visit
110,Lest we forget.,"Even though I went about an hour before closing time, I thought I would have sufficient time. There were a lot of people entering at the same time as I did, but it was not enough time! There is a course you have to follow, from one building to another, so I felt it was quite structured and systematic, but again there were too many people. It's difficult to focus on what you're seeing/reading when the staff keeps saying: 'Please walk while you look, don't stay in one place.' It is a lot of information to take in, and I wished I had gone on a weekday and probably at an earlier time.Many people were shaking their heads at the atrocities and photos, so may not be a good idea to bring young children. There are many interesting things to see like relics, photos, and also information on different wars as well. I learnt many things I did not know about the massacre, and I'm glad I paid a visit. Will definitely come back to make up for what I did not manage to see!"
111,Very enlightening,"We went on a Tuesday afternoon thinking there would be less of a crowd. We were wrong. Very Informative but some of the statues and quotes are over the top. I do recommend if you are at all interested in the history of Nanjing or China. Everything is in English and Chinese, and entry is free."
112,Well worth seeing,So my husband and I had some time before our flight in the evening. I read about this memorial before heading here but when you arrived at the memorial it’s not just about the outdoor statues. The memorial was built around the area where the massacre happened and what impressed me the most was how well keep the Chinese maintained this building . It’s a great place to learn about the history of this event brings you from the staff right until the end . You’d need about 2-3 hours. Yes the memorial area is both indoor and outdoor. I definitely learned a lot from this and I recommend this to all . This place is easy to find as well.
113,Very In-depth ,People are waiting in line to visit. Try to avoid weekends and holidays and get to there ealier to beat the crowds. Each day there are a huge number of visitors coming to the memorial.
114,A very well done memorial,"it was chinese new year holiday when we got here..probobly 11 am..be sure to eat breakfast  first because you will spend 1 or 2 hrs in the line.it was raining,and yet still heavy line..when you enter the premises,there is still another line inside beforeactually getting inside the building..so for those bringing kids and elderly,,think about it again.inside is really dark,containing the pictures and names of the countless victims.and exhibition of the pictures ofwhat happened in the war. also have bones of the actual people who died..you cant really appreciate it so much because of the so many people inside. choose the day when you go here,must not be any chinese holiday and weekends.."
115,Excellent Done and Accessible to English Speakers,"This place is absolutely amazing. The work that went into the facilities and the scale of it all makes it well worth the trip. My only complaint was the tone of some the inscriptions. While this was undoubtedly a serious war crime, I think there was too much of a focus on blaming the Japanese, which took away from the remembrance of the dead. However, this is a fault which I find with almost all such memorials, and it is still well worth seeing."
116,Somber and powerful ,"The museum grounds is very solemn and poignant. After the security checks, you enter a walkway where statues of the various suffering the citizens of Nanjing underwent during the war. Inside the complex there are donated bell, cross, and other reminders for peace. A wall which inscribes the name of the victims surrounds the complex. The museum is partly located below the complex, it has a wall which shows maps, the main actors, up to the victims of the massacre. Their is a small curio shop at the end of the museum which sell articles related to the massacre. Other points to consider in the complex are the unearthed portion of a mass grave, an eternal flame, and a statue of a goddess, which has a nice reflection on the pool. Directions inside the complex are abundant, the challenge is when you exit and look for the nearest subway stop, it is a circuitous route to the subway stop, that if you are not patient, you will take a cab. Nonetheless, there are attendants along the perimeter wherein you can ask for direction. A must see in Nanjing. This memorial is not to celebrate death and suffering or to humiliate a race, but is a poignant reminder that war is never good."
117,Well Done,"This memorial is easy to get to via subway. Be prepared to bring your local ID card or passport and to walk for quite a long distance. The museum will make you sad to be human and sick at all the suffering caused by the Japanese military in the 1930s. Nonetheless, the museum tries to give a positive spin to things, by featuring people who sought to save residents during the massacre, the efforts of journalists to tell the real story of the massacre to the outside world, and efforts to create peace after the war."
118,"No more wars, pray for peace.","Good quality museum, not too crowded. Quite graphic in places. Allow a couple of hours. Best to visit in the morning, so you don't get too depressed over dinner."
119,for historical lovers,"When asked by my Nanjing friends, I told them the two most enjoyable sights were this place, and the city wall (Zhonghuamen specifically). The memorial has interesting architecture, a bit like the Vietnam memorial in Wash DC, plus some nice sculpted park area, well worth some pictures for the interesting building angles. The main part of the museum is well done in terms of explaining the history in both Chinese and well-translated English, and some pictures to facilitate the emotional connection. So a great learning experience for me, even though I've already read quite a bit about the massacre.If you're less of a history buff, then maybe you might enjoy more the more frequented Nanjing sights of the Sun Yetsen Mausoleum or the Fuzimiao templer area. For me, both those places were less interesting in terms of the buildings and exhibits, with Fuzimiao ranking lowest for me, as it strikes more of a large outdoor shopping centre, while SYS memorial is in Zijinshan, the Purple Mountain, which is a very nice park, so you can enjoy a well-groomed park at least"
120,Nice memorial ,"As a historian who visits China frequently, I had been wanting to visit this important museum and memorial.  Allow at least two hours for a quick tour and longer if you like to read everything.  Each exhibit has an excellent English translation of the Chinese text.  The museum is thoughtfully-designed and feels new.  Be prepared for crowds, but you don't have to feel rushed.  The statues on the grounds are moving.  The museum/memorial is free.  Audioguides are not available.  Food and restrooms are available."
121,A bit gruesome,It is a terrific museum giving a very crude illustration of the illness of men to conduct war and destroy everything.The japanese war were a complete massacre of people living in Nanjing area . The memorial is exactly whet we needde to remember those terrific days and educate our children of what these don't have to create and do in the furure
122,We only got to see half!,"I visited the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall in July 2017.  Despite the crowds, the museum is an absolute must visit in Nanjing and is probably the  best museum I have visited in China. The museum is part outdoor exhibition and part indoor information centre. The information centre was holding an exhibition when I visited that focused on providing wider international and historical context to the massacre as well as focusing on sexual abuse during the occupation and the assistance and support provided from International residents of Nanjing at the time. Despite the hoards of crowds (as expected everywhere in China) it is worth holding your ground and spending time to ensure you read the exhibition carefully as there is a lot to be learnt. Despite covering such a horrific and tragic period of Nanjing’s history, the museum discusses it in a factual and sensitive manner with the exhibition ending hopefully, emphasising the need to reflect and learn from the tragedy in order to build peace and international co-operation. Alongside this the memorial complex also hosts the grave of 1000 corpses which whilst really quite difficult to walk through really highlights the violence and human cost of what happened in Nanjing.  Despite the extremely difficult subject the museum’s theme is definitely one of the importance of learning from history and remaining hopeful for peace. As you leave the museum you have the opportunity to pass through a beautiful reflection / meditation room and out towards the peace monument which I think encapsulates the hopeful and forward-looking message of the museum very well."
123,Forever moved...,"Finding the entrance from the Metro is easy (you can see it after coming out from the exit) but finding the exit back to the station is difficult. There's isn't any clear sign around and you may feel disoriented after turning in circles around the outdoor exhibitions. at the exit (after the tall statue), you should walk towards your right-hand direction where there is a cultural/performance center. you should be able to see the sign pointing towards the metro near the road after some walking distance. as a point of reference, you will pass by the China Fabrics Village (free entrance) along the way. the metro station is just right down the road. the museum provided the account of all parties-Japanese, Chinese and foreigners present during that period and visitors can judge for themselves whether to believe it or not."
124,"good presentation , education of history","Yes, this museum tells history from one side, the side of the victim. Yes, it may be used for propaganda in that sense. None of that makes what happened any less true and none of that should prevent anyone from visiting this memorial. Maybe also watch a couple of movies at home (google is your friend...).In my mind the memorial is a must see site... as are others elsewhere in the world... and with many of them it just makes sense to see past politics and possible other intentions that may be attached to the history today and focus on the history itself.I would not bring young children to this memorial, but well rounded and well informed teens that are interested in this history should be able to handle it. If they are not interested, this is not the place to go."
125,Remember horror crime but not the hate,"This memorial is great from the start.  Long walk in but prepares you.  Sculptures, walls, hills, all impressive.  The exhibits themselves include pictures, explanations, much in English, and audio visual stuff as well.  It ends in a burial ground.  Not a big spot to feel good about humanity, but one important to understanding.  Well worth it."
126,Sad and Touching,"There is so much emotion portrait into each aspect of this memorial, it is definitely well worth visiting. It's easy to access and understand."
127,"Consider a whole day visit: yes, there is that much to see and learn","It is a very humbling and interesting memorial.Free entrance, quite a lot to see, and a part of the history that is often skipped in our western history class."
128,Touching and Admirable,"I think everyone who visit Nanjing should visit the memorial hall.For those with wechat account, I highly recommend that you follow their official account where you can connect to their onsite audio guide when inside the hall, via blue tooth.There's so much to see and read here unfortunately due to the huge number of visitors, we're being moved on before you can immerse yourself in the story behind each display and the statistics.Still, highly recommend this place for all to remember and learn from history."
129,A sad chapter in the history of Nanjing,"Very good presentations, narratives on the Massacre period. Examples were present to illustrates and keep a constant reminder to people to value world peace."
130,Go to learn and commemorate this sad time in history,From the Nanjing south train station it was a 45 minute metro trip with one change. The site was sobering and moving. I had read The Rape of Nanking and that background helped understand all that I was seeing. The flow was well planned and took the visitor from grasping the horror and magnanimity to seeing a preserved mass grave and finally hope for future peace. It was comforting to spend time outside with the many trees that were planted with commitments to peace.
131,Best memorial park to remind priceless of Peace,"It's a very big memorial but rightly so. The english translations are very good and the accounts of the events are presented in an engaging way. Definitely worth a visit, we should all learn past atrocities."
132,A sad reminder,"If you enjoy history and being really, really sad then this is the place for you. I couldn't crack a single joke in here for the life of me. Really dark but a great memorial for those who went through the event. Plenty to read from survivor stories to statistics. Even on how the Japanese army arranged themselves to attack the city. I found it very odd to have young children running around like it was an amusement park and showed little to no respect for the dead. These were soldiers and civilians who lost their lives when the Japanese invaded. The lucky ones were killed quick. Yet all I see are kids climbing onto tablets with people's names carved into them. I also think they are a bit too young to see such gruesome images. I would not go again but not because it's bad in any way (minus the children) but because it's just so damn sad."
133,If you live in Nanjing its a must go!,The museum of Nanjing Massacre is a place that makes you dive into history. I almost cried. The place is very big and overdone.
134,See Chinese tourists on their best behavior,"I visited this museum on Labor Day. While crowded, the staff made sure everyone in line right before closing was able to visit. The information presented is factual, unbiased, and well presented. You could easily spend half a day here. Had it not been so crowded and right before closing time I would have spent more time here. It was the best museum I've ever been to. I was disappointed to see children here. It is not suitable for children to visit."
135,Incredible,A stark remembrance of the ugly and cruel incident and a lesson for the young generation. Exit with a very mixed feeling and a heavy heart.
136,Solemn Site of a Macabre History,Good to see. Lots of subjective comments in the museum but worth a visit. I discovered a part of history I knew little about.
137,Solemn and insightful ,"I visited the memorial on a weekday, and I would highly recommend this time period for everyone.  It was crowded - we are in China after all.  However, the crowds were at a minimum and it made the endeavor less stressful than had it been a holiday or weekend.  I was quite surprised that there was not admission fee.  There are several donation boxes along the pathways, but nothing required.  The entire situation is incredibly sad and depressing - with the actual photos, names, video clips, articles of clothing and other belongings from the Japanese army - it seemed to never end.  It is well laid out and the flow is very organized.  However, there is the bad part.  I walked forever.  There was never an opportunity for a graceful exit.  Two of the usual exits were closed, meaning that everyone had to return to exit 1 to leave the memorial.  It was very long, and I walked for hours.  I was quite tired by the time I actually found the correct path out, and made it to the subway station."
138,"Essential place to see, learn, and feel the gravity of this horror...","This is one of the most moving memorial I have ever visited, almost haunting and full of sadness. The narrative was perfectly laid and presented. Every words were powerful."
139,Grimsome,It is a place where you can see the cruelty of the Human Being. You will learn more about Chinese history and the reason why they hate Japan.
140,"Must see, must know.","Especially designed to remember the Nanjing massacre. The museum hall is underground and rather dark, and combined with the many photos of atrocities, it could become a little oppressive. When you get out again in the sunlight it feels like you throw a burden of your shoulders, and I think that is what it was designed to do: remember the past but move on in life.We visited on a Sunday and it was very crowded (inside) hard to see the artifacts. Entrance is free.One section has a wall with binders with the names of the victims. The wall is 12 meter high by 10 meter long - a very visual representation of the amount of people that were murdered in 6 weeks.Outside is a large park, good for a stroll and reflect on the past - may it never happen again.If you have time read the book by Iris Chang ""The rape of Nanking"" before going."
141,Astonish museum,"I have to say this was a fantastic attraction, but it was also very sobering.  The memorial was incredible but powerfully presented.  The artifacts and photos were amazing but the reality they shared was bone-chilling.  A worthy tribute to the lives lost and saved during this monumentally evil attack on Nanjing, this is a story that needs to be told and a museum that needs to be visited."
142,A must to visit !,I never got to the book but I learnt a lot visiting this memorial. There are real bones of vicitms and this is the very site it happened.
143,Very informative and sobering experience.,"This is both the saddest place and yet most incredible. Words cannot express how I felt having viewed the horror and inhumanity that occurred. However numbing this was, its equal if not greater experience is the documented acts of bravery in saving lives, and the incredible forgiveness shown by one women who suffered terribly. The memorials design is outstanding and its impact unforgettable. The final message of peace is the greatest truth. This is something that anyone promoting war should be forced to view."
144,Remember the Victims of Nanjing,"There's no way around it, the memorial remembers a very depressing moment of history for Nanjing and for China. That said, the memorial is a must see as it is very well done. Visitors will leave with a deeper understanding of this dark period in history."
145,Never forget the past,A must place to visit in Nanjing. Historical. A place to finding more about what happened during the Japanese Occupation in Nanjing
146,So sad and exceptional layout,First heard of the events and people memorialised here some years ago in a UK TV documentary. You can't miss this if visiting Nanjing. A genuine meaningful experience.
147,Special visit to remember the fall,"Your  trip to Nanjing is incomplete if you fail to visit  Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall/ Museum Entry is free. The hall has been able to preserve the horrors of war.  This  hall was built to memorialize those that were killed in the Nanjing Massacre after the fall of the  then capital of China, Nanjing, on December 13, 1937.This hall has well preserved the equipment and weapons used during the war, real bunker, picture galleries, statues . While leaving the hall you will definitely feel sad. 8:30 am-16:30 pm (closed on Monday)Bus: take bus no. 7, 37, 61, 63, 161, 166, 170 or 186 to get off at Jiangdongmen.Subway: take subway line 2 and get off at Yunjin Road. Take exit 2 and walk westwards to get there"
148,Well presented and balanced,"Not for the faint hearted, it really describes the horror of the Nanking massacre and shows it in horrible detail. Skip the part about WO2 in general though as it contains a lot of propaganda. Just leave after reaching the peace square. It can get busy and they only let so many people in at once, so come early. It takes about an hour to walk through te exhibit. Only downside is that some Chinese people don't know how to pay respect"
149,Powerful ,Visited the Nanjing Massacre museum. This is a free local museum popular with Chinese tourists that tells of the history of the Nanjing massacre.  the museum was crowded and very warm during the hot August visit.  But it was a very powerful museum and a must see for any visitor to Nanjing.
150,Informative and Moving,Very interesting museum and memorial for the Japanese genocide. Horror of the worst kind giving a terrifying experience. But made in a great informative and illustrative way. Absolutely a must if you are in Nanjing  except maybe not with small children who hardly can understand the non-understandable reality in the past.
151,Confronting,"We visited Nanjing specifically to visit this memorial. It is important for all future generations to see this place so as not to repeat the past. It is very well done and evokes admiration for those who made efforts to save lives during this dark period. Just go and experience it. If you have any appreciation for history and for humanity, it will make an impression. Carl Sagan said, ""you have to know the past to understand the present"". During war, people can lose their humanity, especially under poor leadership. Following the war, Japanese general Matsui Iwane and his liutenant Tani Hisao were both tried, convicted, and executed for war crimes by the International Tribunal for the Far East. Just go and see and experience it for yourself. We took our 12 and 9 year old children. There were school children there on field trips so the Chinese schools use it as an education tool. My wife asked whether the kids were too young to see this kind of stuff, but my reply is that this is history and it is something they should see at some point in their lives. We made sure to explain the context and answered any questions they had during the tour. I don't think it is a place for very young children."
152,An emotional experience with excellent exhibitons,"Excellent museum with shocking accounts of the Nanjing massacre. Not for the faint hearted. As with all Chinese attractions, you must be prepared for crowds that will test your patience."
153,Moving museum,"Entrance fee: FreeA complete documentation and story about Nanjing holocaust. There are  explanations in Chinese language, English, and Japanese. Explanation in English was comprehensive. If you like history, you need to visit this place to get deeper understanding about Nanjing massacre. The exhibition hall itself is taken care well. The situation in exhibition hall was made like replica of what happened during that time, ex: half wall because of bombing and inside house situation of Nanjing people that time. It shows the story before the Japan invasion in Nanjing till after the Nanjing massacre happened, including the execution of massacre's defendants. Overall this place gave me chill as I couldn't imagine that human being could do horrible things like that. The testimonials of survivors really really saddened me. After visiting The Memorial of Nanjing Massacre, I really do hope people realize that war benefits no one.If you want more comprehensive explanation, you can pay more around 60 yuan to hire guide or pay 10 yuan to get audio guide. You can store bags too there with fee around 5 yuan (I'm not sure). P.S: I don't think this place is suitable for kids."
154,"Very powerful and excellently designed, a must visit","You come into a dark part of the museum and walk through photoes and setup of the massacre of the chinese men and the sex slavery an humiliation of chinese women that the Japanese did from December 12th 1937 to 1st week of January 1938. Number of murdered Chinese about 330,000 in 3 weeks. The brutality of the Japanese match the brutality of the German Nazies and fills you with sadness. At the end you go through a hall with the lifes of the survivors, which gave you hope again. This museum is a must for evreyone that is interested in history."
155,Important stop in Nanjing,"This was absolutely spectacular. It’s very, very solemn yet portrayed and showed very tastefully. They have laid it out very well with many detailed accounts and Information from all sides. I fully encourage all for this to be at the top of your list visiting Nanjing, and give it at least 2 hours (remember, at the VERY LEAST!) I spent almost four hours here myself. The only critique I would have for this place is that some of the descriptions and writing of displays is very tricky to read due to size of font in some places. I didn’t end up taking photos inside due to being completely immersed. A MUST INDEED"
156,China's Holocaust,This was the Second place on my checklist for the trip to Nanjing. It was worth going there to know about the history and the incidents during the World War II (When Japanese attacked China).The place is well connected with Metro but can be overcrowded during the weekdays as well.
157,Good place for education,I enjoyed being in this place and discovering about the people of the time and the history of Japan and China.The museum is well done inside..
158,Very Emotional Visit,"Well worth a visit, can be very emotional at times and shows the true devastation of war and the atrocities which are a consequence. Some of the things and photos shown are very chilling and may not be suitable for young children."
159,"Informative, but cover crowded",This explains in detail the Japanese attack on Nanjing. Allow sufficient time to walk through the exhibits. All exhibits include English titles and explanations.
160,So many people!,"This is one of the best memorials that I have ever seen.  It is much larger than I initially thought.  The exhibits are very well laid out with excellent explanations in Chinese and English.  Such a tragic time in China's history, but really shows the resiliency of the Chinese people.  It is amazing to see Nanjing from the WW2 period.  Definitely a must see when visiting the city.  Admission is free!"
161,Brutal but Informative,"There was none of the stereotypically abhorrent behaviour seen from any of the mostly Chinese visitors to this most solemn of museums.Expect orderly queues, hushed tones and very civil behaviour from the attendees.The site itself begins with a walk along large bronze statues and a mixture of expansive and modern courtyards before two human-remains repositories and a collection of artefacts housed indoors.  There is also a reflecting pool and giant monument dedicated to peace before heading into the second half of the museum, mostly dedicated to China (and its allies) conduct during WWII culminating in the allied victory.Lots of little relics behind glass cases.Easily accessible from the Yunjin metro station.Little to no food options in or around the museum.In all, a slightly over 2 hour experience.There's a bust of Iris Chang near the giant head and bronze footprints for those who would like to pay their respects."
162,Nanjing must visit.,"I went because I would like to know more about the history of a country I visit during business trips. This site will put you back with two feet on the ground; so overwhelming and a very well organized memorial exhibition. This is one of the things you need to do when you are in the area, very easy to get there by subway"
163,An Emotional Visit,"The massacre which occurred here is meticulously researched and presented. There is way too much to take in if you were to try and read and see everything.It's pretty clear the atrocities were significant and had/have a big impact on the Chinese people. There is a constant theme of remembrance and an appeal for peace and harmony.I also sense the wound is not fully healed. As a foreigner I was asked to complete a survey of my opinions. In it were questions such as, ""Do you think Japan Should acknowledge and apologize for what they did."""
164,A history lesson for the world,Beautiful memorial that tells about the horrible events that took place during “The Rape of Nanjing.” Free to go in and very close to the metro stop. Most of the signs are all translated in English so it is very easy to understand.
165,Rips at your heart ,"Often crowded and noisy--not particularly respectful. Different venues copied from different Holocaust museums throughout the world. Little on rape, despite designation as Rape of Nanjing. Little on Minnie Vautrin and Iris Chang. Much on battles and gore. Moving statues."
166,Emotional Visit,Although it is a very sad and painful to see and know but Chinese peopke have done a very good thing to honorvand remember the victims if the massacre in a very touching documentation.
167,Wonderful memorial to a dark period in Chinese history,"It certainly did justice in remembering the tragic event happen so long ago and serve as a good reminder of what the people went through as a nation, however, there are constant crowds that are making all sorts of noise, turning a rather solemn place info a playground."
168,"Facinating, but brual delve into the history of Nanjing in WW2","The architecture of this memorial was impressive.Bronze sculptures along the path leading to the entrance depicted a gruesome and inhuman savage carried out by the Japanese Imperial army.Once in the memorial,the instant pitch dark and high ceiling dotted with numerous victims's photos gave visitors this halucination effect of the real and netherworld.The graphic details of the atrocities displayed on the big hall could be extremely revolting especially the mass raping of innocent Chinese girls.Some even go to the extent of repeated animal act on the same woman !!"
169,Disappointing.,"If you want to feel hatred against the human brutality, it is strongly recommended to pay a visit to this terrific museum."
170,One of the best memorial I have ever seen,"Of course, there are cruel pictures and videos, but this museum shows one of the most important parts of Nanjing's history. It's absolutely worth it to visit and has a good a didactical approach. Maybe, just avoid the crowds and go there early morning. To get prepared, we watched the film ""John Rabe"" a few days before. It also shows the dramatic situation of these 6 weeks in a quite impressive way."
171,Obviously not a fun place... but an important one,"To be honest its hard to put into words the experience of visiting this memorial. As someone who read Iris Changs accounts of the massacre I though I would be prepared, however I wasn't and would add that it is a must see place to visit.The memorial is free and when you enter you walk down a long path with a water course and metal figures depicting some of the scenes.On entering the building, its more or less, a wall to wall of photographs of the victims. I took some photographs of some of the victims, because they were so compelling. They have the usual paraphernalia associated with war, soldiers uniforms, weapons, bugles etc. However what I found compelling, and a testimony to the human spirit, were the actions of the missionaries, people like Minnie Vautrin, John MaGee and  John Rabe were true heroes and this memorial is as much in recognition of their efforts.I would add that Iris Chang and Minnie Voutrin both took their own lives as a result of this eventThe memorial is not so much about the atrocities committed by the Japanese, as it is about the need to learn from this event and ensure that it is not repeatedOverall it was an emotionally draining, but worthwhile visit - highly recommended"
172,"Meaningful, emotional and spiritual","Being a history teacher, I knew that I could not leave Nanjing without visiting this museum to the Nanjing Massacre which the Japanese carried out in the 1930s. This museum, located at the site of one of the mass graves, has the emotional toll and feel of places such as the Holocaust Museum in DC. This event, which few Westerners know about, is another one of the greatest tragedies that have occurred in world history. It’s an incredible shame that because of where this event occurred and to what people it occurred, that few American textbooks or social studies classes cover it. Seeing this museum today made me even more glad that I teach this event to my students.The museum is incredibly well done, and I was grateful that all the exhibits had side by side English, Chinese, and Japanese. This was the first museum (or even site for that matter) that I have ever been to where the mass graves were exposed. It was so tragic to see the skeletons of the thousands of bodies just sprawled all over the pit. I was physically dizzy looking into these pits. I’m very very grateful for having the opportunity to visit this site today."
173,Humanizing and Broadening,"It is very obvious from the people that passed through these exhibits how little foreigners know about the atrocities committed by the Japanese on December 1937 in Nanjing, in their imperialistic drive to conquer Asia.  We went during Golden Week when it was a 2-hour wait in line to get into the exhibition hall (Tip: Go early in the morning on a weekday and NOT during Golden Week for a shorter line!  Haha)  and in that mass of humanity of thousands of people, there were probably less than a dozen Caucasian people.  It is appalling to me when non-Chinese people who write 1-Star reviews say things like, ""It's like they don't want to forget"" and reviewers named ""Ninja"" say that the account is inaccurate because he learned some history in a class in the UK.  You don't think you're extremely biased for the Japanese just from your pen name?????  C'mon, this is no place for your inherent Sinophobia (and xenophobia)!!How would you like it if Germany denied the occurrence of the Holocaust?  Oh yeah, that's right.  There are already factions that do that but thankfully, cooler heads prevail so we can preserve history by steadfastly documenting all the facts so that episodes like the Nanjing Massacre and the Holocaust don't EVER happen again.On multiple occasions as late as 2017, the office of Japanese PM Shinzo Abe has floated the idea of the Nanjing Massacre DENIAL.  (Yes, that's the same idiot who nominated the current sitting US President for the Nobel Peace Prize...)  Maybe he'll soon float the denial of the Pearl Harbor attack that happened just a few years later in 1941!!  If the US didn't possess the atomic bomb, I dare say the Japanese would not have adopted its current pacifist constitution after WWII.  Who knows where their imperialistic rampage would have ended up?The exhibit starts with a kind of library shelves setting of thousands of names of known victims, then gets very grim indeed.  Yes, this memorial is at times graphic and macabre, to the point of being bone chilling and depressing, but it is an extremely important historical accounting of events.  There are multiple interviews with Chinese survivors, diary entries and letters from Japanese soldiers and commanders, as well as accounts from many foreign residents living in Nanjing at the time who sheltered a lot of the refugees.  The exhibit ends with a plea for peace as well as a reflecting pool and Peace statue.  This is not a place for young children.  Admission was free when we went, but I'm not sure if that was only because of Golden Week."
174,This is a Major Reason to go to Nanjing.  A must for the World.,"This place is not good for make fun , This is the place 300,000 civilians killed in history.Looking at the photos and videos of this massacre you will feel sad and hate feelings.Recommended to ware suitable clothes to make a respect on this place."
175,More than a memorial to Nanjing,"Though I certainly would not recommend this site for its fun or its pleasure, I feel that everyone on Earth who is interested in history and humanity should visit this museum. Regardless of your nationality, race, or ethnicity, the world cannot forget what happened here. The museum is very well curated and even ends on a high note by sharing the stories of survivors and their offspring. This is not a Japan-bashing museum, and has actually been beautifully pieced together from accounts and records from every major military power represented in the Asian theatre of war during WWI (including Japan and the United States). This site is about remembering the victims, and is quite tasteful in its presentation.My only shocking experienced here (and my reasoning for not granting five circles) was that the crush of visitors to this site were seemingly unmoved by the tragedy. Tourists were extremely loud and conversational in a space that to my sensibilities should have been contemplative, somber, and respectfully quiet. In that particular respect, the site feels more like any other museum in China and less like the memorials I have visited at Auschwitz, Poland; Manzanar, California; and Hiroshima, Japan."
176,Necessary visit,"US high school history books mention very little if anything about this tragic event in human history. Had I not inquired of my Chinese friends why China still bears hatred towards the Japanese, I never would have discovered this memorial to 300,000 men, women and children. I’ve also learned why the older generation of Chinese citizens are so thankful to Americans for defeating the Japanese during WWII. Now I have a better understanding why my friends have opened their hearts and homes to me, as well as why complete strangers have offered their gratitude to me after discovering I was a Meiguoren (an American).While the memorial presents a fair description of how the US and other foreign countries exposed the brutality of the massacre to the rest of the world, and that the Allied Forces defeated the Japanese during WWII to stop the carnage, the exhibit omits many graphic pictures of how barbaric the Japanese were to Chinese civilians, particularly women, expectant mothers, and children. I was pleased the exhibit spared visitors of those horrific images.As a consequence of the massacre, I’ve seen evidence of the hatred that the Chinese still harbor. In Fenghuang, there is a restaurant which has posted warning signs to Japanese that they are not served there, and I was at the Anti-Japanese Museum in Kunming. While I know the current Japanese generation was not involved in this massacre of 300,000 Chinese lives, the Japanese government has yet to issue a formal apology to the Chinese people denouncing its role in it. Only then can healing begin. Memorials like this help us never to forget the depravity of mankind to mankind. “Those who forget the past are destined to repeat it.” - George Santayana"
177,Trip to Nanjing,"From the pandemonium outside it is difficult to believe the respectful calm that greets you when you enter the museum. From the enormous 'mother and baby' statue outside to the hall of martyrs within, the entire museum is a heartbreaking journey through the horrors that befell the people of Nanjing during the Japanese occupation. Unlike many other Chinese museums where visitors can be less than well behaved, people who visit the Memorial of the Nanjing Massacre are restrained and respectful in honour of those who lost their lives. It is also nice to see there are no gaudy 'tat' stalls selling cheap knock-offs. All in all a sobering but highly educational experience that should not be missed."
178,Rich with history but be prepared to be shocked ,"Must go and visit this place. you must feel it and try to imagine those people esp children, women,old man been touchier and kill by the Japanese army.Keep reading each note and see yourself those photo taken during the war betweenChina and Japanese WarI really experience it and talk to my friends about it.Must go and visit this memorial"
179,Incredibly Moving ,"Very broad area, with great monuments and archive info. also has a park like section just to sit back and realise and take in what happened all those years ago. The setout is great sometimes theres entry fee and sometimes its free. If youve never been here if you came to Nanjing you were never here"
180,Should Never be Forgotten,"I visited here in March 2017.  The Nanjing Massacre of 1937 was a very sad and tragic period in Chinese history.  The Japanese army murdered an estimated 300,000 people.  There are statues outside including a plaque which says 300,000 victims in many languages.  The museum and the exhibits inside are very well done.  The photos of the victims and artifacts like the bones of the victims remind of the American tragedy of 9/11 and the September 11, 2001 Museum in New York.  The museum traces through the whole history leading up to and during the Nanjing Massacre and all the explanations are written in both Chinese and English.  Towards the end, one exhibit on the wall caught my attention.  The book The Rape of Nanking and its author Iris Chang.  Iris Chang was actually American Chinese and born in New Jersey.  She committed suicide sometime after the year 2000 (I do not remember the exact year).  A group of Chinese high school students asked me to fill out a seven-page survey (questionnaire).  I gladly filled it out and spent some time with them.  However I insisted that they go with me to the wall exhibit about Iris Chang.  If you are going to Nanjing which has many things to see, then this museum and memorial is a very important place to visit."
181,Important site,I live and work in Nanjing and must say I put off visiting thus museum because I wasn't sure I could cope with the dreadfulness.  But I also felt I needed to go  to understand what Nanjingers suffered in their recent history. It is a thoughtful experience  there are many exhibits to walk around including open graves with victims still interred.  As always with these things  its the little things that are the most evocative. Children's buttons. It is always busy. I would like to spend more time with less people there as one cannot give full attention to all the exhibits.
182,Sad what people do to each other,"Not an amusing and entertaining tourist site, but one of the highest ""must to see"" in China...It gives a wide and clear (and shocking....) view about the Japanese massacre in Nanjing at the time of the 2nd. World War and a warning reminder to humanity about how easy people and nations  nations can lose humanity...Well displayed and presented ...."
183,If You Love China - A Very Important Place To Visit,The memorial is a solemn place to learn more about the horrible Nanjing Massacre which should never be repeated again in human history.  The level of cruelty is beyond imagination.  The museum tries to give an objective account of the tragedy.  People of all nations and especially state leaders should be here to learn.
184,An important lesson,"A must-do for every visitor to Nanjing - this memorial documents the 300,000 locals who were slaughtered by the invading Japanese forces over 6 weeks in December 1937, including first-hand accounts by survivors.  Free entry."
185,Impressive with lots of information and the design,"Everyone in Nanjing should visit at least one time this museum to understand the history of the city. But you should absolutely avoid crowded days (festival, holidays,...) if you want to be able to see something."
186,"Somber, eye opening experience","Heartbreaking to remember what happened in Nanjing over a 6-week period in 1937-1938. A beautiful memorial to the 300,000 victims. A word of caution...if the weather is hot, go as early as possible. Also, out of respect for those who died, there are no chairs or benches until the very end of the exhibition. We spent almost 3 hours at the site, & it was definitely worth a visit."
187,Haunting,No wonder the Chinese people hate Japanese people !  Grounds are spotless.  Not a dry eye in the house.
188,An eye opening experience,"Worth the visit, eventhough it can get crowded. The way history is presented from Chinese perspective is often questionable, but not in this case. Takes maybe 1.5-2 hours from metro station, museum tour and back to metro station."
189,A message of peace,"While it is interesting to learn about Chinese history, specially an episode like this which is usually ignored in the West, maybe the memorial is a bit too focused to political nationalist propaganda for the Chinese. It is important to remind people of the atrocities of war, but never ending and repeating explanations of the event, lots of testimonials and praises to fallen heroes, made me feel it was a bit too much. I have seen concentration camps in Germany, and I did not have this feeling, even though there is also extensive literature and testimonials. Regarding the building, it is indeed and impressive memorial to the victims of such inhuman episode of Nanjing's history."
190,Place to forgive but not forget,"As someone who has studied the histories of both China and Japan extensively in the classroom, many of the exhibits were not historically accurate. Some of the photos had been 'altered.' The translations not accurate and worded in a blatant anti-Japanese way. Not a good way to come to terms with history. Not everything here is to be believed."
191,Excellent museum,"A modern museum to introduce one of the saddest page of The 20th century worldwide History (unfortunately not enough known outside China).As indicated in the title, this is the most poignant museum I have ever visited.Before getting there, I recommend to read the Diary of John RABE and/or to see the movie extrapolated from his Diary dated from 2008 or 2009.It will help a lot to understand the context and to already start to imagine how horrible was the massacre. But once you'll go to the museum, you'll see that your imagination was not creative enough.Not recommended to young children."
192,Not for the weak hearted,This is a great memorial. The pre event to which the holocaust that Hitler took ideas from and perfected and continued in the Holocaust. Most people are ignorant of that fact. Thanks to a Nazi German and an American who tried to save as many of the Chinese as they could. This memorial takes at least 2 hr to get through. Presentations are not all labeled in English.
193,Powerful and Moving,A good review of the history. It reminds people how lucky we are now and that we should respect world peace.
194,A thought provoking visit. ,This place is only for those believe in the after death as u know that when u see the name there is so many knowledge about the war of china and Japanese really how and what happen lots of information about any thing guns that they used and even the what kind of miltery equipment used really good need to visit when they come to nanjing some of the importance in this region.
195,Depressing on many levels,"This memorial to the massacre of 300000 Chinese in 1937 is impressive, interesting and informative. It is very well laid out with lots of information in English. The memorial was busy on the holiday weekend but we were able to view all of the exhibits in a 2 hour visit. There are some powerful and harrowing images, maybe not suitable for younger children.It is located next to the metro and entry is free."
196,It Can Be Forgiven But Never Should Be Forgotten,"If you know the history of Japan and China in WW2, you need to visit this place. All too often in China things are over the top and kinda tacky, but this place has class and dignity. I was very impressed by it all. Not for the faint of heart. We went at about 1:00pm on a Saturday afternoon, so it was quite packed, but surprisingly, the queues moved well, and the people were generally respectful. It winds its way through the complex in a well thought out structure. No idea as to the best way to get here, we took a taxi from our hotel, The Intercontinental, and it cost 18RMB, which is basically $4 CDN."
197,A fantastically documented and poignant atmosphere,So here I came but was a public holiday and no didn’t even get in 3 hour wait. Do not go anywhere on a public holiday it’s madness.  See photos
198,"Solemn, Eye Opening, a walk along History's Path","Revisited this museum after 7 years, it is still very well maintained and it is still very emotional experience.  While the crowds are noticeably increased, it will remain as my favorite museum in Nanjing."
199,A Never-Forget History,"The Nanjing Massacre Memorial is huge. So was the massacre. The museum is quite good. The grounds are impressive. Entry is free. Exhibits are at least minimally labeled in English as well. It does a nice job explaining the development of the war against Japan from 1931-1941. Slanted a bit- talks about the contribution of the Soviet Union's Air Force to the defense of China at the beginning of the war, but not about the Flying Tigers of the United States, but that may be just an omission for political reasons. It's huge, and it would have been nice to have a shorter pathway through for people who have trouble walking, as one of our companions on this trip had trouble with the stairs."
200,Well Worth Seeing!,"I highly recommend visiting this memorial.  Many Westerners like myself have very little knowledge of the atrocities that occurred in Nanjing.  The memorial is a real eye opener and is done to remember the victims and at no point do you feel like there is any blame being leveled at anyone.  I was unsure what to expect at the Hall of 10000 souls but it was very well presented and not as confronting for our 4 year old as i was expecting.  My son will hopefully remember the main thing he learnt here, NOTHING good comes from war, only evil."
201,Eye Opening,"The memorial was very well conceptualised. It provides a vivid description of what happened when the Japanese invaded China and overrun Nanjing. Through the use of earth tones and its unique architecture, it sets the mood to educate people about the atrocities of war through the Nanjing massacre. One should never take peace for granted. If one cannot defend what's your own, no one will."
202,Good history lesson,"You need to visit this place to understand very difficult and complex China-Japan relationship. Take your time , relax and reflect."
203,Information overload,"If interested in China-Japan history and relations it's worth a visit. With a gloomy vibe, it tells the sad og horrible tale of The Rape of Nanjing by using pictures, artifacts, documents and remains."
204,Sobering Visit to Nanjing Massacre Memorial,Good place to understand the history of the Nanjing Massacre. Solemn place. 3 exhibition area. Need to queue for security check
205,One of the must sees to understand Nanjing's history,"You know you are going to a memorial, but nothing can prepare you for the heart-rending sculptures or the sheer number of victims.  Well done Memorial with lots of history."
206,The terrible history of Nanjing,"When I went to Nanjing, I was really impressed, not only by the story of this massacre, because anyway all the wars brought only destruction and we should just repent, but mostly I was emotionally impressed by how human the statues at the entrance of the memorial were ... They were able to express the sorrow and fear of all those (men, women and children) involved in that horrible massacre also called "" the rape"". The motivation? I won't explain to you ... It only deserves to be lived and understood by yourself . I'm just saying that I was the only foreign Italian girl who, while admiring that memorial, wept. Absolutely deserves to be visited."
207,A trip through the past,We must remember the past to keep from repeating it!  This is a wonderful way to remember the atrocities of the past so we can be peace makers in the future.  I highly recommend this memorial!
208,want and value peace?  come see,An impressive and comprehensive museum documenting the events leading up to the Nanjing massacre with impressive architectural monuments and a somber exposed mass grave site. Would've been better if there weren't that many people there
209,Excellent for History Buffs!,"I've read about the rape of Nanjing but seeing the memorial really drove the points home.  I know for years that area was undeveloped because it's a well known mass grave site in Nanjing, so no one wanted to develop here which is fortunate for building such a beautiful memorial. It tells the story from many points of view and really shows both the physical and psychological effects on civilian. Seeing the mass grave excavation sites was also just mind blowing. It's one thing to know bad things happened but to know the victims are piled on under my feet really made me shudder. Admission was free."
210,An interesting experience,"You will be surprise how human can do some thing to another human race, this museum tells the true story of the cruel history that happened in Nanjing we must learn, I feel very sad after visiting this museum with no regret. There is a tour guide leading and explain to you (all in Chinese) at 10.30 am and 3.30pm, be there on time and let the people explain to you, after that that try enter again from the start and you will see more, advice time to visit 3 hours minimum, you can never miss this one. Beside this museum, there is another museum namely ""Victory hall"" just next to it, showing the world war 2 history, great to visit too... Museum is free entry."
211,Memorial of Nanjing Massacre,This memorial to a dreadful event is striking in its elegance and its reverence. This is not a shrine to hatred or revenge but is a quite beautiful site to remember mans inhumanity to man. To understand China... the events behind this memorial are one of the elements that has driven the country.
212,Important site to see,"As an expat who actually lives and teaches in China, I see and hear racist comments from my students (who are college age) against the nation of Japan from time to time. I’m not here to say whether that’s right or wrong, but it shows the deep-seated, inherited unwillingness to forgive the war crimes done to the Chinese... that you don’t really hear about from other nationals who were oppressed during this tumultuous part of history. I say all that because, I was expecting a certain level of anti-Japan propaganda to be hidden-in-plain-sight at the museum. But it simply wasn’t there! In fact, as I walked through the halls I saw monuments representing peace and forgiveness. I saw records of Japanese diplomats saying they need forgiveness. The museum is truly breath-taking, everyone who has an opportunity should go... I felt a true sense of camaraderie with the country of China and the land that has become home to me… which made it that much more upsetting when several of the guests disrespected the monument. American teenagers joking and talking loudly, Chinese citizens spitting and having snow ball fights, talking in the areas that ask for silence and respect… and I ask myself, ‘how can I be reverent on this hallowed ground and Chinese nationals not be?’ This behavior is commonplace in museums, but this is a memorial. It’s truly heartbreaking..."
213,Worth the visit,Its a journey of sadness & how wars had rear its ugly head. The atrocities that was displayed during the invasion brings tears & emotion to anyone visiting this site. Get a good tour guide to give you a good commentary as when crowds are heavy you may not be able to read the translation indicated in the display or photos. Not too be missed when in Nanjing. Cherish Peace.
214,A must see in Nanjing,"It's a sad place, it's a grim experience, it's very graphic.All to be expected from a massacre memorial."
215,Memorial Hall,"This modern and remarkably well-conceived museum is a fitting memorial to the 300,000 residents of the city murdered by the Japanese in Nanjing in 1937 and 1938.  The exhibits are compelling and include English translations.  There are moving memorial sites and sculptures on the grounds.  This is the Chinese version of America's Holocaust Museum and was one of the best museums we visited in China."
216,very severe and impressive,"The memorial is very well done, informing, and respectful. If ever in Nanjing it’s worth the time to stop by! It’s free. There are indoor and outdoor parts to walk through and very good English translations."
217,A must go if you visit Nanjing,"For students of history or for that matter anybody with the interest and knowledge of this Massacre at Nanjing it is a must visit. Beautifully laid out memorial in memory of the more than 300,000 people who were massacred, butchered, raped and killed, a truly moving experience."
218,Must learn from the past,"It seems to me that many in the West don't know what went on in China prior to the start of WW2. Set in a sombre, underground building, surrounded by a respectfully grassed graveyard you get to see & read about events that occurred in Nanjing. The photographs are vivid & reading the horrifying testimonies sends a shudder down your spine. An eye opening look at evil."
219,Sobering experience & makes you wonder what people goes though,"The closest place I can compare this memorial to in the US is Pearl Harbor.  It details the invasion of China by the Japanese in 1938.  The memorial is well laid out, particularly the excavation that is left as a display.  Not for the faint of heart."
220,"Never forget the history, and never forget those who died.","I went there on a Tuesday in April, and it was fairly crowded because it looked like there were a few field trips going on. I was happy to find that there was a place to store your bags and to rent an audio tour. The museum progresses in one direction so that everyone is going the same way. The museum itself was very informative on the subject (even without the audio tour), but I'm not sure it would be suitable for very young children as it can be a bit graphic.I had learned about World War 2 in school, but no one ever mentioned what Japan did to China. It is definitely a dose of reality to remember what humans can do to each other. The last and biggest message of the museum is that of peace. I feel that this is fitting because I feel that in the face of that tragedy, the Chinese had every right to retaliate, but they chose peace instead. If you are in Nanjing I recommend this as a ""must visit"" place to see. You will feel a deeper connection to the Chinese people and understand more why they are the way they are now."
221,Go early because it's too crowded,"As a ww2 geek and especially the pacific theatre, since they do not teach this in Europe at all apart from few sling events, I took some classes in university about Japan's campaign. The memorial was really educational and made in a style that invoked a lot of emotions. Great visual and musical information what has happened. The style of building and statues are well fitting to the sad events. If you are in Nanjing, this is a must see."
222,You won't forget this visit,"I knew about the Nanjing Massacre, but many Chinese youngsters do not. Some of them are crazy with Japanese stars.    My guide took me to the museum on my first day of visit. Good idea. The lay out can be frightening like the poor man who was so chopped up that his head and hand are several feet from one another.    I did not have to pay an entrance fees altough I am from overseas. THe Chinese respects elders.    Never forget the past. Never forget who you are!If you do not learn from the past, you are likely to repeat your mistakes again."
223,Well worth a visit,A very interesting part of China's history. So so very sad. Hugh walls of pictures of those who survived & died. Monuments as You are walking in. No guide needed unless you want in depth explanations. We walked around ourselves. Worth a visit.
224,Memories of the Massacre,Excellent to see a memorial to a bad time in history.  Makes us conscious of the fact that the human spirit is resilient in face of cruelty.
225,Forgivable but unforgettable,A solemn place. Lots of statues to depict the suffering of the Japanese victims. A special exhibit devoted the non Chinese hero's who helped. An big model of an excation site. Very meaningful as I wrote a book of the world war two in Borneo
226,Important history of Nanjing China,"Very well-done, and very worthwhile.This museum has an impact partly because it is so understated and matter-of-fact in telling the story of what happened.  I appreciated the personal aspect of what is presented (i.e. the pictures of survivors, and the pictures of victims, so personalities are attached to the stories).  There are eye-witness accounts from not only Chinese residents but also western residents of Nanjing.  (Nanjing at the time had one of the largest number of foreign residents of any city in China).   I had known about the massacre from previous reading, but was not aware of the role that the foreign residents played in protecting a significant number of the Chinese citizens in the city.This museum was one of the main reasons I visited Nanjing.  While in Nanjing, I had a private tour guide for some of the time, but it was interesting to me that I had to be quite persistent with the guide to get this on the planned itinerary.  For some reason she felt this would not be of interest to a western tourist, which is entirely incorrect.  Highly recommended."
227,Very impactful,"The moment I walked in, the museum gave me chills. It's such an horrifying event and reading the stories of survivors left me with many different emotions. If you want to know the brutal history of the city you are visiting, go there. If you love history, go there. Just go there everyone."
228,History of Nanjing,"Unforgettable. Well  designed. English translation available. An important place in the history of Nanjing, China and of the Westeners who established the International Safety Zone and saved over 200,000 Chinese civilians."
229,Excellent,Excellent presentation with very skillfully produced statues. Another poignant reminder of the horrors of war
230,Important part of history China - Japan,"After coming out from exit 2, you will have to cross a small street and line up for baggage scanning before entering to the museum. At this point, it is a good idea to go there on weekdays due to less traffic. If you visit the place on weekend, you will have to wait in line longer, which could possibly take you almost 30 mins before passing the entrance .The museum has a very good design both indoor and outdoor. Also, it is very informative that you can spend around three hours there. Especially if you are a historicaholic like me, you can spend more than half a day there. (I watched a documentary film, Nanjing 2007 and decided to come to Nanjing). The cruelty I learned from the exhibition is not something that we can ever imagine. Anyway, the museum is a very good place to learn history of the World War.As the museum has both indoor and outdoor area, you should bring an umbrella with you just in case it rains."
231,Sobering and Moving,It's not for the faint of heart.   It's like visiting a concentration camp.   However we all need to know the ills of our history so it's never repeated.   It may affect your mood for the rest of the day though so be prepared.
232,Sobering,"very severe and impressive place, full of respect for massacred people, and with complete historical documentation"
233,Nice and modern,"Whoever heard the name of Nanjing, I guess the first thing in mind is the Nanjing Massacre.  So this is a must visit place.  This museum is designed in a way that you first walk through a road with statues that makes visitors feel how pain and horrible the massacre was.  There is a lot of information inside the museum, not only the whole incident from Japanese army intruded Nanjing to China won the war; but there is also how Nanjing victims were treated during that time, and the foreigners' life in this episode.    Although it's a massacre museum, it doesn't exhibit anything visually horrible.  So it is ok to bring the kids along. The museum is next to the subway station, very convenient to go."
234,The aggression of Japan,"If you are interested in history at all, this is a must visit in Nanjing. First of all, the building itself is interesting both inside and out. The displays and statues are clear and meaningful. I left the museum feeling like I knew a lot more of the Japanese occupation of China history but I also didn't feel like the museum was just Japanese bashing. I felt that it delivers a message of peace."
235,Pondering History,"If you visit Nanjing for any reason, you should take the time to visit this memorial. It is at once beautifully wrought and overwhelmingly sad. The Japanese invasion of China during WWII was horrific and Nanjing suffered a great deal at their brutality. This is a good place to visit alone or with no time constraints where you can wander at your own pace. I suggest bringing headphones and some soothing music, as the throngs of people can be quite noisy."
236,Nanjing Genocide,"It's hard to see the atrocities that were done to Nanjing people. The museum is designed in a very tasteful way,  the only bad thing is the crowds, a bit overwhelming."
237,A bit of history,"Well presented significant chapter in Nanjing history, with story unraveling in a sequence throughout the rooms. Ample english explanations for each exhibit. Very heavy but interesting. Unfortunately:- the crowds are out of control, badly managed, meaning that it is extremely hard to see the exhibits and read the descriptions.- the exit is in a very different place from the entry to the museum complex which means to get back to the Metro station you need to walk along the main road for quite a while."
238,free of charge,"Very well organised and well thought through, gives a very detailed narrative of the impact of the invasion and the suffering of the people. Signs to observe silence are everywhere, but if you visit on a weekend, local tourists arrive by the busloads, and it's impossible to catch a break for some quiet. Still, a must visit if you're in Nanjing."
239,"Somber, Solemn and Sadness","A sobering reminder of the horrors of war, with exhibits of the massacre. A good place to visit to see what Nanjing went through."
240,Emotional and impressive,"The importance place to visit, not just a part of history of China. But, the importance of future.  ""Frindly reminder, don't step or walk on the white stone!!!"""
241,Nice architecture and concept planning of the space,This is an impressive memorial to the universal inhumanity of war. The care and thought put into the layout evokes the proper horror and humility that comes from the barbarity of mankind at its worst.
242,this is a must visit place  to completer your Nanjing Trip,"Nanjing was the capital of China once, an ancient old city but now unfortunately best known for the gruesome atrocities perpetrated by the Japanese in the so called Nanjing Massacre in December 1937. It is easy to get there by subway line 2, Yunjinlu station exit 2. Cross the road and you are there. There is no entrance fee. The museum and area are quite large, it will take about 3 hours for a comfortable visit.First some of the outside monuments and then the exhibition hall. Many photo's, videos and exhibits that give a good idea (although it beats any imagination) of what took place. After that there is a walk along the grounds with the eternal flame and the peace statue. You exit at the other side and it is a bit of a walk back to the subway station (about 900 meters).Places like these should be kept for all of us to be reminded of what the human is capable of."
243,Great museum to visit in Nanjing,A very honourable tribute to those who were killed by the Japanese during the Nanjing Massacre. A must-see if you go to Nanjing.
244,The Reason for My Visit to Nanjing,"Incredible memorial that describes the Nánjīng Massacre in vivid detail. Details everything that happened leading up to, during, and after the event. Not to be missed."
245,Sad & Beautiful History Museum,"Not child suitable at all - glad we didn't take ours!A hugely important testimony to a dreadful atrocity, but I left feeling that the presentation, message and enduring messages had little to do with humanity and an awful lot to do with ugly contemporary politics and prejudice. I have witnessed eerily shocking testaments and warnings about the evil of humans elsewhere which appear to have been successfully divorced from contemporary political agendas. Perhaps for this reason, I was left emotionally numb, where I know that I am capable of extreme emotional responses in other locations.Judge for yourself, but be sure to know where your next smile is coming from... This is not fun!"
246,"""Just not nice to see""","In certain aspects this place is like China's version of Auschwitz--or Pearl Harbor. I had always wanted to come here after reading Iris Chang's book about the Japanese wartime atrocities in Nanjing. I expected a small, sombre site with not very much to see. In fact this is a first-class museum in terms of China wartime relics and historical documents relating to the then Nationalist government, the Japanese invasion, the setting up of the Safety Zone by Western and Chinese residents of Nanjing (including even the German John Rabe, a Nazi party member), and, of course, the crimes against humanity committed by the Japanese army. If you are into wartime history this place is a must-see. The atmosphere of the city walls are expertly re-created with almost Disney-like flair in terms of lighting and sound effects. The exhibits are fascinating but with the way things are laid out it is often difficult to see everything when the crowds are heavy. Once outside the main museum area there are vast outdoor spaces with nothing but rocks; it's incredibly stark and looks like you are on some alien planet. You follow a set path that leads to structures built atop pits where human skeletal remains were found years ago. There are also very dark galleries lit only by small light sources. A lot of walking is involved throughout the complex and the mood changes from being in a museum to being in a tomb. Go early in the morning if you can in order to avoid the crowds. I will stop short of comparing this place to Auschwitz in terms of genocide, but the count of 300,000 fatalities during the Nanjing Massacre ranks it as one of the single worst wartime events in human history. If you are in Nanjing this is a must-see."
247,Very enlightening,"First, do not go on a crowded day - it ruins the otherwise somber setting. Second, be respectful - this represents one of the worst atrocities committed by the Japanese military against innocent Chinese civilians in World War II, which was significantly longer for China than for the West (14 years of war overall, 8 of which engulfed the entire country). The number 300,000 is the Chinese government's official death toll, although scholarly figures from other countries may differ a bit. This site includes several unearthed mass graves, in which skeletons of the deceased are left partially buried and detailed descriptions showing probable causes of death are nearby. There is a recent exhibit outside the museum that is on WWII as a whole (this sort of exhibit can be seen in many cities). Also keep in mind that this type of site is increasingly important for the Chinese government's patriotic education."
248,"A sad but Impressive place, Worth a visit.","As sad as this time in history is, it's so nice to see that there is a museum dedicated to it. Many know of what occurred in Europe during WW2, but few are aware of the acts committed by the Imperial Army during the Japanese occupation.Allot ~2 hours for this if you plan on reading into as much of the displays as possible while there. English translations are quite strong."
249,Moving,"It feels a bit awkward to praise a memorial/museum for its presentation, especially when the subject matter is so horrifying, but the Nanjing memorial tells the story like few others do. The history of the war, the invasion, personal accounts of the atrocities, and the aftermath, are all presented utilizing striking architecture and innovative multimedia. The only negative is that there is some unnecessary repetition. Still, this is a sobering exhibit worthy of your time in China."
250,A Must-see in Nanjing,"This is one of the places you should visit if you come to Nanjing.Very interesting about what happened here during World War II.The exhibition is structured in an informative way and deals with the many different areas that this massacre contains, ie the Japanese behavior, misinformation, volunteers who try to save people, stories from survivors etc."
251,Excellent while also overwhelming,The memorial of the Nanjing massacre is a really interesting place to learn about the plight of the Chinese people during the occupation by Japan.The complex is quite large and very well done. The displays are all in English so it was very easy to follow and we spent about 2 hours walking through the complex and learning about the history of this period. Overall it was a very moving but important place to visit.
252,Must visit museum - unsuitable for small children,"We were specifically visited Nanjing because want to see this Memorial that one of famous memorial around China.  It was a packed of people inside there especially chinese visitors. The situation inside memorial was 70% dark. Some of people bring flowers and China flags. Many sad pictures, paintings, written letter, books, facts, video, testimonials, graves, statue, etc about the history. For young generations it's a must visit place that they can learn how war is never good for humanity. The entry cost is Free of Charge. Lighter is not allowed. Bring your own food and drink. I spent almost 1 hour to visited this memorial. My concern only to Chinese visitors because they were noisy and the toilet was the worst ever."
253,"Can be forgiven, BUT not forgotten.",An amazingly moving tribute to the many innocent who lost their lives . The whole museum is truly inspiring and humbling . The bronze statues to honour those who lost loved ones and suffered are amazing crafted and one can't help buy be moved . Everything has been done with so much detail and respect . Anyone that loves China should visit and pay their respects
254,Very factual and visual.,As an avid advocate of peace the monument stands witness of what humans can do to humans under orders of animals. I am ashamed and fearful looking at this reminder of the atrocities of WWII. Let’s work to educate the people and the world that war is ugly. Let’s work and promote peace.
255,A must visit  to understand the recent history of Nanjing.,Historical. Make sure u plan more time here. A must place to go. Take you abt half a day to complete the place.
256,Such a sad Place,"The Memorial and museum present excellent and balanced views of the massacre and what we in the west call World War II. The exhibits are compelling with title cards in English. It's hard to fathom the extent of the evil. Countering that are the stories of the people, like John Rabe, Minnie Vautrin, John Magee, and others, who put themselves in extreme peril to save as many as possible."
257,Great insight about the Nanjing massacre,"This is a powerful memorial  that commemorates a dark moment in Chinese history - the infamous Rape of Nanking atrocity committed by the Japanese in World War 2. Words can't really do the horrors justice, but this exhibit stands as a reminder."
258,"Impressive, touching, with a hint of propaganda.","Hallowed ground for Chinese people this museum is built upon the site of a mass grave from the massacre, the remains of which you can see. The small museum is informative and multilingual, so if you’re unsure of the history behind Sino-Japanese antagonism then take your time to read everything. It gets crowded but try to be respectful, for many Chinese people coming here is almost like a pilgrimage."
259,Really worthwhile but crowded,"A deeply moving and thought provoking memorial. One of the more significant events in a very troubled century in China, the ""Rape of Nanking"" is excellently presented in both Chinese and English. A mixture of photos, stories, sculptures, gardens and places for reflection as well as an actual excavation. You will only need 1-2 hours, so go there (Yunjin Lu line 2) and experience the Chinese equivalent of Auschwitz. We were impressed that, while the memorial did not pull any punches, it was not overtly anti-Japanese, more a testament to the horror that man can inflict on man and the consequences of indiscipline in war. Not suitable for children."
260,Sad place,"The"" Massacre of Nanking "" as meticulously documented in this Memorial not only pays tribute to the 300,000 victims, but it reminds the whole world what the Japanese military  did to millions of civilians in China and Asia a generation or two ago. It is a lesson on the terror of war  that the world should never forget  . The exhibits demonstrated the worst and the best of humanity. In the midst of death and carnage, a few foreigners such as John Rabe struggled to set up  safety zones, which ultimately saved the lives of possibly 200,000 civilians. In the large square outside the memorial hall, there are lots of tress planted by visitors from different countries, including many delegations of former soldiers and civilians from Japan after the war, who recognised and apologized for the death and suffering that the Japanese military brought to the Chinese people, and vowed to never allow such tragic event to ever occur again. This is a positive message that is so important and relevant. The Chinese people  may forgive the perpetrators of the atrocities, but they will not forget this darkest period in their long history"
261,Composite of many Holocaust museums,"I'm not sure what it is to be honest, but I didn't feel like this memorial was as impactful as I had hoped it to be. I went in expecting to cry buckets like I did at the 9/11 memorial but felt like it fell short on the actual accounts of people. The memorial to me felt like a really dry wikipedia article. All of the poster boards had very generic information on it and some with REALLY bad English translations. For something that's sponsored by the government and for a subject that carries such magnitude, I didn't feel like the government put all that much work into it.  And echoing the same sentiments from a few other reviewers here, the museum was WAY too overcrowded. They let too many people in at once and that really ruins the experience. I think this is something everyone should see at least once if they happen to be in Nanjing, but don't have your hopes up."
262,Good place to understand the history of Nanjing,"This Memorial is a moving place, a reminder of man's inhumanity in times of war. Any person would be moved by the images, the excavated remains, and the inspiration of those who survived it, and the group of westerns who risked their own lived to protect the less fortunate. The shrines are fit for the suffering not only of the victims but the survivors."
263,"upsetting, but absolutely memorable","The massacre memorial takes a modern design, housing important historical information in a poignant establishment. Statues depicting the suffering of victims are built on the walkway leading to the entrance; they aren't bloodstained-like but artistic and do lend the visitors the perspective of the sufferers. I particularly like that. The tour should take about 2-3 hours with lots of documents, photos and many other exhibit items to look at. I recommend to hit the place early in the morning before crowd coming in. I didn't get to see many of the exhibits due to massive crowd during my visit. It's open Tues-Sun, 830am-430pm."
264,Airy Experience,"Pros: comprehensive (if brutal) information about the Nanjing Massacre and the relevant historical context of the period; free; air-conditioned; information provided in English. Cons: Poorly curated (for the average visitor, it would feel like somebody took a year's syllabus worth of study materials and just threw it at you)."
265,Sombre,"I write this review only as a word of caution.That being said, there are two parts to the entire grounds of the complex. The forst part of the complex is what most visitors want to see and to visit to pay their respects to the dead. It was raining really hard and the lines were really long! A pleasant man told my wife and others that there is a back way into the complex. For only 30 RMB each, he wold be able to bring us inside the museum much quicker. We followed him and he took us and some other Chinese tourists to a back way. We paid the 30 RMB each and then went inside. He didn't give us tickets or anything. We walked through the gates and then entered what we thought was the museum. Actually it was another section of the complex that hosted a very thorough and informative display of the history surrounding Wolrd War II. It was very fair and balanced with a number of original artifacts and reproductions of famous events after the war had ended. This really gave me an alternative viewpoint of the unfolding of the events. Most of the displays were in English as well as Chinese. The thrust of the museum is that the Chinese resistance were the first to fight against the Axis powers. I won't debate that here in this forum. but suffice it to say that the contributions of other countries around the world were somewhat downplayed. We spent about 2 hours in this section of the complex.We asked how to get to the other section of the complex. The fenced gates have other entrances to the memorial blocked with CCTV coverage, To get to the other side of the complex, you must go to the main gate and ""fight"" your way to the main entrance.The takeaway is that you cannot buy your way into the memorial at all, so by wary of anyone who says they can get you in ahead of the crowds. There is no Disneyland fast pass to see the rest of the museum. I look forward to my next visit so that I can actually see the insides of the memorial."
266,The most poignant museum ever visit,"From the moment I stepped on the grounds of this Memorial I was filled with emotion.  The series of sculpture that lead you to the entrance are unforgettable.  They capture the very essence of pain, sadness, terror, separation of loved ones, and most of all despair.Inside the Memorial there were displays of the torture instruments, photos that document one of the great atrocities against the Chinese by the Japanese and much, much more.This Memorial is unnerving, it clearly depicts man's inhumanity to man.  You won't forget this visit."
267,"Haunting, but incredibly interesting","Very well maintained memorial, with informative displays and artefacts detailing the inhumane war crimes the Japanese Imperial Army committed during their invasion of China in WW2."
268,Depressing History Presented in an Unforgettable Setting,This is the hallowed ground where the mass grave was found. The museum was built at the site where the bombing took place. The museum was very well done to show case the cruelty of war and the sufferings of the innocents. The massacre was not well known outside of the Asia region. It is a must visit.
269,History and Experience,"The large exhibition has many old photos and videos from survivors. However, knowing many exhibition from the holocaust, this museum provides not sufficient information about what really happened. Some of the exhibition are replicas with mannequins."
270,Intense but a must-see place in terms of WWII-era history,"Arrived into Nanjing on the bullet train from Wuxi. Arrived into Nanjing station and headed for the metro to get to the Museum for the Massacre memorial for the Japanese invasion. Easy to negotiate on the metro line Entry here is free and there was no queues to enter, however my daughter visited in April and queued for 2 hours. Worth a visit if you are in the city simply for the historical context. Really moving experience"
271,Somber and very intense memorial museum,"This is of course a sobering reminder of an unpleasant time - but it is also interesting and informative.  Even if you already know about the events memorialized (there have been several movies, etc.), there are sure to be some details that you hadn't heard...  and of course to actually be there adds some perspective.  You should allow at least an hour to see everything - probably more."
272,Well done,"Metro, line 2, to Yunjin Road.This is a Museum dedicated to the memory of the 300,000 Chinese people, many of the civilians, who died in Nanjing during the Japanese invasion in 1937/38. Much of the content is explicit and very disturbing. I would not bring young children or anyone else who is easily upset. There is an outdoor park area which is simply and tastefully laid out and a large indoor museum which tells the story, from the lead up, through the attack on Nanjing, the atrocities committed after the city fell, the aftermath and the war-crimes trials. This profoundly depressing exhibition does however end on an optimistic note.Much documentary evidence is on display, including photos (including those of people who died), diaries (Chinese, Japanese and foreign), contemporary newspapers etc. that support the narrative the museum is intended to convey. The museum will take around two hours to see thoroughly. Most of the information is also in English and translations of the main documents are provided.This is top of the Nanjing ‘must see’ list."
273,All rules of war were broken,"Beautiful sculptures, eloquent poetry and a heart wrenching story, of a dark, less well known chapter, of 20th century brutality.A rainy day, only served to add to the poignancy and the sombre mood."
274,Learning about Chinese History,"The memorial is an engaging presentation of the massacre during WWII by Japanese soldiers against the Chinese population of Nanjing.  The tone is set with the statues in front of the museum representing the survivors of the multi-day massacre.  It is enhanced when you walk into the hall and see the exposed burial pits with the skeletons of the victims.  Further into the museum exhibits illustrate the mood of the time between the two countries and with the world as a whole.  Don't miss the moving interviews with the survivors.  Allocate a good 90 minutes to see the museum.Pros:  Moving, engaging, informative exhibits.Cons: A good amount has English translations but not enough."
275,Eye-opening but very poor crowd control,"This museum is based upon the Japanese invasion of Nanjing, the then capital of China in 1937.  An extremely tragic moment for the Nanjing people and China’s recent history with amazing historical detail and visuals which makes it a very moving and terribly sad experience.  This museum had and a lot more than I expected, brace yourself!"
276,Important history lessons learnt,"Easily accessible by Subway, Line 2, Yunjin Road, Take Exit 2. Entry is free and Open from Tuesday to Sat from 8:00am to 5:30pm (Closed on Monday)The massacre is documented with detailed records, objects and incredible photographs, all with English explanation. Follow the advised exit route through the various memorials, Graveyard, the final water and monument after the main exhibition area.A remembrance of the cruel incident and a lesson for us.Came out with mixed feelings and a heavy heart."
277,Impressive,"Which nation was the most aggressive during the Second World War? It is very difficult to answer. I do not want to make any prejudice about nations, but Japan is kinda in competition for this title. Not for children at all."
278,History depicted artistically,"This museum documents the atrocities that were committed against the people of Nanjing in 1937. The museum is not very big and can be covered within a couple of hours. There are a few sections - the war itself, the heroes who defended against the Japanese, the post war trial, etc.A trip to Nanjing will not be complete without visiting this place. As one of the survivors commented, ""remember history, but not with hatred"".As we visited during the October holidays, the wait to get in took close to 45 minutes at opening time. We were told by the guards that the wait is usually 15-30 minutes on a normal day."
279,Respectfully designed & impressive experience,"I did not know very much about the Nanjing Massacre. I heard more about the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.My visit have definitely helped me learn and understand more.Not just the historical aspect, but the human and emotional aspects.It is a visit I would recommend to everybody, especially the Chinese (local and foreign) and Japanese."
280,"A bit heavy, but quite interesting","Memorial to highlight how bad we humans can be at times to each other....not the happiest place to enjoy a visit, but local Chinese explanation as to why they visit so much is understandable."
281,History don't lie!,"A real look into the history of Nanjing in WW2 with the invasion of the Japanese Imperial Army. I didn't feel like there was much (if any) propaganda put forward like there are at some other similar destinations in China, and from the research I had done prior to heading here, the facts put forward didn't seem exaggerated or misinformed.There are some confronting exhibits and photographs, including an excavated area from a mass grave from the war.One of the most interesting memorials I have been to."
282,A truely humbling experience,"A reminder of cruel history of Nanjing on Japanese massacre right before 2nd world war. A history to be learnt and felt. I have read about this massacre in history books. But visiting this place has given me the same somber feeling I have had from my trip to Hiroshima peace memorial. What an irony!!If you are in Nanjing, take some time to visit this place.."
283,An exceptional museum,"Very beautiful sculptures and building build to commemorate the sad history of Nanjing. It is easily accessible from the city centre, since it's' located just outside of a metro station."
284,One of the best,I respect people who defend their countries during the war and It’s very sad when you see what happens to people and their lives during a war.  You can learn about the war that happened between China and Japan in 1936 ( not sure about the year though) and I guess it’s the original place that the war really happened as you can see the bones that have been buried there. I am not personally interested to see anything related to wars as I hate wars but my friends wanted to visit the place so it happened. I won’t put this place on top of my list and I’ll go there if I have some extra time to kill. There are some areas outside covered with stones and you need to walk through before entering to the place so wear comfortable shoes.
285,Worthwhile for both the architecture and the history,"The Memorial Hall stands on the top of the biggest burial sites of the victims. The outdoor exhibition area displaces sculptures, relief carvings, and a large wall listing the names of victims.  The interior houses sheltered skeletal remains of victim, as well as a hall where exhibits historical records, documents and photographs. The invading Japanese soldiers killed unarmed common people, elderly, women and children..........Crimes could be forgiven, but history should not be forgotten.There have been so many wars in the history of mankind. People are always fighting for power, fame and wealth....... No more wars. Pray for peace."
286,Must visit,Beautiful and very moving tribute to the multitudes who lost their lives in what was one of the saddest tragedies in 20th century history.
287,Moving and inspiring,"This superb memorial museum quietly understates the most unspeakable horrors of war. No jingoism, no extraordinary claims."
288,Interesting visit,"The place is supper big with many thing to discover, you will get your feet tired here.It likes everything is a live, they measured the different between China and Japan in the war, very interesting."
289,Very sad,"This is very interesting and symbolic place in Nanjing. The main part is a monument of 300,000 killed Chinese people before WWII. It is quite depressing, but very peaceful experience. However I much more like the museum of WWII - it is really huge, includes lots of materials and exhibits. Suggest to visit."
290,Beautiful Memorial,"One of the most tell-tale memorials that depicts the one-month ""rape"" of Nanjing under the hands of the Japanese empire.The museum is well designed and lays out the atrocities of the time.  It is really one of the events leading up to world war 2 that does not see much light in other books but is as vicious as any of the crimes committed during that time.This is a must-see memorial in Nanjing.  The final message is of peace which is what we must strive for and a note to the visitors that we cannot condemn the present Japanese society for the atrocities laid out by the past empire.Remember them, never forget, and learn from this."
291,An Emotionally Powerful Exhibit,A lesson in the brutality of war. The Chinese government uses this sad chapter of history to stoke the fires of nationalism.
292,Collage trip ,"A fitting memorial to the 300000 men, women and children massacred from 13December 1937 until January 1938.  The memorial exhibits historical records and objects, and uses architecture,  sculptures and videos to illustrate what happened during the Nanjing massacre. The memorial consists of 3 major parts: outdoor exhibits, sheltered skeletal remains of victims, and an exhibition hall of historical documents.  Outdoor exhibits include statues,sculptures, relief carvings, tablets, and a large wall listing the names of victims, as well as an atonement tablet and memorial walkway. The skeletal remains of massacre victims are exhibited in a coffin shaped display hall were excavated from Jiangdongmen in 1985.  The exhibition hall contains more than 1000 items related to the massacre - photographs, objects, charts, immense collection of pictures."
293,Impressive memorial for this tragic event - must visit.,"If you cherish peace, come visit the Nanjing Memorial and see the horror and atrocities of war.  Be prepared, photos here are graphic with brutality.  My wife and I visited here during the Lunar New Year holidays, so it was quite crowded as everywhere here in China is during the Spring Festival.  However, the wait and the crowds were worth it.  The estimate is that 300,000 souls were murdered in a week in December 1937.  They must not be forgotten and this memorial does a fitting job keeping their memory and sacrifice alive.  Work and pray for peace."
294,Well worth seeing.,"Similar to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., the Massacre Museum provides history of a tragic time in China.  Definitely worth the visit.  I recently moved to Nanjing and I did not know anything about this time in history.  I had heard of the Rape of Nanking but was unaware of what actually happened.  The Museum is very somber yet beautiful and is a good reminder of why events like this cannot happen again (even though they have and still do.)"
295,Very interesting and informative,"The Memorial of the Nanjing Massacre is a well-kept open museum dedicated to the rape of Nanjing in 1937-38. It's a sad place, with graphic visualizations of the atrocities committed by the Japanese. It is one of the few places in Nanjing where everything is translated into English. Well worth the visit, especially during one of the many rainy days. The memorial can be rather crowded. Further, the information provided is extremely skewed. The rape of Nanjing is quite a contested issue, with a wide range of estimates about the death toll. Nonetheless, the memorial pays the grimmest possible picture and does not provide any information on how other accounts of the rape of Nanking differ from the one provided. I have no intention of downplaying what happened in Nanking, whether 30,000, 300,000 or more people died is - in any case - a tragic event that should never be forgotten. Despite this, I would have liked the place more if it would have provided more nuanced information. I indeed felt like I was reading government propaganda much of the time."
296,One of the best museum I have even been,"this is a place where Chinese people created to remember the things which Japanese army done to them, its a very creative museum with making very sad mode to us. Japanese people killed thousands of Chinese people who lived at Nanjing....this is total free of charge and remember to bring a flower to put there as a respect.."
297,"Impressive and emotional but needed more time, a very moving account of history","In absence of the write up of the atrocity committed by Japanese army in Nanjing , this place serves an important reminder to the world that Peace is priceless but is so fragile not to be taken lightly."
298,Crowded but atmospheric,"Remembering the horrors of the brutal massacre, by Japanese invaders, of about 300,000 Chinese military and civilians who had surrendered and put down their weapons. During the ensuing weeks, the Japanese soldiers looted and ravaged Nanjing and raped 20,000 Chinese women."
299,Stunningly Stark,"Covering before, during and after the massacre in Nanjing of 300,000+ men, women and children by Japanese forces on the eve of World War 2,  this is an exceptional museum. One of the best museums covering a historical event in the world. Well laid out over a large but easy to follow area. A must if you visit this historical town!"
