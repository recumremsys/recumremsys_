0,Just beautiful!,"You can walk,up and down the pass, by the seashore, beautiful cliffs and wooded area. Also, suspension bridges,over the coast, observing Ohshima - in Japanese,means a big island - and a nice light-house that enables you to view mountain side of the area, including Mount Omuro.. Very nice and comforting to roam, looking at the ocean out there and listening to the birds."
1,Nice slightly challenging hike with amazing views of the rocky coast,"This area is very beautiful and perfect for small and longer walks. Along the coast there are many view points and passages down to the sea. Where, I guess it should be possible to take a swim during summer? Remember to bring GPS if on a longer walks!"
2,Jogasaki coast ,"You can go onto the long suspension bridge to stretch to the horizon. The sea view is wonderful. When you walk from the station (around 20 minutes) , there are some small shops , cafe too."
3,Breezy!,"The hike along the Jogasaki coast is highly recommended, great views of a beautiful rocky coastline. You can hike all the way between the fishermen’s village and Futo station - possible to swim or snorkel along the way (rocky access that requires some climbing). I wore hiking sandals but I did come across some snakes so probably not the best choice..."
4,Swim and hike the beautiful coast,"This is a nice, easy 3km hike along the coastline on tree covered trail. You get to enjoy the lava formations and beautiful view of the ocean and cliffs. Perfect for a day trip from Ito taking the buses offered with the 'Free Ito Pass'."
5,Scenic views over a suspension bridge,"Like the highway I in California, the beach provides a walking trail to get close encounter of the ocean, beautiful scenic trail. Easy to handle and great for families to have fun time and lovers to make vows before the nature."
6,Spectacular coastal walk,"We stayed on the jogasaki coast and it is beautiful. You must do the two suspension bridge 10k hike but it is not for beginners or those with mobility issues. Some parts are quite steep, the path is overgrown and the terrain is uneven. It's a fabulous hike if you're able. From Jogasaki there is a car park and vending machines with water etc but there's nothing from about the end of the first mile so bear that in mind. If you end in Izu-Kogen there's loads of nice places for lunch."
7,Great Views of the Pacific Ocean,"Coast views are unique. Views are stunning. Special vegitation and rock formations made the walk well worthwhile. In 5 km we met < 10 other walkers. You will need good shoes and the 5 km feels like 10 km, by the time you've been up and down 200 steps and uneven paths. Take your own picnic - there is nothing till you get to the lighthouse from the South end and nothing after the lighthouse from the North."
8,Nice spot to see the cliffs and rocky coastline,"Beautiful scenic views with a lighthouse available to wander up and enjoy the scenery. Nice walk through the area, much quieter than the hustle and bustle of other areas of Japan."
9,gorgeous during nice weather,The forest coastal path takes in the fishing village as well as swirling sea scapes and rock formations. Hunting birds swoop over the waves and the swing bridges are engineering marvels.
10,Charming nature trial with stunning views,"Recommended to visit and explore the coastline and Light House there.  There is 2 parking areas, if you care to walk a little longer or just track back to other parking area. The views are magnificient and worth your time to explore.  I think the views will be even better once the autumn colours start to come out."
11,Cliffs and spectacular views of the rocky coast.,The larva formed rocks and coast are so beautiful. Feel very easy and relax in this national park. Really enjoyed.
12,Lovely sedate walk,"Views of the jagged coastline,  wild pacific,  fishing people,and a long hiking path (10km) if you're up for it."
13,Pleasant and easy hike using public transport to get there,"This is a popular walking area for tourists as the trails meander through wooded areas and also by the cliffs along the coast. Nice views, a lighthouse to visit (free) and cafes to relieve thirst and hunger."
14,Beautiful walk ,"The many trails upon reaching the main area and the lighthouse are easy to follow and walk along. Some other areas, because of the uneven lava rock, it's important to have good footwear. Sandals and flip flops aren't recommended if you want to climb down on the rock, closer to the waves. There is no cost to enter this park area, and yet it's breathtaking and mesmerizing."
15,Breathtaking views,"you can hike with seeing beautiful Pacific Ocean.hiking road is not so hard, but you have to put on the suitable shoes for hiking."
16,"Natural, Clean and Beautiful","A very nice walk from the train station to the cliffs. A clearly market path winds its way along the cliff side coast, through beautiful pine trees, across a few suspension bridges, and a few spots to climb down to the waters edge. a wonderful experience and a nice break from the big cities."
17,Spectecular coast,"Scenic hike along the coast. Not easy to find swimming areas but there is a swimming hole where you can jump off the cliff! To get to the swimming area, get off at the Jogasaki Kaigan station and follow the sign for the hiking course. We saw locals snorkeling there as well. There are lots of museums and places where you can make glass beads jewelry, pottery, etc."
18,Beautiful scenery ,"Side trip from Izu by car. Near the parking is an old temple which is worth looking at. From the parking you walk along the road as the beach is private and requires a fee, to the beginning of the trail. You can make a loop by taking the path along the coast (many stairs) to the lighthouse and the forest walk (shorter and more even) back. During the walk you have fantastic views of the cliffs and the ocean. Near the lighthouse you will find a suspension bridge. You are free to climb the stairs of the lighthouse and the view is worth the modest climb.As usual free and clean toilets available and some snack outlets."
19,Dramatic Coastal Views,"There’s a 10km hiking trail along the entire coastline, which I would mark moderate as there are rugged trail terrains on some bits. The trail overlooks the cliffs and rock formations. The main lighthouse and Kadowakizaki Suspension Bridge is the most popular area, overrun with tourists and visitors but still worth a visit.There are buses running to the bridge areas but we took a 20min walk from Jogasaki-Kaigan station."
20,Beautiful and dramatic coastal woodland walk.,"This place is definitely worth a stop on your trip to Japan and Izu area. The coastline views are spectacular got some amazing shots , the suspension bridge is great experience too."
21,Great scenery,"I love the ocean,  so loved this area,  the water is a beautiful blue color.  There is also a wonderful hiking trail along the coast,  however,  it is rocky and not for those with a knee or anyone with leg injury.  It is an not an easy flat trail."
22,Go here,"The views of the coast formed by lava, is really worth the time and sweat. Do notice, it goes up and down a lot, and the paths are not even, so good shoes and legs are necessary."
23,Wear good shoes... ,"We hiked along the coast and I was surprised to see cristal clear water along the cliffs.  There are some diving centers around.  The trail is paved, but there are ups and downs (many stairs) along the path."
24,Beautiful walk along the trails ,"Worth a day trip down for the majestic coastal views, you can get there via the Jogasaki station, or take a day guide at K's onsen (free tour guides - you pay for the petrol)"
25,A walk along to coast,"Stunning coastline and nature near Ito city and not far from Izu Kogen, shops and restaurants. Good place to see the ocean and enjoy some hiking and a taste of nature!"
26,Spectacular views,"It's a beautiful but easy walk along a spectacular coastline, with a suspension bridge and lighthouse."
27,Lovely View of Coastline and walk,We find the rocky coastline more beautiful than white sand beaches and were not disappointed with this. Be sure to take the amazing hike that winds along the coastline-took us maybe 4 hours at a leisurely pace with views of the water and cliffs for almost all of it.
28,Tough walk but worth it,"The coast path was well planned out, with some uphill and some downhill going along the coast. The views are spectacular! I only wish we had more time to spend there."
29,Must see,"Breathtaking views, and you can see Yokohama from here. We loved everything here. But its quite dangerous to go there by yourself, make sure you have a local guide with you."
30,A must-visited place when you visit Ito,"Just came here to enjoy and admire the beautiful view offered by Jogasaki Coast. Be sure to wear suitable shoes because navigating amongst the huge rocks by the coast can be tricky. Visitors may climb a lighthouse and may also cross the nearby Suspension Bridge as well.Jogasaki Coast is a 30min walk from Jogasaki-kaigan Station. Several sakura trees line up the streets going towards the coast. I am assuming that the place will look ethereal during full bloom of the sakura. Trains arrive in ~1 hour interval, so schedule must be planned and executed well. Jogasaki coast may be included as part of a 3-day itinerary using JR Kanto Area Pass."
31,Undemanding but fascinating stroll,Beautiful rugged coast and a nice walk up and down stairs and a winding path (hard work with a pram on that route; there is a flat path through the forest but it is also hard work with a pram due to loose stones). Don't fall over the edge if you take the coastal route!There's a lighthouse and suspension bridge at the end.
32,Clear water,"This was a lovely sedate walk along the coast line, with some forested areas and some coastal views. Three are toilets at the start and sombre lovely viewing points and gazebos to sit at and admire the coast. Lovely."
33,Beautiful!!,"This beautiful coast has luscious greens, clear blue water, and dark brown cliffs which make for picturesque scenery and wonderful photos!"
34,Beautiful and relaxing hike,"This would be one of the main attractions points in Izu. You would not be disappointed to visit this place specially if you come on a clear day. Ocean looks just mesmerizing, it roaring sound make you feel vastness of mother nature. During high tide when waves struck the rocks along the coast there is no words to describe the feelings. Water is blue as we see in the movies and looks amazingly beautiful. Don’t forget to take walking route between jogasaki coast-hanging bridge-light house. Be ready to walk a little in the cool breeze of fresh and damp air, have a nice trip. Cheers"
35,Beautiful.,"If you really like to spends times with you or your loved once you can take a silent walk in between forests and one side sea. There are some photogenic places like light house, suspension bridge etc... You can take best photos here while a 4 km walk......,"
36,Spectacular,A nice experience to step on safe but shaking hanging bridge.  Location is at walkable distance to the nearby train station and nearby has a flower and plant park for visitors who like plantation.
37,Magnificent Mother Nature !  ,"A nice coast for a hike. Lots of up and downs so it is better to have some good shoes. Wonderful sea. The signs to get there from the railway station are only in Japanese, so it is better to already have a map of the area or eventually to get there by car."
38,The suspension bridge is great,This coastline and area is fabulous.  It's beautiful to see the waves crashing into the rocks.  we were able in one area to climb down the rocks and find a small fishing hole to swim in which was fabulous and one of the highlights of our trip!
39,Enjoy the Nature beauty of Ito,"Peaceful and calm, love the nature and atmosphere. Toilets are available everywhere. Only came in for about 10min, parking was 500yen. Should I have known, will pack somewhere else and walk in."
40,Nature beauty ,"We had never seen any landscape as beautiful as the Jogasaki coast! It is a relatively easy hike (although good shoes are recommended if you want to climb down closer to the water), and there was hardly anyone on the trail, even on a busy summer afternoon. The trail itself is shaded and gorgeous, with spectacular views of the rocky coastline every few meters. The lighthouse and suspension bridge are neat and offer some different views. The whole thing is free and easy to get to, and we recommend taking a bus and asking a station attendant which stops you should get off and return on (as we had trouble reading the schedule). Definitely worth the trip!!"
41,pretty rocky coastline,"Why always stuck inside a shopping mall, if you have chance to visit to this place, very nice park to walk around and enjoy the amazing sea view. No photos could tell how nice is here unless you come here to feel it yourself. The cable bridge is one of the most exciting spot of this park. People who afraid of height (like my wife) will keep screaming when crossing the bridge. Very fun and exciting , whoever came to this park, must go to this bridge to test your guts. I rented a car during my trip so I just drive here without any problem, not quite sure how to get here by public transportation."
42,Nice hiking ,We spent a fun afternoon at the cliffs. I wanna make sure though that this is NOT A BEACH. There are cliffs all around the water and the current is so strong that there is no way you can go into that water! We had fun climbing on top of the cliffs and get away fromSome of the tourist to take someGreat pictures. Defs worth a visit and a fun way to spend half a day.
43,What an amazing place!,"if the weather is nice- its a must visit. Lots of rocks to climb on so almost fun for kids, and beautiful scenery."
44,Gorgeous!,"Not really a beach, but plenty of watersports available nearby, from scuba diving to surfing.The coast is a perfect place to take a boat ride, sail or use a seacat"
45,Spectacular views,So it isn't really a beach- more a hike/walk along amazingly scenic rocky coastline. We went on a misty rainy day and it couldn't have been more perfect. The water is so blue and clear. The waves are so fantastic crashing against the coastline.  The plants are so lush and green. We started at the lighthouse and suspension bridge and walked about 1.5 km which took us to gardens with food and toilet facilities. There is another coast line walk that starts there for about 8 km to another suspension bridge but we were short on time. If we had a full day we would have definitely done it. We took the train to Jogasaki station. From there it is a little confusing - supposedly there is a bus you could take but we walked. It was about 20 min walk to the bridge and it was 100% gps guided (there are no signs!).  Walk back was about the same from the gardens. It was a lovely day out - even in the rain!
46,Truly beautiful hike; no crowds!,"From the Jogasaki-guchi bus stop, you can make your way to the trail that hugs the coast and provides great view of the coast. There's also a place called Anaguchi (穴口) along the trail that shows a hole in the ground that goes straight through the cliff and down into the ocean below."
47,Stunning views,The main reason for visiting the Jogasaki coastline for my friends and I was to visit the coastline and enjoy the many trails. We were surprised at how quiet the town itself was after the busy season in Hakone but embraced the quiet and empty pathways. I highly recommend a few walks along this trail in either directions.
48,Wow! Spectacular!,"The Jogasaki coast is accessible by a network of paved paths and trails, and each turn leads to gorgeous views. Be sure to not miss Renchaku-ji, which is a shrine to Nichiren Daishonin, who founded the Nichiren school of Buddhism, which is the fastest growing branch of Buddhism these days. Nichiren was rescued from rocks off the coast by a fisherman, and the place where he was rescued can be seen from the trail near Renchaku-ji."
49,Peaceful sunrise with zero crowds,"While it was not necessarily a beach and more of a seaside with huge rocks, it was a beautiful area and the water was clear enough to see corals and even some pink fish which was a fantastic sight. The area itself is a part of a geological park, so the rocks have been formed over thousands of years and make the seaside look like something from Jurassic park. The hiking trail was lovely and we even got to see lots of animals never seen before like birds of prey and lizards. The flower park was closed by the time we arrived but considering the amount of people walking to their cars from the area, it must be very popular. There was also a nice cafe adjacent to the park. Jogasaki kaigan and the surrounding area was gorgeous, especially on a warm summers day. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants fantastic ocean views without all the crowds and sticky sand from your normal beaches."
50,Excellent Views,"It's a pleasant walk down to the sea from the Izu-Kogen area, and the seaside is cooler on hot days. From the harbor area leads a trail that follows the seaside which can be shortened in many places or followed all the way to the Futo train station which will take you back to Izukogen Station for less than $3 U.S. A decent map of the area is available in Japanese and English at hotels and train information offices. One caution about the maps: there are lots more streets in the area than show up on the tourist guide map, so travel with care ... and a compass or GPS. If you're ever totally lost, flag down a taxi and they'll take care of you."
51,This isn't a beach; it's a gorgeous rocky coast,It's a great walk on a cliff above the ocean. There's an old string bridge in the middle of the path that is a sort of an attraction. One can go back after arriving to the bridge or go a little further where the path ends and takes you back to the road.
52,Stunning coastline,"Take the full tour from the small suspended bridge on the western end of the trail to the eastern suspension bridge. It's 4-5 hours of breadthtaking views and beautiful coastal forests with the Pacific Ocean wind constantly feeding your lungs with ocean air. My girlfriend and I must have taken 50 pictures each, and we were even holding back. Go here on a beautiful day with clear view for the best experience."
53,Nice coastal walk,"Small Bridge, nice small light house and beautiful rugged coast line, Not extraordinary and probably can skip if shortage of time"
54,Good view of the coast along Ito,"One of the highlights of the Ito area is the Jogasaki coast, which features a 7 km hiking trail, but the highlight is the Jogasaki suspension bridge and lighthouse. It was a spectacular view and worth the quick visit. The area around these attractions are well-marked, signed and have visitors parking – it gives a great view of the coast, which has such a re-refreshing breeze on our super-hot mid-August day. We found that you can soak in the scenery in an hour visit.The Jogasaki coast is accessible via 1.6 km walk from the Jogasaki-kaigen train station, which is lined with cherry trees and would be a treat for visitors during May. We visited the Shimoda beaches afterwards, and in hindsight should have checked the train schedule to avoid a 40 minute wait. We were able to do both the Jogasaki coast look-out and bridge, and the Shimoda beaches in a day, but ideally we should have started a bit earlier to maximize our time at the beaches."
55,Dramatic view of the coast,"This is a great nature hike, totally worth it if you're in the area and the weather's good. There's actually two distinct sections to the walk. If you start at Jogasaki-Kaigan station it takes about 10-15 minutes walk along the road to reach the northern area, with a lighthouse and impressive suspension bridge. There's a cafe and carpark, and the walkways are mostly paved so good for kids or elderly. This area's nice and easy. South of Izukaiyo Park things get a bit more rugged. The narrow trails wind up and down between the outcrops and it's largely rough stone steps. It's great for nature spotting - snakes, lizards, cats, spiders. Some of the geological formations are amazing too. It's about 5-6km from the park to the southern suspension bridge  (took me just over an hour at a good speed) and it's pretty tiring by the end. You'll want hiking boots and a good supply of water.At the southern end is another suspension bridge, some waterfalls and some tidal pools (which are accessible by some pretty steep stone steps). There's a car park at the south so you could just drive and miss out on the trek in the middle!If you're walking south it's easy to get lost near the Renchaku-ji temple. It feels like you should follow the path to the sea which is actually a dive launch area. Instead follow the steep road up into the temple grounds and across. Also look for the amazing ramen shop opposite Nagaya supermarket if you head back through Izukogen station."
56,4.2/5... a very nice walk and a cool suspension bridge.,"Really excellent views. Not far from Izukogen station, and there is a bus every hour from station to the beach. The hiking is not long but a really wonderful experience."
57,Picturesque,"It was a great hike along some amazing coastline. But bring some proper shoes. Try this in flip flops and you risk a sprained ankle. There are 2 exciting suspension bridges, a shrine and lots of excellent viewing points on this hike which took me about 4 hours."
58,"Really love this excursion, the hiking trail is amazing experience!!!","My visit to Jogasaki coast was lovely. It was very windy with a slight drizzle and the suspension bridge was closed for repairs. But all that did not  stop me from marvelling at the beautiful coastal views, with the huge waves crashing again to the rocks. We were fortunate to have a beautiful rainbow overhead which made the view even more delightful. We drive there using the GPS and had no problems finding the place. Definitely worth a visit."
59,"Lovely place, worth the travel from Ito Station","We arrived when a typhoon was coming, and it gave us a delicious sight of raging seas against beautiful boulders and cliffs."
60,Lovely Coastal scenery,"We walked South from Le Nessa through the woods, passing improbable and spectacular geological features and tiny coves. Lava flowing inthe sea thousands of years ago gave rise to rock formations some resembling tge geometrical shapes of the Giant's Causeway. There are two impressive suspension bridges on the footpath and the woodland  is shaded and full of flowers and birdsong. I'go back!"
61,Jogasaki- 上首尾!（jo-shubi)Happy result after the tiring hike,"Arrived around 15:00, we parked our vehicle near the flower garden, and it is a 1km walk alone the shoreline to the light tower and the suspension bridge.The path is beautifully paved, mixed into the nature and yet easy to walk. The view along the way is magnificent. When you are on the bridge, the view is even better. If you are scare of height, you still should give this a try as the view is breath taking.On the way back, there is another path you can choose, 300 meter less to walk but the path is filled with stones.All done in an hour. One of the best view one would never forget.天崖海角的地方。沿途風景優美，只是一公里的路便到吊橋，怕高的也應試一試。整個行程一個鐘而已。絕美的風景，一生也不會忘記"
62,A piece of Scotland,"We got to the coast by e-bike and left them at the parking lot.The coast os very beautiful with many plants, cliffs and rock formations. You can see the different rock material and the open water. The water is very clear. The view from up the cliffs is amazing, unfortunately we missed the time to walk along the coast much further. You should for sure do so. From what I read it is not far walking and the path looks very easy to walk along."
63,Gorgeous coastline,"Used our 1-day bus pass to get to Jogasaki Goshu and then did the cliff top walk to the flower garden  park. While it is a short walk circa 2km there are lots of up and down steps.  Interesting rock -lava, formations to see, a scary blow hole, the mouth of river with suspension bridge above the raging waters and beautiful coastal scenery. Didn’t have time to visit the park and flower gardens but coach loads of Japanese tourists came to visit. We continued on with our bus sightseeing trip to My Omura and then back to Ito. The bus pass is excellent value for money."
64,Worth the excursion for the view and the ocean breeze,"I recommend you spend a couple of hours at this lovely viewpoint. So pack a lunch, a beer and some yakitori . It's a short walk from the hwy and bus stop. Walk the trail down to the far end and explore the cliffs and drop-offs if you are a confident hiker/walker . - not for small kids or the elderly. Otherwise you can take the elevator down into the sea cave and watch the waves crash in. The elevator is expensive. We didn't bother but enjoyed the trail down to the cliffs instead.There is a small park with shrines just before the cliffs where you can rest in the shade on a bench and eat your packed lunch.  Highly recommend you visit the cliffs when there are large sea swells crashing into the cliffs...so don't be afraid to visit this spot when the weather isn't calm or nice......much more exciting when the waves are large."
65,Great beach view and larva formed rocks.,"not crowdy since its not a huge touristy spot so there's not many shops around, food only available when u reach Kaiyo Koen, the easy hike provides nice view of the coastal areas along Jogasaki beach"
66,enjoy the seaview on the bridge,"A short walk from Jogasaki Kaigan train station, the nature trial weaves through forested areas and occasionally peeks out to coastal rock outcrops with amazing views. TIP: For the adventurous, look out for small tracks heading to the ocean from the main trial, I suspect that these tracks are used by fisherman and they usually lead to the rocky coast, which allows you to explore the rock formations and take in the amazing sea scapes."
67,Refreshing hike by the coastline,"For those with kids doing school geography the chance to illustrate volcanic flow, stacks and blow holes in one undemanding and scenic walk - with ample facilities and ice cream stops is a hit.More seriously, a good walk on well managed paths gives a really nice glimpse of a distinctive landscapeWell worth it if you are passing/ need a place to break your journey"
68,Gorgeous scenery,"The best photo ops are on the volcanic rocks. I was breaking in a pair of hiking shoes and try were quite useful! We hiked 2.5 km along the coast from the Lamp Museum on up past the lighthouse. The weather was perfect and we had a clear day.It was a great hike, but I wouldn’t recommend parts of it for handicapped people - there are parking spaces and drop off points so you can see the lighthouse and the suspension bridge, but a lot of the route we took was rocky or had stairs going up and down along the cliff. Truly gorgeous."
69,Trail with good ocean view,"Visited on a overcast, damp day and was reminded of home. Very crowded with several bus tours but worth the trip from nearby Ito. Crashing waves and high cliffs - plenty of photo opportunities"
70,Very Beautiful,"Unlike many beautiful places in Japan that tends to draw crowds of local and foreign tourists, the Jogasaki Coast offers pristine views with none of the crowds in the early mornings!"
71,For peace and nature lovers,"Very easy ""hike"" which some women did in heals though I wouldn't recommend that. You can do it in less than one hour or take your time checking out lava rock formations and spend a few hours at it. I went over a holiday weekend and it was packed, although all the tourists were Japanese, so I didn't mind! Felt like I did a ""local holiday weekend""."
72,Normal Bridge,"The place was great. No entrance fee. You just need to pay ¥500 for the parking lot. You have to prepare for a long walk, though coz the trail is pretty long. There is a small swimming pool at the end of the trail but it's not for free.  I love the rocks the best."
73,"Traditional neighborhoods, ocean views, great walking.","The walk along the jogasaki coast is lovely, but it’s not well marked the whole way through and at times you’re on a road until you return to the coast. The views, however, are stunning. Excellent day trip from Ito."
74,Nice nature walk,"There is access to a tide pool at one point, but it's definitely ""user beware""--there are rogue waves even at low tide. That said, it's an absolutely stunning coastal path. Some parts are fairly easy (usually close to access points near the train stations) while others are more challenging. There are spots where waves ""boom"" up through holes, there are slot canyons running to the sea, there's a waterfall, and there's a region of basalt columns, rather like the famous Irish Giant's Causeway. We've been here twice, and (along with the diving, which is much better than it's given credit for) this was our reason for returning. This year's photos are from a rainy day, but it's great, sun or rain. To do the whole thing safely and enjoy it, you'd need most of a day (there are a couple of spots with bathrooms, so it's doable). However, you can get to very nice bits within 20 minutes, and enjoy them reasonably in an hour or two. We did three separate walks of 2-4 hours each."
75,Great views,"A nice walk, not too hard, just keep a steady pace and stop if you’re tired. Wear decent shoes, high heels a no-no, and appropriate clothing for the weather and time of year.Plenty of toilets available on the way and apart from rocks, trees and the sea, there’s a lighthouse and a suspension bridge to enjoy."
76,"Should be titled ""Jogasaki coast,"" and it's spectacular.","At first, I didn't plan to visit this place. I just want to see Mt. Omuro but I need another place to spend half the day so I took an advice from the bus guide book. So I detour to Izu Kaiyo park. The trail is amazing with the view of the coast along the way. It's so refreshing. After the trail there is a Jogasaki bus stop that can take you back to town (in my case, I came from Ito). Totally recommend to everyone visiting Ito town."
77,Beautiful coast views,"Located on the south of Ito, Jogasaki Coast 城ヶ崎海岸 is a gigantic lava rock coast with a magnificent formation spanning about 9 kilometres. It was formed by the erosion of the ocean waves into the rock, after the volcanic eruption of Mt. Omuro 大室山 4000 years ago.There is a large parking lot (500 yen per entry) at the park and after a short walk one would reach a hiking trail and the Kadowaki Lighthouse 門脇灯台. You can walk up to the observation deck at the lighthouse to look at the Izu Shichito Islands 伊豆七島 during a good day.Further along the trail one would reach the Kadowaki Suspension Bridge 門脇吊橋. Spanning 48 metres in length, it is one of the most famous sightseeing spots in Izu. Apart from the really beautiful scene one can also immerse in the vegetation and trees around."
78,good for hiking,"I walked all the way from Jogasaki-Kaigan Station (approx. 30 min) and although there were no flowers, I enjoyed it. Highly recommended to go on foot from the station in spring as there's a cherry blossom lane, probably half a kilometer long road lined with sakura trees (Feb-Mar). I crossed the suspension bridge and I swear it almost took the living life out of me (I realized then that I have fear of heights). But it was all worth the scare, as the view from the bridge and even from the edge of the cliff was more than spectacular. The water was really blue and very clear."
79,Pacific West Coast Nature experience,"A suspension bridge crosses the two sides, really wobbles quite  a bit but if you like that kind of thing - wow! Fabulous view as the waves crash in. Beach not so great as mainly dominated by the scuba diving community."
80,Lovely views and an interesting suspension bridge,"Definitely worth the visit. Try to come early or later in the day for better lighting for picture taking. If you come later in the day, in late fall/winter, do allocate some time to make it back to the parking lot in time before it gets dark on the trail paths. The sun goes down quite fast in winter around 3:30 or 4pm. Could easily be disoriented in the dark and under thick vegetation. The suspension bridge was closed for repair at time of visit."
81,Wonderful coast,"We parked at the New York Lamp Museum and Flower Garden, and walked to the Jogasaki suspension bridge. Although the walk was little more than 1 kilometre, it felt considerably longer because we took the path along the cliff top close to the sea, and there were lots of steps and sharp twists. But I would highly recommend taking that route; the views were spectacular. The suspension bridge itself is very impressive, and it’s worthwhile going to the top of the lighthouse for the panoramic views."
82,Spectacular views,"The Jogasaki Coast in the south east side of the Izu Peninsula was certainly a much needed peaceful respite from hectic Tokyo. The whole area is peaceful as it is stunning with breath taking views of the coast and its pristine water. We visited in the late morning and we almost have exclusive use of this place as only a handful of people were there. Even HD pictures don't do justice for the beautiful scenery and you've to be there to experience it. Despite the mid Summer temperature, the trail from the start, through to the interesting long wooden bridge to the bottom of the rocky coast was relatively easy with plenty of cool fresh air and gentle wind and you never felt uncomfortable or sweaty but good walking shoes are recommended."
83,nice hiking trails,"this review covers Jogasaki kaigan/coast and the suspension bridge+ lighthouse of Kadowakizaki :I arrived at the stop which I was not too confident whether I have had alight correctly? I did not see any clear signage, however based on gut feel I just go along till I sense that I should be on the right track!You will be all alone in the hiking trail (hardly anyone goes there on a weekday but that is good, I dislike touristy places) but your eyes are spoilt with beautiful scenes of Pacific Ocean that is not blocked by any architectural buildings, trees of all shapes and sizes especially beautiful pine trees and seasonal plants, insects and animals (if you could stop and observe), lava rock formations...seeing the waves crashing can be quite therapeutic to some...It has so much to offer ONLY if your heart is as vast as the oceanYou can sign up for kayaking,fishing or diving etc if time allows, or do a ferry-tour if you prefer not to walk.While it is quite challenging (including climbing lighthouse for me to complete the hike within a span before the next bus will arriveI would recommend at least a 2hour to explore the basics of this coast and the beach (take note of its limited bus timing), try to link here with your tour to Mt Omuro etc, Ito places too!"
84,For heck's sake don't look down!,"It was a cloudy day, but the sun was trying to poke through.  We were a group of seven....22 to 77 years old.  The walk was doable and nobody complained.  We could see incredible rock formations....volcanic.  It is a short walk from Izu Kogen station (1km).  There is a cave with a small shrine in it that some of the locals showed us.  The clarity of the water was awesome.  Although a bit steep at points, the trail was easy to walk on.  We came to a suspension bridge and spent a few minutes looking off of it.  The view was great.  After that, at a rest area with benches, some of us took the path down to the rocks below.  Fishermen were perched upon the jagged rocks, waves crashing in, trying to catch their dinner.  I heard there were plenty of fish that thrive in the clear, fertile waters.  You can then cut up to the station, or take a longer route which is about 5 km longer.  Good for everyone, and a lovely way to see some rocky cliffs along the ocean formed by volcanic activity.  Enjoy, but don't wear high heels....like some woman we saw on the trail was wearing.  PS:  English description are all over the trail.  Learned a lot about it.  So really, enjoy!"
85,A beautiful and easy walk,"I was not meant to be here. I was chasing Hanami which landed me up at Izukogen station. Then I used TA to search the attractions nearby & found Jogasaki Coast. After Mt Omuro, I got lost & ended up at Ito. So, when a JR pass, I came back to Izukogen station and took a local bus to Jogasaki Coast. It was about 15:00 hours.  But since I am in the vicinity, it made sense to spend time with Mother Nature. To me, this coastal walk is even better than visiting Mt Omuro. From the Kaiyo Koen Bus Stop, I took a hike along the jagged coastal line to Kadowaki Cape Lighthouse & Hanshiro Otoshi Suspension Bridge. The view was awesame and the air was so fresh. I saw pine trees, wild flowers, the expanse of the sea and powerful waves crashing onto the rocks. I took my time to soak it all it. So spiritual.The suspension bridge is not at all scary. When you look down, you can see the powerful waves. When you look out, you see the deep blue ocean. Well, at the end of the trail, I ended up at Kadowaki carpark, and u can see dusk is round the corner. There was a taxi waiting. I didn't to risk waiting for the infrequent bus. So I hopped on to the taxi who brought me back to the Izukogen station for JPY1660. It was metered. But the aged driver must have done this route so many times that he can tell me the exact fare. It was good. Spending time with Nature and letting an elderly driver earn some cab-fare."
