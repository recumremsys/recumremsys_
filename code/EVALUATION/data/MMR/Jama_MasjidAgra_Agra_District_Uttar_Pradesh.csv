0,Jama Masjid,Beautiful place to visit.   Steeped in history.  You will take your shoes off to get in.  Watch having to give tips as the minimum tends to be 100 rupees or be prepared for them to give it back to you!!!There are capes you can buy but honestly you don’t need them.
1,Very Interesting Mosque.,No restrictions on your religion to visit this place. Yet another beautiful structure left by history to us. Admire this beauty
2,Jama,"Must see while in Agra! Go with a tour guide or read about the history of this mosque prior, it will be more worth your visit. You have to pay to take your camera in. Go early or late when the sun isn't beating down on you. Recommended."
3,Mosque,"A very beautiful mosque and complex.  Worth a visit.  You have to be covered up, arms and legs or they give you a dress to wear.  Very calming place with birds flocking overhead.  Peaceful contemplating place.  Definitely worth a visit."
4,Good,"Climb the steep steps to the oldest mosque in Delhi.  Remove your shoes and leave them with the attendant. Pay the 300 rupee fee supposedly for cameras, but cell phones count as well. Then take your time strolling in the compound and viewing the people pray, socialize and form community. Only Muslims are allowed deep inside, but all can walk along the outer temple. Pay the nice man who watched your shoes 50 rupee on the way out."
5,You may Visit this Mosque.,A nice place to visit if you are in Delhi. Covered clothing is mandatory and can be borrowed. 30 min is enough for a visit.
6,Great architecture,this was the first site visited in India. Great open space and view to the city below. You have to take your shoes off before entering.
7,Jama Masjid,"A nice old Mughal style mosque, well preserved. One must remove their shoes at the entrance. and beware the ground could get hot! A nice quiet place to spend some time and take few photos in between the hustle and bustle of the city."
8,Tomb of the king,"This was a nice visit.  Know that you will have to remove your shoes, but you can put them in a backpack if you have one with you.  We expected to remove our shoes, but did not consider how very hot the ground would be walking around.  Our visit was short because, even walking along the mats, our feet could simple not take the heat.  However, the mosque is beautiful  and certainly worth a stop in Delhi."
9,Nice visit,"Excellent architecture. Very clean. You take off your shoes at the gate. When you leave, your shoes is there. They give you outfit to wear to cover your body since it’s a mosque. You can pray if you’re a Muslim. There’s water, like a big pool of water in the middle of the compound. It’s clean. A must see!"
10,Not a popluar tour destionation,"Very Crowded area,but if you want to taste the local food,this is the place.You can also try the Chai(tea) .It took 6 years to make this mosque & with 5000 workers.Made of Redstone & Marbles.Opposite the Red Fort & the Old Agra fort railway station,where you will get trains goingto Lucknow,Calcutta.Also towards, Udaipur,Jaipur & Jodhpur.In the winters be wary of the time table as the trains are late most of the time.As a student of Architecture good to study the Architecture."
11,Worth a visit,"Not much to see, especially if you opt not to pay and go inside which according to our guide was ""nothing much"". The building is supposed to be the biggest Masjid hence the interest in seeing it. Lovely colour and large but that is it."
12,Beautiful,Peaceful place in a chaotic part of the city. Visit outside praying time and you will have a relaxing time walking around the grounds of this large but simple mosque.
13,Must visit for tourists,A wonderful serene place away from the hustle and bustle. Make sure you wear long sleeves as it is a holy place. Will take an hour to walk around.
14,Anti climax,Very nice and special place. A bit hard to get through crazy traffic to reach it but worth to visit. Rare architectural mosque.
15,Old Mosque,"This is apparently the largest mosque in India. On entering you will be required to remove your shoes and pay someone to look after them and if you are female you will be required to dress like a telly tubby ! I was wearing long trousers and long sleeves but no you must put on a huge gown which will be thrown at you by a man near the gate. I brought my own headscarf and socks to wear as I didn't want to walk around the dirty floor in bare feet. We also paid 300 rupees for a ticket to be allowed to take photos. There are many people hanging around with their hand out that will attach themselves to you then ask for money for 'being a guide, taking a photo' 'or anything else you can think of. This is a beautiful building with some very impressive stonework and decorative areas. Our guide brought the place to life and it was worth feeling so uncomfortable as a blonde western woman."
16,Beautiful,"Nice ambience, no shoes allowed, bring your own plastic bag, one of the masjid that I visited and I hope I can visit again."
17,Old and historical place Of worship,Yucky.  Needs better upkeep.  It is an active mosque.  Need to leave shoes outside so walking with hotel bedroom slippers not a bad idea on this visit
18,Jama Masjid,This is a good masjid to visit. But you can not come over here by your private vehicle. You will have to park your vehicle in Agra fort parking. Then hire an auto for rs 100 to reach over here. This masjid is in middle of a very busy market. There is no fees to pay. But the person who will give you the tour of the masjid might expect a gratuity.
19,A visit to the Jama Masjid,"You will have to tip a lot, first to get a slipper and to get them to keep your shoes, then you will have to tip inside to allow you up the Minaret, so you can have a lovely view from up there.If you aren't fit, don't try going up."
20,Mystic,"Just one of the many very interesting monuments to see,again you need a guide to get the best experience,a little outside Agra so prices less but if you are on the road well worth a visit."
21,Beautiful Old Royal Mosque,"This ancient mosque is well worth a visit.  Be aware that shoes have to be removed (socks can be worn) and women will have to wear a long gown provided at the entrance.The mosque has one main undercover area and it contains some lovely architectural features.  Nice photo ops.  Two tall minarets tower above this section.The main area, though, is a very large open area with a water area in the middle.  When we visited long carpets were being laid out in preparation for a later prayer session.It wasn't quite what I was expecting of a mosque because of the large open area but well worth a visit."
22,Great architecture ,"Very cool seeing the largest masjid in Delhi (and India??). Everyone- makes sure you wear long pants otherwise they make you put on a robe. Ladies, you will probably get a robe regardless of what you are wearing so heads up!"
23,"the Jami Masjid, the Jama Masjid in Agra.","I didn't get to walk through the central area. Having read reviews that R300 is paid if you want to take photos, I decided to stand firm when asked (quite aggressively), even though I was carry my mobile in my backpack out of sight and did not plan to take photos. The doorman stood firm too, saying R300 is payable if you are simply carrying your mobile. Not wanting to cause trouble, and having seen the forecourt from just inside the entrance way, I decided to walk away. I have been conned earlier in the week elsewhere, so I was perhaps a little sensitive to being conned again. Decide your approach prior (to pay or not to pay) - the above hopefully provides info to do that."
24,lallan top,Looks very beautiful but didn't have the courage to go inside the whole pathway was so crowded. Be careful about the number of People if you can handle go ahead
25,Old Masjid,Worth a visit. Views of Agra Fort. Interesting aspects and history. Guide not essential. Separate area worth viewing. Additional donation.
26,Huge mosque 🕌! ,"The mosque itself was fabulous.  The people outside were a bit brusque, you have to take your shoes off and they will ""look after"" them, you won't get them back without paying a ""tip""."
27,India 2018,"Worth the stop to look around and get a few photos. Be sure to ""splurge"" on the slippers (Rs150/pair), as the ground is cold in the winter and is also covered in pigeon excrement. Save your socks/feet and get the slippers or bring your own! As with many tourist/religious sites in India, dress modestly. They do rent large robes for women who's legs/arms might be exposed."
28,Holy Place but not at right place,"Be careful being conned. We had paid entry for climbing the minaret, then we still need to pay tips for the guy we did not asked Rupee100 each person"
29,The historical holy place,The place is very peaceful and grand. if you want to pray you will realise this. this is one of the oldest Mosque in India.
30,Beautiful mosque in a very ugly area,"This is the Great ""Red Fort"" as it's nicknamed, well worth a stop in your visit.  The incredible fortress, with it's imense walls of colored stone are a sight to behold!  It's an incredible ancient site and well worth the visit.  It's NOT an interactive site and it's a great site for a quick detour from your itinerary that can be done with only a few hours to spare."
31,Photogenic,"If you are curious about Muslim life, you can go and see how a day looks like for them. there are lots of Muslims stay there: thining, resting and reading. also, some kids are studying the Quran.Most likely they are friendly, open for photos to visitors. The mosque itself is cleaner, you should remove shoes before going.  it's old but still magnificent. but the nearby environment is terrible. full of garbage, stink smell, which caused me almost fainted out.But overall, its a good place to see some different."
32,"big,old, red masjid",Well worth the visit if in Agra. Watch out for those professing to be mandatory Muslim accompanying guides. Cover your head and enter the mosque at will.
33,The royal mugal building,"After visiting the Red Fort, stop by the spice bazaar in front of the mosque and climb the steps to see a large decorative structure frequented by the devout. The gates, towers and minarets are imposing and inspiring, the people more so."
34,Jama Masjid,"As with all Muslim mosques, bring an extra pair of socks as you will need to remove your shoes to enter. Love 16th century construction of Indo-islamic design. Worth a visit"
35,A tomb in memory of princess Jodha,"Great history, chances for photos, and crowds that are spread out make this a sight not to be missed! I loved the beautiful buildings and good explanations in all guide books."
36,"As a Muslim Visitor, Disappointing it was!!",An average place to be in. Nice carving work and Petra daura work seen on the walls . Good place to visit .
37,Must visit if you're in Delhi,"Again no comment on the place to pray masjid, you can remember allah you can pray and relax, nothing else."
38,Where r the way to Jama Masjid ??,Absolutely beautiful! Another good example of the architecture of the area. Even if you are too tired from visiting the fort try to make it to this complex.
39,beautiful and antique,Place to see when you go to agra with your friends it is in near buy of taj mahal  it was used buy mughals to worship here you can see interior designing and learn different forms of art.
40,Good,"At least that is the impression. The mosque itself is not spectacular, although you can get views down arched corridors like many others built in this style.The mausoleum has elaborate pierced work covering large areas of marble slabs. As at other mausoleums there are threads tied to these and hawkers try to sell you thread to use yourself. I asked our guide if Allah really was more interested in threads tied to stones than to prayers of the faithful, and he told he was a Hindu and didn't know.Visit if you have the time, but don't do that at the expense of other attractions."
41,Masjid dedicated to Jahan Ara Begum,"Beware of locals posing as entrance fee collectors. If you look very much like a foreigner, they will block your way and ask for 300 rupees."
42,Visit jumma masjid  ,"The tower was a highlight of all of dehli. Serious hassle not being able to bring camera inside, and not being able to go up tower without a male escort."
43,Golden Triangle visit,"Worth seeing, but a bit difficult to wander without the glaring eyes of locals and security personnel on you. Like any mosque, covering the legs is a must and after dropping off your shoes you'll be asked for a fee, to wear an sarong around the waist. It appeared safe but we did not linger too long as there had been some recent violence at mosques in the region."
44,Beautiful Mosque,If you pass by you can visit it but it's not mandatory.better you move directly to Jaipur if planned.
45,JAMA Masjid,"We tried to get in one gate, they give out free covers for your legs and arms, but charge 300 rupees for a mobile phone as it has a camera, which seems a little excessive so we decided to go in separately, and leave our cameras outside. This didn't please the guy on the gate & he said we weren't allowed in even when we tried to pay. We went to the other gate and paid instead. You leave your shoes outside, it's very very hot ground so take socks or you'll be hopping about. Very peaceful in the afternoon, but I believe it packs 25000 people or so at peak prayer times. Makes for some nice pictures, and some nice views."
46,Nice historical place to visit,"Nice place to visit, free entry but 300 rupees for camera charge or phone charge. Tried to charge one of our group members twice for the camera and having a phone."
47,Another monumental place in India,This one is quite a large mosque. The place has a divine aura. Avoid going on a hot afternoon. The only problem is you cannot come to his place in your own car or vehicle.
48,Ancient masjid ,"This mosque was built high above the street level and we have to climb stairs to get to the mosque entrance. We were there on Friday morning and people were getting ready for Friday prayers. The mosque is made of red sandstone just like the  Red Fort in New Delhi. Non muslims have to put on a robe to enter and if you want to take pictures, you have to pay 300 rupees for this.We were really blessed on this visit as we were approached by the mosque caretaker to see the articles that belonged to the Prophet Mohammad peace be upon him. He took us to a small room where the 3 items were kept. The prophet's beared, his leather shoes and his footprint. We were all moved by this opportunity. Not everyone will be allowed to view this holy relics and we thanked Allah for his blessing."
49,beautiful historical site,"Great historical mosque to visit but it can do with information and signboards.  Also, be careful of so-called officers who prey on tourists and demand for payment when taking photos. The bazaar outside is interesting but a real warren of crisscrossing lanes and crazy traffic. Metro station is just about 100 metres away."
50,Jama Mashid,"Subhanallah, humongous place. You can climb up the minarah for a splendid view of the city ,must visit for tourists..I suggest must go once in lifetime..."
51,Best of India’s red forts,It's a very dirty mosque not worth visiting. You have to walk over more than hot red sand stone without shoes. It's a pity the whole place is so unkept.
52,Entrance fee for iPhone ,visited this place on a weekend. this place and surrounding area was crowded. morning times will be less crowded. weekdays will be best to avoid crowds. but i loved the crowd and activities there. its best to walk around the places. there are so many street vendors. better avoid eating from street vendors.
53,hectic and confusing,this is similar as Delhi masjid. one can enjoy old agra around.no entrance fees but caretaker expect tips.
54,Jana masjid,"Simple, prayers-ready, peaceful, very clean.The open air space brings nature and tranquility to your soul's experience"
55,Largest mosque in india,"As it with other places, this is also again has been converted into business destination by local guides. Not minding the fee which they ask you for its visit which was 50 Rs, you can go inside and enjoy some facts about the place. However, beware of the thugs inside the Masjid. They will trick you into buying the Chadar for 500/750/1100. Just completely ignore them. Simple head inside the Masjid and pay your regards. Thats it. No need to carry anything."
56,Best of all places,Very highly spirited ! Best safe ! Clean ! Close to the best restaurant ! Easy access to public transportation ! Family friendly ! Nice ! Love to go back again and recommend to all once in a life time to visit this exotic place !
57,Accessible place,"Amazing places .. it took you a years back, all what you have to do is just set a side, look around and let your imagination to take you a journey through history.... Also you would enjoy old Delhi street tour near jama"
58,Stunning architecture - visit early in morning,Stunning architecture in beautifully kept grounds. A reasonable level of fitness is required but it is well worth walking right round it to fully appreciate it.
59,A MUST SEE,"Shoes off of course. We left ours outside but noticed many carrying their shoes. Women must wear a covering following an incident by a female tourist in the heat of the summer. Fee for camera (300 rupees) and although only one of us had a camera both of us were asked to pay. 20 rupees for the gentleman watching our shoes and 20 rupees for the ""cover charge"". You are able to climb one of the towers for an additional 100 rupees. Look for the ticket booth along the outside walls at the back on the left. Steep climb worth it if you have a good day weather-wise."
60,Excellent People Watching,"Jama Masjid, is a great place to visit. Sit back for a moment and imagine how these people lived throught the hundreds of years ago, when you get there.  It is beautiful. Peacful. Inspirational. It is all you can imagine. India is truly mesmerizing, beautiful and chaotic on its own way. In just wish they treat the animals such as street dogs and other street animals better. I would have certainly loved to see this...it break my heart seeing starving or a dead dog on the street...India could do better when it comes to animals treatments."
61,Largest mosque in India,Loved the architecture. A good scenic beauty with pleasant atmosphere. It was very beautiful and a must see for everyone visiting India.
62,Very pretty,"Being the first stop in our first holiday in India, visiting this place is best to wear normal slippers as entering the premises require one to removed ones foot wear. Remember that storage of your shoe or slippers require a small fees to the keeper. Architecture of the building I would says it’s amazing to the people, which dates back a few centuries ago when this mosque was builded. Tourist would also be mopped by locals selling the local handy crafts the moment you step down your car till you exit the place."
63,Mugal,Loved going into the Masjid. Especially climbing the stairs up the minaret & seeing city below. It was a relaxed place & there were people who loved in Delhi & were there for the first time & were amazed once they were up the minaret. Highly recommend.
64,Splendid,"the place is very wide and very nice to go there and enjoy your pray to Allah, very near to go there"
65,this place gives you a different experience,This is a nice mosque with lots of history attached. Very near to the Agra fort. Cover this place as well as a part of Agra fort tour. Beautifully decorated building and nice artistic work.
66,A shame ,"If you are in Delhi, you must visit this wonderful place which is an architectural marvel and also a historic monument. Anybody interested in history and architecture will love the place without any doubt.As this is a Mosque, which is a religious place for Muslims, people have to be dressed modestly to enter the main compound. Men should not be wearing shorts or sleeveless dresses. Women have to cover their head and have to wear long pants and full sleeved dress of course. If you're not wearing such dresses, then you can get long cloaks which are available at the gate for a small price. If you're visiting on Fridays, make sure to avoid the place from 12 PM to 2:30 PM as that is when the Jummah (weekly prayer) is held and visitors are not allowed."
67,Went there with bestie :-),Our first outing in New Delhi. Very simple Mosque with not a lot to see but a gentle introduction to Indian culture. Our amazing guide Bhupi made it interesting For us.
68,Awesome masjid,"Like my review of Dakshineswar Kali Temple in Kolkata be aware that its shoes off here and the ground is very, very hot.  Cameras are only allowed with a fee paid and its closed on a friday.  Beautiful architecture though."
69,Similar to Delhi's Jama Masjid but beautiful and huge !!,Shah Jahan build it and it's a good palace to see. little crowded.The way it is made awsome.Superb style..
70,Family visit stopover at Delhi,"Archecture looks similar to the mosque beside taj mahal. Nice cooling sqaure.No entrance fee for visitor, but there is 300 rupee entrance fee for camera phone. And if you must pay even if you don't take any photo. If not, they will refuse admission and ask you to go back to hotel and keep your iPhone. It is a quasi human entrance fee.The most disappointing part is that they didn't give me back mychange until I insisted on getting back my change. Very dishonorable staff."
71,Jama,"Nice place to visit. Lot of people can pray over there. I like there as maintain there place. Once you can visit if you have time in Delhi. Don""t forget to go Karim""s restaurant. Thanks."
72,"Pay, pay, pay !",A Very sacred and cool place in the history of Muslim one can have good time and fun if someone want to visit it is a very very nice place
73,10D9N India Golden Triangle with Kashmir ,"Please dont come without see this attraction, dont compare with any other. It looks beautiful. Best for family trip"
74,Historical Grandeur,This was our first stop of our trip and is large and quite stunning. Great views also of the street life.
75,Sacred place ,Was not expecting this place to be as good as it was! Beautiful architecture and very interesting. A nice place to relax and watch the world go by.
76,"Getting here is an ordeal, but possibly worth it",I liked place. Area is very narrow. They charge to much money as fees. Nothing special to see. I did not see gentleness.
77,very nice,"Very good architecture and a better place than Tajmahal to visit...Though small and ends before it starts, if you are looking for architecture do not miss the place...There are timings so please be ware of that...."
78,Quick visit,"Belongs to Taj Mahal era , witness of Mughal's glory . Worth seeing it if you are in Agra for two nights this is something else you can see in Agra apart of Taj Mahal . Bit difficult to reach there but it's not only mosque also you will find some more interesting market with real Indian life ."
79,Not worth visiting,A poor example of a large mosque. The site is not worth a visit if you have been to Fatehpur sikri. The mosque is still functioning and therfore has to be respected in the formalities that follow.
80,Gorgeous,Simply amazing carvings.  Artists did great work and it is well preserved.  Worth the time to spend a couple hours touring.
81,Largest mosques,The road leading to the mosque is quite filty and crowded as usual but inside the mosque is nice to have a view and pray. Best to take the slow   trishaw driving up to the mosque entrance but the street view is entertaining and amusing as to how people live
82,Horrible experience,A beautiful Mosque which is a must visit in Delhi. The ride up to the mosque is overwhelming as you come across a noisy and busy streets filled with people from all walks of life.
83,Nice masjid,"Its a place of worship, and people from all religions and walks of life are free to go in. This was my first visit ever into a mosque. I liked the place.Its very serene and peaceful inside the Masjid. Even though its in the most crowded area of old Delhi i.e. the Chandni Chowk area, its very peaceful and quite inside. There is a small fee for going into the upper decks of the mosque. The ticket counter is clearly marked inside the mosque. Tips:  1) Shoes not allowed. Carry a plastic bag with you, outside the mosque, remove them and put it in your bag and carry along2) Camera charges Rs.300.  3) The surrounding areas unfortunately is very unkempt and noise. If you have a chauffeur driven car, try and get dropped as close as possible to the entrance of the mosque. 4) No real dress code, however respecting the traditions ladies must carry a scarf to cover head."
84,Amazing,"Space requires some seriousness. It is necessary to fulfill the normal requirements of a Hindu and Muslim religious space: remove shoes and cover legs (in case of shorts) for men, and wear a tunic for women.It's a mythical space inside the Agra Fort and requires a visit.Take time to relax and try to interact with the locals."
85,Amazing!,Indeed one of the largest mosques. But wish it was maintained more cleanly and with less vendors. The views from the the entrance on to the Chandni Chowk were impressive.
86,Impressive building but rude and pushy staff,We went in to see the mosque and then were delighted to talk to a teacher and his young students. This was a highlight of our day.
87,A Good Experience,"It is amazing to see such a Mughol's mosque in Agra and if your get to India, It was recommended to visit Agra and Jama Masjid."
88,Brilliant building,It's an amazing experience to visit this historical place built by Mughals. I really recommend the visit!It's a beautiful mosque.
89,Friday Mosque,"Photos never show you the context of a building's setting. Surrounding the Jama Masjid is a neighborhood full of every imaginable shop which you can see on a rickshaw tour.This mosque is quietly elegant, like an old aunt whose beauty has faded. Its color and scale wonderful to see."
90,Masjid,"Just cannot imagine how they built this place in the olden days..definitely worth a visit. They provide hotel room slippers to walk around and sarongs for ladies - there are worshippers there, hence, dress conservatively - especially for the ladies."
91,A very well constructed Mosque,Worth a visit if you are already travelling to Agra for TajMahal or some other purpose. No need to explicitly plan your trip to Agra just for this.
92,The Friday Mosque ,"If you visit Agra Fort, do not forget to come to Jama Masjid.  Agra has lots of tourist attractions besides Taj Mahal."
93,Colonial times,Very well preserved and must stop for lovers of architecture and monuments of this grandeur. The view across the rive to the Taj is well worth admiring. Best to visit early morning to avoid crowds. While away in the beautiful alcoves and admire the detail.
94,Historic Place!!!,Visit this place and they are closed for a few minutes because its sunset so I decided to not just go inside and just look around from the outside.
95,Tough to get in,The mosque is generally underwhelming. not worth the walk there. When I was there I was not sure if you had to pay for entrance. Apparently it is for free there is just someone asking for entrance standing at the front. See photos attached photos for what he looks like. He is the guy wearing black.
96,Historic,Any tour to the Taj Mahal should include this beautiful old building. The architecture is stunning and includes cooling towers. Lines were non-existent. These builders knew what they were doing!
97,Beautiful Mughal mosque,We visited this site which is the largest mosque in India.   They charge a modest fee to take pictures inside the grounds of the mosque.   We enjoyed walking around the site and getting an appreciation for the large number of Muslims in India.   About 15 percent of the people are Muslim.  You need to take off your shoes to walk inside the grounds of the mosque.   You climb a number of stairs to get up to the level of the mosque courtyard.   From the courtyard you can get a good appreciation for the surrounding area if you look out from the sides of the square.
98,Super ,"One must visit this place during Eid time, alot of happening around. Historical Place and a good variety of food. Karim's & Aslam's Chicken Corner are one attraction to this place for tourist. During Eid Mosque is well lighted and decorated at night.WARNING-> Take care of your belonging well mobile,watch,etc."
99,Pretty but good view is actually from Agra fort station,"a holy place of the muslims situated near the agra fort, good architecture,but just viewed it from the outside"
100,Nice place to visit,The admission for tourist is not for free. The place is well mantained a real isle of peace in the middle of a crowded market. But it's not worth visiting;  tower visit is available but paying another ticket.
101,Largest mosque.. Jama masjid,It is a masjid located in agra.it walls have carving of history on them .if you are a historian then this place is a must visit.
102,Decide your approach,"We did not enjoy being hassled by men in the mosque.The building and courtyard area are pretty and quiet.Be aware the shoe minders expect payment, but they also provide material to cover your legs if reunited."
103,This mosque is enormous beauty,"Stopped here on my tour of Agra.  It's ok, but like many sights in India, this hasn't been well cared for.  I suppose if you're spending a lot of time in Agra, you should go see it, but if you're there for a few hours you can just skip this and go to what you really came to see, Taj."
104,Jama Masjid-Biggest mosque in India,This majid is awesome there lots of crwod and I like to go here one more time... I think awesome to visit world wild
105,"Impressive structure, unscrupulous Muslims","Just a regular mosque. Not much to see on the inside.. usually very crowded in peak seasons and the ventilation isn't that great so if you're claustrophobic, steer clear of the place."
106,How it feels to visit Jama Masjid Minaret.,We have been there in a group of 7 friends and totally enjoyed the trip . you will feel blessed from the moment you enter and till the time you be there . Great place . one must visit .
107,one of the largest mosque,"Understandably, this is a holy place and is big but we didn't find anything else attractive. Worth one visit though."
108,Jama Masjid Visit,"Yes, the mosque is large and beautiful, but I was so disturbed by tourists defying the photo prohibition that I got so angry that after having informed several photographers of the prohibition, I simply left the place. It is depressing how little respect is shown."
109,bEAUTIFUL PLACE,It looks like anything except mescid. Very bad and dirty place. Not treated well according to a other mescids in the world.
110,Jama masjid,Ancient culture & History is reflected through every part of this monument.one feels like getting lost in Past.
111,Wonderful Creation,Worth the visit but bring a spare pair of socks to put on otherwise your feet or socks will Get very dirty. When you collect your shoes at the door you will also be asked for a tip ~20-30 DirhamYou will be given a cover for men and cover for women to wear in the mosque included in the admission Buy a camera ticket - you will be asked for it when you take pictures inside the mosque. There are plenty of great visual opportunities with some incredible architecture
112,Aggressively Groped in the Minaret,Nice experience amidst crowded market of delhi.One can experience delhi at its local level and also enjoy shopping in old traditional markets.Visit Masjid for spiritual awakening. Spend time with birds there.
113,Beautiful Mosque,"Difficult to visit, but interesting once arrived.  Near Agra Fort, I recommend arriving later in the day after it starts to cool, but before they close."
114,Is that China with Tasty Indian Food? Lol,"No pics taken because we were informed that we needed to pay upfront if we bring cameras or mobile phones in. Dont worry about the shoes as we had that taken cared off. Note: no shoes allowed inside the mosque. Good to visit, good to know how Islam has its influence in Delhi."
115,Worth visiting place ,Situated near Agra Fort which is Sandstone made Old heritage Mosque!! Decent Dresses need to wear along with a slipper to visit Jama Masjid. A great architectural view with great & amazing carvings. Agra Fort view is very impressive from here
116,Blessed visit,"I stopped to see this and it was an interesting mosque with beautiful architecture.  If you have time, stop and see but not a must see.  The comments about removing shoes and walking 100m on burning hot red sandstone are true.  Careful of being asked for money for watching your shoes in turn for alms but it was only 50c US so no big deal if you have smaller bills."
117,Fantastic mosque,A fantastic red mosque with huge area built during Samrat Akbar. Beautiful sights all over. Nice place to capture photos but you need to pay 300 INR only for carrying camera which is kind of over burden!
118,stunning in deep red,the architecture of the building is so fantastic like it has a great story behind. this is a must visit place in Agra
119,Beautiful use of Red Sandstone,This attraction 40 km west of Agra was certainly not deserted when we visited it in the afternoon.  Several coach parties descended on an exterior vehicle park and then transferred to the shuttle bus to take us up to the ramparts.  If you have seen a red fort before there will be not too much different to view apart from some original paintings of elephants! It was part of a fortified ancient city capital of the Mughal empire between 1572 and 1585 after which its water source dried up.  We were not encouraged to view the mosque which was more imposing and there were several other sites along the ridge we wish the guide had had time to view.
120,Amazing!,"All this places in India are amazing it is worth going here to close your eyes and wonder around to try to experience it with all your senses, you should hear this place, look at this place, smell it and imagine how the Mughals will worship god around all those heavy red and beautiful arrangements of rock and stone. The workmanship of the architecture is faultless something that today is not able to happen with the industrialised world we live in. A must visit place for anyone visiting the area."
121,Sandstone made Old heritage Mosque!!,"After loving our visit to the Fort- we were excited,then quickly disappointed, w Jama Masjid. Its an active mosque and shoes must be removed-socks too. Hygiene part was nebulous but we continued on, barefoot, scalding on feet on scorching ""dirty tattered runway"". When unstable, emotionally ""off"" man holding up his pants with one hand started to chase us, we felt unsafe. The mosque attendees didnt seem to care about us so we half ran to exit- still being chased. The area is filthy dirty by railway (but fascinating to watch locals attempt to board trains and porters carrying luggage on heads). Only bad,scary experience in our 3 week India travels."
122,Impressive mosque in New Delhi,"Found this an interesting place. Nice views and architecture and although a ""cool"" day it was very hot inside. The hawkers just outside will not leave you alone but i just ignored them."
123,Beautiful ,just opposite the agra fort..it is a place of worship..the architecture is simply marvelous.good photo stop.
124,Biggest mosque in Agra,"One of the most beautiful monuments. Even with the crowded streets, it is serene. Have seen few mosques but this is the best of all."
125,Old and in disarray ,"Very interesting to see, particularly worth climbing the minaret for view over the town although it was misty the morning we did it."
126,Beautiful sandstone architecture,"After seeing the mosque in Delhi, this mosque was a disappointment to me. It was hard to find and, once inside, there seemed to be practically no one there, which made it less than inviting to walk around. Just take a peek inside if you're close."
127,Good for Study on Architecture & Local Cuisines.,Again another great architecture building and popular visiting site. Great photo opportunity and worth a visit
128,Grand and well worth a visit ,"It is obviously a very nice mosque and is very active.  I went in the afternoon and since you have to take your shoes off, I was hopping around like a flea.  The floor gets to be like a griddle.  I highly recommend you wear shoes with socks.  You can then keep your socks on when you walk around.  It is an incredible structure and should be seen if you have the time."
129,Peaceful mosque,No information or sign help you to enjoy the Jama Masjid Dark without light and no enough service in Jama Masjid
130,it's free so not pay any entrance fee,"Huge structure , magnificently built, though area around it is crowded but it is worth seeing.huge domes and entrance is steep"
131,Great Mosque,"Really loved it here so much to see, its magical and really well preserved, spent hours here taking lots of photos and enjoying  the surroundings"
132,Peacful place during times of dusk,We were here during our Agra tour. It was a long and great stopover. Wonderful view of the city from the top. A must go of all places in the tour. We took help of guide to know more about the place. No photo restrictions.
133,Deserted Fort?,this place holds a very font memory from the historical empire era.go during sunset for a beautiful reflection of the sun against the building.i have gathered all the information that you need here at my personal blog : www.pinparadise.blogspot.com have fun and i hope you enjoy as much as i did.
134,Free Entrance,Nice place. Wonderful architecture. The carvings and designs are very intricate and give it a royal look and feel.
135,Climb the minaret!,We visited this place just after prayer time and were impressed by the grandeur of this place. The beautiful architecture. Our guide had many good stories to tell and led us around at an easy pace.
136,Another must see,i love to sit this place bcoz it gives the feel of old culture and the sourrounding is full of croud but when we enter the masjid it looks peaceful and calm
137,Must see location,"People there are so rude that half your mood is spoilt at the entrance itself. Then they have these silly rules of no 3/4ths, etc which I think they should put a board outside about rather than having everybody climb up the large number of stairs and then their rude people saying no for entry.Worst experience!"
138,Yet another fort,"Its a magnificent view of Delhi from the minaret. Stand there and imagine that these Minars have witnessed layers of generations and folding history. I would suggest you to one climb up this minar and visit it. My first visit was with my mother to this minaret as she is from old delhi.Its around 250 stairs and little claustrophobic for some people as its narrow but that's the feel of it. There is ventilation through small holes in the minar. Tips: Be careful of the caretakers. Do not indulge in any kind of arguments with them. People around have created useless rules which doesn't exist on record to harass tourists for money. Wear decent (arms and legs covered) cloths in order to not invite unnecessary attention and arguments. Do carry a stole (for females). be aware of pickpocket and mobile thieves. Do not reveal that you have a camera , SLR needs a tickets to be used inside the premises, I have never paid for photography here though :pFeel free to ping me for any questions and tips for old delhi."
139,Largest mosque in India,"Good place! Nice experience, we had relaxed over there for 15-20 minutes. Peaceful  and beautiful place."
140,interesting,This is one impressive structure that everyone must visit while visiting Agra. The sheer beauty of the structure and austerity reflected is bound to leave a lasting impression on everyone
141,2 stars are for the local people not the place,"If you are not a Muslim or have a particular interest in mosques, and have limited amount of time in Delhi, skip this without question. If you go, bear in mind shoes have to be taken off - a lot of pigeons and their excrement on the floor so come prepared."
142,So old and so nice,"The plaza is impressive. The architecture is lovely.  On the opposite of agra fort, it is full of vendors trying to sell you something. We couldn't go inside the mosque because there was a service going on."
143,holy place,"The atmosphere is one of pure simple joy...The concept of the courtyard as a gathering place for people and families is best illsutrated here. The space is so vast and immense yet is held together by the collonaded verandahs all around, with the ablution pond in the centre and the huge structure of the mosque as the focus. The flying flocks of pigeons create a special ambience - settling down and flying together in groups around the space."
144,Beautiful Place,Built during Mughal reign in Agra nice monument with huge crowd collection nice to se and enjoy with friends
145,Impressive but not maintained well,Located not too far from the Agra fort. I found it very atmospheric. It has a nice raised courtyard with views onto the market street below. Clerics in discussion and little kids playing hide and seek within the mosque made for an interesting half hour.
146,Agra Fort Mosque,Wonderful! So bright and airy. A really peaceful sense of history. We wandered around with a group of school children on excursion.
147,Facinating architecture,"If you have came all the way to Agra fort. After, your visit to Fort if you some time left and are not tired. Then, go for it."
148,Underwhelming,Jama Masjid - yet another fascinating piece of Indian history.  Another site built using the famous red sandstone.
149,Well worth a visit,Architectural piece of mughal era. Nice building but need cleanliness and maintenance. Not a must visit of agra but a nice place close to agra fort. One should definitely visit if time permits.
150,Gorgeous Old Masjid,"Yet another beautiful historical mosque. This one is huge. We arrived close to sunset and took some really great pictures. There are legit guides and phonies. Some phonies are nice, some are straight up scams. We declined this guide's offer, but he still followed us. So, we let him follow us, all while giving us site and historical information- what we are looking at, what it means, etc. I ended up tipping him. At dusk, as we were leaving,  the merchants were aggressively harassing us to give them money (as in, buy their junk). We walked away and said no politely. The mob kept following and harassing. We walked faster, they followed faster. Finally, I hailed a tuktuk about to pass us by and we ran to it. The mob tried to run after us! Our driver was at the very bottom of the hill waiting for us. We escaped in time. The locals here are not as pleasant as other parts of India.  This trip was in Feb. 2011."
151,Beautiful old mosque,"Nice old mosque in old Delhi, We took a rickshaw ride to see the Fort, Mosque and felt it was a nice experience. The mosque is beautiful and took some nice pictures here.The road was messy and full of traffic but thats all part of the experience :)"
152,The Beautiful Jama Masjid of Agra,"My visit to the largest mosque in India left a bad taste. I have visited many of the great mosques in the world from Damascus to Tehran, Qom, Fatehpur Sikri, Jerusalem, Banda Acheh and Istanbul but the Jama Masjid in Delhi left a very bad taste.All across the globe, I have found Muslims to be very devout, honest and hospitable but not so in Delhi. The people who were in charge of the robes and shoes were dishonest and aggressive. The shoe attendant at gate no. 2 demanded 100 rupees when the going rate was more like 10.  It is my hope that the authorities will deal with these individuals accordingly as this is a major tourist destination as well as a religious place of worship."
153,Bad view,its nice beautiful mosque near fort.It can be viewed from outside.one can go insid with proper care and obey mosque rules.Its also a great example of fusion of hindu temple building  techology by mughals.
154,OK for a first in India,Another must see historic place in Old Delhi. The Mosque is a jewel in design and proportion. It's closed a few times a day for prayers so check out when is a good time to visit inside. Very mystical and intense experience.
155,Unbelievable,I must say that each and every person should visit this place if visiting the town this place definitely deserves a mention
156,Very unspectacular mosque,"So much more to see and ""oohhh "" at than the Taj Mahal... I feel really privileged to have visited. The quarters for the mahrinis were interesting ."
157,It is absolutely amazing place,The oldest mosque built in old Delhi by the Moguls. It is large and needs at least one hour to visit go with a local guid. There are places not allowed to get I to during prayers. Were modestly. And head cover for ladies avoid Fridays. get a toktok or  rekshaw to mange the narrow streets around the place.
158,worth a look if you're in the area,"Foreigners have to pay for having a phone and camera. Staff physically pushed me at one point, shouting in Hindi which I could not understand. Had our driver not helped us out I doubt we would have even visited in the end. When you get inside it is beautiful, but not sure its worth all the hassle on the door. Women also have to wear a smelly overall."
159,It is a mosque,"I love islamic arquitecture so I was sold when I entered the mosque. It's very beautiful and peaceful which is surprising cause it's in the middle of old Delhi. This is a religious place so the entrance is free, however they ask western looking people to pay camera/phone fee (300 Rs.) They search you and your bag for any gadget that is capable of taking pictures. It's sad that they are looking for every opportunity to squeeze some money out of the tourist. I'm Indian looking (Indians walk in with phones and cameras in hand, they do not  need to pay) so I was halfway in when they called me to search my small backpack. My friends and I had to take turns getting in so one could stay out with the phones. Also, if you try to sneak in and snap a picture you will soon find that the place is full of snitches. A guy that looked like a devotee was actually walking around checking on touristy. I think he was following us. He snitched on us but the security man was tired from the discussion we had earlier so he didn't say anything to us this time"
160,Old Delhi visit,It is an impressive MOSQUE built for 25000 Muslims to pray together. Slippers are provided and women should be attired appropriately.
161,Similar to Jama Masjid in Delhi,Its a mosque like lots of others you will see if doing golden triangle tour. Best seen as part of tour of bazaar
162,Amazing trip to old delhi,a very interesting place we visited in Delhi which contributed to our understanding of the history of India and the many complexities of this intriguing  and culturally rich country.
163,historical,What  a wonderful and historic place this is; there is so much history behind this and you can see and feel it every step as you climb up the stairs towards the big courtyard area of the Jama Masjid. It is truly stupendous and phenomenal to be here and re-live the history.You will love it but I do recommend you get a good tour guide so he can narrate the details and history about this place.
164,A place to worship and is big but that's about it,The rickshaw ride to the masjid itself was very eventful as we had to go through the open market and chandni chowk. I would definitely recommend that everyone visit this place.
165,Interesting if you have the time,"Actually the first place I visited in Agra, I was so excited. At the entrance there's a person that gave us this robes to cover our body and be respectful to the religion, also no shoes, you have to go barefoot or use socks, as we walked in we saw this enormous mosque which is breathtaking and amazing, the construction itself is really beautiful and giant, we were told to walk trough the halls, the ceilings are tall and the architecture is precious, but the most amazing thing for me was watching all this people praying and meditating, I almost felt like I was being an intruder for breaking into such a peaceful place. Everyone should go and feel marvelled, be respectful and appreciate every detail this place has to offer."
166,One of the largest Mosque in INdia,must visit in purani Delhi area. Also do try the street food their which are famous for the ethnic Delhi taste.
167,JAMA MASJID DELHI,Before entering in Jama Masjid u have to keep some points in ur mind.1. Put off ur sleepers/shoes before entering in Jama Masjid or u can take it in ur hand.2. If u want to take camera in the Jama Masjid u have to pay Rs.300 approx but Mobile Camera is allowed free of cost.3. If u are a Female foreigner then before entering u have to wear a crown but its free of Cost. 4. If u want to go on the roof u have to pay Rs.30/- for Ticket that is fixed. 5. If u want to go at top of the Jama Masjid Minar then again u have to pay Rs.5/-Entering in Minar is little bit Scary but u feel amazing after reaching on the top and from there u can see a real view of Chandani Chowk.I visited with my friends and spent approx 3 Hrs. We did lots of fun and enjoyed a lot.
168,Must visit ,"I believe that this is the largest mosque in India and it is worth a visit. It was raining for my visit which was disappointing but it made for some interesting photographs. One caution, when it is wet the surfaces underfoot become very slippery and, since you have to leave your shoes off, this is dangerous. I recommend going barefoot if it is wet.I also climbed the tower and would not recommend this as the views are only average and the climb is claustrophobic and dangerous as there is no control of the numbers of people climbing the very narrow stairs at any given time. I was also disappointed that we were not allowed into the mosque itself but had to stay out in the courtyard. Nevertheless this is worth a visit as it is a beautiful complex and provides some good views over Delhi."
169,Great mosque!,"I found peace and tranquility the moment I entered the Masjid. Before this, I went to explore the Old Delhi market just outside of the Masjid. It was really busy with people and the constant vehicles honking along the way. But after I entered Jama Masjid, I literally spent the for about 2 hours there before flying back home (it was my last day in Delhi). Sitting and mesmerized by how wonderful the architecture of this place is.There are a lot of pigeons here which I find them really beautiful. The flock of birds will be flying all around the place and I believed it would be every photographer's favorite spot to get that shots of the flock together with the backdrop. I would recommend anyone to go here to enjoy that moment of peace from the busy streets outside."
170,Large and impressive building,A true slice of the Muslim influence in North India. It is a quiet place of worship in spite of the crowd that might visit. Filled with history.
171,Jama Masjid,"The masjid sits on a hill overlooking the hustle of Delhi below it. A grand red building, which must have stood out for miles around in the day. Magnificent architecture, with some great stories."
172,Be sure to go here on time,I cannot explain in words the grandeur and nostaligia of this place. We enjoyed our month long tour of India and look forward to our next trip to Southern India.
173,Good as other places,"Our tour guide took us there, really enjoyed it - one of the oldest mosque in Agra I believe. The old man in charge of the mosque gave us a tour, interesting building, a bit run down to be honest but great experience."
174,Gorgeous!!!,Where r the way to Jama Masjid ??hemmm we walked around this mosque to find where r the way to go inside. coz many shop around there and its like close the way. finally we find the way after ask people at there. small way and with high stairs. we need close shoes if want go inside. i hope this mosque will be more famous and many muslim come here. i hope this mosque more clean.
175,We had a bad experience,The mosque is old and beat up.  The surrounding area is very poor and dirty but it gives you the sense of what life is really like for the locals.
176,A bit of a hidden jem,This is probabaly the most visited tourist destination apart from the Taj Mahal in agra... It is a architectural marvel and has an eternal beauty... highly recommended
177,EXCELLENT,"The place is full of touts, thieves and rustic people. The place was so dirty that I stepped back (it was so hilarious - I stepped inside the gate. Had one foot inside and at that very moment I changed my mind. I exited. lol. The government and also the people there should keep the place clean and free from touts."
178,Beautiful,Second only to the Taj Mahal this is a wonderful example of art in red local stones. Not to be missed: quick walk to the train station.
179,"""Beautiful”","We were there as family on Jan 2015 -  we show it from outside, inside was prayers going. We decided to stay on the steps and see it from outside."
180,A Highly Decorative Easily Accessible Mosque,"This is an imposing structure and sits proudly in the midst of Old Delhi, with great views of the Red Fort and the old part of the city itself. But you must climb the minaret - the views are great and the climb itself an experience. But it's very squeezy as you climb!"
181,"More to do, than just the Taj Mahal","Years of Magnificent Islamic influence in this architectural and spiritual Gem. And, meeting people of all types in one massive area for worship. Humbled and privileged."
182,Masha Allah,"I'm not reviewing the monument only. This review covers the whole area. So, what do you get in Jama Masjid? Tasty non-veg with huge variety. What else? More tasty Indian food. Do try the kheer which is on the road facing Jama Masjid's front gate. About the monument, I loved it! Especially the tower - round and round and round lol. It was too high but the view from there was wroth the effort. I could see the whole city from there! If you are in Jama Masjid, do not miss the tower climbing."
183,Nothing to see there,It is absolutely amazing place. There was very much crowd on december but they handled it very well. This is one of the historical mugal architecture built by shah jahan . Overall one of the places to visit if you are visiting Delhi.
184,Amidst the busy streets outside...,historical highly spirited masjid ! very huge! i went during praying time so we waited till they finish praying. mobiles are not allowed inside and to use cameras there are an extra fees
185,It's OK,One must visit this place. Its a very good historical place. The Carvings are good and preservation is done well
186,so awesome,"Avoid visiting in May, weather extreamly hot. Otherwise the place is a must see beautiful red buildings"
187,Okay,"Jama Masjid of Agra is not as big as its Delhi counterpart, but you can see plenty of ancient architecture within this place."
188,Fantastic Archeticture,"Nearby my place, went there with the delegates from Pakistan who had visited India on an exchange program. It was a nice short visit we had and learned more from my muslin friends. If you have spare time you can visit this place while roaming the streets of old delhi"
189,This was really good,"This is a beautiful religious site, made of a red sandstone.  Advertised as the largest mosque in India .  Certainly provides a lot to see and take in by touring and by observing the local crowd."
190,Beautiful,"I personally have a soft spot for tradition,historical buildings etc. so ""Jama Masjid features right up there where this is concerned.It's a magnificent building,really worth visiting if one enjoys going back in time to enjoy the different aspects of ancient history"
191,A very beautiful peaceful place....,we paid 300 Rupies as tourists but I'm unsure if this was necessary.  we were only asked for tickets to go into the worship area which we would have skipped if we had known.  very hassly and got stared at a lot by everyone buy the place is beautiful
192,Don't miss it! Great history and fun visiting!,My friend and I visited this place on a tour. Amazing. We paid 300 rupees- 150 each and brought in a camera. Definitely recommend paying the costs to bring a camera in. Also wear long sleeves and socks. Shoes have to be removed before entering but socks can remain on. If you forget to wear long sleeves there are wrap around available for a fee.
193,History in the middle of Old Delhi,Because I look European a men ask me to pay 300 and try to look In my pocket if I have a cellphone. I told him that I won’t use it. He pushed me and he banned my entry. Doing this in the house of god is a shame.
194,"Very hard to get to, not much to see","Female travelers beware! I was traveling with a group of 3 other women, and we decided to climb the minaret. We were all wearing the long gowns that covered us from neck to foot. On the way down in the tower one of the men that monitored the traffic up and down the tower stopped us, and made us wait until everyone who was at the top had passed us to go down. Then, under the guise of ""readjusting"" my covering gown, the man put his hands inside my shirt and squeezed my breasts. I told him not to touch me again, and as others were coming up from the bottom of the tower, he finally let us go. This was an incredibly disturbing incident, and I would advise that women be especially careful at this location. If they try to stop you and ""readjust"" your covering, keep going!"
195,Must visit!,A working mosque where up to 25000 people can be accommodated in the square. Shoe covers at 100 rupees must be worn. Worth taking hotel slippers if poss. An unfair charge for Cameras/ phones is also levied at 300 rupees per item. Not particularly much to see. Felt disappointed by experience.
196,need to maintain,Nice historical architecture. After seeing Jama Masjid in Delhi once can resemble of Mughal architecture.
197,Not worth it,"We visited late in the day as the sun was setting, very pretty buildings against the sunlight. We covered up and paid the man on the gate 300 so we could take a phone in to take some pictures. It was quite a busy day, and there were a few men next to the mosque preparing chicken for an evening wedding celebration going on later.We visited the mosque for about an hour.You can pay extra to go up the tower, but we didn't have any local currency.Located at the top of a market, and the mosque is about a 5-10 miute walk from the metro station."
198,Saw but did not go in,"We visited directly after touring Chandni Chowk (foot and rickshaw) and the Red Fort, so to be honest my patience threshold had been breached, it was very hot, my ears had shut down and my eyes stung with the toxic smog.Take shoes off, pay the Entry Fee and then have to pay more to take your camera in (isn't it funny how many Place of devout worship where it would be disrespectful & sacrilegious to take pictures, can be won over with a few rupees), climb up the steps navigating your route through a throng of bodies - I left the camera behind in the Car.Wrong.Too late.The Mosque itself is nothing special, but the views from it are quite impressive & worth those few rupees.Here, Chandni Chowk, then Red Fort would be my suggestion for the order.Apart from taking off ones shoes, there appeared no other restrictions !Take a few minutes while there to watch the manoeuvrings of vehicles in the adjacent Car Park - hilarious ! Lots of animated interaction, hand signals and gestures that only a demented Delhi Taxi driver could figure out."
199,Beautiful!,"Alot of people say that Agra is only good for one day!i was there for 3 nights, and loved it, there is actually loads to do if you get away from the ""touristy"" spots.another tourist spot though is the Jama masjid, and its a beautiful place to visit :)"
200,Worst Place ,Jama Masjid is located near Agra Fort Railway Station a awesome historical place a peace of great arctitchal work
201,highly spirited place,"Located on a small rocky hill. Big compound, like a fort with its walls. One beautiful main dome and with many rooms.."
202,Openness,"After visiting the Agra Fort, don't miss the Jama Masjid Mosque, situated right in front of the Agra Fort. It is large, it is magnificient.  It was built by Princess Jahanara, the daughter of mughal emperor Shah Jehan. From whichever angle u look at the mosque, the grandeur of the mosque never fails to overwhelm you. During the mughal age it was a major religious and learning centre. Along with the Delhi Jama Masjid mosque, they form the largest mosques in India, and at one time, maybe the world."
203,Honeymoon,"While is shares much commonality with many other of India's Mughal sights, this site stood out with it's distinct eastern/buddhist influence reflected in the pagoda, and a lifesize 'parcheesi' board in the middle of the courtyard.Only complaint were the pushy 'entrepreneurs' upon the entrance and exit to the site."
204,Fantastic mosque of red sandstone dominates the city,"Before leaving from Japan, I was very interested in this palacesince I didn't know there was a prototype of Taj Mahal in New Delhi!As everyone knows this place would be smaller than Taj Mahal,however I surely recommend this palace before or after visiting Taj Mahalfor comparing each other to make sense their similarity and different points.I think this place is more familiar with me due to its comfortable size and easy to go around whole this palace."
205,A surreal experience ,I was very curious to visit this mosque as it was built by the same Mughal emperor that did the Taj Mahal and the red fort. It is very impressive in size and the architecture is amazing. I unfortunately wasn’t able to see the Quran written in deer skin. The mosque can be quiet busy and you have to leave your shoes outside. They provided cover for women. Also the city views are very interesting.
206,nice historical place,"Two weeks ago I visited the Jama Masjid with three friends. The site was large and we walked around the inside. It is interesting to see, and the architecture and colours are amazing. We didn't stay too long as there wasn't much to do, but it was nice as we visited in the early morning and so it wasn't busy nor hot. We had to take our shoes off and wear loose cloaks (I assume to cover our western clothes). I would recommend a visit to this lovely site!"
207,Agra's biggest masjid,"They way how Indian kings and their family lived is very interesting. especially the way they decorate basically everything. very colorful, which is nice."
208,AGRA has more to see than the TAJ MAHAL,The place offers a great close look to mugal architecture and the place is quiet famous too so we decided to visit it
209,Pretty from outside - nothing to see inside,.Fantastic architecture with red buildings & but needs more attentionOrganization is an urgent need.
210,Beautiful,"My wife and I visited the Jama Masjid as part of a Golden Triangle tour with the TripaDeal group in February.It was very interesting, but you must remove your shoes, women have to wear long gowns and men, if wearing shorts, have to wear a ""wrap"". These are hired at the entrance. It has very interesting architecture and was very busy, with a few different entrances. Well worth visiting the largest mosque in India."
211,Quiet place of worship,Me my family and friends visited agra in moth of Jan 2017 we have enjoy a lot and places we visited Agra Fort The Taj Mahal Jama Masjid Mehtab Bagh and local market sadar bazar the mosque was wonder we feel very relaxed at there and i have recommend all my friens to visit this particular place to visit
212,An Ancient Fort worth seeing!,"Too many beggars, dirty, goats' poo everywhere. Better take extra socks with you if you want to go inside, cos you must take your shoes off!"
213,Spectacular ,The person standing at the entrance of main masjid is uncouth uncivilised nd particularly unforgiving to hindu women...he should be sacked frm his job...had a bitter experience with him...after 5 min he realised his folly..but then i refused to see the masjid....it was just horrible...i repeat..that fellow at the masjid entrance must be sacked
214,Historic and a significant worship place,jama masjid is a lallan top place you can go there by car. nearby area is very crowded but old market
215,Agra lesser-known gem.,"Jama Masjid in Agra is opposite the Agra fort. After visiting the Agra Fort, don't miss the Jama Masjid, situated right in front of the Agra Fort. It is large, it is magnificient. It's an amazing experience to visit this historical place built by Mughals. Good one for history lovers."
216,Interesting,"We were told this is the biggest mosque in India and it is certainly an amazing building.  The architecture is beautiful and it's a lovely place to visit.  With it being a place of worship there is a dress code to visit and ladies do have to wear kind of long gowns over their clothes (these are provided).I would like to visit again when there is a religious service on, apparently the place can hold 25,000 worshippers - I imagine that is a spectacular sight."
217,Jama Masjid,Its an amazing experience to be among the  hundreds of people worshipping. It reflect the Muslim influence in North and their significant contribution in shaping the society to what it is today. And the food scene surrounding this area is a heaven for foodie. Can spend weeks just trying their food.
218,"Women, you must cover up. Great stop in Old Delhi.","A magnificent monument which demonstrates the architectural sophistication and scientific prowess of the moguls.fall of gardens,incredible sculpture and Persian influence"
219,Only of minor interest,The Masid is a place were the price and queens of nawabs tomb in the masid still the place can be maintained well  but history of the masid always astonishing and if any one visiting Agra they can have a look and get some pictures
220,Don't miss the largest Mosque in Agra built by a Mughal Princess,This mosque has great architecture and is a part of Shah Jahan the Mughal Emperor and a piece of India's pre-British history. It is inseparable from the Red Fort and they are close together. Visitors pay 300Rs for entrance fee and be careful of the guy that charges 100Rs to 'look after' shoes (or did he?)
221,Another beauty,Again a gem of architecture from the great Mughals. The domes with those zig zag patterns are worth seeing.
222,largest mosque,Popular named masjid in indiaalso popular in his own name Mankind this place is valuble in india support with system
223,Historically important,Solid beautiful stonework. The colours are quite deep. Early morning gives a great rich hue to the colours(and I expec the same could be said for the afternoon)
224,Nice place,"This was built in the 17th Century by Shah Jahan. It is a large mosque. We were quite excited to be able to climb 130 steps to the top of a minaret and look out over the city of Delhi. However, had I known, I would have told the man downstairs collecting tickets to not let so many people up still a time. It got very, very crowded at the top. Also, watch out for the small open triangle because it looked like you could easily fall and hurt yourself as it was not visible or marked."
225,aga jama masjid,The Jama masjid is another rarely popular tourist locale in India. Though it does not exhibit the same level of exuberance as the Taj it still is unique in its own way. Make sure to visit it if you are around
226,Friday prayer mosque,"We had seen the Taj already, so this was an anti climax, it was hot at this stage and packed with people. I would recommend going here before the Taj to fully appreciate it."
227,Worth a visit,"For a house of worship, I was extremely disappointed with how I was treated. I could barely walk without getting harassed for donations. If I was a member of the local community, I'd be embarrassed with how travelers are treated."
228,Beautiful,It is built inside Fatehpur Sikri. A lovely place with huge gate in front. Intricately carved on red rocks with white marbles
229,Excellent ,As in all these Mughal structure there is Friday mosque inside Agra fort where the Kings used to pray on friday's that's why its callled Juma Masjid
230,nice place to visit,"Taking aside that this is a place of worship for up to 25,000 people, The central building is berautiful to look at and if you add on the domes and minarettes you have a magnificent building overlooking Chandni Chowk market."
231,Worth seeing ,"This is a great place, architecture wise and quite serene view. It is also called the Friday mosque by locals. Avoid going on Friday as it will be too crowded then."
232,No information or sign,"this masjid is built in red sandstone and it must have taken them years and years because it is beautifully carved and presented. it is located opp the agra fort, so when you visit the agra fort, pls dont miss out on this. this is perfect if you want to see stunning old heritage and a mosque"
233,Photocopy of delhi Jama masjid,"Agra is a centre for Islamic architecture at its best. Sure there are similarities, but I think that St. Peter is worth seeing, even if you've seen St Paul's."
234,Delhi monument,This is a waste of time - we went through quite a mission to get there and there's absolutely nothing to see. There isn't great architecture or beauty so only go there if you want to pray at the mosque.If you want to experience some craziness in India then get to Jama Masjid just to experience the crazy market in the roads around it. It is absolutely insane! It can be a little scary but it is definitely an experience that I will never forget :) It would be advisable to wear closed shoes because the streets are not the cleanest.
235,Nice experience,"Our first stop after Dehli was Agra. Besides being able to breathe, we could also walk on the paths near the River.  In Dehli we couldn't ""just walk"" anywhere. We went to this Fort which was very similar to the Red Forte in Dehli so we were starting to learn Mughal architecture. And then we crossed the river on a footbridge to the ""Baby Taj."""
236,A Nice Architectural Structure,"If i had known that I was going to be disturbed by touts in a place of sanctity, I would not have entered. I might have had a better experience without the touts and what-nots."
237,Jama Masjid,This is one of the old Masjid at fort where people were doing the prayer to god. This can be good olden place.
238,Thumbs up for the architecture,"The highly celebrated Mughal mosque Jama Masjid was on the top of my must  Visit Places. The architect of the mosque is beautiful, huge, red stoned and worth visiting. You are allowed climb the minarets of the mosque from where you get 360 degree of the mosque and Red For is also visible from there. Red Fort is walkable from Jama Masjid.However my experience was still disappointing because I visited Jama Masjid as Muslim man. I was disappointed to see the level of discipline, cleanliness and poor management. I saw couple having good time inside minaret which made me angry. There was no closed  and calm area where you can offer prayers you never know someone is clicking your pictures while you are praying.As it is a mosque the management needs to understand how to keep the discipline it requires."
239,Splendid mosque,This is very good Mosque for Muslim religious people. The construction of this Mosque is really up to the Mark. One  will be really impressed after seeing the Mosque.
240,Crowded,"A busy heart of old Delhi location with cycle rickshaws and small sweet shops and snack kiosks all around. The humdrum of the struggles of day to day life, a very endearing sight of Indian life and in the midst of this all - there sits the Jama Masjid - a mosque in all its grandeur and yet very humble and simple and peaceful in a way.It is important to cover your hands/shoulders, knees, and cover your head as a sign of respect since this is a place of prayer. Again a hat and a pair of socks, a water bottle in the summer are important.A small section of the mosque towards the outer end is dedicated to collections from Hazrat Ali. There are only 3 places in the world where such belongings of the Prophet/ Imam Ali are on display. The blues mosque in Istanbul, The jama Masjid and the Hazratbal Mosque in Srinagar. Some people may be very reverently touching or looking at these artifacts. You will need to pay a small fee at the entrance in order to carry your camera inside the mosque."
241,awesome,"Situated opposite the Agra Fort is the grand Jama Masjid, Agra’s most important and largest mosque! It is also popularly known as the Jami Masjid or ""Friday Mosque"". It is one of the largest mosques in India. But do not visit during the day as one is not allowed to wear shows and the sandstone floor becomes very hot. The architecture and workmanship of the mosques is really very good. is also popularly known as the Jami Masjid or ""Friday Mosque"". It is one of the largest mosques in India. One must visit the mosque. Overall - Good."
242,nice place to visit,"I went to visit this place with my family, we were 15 people, first of all this is holy place but when  you look from outside one of the dirtiest place, people spit at this place, they smoke sitting outside on the stairs, stairs are so dirty and around this place so  so dirty, when we entered people stand their they see if you are indian free entry, if foreigners have to pay and it's high price, foreigners comes to visit this place to pay respect and you are charging high price, putting your name down, where all the money goes?? who knows, as they don't renovate or refit anything, as they don't keep this place clean so where does all money goes?? surrounding is also dirty, first try to keep it clean."
243,Beautiful mosque,"Even though the only part of me showing was my elbow to my wrist ( I had on full kurti, leggings, etc, scarf ) they still made me wear a terribly tacky mumuu thing on top of my clothes - so fun at 30 + degrees! You have to tip if you want your shoes back (Well, I don't know, that's the way it seemed. ) With that said, in the early morning this place wasn't too busy and no one was rude to us as I was expecting with prior reviews. I almost didn't go after reading the reviews!! I'm glad we did. Sometimes you just have to go and experience a place for yourself and Jama Masjid is highly impressive and worth a visit."
244,Nice visit at Jama Masjid,"it is my first visit to Mosque and Jama Masjid is also popularly known as the Jami Masjid or ""Friday Mosque"". It is one of the largest mosques in India."
245,Nice for 1 hour visit,The best thing I liked about the place was that it was really clean and there was not much crowd there which made my time just sitting and admiring the place from the garden much better. It's 15 mins away from Agra Market which makes it accessible place. Has good historical value.
246,Blessed experience,It was awesome that I saw on my eyes Jama Masjid in Delhi. It created good vibe with great architecture. You should visit there.
247,Huge Mosque,It just a mosque and there nothing else according to tourists. we just spent few minutes and felt sorry about that. Don't go there only if you want to prey.
248,Jama Masjid,"I do not like it because it is very crowded and very noisy. Also, it is in polluted area. I feel like avoiding this."
249,Delhi jama Masjid,"Jama Masjid is a historic place opposite to Agra Fort, Agra. Must visit place in Agra. Architecture was excellent."
250,Good example of Mughal architecture,"its a big red and old masjid. built-in the Mughal time and a good one. located in the heart of agra town and opposite to red fort. after visiting the fort, u can easily walk in here and see through. make sure u have full pant or ur knees are covered while entering in the complex."
251,So much colour,"Our first time to be in Delhi and after good time in Delhi we drive to Agra main target to see Taj Mahal but we visit Jam Masjid, wow what creation, unbelievable things from the past kings in India. We really enjoyed it."
252,Additional visit to Agra Fort,"I guess it was because we went there on a Friday or I do not know the reasons or maybe because I am a woman hence not allowed to see the inside of the complex.  I did not mean to go inside the mosque itself but just the other side.Nevertheless, from outside, the Masjid is quite huge.  In front of it is a busy market area where one can find good Indian restos, a welcome fact for those hungry while roaming the nearby sites."
253,It is just.,Jama Masjid is really a beautiful place.A mosque of muslim region.it is beautifully crafted walls are worth seeing.Dozens of people come here and muslims worship here mighty Allah...It is a worth going place if you live or ever come to delhi.
254,A good place,"Built in late 1500's this is well preserved with its palaces for the concubines, the Shah Jahan his many wives, court officials, clerks and servants.  It is huge similar to the one in Old Delhi."
255,Fantastic!!,JAMA masjid is fabulous place Muslims are using the space for namaz it's used king's century for masjid
256,Hot.,The JAMA masjid is one of the biggest mosque in world. The prayer gathering is fabulous and systematic.
257,Fascinating!,This was the Masjid where Mughal Kings had offered prayer on every Friday when their capital was Agra. This Masjid is still popular for Friday Prayers.Governor Amolak Rattan Kohli
258,peace,This Mosque is not as big as the Delhi Jama Masjid neither is very well known but is surprisingly similar in archtecture with the Delhi one .Most of the reviews are confusing the same with the better known Delhi Jama Masjid.Not much in terms of views but is cleaner.You can visit this post all the other sites if you have the time & are a Non Muslim.Can be skipped if you are short of time.
259,A grand masjid in old city,"Amazing architecture and history. Jama Masjid, Tomb of Salim Chishti Chisti, Panch Mahal.Amazingly constructed without modern machinery."
260,Beautiful!,This is very similar in terms of architecture to the Delhi's Jama Masjid. Very Huge and beautiful reflects the sense of Mughal Architecture.
261,Worth seeing,"A great Mosque of old Delhi it is the largest in India built by Shah Jahan made of red sandstone and white marble, you have to be suitably dressed to visit but can hire robes to put on."
262,Interesting,This place is full of divine energy very very Mystic and beautiful place aura of holy place is full of holiness.
263,Interesting Mosque,"This place is also known as the 'World-reflecting Mosque', it is the largest mosque in India and well worth the visit - I believe it's often called ""Jama"" which means Friday.The mosque was built by Shah Jahan (who also built the Taj Mahal, at Agra and the Red Fort in New Delhi)!  More than 5000 worked on the mosque during the 1600's and they say it cost of 1 million rupees at that time; it was finished in 1656 AD and has 3 huge gates, four towers and two minarets (which have been built from strips of red sandstone and white marble). The courtyard is huge and we were told it could accommodate more than 25,000 people at one time. Out of all the gateways, the eastern one, which was used by the emperors, remains closed during weekdays.The mosque was built on a red sandstone porch -about 30 feet from ground level. This mosque is an example of the Mughal style of architecture and it utterly fascinating whether you are interested in mosques, religion or architecture - it is a must see for everyone!"
264,Nothing to see,Jama masjid is one of the oldest and ancient masjid of our country ...it is build with a great impedence of muslim

268,Lovely mosque,"Jama Masjid of Delhi, is one of the largest mosques in India.At the heart of the chaotic streets of Old Delhi, this mosque is enormous, beautiful, and eminently photogenic. The views out over the old city from the minaret are fantastic, though bear in mind that the whole thing closes to non-Muslims at mid-day for prayers."
269,Nice place.,"so much beautiful building here. there are 7 buildings n so wide, so not so much cloud. also there are nature and floures there so like to visit enviloment"
270,Big Mosque in a UNESCO World Heritage City,It's an old mosque opposite Agra Fort Railway Station. Usually crowded on Fridays due to afternoon Namaaz prayers.
271,Contrasts!,There was nothing special about it.It was just like any other mosque .It just came in line with the things I was seeing .Given a chance skip it.
272,Just one of the must do's in Delhi,"Fantastic mosque of red sandstone dominates the city. It was built under the patronage of Jahanara Begum, favorite daughter of Shah Jahan. The courtyard on the east side was destroyed by the British in the 19th century. Despite this, the mosque looks very majestic. Pay attention to the pond with a stove for heating water and a separate prayer hall for women."
273,Huge and beautiful,"This is a majestic mosque located opposite to Agra Fort. It is built in red sandstone.  The sculpture work is marble is quite impressive. Also, the carvings are very intricate and detailed. Views of Agra fort can be seen from it."
274,Wasn't able to go inside the complex,"An exquisite statement in red sandstone and marble, India's largest mosque was the last monument commissioned by Shah Jahan. Completed in 1656 after six years of work by 5,000 laborers, it's arguably one of the loveliest houses of worship in the world. Three sets of broad steps lead to two-story gateways and a magnificent courtyard with a square ablution tank in the center. The entire space is enclosed by pillared corridors, with domed pavilions in each corner. Thousands gather to pray here, especially on Friday.With its onion-shaped dome and tapering minarets, the mosque is characteristically Mughal, but Shah Jahan added an innovation: the stripes running up and down the marble domes and minarets. The whole structure exudes peace and harmony—climb the south minaret to see the domes up close, complete with swarms of pigeons, and to see how finely the mosque contrasts with the commercial streets around it."
275,Biggest Mosque in India,We weren't too interested in going beforehand but were so pleased that we did and it far exceeded our expectations.Worth climbing the tower to get a view down on Delhi.
276,A mosque with history,"In the summer of July 2007, as part of the Golden Triangle package.  The mosque's architecture is superb, a little busy at times, beautiful mosque.  Beware of the season that you visit because of the steamy hot weather.  To fully enjoy please pick a cooler season.  Reading a brief history about this mosque may help in being more connected. This way you will learn and remember much easily."
277,Lovely Mosque,This is one of the largest mosque in India! It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1644 and 1656! We could not enter because we were there during their prayer time and only Muslim’s are allowed inside! We saw the mosque from outside took a few pics and left!
