0,Beautiful and tranquil,"This gorgeous national park, a quick train-ride from Tokyo, is a beautiful trip away from the rush and press of urban life.  It has breathtaking waterfalls and lots of hiking trails that cater to different levels, and there are nearby temples if you want to sit and relax for a bit."
1,Amazing National Park!,"This park is beautiful, and only a few hours from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The scenery is spectacular, from the temples to the waterfall and lake to the huge trees and mountains."
2,"Surprising, Natural Nikko National Park","It's a perfect day trip from Tokyo to Nikko; and Nikko National Park is a must place to visit. The park has all Nikko Top Attractions, including Shinkyo bridge, Rinno Ji, Nikko Toshogu and Futarasan Jinja.It's highly recommended to get an early train from Tokyo as many visitors visit Nikko late morning."
3,Popular Autumn Trip,"What a wonderful time ! Just a few hours outside Tokyo you can find historic temples and shrines, beautiful scenery and fabulousness Japanese style accommodations. The Onsens (natural hot baths) are fabulous. We had a marvelous time."
4,A Fun Weekend Trip with Friends,Nikko is worthy of a day trip from Tokyo. A stunning place with amazing examples of historic shrines and temples. A little crowded but hey...its Japan.
5,Deep History within the Nature,"This is such a scenic place relatively close to Tokyo, yet you will need to plan a good day away for it! And be sure to be camera ready! Ideally Autumn with the magical color display by nature! (Visited November)"
6,Nice program,"It was quite the walk from the train station (shuttles are available, but the walk was an experience on its own). A nice walk, really. When I'm in a new place, I like to walk as much as possible so I can take in the local scenery. And once you get to the park, the feeling is unreal. The scenery is gorgeous. We spent quite a few hours exploring, along with visiting the temples and shrines. The entire time, I was awestruck at the nature all around me. The melodic streams, the lush green, thick treetops, bits of wildlife here and there, and the refreshing smell of the outdoors. We ate at a little restaurant not far from the train station, but if I go again, I think I'd rather pack a lunch and eat outdoors at the park. It's such a peaceful place to be, and there wasn't a huge crowd when we visited, which was nice. I'm sure it can get crowded, but luckily it wasn't bad when we went. If you're thinking about going to Nikko, just go!"
7,Nikko National Park ,The trip is quite long from Tokyo. We had this tour together with Edo Wonderland. It's a lovely place during our autumn visit though the place is much crowded. But the tour guide gives us a wonderful background of the place.
8,"Excellent in cloudy weather, check out the cafe at the entrance","Absolutely scenic place and worth a days side trip from Tokyo..one can buy a 2 day Nikko pass to travel from Tokyo..if you have more time, the all nikko pass allows you to travel more to see the waterfalls and onsen and lake"
9,Nice day trip to visit world heritage sites,"Nikko is an amazing part of Japanese history! With beautiful temples and buildings! One thing for the English speaking tourists, all of the signs are in Japanese and very little information in English! If you wish to market to tourism you should have all your signs in both English and Japanese at least."
10,Beautiful ,Quite a far bus ride from Tokyo but this UNESCO World Heritage Site is worth the visit.  It is quite large so you need hustle a bit to see the entire place given a short time given by the tour.
11,Beautiful,"We did this as a day trip from Tokyo, and loved how different it was to the bustling city. It's the Japan of old that you imagine, with beautiful temples hidden in woods, and fantastic hikes. I cannot recommend coming to Nikko enough."
12,Great area to escape to from Tokyo,"What a great place to visit, just two hours from Tokyo.  Cool, fresh mountain air and waterfalls.Unforgettable!"
13,Lovely National Park,I had a great day exploring Nikko using the Tobu train and bus day pass. Easy to explore a beautiful area rich in history. Highly recommend
14,Absolute tranquility!,"Nikko is a day trip from Tokyo, and we were happy to do it. The area is well maintained, the temples beautiful and the atmosphere full of religious respect. Just remember that in summer it can be very hot, bring a hat and some water for your stroll."
15,Stunning view of Mt. Fuji-san,"During our time in Nikko we spent a lot of time enjoying what this National Park has to offer from the magnificent Temple and Shrines to the lovely waterfalls, lakes rivers, towering mountains  and so much beautifull nature scenes and it's history. This is a must place to visit if you are in Japan. Nikko town itself is very nice plenty of places to eat and stay and good shopping, easy to get to by train as the station is right in town.We loved our time here and apparently The Japanese say you have not finished if you have not been to Nikko , put it on your bucket list."
16,Beautiful National Park,"This was the best day we spent outside Tokyo! Nikko was easy to get to on the train and main attractions are a short bus ride from the station. If you enjoy walking, this will be a great place to visit. A few temples are under renovation but there is still a lot to see. It was actually very interesting to see how the renovation is being done when you go inside the temple. Amazing  temples and serene gardens! Definitely a must see! A bus ride to the lake was beautiful on the mountain winding road. But if you don't have enough time, you can skip the falls."
17,Hiring a bus to visit Nikko National Park,"Our plan was to get “away from the lights and crowd” of Tokyo and headed north to the world heritage Shrines and Temples of Nikko. A sacred site tucked away in the Nikko National Park. It was about a 2 hour drive into the rural areas; then mountain hills and forests. Really interesting scenery. The place itself was pretty crowded, but we were able to manoeuvre quite nimbly and saw things such as the Shinto Nikko Toshogu Shrine; Stone Torii Gate; etc. A good place to visit for the day."
18,Beautiful ,Nikko national park is wonderful. The temples are spectacular but the town is also nice to wonder around. The only problem we found was that the place was really over-run with both tourists and school children when we visited (in November).
19,Fabulous,We only had time for a day trip but it was a great day! The scenery and temples were beautiful - if we go again we'll be staying a few nights to really take in everything it has to offer. An easy train ride from Tokyo.
20,Nikko is beautiful ,"After spending a week in Tokyo , the amazing natural sceneries at the Nikko Park provided the much needed breathing space .   Together with my wonderful local friend Tomoyuki I experienced a very quite day of hiking , listening to waterfalls and relaxing at a Onsen . If you have the chance to go here and love to be outdoors and just admire the beauty of mother nature . . . GO ! Just GO ! You won't regret it ."
21,well worth a visit,"Nikko is a MUST SEE for everyone. The shrines and sights here are incredibly well maintained and the mountain scenery is wonderful. It’s easy to see why the Shogun fell in love with this place. It has a spiritual feel to it.Mid March temperatures were chilly and damp, but the day was crisp and pleasant. Our guide, Mr. Yasuhiko Ota was knowledgeable and enthusiastic and his love for his country and it’s history was apparent. We were there for only a few hours, making a day trip from Tokyo, but with 42 elaborate structures to visit I suggest that an overnight visit would be a better call. Besides the amazing Tosho-gu complex there are the Rinno-ji temple, Shinkyo Bridge, the Bodhisvatta Jizo statutes and so much more to see, plus it would be heavenly to hike some of the many trails."
22,Spectacular and very accessible for a Western tourist,"This is a very good place to visit outside of the city. It's has a good combination of nature and historical sites that you'll feel like you're in paradise. There are lots of shrines here. The main shrines can be accessed via the bus, but you can also take the historical walking tour following a simple map (and help of google maps) to visit all of the nearby shrines and attractions. If you have enough time, can you also do hiking tours, but it will require far more preparation and you'll be venturing into unpaved paths."
23,Extremely significant Japanese sites,"A great day with a wonderful guide. Cold and windy because of wintertime, however, we had the park to ourselves. The lake, waterfall and scenery was well worth the trip."
24,Well Preserved Temples,"I went for a day trip from Tokyo. This place was amazing in Autumn with many waterfalls, lakes, trees were in red and yellow. Do not miss this place in your trip."
25,Good view,It is an amazing park with a lot of things to see. I visited this park during the weekend traveling from Tokyo. I spent one day in here.I enjoyed the culture and food as well.
26,Impressive National Park,"A beautiful quiet place, an escape from the crowds, with huge tall 400 year old cedar trees and breathtaking mountains in the background"
27,Beautiful & Highlight,Took the bus from the train station to the cable car lift for an amazing mountain top vista and then a great hike through shrine ruins. Highly recommend this area both in the Fall to see the changing leaves' color and in the Spring for the flowering trees - magical in both cases.
28,Beautiful national park,"If you want traditional backpacking close to Tokyo - about 2 hrs by train - Nikko is a great choice to stay a couple nights. I was there 3d/2n and that was plenty of time to do everything. A good itinerary is Day 1: Kegon Falls + Lake Chuzenji Day 2: Senjyogahara Plateau + Yutaki Fall + Yuomoto OnsenDay 3: Tosho-gu Shrine + Takino Walking pathUnless you're a temple/shrine junkie I'd just go to Tosho-gu and skip Rinnoji, Taiyuin and Futarasan. Even Tosho-gu was kind of lame and it is the premier temple at Nikko. There are decent, cheap hostels in the area - I stayed at Nikko Guesthouse Sumica based on reviews and it was fantastic. One last thing: if you are coming from Tokyo and going back there get the All Nikko Pass. It includes a round trip to Nikko from Tokyo and an unlimited bus pass for the Chuzenji/World Heritage/Yuomoto routes. (The buses are very expensive, so even if you don't get the ANP get the separate bus pass for 2000 yen!) The ANP is around 4600 Y and is totally worth it. My favorite parts of the trip were the Takino walking path - very peaceful, woodsy and almost deserted - and Yutaki waterfall - very touristy but you're right up close to the falls unlike Kegon. Make sure you climb to the crest, if you're a fitness junkie like me it'll set your heart pounding (it's steep and about 1400m above the sea) and once you're up there lean against the wooden fence and feel the spray hit your face and a strange but pleasant salty smell in the air. Very relaxing!"
29,Highlight in Nikko,"The entire park is very walkable we did it in half day including visiting all the shrines and museums within. Not a difficult walk at all and scenery demands we walk slowly to enjoy and take in the crisp winter air and lovely sun. On a weekday it is peaceful and quiet, and makes a good day trip from the bustling city of japan otherwise. Entrance is opposite from shinkyo bridge near tobu bus stop 7."
30,Beautiful!   Bello!,"The train ride to Nikko was a sharp departure from the crowded trains and congested areas that you would usually see from the windows of a train.  The trip to Nikko showcased an area of Japan beautifully rural and as we got closer to Nikko the mountains with snow remaining was instantly relaxing.  The only caveat would be that one of the attractions is undergoing a major renovation and will be for a number of years.  This being said, they still charged tourists to view one of the three Buddhas amonst all the construction. The area that was open, the Shrine of Toshu-gu was beautiful with numerous photo opportunities."
31,Lovely national park ,"We spent 2 nights in the Nikko area as a short trip away from Tokyo, and it was a great contrast to the crazy chaos of the city. If you're looking to get away from Tokyo but can't travel too far, this is a good option. Really easy to get to and plenty to see. Couple of things: be aware that the Tobu train from Tokyo splits in two so you need to be in the right carriage; trains between the two main tourist areas in Nikko become infrequent after about 4pm; some hotels won't have any english speakers so be prepared to adopt ""international hand gestures"" to communicate if you're Japanese is limited; and you don't need to stay in Nikko town to explore the area - if you pay attention to the train timetable to you can easily stay in some of the lovely hotels near Kinugawa and reach Nikko national park by train. There are a couple of value passes for Nikko which you can buy, covering the round trip from Tokyo (departing Asakusa and Tokyo Sky Tree stations) and bus/train rides between areas once you arrived, and they're worth checking out. We bought a 4 day Nikko pass from the Tobu Travel Agency office downstairs at the Asakusa Tobu Rail Station (note: this is in a different location to the Asakusa Metro station. Ask at the Asakusa tourist building, which is directly opposite the Sensoji Temple, for directions if you get lost). Staff in the Tobu travel office are really helpful so feel free to ask which pass gives the best value for your trip - I nearly bought a 2 day pass but I'm glad I double checked with them, otherwise my ticket wouldn't have been valid for my return journey. Passes are valid for the rapid/section rapid trains, which are a little tired and stop at every little place on the way. You can pay extra to upgrade to the Express train which is faster and allows for more flexible travelling between Nikko town and Kinugawa Onsen, but I'm not sure you really need it. We bought ours right before we travelled, so I don't think you need to book. Platforms are upstairs in the station, and make sure you choose the correct carriage as the train splits at Shimo-Imaichi - front carriages go to Kinugawa, rear 2 to Nikko town (the platform has signs to show you).Nikko is essentially made up of two areas worth visiting - the main Nikko national park which is accessed from Nikko town by a really convenient bus outside the Nikko train station. This has the famous shrines, bridge, Kegon falls and Lake Chizunji and seriously dramatic scenery. This bus is included if you buy one of the Nikko passes, otherwise it's quite pricey. Then there's the Kinugawa Onsen area, which has rapids, a rope walk, monkey viewing platform and famous hot springs. The two areas aren't directly linked by train, they're more like two prongs of a fork and you have to change at Shimo-Imaichi station if you want to travel between them. This is doable, takes about 40 minutes to go from Kinugawa Onsen to Nikko town via Shimo imaichi, but the connections get infrequent after about 4pm unless you ride the Limited Express (about 300 yen extra per ride if you didn't upgrade your pass). Faced with a 2hr wait for a train from Shimo-Imaichi to our hotel in Kosagoe (one stop before Kinugawa Onsen), we decided to pay the 300 yen extra to ride the express only to find it didn't stop in our tiny village, so ended up getting a taxi (1900 yen!) from Kinugawa. Teach us for not checking the timetable!We managed the Kegon falls, Lake Chizunji and a hike up part of Mount Nantai in one day. I would have liked to have visited the Kinugawa Onsen area too, especially as we were more conveniently based for this, but we ran out of time.Basically pay attention to the timetable and map you get with your Nikko pass from the Tobu travel agency and plan your travel times and you will be fine. The bus ride up to the Nikko national park is great in itself as you get a sense of just how high up you're going (once you're there, you easily forget!).  Platforms for the train are upstairs in the station, and *make sure you get on the correct carriage*. Nikko is essentially served by a train line which forks in two directions: one to Nikko town, the other to Kinugawa Onsen. Trains split at the junction between these destinations, but there are signs on the platform floor and in the carriages themselves which tell you the final destination."
32,Day pass perfection,"We took a day trip to Nikko from Tokyo.  You can get a Nikko World Heritage Pass which covers the round-trip regular train service to Nikko from Asakusa (takes 3 hrs with transfers), or around double the price if you add-on the Limited Express train fee for a shorter 2 hr trip with no transfers. Nikko is a beautiful area where historic temples/shrines are located.  Worth a visit if you can spare the time. Not as beautiful as Koyasan though. All restaurants are overpriced, but is expected."
33,Very nice ,"The park was beautiful, I loved the Nikko Toshogu Shrine, the carvings were magnificent. It was such a pleasure to get away from the noise and people of Tokyo for a day and ensure the beauty of the mountains. Pure pleasure.I am definitely glad we booked this trip - it was a lovely way to end our time in Japan. I would highly recommend it."
34,Great Walk with Beautiful Scenery,Nikko Japan is naturally beautiful little city about 1 hour drive from Tokyo The shrine garden and mountain shrine Both amazing The park has a beautiful water falls Little walking to do but worth it
35,great way to experience Japan's history,"Visiting Nikko for the first time and this is just a gem in Japan, so beautiful and with a lot of culture this is quite a natural wonder with the waterfalls and tracks in the parks where you can appreciated the trees and the natural around"
36,A beautiful park with varied scenery,"Visited while exploring all Nikko heritage sites, a must to include in your visit, peaceful sceneries and great to walk around and take pictures."
37,Wonderful nature.  Great trails.  Easy for the family.,"Spent 2 wonderful and refreshing  days in Nikko ,love the natural surroundings and lush forests .Only made a quick stop at the Unesco Heritage temples and shrines - this attraction can be crowded at peak visiting hours as I prefer to spend more time wandering to quiet nature sites .One of the highlight of my trip was walking the path along the Daiya river to Kanmangafuchi Abyss and  stone park .The Bake Jizo stone statues is a mysterious place with with its 70 or so stone statues of jizo lined up along the route.Fantastic views of of the gorge flowing through the forest - and I only met a few travellers walking on its path within the hour I was there. The Tobu buses do not go to this area ,you need to walk a bit to get there ."
38,Amazing park ,"Have to traverse 48 hairpin curves to get to this lovely place.  Nice Kegon Waterfall, interesting trails, but it was crowded when we were there."
39,Amazing park ,"Amazing day trip, one of the best highlights during our visit to Japan. Nikko is absolutely stunning. All the stops are well timed but the park is huge so you're only just scratching the surface but what you do see is amazing. Make sure you go into the building with the crying Dragon! Highly recommend."
40,Fantastic Place,"Another must see! Lots and lots of walking. Waterfalls, mountains, monkeys, volcanos, winding roads...Do not miss this one!"
41,Great hike and spectacular views,We loved this national park and hiking to see several waterfalls. The trails are in excellent condition and there are amenities such as a tea house at the larger stops on the trail.
42,Appreciate a mix of Shinto and Buddhism Architecture ,"If you are planning a visit to Nikko and like trekking, Nikko National Park is worth a day. I have done it several times including mid-winter when heavy snow blocked some of the trails and a group of visitors from India on my bus remarked that it was the first time they had ever seen snow. I particularly like the hike from Ryuzu Falls to Yumoto Lake and the village of lodges and ryokan at the terminal point, the northern shore of the Lake. You can picnic on a few tables on the lake. The bus from Nikko to the Falls is in itself an experience, going up to Nikko National Park around a meandering road and hairpin turns. If you are going to be in Nikko for a few days, consider a Nikko Pass, discounted and valued for several days."
43,Beautiful trip away from Tokyo's busyness,"Love the ambiance of Nikko, even it's quite far from Tokyo. It took around 2 hours by train, but when you get there, you'll be amazed by the view."
44,Come Here to Hike,I visit Japan every year for business but always take two days for pleasure. This place is really worth to spend two days minimum. Relatively short trip from Tokio by train. Buy a bus pass and book Japanese type of room in hotel to complete your fun package. If you are not very in Japanese history half day is enough to see main temples and shrines. But my advice to dedicate one day for the park itself ... take a bus to the very top last stop (Yuno Lake) so you can go by foot down to Kegon Falls and get on the bus to return to the town. It's long trip but worth every minutes.
45,Great area accessible by public transportation,"This national park is about 2 hours away from Tokyo. It’s a beautiful place with foliage trees, water falls and lakes.Early November is a good time to visit. There are 3 sections of the Park that you can choose to visit. And you must take a Tobu Bus to go to those places.Section 1 is from Nikko station to Bus stop #26. Section 2 is from Bus stop #26 to 35Section 3 is from Bus stop 35 to beyond Most people go to section 1 with lots of sightseeing like shrines, temples and a big lake (where you can board a boat cruise)Section 2 and 3 are less people but more romantic if you two couple want more bit romantic time together. Make sure you know the Bus schedule for going back to Nikko station because it gets dark quickly after 5pm. There’s a limited schedule for both Bus and train at Nikko National Park. Please ask the tourist information people for details."
46,The unbelivable and wonderful city in Japan,Impressive compound of temples and monuments . I would suggest the day tour from Keio hotel in English . Travel time and tour takes up the entire day from Tokyo
47,Nikko National Park,"Sweet little town, nestling in the hills above Tokyo. We travelled by Shinkansen (bullet train) from Tokyo to Utsunomiya (about an hour) and then picked up the little Nikko Line train to the town itself. Main attraction is the World Heritage Site filled with temples and shrines a 20 minute walk uphill or a short bus ride from the railway station to the attractive Shin-kyo Bridge by the entrance to the Site. Unfortunately until 2020 some temples are undergoing restoration so there is a fair bit of screening off of sections. That said there is still a lot to explore and see and the restoration gives an opportunity to look down on the detailed building work and see some amazing structures.You are also able to catch a bus further up into the mountains to Chuzenji via some 'interesting' hairpin bends to the Kegon Falls which is a 90 Metre high waterfall with an elevator that takes you to its base and makes for a stunning view.  There is also the massive Chuzenji Lake within a few hundred metres from the falls which it feeds.One point to remember when up at the falls/lake is not to mistime your journey back down by bus as the trains back are not that frequent."
48,Impressive,If you are looking to experience some japanese countryside from Tokyo. Hire a car or get on the yrain up to Nikko. Lovely area
49,A great day trip from Tokyo. ,"We were lucky – the weather was sunny, very little traffic, and we enjoyed the views of Mt. Fuji and Japanese Alps.  Visited Kedon Falls, Chuzenji Lake, enjoyed the ride on Irohazaka Route."
50,Beautiful but not stunning,"A wonderful park, divine nature and also check out the cafe ar the entry - some nice marcha options, grewn tea and sweets. Overall, really lovely and totally worth the trip from Tokyo!"
51,"Go, Go, Go",absolutely gorgeous to visit during fall season. Take the small roads that follow streams. Beautiful hikes and waterfalls.
52,Nice hiking trail,Very  nice surprise. Lovely  heritage site. Beautiful  temple. Truly a gorgeous treasure of  Japan. Must visit if in the area.
53,best ensemble of shrines and gates in wonderful landscape,"I would highly recommend this as a day out to anyone visiting Japan/Tokyo. I visited this as a day trip from Tokyo, but you would do well to spend longer exploring this beautiful National Park. The entrance to the park is free, but you must pay to enter the shrines and temples, which is most definitely worthwhile! I visited on a Friday in January, it was very quiet, calm and peaceful. Such a relaxing day. I imagine visiting in Autumn must be astoundingly beautiful, but even in the depths of winter, this really was an incredible place to visit. To visit from Tokyo, I HIGHLY recommend catching the direct train from Asakusa station. There is a little booth on the ground floor by the entrance, where you can purchase your tickets. The staff speak excellent English, and they will tell you to buy a two day travel ticket, as even when visiting for only one day, this is the cheapest option. The ticket is great value. Just pay attention to what the staff say -- you have to sit in the back two carriages, as the train separates before arriving in Nikko. This ticket also gives you free bus travel when you arrive, but I would recommend walking to the national park from the station. Its very easy to find, and a lovely 20/30min stroll, pottering in and out of traditional shops. There was a restaurant at the top of the road, right across from Shinkyo Bridge, which served exceptionally delicious udon, and was much more reasonably priced than a lot of the places we passed on our way. The only reason I have not given this 5 stars, is because during my visit, parts of the shrines were closed for renovation, and some of the staff weren't very polite/helpful. But this was only a minor problem, and definitely didn't overshadow a wonderful day out."
54,Authentic architecture of these shrines better than Tokyo,"Absolutely beautiful during the fall months- incredible hiking with breathtaking views! Several possible hikes to choose from, but be sure to see the Ryuzu Waterfall!"
55,Wonderful park well worth the visit!  ,"It's worth visiting the park to walk along the river, pass the waterfalls and enjoy absolute tranquility and silence! Beware of bears and deers! Nice little Japanese cafes at the entrance."
56,If more time in Tokyo,"we enjoyed going here because of snow, it is an area for temples and nature, so if you are in to this kind of adventure then go."
57,Good day trip beautiful scenary,"Loved the park, it was cold but we saw the kirifuri no Taki waterfall, and the Spring buds were coming out. We enjoy spring when trees are not in full leaf because one can see so much more!The Nikko collection of World Heritage listed gilded shrines and temples were truly amazing, the intricate details on them and colour, we saw the beautiful inside of many also. So many to see so take your time and a good guide is helpful. We saw the "" see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil monkeys also, and other stories which were amusing. Not to be missed"
58,Cable Car to Glorious Views,"This place is magic!! I did about 15kms of walking and I loved every minute of it. Here in Autum so the changing of the leaves is a bonus. But with out this you have everything you could need to have a fantastic day, fresh air, spectacular waterfalls, buses doing no less then 49 hairpin turns, and the majestic mountains raising up all around you. Walks are to taxing...unless you want them to be. Lay in one of the Onsens and dream about being active if you have to!! Just get there...it is grand"
59,Nikko,Trying to travel around Nikko National Park by the local bus was time consuming and expensive. We would definitely travel by our own transport next time. The day was very wet and there weren't many bus shelters and also the buses were not as frequent as expected or as economical. The two falls were definitely worth seeing especially the Ryuzu waterfalls and the gorgeous walk up to the top road. In early October the trees were starting to change colour looking spectacular. Because of the time used up by waiting for buses we missed seeing the open air Yumato onsen which looks fantastic too.
60,A MUST VISIT,We loved Nikko National Park and were lucky enough to see it in autumn.  Unfortunately we shared the place with hundreds of school kids which spoiled the vibe somewhat!  Choose your visiting time carefully!
61,Historical area,This view is good and we can enjoy the weather.  But the transportation is not so good. We need to wait almost 5 hours in the open space and cold weather and no other option to back to the station. Need more solution for transportation
62,Gets very crowded,"Nikko is Nippon, you can see both historical and natural in Nikko. It’s very nice place to go. But you have to spend more 2 hours ride from Tokyo."
63,Beautiful!,This area is really nice and bueatiful.  Water falls almost 300 feet.  I recommend the elevator trip to the bottom it only cost 550 yen.  Resturants in the are are the same and not allot of variety.  I would recommend this as a day trip it is very relaxing and great scenery.
64,NOT tourist friendly at all,"We travelled in a group. The National Park is definitely worth a visit.Kegon Falls, Chuzenji Lake, are beautiful. See the photos. We went in May and there were quite a few tour bus and tourists group around."
65,Beauty of the color,The National Park itself is beautiful and provides a stunning site for the complex of shrines and temples within. There is an entrance fee for the temples but well worth it. Possible to walk here from Nikko Station but easier to take the bus if time is limited.
66,Beautiful place,"A beautiful spot with well maintained and significant temples. At weekends it gets very crowded. We walked the Takino Path, through the forest, which was very beautiful. You can get a walking map from the tourist office. I would recommend this as when you get past the main temples, everything is in Japanese, so a map with pictures, helps you work out what you are looking at. The path is not well signposted."
67,Stay away on weekend,"Nikkō National Park is a breathtaking park you do not want to miss. It's absolutely phenomenal and alive with rich culture and history. It's unlike any national park I have ever visited.I'm from the states, so to me national parks literally mean parks full of nature. Maybe a canyon or a geyser here and there surrounded by trees. But in Japan, WOW! There's mountains and mountains of forestation and cedar trees as tall as buildings! And so many gorgeous temples and shrines to visit! I was taken away to how colorful and amazing each building and gate was. It's as if time has stopped and I stepped right into history. I had the most wondrous time.Whether you're a history buff, book worm, city girl -- doesn't matter! This park is a must see site for all! And it's definitely a suitable tourist location for the young and old, family vacations and even with friends. Enjoy!"
68,Gorgeous,"Really worth spending the whole day or two in Nikko, not only it has the shrines and cultural heritage sites but the waterfalls are absolutely amazing. Make sure you get the hiking map and take the bus to the falls, then go for 1 hour hike along the lake and you will end up agh the cascade of waterfalls. Really beautiful scenery."
69,Naturally beautiful ,"The shrines and temples at Nikko are beautiful. And there are so many of them.  The park is a great setting for them and trees in the park complement them perfectly. The first temple we visited was being extensively renovated and we wondered whether we had been ripped off. But when we walked further on we realised that there were many more to see.Overall there is a wonderful sense of peace, especially in some of the further parts of the park where there are less visitors.We walked from the railway station to the park, but them caught the bus upto the Kegon Falls and Lake Chusenji. It was a lovely drive, but the bus was very expensive."
70,Peaceful and calm place to look around ,"Took an all day tour through Viator to what is a large national park with what we were hoping would be plenty of Autumn color at the end of September.  Sadly, it hasn't been cold enough (even though it was only 11 degrees when we were there) and so there wasn't much to see.  Further, the weather was quite overcast, so as soon as you get to any elevation, the views disappear and there's nothing to see.  The town of Nikko was a nice looking place, but the tour didn't stop there.  Driver/guide was very good"
71,Very Different From Your Typical National Park!,"This is a good sized park with many places to stop and see.  We bought the bus pass which makes it very easy and accessible.  There are hot springs, temples, shrines, lakes, waterfalls and more."
72,This place must be one of top 5 to visit in Japan,"We hiked about six hours in the park. The views are wonderful and the waterfalls are gorgeous. The hiking trails are used by people of all ages, although some of the areas require slippery, two-foot high steps."
73,Must see!!!,From Nikkō take the bus to Yumoto. Nice hike around the lake then Yudaki falls and along to the river and through the moor. Interesting hiking well indicated and maintained. Board the bus again on the main road.
74,Many things to see,"For me would not necessarily recommend. We purchased the Tobu 2 day rail and bus pass which provided you with the train from Asakusa skytree station and the bus to the world heritage sites. We paid 2670 y each. Entrance to most world heritage temples are not included. Be warned this part of country is a lot colder at this time of year, and was covered in snow and ice and was a lot lower than temperatures in Tokyo. The reason I would not really recommend it is because my experience at Rinnoji Temple was disappointing to say the least. Although it is clear that there is work being carried out from the scaffolding outside, after paying the entrance fee, we expected a little glimpse of the temple inside the scaffolding but it was all covered. Work is expected to finish in 2021. Not worth entrance fee, you get a better feel of what the temple looked like from the picture on scaffolding outside without paying an entrance fee so be warned. Also visited some other famous temples that offered a lovely little complex of gates, memorial related buildings and temples. All lovely decorated and in a stunning lovely rural area. However alone not worth the visit all the way here when similar sites can be found in central Tokyo. We found that possibly due to erosion, most of the shrines and temples had been rebuilt in stone rather than in wood. This took a lot away from the authenticity of the place and for us, made it more manufactural and less of an authentic type of experience."
75,A must visit,"we woke up early to catch an early train ride and transferred to a bus to reach Nikko spots. we visited kegon falls, rode the bus around nikko to see the famous shinkyo bridge. you have to pay to cross the bridge. we saw the Taiyuin, the iyemitsu mausoleum. I think they have 4-5 major shrines but we visited only 3. bus was our mode of transportation around nikko. make sure you have a comfortable pair of shoes. there will be a lot of walking. travel light or carry a small backpack. take pictures of the shrines and the sign board of the shrine. you have to pay entrance fee to go inside the shrines. do not hurry and appreciate the intricate design and structure. I suggest that you stay over night in nikko to see all the shrines and tourist spots."
76,Get the Walking Trail Map,"Japan as its best. No rush hours, no neon lights. Just pure tranquility. Enjoy nature's perfection and Japan's countryside as well."
77,A gorgeous mix of man made and natural beauty.,"Walking in the national park was the highlight of our recent trip to Nikko. The autumn colours were at its peak. One could spend a few hours or days here. There are many trails. We took DexterD2013’s suggestion to take the bus up and walked our way down. We didn’t go all the way up to Yumoto Onsen but worked our way down from just above the Senjogahara Moor, past Ryukyu Falls and hopped back on the bus at Stop 34 to Kegon Falls. The attractions were busy as tourists mainly get bused from one attraction to the next but the trail was quiet.The trails were well marked and easy to walk. Comfortable walking shoes are a must but doesn’t need hiking boots. Outerwear that keeps moisture out would be handy as the weather up there is hard to predict. Markedly cooler than Nikko. Most of the walk was under cover so sun protection is less critical."
78,Long day all worth it .,Went up all the way to lake Yunoko. Such a wonderful place to see the leaves turn into beautiful colors in late Octover.
79,"Very good views, away from the city, historical sites","We took a climbing many stairs walk in this park.  Enjoying the cherry trees in bloom.  The park is quiet as this is spring and not many people about today.  Viewed the Pagoda, and possibly tea house, no sign on it so just a guess.  Nice to roam about and take in the sights of nature"
80,Beautiful place,I recently visited Nikko whilst staying in Utsunomiya. Excellent way to destress after city working. From Tokyo get the Shinkansen (about 4500 Yen) takes about 50 mins. Then take the Nikko line directly from Utsunomiya. Again about 50 mins. At Nikko station get all the advice you need and saver tickets for the shrine and other attractions. The hop on hop off bus is ideal way to explore Nikko
81,"Lovely landscape and views, fascinating shrines.","We took a bus on a Sunday from 2pm and was headed to Lake Chuzenji. A supposedly 40 min bus ride became a 4 hour ride! My 6 year old son had to stand throughout the bus ride. They shouldn't have allowed so many cars to head up the 1-2 lane one way up the mountain. We couldn't disembark to head home instead but were all stuck in a crowded bus. It was a nightmare. By the time we reached at 6pm, everything was dark and we had to wait in a long queue to get on the 2 hour bus ride back to town. It was the worst experience ever. We wasted a precious half day. Avoid weekends or Sundays at all costs! The public buses just boarded everyone.  There should have been some warning system to stop crowds from thronging up the mountains if they can't handle the volume."
82,Very serene,"The Nikko National Park is north of Tokyo and comprises 250, 000 acres of mountain vistas, ancient trees, lakes and rivers as well as numerous shrines and temples.  Nikko means sunlight and even though it was raining when we were there the light through the trees was wonderful.  The park is recognised by UNESCO was a World Heritage Site."
83,When in Nikko,"Even with the off and on rain  it was a wonderful day! The huge cedar trees and architecture is absolute stunning! I just wish that we could have had a couple of days to enjoy the beauty of this place! We took the bus from the train station. It was cool and rainy and there are a lot of hills, so we were happy to ride the bus for a very nominal fee!"
84,"Nikko, a stop not to miss",This park is full of people in October and November. The most beautiful place to see Autumn colors. Need to spend 2-3 days if you can really stay and so wonderful tracking routes and many water falls.
85,Simply beautiful,"I  really enjoyed my time in this park, the lake, the waterfalls, the foliage, the hikes and the temples for more info and photos read http://travelwellflysafe.com/2014/12/19/temples-of-nikko-japan/"
86,"Beautiful nature and scenery ,though can be crowded at some places","Really nice natural park, so many falls and nature to see, real beauty of autum, easy self-drive for non-local people. Worth to spend a day or two here."
87,Just beautiful ,"This a great park in the middle of the Nikko Shrines and Temples UNESCO world heritage site. With walking paths leading up to the shrines, there are also little hidden gems that mark the history of Nikko's rise as a tourist destination of Japan. Accessing the Shinkyo (Divine Bridge) up to Rinno-ji and the highlight of Nikko, Toshogu shrine. You can always take a bus to these locations but the best experience is walking through the forest to each destination."
88,Wonderful day trip from Tokyo,"This was a day trip with friends while visiting Japan. We had read about Nikko National Park and how beautiful it is, and let me lay it out straight for you - they are all true! I was there during Japan's Silver Week, so it was very crowded.The town itself is quaint, and rather small. But, the reason people come here is to visit the Shinkyo Bridge ) the red bridge just at the edge of town, Tosho-gu, and enjoy nature. The shrine, which consists of numerous buildings, is a sight to behold by itself, and worth speding at least half a day to take in the culture and history. Don't forget to spot the Three Wise Monkeys (of the ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" fame) carving. In the same area is also Ieyasu's mausoleum, but be ready to walk up a long flight of steps.About a half-hour's leisurely walk away is Kanmangafuchi Abyss, a park where you'll get to see Nikko's Narabi Jizos (stone statues). The park is pleasant to walk in, and the view is beautiful. A river runs through the park, and I would imagine everything to turn even more stunning in autumn with all the golden leaves.All in all, Nikko's well worth spending a day, and I reckon even two to enjoy what it has to offer."
89,Fantastic fall foliage at Nikko National Park but terrible public transportation,Nikko National Park is located close to Tokyo and can use Shinkansen (bullet train) to get there with very reasonable time. Nikko can be visited over the weekend for it offers so much to do from hiking in really peaceful cedar tree forest to visiting very significant as well as historical facilities built early 1600's by Tokugawa Shogun. This place is as good as visiting Kyoto but closer to Tokyo.
90,Best hiking experience,"We unfortunately visited Nikko in a downpour but even in the rain Nikko was beautiful, there was something quite mystical about it."
91,Beautiful but somewhat confusing,"My friend and I have booked for a train for Nikko. Why not? It's a long public holiday in Japan and it is World's heritage. We went there on November from Tokyo and it is about the time that leaves changed colours. I check the temperature that day and 2 degree celsius is something that we really need to prepare. The ticket for Nikko is at the sales office in Asakusa station. You can look for the Tobu pass and here is the link: [http://www.tobu.co.jp/foreign/ ] You can book the ticket online but it requires 4 days before departure date. So, if you don't have much time to spare or it is a pop up decision like us you probably just get the ticket a day before. I recommend the earliest train which is depart around 6 am. and you can spend a whole day at Nikko because the last train from Nikko to Tokyo is about 16.45pm Well, I only have one day but 2 days at least I would say is the best. About that time we couldn't manage to get the hotel in Nikko because it is a public holiday. I guess that everyone also wants to enjoy their holiday. I wasn't surprised that I saw many license plates from many prefectures. There are to entries from Tokyo which are from Asakusa station on Platform 6th and from Tokyo sky tree.Please check again from the website in case if they change anything. If you enter from Asakusa you will have a better chance to take a seat. Of course this is an ordinary train but they also have Nikko express which you can book your seat, but  I'd rather save a few yens for something else. Food: Manjyu is a sweet that you must try!! I strongly recommend!!! You can see how many exclamation marks that I put!!!. Really! When you arrive at Nikko it is best to purchase a bus ticket (in case that you didn't bought it with the train ticket. Check the website for more info.Better buy all Nikko pass or 2 day pass and save your time from a long lines.) Exit the station and look to the right and there is the sign of manjyu!!Attractions: Please note that Nikko is not just a place. It is an area which lives there are blend with nature. You can look for beautiful scenery from everywhere. So I would say all you can see and all you can eat. There is a hi-light about Toshogu shrine and the main shrine with big Buddha which this part will open successfully in 2020. So be patient.Cable car ticket is discounted when you show your train ticket and so as many restaurants and confection stores.You can get a tour if you want. Please ask from the train ticket booth from Asakusa which can help you plan ahead. Time: be cautious about bus and train schedule. And if you go there on a public holiday there will be lots of people and bus is usually not enough.Clothes: Autumn is very cold because of high wind and low temperature. make sure that you check the weather before.A nice camera is recommended! Extra batteries is also recommended!!"
92,So Amazing... ,easy hiking trails that takes about 3 hours at a leisurely pace in between Yutaki and Ryuzudaki waterfalls while transiting through Senjogahara
93,Stunning!,"Such a beautiful place filled with historic temples, shrines, wildlife, and activities.  This is a MUST VISIT if you have not been.  There are train stations in Nikko and buses to get to different points of interest."
94,One of the serious national parks,"We only visited the perimeter of this park, and it was touristy and not very inviting. Others who hiked found it more interesting."
95,The closet National park to Tokyo and the best Autumn view place.,"Amazing park in Nikko. At few minutes walk from the train station. Inside there is also the main attraction of Nikko, absolutely to visit"
96,Beautiful lake,"We spent an afternoon hiking downhill from  the top of Yunoko Lake (bus stop 45). We bought the slightly more expensive two day bus pass to get us that far up. We made it down to Akanuma Junction in about 3 leisurely hours and got back on the busy to Lake Chuzenji for lunch and souvenirs. Paths on hike are planked, dirt, roots, and stone. Relatively easy for the basically fit, but not easy for anyone who has trouble on stairs. Very beautiful park."
97,Was a great place as well,"Get the walking trail map from the Information Centre, and do the Takino'o Path. It is 5km long and I spent 2.5 hrs doing it at a leisurely pace. Beautiful forest in the upper section, and absolutely stunning setting for a cluster of shrines, just above the Shiraito Falls. The other trail on the map, the Kanman Path, I only did the lower section of, but loved the Stone Park of many Buddhas, and the gorgeous Kansan-ga-fuchi Abyss."
98,Historically Significant,"Nikko National Park is easy to reach from Nikko.  The road through the park is winding and steep, but it offers two lanes on the way up, so traffic is not much of an issue.  There are three water falls that are spectacular and accessible; the highest and most popular, Kegon Falls, is not to be missed.  We also saw lots of monkeys, the Japanese macaque."
99,2 day trip outside Tokyo ,"This arrest contains a multitude of shrines, temples and mausoleums that is just incredible. The forrest ist self is pure magic . Go on a foggy day and it is even more beautiful."
100,The magic forrest,"The view was magnificent indeed. Snow flakes pouring down during my visit. The place look magical. Relax and easy walk through-out the shrines and park. To go here from Tokyo, do follow this tips;Japan Rail Pass, you can take the Tohoku Shinkansen (Yamabiko, Max Yamabiko, Tsubasa or Nasuno) from Tokyo Station or Ueno to Utsunomiya (50 minutes or 44 minutes, respectively), then connect to the JR Nikko line (43 minutes from Utsunomiya to Nikko). From Tokyo Station, the whole trip will take from about 1 hour 40 minutes to around 2 hours, depending mostly on the connection in Utsunomiya."
101,Better to get away from the crowds,Went to Nikko Park departed from Asakusa Station Tokyo and the trip was effortless. When you arrive at the railway station cross the road for the shuttle bus that will take you to Nikko Park. Very beautiful park historically significant it has the last 2 Shogun warriors buried there. The park is very beautiful to casually walk around. The temples are all beautifully maintained and the guides and tour guides are very helpful describing everything too you. If you have a spare day this is a superb trip if it's a case of missing out on Tokyo it would be a hard decision but I would stay in Tokyo. JR Pass holders will get the transport included for the trip in with their pass.
102,Perfect day ,"Nikko is heavily marketed as a tourist destination, but I am disappointed to report that it was barely tourist friendly. There are no elevators available at JR Nikko Station, so travelers have carry their luggage up and down the stairs. This is a little troublesome. I know some smaller Japanese train stations do not have elevators, but I am baffled as to why this tourist destination does not have this modern convenience for all the tourists they entice to come and visit. Secondly, the staff I encountered at the JR Nikko Tourist Info Centre was incredibly rude (by Japanese standards). Her name was Ayuha Suzuki. When I requested a map and public transport info, she just gestured to the map on the table, which was not very informative. She also did not have any printed schedules to give to me. It is strange there aren't any printed bus or train schedules at the Tourist Info Centre. I have been to numerous Tourist Info Centres across Japan, and they all have printed public transport information on hand to give out to travelers. I believe that is why they are called Tourist - Information - Centres. I asked if she had more info in English, as I would be going around different parts of Nikko. She proceeded to  huffily walk out from the counter, stormed off to the other side of the room, and pointed roughly to the brochures. ""THERE. ENGLISH."" This is not the Japanese hospitality I have grown accustomed to while traveling in Japan. I am very taken aback to be treated so rudely by staff that are meant to be friendly and helpful. Less well known places, like Lake Tazawa and Naruko Onsen, had infinitely more cheery and helpful staff. In any case, Nikko is most definitely not a tourist friendly destination, and should not be marketed as such. If you do visit, make sure you do all your research beforehand as the staff are unlikely to be of any help."
103,Beautiful even in the rain,"Arrive early in the morning because the bus crowds come at 11 AM.  We spent two nights in a traditional ryokan in Nikko.  We arrived at the park around 8:30 and there were very few people.  We climbed all the way to the first shogun’s memorial.  Buy the combo ticket and then you still have to buy the ticket to the Shogun site.  It is well worth the tickets.  More impressive than anything we saw in Tokyo.  First thing you will see is the large temple housed in a building as it is renovated.  Do see this, very interesting."
104,Amazing trees and shrines and temples,"We took the 4-day Tobu pass at the Asakusa station in Tokyo. Unfortunately we took the Tobu bus on a saturday morning up to Lake Yumato. Leaving Nikko at 8:30 am we got there at 11am, standing all the way on a packed bus, without any security for passengers through dozens of hairpin turns. Everywhere else in Japan passengers have to buckle up, obviously not on Tobu's.The Yumato lake and various falls all the way offered fantastic views with colorful trees. Gorgeous fall foliage. Our recommendation: avoid week endsto visit Nikko National Park  !"
105,Wonderful 'must do' day trip out of Tokyo,"We spent three nights in Nikko enjoying what the National Park had to offer, including many waterfalls, temples and shrines. Lakes Yunoko and Churenji with the surrounding mountains were stunning. There were so many beautiful things to see that two full days were not enough."
106,A great location to see some wonderful shrines and temples,"Took a one day trip there. Got a city pass at Asakusa train station - the staff was very helpful. The world heritage cite itself is so beautiful - I spent the whole day visited all the major shrines. Though it rained abit, the place itself is woderful. This is my third visit to Japan, now I csn truely feel that I have arrived Japan!!!"
107,OK.,"Nikko is a must when in Japan.The number of attractions such as Kegon Falls, Lake Chuzenji, Ryuzu Falls etc make this a MUST VISIT destination.Enjoyed Nikko very much and Highly Recommended."
108,Wonderful place,To put it simply Nikko is a mix of beauty and culture. Nikko can be reached by the Tobu lines on both Rapid and Express services from Asakusa.Tips-Train tickets should be booked well in advance. Various options. -might be worth taking the express service on the return leg however there is a surcharge. Trip is more comfortable.
109,Great place for a stroll and to find hidden historical gems,"We spent two nights in Nikko.We arrived there from Tokyo (JR Pass made everything easy and cheap). In our first day we visited Tosho-gu, Taiyun-byo and the other shrines; in the second day, we spent time at the other sites of the Nikko National park. Lake Chuzen-ji, Mount Nantai, and Kegon Falls were fantastic places to see. We took a very cheap bus from Nikko to these sites. It was late September. The weather was perfect! The colours stunning!The combination of shrines and nature at the Nikko National Park is a reflection of the soul of Japan!"
110,Breathtaking,"When most people think of Nikko, they think of the UNESCO World Heritage Toshogu Shrine, and for good reason - the 500 year old shrine is spectacular. What many visitors don't realize is that the Nikko National Park is fantastic for hiking, camping, trail running, cycling and more. It really is a nature lover's paradise."
111,"Beautiful Scenery, Temples and Waterfalls","This was perhaps the best day tour we booked in the whole trip.  Everything done through Viator. English speaking guide. Breath taking views and feeling one with nature. Make sure you have a camera and are ready to climb 207+ steps. The lunch was delicious as well. Also note that you must find your way back from Tokyo station. It wasn’t difficult, but unlike some tours where they drop you back at your hotel."
112,A must visit while in Nikko,"Absolutely exciting place of great history.I do not understand why all the individual objects at Nikko are also rated separately. For me, the holistic experience is unmatched. Clearly 5 points, do not miss it ! Plan to spend at least a whole day, better two. Do not rush but also have a look at the details. Visit was very relaxing, bringing inner peace."
113,Perfect for daily trip or 2-3 days stay,"The Park has it all: shrines, temples, walking paths among trees, beautiful gardens and statues. You can spend the day exploring temples and shrines, take a pleasant walk in off-the -beaten track area and still have something more to do. Very pleasant place for a daily trip or a longer stay. You won't get bored. Try Kanmangafuchi Abyss  - amazing path of  70 stone statues of Jizo, facing the river. A must-see!"
114,A walk around the park,"This was my favorite place in Japan! We stayed two nights in Nikko but wish we would have spent at least another night or two. We visited the third week of October and the fall colors had already started to change and were predominately yellow and orange. We went to Nikko to go hiking and hike did we ever. We got a ride up to Lake Yunoko (about an hour and a half in bus, less in a car), walked around the lake then made our way down hill and finished at Ryuzu Falls about 5 hours and about 6 miles (9.6 km) later. I recommend you stop at an information center to get a complimentary good map of the hiking area as well as the bus schedule to get back to Nikko. Do bring water, snacks, sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses and a light jacket. In order to refuel your body, there are a couple snack bars with bowls of noodles, ice cream, etc. in the area. What’s great for travelers is that the J Pass is valid on the bus that goes to and from the city of Nikko and the National Park.  One of our favorite trails was Sengo-ga-hara as we were almost the only ones on the trail and you walk along a creek and see some picturesque bridges. It was an amazing day and a perfect destination for fall hiking and to get out of the hustle and bustle of more touristy areas of Japan. After our time in Nikko we took the train to Matsumoto and the ride was spectacular (leave Nikko before sunset) – going through the hillsides and rural Japan."
115,Natural Setting for Shrine and Temple Complex,"Spent 7 hours in the Nikko national park. It was a very rainy day, so luckily there weren't so many tourists there. Didn't use the day pass, I walked all the distances. I would recommend you to walk and enjoy the park. All these different shrines and temples are unique. One of the best days in Japan so far."
116,its winter so its fun,"It was really nice here and I liked the environment. Despite the lack of english signs and maps it was a great place to go to, and it was quite an adventure to walk around with my friend."
117,A must place to visit in Japan,"I am staying in Tokyo on business, had a day off and headed for Nikko.I had a guidebook for Japan with some about Nikko but not a lot, I don't speak Japanese.Anyway it is October 25 and I got a late start from my hotel near Shinjuku, got lost in Asakusa since the arrival train station isn't connected to the Tobu line.  Anyway, finally got on way to Nikko and arrived about 2pm.  The shrines stop admitting at 4pm and close at 5pm, so I knew I could see a couple of them without rushing, grab dinner and get back to Tokyo at a decent hour.That was the plan.The shuttle bus that went to the shrines was out of service due to ""traffic jam"" and they put me on another bus with vague instructions about where to get off to get close to where I wanted to go (make sure you get a detailed map of Nikko).  I ended up heading into the hills towards the lake (I forget name) and once headed that way at least 4 things were put into motion: there was no way i was going to see the shrines, the bus took over 2 hours in a traffic jam heading up the hairpin turns i think a total of 15km!!! and it was pitch black on arrival, my tourpass didn't cover the ride to the lake so i had to shell out another $20 or so, and the train back to Tokyo stopped at every milk station and it took me 4 hours to get from Nikko to Shinjuku.  Not fun.Nikko looked interesting and I would like to go back someday, but combo of my poor planning, time available, not knowing it would be crammed with people, and generally unintelligible signage, etc. made it a day I will never get back in my life.  Plan to stay overnight and/or day tour from Tokyo by leaving uber-early like 7am or so from Asakusa"
118,Great day trip from Tokyo,"We arrived during the autumn fall and the trees were so colorful and beautiful. There are many amazing waterfalls, lakes, trees.. Don't miss it."
119,The soul of Japan!,"Perhaps like most overseas visitors we had been drawn to visit Nikko because of the temples and shrines, but we decided also to visit the National Park. What a discovery: it gets little emphasis in the guidebooks. It is obviously well known and loved by Japanese visitors, so maybe they deliberately keep it to themselves. Confusingly, some references apply the National Park term to include the temple area though the park proper and the town/temples are an hour or so apart. It was a convenient bus ride, though we went to the first stop, the JR Station, to ensure a seat, and we should have got a day pass to ease hopping on and off the bus at different places. The bus rises on a zig-zag through the most astonishing landscape: mountains and valleys and changing treescapes and vegetation and past lakes and waterfalls and hiking trails. A priority if we visit Japan again to do some of those walks."
120,Little Disappointing Due To The Renovations,"Hiked around Lake Chuzenji.  Area is kind of touristy, but gets much prettier as you walk away from town.  Best part was the boat ride, lake surrounded by mountains is beautiful on a sunny day, as is watching the clouds enshroud the mountains.  Stopped at charming tea house by the lake on the way back."
121,Stunning day trip from Tokyo!,"If you are looking to get out of town, the walk around the lakes / river is excellent.  We got one of the 'free' bus passes for 2 days.  If you catch it to stop 45 or 46 (the end of the ride), you can then walk gradually downhill around the lakes, with a couple of waterfalls along the way.  We caught the bus from stop 34 on the way down as the walkway from there down is largely beside the road and not as scenic.  Get off and on at stop 26 if you want to see Kegon Falls (much more touristy).  You can do as much walking as you want to.  We ended up doing 28,000 steps.Positives- Well maintained walkway - a lot of it on built up wooden walkways- Mostly downhill- Beautiful scenery and very nice walking down next to the river- Very friendly fellow walkers!  Many with little bells to keep the bears away!!- Option to get off / on the bus at key points - The switch-back road on the bus ride back down is amazing!Not so great- once you get to stop 34 it isn't as scenic around the shores of Lake Chuzenji- Kegon Falls (stop 26) are right in a small village and far more touristy, with people just driving to have a look at them"
122,"Must visit, I repeat! :)",We enjoyed visiting.  We walked up several flights of stairs to visit a shrine at the top of the hill and enjoyed it.
123,A great day out,My wife and I visited this place as part of our 2 weeks holiday in Japan. It was very crowded as it is a very popular tourist attraction and Japan is currently experiencing a tourism boom. They should consider raising the entry prices to try to reduce the number of visitors and raise more income.
124,Spend the day taking in the beauty,"Beautiful park with lots of things to do and see and due to the expanse of the park, a great place for a long walk and on one side a river."
125,Worth it with a word of caution,"Hiring a bus to visit Nikko665772912We traveled in a group of 14, and came to Japan one day before our guided tour of Japan were to start. We decided to visit Nikko and needed a bus which would pick us up with all our suitcases at the airport and by the end of the day bring us to our Tokyo hotel. I stumbled upon an excellent company Bus Hire. The lady I communicated with, Natsumi, was extremely cordial, attentive to all our needs, and proactive. She not only arranged a bus suitable for our needs, but provided a tour guide, and even suggested what we should eat and where to avoid the crowds. She inquired if we had any food requirements and suggested what we should see at Nikko in the limited time we had (and this is a bus rental office!). After our trip, which went without a glitch, and on-time, she inquired whether everything was to our liking. We are very pleased with the services of this company. And her English was perfect (which is a rarity in Japan, even at large hotels).  So, come to Japan and hire a bus to see places of your choosing.  It is easy and not much more expensive than going places using public transportation."
126,Neat place to spend an afternoon,Hiking along the Kinugawa River is a great experience for young and old.  The trails are well maintained and well marked.  They offer many beautiful views.  A good starting point is at Ryuokyo.
127,Kegon Falls and Lake Chuzenji area,This place is very beautiful with breathtaking views. There are a lot of temples. A magical land full of history and culture. Do not miss this place when visiting Japan.
128,Go for a long hike and enjoy! Start at Lake Yunoko and make your way downhill,"You can get excellent maps of the local walking trails from the tourist office. There is very good bus coverage to take you to the trails. Spectacular waterfalls, and beautiful mountains. Make sure to wear long trousers as we got bitten by insects."
129,Really love Nikko,"We took the package deal available at the railway station which included train tickets, entrance to the park and the wonderland. It’s well worth doing that as it’s valid for two days which you will need at the park will take one and the wonderland the other. Beautiful temples and nature and excellent activities. Great way to experiment an alternative part just outside Tokyo"
130,Mt.Nyoho,Did the whole thing from bridge to temple to shrine and the history walk. The walk is the best part. Long and tiring navigating through the stone paths but absolutely worth it . Do cater at least a day for this and you need to rush a little as its a really long walk.
131,Beautiful park - marred only by ten million screaming school children!,"Beautiful, clean, well maintained place.  The temples are awesome.  It takes a lot of work and love to keep this place in this wonderful shape.Spend the whole day there if you could"
132,Hire a car to get more out of this extensive national park,"Falls, trees, woods, lake, cable cabin, onsen, temples, fresh air and clouds... It is picture like place to hang around"
133,Hiking paradise,the area was pleasant itself but as we went with a tour bus there wasn't much to be seen but another temple or shrine .. Too crowded .. Too unmanageable .. Very hard if you're with a group .. I liked mountain Fuji and its surroundings much better ..
134,Great relaxing place,"We bought the Nikko pass the one that its 2000 yen (tobu line, no express)It was a wonderful one day trip.A lot to walk. A very quiet place and beatiful."
135,Perfect combination of antient temples and serene nature,One of Japan's most beautiful nature sceneries. Don't rush it and take your time to take in all the beautiful places that surround Nikko and the lake. Best in an open car or better even if you rent a motorbike. Winter can be beautiful but I prefer Autumn.
136,Walk down to this beautiful waterfall,Nikko is one of the nicest places I've ever been.  It was quite a long train ride from Tokyo city centre but totally worth it.So many photo opportunities and it's not overcrowded.I'm glad I decided to visit Nikko instead of spending a 2nd day at Disney!My favourite part of Nikko was seeing the waterfall (Kegon Falls) as far as I remember.There is no set fee for Nikko but you will find yourself spending a few 100 YEN every temple you arrive at which is understandable.  In total the trip there maybe cost 5000
137,Worth the visit,"We planned on spending 2 days in Nikko and decided to travel there by Tobu train.  Went to the Asakusa station and spoke with the sales clerks.  The 2-day pass is not based on 48 hours.  For example our plan is to depart by 9am on the 19, and depart by 9am on the 21.  The sales clerk said this is considered 3 days!!  So then the 2-day pass for 2,670 yen does not include round trip.She then pushed us to buy the 4-day pass for 4,520 yen.  The 2-day Pass and the 4-day Pass is only good for travel on the Rapid and local trains which are slow and old and do not have as many  departures as the modern fast Limited Express trains which costs an additional 2,240 yen one way and 4,480 round trip.  These Passes do include bus rides in Nikko.We ended up just paying 4,160 yen for round-trip without bus rides included and since we do not plan on going to see Lake Chizunji (since we are from Canada and have seen many lakes)  I am sure we have saved a chunk of money."
138,A must,Be sure to walk around the lake and enjoy the scenery.  Take time to walk to the waterfall.  Don't miss the ice cream stand.  Yummy!
139,The best of the best in Japanese History and Architecture,"ENGLISH: I think Nikko deserves more than one day. I visited on a sunday: lots of visitors everywhere, and it was impossible to do all we wanted. The views from the ropeway are beautiful. The boat trip on the lake too,  the leaves were starting to get red...  We saw one of the waterfalls (Kegon), but missed the others, and the onsen. Time was not enough. And besides there is the temple and shrine complex, World Heritage.  I recommend the two or four days ticket, that incluses the train from Tokio.SPANISH|Nikko merece más de un día. Yo lo visité un domingo, lleno de gente, y fue imposible hacer todo lo que queríamos. La vista subiendo el cablecarril es hermosa. El paseo en bote en el lago también. Las hojas de los árboles poniendose rojas... un espectáculo. Vimos la catarata de Kegon, pero nos perdimos la otra, y el onsen... No alcanzó el tiempo. Ademas está el complejo de templos, patrimonio de la humanidad. Recomiendo el ticket de dos o cuatro días que incluye el tren desde Tokio."
140,Worth the journey from Tokyo,"When you get far from the street where you cannot hear the noise of the cars, you feel in a different world... you can visit severals famous shrines all at walking distance, although, unfortunately, some of them are closed because under restoration (but they didn't change the ticket prices...)."
141,Beautiful mountains,"A friend and I stayed in Nikko and then took the bus to Nikko national park.. we thought we had it sorted and would be able to get off the bus at one point and start our walk straight away.. sadly we were wrong, we ended up at the bottom of a closed ropeway and stuck on the roadside till someone kindly picked us up. Once we made it to the lake we were very happy though as it is a beautiful area. We did manage to wind up on a fairly isolated walking track (which we loved) although we were the only ones without bear bells! Would definitely recommend coming here for any foreign tourists who want to escape other foreigners!!!"
142,Worth a visit,"Very good bus service to all attractions. Wide range of shops and restaurants, though not all open in evening off season.However it was nice to be there wthout many people about, and weather fine."
143,Worth a quick visit,From stunning natural landscapes to Unesco World heritage sites this area is an amazing area of Japan. It was hugely important at various junctures of the Shogunates and the concurrence of Buddhism and Shintoism makes it quite unique to Japan. We were lucky enough to visit during early autumn and although the colours were not at their peak there was a clear indication of what was to come and the countryside was simply extraordinary. We were lucky enough to have some friends come up and taxi us around but the public transport looked quite satisfactory to explore the area.Whether you have to make a day trip from Tokyo or are like us about to head up further into Tohoku this area will not disappoint.
144,Beautiful Snow at Nikko,"While Nikko is a must in Japan, be aware that some of the shrines are undergoing renovations. While it isn't expensive to enter you don't get to see much and may lose valuable time if you're there for the day."
145,Nice for an overnight stay,"It rained the whole time that we were in the park but we had umbrellas and enjoyed every minute of it! And I think it meant that there were less people around, however be careful because it can be slippery in places. Wear good shoes! Go to Takinoo shrine, it's free and beautiful!"
146,Value for money Nikko Natural Park Tour (Morning Tour)!,"Went there for a day w/ my hubby's best friend as our tour guide. Was very enjoyable, friend was driving the car for us and while ascending to the top of the mountain, you can watch the monkey's playing around the highway. We had a lunch near the lake, and the most we enjoyed was the onsen or the Japanese hot spring spa. Couples like us could enjoy together the hot spring although most in Japan women and men are always separated but because our friend can speak Nihonngo he requested the receptionist for us to be together w/ our baby. We went to a great big falls near the ledge of the mountain, oh that was so amazing view although we get a little bit wet. We will definitely want to come back and visit Japan again, there are so many amazing places out there :))"
147,Breathtaking and easy access from Tokyo,"I went Nikko on October., and I chose the national zone bus because my family and I wanna see red leaves. Lucky, we have seen them! It's very beautiful~ I recommend that if you go to there on October, 1-15, I think you should visit this zone and stop at Ryuzu Waterfall which is the north of Tokyo. Cetainly, it's too cold about 5 degree. But we can stand because it's really pretty!"
148,Nikko National Park,The Nikko National Park is a vast land covering the UNESCO World Heritage Toshogu-temple. It’s a good 1 day trip from Tokyo visiting the lovely temples and the waterfalls. Truly a majestic place to appreciate nature and Japanese History.
149,beautiful but...,"The park is very beautiful, especially in winter, but the problem with all the shrines and temples is that there is 0(!) information in English. I don't understand why they don't just put up some English description too, at least for the way through the park. Without a map you are lost."
150,Beauty and Culture.,"I went to wander around the National Park on my own for a day and it was wonderful... the amount of details, coulours, shapes in the shirnes and everthing around. The vegetation was magestic so green and dense. The little restaurants around were very good and had excellent Noodles (Ramen).It is located 100km away from tokyo and you can get there by a very fast and lovely train ride."
151,Sightsee trip during business,"Very nice park area. In April still pretty bare and many trails were closed due to snow. Still managed Senjo go hara. Many shops still closed or closing early. Be careful of the bus prices- they are steep. Consider the Tobu railpass combo ticket. I didn't, but can now see the savings. Take your own picnic if you want to be flexible."
152,some areas are lovely but not necessarily worth the travel or expense,"I had come to Nikko for the first time years ago as a university student, I was amazed at the rich amount of history there was. Not just in Toshogu Shrine but the area surrounding the hill the shrine sat on. As s student studying Japanese in the US at the time it was the first place I really got to connect with the materials I was learning. I wanted to come back and enjoy another trip to Nikko and came with some friends  it was easy to do since I was living in Tochigi at the time. We had an amazing time just relaxing in the hot springs in the area and chilling in the area near our hotel which was also near Toshogu Shrine. I've now since moved to Tokyo and it's still an easy trip to go up and come back from. Highly recommended. 6-time visitor."
153,The real deal for Japanese history,We were here end of May and it was not too busy. A good network of busses helps to get around and do several hikes without having an own car. Beautiful area!
154,Massive Cedar trees,"We enjoyed viewing the falls then looking through some of the local vendor stands and shops where we bought some souvenirs and a ""soft cream"" (soft-serve ice cream).  We then strolled down to Lake Chuzenji and watched some of the ""Swan"" boats paddling around and the small cruise boat departing.  We strolled the shores, then returned to the bus stop and caught the bus down the mountain and into town.  We'd been told there was a great hiking course further up the bus line, but we did not have the time or energy to do that this trip.  We decided to save it for next time."
155,fall in Nikko,"Nikko National Park is a large park covering huge area of forests, streams and waterfalls.  The region will be very attractive during autumn months when the tree leaves change colors.  We walked along the tracks inside the park for half a day from Senjogahara Moor down to Kegon Fall by early Nov and felt that it was really enjoyable."
156,nice to see...,"My review of Nikko Toshogu Shrine is the same so here goes...It's a place sooo beautiful you need to see to believe it! :) There are multiple shrines and complexes in the heritage site encapsulated within the forest. We walked almost 5 hours plus, plenty of things to see and very relaxing. There are a few vending machines and small stalls selling drinks and snacks scattered in the area, we managed to find them easily thanks to the area map! I'd definitely visit here again, love it"
157,For solo travelers,We wandered around here for two of the days we stayed in Nikko. There is lots too see and most of the temples require an entry fee.
158,Nightmarish bus ride to Lake Chuzenji,"This is by far one of my favorite places I visited while living in Japan.  I just wish I hadn't waited so long to go.  I bet it is so beautiful in spring and fall!  It was nice to get out of the big cities Japan is known for.  So much scenery to take in.  I got a 2 day pass from the Nikko train station to hope on and off a bus so that I could see as much as possible!!!  I thin kit was 2000 yen and well worth it!  If you get the chance to go, do it!"
159,A wonderful discovery,We had a car.  Spent the morning at the shrines then drove to the various lakes and did some walking.  Amazing trails and amazing scenery. All the waterfalls are gorgeous. Walking the trails is also very cool in the summer heat. Next time would travel to the lakes by bus and walk back.
160,Perfect in fall,"Beautiful are with several Shrines. Access from Tokyo is easy, if you take the limited express tobu line from asakusa - worth the higher price. When there easy bus access to the world heritage park. Most temples/shrines and the bridge are pay-to-see, but the outside is gorgeous. Lots of stairs as it is set in a mountainside, but well worth the view and fresh air."
161,fantastic fall foliage,"Sitting in our Tokyo hotel room and reading reviews on this area it was with some trepidation that we decided to spend our last full day in Japan taking the shinkansen and local train to Nikko to view the park and temples.A short tourist bus ride from Nikko station got us to the main temple area and we set off up the hill, on the way passing some of the most magnificent temples and shrines we were to see on our entire journey through Japan.  Take time to admire the ornate carvings and craftsmanship which are stunningEven though some of the structures were undergoing renovation it was hard not to be impressed by the ancient buildings and statues that dot the area in between the large area of forests.Be prepared for steps, steps and more steps but the effort in reaching the top of the hill and the upper most temple is worth it.As always there were crowds but because the area is so large this wasn't really a problem.This was a highlight of our trip and well worth the effort."
162,Great hiking,I went in November as the final stop on my trip and it was freezing cold (noticeably colder than anywhere else I’d been in Japan). Absolutely lovely though.Easy transport links to get there (though it can get quite busy) and you can walk up or get the bus. There are a lot of tourist groups and many of the shrines etc were being refurbished when I was there (in huge tent like structures).Only negative was the cost of l each shrine which adds up to a fair amount if you want to see as much as possible.
163,Stunning scenery,This was also a place worth visiting it was great cost over 1000 yen to get in but I think you could see shrine and walk up to shoguns grave was great
164,Unfinished business,"This place will take a whole day roaming around. Very nice taken care.  If you do not have strong legs, it is advisable to bring a walking stick and wear comfy clothing.  There will be long walks, hiking etc. We thoroughly enjoyed it"
165,"Add this to your bucket list, a must experience","Final resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Very beautiful place with several shrines, temples and imperial gardens. It was also nice to hike near Chuzenji lake."
166,Carefully plan your Tobu train trip to Nikko,Check in advance the weather.  Be prepared to drive in very narrow roads.  A good road map is a must.  The GPS provided by rent a car companies is in Japanese and it's difficult to understand.
167,Worth going once,"UNESCO awarded this shrine complex Historic status in 1999.  This is by far the most intricate and beautiful of all the shrine complexes in Japan. Even though this is a sacred areas, vendor stations fill the area with talismans, charms, and other icons--in a very tasteful way."
168,A jump into the past,"I visited Nikko in the mid 1980's, my guide was a cab driver, cost me about $90 for the day at that time.  I found the park to be awe inspiring, very strong spiritual presence, a wonderful peace.  If I ever have the opportunity to return to Japan I will definitely go back to Nikko"
169,"Beautiful scenery, nice for a hike",It is a very large park located on the edge of the town.  Inside the park are the most important temples of the city.  It is a must visit while in Nikko.  Beautiful forest and amazing walks enjoying the beautiful landscapes and temples architectures.  Entrance is free.
170,Breathing space !,"Besides several waterfalls this place has a number of very well layout hiking trails. If you don't want to walk all the way, there's the bus available to pick you up."
171,Impressive forest and water views,"We went to Nikko without hearing much about it beforehand and it was one of our best days in Japan. The train takes you right there and then after that you can either bus through the park or walk it. We chose to hike and it was a great choice. The weather was cool, the leaves were changing and thus, there were beautiful views everywhere. There are many things to see and do and it is not expensive at all to enter any of the sites. You can get off the beaten path and find some nice quiet time strolling in an old growth forest or stay on the path and visit historic temples and shrines or tour the summer Imperial palace.  All of it was pretty cool. I wouldn't rush through it; make sure you have time to enjoy all of Nikko."
172,great hikes,"Would have stayed longer than the 2 days I'v been.Went bec.of Autumn Nikko Festival, was far from disappointed. Then, discovered the park, some local art shops, and the nice local people, with musical accent. Very pleasant and helpful.To travel here is time-consuming, complicated transportation. Once you get there, if you enjoy nature and genuine people, it is worthwhile to stay at least 2 days. I could stay 4 days, because of very pleasant walks in very well maintained pedestrian roads by lake side or forest. At least two splendid waterfalls. Excellent hiking possible. The region is quite an extensive territory in the mountain, with numerous small villages higher than the main Nikko village, higher up in the mountain. My hotel was 45 minutes higher than Nikko, by car. My guide and I really enjoyed the walks. To take some breaks, we repeatedly stopped at onsen hostels (hotsprings hotels) that are numerous along the roads. We raved on the fabulous shops each of them had, each with different products. Some local original products, not found elsewhere in Japan. My guide herself bought gifts for her people in Tokyo, bec. what she was finding here was unique.Take a look at the pictures on this site of Trip Advisor.As a Canadian, if told of the natural bounty of Nikko, before I visited it, I still would've thought: ''yes, but you are used to all this, as a Canadian''.It turned out that I thouroughly enjoyed it, and would have stayed longer. Brought a sense of peace, harmony.The musical accent of the locals: I hope I will never forget. And they were very nice.Enjoyed my stay at Okunikko onsen (see my profile)."
173,Worth the effort.  A highlight.,"I've gone to Nikko only in the fall - the most popular time. However, I could see it being a great summer spot, too. The hikes are gorgeous and the waterfalls even more spectacular. I highly recommend taking a car as some of the foliage viewing roads are best enjoyed from a relaxing car and not a packed public bus. Nikko is also known for yuba dishes. Yuba is the nutritious and delicious tofu skin. We had some great yuba dishes!!!"
174,Best of the Best Historical Site,A sea of greens enclose amazing shrines and temples. The cedars are equally old as the buildings and a tribute to nature. Both complement each other. It is well worth spending a day here and walking is easy except to the tomb of the shogun. The colours in June are various greens and it must be even more spectacular in Autumn. Nikko is a must place to visit.
175,"Stunning landscape, but make sure you plan!","Most of the main sites are currently undergoing renovation. The park itself is made up of tons of small shrines, each of which you have to pay for. Plan ahead and see if the places you want to see are viable or not."
176,Great day trip!,We spent 3 days in Nikko and that was not enough. Everywhere we went at Okunikko we saw many groups (mostly senior citizens) trekking the trials. There are many here and one can spend days doing them all. Will be back to come do them. Tracks are well mapped out and safe for visitors.
177,One of Japan's most beautiful nature sceneries,We accidentally ended up walking through the park searching for a restaurant. We popped out at the Shinkyo bridge which was a pleasant surprise. We also found food a block away at a wonderful ramen house. The park itself is small and unassuming. Beautiful foliage and very well maintained.
178,Another winner,"We visited Nikko in early October 2014 on a day trip from Tokyo, just as the leaves were starting to turn, and were completely blown away by the stunning beauty of the place.The first thing to say is don't necessarily trust TripAdvisor's map reference for Taiyuinbyo temple. Quite by chance (and in ignorance of the area) I used the address and map ref in TA in our satnav and we found ourselves at the City Hall in Imaichi about 10km from the world heritage site.The second thing is that there is an Information Centre on the main street  of Nikko on the 'romantic highway' that is a useful place to start (and park). They have some English language materials and maps and will give recommendations on places to eat.Thirdly I strongly recommend the historic trail that we picked up from near the Toshogu Art museum, and which heads up to the Takino'o shrine then loops back to where Taiyuinbyo (really) is. Lots of points of interest and beauty on the cobblestone road. Probably 5km in total, it kept the various elements of our party: a six year old; teenagers; and ourselves, engaged for a couple of hours. For some reason, perhaps because of an approaching typhoon, it seemed very quiet in Nikko on the day we went.Nikko is manageable as a day trip from Tokyo by car. We found it was about a two hour drive one way in light traffic and cost about ¥5000 each way in tolls. For six of us, it made it a pretty economical day. Next time we go we'll stay overnight, though.We loved Nikko, have unfinished business there and will definitely be back to do some more walking. Strongly recommended."
179,Nice National Park. Come early,"From the interior of  NIkko Toshogu shrine, Gyojya-do, you can reach the top of Mt.Nyoho by 6 to 7 hours hiking  without a special climbing skill. The foot of this mountain is so wide that  first 2 to 3 hours  walk is gentle though  very hard steep follows after that. You can enjoy amazing panoramic mountains views  including  Mt.Fuji, Japan Alps etc. from mountain top 2,465m height. Hikers are  not usual and sometimes weather changes unexpectedly here so you better to contact  Nikko Yumoto Visitor center before you try.  Forest of larch and silver birch on the  field of  bamboo glass spread endlessly.You can feel and enjoy really beautiful Japanese autumn here.."
180,Mountain Park World Heritage Site,"The main point with temples was nice, but that's all. The lake and the falls did not impress me whatsoever. Of course, I must confess that I am not so keen on Buddhism or Shintoism and their temples. All this dragon obsession leaves me aloof."
181,Amazing nature!,This is quite a big area to cover and you need at least 2 days to do it justice. Best to make use of local buses to move around and hike in some areas. We spent less than a day and only some some nearby places. Missed the falls. Most temples require an entry fee. Autumn here has some beautiful foliage.
182,April a bit too early,"Too overcrowded and too many local Japanese day tourists. Bus connection does not help because of too many private cars. MUST avoid on weekends. Was there during the first October 17' weekend. This is kind of the beginning of the autumn (leaf color change) here. This means that during any weekend it will be packed by local Japanese day tourists. There is a bus going from the Nikko train stations up to the hiking area. You can buy the 'Nikko pass' for 3000¥ for two consecutive days or decide to take single rides on the bus for very expensive prices (one time up and one time down is 3200¥, so it makes sense). On the weekend the roads are so packed with private cars that a 1:20 hour ride on a weekday took 3:30 hours on a Sunday. So try by any means to not spend a weekend here!They ought to improve the bus connections on the weekends during the high season and let less private cars go up by charging more for the parking lots up there and less for the overpriced bus pass (3000¥!!!!). There were passengers who had to stand up the whole 3 hour bus ride up to the last stop (yomoto-onsen). It's a pitty but this made Nikko a negative memory for me. Would not recommend it on a weekend."
183,Amazing!,"This impressive park houses some of the most beautiful temples and buildings in Japan, including the mausoleum of the Tokugawa Iyasu Shogun and his grandson Ayamitsu and the Potarasan Temple, dating back to 767. UNESCO awarded the National Park of Nico the title of World Heritage Site in 1999, thanks to the city's temples. The Nikko city boasts beautiful mountains, among them the most beautiful waterfalls and waterfalls in Japan, which are packed with monkeys, so it is recommended to keep all your valuables in your bags so that the monkeys will not steal them. , Because they tend to snatch such things from people 's hands The Nikko National Park is about 125 kilometers north of Tokyo, and you can get to Niko by Tobu or Japan Railways, and if you purchased the JR Pass, It is more worthwhile to take the Japan Railways train, although it requires a train exchange at Utsunomiya Station, which takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes to Japan Railways, and Nikko's famous temples are about 2 km from Nikko train stations. If the weather is pleasant and you have power, you can reach the temples on foot by walking 30-40 minutes along Nico's main street. Alternatively, you can use the bus, which departs from the train station to the temples. The bus ride is about 10 minutes long and it is more worthwhile to purchase a round trip ticket if you intend to return by bus on the same day."
184,Wonderful place to see fall foliage,i live close by so I have taken many trips there in the last 5 years.  I went there the first time 33 years ago and I miss all the crafts people that are no longer there.  Age and price has killed the craft.  They used to make beautiful wood products from the local trees/Still this is a must see and a World Heritage Site
185,Accidental stroll through a pretty park.,"I guess I was one of the few who wasn't too crazy about Nikko National Park.  Let me first go over the pros:1.  I liked how there were shops, restaurants, and coffee houses in Nikko.  None of them were too expensive--considering it's a tourist town!  (Some of them could've used a face lift though.  Not as quaint as some reviewers mentioned.)  It was nice to see there weren't any chains, such as McDonald's.  Starbucks would've been nice though.2.  The Shinkiyu bridge was beautiful!  Made a terrific photo.3.  Toshogu Shrine was definitely worth it.  A must see!4.  Kegon Falls was nice and easily accessible from Lake Chuzenji.Cons:1.  It cost $23 USD (one way) to take the bus from Lake Chuzenji to the train station!  I thought that was highway robbery.2.  There were two classes of Tobu train service from Tokyo to Nikko.  Even though I got the lower class ticket, there still should've been A/C in the train.  I felt the ducts and there was no air coming out of them.  Since we couldn't open the windows, it felt like a sauna.  Plus, it took almost 3 hours to go from Nikko National Park to Asakusa train station in Tokyo.  (It was almost 1/2 hour late.  So much for the Japanese being efficient.  I guess they are if you're willing to pay for it!)3.  Save your money and skip Tamazawa Imperial Villa Park unless you like to see rooms with no furniture in them!  To me, they all looked the same because of it. That was a waste of time and money.4.  I thought Lake Chuzenji could've looked nicer.  Unlike some other waterfront locations, there weren't any parks or anything where you can have a picnic or something.  However, there were plenty of boat rentals.Overall, Nikko National park was OK but I doubt I'll go back.  To me, it was not like Yosemite, Grand Tetons or a number of other American national parks."
186,"Nikko temple and park amazing, don't miss it.","Sorry for my belated review! I was urged by my friend to share my review even though it was long after the rightful review period since we visited in late March 2014 (it was way past the review period that's why I could not choose the correct period and I visited with my parent but no option for ""family only"" hence I chose “family (teen)”). After a few days in Tokyo, we took train for a day trip out of Tokyo to Nikko, a small town two hours north of Tokyo in Tochigi Prefecture. It is the entrance to Nikko National Park, most famous for the UNESCO World Heritage Toshogu Shrine, Japan's most lavishly decorated shrine and home to the mausoleum of the Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate. Due to our tight schedule, we did not join any whole day tour instead we joined a morning tour via Japanican which covered a few places of interest in the Nikko Natural Park. We did enjoy the tour very much as we managed to cover many places within a short period of time which would be impossible if we were to travel on our own. Also we did not expect to see several centimeters of snow at the Senjogahara Marshlands and Ryuzu Waterfall and were really excited to take a short stroll around the areas. For a short half day trip, this tour was well worth the money and I would recommend it to everyone with a tight schedule and/or budget.  The journey includes:i) Pick-up from the Tobu Nikko Station (Note: Pick-up at 9:20am, the bus will be waiting at Kankokyokai-mae, bus station in less than a minute on foot from Tobu Nikko Station. On the right hand side of a row of shop when you come out from the Tobu Nikko Station. If you plan to stay overnight in Nikko and join the tour only the following morning, you may board the vehicle at Ryokan near Toshugu).ii) Iroha-zaka. It is a pair of winding roads leading up to Oku Nikko, with many sharp turns. The road was named after the Japanese syllables, where “Iroha” are the first 3 of 48 syllables of the formerly used Japanese alphabet (which is now known as “aiueo”) and “zaka” means “slope”)(Note: Drive-by without stopover). iii) Senjogahara Marshlands located at an altitude of 1,400m above sea level, at the upper end of Iroha-zaka road which offers a superb view of Kegon Falls. It covers the plateau between Lake Chuzenji and Yumoto Onsen. It is particularly beautiful during the autumn leaf season in October when the grasses of the marshland turn into reddish yellow and the larch trees turn into shiny gold (Note: The tour will only visit during the winter, where you can stroll through the picturesque marshland, typically covered by several centimeters of snow between December and March, during which the hiking trails may not be passable but visitors can see a different side of the marshland by walking along the hiking trails on snowshoes).iv) Ryuzu Waterfall means “dragon head waterfall” in Japanese which named after the shape of the falls which resembles the head of a dragon. It is located in the middle of Yukawa River, shortly before it flows into Lake Chuzenji. It is flanked by many trees which turn yellow and red during the autumn leaf season and is usually best visit in early October (Note: Tour may subject to change depending on the traffic. Will not visit for almost a month in early October to early November due to heavy traffic). v) Lake Chuzenji, is a scenic lake in the mountains above the town of Nikko. It is located at the foot of Mount Nankai, Nikko’s sacred volcano, whose eruption blocked the valley below, thereby creating Lake Chuzenji about 20,000 years ago. During summer, the surface of the lake lies at 1,269m above sea level, which is the highest in Japan. The lakeside area gained recognition after diplomats from Western nations who were attracted by the beautiful landscape built their villas in the Meiji era (Note: Not sure whether it is the same during other season, we visited during late March and the bus stopped at Chuzenji Temple which stands on the eastern bank of Lake Chuzenji for half an hour for visit. You may pay ¥500 to visit the Tachiki Kannon. If not, you may skip by taking photo at the area opposite the temple facing Lake Chuzenji).vi) Hangetsu-toge Observation Deck is an observation deck with great views onto Lake Chuzenji and Mount Nankai and is a popular autumn leaf viewing spot which offers superb view from mid October to early November each year (Note: Will only visit if the traffic to Ryuzu Fall is congested). vii) Tachiki Kannon, the Buddhist Goddess of Merch, which the statue is carved out of a tree tree. The Juichimen Senju Kannon Bosatsu statue - Kannon with 11 faces and 1,000 arms, carved out of a tree which is still rooted into the ground today.viii) Kegon Waterfall, features a dynamic 97m drop and is the most famous of Nikko’s many waterfalls which ranked as one of Japan’s 3 most beautiful falls. (Note: You may visit from a free observation platform which is easily accessible on foot, but for a up-close visit via elevator down an additional fee @¥550 is applicable. This waterfall is popular during autumn and winter). ix) Hoto Falls & Hannya Falls (Note: Drive by without stopover. These waterfalls can be viewed from the bus windows when descending the Iroha-zaka Road) x) Tour ends at Ryokan nearby Toshugu or Tobu-Nikko Station.Important information:1) We joined the morning tour (2014: ¥2,900; 2015: ¥3,200) so that we could spend more times at Toshugu areas (shrines only open till a specific time, if you join the evening tour, you have to either come a day early or arrive at Nikko early in the morning, cover the Toshugu complex then only join the tour. If you plan for a day trip, you will have to ensure you return to Tobu Nikko Station before 5:30pm to be in time to catch the trains back to Asakusa). 2) No guide or attendant will accompany the tour, just a driver who will make announcement in Japanese will be present on the day as people who join the tour are mostly Japanese. However, a flyer in English with simple introduction of each place of interest will be distributed to foreign visitors and the driver will advise you the time you can spend at each place of interest in English. 3) Several shrines of many buildings are being renovated in stages from 2007 to 2019, including the renowned Yomeimon Gate, which is currently being renovated (from 2013 onwards and may be up to 2019) and covered up by scaffolding. Despite that, the main buildings and its grounds still worthy of visit. 4) Winter jacket is a must and you may consider wearing a hiking boots instead of sport shoes (if you don’t plan to bring your snowshoes for just a 30 minute walk like us) if you are visiting from December to March because the snow was several centimeters high when we visited. My recommendations:	1) We bought a 2-Day Nikko Pass via Tobu Railway (2014: ¥2,600; 2015: ¥2,670) which includes round trip from Tokyo-Asakusa via rapid/ section rapid train, unlimited travel on buses in central Nikko and on non-express Tobu trains between Nikko, Shimo-Imaichi and Shin-Fujiwara which is valid on 2 consecutive days.2) You may request the driver to drop you at the Toshugu Shrine towards the end and explore the complex on your own.3) If you prefer a more in depth introduction of some of the places of interest, you may join the day trip departs from Tokyo at about 4-5 times the cost. Pros: i) Entrance fee to Toshugu areas and lunch may be inclusive; ii) Save you the hassle to collect the train ticket from Tobu Asakusa Station (ticket must be collected at least the day before you travel, especially if you are taking the first train out to Nikko, the office only opened at 7:45am). Cons: i) You will not be able to cover as many places as the morning/ evening tour because day trip begins and ends in Tokyo, you will have less time to spend in Nikko due to the traveling time from Tokyo to Nikko and Nikko to Tokyo; ii) More costly (less costly if you join morning/ evening tour then explore the Toshugu area at your own leisure, ¥3,200 for tour + ¥2,670 for 2-day pass + ¥1,300 entrance to all shrines in Toshugu areas), with the savings, you may either stay overnight or have lavish meal in Nikko or spend elsewhere); iii) You may explore the Toshugu complex at your own leisure with plenty of time to spare as the morning tour usually ends before 1pm, if you travel on your own without joining the morning/ afternoon tour, you will probably take more than a day to cover all of the places in the itinerary because you will need to spend a lot of times waiting for buses from one place to another.  How to reach:1) We stayed in Shinjuku and there are a few options to travel to Nikko from there. Below are the two options you may consider (excludes Japan rail, you may want to explore this option on your own).   i) Most economical way: Take train to Asakusa (train time may differ, please check the day before you travel):• From Shinjuku (JR), take JR Chuo Line Local Service to Kanda (Tokyo) (Depart: 5:13am - 17min) @¥160, change to Tokyo Metro Ginza Line to Asakusa (Tobu/Subway) (Arrive: 5:44am - 10min) @¥160• From Shinjuku (JR), take JR Yamanote Line (Outer Loop) to Ueno (Depart: 5:02am/ 5:20am - 25min) @¥190, change to Tokyo Metro Ginza Line to Asakusa (Tobu/Subway) (Arrive: 5:44am/6:04am - 5min) @¥160. From Asakusa, walk over to Tobu Asakusa Station and take train Rapid (includes in 2-Day Nikko Pass)/ Ltd Exp (additional fee apply) to Tobu-Nikko Stn (train time may differ, please check the day before you travel):• Rapid (2hr10min)/ Section Rapid (2hr20min). Need to change train 5-6 bound for Nikko (Depart: 6:20 & Arrive: 8:25; Depart from Nikko: 17:39 & Arrive at Asakusa: 20:05pm)• Limited Express: Additional @¥1,120/way (1hr50min) (Depart: 7:30/ 8:30 & Arrive: 9:18/ 10:39; Depart Nikko: 17:36 & Arrive Asakusa:19:35pm). ii) More expensive but direct way (but you will arrive after the pick-up time, unless the tour operator agreed to wait till your arrival, or not, I will not recommend): Take train directly from Shinjuku (train time may differ, please check the day before you travel).	• Depart: Shinjuku ¥3,900/way @7:30 & Arrive: Tobu-Nikko @9:29am  • Depart: Tobu-Nikko @16:37 & Arrive: Shinjuku@18:36pm. 2) We opt for the most economical way, i.e. take train to Asakusa and from Tobu Asakusa Station, take Rapid/Section Rapid/Ltd Exp to Tobu Asakusa Station because the other way only has one train per day, the train will arrive at the Tobu-Nikko Station a few minutes after the pick-up time and it is costly."
187,"Peace, some culture, many regional gems, including nice countryside people.","If you really want to enjoy Nikko, make sure you have at least two days. Spend one day exploring temple square and lovely little city of Nikko and another exploring area all the way from Yumoto onsen to Kegon falls. This amazing area offers everything from old temples to amazing nature with waterfalls and mineral water springs. If you like mountains and nature, than take a bus to Yumoto and walk along the hiking tour that will lead you around places like impressive Yudaki Waterfall, Ryuzu falls, relaxing Chuuzenji lake and all the way to biggest waterfall in Japan - Kegon falls. Oh and make sure to try some of the local ramen shops - some of them offer best ramen I had in Japan.I visited Nikko four times to this day and have never been dissapointed."
188,Nikko National Park,We went up the mountains from Nikko at the start of March. As we got up higher there was more snow about. One problem is that at this time of the year some of the attractions such as the Ropewlk are closed.
189,Bring extra time with you,"Nikko is a small city in Japan’s Tochigi Prefecture, in the mountains north of Tokyo. It’s the site of Toshogu, the famed Shinto shrine established in 1617 as a lavish memorial for Tokugawa Ieyasu, founding ruler of the Tokugawa shogunate, or Edo Period. The shrine comprises the gilded Yomeimon Gate, the main sanctuary set in a cedar grove and the tomb itself. Nikko National Park with your temples is unmissable."
