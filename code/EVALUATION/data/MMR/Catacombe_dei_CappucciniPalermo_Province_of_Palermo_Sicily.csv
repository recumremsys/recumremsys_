0,Very interesting,"7 ‚Ç¨ entry fee. Very interesting, only a few place in the world are you able to have similar experience. About 30 minuts walk from city center. The highlight of my visit to Palermo."
1,Thought provoking experience.,It was easier to locate that we thought. For a 3 euro entrance fee you get an amazing experience. The catacombs are surprisingly peaceful and unscary. They are light and airy and you can wander about at will. The mummies are in various states of decay with some almost completely skeletal and others with clear features including facial hair. You are asked not to take photographs but there were people ignoring this request.
2,Must see in Palermo,Very powerful place to visit. Makes you really consider mortality. Absolutely fascinating. At only ‚Ç¨3 for entry its well worth a visit. No photos allowed which is only right showing respect for the dead.
3,Very interesting ,"Weird tourist attraction!  However, for only 3 euros you can't really complain."
4,A very rare sight that you shouldn't miss! ,"Really peculiar place. Only 3‚Ç¨, and you walk around it in about 30 minutes. What I found interesting was the clothes on the mummies. Really gave an indication of the time period these people lived in. Eventually had to escape though for fresh air. The cemetery next door is fascinating with loads of beautiful Art Deco tombs."
5,Very interesting ,Interesting place to visit. Not to expensive to get in only ‚Ç¨3.  Pretty amazing to see it all. Wouldn't recommending taking children there unless they are a bit more mature or able to show respect and be controlled. A shame about the people who disrespect things and take photo's even though there is signs and announcements saying NO PHOTO! It doesn't just mean not with flash like other places get it through your head! Would recommend a visit if you are into this stuff or after something different.
6,A long walk from the cathedral,3 euro in. It they don't really check tickets so u could sneak in About 2 km from centreVery good ounce you are not afraid of lots of dead bodiesVery well done No photos allowed but you can sneak a few but cameras everywhere
7,Not for thanatophobes.,The catacombs were a very different tourist experience. At ‚Ç¨3 entry it was well worth it as there are not many attractions like it.
8,Don't know how to describe this place,"Very macabre, one time visit only and Good value for money @ 3‚Ç¨ each.Very interesting and thought provoking üòèüòèüòèOnly downside of a local vagrant trying to charge for parking, and no need to do so."
9,Blown away,Very cheap to go in (‚Ç¨3) and just an odd place. Apparently you are not allowed to take photos but I saw several people doing it. I hope so don‚Äôt have weird dreams later tonight. Worth checking out - will take around 30-40 min to go through. There is no info provided at entry.
10,Really socking and marvellous experience. Only under 18. Really. ,Weird place which makes you think different.It is recommend to visit it but not for children. It is a  visit which stays in your mind.
11,Great experience!,Found this on a website of top things to do in Palermo so went along. Very interesting somber and different place to visit. Makes you think of your own mortality and not for everyone I would think and not for young children. One  feels that you need to be reverend and quiet on a visit.
12,A nice long walk from the Cathedral area.,Not as big as I thought it would be but very interesting and for 3 euros entrance fee really good value loved it
13,Wow,"Very interesting to see how they preserved there dead, made you feel very close, not creepy and very well worth the visit, I can imagine how I could now look if preserved and put to rest in a similar place rather than being cremated"
14,Catacombs,"The museum has the biggest selection of mummies in the world and you experience a different type of just a simple visit to a museum. The mummies are placed in a every single wall of the catacombs and are categorised according to the sex,age or social status. They wear their own clothes (even the cappucin monks) from 16th till 20th century. Don't forget to visit the room with the 2 year old girl that her body has remained almost intact from 1920! Sometimes it gets a bit scary but you won't regret it for sure. The ticket costs 4 euros."
15,Disrespect for the dead.,"Good to see, I have never seen so huge catacombs in my life. Entrance is ‚Ç¨3 which is not too much. It's 25 minutes walk from Cathedral."
16,A bizarre but incredible visit.,"This is a very strange place to visit. Its quite creepy but it was a unique experiance. It takes around half an hour to walk around, longer if you stop to look 'people' in detail. It gives you an idea of how people wanted to be remembered in thier clothing, which is a fascinating snapshot of late c.18th and c.19th century, if you can get past looking at the skeleton in the clothing. It is a little morbid and sad, especially  the children, but you won't see this any where in England and I did not regret going."
17,well worth the visit,"This was a strange place but awesome !8000 dressed up corpses but not scary .‚Ç¨3 to get in......closed between 1pm and 3pmGo, it's worth it"
18,A creepy experience ,"This is an interesting place to visit ! Entrance is only ‚Ç¨3. It is somewhat macabre to see all the skeletons dressed in clothes. 20 minutes is enough time to walk around. Just outside the entrance to the right is an unsigned entrance, and if you go through here you will find toilets."
19,Gruesome,This place is creepy but definitely worth to visit! You have to walk a bit to get there but its a good place to visit something you may have ever seen before. There is also a nice graveyard to have a little walk in shadow if its a hot day.
20,Not for everyone,Whilst in Palermo this is a must see. Very strange experience looking a dead people. Okay during the day but wouldn't like to be locked in at night!üòÑ Only thing that annoyed me was the amount of people disrespecting the notices everywhere not to take photos!
21,More interesting than expected ,Incredible collection of real bodies. It is worth a visit in order to lear how they used to trat bodies 400 years ago
22,Not for everybody,"An absolute must when in Sicily! The whole experience is eerie and intriguing. For just ‚Ç¨3 is well worth it.  Is not very well signposted though, we walked along this never ending street looking at the map,asked a local and there it was,just 20 m in front of us."
23,Fascinating but a bit macabre and touristy,"This site is just a few euro to enter, and it is well preserved and managed. Expect to see literally hundreds of full skeletons in era dress. There is also a section of deceased children fully dressed in their age appropriate garb. We did not stay long here, as it was not our taste.  Given a second chance, I would have skipped it altogether.  Not in a particularly convenient area either, and cabs on exit were nonexistent."
24,FASCINATING IF MACABRE,"This ranks high on the sites to see in Palermo, quite odd and probably unique in the world. if you are scarred then don't go as an aerie feeling - however we all end up this way but not necessarily on view"
25,Surprisingly dull,Ii was very scary. I could not finish my tour. It is awesome for those who like scary staff. Taking pictures are not allowed.
26,Like a horror movie set only real,"In my opinion a must see whilst in Palermo. At only ‚Ç¨3 per person this attraction also represents value for money. It is a fascinating journey back in time. Yes there are dead bodies down there but it is part of the cities history and is a fascinating glimpse into what people were like in the city. It became something of a status symbol to be interned in the tombs so ignore the macabre side of the tombs and look at what people are wearing and how they are positioned. Not much info in English in the place itself (like a lot of Sicilian historical sites) so have a read up about it before you visit.Yes some of the decaying cadavers are a little grotesque, but all the same it is an interesting place to visit if you enjoy history. We found it a little bit disrespectful in some ways, particularly the way some people persisted in taking photos when it is forbidden.Another recommendation - take a tuk tuk taxi like we did back down into the main city centre. The traffic is mad in Palermo but the tuk tuk drivers are even madder - a thrill a minute ride."
27,Museum of Cemetry,Very interesting place and a must see when in Palermo! I find it faszinating how good some corps are conserved and a bit spooky... Wouldn't want to stay there over night.
28,A bit macabre but absolutely fascinating,The view of thousands of skeletons is quite scarying and is not for everyone. The location is quite outside the city center. I got the negative impression that although it was not allowed to make photos inside ( because it is not appropriate to make photos of deceased people) they were selling postcards with skeletons and skulls outside.
29,None of your friends will have ever seen anyplace like this.,"A unique place to visit, but better without children :) For only 3 euros you can see thousands of mummies and corpses. The oldest are from 16th century, usualy monks and priests (capuchin monks are shown with ropes on their necks), mummies from 19th century are often rich local citizens or their children. Most famous mummy is two years old Rosalia Lombardo who died in 1920, she looks just like a sleeping little girl."
30,Very interesting,"Is a won off experience may be not for everyone ,8000 skeletons dressed according to their status it's unbelievable and takes sometime to take it all in"
31,Think unique is an over used term but v appropriate here,"Lucky the entry fee is only three euros because I couldn‚Äôt wait to get out.Row after row of decomposed bodies, and of course the ‚ÄúSleeping Beauty‚Äù a embalmed body of a small child.Wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a must see, but certainly very different to the norm."
32,Spooky bodies from 1500s,"Not sure how anyone can give this 5 stars. It's one of those 'attractions' that you go for the experience because you can. But there were no volunteers to go round a second time. It certainly presents death in all its finality. By the end I was happy for if to be over, and we were inside for only 20 minutes."
33,Maybe worth it just for the lesson,Place in Palermo You must visit. Hundrets of corpses / skeletons makes You feel strange and thrilled. Especially mumies of children and infants. Some of them so well preserved... We were seriously moved after the visit. Don't miss it!
34,O.M.G!!!,Impressive but hard to find. Information is a lack in this Catacombs. Not suitable for kids in my oppinion.
35,"Bizarre, Moving and Unique","This place is extraordinary, well worth the walk out trip.It is very interesting to see all these people being on display for all times to come, all are separated in rooms for men, women, priests and children... They are in very different shape, some just as skeleton and soon even have hair and ears, think that some have been here for many centuries. If you have time visit!"
36,Not for the squeamish ,"...unless you really like seeing dead bodies and skeletons.Three euro entry is fair considering the presentation of the people on display, although it is sad that these people are used as a tourist attraction.Only went as it was part of a tour we were on.It would benefit from some information either around the place or in a leaflet.No photos allowed at least but if you are desperate you can buy a set for four euros as postcards."
37,Awesome ‚ò†Ô∏è,"Easy to find. The man at the entrance is friendly and speaks english just enough. This place is really interesting, maybe a bit creepy for some at the beginning, but I'm sure anyone can easily get used to it. It's not too far from the center, I think it's worth giving it a try."
38,Interesting History,It‚Äôs not everyday you stroll into a place like this for 3Eur. Spent about 20 mins walking around. Fascinating but very plain. It would have been nice to have some more info during the visit (no signs actually explaining what you are seeing).
39,Fascinating,Something so different but wonderful to see.  It is on a bus route but not that frequent - walkable from city centre.
40,Excellent catacombe,Ghoulishy interesting... Its interesting to see how bodies have  been preserved and also the different types of people who were embalmed. Also to know that if your family didn't pay your body was put on a side shelf. Not necessarily everyone's cup of tea though we found it really interesting.
41,If you like this kind of thing ,This is a must thing to do in Palermo! The ticket is 3‚Ç¨. The place is stunning.The only disadvantage I think is that there are no descriptions so you have to ‚Äústudy ‚Äú before you go there!
42,Dreary visit,A unique experience for the hard of stomach! I would advise hiring a guide to understand the history of the catacombs. Inconveniently there are no waiting  facilities during its lunch closure.
43,Cool and Creepy ,No need of many words.. fantastic experience for 3‚Ç¨ in Palermo.Make sure you are brave enough and .... MEMENTO MORI.
44,"Bizarre, creepy, gruesome","Definitely worth a visit. They ask you do not take photos out of respect, I'm not sure how much respect was involved in excavating the corpses and charging the family to display it but I'm sure it was bordering on non-existent."
45,Gruesome and fascinating ,"Very reasonable entrance fee and the place is very interesting.  As you descend into the catacombs, one really has no idea what you are going to be viewing.  Once you are there, it is overwhelming the amount of bodies and the how perfectly they have been preserved.  So much history.  Unfortunately no photos are allowed so what I saw will have to stay in my head!"
46,Worth ticking off on your tourist checklist,I loved the catacombs but beware that there aren't any little information points in English so either book a tour or read up about it first before visiting!
47,"Strange, different",We drove for 30 min trying to find the place but didn't worry because trip adviser said they were open till midnight. We got there and they closed at 7:00.
48,Not for the faint hearted,"If you're able, walk here as it gets very congested with traffic and you pass so many interesting places and buildings on the way. It cost 3 euros to get in and once in it takes your breath away. It's not scary just fascinating to see all the dead people in their original clothes. Never seen anything like it and left the 4 of us in awe. Well worth a visit."
49,Long walk ,Hard to review to be honest but I think it is one of them things that you want the experience of seeing but wouldn't be rushing back. Cheap entry. A very eerie experience but fascinating at the same time. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who is a bit squeamish or children.
50,Take it or leave it ,Really shocking and unique place with very kind fratelli. Really not allowed underage people. It is very very exceptional. Never seen such before.
51,Bizarre and Eerie... but Interesting,"Exclusive experience, weird feeling, very impressive. A bit far from the center by feet but it's worth it.No picture allowed"
52,Where else in the world you can experience anything like this?,"Take the deour, get lost in the slum area of the city and find this place, it is worth it.  Again, small and you need maybe 30 minutes to see it you you walk slowly but very cool."
53,Would not go out of your way,"I had read about this place and I had the chance to visit it in August. It is walkable from Palermo train/bus station (40 minutes approx) but the roads can be tricky to cross, so caution should be exercised. The entry fee is ‚Ç¨3 and you enter an underground macabre world of skeletons which have been placed there since 1599.The rest of Palermo is rather run down although it has an abundance of Baroque churches."
54,Interesting but not for everyone ,"Most of the guides given the wrong address of this place. You have to go a little bit to see the catacombs, but their view stays in memory."
55,Amazing and must see,Bit scary but worth to visit. It is easy to walk to from the centre. The entrance is 2.50 and you can walk around by yourself. It is fascinating how all the skeletons are preserved for such a long time.
56,See lots of mummified remains ,"We decided to visit this attraction in Palermo during our last holiday in Sicily in 2013. Admission is ‚Ç¨ 3 per person and during attraction visit is forbidden to take pictures and filming. Inside we saw a quantity of mummies which are kept there. It's a bit morbid, but very very interesting! I recommend just for adults. Children may be afraid!"
57,Not for me,"Good value for money at 3 euros, slightly unsettling but very interesting and worth a visit. The preservation witnessed is fascinating"
58,Grotesque and Mesmerizing,"Visited April, couple of weeks ago, 3euros per person if i remember rightly. awe inspiring, eye opening visit if you can, you will never see anything like this again."
59,Very interesting,"Visited out of curiosity, only a few euros to get in. Underneath the church you find rows and rows of skeletons some of which are in remarkably good state of preservation.  Beware there is a section for children and babies. Some have been hung from the walls, some are laying on shelves. It's an interesting look at how a previous culture dealt with death."
60,Definitely an unforgettable experience,"This place is well worth a visit at E3 per person. It features hundreds of partly to fully decomposed bodies mostly hanging in an upright position along the walls, some dating back to at least the 1600s. Interesting but maybe not a place to take the kids."
61,Very interesting ,Very bizarre place. The only interesting part is how the dead people are dressed in that period. Rest I found full of dust and very gloomy and dark.  Management don't want you to take pictures as you have to respect the dead people. of course is right but then they want you to pay to go and see it. As well they took some pictures in advance for the advertising of the place..i don't honestly I know why I decided to go...
62,It was OK,We went there with 2 teenagers. We all found the place very unique and interesting. We did not have a guide but I will definitely recommend to read a little about it before visiting. We spent around 1 hour at the place and it is easy to park just outside.All photos and films are forbidden inside. Pls. respect!!
63,Fascinating,"Interesting to visit, but the presentation is not for tourists - information is not presented in any way except audio guide"
64,Tales from the crypt,"Dead people all around you. Very interesting but can get very scary for some. Still, one of the must see in Palermo."
65,A must if you are in Palermo,"A wonderful place to get out of the heat of the day!  Very strange walk through the past!  Amazing how well preserved the bodies were, you could still see hair and patterns in the robes they were wearing.  Shouldn't be missed."
66,bony folk,"A very impressive site, highly recommended for a visit. There are probably few such places on earth (or slightly under) that are still open to the public."
67,Forget the Egyptians.,3 euros entry fee. closed b/w 1230 and 1500hrs.it's morbid yet sad to see all those bodies. the bodies however have been preserved so well. they're divided by societal classes. the children were most disturbing.
68,Bizarre but....,"Easy walk from the central district. Just map it first. Only $3 euros each. Read up on it first on Wikipedia. Found that helpful. Some say it is musty and smells, we did not experience that. It is much more ""stinky"" outside with all the smokers and from the dogs peeing and pooping on sidewalks. Found it interesting inside. You will probably spend no more than 20 minutes walking through it.  Might not be a good place to take small children, could be creepy for them. We also found it interesting to walk through the cemetery just to the left. It is free to walk around in there and different than ours in America. Also on the walk to the catacombs we found a cute little ceramic store with great prices. It was on Cappucini. You can watch the family painting the ceramics right there. It has been open for over three generations. Enjoy!"
69,Interesting Visit to the Catacombs,A very interesting place to visit. The locals seemed very happy to help us find this location. 327 bus from Palermo. Inside it's a maze and a spectre of preserved bodies. It's a bit of a shock. We left feeling a mixture of emotions. I left feeling sad and quite shocked. There wasn't information in the catacombs to explain anything so read up on it before going in. No photos aloud.
70,Unique experience in Palermo,"It's eery but very interesting . You can see human bodies in different states of decay, some still with human hair intact. Read up before or later on the story of the young girl who died of pneumonia but is still well preserved"
71,Not for the Squeamish,"Different culture explained visually. Great experience, and so different from the where I am coming from. Do it, try it and bring some friends."
72,Creepy but absolutely fascinating,"For 3 Euros we spent an hour there which is very reasonable. It is about a 30 minutes walk from the Cathedral so if your walking is not so strong in the heat its worth looking for taxi or bus options.The catacomb itself is morbid, as expected, but I found it incredible thought provoking. Before going I recommend reading about it as there is no information there.To think people paid for their loved ones to be preserved, displayed (hung or in coffins with a glass side), so that they could visit them, to share occasions with them, to hold their hands again, is interesting in itself. Most of the bodies are in their best clothes ready for whatever is after death.Sad however that, as time goes on they are forgotten about. And now, the only ones to read their names (if they have one) are us tourists. A fascinating experience that gets you thinking."
73,A must see,"If you are in Palermo for more and 1 day then just go to the center train station, take the 109 and interchange in Plazza Indipenza with 823 for 5 stops, pay just 3‚Ç¨ and let yourself go back in time while visiting this Catacombe. It has a huge amount of Cappuccini in a quite ""live"" presentation. The atmosphere is a bit heavy but it's the most interactive method to learn about their history. Despite the-not so attractive sight-it's worth visiting!"
74,"Not for the fainthearted, but an interesting take on Sicilain culture","A must see if you are visiting Palermo, not for everyone though...very interesting and something you won't see often."
75,I see dead people,Do not miss this catacombs if you are in Palermo. Everywhere skulls bones. Nice experience you will see how you will be look like 200 years later.
76,"Unique and weird, must see","It is a creepy, but an interesting experience. You can see skeletons from 1840 up to 1940 and also the famous Rosalia, the well-preserved corpse of the little girl. It is better if you read about the place before, so you can understand more about the burials and mummification customs of that time"
77,Unique experience and SO WORTH ,This is a must visit when in Palermo. Forget the high priced tours ... Entrance is only 3 Euro... and the Catacombs are accessible by a leisurely walk or taxi. Historically... fantastic...  just remember... it is a crypt
78,Best attraction in Palermo,"This is the busiest we have seen anywhere in our 3 days visiting Palermo. 3 Euro per person- paid to a monk- will get you to see at least 8000 dead remains including ‚Äúvirgins, professionals, clergy‚Äù and other interesting categories as described by the attraction.When the original cemetery was full the answer was to dig deep and created a new area of ‚Äústorage‚Äù - the first being in 1599; Silvestro of Gubbio, he was mummified. In addition to the 8000 I should have said there is at least another 1200 mummified remains as well.Lots of coffins- open and closed. Very dusty remains. Goes on and on and on.Interesting place and has you thinking about your own mortality.O and the last person ‚Äúburied‚Äù - actually fully preserved in a sealed case is Rosalia Lombardo (aged 2) who died of pneumonia. Her father arranged this and the body is further preserved for all to see. Ummmmm! Whatever your thoughts, it will be sometime before you forget this attraction.Well worth a visit!"
79,Skulls but no cross bones ,"Situated north of the main hotel district, this attraction is slightly difficult to locate, so ensure that you are conversant with the map when you set off - by bus and foot is entirely feasible. The mummified / skeletal bodies are slightly musty and the subject of intermittent illicit photos. The decaying dress is intriguing and let's face it, a composite reminder that tempus fugit. I would recommend hanging around outside one of the cafes in the road approaching the Catacombs, several Capuchin monks strolled past and made an interesting photo assignment - but I would be over-stating the opportunity to say they were cooperating !"
80,This is a Must See,If you don't like dead people do not go here! It's a strange place but in its way beautiful. All those corpses hanging there for so many years some for 100 years. I'm glad I've visited this place! It left an impression!
81,Meet the ancestors ,"About a quarter hour walk from the Norman Palace, this is a fascinating place. It is not very well signposted but we eventually managed to find it although you can dropped off there on the city bus tours.Set out in corridors of monks, professionals, women, children, etc there are thousands of mummified corpses on display - some are hanging from the walls dressed in their best clothes, others are lying on shelves. The most moving is the body of a two year old girl. Some may find it a bit macabre but it is not scary - we found it fascinating. There were plenty of people there with children but it would depend on each family as to whether they think it appropriate. It is not possible to take photographs in the catacombs but there are plenty to see online if you want to decide whether to go or not."
82,Downright weird,"Really interesting - definitely worth a visit if you are around Palermo. They could have more signs and stories about the bodies, but I assume they want you to buy the guidebook. I would be wary taking very young children unless they like spooky stuff as it is a bit eery, but nothing that any older child or adult would find unpleasant. A word of warning (as I was caught off guard and confused) when you park outside you will probably be asked to pay ‚Ç¨2 for a man to ""watch"" your car. This is nothing official but you don't really have much choice and is a general problem in Palermo and across southern Italy."
83,Impressive collection of corpses in various stages of decay,"Very uncommon attraction, hard to find something similiar somewhere else.Taking photos is forbidden but it is obvious in that kind of place."
84,A somber and sacred place but worth the effort to get here.,"Actually a nice place to visit in Palermo, a cultural experience first of all. One can learn a lot from it."
85,Macabrely fascinating,"Only a 3.5kmts walk from the port is this interesting is macabre catacombs. 8000 bodies hanging from the walls, adults, kids, hung there over centuries now in various stages of decay. Certainly interesting and well worth the only ‚Ç¨3 admission."
86,Not sure about this ine,"In one word- amazing! I have visited Paris catacombs which are really impressive in size and atmosphere but here things are even more creepy- bodies with clothes ranged by their gender, position in the society. For those who can not watch horror movies I do not recommend. But for others 100% yes! Just be aware that taking pictures is strictly prohibited and there are cameras everywhere and they see everything! It is not cold and not hot inside but rather warm so do not expect to cool after a walk ( if you go by foot). Also there is a nice cemetery behind and is also worth to pay a visit there."
87,Long way out closes from 1 - 3,This is a must visit on a trip to Palermo if the idea of being around dead people doesn't bother you. It was very interesting but sent a few chills down my spine!
88,Eery and wonderful,"It is a bit difficult to get there by public transportation, and the visit was really rather short (20 minutes), but still worth a go. The entrance fee of 3 euros was well s≈°pent and of all the catacombs we have visited this one was the most impressive."
89,Very Macabre ,Do not miss this place. Maybe the only one in the world of this kind. Bodies were preserved using a different method. Some stay in very good condition. Amazing. Not the same feeling when you see it live than in a photo or video. You need a car to get there. Located away from‚Ä¶
90,Moving,"It was quite interesting and the ticket is cheap. Only 3 Euros/person. The bodies are well preserved and presented upon different galleries, but with no explantion relying to how old they are or what their story is. This can be improved."
91,Very interesting and not like anything else,"Well worth a visit here, entrance is cheap, and a visit will typically last 30 minutes. There is no smell - for those that may be concerned about this, and is not in the slightest bit scary or gory. There are in fact some very well preserved bodies, including one of a little girl Rosario, who was the last to be in turned here in approximately 1920."
92,Fabulous place!,"A bit bizarre Place to og, but the curiosity caught up With us. Be aware of People that will watch Your car for Money if you park in the area. Its free parking so no need for that. We chose to move tha car further away, not possible to know what that People will do. Hence not a particularly Nice area around the entrance. We paid 3 EUR to get in, it was Worth it. A special look to walk inbetween dead People on Exhibition like that. I must say, i picked up some  energy a Place in there, but surpisingly calm energy even so many destinies on display. I highly recomment for those who seek alternatives to churches and fountains."
93,"Eerie, negative vibe - but visit","The best place to visit in Palermo. It will blow your mind, now I know how Tim burton makes all those animations. The inspiration is here.Fabrizio is also very nice and helpful person, you can ask him more about the history of the place"
94,Fascinating! You must visit.,Very interesting history to be seen but remember this is the final resting place of these people and no photographs are allowed. The dessicated bodies are only covered by clothing so if you are squeamish this might not be the place for you. we found it both peaceful and thought provoking
95,Easily the weirdest place I have been to date.,"We were in Palermo five days so made time to see this,if you are here only a few days I would skip this. It‚Äôs a long walk from the centre but cheap to go in. So many more interesting places to visit. It‚Äôs pretty Morbid and perhaps not nice for young children. My partner said glad we did it , I did not agree !"
96,"if you are not scared, it's a must visit","It is a bit far from the center but it is worth the visit. Although we read about it before, we were shocked when stepped in. I don't know why, but we thought that there must be a short ""warm up"" to prepare ourselves to this extraordinary experience, still there isn't. Be prepared for this trip!"
97,PLACE MACABRE,very interesting cemetry and museum where almost 1000 or more skeletons of dead people of the past are either stuck on the wall or displayed in special cases.You feel like you are on a horror movie.
98,A true curiosity ,Very interesting but had an awful nights sleep. The presentation is done very well and because we had a private guide was informative.
99,Worth a visit!,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Catacombs. It was weird but really interesting. I was visiting as a day trip from a cruise ship stop off. There are lots of people offering excursions etc at the port where the ship docks. I asked specifically for a taxi to take me to the catacombs. The first 5 or 6 weren't interested because they wanted tourists who would do 3 or 4 destinations for 100-150 euro, but I just kept asking. Eventually one taxi driver said he would take us to the catacombs, wait for us and then leave us back into the shopping area of Palermo for 50euro.  (20-25mins by taxi). As it turned out he took us to a nearby car park where his son took us instead. There was no sign that this was an actual taxi and in hindsight it concerns me, however the young driver did take us, and waited, and took us back.  The Catacombs were well worth a visit although it felt a bit run down. Nevertheless, it was certainly a highlight of my trip.  No photos are allowed so I bought a postcard selection which described the history. Entry to the attraction is 3 euro and you are left to wander round yourself. About 35-45 minutes is probably enough."
100,A must visit to the world of mummies,"It‚Äôs something you won‚Äôt see again and it was an experience to visit.  You could touch almost them, you were that close at times.  It is a walk of 1km after getting off the hop on hop off bus at stop 7 on the red line or you can drive and park out front if you wish. I wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
101,My wife's dream come true,"This is an amazing display of corpses, most incredibly well preserved. A must see for us although others many wonder.It is important not to consider walking here, as we did. This is not a good idea as suddenly big roads with many people around turn into very run down areas where my wife felt very uncomfortable. Get a taxi for E15."
102,Interesting but wouldnt want to do it again,Its hard to describe how you may feel when you exit this tourist attraction. I was attracted by the history and the story but I did feel guilt wandering around and staring into the faces of the upper crust of society from centuries ago who are now on show for the public in  their former fineries. Some will find it undignified and disrespectful and others will justify it as the families of the displayed did centuries ago. Its only 3 euro per person so if you find the former to be the case then you haven't lost a lot and you can turn round and walk out.
103,Creepy but nice ,It is truely a unique experience but after the first few corpses includng the babies - well they are more or less the same.  Not sure about how ethical it is to make money from those who have died.  a bit of excitment wondering if some bits are going to break off and fall on‚Ä¶
104,Difficult to rate this one!,Amazing trip! Our guide Ricardo had a wealth of knowledge and is very passionate historian. Could have asked for  a better guide.
105,"A bit eerie, but fascinating nonetheless.","For people into weird, this is worth the six Euros.  It‚Äôs an easy 30 minute walk out the North Portal from the historic district.  They ask that you not take photos but there are postcards for sale of the more interesting mummies."
106,Not for the squeamish,Following a recommendation we toured this site. It is very confronting units presentation.Think carefully before your visit.It is odd in its presentation of young children and may not be appropriate for your young children.
107,Strange but fascinating,"Cost five euro I think and a most interesting place to visit. Some 8000 corpses in various states of preservation /decay, clustered by e.g. profession, virgins, clergy etc. Lovely cemetery next door too. Area a bit dodgy and a cab only costs about 10 euro from the centre. We spent about an hour there and will never forget how interesting it is."
108,not too scary as one thinks,Taking of photos are not allowed. Kids are allowed as long as not scared of dead people/skeletons. Short walk from Normanni. Sending of postcard is available.
109,An experience I won't be repeating.,It's worth the trip.  About 30 min walk from Royal Palace.  This catacomb is more like extended basement of the church above with extensive corridors that are occupied by mummies.  Most of the residences are rather frayed and in bad shape but I suppose mummies are meant to be that way.  This practice is rather unique in this area until early 20th century.  The famous little Rosalia Lombardo rests in peace but she started to look rather darker than pictures I've seen from the past.
110,An unusual attraction,"I payed a fee of 3 euros to see corpses of monks, musicians,  teachers, and other people that are burried there. I thought it was a catacombe only for monks, something historic and mysterious. I lost my time..."
111,Interesting place!,"This place looks nearby the old town, but during a sunny afternoon in July it is a long walk!Not sure if it is worth the effort. If you are short in time, skip it.We took a taxi back to the 4 Canti for about 15euro"
112,Slightly boring ,"You will never have an experience like it. Once down the steps inside, you expect to see a few old well preserved bodies/skeletons, but you are quickly gobsmacked by the amount of them. Yes it's creep and at time a bit scary, but you get used to it and fortunately it doesn't smell down there. What's the most fascinating part is seeing the costumes, frozen in time. Amazing. Like seeing a piece of human history and so close you could (if you were weird and disturbed) touch them, they are so close. A must see."
113,This is a travesty,"We have visited a lot of Catacombs in particular recently the ones in Malta ,this is the first where the bodies have been hung on hooks and left to dedicate complete with clothes and hair in a few cases.It made you realise that whoever you think you in life now we all end up looking the same when dead.A great leveller."
114,Weird but interesting,its a bit freaky but good to see. amazing the condition of bodies still. sad looking at the child in the coffin as she looks like she is only sleeping
115,Interesting and difficult at the same time,"Would highly recommend but be advised if you have kids it might not leave a pretty picture in their head, not that it is scary in any kind if way to my perspective but i cant say the same for kids."
116,Not for faint of heart,"Strange creepy place. We were two couples and our friends liked the place very much, but for me and my husband it was too creepy with all the corpse hanging from the walls. Anyway it great place to start exploring Palermo if you are with car. The parking in front is free (not obligatory but we gave 2 euros to the bagger hanging there) and the Cathedral of Palermo is at walking distance (15 minutes)."
117,Love it or hate it,"These catacombs host thousands of dried dead bodies. The visit is cheap and worth it. However children and people who impress themselves should strictly avoid this place. The bods are not well kept, and seem to be abandoned. An effort to their preservation is imminent, before it is too late. I wonder if the monks who take care of the place, ever go down there themselves. Entrance is extremely cheap ( 2 Euro). They should consider increasing this fee and making an effort for the better preservation of the place."
118,The wierdest experience ever,"Since this is my first catacombs I rate it very good.  Easy to maneuver, only had a bad smell in one small corner. Agreed, not much info on most of the corpses, but interesting to see various stages of decay and dress, and to read the markers in the floor. 3 euro entrance fee and if you drive yourself be prepared to be extorted for 2 euro to park in the square. This is Sicily after all !"
119,Disappointed in the depths of the catacombe,"We took the tour bus in Palermo and you get off at no 7 stop I think and it is about a 15 min walk, it does close at lunchtime so just be careful and check the opening times before you go it costs 3 euro each to get in. Interesting to see, worth visiting."
120,Creepy but cool,"I have been to quite a few bone chapels in Europe, but this is truly a unique experience.  Here you will see all levels of Palermatino citizenry, mummified, left as bones in their final state...to include the wardrobe.  It is truly hard to describe.  It may not be for everyone, but my family and I found a visit here truly fascinating."
121,Excellent for what this place represents,"I had heard about this place and wanted to visit. It's a fascinating piece of social history, they were divide by social rank even in death. It's not for everyone, my husband left after about 5 minutes but I found it fascinating.  It was very quiet when we were there and I found it very peaceful."
122,Macabre Mumies,"Definitely worth the 3 EUR entrance fee, but it would have been nice with some more information down in the catacombes. You had to pay 4 EUR for the guidebook, which didn't really seem worth it. Still, I'd recommend going there, it was interesting even without the additional‚Ä¶"
123,Wouldnt advise to go,It is a really interesting place to go if you haven't been in catacombs before. You will be disturbed by the quality of the mommys. Don't look at them too long ;-)
124,Strange experience,It's a very special and interesting place to visit. Must see it. But you will not feel relaxed or calm after it. We started the day there and avoided the crowd.
125,Not for everyone,"Incredible to visit, very confronting. Do not recommend for children at all. Avoid walking here as the road is very narrow and busy."
126,Not sure ! ,"You can take your time and see everything in 45 minutes. Preety cool in a dark tourism way. It's a bit outside the historical area. Could have done with more information on why, when and who. I think they were more interested in selling their guide. Note the times are 9:00-1:00 and 3:00-6:00."
127,Easy walk in cooler months -inexpensive,We visited this place today. It‚Äôs a little out of the main town however we walked there. (Nothing else around to see nearby.)  Only about 20 stairs down to the ‚Äú catacombs.‚Äù Not as cool as I hoped. The skeletons are mostly vertical and dressed. I didn‚Äôt like seeing their heads. There was a baby and children section which I could barely look at.Only took me about 20 mins then I was out. It would be interesting for many people but not for me.
128,Wow,Very unique experience.  Worth the trip.  We have been all over the world and nothing like it.  Straight out of a horror flick.
129,Unbelievable!,"My wife and I walked to the Crypt. Only 3 euro entrance fee. It was well worth it. We saw bodies in there from 1599. They have the bodies arranged from men, women, children, professional...etc. Some of these people still have skin, hair, beards, and eyebrows. Worth the trip to go there."
130,‚ÄúOpen‚Äù cemetery with a lot of bones,These catacombs are fascinating and well worth a vist. The bodies are mainly monksAnd later they mummified locals. The locals would come dress them and pray for their souls.
131,Awkward experience,I would recommend this interesting place to anybody! I have never experienced such thing before. The toilets could have some renovation.
132,Macabre and mesmerising,interesting to discover how some bodies are be preserved but after half hour it's really enough. Good for scientists.
133,"Atmospheric, creepy, spooky and plain weird.","It took as a while to find it walking as I trusted my google map and after many wrong turns we found the place much easier to go up the straight road past the Palace. When we went down to the Cattacombs I nearly turned back at the sight of so many dead bodies but after the long walk we ventured in. Very interesting but quite disturbing, although a must see if you are visitingbthe city as you will probably never see anything quite like this again."
134,Halloween came early,I would not bring small kids to this place but many prove did. I am not a parent so cannot say how to deal. It is at least 1-3 bus changes from Palermo. The cemetery behind it is quit nice too. Still active so please note that people are still visiting their loved ones. The history and the catacombs are not like anything I have seen before. Unlike the catacombs of Paris and Rome. Very interesting and worth doing if you like this type of history.
135,Must visit,"Decided to walk there from the centre of Palermo- took me about 25 min and got lost but people were happy to help. I think I was lucky because there was nobody there to charge for the entry. The sight was really striking, especially a little girl whose body was so well preserved it looked as if she was asleep!"
136,A bit creepy ,"Definetly a must see, however there was no information in english. Its in a weird neighbourhood we went there by car and paid for parking. You also pay for enterance like 3 euros."
137,Interesting and spooky,"Definitely creepy as you are walking through rows and rows of very well preserved dead bodies, but the history of the pace was fascinating.  I would definitely recommend seeing this if in the area"
138,"Historic, Unique Catacomes Not For Faint of Heart (not for small children)",Interesting experience and quite shocking tbh but not much info on the general idea of the existance of the tombs. Just opened coffins and mummies everywhere :)
139,Incredible spot just outside palermo old centre,"It was about a 20 minute walk from the Norman Palace. It was a pretty direct route but there were very few signs posted to let you know you were on the right path, but I've found that to be pretty typical in Italy. Luckily there were plenty of friendly people willing to direct us. The person at the desk was not very forthcoming with information. This was a cash only spot and cost ‚Ç¨3 per person. There was a tv screen showing people in the caves but we didn‚Äôt notice any security people down in the catecombes themselves. There were signs posted throughout ‚Äúno photos‚Äù. However, as you can see by all the photos posted on this review, many people took photos anyway though I only saw one person doing this while I was there. The skeletons were quite interesting, but dusty. I was surprised that there was no odor at all. It was a bit creepy! While this place would not be for everyone, I don't know where else in the world you can experience anything like this!"
140,Depressing and Boring. ,It was interesting but I wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to see this unless they are really fascinated by this type of attraction. The place can be stuffy and claustrophobic but luckily our visit was at an off-peak time with just a handful of people there so I didn't feel the full effect of claustrophobia. Not to be disrespectful but the continuous walls of corpses got repetitive after a while. What I didn't expect was to be so affected by the babies. Having family and friends who have experienced this loss hit a bit too close to home for me. Also not a good place to go if you are dealing with death and loss as it is all quite sad and morbid.
141,Fascinating.,"We parked nearby at the 'Parking Area Camper Green' which was about 5 minute walk away and cost 1 euro/hour. We had a short wait before the catacombs opened following the lunchtime closure, the door was opened and we were told that it cost 3 euros per person.Having visited other macabre attractions, this was really impressive. I'm not sure what we expected but there were so many mummies to look around and it was extremely interesting.There was another english family who had a young (4/5) year old child with them, which is probably a bit risky. You are very close to the mummies when walking around, and they are at various stages of decomposition."
142,Creepy but fascinating.,A fair walk out of the town and unfortunately just timed so they had closed. Visited the interesting cemetery attached with Ornate crypts housing families. 
143,Busiest tourist attraction in Palermo,"Catacombs are quite easy to find, entrance is right of Capuchins cemetery in the corner. I gave only 4 stars because, there should be more extensive description of some mummies. Never the less, quite an experience...."
144,Unique,It says its a must see in palermo but unsure if we made the right desision to go what you must realise is these are people not mumies and youre in very close proximety to them although faconating as they are in the actual clothes from that time i personally felt as though we were being watched if youre perceptive to these things you will pick up on it there were two upper levels but something told me not to go any further you are actually walking over graves here also..definatly dont take children here as there are bodies of children hanging from the wall..i said sorry when leaving the catacombe as felt we kind of intruded on them whilst there and on return weve been having very strange dreams haunted dreams infact.
145,Weird,"Well?? What do you expect to see!! It's very well advertised and near top (attraction?)of Places to go in PalermoIT was their choice !! & everyone entering should know what to expect, get real fellow travelers please!!Read the history its always been about money making (by monks!!)that's why it was stopped hundred years agoAs an attraction its sort of  weirdly fascinating, If you think its disrespectful or repulsive,save yer money!The clothing styles from early monks through to approx 1900'sIs interesting, and the history of how it started with just the monks and developed into a money making procedure for monastery  only the rich could afford before stopped by city council and the different types mumming procedures are evident as you go from eldest to newest (little girl in crib) Is it disrespectful?? Remember most of the town's people mummified here paid lots of money to be put here in their best gear,not to be put in a grave like 99.9% of less rich people in PalermoAnd most importantly it was theirs or their families choice to be quite literally left ""hanging a around""  for eternity!And if medical science can ever bring you back to life, then these guys are surely first in que,! If by chance they ever wake at least they will be with their mates not trapped in a box!You pay's yer money and you make yer choices in life (death)Enjoy!!"
146,Scarily fascinating ,I have been too so many catacombs but this was the only one that I seen mummies face to face.  It's not scary at all after all.  Definitely recommended. 3 Euro per person.  The Catacombs is closed from 1230 - 1500 and we have to come back the next day.  Open from 0900 - 1230 then 1500 - 1700.
147,Interesting and odd place ,"Visited today by myself since I could not get anyone to visit with me. It does not take a lot of time, so if you are short on time it is a good choice."
148,Confronting,"Only ‚Ç¨3 but when you‚Äôve seen one skull wrapped in material you‚Äôve seen them all. Slightly disturbing, and nothing to help guide you to different areas in English, so I didn‚Äôt know what I was looking at. Skipped the queues and left pretty quickly...."
149,Fascinating,"A bit out of the way of the city, this was an interesting visit and reasonably priced at ‚Ç¨3. It will not be to everyone's taste and some people inside were not enjoying it as it is quite graphic...! I however found it very interesting, very different to the catacombs of Rome, this is more of a museum but glad i went"
150,Weird but worth it,"This place is not for everybody: definitively not for children nor people very sensible to death things and of certain strong beliefs. Nor is it for people looking for a funny happy time. One person in my group walked out within 3 minutes of entering. This place demands respect as it is a sacred ground in all sense of Christian history.  Definitively, the place is kind of weird and difficult to understand unless you do some research on it first or as soon as you leave. The aisles are cool and not well lit, full of smell of ancient things and garments. You will see walls full of decayed corpses and bodies preserved just as if they were mummies dressed in 18 or 19 century garments. Many were local clergymen but there are common folk as well as historical personalities from every corner of Sicily as well. If you have the heart and curiosity to walk all the way to the farthermost aisle, you will see the excellently preserved body of a 2 year old girl inside a glass enclosure, be forewarned it can be an eerie sight.   I committed the almost sacrilegious act of taking a few pictures, which clearly is stated as forbidden, and was scared to the bone when all of a sudden a deep voice in the loudspeaker reverberated in the aisles in Italian ""Respect the dead, no pictures please!"". I walked out pale-faced. Priceless."
151,Strangely unmoved,"It is macabre and scary, but it is also most fascinating to view where the old religious and societal practices lead at some stage, and how relative our beliefs are.  Then it was desired, now seems a disrespect, but there we are: the collection of the dead in their best attire, according to their wishes.  There is plenty of information on the internet about the catacombs, so you can find out exactly what was happening.  It was easy to find."
152,Intense!!!,"It was a special place for my Palermo Trip.I never saw something similar. Of course, we speak about a macabre attraction, but this mix of feelings could have once on a lifetime.Many bodies is in a good condition and for some of them the preservation were spectacular. We could not take photos inside.If a remember correct, ticket was 6 euros/person.I recommend to visit the catacombs, if you are not very sensible."
153,Mummy not there ,... very strong impact and way how to meet with another attitude to death... Good to visit on the way to cathedral... Then to relax on the cathedral roof..
154,I love this stuff,"Some will like it some not. 8000 dead people can make impression if you accept it. The little, 2 y.o. girl embalmed 100 years ago can be considered spectacular. Decide yourself if you like such attractions. No photo inside."
155,Macabre but fascinating,"Rows and rows of skeletons dressed up in old fashioned clothing, good and cheap way to kill some time, also a good way to get out of the heat. Pretty sad/surreal to think all those people were living life one day, RIP."
156,8000 dead people,"This place was fascinating, but I do know some folks who could NEVER visit this site [definitely NOT for young children.]  A different way of doing things I'd say. Bodies, bodies and more bodies, every age and size displayed by hanging from the walls, laid on shelves or in deteriorating caskets. This was certainly worth the price of admission if you are interested in other cultures and their care of the dead! [Tour takes way less than an hour, 'cause after a while it's sort of repetitious.]"
157,WOW!!!,"Very impressing to be here. The bodies/skeletons are well preserved. Very confronting to see thus all, including seeing the children. We were there about 20 min and then you've seen everything. It is absolutely worth a visit, very impressing. Price was good, 3 euros."
158,One of a Kind Experience,A must see. I did not know that these skeletons had facial expressions.Right from the start of the tour you will be amazed.A short walk down the stairs and your right into it.Should not be missed
159,Bit freeky...,"It is soooo interesting! Really must-see place in Palermo. Always wanted to visit it and my dream came true.  Don't think I'm not into the dead bodies but it is very interesting to visit such a mysterious place,  where the people were graved  few centuries ago. And you can see them - everything.  Even hair,  nail, beards etc.And the Rosalie mummy is priceless.  In scientific sense I mean."
160,Short trip to Palermo,"Palermo is full of amazing architecture so if you want to see a bit different thing, then these Catacombs are definitely a must see.We had a city map and we decided to walk there from Massimo theater ( we skipped the shortcut and went through some main street, passing Quattro Canti, Palermo Cathedral and few beautiful parks. Very easy and touristic walk ( around 3 km ) Once you reach to the Cappuccini street, just walk straight on that street until you see the Catacombs signs, nothing complicated and easy to find.It's open 9.00 - 12.30, then they have a siesta and they open again 15.00 - 17.30Walk inside is very interesting, it's well lighted and you can see everything close.The halls are divided into categories that include: Men, Women, Virgins, Children, Priests, Monks, and Professors.Most accounts report that 8,000 bodies were interred in the catacombs, but it is unclear how many remain today and what happened to the rest. Some reports indicate that only 2,000 or so bodies are now exhibited.What happened to the others? One author wrote: ""American troops removed and carried them off as souvenirs"" during World War II. I do not know if this is true. Another author indicated that Allied bombing during World War II damaged the catacombs and destroyed many of the bodies interred there.One of the last bodies laid to rest in the Catacombs was Rosalia Lombardo. Her preserved corpse is the most famous of the 8,000 bodies once found in the catacombs. Only two years old when she died on December 6, 1920, apparently of a bronchial infection, Rosalia has gained fame because of the excellent preservation of her body. She is often referred to as ""The Sleeping Beauty.""Definitely worth a visit and you should keep in mind that all those mummies who are there, wanted to be there ( The catacombs were maintained through the donations of the relatives of the deceased. Each new body was placed in a temporary niche and later placed into a more permanent place. As long as the contributions continued, the body remained in its proper place but when the relatives did not send money any more, the body was put aside on a shelf until they resumed payment. ) so don't feel bad in any way to ""disturb"" their last resting place.It's interesting, educational and I didnt feel anything bad inside there, also the air was very clear."
161,Not the sort of thing you get to see every day.,Catacombs are simply extraordinary ! We were expecting skulls and bones alignment and we have discovered an incredible place where you can see very well preserved bodies with their original clothes (oldest dates from 16th century). It is normally forbidden to take  picture in the catacomb but there are few on Tripadvisor...Take a look before going with kids !
162,Worth to see but not exactly what I thought it would be,"Won't see stuff like this back in the States. Yes, creepy, but the history of why and what is something to see. The monks did a great job in preserving history of the past. Do not take pictures...they will he'll at you if caught lol."
163,It was eye opening and educational,We took 2 buses to get there from the train station and paid a very reasonable ‚Ç¨3 entrance each. No photogralhy or videography allowed as a mark of respect to the dead. A haunting and memorable experience. The natural mumification process was fascinating to read about on their website prior to entry.
164,Very morbid,Interesting place to visit - creepy but fascinating to see! Doesn't take that long to go around the entire exhibition maybe 30minutes at most. Not a far walk from the Palazzo Reale.
165,"Eery, morbid and well worth a visit ","Little place, we walked there from the City centre and it was maybe 3-4 kilometres away. Nice little walk, make sure you have water. The place is closed during the siesta (13-15), we were there just before it opened again and were among the first people going there. Because the place is small the capacity to take people in it is limited, when we were walking out we heard the ticket saler yelling that people outside have to wait a little longer, place is crowded. There is no shady place to wait and stay in the line at the same time, felt sorry for the old people who had to stand in the burning sun.There is human skeletons dressed in clothes they used to wear, hanging up on the walls or some are layed in the coffins. The most chills you get is from the child skeletons who look right in to you eyes. The place is under the ground, so it is chiller there at lot than the outside, take a long sleeve or scarf to put around you if you like it warmer.Like the place becouse of the low cost and easy access."
166,Not interesting ,Very interesting but sacred repository of the deceased. Some most incredibly preserved by the atmosphere of the crypt; even dressed in original clothing.However left the place not entirely sure as to the purpose of the display and whether it was a customary place of worship of the dead by relatives in that era.
167,Macabre but interesting ,This place is truly amazing and an insight  to the past. Very interesting  experience.  Iam very pleased  my Fiance and  myself  paid  a visit. Nicholas  Jewell
168,Unique experience ,This is a difficult place to review as it is not the average tourist attraction but i have to say it was one of the most memorable that i have ever been to. It is a powerful place to go and really can evoke a lot of feelings as you walk around. It is quite something and i think different people would have very different opinions about the place but for me i would have to say it was  very much worth going to and would recommend.
169,So special,Not for kids!!! Such a weird place. Dead bodies dressed and exhibited for everyone to see. For 3‚Ç¨ you really should check it out if you have the stomach for it...
170,What an experience!,"We were using the Palermo sightseeing bus and hopped on and off a few times, this particular attraction showed as being a short walk from stop 7...it was at least 20minutes in the opposite direction and you get there via a street with virtually no pavement, so be careful. There are no signs to point you there either, you just have to follow your sense of direction. We got there at 1:30, it's closed from 1pm-3pm, so we were left with no option other than to wait. Luckily there is a cafe nearby and we waited. It was ‚Ç¨3 each to go in and a further ‚Ç¨3 for a guide book with pictures as you can't take any photos. One word of warning to most woman with any kind of motherly instinct-DO NOT LOOK AT THE CHILDREN SECTION. There are babies only a month or so old and it really affected me and a couple of the other ladies I saw looking. Even my husband was a bit affected by that. The rest of it was very interesting and worth a visit but the babies are just lying there rotting."
171,Going back in time,"Not necessarily a ""must see,"" but an experience. I have know about them for decades but just went to visit."
172,Macabre as expected,"I was at first nervous thinking about this place but when inside everything seemed so normal.  The status of being placed in the catacombes is a prestigious one, but it did seem intrusive peering at dead faces and clothes.  I feel fine to have visited and although a personal choice, one that I found comforting as death is part of life.Our daughter also joined us. It really is not much different from Egyptian mummies and other types of burial sites."
173,Haunting,"Very disappointed, after visiting the catacombes in Naples and the underground attraction in Naples we expected something better. The skeletons are dressed in dated clothing and are stuffed with STRAW too fill out the body shapes. This looks odd and not authentic. It's takes about 20 minutes to shuffle along the walkways to look at a repeat of what you are continually seeing. It's something to do on a quiet afternoon but is a long, steep walk from the town centre"
174,An odd experience,"highly recommended if you are daring and curious. You were alone underground, surrounded by thousands of corpses wearing clothes. The little girl looked just like a doll. It's awesome!"
175,Morbidly interesting,"This was recommended in our Sicily guide and as we were staying in Palermo, we decided to go. One of the strangest places I have ever seen. I suggest you do an internet search to find out more about it before you go, so you won't be shocked. There was a small charge and as usual it closed over lunch time. Basically the remains of the capuchin monks are on display as bones artistically arranged. The overall impression is macabre, yet suprisingly I wasn't too shocked. Not sure I would go again, or even recommend, but maybe it is worth seeing if you have a spare hour to kill."
176,Macabre but facinating.,"A rather haunting experience, but I'd do it again. The entry is only ‚Ç¨3 and the size of the collection is very impressive. Surely a thing to remember and reflect upon."
177,Bizarre but  Worth a Visit,"In my travelguide was written that you could see the Catacombe dei Cappuccini as a tourist attraction, where you could met whole families, inculding children enjoying eating an ice cream, watching the thousands of dead people.Nothing of that. I was there at 09.30 am and it was just me with all the bodies lying and standing on and at the walls in the corridors.Some of the bodies disrespectful tied up with a piece of iron wire.Walking around, it was remarkable to see how different the bodies look, some peaceful some others like crying out of pain, like the the Scream of Edvard Munch. Most impressive for me was the well preserved body of the two year old Rosalia Lombardo.I have to be honest, because of the fact that I was the only visitor, I wasn't really relaxed.On a certain moment I got a bit scared of my own footsteps and speeded up a bit:).At the moment  I heard a little swish, I thought that a body would come of the wall and that was enough for me.Right to the exit and time for a double espresso:)."
178,Interesting Visit - Needs to Provide Information ,"So very interesting! O good history lesson but ever so chilling! artistic bones is not something i thought i would experience but wow. very good but very odd, worth a visit."
179,Interesting,"One keeps wondering ""Why?"".  It is so peculiar and morbid, like no other place I have been.  Hundreds of dressed up mummies, essentially, from 1860's to about 1920's."
180,A rare sight...,"We looked at some of the tours offered then just googled it to learn as much as we wanted/needed to know and then just paid the 3 Euro/person entrance fee and went through. Frankly, a tour would have kept us down there longer than we needed to stay. It‚Äôs very macabre and certainly gives North Americans like us a different perspective on death. We took the 30-40 minute walk from via Ruggero Settimo through Capo district that took us through the fish/vegetable market which was a bonus. Walked back down via Cappuccini and Corso to Palazzo Conte Federico which is also a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù."
181,Not for the faint hearted ,I have rated this as very good because it is so extraordinary and really rather creepy. Having visited catacombs in Rome and now in Palermo I feel that I have seen enough!
182,Impressive!,"Its not the ""politically correct"" site for manistream tourism. I found it very interesting though. Even the word catacombes brings to mind something very subterranean this site is def not. Its a big basement with ""storing"" any kind of human skull. Its like a huge art installation. Really worth seeing."
183,Eerie but fascinating,"One of the objects in which not all the tourists would like to go. If you want to feel the impermanence of life and death beside myself - visit. Do not take pictures and record videos. But do not. Religious and other human remains relatively well preserved.It's hard to find parking covering the day, but here undocumented local service for you for 3 euros to find a spot on the entrance to the catacombs and custodial car. It is worth to trust them, do not spare the money."
184,Dark Tourism,"It's a unique place and I think you must see even if you think that it's disgusting. There's not many places in the world like this and it's worth to visit. Those corpses, sceletons, mummies. The first priest was graved there in 1599. Can you imagine: you will see the body of person who died more that 400 years ago! And the mummy of the little Rosalia is just amazing (if you can say so)."
185,Macabre,"This is one place you MUST visit!Words cannot express the uniqueness of this place...Go go goAnd no it doesnt smell!It's quite far, 30-40 minute walk from the centreBut worth it"
186,Worth to see,"Thanks to my friend who took me there, this place is not on my guide book so I basically didn't know what to expect before I actually went down. This is not a luxurious place but for the purpose it serves it is good enough: the bodies are classified with clear signage; the place doesn't stink at all.  Well might be they could have erected more signs to tell the stories but it's OK without. Now, 2 weeks after my vacation I am still thinking about the place, this has become my #1 favourite in Italy."
187,Interesting,"We track down ossuaries and bone crypts across Europe (still have many to do!). These catacombs are amongst the best. So many mummies on display. No photos allowed (although that doesn't seem to stop loads ending up on Instagram).  Well worth a visit if you're into the obscure,‚Ä¶"
188,Strange ,"What an amazing experience.  I had heard it was not for everyone - too bad - It was fascinating.  The clothing hanging on the desiccated bodies were as beautiful as paintings.  One could almost see what the dead had looked like when alive - in all their similarities and and their differences.It was a special place.  A couple was celebrating their wedding just outside of the crypt.  Not a sad, creepy place - but an opportunity to visit people from past centuries - so like ourselves."
189,My first time to see Catacombs!,"Really awesome, and educational experience. I thought it was going to be scary, nevertheless it was an amazing experience."
190,"Fascinating, spooky but a must!","This is one of the strangest places you will ever have been to, it's a real must do event if you have a couple of hours to spare in Palermo! Enjoy!Not for kids/young children as you will be walking around rooms full of dead bodies in various stages of 'decomposition'......."
191,Interesting,"After eventually finding this place (I walked) it was closed.  Yes, that's the kinda luck I run...anyway, at least I know how to get here and it's opening hours for the next time I visit Palermo which I really liked by the way.Can only give this an average due to the fact I didn't get inside.  Did have a wander around the cemetery next to it though."
192,Interesting place,Worth the twenty-minute walk out of the city centre to visit this unique experience. It's just 3‚Ç¨ to visit and spend forty minutes exploring the history of the city through the people that used to live there.
193,Macabre but worth a visit,"Other cultivated visitors expressed already concerns and I would echo some. Interior ist not really protected against light, dust, dirt, flashlights and touchy fingers. I wonder why no aircondition is preventing the atmosphere to destroy the fascinating relicts. Double the entry and take care of this gem ! Really interesting to see the different levels of conservation, clothing or other aspects of the dead. The regular cemetery is also fascinating with all its mini temples."
194,Well worth a visit if you like the macabre ,"Always wanted to see it since watching an episode about it on NG. It exceeded my expectations. It is what it is, nothing more nothing less. A must see if you are into an unusual things or rare things for that matter. I had young children with me too, and with prior explanation they handled it very well (no post nightmares)."
195,Not for fainthearted,"A creepy place completely abandoned to itself! No explanations, no flyers or guide able to let you understand why the place exists and its history! Ah, of course you can‚Äôt take any pictures but you can buy their posta cards set! The frati must be very proud of how they got exploited by their own community!"
196,Too creepy ,Worth the visit if you want to see what happens to the human body after death. Interesting tour under the ground in semi dark around 100's years old bodies.
197,Creepy,It is the one of most impressive places to visit. This collection of mummified bodies does not seem very strange or fearful. I was touched to see a small girl of two years to be embalmed.
198,Interesting experience ,People you have to visit this place is jest stunning i never see in my life something like this its jest wow 3 euros entrance  also outside beautifulle cemetery so peaceful.   Worthing to visit cotocombo dei cappuccini
199,Creepy with no reason,"Both interesting and a little creepy. Not sure how valid many of these are, as there is no audio tour nor any information in the catacombs to explain. Essentially, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a bunch of skeletons, enjoy‚Äù kind of thing. I wish I knew more about many of the halls, but I can do that reach online I guess."
200,Worth a visit,"I found this visit to be very interesting and quite different from what I‚Äôve seen in my travels, but lacked in providing information; there‚Äôs very little signage and what exists is in Italian only. Do your research beforehand in order to get more out of your visit, but do go as long as the subject matter doesn‚Äôt disturb anyone in your party or young children. Also of note, there‚Äôs a lovely cemetery on the same property."
201,Preserved corpses of monks,"Went with some friends when I was visiting Sicliy an boy was it a cool experience. I'm really into the health science's and history so this kind of trip sort of tied those two interest together. Was something that you more than likely will not see anywhere else.You have to be into history and science to be into this sort of stuff. If you cringe at the thought of bones and skeleton then this place is not for you because that is literally what you will see, and its underground if that makes a difference. But it is kid friendly and not scary by any means(had no idea what to expect)."
202,creepy interesting,"Need to see this! It is a bit disturbing, but once you read about the medical advances this group of monks was responsible for it was incredible. The catacombs are a bit macabre, but when you understand it is a perspective of death, then it is really cool."
203,Excellent Catacombe,I've been there 2 times and I'd like to visit it again.The only pity is that it's forbidden to take pictures there.Opening hours: from Monday to Saturday 9.00am to 1.00pm; from 3.00 pm to 5.00 p.m.Sunday and holidays: 9.00am to 1.00pm.da Luned√¨ a Sabato dalle ore 9 alle 13 e dalle ore 15 alle 17.la  Domenica e festivi dalle ore 9 alle 13
204,Death From All Sides,"A visit to this highly unusual Palermo attraction is really something special although it must be said that it is very creepy and would probably give children under the age of ten very bad nightmares. On the other hand I guess Grand Theft Auto has rendered many of the youth of today immune to most things so make your own mind up as to the need for guidance!Entrance is only a few Euros and after you have bought your ticket you wander off down some stone stairs into a strange labyrinth of corridors just about underground, but large windows at pavement level let a lot of light in so it is not a gloomy place by any means. And then you spot your first mummy... all along the corridors they stand - or rather are wired up - in the standing position in individual niches. From what we could glean by ear-wigging the spiel from some of the tour guides the mummies first interred in these catacombs were monks from the adjacent Capuchin Monastery but eventually ordinary folk who could afford the process began to be interred there as well. The soft tissue of the deceased was removed from their bodies by immersion in quick lime but their heads and often times their hands were preserved with arsensic. The bones were placed in the correct position inside hessian sacking which was sewn up to form a human shape and finally the ""body"" was dressed in the former owner's choice of Sunday best. The by now pickled/preserved head was re-attached to the neck and he/she was allocated a niche. Some were interred lying down, and a very few were interred in conventional coffins with a tiny glazed peep hole for the deceased relatives to view the body through and to afford them access to chat about the week's events, for visiting their dead family was apparently very important. Eventually mummification and internment in the catacombs became so popular that the balance of monks/commoners shifted massively to the point where there now appears to be far fewer monks than ordinary people. This practise was continued from around the early 1700s until the last internment in about 1918 - a little girl related to the family who carried out the mummifications has pride of place. She is so well preserved that her immediate family would recognise her if they weren't also pushing up daisies by now. My particular favourite was a soldier resplendent in a Napoleonic war period costume complete with bicorn hat! Many of the mummies are now little more than grinning, gap-toothed skulls totally devoid of flesh but occasionally you find one that is still a recognisable human being, so well have their features survived.Photography is strictly forbidden in the catacombs which I find a little odd in view of the fact that these people clearly wished to be seen and recognised after their death to the point where they saved up vast sums beforehand to ensure that would be the case!If a tour coach has just arrived - and there were two the day we visited which was actually just before the start of the tourist season - then I would recommend you wander around the adjacent cemetery for a little while first because it is a little cramped down below, though if it is really busy I'm afraid you'll just have to put up and shut up.See if you can spot the ones we named ""Thriller"" and ""Uncle Fester""..."
205,Very unusual place,"something right out of hitchcock--you may not want to take the tiny ones here.  site mirrors the painting the triumph of death in the regional gallery.  if you've seen the likes before elsewhere, there is nothing new here, though."
206,good but sad,"Extremely fascinating, however this is not for everyone as some of the ""items"" on display can be a little disturbing or even creepy. Not for persons who are susceptible to bad dreams."
207,Unforgettable experience ,"Decided to walk from our BB near the Marina not one off our best decisions.when we eventually found the catacombs we were surprised by its location and the surrounding area, run down best describes it. We found it interesting and macabre in a strange way. Some of the body's were in excellent condition and looking at the clothes they had been buried in made it real.the two admirals in there uniforms are  interesting.all in all a visit that we were glad we did. Very much like Palermo rough around the edges once your used to its waysYou get a better understanding of Palermo.as you can see the photos show the Catacombs, hope you visit."
208,Creepy,"Really liked the place and only went to Palermo to visit this corpse museum. After having visited the Paris catacombs I chose this one as my next destination.If you are on the stranger and creepier side of the things you should definitely take your chance and visit this place. It's a museum of clergy mummies and citizens from Italy from around the 14 th century.Some of the corpses and preserved in a quite good condition as are the clothes. The best attraction of the museum is the little body of Rosalia Lombardo, a girl of only two years who died of pneumonia. She still gives the impression that she is only sleeping which can be creepy for impressionable folks.The catacombs contain around 8000 mummies so pick your choice."
209,Disappointing visit ,"The catacombes are quite far from the city center so you may consider this if you want to walk in summer.The price is 3 euros and you are NOT allowed to take pictures, so I wonder how these images got into Tripadvisor:)))It s weird and not for sensitive souls but also not scary so just do it. It s one of the things that you have to have on your to do list. Afterwards buy some oranes from the stand on the other side."
210,It‚Äôs an odd ‚Äúattraction‚Äù - equally fascinating and macabre ,Very different from other burial spots around the world. It's divided into sections that makes it unique e.g.   Male v Female. Virgins v Priests. It's quote haunting.
211,Astonishing!!!! ,"This place must be seen when you are in Palermo, here are the hundreds of mummies in all ages and qualities.To us it seemed the whole tradition  weird that dead people have been hung on the wall. This place is not recommended for small children and people with bad nerves and stomach.We were surprised at how large this place was, and the number of mummies.Entrance fee: EUR 3, - No discount for children / youth or senior citizens."
212,Must see point on Palermo map,"Morbid. Amazing to see the catacombs, it's worth a visit just for the novel experience. Very morbid though, some of the corpses still have intact faces. The main 'attraction' is the intact body of a dead baby. Pretty creepy.Historically the bodies range from the late 16th century to early 20th when the practice presumably stopped. It's arranged by profession."
213,Not sure what to say....,Seriously not worthy. I don't think is managed by someone from the Soprintendenza. The feel i got was that they are exploiting the place to make money in a very disrespectful way. They don't let tourists to take pictures of the dead because it is a cemetery and they say is disrespectful but they don't explain anything about the catacombs and why people decided to buried their dears like that. Beside the place is very dirty and not at all well preserved! The corpses are falling apart and they are not inside a glass boxes which should control temperature and humidity. Going like this they will be destroyed very soon. I think this is disrespect!!
214,Not much to see,"The Catacombs is a very special place in Palermo. It's interesting and in my oppinion really horror.If you are one who likes scary things, go there. If not, you better choose to visit something else."
215,"Interesting place , not underground  as some catacombs you can still see light .",This was an interesting if very somber experience. It's interesting to see how different the monks attitude was to death as well as other people that followed their example of having the bodies of their loved ones embalmed so they could be visiting and seen any time. Thought provoking
216,Something a little different.,"This was quite an adventure to get to....however it was worth it. It is the marked like a tourist attraction, but it was awesome. Some of the skeletons even had hair. It was freaky...but so interesting to read about the origins or see the dressing of those buried. Not to be missed!"
217,Yes Visit...but set your expecations carefully.,"Yes, it is weird looking at hundreds of mummified bodies. But, it is also very interesting. To think of why this was done and how. The bodies are in different stages of decay; some just bone and some with skin and hair. There are men, women, and children. It was difficult for me as a mom to see the babies. There are also whole families preserved together in this crypt. I agree that it is not for the faint at heart. But, I brought my 13 year old daughter and she found it very intriguing. Mostly, this is a neat little lesson in history with an inexpensive donation to the monks."
218,This place is Dead!,So this is not one for the light hearted. It gives you an interesting insight into the history of the city by effectively confronting you with the remains of it's former inhabitants. I would put this on my low priority list in the future though as some of the other sites are far more spectacular.
219,Grim. Death at its least dignified. Corpses looked like guys and could give children nightmares.,So I have been to many catacombs across Europe.  They tend to be a little creepy but interesting at the same time.  The Capuchin Catacomb is possibly one of the creepiest places I have ever been.  It is massive and contains rows upon rows of remains - which vary from lonely skulls to skeletons to unusually well preserved bodies. Most of the remains are dressed in their burial clothing which adds a poignancy to the experience.  It isn't distasteful or tacky; it was a fairly solemn visit.  None of my review is to turn people off from seeing this - but it is illuminate that this isn't a halloween exhibit.
220,Very interesting place to visit,"If like the mummy, inside the only perfect mummy in the world, the processing of mummy is amazing !!!"
221,"Perhaps unique history, walking among uniquely buried dead",Interesting in a historical point of view but not suitable for small children as I found it a bit full on skeleton after skeleton all dressed and very ghoulish ! Just wantedto get out .
222,Deadly beautiful,"Certainly this place is unique but it is really rather grim. As so many people have remarked these were real people and I am amazed that there are visitors with small children here. I have been here twice, first time as it was said to be a Must See and the second time travelling with my brother who wanted to go inside. Would not want to return. Also the no photography inside is a bit wierd as outside they sell photos and skulls etc. Really rather yucky the whole thing"
223,It's not for me,A little unique place . Must be seen . A little difficult for kids may be ... But for a  unique experience and make you realize you are not here for ever
224,Interesting ,"I was very excited to see this place, I found it here on TripAdvisor and I was looking forward to it as it‚Äôs something extraordinary and rare. I was surprised, there were much more dead bodies than I expected and closer than I thought. Even though you are not allowed to touch it (not as you would like to), you would be able to do it without any problem, that‚Äôs how close to you it is from both sides. It is definitely NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN!"
225,Wow something to see,The site does not have any explanatory signs which is a shame but it is still worth a visit especially as you can read up on it prior to visiting. 30 mins is more than enough to roam around - pictures aren't allowed
226,Unique Burial Spectacle ,"Interesting , worth a visit for 3euros per adult. Left feeling like I‚Äôd been in a wax work type horror section but knew it was real and I‚Äôd been looking at dead bodies and loads of skeletons in coffins etc. Doesn‚Äôt smell which was good however my partner had a touch of wind which may have confused others walking near us üëçüèº"
227,Fascinating ,I went to this site without having read about it and expected it to be like the roman ones which have remains of people from ancient times.The one in Palermo has mostly recent dead bodies presented poorly with little information available. The site is not well maintained either and the visit was completely disappointing.A 3 euro charge is made for the visit and photographs are not permitted.
228,Bizzare and fascinating experience,"This was fascinating and worth a visit, but surprised that some people took their kids.  Looking at the kids they were terrified as you could imagine with all the dead bodies hung on the walls."
229,Scary and Creepy!,"I've never seen anything quite like this. Definitely worth a visit. Only 3‚Ç¨, won't take more than 15-20 minutes to browse, the cemetery and church were also nice. A bit outside of town, the walk from the north gate was 15 minutes of sweating, but worth it."
230,Freaky and awesome,"Was a little wary about taking my 6 year old and was sure to check with her bt viewing some images prior to our visit. I think we all have some curiosity around death to varying degrees and this place offers something quite rare. We had visited catacombs of Naples but there were no bodies there. Here there are hundreds.I was not shocked or disturbed as I had prepared myself, and daughter six, unperturbed. We took a healthy curiosity with us.Partcularly interesting is the garments of the women, and costume of the day. As well, the corpses that were better preserved...fascinating. For ‚Ç¨3, the catacombs make for variety on the sightseeing itinerary."
231,CREEPY,Probably not for everyone. The deceased are respectfully displayed and it is quite interesting to roam the corridors. Nearby outside there is a beautiful cemetery with gorgeous stonework to admire.
232,Creepy yet sad,"Unique site, a must-see, hard to describe unless you actually visit it - scary in the same time. Didn't like disrespectful people kept trying to photograph although the tour guide kept insisting this was not allowed."
233,Extraordinary place,"There is no photography allowed here so be sure to take it all in.    This catacomb was located next to a church and a graveyard site.   There were a few stairs that you had to go up and down in order to get to the catacombs.  Our tour guide explained how and why these bodies were preserved and told us a little bit about some of the people who were there.  The preservation of these shells we call, bodies, was so amazing."
234,An extraordinary place,"The location is a good 45 minutes walk from the train station. This is an unusual attraction. To my surprise it did not smell unpleasant at all. Found it interesting the clothes that the mummies were dressed in, representing different time periods. The could be more information provided, there didn't seem to be any booklets in English. Worth a visit."
235,Macabre but very interesting,I have been to different catacombs and this one was different in that all the skeletons were dressed. I went with my 9 yo daughter and it was not too creepy for her.
236,Interesting but...,"Don;t visit if you have a weak hearth. Not to see everywhere idea for life after, which have been emerging here in Sicily to the beginning of the 20th century. Along with the unusual scene you should be prepared to go through the most underground districts of Palermo to get there!"
237,A peculiar experience,"This place will not be to everyone's taste,facinating , interesting,even creepy, to be allowed to see these bodies displayed for all to  see may seem wrong ,but obviously to the monks and the local people who were allowed to be interned here was a final honour.for me and my wife was one of the best sights we saw in Palermo,which in itself sounds wrong"
238,Wow,"A very unique experience.  I am not aware of any other catacombs that have been used up until the mid 20thC, and the fact that all the bodies are in original clothing is all the more fascinating.  For just 3 Euros entrance fee this is a very worthwhile visit."
239,Interesting but non-personal,"Went with my wife, 2 teenage sons, and parents in law. First 10 minutes were interesting, rest was just creepy. I left early with my younger son and mother in law who were both done after 5 minutes. OK to skip"
240,Absolutely unique place,"Very interesting to see with a totally different approach. Although I don't normally like this type of place of interest, I found it amazing how this was created."
241,Catacombe dei Cappucclni.,"The catacombs are about a 30 minute walk from the city centre, I followed directions on my phone and it brought me down some pretty dodgy areas! It was ‚Ç¨3 into the catacombs and I paid ‚Ç¨2 for a booklet in English explaining somethings about them - a good idea as there is no information in English inside. It was interesting, if not a little grim, to see all of the dead bodies just hanging there. Worth a visit if in Palermo and you're not too squirmish!"
242,A bizarre attraction.,"We were really excited to visit this place and walked a long way to reach it. It was interesting enough, where you go down to a big place filled with skeletons dressed in clothes, some hanging on the walls and others resting in coffins or boxes. It was unsettling at first but got boring really quick when you realize that it's all the same view all over with little to no details about the people being kept there. It might be a nice spooky visit for children (however not very small children which are easily scared), but just a mildly interesting visit for adults."
243,Not for everyone,"we walked from the centre of Palermo to the Catacombs, about at 40 minute walk.  Well work it because the corpses are dressed in their finest.   An amazing look at what people were wearing in the 1700 and 1800, a lot more colour and bold materials than one would expect."
244,Not scary at all.,"I do not understand why people consider this place as ""fascinating"". it is full of mummified cadavers hanging by the neck from the walls in what appears to be a basement of Capuchin's convent. Yes that was the tradition of these times not to bury people (I assume), but if you decide to visit, ask yourself a question - when you die, do you want to be put into the same conditions?"
245,Lots of dead bodies,"Absolutely amazing would definitely recommend sant rosalea is sureal so very interesting a must do visit when in Palermo, their is little stall outside were you can buy souvenirs"
246,Interesting ,"We were troubled by the many advices warning people not to visit this place with small children. After showing them some pictures however we eventually decided to visit this place with our 6 yo son and 3 yo daughter and both of them were very interested and intrigued by this place. For them it was definitely a highlight of our journey. If you prepare them well (ask them whether they want to go, tell them the truth and warn them that it may be a bit scary), they will most probably not be afraid but interested in learning more about this fascinating place. I am happy we went and that we followed our gut feeling."
247,Interesting but spooky,"Be prepared for a bit of a shock. I had not read too much prior to going but the narrow walls of the catacomb are layered with 5000 dead bodies some still with skin and hair mummified and dressed and posing. There is a 2 year old girl named Rosalie who was the last body in 1920 and she is fully preserved with skin, hair and apparently all her organs and brain. Amazing but not for the sensitive people. i was a bit upset."
248,Strange place but totally worth to visit,"Being around all the corpses dressed and posed is a bit on the creepy side. But, one cannot help looking at all the bodies, dates, stories if any"
249,Spooky and interesting,"Quite macabre. But if you can stomach it, it is fascinating and a unique experience. A one of a kind experience and place"
250,Humbling,"Well if you need a reminder of your own mortality this is the place to go!!!Loved the segregation...important people, children, doctors, virgins, yip they are all here!"
251,Catacombs--Remember You Will Die,"If you are visiting Palermo, one of the things that can be done in this city is visiting Catacombe dei Cappuccini. It is a strange place, has about 8000 mummies. I recommend you to read about this place before entering."
252,Lovers of Halloween would feel at home here,"One of the most unique attractions ever. Should not be missed. There truly is no way to explain this, you just have to go and see it for your self."
253,"Catacombs of the Capuchins, Sicily, Oct 2017","I loved the place, the atmosphere and its history. It is also fascinating to see how the people wanted to be dressed in death."
254,The Most Amazing Collection of dead people!,"It's an extraordinary expirience! Being here probably can't compare to any other attraction in the world, if there's any more of this kind at all. It's an utterly odd place, walking down the hallways where all of those bodies are exposed, and all covered with that specific kind of  smell, was an expirience that leaves the deepest impression... if you like this kind of things of course. We saw some people with small children there, which was a rare more odd thing than the Catacombs itself, but the kids stood it well. All in all, this is a really must see in Palermo and worth a long walk from city downtown, but only if you know and are prepared to what are you're going to see. Sincere recommend!"
255,Scary and mesmerizing ,"Dead bodies in wonderful dresses hanged at walls, uff it is a real stuff. I Strongly recommend not to bring your kids! ...and young girlfrendsüòÑ"
256,Unique visit but not for the squeamish,We visited the Catacombs  a morning during our stay to Palermo.The visit was lasted about an hour.Cheap ticket.It reminds you that life is short.Best part of it the little girl which it seems to sleep.
257,A must see,Poorly signposted so hard to find even on foot. Entire experience is something that has seen far better days and has not been maintained in spite of significant amounts of money being poured into it some years ago. Not worth the entrance fee.
258,Pretty creepy....,strange collection of mummified bodies could be a bit disconcerting for some but we enjoyed it never seen as many bodies together before NB all ages
259,Mummies and skeletons,Other cities have catacombs but most do not have bodies - these do.  There are suppose to be 8000 bodies mummified by the monks.  I did not count them but there were a lot!!   It is a bit macabre so not for those with week stomachs or very young children. I found the attraction different and interesting. There is a 2 year old (that died at the beginning of the 20th Century) who was very well preserved. The little girl  was especially memorable. E3 admission.
260,interesting visit,"Very impressive, made me think of how short life really is. A bit spooky though, definitely nothing for kids below 12 yrs. Parking spaces available at the Piazza dei Cappuccini, directly in front of the Catacombe dei Capuccini. Nice little restaurant 75m around the corner, friendly staff, food is ok, coffee is excellent:-)"
261,Really interesting but for how much longer ?,"There are no toilets or cappuccinos available.  Its lovely and cool down down down in there, buying the guide (E4)  is an idea if you want to have any info.  I just enjoyed looking at all the dead people. The kids will love this and just watch their shiny, arrogant, entitled faces sallow and quieten, when you explain to them that's really all they have to look forward to.  I loved it.  worth every Cent of 3Euro."
262,A real life haunted house,A really unusual place to visit. Some would find it disturbing but if you‚Äôre interested in memento mori it‚Äôs worth a wander round. I found it fascinating.
263,Quite astonishing very interesting but very creepy ,"A creepy and amazing tourist destination. A must on the Palermo itinerary.  Great to ""corpse"" watch and to see what they wore, how people were buried etc."
264,"European trip, Lisbon, Rome, Palermo ","I love old cemeteries right. I visit them every chance I get, mostly in Ireland.  This place will leave an impression because it's so, well, creepy. It's beyond creepy. I wasn't sorry when the visit was over. Who thought this idea up of leaving the bodies to mummify and on display? Oh well. Select this one carefully in your itinerary cos it may not suit everyone."
265,Great for a look,Is a must see objective if you visit Palermo just because is a unique kind of monument. Like a common mortuary mausoleum that describes the tradition of the ancient times. Not suitable for kids.  Creepy and could give nightmares if you a heart suffering.
266,how many dead people can you see.,"Not something I was expecting to do on my holiday, but surprisingly interesting. It's a bizar place with a lot skeletons in different stages of decay. Well preserved and sometimes shockingly realistic. Perhaps not the place to bring your children to, but certainly worth visiting!"
267,Breathtaking!,"It's quite easy to reach these catacombs although it is some distance from the centre.  It'll take you about an hour to walk from the centre of Palermo.  The bus going to Monreale from Palermo centre stops about 50m away, or if you're travelling by car there is a car park directly outside.The entrance is on the right hand side and entry is 3 euros, which is reasonable.  Inside you have hundreds of corpses in varying states of preservation.  The exhibits are up to 500 years old.  People young and old from numerous walks of life are here.  Some look peaceful, others look in agony, some are well dressed, others in rags.  The highlight is a couple of 2 year old girls lying in their glass coffins in near perfect condition.  No photos allowed but there is a good selection of postcards in the piazza.  Not for the faint-hearted or easily spooked.  For everyone else it's morbidly fascinating!"
268,Interesting and atmospheric ,"This is not for the faint hearted.  We went by taxi from the centre of Palermo and it took approx 15 minutes.  The taxi ride was an experience in itself!The bodies have a strange fascination.  Some of their original clothing is very interesting.  The star attraction is the perfectly preserved body of Rosalia Lombardo, who passed away in 1920, aged two.  Beautiful, impressive and confronting, she is very touching and well worth seeing.  Her embalmer did an amazing job.Recommended...with a few reservations."
269,A strange experience,It is the place that is not very well known and it is guite out from the centre. But it is worth visiting.You can see mummies in very well conditions and learn the history of different centuries there. people were very helpfull to show us where to go but there are no signs in the city and it makes it hard to find.
270,Creepy but fascinating ,"The catacombs was a very special experience. Seeing all the dead people, familyes and even premature born children was spectacular. The best kept body, Rosalita who  died only two years old and who still are in good condition was magic. Recommended place to visit when in Parlermo."
271,Unusual but worth a visit,"Very particular location, with hundreds of skeletons and mummified bodies. The ""sleeping girl"" is quite particular"
272,Interesting perspective on life and death,I definitely wanted to go to this place after reading the reviews and the descriptions.  There is certainly nothing like this in the United States.  I was fascinated by the displays and how old some of the preserved corpses were.  It doesn‚Äôt take long to walk through.  The cost is very reasonable.  at ‚Ç¨3.  Someone was taking flash pictures and they were admonished by a loudspeaker.
273,Creepy but compelling,"This is a great catacombs to visit.  It is amazing how well the bodies are preserved, right down to hair and skin still being on them.  It is a wonderful walk through history to look at the clothes of the time, the burial techniques. I would caution anyone from bringing small children unless they see pictures prior to going and feel comfortable.  It is a macabre place but it must be kept in mind that this is the way bodies were buried in their time.  Would highly recommend."
274,Fascinating,"just be prepared before it, for myself i was alone in the big alley and really it was very strange as some of the body looks like they are still alive!"
275,Exciting memorial Capuchins graveyard-Catacombs,"We had read the reviews and decided to go to this attraction. This is a good example of how society deals with death. Remains are located in different streets (men, women, professionals, children, clergy). Go in there with a sense of respect. This is not a peep show. No pictures. Some remains only have bones, others are mummified. Others sre stuffed with straw. Also look at the clothes. Mainly remains of the 19th century. Stuffy atmosphere, even if some of the windows are open. Quite different from the catacombs in Rome, the chapel of the bones in Evora. Interesting place to visit, putting in perspective one's own mortality."
276, Very interesting ,"This is not like any other catacombes I've ever seen or heard of ,8000 bodies,most hanging on walls in niches fully clothed, in various stages of decomposition (one small child from the 1920 looks as if just sleeping others look like uncle fester in the Adams family.earliest I saw was 1590 , not a visit for faint hearted,rooms of very young children in there baby nightdresses. The clothing is very interesting,uniforms,suits etc from 100 of years ago. This is still a religious house above and no photos are aloud, the entry fee is very small indeed"
277,Interesting visit,"After seeing a programme recently on TV decided to visit whilst on a cruise in the area. There is a little girl in a glass coffin 100 years old, who just looks like she is asleep, she is not a skeleton like nearly all the others."
278,Different! ,"I went to Sicily specifically to see the crypts and I was not disappointed! Very easy to find (and signposted off main road) plus I chose a hotel nearby (Palazzo Reale b&b) so my visit would be the first thing on the list! I actually saw Rolf Harris coming out of there earlier with his wife! Anyway there's a big parking lot, and some men were loitering there to 'help'park cars - you are somewhat obligated to give them some change as this is the thing they do in Palermo even though they don't work there officially... they aren't dangerous (probably small time mafia type) but probably better to give them some money than not! They were actually quite friendly when we asked for directions to Monreale...There's a little gift shop with a few post cards and things, signs saying 'no photography' however I had NO problem at all taking as many photos as I wanted, although I did try to avoid the security camera areas and I didn't flaunt my SLR camera around and kept it in the bag when walking by the guy at the entrance. These crypts were bigger than I expected and beyond amazing - you can get as close as you want to most of the bodies. I can't imagine anyone being scared or horrified by this, it's sooo interesting and beautiful even. You can stay as long as you want and browse, so I'd allow about an hour to see it all. There were only a handful of tourists but maybe its busier on weekends. My only complaint was the body of little Rosalia is now in an air tight glass case which is fairly impossible to photograph or see clearly,  but guess they want to keep her preserved as is... I just bought a pack of postcards on the way out to get some better views. I also wish they would open some of the coffins as there were quite alot shoved into shelves and piles, the forgotten ones... They don't really provide much information about the crypts, but I read up all about it before coming so I suggest you do the same. The few signs there are in Italian. Some bodies have the name and date died. Some are amazingly preserved with eyelashes, full heads of hair, teeth... and their clothes are fascinating to see. I can't recommend this place higher if you are interested in history, archaeology and the bizarre like I am! its amazing! I think kids would LOVE it!!! Even my boyfriend who didn't seem too interested to see this place was thrilled with it. I definitely plan to return and see it again and again, the best crypt in the world (though Paris is probably more mindblowing)."
279,Fascinatingly gruesome,Worth a visit to get an insight into the complex relationship that Sicilians have with death. Not for the faint hearted!
280,This is not everybody's cup of tea,"If your into looking at dead people hanging around your cellar this is the place to visit, in all honesty it is very interesting and a must if in the area.. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest taking kids as nightmares may follow."
281,Haunting!,"This is a place where the living meets the dead, with over 8000 bodies mummified and displayed. It is an unnerving experience to walk among them. The saddest part is looking at the children and babies who have died, especially the remains of Rosalia Lombardo who looks as if she is asleep, her remains so perfectly preserved."
282,Thrilling,"Strange place with lot's of sceletons... Not sure if it's a must-visit or has a real historic/educational/excursion value for the tourists, it's more about the 'weirdness' of the place than about anything else..."
283,Unique,"It was an unique experience visiting all those corpses hanging from the wall and in various other positions in these catacombes.They warn you that taking pictures is forbidden, but t.b.h. it doesnt seem like there is any actual enforcing of this rule going on.Some of the mummies have retained an impressive state of conservation.You walk past an impressive collection of different looking corpses at touching distance (not that i would recomend doing the latter).Most interesting experience ive had in Palermo."
284,Odd,"Catacombs are far from Palermo centre, use the bus or taxi if you absolutely want to see disturbing dusty skeletons hanging from the walls. I doubt that this is the way these people wanted to end up after death. Luckily the entry fee was only 3euros but this really isn't worth even that. Let alone the time spent walking there..."
285,Breathtaking ,"It was kind of creepy, but worth seeing while in Palermo. I am not into scary things, so probably my husband enjoyed it more than myself. Also, we got there 20 min prior to closing ( they take a break for one hour in the middle of the day), so no one waked with us to explain what we were looking at. I found out more once I got home and read about it. That was a bit of a downer, but overall it is pretty interesting."
286,Morbid,This place is full with dressed skeletons of people who cared about their importance in life as much as in their years after. Do not go there if this is your first time to see dead people or skeletons.
287,A must to be seen location,"If you're into this kind of attractions, this is a great place for you. Medium sized catacombs with a lot of interestingly morbid skeletons and mummies, and the famously well preserved body of Rosalia Lombardo, which is said to sometimes blink.It is totally worth the visit, and the price is quite accessible."
288,Wowza,Do a pre-read before visiting. We took a taxi to the place from our hotel (it seems taxi drivers in Palermo charge 20 euro to take you to a place or back). There was no crowd at the entrance and we visited with no hustle on a business day. It seemed there were parking places‚Ä¶
289,Not for the faint hearted,"These catacombs started in the sixteenth century. Unfortunately no photographs allowed. Entrance fee is ‚Ç¨3 per person, served by a monk. The place is full of skulls which are put onto straw bodies which are dressed in garments. Most skulls are in tact, some have a missing cheek‚Ä¶"
290,Worth Seeing,"The Capuchin monks have something similar in Rome, that we found interesting so had to visit the Catacombs in Palermo.  It is a little off the beaten path, certainly more than walking distance from most locations in central Palermo.  We stared walking from the Norman Palace, but caught a cheap ride.  There is a small entrance fee.  The catacombs are huge with old dead bodies everywhere.  Some are fully dressed.  Others are not.  No harm.  Just bones, just dem bones after all.  You could spend an hour there if you took time to see every ""exhibit"".   We had seen enough after about 20 minutes or so.  The Capuchin exhibit in Rome is smaller, but more artistic in display.One of the very last to be interred was Rosalia Lombardo who was years old, whose body is still remarkably intact thanks to a long lost embalming method.  You can‚Äôt get a very close look though."
291,Hard to review,"It is definitely worth to visit catacombs. We did not feel any disturbance or disgust - there are thousands of corpses in the condition of mummy or skeleton, these people have been dead since more than 100 years so no one expects to see dead bodies. It was weird trend to be buried this way but it is now rather touristic attraction than cemetery.There could be a queue and you need to pay entrance fee to the monk, no photos though."
292,WOW,We took a walk from the centre of Palermo and it took approx 30 minutes to get there it was nice to walk through the narrow roads and look at the architecture.Once at the catacombs we paid ‚Ç¨3 each and walked down to the dusty eerie display of mummified bodies of various ages and decay. Slightly unnerving and surreal to see mummified babies but interesting nevertheless.
293,Well worth a vist,"Having read the reviews prior, it was more or less as expected and worth the ‚Ç¨3. As others have said, the lack of information spoils it."
294,Must to see in Palermo,This is a fascinating place with hundreds of skeletons in their original burial clothes.  Not so much buried but hung up on hooks for eternity.
295,Cool place to visit.,"I expected better preserved bodies. Rooms without air conditioning, wet. Only bones and clothes are preserved. I thought it would be more impressive."
296,Absolutely terrifying ,It will be kinda eerie if you visit the catacomb alone. do go with a friend or in a group. It is old but very interesting and eerie. I kinda enjoy the visit. Its not your usual tourist attraction. Not for the faint hearted.
297,Horrible trip,"Not for the faint-hearted, but a very interesting experience. You can secretly snatch a photo or two."
298,A fantastic insight into an old and freaky tradition,"far from the city center and not too much to see, just burial place, not a lot of archaeological stricture or historical info. not recommended as tourist attraction"
299,Lots of corpses,"Probably another 20 + mins by foot.If you have difficulty walking,get a cab.The trip is worthwhile!Have never seen anything like it,ever!The mummies are all lined up and fully dressed......from Clerics,to Men and women and...children,even babies!All there in their best attire....for centuries.Very bizarre,...but absolutely fascinating.You cannot take your eyes off them!"
300,Very interesting and unique ,Well signed as a little way outside the city centre but easily walkable It was a shame that there was no information leaflet before going in. We checked out Wikipedia after viewing and the info was very interesting On entry the sight is quite shocking and quite creepy. It took quite a while to get used to the sight of the corpses staring at youThere are clear signs for no photos as this is a religious building and respect should be shown but unlike other premises this appeared to be roundly ignored and nothing was done to prevent the activities We did show respect and therefore no pictures
301,A different experience ,"Went here after seeing the advertising. Parking is difficult right outside and there are parking touts trying to get you to leave your car with them. Just go around the corner and there are plenty of free spaces to park. It costs ‚Ç¨3.00 to go in which is not dear. As you walk around the mummified bodies hanging from hooks on the wall and in caskets, it would be nice to have more information available to make the visit more worthwhile.  In any case, where else can you be surrounded by over 200 dead bodies. Very surreal experience !!"
302,A great chance to view life in a new light ,Not to everyone's liking but we found it interesting. Certainly different walking down the corridors or central passage looking at mummies standing and lying on shelves. One I bought a postcard of was from 1871. No photos allowed so we all had to leave our cameras on the bus. Worth a visit if you have time.
303,Nice experience - not much info,"This was one of the most unexpected travel joys I've ever had travelling. For generations families would come to the crypt in Palermo to dress their deceased loved ones. On one hand it's truly macabre; on the other, the feeling is one of respect and caring. Whatever your take, if you're ever in Palermo, visit the crypt. It's recently been covered by national Geographic ( Jan 2013)."
304,Place to meet your existential fear :),Not in many other place in the word you can face the death in this wayExperience to try. Unforgettable
305,Interesting,"I loved this place, it's not like most of the same type in the world. You stand as close as some centimetres to the mummies. The oldness of the place and evidence of no care to dust and clean, and the damp smell make the place horrifying. DO NOT MISS IT."
306,Bit spooky,"This is such an unique experience. To see real preserved corpses hanging from walls, still in the clothes they were buried in, sounds gruesome (and a warning that this may not be for some) but armed with an understanding of the historical context in which it was instigated, makes it all the more fascinating."
307,Incredible!!,Interesting spot to see. You get to see a bit of history.Closed mid-day and we didn't know so we waited outside for a while.
308,Interesting,"I visited the catacombs because my friends wanted to see them. There is a small entrance fee.It was interesting to see how the corpses were categorized, for instance, professionals, virgins, etc.I don't think I'd want to go back again. It is worth seeing once."
309,A Highly Unique Experience that will Remind you of Your Destiny,"We visited here in June 2016 and while it was creepy and somewhat interesting, it was mostly sad. While walking around and looking at bodies decaying and falling apart, I couldnt help but think it was a terrible way for any loved one to be. We all hope those we love are at peace in death and there was a sense that that wasnt the case."
310,interesting and creepy,"Very strange museum, showing how the capuccines preserved the dead people in the past. I have never seen another place like this.You have to decide for yourselves if this is a view you can handle (there are also childs exposed). The entrance fee is only 3 EUR so you can try and abord, if it's not something you like."
311,Incredible,"Walkable from town center. The corpses have dried in the cave-like conditions, the centerpiece being a young girl who died in 1920 -- she looks like a doll, dressed in her Sunday best. It is a bit creepy, but you won't see anything like this elsewhere. The last monk was interred in 1871, so many of the corpses are showing significant deterioration even with the protection of this special environment."
312,Creepy but interesting ,"Strange visit but is a one off, got to be seen to be beleived, not too creepy either. Did our visit from a cruise ship in port and so try to get a taxi from the port entrance to the Catacombes, haggle with the drivers as they want you to take a full tour...one way only should be around 10-15 euros and then allows you more time for the stroll back which is all downhill or flat. A visit only takes about 30-60 minutes and the walk back to the city centre takes about the same if you stroll, especially with all the great shops along the way with bargain prices on shoes and clothes! First part of the walk back is a run down area but was interesting, and we felt safe at all times, and with a small map downloaded from Google was so easy. Great city life to see."
313,Scary but quiet place,"Walk downstairs and you are immediately greeted but a long collection of corpses hanging on the walls. We found it interesting and certainly unique, more than other churches with similar collections. Would have benefitted from a small introduction to what this all meant and how‚Ä¶"
314,Interesting,"Very interesting to witness the mindset of people at the time, which seems to alien and creepy to us. It is small enough not to make you bored seeing yet more dead bodies and the detail of the clothing and different degrees of conservation makes every corpse very individual and worth of interest. A shame is not managed better because it'd be interesting to learn more about the practice of preserving dead people in this way and perhaps the stories behind each person. The 'no photo' policy is puzzling...they are happy to open AND charge money for the display of the corpses but not for people to take pictures on the grounds of 'respect'. So exploiting them commercially as objects is OK?"
315,Perturbing and Peaceful at the same time,"Fascinating - thrililng - a bit frigthening.See mummies of normal people, families (uncl, childen and babies), professionals, all in their original clothing, who were buried in the catacombs over the last centuries. Somy lying, some upright, some still with skin, some pure bones.... Basically, you walk between rows of dead people. An impressing memento mori!"
316,Very weird but characteristic of old Palermo,The mummies are really interesting but also a bit creepy. I wouldn¬¥t recomend them for (small) children or sensible persons.Speccially the baby girl is very impressive. The catacombs are quite big and after a while I had the sensation that I had already seen everything and that it was too much!  And of course photos are not allowed and everybody is making a photo footage...
317,Just creepy,We visited the catacomb but it is not for the faint hearted  It was weird and a once off experience for me  I did not understand the language but i recommend you get a tour guide to assist if this is on your bucket lust
318,Spooky but interesting ,"This place is quite special.Rows and rows of bodies very differently preserved. Some were mummified, others just dried up.At the beginning I was surprised as how close you can be to these bodies, you could touch them, hug them if you wished :) You can try guessing who these people were, according to their dress (well, it is easy to recognize a bishop, but how about the baker, shipman,...).It did not seem scary to us at all, just an introduction to a way this community chose to preserve their dead probably in order to be able to easier bring back the memories of moments with them.I appreciate this place to be opened to public, please treat it with respect.We walked to it from the Norman palace and it is not too far."
319,Worth a visit!,"Well, I have to confess that it wasn't the most beautiful place I have ever visited but it is interesting.Well preserved bodies."
320,Memento mori,"Possibly the strangest, most macbre tourist attraction we've ever heard of, nevermind visited. still talking about it nearly a week after we've been, considering we've also seen an opera, been up a volcano and visited ustica that's saying something. Definitely pay the 3‚Ç¨ to spend about 40mins down there. We won't go again, but would definitely recommend going once."
321,Must see,"Very interesting.  Something we had never seen.  While Catacombs sound creepy, I recommend doing it once in your life."
322,Extraordinary... But eerie,Very strange experience.Like a horror movie set. A good walk but worth it. Got the bus back into the city. Unforgetable.
323,Extraordinary ,"Dont expect any signs, explanations etc. and certainly not in English. Very, very regrettable.The famous Rosalia is embedded in a glass box which reflects light and is a bit dirty, so that it is near impossible to even get a glimpse.The most interesting thing are actually the clothes ie how people dressed a century back. Actually a lot better than today.If you travel by car, do not park right in front of the building, as you get harassed by a car protection racket. 50 cents to ""watch your car"" that is. Park a few hundred meters away.Overall, there is no real point visiting this place, I am afraid."
324,Macabre but fascinating,This place is unique to say the least. Try and visit when it first opens to avoid the coach trips.Avoid parking there as they have aggressive beggars who'll shout at you if you don't give them a euro to park in a public place.
325,Interesting,"At the request of my daughter who already knew of the Catacombe in Palermo , we accompanied her in Dec 2016. I was not very comfortable inside. The place is in a large basement of an ancient building. Areas are sectioned off into different centuries of death and different types of people. Some bodies are hanging on hooks and others are in a coffin. Bodies are well preserved and left here by their families from more than 200yrs ago. It is on display for tourists. Photos are not allowed inside the building out of respect for the departed and the remaining living relatives.The place is well maintained however dust has settled on the bodies and clothing which seems to be there for years.It was weird seeing all the bodies of little babies. It was a different , interesting but eerie experience. Its something I would only do once and never again."
326,Unusual experience but a must do! ,"Interesting to read all the varied reviews on the Cappuchins. It's not going to suit everybody but it's well worth experiencing this unique place. Yes it's strange. Anything to do with death is uncomfortable. Especially being able to view it as it is presented to us here. This was a different time with different ways of thinking & behaving and we probably won't see anything such as this place again. And as macabre as it is, you have to view it for its raison d'√™tre. And with respect. I think the one thing that actually did disturb me for their lack of respect/ ignorance? were the people who took photos on their phones etc..... Read up on the history & why it exists before you go & decide if it's something you want to experience or not It's a very interesting piece of history & place of rest."
327,Take It All In,"It's pretty hard to describe the uniqueness of these catacombs. The bodies even though they we mummified and somehow preserved they are dressed and ready to meet you. Sounds gross, but you'll enjoy it."
328,"Must visit, of you can stand it","Macabre and interesting.... Well worth a lppk , really makes you think, its a stark reminder of how short life is...."
329,"Weird, weird, weird","The place is generally interesting to see, but I would love to receive any historical background about this place, some  information about people buried here. The way it is now makes the place feel very non-personal, things you see don't stay in your mind. It is simply like this: you go in, watch a lot of corpses (that obviously look just the same) and you leave."
330,So fascinating!! ,"This is a very unusual site which has thousands of full skeletons, all properly dressed in period clothing. A lot of the skulls do not have normal expressionless faces ... they are in agony. The women in our group rushed out after less than a minute."
331,Creepy but worth to visit,"Very creepy, like the set of a horror movie. But very interesting. Over 100s of skeletons. If things like this don't bother you its a very different experience."
332,"Creepy, mysterious","We loved it here! take a taxi as it's about an hours walk out of the town centre, it's a fascinating experience and reasonable to get in! Well worth a visit"
333,Morbid but interesting ,Macabre and fascinating well worth a visit and like nowhere else I have been a must see in Palermo and something you won‚Äôt forget
334,Interesting visit,"This is a commercial undertaking: lots and lots of dead bodies but not authentic. Corpses more than 150 years dead with still some pretty good clothes on: as I said ""weird"". Nevertheless, if you have the time, go visit and be amazed.Think ""Thriller"" by Michael Jackson and you're on the right track. No moving parts though!!"
335,An unusual attraction,"This was an interesting sight but we had mixed feelings as it's sort of creepy but intriguing. The sheer volume of bones is unbelievable. The really weird part is the fact that they've even made the ""art"" frames and chandeliers out of the bones. It's expensive and you need to be covered up (no bare shoulders or thighs). There's no photo's allowed but well worth the visit if you're interested in religious history. Also not easy to find as we were looking for the Capuchins and it's actually called Catacombe dei Cappuccini. (Close to the Hard Rock Cafe)."
336,Very interesting,"This is a must see! Over 8000 bodies! They found this cemetery when they were renovating the church above. There is one baby girl ""sleeping beauty"" that died at age 2 in 1920 and her body is perfectly preserved. This attraction might not be for everyone. I throughly enjoyed it but my 21 year old daughter, not so much."
337,Eerie but absolutely worth seeing ,"This site is ok for most people. However i did see one weeping lady looking at the preserved child who is now better protected under glass.The most interesting aspect is the costumes of the period (unless your a dentist!). There is easy access and natural light from the windows above the corpses. You will need to follow your map carefully as there is one sign I saw facing in the wrong direction. There is supposedly 8,000 corpses but you will only see a few hundred. You enter the site on the far right of the square."
338,Very interesting.,It was an eerie feeling walking through. The tour was very informative and interesting. I know my wife and I had a strange feeling as we walked through. I would highly recommend making sure you are okay with seeing human remains displayed. It is very interesting but seeing this one tone in my life is enough.
339,Grisly!,"A bit of a walk from the central area, but worth it.  I am still not sure why one would want to be hung up and displayed after death, but then, there are lots of unanswered questions I have about other stuff.  There are no tour guides, and pretty much everything is in Italian, but the number of bodies and their age and condition will be enough for most people.  The body of a small girl, definitely the best preserved, was actually the work of a taxidermist!"
340,Creepy but Truly Interesting,"Remarkable site, outside of downtown Palermo.  We visited multiple catacombs in Sicily, but this is the only one with the residents still present.  A unique place to visit."
341,Not for the faint of heart,We made visiting the Catacombs a priority as we are from New Zealand and never seen anything like this beforeIt was not what we were expecting    Our overall impression was a tacky tourist attraction The mummies were mostly skeletons  with straw stuffing. It was interesting to see the clothing they were wearing but I would doubt the authenticity of some of it.   It seemed hugely disrespectful to put hooks through their  heads and hang them from a wall for people to look at.
342,world of the deceased,"These so called ""catacombs"" are made of several corridors with dead people hanging on walls. Skeletons or mummied dressed and hanged on the walls, less than 1 meter from you. Somehow it didn't feel right."
343,"Somewhat creepy, but well worth it",Life and death comes more realistic in this attraction. Impressive especially for teenagers. Definetely a must-see at Palermo.
344,Interesting place,"This is one of those places that it is fun to see, but also is a little poignant. The catacombs are filled with skeletons, shrouded and clothed- a bit like scarecrows.  They grin down and out on you from there shelves, hands crossed, heads turned- slightly disheveled from being removed from their caskets. There's much information about the remains, I have to say I felt my own mortality, and a but sorry for them disturbed from their immortal rest. That said it was a well attended site with lots of Italian and international visitors."
345,Not so creepy,"No idea what sick minds like this, it'a disgusting. Dangling dead bodies with still hair and rotten skin on the skulls. You even have a special part of the dungeon with dead children hanging on the walls. Enjoy."
346,Creepy but so cool,Wandering the mummified remains makes one wonder about one's own mortality and is a thought provoking place to visit.  Well worth it.
347,Worth the trip,Very different - 8000 mummified corpses on display - you won't see anything like this anywhere else in the world!
348,Weird but very good,Creepy but intriguing.  Well worth visiting.  Slightly out of town.  We took 20 mins to walk there.  There are buses.
349,Not a place for the faint,"I read about this is one of the most scary museum in the world. And it was so indeed.you should see here if you visit Palermo. Bodies were like as if they had just died. Their skin, hair and clothes were still intact."
350,Creepy!,"Visited the catacombs as part of an organised trip booked on board the Costa Serena . Firstly the trip was enjoyable because of the catacombs . The trip did take the party to other places of interest a number of different churches etc but if churches are not really your thing then perhaps I would recommend that you go into Palermo independently . The main reason for this is that the trip is quite expensive and often , especially out of season the mix of nationalities on the coach is often so wide and so varied that the tour guide has to repeat everything three or four times. I suppose this is fine if you want to play the game of recognising what you remember from school In different languages but it does become really tiresome after a while. All of this said the catacombs are really very interesting if not a little scary! Although the tour guide specifically says not to take photos out of respect there were still some disrespectful idiots doing so. Why can't people just behave accordingly . As mentioned by other reviewers there is the chance to buy the small books with all the pictures of what is inside . Failing that if you want to be reminded of the trip that's what a google search is for !"
351,Spooky and don't take kids.,"I have been to these catacombs twice and believe it one of the most interesting places in the world to visit. Firstly each of the bodies are dressed in the clothes that the individual wished to be mummified in, so you begin to see the occupation, taste and personality of those interred here. Secondly the mummification process and the state of the bodies is fascinating, there really is nowhere else in the world that really brings you face to face with your own mortality.For all of those saying that this disrespects the dead, it is exactly the opposite, the people here chose to be buried like this and it was part of 'their' religion not the viewers. However what IS disrespectful is taking pictures or joking as you tour the location as it is after all a solemn place of worship for some.While we were there a number of families brought their children around and there was no crying or screaming, just intelligent conversation between families, the kids were fascinated so if you have kids, i'd say bring them along and teach them about life and death.Out of our five week honeymoon, i believe this was one of the locations that holds the lasting memory for me, not to be missed!"
352,Weird,"Fascinating! A little tricky to find by the signage...ladies remember to bring something to cover your shoulders.A very different experience & hard to get your head around the skulls & remains being real, but one not to miss.Donations to preserve this amazing site are gratefully & graciously accepted."
353,Interesting but morbid,Everyone says to visit and half the party thought it worthwhile half disliked it. Yes its a set of mummies and they aren't Egyptian - not vampire material Do check the opening times at the lunch period as there is very little shade to wait/queue for ticket office. If timing is wrong there are 2 trattorias available quite close to the Porto Nuovo one on the road curving down the hill and the other at the start of the Cappucin but not much else in the area. You can also go to the Palazzo Ziso in the area it's another 800m away but closed Sunday pm
354,Unique visitor experience if a bit creepy!,"The Sicilian custom of placing the dead in a visiting chamber is not for everyone, so if you don't think you will like it please don't come and then complain! For us as anthropologists at heart it was however a fascinating glimpse at a heartfelt and respectful way of dealing with death which contrasts with the very British alternative of sweeping it under the carpet. We felt, in long conversations after, that the Sicilian way is more accepting of death and dying and probably much healthier. There is an odd mis-match in charging tourists to come and see and then asking them to be respectful by not taking photos (which people do anyway), but that does not affect the anthropological value of the visit. Our 15-year-old certainly felt that coming here was the single most educational feature of our holiday. On a previous trip we had visited the much smaller catacombs at Savoca, where the costumes from the centuries are better preserved, and we would also recommend that."
355,A must visit,Great change for the rest of Palermo's attractions and only a short walk from the centre. Very easy to find. Not too expensive and does not take too much of time to look around. Great place to scare the kids or even yourself. The creepiness will be sure to fill your dreams. A Palermo must.
356,Creepy ,"An amazing achievement , preserving the bodies ( some better than others ) only exceeded by the Egyptians . Quite an eerie place to be , but my curiosity was piqued by the programme on "" Rosalina "" a 2 year old little girl who died in 1920 & whose body is still virtually perfect . There are a total of 8,000 bodies but lots are skeletal , some in shrouds & some in their Sunday best  . At 3 Euros an interesting visit ."
357,Not for the Faint of Heart!,Extremely fascinating seeing all the skeletons! Something very different and we all found the trip very good and extremely unusual! Definitely recommend if your in the area.
358,not so great,"The catacombs are about 20-30 minutes walk from Palermo Port, but the location definitely worth the effort. The location is definitely something else and they way the visit went was just as this kind of location should be. A place where you need to act with respect and consideration towards the people that used to walk on this earth hundreds of years ago."
359,Never to be forgotten,"We were lucky enough to go with citywoders tours where our amazing guide, Barbara Kaminska not only gave a history but also the ""why"" a group would decorate with skeletons. I found it to be beautiful; a few others thought it strange or ""gross."""
360,'Dead Serious',If you love dried Italian salami or dried apricots you will love this tour.  Dried bodies dressed for a party.  Why not!
361,"It gives you a lot to think about, but it has a lot of untapped potential","We had seen this on Sicily Unpacked perhaps? my son (10) who is of a morbid dispostion was very keen to see the monks.  We arrived at 3, after a short walk from the historic centre to find a long queue waiting to go in. The entrance was just a few Euro.  One descends into the‚Ä¶"
362,Memorable ,This is something that you will either want to see or not.  I found it slightly demeaning to see all these remains.  I would not wish to visit it again.
363,Worth a visit!,"fascinating insight into catholic burial rituals from centuries ago up to 1920s. if you are not afraid to confront your own mortality then its worth a visit, lets face it, palermo has sod all else to do or see!!! you are very aware that you are not alone when down there."
364,macabre,"This experience is creepy but interesting as you get taken back into a different time, when beliefs about death and burial were more diverse and give us perspective on life back then and the history of the city . One needs to read about this before you go however as there's nothing in English I could see about the different skeletons. You can't complain however as the entrance fee was only 3 euros."
365,"If You Like Creepy, This Place is for You","Having visited other catacombs I though I was prepared for here, but I did not expect to see so many bodies so old and so well preserved (especially as the it is not particularly cold). I would have rated it 5 stars but there is little information given so I would suggest you read up on its history before or after your visit."
366,Did not like this tourist attraction at all!,"hidden off the beaten tourist track, this is an unusual site.  I wasn't sure how Id feel wandering around several hundred mummified remains.  It's eerie and peaceful at the same time.  Worth visiting."
367,The hours that are posted are WRONG!,"Been to Palermo many times, but somehow had never made it here, a little way out from the centre of Palermo past the Porta Nuova, then right up via Cappuccini.  ‚Ç¨3 and down some steps to find yourself with rows of mummified bodies.  One interesting one being that of the young child in a coffin, Rosalia Lombardo, who was I think the last person to have been laid here in 1920.  She was almost 2 when she died of pneumonia and is one of the best preserved bodies in the catacombs, and I'm told, British scientists have undertaken research on the body.  Admittedly I didn't linger but am now content that I have seen it."
368,Creepy but interesting,"You cannot believe this place.Hundreds of bodies fully clothed in different states of decay.All ages men,women,and children.Not for the squeamish."
369,Definitely something different.,"Well what can one say but simply the most creepy but interesting place we have ever visited. As ex-Archaeologists and a CSI this unique collection of mummies transcends everything. From a monk of 1599 to a two year old child. These mummies have eyes, hair and amazing preserved textiles. A must visit and the reason we came. It is quite a way out of the centre and worth paying ‚Ç¨15 Euros for a taxi ride. Entrance fee ‚Ç¨3 Euros. A simply must visit. This is the No. 1 attraction here."
370,Not for the faint hearted ,Definitely something different to see on a holiday though it was a little strange to be looking at so many skeletons. Various stages of mummification - some were a little frightening. Definitely worth a visit
371,You don't imagine that it's all true!!!!!,"This is quite unbelievable. You are literally looking at the remains of ancient people. Fascinating, a bit creepy, unique. Photos and videos are not allowed and there are cameras so if you disrespect the dead and try to photograph them ""Big Brother"" will ask you to stop over the PA."
372,Unexpected suprise,We recently went on a tour of the catacombs and found it very interesting and something quite different to any tours we had previously been involved on. It is certainly worth a visit as although it may be gruesome to some it is also fascinating for the history and culture behind it.
373,Must visit!!! Creepy place,"I came here twice. It was like nothing i have ever seen .. Even though i did visit catacombs before. Very well presented... So many mummies and skeletons of adults, kids and babies... Some of them - animated, others - peaceful. Id highly recommend a visit here.  Check times of operation as there is a loong lunch break in mid day."
374,Catacombs,We decided to visit these catacombs after an impressive write up in our tour guide. It was informative and sombre.
375,Outside the city centre but worth  seeing,"We walked here from our old town hotel, took a little finding and we arrived at 1pm without realising it shut for a few hours over dinner. No problem as the cafe nearby is great.Now it's hard to put in to words how someone else might feel viewing the people in here, it's certainly an interesting experience. Some of the clothes are so intact and they will have being there best clothes to be viewed by the relatives. I found it interesting but a little sad at same time. Little Rosalia is arguably the main attraction so to speak, having a 2yr old myself I found it a little difficult but she just looked liked a little doll that was asleep. Humbling to say the least"
376,Quite a different experience,"One of the most bizarre things we've seen.  Not explained very well, just dead body and skeleton one after another.  Standing up, some look they re having conversation.  Don't know who gets the money, but not much spent on providing a more informative experience for folks who buy a ticket.  Go if in the area, but I wouldn't frame an afternoon around it.  There is a small fruit veg market just outside and a very decent cafe (Splendour) on street leading to it."
377,Creepy but pretty cool,"This place is totally bizarre. I visited with my girlfriend who struggles to stay interested in museums/ galleries and the like.  The walls of the catacombs are completely filled with preserved dead bodies. It's quite eerie and creepy to walk around but also very very interesting.  Be warned, there are lots of bodies of children here which could certainly make people feel uncomfortable. The preservation is crazy with some of the corpses as old as 300 years still having hair skin and nails!The oldest one I made out was from 1599. Many of them are in the clothes that they would wear from day to day too which makes the whole experience even stranger."
378,Curious mausoleum,if you like macabre this is an interesting place to visit. it is very quirky and not distasteful....
379,Ghousish but extremely interesting,"Definitely took turns with husband to have the 5 year old wait outside. The bodies inside are definitely what the nightmares of children are made of, but with that said it was very cool.  The monk at the door was very nice.  It only takes 10 minutes to see it all, but is amazing how well preserved the people laid to reset here are. There clothing is amazing.  Not for the faint of heart though.  When bodies deteriorate they can look a bit like they are screaming."
380,City Wonders - Catacombs and Capuchins,"The catacombs of Cappuccins is a peculiar and interesting place to visit. You have to be prepared of the (rather) spooky view of dead people. There are more than 8000 mummified bodies since 1500 up to 1920 AD. If you are claustrophobic or if you are scared from the view of dead people, you have to rethink it (in advance)."
381,Not for the Faint of Heart,If you are going to visit this attraction be prepared to (i) see lots of dead bodies and (ii) be slightly disappointed given that state of the majority of them. They are frequently described as mummified bodies but frankly the majority of them are not much more than dressed skeletons in a dusty and badly lit set of corridors.  That doesn't take away that this is an odd and unusual attraction (and not expensive) but I had hoped to see a slightly more glamorous city of the dead......
382,Ok,This catacomb has a lot of dead people who died in the middle 1800s. When you walk by them you studied the clothing they used to wear. They do have one section for religious priests and monks that died during that time. If you do go must get there early in the morning before the tour guides get in there then it gets very crowded.
383,Visit with friends,More hundreds of mummified bodies can be seen here from all age. Very unique sanctuary place where only rich persons were buried.
384,An extraordinary journey into the heart of the seventeenth century -,"Didn‚Äôt know what to expect but was very impressed with the whole experience. The cadavers are in seperate sections according to their status, profession, sex and age. You enter and descend into the Catacombs  which are well presented if not a bit macabre."
385,Creepy and sometimes funny at the same time,Had to go back as fascinating in a macabre way !!It has the largest selection of mummies tracing back through Palermo society...Awesome a Big Must !!!
386,Haunting and worth a visit,"If you think you have pretty much done castles, cathedrals, etc to bits and want an attraction with a difference then head for these catacombs. There are dead corpses of monks, the wealthy, children and more, in dusty old clothing either lying or standing (leaning) against the walls. There are skulls and bones to be seen everwhere. It certainly gives you a bit of a shock when entering. No photographs are allowed, but lots of people ignored this and were openly taking photos!"
387,Very interesting,"The history is very interesting, the way it has preserved over time is fascinating and the way they are grouped.  I'd say worth a visit and only a few euro to get in. However, it is a place full of dead bodies, adult, children and babies so might not be for everyone."
388,Interesting and creepy both,"There are so many skeletons, it's unbelieveable. This place is unique so if you are in Palermo you should visit it. Never seen anything like this, it had something scary, sometimes funny but most of all impressive."
389,Beautifully presented Catacombs,"Never seen anything like it in my life.  Felt like visiting a Victorian freak show.  It is a fascinating tour of hundreds of centuries old dressed corpuses in a variety of states of decay and should be experienced ONCE if you are not too prone to nightmares!  The historic costumes are fascinating but its the corpses of fully dressed children that is the most distressing, beware."
390,Nothing special,"This is the most weird thing I have ever visited, skeltons everywhere fully clothed from children to adults.  I'm not entirely sure how to describe the feeling you get whilst you are there, it goes from ""why am I looking at skeletons"" to creepy to finding the costumes and various stages of decomposition interesting to thoughts of your own mortality.  Most definitely worth a visit though, we found it fascinating."
391,Fascinating slice of history,"I have to say it is disgusting, but it is the most interesting thig in Palermo. The entry is cheap, and worth the experience you will have. Human bodies laying in cofins or standing on the wall, and saying oh well I was so rich or famous that I can live now forever."
392,Really extrange place,"we went there, because i always hear about this  place since I was a childit s a very interesting place, someone told me that it was bigger but they closed a part.I think it s big enough to give you the feeling what could be in the past.I would not bring there children it s quite impressive and it s not right for themquite ""intense"" is the area with children.you can't take any photos inside.3 euros the tkts-"
393,Teenagers awed,"Go early, we went for opening time and had the catacombs to ourselves which made it especially eerie and poignant. Its a weird, weird place. A must for anyone interesting in different histories and social cultures. We walked round twice to take it all in and believe our eyes..."
394,Fascinating place,"The best exhibition on how old friends meet with only skeletons left.  If you want to get off the fright of what is left of human body after death, I recommended a visit. My visit was a few years earlier than Dec 2011 and who knows if you would meet me in there, not as a visitor but a showpiece."
395,Eerie but interesting,"I did not enjoy this place at all,my husband and daughter found it morbidly fascinating. It is a cellar with hundreds of upright and clothed skeletons. Weird and not for everyone."
396,Not for weak hearted,"It doesn't look like much from the outside , as you start your descent into a subbasement ,with plenty of natural light it gets eerie seeing all of the skeletons lined up against the walls , some have been preserved quite well and most are with their original clothing mostly still intact .The infant and children were hard to look at .Definitely and interesting place to visit , if anyone has any issues with being claustrophobic, its prety much a basement with lots of natural light coming thru some f he windows."
397,Super interesting ,"Ever want to live a real life Vincent Price movie?  This is the place to go, where you can walk through the catacombs, surrounded by bodies"
398,Interesting place,"But well worth the experience. The place is extremely creepy, looking at mummified bodies, that have mostly been so well preserved, is quite unnerving. Some are in better condition than others. Most are noted and some history is given, more would have been good. I guess they want to sell you the tourist books in the gift shop. Quite fascinating really. But very creepy.Although I understand why you can‚Äôt take photos inside, it‚Äôs a shame."
399,"special experience, probably not for everybody",Many designs formed by using different bones of the human body. Monks from this order buried after death for fifteen years then dug up and bones used in display.
400,A unique cultural heritage,"We walked from Via Roma, enjoying Palermo along the way.  All five of us (2 adults, 3 teens) enjoyed the thought provoking sight.  A little bit eerie and decorative at the same time."
401,waouh,There are hundreds of bodies hanging on wall and preserved well. If your squeamish may advise against it. But takes a short time to get through. Two Euros pp to get in. Gets crowded at times
402,Interestingly Eerie,"You simply have to see the catacombs, a fascinating look into death in a culture where it's something to be celebrated and remembered, not ignored and taboo.  Make sure you see little Rosalia Lombardo, a frighteningly well preserved mummy of a girl.  I wouldn't take kids if you don't want them having nightmares."
403,A store room for skeletons,"We had seen reviews about the catacombs, but it really is something to see in person, not good for those who are easily scared not recommended for children, it's very creepy but fascinating."
404,odd but interesting,"If you are not easily freaked out by dead bodies you should defenatelly visit the catacombs. It was very interesting, though after 20 minutes or so, I felt like gettimg out! A must-see in Palermo, and something different for tourists. Just remember not to take any photos cause its forbiden. But you can sketch as much as you want, cause I saw lots of people doing it"
405,Not your usual tourist attraction,"What an experience. Did not expect this. A lot of well conserved bodies, so that you could actualy look in to the faces like looking to alive ones.If you are more delicate person you might better skip this visit."
406,Worth a visit,"Don't prepare beforehand, just visit, then read about it afterwards... and if you have time, the cemetery next door is worth a look, including Giuseppe Tomasa di Lampadusa's grave (ask for help, it's not easy to find)."
407,A Bit Too Much,"Visited here last year and was pleasantly surprised! There is a slightly macabre feel to the place but it is incredibly interesting, some of the clothes for example are still intact  so it gives you a brief snapshot of the past. The little girl (Rosalia Lombardo) is of course very beautiful and very sad to see but a very worthwhile visit and you should take the time while you are in Palermo to see this."
408,"A Very Different Experience, A Very Different Catacomb!","like the catacomb and for what  its stand.Do not like people walking around taking pictures.Even it is forbidden, people do not show much respect."
409,Museum of Death ,"This isn't for everyone, but if you're a history buff who is fascinated by cultures and traditions different from your own, then you need to make this a priority when visiting Sicily."
410,Would you trade places with any of them?,"If you like the macabre it is well worth the visit but if you are a sensitive person don't go. It is a huge ""collection"" of the dead lining the corridors mostly dressed in their Sunday finery. The last resident Rosalia looks like a doll. Very weird, difficult to compare to anything else and hard to rate considering the subject matter - fascinating all the same.There were ramps for wheelchair users."
411,A different place to visit,"Unfortunately we came to the Catacombs 5 min before they were closing, but we went down anyway and luckily the guy at the entrance let us stay for 10 min. It was a very different experience, and I don't know if it was because we were in such a hurry that we didn't see any info about the people in the Catacombs and why they were there, but because of that it didn't really suit me. I would definitely go there when in Palermo, but I'd probably get a guided tour or do some research before I went there."
412,Not for the squeamish but unmissable,"this is an attraction that is not suitable for everyone. i found it both interesting and compelling, but my other half found it somewhat distressing. if you do not mind seeing bodies that have not been moved since they have been placed then you will cope"
413,Impresive collection,You can‚Äôt witness something like they anywhere else in the world. The catacombs are huge with a crazy amount of mommies dating from 1599 to the 1900s. Some of them are incredibly well maintenez and it‚Äôs a creepy yet amazing experience to visit it. It‚Äôs my highlight in Palermo. 
414,Dead people hanging on walls,This is one of the strangest place's I have visited it has a very odd feel to it and I ended up thinking that maybe we should let the dead rest in peace and not turn their resting place into an attraction.
415,Not for the faint of heart but amazing,"This may not be for the faint hearted since it is all dead bodies, but it is amazing to see!Some bodies are in a more mummified state than others. There are sections for monks, professional people and babies. Look at the different outfits that are on display? For obvious reasons of respect you are not allowed to take photos."
416,Must see,"‚Ç¨3 to walk around underground catacombs to look at 8000 bodies, strung up against the walls in various forms of decomposition.Very strange. You can get quite close to the bodies, just a railing between. Interesting to see how well preserved the clothes are. Not sure what else to say. Would I recommend it? Maybe. I guess it's human nature to be interested in death and the macarbre."
417,Not to be missed!,"A very strange visit. Never to be forgotten. Catacombs filled with hundreds of dead monk's and people , still in their upright position. Make sure you add it to your itinerary."
418,"Scary place.  Thousands of skeletons, young, old, males, females, babies, convicts, priests....","If you are into history and not spooked by corpses I would definitely recommend a visit. It is a very interesting place, and unique."
419,How to spend time with 8000 dead bodies in one hour,"Traveling with teenage boys, we thought this would be a really cool thing to go see and it was.  Totally up their ally, especially after spending several days looking at churches and museums.  The creativity of making art from bones was neat and the fact that it didn't stink to holy high heaven was a plus.  At first I was really looking at everything and taking it all in and then I just got grossed out and over it.  The boys, however, enjoyed every second of looking, commenting and being boys.  Go see it.."
420,Weird and wonderful,"I can‚Äôt agree with the reviews that say it is a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù, my brother and I found it rather boring.Yes it‚Äôs cheap to get in but after you‚Äôve seen 1 mummified body you‚Äôve seen them all and with no English translations, the historical facts were lost on us."
421,"An ""interesting"" sight","Having seen the Catacombs in Rome years ago, so I went on a whim, did not do any research before visiting. The Catacombs of the Capuchins are different. Skeletons are displayed hanging on the walls, lying in coffins.....   Did not dare to look at the faces, only viewing the interesting clothes worn at that time.  Not recommended for families with children."
422,Interesting,"I've been there just once, but I promise never visit it once again. There are hundreds of mummificated bodies and skeletons. The air stinks of death. Please, do not take there children or people of not strong spirit."
423,Weirdest Thing I've Ever Seen,"These catacombs are not for those who can not look at dead bodies - here you find hundreds of corpses, from the 1600s to early 20th century, some of them well conserved, some just with skeleton left, dressed in the typical clothes of their times. It is spooky indeed, but for me it was one of the highlight of the Sicily trip. Not for children! Photos are not allowed."
424,"A little odd,but we'll worth a visit",what can be attractive in walking in catacombs and looking worn corpses ... there is no evidence that they are real and breathing the dust with thousands of bacterias that must live in those costumes doesn't seem to be healthy .. only for fans of cheap horror movies...
425,Palermo Break,"It may sound weird or creepy to go see dead people, but these catacombs are unlike others. Some of the bodies are hung on display next to each other, others are lying down.  If there's one mummy you should definitely see it's the one of the little girl. She is so well preserved it almost looks like she's sleeping. That's even creepier than the other mummies. But it also shows the love for this little girl."
426,Very interesting visit,Hundreds of mummies and human skeletons on display. Read about the place before u visit.It is quite a walk from the centre of town.Three euro entry. Worth a visit
427,A must see...,This is such a contrast to any other tourist attraction you will visit anywhere else in the world.   The catacombs are an amazing view into a tradition observed since the 1700s and as recently as the 1920s. The fact that the Monks have given people the opportunity to look into‚Ä¶
428,Intersting,"No stories, no descriptions, nothing interesting. Literally rows of bones, bones and some straw in clothes. Meh."
429,Creepy ,Go and see it! It will make you look at people differently when you know how they look inside. 8000 corps
430,Strangely fascinating,"Had heard about the Catacombs before visiting Palermo, so really wanted to see it but not sure what it would be like. Was a bit hard to find on foot. Well lit interior and good path once inside. Its a fascinating if rather creepy experience but would recommend it if you are looking for a different holiday experience!"
431,amazing! spooky! but strangely calming...,"These catacombs are unique to any other we have seen in the world.  The underground burial area has hundreds of bodies preserved by various processes and hung and dressed and placed in niches along various corridors arranged according to women, lawyers,soldiers virgins priests etc all dressed in their finery now dirty and decaying .there is one very famous 2 year old perfectly preserved who looks like she is sleeping this was done by a secret process in 1920 .  The doctor who did it died before he shared this with anyone.  Not for the faint of heart but very interesting.  When we were here over 20 years ago this was virtually unknown but now we were surprised to see actual tours, now there is also $3.00 e per person admission fee.  It is difficult to get to, off the beaten path, taxi would be the best way, we took hop on hop off bus but even then had a lot of walking. Right next door is an above ground cemetary and this attraction has become so popular there are souvenir stands at the entrance.  Closed for a few hours around lunch, check before you make the trip.  No photos but many postcards"
432,Creepy ,"We had been to the Capuchin catacombs in Rome which are definitely unusual and this place was equally so and even more ghoulish.  I wanted to know more about the bodies that were displayed.  Their clothes gave some clue, but not much.  Most were anonymous.  Strange place and not for the faint of heart."
433,Back to past,"We travelled specifically to Palermo to see the catacombs as I have wanted to visit ever since the most haunted episode featuring Paul o grady.Firstly you will be shocked at how run down the outside is then you will be shocked it costs only ‚Ç¨3 each. It's takes all of 10 minutes to walk around. It wasn't really a shock to see skeletons hanging from the wall however the whole concept of paying to be hung from a wall is a little strange. The catacombs don't seem to be well looked after and there is no information in English or Italian about any of its contents. That being said it's something I had to do. A bucket list type visit. The whole of Palermo felt unsafe especially because being an English tourist I stuck out like a sore thumb. Hotel advised us to not take valuables out and to be vigilant due to bag snatches. If you stay in Palermo get a taxi to the catacombs. The walk takes you through some unwelcoming areas. Taxi there, waiting whilst we walked round the catacombs and return was ‚Ç¨30."
434,Interesting,"This is certainly  a popular place in Palermo, and worth a visit, especially if you interested in macabre cultural customs. The dead are placed on full display, and in some cases according to what they did in life. Out of our group of six, one person was fascinated, another stated that it was not her cup of tea, preferring the warmth and fresh air of outside. The highlight is the preserved Rosalie, a little girl who "" looks as if she is sleeping."" I have to state I visited this place a decade ago, and she looked a little worse for wear. So, now she is in a climate controlled coffin. All in all, interesting stuff. Read a bit on the history before you go in, and that may clarify the hows and whys"
435,Surreal experience,"Super stunning mummies and skulls, skeletons and caskets. Really impressive. Entry fee was ‚Ç¨3 per person which is totally ok for what you will see. Photos and film is not allowed btw."
436,Not recommended,"It was my first time in a catacomb and I loved it! It was bizarre and interesting at the same time. Lots to see, mostly dead corpses ofcourse, but the most fascinating one for me was seeing the little beautiful preserved girl named Rosalina.The people that run this place are highly professionals and ask you not to take photos, so please respect that because there were many who didn't."
437,Historically  Macabre ,This was a unique experience. All the mummies were displayed in several ways. You were able to see how different the human body frame was 100+ years ago. There was a cemetery next door as well that you can walk through.
438,"Shocking, moving, thought-provoking.","This was high on my list of attractions in Palermo. Needles to say I have never seen something like that anywhere!  Lots of bodies arranged along the walls, mostly skeletons, but amazingly preserved and dressed in the original clothes. Very macabre and sinister, and although fascinating,  I am not sure it should be used for tourist attraction. Don't take your children with you - they will have nightmares for a month! Only 3 euros admission"
439,Unexpected and macabre ,"It's really incredible to walk through here and see the clothes from different eras. It really makes you think about your own mortality, too... The only problem for me was that there were a lot of Italians talking very loudly, pointing and laughing, and even one Spanish tour group with a microphone. All this is really disrespectful and ruins the experience for everyone else. I wish the monks would do a little more to crack down on this sort of behaviour as they're always ready to stop anyone from taking photos, which is far less disruptive."
440,Crazy experience!,I had no idea what I was visiting having been recommended by the lady in the hotel.  I was a bit shocked to say the least!  It is macabre and I swear some of them were looking at me!  I also know realise I'm definitely getting cremated when my time is up!  Read it up on google and look at some images before going especially if you have kids.  As a child I know for a fact I would have been very upset if I had visited the site.
441,First Time Visit to a Catacomb,An amazing place and experience. Very weird to be amongst so many dead bodies. Wasn't sure what to expect and had seen no photos of this place before we arrived. It is very spacious so difficulty in confined space is not an issue. Interesting and worth the 3 euro to visit.
442,Macabre ghouls,You need to see this once in your lifetime. It's so so creepy and some of the people still have hair on their heads.. it was amazing to see but a bit scary at the same time! Happy I discovered this though!
443,Scarry movie,"A friend recommended that we visit this place and I am still trying to work out why.  It's altogether a deeply weird and macabre place but then again, I guess some would find it fascinating.  Not me, I'm afraid"
444,Not to everyone's taste,This is quite something! A mix of admiration and the spooky feeling of being at reaching distance from so many deceased individuals. Highly recommended and at walking distance from Cathedral.
445,Interesting,"I've been to many catacombs before and this is one of my favourites! The entrance is inexpensive, pictures are not allowed and it's a 15‚Ç¨ ride from the centre of the city."
446,really scary,"This is an interesting exhibit of persons, now mostly bones, dressed and held here in this eternal resting place.  There is not a lot of information so it is better to watch the little video on their website before going so that you have some history of the different walk ways of people. It is not that close to down town so a taxi/car hire is needed. Better to get one and make a deal to see this and Monrealle Cathedral."
447,Interesting disturbing experience!,"If you like a little ""horror"", visit this catacombs dating back only two centuries.  Very strange way of burrying.  Unique.  One can ask questions about certain ""mummies"".  Fakes ?"
448,Humbles one's soul!,Very interesting to see the exhibits and how well some of them have lasted given the age of them since being placed in the tomb. You could imagine them jumping off the wall to the sound of Michael Jackson's  Thriller.The young child in the case looks as though asleep and very peaceful.
449,A must see,This is definitely worth a visit to experience something completely different.  We weren't sure what we would be seeing but it was so interesting to see the preservation of these old souls.
450,Worth it,"Visited  this  huge underground  'coffin'  with  its  filling   of  small  dead  people placed upright against the  walls  where  they  were seemingly 'hangout  to dry. Nevertheless they tell  the story ever so  eloquently  as if to  say ' stop!  visitors  stop! as  you  are  so  once  were  we,  as  we  are now  one day  so  you'll  be '. I  found  the  whole  thing  depressing , but  my  wife enjoyed  it....  and  it  might  well  be  unhygienic  to  be  so  close  to  these dead  people.  What  I  did  find  delightful  however was  the  journey  to  the  Catacombs,  that  long  street  with its  many  shops   and  in  particular  the  vast  plant  shop  with  some  truly  charming  staff  just  up  the  road ."
451,I've been wanting to visit for the longest time!,Strange place to go. Arrived here by chance. I felt a little uncomfortable visiting peoples final resting place. To be honest if your of a squeamish nature it's not the place for you. Maybe we should close the doors and let them rest in peace.
452,Fascinating and insightful,Not something I would recommend personally but my teenage children were transfixed. Found it quite monotonous as unfortunately once you have seen one dead corpse/skeleton you gave seen them all. I think that makes the whole experience quite disrespectful to the dead. Go and see and make up your own mind. For some reason I find examining cemetery memorials far more moving and thought provoking. Mummified bodies dehumanise these people.
453,Return of the Dead,"Super interesting and shocking . First of all, it's at least a 15-30 minute walk from the city center through not such a nice area. However , the place itself is well worth a visit, to see something completely different from what we are used to. I was quite disturbed after, but I still do recommend it."
454,Very very memorable,The whole reason I went to Palermo in the first place and it didn't disappoint think it was 5euro entrance it was a lot more than I expected and really different thing to do I've been to quite a few ossuarys and this was up there at the top you aren't allowed to take pictures but they don't really enforce it too much just don't go overboard I think
455,Mysterious Eerie Place - Worth a Visit,"Underground halls of corpses are lying in boxes, tied standing up, etc. There are shelves of skulls. This seems disrespectful to the dead to me. We only had 10 minutes to go through it before they closed for lunch and that was plenty of time. If you're looking for bizarre, then this may be for you. Otherwise, spend your time and money elsewhere. Not for children. Remember, you can't unsee this!"
456,interresting,A slice of history in it's most macarbe form. Very interesting.
457,fascinating,The only time we've seen people who have been preserved!  What a crazy idea and tradition.  A must see if you are in the area!
458,Interesting,We weren't that amazed and would definitely think you could give it a miss.We preferred walking around the botanical garden
459,A lot of bones,We went there because we saw it on the internet. First outside you have the typical gipsy asking for money to let you park in a free zone. Then the ticket is 3‚Ç¨ and they are not kind.
460,Different strokes for different folks....,"I've seen mummies before. but this museum is a very different experience. Believe me, you want to look at the mummies one by one. Very interesting. babies, women, guys... No photography allowed. Visitors were taking a secret photo. Some of them have eyelashes, eyebrows or even eyes. They still the eyeballs. The entrance fee is three euro. Visiting hours are as follows: 9 - 13 e 15 - 18.The Catacombs of the Capuchins are open every day of the year (including holidays). The catacombs are closed on Sunday afternoons from late October to late March.If you want to walk a bit far. But we walked. we have more time we discovered the places where the people of Palermo live."
461,"My relatives are buried here, so We had to come to visit them",Feels a little morbid but fascinating none the less! Took a while to find as we got lost but was glad we visited.
462,Freaky!,"An eerie place, but one that must be seen to be appreciated. The skeletal remains of some 400 plus people reside here. Peacefully, staring back throught eyeless skulls at you, the tourist. It makes you want to sing ""thigh bone connected to the hip bone.""  Respects to all who are currently here, it is as they say, a mirror of who we all will be. The staff is very informative. Get the tour book and post cards as no photos are allowed. This is just a few blocks from the Barbarini Piazza. Cafes are all over the area. This site is in a building/museum."
463,Freaky-Deaky and Fun,Macabre but fascinating place to visit. Not for the feint hearted but an experience that you will never forget.
464,Just wow,"This is a reasonably popular attraction adjacent to a busy cemetery. It is a bizarre catacomb where the residents are fixed to the walls in a standing position. Rosalia Lombardo, the little two year old interred here in a glass case is often visited. This place can be confronting."
465,I liked it.,"Excellent experience - went with a very open mind. Was well worth the visit. Morbid, but also very interesting at the same time. Allowed to go around at your own now pace, but photography was not allowed ( could purchase some postcards at little kiosk on way out - and also info book). Got a taxi from Palermo, but walked back (about 45-50 mins) which was 'hairy' at times - only due to traffic and crossing roads, but enjoyable."
466,Amazing!,"Just Kidding! We took a tuck tuck from the city center, (which was super fun) to the site. The catacombs were surprisingly not creepy whatsoever. It actually had a peaceful feel to it. It was quite an interesting experience to see so many various mummies in their preserved states. Our visit to Palermo was amazing, and this place topped it off!"
467,Kind of Creepy if you think too much about it!,"This is definately a must see in Palermo! I admit, it's a bit weird and scary. But it's a unique experience you'll never have anywhere again. Make sure to catch up on history especially of Rosalia's before visiting, so you get the most out of it. It's better to know the info before visiting, makes it much easier. Don't be scared, it's really worth it. Though I wouldn't recommend it to children ..."
468,The perfect creepy place,We were travelling with my boyfriend with a group and our guide was not a fan of this-he was not even recommending it. So wrong! You shall definitely pay a visit when you are at Palermo and do include this on your main schedule. A bit creepy due to the fact that all skeletons are surrounding you from bottom to the top of the walls. There is also the most famous mummified body of Rosalia Lombardo.
469,Spooked in Palermo ,"This is quite a distance out of the old town compared to other tourist destinations, but is well worth the walk.Make sure you look at the opening times carefully so you don‚Äôt arrive when it is shut.The entrance price is a bargain at ‚Ç¨3. We were really pleased to find that the way to the catacombs was very light and easy to navigate - yes there were steps but it was not uneven - it is not natural rock that you have to walk over.As you enter the catacombs themselves the floor is thick glass that you walk across, and there are several different rows that you can walk along, meaning it does not feel crowded even when it is busy. Read the history and the information of the rows on the website before you go.The sights were amazing, and spending time thinking about the history of each of the bodies, and reflecting on the number of children in there was quite moving - each person could have a living relative, or indeed no one to mourn them.It wasn‚Äôt as creepy as I expected it to be, despite being able to see some of the skin actually peeling on the skeletons.I would highly recommend a visit to it.Note: follow the instructions and don‚Äôt take photographs."
470,Creepy but interesting,Strange place to visit.  Lots of dressed skeletons standing up and staring back at you.  Not for the faint hearted.
471,More information...?,"You cannot take pictures here, but the people that have been preserved, some over  200 years ago, is astonishing.  We just walked through it with our mouths open."
472,Beware of what you are about to see,"A visit not for the faint hearted.  Not my decision either, my husband thought it would be something different! It certainly was."
473,Interesting,The catacombs were very interesting but a little gory.  I did not know much about it before I went and I really just liked seeing the clothing of the times.  It was a unique experience for me.  Just be sure to check the time since this is a place that closes for the lunch break.  There is a very good little cafe/restaurant down the street with table service.
474,Creepy and breathtaking,"A very respectful display of the long dead. I see in the reviews that people say it isn't for children, but it is not scary at all. The displays are informative and offer a sanitised glimpse into the local dead people of the time. One gets a feel of the love and care that went into preparing these bodies for burial.Also, a good place to get away from the heat and sun. :/"
475,There are no skeletons in the closet here.,"This is very interesting, but haunting. I had it in my head for a couple days after, especially the little girl that is well preserved. I believe it was only 3 Euros to see. This is not a place for children to visit, but I would recommend it to adults because it is so interesting."
476,Creepy?  Absolutely!!!!!!,"I was intrigued by another traveler when I heard of the Catacombs and just had to go! It was definitely creepy and very interesting all at the same time. I'm glad I went, but have no need to go again!"
477,Had nightmares,I thought this was going to be a small exhibit but was suprised to find it quite large. As others have stated it is different. It is an experience and if your time allows I would take the time to go.
478,So so weird!,"I was keen to see all the sights and having done my research I was baffled to see the Catacombs on many ""top ten"" lists. I was aware of what to expect but thought there must be something more than a bunch of partially degraded dead bodies / skeletons that made it worth a look. Unfortunately that was not the case! It is simply a corridor of skeletons, with no information about who the people were or where they died or how they came to be in the catacombs. We walking in and out in about 10 minutes and although it was cheap (3 Euros), it's simply not worth the walk out of Palermo or the time spent."
479,definitely an expereince,"The place is what it is, do not venture in if you are quesy about certain things. I enjoyed going around the place respectfully, the only thing that marred my visit were a couple of tourists who were treating it more like a freak show. More attendants should be available in order to make sure that such visitors are ejected. Persons interested in textiles will also enjoy various examples of clothing and uniforms stretching centuries which are still worn by the people resting there"
480,Creepy but very interesting,"I still do not understand why all these ""mummies"" are kept in this place. Can be horrifying for children."
481,Interesting but chilling,"A little out of the main centre, the Catacombes and their inhabitants are possibly something most of us don't get to see normally. The dressed bodies are mainly wall mounted and it was interesting to look at the disintegrating clothing they were wearing to get an idea of their place in time. The section with children & babies was very touching, as you think of how their families must have suffered as well as the child concerned. I didn't find it a sad place, rather a place to remember people & imagine what their lives were like & contemplate on our own. It was 3 euros to get in and the staff saw us standing at the taxi rank outside and kindly called a taxi for us."
482,Macabre and Affecting,"I used to live in Palermo and it was obligatory to take visitors to the Catacombs, everyone came away glad, for different reasons, that they had seen it. It is different than other Catacombs as there are actually preserved bodies that have decayed at varying degrees. You see them extremely up close so be prepared. I found myself looking more at the clothes and being fascinated to realize that these were actually authentic wardrobes of the different periods that these people had lived in."
483,Eerie,"This is not your typical tourist attraction..and that's why I love it! It is truly a unique experience. The catacombs contain over 8000 mummies, dating back to the 1800's. The mummies on display are those of nobility, professionals, virgins and children. They are there for one purpose: to show us that we are all mortal and life is short, so make the most out of it! I'd say skip out on a church or museum and visit the catacombs. The cost is 3‚Ç¨. No pictures or videos are allowed."
484,Delivers the goods without the atmosphere.,"Parking available outside. White lines mean there is no fee for parking but some toothless guy insisted we pay him 2 Euro for the parking. Didn‚Äôt give us a ticket or anything, just took the money. It is both interesting and creepy to see how they have preserved the bodies. There are lots of skeletons fully clothed and some with their skulls barely attached. Not a place to bring kids unless you‚Äôd like to give them nightmares.Entry is 3 Euro. It‚Äôs a bit musty inside but I guess that‚Äôs got to be expected since the skeletons have been there since the 1900‚Äôs. The children and baby section was very sad. No photos are allowed which is understandable. Overall I felt a bit disrespectful and wondered if these people are truly at peace being on show for everyone to see. Walked out sad."
485,Very interesting place. ,There are lots of skeletons around. A part was for executed criminals I guess. You can see the rope over their head & open mouth like screaming not to die.. Very interesting experience. You should definitely check if you are ok skeletons with old clothes
486,A very macabre place!,"If your not interested in history, have a weak stomach, or claustrophobic then this is probably not the tour for you. Very interesting and gives you an insight on religious history."
487,Wouldn't go there again,"We walked from central Palermo going through an eclectic selling market to the Presidents palace with what seemed an impromptu demonstration of men holding up the traffic and watching the madness that is Italian normal traffic go in to meltdown,  This was probably more entertainment with out the frightening sights of ancient dead bodies.  You have to see it to believe it.  And they have it as an attraction!  That said, the curiosity alone makes this a must but also must not see.  You have to see it but wished you didn't once you have.  The baby girl at the end of one of the tunnels is freakishly worth the 3 Euros alone."
488,"As we are, so once were they.  As they are, so we will be.","During a one week stay in Taormina, we took a day trip to Palermo to do some site seeing there.  The three hour drive was very scenic.  One of the things I wanted to see was these Catacombs. Although a bit freaky, it was actually a very educational experience.  The first thing I noticed upon entering the catacombs (besides the obvious) was that it was dimly lit and a bit cool.  I was happy there was no smell.  It didn't take long to get over the initial shock of seeing the skeletons.  It was actually very interesting to learn about the history of the Capuchin monks and how these preserved skeletons came to be.  We saw for ourselves how the bodies were segregated, for instance the lawyers in one area (fully clothed in their frocks) and that women and men were separated from each other (hair and teeth fully intact for the most part), as were the virgins (!) and the children (so sad).  Although there were ""No photos/No video"" signs posted everywhere, disappointingly not everyone respected this request.Even though it may seem a little spooky and maybe a bit weird, I would highly recommend a visit to this attraction.  It is interesting, highly educational in more ways than one and it only takes about an hour to go through."
489,Impressive,Probably 20 minutes is about enough. There are only so many dead bodies and mummified corpses I‚Äôd need to see before it all becomes a blur.About ‚Ç¨3 entrance fee.
490,Fascinating glimpse into the past,Forget the Egyptians. If you want to see mummies. This is the place. Extremely interesting.  I was beside myself on the thought process of wanting your remains displayed like they were.
491,disappointing,Worth seeing but it's creepy afterwards some of the mummies are scarry as... kids especially but no regrets thing to see definitely
492,Must go ,"Catacombs are sepultures and in older times people(rich people) were buried under churches . I visited the catacombs of the Franciscan church in Lima, Peru and while the Lima catacombs had the bones of all the people buried under the churches by limbs, arms in ones ""basket' , legs in another, skulls in another, the Capuchins catacombs has people  hanging on the wall in their burial clothes. Some of them have hairs. The catacombs have sections one for the clergy, another for infants, etc.... the body of Rosalia Lombardo one of the last admitted corpse in the capuchins catacombs is the most well preserved corpse with the skin and hair still intact."
493,Fantasztikus,"A little hard to find, but well worth a visit.  We had a very long walk to find the place, so it might be worth a taxi.Please note that the catacombs are always closed between 1pm and 3pm and close at 1pm on Sunday.No photography is  allowed, but postcards are available to buy at the paydesk. There is also a stall outside selling snacks and souvenirs, but I don't know if it's connected. Entrance fee is 3 euros, and it took me approximately 45 minutes to have a look at the ""exhibits"", which are grouped into categories, such as ""professional people"", ""virgins"", etc. Signage is in Italian. It was a bit chilly down there, even on a hot day. The atmosphere was very peaceful and most people were talking in whispers, so it appeared that the deceased were being respected."
494,Bizarre but stunning.,"We took the bus from the Independenza stop. Travel time was not long... waiting for a bus in the heat was worst part. Once we got into the area of the Catacombs, signs were posted all around and it was easy to find. The Tourist Office in Palermo is very helpful and gave us all the info we needed to travel on city buses. The Catacombs is an interesting visit. It is not for children or faint of heart as some of the bodies are well preserved (in my opinion.. hair and nails). It is a short visit... you can probably spend about 30 minutes looking around. After that, there isn't much else in the neighbourhood."
495,Breathtaking,"We didn't visit catacombs while in Rome and since we were passing by Catacombs of the Capuchins anyway, we decided to visit them. I guess places like that are great for visit by people who love visit cemeteries. I, personally, don't find that attractive. It's suppose to be a reminder of our own mortality and sure it was a great contrast to the wedding they had at the church next door that day. For me it felt weird and, at the time close to Halloween, almost like decorations."
496,All Dressed Up But Going Nowhere,"Definitely not a universal tourist attraction. Only a small part of our group liked it, most of us did not, including me. If someone likes seeing macabre dead mummified bodies of children - 5 stars. If not, I definitely do not recommend. Taking photos is prohibited there, also we had to leave 15 minutes before the actual closing time, and the whole experience was priced at 3 eur for 15 minutes - a very bad deal."
497,Not for the fainthearted.,"The catacombs are a must see attraction if you are ever in Palermo, even if you are slightly squeamish! The museum is well presented, and well kept; they promote a no photo policy, and the skeletons are well out of reach. As you walk through the corridors, there are hundreds of old corpses hanging off the walls, some with skin hanging off the frames, some with hair, and some with only their clothes. That is part of the fun, to see if there is some of the body still intact. My favourite section would be the children's section, as it contains the most up to date body, preserved in a glass box. It's chilling, but exciting at the same time. We were lucky enough to be questioned by a film maker about what we thought about the collection and it's link to fashion and we were able to ask the director of the catacombs about the preservation process, and the kinds of people that are displayed there. It is still one of the most surreal places I have been, but I want to go back again if I can!"
498,Vacantion in Sicily,A fascinating insight into the lives (and death) of Sicilians in 1850's. The main attraction is the well persevered remains of Rosalie Lombardo but just seeing the clothing and the coffins give an amazing insight into this history. Great and unique experience.
499,Interesting visit.,"Worth a visit to see the unusual way the dead were interred for a long period. Originally begun as a means of interment of monks from that monastery, it became a status symbol for which relatives paid for care of the remains. The bodies are hung on the wall or placed lying down in niches. The effects of class and position in life are striking as bodies are organized according to social status and position: bishops, archbishops, professionals, virgins, etc. The catacombs were officially closed to interments in the 1880's but some were added as late as the 1920's. It's not a place for the squeamish, though virtually all the bodies are now skeletonized; however, the clothing remains in place on most bodies and emphasizes the connection to the living. It is definitely worth the time and effort to visit this site which is part of the history of the city and a well-intentioned means of disposing of the dead. Though photos are not permitted in a sign of respect to the souls interred in this sacred place, picture postcards showing the catacombs are available at bookstores and tourist attractions if you want or need a graphic record opf your visit."
500,Never seen before,We walked to the catacombs which is a bit of a walk from central station. But you can walk via a variety of other tourist atractions so that worked out fine. There is a  ‚Ç¨3 entree fee and photo's and film are not allowed. Some people did take pictures whoch was very disrespectfull to the dead and their family! It lookes very surreal to look at dead people whit skin peeling off at close range. I think a lot of people do not even realise what they are seeing. But it's interesting to see. But why I can not tell you. I would just go and see for yourself. And please do not make pictures..why would you want to have a picture of corpses in your holiday scrapbook..
501,A bit odd...,"We have visited catacombs before but nothing like this! Literally hundreds of mummified bodies out for all to see. It's very confronting when you first enter and see the first long corridor of bodies in various stages of preservation and decay. If you are lucky enough to be there when there are no groups chattering (and even laughing?) it is quite moving to walk through. There are many monks of course, but also lay people of all ages including children and babies (very moving). I read all about how they did the mummification (mostly naturally in the right conditions) but for me the question remains - why?"
502,Creepy,"Having missed the catacombs in Rome we managed to visit our first catacombs in Palermo. Very interesting seeing the way people had been remembered & the stages of decay following full or partial embalmment. And moving too, seeing the skeletons of little children and youths. A very good place to go."
503,The dead baby,This got my attention and was something I just had to see. I read the history of it before going . It began in the 1600‚Äôs when the burial ground was full and they decided to mummify the Brother who had died so they could continue to be with him.My husband and I walked here from our hotel . It is one of the most unusual places I have ever seen . It is not for the faint of heart but definitely an historic site.
504,Memento Mori,"I did not enjoy the visit to this place, as the energy here was so negative. Obviously, it would be so with all the dead bodies around. This place is worth a visit to remind ourselves that we are just a bundle of bones who will leave this earth soon!! Rosalia looked fresh and like she was sleeping. No photographs are allowed, but many were taking pictures."
505,Different,The place was nice but not what I had expected. It is not scary or spooky like I thought it would have been. My 8 y/o enjoyed looking at all the corpse and guessing how old the babies were.
506,Interesting places,"We chose a guided tour through Sicilandays.com.  Our guide, Patrizia picked us up, took us to the catacombs giving us  detailed information of the why, the how and the when of the history of the catacombs. A weird insight into ancient beliefs and a less than respectful way to be remembered but nevertheless - fascinating!"
507,Something different,"It‚Äôs hard to sum up really! It‚Äôs interesting, but a bit uncomfortably so, not much information on offer, it‚Äôs really just a lot of bodies hanging from the walls & piled up.. and I mean lots of them (it‚Äôs bigger than you might anticipate). As it is, it just feels like a macabre tourist attraction, rather than a place of historical or religious significance, it needs more information! When we visited in March only a couple of others were visiting, If it was very busy I don‚Äôt think it would have had the same feeling. We walked from the centre following google maps, it took about half an hour through some rough looking areas and busy roads (it was busy time though at around 1pm). We took a taxi back at about ‚Ç¨14."
508,Different,"Prepare to see hundreds of skeletons and bodies. We had not done too much research on the place, and where not really prepared for what we saw. I thought it was very interesting to see how people dressed a 150 years ago and how their remains where preserved. My girlfriend on the other hand was mostly creeped out. Not for the faint of heart, and not for young children either."
509,Creepy and Full of History,"Random, odd thing to do on holiday but so worth seeing! It really is a macabre hour or so out, but so interesting! Plus they clearly don't have much in the way of health and safety or concerns over preservation as some of them you could (you're not supposed to) touch! Not for people that are freaked out but so so good!"
510,Overkill,"Was not too sure that I wanted to see the Catacombs, but did want to see all that is relevant to the history of Palermo.We stopped off on the way back from Monreale.It is cheap to get in, and the queue soon goes down.We did not linger for long, and avoided the passage way featuring children.On reflection, wish we hadn't bothered."
511,Not scary at all,"Very special to go down these stairs to see all the dead people. Made me think about how short life is, and reminded me not to take it for granted. We were there in the afternoon, and it was not too crowdy. Went there by car, and had our first experience with paying for security....had to pay a guy couple of euro to ""look after our car"". There was a pretty messed up vehicle just by ours, so it seemed like a good idea to pay..."
512,Impressive - but please leave your kids outside ! ,"Most bizarre and creepy thing I've seen ... EVER!!  But definitely worth the trip downtown if you are looking for some shivers down your spine. We ""loved"" it tho. (And if things weren't strange enough for you yet they offer some postcards of the corpses at the tourist booth outside.)"
513,Interesting ,"I went with friends and was excited about it. It was interesting and a unique experience. But after going down there, i got really freaked out..and am not planning on going back xD"
514,No rsting in peace,"Not easy to find, so check before going. Closed during middle of the day and reopens 3pm. Cost is reasonable at 3 euros. Hundreds of corpses line niches in the walls of these catacombs, some are embalmed some just skeletons. Many are still clothed. Utterly weird and a bit spooky, but certainly unique. It's probably a half hour visit for most people. No photos though."
515,The Capuchin Catacombes,"The Catacombs are truly unusual.  It's not everyday one sees hundreds of dead bodies dressed up and dusted.  From my point is was ok, but others seemed to really enjoy the site and the history behind it all.  I had heard of this place so I'm glad to have seen it, but I wouldn't rush to see it again."
516,Too many mummified babies,"Rows and rows of bodies lie in these Catacombs.Interesting thing to visit - very unique experience.Far removed from our hotel, so hotel ride was a necessity.Very expensive to get there - but very reasonable to visit."
517,"Creepy, but interesting","Very creepy, but a fascinating attraction. Not for the faint-hearted! It is a bit out of the way, but somewhat near to the bus to Monreale."
518,A ghoul-ing good time!,"It's pretty obvious you will see a lot of dead people here, but to be clear, you will see A LOT OF DEAD PEOPLE. EVERYWHERE.It's fascinating, especially the clothes that the corpses are wearing, but I would not recommend this to anyone of a nervous disposition. The section with the babies is particularly tough.Practical stuff: I'd heard there was a dress code, but I was wearing shorts and a vest top and had no problem. Others went through in similar clothes. It's about a 15-minute walk from the historical centre. Not very well signposted.No, it doesn't smell."
519,A bit creepy,"The catacombes are completely opened and, weird detail, the body are pretty much all hung on the wall. Impressive to see the natural mummification process and the details that those mummies give us about the past. Not for sensitive people though!!One thing: if you visit, please pay respect to those people! I have seen to many tourists laughing, speaking out loud, taking pictures, this is not Disneyland..."
520,Interesting but repetitive and poorly maintained,"An interesting place to visit, but not easy to get your head round at all, knowing these are just shells of the people they had once been and especially sad to see so many children. A quiet thoughtful time afterwards is essential to consider what you have seen, it‚Äôs not gratuitous but is somewhat gruesome. Fascinating and intriguing. Probably not for children or anyone with a nervous disposition."
521,Fascinating,"This creepy crypt is an unusual attraction,which is certainly memorable,and undoubtedly interesting in a strange way.It is also quite a sad place to walk round.......prompting thoughts of our own mortality."
522,"Very, very surreal","I first learned about the Capucin Catacombs on the excellent BBC series ""Francesco's Italy from Tip to Toe"". Since we were in Palermo for two days, we had to see it because of its' uniqueness. I was a bit apprehensive that it might give me nightmares and be hard to stomach, the truth is that it was none of that, it's neither creepy nor scary, what it is is thought provoking. The bodies are in various states of decomposition. Rosalie, for example, was lovingly preserved by her family who must have visited her often. There are monks in sackcloth, priests in their garmente, lawyers and doctors in their expensive suits, even an admiral in full military regalia. There's a section for virgins (only twelve of them) and they're beautifully dressed in the fashion of the day. It's all totally authetic. The visitors are respectful and quiet, but most of all intruigued, as was I."
523,Very creepy but so interesting too!,"a 20 minute walk from Quatro Canti and you find yourself in a residential district housing the catacombs. You pay at the desk and descend down into what is more like a crypt with daylight from windows at ceiling height. The catacombs are smaller than expected but how many hundrreds of clothed semi preserved skeletons does one need on a daily basis? Interesting arrangements of bodies, both socially and spiritually, lending an insight into the heirarchical methods that continue to this day. Worth a visit, not too goulish and very low key."
524,Morbid ,Wow . We ended up visiting after we convinced our sicilian friends to take us there. It is the creepiest experience ever as these are not so old corpses and its fascinating to see mummification being practised as early as last century in Italy as a sign of class
525,Saint rosalea,"Unfortunately, you're not allowed to take pictures which is a bit of a let-down. It's quite eerie and first impressions are a bit confronting. The macabre spectacle afforded by the sight of the dead, all lined up in their suits and dresses, can be quite unnerving. The stories behind some of the deceased are quite interesting, sometimes bizarre. The one about Antonio Prestigiacomo, who stands upright in a niche all his own, leaning forward slightly, is of particular interest. He was given special treatment which kept his eyes open. This is because, in life, he was a bit of a ladies' man, so they mummified him with his eyes open so he could still look at the women passing by. The most touching one here is the little girl, Rosalia Lombardo, who was born in 1918 but died when she was two. She looks like she's only sleeping. It's quite disconcerting! Stories have been circulating that the little girl's eyes have been seen to open and close but I wasn't hanging around to see for myself! As for taking pictures - when I visited the Capuchin Crypt off Via Veneto in Rome there was a sign which advised you not to take pictures, I was naughty and did - not one picture came out, so I didn't bother here."
526,Too interesting not to take in!,"We stayed in Palermo near the port.  The catacombs were approx 30 minutes drive from our hotel (Ibis Styles). Parking was free, however there are people there who offer to keep an eye on your car whilst you visit the Catacombs for payment (beggars). This is not necessary, so don't be fooled. Photography is not allowed and each corridor is equipped with video surveillance so please be respectful of the dead. An interesting visit."
527,Creepy but worth seeing,This was an interesting experience. There was a totally different energy than outside under the sun. It's amazing to see how preserved some of the mummies are. The only thing that bothered me was that quite a few visitors were taking pictures (with flash) even though there were a lot of signs that it's prohibited to do so.
528,"If your looking for a differnt kind of historic visit and into creepy/science/body exhibts,then this is for you","You need a fairly strong stomach, but an amazing thing to see. All these bodies and the little girl in the glass topped coffin, incredible."
529,Strangely fascinating,"Visited for second time the catacombes, but still scarry those skulls and all kind of bones. I think that this place is unique and you have to visit it."
530,Cool but Creepy,"A trip into the suggestion of death and history of Palermo: at the same time scary, but also very heartful, especially if you see the ""mummia"" of the two-years-old Rosalia......"
531,macabre but fascinating,"Although they may not be with us in the living sense I felt that the inhabitants, often dressed up in their finest clothes had real dignity - even in death. And the decaying half skin - half skull look often made it appear that they were laughing.... maybe at us. Do they know something we don't?This exhibit is not to be missed because, as is with all great art  it really provokes some deep thought. You'll certainly never forget your visit."
532,"Completely Unique, Macabre Experience","This was an interesting visit. It was strange to get to, but we felt safe the entire way walking there.  It was also a nice way to see the side streets of Palermo. The catacombs were very interesting. It is a low ceiling getting down there, but it is set up quite well, with a walk way that goes through all of it. There are different rooms with certain displays, all around you are bodies from several classes. It was super interesting to see the bodies, the clothing etc.  It had a eerie feeling but it doesn't scare you. We loved it!"
533,Different,"I loved the catacombs. There are signs in English that help you discover the history represented down there, such as soldiers from different eras. It's cool on a hot day, creepy, but not too claustrophobic. And the little girl is super spooky in a sweet way."
534,Absolutely  amazing ,"The well-preserved body of the little girl is their selling point. Check opening hours before going. Since we went off-season, the hours were 10am-12:30pm and 3pm-5pm"
535,If you are brave you can see mummified cadavers.,"This place is something special, not typical touristic attraction. I personally liked it, never seen something like this. Dark and mystic, provoking thoughts. You are silent at this place and it feels like in a movie. 3‚Ç¨ entrance and parking in front."
536,"Interesting, and surprising...",A different experience and a slightly strange one. Corridors filled with skeletons and mummified people. Good for a rainy day.
537,"Creepy, but interesting","I went to the catacombs with my wife and her sister.  It takes around 40 minutes to see everything, which means walking along the thematically arranged alleys - men, women, babies, virgins, monks etc. I had mixed feelings about the place. On one hand, it is a unique - and rather chilling - experience to see hundreds of mummies one next to another, just an arm's length from you. On the other, I would be eager to learn more - why were the bodies mummified? When did the people die? Are there many places like this in Italy or in the world? Any background story would be nice, and yet you're left with your own thoughts about death and passing of time. Which is definiitely one key topic there.EUR 3 entrance, not recommended for children. Take 327 from Piazza Indipendenza and get off at Pitre' - Pindemonte, it's 200m from there.  Forbidden to take pictures - and they mean it, there's cameras all over the place."
538,Amazing. Not at all morbid,"never seen anything like this in all my travels. a batch of visitors at the afternoon opening session all went down to the catacombes very chatty, within seconds there was complete silence, some covered their mouths in shock and many peeked between fingers. it seemed unreal and more like a freak show, but I felt compelled to look and also sad at the same time. Seeing the babies was quite distressing."
539,Interesting!,So glad that I went on a tour and had the opportunity to experience this unique piece of history.  I have to admit that it was a little unnerving to see several small rooms decorated with human bones.  Our tour guide - through City Wonders was great in sharing her thoughts on mortality.  I definitely recommend visiting.  I've never seen anything like it.
540,Different,My husband and I love ossuaries and have been to many.  This was definitely the weirdest one we have ever seen (in a good way).  Creepy in a good way.
541,Very memorable,"As you wander the crypt hallways you can't help but wonder about past activity when families would spend time here visiting loved ones. I am glad this was one of my first stops, it helped me understand the significance of crypts at smaller churches in Italy.Take time to stroll through the cemetery attached to the church. Here you will see the love, concern and respect families have for those who have gone before them."
542,Creepy beyond belief,"Essentially, this place is row upon row of of poorly preserved corpses. With only a few exceptions, there's no info about any of the bodies exhibited here, save for when they might have died. The people that run the place operate it in a respectful manner, but the whole thing seems kind of ghoulish to me. If you happen to be in the area and you want something to fill the hour, then go, but don't make this a 'must do' destination...like I did."
543,Creepy but intriguing,Never saw so many dead people. Still in their natural state. Something to see that you will never forget. A must see!!
544,interesting,"Excellent insight into the early Capuchins and their beliefs in after life, nothing like it in the world"
545,Good to see!,"My wife and I sailed on Holland America Eurodam for our first Western Mediterranean cruise. The second port Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily. One of my main objectives was to visit the Catacombs of the Capuchins to see 8,000 mummified monks.  Our taxi driver ‚ÄòVincenzo‚Äô was our tour guide and made arrangements for us to get in. The cost was 3‚Ç¨ per person. Let me say that the place is creepy and morbid. I would not bring young children or easily frightened adults to this place.  For as far as the eyes could see, there were corpses throughout the building.  If you have ever been in a large warehouse, just imagine it is filled with corpses and you have a similar image to the catacombs.  Interesting enough, the building floor was glass. There was railing separating you the visitor from the corpses.  There were names and texts to some of the corpses but they were in Italian. Sadly, you don‚Äôt get a live narrative or a written one on this tour.  The cruise ship offered a tour of this building with a tour guide for about $90; that was a bit much for a $4 admission price.  Afterward, there is a souvenir shop outside where you can purchase items.  Overall, this was a very good attraction given its unique atmosphere and admission price."
546,Fascinating but creepy,"Be brave if you go here.  It is macabre, interesting, and  has a lot of history.  The 16th Century Catacombs were started by monks.  There are several thousand corpses in various stages of preservation, decay, and mummification.   There are bodies everywhere.  There are arranged in categories.  A must see for those not weak of heart.Cost is inexpensive around $12."
547,"A bit creepy, but fascinating and worth the visit","You've just got to see this and reflect how it makes you feel, amazing! The whole visit is just amazing, not sure it's a family visit though"
548,Creepy or what,"Be warned that if you visit sicily's weirdest attraction, the images will remain with you for the rest of your life particularly the fully dressed corpse whose head has fallen between his shoulders and the young girl miraculously preserved, undoubtedly the star of the show. What am I talking about: hundreds of partially preserved grotesque men, women and children held upright (just) fully dressed in a parody of life. The theory was that should you be inclined to visit uncle guiseppe or grandma Maria after they had died then you could pop along and see them standing there anytime you liked. Great idea- not!"
549,A little bit scared,"A good friend, who lived in Sicily back in the 90‚Äôs, insisted that we visit this place; it was, he said, his favorite in all of Palermo.  My wife and I took the long walk down Via Cappuccini where every third Palermitian pointed us in the direction of the Catacombs, assuming that any foreigner could not be heading down this narrow, dangerous, traffic-infested street save to fulfill some ghoulish desire to see a gallery of mummified, dead bodies in rotting, molding clothes, a kind of Catholic ‚Äúto this favor you must come‚Äù reminder of our imminent mortality. The catacombs give the term tourist ‚Äútrap‚Äù a new kind of meaning--a place that brings out everything questionable about tourism itself. A cross between a carnival peep show and an Ebola ward, the catacombs offer the titillation of viewing the forbidden, the unspeakable enhanced by the ever present signs that no photographs are allowed, to somehow preserve  ‚Äúrespect‚Äù for the dead on display here, though I suspect that what is really being preserved is the profits from the racks of one euro each, glossy, color postcards of the corpses for sale in the lobby leading down to the grisly spectacle below. I saw one guy taking shot after shot with a telephoto lens and others with cell phone cameras as though these warnings were not to taken seriously.  I have read, however, in reviews that the CCTV cameras are always on and that a booming voice will shout at you if you are caught taking photos.  That being said, whatever ‚Äúrespect‚Äù for the dead that may once have inhabited this venue it had long since departed when the Monks decided to charge an entry fee.  My favorite ghoul was a guy hanging out of his coffin from the second layer of stiffs who rather resembled Geronimo with his leathered, mummified visage staring down accusingly at the gawking tourists below.  The highlight of the place, if one could be said to exist, is the mummified Kewpie doll, 2 year old Rosalia Lombardo, set apart in a special roped off area in the far reaches of the tombs. Here I saw a father patiently fielding questions from his twin boys about what they were witnessing. The catacombs are, indeed, a macabre spectacle and sure to arouse either a mild, cynical amusement, or outright disgust, my wife‚Äôs take being the latter and mine the former.  Part of my amusement derived from thinking about my friend and how he must have enjoyed his time in this hideous, stifling chamber of horrors straight out of Edgar Allen Poe. ‚ÄúFor the love of God, Montressor!‚Äù"
550,Fascinating place,"Worth checking out. A tad off the beaten path if your on foot. From the cruise terminal, you will need a ride. 10 minute walk with Hop on Hop off bus. It's cheap to get in & takes about 45 minutes to walk through. NO PICTURES, AND THEY MEAN IT!! Its dad, creepy yet very cool and interesting."
551,Weird visit,The catacombs are essentially a private cemetery which include bodies of monks and people who could afford to be buried here. The unusual thing is that the corpses are strung up and hung vertically along miles of corridors. It is a scene the likes of which you will never see again. Won‚Äôt appeal to all but we were fascinated. Don‚Äôt visit if it is likely to give you nightmares.
552,"""Picture it.  Sicily. 2016. I'm standing in a crypt with hundreds of mummified corpses.""","Truly remarkable and completely different underground cemetery/storage area for hundreds of mummified bodies in various states of decomposition and decay. It sounds creepy and revolting but it's not....We met the curator of this collection and he explained that people used to like to preserve their dead so that they could come and visit them and remember them with respect.It is fascinating to see all the different clothes that people used to wear and imagine some of the people in real life. The newest body dates from 1920's and looks almost unchanged from burial, but most of them are 18th and 19th century. The mummifying process was reportedly banned in the 1870's.Definitely worth seeing and extremely memorable."
553,Strange but worth it,"A must-see, especially if you are a former or latent Goth. But if you want to take pics, arrange it (by mail) months in advance."
554,Not for your ordinary tourist,"I guess some people like it, I don't. Too walk down in the catacombes to look at dead people isn't anything for me. I paid the entrance fee, walked in, but turned after 50 meters and left."
555,Descovering Sicily,Wow.... What a place to visit... For a start only 3 euro entrance... They could charge so much more because of the dear bambino Rosalia Lombardo. Peaceful to walk around and fascinating embalming methods..... People complain about it being morbid.... It is a catacombe. It says what it is on the tin x
556,Creepy af!,"This is a most uncommon attraction, but fascinating for it. Including the fact that the last remains were placed here as late as 1920. It was originally intended for the Capuchin friars only but down the years it became prestigious for outsiders to be interred in the location. They are unique and an immense reminder of mortality. Corridors of thousands of skeletons dressed in their original clothing, now inevitably faded, criss-cross the area.There is strict demarcation into different categories - men, women, bambinos, priests, monks and academics. Next-door in the lovely Capuchin church, uncannily a funeral service was underway there."
557,Weird!,"Went to this after seeing on British TV, it was October 31 (the day of the dead / All Hallows Eve) st which added to the atmosphere. It is spooky and interesting in equal measure seeing the dead peer down on you or at your hight. The ded are organised into themes by profession clerics, accountants, male and female and children. The period clothing is quite interesting, the place is dark and underground which add to the atmosphere."
558,Interesting but a little strange.,"Do not bring children to this somewhat gruesome place. There were several on our tour and they were visibly upset.  I also found it somewhat disgusting.  There are thousands of bodies hung from hooks, dressed in clothes.  Some are in glass coffins.  Some are in closed coffins.  All are dusty and in rather bad shape.  They should close this site and let the dead rest.  I felt uncomfortable throughout the visit.I only went because my husband is a physician and he was interested in seeing it."
559,Not your average 'tourist event',"Having seen the catacombs and crypts in Rome and Paris this was high on my to do list for Sicily.The admission price is so low only 3 Euros and the location is far from the bustling other tourist attractions.This was a once in a lifetime experience, there are so many bodies packed in a small space. The preserved young girl is astounding.Other tourists were quite disrespectful, taking pictures and laughing."
560,Macabre yet facinating visit,"The ticket is 3 euros, it is closed during lunch time, the timetable is 9 am to 1 pm and then 3 pm to 6 am everyday, you cannot take pictures inside.basically what you see is mummies  (most of them are now skeletons) dressed in the clothes of their time.it may be shocking if you are not prepared.. Better check some pictures on the internet before you go."
561,Goya's  gala ?,"Macabre place, remote of the main city. These are not mummies but merely sceletons, dried out human remains with one side broken open coffins to make them visible.  The more, be very vigilant for theft in that part of the city, do not walk around, better go by taxi instead of walking around. It is not really advertised by Palermo tourist office."
562,bizzare,"Been here with my family on our first day in Palermo, Italy.  Must say a bit of walking from Piazza Indipendenza to the Catacombe itself and also signs are not so clear.  Walk along Via Cappuccini and there will be a clear sign after maybe 2 kilometers.  This place is not for everyone but if you don't mind seeing mummified bodies from ages ago, this is one excellent place to see.  Entrance is only 3 Euros."
563,A Bit Sad,"Ended up here on the suggestion of a friend (on a Sunday afternoon when the other attractions around the city were closed), and had no idea what to expect. Well, I certainly didn't expect what I found! I thought I was over seeing catacombs, having seen several in the region recently, but this is different. You'll talk about this one for years to come..."
564,Quite intense,I have to admit seeing all of those skeletons was a bit intense. Our guide Alan had a lot of knowledge on the subject. However it was a bit difficult to understand him at times because of his heavy accent and his tone was low. However the other guide Sean was clear and also added humor. overall it was a good tour and I would recommend it. There's a ton of history on this 3.5 hour tour.
565,"Creepy, but that's what you're looking for.","Today we visited the catacombes with some thousands of mummified bodies displayed around multiple corridors dating from about 1700s to 1920s. It was an interesting if slightly weird experience. What was of interest to my wife was the beautiful lace that some of the corpses were dressed in. We were able to peek into the mummy preparation room where special stone tables allow body fluids to drain away and the corpse to dry before they stuffed it with straw and re-dressed it for display. But decay was everywhere. That sense of look well my friend, you too will be like me one day. The gift shop was tended by a sweet little capuchin monk who had difficulty multiplying 0.7c x 4 when we purchased postcards. He directed us towards the church but was imprecise, we went through some doors into the convent itself. It was quite strange being in there, so exited quickly. In the church we were intrigued by a hung girl searching with a torch under the marble carvings, she was either a spy, or looking for a secret message from a lover. Palermo never fails to intrigue"
566,Different but very amazing place.,"This is quite amazing, however be warned you are confronted by death on all sides as you journey into the Catacombs, and walk amongst those who completed their lifes journeys centuries ago.  In 1599 the Capuchinian monks (the drink Cappucino reminded the constructors of this coffee of their brown habits and white hoods) mummified one of their brothers,  Silvestro of Gubbio, and placed him into the catacombs where the environment preserved him perfectly.  The custom which emerged of being mummified as a professional (not a Cappuchin) when you died, dressed in your professional clothes leaves an extraordinary and unforgettable legacy for us still to walk amongst.  The flesh and clothes have been ravaged by time, but you are still in the presence of hundreds of people who walked the same streets of Palermo that you are visiting today.  Lots to ponder on.  When you emerge do drop next door to the Cemetery adjoining the museum to see how the modern rituals around death are managed in Italy with the influence of Roman vaults very much present in the family mausoleums.  I do wonder about the health hazhards in the midst of so many unprotected skeletons and their associated pathogens - but this was remarkable.  Not for the squeamish and I would think twice before bringing any under 12 to encounter - it is pretty FULL ON."
567,Extremely interesting place,"This is really quite disturbing, the desiccated, dressed figures are like figures from Ensor paintings or ghouls. One of the best visual spectacles I have seen in a long whole, but unnerving and thought provoking, as a child I would definitely have had nightmares."
568,Worth a visit,"We visited the monastery and catacombs of capuchins and there are lots of dead people there. It‚Äôs quite interesting if not creepy to see. Remember that in those days, people thought it was fashionable to be mummified and preserved for eternity in the clothing they chose. Some people are arranged specifically like a wedding couple, a grim reaper, a screamer etc... but that‚Äôs what they wanted. The sad part are all the kids that are there... but you have to think that their parents grieved and therefore were able to see their likeness for many years after their children passed. No photos or videos allowed."
569,Off cruise ship by Grumpy Grandad,A rather unexpected group of hanging skeletons with clothes and sometimes hair. Mainly holy people and those of high rank. Not for the faint hearted.
570,Much more graphic than expected,"So this is not something you see every day.  Tons of skeletons - some more intact than others.  Worth visiting with a guide so you can understand the history, etc. - otherwise, well, you've seen one skeleton ....  you've seen them all."
571,"Not for everybody, but unique","This attraction had been recommended as somewhere a little bit different to visit, and that sure was true!Not the easiest of places to get to as it is quite a distance form the other main attractions in the town.However it was definitely worth it as it was an experience unlike any other.You walk through the corridors lined with the mummified corpses of all shapes and sizes, each with a story to tell from the capuchin monks themselves to professional people, woman and even children. Rather gruesome but moving at the same time."
572,Do you really want go there? ,"Very interesting place. I've never seen anything like this. It's completely different than the catacombes in Paris, even though the motif is similar. Don't miss this!"
573,Unique,"Interesting place to visit to see Palermo's mummified dead.  Some are as old as 500 years old.  See also the most ""beautiful mummy"" (a 2 year old girl).  Cost is 3‚Ç¨ and there is a small gift shop where you get tickets.  Be aware that photos are not allowed.  Also, check hours beforehand because they close for ""siesta hours"" and open back up at 15:00."
574,Not for everybody...,"Don't miss these catacombs which include the rooms where the bodies are slowly drained and then hung up to dry!  It is a bit hard to find with winding streets, but well worth the effort!"
575,Utterly bizarre.,"We visited the Catacombs in Palermo.  Amazing how some of the bodies remain intact. Lots of history, and great souvenirs available after you finish viewing the Catacombs, I recommend to visit."
576,MORBID BUT FASCINATING,"We visited the Catacombs on the recommendation of our guide in Palermo. We had no idea that these well preserved corpses existed. Our guide explained that these catacombs were a top attraction in Palermo, so we checked it out.  There is no photography allowed and I can understand why, out of respect for the dead, although there are photograph books for sale at the door.  There were thousands of dead bodies displayed in this underground tomb, all dressed in there finest, final outfits. We curiously studied the unknown faces and wondered what circumstances placed them in their secured positions; hanging on the wall, placed on a shelf, or laying in a coffin. Each person, young and old, was painstakingly arranged to be on display for decades and decades until the earth took them back. Why? You too will ask yourself the same question as you stroll the corridors and wonder what place in history each person held during their life to warrant such efforts to continue to be looked upon by living eyes. Everyone flocked to see 2 year old Rosalia, who appeared to be sleeping. Apparently she was one of the last bodies to be placed in the Catacombs. What disease took her life? What grief did her family suffer? What strong will to fight the inevitable decay that death brings to continue to gaze at her lifeless body!  Visiting the Catacombs provides a glimpse at the determination some people have to stop the deterioration of the body.  It also provides a look at the love families had for their dearly departed as they wanted to have the ability to visit and view the deceased. Interesting, thought provoking, historical, and dark."
577,"No pictures, so no memories","The catacombs are in great shape. they are really nicely curated. The bodies are quite explicit so be warned, you might get nightmares after this visit."
578,One of its kind!,Never seen anything like it.  We did the hike up from the Palazzo - and it took about 20 minutes and it's not well signed.  Wish they had a tour because I would have liked to have learned more. Never seen anything like it.
579,An Amazing place,This was disappointing for our group of five.  The man at the ticket booth was charming while he was trying to sell us a book about the place but when we chose not to buy the book his attitude changed and he became quite rude and off-handed.  I feel that it would not be unreasonable if we were provided with  a free explanatory document rather than be expected to pay for a book which becomes a bulk and weight problem for tourists travelling on planes.  The place itself is reasonably interesting but a visit there should not be a top priority when there are far more interestings things to see and do in Palermo.
580,Unbelievable,"What can one sayThis place is unique I still don‚Äôt know what to make of itI didn‚Äôt like it, but I‚Äôm sure that wasn‚Äôt the pointThis is a different cultures way of dealing with the deadAmazing"
581,"Poorly maintained, just a freak show",Well worth 3euro.Not my thing at all my Mrs made me go.Glad I did  .Go on boys have some man the fxxk up
582,Different and slightly macabre ,"This is the place to go to appreciate the reasons why a culture would do something like this. Don't think about the morbitity of it, just go for the historical and religious aspects and the history. My cousin, who is in his 80s tells me when he was a kid...as they lived nearby, would hide...and when visitors came through they would roll a skeleton head from the dark corners, right at their feet. What a hoot!"
583,The dead centre of Palermo,"We wanted to visit the catacombs expecting to get more information about the place once on site. The lack of information about the remains subtracts from this unique experience. After returning to my hotel I read about the burials and mummification process. Knowing this before would have made a difference. Do go, but read up on the site before arriving. I think it would make a better experience for visitors."
584,mummies ! of all sorts and kinds,Personally I am a bit scared of dead bodies so I wasn't so keen on doing this but it was very interesting seeing how old they were. We were trying to find the oldest person there. It was a bit scary but totally worthwhile seeing.
585,Exactly as you see in the pictures nothing more,"A bit out of the way, but a place one must visit. Perhaps not for the faint hearted - essentially hundreds upon hundreds of dried up dead bodies, macabre and unique at the same time. No photographs are allowed and the place is full of security cameras - the guard keeps on telling people off through loudspeakers, while people keep on taking pictures."
586,One of the Top 3 Things to Visit in Sicily,"We decided to visit these catacombs in Palermo without realising exactly where it was located. Had I known how far we would have had to walk from the hop-on hop-off bus in extreme temperatures and with no reasonable pavement I may have changed my mind! However, once there we were glad that we had made the effort. Without being able to say that it is the most interesting place that we visited, it certainly IS interesting. The bulk of the bodies that are stored in the catacombs, I thought, were going to be of Catholic priests, not so. There were women, children and professional people too. Some of the displayed corpses were in terrible condition with the straw used to pack out the clothing in evidence, but there were several that still had full beards and heads of hair. The most remarkable body was of a two year old girl, who was perfectly preserved and wearing what appeared to be a party dress. Her blonde hair was curled and she looked, if not asleep, to have just died but had been there since about 1920. This place is not at all creepy and is well worth the 3 euro entrance fee. Outside is the current graveyard, with ornate gravestones, and beautiful shrubs around the graves. Very peaceful."
587,Bizarre experience,"Horrible, skeletons of babies displayed in the wide open (still in their cots in some cases) without any covering. No plaques or information to elaborate on any of the bodies, just endless rows of remains. The morbidity aside, it was a very boring and brief activity, not helped by someone on the Tannoy ironically repeating ‚Äòshow some respect in this cemetery, no cameras‚Äô once you‚Äôd paid the 3‚Ç¨ entry price."
588,Big emotional shake!,"We walked from the city to the catacombs. It's a bit of a walk but you see so much of Palermo...so worth it. Thought I might be freaked out but was amazingly beautiful and interesting. Not scary at all. Worth the low admission price. Family's, cardinals, soldiers and lots of monks. Of course the famous Lombardi girl that really does look intact as the day she passed."
589,Not for the fainthearted,"Was expecting a lot more, turned out to be dressed skeletons on a ten minute walk round That being said it is fascinating and creepy! Wish there was more story or a few descriptions etc Beware of the walk as well some of the most terrifying roads in Palermo to get there. More terrifying than what was inside"
590,"Not a top sight, but impressive and unique worldwide",When we first arrived the catacombs were closed as it was too early so we visited the cemetary next door.  That was incredible with families buried together in elaborate crypts.  The dates and family names are there and it is very peaceful.  Then the catacombs opened with an entry fare of 3 euros.  It was enlightening to see the different dress of the times.  One of the skeletons that I had noticed had an apparent bullet hole in his skull.  A few had broken jaws.  The majority looked very peaceful and they had a professional aisle .
591,unique experience,"We decided to pay the Catacombs a visit during our trip to Palermo, and found them very interesting. Some were better preserved than others but nevertheless this is definitely worth a visit. The entrance was only 3e and be sure to reserve around 1h to look through the catacombs in peace and quite."
592,Seems disrespectful to the dead to me.,"Booked this tour through our cruise ship, imagining an underground crypt with coffins. We were shocked to find corpses hanging from the walls. Bit taken aback but found it moving and quite sad. Our 11 year old son was amazed by it. Not creepy or scary but truly a different tour that we will never forget. We respected the dead by not taking photographs as requested but some people were which was quite annoying."
593,Worth the Visit to this interesting place!,"Did not know exactly what to expect when we first got there,but it was amazing.Totally serounded  by dead mummified bodies floor to ceiling,it's just got to be seen."
594,"Interesting, fascinating and bizarre","This crypt is extremely interesting.  It contains large amounts of corpses and skeletons dressed in the clothing they were buried  in.  Women, Men and Children there doesn't  appear to be a rhyme or reason on how they are displayed."
595,Not what I expected...,"Nowhere else will you experience a spine chilling ‚Äòtouch‚Äô of those who passed away a long time ago. We went there with young children, which gave us chance to discuss the less mortal aspects of life. Having said that, I still believe isn‚Äôt a place for the faint-hearted."
596,I wouldn't go out of your way to see this.,"The Catacombs are located in central Palermo so driving and parking is an experiance in itself. The Catacombs are well worth a visit, but if you are of a nervous disposition think carefully before you decide to visit. As you would expect, you enter the Catacombs by walking down flights of steps into the basement area of the Capuchin church. There is an elevated walkway (to protect the floor below) over a large part of the subterranean area and dried corpses line both walls of the passageways.We found the visit very interesting, on our first attempt at a visit we found the Catacombs closed for disinfestation!! On our visit 2 days later there were workmen plastering the walls of the stairs and the ceiling of the Catacombs, and they were talking in normal voices so any hope of reverence was quickly dispelled. We both had difficulty in relating the corpses to real people, so we had no sense of shock or anguish whilst we visited.We understand that one of the reasons for being placed in the Catacombs after your death was that you could still have contact with your family. It was not uncommon for the living members to visit their deceased relative on birthdays and the like and even hold hands and sing!The really touching scene is the embalmed body of the 2 year old girl who is laid to rest in her cot, in her nice clothes, with her hair intact and a yellow bow ribbon to tie it back. She died in 1920 and appears that she has just fallen to sleep. Most of the remaining bodies are virtually skeletons many still wearing the clothes that they chose to be buried in.There is some pay parking in the Piazza Cappuccini in the piazza itself, however 2 blocks down and turn right and you will find one of the only surface carparks in the area and at 1 euro an hour (or part hour!) it represents very good value.After you have visited the Catacombs, go and see the cemetery that is attached to the church  and just wander pass the graves. If you have not visited a Sicilian cemetery before its worth the visit."
597,Interesting and particular place,there are a bunch of dead people and nothing else. the corridors are suffocating and they lack story telling abilities. i would not recommend to spend your 3 euro admission fee here.
598,Worth a visit,The Catacombes is a strange place. The vast amount of dead bodies is quite overwhelming. There are rows of dead people lined up on the wall and coffins with one side missing so you can see inside. The worst bit was the dead children but the whole thing is just bizarre! Overall it was an interesting experience and I'd recommend it. The entrance fee was only a few euros and it's unforgettable. We spent about a hour there that was enough!
599,Interesting!,"It is not for children nor for people sensible; there are mummies dressed in XVIII or XIX century clothes, a lot of historical personalities very impressive the excellently preserved body of a 2 year old girl inside a glass enclosure. I suggest to visit."
600,Weird yet wonderful......,"Very interesting and oddly peaceful.  Originally Capuchin monks were ""buried"" here but then it apparently became a symbol of status for the family. We didn't go with a tour and I think it is a better experience without the noise of a large group.  You can always read about it for the information."
601,If dead bodies freek you out give this a miss if not all ok.,"We've visited catacombs throughout Europe, but nothing could have prepared us for our visit to the Catacombs of the Capuchins in Palermo. It was a 3-mile walk from the Port of Palermo through the heart of the city and the ordinary streets of Palermo.The catacombs fetched a modest entrance fee -- just a couple of Euros - and are barely below street-level, with plenty of daylight peeking through the stairwell on the way down.Out of respect for the dead, photography is not permitted, although there were plenty of people sneaking photographs, followed by the voice over the loudspeaker reminding patrons that this is burial ground and the dead should be respected.The skeletons are hanging on the walls, fully clothed.  Some, like the young Rosalia Lombardo who was 2 years old when she died, are perfectly preserved.If you have small children, this may not be a good place for them -- we were caught off-guard in what we would see with our young child and opted to tell him that they were simply pirates.It's worth a visit, but a long walk from the pier or even from the hop on / hop off buses.  If you're walking, make sure you make a right at the first WORKING street light at a true intersection -- the FIRST street light is broken and leads you down a seedy alley with parked cars on either side -- don't go down that street!  There is a restroom available upon exiting, but neither the men's nor women's rooms had toilet paper -- so come prepared!"
602,Macabre!,Not for children or easily impressionable people.  But really worth seeing.  Surely a unique place to visit.
603,GREED AND VOYEURISM MEET EDGAR ALLEN POE,"I wouldn't have ever thought to visit this kind of catacomb where the corpses have been hang on the walls and they are all visible. I have to admit that it felt first quite scary. But it used to be the normal way to bury when one died but I guess we are not used to see dead people nowadays. After the initial ""shock"" we started to look what was written about each person and what kind of clothes they had worn and what was their profession. There's one very famous corpse, a 5-years girl, who died 100 years ago and still looks like she is just sleeping. If you want to see totally different ""sight"", this is good candidate."
604,Scary but fascinating ,Worth a visit. Never seen anything quite like it. Several thousand corpses and an interesting story.
605,Not something you see everyday.,Visited the catacombs in Palermo - it's a little off the city centre and a good walk from the cathedral. The spectacle is slightly odd and a bit quirky.There are numerous bodies in different states of preservation and dress.I suppose the only criticism is a lack of information within the catacombs - it would be nice to know more!!There is no unpleasant smell and the chambers are well maintained - there is a small fee of 3 euros to enter.It's an interesting place to visit and there is a ghoulish fascination to this place
606,Breath-taking!,This place is unlike any other on the planet.  We had three teenagers in our group and they loved it.  We all agreed it was the highlight of our two weeks in southern Italy and cannot be missed.
607,Very unique experience,"This place is kinda creepy and if you're into that horror stuff you'll love it. Skeletons surround you and no picture taking allowed, but not too sure anyone would want to take photos of the skeletons.. You'll find the most beautiful mummy here, she looks like she is just sleeping. The history of this place is pretty interesting.. you'll want to read up about it before or after you go. It's not a place that you'll spend hours at but it's not too much of a hassle to drop by and look around."
608,"Interesting place, but lacks information","I went early morning by bus , as a result it was very quiet and no one else was wandering round which made for an eerie experience . I found it fascinating if a little unnerving"
609,beautiful in a different way,"I was determined to see these catacombs on my trip to Palermo and I must say they did not disappoint.  They are at once shocking, amazing, fascinating, fabulous, and sobering.  There are no explanations as to who these people were or how they ended up here, presumably voluntarily, although I expect the young children did not have much say in the matter.  I think what the catacombs do best, though, is to remind one that death is truly inevitable, and at the end, this is what is left.  I'm not quite sure how to describe the feeling, but it does make one want to rush out and start living each day to its fullest.  Tempus fugit and all of that.  The Capuchins seem to have a thing for catacombs, skeletons and bones because they also have the same on view in Rome.  I highly recommend this encounter - but not for young children."
610,Unique ,"This place is really impressive. When I planned my trip to Palermo, it was my primary place of interest. The entree fee is 3‚Ç¨, photo and video is prohibited but it worths visiting"
611,freaky!!!,Very interesting insight into how people were buried.  No information provided about the catacombs.  we were lucky enough to catch the information provided by a organised tour group.  It would have been great if they could have provided some information.  I would recommend to read up before attending.
612,Not to be missed,"The catacombs are a fascinating view of the departed placed fully clothed on racks against the walls of this large subterranean burial chamber. The bodies are dried and mummified over time. Priests, monks, professionals and even children haunt the halls here all in evolving states of mummification. Not recommended viewing for small children but it truly  unforgettable."
613,"Serene views of dead persons, 100 plus years old.",These are one of those places that you either love or hate. It's clearly filled with hundreds of bodies dressed in their clothes. Some even have mummified skin so you can get a better idea of what the corpse would have looked like in life. Most distressing is seeing the small baby bodies. I'm glad to have gone but I did feel as though I was looking at some sort of freak show and had transgressed an invisible line as this was a holy resting place and not a tourist show.
614,Spooky,A meaningful experience if you have the right attitude.
615,Not for everyone,Honestly I couldn‚Äôt believe how well preserved this was. There were many bodies and what I found interesting was the way that they were displayed. Very respectable place. Interesting way of preserving the deceased.
616,Avoidable,"The catacombs are worth a visit. I will thou recommend a guide or read the history behind the catacomb before you go. It is nice to know why they did this, but also pay the persons behind these mummies the respect they deserve. We did not, and I felt ashamed walking around there as it was some kind of 'Ripleys believe it or not'. It is actually not a museum, but a graveyard, with real people, real stories behind.I wish I had taken 5 min before to understand the persons and history to pay some more resectPs. We paid 17 ‚Ç¨ from via Roma (Massimo Theatre) to the catacombs with taxi.We walked back, took us about 40 minutes, but enjoyed it a lot. Saw the real Palermo on our way."
617,Spooky ,"Very interesting well worth a visit. From stop 7 (Palazzo Reale) on the hop on hop off bus route its about a 15 minute walk to the catacombs, the pavements are narrow and in some places non existent. It costs ‚Ç¨3 each to get in and there are several steps down to the site. Strange to see all the skeletons, most fully clothed from babies to old men. Not a place to come to if you are squeamish or suffer from nightmares"
618,Fascinating and sombre visit!,"The Catacombs are a must-see site in Palermo and well worth the ‚Ç¨3 entrance fee. They still contain, unlike the Catacombs in Rome, the bodies of professionals, families, priests and religious from different eras in various stages of decay.It's definitely not the faint-hearted as there is often no barrier between the bodies and the walkways, allowing you to get really close but also unnerving one of our party.A site to be seen but check out photographs beforehand if you have children so you know what it involves."
619,A Must when in Palermo !!,"The Catacombs of Capuchins is truly a site worth seeing! It is creepy to see the bones of so many  people dressed, some even with skin! I felt weird for thinking it was so cool, but it really was! The only part of the catacombs that were difficult to see were the bones of the young children."
620,Fascinating insight into the bizarre religious fervours of the time,We went here as I wanted to see the 2 year old Rosalina Lombardo preserved by a doctor who died before telling anyone how he did it. Its sad to see the children laid out & odd how the people aspired to be buried here hung up like pieces of meat. Rosalina was beautiful with golden hair & eyelashes. No photos are allowed.
621,Very far from everything and quite disturbing,Wow this is not to be missed.It's a twenty minute stroll from the cathedral well worth a visit.Especially sad the two year old girl who is preserved so well it leaves you shocked.It's worth the visit to find see her.
622,Kind of Leaves You Numb,Weirdest place ever. Literally dead bodies pinned to the walls. Not for people who are claustrophobic. No smell of anything but you could feel a bit overwhelmed by the dead
623,Surreal,"Picture it. Sicily. 2016. We arrived in Palermo on Saturday, May 7.  Being from New York City, we tend not to vacation in urban destinations. But if we were going to visit Sicily, I had to stop in Palermo to visit the Capuchin Catacombs. Our guide, Stephania, picked us up from the Hotel Excelsior on Sunday morning.  It was Mother's Day, so the place was pretty empty. We bought tickets for three euros a piece and began our descent to the tombs.One of the first things I noticed was a green sign with a camera and a ""no"" sign through it.  Obviously, something was lost in translation.  I asked Stephania, ""uh, no photography with flash?""""No, no photography period."" My heart stopped. ""Gesummaria!""  No, this cannot BE. Here I am at the capuchin catacombs and you're telling me I can't take pictures of me in this underground tomb with hundreds of corpses hanging on the walls? No. This cannot be happening. I stared at the mummified corpses on the walls.  They looked like the inspiration for the Thriller video. I studied their ancient clothes, the fragments of exposed bone, the worn leather shoes.  How could I capture these precious details?I would bide my time and find an opportune moment to broach the topic of photography. I listened intently as Stephania explained the process of mummification, the layout of the tombs, etc. Suddenly, a voice came over the loudspeaker. I didn't understand the Italian, but Stephania translated for me. ""Someone is taking pictures and they asked them to stop."" My heart sank. They are really serious about this rule, I thought. How did I not know this?Stephania showed us the sections housing clergymen, gentlemen, women, children and the virgins. It was actually am incredibly moving experience. As we stood before the tomb of Rosalia Lombardi, my mind began to wander. How could I get them to let me take pictures? Could I tell them I'm a journalist?   ""Wait a minute..."" I thought to myself.  ""I'm in Palermo...arguably one of the most corrupt places in the world. What if that sign was simply an 'invitation to negotiate' rather than a hard and fast rule?""I knew what I needed to do. I thanked Stephania for her time, told my husband to wait for me in the parking lot, and headed back up to the ticket office. Seated beside the ticket agent was a friar dressed in traditional capuchin robes. I motioned to him and he leaned forward. ""Uh, scusa Padre,  Buon Giorno. Ciao. Uh, I go-a to the tombs, si? And I would like to take the photos."" I tapped the camera that I was wearing like a necklace. ""Uh, il posso to pay the... pizzo? He looked at me. ""Che?""  ""The...pizzo. I believe you call it in Palermo?  Something for you...and for the church. You know, for your trouble. I don't make any trouble. Just some pictures and I go. Ok?""I extended my right hand with 50 euros tightly folded up in my palm. He stared at me. I couldn't tell whether he understood my offer.  I think he did, but I was suitably humiliated and decided not to push it any further.   Instead, I unfolded the cash and explained that I wanted to buy some postcards and the souvenir photo book they were selling for four euros.  ""And please, padre, keep the change.  It's a donation.""He nodded.  ""Grazie."" I walked over to Dirk, who was waiting for me in the parking lot. ""So, what did you think?"" I asked him. ""I think we've probably been exposed to the bubonic plague."""
624,A different place to visit,"The crypt of the Capuchins is interesting but extremely creepy. Leave the kids at home! Seeing mummified bodies still in the clothing... well, not a sight to linger over."
625,Could be more informative,Just go and experience it. It evokes feelings about the interaction of death and life that we rarely think about but the atmosphere is very surreal.
626,Fairly disturbing memento mori,"Words are at a loss when one tries to describe a tourist attraction that consists of the exhibition of dead people. To see the bodies in varying decrees of decay, in open coffins or hanging on display on  the walls...well, it makes you think about death, and wonder who these people were. A bit morbid, yet fascinating place to visit."
627,Unforgettable creepy place.,"I can't say that it was a top priority for me, but my travel pal, my cousin really wanted to go, so we walked over to see the famous Catacombe dei Cappuccini.. It's only 3 euros.  The best buy was the 10 euro book on Sicily's art & history that was sold at the entrance.. Some people may find seeing clothed skeletons from the 18th-19th century a bit bizarre. They weren't ancient bodies - some from the 20th century, like the little 2 yr old Rosalie - who died in the 1920's, but is so perfectly preserved in a glass casket that she looks like she's just a sleeping child.  Seeing the original clothing was interesting to me, though many were getting pretty tattered.. I think it's one of those things that is a one time thing to see- no photos allowed..so I bought the art & history book, the catacombs are featured on page 29.."
628,Interesting but off-putting,"Guess I'm biased as this was the whole reason to visit Palermo. Did not disappoint, so incredibly interesting. Get there early to wander round in wonder and respectfully before the hordes of buses arrive. It's open for 3 hours morning and afternoon. Sit in one of the free alcoves as this is what Sicilians would do to contemplate death and see if they fit...! If your a dark tourist this is a must ‚Ç¨3."
629,Been waiting years to go here!!,"We visited Palermo as part of a cruise excursion. I had seen this particular place on 'Most Haunted',  which featured Paul O'Grady and Yvette Fielding As someone who is fascinated with the macabre and ghost-sightings, it was right up my street!  On entry. you notice how cool it is in these caves. I say caves, they are actually on a street but cut into the rock face. But cave will do. All around you are these dehydrated corpses. All strung from walls and lying down and all dressed in clothing of their professions. There a re a lot of priests and high-rankers that chose this place as their final resting place. There are around 5,000 corpses to be seen here. Some are children and if that would upset you it is not advisable to go here. The most famous child corpse here is Rosalia Lombardo. She is encased in a glass surround to preserve her body from the natural decomposition of the atmosphere. This obviously works because she just looks like she is asleep. she was 2 when she passed and she died from pneumonia in 1920.This is a good attraction for those that are not afraid of the abnormal. There is also refreshments outside the attraction with fabulous ice cream!"
630,Fascinating ,"Mixed feelings about this... husband and son really seemed to like it but I found it a bit odd in that all these skeletons were on display. I wonder how people would have felt if they knew this is what would happen to them hundreds of years or so after they have paid to be buried in the depths of a building and then they are being displayed for all to see?Not creepy as such (not that I would want to be there alone at night!) but just a bit odd for me.Entrance fee cheap enough, but its about a 30 minute walk from the centre."
631,Interesting but scary,"I really wouldn‚Äôt take children! This is the kind of place that would have given me nightmares as a kid. What I wasn‚Äôt prepared for was not only how many corpses there are in the catacombs, but also the fact that most of them are stood up. Well, hung up, attached to the walls. Yes there are also babies and children. Definitely one for the macabre."
632,More than interesting and really unique,"Unique place int Palermo, with thousands and thousands mummies from different centurys. Historical and respectful display of a long death. Must see it."
633,Poignant,"Being a tad bit scared and sceptical, I found this adventure awesome!  I have never been to visit catacombs before so I didn't know what to expect. It was slightly Erie at first but it soon turned into respect and sadness!  Amazing how bodies can be preserved and after sooo many years still hold that human factor!  I would recommended this to anyone who wants to view life full circle. A must event for those who are ready to face reality."
634,"Interesting, scary, touching","Having seen many catacombs I have never seen one like this.The bodies are on display in their burial clothes & most are very well preserved. The clothing is interesting to see from a social history point of view.There are children as well as adults, but they are all shown in a decent, dignified & sympathetic way.This might not appeal to some people but it is truly worth a visit.Be aware. Photography is prohibited & people were escorted out for using their cameras when I was there."
635,"Strange, but touching","Absolutely amazing experience...I don't get it how some people have doubt whether to go there or not, I am telling you this is a must see in Palerm."
636,"Interesting, but a bit Macabre","I has visited catacombs in a number of locations in Italy including Rome and Siracusa, but Palermo's display was just too much. The endless display of dead bodies hanging from the wall, including children was quite graphic. I understand the point of it being considered respectful of the dead by local religious culture, so it is not my place to criticize. The display is certainly unique, but not for the faint of heart. 6 Euro cost."
637,Reflection on mortality,"This is a gruesome and Macabre attraction and might be upsetting to some. What I found more disappointing was the lack of historical or contextual information. Without this insight into the history of the place or indeed the history of some of the people interred here it becomes little more than a freakshow. Seeing 8000 bodies in various states of decay hanging off the walls is definitely a memorable experience but felt more voyeuristic than respectful and, once the shock wears off, it left me wishing I had gained more insight into this strange part of Palermo's history."
638,One of the strangest places I have ever been,"I‚Äôve never seen such a place before! It‚Äôs kind of scary but interesting at the same time. You should go there, if you have enough time. Entrance is not that expensive - 5‚Ç¨ I guess"
639,Fascinatingly macabre sight,"The Catacombs are quite simply amazing..... being an archaeologist who has worked with human remains on many occasions I found the catacombs to be a fascinating!! but be warned if you are squemish this might not be one for you!! Several of the other tourists who were there at the time I was looked horrified and quite distressed. most of the mummies are suspended from hooks on the wall and are in various states of preserve with some still having well preserved clothes, skin and hair. Others haven't held up so well and are falling to peices. Overall the catacombs gives a fascinating insight into clothing styles and attitudes to death in Palermo's past.  The mummies include small babies and children... most notable is the well preserved body of a two year old girl interred in 1920... she simply looks like she is just sleeping. I found it overall a very humbling experience to visit here, but i can see how it might be un-nerving for individuals who are uncomfortable with death and their own mortality.  Before entry you are asked not to take pictures as the catacombs are a cemetery... respect for the dead.  This however did not stop several people I saw taking photos and video..... which completley infuriated me...... If you do visit here, please have the respect not to take photos... these are the remains of peoples relatives please treat them as so! not only is ignoring the request to refrain from photography disrespectful it is also potentially damaging; the light from flash photography damages the pigments in the clothing of these mummies!"
640,"Spooky, Creepy, Interesting, a must see",I have always wanted to visit this place and was extremely excited about seeing Rosalia Lombardo. On entering the vaults it was very different to what I was expecting as it was cool and clean and not musty smelling at all. It is truly fascinating to see all the centuries old clothing on some of the corpses and the poignant children's section. DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO TRY AND TAKE A SNEAKY PHOTO  as this is prohibited. One visitor didn't realise that there is CCTV everywhere and was photographing on the sly. A stern warning came over the tannoy and the lights were turned off (you do not want to be standing in pitch black surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies)
641,Medieval Horror,"Can't say this was an enjoyable place. It's exactly what you expect, preserved bodies out in the open to be looked at. There is a minor amount of history about but it is not a museum. The point is to remind us to live a fruitful life."
642,Haunting,"The catacombs are such an amazing experience. So interesting to see the way in which different cultures celebrated the dead in the past. Some are unbelievably well preserved! I would 100% recommend, but it is not for everyone!"
643,A real curiosity !,My husband read about this place and wanted to go so I went with an open mind. We also took our teenage niece and nephew with us. This is a great experience and well worth the visit. Its not for everyone esp young children. You cant take photographs inside but you can purchase a booklet from the stand outside.
644,Interesting but Boring,"I was really curious about this experience,but the atmosphere ""down-there"" felt too fusty for me. Seeing different dead bodies dressed in the interesting costumes ( in today's point of view those clothes would be viewed as costumes) didn't leave me all that impressed. I was kind of glad when we were back out. I didn't get to see that infamous body of the little girl- I guess I wasn't looking enough. But just to see her dead face all over the tourist's bills and guides in Palermo as a sort of advertisement  for this place - was morbid enough for me.I understand the historical importance of such a place and why this can be impressive to many, however I enjoy much more being surrounded by life and living creatures."
645,"A stunning place, leaves you with a lot to think about",We were not disappointed. It would be best to do a bit of research before hand to help with the visit. Palermo is a bit of a gritty city and this place for that bill.
646,Definitely different!,"We visited the catacombs because it was something different.  If you are freaked out by death or mummies, this is not a destination to visit for you.  However, if you are wanting to see some interesting history, this is definitely unique.  We had a tour guide, so we were provided with a significant amount of history for the catacombs.   I am not sure you will get the info we got with out a tour guide, so definitely book a tour on trip advisor.   The mummies are really preserved well."
647,Sinister place,"You read about it.  You google the images.  You are fascinated by the ghoulish corpses, especially the mummified remains of the remarkably life-like child, Rosalia Lombardo.  Still, nothing really prepares you for the reality.Maybe its the musty smell of the dead -- row upon row -- organized into groups: monks, children, women, artists, priests, prelates, etc.  It was certainly an unforgettable experience.  And I won't lie.  I did have at least one disturbing dream after our visit.Of the four of us who paid admission, one lasted no more that three minutes and had to leave.  It's not for everyone but it certainly leaves an indelible impression.  And it really gets you thinking.  We must have been lucky, because when we arrived (in the morning) there was no line-up.  Photos are not permitted but the gift shop has plenty of graphic postcards.  Go figure."
648,Espresso Capucino,One of the most wierd bizarre but totally engrossing sights in the whole of Italy.  Not for the faint hearted - but you will not forget this easily.  A bit out of the way but well worth the journey.
649,A 5 for bizarreness and creepiness,"7,000 mummified bodies of the Palermo elite and Friars of the religious order. Worth a visit. I would recommend - walk right to the very end of Via Cappucina and it is on the right of the Piazza"
650,Absolutely fascinating,You won‚Äôt see anything like this place anywhere else! We thought we would be going in and seeing graves and crypts and when we went round the corridor we were shocked. It was so interesting and not what we expected! My dad was talking about it for days afterward! We got there 15 minutes before closing and we‚Äôre still allowed in although we could have gone round for longer but they sounded an alarm to get us out which scared the heck out of me. I agree with another reviewer that you should be given an informational leaflet or something when you arrive so you know the backstory as we had to look it up on the taxi ride home but it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit if you have a morbid curiosity
651,A unique and amazing underground world,"After the history, the architecture, the mosaics, the markets and the trattorias, visiting something so outlandishly different has its attraction. There's nothing pretty about this assortment of dead people hanging from the wall or lying on shelves or in boxes, like zombies, but if you happen to be in a reflective mood it has its value. Don't take the kids, and if you're ageing it may be a good idea to give it a miss. It a bit like Palermo itself, a reminder that all glory must pass. Compelling therefore for the same reason that Palermo is."
652,"Grisly, yet fascinating!","Most of the mummies, skeletons and artifacts are not in very good shape anymore. The tour guide was well informed but quite rude when people wanted to take a picture. The place should get a tune-up to get me in again."
653,"i""ll give it a one","What a marvellous place! This is a crypt underneath an old monastery, where in the 16thC, the monks discovered they could mummify their dead. And they did. By the 17thC it started to be fashionable (not sure why) to be entombed there after death. The result is seen here; 8000 dressed mummies, including the rich, powerful, families and children. If you can stomach the mummies in various death throes, you will not be disappointed. This is such an interesting tableau of life, value and death over the past 4 or so centuries. It takes about 1/2 hour to walk around, depending on how much you want to stand and wonder, and at only 3 Euros, it's an unusual thing to do."
654,"Skeletons on display, macabre yet fascinating","A bizarre experience ! The catacombe houses around 8000 skeletons in their burial nooks/coffins, most dressed in the finery of the day. There are sections for men, women, priests, children and virgins ‚Ä¶. They date back to the 1700‚Äôs - an incredible display. Entry costs 4 Euro - worth every penny !"
655,"Seen one , seen all .",We walked from the center of town to the Catacombs. It was a bit of a walk but certainly doable and safe.  We had been to the Capuchin Church in Rome and thought this would be an interesting comparison.  I am =not sure what I expected but this is beyond words. I was amazed by the number and level of preservation of these bodies.   They are arranged in corridors and are obviously well cared for and respected with efforts made to identify the remains. The last body interred was in 1920 and is a 2 year old child who looks almost like a doll. It was a memorable visit.I would not bring young children!!!!!!
656,Well worth going,"This was our first visit to a Catacomb. We have heard of catacombs in Rome and other places (including in Paris) but have never visited one. This was an interesting experience, but it is not for everyone."
657,Interesting experience,"You have to be ready for what you will see.  It's worth a visit--there are bodies everywhere, propped up and clothed.  Everything is neat and tidy, that is, there is respect shown to the deceased.  Definitely worth a visit."
658,"HMM, WHAT TO SAY.....","While it was very interesting, I found it quite disturbing to see all the skeletons of so many monks."
659,Give it a second though before visiting,"Fascinating but a bit macabre. Yes, there are dead bodies and yes, it's part of the history of the city but in hindsight I shouldn't have visited it. It felt a bit disrespectful being there as a tourist."
660,Dance with the death,"This is not the place for the faint-hearted. The catacombs contain a naturally occurring substance that mummifies bodies so the Palermitans deposited their dead on shelves and on walls. The area is divided into sections for nobility, priests, families etc. and includes the skeletons of several children. It certainly makes an impact and reminds the visitor of his own mortality !!"
661,Oh so very creepy.,Definitely worth the visit - a different experience to see the mummies lining the wall and so close.  It was a hot day when we went and even though it was under ground it was still hot so take a portable fan with you if you have one! This is one of those places that you will talk about later.
662,DO IT!!!!!!!,"Row after row of skeletons most dressed in their finest attire, family groupings, professional associations, church hierarchy, creepy and interesting"
663,Creepy but a must see,"Many catacombs have only the slots cut in the stone where the corpses once rested but this one is very different. Basically they are halls of hanging corpses - fastened by the neck to pegs on the walls. The skeletons are dressed as they were when they were brought to this resting place and much of the material - dresses and suits etc - have survived better than their owners.Photography is forbidden which is sad since the memory of places like this fade quickly and as always, the guide books don't show what you might want to photograph.Well worth a visit if you are not that squeamish - but leave the kids behind, this place is not for young impressionable minds."
664,Unique Attraction,It's a bit out of the way and up a hill so catch bus 124 and walk down. Jaw dropping stuff. Visit the graveyard next to it as well to see how Scilians take care of their loved ones graves
665,Ghoulish interesting.,Until we were inside I hadn't realised that this was no ordinary collection of bones. Here we have preserved complete bodies still dressed in their funeral garments. Some have survived better than others but many seem as if they have just closed their eyes in sleep and been forgotten for many years.  Some were only placed here in the 1920s. Many still have their hair intact or perfect nails while whole families can be found displayed together in death. After my initial shock I was fascinated especially by the care with which some had been dressed for this final event. Napoleonic soldiers still wear their colourful uniforms and priests their vestments. The story behind how and why they are here is an amazing story.
666,Amazing & not to be missed!!!,"One thing to say before I even start: if you are faint-hearted, this place is not right for you. You'll see hunfreds of corpses and skeletons and mummies and bones everewhere. Old people as well as kids and babies. And they are real.It was one of the coolest and at the same time stragest sxperiences of all my life.Definitely worth a visit!!"
667,Dressed up skeletons of loved ones,"It was interesting to see the corpses in standing position - not what I expected. Mostly skeletons, but some faces preserved, and various clothes fading - it was all fascinating. The entry fee is small, so it‚Äôs worth the 15-20-minute visit."
668,Not to be missed,A somewhat macabre experience viewing 8000 preserved bodies including a perfectly preserved 3-year old child. The bodies were all catalogued and gave an insight into 19th century dress.
669,Walk among the dead,We went on a Sunday and it was open in case anyone wonders about hours. We didn't look up much history about the place but it was still interesting to see. I suggest understanding it a bit more.. it will probably be more fun to you if you do.
670,Impressing,It was a quite exciting visit at Palermo Capuchins Catacombs.Not for everyone and don't go there if you are very sensitive.Long lines of preserved bodies from last few centuries. It's difficult to say that it is amazing but truly the numbers and the fact that there are bodies all around is astounding.
671,Bizarre and creepy.,"I've been to catacombs before but this was a real wow. It's worth the visit just to see the unusual way they hung the dead, and the beautiful little girl. We had a guide so it added tremendously to what we were viewing."
672,Eery and fascinating.,"Very strange...great if you have a morbid fascination with dusty mummies though! Our particular favourite was the old boy dressed in his naval uniform. I must say that the section on children was a little heart-wrenching. As another reviewer rightly pointed out, perhaps not the best place to visit if you have young(ish) children."
673,Very interesting,"Entering I was surprised how light, clean and quiet the place is.  Also surprised how well laid out and well presented the clothed corpse are.  After walking down a couple of gangways with corpse on each side, from adult to children, from very young to old, but all very wealthy at the time of their existence to have been able to preserve their bodies or that of their loved ones - I felt I had seen enough.  I whizzed down a couple more gangways, then left without seeing anymore. All the while I was wondering what makes us want to pay to come and see corpses.  In bygone days it would have been called the macabre circus."
674,Probably not for children,I would never take a child there. And I think it should not be a place classified as a tourist attraction. I felt very bad looking at those copses and skeletons. I would not like anyone from my family being exposed like that. I left before 3 minutes feeling desgastes and heavy hearted.
675,A must!,"It takes a couple of buses to get here but it is worth the effort. The catacombs are expansive with several hundred ""residents"" on display. Because this is a reverent sacred place, photos are not permitted although there always seem to be a few self entitled individuals who‚Ä¶"
676,"""Dreadful but interesting""","A strange but really well exhibited section of the rich and religious of Sicily who are ""immortalised"" through their embalming at these catacombs"
677,Extraordinary experience,"Although I can see the historical interest that brings tour groups to the catacombs, I also found it disturbing and disrespectful of the remains of the people contained there. It is a gruesome place. The story the docent tells about the dripping rooms is gruesome as well.  I could see facial expressions on some of the corpses hanging on the walls and found the means of displaying them distasteful. I agree with other reviewers that do not recommend bringing children here. I did not stay for the duration of the tour either."
678,"Macabre place, not to be missed!","This is something you will not see anywhere. Essentially the catacombs hold the final remains of about 8000 folk.What is a amazing is that the bodies have been dressed up in their clothes (suits, dresses, habits etc) and hang off the walls - so you end up walking down corridors with all the bodies 'standing' up as if watching you.Many of the bodies have been preserved to some degree as the monks used to 'drain' the bodies of internal fluids leaving a shell that was washed, dried, treated with vinegar and filled with straw. Later other more sophisticated techniques were used.One of the last bodies to be preserved was a little girl called Rosalia in 1920 and it is quite eerie to see her little preserved body in a glass coffin down in the crypts. Entry was a bargain ‚Ç¨3. It is closed during lunch (1 pm - 3pm).From Piazza Independenza (near Cappella Palatina) it is about a 15 min walk. Alternatively take bus #327 from the Piazza, ride down Via Cappuccini and get off at the intersection with Via Pindemonte. [The bus driver will tell you as so many get on the bus to come to the catacombs]. Walk 200 m up Via Pindemonte to get to Piazza Cappuccini where the catacombs are.Be warned that photographs are not allowed and there are cameras down in the catacombs. If someone is seen taking pictures, the caretaker shouts over the loudspeakers and sets off an alarm sound. Still many do seem to get away with taking some sneaky shots. Alternatively you can buy a little book of postcards which has photos of all the most fascinating sights down in the catacombs."
679,Extraordinary,"This was a weird experience. Well worth a visit, everyone in the family enjoyed it. Personally I found it macabre and rather uncomfortable. It would make a great horror movie setting!"
680,A different ecperienc,Wow. Got to be seen to be believed. Macabre but definitely worth a visit. Well worth the 3 euro entrance fee
681,Very cool to see,"went here on a whim. This is a museum which was originally the burial place of Capuchin monks and then over time expanded to include local people from Palermo. Skeletons of me, women and children all dressed up. After a while it gets boring. If you like the macabre go, if not find something else to see."
682,Totally Weird,"This catacomb is probably one of the I've ever seen.  Displays of probably hundreds of bodies are neatly shown in vertical positions, horizontal as well, and many are still dressed to their finest. The expressions on their faces are all so different.  Sections on family divisions, children, etc., add to the interest.  The place is ghoulish in a way, but also done in a very respectful way. Young children love it but some may get nightmares. I'd allow about  30-60 minutes for the entire exhibit, which is extensive."
683,Incredible !!! Could be hard for young kids,"We had read about this place and decided to go. I didn't realise quite how many bodies there were. It was extremely strange, but at the same time incredibly fascinating. Some of the bodies were only bones, but some still had their teeth and amazingly some still had hair - not just on their head but facial hair and eyebrows.It was sad to see so many children, especially the tiny ones in the children's chapel.It's definitely an odd place, but definitely worth a visit. Probably not with your children.You're not supposed to take photos by the way!"
684,Bizarre,"You would have thought it would be a very interesting place, though, in a very depressed and miserable part of the city, the Catacombe is a very weird store of fully day dressed dead people. Some really quite recent - circa 100 years. You couldn't really call it a display - just rows of racks of skeletal forms in threads. So an intriguing idea, but not enough context and information - so - meh."
685,You keep asking yourself: why??,"What were they thinking? !!! Amazing display of thousands of mummified dead people; men, women, babies, virgins, monks... needs to be seen"
686,Not for everyone,"I have wanted to see this ever since I first heard of it a few years ago, It is the most remarkable privilege to see the mummified bodies assembled in this underground cemetery over a period of 500 years. As an artist, I have a particular interest in death and death rituals. I imagine it could be disconcerting to come across this almost by accident, as had some of the visitors I spoke to. But it is a completely different experience from the catacombs in Paris and Rome that I have visited and repays serious interest. While in Palermo I also visited and can recommend the fine art museum in Palazzo Abatellis and the Antonio Pasqualino puppet museum, which has a fascinating international collection."
687,Very interesting,"I have visited the Capuchin crypts in rome, but they are nothing compared to this! The history alone is so interesting and it's hard to imagine that all these corpses were once living human beings. It's somewhat macabre, but fascinating at the same time. The clothes worn by the dead also give you an idea of what the people of that era were wearing. Not sure it's a place for little kids, but well worth a visit if you are in Palermo. Also I know you're not supposed to take photos but I did sneak a couple."
688,Amazing ,"It is morbid, but I have never see so many dead bodies!  They are propped up alongside the walkways by their families in their best costumes for all to see.  Simply amazing."
689,Very interesting experience!,"I too had mixed feelings about this place, but I'm glad I saw it, because I had never seen anything like it before."
690,A macabre visit ... yet intriguing,"If your expectations are to be either thrilled by the ambience or spiritually lifted by the presence of death, forget it.You will find rows upon rows of skeletons amassed like old rifles in an old mothballed army armoury."
691,"Very interesting, also for (small) children","Just kidding! It is not what you expect at first. It takes a few seconds to understand that you are actually in the right place. Don't take a tour. Go on your own or get a bus and take a five minute walk. People are friendly and helpful. Do not waste your money on a taxi. The catacombs cost 3 euros pp. The must-see is Rosalie. A simple stroll through most of the site is all that is required. I did not find it overwhelming or macabre. I did find that I was a little intrusive at times, being uninvited by a host of past lives left decrept in a state for veiwing that they would never have agreed upon, given the choice. So be respectful! These souls are giving you a respect for life! Your life. Enjoy it! Go see them."
692,Spooks!,"Some would say that I should expect to see open mummies on a public display if I choose to go and see the Catacombs. That is the purpose of the visit of this place, after all. However it seemed to be for me too much packed with amazingly big amount of mummies on the small surface. It says there are ca 8000 bodies inside, monks, professors, kids and newborn babies. And that is true. Each of the mummy is close to each other, barely few centimetres away. It took us ca 15- 20 min to see all. It may be attractive to others but not something I would recommend for families with small kids (which we saw inside, btw)"
693,Not what I expected,"If you think that a visit to your dead friends, all lined up in their Sunday best despite being reduced to skeletons, would be cool, they you will appreciate how the people of Palermo felt a couple of hundred years ago. You will only need 20 minutes to visit this strange but not particularly creepy place.Cool i temperature too, and a distinctive way to view past fashions, the bone and in some cases, mummified faces look back at you in quiet resignation."
694,"Well, what can I say?","I'd give this place a ONE  because the times posted for admission are dead (pun Intended ) WRONGAfter checking the open hours on both trip adviser and the catacombs website, the afternoon/evening hours are advertised as being 3:00pm until 12:30am.WELL, the REAL hours, as of this date, September 30th, 2015,  are 0900-1300 and 1500 until 1800.Thought I had plenty of time and was tuned away at 18:10.Well, I'am not going back, and I am DEAD certain of that!!Dead right, dead people!!"
695,The place is a little bit creepy but pretty cool,"I went to Catacombs without exactly knowing what to expect. We arrived in afternoon and had to wait as it was closed until 15 h. There is no photography allowed once inside, but as I later on saw there are many visitors who have made pictures after all. Entrance fee is 3 euro pp. The catacombs consists of a couple of narrow underground paces. which are full with dead bodies still dressed in original clothing. I could hardly believe that the fabrics / textiles are left in such good conditions while bodies were gone and most of the time only skeletons remain.I come in contact with died people in my work more often, but this time I didn't feel too comfortable. Thought it may look great to see how a body is conserved over time, I felt like it should not be exploited as a touristic spot for my holiday. So After having seen the first small corridor I started walking through the catacombs more quickly and wanted to get out of this sinister place. Of course just my personal feeling."
696,Strangely fascinating ,This is probably one of the spookiest sights I've seen and unlike any catacombs Ive been too.  There are hundreds of skeletons in various states of preservation all still dressed in clothes from the 17th 18th and 19th century.  Its super eery and probably not for kids but it was an incredible glimpse back into history and a lot more than just 'the dead'.  It was also inexpensive and not crowded even in the hight of summer.  I would have really enjoyed a bit more information but once you've seen lots of exhibits and paid for lots of tours I didn't bother with a guide book which I regret.  Cant take pics either‚Ä¶.shame
697,Fascinating place if you come with an open mind and heart,"It's not as gruesome as one might imagine, really more like strolling through a dusty mannequin factory, the human facsimiles strung cheek by jowl along the length of one corridor after another, dressed in their social station's best and as suited the occasion of each one's stepping off into eternity. Indeed, just as in life, the mummies are segregated by profession and station-in-life, rank upon rank rank! A danse macabre! It would be humorous - in the gallows sense - were it not a sin against propriety to poke fun at the folly and pomposity of human vanity where matters of the ""dear departed"" are concerned. Certainly, it owes something to ancient man's concept of setting off into the after-life well accoutered, and as such is a fascinating study of our more recent progenitor's concept of ""life beyond death"". Reactions will vary: the superstitious and squeemish will be appalled should they venture here; the pious - both genuine and hypocritical - will offer up a prayer, the one quiet,  the other ostentatious; the judgmental will be much at home in their approval of the ""No Photos"" prohibition, despite the fact that the official website - sacred-destinations.com - freely displays their charges in situ, like so many religious frescos. A more reasoned approach would be to see these human remains not as a roadside attraction but as a genuine opportunity, like any other archeological dig, a window on the past and this one with a very real potential benefit to the present, to the living.  A charnel house in such a state of good repair is a treasure trove of medical research material given what it can offer to the understanding and interpretation of the human condition over time. These mummies are a medical time capsule and should be studied as closely as King Tut. As appalling a notion as such might  be to the pious of both stripes! In this manner they might well earn their keep more fully than at present where they now exist a kind of sideshow creep show where one pays at a turnstile for a peep, wherther drawn by thrill or sanctity or a gauche curiosity."
698,Disturbing,"While I enjoyed this very unusual experience, it wouldn't be for everyone.  It was a somewhat long walk from downtown, but doable.  The entrance fee was modest, 3 Euros.  Entering this underground maze, you view hundreds on preserved bodies that range in various conditions.  It's an experience, but now I've seen one catacomb, I doubt I will bother with another."
699,A must see,"If you are not from southern Italy, you havn't seen anything like this before. Don't come here to take pictures though: it would be considered as a lack of respect."
700,Like exploring a graveyard's wardrobe.,"Only a small exhibit but quite fascinating in a macabre way.Well worth an hour of your time. To think the corpses etc were 200 years old , but some were remarkably intact.The site is actually a place of remembrance and once you get round this, it becomes less spooky.One little girl is displayed as if she died last week, remarkably intact."
701,A must do when in Palermo,"We visited here following a recommendation and while I'm glad we did visit the catacombs, it certainly was an experience. It's not the sort of place you could spend hours as it's incredibly eerie - particularly, the wonderfully-preserved child encased towards the end of the chamber. If you're in Palermo, it's worth a look - but I don't think I would actively recommend this to family or friends."
702,"Wonderfully creepy, even if the groups ruin it","We went to visit the catacombs because we‚Äôd read about them, but being down there is a whole different story. The atmosphere with hundreds of dead bodies surrounding you takes you to a weird place. I really enjoyed the visit, and Rosalia is just incredible. You have to see this."
703,Fascinating site ruined by noisy tourists,"An unforgettable experience. Macabre to some and moving for others. The catacombs are easily walkable (although mostly uphill) from central Palermo although in places the curbs are narrow and so you have to watch for passing traffic. They ask that you don‚Äôt take photographs although many do. It takes about 45 to 60 mins to get around the catacombs, depending on how busy it is. There is also a Taxi tank outside. The ticket office sells postcards and books of photographs."
704,Creepy!,"Visiting the catacombs is certainly interesting - but not everyone is like that. It is strange to see so many corpses in such a small space. There are adults, children, families ... Lying or hanging figures in various stages of ""decomposition"". Maybe scary, maybe repulsive - but also fascinating. It is a pity that the main ""attractions"" - little Rosalia - is in a glass coffin in which there is hardly visible. We were here in June - outside the main tourist season - and the catacombs were about five people besides us. Parking directly in front of the monastery were no problems, we left the car there all day"
705,"Interesting History, Watch Thier Website Movie To Get Background","We visited the catacombs with a tour, so we were moved through at a moderate pace.  The area open to the public is much smaller than I thought.  It is also not underground, as I also had thought..it is just a about 10 steps down from the road height.  The catacombs are actually very well lit, with natural light.  It was not scary for me...and I was worried.  There is the whole 'thought' that these are mummies.  People were there with young children and no one appeared  'troubled'.  I am glad I went, but not certain it was on a 'must do'.  It is set up very touristy.  No photos were allowed."
706,An Uncomfortable Visit,Underground tunnels filled with rows of skeletons of various ages. All the skeletons are dressed  and at various stages of decay. Ten minutes here is more than enough time. Do not bring children.
707,One weird experince,"This has to be the most eerie place I've visited. Hard to describe really. Corridors of skeletons hanging on the walls, most with rotting clothes, some still with hair and remnants of skin. You half expect them to start moving any moment! Hollywood producers must have visited here and taken inspiration for some of their horror films! Certainly worth visiting.But not if you are easily offended or will suffer nightmares."
708,Very different,"For horror-movies fans only. It's nothing more than a maze of corridors filled with skeletons: gave me the creeps, in addition it is in a remote location, and walking there is passing through sketchy streets..."
709,Not for the faint hearted,"What can I say?  Wall to wall mummies, in their burial dress, posed, categorized by ""virgins"", ""priests"" and whatnot.  This is not your bandage covered Egyptian kind of mummy, I can tell you!  I thought I had seen a lot ...and then I came here.  I recommend it.  You won't forget it."
710,Read up first,"Yes you are about to walk down corridors full of skeletons, many still wearing the clothes of the time they died in. Some still have hair and dried skin. After the initial shock of being surrounded by so many creepy faces leaning out towards you as you walk past you do begin to take an extra interest in their clothing. I wouldn't advise it to children under 14 and likewise to people over the age of 60/65."
711,Different and worth a visit,We only went into a small part of the catacombs as my daughter and I both felt rather uncomfortable. Being surrounded by hundreds of dead people is not exactly entertainment.
712,Ghoulish visit..........,"These are the most spectacular catacumbs I ever seen. The preserve more than 8000 skeletons, a lot are hanging on the wall, still dressed with their clothes. The top attraction is the coffin of Rosalia, wtih the remains of a 2 year old girl. She is so well preserved that it looks like she's sleeping.Be aware that it's not allowed to take pictures in the catacombs"
713,A Little Unnerving,"I didn't realise when I went that (like a lot of things in Sicily) there's a period in the morning where it's open, a lunchtime closure, and then reopens from 1500 to 1700.Quite an interesting experience, apparently there are around 8000 corpses down there!I wouldn't personally recommend taking young children down there, but it's not overly creepy or frightening. The actual catacombs are very well lit, both naturally and artificially, and the passageways aren't claustrophobic or constricted. There's also no chance that you could accidentally come into contact with one of the corpses.Entry is 3 Euros, guide books extra. I didn't buy one, but it might well be worth it as there is no signage or guidance on offer down there. Photography and filming is strictly prohibited and rigorously enforced via video surveillance. Altogether worth a visit I would say. It shouldn't take more than an hour to get around."
714,Fascinating but nor for the faint-hearted,a bit creepy but really outstanding. it's like seeing people hundreds of years ago almost coming alive... very interesting. I sure am glad I went there.
715,Certainly Different,"Wasn't sure what to expect with this one but it was sobering, sad and reminding of our mortality although lucky to be living in modern times.Worth a visit"
716,a must-see,"Unfortunately, we only had 10mins to whizz around because the opening times in my guide book were wrong, so check their website. 3 euro entry. I wish there were signs in English and information on how the bodies have been preserved, because I learnt more from the internet after the visit.  I doubt they know now after so long, but I would have liked to have known what year the bodies were from, how they died, their names etc- at least on a few.    I wouldn't take children there as its very creepy.   I found it sad how some are preserved with hair, skin & features, yet others have contorted facial features looking like they are screaming out in pain!   Majority have old clothes or rags which are falling apart & some were just a a pile of bones hanging on wires.  Majority of the display racks looked like they could fall down at any time, & everything looked dusty & filthy. I don't know if/how they could clean the corpses & their clothes, but it all looked unkempt. I saw flies buzzing around which was worrying!  I don't know what I was expecting, but this certainly wasn't a highlight of my trip to Sicily.  Worth a look if you have plenty of time in Palermo, but if you miss it, the pictures & information on the internet was far more informative."
717,Shut when we arrived,"A macabre, fascinating and at times rather sad insight into another world, bygone times and lives lived and lost/taken, sometimes far too soon. The catacombs house around 2,000 skeletons and mummified bodies, making it the largest and the most extraordinary collection of mummies in the world. The mummified body of Rosalia Lombardo is especially well preserved and is a poignant reminder of just how many children died around a century ago from what are now largely preventable diseases. Not for the squeamish or sensitive, but unmissable in my view."
718,Moving and bizarre,"The catacombes in Palermo is wild.  I have never been so freaked out.  Being a walking dead fan, this place will really give you the jitters.  It's amazing to see all the dead people hanging either from the walls or laying down.  You can still see the skin on some of the freshest ones including hair.  They have one room dedicated all to children and then one to the virgins.  They looked the worst.  So much for being elevated to the top of the class in this place.  They are very strict about taking pictures and do have hidden cameras. So don't be a bozo like this one tourist who got berated over a loud speaker about his lack of respect for the dead.  I totally agree.  You have to be respectful.  I would think twice about bringing small impressionable children.  I think I would have had night mares if I had seen this as a child.  I have been to the catacombes in a number of places in Rome and Spain, and throughout italy and Sicily, but this one to me was the most vivid.  The age of the dead dates only back to around 1600.  I think the first one was in 1598.  It's fascinating  seeing the clothing that still hangs on most of them.  If in Palermo, this is a must.  But I might recommend taking a taxi because it's a long and uphill walk."
719,A PALERMO MUST ,"Why do we as a species like to look at our own dead?I thought about that long and hard as we spent 40 minutes or so wandering around this creepy but compelling place.Perfect for teenagers to help them take on board some facts of life (death), and fascinating in the way it is organised - by family, by profession, by age etc."
720,Thought provoking...but not for the faint-hearted,"Stepping beneath the city you'll find rows and rows of the dead from 1599 to 1920, you will find monks, nuns, virgins, woman , children and military commanders, at the end incased in a glass  sarcophagus you will find Rosalia Lombardo a 2 year old italian girl who died in 1920 from pneumonia she is preserved perfectly and seems like she's just taking a nap. I travelled to Italy in july 2013 and made  333km(207mi) journey from where i was staying to this catacomb, it several hours and a bus, boat, train and taxi. A must see if traveling to Palermo! except for the squeamish, and fainthearted..."
721,Interesting and Thought Provoking,"Underground crypt stacked with hundreds of corpses. Most of them are no more than skeletons but a certain amount of mummified flesh and hair still adheres to some. For the most part they're displayed upright, in their original clothes. There are monks, professional men, women and even a number of children. It's a ghoulish experience because these corpses look like something from a zombie movie but it's also very moving because you can't ignore the fact that they were once people. It's particularly poignant when you get to the children's gallery. I can't say I enjoyed the visit but I was deeply affected by it."
722,Must been seen,"The Catacombs are one of Palermo's most famous attractions, but walking through the rows of skeletons in various states of decay leaves mixed nimpressions. On the one hand it a perfect ""memento mori"", a reminder of our own fleeting existence on earth. But it also creates a feeling of behaving somewhat perversely by gazing upon the remains of people who departed this earth between the early 17th and late 19th centuries. Carefully divided into sections for professionals, priests, ladies etc, the corpses are mostly dressed, be it in rags or full suits, ladies often even wear gloves and bonnets! A few bodies were carefully and successfully embalmed and look almost lifelike. The visit is not for the sensitive or those given to bad dreams; and, most of all, don't take little children in there with you, as one particularly smart lady did during my visit. The poor child kept on screaming with fear; for children it's a nightmare!!!"
723,Don't miss the Catacombs of Capuchins,"I've been there twice and each time I adored it. It's true that visiting a catacomb can sound gruesome but hey it's a catabomb. What do you expect. I still regret not going last time I was in Palermo. As a history buff I was facinated by the clothing still being on the skeleton. Rather it's the clergy man, noble man or peasant. It's like walking through a time capsule."
724,Grimly fascinating,"A must-see in Palermo. Thousands of skulls, corpses, bones on display in this underground labyrinth... very fascinating. Look for the baby girl Rosalia Lombardo while you wander in the catacombs."
725,Uf... that was smt ,"I wish I would have either had some more information before visiting or bought some information about the catacombs before we went through as there is really nothing inside that gives any information or history about it. Probably not for everyone, but interesting yet unsettling all at the same time."
726,Weird....,"So...my hot Latina and I decided to take a break from the normal wine tasting and staple European attractions and excursions and take a walk on the wild, and relatively creepy side in Palermo and visited the Capuchin Catacombs. There are literally 8000+ preserved and mummified bodies here...some so well preserved, the skin and hair are perfectly intact. The catacombs are split into sections...priests, scholars, children, virgins, teachers, and so on, and clearly the main feature is the two year old girl who was the last to be preserved in the 1920's, if I remember correctly. She looks as if she is sleeping. Her skin is a little darker than would be if she were alive, but her hair is still as blonde as when she passed, her eyelids are still shut, her facial expression is peaceful, and she looks completely frozen in time! You would think there would be a strange odor in this place, but there is not. They keep it remarkably clean and organized. The toilets, on the other hand were filthy and like a lot of other places in Europe, they didn't stock toilet paper, there was no soap to wash your hands, and the toilets had no seats! Make sure to bring TP and hand sanitizer!!! As a matter of fact...everywhere in Europe travel with TP and hand sanitizer!!!"
727,Strange Experience,"It was a  surreal experience. Walking along the corridors watching all these people who were just like me, but beyond the realm of life. A very humbling and meaningful experience. This place is very powerful."
728,Do not confuse it with the catacombs placed just beside it,"very imformative, but not for the squeemish.  easily accessed, staff were very knowledgable and were happy to discuss any questions i had. Most of the information was written in italian it would have been nice to be able to read who and how some of the people had died."
729,Unforgettable experience.,We visited here whilst visiting Palermo for the day from our cruise ship. To be very fair I have never seen anything like this before and it could be described as interesting (row after row of dressed skeletons). But for me and a friend it was a little disturbing and I'm still not sure how I feel about it. Definitely something different!
730,Seriously wierd,"This experience was by far the highlight of my trip to Palermo, one of the creepiest place I've ever seen.Reach the convent by walk iit's about 30 minutes journey from the historic center, not challenging, once you get to the convent you pay the ticket at the entrance, about ‚Ç¨ 2.It is a strong experience, I do not think for everyone, walking into a basement surrounded by thousands of mummies on display a few centimeters can be very disturbing.I did not try any discomfort.But do not take pictures, the basement is literally surrounded by security cameras, someone will always check and look at you, I personally have been scolded by the receptionist monk by microphone while I was hiding myself to take my first photo ... Well I managed to get the next 100 quite hidden but beware ... someone is watching you, That one and it's alive ..I highly recommend visiting the room which houses the 6 year old girl died in 1921 and perfectly embalmed, she seems to be still sleeping sweetly, it was something indescribable. The tour lasts 30 minutes or a little more.Truly must do experience."
731,Macabre but fascinating,"Incorrectly termed 'catacombs'; this is a very moving part of Palermo's history.  With 8000 or so 'bodies' it is incredibly moving.  Entry is just ‚Ç¨3 and the postcard guide is also ‚Ç¨3 so there is absolutely no need to take photos - after all, that would be somewhat disrespectful as this is place of rest.  In varying states of decomposition and mummification there is a huge range of examples of the classes of people entombed therein.  The section for babies is particularly moving.  I didn't find it sad however, to me it seems a more fitting way of paying respect and homage rather than burial or cremation.  Perhaps not suitable for all children, those who can understand the story behind the catacombs may benefit from exposure to this side of mortality.It is macabre yet not ghoulish.Note, it is closed between 1300h and 1500h so do allow for that in your itinerary.  It is also quite far to walk, but if you make this your second stop after Monreal working back East you should find it quite rewarding and would leave you fairly close to Castle Cuba and the museum for your next stops."
732,Unique,"I had read about the catacombs, and as we were in Palermo we decided to visit them, although my husband was not keen.  They are a long walk from central Palermo and as it was very hot we took a taxi.  There was a long queue but it was not expensive to get in.  Once inside it was not as grim as I had feared - the corridors were well lit and airy, but the bodies served as a reminder of one's mortality and it was a disturbing thought.  Saddest of all were the babies, including the body of little Rosalia who died in 1920.  I had read that some people had said that they had seen her eyes open and close, but I imagine that this was a figment of their imagination.  Certain other bodies were well preserved, but the skeletons appeared to be screaming, and this was not a happy sight.There was a sad and sober atmosphere and one of the officials reprimanded people for laughing, asking them to show a little respect for the dead.  This is not a fairground attraction and should not be treated as such.  It is forbidden to take photographs.  We were somewhat disturbed by the fact that one of the tour guides was accompanied by a little girl who appeared somewhat ethereal.  It was all rather bizarre.Since our visit my husband and I have been haunted by the experience and I would not recommend it for people of a depressive or sensitive nature."
733,Weird but very interesting,"We had seen some mention of the catacombs in a TV programme about Sicily and were determined to visit them. I am so glad that we did and as we arrived early we were able to wander around quietly. The displays were arranged by profession, by sex and by age - quite moving to see the way that they had been dressed after death. This place is special and should be treated with reverence. We left quickly when the coach parties arrived."
734,"Unsettling, Chilling, Symbolizing the Brevity of Life","If you like the macabre, you'll like this place.  It's got fully dressed skeletons that are standing up.  It's a short visit."
735,"Little freaky, odd, decided I want to be cremated","Some people are drawn to the Catacombs but I found the experience to be a bit morbid and depressing. Not in a scary way but simply unimpressive . Dead men, women and children. Theirs corpses carefully positioned. Halls are adorned with bodies hanging from the walls, dried up and some stuffed. The air is damp, heavy and moldy. Wouldn't go again and do not recommend. Palermo has a lot of life to offer for us to waste time with the dead ."
736,visit to the past,A somewhat macabre tourist attraction but lots of history.  Catacombs started by the monks in 16th century and bodies are in categories and were originally maintained by relatives of deceased.
737,If you want to see Tim Burton's movie in real life visit here,"I dont understand why anybody should like it to be shown like that after death. The categories are strange, like presenting virgins and to show little kids bodies like that, is more than without any Moral. I am sorry i dont understand this kind of religion."
738,Interesting beyond belief,"I felt a bit guilty for wanting to go and see these catacombs because I wondered how all these people would have felt if they had known that their bodies would become a spectacle for tourists to gawp at, a hundred or so years later. But, obviously, that didn't stop me going. Partly because death is so sanitised in the modern world and something we don't really see, and curiosity (plus being sick of the rest of Palermo-sorry) got the best of me. When we went in, there were only a couple of other people in there, and that was a good thing because it felt quiet and respectful. The bodies on the walls strung up often by their necks seemed the hardest to understand why anyone would want to do this to their dead-it just looked uncomfortable and gruesome. The bodies which were laid down in open-sided coffins were the most spooky to walk through, for some reason. The children were small and sad. There were cool breezes blowing gently through the place which made tatters of clothing and the identifying labels flutter as you walked through, which was really unnerving.Incidentally, I couldn't understand why the shop upstairs was selling postcards of the perfectly-preserved dead 2 year old. Why would anyone want to buy that, and how is that 'respecting the dead' as all the signs remind you?This is worth a visit, but it certainly is not for everyone..."
739,"Disturbing, terrible experience - you should try it!","In all my years of travelling this is one of the most mesmerising sights I have ever witnessed. It is extremely macabre and not for the faint-hearted. This is a modest tourist attraction at only three euros per person and is about a 15 minute walk from the Cathedral. Corridors of embalmed bodies (some better preserved than others) are pinned to the walls in each of their alcoves, demonstrating the demise of our bodies after death. Some pose faces wrenched with horror and suffering, others have decayed to skeletons, and many have simply fallen to death and take no notice of the living who are masquerading through their abode.I wouldn't say this is child friendly if you have a particularly sensitive child. Some of the dead really do appear horrific as though they died in agony, others with their jutting jaws and stooping figures look somewhat comical. The bodies in the catacombs were placed her on their request - it was seen as a prestigious display. Note: This is a cemetery - have respect and do NOT take photos/videos or you will be rightly humiliated and reprimanded by the staff."
740,"This took nearly 10,000 steps!!","The reason I went to Palermo was to visit here after seeing a documentary on Rosalina Lombardo. It's a long walk and I would recommend a taxi for some. When we arrived they were closed for lunch and there is not much in the area to eat/drink, they have missed a trick here.The catacombs are interesting and the little girl really does look just asleep but it could be done with a lot more reverence and should be at present it seems like a grisly look at dead bodies hanging from the walls. It fails to impress the fact that these people should have respect and I think if this was else where in the world it would be done better. I found it worth going but maybe that's because I had seen the documentary you certainly did not get any of the history from walking around the catacombs and that's is what is sadly missing."
741,Worth the walk,"Bit of a macabre site but truly amazing, the oldest body I found was dated 1699, and the latest was in the 1920's and it looks like the little girl has just gone to sleep, amazing mix of preserved bodies worth a visit if you get fed up with the living and the normal tourist spots.Bit of a hike from the centre and some dodgy roads to cross, not good in the heat would recommend a cab unless your happy with a 25 min walk in the heat !"
742,Interesting unique experience,"Don't skip that. It's a bit of scary actually and we weren't capable to spent much time inside the catacombs, but it has that ""something completelly different"" appeal."
743,Far out but worth it!,"The catacombs are not very easy to find, but once inside, it overwhelms you to the core. A bit unorganized, but nothing major to spoil the experience. Plenty of informational leaflets in all different languages as well as audio guide. If you're into history - it is a must visit place in Palermo!"
744,Interesting and macabre at the same time!!,"The Capuchin monastery, one of the then famous and most visited of the city, for the simple reason that in this place is one of the most creepy and macabre of Palermo. In the basement are in fact perfectly kept the embalmed bodies of thousands of people, some in perfect condition. An unusual and unusual. But it is right to visit it. In addition to this strange museum it is possible to visit the small church at the side of the entrance."
745,Each to his own,"Once you've seen one skeleton hanging up you've seen them all. Made me wonder why people wanted to display themselves. It's not expensive to get in, but we only stayed for ten minutes. Closed from 12:30 to 3 when we were there."
746,Great,We visited St Sebastian s in Rome and found those catacombs fascinating so we were eager to visit here . We were unprepared for the bodies on hooks displayed as if in a Hollywood thriller . The highlight was the mummified body of a 2 year old girl. Need I say more?
747,ghoulish but interesting,"While it does show you what it promises: dried out bodies in catacombs, it doesn't have the atmosphere I associated it with. Its clean and well lit passageways take you past many skeletons and mummies, some with original clothing. Occasionally an individual body is highlighted and explained. Plenty of other tourists around as well. Photographing and filming is not allowed. They watch you on camera and once in a while 'no photo, no photo' is blurted though the PA. I suppose the 3 euro entry price is worth what is being offered but I can't help the feeling that the experience could be so much more atmospheric."
748,Research before going,"The light and airy catacombs contain 8000 corpses, many standing with the remainder in the typical horizontal position. These partially mummified or embalmed bodies include men, women and some children. Their remains of clothing show the changing fashions during the period from the seventeenth century till 1881. This site is interesting, but not necessarily enjoyable."
749,Not for the faint of heart!  Beautiful family crypts with pictures of the deceased next door.,"We were the only two as we arrived at 9am sharp.  Nothing prepared for what we saw.  It was really not for the faint hearted.  The 'exhibits' we're very compelling.  It was good that we only noticed the cemetery after we came out of the catacombs.  Then we were awestruck by the layout.  If one dares, ask for a visit to the hidden bathroom.  I was glad that I made my visit before entering the catacomb.  It was not easy to keep our thoughts from running wild."
750,Macabre Morbid Depressing,"The bodies are described as mummified, but in reality, the majority are only bones. I found how these corpses have been turned into a tourist attraction disrespectful and a little disturbing. I wondered if these people would still want to be here if they could see what it has become?That said, I still paid my money and took a look around, as it's not the sort of thing you get to see every day."
751,a scene a bit macabre,"Thousands of bodies are hanging on the walls, dressed in their dust covered 1600s finery, and some still even have skin. It's fascinating, and worth a trip to Palermo just to see it. Free parking is right in the plaza outside the building, but give the amiable keeper of the cars a Euro."
752,"Very interesting, no where near as creepy as I thought it would be.",something of the grotesque attracted me to this. In reality I didn't much care for the enterprise. Takes a couple of minutes to get what it's all about and then it's just a bit dreary.
753,"Intersting, creepy, very unexpected",If a little goulish. Not for the faint hearted but a fascinating look at how a society has taken care of their dead
754,Creepy / macabre,We visited the Catacombe dei Cappuccino while in Palermo.  It was pretty interesting although a bit macabre.  the bodies are hung on the wall clothed and 'staring' at you.
755,Macabre and repetitive,"It was deeply moving, poignant and a little disquietning. If you are easily disturbed this isn't the place for you! I found the period clothing fascinating though."
756,Bizarre ,"I had never seen anything like this. Almost 8000 mummies in one place. It was very spooky but at the same time interesting. My children thought it was great too, they were scared but intrigued about how or why all those mummies were there. The entrance fee is 3 euros and children under 12 don't pay."
757,Interesting ,"Well this was something new for us. All I kept saying was 'how bizarre'! It really is different. For some reason I couldn't see it as going around looking at dead people - to me it felt like an exhibition or something like Madame Tussauds. It was very interesting.  It does not smell damp or mouldy down there as you might think somewhere underground may do. It is quick and easy to get around, quite well done. It took us anout 45 minutes just strolling round. I am not sure about taking young children around, it may cause a few nightmares if they understand what they are looking at. Tiny ones will probably enjoy just running around the glass walkways, the over 10's no doubt might try to spook you out and giggle. Not sure about the in-betweens though, they may, like me, just think they are at an exhibition. Look at the pictures on the net first and make a judgment for your own child.Parking is right outside but be aware that there are several chaps around the front of the building showing you where to park then want 2 euro for doing so. It didn't bother us as it is all part of being in a different country. The catacombes themselves are off to the right of the huge cemetery entrance way and steps. We also spent a sunny 15 minutes walking around there looking at elaborate tombs and vaults. Many are as big as a small house. If you are in Palermo seeing the sights then it is one to go to - the Catacombe dai Cappuccini."
758,Unique,"I actually had no idea what these Catacombes were when my tour group was brought here. Once upon a time, people of means paid serious money to be drained of liquids, stuffed with straw, then dressed up to be hung on hooks on these walls so their families could visit them. As soon as I walked in I felt as if I couldn't breathe. It felt wrong to be looking at these long-dead people on display when I wasn't visiting my own loved one. Photos are not permitted there."
759,Creepy but must not be missed,I wasn't sure about this but knew that my other half wanted to see it. We visited in May. I thought it was really worth seeing and would recommend.
760,creepy but interesting,Our cruise ship was rerouted from Malta to Palermo due to bad weather so at the last minute we decided to go to the Catacombs of Palermo.The sight of 8000 skeleons and skulls in their original finery is not everyones cup of tea  but it is a fascinating one hour experience and one I would recommend . the venue is quite strict on adhering to the no photograph rule.
761,Macabre experience - source of ideas for Hollywood?,"Not for the faint of heart I suppose, but the sheer amount of bodies is amazing. The Capuchin monks realized they could profit from the crypt by selling slots, and thousands of people are interred here. The floors are glass, and so you feel like you may slide through - but it is very safe! The mummies span years and many socio-economic groups - all are dressed in clothes of the times - very interesting!"
762,creepy but well worth it,"Our young kids loved this gruesome attraction, as did we, but did comment that there could be more informative aspects of an interactive nature like a video or guide.Amazing place."
763,Confronting,"If you decide to visit the catacombs, I think you‚Äôll agree that this is one of the weirdest ‚Äútourist sites‚Äù you will have ever seen. It could be described as voyeuristic, if not lurid, but if you want to explore a huge underground vault with eight thousand mummified bodies from‚Ä¶"
764,Very curious,"Impressive, almost macabre, but a long tradition of the Capuchin monks in Palermo. Respect that it is a ""burial place"". Don't take pictures of the many corps. Maybe don't go with small children and with people who are faint at heart or that could suffer in closed underground spaces. A bit difficult to find, public transport doesn't really take you there, but ask people and they will gladly indicate the way."
765,Strange but must see,"Firstly, I‚Äôd advise walking there. You could probably use public transport, but by the time you‚Äôve waited for it, you could have got there on foot. From the Quattro Canti, it will probably take 25 mins to walk it.The place itself is fascinating, but leave your selfie stick at the hotel. No photography allowed, which is fair enough - respect for the dead and all that.I‚Äôm glad I saw it personally, but maybe don‚Äôt forgo something else to go here. It‚Äôs interesting, but not as impactful as you might expect. If you can‚Äôt make it for whatever reason, don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre lost out on something."
766,If you are Into Morbid go Visit,"We visited the Catacombs taking turns as we were with a young kid who was sleeping when we got there. I don't know which adjectives I should use to describe this place..interesting, creepy, it gives a lot to think about...The ticket costs 3‚Ç¨ and getting there requires a good 30 mins walk from the city centre . (I know there is a bus from the railway station ) .They do not provide any leaflet or explanation, but we had read something on our own before getting there. There is only a map on the wall you can see while going down the stairs  of the different categories present in the different corridors. Do not expect any explanation at all inside the catacombs .It closes for lunch between 1pm and 3pm, so organise well your timing as it would be disappointing getting there and having to rush to see something because the place closes after 30mins from your arrival (our mistake)"
767,"Macabre, weird and quite interesting!","Such a cool and different thing to do. A bit of a walk to get to, though. We met a man on a train who said that he fled this place after a few minutes due to the energy. Lol. My spouse, who absolutely hates anything scary, decided to come with me, and was perfectly fine. He refused to get as close to the bodies as I did. I was fascinated by the clothes, the uniforms, and how well preseved so many were. Make sure you see Rosalie, the last person entombed. In 1920. She looks like a doll. 99 years dead and it looks like she's just sleeping. I did not find this place or it's customs creepy in the least. Definitely goüáÆüáπ"
768,interesting but poorly preserved,"Reachable on foot from piazza independent (after being let down by bus 327). Well preserved, orderly corpses, a walk through cemetry. No smell or unpleasantness. ...just serene dry, dead people stuffed with straw.  Philosophical thought of what were the ambitions and thoughts of these persons, priests, wives,  professionals, children, etc.some fabrics are well preserved. Look out for Rosalia who was born in 1918 and died 2 years later......wonderfully preserved!No photos allowed and the area has to be approached with respect."
769,Realistic view,"Lord, this is not what one expects when visiting catacombs. In these underground recesses far from the bustle of downtown Palermo, Sicily, one finds the ancient art of embalming on display in all its eeriness. The visitor finds all sorts of deceased individuals openly displayed in their finest or most important clothing lining the walls of these catacombs. It makes one wonder, what were these Sicilians thinking. It must have been a most reverent act for these family members to permanently exhibit their deceased for all the world to see. Of course, all the world did not see but only townsfolk with enough gumption to enter these premises would visit the departed. Not many travelers or out-of-town visitors would pay homage to a stranger's dead relative. Must be somehow related to Sicily's close graphical proximity to North Africa and to the probable distant trade and transmission of wisdom embodied in the ancient burial rites of the Egyptians. Does it speak about some hidden and forgotten character/personality trait deeply ingrained in the genes of the Sicilian people? Modern 21st people can only view, consider and ruminate on such family/societal rituals.Visited this location in Summer 1996 on a visit to our paternal grandparents' place of birth. My brother and I made the trek. Details of admission prices and other available facilities are not readily to my memory. It is annoying that one can not enter the exact time of visit as the auto entry box below only goes out to 2013!"
770,Pretty cool place,"An odd and disturbing, yet strangely fascinating visit.   Dozens of dead people, preserved by having their innards removed then washed in vinegar or arsenic, then dressed in their clothes and kept in the catacombs.  Centuries of people in different forms of attire, the poor,‚Ä¶"
771,Smiling faces,"We visited on a national holiday, so the area was buzzing. The catacombs were open with a small entrance fee. The inhabitants were in various states of decomposition and attire. The majority appeared to be from just after the unification of Italy. There is a balance between the‚Ä¶"
772,Cogent reminders of mortality,This Is well worth a visit. It isn't for the faint hearted and I'm unsure if it. Is suitable for small children. It's only 3 euro entry. Little bit of a walk to pop into google maps and you will be there in no time . We spent about 15 min there.
773,These Catacombs Have Preserved Bodies,"I did the catacombs/basilica/bone chapel tour - wow! the catacombs are really interesting - definately wouldn't want to be claustrophobic going down there!! If you think you are going to see bodies - no - you see the tunnels and the little caves/holes where the bodies were underneath a church.The next stop the basilica, that was built on top of another church, which was built on top of another church - you get the idea - and you get to see and visit all 4 levels - its truly a great experience to step back in time!The Capuchins and the bone chapel - one of my favourite sites to see - its creepy and awesome and astounding :) do yourself a favour and book this - as no photos can be taken - you have to see to believe! A ROOM DECORATED IN PELVIS'!!! some with skin still on - pretty out there!!"
774,Death is just a part of life,I had never visited catacombs before but this was certainly an eye opener. A short tour to a location that is tucked away a good walk from the city centre. Well worth the visit especially if combined with looking at the next door cemetary
775,Out of the Ordinary but a Must See,"My daughter really wanted to visit the Catacombs I wasn't so sure and when we got there I realised I was right. 3 euros each to get in and then a short walk through a tunnel and some steps down. The catacombs are set out in different areas for men, women, children, professionals, clergy and virgins!! I thought it was amusing that the section for virgins was the smallest!  It isn't for the faint hearted. Lots of skeletons hanging on walls or in coffins. The best preserved child? A 2 year old girl. It is a strange experience but probably one you should make. We took a piaggio ape, like a tuk tuk as it is too far to walk from the main square and it was over 30¬∞."
776,Very interesting,"It feels surreal walking past and looking at hundreds, if not thousands, of dead persons standing up or lying in open caskets. And the two year old child can give everyone nightmares..."
777,RIP,I had looked forward to visiting the catacombs and from arriving i was disappointed that there was no change in temperature and no earthiness which can be found in other catacombs i have visited. Even though i knew what to expect i am unsure if this is little more than a tourist attraction with the exception of Baby rosalina.
778,Bizarre but different,I went with our 2 children.  We all enjoyed it and found it interesting.  And the little girl really does look like a doll.  All be it a bit messy after 70 years dead! There is no smell and it's well kept.  Half an hour is enough.  Cost is 3‚Ç¨. It is out of town tucked away so a little tricky to find.
779,Take A Healthy Curiosity,"Chilling and creepy, but worth seeing. Realizing that these people believed that the Capuchin monks would keep their bodies safe until the day of resurrection makes it a little less creepy.  The place a little out of the way and is much larger than it looks from the outside.  It is attached to a monastery which is not open to the public. I would not recommend it for small children."
780,"Weird, Strange, Freaky but Worth It!",We walked all the way to the catacombs from port passing the cathedral and a few other sights en route. It took us over an hour but I really recommend it. I visited catacombs in northern Italy before and expected a similar experience. I was in for a right surprise. This is truly one of a kind place with all skeletons/ bodies being fully dressed. The catacombs themselves are a lot bigger than we expected and filled with bodies from floor to ceiling. Some of them still have hair or skin on. An alternative kind of an attraction and I definitely recommend it!
781,very macabre but interesting,Makes u respect life and the quality of life to be shared...once you are gone u r gone...Mondays are ok after this..embrace life while u have it
782,Unusual experience,"Visited 31 October. Not much to add than what has already been said in other reviews. I do strongly suggest you go for a visit while your in Palermo. There is nothing like it anywhere in Australasia that I know of. And at 3 euros per entry, how could anyone complain. Good break from monuments, churches and your usual museums. I got there round 9.30 am. Just me and one other person who was taking pictures, even tho no pictures are to be taken. Really? Who are you going to show those pictures to? People going in to take pics was actually the sad part. No respect for the dead or the rules of the place."
783,"Super icky, and I'm including the staff. ","A place where you really feel the memento mori. At the same time you are aware of your mortality and your life. It's not a place for everybody, so skip it if you're not sure."
784,Very different.,"I have to admit I was very surprised by these catacombs, as I expected them to be more of the style of those you'd see in Rome or Paris. These were very different. Entrance is only 3‚Ç¨ and it's worth checking out, though it's definitely not for everybody (particularly not children). I'd recommend finding out a little more about it with some research before you visit. I was unprepared for skeletons fully dressed and hung upright from the walls, and even less for those that were so well preserved they still have hair. It wasn't too difficult to find, but it is a bit of a walk. They're closed for a bit in the afternoon so be sure not to walk all the way out there without checking the hours first."
785,sad but fascinating,"Gazing into the faces of mummified corpses in various states of arrested decomposition is not for everyone.  But, for me, once the initial discomfort passed there emerged a sense of serenity and, even, beauty.  Some of the people here died young.  Some violently.  Some at end of long lives.  Dressed as they are in clothes of their choice, or denoting their professions or calling to the fraternity of Capuchins, they seemed to convey a simple message, that life is short, but death is not to be feared.  Then I wandered out into the sunshine to get on with it."
786,surercool!!!,"A very strange experience.  Although you're aware that these are (or were) real people there is a feeling of being disconnected!  It is difficult to relate to them as humans, therefore it becomes more of a macabre curiosity.  The bodies, unceremoniously pinned to the wall, at times made me laugh, much to my shame.  It may have been a nervous reaction, I don't know.  Ultimately, it is a weird unnatural thing to view dead bodies as part of a holiday, however it IS interesting."
787,Haunting experience.,"8000 - occasionally very well, in fact mesmerisingly well preserved - corpses, clad mostly in their contemporary style."
788,A unique and bizarre experience,"Prior to this, the closest I've been to skeletons in clothing was at the Capuchin crypt on Via Veneto in Rome. That one only had four chambers of Capuchin skeletons. This one seemed like endless  hallways of skeletons hanging on the walls. I found the skeletons of babies and children the creepiest. Our tour group guide gave us 40 minutes to look around and all of us were back on the bus within 20 minutes."
789,Macabre but so intriguing!,"I did not go into the church and just glanced at the outside cemetery; however, I toured the entire catacombs that were available for view and it was quite interesting. The corpses are dressed up and hung from the walls. It is a small ""exhibition"" with catwalks for viewing; it is well lighted; notable in that apparently fresh flowers are still placed on these old corpses.  Great for a quick visit."
790,Sombre,"Took a cab from a few blocks from the cruise terminal, wanted to wander a little. Catacombs were shocking and sad and very interesting. Highly recommend."
791,stunning,"A very thought provoking and eerie  place to visit.........who were the people? how did they live? many wear clothes, and some are so well preserved they look closely to how they would have been in life."
792,really damn freaky...,"More than interesting and really uniqueWe arrived there by foot from Piazza Indipenenza. The neighborhood we crossed was already very interesting, eg. we went through a local fish market. Almost everything has been told about this unique museum. The visit takes 30-40 minutes, not more. But the experience is really special; if you are in Palermo, try to visit! Really worth, if not more we will take with us visiting these catacombs are some feelings about the future‚Ä¶.:-("
793,Overwhelming,"The Capuchin Friars were very keen on death and keeping bodies of the dead on show. There is an egregious example in Rome but this is the larger example. Underground corridors and chambers are lined by real dead bodies, about eight thousand, dating from 17th to 19th Centuries.  These are in their original clothes and are mummified - dried and hardened - but inevitable deterioration has exposed skull bones and teeth and so on. There is no particular smell.  The best preserved examples have dried but very recognisable facial features. By the tenets of the age, the dead ones are sorted by age and gender, professions and status. There are numerous priests and there is a room of women who died as virgins. Some babies and small children are represented. There is no evidence on show that these people ever consented to being displayed in eternity; the friars themselves probably knew what was coming and others maybe had no choice at all.Presumably, the purpose of the display of mummified corpses, which could otherwise have been decently buried, is to give messages to the living about being good and so on, and to have some strange continuity between the living and dead states. As shown by the painting, Trionfo della Morte, in the Galleria Regionale della Sicilia, Palazzo Abatellis,  death will get us all in the end, princes and priests, babies and virgins.  You will be glad to return to the open air and once out you will very much enjoy the living state for a while longer: Carpe diem!"
794,Shiver me timbers..!,Got to be honest I didn‚Äôt quite get this or see the point. Lots of skeletons on display in clothing. It‚Äôs quite a walk outside of the main sites but doable if you‚Äôve got the will or the time. If your sight seeing I guess you have to go but it just didn‚Äôt really inspire me. No‚Ä¶
795,An amazing place,I like catacombs and their mystery atmosfere... but Catacombs of the Capuchins are just exhibition of dead bodies with no respect to them. After my visit I felt uneasy and unsettled.
796,Fascinating,"Thousands of skeletons and mummified bodies staring at you as they hang on the walls. Eerie, creepy and strangely fascinating all at the same time. The guide was knowledgeable but spoke softly and I had to jockey toward the front to hear. Been there once - that's enough."
797,Sobering,"We went to the catacombs whilst on a weekend break in  Palermo because we had seen it on a TV programme. We walked there from the town centre.  I am glad we visited as the place is interesting, if macabre.  It is probably not every one's idea of an ""attraction"" so be prepared to see hundreds of corpses at various stages of decay."
798,Worthy of a visit,"This wasn't a tour I was really keen to see and thought that it would be morbid - it wasn't - its easy walking and flat, just crowdedWe were all advised ' no photos ' but guess what - yes those horrible people with selfie-sticks and pose far too long when taking a photo were in your face and in general holding up the whole lines of people in very narrow walkways - so beware of people with bad mannersYes there is a narrow passage, one of many so keep with your guide as its not a place I would like to be lost in. There is no smell in there, good light and I didn't find any of it morbid, fascinating would be the word as they say that most of it was done using straw and honey and looking at them didn't frighten me. In these catacombs, most of the corpses are vertical and clothed, some of the children are in coffins. A little girl named Rosalia Lombard, passed away hundreds of years ago and it is stated that they believe her to have been embalmed with a different method than any of the others and she was found with her porcelain face, beautiful fair hair with a big bow in it. She looked like she was just sleeping in her glass topped coffin - its a must see one although very sad as she died of pneumonia. There are between 7 -8 thousand corpses there to have a look at and its definitely not horrible - there is plenty of interesting history to see Of course there are stalls outside and you can buy your post cards as you can't take the photos inside (well most of us couldn't"
799,visit the dead,Not for the faint hearted and a bit out of the way but a fascinating view of the dead. Done with dignity and without frills. Recommended
800,Interesting but grim ,Not at all what we expected but interesting in a macabre way.I'm not sure the people interred there would have agreed had they known that 100 or so years later their coffins would be opened and their remains hung up for paying tourists to gawp at. Bizarre place !
801,doubtful attraction ...,"Visiting the Catacombs was a really special experience. Several corridors filled with mummies and skeletons placed all over the walls. Most of them are wearing clothes, some of them have skin, hair and even facial expressions. There are different ""collections"" like Women, Men, Children, Virgins etc. Famous Rosalia mummy is there and looks like a doll. If you do not like cemeteries and skeletons or do not want to meet your existential fears, think one more time before visiting. If you are ready for something special, dark and powerful, welcome! You will have couple of things more to reflex on. For me it was one of the most emotionally influential sightseeings in Palermo. Must be visited, if you can. :)"
802,Unique,"There is certainly a lot to see here if you have the stomach for it, but it was really sad to see the children on display. We understood from a local that the mummified remains are deteriorating , but some are still in excellent shape. It is still part of the history of Palermo."
803,Interesting,A bit spooky but fascinating. I've never seen anything quite like it! There are skeletons of adults and children upright and lying in coffins - all dressed in the remains of their Sunday best. Some are mummified.
804,Scary yet amazing,I like anything creepy and weird and this was most certainly that. It's a bit out of the way and you only need about 20-30 minutes to wander through but it's unlike any catacombs I've ever seen because the bodies are so well preserved. I'll leave it at that. You'll have to see for yourselves.
805,My review,"Never saw anything like this attraction.  The Capuchin monks had  a process for perserving the dead.  Many of the bodies are still mummified, while others are skeletal remains.  Very interesting.  Someone said it was macabre, but it IS a burial ground and should be treated with respect just like a cemetery or mausoleum."
806,Creepy yet excellent!,Not a place to visit for the faint hearted or any one who might suffer from claustrophobia... but I would not hv missed it for the world. It is anazing to be able to walk around and let your imagination take you back into the lives of so many different eras . Keep in mind this is a resting place so some decorum is expected.
807,Boring and creepy,"Visiting the catacombs is not for everyone. It is row after row of what looks like bodies hanging on the walls underground. It is eerie. You enter from the street where there are street vendors selling things and traffic driving by. Once you descend the steps into the catacombs, you are in a whole new world. It's amazing to think that this exists right under your feet. It is hard to imagine what you are really looking at. You should definitely investigate the catacombs before you plan on going there. Seeing it in person is much more intense than any picture."
808,Different and interesting.,"I don't know if I can recommend this place.  It is gruesome, the stuff of nightmares and is just body after body in the final decayed skeleton.  Occasional stretches of skin, teeth and hair.  Clothed and stuffed with straw and it is so dusty.  Children also in this state.  It isn't pleasant and perhaps it isn't supposed to be.  We soon left - it didn't seem to be a place to revere the dead just a monstrous look at death.  A horrible voyeurism.  Certainly don't take children."
809,Worth the search,"These mummies are not well preserved. The mummification process used here left a lot to be desired. The effect will be different for each visitor. I was scared to go in, but ended up laughing at the absurdity of the spectacle. Personally I find it disrespectful of the dead to prop them up like this. I'm not sure how the descendants of these people feel about it. But since it was something the dead themselves wanted, who am I to judge? The ticket seller tried to charge my friend double.. He said he thought she was buying a ticket for herself and me. But I also bought a ticket for myself. So pay attention. There is a closed circuit camera set up and you will be chastised on the PA system for taking photos. So beware of that."
810,Very interesting and a must see,Well... this is pretty much what it says an underground tomb. The bodies are hanging from the walls and laying in stacked tombs. The decomposition varies and some still have hair and skin . It includes infants and children. Not for the faint hearted. There are no information boards so do a bit of research before hand. There oldest was from 1599 but most from 1800's. The most recent addition was in 1928 and a young child named sleeping beauty.  She was very well preserved.  Not something for everyone but interesting for those with a morbid curiosity.  It's a fair walk from centre about 30 mins and not much to see along the way. Busy roads and bit dirty compared to other areas. Cost about 3 email each
811,"Morbid, but very interesting too!","I doubt that you will ever see anything like this again. A visit to the Catacombs is unique and fascinating. However maybe not for the faint hearted, but certainly a must do while you are in Palermo"
812,Wow!,"To be honest I was pretty disappointed - it is a kind of cript (catacombe is a little too much to title) with a lot of skeletons dressed. From ethnographic and historical fashion point of view might be interesting, otherwise is a kind of memento mori - the proof that after 150-200years only bones remains from all of us. With a couple of exceptions there are no ‚Äúmummies‚Äù, just slightly creepy bones."
813,Interesting,"We visited the Catacombs on a Sunday - having read so many reviews about NOT driving around Palermo during the week! It was easy to find on SatNav and we parked without a problem. Quite a friendly man behind the desk with a little English, didn't try to sell me anything I didn't want. The bodies and skeletons are all a little gruesome but also fascinating. My kids (14 & 10) were not unduly freaked out either as I think the fact that it's not all dark & gloomy inside helps. You are not allowed to take photos - not sure why - but I did take a couple before I was told off over the tanoy system - lots of CCTV!"
814,What nightmares are made of :),"The condition of the remains in the catacombs is dreadful, the entire experience is macabre and feels very disrespectful."
815,Disrespectful,Revisited 25+ years after I'd previously been....Walking down the tunnel (before the actual exhibits) the subtle smell of the dust (from the skeletons/bodies hit me) and brought back previous memories....Very creepy - I felt more than a little uncomfortable.The medical people in our group seemed the least affected!
816,good for kids,I had read about the catacombs prior to visiting and was keen to see them for myself. My partner and I visited on a Sunday around 3pm and it was busy but not overly so. The atmosphere is enjoyably creepy and the bodies are very well preserved! A guide book is available in several languages. We spent about thirty minutes here and looked up information on what we had seen later. Interesting way to spend a bit of time.
817,Macabre,"It's macabre. Bodies hanging on the walls like decoration, laid out on shelves down long dank passageways in various states of decay. After the first 100 or so the amazement is gone. It's not an expensive tour and the most I can say is it's something to do in Palermo. Yes I did sneak a few photos. I figured it was less disrespectful than hanging someone's corpse on a wall and turning them into a tourist attraction. If I'm wrong then so be it."
818,Must must see!,"Many cultures have prepared and preserved the bodies of their loved ones.  Sicily is no exception and this particular set of catacombs is well worth the visit.  We have visited catacombs in Peru as well and these are equally memorable.  Somehow we missed the most famous skeleton--of two year-old Rosalia  still dressed, but the skeleton is not even 100 years old whereas some of the others here are much older.  A few in their coffins in  vertical positions look like they are gossiping to each other.  Would make great Halloween images but photography is not allowed.  We bought a set of postcards so we can scan into the travel video we will make of our trip.  We visited Palermo specifically for this attraction and were not disappointed!"
819,Fascinating and goolish,"Embalmed bodies and skeletons wearing clothes, an unpleasant show of death and vanity. Strange, unusual and picturesque. The dead are not resting in peace, with all these tourists staring."
820,Gruesome but worth seeing,Great to see one of many catacombs. Human remains moved. Not for the clostrephobic tho underground in darkened alleys or should I say tombs
821,Unreal,"Very interesting!  There was a certain sense that someone was with you all the way, but not in a scary way! It really made you speak in hushed tones and be respectful of the dead! I wouldn't take young children in there! The exhibit was very clean and well maintained. I would go again!!"
822,Eerie,"The catacombs is full of mummified skeletons. The smell of embalming solution is throughout the catacombs. I felt nausea after the tour. We were there for about 20 minutes. That was to long. Families of. Mother, father, child were together, really creepy. You could still see their faces. Once is enough!  There are hundred and row upon row of mummies and skeletons dressed in their burial clothing."
823,Impressive,We made the mistake of walking from the Duomo to the catacombs which is quite a long walk in the heat.  We arrived about 1:30 to find that it was closed between 13:00 and 15:00 hours so do check opening times if you are visiting
824,Fascinating,"We knew this was a left field choice, but we were still surprised by what we saw. Definitely not for the feint hearted or children. If you are into horror movies this may be up your street."
825,The weirdest place I've ever been to.,"A slightly disturbing and emotional place to visit, but worth experiencing.I wasn't sure what to expect, and was certainly taken aback to begin with."
826,"Very special, you're not going to find this anywhere else","The catacombs were an interesting place to visit, albeit a bit scary to see dead folks all around us. I think the authorities or management f the area can do better to maintain and preserve the bodies/skeletons in there. It would be a waste to see them deteriorating as there was poor checks on camera flash being used and it was very easy for visitors to just touch the bodies there."
827,Crepy and Awesome,Very macabre and unique. I actually found the clothes the corpses were wearing to be interesting. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for children or people who get grossed out easily.
828,Booked via cruise ship Costa Serena,"The short tour through the corpse filled Catacombs is an horrible experience, in a somewhat good way. This is certainly something that I will never forget. The entrance fee is reasonable but to get information you have to buy a small booklet of 4‚Ç¨.   Certainly not for children,‚Ä¶"
829,A strange experience,Still dressed in their finest these corpses straddle a bit of the living and the dead.  Lovely and appalling.  No photos.  If they catch you they make you erase them.  But who needs a reminder.
830,Ghoulish spectacle,"...especially when the guy comes over the speaker to scold you for taking pictures, whoops. Great place!"
831,Creepy,"What an unusual place , spooky and macabre. But loved looking around .My highlight of Palermo.An easy walk there and back using google maps Cheap as well 3 euros each . Opened at 15.00"
832,Sights,"I'm glad to have experienced this but I do feel a little emotional about seeing rows and rows of bodies. It felt stuffy and I didn't want to take a deep breath. You'll see lots of monks, children and well dressed professionals. We visited in the afternoon and it wasn't busy."
833,Terryfying but worth seeing!,"It was the first time in my life I have been in catacombs, and what I can say -It's really worth to visit, for sure if you are not afraid to see dead bodies. Maybe the most strange thing and uncommon is little balsamied girl under the glass, where she seems like a doll. You pay for entrance about 3 eur but worth those money."
834,Tacky and  macabre,"I walked to the catacombs, through the bustling noise, heat and stink of Palermo. The route is signposted, but you will also have to use your instincts to find the exact location, which isn't obvious if you just follow the signs. You enter via a ticket office banked with multiple CCTV screens.  You then travel down a sloping walkway into a fusty, dank, subterranean chamber lined with the wizened and contorted corpses of the long dead. What strikes you is how popular this place really is, with visitors coming in their droves to ogle the grinning features of the dead, and the mischeivous game they play to try and capture a mummified face on their camera phone, without being spotted by the guardian of the catacombs, who is viewing your transit around the space above on CCTV. Many of the mummies are now just bleached skeletal remains, draped in fetid, tattered robes, faded and frayed with great age. Their gaping mouths and eyeless sockets greet you in an obscene leer as you ramble along the narrow alleyways of dead deacons, hooded monks, and uniformed soldiers, all slumped in positions of deteriorating precariousness, held up by makeshift wires, their finger bones dropping off and rolling onto the stone floor.  You will see people apparently stuffed and waxed, inside glass coffins, nibbled by mice and insects - dead for over 170 years. Exploded craniums and leathery skin, hanging in ghastly folds over peeling skulls, makes for an unsightly study tour. The Capella di Bambini is a shrine to dead babies and children, all posed in their Sunday best, dresses and tartan or checkered tunics, misshapen little monsters,  preposterously grotesque puppets, sloped in alcoves above like effigies of evil. The preponderance of matted and tangled human hair is most disconcerting. The smell of death, the deep brown stains of evaporated body fluids, evident on ratty costumes and fabrics makes one heady and gag. There are thousands of bodies compressed into this vault of remembrance. photography is strictly forbidden, but everyone takes photos regardless of the purgatorial consequences that are boomed through a loud speaker system to those who dare defy the rules! This is one of the strangest and most moving tourist attractions I have ever visited. When I exited, I felt totally disorientated and needed a strong drink to revive my composure."
835,Chilling and well worth it!,"I understand that this is a cultural experience, but I found the experience unpleasant and disturbing. I was leading a group of college students who were also horrified by what they saw. It took me a while to recover from the trauma of seeing so many mummified Sicilians from the 17th to the 20th century. The infants, in particular, were very disturbing to me and to the students."
836,Creepy yet wonderfully fascinating,Not an atraction that will be to everones tastes - as a doctor I am not phased by death - but the presentation of death here might be shocking to some.Historical - YesCultural - CertainlyWorth a visit - In my opinion yes definately
837,The Undead Are On Display,"I can't believe I am really saying ""meh"" about all those dead people, but ""meh"" honestly. It's interesting enough, and I'm glad I went and all, but I saw much better stuff in Palermo. Get yourself to the Capelle Palatina."
838,"Creepy, spooky, must see","We went to the catacombs circa 14.00. Walking through it takes roughly 10-15 minutes. But what a great time. It was a slightly scary experience in which I contemplated the lives of the mummies (which have been there since from 100 years to over 400 years. It is not for people who are easily scared and I do not recommend bringing Kids. The bodies are in various stages of decomposition and you can expect to see everything from essentially skeletons in nice clothing to Rosalia Lombardo, who looks like she passed away only a few days ago (she actually passed away circa 100 years ago). It was an experience which made me stronger mentally since death of course is not pleasant subject. I strongly recommend this if you want a different experience which is a bit darker. Also, be sure to bring water if you are walking, I was sweating very much on my way to Capuchin."
839,Spooky,Not for the faint-hearted. It‚Äôs like you stepped on set for Tales from the Crypt. It‚Äôs seriously creepy and you wouldn‚Äôt want to get trapped in there for a power outage but well worth the visit in my eyes and at ‚Ç¨3 pretty cheap too. There are hundreds of bodies/skeletons in‚Ä¶
840,Closed,"An amazing display of mummified bodies, all standing dressed and pinned against the wall. The oldest go back to the 17c and the most recent 1920. A real cabinet of curiosities, both bizarre and beautiful. From times when people didn't sweep death under the carpet and sanitise it as we do, but squarely faced up to what is coming to us all. The modern cemetary next door has some excellent monuments and also the tomb of Lampedusa."
841,Worth seeking out,Well its there and you have to do it. go and witness your own mortality and stare at your future. Bloody depressing but you just have to womble in there. Interestingly macabre with a tinge of sadness to it all
842,Lessons Learned From the Ancients,"While this might seem to be a bit of a gruesome attraction, it is actually quite moving.  You get an almost palpable sense of the real people who lived and worked in the great city. And, of course, a reminder that however rich or powerful a person might have been, they all end up in the same state..."
843,Fascinating but ghoulish!,"I can't judge a place by the people it attracts, merely by the way it is. The Catacombs are rightfully called creepy ‚Äì what did you expect from a resting chamber for thousands of bodies? ‚Äì and as such is probably not suitable for young children. If they've learned of the birds and the bees they'll probably be OK.The way in which they're displayed is unique - some lay on shelves, while others hang from the walls, posed and wearing what they were buried in. Monks aren't too far from professionals, women, and children, and each has a little chapel dedicated to them.The place is in need of some basic upgrades, but nothing big enough to mark it down. If you go, respect the premises by remaining silent and following the 'no photo' rule. I don't like it one bit, but that's the rule. You'll be in and out inside of half an hour."
844,Something entirely different....,"I've never seen anything like this before, I hadn't quite realised the scale of it before we went but just row upon row of bodies! I would recommend buying the small guide leaflet (I think it's about ‚Ç¨1) as there's not really any information as you go round, and it was interesting to read about the history of the place and put it in some context rather than just gawking at rows of skeletons!"
845,Amazing experience if you're into it.,Embalming was just catching on; these folks decided hanging bodies on the wall would allow visitiation.
846,A can't-miss place.,Hallways filled with skeletons in clothing. Creepy! especially the children and babies...
847,Must see!,"We visited the catacombs as part of an optional day trip whilst cruising with Norwegian Epic. It was morbid, and unless you like seeing hundreds of dead, musty, decayed bodies up close then I would steer clear of this place. It was interesting for about 5 minutes but the tour went on and on  - the smell was not pleasant either."
848,A Micheal Jackson video scene,"My husband and I had heard a lot about the catacombs and decided to walk from Palermo via Via Cappucini which took approx 20 minutes. On arrival it's quite uninspiring just a doorway with a sign and a small queue nothing ornate about the church attached.It was ‚Ç¨3 entrance which was taken by one of the monks.Walking down to the catacombs it's quite dark and spooky but then again what catacombs wouldn't be.You are then greated by 8000 dead bodies in various state of decay. We were fortunate to hear a guide in front explain some of the stories and history.There were rows of bodies with dates and detail of who they were. A section of just children were placed together but the guide explained that they were placed together as they believed that the children would play together. Same with a section of young woman who would chat to each other and couples who they believed would dance together. Thinking of their beliefs made it more interesting. Rows of bodies were placed together depending on profession, rank in society and a section of clergy.Historically very interesting you need to be able to get over that these are real bodies but seeing the history in the clothing etc is fascinating plus the monies raised protects the sacred area and keeps those buried there in place.Yes it's morbid but it's scary to start with but protecting a historical site it's also fascinating."
849,Fascinating and grisly,Not for the faint of heart. Interesting but just for a short visit. If you are at all sqeamish -esp about seeing dead and decayed bodies -stay away!
850,Definitely worth it,"A place that's macabre and creepy that's definitely not for everyone. If you think you can handle it is worth a visit, as it is an experience you definitely won't have experienced before. The ticket costs 3‚Ç¨."
851,Spooky,"It may sound macabre but my wife had wanted to see this for many years and she wasnt disappointed. Weird, wacky, sad, amazing all at the same time. The colours of the clothes on the corpses have faded but she would still highly recommend it. Get a taxi from the centre. If you ask nicely they will wait for you."
852,Historical Palermo,"An early morning start meant that we were at the catacombs before the full lighting was switched on!  Very spooky, very interesting with hundreds of dead bodies.No make that 8,000 dead bodies  Within a short space of time the remains became well lit .  Arranged in categories they were surprisingly interesting.  No photography allowed which was a pity."
853,"Interesting, not too creepy, clautrophobic or intimidating.","This is a very eerie experience...it made us aware just how disensitized we as humans have become. Seeing the corpses you almost don't want to believe they are real. Some of the more preserved skeletons are very ""real"" looking and scary. The monk and the gentleman at front desk‚Ä¶"
854,Very Unusual,"This is unusual but worth seeing. It depicts methods of body preservation.  A 2-year-old child is preservedwho  looks like she died yesterday.  It is not for the faint of heart. Unlike other catacombs, here you see actual bodies. It really is an interesting place. Father A. Charbel is a wonderful priest who will answer any questions you have."
855,A bizarre must see!,"I finally found the Catacombs (by standing outside and waiting for other tourists to arrive, then watching where they went - for the record, it is a small door with a small sign in a corner of a building) and paid and went in. It's not really underground, but about 10 steps down. There are windows high up that I assume are low to the pavement outside, and they let natural light in.The actual ""attraction"" left me with mixed feelings. I have never seen so many dead people before, and I wasn't sure how to feel about it. They are in varying stages of decomposition, and I personally found that the better (but not perfectly) preserved ones left me the most uncomfortable. I think seeing skeletons is a lot easier on people, because they aren't really associated with human beings or individuals, but more with anatomy.Seeing the peeling skin and sunken eyes of the still decomposing bodies was unnerving, but not quite disturbing. The thing that had me slightly concerned was the lack of information about the individuals. Some of them had tags hanging from clothing with a name and a date, but other than that there was no back story, no information about their life. It left me feeling slightly embarrassed that I was staring at dead people without knowing who they are.Usually bodies are treated with due respect after death, especially for the family of the deceased, and I think that's what was lacking here, more than anything."
856,Not for the faint-hearted,I visited here out of curiosity after seeing something on TV about it a while ago.  It was rather scary and seemed like the dead were observing you but also interesting to see the clothing from the past.  There was a section for children and also for virgins.  Some of the skeletons still had some skin and hair and the little girl who died in 1920 looked like she was just sleeping.   Worth a visit but not for children.
857,really worth the visit,"My husband did not enjoy this at all. He could not see what anyone would want to see mummified corpses. It was a very unusual site to see so many mummified bodies in one place, all dressed in clothes that they had worn in life. After a while there are just too many... and it is rather grotesque but it is a novelty so probably worth the visit"
858,Creepy but very interesting,"This is not perhaps for anyone who is squeamish about seeing endless rows of the mummified dead, but it is an utterly fascinating, larger version of the same Order's crypt in Rome. Divided into sections and well laid out in terms of access and lighting, the remains vary from skeletal to remarkably preserved. most notably those of the small girl in the children's section who is kept in a temperature and humidity controlled capsule. A well produced book is available for purchase and contains interesting detail on the processes employed by the monks for mummification. If you don't mind a very graphic tic demonstration of where we are all headed, then don't miss this rare sight.It's a little distance from the centre of Palermo but a cab ride will manage it and a friendly driver (lime ours) will arrange to come back for you at a pre-arranged time. Depending on your level of interest then allow anything from 30 minutes to three quarters of an hour to view."
859,Unique experience,"Free parking right in front of this hidden gem, cheap and not crowded at all. Hundreds of mummified bodies. Too bad there‚Äôs no English information, besides the sections they made (males, females, kids, babies and monks). No photo and video allowed."
860,A different class of catacomb,It was quite weird to walk among all those people who decided to put themselves in here. Not haunting at all if you ask me but weird... interesting but weird and luckily not that big.
861,Not for emos !!!,"If you have never been to catacombs this will leave you speechless. The mummified bodies of hundreds of Sicilians hang along the walls of the cave corridors, leaving you feeling very humbled by the history and ceased life surrounding you. They have organized the bodies by gender, profession, age, etc. Very powerful and worth the experience."
862,Hallowe'en special surprise,"Certainly not a place for everyone. Even though we were completely aware of where we were going, we left the place shocked. I still think though this place is a must when you visit Palermo. It is a little bit far away from the centre but you can easily reach in even on foot in about 30 minutes. The ticket costs only 3 euro."
863,Not for faint hearted but...,"It's the kind of place that's a 'must' because it's a totally 'one off' experience. 3 Euros entry fee and 8,000 dead and decaying bodies to look at.....just think, all these people actually wanted to be put on display after their death, so it's not 'tasteless' or 'disrespectful' as this is what they wanted!!!! Oldest 'corpse' dates back to 1599.......a real treat and an experience you will NEVER forget!"
864,Curious and compelling,"This was one of the things my girlfriend and I wanted to see. We got on the hop on hop off bus and asked the lady about the Catacombs. She told us to get off at stop 7 and walk. This was a Sunday and were told it would be closed. We decided to walk to see how far it was for the next day. If you are active, this walk won't be far... We walked and went right past it. Follow the signs that have a temple on it. The streets change if you are not paying attention. We found it and boy o boy was this one of the coolest places I have gone too. It was cheap to get in (3 or 4 euros) and  had so many bodies. We could have spent all day looking at all different bodies and the way people were dressed. I would suggest you get there at 3 when they open bc tours come and get loud down in the hallways. I will tell everyone to come here. I would not bring kids bc it is creepy and some of the faces look like they are looking at you. Kids will have nightmares. If you are in Palmero, Def see this!"
865,Catacombe dei Cappucini,Gruesome but fascinating look into history.  The catacombs contain mummies dating back to the 16th century of people of all ages and stations of life.
866,Very different experience!,"The catacombs were so amazing, not morbid at all.  It was incredible to be so close to the bodies and realize that this was a means of preserving (embalming) these bodies. The youngest little girl, Rosalia was somewhat sad due to her age of two. We had a tour guide who explained the sections of the catacombs and who was entombed where."
867,Exceeded my expectations - don't miss it! Amazing place!,"This was on our list of places we really wanted to go.I'm not sure what I was expecting but I just found it very very weird and felt like a voyeur.Some of the skeletons are in a bad state, heads dropping off etc but I guess you would be too if you were 300 years old! The memorial garden next door is worth a visit but I won't be visiting any more catacombs!"
868,Bizarre,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been so confronted with my own mortality. Its actually hard to digest that your really viewing long dead people at various stages of decomposition. I was mesmerised, fascinated and uncomfortable all at the same time. It was hard to believe this wasn‚Äôt the set of a soft horror movie. To think families of the deceased would come and visit their dead loved ones regularly, makes my mind boggle. This place is unique and a must see if you don‚Äôt scare easily. I thinks it‚Äôs appropriate that photos are not permitted. After all the dead do deserve at least a little privacy, I‚Äôm sure these once living people never expected to be part of a tourist attraction or displayed for public forum and this made me feel like I was an intruder in a forbidden place. In spirit, I do hope those poor souls are resting in peace. My conclusion is GO, but be warned it‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt unsee when you‚Äôve seen it and you don‚Äôt know what emotions it may provoke. I struggled to look at the children, so very sad but was enthralled by the clothing worn by the corpses ."
869,Macabre yet mesmerizing,To go and see a load of rotten dead corpses seems a bit strange to me. But see them I did.It is quite a hike from Palermo centre. Possibly worth a visit?Interesting is the word..
870,Sobering,Thoroughly enjoyed the trip and would recommend this venue wholeheartedly. I thought it might be a bit macabre but found it relaxing. We walked from the city centre and only took half an hour.
871,AMAZING - Number one attraction in Palermo!,"We were in Palermo for a day while on an MSC cruise. My husband really wanted to see the catacombs and I obliged. I am so glad that I did. These catacombs are unlike any other that I've seen. Most of the time you walk through dark and partially excavated passages and don't really see much. This place is unreal. The way this culture preserved their dead is eerily intriguing. The wide and well-lit hallways go on and on. I found it to be fascinating and think it's a place to seek out just for how unique it is. Let's be honest, there are only so many churches you can go into before they all start looking the same. This is something really different to break up the church visits."
872,Top Attraction,"Strangely beautiful and calming - A very unique experience, I expected to be unsettled, but found the visit strangely calming...the silence, the history, the close up view of those that have gone before....don't be put off, worth the visit!!"
873,Strange but compelling,Did the Hop on Hop off bus and this was one of the places it stopped.  Made me feel like a Halloween event but this was a real thing.  Rows and Rows of bodies preserved with hair and some original clothes.  The baby section was very sad but intriguing.  I've been to catacombs outside of Paris but this was much more extensive and worth a visit.  Very nicely done.
874,Nightmarish,We debated on going to see the catacombs as I was unsure how I'd react to being in cellars with lots of dead bodies! It was not as cramped and dark as I anticipated so I was fine. In fact it was strangely fascinating and I'm glad I overcame my apprehension and visited.
875,A must see in Palermo,"This place exceeded all my expectations and even my bf who wasn't convinced to go and look for it with me, was happy to experience it in the end. Strangely it is and it is not scary. But it truly is a fascinating place. It may seem creepy, but you learn a lot and it makes you thinking. There also is the child, that appeared on Internet a few times saying it's moving its eyes but if you look closely you realise that it depends on the angle from which you look at it. So it's really not moving eyes (well, just my opinion). But it is definitely interesting. We went there during our Cruise Ship break. It was 35 degrees centigrade there that time, the heat was terrible, and we didn't feel like looking for catacombs. Luckily the Italians didn't need to speak English to give you directions. Once you say catacombs, they will show you the way. So despite the hot weather, I do recommend visiting it."
876,The scariest place in Palermo,Definitely worth a visit simply for the fact that it's different from any other catacombs I've been to. It's not creepy or too dark and it's actually quite an interesting look into Sicilian culture. The road out to it from central Palermo is simple to find and follow but you'll be in direct sunlight all the way so it does get very hot.
877,very weird but good to see,The catacombs are arranged quite neatly and the bodies are either hanging on the walls or sort of stacked in open shelves. We were staying about an hour walk from here and picked it as a destination for a stroll around the city. It was well worth the walk.
878,Worth the detour- just be aware of what the time is!,"Not at all what I was expecting. Didn‚Äôt realise there was a tradition of mummification in Europe. Brings out lots of words; sad, scary, comical and tragic are just a few.A place that has to be seen to be belived.The cemetery above it is also worth a stroll around."
879,"Creapy, but Cool","We visited last year as part of a Thomson tour and found the experience shocking. One couple left immediately, visibly upset and commenting they didn't need to see this. If you have suffered a traumatic experience make sure you are fully aware.  I hadn't fully appreciated what this part of the tour entailed so rechecked the tour blurb but it made no mention so did feed this back to Thomsons.  The images are haunting and it took a while for these to fade, I am pretty stoic but this shook me up. A couple of people were laughing and despite warnings one person tried to take photographs, appalling lack of respect."
880,Bizarre and horrifying unique museum,Entrance ticket costs 3‚Ç¨. The catacombs are 20/25 minutes walking distance from Palazzo Reale/Norman Palace. We spent there about half an hour. Very interesting! Definitely worth visiting.
881,Someone may not like it,"It's a bit out of the way from central Palermo but don't be fooled, it's a short taxi ride of a maximum of ‚Ç¨10 from Palermo Centrale and only ‚Ç¨3 entry. You won't spend more than 20 minutes there at the most, the first time I went there our taxi even stayed outside for us, you should try to do this too as to my memory there were no ranks outside.As for the actual Catacombs they are fascinating, they show clearly the damages that history has taken , for me that in itself was part of the story. This was a huge part of Palermos history where it was an honour to be 'kept' here. Make sure you see it, it is worth the 20 mins!"
882,Mixed feelings,"Dreadfully disappointed.  The information I read beforehand suggested the bodies were mummified, allowing facial features to be seen but, in fact, most are merely skulls. There is one child that is beautifully preserved (and is used in the promotional material) but don't be fooled into thinking any of the other bodies are anywhere close to the same state of preservation.  For that reason, I felt it was a bit of a tourist con.  Afterwards we sat outside for a while and, as far as I could tell, most people only stayed 15-20 mins.  And it's a long slog (about 30 mins in heat) from the other attractions of Palermo. On the plus side, if you are driving, there is free parking in the vicinity and you could then walk into Palermo - I wish someone had let us know that beforehand!!As others have noted, no stills photography or filming is allowed and they request behaviour that recognises this as a place of rest."
883,a bit eerie but must see!,"First time into a catacomb of any sort. Yeah, full of dead bodies, organised in sections too. Little English explanations so just a show of corpses in dress. The entrance to the place is rather non-descript; looks like a odds-and-ends stall as it is located next to a souvenir stall."
884,So poorly presented that it is just about macabre,"The tradition of mummification was long present in Sicily. However those mummies were mostly skeletons. It is a bit morbide, out of town and I would not go again (yes they have the most beautiful mummy in the world)."
885,The best ghost train I've ever tried - PG required!,"Although I am sure a certain type of visitor may find this dreadful place interesting, it certainly wasn‚Äôt for me .. I find places like this quite sad and a bit, well.. gruesome !! With so many wonderful things to see and visit in Palermo , simply don‚Äôt understand why anyone would want to see decomposing corpses hanged up on walls with rats and a foul smell lingering in the air .."
886,Fascinatingly Macabre,"Admittedly I'm no expert on the catacombs of Europe, but in this place I felt uncomfortable, yet respectful. It was quiet when I was there, and that probably added to the atmosphere.  There were many remains in various states of preservation. It's a place I will definitely‚Ä¶"
887,A Missed Opportunity,"This place is dusty, dirty, and decaying. I don't know who runs it but they don't seem to be putting any money back into restoration or preservation. You might want to bring a hanky or flu mask because breathing the air in here is uncomfortable. I was afraid of catching a long-extinct deathly virus or toxic mold. We unknowingly arrived just before the lunchnap time of day so we were disappointed to be told that we only had 7 minutes to visit or we'd have to come back in 3 hours (on the upside, no Sicilians are dying from work-related stress). The two guys behind the counter were like straight out of central casting for pervy Sicilian lotharios. Needless to say, their professionalism was lacking and they gave the impression of having just taken over the desk from an old nun who was maybe tied up in a closet. They wanted full price for the 7 minute visit, which was ridiculous but after a lot of attitude and bad Italian (mine), we were able to reach a settlement and our group entered the place. A lot of the skeletons are behind very dusty plexiglass and the flooring is all plexiglass (which is quite slippery - be forewarned). There is no security and no escort. You are free to wander the dusty, macabre displays as you wish because there is no organization. There is also no information unless you want to pay for it. It's just corridors of skeletons; most hanging, some reclining. That's it. The place was empty except for us, however, as we were leaving after our 7 minutes we saw other tourists enter the museum so I don't think their lunch nap is set in stone if they can squeeze out a few more Euro. This operation has all the charm and educational value (and cleanliness) of a county fair sideshow. There are a bunch of overpriced trinkets for sale at the entrance but those are also dusty and dirty. It's sad, really, the lack of attention and respect since this is essentially a graveyard.If you must see this type of thing--go to the one in Rome! It's cleaner, well-organized, and in addition to all the skeletons it has very interesting bone mosaics and displays. Those monks were artists (?) compared to these in Palermo. Check online for their hours because they are erratic."
888,Disgusting. Not quiet the family daytrip.,"Our guide took us to this place. We did not know what to expect. We all found it rather gruesome, being confronted with hundreds of mummified bodies. Some of these were hanging up while others were on shelves built in to the walls. I must say this is not for the faint hearted, we did not stop in there very long. This was a popular attraction as there were people queuing up outside to get in. Just beware!!!!!"
889,Exceptional!,"First must say if you are a little aprensive dont even try to enter. Its literaly death dryed people exposed. Its part of the local history and one of those creepy places that dont have sense in nowa days. After all, one thing that cannot be seen anywhere else."
890,Interesting but no photos can be taken unfortunately,We went here due to the good reviews and the fact it was something out of the ordinary. Honestly I didn't like it at all; I felt very uncomfortable during the visit and only stayed a few minutes. A lot of the 'bodies' still have skin and hair intact and are fully clothed and it's so overwhelming when you are faced with so many in one place! They are also very quick to tell you to be respectful of the place and the mummies so no photos allowed (not that I wanted any!) but then the shop is plastered with books with the exhibits on the front cover! Maybe it's a cultural thing; I'm British so find all this quite odd. Given it average review as although I wasn't keen my travelling companions found it more interesting than I did.
891,Very Cool and easy to reach on the red Hop on Hop off bus line,As you walk into the catacombes you are immediately come face to face with hundreds of mummified corpses. In some of them you can make out the facial features whereas on some there is quite a bit of decay. One section is full of small children and babies which I found quite upsetting. This place is not for the faint hearted or anyone who is likely to suffer from nightmares as is quite ghoulish. Overall worth a visit if you are interested in this sort of thing or just out of sheer curiosity.
892,Facinating and creepy.,"Not knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised. This was not a burial place for just the monks, but for townspeople as well, especially the rich! Our guide explained the mummification process as well as the sentiment of the people back in the mid 1800s. I found it fascinating‚Äã. Well worth the time."
893,Sobering but fascinating,I am a complete wuss when it comes to catacombs or any underground tours but I must say that the Catacombe dei Cappuccini was a pleasent surprise to me. It was a lot more spacious than I expected and not at all creepy or morbid.
894,You have to!,"We visited in march on a Sunday and had to wait for the catacombs to open in the rain !!! I found the place soulless ... Upsetting even. A damp dark dusty dungeon of bodies and skeletons.Knowing these people existed and now were hanging off the walls for people to gawp at just didn't seem right some how. Little Rosa Maria just upset me more. I found a little chapel to pray but just found it all to macabre and depressing, distasteful & disrespectful. We didnt stay long & Wish I hadn't gone tbh. Depressed me :("
895,"Emotional, eye opening, historical amazement",Wow... what an unusual thing.  Mummified corpses dating back to the late 1500s to the late 1800s some are amazingly well preserved.  Not sure I would take a sensitive child there but i found it really interesting.
896,"The most macabre sight I have ever seen / avoid this ""attraction.""","This is truly one of the creepiest things I have ever seen yet, strangely, I'd recommend it. The catacombs are basically a series of under ground rooms housing a bunch of dead bodies strung up on the walls and in shelves. They're clothed in interesting clothes (one in an admiral's uniform!) and it seemed that they were stuffed with straw or some other such substance. Many of them even have skin and hair remaining, and there's a whole section dedicated to babies. The catacombs are open 9am-12 and 3-5pm, and admission is 3 euro. Well worth it!"
897,Memento Mori,If you're in Palermo don't miss the opportunity to visit the catacombs. Not for everyone I know but I was enthralled.
898,Totally awesome!,"Not at all what I expected from catacombs. Dead bodies/ skeletons hanging from the walls, warehouse feeling. I know there is a religious aspect there and this is how it was done in the 18th/ 19th century. However, taking money and admitting groups of people without possibly the proper background information is just...weird. Did not feel like religion had any part in this, no panels to describe what is going on. Just a grim tourist attraction.."
899,Number one attraction in Palermo,"An assortment of thousands, in their clothes and some with hats.  All dead for ages, and only the skeletons remain intact or half-intact.  Hard to say what the purpose was in assembling this gruesome crowd, possibly some idea of preserving their memory.  In fact it caused visitors to flee, to cry, to express horror and indignation.  But if you are not specially sensitive - don't miss it."
900,Not so morbid as was told,"This is one of the strangest and most fascinating things I have seen in my whole life. It is so special and different. I totally recommend everyone to visit, because this is as close as you will come to death without dying."
901,The inhabitants have real personality.,"On a recommendation, we walked to the Catacombs.  WARNING....This is NOT a place to bring kids.We were not expecting what we experienced.  Bodies lining the walls that are in various states of decay.  Most were bones but others still had leathery skin on their skulls/faces.  All had clothes and the rows were divided by age, sex, profession, and importance.  This was started in the 1600's and they stopped adding bodies in the 1920's.  Very interesting and VERY different from the other things to see in Sicily....or anywhere else in the world.I was surprised"
902,"Unusual, a little creepy as well","Well...it's  a trek to get there...and not my sort of thing. Not exactly ghoulish, but a cadaver too far. I think that seeing the postcard would suffice."
903,people who could think beyond life,"A significant walk from the town centre, but well worth it.Over 8000 bodies, dating back to the early 18th century. Some were very well preserved and their clothes were intact. Amazing to spend time imagining who they were in life.Other visitors were loud, shouting and laughing. We felt they should have shown a little more respect. We were, after all in a mass grave!Highly recommended."
904,Morbidly spooky,"I went here to see my relatives and the little girl they said had died in 1925 where they preserved her body. She did not look as good as she did for all those years.  For some reason they opened up her casket I guess to look and find out how she was preserved, and for some reason the air quality in her tomb glass box made her look much older than what she really was. It was eery to look at her. Little Rosalia De Marco looked mummified but I believe that she was enhanced with wax. That is not her real face.. I believe that her father when she died took his daughters face and body and dipped it into a fine glaze of wax. I use this product as they do with my silk products.. You can preserve almost anything in light grade of Wax. and she looked very waxy to the face and hands. So you see they used a method that the rest of us use. He must have also used vinegar to preserve her hair and mixed the wax with the vinegar so that the bugs do not like vinegar and wax. So I enjoyed this to see and My cousin who is also buried here she is a Princess Yolanda, and several aunts and uncles too."
905,Fascinating!,"I was a little nervous entering the Catacombs and soon realized I was right in feeling that way.  I have never seen anything like the sights that awaited there.  But, as I moved through the rooms, my nervousness faded and I became intrigued by what I was seeing.  Well worth a visit, expected to be a bit weirded out at first but a must see."
906,spooky! do it!,"The Catacombs were unreal, at first I felt a sense of embarrassment for gawking at the bodies of the dead after I overcame that it became an amazing experience."
907,Love: Macabre and Eternal,"This will sound like a negative review, but it isn't. Take away the shock factor, and there is still much to recommend about going to this site. I like places that move me. Sometimes it is beauty that does the trick, other times, as here, it is how the places makes me think. The Catacombs fall squarely into that latter category.Yes, I gawked. I was even tempted to take pictures despite the ""No Foto"" signs everywhere. But in the end, there was something so deeply disturbing about seeing all the remains of these people, most hung vertically in the equally decayed garb some one choose to memorialize them in, the hollow where their eyes used to be, and the grimaces and silent screams decay froze into their visages, that I couldn't take those pictures or stay too long. Did I have to see this? Probably not. Am I glad I went? Yes. So much of visiting historical sites is seeing how people have done things to be remembered. Is it so strange that in this place, people tried to keep their loved ones as they were?  Here we see the folly of that hope and how easily our hubris is turned around.  Down in the catacombs, only tourists like me wandered. This was in sharp contrast to the Necropolis above ground beside the catacombs, where families came with bouquets to rest upon the youthful pictures of their departed, and with blue buckets of water to wash away the dirt and decayed that littered the otherwise green and calming cemetery.  If you go, spend some time there too, and see the only way we can be immortal--in the hearts of those we leave behind, not in ruin of our bodies for all to see."
908,A very unusual sight,My husband and i visited the catacombes on a recent trip to Palermo- our first time.  The cost was 3 EU each but you could stay as long as you like.  Please remember that this attraction closes from 1-3pm so don't be too late or too early.  It is a very odd experience to walk around and look at dead people- and believe me there are expressions on their faces even if it's a skull.  I would suggest you try to get a tour or some body to explain the many different rooms and bodies.  We just paid and walked in and really didn't know the history behind what we were seeing.  I thought this was a cool place to visit- my husband thought it was creepy.  A must see-not for those that are uncomfortable with dead people.
909,Bizarre but interesting,"Well... It's not the common place for every body (literally....) ,  it needs a deep breath and a certain cut-off mind in order to survive this place, but it's interesting with no doubt. Still.... Not easy !!"
910,Awesome place,"The catacombs are among the highlights in Palermo, make sure not to miss it. Make sure also to read a little bit in before hand as you won't get any explanatory information once inside. The stage of preservation of some of the mummies is quite stunning and yes, after a while it gets a little creepy than (as other reviewers wrote) even a little boring. Some textual information could maybe prevent this unfortunate effect... Nevertheless, worth a visit! We payed 3 Euro entrance fee."
911,strange but moving experience,I was excited about visiting the catacombs long before I visited Palermo. It didn't disappoint! It was a unique experience to be surrounded by literally hundreds of dead bodies - some just skeletons but some were well preserved. The visit doesn't take long and the surrounding area doesn't seem very nice but I urge anyone visiting Palermo to visit the catacombs.
912,Powerful!,"The bodies in these catacombs are mummified and clothed. There are adults and babies. Some might say you have to be a ghoul to be interested in this place, but we found it compelling. Some of the corpses are hundreds of years old, one or two in fact are dressed in Napoleonic military uniforms. The mummified bodies of children are particularly poignant. The catacombs are part of the monastery, and the visit is still organised by the monks. The entry fee is minimal and the numbers are controlled. Go by bus or taxi, it is a long and hot walk from the centre of Palermo"
913,Facinated but beware those with sensible souls,"We love the odd, the obscure and the unsettling and the Capuchin Catacombs certainly tick all of those boxes!With around 8,000 bodies in various states of preservation, the catacombs provide a creepy form of entertainment.Some still retain skin and hair, still dressed in their Sunday best, others are mere grinning skulls atop a stuffed body.Some are downright sinister, as gravity has made many of their jaws drop so they appear in permanent, silent screams. Some have remnants of skin peeling from their faces.Others are more poignant, a coffin with two small children, lovingly dressed with floral garlands and pretty frocks.Entrance is a mere 3 Euros (well worth it) and for this you get to meander through a maze of underground passages with bodies strung up in alcoves, in glass sided coffins and behind bars.The catacombs are arranged in sections, with one dedicated to the monks themselves, a women;s section, professionals, and sadly an area for babies and children.The main attraction for many people is the curious case of two year old Rosaline, who died over 100 years ago, but due to a secret process, is perfectly preserved, almost like a wax doll. The doctor took his mysterious process to the grave with him (probably for the best!)You can't take photos in the crypt but you can buy postcards of your favourite corpses! (and fridge magnets too .. )"
914,A good example of Roman catacombs,"Lots and lots of dressed up skeletal remains from the mid-19th century. My favorites were the Admirals and Priests. Very sad to see the babies and young kids. Disappointed that they don't allow photos, but do I really want a selfie with a corpse?"
915,Catacombes,This is one of the most unusual places I have ever been. I thought it was a little creepy. I guess at one point that was normal for people to do. I just cant imagine that ever being a good idea in our current time. Some of the corpse are in excellent condition which is baffling since they are mostly from the 1800s.
916,A different way to look at death.,"We didn't know what to expect from this place.  We thought it would be more like the catacombs in France or Rome.  This was entire bodies clothed pinned against the wall.  The heads were lolling about.  Apparently the rich of previous years liked to be embalmed and put here in their finest clothes or military outfits.  There were lots of bodies from the 19th century which I found surprising.  I guess I thought catacombs were an ancient history thing.  There weren't any explanations in English which I thought was a pity.  I'd have liked to learn more about the who and the why this place existed.  For example, some of the bodies looked like they had their necks broken and a piece of rope around the neck - were they criminals?  We didn't know why criminals would be in the catacombs along with the area's wealthy."
917,catacombs,"I'm not really keen of death or macabre places. But curiosity was too strong, so we visited this place. It's interesting although a bit morbide. You can park a car just in front of the entry. The parking should be free but there were men demanding 2 ‚Ç¨. We paid just to be sure to find the car where we parked it when we would come back. The entrance fee is 3‚Ç¨, the visit lasts at max 15 min (if you really examine all the corpses). It leaks the explainations so get some info before entering."
918,Once you've seen one....,"Be respectful when you come here, first of all.It's a little creepy to see dressed skeletons hanging off the walls, but interesting still.It's sad the state of decay they are in with limbs missing and such. Especially sad are the children who died so young and obviously were so loved. There's no one to care for them now.No photos allowed (it's disrespectful anyway)."
919,Corpres made alive with style,"A place for Day of the Dead Lovers, with real mummified skeletons on display -- not those artful ones you see in Mexico.  This is a real tomb with real bodies.  If Memento Mori is your passion, this is a must-see."
920,So much history,"Thousands of bodies in various states of preservation--monks, priests, men, women, children--on shelves, in open coffins, hanging on hooks.Don't try to take pictures. They really mean it when they tell you not to."
921,hard to find,"I thought it was going to be just a few dry bones and some skulls. But this was jaw-droppingly macabre. The bodies are in coffins, standing upright, in niches and literally hanging from the wall. All in various stages of mummification and all dressed in their Sunday best, which makes it somewhat unnerving. Some still with facial hair and chilling expressions. Quite confronting, especially seeing some children like this. The stuff of nightmares. Do NOT take the kids with you."
922,"The Sicilian ""mummies""","I found it fascinating, though my partner got a bit creeped out by the end so we didn't spend as much time as I might have done on my own. I think if I'd stayed longer it would have been more in contemplation rather than anything else. That said I don't think you need to set aside much time to go round once you get there.There wasn't much information available, very little in the way of explanation, though I am sure there were the more glossy guide books available for sale at the entrance. It's pretty basic and it hasn't been 'prettyfied' or 'museumified' (sorry!) and I got the impression that what you see is pretty much as it was originally intended to be. To get there we hopped on a bus from Piazza dell' Independenzia, bus driver very helpful (we found the day bus tickest very useful) It's difficult giving an overall rating - I am torn as I often am between average and very good  (I wish there was a just plain good). If you find this an interesting topic, the it's definitely very good, but as a more general 'attraction' then I would say it was average. Oh, and there was a nice fruit strall across the road - cherries and apricots, yummmmmmm"
923,Fascinating,"A family trip to Sicily, and of course we had to visit the catacombs. My boyfriend and his family had been there several years ago, and the protection of the skeletons was much improved since last time. It takes app. 45 minutes to go through the rooms, but there are so many details to notice. There are ""exhibitions"" showing e.g. a living room with the family and a nursery with children, macabre but fascinating. One of the best things was the ""Sleeping Beauty"". Remember clothes which covers shoulders and knees, not only out of respect for the monks but also because it is a bit cold in the catacombs"
924,Very Moving,"I went there with my sister and spent over an hour there just analyzing everything. So many details, so many stories untold. We wished we had background stories of some of them, because we were so curious. It's amazing, will definitely come back one day!"
925,Exceptional place!,"Something between a museum and  a slightly nightmarish dream. The rows of dead people stare at you from the walls, room after room. You wonder what it would be like to visit the place at night, with a candle in your hand..."
926,Bones,"My wife had some reservations about visiting the catacombs, but we were both fascinated by this unique if somewhat strange site. Not at all 'spooky' as you might imagine, but quite moving to see how human remains have been 'stored' and looked after."
927,Odd,"I didn't want to go but my wife did so we went.  We took the yellow hop on hop off bus to the site.  Check the schedule carefully of the bus.  Also accessible by public bus, car or taxi.  A couple of euro to get in. No photography permitted but no one followed that rule cause the dead mummy's were too weird to pass up. Down some stairs there were  Thousands of mummies organized by age, profession, etc all in the clothing they died in.  Mummies are attached to the wall and close enough to touch but ugh no way.    Some looking very real.  Sad part was the children's section.  There was a tiny chapel were we sat for a while.  My wife said she pretended that the people were fake so she could get through this experience.  You don't need much time in this place maybe 45 minutes to an hour.  Then, pleasant dreams."
928,Fascinating but creepy,"I toured the catacombs because it looked really interesting, but I did not like it. Not because it wasn't interesting, presented well, or historical, I just didn't like seeing dead corpses. They are in various forms of dress according to when they died, some are more ""rotted"" then others, some looked like they were falling apart, I love science, anatomy, life, not death. Interesting, yes, there is an area just with kids, the famous Rosalia who is preserved really well, it was just way too macabre..I also felt like I picked up TB in the chamber, but I know it's all in my head (or chest). Go if you like this kind of thing, I did not..."
929,Very interesting.,"I had always heard about the catacombs and what they were and to be honest I was a little afraid.  Once we were there it eased my mind but knowing you were looking at dead bodies from over hundreds of years old, still a little mind puzzling.  All that was open the bodies were very preserved and amazing to see of how much detail that the monks put into this so many years ago.  The baby in the glass coffin still looks like she is just sleeping."
930,Death the leveller.,"What to expect at Catacombs.  Ok.  I‚Äôll admit it.  I‚Äôve never seen anything like this place before.  And I loved it.  BUT BE WARNED.  There is no point in glossing over it.  It‚Äôs a giant crypt.  Skeletons hang from the walls.  Skeletons lie in coffins.  Men.  Women.  Children.  All in various states of decay.    Their clothing is dripping/rotting off them.  There are LOTS of bodies.  Rooms full.  Most died between 1750 and 1850 as far as I can tell.  It is creepy.  Some will hate it.  Children may freak out.  It‚Äôs not scary.  It‚Äôs just very odd, but fascinating.  Pro Tip: It is a good 20-30 minute walk from Independence Square through a non-touristy area.  And ultimately the neighborhood looked a little rough to us.  Consider cabbing in and out (15 minutes at rush hour to Massimo Square).  Should pay about 15 euro each way."
931,not really that interesting,"Less macabre experience than I had expected, though I would not like to be left down there on my own in the dark. Good experience to remind us all that we are essentially the same and are going the one way; power and riches and status all eventually crumble - so the motto is ' live life to the full and be good to our fellow man'."
932,Amazing - a must see!,"After what we saw in Rome, near piazza Barberini, we have been quite disappointed by this catacombe. For once we are standing well apart from the Tripadivisor consensus...."
933,Best catacombs I have ever visited,"If you don't mind seeing your future in the face, keep on with the idea of going! The skeletons are impressive,never seen any dressed up before to be seen by relatives, including particularly moving ones of children, one of which still looks as if its sleeping.."
934,Incredible...,"All the other reviews sum it up....its probably like Marmite...every bodies reaction is different. We had seen it on TV and being in Sicily thought it might make a change from ruins , church art and volcanoes.  Surprised at how busy with many tour groups !! People who run it are a little brusque and ensure no photos using system of cameras. A booming voice over a hidden speaker telling people off who try to take photos is a bit surreal. Not all visitors were treating it with the respect a burial place deserves but if you advertise and charge what can you expect.We found it all very bizarre and  sad and a touch bad taste but we have a different attitudes culture when it comes to death."
935,See before too late,"Oh my god, one of the most scary and unique places I have ever been... definitely worth a visit, trust me you won't forget this!"
936,A little on the weird side,"I found it fascinating.  Bodies stuffed with straw,  hanging on wires and dressed in their best clothes of the era.  My friend thought they were wax dummies but no .....Priests, business men, ladies of fashion 1800s and children of all ages.  Apparently 6000 in total but a lot are lying down or in coffins that you walk over because they fell apart in the mummifying process.No photos allowed but you can Google some."
937,Unusual but strangely moving,"Regretted making this visit, but it turned out to be just not my sort of activity and left almost straight away."
938,Impressive with teenagers,"This was one of the craziest absolutely most interesting places I've ever visited in all my travels.  Dead bodies hanging on the wall, I mean skeletons, dressed up in their best outfits and in rows, divided by gender, age, and profession. Skulls lined up on the wall like jars of jam. It's absolutely insane and it's absolutely incredible and you will be enthralled. Takes about an hour and a half to go through it or less, but please go. One tip, for those of you who are driving, you can park in the front of the catacombs by the door, but be careful there are some men out there who are trying to get money from you to watch your car. They are frauds. Don't give them any money."
939,the mummies in the catacombes,"The catacombs are all about the mummies, but the real fascination lies in the clothing.  Get ready for a moth-eaten tour through 19th century fashion.  Many of the bodies are in suits, long Victorian dresses, fur hats, robes and the men in military officer's uniform, one with a three-cornered hat.  The corpses are vivid, but the fact they are so very dead makes them less scary than say, a one or two week old dead person.  The children's area is perhaps the most likely to give you the chills.  Don't miss this as there is probably no where else on earth you can roam around in the presence of so many dapper cadavers.  There is no information provided, so read up before you go.  Photography is not officially allowed, but many people snapped the odd photo without a problem.  Have you seen strict adherence to rules anywhere in Palermo?  My only suggestion would be to have light screaming piped in; they seem to have a sound system set up down there anyway."
940,One of the strangest tourist attractions on earth,"The monks mummified dead collogues and hung them on hooks along the wall. Later, this became fashionable among the wealthy in Palermo too and thousands of people were mummified and hung on display up to about 1920.The first time I was there, around 1988, the mummies seemed more intact. Their condition is deteriorating, and I assume the philosophy of the Capuchins does not accept any maintenance. Also, in the modern, discreet treatment of death, this display might eventually be deemed too grotesque and close to the public.I find it fascinating and thought provoking. I certainly is not entertained by the thought of having my half rotted body displayed for hundreds of years after my death. At the same time, it is moving and not the bit frightening to walk the isles and look at the remains of what was once lying, singing, drinking and loving people."
941,Not really what we expected. Quite disappointing.,This is an very very very strange attraction. I have never seen something like this. It's kind of weird ans unnerving. Just go and have look.
942,creepy!,"Hundreds of corps lined up against the wall or ""popping up"" out of their coffins. Something really unusual that may appear scary. An interesting lesson of history."
943,Memento Mori...,"I first heard about the catacombs in Palermo when I was a child of about 8, from family friends who had visited as part of a tour. Forty years later I finally get round to going!!!! I was in Palermo for the opera (excellent, but a whole other review) and decided to finally realize my desire to visit the catacombs. Living in Italy, I really have little excuse for not having been sooner.... but I digress....Now, the area in which you find the catacombs is quite poor. Nothing actually happened to me, but I was very aware of walking through an area of the city where you might need to exercise caution and be aware of those around you. The catacombs are easily accessible, down a staircase, and are really well lit. This is not a dark, scary, Halloween experience, but a fascinating insight into embalming and burial in Europe in the last centuries. Most of the remains are skeletal, however some still have dried skin on their faces giving them a more mummy like appearance. The clothes are the really fascinating bit. Seeing the actual clothes that people wore is quite something. Notable too, is the fact that people really were smaller. Despite the fact that their bodies have shriveled, their clothes have not! From these we see how small even the most robust of individuals were just a hundred years ago. A few areas of the catacombs have not been well maintained. There are fallen shoes, bones and bits of  body on the ground beneath them. Neglect or just leaving things be? I prefer to think that they allow the place to develop naturally. Certainly, the extent of the security system would suggest that money is not lacking for maintenance. Do NOT try and take photographs, every corner is watched, and a booming voice will shout at you over a loudspeaker, embarrassing you and also making you feel slightly guilty..... Souvenirs are cheap, so makes more sense to buy these. Well worth a visit, even for the slightly squeamish!"
944,Good if Macabre is your thing,"We went to the Catacombs of the Capuchins while in Palermo.  It is a good example of Roman Catacombs.  We did not have time to see catacombs when we were in Rome, so we we glad to be able to see some in Palermo.  The tour was very informative about the religious and burial practices of that time."
945,Oddly fascinating!!!,"odd, vile, interesting and fascinating all at the same time.  I still am not sure how I feel about seeing the dead so close, but am glad I went.  Only need 30 mins in there or you start hearing things!"
946,Place gives you chills with 3 euros,"People wanted to visit their beloved deceased family members after they had died, so many children and babies, too. Many hundreds of skeletons are all dressed up in their best clothes, all returning to dust. This is death and it is real."
947,Interesting yet...,"This was one of our favorite places. It's weird, creepy, unsettling, and gross, but still interesting. It took us a while to find it. We were on the hop-on, hop-off tour, and it doesn't stop very close. Even though it was a bit of a hike, it was well worth it. There are about 8000 skeletons/mummies here. The history behind it on Wikipedia is pretty good. Some are very well preserved, and some of just skeletons. It's also quite cheap--I think it was only 4 euros to get in. Definitely different from anything we've done before. Plus, you get to see ""I see dead people"" the whole time you're there."
948,I see dead people,"I haven't see a catacomb like this before so don't know how it compares, but I won't forget it! Lines of bodies, upright, decaying away (with no smell....) dressed (often 19th century), and sometime in couples. Some look peaceful, some contorted. Even an infants room. Yes, it's creepy but it has a genuine feel about it. No photos inside, but some people cheat. 25 minutes walk from the cathedral - dodging the cars parked on the pavement. Most people seem to go by bus, but the walk is doable."
949,Interesting,"Interesting to see, but not as moving or indeed as macabre as I might have imagined. Too much a tourist attraction and too far removed from the Cappucin community to have the meaning it is meant to possess."
950,Spooky but interesting,"The order of Capuchin Friars dates back to the 1500‚Äôs and this abbey was dedicated to their usage.Whilst the abbey itself is not a fantastic building, the catacombs are the true marvel and are not like any other attraction in Europe.Here you will travel underground into the vast catacombs and see a macabre variety of burials and well preserved bodies from various periods in time.We had a tour and we came across a bizarre burial ground containing over 8000 bodies!"
951,Fascinating,"We knew what we were getting into, but the scope of the place was incredible. It was vast. Hundreds upon hundreds of monks and others spending eternity. Dying and knowing you would be reunited with your brethren must give some comfort to the living, but that conviction is‚Ä¶"
952,"Bizar, but worth the trip!",A truly gruesome experience. I have visited catacombs before but have never seen anything like this. Not worth the visit . Quite a long way of the tourist trail.
953,Much larger then anticipated,"I don't doubt for a second that the costume and set designers of the Indiana Jones movies must have visited here for both inspiration and research.To learn that the Capuchin Monks began placing the members of their order here in 1599, at a time when bodies of the holy were often considered relics and put on display was fascinating.  As time passed, it became fashionable to be interred in the catacombs.  Different areas house Merchants, lawyers, military, virgins, children, etc.  In these modern times, most people fear and are repelled by death - but clearly, between the 16th and early 20th century, there was an acceptance and reverence; perhaps because people were closer to death than we are today.This is one of the most fascinating I have ever visited.  History, culture, science, religion... the catacombs of the capuchin monks has it all.  There's also, obviously, the elements of the macabre. It is seldom one can truthfully state, ""There's probably no other place on earth quite like this.""  But with the Catacombs of the Capuchin Monks, I feel safe making this statement.  My entire family came, and found it to be a unique experience that we would all do again - albeit all for different reasons."
954,Why I will be cremated,"The catacombs are filled with mummified bodies and skeletons of former residents of Palermo who died between the 17th and 19th centuries.For a modest entrance fee you descend steps into the underground tomb.It's a very strange sight seeing bodies still dressed in decayed clothing right in front of you.There were different sections for men, women and an area for infants as well as priests and Virgins (!) each contained separately.The bodies were all in different states of decay but some still had hair.The best preserved was a 2 year old girl who you can view close up in a glass case.  It was an interesting experience but I was glad to emerge back into daylight!The catacombe is an easy walk from the city centre but the traffic is quite busy and crossing some of the roads was an ""interesting"" experience!"
955,Very special,"Visited here on an excursion to Monreale and Palermo. I was rather taken aback when we first went in, mainly by the sheer size of the catacombs and number of bodies. It was fascinating ,in a macabre sort of way, to see them wearing clothes which reflected their professions etc. and the various facial features. I am pleased I went but I did feel I was wrongly intruding on something that should have been kept private for them. I don't think it would be right to take children - these spectacles are nothing like Egyptian mummies. Was I pleased I went - on balance probably yes. It's not something I will ever see again - or wish to !!"
956,"fascinating but yes, macabre","While the Catacombs are described as being 'behind"" the Cathedrial, and indeed tney are, they're not close behind.  We took a taxi from the Four Corners and were glad we did.  The driver told us our visit would be only 15-20 minutes and he was right on target.  he offered a flat rate to wait and make it a round trip - perfect.  The bodies and methods used to preserve them are fascinating and creepy at the same time.  There are tours available.  We read about the Catacombs online and walked around by ourselves early in the day before the large groups arrived.  There was a small fee for entry.  What amazed me most was the clothing worn, including shoes and hair still visible on some of the bodies.  Some still have eyeballs - talk about creepy.  It's one thing to see old clothing in a museum but to see it still on the owner is quite something else.  I would hesitate to bring young children.  No photos are allowed."
957,Eye opener,"By mid afternoon we had 'done' the main sights in Palermo  and were hot and tired. We had ended up on the waterfront expecting to find a park area where we could sit and watch the world go by.   However, the beach front failed to inspire so we looked at our guide book to see what we had misesed.  The catacombs looked 'different' so we paid an extortionate amount for a taxi to the other side of the city in the hope that the ‚Ç¨3 entrance fee would not be wasted.This was a fascinating insight into a ritual that was far removed from our experience. There were several corridors of decayed or sometimes embalmed bodies, dressed as they would have been in life. Most were anonymous to us though a few had explanations attached.  I can see that for some people it would be inappropriate to visit a place like this and stare at the dead, but it offered an interesting insight into the rituals of Sicilians in the past (the last interment being in the 1920s) and their attitudes to the dead.   Photography is not allowed."
958,Mummified,"My best friend had been telling me about this place since we were kids.  It was one of the ""must see"" spots on my trip to Palermo.  It was everything I thought and more.  You are up close and personal with the bodies.  It's very creepy and at the same time spiritual.  Seeing these prominent people in state, just as they were hundreds of years ago, in the same clothes they were waked in.  It's just amazing.  It's not gory, it's really a very interesting peek back in history."
959,Creepy but worth the visit,"We didn't know what to expect.  It was interesting.  Off cappuccini road.  There's corpses of babies , men and women.  Either laying or hanging."
960,A highlight of our trip,"The catacombs were a cheap freak show, lots of people (dead bodies) suspended for titilation; poorly stuffed with straw & suspended in well niches by wires around the neck. Any serious possibilites were swamped by the bad presentation."
961,Vanity more powerful than death,"As catacombs go, this can't be beat . Lotsa dead people hangin off the walls. Fun for the first 15 minute , then one dead body looks like all the others . Perfectly preserved ""Sleeping Beauty "" looks like a porcelin doll. Worth a look , if only for a short while ."
962,Sobering,"The Catacombs in Palermo are different than the bone art seen in the Capuchin crypt in Rome and the Roman Catacombs,  The hundreds of bodies displayed in Palermo are upright, clothed in their 200-300 year old garmets and in an amazing state of preservation due to the climate/humidity. Most of the bodies have naturally mummified and are in a state of arrested decay.. Others were actually mummified and have an erie level of preservation. The facility is in a large basement complex, rather than a cave or series of tunnels. THe facility is well illuminated, ventilated and accessed via metal walkways with handrails. The men and women's attire/hair styles provides a museum quality view of styles of the past. The display actualy brings these people to life so that we can honor them as individuals. the display is done with the utmost of respect. One young child has been there for 90 years.. she looks fresh and like she just went to sleep. It's an interesting, thought provoking and personal experience to see people from our past . at rest..   A one of a kind experience. That can leave you with a sense of peace about your own mortality. My father visited the site in the 1940s when the Allies swept thru the town, He never forgot his visit to this sacred site."
963,Macabre,"This place is one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen. All those dead people hanging out... Some of them look like they're chatting, some just seem lonely and neglected. My wife is quite oversensitive, however she did not feel uneasy, just a bit stunned about the insanity of the stuff. I would suggest to go just for a bit of morbose curiosity, or if you have seen everything else in Palermo and you have got spare time."
964,A different approach about death.,"This catacomb is much larger than the one in Rome and has, in addition to priests/monks, a number of families including children.  Very interesting as well as sad.  Takes about 20 minutes to go through."
965,Three Euros: it fills an hour,"According to the legend, the Cappuccini monks were named after they kept the hoods of their garments to be pointed instead of rounded. The believed changing this style was a deviation from history. The museum attached to the catacombs details the full history of the traditions held and the reasons why they believe the catacombs came into existence. The welcoming address itself (near the front doorway) serves to strike immediate thought as to 'why are we here' and 'what is the reason for our existence'. There is a lot of information, however highlights an interesting tale and legend. The catacombs themselves are stunning. Initially I was devastated as to why someone would do this, but I reminded myself that this was an act of love and a way to express devotion and art at the same time. As the opening address indicates, it will leave you considering mortality. Well worth the time and cost.  Note: Unfortunately there are no pictures allowed in the catacombs or museum and they are very strict about this."
966,meh,"I planned this as my first stop on a Saturday morning, so arrived just prior to opening time at 9 AM. Only a few other visitors at that time, which was good. The catacombs themselves were a surprise, with skeletons still wrapped in their burial outfits hanging from hooks on the walls, stuffed into coffins with one side removed for viewing. Entire walk-around takes about 20 minutes or so. Skeletons are in various stages of maintenance, some with jaws hanging askew, some with skulls scrunched down onto coat collars. There are areas for rich folks, military, priests, children and even ""virgenes."" A distinctly creep place, but, after all, it's where we all wind up eventually."
967,"Quirky and macabre, but fascinating!","I think it's best to do some research before going. I was quite apprehensive at first but found the catacombs to be well lit, ventilated and respectfully done. It cost ‚Ç¨3. Be warned, it can be difficult at times, especially in the areas dedicated to children and babies."
968,Creepy!,"From the 18th century through to the start of the 20th century, the good citizens of Palermo decided that upon their decease, they would find eternal rest in these catacombs. Not only that: they were to enter and remain in their finest clothing. They are displayed as such to this day, either in family groups or in other hierarchies including professionals such as doctors and lawyers, clergy, nuns and virgins.  Even children have their own dedicated corner.  To say the least the experience of the visit is somewhat weird. There will be very few occasions in life when a visitor will see so many dead people in one place. However, these were all folk who others really cared for and the overall impression of the visit is life affirming.  The site is away from the centre of Palermo and in our case involved a taxi ride there (‚Ç¨10) and walk back through some less than interesting streets. Very well worth making the effort however."
969,Very interesting,"In November it was practically deserted, which added immeasurably to the atmosphere. I didn't find it especially scary myself, but fascinating - the contorted bodies, the gaping, part-skinned skulls, the dessicated bodies wrapped in their best clothes. Well worth the visit."
970,Not that special,"A short drive by taxi from Palermo's City Centre, the Catacombs of the Cappuccino monks , is worth an hour of your time.  We had seen most other attractions in Palermo so going here was ""icing on the cake"".  Seeing this vast underground cemetery is a unique, macabre attraction. If you are squeamish don't go.  The bodies were buried clothed and divided by sex and social class..... some embalmed and preserved. Certainly gives you a sense of your own mortality."
971,Interesting and Large,Never imagined it would be as it was - nothing like anything I've ever seen before. I'm glad I did see it though.
972,Not as eerie as expected,"If the Capuchins chose to store the human remains of their followers by hanging them in a catacomb, up to them. But displaying them to the public centuries later: what on earth is the point? Visit the Palazzo Zisa instead if you're in that part of town - another great example of Arab Norman history."
973,THe catacombs are nothing like you have seen before. Perfectly preserved people in their garmets for the 1700s.,"Fully dressed skeletons and mummified bodies from the XVIII-XIX century, hanging on the walls. Separate corridors for the monks, for the priests, for the craftsmen, the children, and the virgins.Very special atmosphere."
974,Wow - what a place,"When we first read up about going here I must admit was a little bit worried, but there really was no need to be. It cost 4 euros each to get in, there is a free guided tour but it is worth just buying the small book for a further five euros and just wander through yourself. It is really sad, overwhelming but enjoyable all at the same time. I'm glad we have done this but not sure I would go again. Lombardo Rosina is a very famous child who was the last person to be embalmed this way at the age of 2 in 1920. She is a glass coffin and really quite beautiful to see, very moving. The bodies are a bit strange especially with the hair and teeth still on them when they are about 200 years old but they do seem to be at peace. Quite an odd experience but well worth the visit."
975,Macabre but brillant,"The respectful displays of the many deads in various states of decay and mummifaction are a reminder of our own mortality. There is absolutely no show aspect to the catacombs; the Capuchins are just monks respecting and taking care of the dead, whether they are monks, civilians,‚Ä¶"
976,More reflective than enjoyable.....,I would not say I am particularly ghoulish but this was interesting and slightly disturbing at the same time. There are rows of corpses some hung some laid out all in full dress of the period. The corpses are preserved in the caves following the Cappuccini traditions which started it. Certainly something to see but left me with a strange feeling and to be honest I was happy to see the sun again. No photography is allowed inside.
977,amazing yet scary,"When I first entered the catacombs, I thought it was a Halloween spook house. I was completely unprepared for what we were seeing. It is not a place for young children.  Strangely fascinating and well worth a visit.No photographs allowed."
978,It makes you shiver,"About 800 bodies, the first dating from 1599, lie or hang in the catacombs, creating a macabre sight. They look dessicated and rather dusty. A young girl embalmed in the 1920s is rather more disturbing. She looks like a painted doll. It seems awkward staring at her as if she is a tourist curiosity (which, unfortunately, she now has become.) There are far more must-see sights in Palermo, but if you are at a lost end...."
979,odd,"Demonstrating a 19th-century obsession with death, clearly coupled with deep religious confidence in the resurrection of the body, the catacombs are both moving and extremely odd. At ‚Ç¨3 to get in, you won't find many better value tourist bargains. We didn't have a guide and did not feel the lack of one. The experience of seeing hundreds of corpses placed on display, obviously in accordance with the wishes of the deceased, is what you go for. It's not for everyone. And not, in my view, suitable for anyone under about 15, unless very mature. It needs a bit of respect and a sense of history. Very interesting and I'm glad I went. Easy to combine in one day with catching the local bus to the 12thC cathedral at Monreale, which is excellent."
980,Carpe diem...,"After visiting the Capuchin Catacombs in Roma, I was interested in visiting the catacombs in Palermo.  However, they were entirely different.  I suppose it's worth a visit if you're interested in the history of the Capuchins, but not if you're pressed for time."
981,Amazing if a little weird,"Well...what can one say about this place... Odd? Obscene? Something like that.I felt like some kind of peeping tom, because we were in those peoples¬¥ grave.This was one of the very few places where I have been and not taken any photos. I¬¥ve photographed for 30 years and I have taken photos inside the pyramides and in the holest places in Vatican etc. but the reason for not taking photos here was their heartfelt request ""Please no photos, this is our grave"".So I wonder those photos someone has taken - and even put them in here! Shame on you!"
982,Too creepy,"If yer nae inta it dinna look at it.Fa kens, full of ideed folks. Affa scary. My breeks were affa foul fan I went ben ihoose."
983,Scooby Doo eat your heart out,"The Capuchin Catacombs is a creepy, gruesome burial site for thousands of mummified bodies and corpses. You descend into the enormous maze of underground catacombs of the monastery, to walk among the dead.Corpses (including babies) hang from the walls, are stacked on shelves, sealed in glass cases and are are fully clothed, Priests, wealthy people, virgins, children are among them. Our guide said the black plague was the cause of the deaths.Remarkably dry and no odors....kind of like a horror movie set."
984,lives up to expectations,I didn't know what to expect going down those stairs to the underground room full of catacombs. But it was definitely not what I felt : I had a mixture of emotions that made me feel humble and pushed me to appreciate life and what has been given to us to use it for the good of the world before we leave it !Drama-free :)
985,WEIRD AND WONDERFUL,"This catacomb is run by the St Francesco's jesuits.  The embalming finished in the 1920s and so, towards the end of your walk inside the catacomb, you shall see an almost life-like two years old baby who looked as if she's sleeping.  A lot of effort was put into making her almost perfect and the result showed.  Apart from that, inside the Catacomb, you could smell death and it's rather massive, split up into sections for the priests, virgins, kids etc.  Long time ago, people who partook in embalming originated from well-to-do families and that they wanted to have a continued attachment with their loved ones, which is no different from taxidermist stuffing animals.  All those deceased were all dressed up in their best costumes and that they were tied standing up.  And so, the experience could be rather overwhelming for some people.  For me, anyhow.  As I said before, it's not for the faint-hearted.  Photography is strictly forbidden and so, all reviewers who put their pictures up here had definitely not respecting the regulations stipulated."
986,Brrrrr,"We visited the catacombs in the morning not quite knowing what to expect. Dead bodies. Hundreds of them. It was morbid, gross, intriguing, amazing. We had never seen anything like this before. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in Palermo. A once in a lifetime experience. I wouldn't bring kids. It's pretty gruesome - the stuff nightmares are made of. Haha. Check it out. You wont be disappointed."
987,it's a bit of a hike - but interesting,"The catacombs are int he basement level of the Monasterio dei Capuccini in Palermo, and it consists of corridors covered with mumificated dead bodies. Some of them unbelievingly well preserved... so much that it can give you creeps! All in all, it is one of the miracles and undescibable sensations."
988,Morbid yet worth seeing,Not an ossuary but rather a disturbing display of mortal remains.  Mummified remains are hung on the walls clothed in disintegrating tatters.  It was really very bizarre and disturbing.
989,Morbid with a touch of perversity,We arrived at the catacombs at opening time (9 AM) and were the first in the door. The ticket seller was pleasant. The attraction was one of the places that my wife really wanted to see in Palermo. No pictures allowed inside but reasonable souvenirs at the entrance. Not for everyone but those who like funerary places will think this is pretty cool
990,Shivers all around,"If you're a little bit curious, morbid, and sick--as I consider myself--you'll probably get a kick out of this place. Fans of Europe's Weirdest Dead People Exhibits like the crypts in Rome, Sedlec(CR), etc. will enjoy the preserved fashions of bygone eras, and strange, often expressive ways in which the deceased folks here are positioned, as if in the midst of a private conversation that you've rudely interrupted. As always, these displays serve to memorialize the tragedy and fleeting nature of corporeal existence, but the well-preserved state of some of these moral coils and their outer threads give it an added animated spookiness--and perhaps a touch of unintended humor."
991,Macabre and interesting.,"I'm not exactly sure if I've liked it or not, but it is one of those things that captures you, like a car accident: it is awful but you simply cannot look away. It's is huge, with over 8000 deceased people - including the adjacent cemetery - and more than 1200 mumies! They even divided it into ""themed"" halls: man, women, friars and priests, professionals and children - yes, little mummies, some of them of newborns, others in poses, looking down on you. Apparently what was once just part of the capuccini friars tradition to mumify their companions, became a business for them: notables would pay big money to have themselves or their relatives preserved after their deaths. They even kept the deceased in standing position, tied to hooks on the walls, some of them are still positioned like that. Chills! The better preserved mummy is from Rosalia Lombardo, a baby girl who died of pneumonia in 1920, a little short of her second birthday. She is disturbingly preserved, like a little baby sleeping in a glass coffin. It is worth the visit, but I'm still a bit nauseated. I would recommend it!"
992,Horror puppet show,"I didn't quite know what to expect, but this was a bit more disturbing than i thought it would be. People that like this stuff will love it!"
993,One of the stangest thigs I've seen,"The catacombs of the Capuchines, located just outside the city centre, are one of the most peculiar places to visit in Palermo. The mummies (rather skeletons), dressed in their contemporary costumes, make them look like a horror scene. At the same time, it is like a trip back into time. The most appealing (wrong word, I know) body is the one of Rosalia Lombardo, the young girl who died in 1920 and whose body looks as if she fell asleep yesterday. The entrance fee is very modest. The only disadvantage is that it is not allowed to take photographs. And for those who still want to give it a try, even with a smartphone: big brother is watching you!"
994,Macabre but moving.,"Seeing as I'm not all that squeamish, I wasn't particularly bothered by the catacombs (although I found the childrens' section a little sad). The remains are in various states of decay - mostly skeletal- but are well, well past the due date and don't, it should be noted, smell (in my mind, an important consideration for the faint of heart). So, If you have a couple of days in Palermo; don't get queazy easily, the catacombs are well worth a visit. However, if stuff like this freaks you out, even in the slightest, I would recommend bringing along a friend, as, late this morning, I was the only visitor. Another thing, as others have mentioned, the Capuchini catacombs are a little off the beaten track and, if you're walking there, I would suggest first taking a stroll on Google Maps to orient yourself."
995,Worth a Quick Visit,"A seriously weird experience.  Dozens of skeletal remains line the walls of this catacomb, decked out in their Sunday best, staring down at the gawping visitors.  Some have their mouths hanging open, some have heads caved in.  You walk down rows arranged by designation - men, women, professors and most macabre children.  Even weirder one little girl is preserved in fluids staring up at the ceiling.  Very weird place.  It's a shame you cannot take photos as I'm not sure anyone will believe this..."
996,Very interesting and unusual,"I was just a kid when I went to the catacombs for the first time ... that night I didn't sleep. It seemed to have seen a horror film. However, today, forty years later, I suggest all tourists to see this charming place. You will see thousands of dead bodies, a few centimeters from you.For the tour takes about an hour, the ticket is not expensive. Maybe better not to take the kids ... or adults are a little scary !!!!"
997,weird,"The Capuchin Catacombs display the mummified bodies of past church priests and friars of the Capuchin Monastery along with some of Palermo‚Äôs elite.  The last interments at the Catacomb was made in the 1920‚Äôs and since that time it has been open for ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù  The Catacombs are well laid out with well over 100 bodies either lying on concrete or wooden slabs or place upright against the Catacomb walls.  The Catacombs are well lit with tile/concrete walkways, so you are not fumbling around in a dark and dank cave of some sort trying to see.While it is certainly something you don‚Äôt see everyday and worth the visit, the place is a bit on the morbid side.  However, it does put our transient lives into perspective as you get to see exactly were and what you are eventually going to look like at some point down the road.  Also note that they do not allow pictures or videos to be taken."
998,Strange visit but got to be done,This ranks up there with the Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini on the Via Veneto in Rome. Not for the squeamish but fascinating the way everyone is hung and placed according to their occupations. The children are especially haunting.
999,Eerily fascinating!,"The Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo (also Catacombe dei Cappuccini or Catacombs of the Capuchins) are burial catacombs in Palermo, Sicily, southern Italy. Today they provide a somewhat macabre tourist attraction as well as an extraordinary historical record."
