0,A bit different from other areas of Cappadocia!,"The Devrent Valley is mainly covered with rock formations that are somewhat different from the fabled chimneys.  There are more solid shapes here, many resembling animals (if you have some imagination)!"
1,Magnificent rock formations ,"The landscape of the Devrent Valley is completely unique, with its fairy chimneys and tall rocks forming shapes such as a camel, seal, dolphin and snake. This is the lunar landscape for which Cappadocia is famous. Wear sturdy shoes, practical clothes and take a hat and water, as it's really hot during the day. You don't have to be an experienced climber, but you do need to be sure of foot and in relatively good health as some of the terrain can be challenging and slippery underfoot. Fabulous spot for a hike amongst some incredibly unusual scenery!"
2,Nice view from above,"Devrent Valley ,also known as Pink Valley and Imaginary Vally...Which reveals many different rock formations...It took me to my childhood days,when i used to sit on our front yard & look up at the skyand used to imagine in the clouds, shapes like deer,bunny,elephant,dragons,angels and many more .here also,.@ Imaginary Valley just let your imagination run free.....It's fun...."
3,Imagination valley,The Devrent Valley is also known as the Pink of Imaginary Valley because of the various animal shaped rocks. These are strange volcanic rocks and may attract many interpretations to their form.
4,Great Natural Wonder. God is truly a Good Artist,"It has least fairy chimneys that Love Valley, but more erosion shaped rocks that resemble many things. It’s a nice walk, and worth at least a 20 min visit."
5,Good but not must see,"Devrent Valley is also called Imagination Valley. You can see rocks that resemble various shapes. There's the prominent Camel rock. Then, there's one that resembles kissing ducks, the three sisters as per Australian legend and so on. You can use your own imagination. It's a nice place to click photos."
6,One of its kind in the world ,Imagination valley as the name suggests is a small valley which has rocks of various shapes resembling animals. The most obvious one is the camel shaped rock. Kids enjoy the place imagining everything. For adults it was a good stop with no walking. There is so much walking in any cappadocia tour that you enjoy just standing. There is a restaurant where one can take turkish tea or ice cream. It's good enough for lunch also. But it is not a must visit.
7,"Fairie chimneys , Camel rock",Devrent Valley is also known as Imagination Valley due to some of the rock formations resembling animal shapes such as a camel and snake.  You can lose control with your camera here there is so muck to photograph.  The tracks amongst the formations can be steep and slippery so you have to be a little careful but t is not difficult.
8,Imagination,"You will be astonished at the amazing rock formations. Between the fairy chimneys and the shapes that look like animals and other things, you will not know what to view first.Have traveled extensively and have never seen anything like this before.Get your camera ready and wear good hiking shoes."
9,Imagine pure,"Devrent Valley displays a large number of rock formations that erosion has turned into animal and other recognizable forms. For example, when we stopped here on the red tour of Cappadocia for a photo op, I immediately noticed a huge ""camel"" formation. But I also saw a snake, Napoleon's hat, a dancing couple and much more. It was similar to gazing at clouds in the sky, which sometimes assume identifiable shapes. In this case, the shapes are permanent.Also known as Imagination Valley, this area holds no cave churches or signs of former inhabitants. But I think it is worth at least a short stop to see what nature has sculpted. There are paths that lead past the formations for a closer look. For those traveling solo, the valley is a short drive from Goreme."
10,Very good but the excellence of the others puts here in the shade a bit.,Also known as Imagination Valley. Filled with unique looking Fairy Chimneys resembling animal shapes. The area is full of tourists who come for photography. Worth visiting only if you have extra time to spend in Cappadocia. But I would not prioritize it over other landmarks.
11,Nice,"Also known as the Imaginary Valley or the Pink Valley, this is a good little spot with lots of eroded pillars in which you can imagine various creatures or objects. If you don't wish to walk far, you can just stand and look around you and ""see"" things. However, if you wish there are trails and you can explore the rock formations more thoroughly from different perspectives. A fun place to explore."
12,Imagination stupefied,"Devrent Valley, which is also known as Imaginary Valley and also as Pink Valley does not have cave churches like the other valleys of Cappadocia.The lunar landscape!Devrent Valley (also spelled as Dervent Valley) reveals many different rock formations and is only a 10 minute drive from Goreme. The small fairy chimneys in the valley form a lunar landscape, or moonscape, by their strange look. The valley also has many animal shaped rocks. It looks like a sculpture zoo made by nature. Some of the most important, or the easiest seen animal shapes are camel, snake. If you let your imagination run free you will find many others."
13,Prepare to use your Imagination,"Devrent Valley (also spelled as Dervent Valley) reveals many different rock formations and is only a 10 minute drive from Goreme. The small fairy chimneys in the valley form a lunar landscape, or moonscape, by their strange look. The valley also has many animal shaped rocks. It looks like a sculpture zoo made by nature. Some of the most important, or the easiest seen animal shapes are camel, snake, seals, and dolphin. If you let your imagination run free you will find many others. It is like looking at clouds and seeing a dragon. There is even a rock pillar which looks like Virgin Mary, holding Jesus Christ."
14,Dervent Valley ,"Devrent Valley literally means Imagination Valley. All the rock formations appear to you as whatever you think it is. Besides the obvious few that your guide may inform you of, you can use your imagination to make out other shapes and things. I found Gandalf and several body parts 🤣🤣. It’s all good fun. Lovely photo opportunities of this unique landscape too."
15,Unbelievably animal shaped rocks,"The cappadocia region is a bewitching landscape of spectacularly eroded tuff and this valley nicknamed ""imagination valley""is one of the best formed and most thickly clustered.See if you can spot the kissing birds,the dolphin,seals...😊"
16,Imagination Valley,The Devrent Valley is also called the imagination valley where you use the imagination to think of whatever the fairy chimneys could be.
17,Was ok visit ,Cappadocia has so many rock formations valley and Devrent valley is one of them. They called this valley imagination valley because of the shape of rock formations looked like animal shape if you imagine them. The valley is not big and parking is limited; thus spend less than an hour in this place before continuing to see other valley. Still this is very interesting place to visit as the shape of the rocks is one of a kind.
18,The photo you take today my not be the same after a few years,"this was the last stop in red tour. dervent valley is called imagination valley. so basically the rock formations are in shapes that can be imagined to be something like a camel, two ppl talking etc"
19,Imagining shapes,"Devrent valley is about 10min from Goreme.  This is a must visit as the site shows natural rock formations created many moons ago.  It looks like an open air museum where one could experience rock formations in many different forms like my favourite a camel, an old lady and two ducks kissing.  Love this and the shape are all unique to the observer."
20,Interesting place to visit.,"The lower layer of rock is much softer than the protecting cap rock, making it easy to collapse, changing the scenery from year to year."
21,Beautiful place,"The lunar landscape is a visual delight with a variety of rock formations. Many of these formations take an animal form or human form and it is fun to guess the formations. Camel, lizard, human hand with fingers, Napoleans hat, dolphin, love birds, the letter H are some of them. A must visit in Cappadocia."
22,Use your Imagination,Amazing rock formations and very different from other valleys like Love valley and Pigeon Valley. Views from the highway on top is superb
23,amazing rock formations stirring imagination,"We started our Cappadocia tour by visiting Devrent Valley. Nice rock formation with animal shapes like fish, love birds and human hands. Many souvenir shops. Few minutes is enough"
24,Amazing rock formations,"Deviant Valley is nicknamed ""Imagination Valley"" because many of the rock formations appear to me in the shape of a Virgin Mary Statue, a camel (they had to put a fence around the camel rock formation because people tried to ride it), two ducks kissing, etc...  It a very cool location to visit in Cappadocia."
25,Imaginary Figures,"This is also called imagination valley and can be spelt dervent valley. It is amazing. To get here we used our sat nav. It took us to completely the wrong place! Eventually we followed the road out of Goreme in the opposite direction to Avanos. We stopped to see down the valley at the side of the road. We then turned the next left and after 10 mins took the next left to parking and the shops/stalls. There are no toilets here. Once you see the camel fenced off, follow the path behind aiming for the caves at the back. We found these paths suitable for young children so long as you hold hands. We had fun looking at the rocks and deciding what we could see or what they looked like. We also loved climbing. If we had had more snacks with us we probably would have stayed all afternoon."
26,Great spot to wander around,Imagination Valley where the Camel's Rock formation and other animals or people are depicted and which also looks like a lunar scene is a nice place to look at. It can also be a walking tour but some of the slopes are slippery.The place could be better managed and would probably have more tourists if they have proper parking areas and more organized entry and exit of peopleWe stayed there a short period only as part of the Cosmos tour but the place is something to behold
27,Rocks and Shops !,"The valley is full of strange shaped rocks and the game is to use your imagination to describe what they should look alike.If you don't see, no problem, just enjoy the amazing view, don't worry about comparaisons."
28,The first stop,"amazing natural rock formations as a result of volcanic eruptions, ash and lava with strong wind erosions"
29,Walk through it,"Incredible scenery, the formations created gracing your imagination ... You can see kamiles, the hat of Napoleon or dolphins ... The imagination has no limits, a pleasant time during the Red tour."
30,Fantastic,Traveling to this place in Aug heat was bit difficult but we had great experience here. All these are supposed to have fallen during volcanic eruption many thousand years ago and they hit the earth so hard that it created great foundation for themselves.But One question. How come so many structures and so similar in places were created? Was it just a natural phenomenon? Even man designed structures cannot be so huge and unique with similarities. The structure resembling a Camel was probably damaged by people....Nature or God is truly a great Artist.
31,Use your imagination,Good view from above and good in the valley. Oddly the Cafe on the hill is facing away and has a view if the gormless new housing estates in the opposite valley
32,Imagination,I wondered how long it must have taken for the formation of these rock carvings. The whole atmosphere was very calm and serene.
33,"Let your ""imagination"" run wild",This is another short visit in Cappadocia where you get to see animal formation rocks. It's absolutely natural and unbelievable.
34,Amazing,"Interesting rock formations, that look like fish, camels, penquins, hands, people, the Virgin Mary, etc.  Just look around and you'll see them all."
35,Also called the Imagination valley,"The fun thing about this valley is the various lunar rocks strewn throughout it.Use your imagination to define what each rock means to you... You can see animals, people, and different objects. It's all up to you."
36,Awesome but not fully optimized,Devrent imagination valley is a treat for creative people and those who love taking funny and memorable tourist pictures.
37,Give yourself more than an hour here,"Most of my other reviews of the area focused on the wonderful rock formations,  and they were very noteworthy too!  But in this area or valley ;  I loved the shops !  My only regret is the limited storage I have to take home beautiful souvenirs and local art work that is available .  So in summary : there's some great shopping to be had here ."
38,Fun to wander through and climb on the rocks!,"We visited this site as part of our north Cappadocia tour. Unlike the other rock formations in the region, these look like camels, ducks kissing, a sleeping alligator, and so many other shapes. Like cloud watching, you'll enjoy looking at the rocks and figuring out what each one looks like. You won't believe that erosion caused these rock formations. Excellent site to visit."
39,Spectacular view,Our guide led us up the trails and we managed to take a lot of nice photos. The trail is not that difficult to move but not suitable for young children
40,Awesome,"The Devrent Valley is only a short 10 minute drive from Goreme.This area, among others in the region, for a lunar style landscape with many different rock formations.The valley is full of interesting sculptured rocks, all weathered by nature.It is a great place to wander for an hour or two among the captivating fairy chimneys and spot a range of animal shapes.There is also a few souvenir shops and food stalls."
41,Imagination Valley - Interesting rock formations,"It is a very good landscape and in normal circumstances would probably be exceptional in its own right, but there are so many other really magnificent examples that this goes down the list. The imagination part is a little far fetched for me, guess it depends on how much you want the rocks to resemble certain things. It is worth a stop, and there's a car park opposite the main site."
42,Imagination at its peak..!!,"If you look hard enough you can see a mother and baby camel, a clawed hand, kissing ducks and more phallic symbols. You have to use your imagination...hence the apt name"
43,Fun to use your imagination here!,"We did visit this place in July and it was pretty cool actually,  All the places are recomemmend pretty cool places in Kapadokya area.  3-4 days is plety to visit most of them if you have a car.  We did drive around, so I do not know about bookings for those places."
44,Incredible Natural Beauty,"We loved the panoramic views afforded by this part of Cappadocia & thought the structures here were absolutely fascinating. We saw the “camel” & other natural shapes, which didn’t take much by way of imagination to see how Nature intended them to look, including one with a face on it, looking rather grim! Some of the ‘pillars’ look as though they’re topped with caramel ice cream cones. It’s easy to see how it gets its name of “Imagination Valley” & it does feel like Nature has a sense of fun.We were there fairly early in the day so could see a few hot air balloons floating over the area. We also saw a crowd gathering round a car which had the misfortune not to have had its handbrake secured, so it rolled slowly off, on its own journey, into a ditch!"
45,Would have wanted to explore the place thoroughly,"If you are in Cappadocia, Turkey  , you know there are many different valleys to explore, all of them spectacular. Devrent valley is known for its very unusual shapes of the stone formations. There are hiking trails into the valley, which we did for a short while. Just remember to wear proper shoes and have water with you. Definitely worth checking out"
46,Beautiful,"Dervent Valley was another amazing place to visit in Cappadocia.  The light, the shadows, the hills... Everything was superb! Worth visiting."
47,Imagination Valley,"You have to be prompted by your guide to see a rock formation the way it is described.If you see this site in the beginning of your day long trip, it may look fascinating but if it happens at the end this tends to become repetitive. There are too many lores attached to this site which is not as awe inspiring as it is made out to be. One needs to be careful looking at this valley from the roadhead as the vehicles zoom past dangerously. Not a Must to see but Can be included  if there is time to spare."
48,Beautiful,"Devrent Imagination Valley was one of the stops on the Red Tour which we took for 28 euros per person.  Our guide pointed out different rocks and asked if we could see a lizard, camel, ducks.It was worth a quick stop but not as interesting as the other areas in Goreme."
49,Imagination Valley!!,"We walked through it about 30-45 minutes. It was very interesting, quiet, peaceful.Historical.  Guessing what the shapes look like is fun."
50,"Mmmh compared to the paşabağ, red valley & Güllüdere valley",Unfortunately I am from the usa so we have the Grand Canyon On top of that I have been to over 75 counties so asking me was this that impressive It was ok A nice way to spend a couple of Hours hiking around and enjoying the landscapes that have been formed by volcanic and seismic activity over the years
51,Sıradışı,These formations help you to use your creativity and ascribe shapes to these formations.Fun time activity!
52,Great place for a hike,Beautiful rock formations. you can walk around and enjoy the view. it was quite calm and relaxing. we went in the early morning so there were not any tourists
53,Valley of imagination,Interesting place to try ones imagination levels.its a valley spread with various rock formation which look like camel frog dolphin elephant but there is no limitation. May be you may see it differently.
54,Fun Place to Stop,We just stopped by the road and took pictures as we have 3 small kids and it is very steep to go down and through the valley.
55,Nice place for photographing,"It was super fun, to visualise different formations.Mu husband and I loved the place.Also try and walk towards the rocks, it slippery but its total fun time."
56,Between Ürgüp & Avanos,"Cappadocia covers a huge area and it is daunting to know where to start. It is divided into some fantastically named valleys and bounded by the towns Ürgüp, Avanos & Nevşehir. 5km north of Ürgüp you drive through Devrent Valley (Imagination Valley). This is one of the largest and most open areas to explore. On either side of the road are hundreds of eroded volcanic structures, each capped by a blob of hard rock. They have been given names such as the cobra, dogs head, alligator, and the most famous one - the camel. The camel is directly opposite the coach park and currently has a fence around it. The smooth walkways between rocks are steep in places and would be challenging for older travellers or those with mobility issues. Note - you can only walk around these - none of them have been converted into houses in this area."
57,the fairy chimneys,"A must in Cappadocia. Forget what the guides tell you about the rocks, use your imagination and find your own look like rock formation. This can be challenging and funny. If you come with family, try playing: I see a ..... Another gift from nature. Thank you."
58,worth the drive to visit this valley,"This is a great place to pull over in the car, hop out, and wander through all of the stone formations. You can get a little exercise and see this amazing valley from all perspectives. They haven't closed it off from climbing on the formations too, which is physical and fun. It's a great photo opportunity, and easy to fit in even within a busy day of sightseeing in Cappadocia. We saw families with small children as well as wanderlusting 20/30-somethings all enjoying themselves... it's a great destination for anyone!"
59,One of my favourite parts in “The Land of the Beautiful Horse”.,"Great stop for tour groups, rental cars and anyone in the area. Get out and walk around, take lots of pictures and wonder how long it took to get this way. I stopped twice, once with a tour group and a second time in a rental car. Either way it is easy to get around to see some of the many sites in the area."
60,Nature at its best !,"We were there with three kids, ages 9, 6 and 1 1/2.I was stuck with the toddler so my husband took the other two boys with him to explore the valley. The pathways down were very steep so the three of them turned back after a while. (One boy claims he ""almost died""!)From my vantage point at the carpark, I could spot visitors who managed to make their way up to some of the formations up the hills. This is not an easy trek. If I had come without the children, I'd be keen to tackle the climb."
61,Playful Nature,Most visit place if you are in Cappadocia . Try the Turkish pistachio ice cream for about 10 liras . Best ice- cream ever.
62,Valley of your Imagination,"If you are part of the organized tour, then this will be included by default. In that case, indulge your imagination and assign shapes of objects to the formations. If you are touring on your own, feel free to skip it"
