I liked the smoothie bars and juice bars that were easy to reach. Some of the soverneir shops were a bit ‚Äútacky‚Äù but lots of bargains to be had if you shopped around.

104,Lovely!,Lively area to sit down and relax. Different deprhs in the lagoon area caters to kids and adults alike. Lifeguards on duty. Easy access to eats
105,Great lagoon and bbq atea,"THE LAGOON IS A NICE FREE LOCATION FOR LOCALS  AND  THE MANY VISITORSBack in the day, the AIRLIE waterfront was nothing to write home to mum about, with typical QL coastal town mangrove frontage. Then local govt. thought if they clean it up they could keep the many visitors who came to take cruises into the nearby WHITSUNDAY ISLANDS  for more than the night before and after. Worked a charm ‚Äì this precinct is now real nice and these days I would not hesitate in making AIRLIE BEACH my base for a week or more.Accommodation providers responded in offering a big range of places from backpackers to high end and CRUISE SHIP operators have decided to make their WHITSUNDAY base AIRLIE rather than more offshore on the lee side of WHITSUNDAY ISLAND.So what we have here is two irregularly shaped pools ‚Äì the north-east abt 50mx24 ‚Äì the south-west 90x40. The latter has a very shallow end suitable for non swimmers and kiddies ‚Äì there is a small section of beach lining this end, This pool also has a few lap swimmers lanes about 70m long. Both pools are surrounded by sloping lawn areas. There are palms. boab trees and shelter sheds for shade plus spacious grassed areas to spread a towel. The treated saltwater was very clean and refreshing on a warm day. No shortage of rest rooms, showers and lifeguards..Sweet.TI[S ‚Äì for a short excursion take the path on the seaside of the pool a scenic 900m north west around the headland to CORAL SEA MARINA, In the opposite direction it runs a similar distance to the new PORT OF AIRLIE development past rather nice parklands, condos and nearest the lagoon an okay beach. I remember this area as a mangrove swamp in the 90s - it has been nicely cleaned up and the beach has a stinger/croc enclosure which I urge you use ‚Äì the east end still has remnant mangroves and looks a mugger haven.- the lagoon has no food franchise but one of the bordering accommodation places has set up a nice bar/cafe with a good outlook over the complex. More range is available in the main street 100m inland."
106,Great place to chill out,"What a beautiful lagoon. I spent a day relaxing here. The pool is really big, it even have a lap swimming area. It has large areas of grass to lay on and even a small sand area!"
107,Great spot to swim,"The Lagoon is a great spot in Airlie Beach. It's like a public pool in the middle of the city park, with a great seaview and a real sandy beach with all the facilities you can need. Bars and restaurants nearby. This is the right place where you can spend a sunny hour, especially with kids."

The ‚Äúbeach‚Äù area is not very large, but there‚Äôs acres of grass to lie on and covered areas with picnic tables.  It has changing rooms, segregated loos, showers and fresh water.  It‚Äôs litter-free and well kept, clean and it‚Äôs all free."
115,Beautiful place to relax,"Beautiful lagoon for a swim and sunbathe, but make sure you get in early to secure a spot in the shade!"
116,"Clean, nice for the family","The lagoon was about 100m from our hotel so we used it regularly. The water is wonderful, but there is limited shade for hot/sunny days. Great for kids or adults.

146,First class facility,It‚Äôs a nice thought to have a lagoon especially as Airlie itself doesn‚Äôt have a beach but they really need to upgrade it. The stench of chlorine and humanity is overwhelming. It just feels dirty and slimey.It‚Äôs got a children‚Äôs playground as well but that also needs an upgrade.Would not dip my toes in here let alone swim.
147,Amazing,Great free facility. Would be great for families with little kids. Clean bathroom facilities and chilled drinking water for refills.

171,Fun beach town,I have always enjoyed the Airlie Beach lagoon it's always packed the parking can be a hassle but the beautiful Whitsunday views take that little minus away
172,Airlie Beach currently has NO beach!!! It‚Äôs just Airlie!,Great free to use facilities in town centre! Right on the waterfront & surrounded by shops & cafes. Has limited shade trees so bring your sun screen!
173,Family friendly day out,"Great free good sized pool right by the beach! Also has free bbq spots, a kids playground and shower facilities. Very clean and relaxing."
174,Airlie lagoon,I had heard mixed reviews about this free attraction in Airlie but our experience was wonderful.Nice grassed areas surround the lagoon both on the shops and beach side where you can access the pool from.Change area and toilets are close and all areas were clean and tidy.A lifeguard was on duty.The lagoon had both shallow and deep areas however small children would need constant supervision as the shallow areas progressed to the deep water at the middle of the lagoon channel.
175,With the little one ,"The Airlie Beach lagoon is a great place to get organized and clean up if you've got a late bus out of town, or if you have a few hours to kill. Lifeguards patrol the pool and lots of locals hanging out along the lawn that overlooks the ocean."
176,Nice to see sunset ,"Given the area can experience marine stingers in summer, this is a welcome safe splash zone that easily appeals to families"
177,Great for all ages,"A good day, very safe and protected, no lockers available though so probably wouldn‚Äôt bring any valuables"

180,Beautiful spot,"The lagoon area is a great addition to Airlie Beach. There are a couple of swimming pools which range in water depths from .8m to 2m deep which suits everyone from small children to adults. There are 2 full time lifesavers on call. Lovely grassed areas and many trees providing shade. There are also picnic facilities (tables and chairs), gas BBQs and shade sails. Toilet facilities on site. Small sandy beach area beside one of the pools. Great for swimming or lazing in the sun."
181,Lagoon swimming,"We recently visited Airlie beach and of course swam at the notable Airlie Beach Lagoon! It was a very nice way to spend the afternoon. Has great facilities close by - toilets showers and changing rooms etc. So close to the main drag in Airlie. It does have a lot of chlorine (for good reason - hygiene) but because of this I've broken out in hives as I'm kind of allergic! Didn't have any problem with our accommodation resort pool at Discovery parks as they were partly salt. That would be my only gripe - some salt water would be preferred by those of us who have immune system disorders and can't handle that old Chlorine.Otherwise, great clean facilities and very vigilant lifeguard on patrol."
182,Great alternative to a beach,"Clean, well maintained and very friendly and attentive lifeguards. Convenient location to cafes and shopping strip. Just wish it was heated üòÜ"
183,Relax & Cool Down,"The lagoon is located at the back of the Main Street of Airlie Beach, a great spot to spend the day with family. There a 3 pool areas to cater for the kids. Shady spots and picnic tables are available. Grab a picnic bag for a Free day out or walk to the shops to buy food."
184,Who needs a hotel with a pool?,Beautifully landscaped pool area for all ages and water skill levels. There are swim lanes and great access for users.
185,loved it,"The lagoon is a huge swimming pool with appropriate depths and areas for all levels of aquatic ability. In an area plagued by stingers in the season, the lagoon is a safe and delightful swimming spot. Airlie Beach has very little in the way of actual beach so the lagoon is a godsend in hot weather. Very relaxing and refreshing."
186,Good view,Great views relaxing place.       A-one Fishing Charters customers can customizes tour's to sute themselves fishing Whitehaven beach hill inlet
187,Airlie Beach Lagoon,"This is an absolut must in Airlie Beach. Don't miss it. Water is clear and there is much space for place in the green. Nearby you will a nice Cafe and a book shop for travellers, who want to sale or buy books in different languages. Enjoy and come again."
188,Great place for children,Large main lagoon with a couple of smaller ones.... just like a big pool. Easy access stairs to get in..... lanes for the swimmers.....vareing depth. Toilets and change facilities close by. Recommended as an alternative to a small swimming beach next door. Nice gardens surrounding it and shops on other side of it. Patrolled by life guards.
189,Just lovely,"We spent a lot of time at the Airlie Lagoon.  What a terrific place to have a swim and relax.  Lots of shade, crystal clear water.  Immaculately maintained.  Lifeguards on duty.  Great place to spend and afternoon."
190,Nice swim for lappies,"Brief stop in Airlie Beach, and wanted to swim, but a little hard to find a local protected beach.  This was free, easily accessible and a total delight!"
191,Recreation and chill,"Clean and beautiful. A lovely place to swim. We wished we‚Äôd brought the kids along! And no admission charge - bonus!If the weather was warmer and we had more time, we could imagine spending many hours here"
192,An oasis at Airlie Beach,"What a find this water entertainment venue is! It was difficult to believe one could enjoy the refreshing ""lagoon"" with beautiful view without paying an admission price.  The place was clean without the requisite, gross cast off band aids found dotting many public pools. We spent a non-tour day relaxing here."
193,Nice swimming area,"This lagoon has some natural curves and height with landscaped lawns. All the toilets, change rooms, playground and lifeguard facilities are well thought through.  Good range of depths of water. Near to shops and cafes, looks over the ocean too. Water was cool, but it was July after all!"
194,Popular spot ,Great facility on the esplanade in Airlie beach.Lots of areas to sit around and admire the stunning view.Areas to suit swimmers of all abilities.We met a very friendly lifeguard.There  are  lots of outlets nearby where you can pick up snacks or lunch.
195,A dangerous place to swim....three drownings to date...lifeguards are incredibly slack.,"Pools of varying depth, super clean bathrooms and showers and all by the sea and next to the shopping village.  Highly recommend."
196,A place for the teens to enjoy ,Sensational spot for a swim away from ocean nasties that can be encountered. Kick back on the sand or grab a spot on the grass to enjoy some sunshine. BBQ s also in the area to cook up a storm for brekky or lunch whilst enjoying the easy on the eye princesses lazing by the lagoon. Enjoy.
197,Time to relax!,"Amazing that a designer has actually got this lagoon right. Plenty of shallow areas for the kids and up to 2mtrs deep for the older ones.Lifeguard on duty, shaded areas and a no alcohol policy makes this a great place for both kids and mum and dad to enjoy the tropical sun."
198,Chill out,"Walks in the surf or Centennial Walkway, great restaurants and this gorgeous pool.  Who could want more!"
199,Great pool,"Amazing and huge free flowing outdoor pool, the kind you see in first class resorts around the world, and it‚Äôs open to the public for free everyday! Definitely one of the highlights of Airlie Beach."
200,Cool down after the boardwalk,This is an actual pool designed as a lagoon and its just across the road from shops and cafes.  its for all ages as there is different sections for toddles to grown ups for all to enjoy and there are life guards. close by there are toilets and showers. This is a great place to spend the whole day and it doesn't cost you a thing accept if you want to buy your lunch but you can always bring a picnic lunch.
201,Great free public pool,Just what was needed weather was still a bit cool when we were there but still used virtually everyday (4yr old don‚Äôt feel the cold unlike the parents!) Clean well looked after life guards on duty. Areas for all swimming and non swimming ability‚Äôs
202,No stingers in the lagoon,Lovely area for families or anyone. Lifesavers were seen patrolling the area so a safe place for children. Nice grassed areas for sitting but think at peak time it would be hard to find a spot. Water was clear and clean and the depth varied around the different pools. Lagoons close to restaurants and the main street. Plenty of amenities for changing etc close by. Enjoy.
203,"Fabulous Clean Extra Large Pool, Safe, Family Friendly, No Crocs",Recommend the Lagoon to chill out and relax on your holiday. Kids loved it and were wanting to return every day. Water was extremely warm in Summer. If you like to just sit and people watch you will be entertained for hours - from adults learning how to swim and randoms dressing up. Public toilets were very clean and even had soap! Lifeguards were doing a great job in keeping an eye on the kids and making sure everyone was safe!
204,Fun in the sun,"One word is Paradise , good for all ages. Alone or with friends . it‚Äôs a great place to chill in the sun. Get yourself to Airlie Beach Whitsunday Coast someday. You won‚Äôt regret it. Accom for all budgets. Good Bars and Restaurants too. So worth it !"
205,Great public facility,"Great area, open to the public for free. Very pleasant after a walk in hot weather. Difficult to go in the sea due to gelly fishes and other dangerous species, so this facility is convenient."
206,Beautifully articulated Lagoon with all facilities,My little girl absolutely loved this place so good for her to run around in and splash about. Very safe with no stingers. Clean and well lifeguarded.
207,Lagoon dip,"A perfect place for a relaxing morning dip if you're looking to avoid some crowds. The free showers, toilets and cold water fountain make it ideal for anyone passing through."
208,Great Place For Kids,"The lagoon is a credit to the local council! Its free, ideally situated in the centre of town with landscaped pools, shaded areas and easy access to dining options. Good water temperature even in July. Its superbly maintained with clean toilet / change room amenities and life guards on duty. Its a must-do in Airlie Beach!"
209,Wisdom Cafe,"We visited the Airlie Beach Lagoon on our recent trip to the Whitsundays.Wow what a great spot to relax, swim and have heaps of fun with the family. Close to places to eat, the lagoon itself is very clean and safe with lifeguards walking around to make sure people are safe, and the surrounding gardens just top the whole experience off making for a very enjoyable few days.Good on you Airlie Beach for such a great safe place to swim."
210,REFRESHING,The lagoon is a large pool in town. It‚Äôs set in a tropical themed garden and is right beside the sea. The water in Aden was 32 degree and offer little relief from the heat. The life Guards patrol the area and I saw them in there cleaning the edges. No rowdy people just subakers and soakers.
211,Swim swim,"Great free location, good size, close to local shops and cafes. Toilets and well located. Lifeguard on duty."
212,LOts of kids around but still nice!,"The beach, shops, restaurants  and family friendly vibe around the marina make this a nice place to hang out."

214,Lovely place for a dip ,The lagoon is a great area for couples and families. The water park is for the young and old with assistance for getting in and out of the water. Also great change rooms and toilets close by. Bbq areas are the free type and well maintained. Will definitely be back.

217,Must visit spot ,"My two teenage boys loved the lagoon - set on the sea front, the salt water lagoon was perfect for taking a quick dip. Two large pools - one for smaller children"
218,Beautiful Lagoon,"Love, you can just laze around the lagoon, have a swim or do laps!You can sit on the grass, at picnic table or the sand."
219,"Usually don't like lagoons, but was quite impressed with this one",This pool MAKES Airlie beach! We made s point of having a quick dip every day we could! It‚Äôs a fabulous free facility!
220,Great for all ages,"Took a stroll around the area and was very impressed with this park. Everything looks to be new and will maintained. Pools, grills, shade and parking. Also very close to good restaurants."
221,One of the best tourism Attractions on the Coast ,Lovely place for a dip. Would be highly recommended if you had little tikes or your hotel was missing a pool. We enjoyed a quick dip while in Airlie. My only reason it didnt get 5 star is the chlorine was a little strong but i guess that's the nature of having so many people swim in the one place.
222,Busy yet relaxing!,"Nice to walk here, watch the sunset. Sit and chill. Not much to do tho, you can get on a tiny beach, dont go into the water. You know Australia, everything tries to kill you."
223,A bit grim ,"This lagoon is free of charge, has lifeguards on duty, is in the centre of town, on the foreshore. Suitable for all ages."
224,An oasis! ,"Great lagoon. Child friendly,clean and great facilities.  Great position centrally located Only short walk to Whitsunday terraces ."
225,Amazing outdoor pool! ,"Very relaxing , awesome if you have children. Safe , clean and very looked after. Only downfall was a windy day so bit cold."
226,What an amazing place!,This wonderful swimming lagoon in the centre of town is absolutely brilliant. It is huge and very clean. There are plenty of areas to lay down in the shade under palm trees or other trees. There are toilet facilities there too. I can't believe its free of charge too. I loved swimming in the lagoon and would recommend it to anyone visiting Airlie Beach.
227,Great pool,This lagoon is man made but fantastic and available to everyone. When I was there the first time it was shut down as a result of the cyclone that went through but the next time it was open for all to see. Beautiful!
228,Ugh. You can smell the dirt.,Not often do you find a free ocean-front pool complex that caters to young kids right up to adults.  Line markings allow you to swim laps while varying depths allow young kids to play at the edge.  The city has done an amazing job with their waterfront.  Further down you can find free electric grill stations (cleaned daily by city staff) and an awesome play structure on the opposite end of the waterfront.
229,Perfect place for a lazy afternoon,"Our boys 8 & 11, love this place. Water is Chrystal clear, several life guards always attentive and willing to help. Downside, the surface of the pool is quite rough, not an issue for swimmers, for the kids who just want my to play around running/ walking in the pool, it took the skin off their toes, not to point where they were bleeding, but enough to be painful. The next time we went in, we they wore their wet shoes, no issues! Oh, and some additional shade would be nice, especially for very hot days, altogether a great safe place to swim."
230,Very great area to relax and have a swim,It was a bit too cold to take our 8 month old in the water but we still had a great day with a few different sections for all ages to splash or swim. Lots of photo opportunities with some awesome scenery.
231,Great free attraction very popular with tourists,"That lagoon is a must do when visiting Arlie beach in the center of the main city center along the main street where all shopping facilities and restaurants are available. One of the locals told me the reason behind making this Lagoon. There are a lot of different kind of jelly fish etc wander in the oceanic waters if this town. So to make this town user friendly for the tourists they made this beautiful Lagoon facing oceanic, tropical forrest and city views. Everyone from childrens to adults and non swimmers to swimmers can use this Lagoon surrounded by Palm trees for their leisure purposes.Toilets, swimming accessories, lifesaving guards etc all are available to make the most out of this pool."
232,Cool place to hang,So many people gather at the Lagoon. Such a great addition to Airlie since our visit in 1998. Really good place to take kids of all ages. Some nice shady trees if you get in early and ample toilets. Very clean facilities. Great town planning in action here!
233,Great vibes!,It's a beautiful place but toilets were a bit dirty. It would be good if there was a pet friendly area where your dogs could sit on the grass and enjoy the shade too.
234,Very Cool,"Cool clear water and huge lagoons, when seas not ideal for swimming or snorkelling with incoming algae and stingers. Loads of people there and lifeguards on duty."
235,Great food,"Not too busy , nice place to chill and cool off after a busy day . Some floaty hire would be good. Was very warm"
236,Lovely place for a family,Situated just off the Main Street it is great for a young family especially however I‚Äôm sure no one would not be impressed This is a free activity you can have a dip at various depths with sandy beaches and grassed area
237,Clean relaxing spot,"So much in a simple idea. Swim laps in 2000 or paddle in 200 mm, float around or play with the kids ... This huge lagoon provides different swimming experiences in surroundings suitable for sunbathing and whiling away a few hours. Safe in design and with three or four life guards on duty it‚Äôs perfect for families."
238,Resort style relaxing,"Enjoyable experience at the Airlie Beach Lagoon, have been there on numerous occasions and will continue to visit when in the area.Area was clean tidy very well presented, overall great experience again!!Close to all amenties, coffee, food,shops and close car parking."
239,Relaxing,"Life guards are there nearly all day, water is super warm and clean, public toilets and free electric grills are very near"
240,Great spot to relax,"The Lagoon is a large swimming pool complete with lifeguards. It has a shallow section for the little ones, swimming lanes for the fitness addicts and both lawns and a sand beach for the sun lovers‚Ä¶.AND IT'S FREE!"
241,Fabulous lagoon to swim with lifeguards,"Wow, what an amazing facility in the heart of Airlie Beach! Perfect for families, with its well maintained, fresh and clean feel. This is a perfect spot for post sailing chill out and a dusk swim with the kids! We loved it!"
242,Very necessary ...,We have now holidayed in this area a few times now.The Airlie Beach Lagoon is a masterpiece. I am blown away by what the local council has done in this area and it is all free. This lagoon has all the best ammenaties suitable for families or singles. Well done.
243,Only place to swim,Tendered here from our ship. The town center was a twenty minute walk from the marina. Lots of shopping. Lots of restaurants. Go to the markets for interesting handicrafts.
244,Beautiful,"Great place to relax after going out on the reef, or going skydiving or any other activity you might enjoy in Airlie beach. Located close to the main road, you can easily grab a bite or a coffee nearby. Free drinking water, cold shower, changing rooms and toilets available. Beautiful view"
245,Amazing place for the children,"We visited last week and were very pleasantly surprised. This area is lovely and free. Where do you get to go to such a pretty pool complex complete with lifeguards with such lovely surroundings for free? Nowhere in Sydney, that‚Äôs for sure. I would totally recommend a visit here for a relaxed morning or afternoon."
246,A great place to swim,This is a great public pool for kids has a shelter area for the kids public pool. Toilets are close by. There is a parking area near by 3$ for 2 hrs. My kid loved it and the pool is nice and warm.
247,"Huge, something for everyone","I actaully like the Cairns Lagoon area better but this one was nice too. The town is really cute and beachy, and everyone wears like next to no clothes which is cool cause it is hot there anyway. Shorts, bikinis and a light top is all you need!"
248,Perfect Kids Lagoon,Just a great place to kick back and chill on a hot day when you're looking for a down day free entry as well
249,"Fabulous, free, family","Surprisingly deep! Really beautiful and chilled. Wasn‚Äôt particularly busy, bigger than the photos show."
250,Pleasant swim,"After a 12 hour drive it was lovely to be able to cool off in the safe and welcoming environment.  The setting lets on believe you are on the beach, but have the safety of being in a pool with surrounding beach sand."
251,Great public facility,A really beautiful place to relax and swim or soak up some sun. I stopped in at a local store and got an icecream cone and just chilled out!
252,Very nice spot,Just amazing  Clean and tidy Will go there againLots of bbq areaGreat for family gathering or friends hangout...
253,Pretty,Best lagoon been too in best location. ..clean and close up to main hub stunning in every way a great place to relax
254,fantastic,spent a lazy couple hrs here for free. the pool water was uncomfortably warm and not refreshing. I assume the intensity if the sun has warmed up the water.  i liked that is massive with some pool lane markings for swimmers. but water temp way too hot for any serious laps.  very clean and well presented. getting out of the water and lying i. the shade and breeze was cooler.
255,Stunning location,Smash a few laps out in the lagoon or just kick back and soak in the sunshine.A shallow area up the northern end for the little kids and a play area to stop them annoying the piss out of you all dayIncredible views out to Hayman island and Double cone island.What are u waiting for ????
256,wonderful for visitors,"I thought this would be similar to a public pool, but it was quite glamorous and clean. The lagoon was fun to wade through, and we had beautiful views of palm trees and the ocean."
257,Spectacular Lagoon,"I swam at the lagoon several times during my Airlie visit wasn't disappointed. For a free facility it's top notch, nice and clean with a dedicated lap circuit and shaded areas. The water is a bit cold but it's free so just acclimate to the temperature and you'll be right. Beautiful views."
258,Lagoon ,"Great big lagoon pool, clean, lifeguards, toilets, showers, BBQ area, kids pool and play ground area great views of the beach and it‚Äôs free for anyone to use."
259,Perfect spot for some relaxation,"Daily during our 7 day break at Airlie some time during the day we would be at the lagoon with many others but plenty of room. Kids have great area away from adults. Can swim laps in morning before crowds arrive and lines marks on floor of pool.Lay in sun or under the many shade areas or trees. Great place to swim, relax during or at end of a adventure day"
260,Relaxing,"The area has been remodeled nicely. Public restrooms, seating and a sandy beach are lovely for the young and old. Close to restaurants and bars. Beautiful views."
261,Day out,Very happy with this place. It‚Äôs so peaceful and relaxing. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to leave.I didn‚Äôt expect this place to be so amazing.
262,Kick Back And Chill,"Lots of options for swimming for all ages, and life guards during the day There is also a section marked with lanes for lap swimming.  BBQ's with great views and  a playground."
263,Fantastic ,If you visit Airlie Beach be sure to check out this little gem of a cafe. Tucked away of the Main drag is a fabulous little eatery. The food is amazing.  I even came away with free tea bags coz a couldn‚Äôt decide which tea was the best. The owner won!
264,Holiday with the grand children ,"This is one of the biggest man made lagoons that I have seen anywhere. It is a number of swimming pools with winding parts, bridges and places for adults, big and small kids. An ingenious incorporation of a lap pool within the main lagoon - very smart and efficient use of design.This is a must do stop for sun lovers even if you have your own hotel pool or have been out to see...this is a nice place to chill."
265,Great for young families!,"Whether you‚Äôre keen for a swim, or just want to relax, this is a great spot. Clean, tidy and great location, plus toilets & changing rooms. Highly recommended!"
266,It's nice but the water smells weird,When we were in Airlie the whole of the front is behind a fence as they are upgrading the promenade so the Lagoon is a perfect alternative as it has a sandy beach.
267,Excellent swimming area,Excessive chlorine due to tropics weather. Plus they have the radio blarring from speakers all day. Not nice. Better off going to the netted beach at the other end of town.
268,Love this place,"Have been to the one in Cairns and Brisbane and this is just as good, such a fabulous option for people during jellyfish season when ocean swim is too risky"
269,"Well designed, man made lagoon overlooking the ocean and next to shops.","This was our first family holiday with a 5 month old baby. The lagoon was fantastic and it‚Äôs where we spent most days. It‚Äôs big and has a number of paddling pools as well as a great pool for adults. The water is clean and there are beautiful plants everywhere. There are lifeguards during the day, BBQs and plenty of shaded areas. Without the lagoon there wouldn‚Äôt be much to do for young families in AB."
270,Beautiful Lagoon,"Right near the main drag of town, which is filled with souvenir shops and buses bringing people  to and from airport for holidays.  Swimming in the lagoon is free and there's space to spread out a blanket (hopefully in the shade) and enjoy swimming and looking at the sea. can get crowded on summer weekends, even though the swimming lagoon is quite large."
271,Tidy and shady,"Visited on Friday 21st September. We were out for a walk and stopped by here, very busy with families enjoying the safe swimming spot. Came back again at night the lagoon looked magic all lit up."
272,Fantastic ,"Friendly location for family „ÄÅcouple „ÄÅeveryone.It‚Äôs free entry!! Wonderful!! If u don‚Äôt know what can to do , just stay here ,really relax!!"
273,Great for families,Safe family spot. Clean and tidy surroundings. Clean changing roomsWell patrolled by a good number of lifeguards
274,Beautiful ,"Not worth your time. We travelled along the east coast of Australia and there is so many amazing places to see. Avoid Airlie Beach. It is not worth the time. There is no atmosphere at the lagoon, which is the only place to swim.The council is strict on enforcing rules and regulations. Overall very unwelcoming."
275,Great for families,"The lagoon is located at the back of the main street of Airlie Beach. There is a walkway along the shore which leads to 3 combined swimming pools which are free to use. The pools are at different depths and there is even a hand rail to assist people with injuries to use the facility. The sandy pebbles around the pool water edge are abit tough so walk to the end with your thongs on. People sunbake around the pool. There are shops, cafes, restaurants and pubs near by. Lovely area to bbq in too. The Council owned bbq's are clean and seating is available."
276,Great ,"The Airlie beach swimming pools are open to the public and has 2 life guards. There are two pools and a play area, plenty of lawn for picnics with shade. Renovated and updated in 2017 it is a credit to the Airlie beach council. Even though I had a pool at my hotel accomodation I did use this facility on a quiet day. Clean, huge lagoon pools."
277,Lovely spot ,"You may think that since it is free, it must be crowded. No, there are plenty of spaces around. You can choose to swim in the lagoon, or laze around on the grass patch to enjoy the gentle breeze or just sit on the bench and soak in the environment. Bath rooms are available. You can spend half of the day there. Don't forget to bring some snack too."
278,Great Pools & Facilities,"This beautiful place was amazing and so very safe for children. Fully patrolled by life guards, I felt that my grandchildren were well looked after. Just a beautiful place to spend time"
279,Kids loved it!,As Airlie Beach (February 2019) is currently a construction site and is totally fenced off from the public we‚Äôre all forced into the lagoon in the town centre or have to walk to a man made beach on the outskirts of the town. So the lagoon is toe nail to toe nail as unless you have a car or love a hike to the edge of town this is the equivalent to the beach area and everyone is in it. The construction is scheduled to go thru March 2019. So if you like looking at fencing and diggers Airlie Beach is you kind of place.‚ÄôIf you want easy access to a beach check with your hotel or think about staying elsewhere.
280,Great holiday spot.,"Dont be shy, jump on in, its clean and refreshing on a hot tropical day :-) Your close to all the cafes, so grab some food after and enjoy everyhting that Airlee Beach has to offer."
281,YOU MUST GO TO AIRLIE BEACH AND EXPERIENCE THIS PLACE ON A NICE SUNNY DAY,Grab your towel and head to the lagoon....relaxing on green grass .. floating your cards away... Loaggon is clear and clean... and protected areas..
282,Wee bit chilly,"I loved this lagoon. I have come across quite a few throughout my trip in Queensland and they are the best invention and FREE. They have lifeguards (very friendly and helpful). Shoutout to the nice guy cleaning the pool interacting with my toddler. Well maintained. Just keep watch on those kids. Varying depths at all points. Had a great time, just a bit cold for winter haha"
283,Perfect protected swimming lagoon,Such a beautiful place to relax and watch the world go by. If I had more time I would have loved to have gone for a swim in the pool. Very well kept area.
284,Great for kids.,"Fantastic!   My boys didn't want to go anywhere else - just hang out at the lagoon all day of our holiday!   Being the middle of winter it was a little cold, but it was a great spot.    Very enjoyable.   Don't miss it!"
285,Nice clean place to spend an afternoon,"Our morning started out fantastic at the pool. The life guard with the curly hair is fantastic and was up for a great chat. One of the others, needs to take a lesson in customer service, the most terrible mannerisms and attitude. My son who had floaties (for safety) although a very component swimmer was swimming over to his grandfather, my mum and I were watching and with a matter of seconds, he came over gruffly talking when I said that he was fine, we are watching and he was swimming to my dad, he continued to argue the point saying that he wasn‚Äôt, so much so that I he was implying I was being a bad parent. I am all for pool safety, my son has eyes on him 110% all the time. He continued to carry on like a pork chop and go on his radio and tell every single other lifeguard. Mortified by our experience, we left."
286,Cool dip in the lagoon ,we spent a few days here when we were travelling the east coast in a camper van in  2007we really liked it here! now we'd  like to come back with our little family..it's perfect for children.
287,Great ,"We spent a few days at Airlie Beach for a winter break. We've never been to Airlie before and hadn't heard of anyone who has stayed for more than an overnight, but it was LOVELY! The lagoon has been recently redone and is a beautiful area for people of all ages to hang out, read a book, relax or for the kids to enjoy. Swim in any of the poos along the water front area. With shops and restaurants along the whole area, there is no need to go any further. With less than a 30 minute drive from Proserpine airport, this could very well become my winter escape every year!"
288,Avoid the entire town!,Was up in Airlie for a couple of days. Found the lagoon at Airlie to be a great little spot to chill in the morning. The pool is divided up into a number of areas - one of which has lane lines on the bottom (for anyone feeling vaguely exercisey). If your feeling peckish I can highly recommend a take-away bacon and egg roll from the Treehouse cafe just overlooking the lagoon .... delicious. It was often possible to find a quieter nook when the sea breeze picked up as well which was a real bonus.
289,First class facility,"Nice lagoon but the toilets ar'nt so good, toilet paper on the floors, stainless Steel toilets not a good look, hard to wash your hands as you have to keep the tap turned for the water, let the tap go and the water stops."
290,Great spot for a swim,"I couldn‚Äôt believe when I arrive to Airlie beach that the lagoon would be soooo beautiful, clean and FREEEE...So it‚Äôs a man made lagoon, so it‚Äôs actually a pool. Palm trees all around, grass areas, sand areas, some tables, lifeguards and very clean bathrooms. It‚Äôs open from 9am to 9pm."
291,Lovely spot,This pool is unreal. It's that big it never seems too busy. It gets as deep as 2m so little ones should swim with caution. There are plenty of nearby places to get some food too. My boys make us go there instead of our own pool.
292,Beautiful hillside town,"We went here as a first stop and kept walking. Why would you go to a huge, packed out manmade lagoon (read lido) with a load of posers sunbathing around it when there are beautiful beaches nearby and trips to take you to even better ones like whitehaven. Do yourself a favour and miss this. Also to note, the day we visited, tragically two tourists drowned in the pool on a very busy day. It‚Äôs quite deep  over 2 metres in one part. It was admittedly a very rare tragedy but a concerning one nonetheless."
293,Excellent pool ,"The Airlie Beach Lagoon is a free public swimming pool located right in the town of Airlie Beach. Water is delightful, there are restrooms and changing rooms, lifeguards and it's got shaded picnic tables plus shallow areas for small children. We arrived to Airlie Beach too early to check in to our accommodations so we were able to spend a few hours here waiting on a hot day. We were able to change into our suits and take a refreshing swim. Would definitely make use of the lagoon if I lived here."
294,Great place for swimming,If you are wanting to find a place that is worth every pennu.  Then this is thr place to go.  Accommodating and relaxing
295,Brilliant Place,Was not as impressed with this lagoon as I was with the lagoon on the esplanade in Cairns. In general I was very disappointed in Airlie Beach. The main streets were very dirty and grotty.
296,Good little spot for the kids,If I was coming back to Airlie I‚Äôd stay in town and use the lagoon as my pool. Great spot lots of grass huge pool lots of room to swim.
297,Chlorine heaven,"Council facility with lifeguards contracted to a private company to save money. The least attentive lifeguards I have ever seen, more interested in chatting than in watching the lagoon.More drownings than anywhere in the area."
298,Safe and Family Friendly,"We had chosen Airlie Beach as our accommodation location when we visited Whitsunday Islands this year. I had taken a stroll around area in one evening. The Airlie Beach Lagoon is consisted of several beautiful swimming pools and a parkland with Picnic and BBQ facilities. It is a fantastic place to relax and have fun, particularly for children. Beautiful views over Airlie Bay too.  I am uploading one photo with this review."
299,Cruise Stop,"My husband and I came in on a cruise ship. We were blown away at how large, clean, and well kept this place was. The toilets and change rooms were great, and the life guards friendly. And to top it all off, it was free for the public. It was an amazing thing to have, and I commend the local council for having it there"
