It serves as a very important role of providing space for the residents and visitors to this very crowded and growing city. Folks go on walks here, even though I wish the vehicular traffic was blocked. Plenty of shade, large variety of trees and flowers. And recently, I noticed that many beautiful wooden sculptures have been added to the park."
138,City centre Green lungs of IT city,This is very safe and gorgeous park in central Bangalore that is highly recommended for runners that want a place to run safely and cover a large distance in a shaded/clean area.

142,A must place to visit on Sunday morning,"A park in the heart of city near to Vidhana soudha, High court is an ideal tourist place to visit. apx 4 km from railway station & accessible by metro. A place to relax amidst traffic  of the city .  the landscaping yet to develop and the  park should have more themes to attract tourists"
143,First Sunday in Bangalore well spent..üòÉ,"This place is amazing.You got no plans nothing, just go there you can easily spend some good 3 to 4 hours without even looking at the watch. Place has amazing things to offerYou can cycle around, have some exotic fresh juices, fresh cut fruits, many entries and exits are there to the place.The greenery there is something people admire.Also there is a dog park, court, library and lots of things inside the place.Go on a weekend morning you are gonna love it."
144,A leisurely stroll,This place is adjacent to the UB city. It is big tourist attraction in the city. People visit the place for the huge green cover of more than 2 acres spread. you get to see many different variety of plants and very old trees. it has a jogging track and also small open grounds to exercise or spent time with your family and friends.
145,Lush and Fresh,Me and my friends absolutely anjoyed this place. The place hosts many things inside from libraries to a tennis academy etc.Great place.
146,Full of Peace and Inner Harmony.,"go alone or go with your family or friends! large space with dense trees! curiousity generator place for kids, sit on the grass an enjoy the calm mother nature! a good place for photography also. what i like is i have yulu account, you can rent cycle n roam in the park. you will certainly remember your childhood"
147,peacefull nature,Must visit in morning. you'll feel fresh through out the day. Awesome park and most of it is always clean. Lot of greenery around and one can enjoy fresh air in the morning
148,"Greenery is what you can expect! Walk, Jog, take a Stroll!","You will lots of people walking, jogging, exercising, with their pets, dance practice etc etc.... come to Cubbon Park on a Sunday morning and get a good dose of fresh air and oxygen!"
149,Green Lung space,"We went to the park in morning,it was quite and serene.Many people came for a walk with dogs and some people had come for playing guitar.the surrounding itself created a nice and peaceful place."
150,"Lovely park, entry from the High Court Side recommended",The cubbon park was well maintained . It was the oldest park in Bangalore which is near to high court. It helps the public fresh up their mind with fresh air.
151,Beautiful,"It is a big garden in the center of Bangalore city. I visited this garden in the morning. People were busy doing various activities such as yoga, jogging etc. Good place for morning walk."
152,Clam and surrounded by greenary,"Cubbon park is a nice urban park in the middle of the town.There are lots of people on the weekends, but it still feels you are getting some nature.Cubbon park is one of the iconic place of Bangalore City . Cubbon park situated in the nearest of the city right opposite to vidhan souda.The high court of Karnataka State is located at one of the entrance of the cubbon park."
153,Nice Park ,"Cubbon Park is the Hyde park  or Central park of Bengaluru. Located in the heart of city it gas pretty everything to offer for a good picnic spot.  Greenery. Expansive open space for activities like frisbie, badminton, etc. Space for walks. Adjacent to metro station. Pet friendly. Talking food and soft beverage inside the park is allowed.  They also have a central-open- theatre kind of   space where folk musicians come to play (I have been witness to it multiple times, hence assuming it to be a dedicated space for this). It has huge peripheral area for parking but parking can be painful with one ways and narrow roads with cars parked on both sides.  The biggest problem is absence of bathroom in this large space. It can be very difficult for older people and patients who may need washroom at short intervals.  It is close to Aquarium and Bal bhavan which has a train running through it. Hence both places can be clubbed with picnic inside cubbon park.  It closes at 6pm, not sure what time it opens in the morning. But it's definitely before 6am. It's not very clean though, as visitors tend to litter as usual. But they do have staff to monitor. Since it's always busy with people , I think usual offenders tend to be wary of being watched all the time. Best is to reach there by 1:30-2:00pm. Or around lunch time. Then spend 2-3 hrs relaxing and playing around. And leave bt 530pm before everyone else leaves to avoid traffic.  Good option for picnic"
154,Best to visit during weekend when the vehicle traffic inside the park is closed.,Cubbon Park is one of the biggest park I have seen.It is almost in the heart of Bangalore. Very well maintained and lots of open green space for you to have splendid picnic with kids on weekend. I would definitely recommend to all for a visit.
155,Cubbon park is full of trees to see,Nice greenery. Maintenance is laughable. Lot of vibrant crowd. Nice place to hang around. We really need to do more to save this.
156,Dog Lover's paradise!,This is one of the famous garden in Bangalore it is situated beside the high court of Karnataka Vidhan soudha free parking is there. Is very near to metro station we can spend time with the nature with enjoyment. Very best place two lovers to spend time.
157,The charm of Old Bangalore,"Cubbon lark is the biggest public park located bang in the centre if the city. But if you want to escape the hustle bustle of the city while being in the city, this is the place. It‚Äôs a good park for running and have a huge running community. On weekends the traffic is closed the whole day making it vehicle less bliss. It‚Äôs also a great place for pet owners as the park has a dedicated dog park as well as a thriving community of pet owners. It‚Äôs also a good place to unwind and do a family picnic. I would say a must do in Bangalore."
158,A pleasant stroll,Good place for a family outing. Has a Toy train that apparently is most visited attraction. it's a lung space with some good play area for children. weekends are crowded. There are some dance and plays moderated at the amphitheatre. Has an aquarium and is separately ticketed.
159,Great Place for family,"Officially known as Sri Chamrajendra Park, it is spread in an area of around 300 acres right in the middle of the city providing valuable breathing space to the citizens. Originally it was spread in an area of around 100 acres in 1870 and subsequently was expanded to what it is today. You can indulge in all kinds of activity here be it walk, jog, play cycle your way around the garden and take a nap. It is a pleasant experience at this landmark and one should not miss to witness the beautifully maintained flora and fauna of the garden. No wonder, the people visiting this place have rightly named the city as a Garden City. What is more interesting is that it has a drive through road accessible for light motor vehicles.It is located very near to the administrative offices like the Vidhan Soudha and the High Court of Karnataka and also has its own metro stop (Cubbon Park Station on the Purple Line)Do not miss this landmark for any reason."
160,Green Retreat in the middle of the city,More the central city visitors walk thru this green gift to this city better will be their overall health and outputs! Outcomes!
161,Potluck at cubbon Park,During my stay of about 12 days went here for morning walks.   As the traffic is not allowed till 8 AM it is very clean and lovely.   Even with traffic some of the areas are free and green everywhere.
162,Nice Park,Loved the park - weekend saw lots of people enjoying the park with friends family and dogs. Great place to get away from the noise and traffic
163,Not recommendable,Cubbon park located in central bangalore is considered as green lungs for CBD. Its easily reachable by Metro.
164,so so,"The place is good for a morning or evening run/walk/jog. Once a cool place to handout with family and friends, it does not have many takers now."
165,"Thankfully, it still exists",Cubbon Park is at the centre of the city surrounded by various attractions including children's amusement park fish aquarium Vidhan Soudha High Court Vishveshwarya technical museum and so on.

168,Green Park,"Cubbon park has multiple options to spend your day with kids! Bal Bhavan which has joy rides catering to each age group,( even adults) is the best place to take them for the day outing. Food is restricted in that area. So, either leave it in car or have it before. There is govt canteen and other food counters for ice cream and popcorns. Toilets are clean and well maintained. Government aquarium is next to it and can be visited with kids. Other than that cubbon park is huge and you can surely laze around the nature."
169,I  visited couple of times and it's a really beautiful place to hang around in weekends .,It reminds of the fact that how much green was the city was once. Nowadays it's a crowded place with little maintenance in the heart of the city. U can avoid this place. There is a toy train which gives 5 min ride following a trail with lakes and bumboo trees.
170,Greenery at the heart of the city,"Excellent for morning walks, in the heart of the city... vehicles not allowed in the inner parts till 8:00am... good lung space... I go everyday here since over 5 years... toilets are very basic, just about okay... not so very clean though... (indian style toilets) ... parking is not much of a problem here... there is a guy who makes fresh wheat grass juice, but he is not regular here... hope someone else also starts that here, so regular walkers can enjoy a healthy glass of juice in the mornings- everyday ! Overall... love this place for my morning walks and jog... cheers !"

177,A park to fall in love with,"We spent and entire day roaming Cubbon Park and Lal Bagh, both of with are welcome respites from the hectic day-to-day life and traffic in Bangalore.  Of the two, we preferred Lal Bagh, as Cubbon Park is a bit tired and worn in places."
178,Perfect Invitation for Relaxation,"This truly stands for the term ""Garden City"". This large green patch is amazing to walk around or go for a run in the morning or evening. If mosquitoes bother you, it is best that you wear some sort of a bug-repellent such as odomos/goodnight etc"
179,Love the place,Just like any neighborhood park. More for residents for a stroll.  Nothing new for visitors.  It is maintained very well though

181,Peaceful !,"It is a great park to walk around and I love the atmosphere on weekends with people coming to play and picnic and spend time in general. Good place to run around. I believe there is also a cycle rental on the weekends atleast to go around the park. I would recommend a visit. Especially since its right next the vidhana soudha, you can combine seeing that also with going around cubbon park."

185,Outdoor Walking Path Near JW Marriott ,A beautiful park right in the middle of the bustling city! A good place to make a picnic of. The children's park has a toy train ride for all ages and some joy rides aswell. The entry fee is cheap for the park and the ride. The aquarium is not world class but cool for tiny kids ages 3 and up. The park does have creepy crawlies so take ur insect repellent along. Not too many food options so would be good to pack ur own and make a picknic of it. Small kids enjoy the place. They don't need much anyway!
186,Great place,It is a nice park. Weekends there will be a huge crowd of fitness freeks running here and there. Otherwise you can sit and relax in the park which is closer to mejestic. Well maintained.
187,for nature lovers,"Cubbon park is an oasis in the middle of the city. So much greenery! It's a super place to come for a walk/run, see the library, relax on the weekend and even visit the dog park on Sundays. Makes for a great morning and very photo-friendly :)"
188,Ok park,A very decent place for joggers and evening lovers to spend time peacefully and pleaseant ful and well maintained
189,One of the few green parks left in the city,Bangalore used to be the Garden City though now you have to go hunting for them. This one remains right in the center of the city and remains a relief from the chaos of the city. Try to get to the library in the center.
190,An average park,"During my recent family trip to Bangalore, I spent 5 days in the cramped traffic city. But in that we got lot to breathe in the lush green Cubbon Park which was in the middle of the city and just 500 meters away from my hotel. I went there with my kids for morning walk for 2 days.My kids enjoyed a lot .Another 1 afternoon we all went there.My kids enjoyed the rides too.The restaurant over there which is managed by KSTDC serves nice snacks.Overall an lovely place to spend family time"
191,One of the greenest park in the city!,"Good selection of indigenous tress, and a great place to escape the heat and hustle of the city. Well worth a visit"
192,Slowly Cubbon Park is polluted too vehicles passing through and it is becoming like the rest of the conjusted Bengalore,"If you are a morning walker then this place is good for you.on Saturday and Sunday,, this place is almost fully crowded and you will find people of different ages doing different chores.must go with children."
193,Excellent park,Take a walk in this beautiful park. People just enjoying the simple things in life. There are attractions in or near the park such as a planetarium and museums. Well worth a visit away from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore.
194,Nice park,"Cubbon park is the go to park for many-daily joggers, dog owners, activists and small group meet organisers, cyclist enthusiast, reading enthusiast, leisurely strolling people etc etc etc.It is a huge park and maintained very well. Reaching there also is easy as it is connected by the Metro. Also few stalls outside the park sells all kinds of tid-bits (juices, small bites etc) for the health conscious."
195,A Sunday Walk in Cubbon Park,The massiv park of Bengaluru is located neat MG road and can be accessed by metro rail. Lovely area to spend mornings and evenings
196,For India ok but not up to worldwide standards,Great way to spend a few hours or more on a relaxing weekend. Plenty of greenery in this nearly 150 year old park.
197,Peace in the chaos.,"Cubbon park is a small park in the midst of the concrete jungle of Bengaluru. Although the park is located in the heart of the city, surprisingly not many people were here when we passed through it in the afternoon. A nice place to take a break from the hustle and bustle of city traffic nearby."
198,Good place to walk around... ,My husband and I were over the moon at finding this park. It is a calm oasis in the middle of a hectic city.
199,Not that good place,"Huge old trees, lots of shade, people strolling calmly, kids playing badminton...joggers. The park is old and well used. A good place to gather yourself."
200,Paradise,It's a nice place to spend time in bangalore. You can enjoy there in summers even. We visited it with our family and it was really amazing.
201,A beautiful oasis,"When we come to Bengaluru we stay in a busy place. Always traffic, always people, always noise. In the morning we walk to Cubbon Park to walk in the park. There is always something to see or do: tai chi, feed the birds, jogging clubs, mountain biking clubs, sometimes concerts, other people also enjoying the park. Its a green, quiet, lovely scene in the midst of a busy city."
202,An Oasis is crazy Bangalore,The park needs urgent upkeep work.This is a vast green area which needs to be done up and ensure it is preserved.Hope to see it in great shape next visit.
203,Beautiful spot for early morning outing.,There is a direct metro connectivity to this park on the purple line. A nice park to spend the day in cool atmosphere.
204,Great place for morning or evening walk,"Nice place for a morning walk. A big park, with a lot of birds waiting to be fed by interested people. Health enthusiasts can practice yoga, play badminton etc or just simply enjoy the scenery."
205,Very green and beautiful,"The predominantly green area of the park has many motorable roads, and the well-laid-out walking paths running through the park are frequented by early morning walkers and the naturalists who study plants in the tranquil natural environment"
206,This park is endless,"A place to relax, soothe your body and mind and feel the fresh air in the middle of the city yet very close and amongst the nature. Bangalore's very own and close to heart is Cubbon park and for all valid reasons it needs to be. Its nature lovers delight and photographer treat to offer multi genre of photo opportunities. Visit once and you feel like visiting anytime and manytimes no matter where you are in the city."
207,Nice green. ,"Many busy roads cut through the park. It was being refreshed at the time we visited. Workers going about their jobs of planting, cleaning etc. The best part is the State Central Library left over from the British occupation it is full of old world charm (and books)! Garbage in the streets was a big turn off. üôÅ"
208,Vast green park in the heart of Bengaluru,This is certainly one of the nicer city parks I've seen in India. This is not surprising as Bengaluru seems to be relatively green and pleasant compared with other Indian cities. There was a lovely covering of grass and some beautifully coloured trees. Purple jacaranda trees scattered their flowers  on the ground and there were wonderful yellow floral trees that I am unsure of the name. The museum building was a lovely old one and does have some nice exhibits of older sculptures. The building itself was just as interesting. Overall it's certainly worth a visit.
209,Best place in Bangalore for family to take their children,"Cubbon Park is known for it's lush greenery in the center of the city, but it's also very well connected with a metro station adjoining one of the entrances and ample parking available as well. Different sections of the park are suitable for different activities- you can have a picnic by the Victoria statue, play games with family and friends near the rock formations or enjoy swings and the toy train inside the main park premises. On Sundays, you can rent a cycle and take a leisurely journey or join small groups of Bangaloreans reading poetry, doing yoga, learning photography or other fun activities. For the foodies, Cubbon park has tender coconut water, fresh corn, and is walking distance to Koshys or Church Street Social, depending on the kind of breakfast you prefer. It's an ideal place to take a book to read,or to take a quick nap and enjoy the lovely Bangalore weather."
210,Fun filled activities ,This park was right opposite us so we took the opportunity to explore one weekend. The park was reasonably well maintained and the huge trees provided shade for visitors. There were also street vendors selling snacks. We noted a library in the middle of the park but did not go in. Would be nice to hang out and have a picnic there.
211,Weekend Picnic,"Cubbon Park is a decently maintained park in the middle of the city. It is well connected with the metros. You can either visit early in the mornings for a run, or just chill with friends or family here."
212,Peaceful place,Cubbon Park is a nice attraction near to Chinnasamy International Cricket Stadium. Also 10 minutes walk from #CitrusCunningham Hotel. Cubbon Park visit can be your perfect outing with your loved one.  I enjoyed my time at Cubbon Park. Hope you guys will enjoy the same way.
213,Nice greenery,"Cubbon Park is a park which is having its history since English times. The park is very closer to High court and also very close to Vishveshwariya Technology Museum & Government Museum. The park is smaller compared to Lalbagh. But, it is still reasonably big. Highly recommend to spend some time and also visit nearby places like Government Museum and Vishweshwaraiyya Technology Museum."
214,The lungs of the city. Great running track,"One of Bangalore's oldest parks, the Cubbon Park has been eyed by politicians for long. Some unwanted modifications were done before a hue and cry by citizens. Backyard to the Bangalore High Court, a magnificent heritage complex. Lots of walks and greens, opening into the most busy of junctions. The traffic having to cross this beautiful park is a real threat."
215,A joggers Paradise in the heart of Bangalore,Greenery all around and weekends reminds me that we are still humans in today's world. Kids will enjoy a lot here.
216,For morning wakers,"Cubbon park is associated with how olden days Bangalore was. Though there has been unimaginable changes in the city, cubbon park has stayed the same. After going for first time in many years later, i did feel bangalore has not lost its glory. This is a park staying true to its fame.Last important info: Free two wheeler parking available, though not sure about four wheeler. Check this place atleast once."
217,A Relaxing and Calm Space in the Center of Town,I went out with my friends couple of times. Really amazing place to visit to get a fresh air in the natural environment
218,A decent place,"Nice big parkVery nice to Capitol hotelExcellent for morning and evening walksMany locals doing yoga, jogging etc makes it a lively place"
219,Morning Walks,"Cubbon park is one of the biggest parks in Bangalore. it is located in the heart of the city. A visit will really make you forget that you are in Bangalore. Area is covered with lot of large trees and greenery. If you love spending time without spending money, Cubbon park is the best place. Park is little crowded on Weekends and Holidays. It is also a good place to spend time with your family. It reminds us what we miss everyday in a busy city. Save tress and preserve nature. One last thing - Please do not litter in public places."
220,Peaceful in the midst of the city,"The Park  is Bangaluru's ""lungs"" and will  invariably fall within your route on your sightseeing trip to the city. Has several historic attractions ( State Museum, High Court, Legislative Assembly) integral to it. The park is well maintained and has some rich flora.It is definitely worth a stroll as you move sightseeing from attraction to another in ts vicinity."
221,Go on Sundays,"This famous park was laid out in 1864 by Sir Mark Cubbon, the then viceroy of India. Spread over 250 acres, the park is a botanist's delight. It has many species of trees, plants and flowers. It is criss-crossed by many roads that are closed to traffic between 5 am and 8 am. The park is open to public between 6 am and 6 pm, though these timings are not strictly enforced. The park is located in the very heart of the city and had been lying in neglect for many years. Since last year the civic admistration has started refurbishing the park, removing vast colonies of bamboo groves that were consuming copious quantity of ground water; installing street lights along all the walkways, building public toilets and generally improving the park. The park is haven for morning and evening joggers/walkers. Dozens of groups play badminton and football on the roads and open spaces.  Weekends are a riot for families with kids enjoying the lawns with picnics and games and fast-food kiosks / stalls. There is a bandstand that has free musical recitals or classical dance performances on occasion. In the mornings free yoga classes are conducted by Preethy, a young and beautiful Yoga exponent.The park is, alas, abused by  the many users and food sellers who leave it dirty after their picnics and some religious sects who feed stray dogs and birds leaving a trail of food and grain on the roads and pathways.It is a wonderful facility in Bengaluru  that could do with greater consideration and civic sense by its citizens and some bit of regulation and control by the authorities.Admission to the park is free."
222,Green cover,The cubbon park as the nae indicates situated in cubbon of bengaluru.we can reach there by metro railway available in bengaluru.the atmosphere of thos park os very peacefull.
223,Green lung of CBD,This was close to our hotel so we had a walk through it before lunch. The pathways are easy to follow & it was nice to escape the noise of traffic for a short while.
224,"Literally, lung of the city","The park was located next to my hotel during my stay in Bangalore so wondered around the park several times, especially when cutting through the park to the government center.  It is hard to navigate through the park during week days as you will have typical traffic and not very pedestrian friendly when attempting to cross the streets.  However, vehicle traffic is closed on the weekends, so it makes visiting the park much less stressful.  The park is nice to just get away from the city on the weekend and with the many trees offer some shade."
225,Lung of the City,A good peaceful area to spend in the morning and evening. Average Maintenance. Unlike Lalbagh we haven't seen many couple nuisance.
226,Drive thru Park,Looking for a little rest bite from the horns and the traffic - the park is a sanctuary where lovers and friends sit in pools of dappled light. Loved the couple of hours I lost there doing nothing
227,Huge Park,"A must for the nature's lover. Walk slowly and leisurely and enjoy the devine chirping of various birds, the whispering trees. I am sure, any body will fall in love with the Cubbon park's serinity.You must have time to fathom it.A must.We enjoyed talking many private moments of our life.So green. Love it."
228,Great place with amazing natural atmosphere,"Beautiful space, loaded with trash, litter and homeless people.Very disturbing and disappointing to see it so ill maintained"
229,Dusty and dirty,I hope the city fathers take a weekly visit along with the traffic police traffic engineers and personally get first hand information and fix the problems at present only effort is made for the vehicles and so the pedestrians are at the mercy of the vehicles. Lastly try to cross the street in front of Trinity Circle ?? With 5 seconds green light and vehicles coming against you
230,A lush green park,"Some of the botanical specimens are superb, but the general look and feel of the park is untended -somewhat like the rest of the city!!"
231,A pleasant stroll through the park,It was a good morning walk in Cubbon park. The green cover is good. And it's refreshing from the traffic Chaos of the City
232,Visit there regularly for the environment,"In Bangalore for a 3 week work trip, it was so nice to go to Cubbon Park nearly every day for a relaxing walk.  Sunday‚Äôs are the best when the roads are closed to traffic.  Families are everywhere."
233,Worth a visit. Even worth multiple visits.,"If you are in Bangalore,go to cubbon park in the morning hours & enjoy fresh oxygen & a good walk.Top it up with some warm coffee & have a great day.Some images from yesterday morning visit."
234,Fresh and Green,I didn't spend much time in the park but it was nice.  Lots of trees and I saw a green bee eater (bird) that was a new species for me.  Had I a little more time I would have certainly done more looking around one of the reasons Bangalore is known as the Garden City.
235,Business visits,Some couples were taking photos in bridal costumes or dresses in the park on Sunday. Car park and toilet is available.
236,Cubbon Park,"Must visit. Fresh air. Majestic trees. And peace of mind. Cycle, skate, go for a Punic. With anyone. With no one. Just go. And breathe.Pic is in black & White :-p"
237,Vibrant energy in a calm park in the heart of the city,Amazing huge park in the heart of the city. I went there for a run in the morning. It was so calm quiet and serene. A must visit when in Bangalore.
238,Pretty Cool Park in the Middle of the City,"Easy to walk outside of the heat if the day. Take the buggy around the gardens, very reasonable. So many variety of plants, lovely formal gardens"
239,Cool place,Unforgettable day for me with friends nice horse riding cooler environment and many more we can spend hole day without bored nice trees covered the big area along with different types of trees
240,Over 100 year park spread over 100 acres of land filled with greenery,Nice place where to walk around and enjoy some quiet. Good for having pic-nic with friends and families
241,Nice Picnoc spot,"Looking at it as a foreign visitor, it‚Äôs just a park really. We literally spent around 20 minutes walking around the park and taking pictures of the library and garden then we left. I mean it‚Äôs nice to see a well maintained park in Bengaluru but comparing to the parks in other cities this is an ordinary / average kind of park. If you have a relax schedule you can drop by, if not it‚Äôs not a must-go."
242,Lovely,"I am frequently drawn back to this place and there is always something new that's happening. While aquarium, children play area and hillock are popular, the walk around the small pond, the cutting through the bamboo shoots, watching live performances at the band stand, watching the fun at the dogs park are equally popular. The best part is the nature - the bloom colors and the pristine canopies of century old trees! Cubbon park is the best that Bangalore has to offer. It's also witnessed some landmark social events. The popularity also attracts a few social miscreants in the evenings. Be cautious of your belongings and self in secluded areas. Best to venture with friends."
243,huge,It was nice to walk around Cubbon Park but I would not suggest it as one of the main attractions if you have limited time
244,Green - Garden city -  Cubbon Park,"A complete package to fun with family. Go with family, take your home prepared food and enjoy, play any game, fun"
245,The lung space,"Was in B'lore on official trip & stayed back in weekend at my sister's place. Took the Metro to the place & walked down from the station. First look was really impressed with the gigantic open space in heart of the city but then reality struck. The paid part is still good & fun, they have train ride plus some amusement rides. But then starts the sorry part, pathetic upkeep of everything which has no entry fee which personally I felt the management does not care. Felt sorry for a place with so much potential hope the management steps up. Everything has a good ending & so was the case over here as well was really impressed with the Aquarium outside hope to come back & be impressed with the inside as well."
246,A Good Place to Take a stroll,"Cubbon Park is located in the heart of the city. It was conceived uring the British Era in 1870 as a 100 acre garden. It was later expanded to 300 acres. It has a huge coverage of Flora and Fauna as part of the garden. It is well maintained and more often than not, many a activities especially for children are being organised in the park from time to time. It is a must visit place for a different experience with thick coverage of trees."
247,Central Bangalore Park,"This is one of the few green spots at the centre of the town. Sundays are the best for a visit as the roads going thru the park are closed to traffic. The green cover is not very dense and once the sun is up, there are many areas with little shade so mornings are the best time to go. The park has several smaller areas inside and one of the best is the dog park where owners bring their pets and allow them to have some freedom. Even if one doesnt have a pet, it is one of the best places to introduce someone to a pet as only the friendly dogs are without leash and owners are nearby to handle if one is scared."
248,Lung Area -Bangalore,"Must visit incase you are visiting Bangalore for the first time. You must take in how it is developed and maintained. With Paths for people to walk easily and the lush greenary, flowers and the pollution free environment.You can sit, enjoy and relax the nature amidst city."
249,"Crowded place , needs maintenance",The Cubbon Park is in the heart of the city near to the Vidham Soudha and High court. It is not as massive as the Lalbagh because many roads Cris cross inside the park dividing it into many small parks or areas. Nevertheless it is a nice place to spend some time and relax with your friends or family.
250,Peacefull,"The vast expanse of green in the heart of the city is sure to bring a change for the better. The park, a reminiscence of the Raj is a lush green lung space in an otherwise bustling city and is a great place to jog, meditate or simply relax. An interesting fact is that there are public roads crisscrossing the park but is closed during the weekends - which adds to the serenity of the place. The Vidhana soudha, High court, Sir Vishweshwarayya Museum, Venkatappa Art Gallery, UB city office complex and mall etc. are right outside the garden. The garden is also served by a metro line accessible from across the city. There is a play area for children and tracks for jogging and running. Mornings and evenings see good number of people visiting the place."
251,Nice place for weekend recreation,This is just a park you can take a walk around. There were people having a picnic there . Basically a day out relaxing . Nothing too exciting for me.
252,Lovely space in the middle of the city,You need to thank the past rulers for laying out such a brilliant Park. Trust that encroachments are kept at bay.As children our father drove us through the park to clock 1 lakh miles on his Chevrolet!! This was before the metric system kicked in...many moons ago
253,Feel fresh,"One can see vidhana soudha, Karnataka high court from here. There are statues of Mark Cubbon, King Edward, Queen Victoria, King Wodeyar etc .This area is a vast area of Greenery and has flowering plants, trees etc."
254,Jogging in the park,"Green, green and green. One with nature. Never feel like leaving, until it gets crowded. Please keep it clean fellow visitors!"
255,Walk around ,"Lot of space, calm, relaxing. You can walk a lot and relax. feel the silence in the middle of a living city!"
256,Nice green space,We had a very pleasant stroll through Cubbon Park in the company of an extremely knowledgeable guide. The park is well maintained and stocked with many interesting plants.
257,Peaceful place,The park is not all good for anything. I heard a lot about it. But it was waste of time being here. Need a lot of improvement
258,Great place to visit to get away from the crowds,"A brilliant place! Head out on sundays...no cars are allowed . Its a place for kids to be..cycling, exploring..bring your dogs! Have picnicked here a couple of times!"
259,It was a nice place of peace,"This place is good for early morning walks and jogs. If you have small kids, you can take them for a short picnic and let them run free.The park has big lawns and well maintained."
260,Full fun holiday,"I was @ Feb @ 7:45 Am lot of people were connected for there routine excise ,,I shocked when i saw  a old lady she was working out ,,, my blood turned i start doing my part ice hats of grand ma"
261,Good park!,"Park is very big, so if you go after 11am you will have enough space to seat.It was a pleasent experience for me. We gathered in the park at 11:30 am.Stared with some light conversation followed by lunch.After lunch we played few games, sitoliya (lagori) was a great fun.Points to remember:1. Please carry enough water.2. If you have lunch in the park, put remaining things in the dustbin.3. Keep the park clean."
262,Lungs of Bangalore! ,Park is told to be park for couples.We didn't see much there and even there were some re-arrangements going on which made park not much of speciality to visit.Better recommend Lalbagh Botanical Gardens
263,Children would surely enjoy it!,Super peaceful... very nice to go for a walk and escape the hustle and bustle of the busy city. Must visit.
264,Lively and huge park is Bengaluru.,I been here on my childhood. That time was claen aND neat. But now has changed a little.ofcourse after so many years changes happen.piblic should maintain the park.But still it was my memorable visit
265,Garden city,"To escape the smoke and the noise, Cubbon Park offers the escape within the city... on a Sunday morning, couple sit, chat, revise on the benches, and kids walk around the park.Great to walk around, I stayed about and hour there in the various areas."
266,Green Relief,Walking through the park gives you a respite from the craziness that is in Bangalore. You see a bit of the British influence as well as get some nature time.
267,Nice place to chill,"It's worth a one time visit for anyone. And definitely worth multiple visits for fitness enthusiasts, dog lovers, tree lovers, and for anyone who likes a quiet time in this bustling city!"
268,Lung Space.. Green and full bloom of flowers is a wonderful sight,"If you're having a hectic day in Bangalore and want some peace and nature love to yourself, Cubbon Park is the place for you. I like the greenery around here and how this breeze keeps blowing."
269,Garden City indeed,The place comes to life on Sunday mornings when people bring their dogs. An adorable reunion of furry friends gives you a breath of fresh air in this polluted city
270,"Lost charm, but still good for a visit","Located at the centre of the city. However, don't be on wrong side of it, i. e. Museum side. Heavy traffic tams during evening. No Ola or other means available."
271,"A peaceful, quite place in Bangalore",WE drove through Cubbon Park and then walked part of it. You can appreciably feel the temperature drop - this is a wonderful corridor and must be preserved.
272,Good one,"Cubbon Park is situated in the heart of Bengaluru city.It is officially called Sri Chamarajendra park. Park is in vast area and it is one of the main attraction of bengaluru city.

275,Cubbon park,"This park is very beautiful. My colleagues invited me in the park for jogging. At the beginning I had some doubts regarding the quality of the air in general in Bangalore but  on this day was a public holiday, one week before Diwali and there was not so many traffic.Nevertheless the park self is really nice and a big green place in this big city."
276,Nice park in the heart of the city,Stayed in Bangalore for a while now..but went to cubbon park for the first time. It's a place for family visit once. And if you a picnic guy then can go with friends and enjoy some light moment. If you go at morning for a walk it's best.. weather there in the morning is great. There are few other things to check out.. aquarium and few other things. So go there for once and enjoy the nature.
277,not much to see,This is a great place to unwind in the weekend after a busy week. If I lived nearer I'd be taking a walk in this place everyday.I'd request the people who take their dogs there to make some arrangements for cleaning the poop. Don't be selfish!! I hope the place is given proper care and protection from the greedy eyes of people who are after this world's greenery.
278,need maintenance,"There is nothing like going for a run on Sunday in cubbon park, there are so many activities and events. And if you are a reader like me, you can spend your morning in the central library to loose yourself in the mystic experience."
279,Another green getaway in the middle of the City,"Cubbon park is a large public park in the centre of Bengaluru and named for the former British commissioner of Mysore, Sir Mark Cubbon. The park is large with English style landscaping, which is to say more natural and less structured, but sadly no major flower arrangements that I could see.The park is fairly well tended and kept nice and clean making it a nice escape from the busy city."
280,Park,"If you are new to this place, you will find difficult to locate things and won't be able to know what to do and where to go. Navigation is missing, things to do is not shared and highlighted to the visitors. Even toy train facility is also there but no guard was actively working there to show us the way. Better to go with someone who has previously visited this place, so that you can enjoy it to the fullest."
281,Refreshing space ,Here is a park that has something for everybody: snoozers; joggers; drumbeaters; corporate team builders.
282,Quiet green space  in a polluted city,The park is a must place to roam around and is well connected with the local metro service on the violet line.
283,Forget Worries and Relax,"Located in the CBD area, Cubbon Park is a must-visit in the tourist circuit of the city, offering the much needed lung space for nature lovers and photographers. It‚Äôs well connected to all the major arterial roads , has a host of attractions including the Bangalore Aquarium and a kids train rail system."
284,Lungs of Bengaluru,"We went inside Cubbon Park after visiting the technical museum. It was a Sunday. No vehicles are allowed inside the park. We walked down. It was not our first visit. But, our grandson was visiting the place for the first time. We got the battery driven cart and took the ride around the park. The driver was showing us the stadium, the tennis court and all important things as we were moving. We had visited this place in the past too. The roads are widened. The place is well maintained as in the past."
285,"Reminiscence of ""the garden city""","Cubbon Park is located within the heart of Bengaluru city.  It is also known as Sri Chamarajendra Park. The history reveals that the park was renamed as Sri Chamarajendra Park in the year 1927 as a tribute to the ruler, Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar. There are many government buildings, heritage centers and historical monuments within the park. We reached there for morning walk at about 7:15 am but found that the gates were closed and car could not be taken inside.  The gates were opened at 8:00am when we could drive through the car.  The park has well-laid paths for joggers. It is perfect for morning walks and to breath fresh air in the park. Inside the park, one could see the Central Library, State Archeological Museum, Press Club, Aquarium, Tennis Pavilion, YMCA, Century Club, Sheshadri Iyer statue, Chamarajendra Wodeyar memorial etc. Enjoyed the walk as well as car drive inside the huge park."
286,good place to relax,"Bengaluru was once known as "" the Garden City"". Now, it's called the ""Silicon Valley of India"", troubled with traffic jams and an every growing crowd of IT-professionals trying to fit into the city limits. This gem in the middle of Bengaluru reminds you of the green, leisurely past of the city. Cubbon Park is an excellent place for an afternoon stroll. The lush green grass, the chipping birds in the tall trees - this is truly an oasis in a hectic city. On Sundays, there's smaller-scale performing arts, people selling hand made woodworks, bracelets and paintings. Like a flea-market in the woods."
287,Nice garden,"Its located within the heart of the city in the Central Administrative Area. Originally created in 1870, when Major General Richard Sankey was the then British Chief Engineer of Mysore state, it covered an area of 100 acres and subsequent expansion has taken place and the area reported now is about 300 acres .It has a rich recorded history of abundant flora and fauna plantations coupled with numerous impressive and aesthetically located buildings and statues of famous personages, in its precincts"
288,Totally green ,We had a lovely hour or wandering in the shadows of the trees as the sun lowered in the sky. Wonderful watching so many people enjoy the green space and flowers! highly recommended and it's free!
289,Peace,We had time to spent with our family and have a nice walk and we can play some games with our friends.It was a nice place all together
290,Pleasant Garden,"Bangalore has been bombasted with uncontrolled growth and development. It's green spaces have dwindled significantly. Once called the Garden City of India, it has been decimated with unplanned, disorganized commercial and residential growth.Cubbon Park is the last Bastian of greenery in Bangalore. The government has taken care to see that this green space is well maintained and open to the public for walking, jogging, and exercise. The lawns are watered regularly and garbage is kept to a minimum. Many health-conscious citizens use the Park starting at 5:00 am, which is traffic-free till 8:00 am. And every other Saturday, and every Sunday, the gates are closed to traffic. It is one of Bangalore's last landmarks of yesteryears."
291,Nice park,Picnic on the mind head to cubbon park. Don't miss out the toy train ride and the visit to aquarium nearby.Tip: Do bring your toddlers stroller along.
292,Good one,A nice spot to sit and enjoy some rest when out and about in the city. I was there on a Saturday so it seemed like a popular destination for families and school groups.
293,Vast stretch of Greenery in the middle of the city.,"When the noise and traffic seems overwhelming, spend a little time in Cubbon Park, an oasis in the city."
294,Go for green!,"Cubbon Park is a large park across the street from the JW Marriott in Bengaluru. I had previously visited the city in 2017 for the first time and had been too intimidated to cross the street, due to the traffic, to venture into the park. Having arrived in the early morning hours and having a little time before starting work, I was determined to see the park on this visit. As I exited the hotel and stood at the curb mustering my nerve to cross the street, a tuk tuk driver approached wanting to sell me a tour. I declined but he insisted on escorting me across the street and I was glad he did.The park had a long, partially paved, heavily shaded walking path with many beautiful native plants. The park has a bandstand and borders the High Court building. I was an ideal venue to stretch my legs after spending over 20 hours in transit to India. I was much bolder crossing the street on my return to the hotel. I recommend the park for a short outdoor outing."
295,Lungs of the City,"Jogging there and back required dodging people and traffic and attracted a lot of dirt (as I found out when I washed my t-shirt later), but once there it was lovely. Many people bring their dogs there to play, or do yoga on the benches and there is an air of tranquility there."
296,Another lovely place to spend an evening with family!,"If you are in Bengaluru for very few days, then you can omit this to save time. Have seen some better parks and it was not something that I would marvel about."
297,Cool in the shade ,"I only had a little bit of free-time on my trip, but a beautiful Saturday afternoon walk through this park was a great change from the big city that surrounds you."
298,Fantastic place for Running,Went at 6.30am for a morning walk... felt really refreshed... very quiet and clean.... its in mid of the city. Park full of squirrels and parrots
299,City's Jungle Cave but Open.,"If you start early and finish before 8am, you can run on the roads before they allow cars to enter the park."
