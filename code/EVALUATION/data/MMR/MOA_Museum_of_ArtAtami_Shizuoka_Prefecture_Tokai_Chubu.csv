0,Nice Place Nice Food,"A place where you have to visit if you are in Atami. Not for the exhibits, but for the scenic views and the awesome food in the restaurants up there.A short bus ride with easy instructions at the bus stop. Prepare spare change no bigger than 1000yen.Keep quiet on the bus.Silent your phone.And enjoy the view up and down and while you are up there. The view is breathtaking and soothing...Staff everywhere within the museum is very friendly and helpful too.If budget allows, choose one from the restaurants and have a hearty meal there. The soba was excellent and among one of the few things we still remember after the trip...."
1,"Thoroughly enjoyed this museum, nestled on the hillside. Reminded us of the Getty in LA!",Visited there on a hot humid summer day. Surely you can hide from it at that spacious museum. The number of exibitis is not that big but worth seeing.
2,Beautiful architecture ,This museum can boast more about its facilities and setting than its collection. The entry through the escalators is luminous & colorful. View from the museum of the city and Sagami bay is also breathtaking.  Should take a break in the cafe and enjoy.
3,You will be amazed,"The best museum ever! I think everyone would like this museum even if usually you have less interest in them. The architecture is unique, I especially liked the escalator. I recommend you rest in the tea room or restaurant outside of the museum. 爽快な気分になれる美術館。美術館が好きでもそうでない人も絶対に気にいると思います。建物は新しく斬新で、入り口の長いエスカレーターが意外と特にお気に入りです。おわったあとは、屋外の尾形光琳の家を改装したレストランや隣接するお茶屋さんで一服するのがおすすめです。"
4,Needed More Time 🙁,"You go to a museum for the collection, and this one's is great, spanning ancient Buddhist art to contemporary craft art. However, this building itself is a joy to explore and the views are superb. Wonderful museum."
5,Not to be missed!,This is a truly great museum sitting high on the mountainside overlooking Atami.  The exhibition and facilities are second to none.  There are beautiful gardens surrounding the museum and a fantastic view.Well worth a visit if there is an exhibition you are interested in.
6,Beautiful architecture,"We went to Atami to soak and relax.  This museum, both its exhibits and the structure, turned out to be extremely wonderful."
7,Worth going to Atami to see the MOA,"From the grand entryway to the mountaintop views, this museum is a gem. The collection of artifacts from Bactria are amazing, and the Japanese collection is unique. An architectural wonder!"
8,The view was amazing! ,"This is my second visit to the MOA Museum of Art in Atami. I was impressed by this museum on our first visit about 2-1/2 years ago. Renovations were completed in February 2017 and the museum is even more amazing. The non-glare glass was so clear that you couldn't even tell that there was glass separating you from the artwork! The architecture of the building and the landscaping is impeccable. Some reviews mention that the admission is high, but, it is well worth every penny! There are several new cafes and eating places within the museum.  We took a break with Japanese green tea and a sweet while enjoying the Japanese gardens. The current exhibit, ""Fantastical Painter, Iwasa Matabei, The Tale of Yamanaka Tokiwa"" is gorgeous, showcasing the 16-17th century scroll painter's story of a samurai and his mother, Lady Tokiwa. She was attacked and killed by bandits when she was on her way to see her son. Her ghost appeared to him and he sought revenge.  The exhibit ends on April 25, 2017, so, see it if you can!The museum has several National Treasures like the ""Red and White Plum Blossom""  screen and Tea jar with wisteria blossoms. It showcases about 61 Important Cultural Properties. There is a NOH theater within the museum and they have cultural events. If you're planning a trip here, check with the museum for their upcoming and current events. I was happy to see that there were more visitors than when I first visited several years ago.  I would definitely come back! Very easy access from Atami Station by a 7 minute bus ride to the museum. If you need wheelchair access, I believe it is from the 3rd floor."
9,Espetacular views of Atami bay and mesmerizing architecture,"the museum building itself is very nice, high &long escalators leadin to the main show room. I'm thankful that they provide English explanations on some of the main exhibits. Most art pieces are Japanese & Chinese n very few western arts. But the plaza outside offer very good view of the Atami bay during good weather"
10,Beautiful museum.,You can feel the spirit of a true Japanese whether through old pictures. Art objects. Thriving beautifully.
11,beautifully presented works of Japanese art in a great location,"We ended up in Atami as a place to visit that wasn't far from Tokyo before we started our JR Pass and we were very happy to find the MOA. It's a fantastic building with an amazing view over Atami. You arrive at the gallery by travelling up escalators inside the hill. Amazing. And then you are greeted by the incredible view and the beautiful sculpture of the King and Queen by Henry Moore. Even if you aren't really interested in art, it's worth visiting the MOA for the building, the view, and the lovely cafes, garden and shop."
12,"lovely exhibits , lovely view","We went o visit the MOA in Atman, the architecture of the museum is wonderful, spacious, the views of the bay is amazing and in particular the inner garden with the autumn fall leaves color change was very nice. The museum content by itself, I expected ore but worthwhile for the museum architecture. 2,000 JPY for an adult ticket. The museum is a 10 min ride by bus from the Atami station bus rotary, 170 JPY. There ae some restaurants inside the museum for meals and tea breaks."
13,Gourgeous view and excellent collection,"Liked: big museum for japanese standards, incredible ""soviet like"" entrance with escalators, convenient access with frequent buses from the station, good cafeDisliked: nothing"
14,Magnificent Museum,"This museum is nestled on a hillside, in a beautiful forested setting with great views. Wonderful exhibits. Reminded us of the Getty campus in LA. Also, lovely Japanese garden and tea houses. If you want to have a full meal get to the restaurant earlier than the published closing time. They were out of the meals we wanted and although the food was fine, we ended up with a bunch of miscellaneous items the chef had available. Also, there apparently are live kabuki theater performances. If we had known, we would have scheduled our visit for that day. Unfortunately, we missed it and it looked like it would have been awesome in the small intimate theater there."
15,"Splendid building, view, and collection","Here are exhibits that you'll find nowhere else. On display currently are artworks of two outstanding artists, Hiramatsu Reiji and Moriguchi Kunihiko who have been creating the neo-traditional works reflecting the spirit of the times while following in the footsteps of traditional style of Japanese art.Reiji Hiramatsu's paintings on Japanese screens of Claude Monet's pond in Spring and summer are magnificent. Truly an artist without comparison. He captured Monet's essence and intertwined it with his culture. The combination is nothing short of spectacular. Part of a private collection at Museum of Art Atami.The formal kimono with overlapping topological design of fish scale pattern in yuzen dyeing by Kunihiko Moriguchi is superb. He is a Yuzen kimono painting master using traditional yuzen painting techniques to create modern designs including the sophisticated topological design. He was designated as a preserver of Important Intangible Cultural Properties (living national treasure) in 2007. In addition to the exhibitions held in Lausanne, Copenhagen, and Oxford, his works have also been shown at a number of overseas exhibitions and he was awarded a French cultural award, the Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French government."
16,Great setting with an average collection,"I have been visiting MOA for 30 years. Each time I travel to Atami MOA is a stop. Note the museum is closed for renovation until February of 2017. This museum is said to have been founded by a Japanese whose lifetime passion was aesthetics. The legend has it that he once sold his house to acquire a Japanese bowl. Arguably the longest underground escalator in the world takes you up the hillside, built to avoid destruction of the trees. The garden is home to a Moore sculpture and breathtaking view of the city. In the museum you will find paintings by Rembrandt and Monet and magnificent east Asian works, including 3 Japan National Treasures and 61 Cultural Properties. My partner and I have enjoyed a concert performance here and viewed a splendid golden tea ceremony room."
17,A great (not so well known) museum,Museum has the most amazing escalators in the world...you will understand after you ride...and ride...and ride them.  Art exhibits are changing and they have a good permanent collection too.  They have a restaurant inside which has excellent Japanese vegetable curry.  Outside you can walk into a section of old Japanese houses and one of them houses a soba restaurant which is excellent.  There is another house with Japanese sweets and another house where you can have traditional Japanese green tea or macha to drink with a small sweet.  Amazing views.  There is also a natural food store with lots of small items you can buy too.  The gift shop in the museum often has interesting items too.
18,Must visit! Even for non art enthusiasts,"This museum boasts grandiose architecture, especially for a town as small as Atami. There aren't that many exhibits, but a featuring exhibit when I visited was a curated selection of Mt. Fuji artwork - very interesting. Definitely worth taking a gander here, if just for the views offered. Good morning/half day attraction."
19,Beautiful and tranquil art museum ☺️,The architecture of this museum alone makes it worth the visit. The exhibits were well laid out with plenty of breathing room for the objects. Only limited English signage. The soba restaurant on the grounds is wonderful.
20,"Special Exhibit --Fantastical Painter, Iwasa Matabei, ""The Tale of Yamanaka Tokiwa""","The walk was long from the train station, but pleasant. Museum was somewhat sterile for my taste. MOA stands for Mokichi Okada Association a lifestyle of welllness and art."
21,Great Japanese art,"Very impressive postmodern building with many escalators and enough space for exhibits to stand out.  Loved the Henry Moore King and Queen sculptures in the garden, sets the mood for the whole modernist approach, though the traditional is not at all negelcted, as they had a Noh theatre on display.  Pity that the enthusiastic lady guide cold only explain the details in japanese which leaves the foreign visitor at a  loss as there were no pamplets in english.  they did provide a detailed English translation for the illustrated legend in ten chapters, or was it nine? Like the Golden Tea Room too, the sumptuousness capturing the importance of the emperor and lords who served him.  Nice mix of European art, too, as Rembrandt's self-portrait in his youth was displayed along with Monet and other French artists.  The Chinese pottery, mainly from the Ming and Song dynasties also made absorbing viewing.Thought it was very good to have a public bus shuttling visitors from the Atami Station right up to the Museum, makes it so accessible."
22,One the best art museums in Japan,MOA Atami Art Museum is the perfect combination of man made beauty and natural beauty.  It holds three national treasures including ”Red and White Plum Blossoms” by Korin Ogata. Modern structure and nice gardens.  Wonderful view of the Sagami Gulf. One day to visit this heavenly place is not enough.
23,In itself worth the trip to Atami,The circular hall is amazing.It looks like a  kaleidoscope.You need all lot of time to enjoy it.Non tester is so beautiful. That is the place that you can feel Japanese culture.
24,This museum has many national treasures of Japan,"Great medium size museum situated in a park with unique architecture built into the mountainside with fantastic views of Suruga Bay and a Henry Moore sculpture facing the bay. Heading up to the main entrance are four flights of escalators with different colors. Interior of the museum is very spacious with two floors of galleries with 17th & 18th century exhibits of art, calligraphy, ceramics and lacquer boxes. The exhibits are well displayed with English explanations.At the time of our visit, the museum had an exhibition of children’s artwork from 2nd to 5th or 6th grades, which was very impressive and very talented kids.If you arrive in Atami by JR train, turn left when you exist the station and head up the ramp to bus bay #8 for MOA Museum of Art. It’s about a 10 mins bus ride uphill; fare is 170 Japanese yen p/p. You can walk but it is a steep uphill walk."
25,Great Mountainside Museum,"Amazing architecture make this a must regardless of the exhibits. That's not to say the exhibits aren't wonderful also. My wife and I were fortunate enough to visit when Part 1 of the Best of Museum collection was shown (until March 12) including the Red and White Plum Blossom Screen, which is a National Treasure. At the same time we were able to see the amazing lacquer-ware produced by Kazumi Morose (also until March 12), who is a Living National Treasure. The entrance fee to the museum is 1600 yen, 1400 for those over 65. We paid just 1300 yen since there is a 300 yen discount when showing the entrance ticket to Baien (Plum Park). Long, long escalators take you through to the upper level from where your adventure starts. The restaurant provided the best food we had during our stay in Atami and was well worth the 30 minute wait. The museum closes at 16.30, which is a little early. Buses run directly to the museum from the station. There is also a taxi stand by the entrance where you may be lucky enough to find a taxi waiting."
26,Stunning museum with beautiful collection,"You'll feel several degrees cooler as you drive up the winding tree-lined roads above Atami to get to this impressive, spacious museum. We just had about 2 hours to spend here and that was too short. We rushed through the exhibits, which had just enough art to enjoy and yet, if you have children, they wouldn't get bored. In fact, they will LOVE some of the interactive exhibits. We would've spent way more time  to have fun in those galleries. We did have time for a short tea break in their tea house, which was relaxing. The views of the city overlooking Atami were gorgeous! In July it was very green, but, we were told that we had just missed the blue and pink ajisai (hydrangeas) and the azaleas that jolted the senses with color!"
27,An enriching Experience - A Place to be,"This museum stands out as one of the most special and well done museums of Japan. Not only it houses some of the most well known works of art of Japan, but it has a very interesting architecture and and a breathtaking view of the sea and the mountains around it. Worth the trip from Tokyo if you are into art."
28,Enchanting museum on the hilltop,"well organised museum, great exhibits ; with lovely exterior gardens with both indoor and outdoor dining facilities available."
29,Atami Museum of Art,"After reading all the reviews I went with high expectations and it still exceeded my expectations! Loved the layout of the museum too - it's like they're taking you through a journey. You go through all these escalators through somewhat zen-like tunnels (loved the floor with the kaleidoscope ceiling where you can just sit back on comfy chairs and stare).I am not an art enthusiast but I really enjoyed the collection in this museum and the architecture plus the garden outside (at the end of the route). There are quite a few cafes and restaurants too. I tried the cafe overseeing Atami, and the French bread with mentaiko paste was amazing! Inexpensive as well (the restaurants seemed a tad expensive though). Just a 7 minute ride (170 yen) from Atami Station and the admission is 1600 yen for adults (worth every penny!)."
30,"escalators, escalators & more escalators !","Depending on the exhibits, the collections that you can view will differ, so refer to their homepage before visiting.  Great location with a superb view of the bay and ocean.  Beautiful garden with many choices of high quality restaurants.  You can spend a few hours and enjoy the whole atmosphere at this museum.  For more, refer to ""hiddenjapanguide"""
31,Budget 3-4 hours for your visit....,It was located in high ground. I had to drive wounded road. The building was renovated and beautiful. There are many sub-national treasure shown in the museum.
32,A bit of a walk from the train station,"The building complex is quite impressive, it sits in the top of a hill, some 300 meters above sea level while still being very close to the ocean. The artwork inside the museum consists mostly on ancient relics from Japanese past eras. Worth visiting."
33,Great Korin exhibit,"For people unaware of the meaning of ""MOA"", it is the ""Moakichi Okada Association"", not ""museum of art.""  MOA is a Japanese ""new religion"" that believes in natural foods, laying of hands, and mostly making its founder rich.  Some of that money went to an extensive art collection on display at this expansive, expensive museum.  Due to the religious affiliation, I was initially reluctant to attend. But my wife was in Tokyo for a Japanese ikebana conference, and their rimpa style arrangements are originally based on the Korin artwork on display here, so she had to attend, which meant I had to attend.Despite my reluctance, I'm very glad I came.  The Korin exhibit was incredibly beautiful and the setting of museum in the hills over Atami is magnificent. We were there in late February in time for the blooming plum trees.  A few weeks later will be an explosion of cherry blossoms, and that alone will be worth the trip."
34,Unforgettable Art Experience,Modern architecture with many Japanese and Oriental works of art. Much visited by people from all over the world. It belongs to the World Messianic Church and its founder was Mokiti Okada who passed away in February of 1955.
35,"Art, architecture, gardens and views","I was first taken to visit Atami with some friends from Tokyo. We travelled by train to this tiny seaside town during the cherry blossom season, perfect. At first glance the museum is somewhat stark, very impressive, but outwardly rather cold. The entrance has long escalators which take one into the depths of the museum. Much of the artwork on display concentrates on Japanese and some Chinese, including exquisite pottery and beautiful objet's d'art. The serenity of the interiors makes one slow down and absorb the beauty of the unique works of art. As you surface from the depths of the museum the view from this vantage point is startling, quite superb, with far reaching views out over the bay at Atami. As the day was hot we wandered into the tea house in the Japanese garden where we enjoyed the typical green tea and the acquired taste of mochi cakes. I was fortunate visiting  with Japanese friends as they were able to introduce me to artifacts that otherwise I may have missed. I long to return as there is so much more to discover."
36,A serene and tranquil museum,"The building is a magnificent piece of architecture.  While this was indicated in prior reviews, it was much more impressive than I imagined.  Somewhat like the Getty in Los Angeles but with sweeping views of the Pacific. In terms of the art, it depends to some extent on what is being displayed. When we visited, the exhibition was an original edition of Hiroshige's 53 stations of the Tokaido.  If TA had 6 stars, I would give it for this exhibit.  The museum has many masterworks of Japanese Art. You should check the site to see what is on display.  There is also a recreation of the home of Ogata Korin, Read the other reviews below for a good many helpful suggestions, if you chose to visit."
37,Lofty Museum in a Teensy Town,"The hilltop MOA Museum of Art, houses an excellent collection of Japanese and Chinese pottery and paintings, dating back to more than 1000 years and also includes a lot of national treasures & much of the extensive art collection of eccentric multi-millionaire and religious leader Mokichi Okada. There is a serene tea garden set among Japanese maple and bubbling brooks. Almost stealing the show is MOA's grandiose entrance, with escalators leading up 200m past ceilings that glow in changing neon colors. You can also get a spectacular view from here.Atami Tourist Office, on the right as you exit Atami Station, has discount tickets to MOA. You can get buses to MOA from platform 8 outside Atami Station."
38,Touch the  Japanese  spirit.,"This place is beautiful but we miscalculated our travel plans. I would recommend allowing for a 2 hour visit, at least, with the audio tapes. We want to go again and they have many different exhibits throughout the year. 👍"
39,Offer great view of the Atami sea from highland,"This is one place we would have really good memories about. we visited this place with our 2 year old twin daughters and given a chance would recommend every parent visiting Atami / Japan from India to visit this place. Not just for the historical knowledge of Japan but for a day well spend. the inhouse coffee shop is must try thing. The amazing experience of going up hill on the escalators with color changing lights and soothing music sets the context for peaceful journey ahead......as you go uphill you may experience the chill. and the place is as quite as it can be , even the people who are there to guide you would communicate in sign language without breaking the serene silence of the Place. The colors in this place can seriously make your wander if there are any colors left , each floor done so beautifully and moreover distinctly from the other floor. the colored patterns would freeze you and you would want to spend some more time here."
40,"Awesome building, good cultural mix of exhibits",Recently upgraded museum is amazing modern architectural beauty with excellent collection of Japanese art. Very spacious.
41,Large museum with fantastic views of the sea,We did not expect much before we went there. Just had some time left before our train and that was about it until we got off bus. It has a wide open sea view and it is very quiet and peaceful. The museum itself was very modern after a recent renovation. Easy to get there as well. Only 5-7 mins by bus from Atami station and very frequent too. Exhibition was interesting. Some english translation was available but not all. But it was fine to enjoy as I am not an art maniac person to be honest. There is a small bamboo garden next to the museum and it was blowing our mind! So beautiful and felt like a magic when we sat in the garden and enjoyed the wind sound and breeze. Definitely recommendable place and I would go back if I visit Atami again.
42,Cool place to escape the summer heat,"這次伊豆熱海行的其中一個非常期待的景點是位於熱海市桃山町的「MOA美術館」。這座私立美術館由世界救世教教祖岡田茂吉於1982年成立，地勢位於山上，可俯瞰整個相模灣以至漂浮在相模灘上的初島和伊豆大島。從房總半島到三浦半島，伊豆半島180度的廣闊風景一覽無遺，景色極為美麗。MOA美術館的收藏品以日本及東洋藝術為主，有繪畫、雕塑、瓷器、書法、漆器等，範圍廣闊且豐富，更另設能樂堂、茶苑及茶室。午餐就在美術館中的漂亮日式庭園內的蕎麦店解決吧!Ingeniously carved into the slopes of Mount Izu, the MOA Museum of Art takes a bit of effort to get to; yet its remarkable architecture and collection of ancient Japanese and East Asian art easily justify a visit.Within the vast grounds of the Museum is a lush, landscaped Japanese garden. There nestles a serene teahouse in traditional Sukiya style - a stark, yet unintruding, contrast to the surrounding modernity."
