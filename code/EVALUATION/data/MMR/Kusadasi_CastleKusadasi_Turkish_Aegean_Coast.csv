0,Castle walk,Me and my mam when for a look round on. A Sunday it's was OK but once you've been would be going again a nice look out over sea
1,NICE PIECE OF LOCAL HISTORY,We did go to see but was closed for renervation but looked lovely  we did walk round castle  on the outside x
2,Have a nice shot for Instagram :),Great grounds and we'll looked after the history is all there to read and the views around are greatIn side the fort is a whale the skeleton of one that is well worth the walk up to it there are shop at the entrance where you can get a ice cream afterwards take water as it is warm up on the top
3,Lovely place ,"Lovley for a walk out when the sun is shining nice place to visit, also a little place you can stop off for a drink whilst admiring the views."
4,Great views,"been coming to Kusadasi for years, Bird island use to be excellent every evening we went up there with are children we could sit at the cafe in there and watch the sunset and fishermen, ther used to be bunnies that hopped all over and the children could play, there was also a resturant and gift shop near the entrance, this place use to be good we went there this year first time for a few years and was shocked, it still a nice place but couls do with the cafe on there and the other bits aswell it is a lovely place just sit and relax and watch the world go by"
5,Lovely day out,"very busy evening watching the splendid show which is on most nights,good value food was average,drink ok miss the whisky as its fire water."
6,Relaxing,Gorgeous place ! Well worth a look. Wee seen it while paragliding so did not actually go in but it looked beautiful
7,The best place for relax downtown,"Looks good but its just a locked building site, nothing there to see really. Such a shame...................."
8,Tentative World Heritage Site.,this is in town centre they now have some market stalls inside It is a lovely building and i am glad it is being used
9,Worth a Visit,"Took a walk to the castle after lunch. Its worth a look only takes about half an hour to walk around, there's a whale skeleton inside the castle it's self and some caged pigeons, hense the name pigeon island and peacock's that have seen better days."
10,Visit to the castle ,Turkis night is well worth  it here Any time really  is good great food loads of entertainment and fantastic  staff.this place has loads of room spotless clean and great food and service. the atmosphere  is great  would recommend it no bother. once visited you will return.
11,Good Visit Short Walk Out Town,waited ages for food and not what really what ordered so waste of money the only good thing to me personally entainement
12,Nice discover ,Just saw it from the outside as it looked there was not much left off it but just helped to tick the box and learnt a brief history of it.
13,Visit if you're in the neighbourhood,i enjoyed the view specially at nights and got some nice fotos. recommended to get there at sunset. didnt have time to visitinside the castle.
14,A castle on a small island with lovely walk and great views - 4.5,"Seems expensive when you book (can't remember but about £30) but the buffet was excellent, all wine (unlimited) and soft drinks included, the setting is amazing and the show extraordinary. If you don't enjoy this night out I just don't know what to say!"
15,Pigeon Island Kusadasi,"This place has free entry so after a bit of a walk , was nice to see a cafe. Walk round the castle walls and there are some fantastic views and photographic opportunities. Very quiet as end of season ."
16,Worth the walk from Kusadasi,Really lovely place to see very cheap on local buses or cabs its a nice day out and there is boat rides as well so a good time out
17,Worth a visit,"Family of 5 with children aged 13, 11 and 9.  Ok so it's not a day trip but it's worth a visit when mixed into a shopping trip.  Aim to get their before the heat of the day and shop in the shade in the afternoon.It's not a big castle, but pleasant and well kept with great views of the surrounding area.  Being keen to explore I was disappointed to find out that the stairs to the top of the tower was closed off.  Small bits of information on trees and birds as you walk round.  Short enough to stop the kids from getting board.If your a KFC fan then head back through security at the main port. It's similar prices to the UK so expensive for turkeys standards but not an issue if it's what your used to spending.  Oh and there are free clean toilets!!"
18,Castle,Clean and cute place in the middle of centre! Not much to do inside but view is pretty and walking is relaxing
19,Wonderful island experience,this castle was a free thing to do very lovely was suprised at how nice it was there are things inside a lovely walk round but once is enough
20,Castle vist,"Lovely walk some parts are steep, but if your looking for some good pictures you can capture beautiful ones here, but of history and nature all rolled into one. It’s also free entry."
21,Wander round Kuşadası ,"in a lovely location but I have been to far bigger and better for a fraction of the price, I wouldn't waste the time or money on this one I'm afraid"
22,More to see than you think,I been many time. The castle pigeon island when ou sit on the castle wall you will feel fredom loking at views off samos and kusadasi ...You dont miss this if you are in Kusadasi ...
23,Nice place,Not really worth visiting.  OK for the walk down. Seems to be a favourite place for the local courting couples!!
24,Beautiful ,Could not actually go inside as it was closed but a nice view and you can walk about half way around the outside.
25,beautiful..,"This currently not open, you can walk along to it but not go round it. Doesn't look like it is going to be open anytime soon. Looks impressive from what you can see of it."
26,Pigeon island,"Pretty much just a photo opp as you are not allowed in, nice views of the port looking back from this area and when at one of the Kusadasi sideway cafes it is lovely to view the fortress from afar."
27,Nice Castle with Park and Views,Take a walk here and if it's open go in; it's free.  There are also reasonably-priced craft vendors along the walkway out to the fortress and you can pick up an evil eye bracelet for cheaper than you will likely see in the rest of Turkey or Kusadasi.
28,Unusual exhibit inside the castle...,Alright for a wander round. Very steep hill to get in and out of it. If you're not so good on your feet please beware!!Try Togi's Place after. Just walk by the boats and it's on the opposite side of the road. All fresh produce and really friendly staff. :)
29,Great place,"Walked around the Castle, the actual building is nice, but diappointing not open for the public to have a tour inside"
30,Güvercinada,"Looked forward to day in the castle but due to restoration work was closed, so we had to be content with a walk around to outside walls, this as you can imagine took little time"
31,Unusual exhibition,castle was having renovation work and closed but saw the outside and looked lovely will be interesting to see it complete when I go back for second visit. The harbour is a must to see the big ship cruisers were amazing to see even got a picture with some lovely sailors lovely and clean place to visit .
32,Beautiful Castle and Photo Opportunity!,this is a lovely place to visit go and see u will love this area plenty to do in this beautiful town lots if shops and bars to
33,Nice little walk,"Went here last year after it was renovated, it has changed a lot, it has a lovely walk around the base of it, kept really clean. The whale skeleton is brilliant. Loads of information boards around, seated areas, in the sun or the shade, well worth a visit.Plenty of pics to be had."
34,Great free attraction within walking distance from the cruise ship pier.,"ideal for a wedding proposal at the sunset ocs it's so silent, peaceful and there are no people around, just some  lazy fishermen that makes the place even better.very recomended even if still under reconstruction"
35,Beautiful Views ,"We decided to walk to the pigeon island on our fist day. Its a beautiful walk from the promenade. You get there by a man made strip of land. It has beautiful views, Lots of information on boards, you can walk around the castle and admire the views. Plenty of benches. Inside the castle there is an exhibition with a big fish skleleton that is suspended from the ceiling. we absolutely loved it. Its free to get on the island and inside the castle/ fort. On our way back we bought boat tickets for a 1 hr boat tour around the harbour and around the island for £2 each. They offer full day trips for £10 from there."
36,Nice stroll,"Fantastic views especially at sunset. Great to see the history of the resort, steps a little unevern but to be expected due to age. Really well maintained."
37,Güvercinada or the Pigeon Island,It`s like a garden wit many little bird houses.Great view from the island which is the symbol of Kusadasi.
38,Very nice views ,"Beautiful place to walk to and we took a picnic, very relaxing and even though its so near the town, you feel like you are away from the rest of the world. Its so beautiful at night, its all lit up."
39,Really nice spot to have a walk around and it's Free,"Not much to do there...it's a nice walk, a pretty good view and defenetly a must have for photos taken in Kusadasi. Other than that...nothing wow about it."
40,Super and GOT Like,This is a nice place to visit.The walk along the causway with the photos of old kusadasi is a nice touch.Pigeon island was the only one i could still make out.The castle is free to enter and some of the views are nice.
41,Free to visit,Pity they don't realise the possibilities with this run down Castle.Any way it was free to enter so I guess that's a bonus.
42,Great for exploring,"old landmark, not much to see, but it's like to go a bit back in time, the Museum does not have much to offer but it is okej when you consider it's free"
43,Castle,walk along the fortress walls see lovely views and if you don't like height then don't look down lol. take alook around visit the mini markets there or try resturant on path way down there but can be bit pricey though.
44,"Nice grounds, great views, and it's FREE",well worth a wak around as very beautiful..especailly at sunset..and very interesting
45,Very Relaxing,"when its open the castle is gorgeous- the outer wall restoration are a bit garish and true to form in te use of sheeny shiny stones but the ,nside is green, well preserved with great views."
46,Nice castle,"Castle was closed, enjoyed the walk through Kusadasi to get here, wasn't much of a highlight after visiting Sirince, Selcuk, Ephesus etc"
47,"Beautiful place to wander around, nice, relaxing, stress free","It was a good show,Value for money ,but I have been to better.You have to sit near the front or else people keep standing up to take photos and blocking your view"
48,Its free,It is nicer to by by the seeside at sunaset and look at the castle from there. or take the boat to samos and you passby.
49,Nice walk and views,"To start with it’s up hill all the way to the castle, but well worth the trip although not terribly old it still has that feel about it and you get fantastic views of Kuşadası from the ramparts.Strange to see rabbits 🐇 running around as well as a few cats 🐈 .There is nowhere in the castle to get water so make sure you take it with you .It’s a good way to spend an hour and only a shirt distance from the town so you can wander in fur something to eat after ( although there is a small restaurant at the base )"
50,A good walk out,"We visited Pigeon Island and the castle yesterday; lovely walk from Centrum along the seafront to reach the causeway to the castle. The castle itself is kept in pristine condition and the few artefacts located inside were interesting to see.  The location gives it beautiful views of the surrounding hillside and bays, and the cafe at the bottom serves very reasonably priced, freshly prepared food and drinks. We chose to hire sun beds and umbrella for the day at the foot of the castle (25 TL for 2) and enjoyed swimming in the azure blue sea."
51,History and beauty in one place,"nice location but nothing inside, lack of information about the history, it can be a nice place if the gob full it with some information about the historical record. the place is absolutely empty. dont waste your time this kind of building are all around turkey but this castle is the worst in the agean sea"
52,"Nice place to roam around, awesome city view","Since previous visit three years ago, considerable improvements to historical site - notices and signposting excellent, views across bay excellent - pleasant adjoining cafe/restaurant -  site not to be missed"
53,Nice for a stroll,Really great food excellent staff a really great night in castle I would strongly recommend castle restaurant caters for all tastes and all ages and their entertainment is brilliant 
54,Lovely place to see,We went there for the dinner and show and had a good evening.  Food was OK nothing special but fine and the show was good. Lots of traditional Turkish dancing but  for me the belly dancers were my favourite. Enjoyable evening.
55,one more castle,I Loved the view and it’s a nice place to relax aswell. This was the second time I went and it never gets boring.
56,interesting,"Recovering from surgery and this place was within walking distance with plenty of fish  restaurants close by. It's a lovely place and on the other side  there is a cafe and a sea swimming area with sun loungers and so you can really make a day of it. We did a morning stroll around the castle, my son had a dip in the sea ( I was unable) then there are plenty of 1 hour boat trips that are 15 lira yes £1.50 so plenty to do around the castle if you easily bored or the kids are."
57,Kusadasi Castle,pls visit this ancient castle gives you a record of what we had in past in history around the world and we do not know about
58,Turkey ( kusadasi),It has been restored nice walk along the promenade .Information on boards informs of fauna in castle. Nobody pestering you like around the shops
59,An ancient fortification.,Lovely place PLenty to see & lots to do.  Loads of resaurants & shops & stalls. Very enjoyable. The only thing that might annoy are the amount of cats:(
60,Brilliant views,Beatiful Place. It's free so well worth a visit. Castle was closed for restauration when we were there but we walked around the island anyway
61,A free entry to this castle was wonderful and it was open even after sunset,"Nice walk along main promanade to reach it, you will see how much it costs to book a boat trip directly here than through your hotel rep, couple of market traders in or around site - one inside well worth looking at -cheap bracelets/bangles and a good line in moisture cream - really friendly and funny chap."
62,Castle,"that has been converted into more of a park. Not much to see but pleasant enough. Best thing was actually renting a beach lounger on the decking surrounding the castle for a day, great swimming and a pleasant place to be. The local cafe has excellent coffee!"
63,Day out in town ,"From our Hotel Derici witch is located in the center it is only a 10 min walk.The scenary is great, it is located on the see like an island, it is a small island but it is nice, clean with different kind of threes in the middle of the island it is an castle very small free entrance.The Castle is very good maintainted, in the night the place is very good illuminated."
64,Quiet and peaceful gardens,"I have been this city many times but traffic is getting crazy, Recently I got crazy in traffic. it was quite low and city has a big roadway problems, ın thıs case ı feel like ın Indıa myself. Kusadası has great view from top of hılls, I lıke Ladies beach but ıt ıs always crowded. Ladies beach shouldn't be free, maybe beach can be much better..."
65,A nice little castle,"Short walk from the port about 5 minutes, the door was closed so we made a tour around the island, the view from the island was very good. But all around was dirty as usual in Turkey."
66,Must explore more next time.,Unfortunately it was still closed but we strolled around anyway. Well worth a visit. Do go next time you are in town.
67,beautiful castle ,"Beautiful place and lovely view we were a little disappointed that inside the castle is set up more like a gallery with a whale skeleton, rather than making the most of the structure. Also you can only walk round the ground floor. Apart from this it is free to enter and the gardens are lovely. Takes about 30 minutes tops to go around, but isn't suitable for the disabled and prams."
68,amazing,"Lit up at night so a good place to feel the ambiance, the views over the harbour and back to the town are spectacular. In the day, the principality swimming area behind the cafe is worth a visit, 10tl for a bed and a life guard there all day, deep water but crystal clear and good swimming."
69,Stunning place,loved it. really beautiful and tells a nice story. An area that ypouy can see again and again. a visit worth
70,Worth a visit for the views,"It was a long walk from Derici Hotel. Don't walk in afternoon to avoid the sun. Its a nice, well maintained, small attraction. Can see in maximum half hour. More like a botanical garden with information about trees and birds. There is a huge whale skeleton. View of the sea from castle is really nice. Very few birds like pigeons, peacock, owl."
71,Lovely free place to visit,"Visited the island in October 2016, it's very easy to get to, just watch along the the small roadway up to the island and up the stairs and enter a very lovely place. The area is littered various trees of olives and other plants, making it quite restful at times. The castle is a sight to behold indeed! Once you enter the building you are confronted by the skeleton of a sperm whale! In the alcoves and in cabinets are models of may ships, ranging from viking to galleons.It's quite enjoyable, you could probably wander around the island and castle within an hour but it's worth it just for the view and watching the sunset.Worth the walk, in my opinion"
72,Good place for an evening stroll,Castle of Kusadasi looks good from outside but.... its forbidden to go inside until they finish renovation.
73,A must see if in kusadasi ,"A lovely spot to wal to from the town or local hotels.  Tastefully restored quite recently with a lovely garden towander around. Greta views of tent won and coastline, including the port and cruise ships if in to visit.  Definitely worth a visit. Free ad WC adjacent."
74,Loved it!,Lovely afternoon spent here walking around and waiting for sunset. We walked from town centre along the seafront to get there. One can also take a short bus ride. Its free to go in. Stunning sunset
75,Kusadasi Castle / Pigeon Island,"Spotted this island from the cruise ship and decided to take an amble there - walked along this causeway from the main road linking it to the island. Lots of day tours by boats appear to be departing from this causeway judging from the advertisement billboards all along the way.  This was around noon so most boats had already left.  Leaving scattered anglers along the way and I actually saw two of them reeling in their catch - one looked like a healthy size sea bream and the other was a much small one.  On the other side along the causeway were a couple of souvenier stalls selling earrings, hats and wrist bands etc.  Finally reached the Castle only to find out that it has turned into a restaurant which does not open till dinner time!  Such a disappointment.  So I decided to follow the pathway and try walk around the castle on the outside but had to stop halfway and turn around as the pathway had crumbled.  It appeared doable but I was alone and did not want to get into trouble alone scrambling around the rocks.Spotted some people swimming in the beautiful sea - they had clambered down some rocky steps from the pathway and seemed to be enjoy floating around.  But I noted that they were wearing sandals cos I guess you have to clamber up the rocky bits from the sea which may not be kind to your feet....All in all and enjoyable walk in the hot sun so bring your umbrella or cap and put on sunblock!"
76,Beautiful views ,Nice to stroll around. Theres lovely views of the centre from here especially at night. Pretty area.
77,The castle,"On our two visits, in 2011 and 2014, it was closed due to renovations, the outside looks amazing, well preserved and clean, and on the approach you can see a lot of nice boats, and fishermen. I hope, once it's open, the inside is as good as the outside, for now, it's just a nice photo opportunity."
78,Just beautiful,"One of the most noticeable buildings in Kuşadası, worth going having a look if you’re in the area. Will go again next year"
79,Kusadasi Castle-Ephese-Pigeon Island,"Had some extra time in Kusadasi so we wanted to visit the fortress but when we got out there it was locked up. The fortress looked interesting from the shore and the walk out to it was interesting, but not being able to get in was a disappointment."
80,Interesting Place,Very interesting museum.  Well worth a visit.  Very good views.  Glad I was able to see the whale this time.
81,"Amazing views, would highly recommend a visit","Apparently this was once a historically-important tourist attraction with a cafe, entertainments, pretty coloured lighting, nicely-maintained gardens and paths.Well,  it isn't now.Everything is closed (apart from the guy trying to sell you cheap jewellery just inside the entrance). The lights and light fittings are broken, the paths not terribly well-maintained. There is a lot of litter and some graffitti, half a dozen stray dogs and a lot of concrete. Even the chicken wire that is supposed to stop you falling from the outer walls onto the rocks below is rusted away.Difficult to know what went wrong here, the Turks are usually good at exploiting tourist opportunities, this once has been and gone, apparently. Worth 15 minutes of your time, but not much more."
82,Free,Was closed for renovations but the walk around was pleasant! Enjoyed watching fishermen and the boats in the harbor!
83,Amazing spot,"An interesting place to visit when in Kusadasi.   We saw it first when cruise ship was leaving the port, so we decided to visit on our return.   The area is steeped in history."
84,Superb free attraction. beautiful walks and views,"Well that was a waste of a walk in the blazing sun.Walk down to it and it's blocked off , a sign informs it is closed for restoration .  Tip to someone in charge .Put a sign at the road side so your visitors will know not to bother. There's nothing else to view there other than other disappointed people walking back ."
85,Beautiful,Not open and hasn't been for 3 years. You can't go inside or see anything by the front doors. Sad! only boats are there.
86,serene,"Recommend a visit. Short walk from the central areas with no access charges, well kept gardens and building with a great vista and views over the bay.  Cafe on site along with a number of boat trips from the causeway."
87,One of best FREE historical sites ever visited,"I just read a few of the reviews of this place right now and contributors have mentioned that they used to have entertainment and food and what not here. Well i just visited in Oct 2012 and it was nothing like that. It just looks like an unused fort. Since our hotel was barely a 10min walk from the fort we decided to take a walk there, took a few photos there and that's all. If you are not staying in Kusadasi you shouldnt bother. It wasnt mentioned in any of the brochures and didnt seem like a place of importance."
88,Good way to spend an hour,"I herd so much about this place and the food quality,so i took a visit,and it was bitterly disappointing its nothing more the a glorified cafe.Now unless there was a hidden restaurant somewhere in side i didnt see it."
89,Beautiful scenery ,It has reasently been refurbished and more user friendly to tourist it has quite a bit of Kusadasi history but don’t expect to spend a long time there it also have a lovely view from the top
90,Lovely Piece of Architecture!,It is a very nice trip by feet with free entrance it is castle that built on a small island you will enter across a rocky bridge in side the walls there are plants and trees also the weather is cool even in hot sun very amazing views to the sea
91,Tranquil,"It wasn't open to the public, but the views are very nice. It's aso a very good place to hve a walk."
92,Great Views,"Nice place, nothing much to do apart from sightseeing, nice view of the city from the castle. The island is connected to the mainland by a long seawall where the tourist boats moor. Merchants sell seashells and souvenirs there."
93,Castle on Pigeon Island,"We enjoyed the walk and the view... It is very nice part of the town, not too far. So, if you are visiting Kusadasi, take the time to see it."
94,Only attraction of kusadasi,This was a well kept site with lovely views of the area. Surprisingly there was no entry charge. There are quite a lot of steps but we managed ok. A very peaceful place.
95,Pigeon island,"It’s a great place to walk around. It takes about an hr or so and is free. Watching the sunset from the castle is pretty awesome, although I’d recommend taking a taxi back to your hotel."
96,lovely hour spent,For a nice way to spend a couple of hours take a walk out to Birds Island. You can see it from the harbour. Its a nice walkout to it and  a great place for a couple of photographs. Try to find out before if the castle is open as it is worth a visit.
97,A must see,Not a great deal to see here. There are lots of boats so you could bag a trip after your five minutes looking round here. They could do so much more with what they have
98,Day out to Kusudasi Castle,spent a bit of time here recently.lovely walk around.lovely views from the castle walls.not sure if suitable for children as ours seemed a bit bored.
99,Clean and accessible ,Looks great from the water or from the Kasadasi Pier but as you get closer reality sets in.  The outside still attracts wedding parties for photographs at dusk or early evening when the dark hides the litter.But stick to the wider view!
100,"Nice, clean in the meadle of the see",We spent an hour there one morning.can walk around the castle plenty of places to sit in the shade.very good for taking photos looking over kusadasi.there is a nice cafe there where you can buy drinks and snacks.it has clean toilets there we both enjoyed it
101,"Ottoman Castle, Kusadasi",The day was not as should be but the view from the castle is great and you should not miss that.Yup can walk all inside the perimeter of the wall and use your imagination.
102,Nice view,"Only attraction of kusadasikusadasi  is a small town and this castle is only attractin in ""city center"""
103,"Interesting place, nice view","Beautiful place to wander around, nice, relaxing, stress free fabulous views we visited in 2009, however, it was closed and restored since - it is a nice way to spend a  morning or afternoon before lunch or dinner"
104,Lovely Gardens.,"well preserved castle, outstanding gardens and great views, good local history, lotsof steps, a nice place outside to grab a cold drink before coming in or moving on"
105,Good views overlooking Kusadasi,It was lovely to walk around the outside but the castle itself was closed for renovations. It's in a lovely spot.
106,Amazing,Walked past this beautiful castle every day for 2 weeks.... it appears to be closed for renovations at present but is still a stunning landmark in this marvellous resort
107,Picturesque walk around the castle grounds,"The side of the castle smelt like a toilet and looks like people use it to sleep rough hence the smell and the rubbish, shame."
108,Very nice place to visit !,"This is a small castle and garden area in Kusedasi. Very well kept gardens and a pleasant half day spent in the sun, watching locals enjoying themselves fishing, walking, or enjoying a glass of local wine."
109,Good views of Kusadasi ,"This site is slowly deteriorating.  We visited in 2013 and then in Nov 2014 and noticed a huge difference.  At one time you could almost walk right around the castle on the sea walk, with one section of scrambling, but now it is almost impossible unless you are daring.  Before even though it was closed you could still go inside and walk around, but now all doors are blockaded and the sea walk is now very dirty and littered.  Other than a great picture from the shore, the walk to the castle has many sight seeing and fishing boats that are worth while."
110,Kusadasi Castle,Good place to visit. The guide our agency provided was very knowledgeable person.I don't remember  his name but I wld like to recommend  him.he knew his job very very well .he was history himself  as well I would say. My agancy  was faztravels.plz visit pumakule hot spring .
111,Definitely visit when in the neighbourhood!,Food is nice and the environment as well. The owner is very friendly; for some he deserves a better staff (only when he is present they do their best...)
112,Impressive views and also free!,A nice walk with good views of Kusadasi.  The fortess is only open for an hour early in the morning.
113,Romantic in the night,"Ok, the good news was a taxi driver relieved us of extra dinars & provided a private off the beaten path island tour. See if you can do the same. Nice walk from town"
114,Wonderful,"Beach is quiet and cozy for travelers who want peace and want to be away from the excitement right place. The beautiful landscape of the island at the time of sunset to attract every viewer. The beautiful beach at sunrise and sunset views are fantastic island and see the beautiful scenery very relaxing and exciting.In the Ottoman period the island due to its strategic location was used for military purposes. The island is located inside a castle. This island is one of the attractions of Kusadasi, a restaurant, you can also go for a meal."
115,Peaceful and Well Renovated,history looks strong like that. in the midle of the sea. how people living in here. how they build here. amazing. this castle is siland castle
116,Apparently unmissable,"Would be nicer if they opened the castle.  Beautiful vistas, away from the crowds, nice place to stop...and people, pay the person for use of the washrooms!"
117,Love the view from the castle,"I apparently missed the briefing that said this was closed for renovations so after about a 3 hour bus ride I was pretty disappointed to find out it was closed for renovation. What I was able to see was architecturally pretty, though. I went in fall of 2014, I should hope they have ""remodeled"" by now."
118,Take your book and rest under a tree,"ada, name is island. a holly place. kuşadası geting the name from here. the first touristic place in turkey. please especially kuşadası here waiting you"
119,Amazing,"Ten to fifteen minutes walk from the centre of Kusadsi town this castle on Pigeon Island is well worth a visit. It can also be accessed by the number 5 local buses. Inside the castle walls there is information about local flora and fauna. We visited on a windy day but once inside the walls on the leeward side it provided the perfect respite from the chilly breeze. Unfortunately we were 'out of season' so we're not able to get to the top of the oldest part, the fort in the middle, as it was closed. There was a large decked area which appeared to be a place that in season would be used as a cafe area."
120,Kusadasi self-guided walking tour,"Nice views from the castle, very well maintained. It is not very big but definitely worth checking it out if you are in the area."
121,A good Monument to Turkey.,It's pleasant to walk in the evening. Great views from the top. It's free for all no tickets to buy!!Enjoyed our visit.
122,Fascinating renovated site with garden,Just ask any of ther staff about this place and they will ply you with information...and in our case offered to provide us with refreshments free of charge
123,Well worth a visit,"There are some silly reviews on here saying that there is nothing to do at the Castle. Well no, there isn't and it is all the better for it. It is well worth a stroll up to the castle and walk around the gardens, admire the views and sit for a while in the shade. The castle itself is unspectacular and, for some inexplicable reason, houses a whale skeleton which is quite interesting. Once you leave the Castle, walk past the modern building at its base and take a stroll along the boardwalk around the island."
124,Lovely walk,It is one of the most old castles but you can see the only old walls and perfect sea view. Nothing interesting inside and outside just for walking bisaid and spend 10-15 minutes to take a photos
125,"Now open and free to enter, a nice way to spend an hour","Not open. Don't see any work going on. Fortress dominates Kusadasi port and is picturesque, but that's it's only interest"
126,Wonderful vista,"This a really worthwhile place to go. The walk across the causeway and around the castle is not demanding and the sights of the boats and the fishermen, the quit of the olive trees and the castle itself make this a great place to go. A full whale skeleton inside is a bonus!"
127,A lovely way to spend a few hours.,"10mins walk from the centre, nice place to roam around the castle, too many views to enjoy from the ocean, the marina, and the hills of mountain. It give you 360degree view. Awesome, Relaxing. Nice cafe and restaurant to enjoy more the view with yatch docking on the sides of the bridge going to the Castle."
128,We enjoyed the walk and the view...,Very good for a short visit.  Took us about 30 minutes to walk here from our hotel and about 1 hour to walk all around.  Definitely fit it into your schedule as it doesn't take too long and is a nice prelude to a cold beer.
129,Pigeon Island the symbol of Kusadasi,"Free to enter and great views of the coast, the town and the sea. Quite a few steps but very well maintained paths. Short walk from town centre."
130,It's gardens rather than castle,Kusadasi is a touristical city and has many cruises every year i think..It was a great exprience to be there.
131,great views from the castle,"This could be turned into a real tourist attraction ;as it is there's not even an information board (not even in turkish) about when , why or by who it was built . Fort is locked up & the gardens around could be really pleasant if they'd just remove the litter & graffitti . The litter is especially bad when you look down over the fortified walls to the sea."
132,Nice walk,"The views are nice from the fort but the fort itself is in decay and there are no explanations or displays, just the crumbling walls"
133,just walkin,"Well worth a visit it's free to enter & the views are beautiful. Even has a small museum housing a few relics and a whale skeleton. Nice walk along the sea front to reach the castle & pass a number if tour boats one of which was a pirate ship, looked impressive."
134,Excellently restored,"This is free to visit, we were told that sometimes, there are people there that tell you that you need to pay to enter. DO NOT give them anything. The place is lovely very clean and well kept. There us a small avary at the top with a few selected birds and some rabbits. The view is amazing."
135,Symbol of Kusadasi,Nice free activity. On top you have nice views. You can combine this trip with lunch or dinner in the many restaurants. Shopping is a must 😏
136,nice picnic spot,If you are in Kusadasi it's worth it to take a walk and see the fort. But you won't get inside because off restauration that seems to have been going on for years. (No disco or restaurant!)Nice view towards city. Altogether:not much!
137,looked amazing,"Kusadasi Castle is good for an evening walk.. It is clean, quiet and peaceful and has great sunset views. It's not extraordinary, but worth a visit if you're in Kusadasi."
138,"Lovely, but pretty small",This was a very nice place to visit. We enjoyed the quiet atmoshphere and the island is well kept and it feels very genuine. Easy access and when travelling with a child you don't want thing to last too long. This was perfect.
139,Now open.,"Here at Kusadasi Castle i have some interesting to say. I and my girlfriend decide to walking a little outside ( this was our second day in Kusadasi ), In one moment we see it Castle upfront and we where exited. when we walk all around we where something like WOW :)."
140,Beautiful,"I love the castle , is very nice point to visit , and you can find more , the castle is amazing and in the same time very good view . Lovely place"
141,****A little piece of history****,"It is not open often, we have been there twice and it was only opened once. The security guard let us in and the entrance was free, not sure if its always free. You can spend about 45 minutes here and enjoy the amazing views of the city and water."
142,********Local sights*********,We went there in februari 2015. They just started renovations. In july 2016 we gave it another try. Unfortunately still closed. They hope to reopen in August/ September 2016
143,Closed for renovations will open 9/2016,This castle was located on a walking distance from our hotel. The walk to the castle is nice and calming by the sea. One can walk inside the castle premises where  you get a 360 view of Kusadasi and wondeful view of the Aegean sea. There is a skeleton of an endagered whale species called the 'fin whale' that hit the shores of Kusadasi in 1998. If you are in Kusadasi dont miss this attraction
144,not what i imagined,"Our first visit, despite visiting and living in Kusadasi. Walked around the deck area only due to access inside being difficult for us. Lovely vista of Kusadasi from a new perspective. Lots of day cruise ships in dock. Nice cafe area at end of walkway. Can remember the excellent refurbishment from 2012. Lots of people about.And, it's all free. Except the cafe and the boat trips, of course.Well worth a visit.See photos."
145,renovated,We walked down to the fortress from the tourist harbour to find that unfortunately it was closed and you are not able to go inside. It is nice to take a holiday picture but thats about it...
146,local landmarks,"Though it was windy and cold, it has very great view of sunset. It is worth for a romantic slow walk. We saw some people fishing there, maybe it's a good place for both sunset and fishing in summer."
147,The harbour area in Kusadasi is a delight.,"Nice free activity. On top you have nice views. Great plants, well kept, nice peaceful trip, You can combine this trip with lunch or dinner at a restaurant next to it, which is affordable, busy and clean. There are also many trips available from the jetty which leads to the castle, which we also took, that too was good."
148,A closure sign would have been appreciated,I could watch the sun set here every evening and never be fed up.  Well worth having a walk around but then just before the sun sets head back toward the port and sit in the little park on the water front and order your cups of Turkish tea (less than 50c) and just sit and watch the sun go down.
149,Pigeon Island w/ Ottoman Fortress / Museum,such a romantic place. we d recommend you to visit at dawn or at the sunset when all the boats are peaceful and the air all around has a magic taste
150,Nice to watch but didn't go in,In kusadasi town centre way to ladies beach right hand side. Beautiful castle. Can't see in side. But you can trip in garden all around. See the wiev of kusadasi different point. Night time nice too..
151,MAKE SURE IT IS OPEN BEFORE YOU GO,I think one of the most famous place to take a photo in Kusadasi. It was quite busy and there was no social distancing. We felt a bit nervous but  was a nice walk. Have an ice cream and start walking after 5pm :)
152,Landmark,Kusadasi is the place to be with in front of the castle you can enjoy the mountain landscape and the azure blue bay. Ephese from the Roman Empire with Theatre and the Celsus Library still nicely intact snd many more sights. Pigeon Island is in the city of Kusadasi with view of the islands with panomic clors of the  sunset.
153,Still Closed For Renovation.,"I have been to Kusadasi many times and have never visited pigeon island before.  Well I visited today and really enjoyed my visit.  You can easily reach it by taking the dolmu s between the centre of Kusadasi (Centrum ) and Ladies Beach , I think it may be number 5 but check before you board.There are beAutiful trees and plants and really nice views of the sea and Kusadasi.  There are bunnies running around and this is a perfect place for a picnic, take drinks and snacks.  There are lots of sets both in the sun and shade and a  bonus there is no entry fee, it is free.On the cause between the road and the island there are many tour board for different durations and also a taxi rank.Give it a try you will not be disappointed."
154,Nice Views,"Sorry folks... The fortress is closed!! We walked to the Fortress from our Hotel in the center of Kusadasi. Nobody knew in advance that the fortress was closed, and there is no indication on the notice found on the entrance door when it will be open again.But looking on the bright side... It was a nice walk and it gave me a great excuse to sit on the other side of the port to enjoy a nice drink. Really, the view here is great, and by all means worth coming over here. Enjoy watching the locals fish here, listening to the sound of the water while enjoying the scenic view... and then have a nice cool beer / coffee nearby :-)"
155,Not open,"Nice views to the harbor and Kusadasi center.  Needs to be taken better care of, to dirty and neglected.  But still nice place for a walk."
156,Closed for refurb,There's not a lot there but a nice walk. we took a taxi to the Ataturk hill for the views which is above the castle. We were then dropped off at the castle and walked into the main town. Pleasant day out.
157,Good to visit when in area,What a fantastic place to go and visit a real piece of history sat upon the hill side looking out over everything you get a sense of something special as you walk round it and take in it beauty be it from the outside or in.
158,closed,"Steep climb to top, with quite a few steps. Best to go before gets too hot.  Not too busy, peaceful and tranquil. Stop off places to sit."
159,A visit to Pigeon Island while docked in port,"We visited Kusadasi castle this week and it was lovely. There are many steps, so it's not suitable for pushchairs or people with walking difficulties. Lots of beautiful views and many photo opportunities"
160,night out,"We had lunch in a restaurant over looking the castle. It was very nice view, but we didn't go inside. Not sure if it was open or not."
161,Anice place to walk for the views,"We went here whilst having a look around Kusadasi. It's on a place called Pigeon Island. It's very well maintained and provides great views of the Marina and Port. Inside is like a miniature nature reserve with all local plants and trees, plus information on local animals, birds and creatures you can see around this area of Turkey. We were very surprised that it was free to get in too as well. I wouldn't recommend if you find walking or stairs difficult though, as with all ancient buildings, step free access isn't great."
162,Nice castle !,Very clean park in the fortress and the fortress rebuilding is of the good quality. You can see interesting mini museum with ancient ships inside. Breathtaking view from the fortress walls. If you have snacks and water with you you can easily spend couple hours enjoying this beautiful historical quiet place. The entrance is free and the public toilets from the right side in front the entrance costs 1 TL.
163,Not really worth the effort to visit,"If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Kusadasi front and town, wander a short distance out of town, past the port to Pigeon Island and this little oasis of calm and beauty. There are a few boats moored up along the causeway, offering 1 hour or longer trips, a few small trinket stalls and a taxi rank - there was no hassling from any of them.Although the site is historic, there has been a lot of renovation work on the castle, walls and walkways. There are quite a few steps and steepish walkways, but it is SO worth the effort. It's also spotlessly clean and well maintained and planted. The views in all directions are wonderful, whether over to Snake Island, Turkish coastline or out to Samos and the Aegean. Even mid day on a Sunday, it wasn't crowded. Allow yourself 45 -60 minutes to really appreciate the feeling of calm and beauty.The most surprising thing is that there's NO ENTRANCE FEE!There's a small coffee bar/cafe just outside the castle walls - we didn't stop there so can't comment on service or price"
164,Historicall castle,"I have been here during the sun set, it was a very beautiful and romantic place.It is free of charge and remains open until 21 o'clock."
165,Seen from paragliding,if plan to visit kusadasi see this castle. historical site with many entertainment. a little far from the city but there is minibus to there from every part of city
166,The stone fortress from the 15th century,"According to locals you could not access the castle when we visited in January 2015. Make sure you go to the Basilica of St John, just down the road in Selcuk."
167,evening showtime,"Was here in September 2014 and this was closed for renovation. Our Cruise ship stopped her this year and I could see from the ship that they were still working on it, with trucks and diggers operating at the entrance. Hopefully if I am ever in Kusadasi again they will have completed the work."
168,Looks great from the outside. Sadly closed for renovation,"This fortress is a place where you need to go for sure. Of course, if you like fortresses. You can make very nice pictures and see the part of the history. I just have nice experience and I will recommend this one to everyone."
169,Castle with a view.,Enjoyed a very relaxing walk here. Lots of trees and shade in from the sun and plenty of information about the trees growing here AND it's free!
170,excellent night out,"It's worth a walk out to the castle if you have the time and the weather is good, just to see the view back to the land and to get a close up of some of the day boats that go to the islands nearby.  The castle isn't open and you can't see anything."
171,"Grand looking building from exterior, pity that's currently closed for restoration","This is a nice spot a short walk along the coast from the main town of Kusadsai (about 10 minutes stroll) You then walk out along a link road to the island (which used to be separate from the main land. Here there are boats moored up that offer trips around the bay. At the end there is a little cafe that you can stop at to have a cup of tea if you like. The castle itself is up on a hill but the walk up is not too tough at all, and there are little spots to stop along the way and look and information about the island. This is not an all day outing and I would add in a boat trip to fill a morning, and then have lunch in the town on the way back."
172,Nice ..but,"This little ""bird island"" is a paradise for lovers. Very nice for couples and very romantic. Every night we had walked to the  fortress and back.  We made a very nice pictures of fortress, see, harbor and sky in sunset.  If  you are in love, bring a loved one here, make  a wish to be together forever and wish should be realized."
173,Beautiful view,Thank goodness that there was no entrance fee as there is almost nothing to see.The best was the view of the town across the bay. It is still worth the walk though.
174,A SEAL OF BARBAROSSA IN KUSADASI,"There isn't much to see but its a nice castle and the view is beautiful. There is a small building inside, museum, supposedly getting prepared but not open yet."
175,Should be nice,There is a circular walk round this island with great views.  The skeleton of the whale is impressive - think Jonah.  The ice creams on the way out were quite cheap and a great treat at the end of the trip.
176,Wasn't accessible,"Clean beach with long white sandy shore and loads of bars, cafes and shops close to it. Dolmus (mini bus) stops here (terminal/last stop)"
177,Nice,"I went on a day trip to Kusadasi as I was staying nearby and was pleasantly surprised by the castle in Kusadasi, it was well kept and represented the area and it's culture."
178,....closed for renovations,"Having reached kusadasi  in the evening,around 5:30PM, we though we had some time on our hands to move around kusadasi and a get a good feel of this beautiful seaside  town. The sunsets here around 7:00PM. So we walked around the harbour and reached the castle around 6:30PM. We had an unique opportunity to watch the sunset from the castle which was around 7:00PM. It was a wonderful experience to watch the sunset into the ocean from the castle since we had only one night stay at kusadasi and were scheduled to leave for istanbul later next day by flight.So this was only opportunity in our hands to get around kusadasi."
179,looks good,"This is a lovely place to visit, great views from the top. The steps are quite steep so take care. Great to see Pigeon Islands"
180,NICE LONG CLEAN SANDY BEACH,"Easy to get to and a nice walk along the coast.The day trip boats go from this area as well, so you can visit before or after a trip. As it is currently closed you can really only look at it, but it is a nice feature on the landscape."
181,Ruins and garbage,"this castle was like a symbol of kusadasi, unfourtunately we couldnt visited cause it wasnt open to the public yet"
182,"Nice restaurant, good food, friendly owner",Unfortunately the castle is currently close to entrance so we were able only to walk around it and appreciate the beautiful Kusadassi from the sea side.
183,Worthy of a waterside walk,A tranquil place with great views of Kusadasi ... well worth taking time to visit this free attraction with plenty of shady spots to sit and take in the views over the harbour area and south towards Ladies Beach ...
184,Ok,"A walk up to the castle from the main pier and along a stretch of less busy marina is nice, as the road rises to a relatively exclusive area of the city one can have some stunning pictures of the castle and the surrounding crystal blue sea, the foliage and the wild flowers along with the wide open expanse of sea and blue shades give some awesome snaps.you will not be dissapointed by the walkThe castle itself is closed for renovations, but you may walk around it up to a certain point, after which it is for the brave hearts only. It is an imposing period castle and a walk up to it with a few snaps is recommended if you have spare time.Also some of the area was smelly and reeked of urine, likely being used by the less fortunate to sleep rough.lots of local fishermen siting around and glad for a chit chat."
185,Closed For Renovation,"Very nice historical castle worth visiting. We were there for a couple of hours. It is one of the landmarks in Kusadasi, worth checking out!"
186,perfect wiew,This castle is really beautiful. Entrance is free. It located at the harbor and there is a nice garden
187,Closed meantime.,"I had a few hours in Kusadasi by taking the dolls (8TL) from Selcuk. Visited the market, seafront and the castle. Nice seafront views."
188,Very old fortress but not too much interesting,"Lovely day out, had a nice but very hot walk around the castle and took pics of the amazing views, sat and had a drink and an icecream In the little cafe area afterwards. Need to pay for toilets but luckily we had some Lira in change. Would have liked to go on one of the many boat trips from the island but my friend is scared of water so we didnt bother."
189,Nice for 10 minut seeing,"Worth the walk down to Pigeon Island for a quiet walk around the walls. Nothing specifically here, but some nice views of the town and surrounding area."
190,A fine view,Great overview over the harbour / cruise=ships and tourist-boats leaving and coming back to the harbour.
191,Amazing to look at from afar,"This makes a nice quiet diversion from the hustle and bustle of Kusadasi. There is some shade amongst the trees and nice views but the ""fortress"" is no longer open so there's not much to do when you get there."
192,Still closed but looked interesting,"Location is good, not much history available...and nothing much to see... currently under restoration"
193,Closed,"It's hard to give any rating to this attraction as it is closed for the moment. We went to visit it in September 2014 and found a banner at the entrance announcing that the site is closed. No estimated day for reopening...still, we found the walking next to it very relaxing and fun. The site is closed to the harbour - about 10 minutes walk."
194,Disappointing,this can been seen from anywhere along the front. Newly renovated it is a step back in time.The views are amazing too. So good to see it in use again.
195,shame,"Interesting and beautiful place to spend some time walking around castle walls, inside the fort and gardens. Information boards scattered around telling of history and island. Large replica skeleton of whale inside fort and model ships display."
196,Closed for refurb,"This is a great little spot to explore if you have a morning free whilst visiting Kusadasi. The views surrounding the castle are beautiful and you can walk around the whole of the outside of the castle to experience these. Inside the castle there is a long whale skeleton, that was washed up on the shore of Kusadasi. All around the castle there are boards giving information about the castle, the flora and wildlife of Kusadasi. We didn’t visit the cafe that is in the grounds of the castle, as we already had lunch plans, but looked at prices and they seemed very reasonable. You can also hire sun loungers and swim in the sea surrounding the castle, which looked fun. There are a lot of steps to negotiate around the grounds, but if you have time you can take these at your own leisure as there is no limit on how long you can stay there, entry is free."
197,Castle restaurant ,"Kusadasi means ""Bird Island"" which was once the name of this small island just offshore due to it being a migration stop during that time. At some point the island name was changed to Pigeon Island. During the 1200's, the Ottoman Empire set up the defensive position on the island to protect the harbor. Although not very high above sea level, attackers would have to face bombardment from all sides if they got past the castle. There is a paved causeway out to the island so you can take a bus or walk the short distance from shore. You can walk around the castle grounds and visit the Byzantine museum."
198,castle,"We were hoping to visit this majestic castle, but it was closed for renovations. Great photos from afar and at sunset."
199,closed,This was closed when we visited in October.  It looked as if they were doing some remedial work.  There was a notice on the door but not in English. Took the attached photo.
200,Closed,What a lovely walk with s very unusual exhibit at the end. The views are stunning. We went on a lovely warm day in August and had a great walk around. Couldn't believe the skeleton on display inside it was huge. Well worth a visit. Highly recommended.
201,If only it was open... and NO indication on the sign when it will re-open...,"this place look like to be one of the attractions of Kushadasi, but it is closed for renovation and you can see it only outside."
202,Closed until....,"We spent some of our time exploring Kusadasi to visit the fortress only a few hundred yards away from the central port area. The fort is joined to the mainland by a narrow causeway which is used by fishing vessels to moor their boats and land their catches. The fort itself was locked, sadly, as it has significant historical value. It is, nevertheless, well worth the visit and take your camera. You will regret it if you don't."
203,Leisurely Walk to the Castle on Pigeon Island from the Cruise Terminal,The castle was closed for renovations but I was able to reach the island and walk around. In the bridge you will see crafts and also offers to sail in party boats.
204,A must visit,It is one of the most old buildings in this area. It is very nice for photos under the sunset. Inside you couldn't find any interesting things just the walls from old stones and perfect sea waves lincking old fortress walls. 15-20 minutes ars enough to spend there.
205,Right in the heart of Kusadasi.,"This is a lovely place to visit to escape the hustle and bustle of the town. You reach it along the walkway by the taxi stand, just follow the sea front passed the port, with the sea on your right hand side. The walkway is lined by old photos of Pigeon Island showing how it developed during the 1900's. This is also where a lot of the boat excursions start. It is free to go onto the island and visit the castle. There is a short, steep climb up to the castle but the views out to sea and of Kusadasi are excellent. The walkways around the island are lined with lovely trees and shrubs (with descriptions in English). There is an aviary and domestic rabbits live on the island. It is open until 11 pm and is nicely lit at night. Well worth a visit during the day or evening for an hour or so."
206,closed for some reason and opening date unknown,"The castle was planned to be defensive structure of the city in history, now it has turned into a museum which you can make panorama of city from there. Worth to visit!"
207,Still closed,It looks great and they are re-building it but we couldn't get inside until June.  There is a walk around the outside but the path doesn't go all the way.  The walk to the castle is lined with boat trips and stalls.
208,Closed,It is a pleasant walk along the sea-front and then over a causeway to the Kusadasi Fortress which offers a quiet retreat from the hustle of the town.
209,Build by Barbaros Hayrettin Pasha,"worth visiting if you have time, but don't expect something special. visit at night, because it's more romantic"
210,Closed Fortress!,"Walked the jetty out to Pigeon Island with the hope of being able to see the fortress and walk around it. Sadly the gates were all locked up and the path around it is not complete so it was really only possible to get photos from the jetty and take pictures of the surrounding area from the Island. Shame, as it would have been great to explore it."
211,worth visiting,"Beautiful pigeon island is a great place to visit, plenty to walk around with information boards telling you about the history of the place, there's a nice cafe for refreshments or a snack, we used the loungers which wer free, then had a swim which is a must as was fantastic, on the walk down to pigeon island there is 1hr boat tours from 5lira, defo worth it, can't wait to return"
212,wierd city,"I had read on trip advisor that it was closed due to renovation but I was still hoping it would be open. It looked so lovely on the first night we saw it, all lit up and looking so mysterious. Later on in the week we walked around the outside of the castle, the Turkish man selling his wares said it was going to be open tomorrow, typical as that was the day we left. I would love to have looked inside, I suppose I can use that as an excuse to go back to Kusadasi"
213,Lovely.,"Whilst this has been heavily refurbished and lacks a certain historic charm, it is still a lovely place to walk around in the sun or of an evening. the fact it is free is also a bonus. well worth a visit."
214,"Lovely to look at, but currently closed","Recently restored to a high standard, the views were amazing, the information boards about the castle were interesting, a great place to visit for an hour"
215,Ephesus,"Good views from Pigeon Island but disappointed that castle (museum) is no longer open. Admission to the island costs nothing, though."
216,"Nice place, but it's still closed",I simply love the view from the castle and the garden.There is no entrance fee and the castle is opened until 9pm. It is so relaxing to walk around the castle.
217,Lovely!!,"August 2013 we went to a Turkish night at the fortress.  It didn't disappoint.  Excellent entertainment, as well as a buffet style dinner, which was very nice.  We thoroughly enjoyed this night and would return."
218,We were not lucky!,"Walked out to Pigeon Island to view the Fort.  Unfortunately the gates were locked!Instead attempted to walk around the island, but this was curtailed as well as the path has fallen into such disrepair.Interesting to watch the activity of the fishing boats on the quay.All in all the though quite a let down for what has the potential to be a superb attraction."
219,Best Turkish night in town,The castle is free entry and has recently been renovated. The gardens are lovely and it was a surprise to find a whale skeleton in the keep. A good place to take a book and a picnic.
220,Its nice but not oh wow...,Totally reshaped castle which reopened to public in 2013 surrounded by a nice garden with lots of different trees and plants. Worth a visit by day and especially by night (for a romantic walk) whilst staying in Kusadasi !Also starting point of various boats going along the sea coast at cheap prices (at least en of April...outside the peak season).
221,castle and harbour,"No internal access due to closure - no notification until you reach the fortress. Poor access to walk around the fortress, lots of litter."
222,Fortress,We liked walking around the castle and see the Kusadasi port from another angle
223,Fortress & restaurant closed,"We walked from town center to see the island. It was almost 8.30pm and it was still open. The entrance is free. Inside the walls, there is a nuce up hill park with lots of plants and trees. You must have comfortable shoes and not baby strollers. In the top there is a small building where there is a skeleton of a whale. It’s quite interesting. Many plants and trees have explanation in English and Turkish. On the little way to walk to the island there are d photos on the wall. At the entrance of the castle there is a cafeteria and paid toilets."
224,Lovely Castle,"When we visited the entrance was closed.It seems like there is some renovations ongoing inside.Several visitors came and just walked alongside outside the wall on the north side.Several tourist boats on the walkway to the island and lots of taxis at the main road, waiting for tourists."
225,Photo Opp,"A great place to wander to if you’re on holiday in Kusadasi in Turkey. Free entry, a beautiful walk around inside the castle walls and the castle itself is small with model ships through the ages inside, and a long-whale skeleton which is awesome.An enclosure with bunnies and pigeons also there! The view is sensational and it’s a lovely place to go and sit."
226,Get away,"Very beautiful castle , very well kept , amazing views  . The castle is in the sea and surrounded by the sea! free entry, definitely worth a visit!"
227,Closed!!!,"I was only able to get to the outside grounds of the castle as it was closed for renovations. However I am glad to say that at least I made it that far as the castle was always something I wanted to visit. The walk to Bird Island is about 10 minutes from the harbour, and there is a beautiful view of the marina as  you make your way to the castle, including the massive cruise ships that have docked. There are many boats available to take you away on many trips as you make your way to the castle. From all that I was able to see of the Castle I enjoyed it, but I will return one day when it is open."
228,A day filler,The Kusadasi Castle is currently under some major renovation plan by the Turkey Government.  İt has always been one of my favourite places to sit and meditate or just enjoy the sensational views of the Aegean and the Turkish coastline in and around Kusadasi and the nearby Greek Island of Samos....
229,Not even open anymore.,"Great views of the habour and old Kusadasi, The local council have recently renovated the castle walls. Shame they took away the restaurant outside but it looks a lot cleaner with out it. Great to see at night time."
230,Not open to public,Its a lovely place to spend and hour or so walking around in the sunshine and taking in the magnificent views.
231,Looks pretty but unable to explore it,Gorgeous place to visit. free entry it just wowed me. The view around it is just magical. cant wait to revisit again in October.
232,Turkish Night,Just a short walk off the main promenade that runs around the harbour - this is a great spot to watch sunset from or to just walk around and take in the views back to the city and over the harbour. You can also pick up one of the many daily boat trips from here that visit local coves for swimming and snorkling.
233,Fortress of Kusadasi,"The enterance was free, which is always nice, so you dont waste anything unless time when you dont like it. You can find it at the Harbor next to the large cruis ships and close to the Grand bazaar. The garden is very nice to see."
234,It a fortress.......,"Apparently unmissable feature of Kusadasi seafront.  I don't often review without first-hand experience.  But from bay boat tour (superb) it looked well worth a visit just up the harbour from sea tours.  And I can't deny my bay touring passengers pressed me universally to visit it - apparently no charge.  Sadly needed to get back to Amara for super dinner, so gave it a miss.Have exc photo of attraction, hope to hone my skills in uploading!!!!!"
235,Good place for seeing sunset,"Bird island is the symbol and meaning of Kuşadasi, now known as Pigeon Island, this little island is linked to the mainland by causeway. There are interesting photographs of the building of the causeway in the 1960's and the old city set all along its length.The Ottoman fortress, which has recently re-opened, is very well restored and the 13th-century Byzantine castle now contains the skeleton of a Fin Whale (or Long Whale) which had been found washed up on the shore of the nearby Dilek National Park. There are interesting notices to read but most people go for the view from the castle walls back across the bay to the harbour and across to the Greek island of Samos, it is well worth the trip and free to enter."
236,a lot of potential not used.,"Unfortunately, the castle was closed for restoration. Very beautiful panorama Pigeon Island opens from the top of the hill. But unfortunately inside we get failed. We came closer to the walls and a bit walked by, then came back."
237,Rather disappointing,"We could originally see the Castle from our room but decided to go for a walk down to it. To our surprise there was a little portable unit set up outside which was mainly filled with young IT Students handing out flyers. They would take professional photos and a drone would take a short video of you outside the castle for €8. The video and photos are incredible and a great quality for money. Definitely a memory for life now!! Do invest in this you will not be sorry. Its 10mins of your time!The views from this castle is incredible and there is a cool skeleton inside. There seats in the shade the other side of the castle and a cafe/restaurant at the front.It's incredible, do have a wonder if you are close by."
238,nice old castle,"Although this outside of this beautiful building has been restored and forms part of the Kusadasi coastline landscape, the inside is not currently open to the public. It is possible to (carefully) walk round most of the perimeter."
239,Very Antiont,This place was defensive in nature and later on became a place for the future travelers to the middle east to move one too!  Defense was an important part of any city and Kusadasi was no different!
240,Lovely Castle,What beautiful piece of history just sat there for all to see whether you just take it in from a distance or get up close either way ut really is something to behold.
241,Not worth the walk,"It's a real pleasure to visit this place - nice view, old stones, interesting history. Be ready to go by foot the way to the top, with stroller and a baby is a real challenge. But even this didn't change our opinion. In the castle your can find some information about the history and nature of this place. Old photos on the entrance give you an overview- how it was many years ago. Recommend to visit, when you are in Kushadasi."
242,better from the shore,accessed from the quay sıde by a man made causway one can explore the ruıns and then enjoy a tradıtıonal Turkce's meal ın beautıful surroundıngs
243,Castle - Pidgeon Island,"Going to the fortress allowed us to get some good views of the sea and part of the town of Kusadasi. The 16th century fort was likely a magnificent structure in its day, but the walls are crumbling and there is no entry to the structure. While we were glad for the walk, you need to be careful to avoid tripping on roots of trees."
244,Beautiful,"It's really nice to visit the castle while visiting Kusadasi. It's a nice walk there, entrance is free and from the castle you'll have an amazing view. Nice gardens all around, lots of information about the castle, flora and fauna in Turkish as well as in English. Inside there is even the renovated skeleton of a whale that once washed ashore closeby. Lots of benches to sit down, have lunch and enjoy the view."
245,worst to see,"A beautiful site to walk to and experience. Rebuilt from the foundations and keeping with the traditional stone . breathtaking views from all around the castle plenty to see.Inside there's a giant whale skeleton and the story of how it got there, small models of ships in glass cases.Worth a visit and it's free."
246,Impossibly Photogenic,"On our trip to Turkey we spent a day in Kuşadası. We avoided too much of the markets and instead enjoyed exploring some if the local areas the Caravan, the castle and museum the back streets of the old town around the pastel painted houses. Very enjoyable."
247,Not open,A great place to get away from all the hustle and bustle of the markets. Wonderful views and a pleasant stroll.
248,views are lovely from here,"I love the views from here ,they are fabulous . At the moment the castle is getting work done to it so be careful when you go"
249,Pidgeon Island,Kusadasi castle entry is free and it is definitely worth a visit. There a restaurant at very reasonable price. Most amazing is the views lout of this world we loved it. We saw a whale skeleton and information on old boats etc. Cool air from castle are breathtaking.My advice please visit you will enjoy it.
250,Makes for a nice walk,"The Pigeon Island is connected with a promenade on the land by a kind of bridge. There are ruins of the castle on the island, as well as the nice clean park, a few restaurants and bars,  privat beaches for bathing (entrance fee) and a public beach also."
251,wonderful,"A Great Historical Landmark With A Great View From The Castle , Its In The Center Of Kusadasi And So Close To The Lovely Shops And Bazars And Restaurants .A "" Must "" Destination From Tourists ."
252,so romantic,Guvercinada is the landmark of Kusadasi. It turns lovely at sunset and young people gather around in the cafes and bars.
253,Not much,"Wandered out to the castle and spent a chilled hour or so just strolling around and looking out to sea, not a lot here but the gardens are well preserved and there is lots of information on the local area. Shame the castle wasn't actually open though!Something to do for a nice walk."
254,Not yet open,"Enjoyed our visit, amazing views from inside the castle, and nice signage explaining various factors. I booked a taxi to Serince and Ephesus 200TL (£54) from Kale Taxi on the path to the castle, a good service with a nice driver (Hasan)."
255,Closed to the public,"The harbour area in Kusadasi is a delight.  The castle itself seems to have somewhat erratic operating hours, but really my favorite trip was a walk over from our cruise ship in the early morning hours, just as the sun was coming up."
256,I was live in Kusadasi,Pigeon Castle is worth a visit for the views of Kusadasi and the pictures of fantastic sunsets. That said as a castle it is not worth a visit.
257,pıgeon ısland,"Unfortunately, the fortress is in restoration period, so we couldn't enter. The view from outside is great, also it is very well preserved."
258,Nice green area on the Pigeon Island,"Very dirty, litter every where, signs of human feces and used condoms in corners. The cafe looks like it has been closed for some time. However the views across the bay are stunning."
259,AMAZING,The castle is about 10 minutes walk from Kusadasi town centre and port.  It was unfortunately closed due to restoration work when we visited but there are some great views to be had from outside the castle which is on an 'island' and accessed via a stone pier.  It is in a romantic setting as witnessed by a few local young couples enjoying its environs.
260,amazing,We walked all the way around the bay to get to this castle only to find the entrance boarded up. There was no sign on approach to warn and we felt very cross given the heat of the day and long walk it took to get there. We do think the closure should be posted somewhere. Looked interesting but who knows......
261,The perfect place to sit and watch the sun set over the Aegean...,"Kusadasi castle was okay, but there wasn't a lot there. There is no entry fee. There are a lot of information posts about the different animals and plants, and there was a small aviary. I think it was too small to house the number of birds in there - the cage should be bigger because there is enough land to do so. There was a big whale skeleton there which was interesting to look at. As you walk around Kusadasi castle, the views are nice. You can overlook the sea and the town. Overall there isn't much there but it is good to say you have been."
262,history,"There isn't much to see inside, but if you want some peace and quiet, come to this place!Moreover, you can take nice photos of the sea and harbor or just relax under the olive trees."
263,Not much to see,"We took a walk down the seafront to this castle, which is on a small island at the end of a pier.It's free entry and there are great views of the harbour, surrounding coast and countryside.You can go inside, but there isn't much to see and you couldn't climb to the higher levels."
264,"Great views over the city, nice garden","The castle is presently closed for renovation. Even when it was open, there was not much to see, except for some gardens and a beautiful view of Kusadasi and the island of Samos. It is a very nice 15 min walks form the harbor with very good view, beaches and restaurants."
265,Nice rest stop,"You have to walk out and visit this castle. Not only is the view fantastic but inside there is one very big surprise, I will not spoil it.Go and find out for yourself!!"
266,Average,"I enjoyed the walk down the promenade, then along the harbour  to the castle. The first thing was the garden - numerous different trees and flowers. Just a great combination with the stones. The castle itself was locked, you could only peep through the door. But I very much enjoyed the view to open sea, to the centre of the city and towards Ladies Beach. It is only there that you realize how beautiful the coastline is and how varied. You could sit and watch for hours. It is well worth spending an hour, just to have a look at Kusadasi from the other side. Quite different from the view from a hotel, I think. I have noticed numerous pieces of paper placed on several trres aroud a garve. The locals explained they were placed by people who had a wish to make, hoping their wish will come true. I don't know if this is right, but it told me something about the locals that I did not know before."
267,"If you are staying at Kusadasi, take a few photos otherwise skip.",this was the very best night out - the entertainment was professional dancers and musicians - we went in a party - and had a great time [although there was one couple who moaned at everything and everyone] - don't mistake the margarine for squares of cheese in the buffet - yeuk!
268,Walk in the town instead,Pigeon island is worth a visit. The views at sundown are magnificent. There is a lot to see and it's a great stroll at early evening to see th sun go down and maybe a 5 lira boat ride to see sun set. That's peanuts for the spectacle.
269,caravanserai,"So, my wife and daughters were less than impressed with Kusadasi due to the overly aggressive Turkish vendors selling their wares in town, and they quickly returned to the ship having said they've set foot in Turkey. My son and I decided to stay and venture out on foot to Pigeon Island and Kusadasi Castle. Apparently it really is an island and the permanent pier/footbridge you take to get there was only built in the 1960's. Lots of tour boats and fishermen there if you are interested. Otherwise, the walk from the ship terminal to the castle is about 15 minutes. Very well-preserved and maintained castle with amazing views of the port and Aegean Sea. Free admission, easy flat walk, and great pictures. We boys enjoyed our Kusadasi experience!"
270,Worth a look,"A short walk from the centre through the shopping streets, along the waterfront to the Castle. Entry is along a causeway where all the boat day trips leave. Its free to visit. There is not a lot to see, but its worth to go for the views and the tranquillity of the small gardens. There is a cage which has peacocks in it, with pigeons those these can get out. There are rabbits under the decking at the top. Inside the castle is a skeleton of a whale. There are steps leading to the roof of the castle but this was blocked off. You can make a day of it at the castle as you can hire sun beds and swim in the sea."
271,Better off Viewed from a Distance!,"Luckily on our first trip to Kusadasi 3 years ago, the castle was open, and we managed to spend some time walking round it, but the last 2 years, it  has been closed, unfortunately. But it is well worth a visit when it is open again."
272,Fortress - I love them,"At present, the castle is not accessible due to restoration. It looks great from a distance and is probably best viewed from there."
273,What a waste!,"As it was in many coastal cities of the Mediterranean and Black seas, the first fortress on Bird island was built by the Genoese in the XIII century. The Genoese tower remained in the center of the fortress. After the conquest of the coast by the Ottoman Turks in the XV century, the island was renamed Pigeon island, and the fortress was renamed Guverjinada (Pigeon island in Turkish). The current castle was built by the Ottoman architect Ilyas Agha, and the construction was supervised by the Ottoman Admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa - a famous pirate who terrorized the coastal Mediterranean cities in the XVI century. The fortress became his base. You can get acquainted with the lair of Barbarossa for free. Walking distance from the center of 7 minutes. Guverjinada is no longer an island, but a Peninsula, connected to the shore by a 300-meter embankment to which the yachts are moored. The fortress itself inside is a well-kept Park with beautiful paths, benches, running rabbits and small guns, so that tourists do not forget that they are still in the fortress. A whale skeleton found in 2014 is on display in the Central tower. Another reason for visiting is due to the fact that the clever Turks included the fortress in the object ""Trading Posts and Fortifications on Genoese Trade Routes"", included in the list of candidates for UNESCO world heritage. Many candidates have been there for decades, but as a multiple object, it might be lucky..."
274,Could be better promoted,"Despite the castle itself being closed, the walk to and around the castle is still worthwhile in and of itself. It's only a short walk from the centre of Kusadasi, and this along the waterfront, which on sunny days is radiant with its amazingly turquoise water. The castle is on Pigeon Island, and there are nice views of the town and Aegean Sea from the island.My advice is to enjoy the experience as a pleasant walk and relax with an Efes (local beer) afterwards. There are plenty of other (and better) historic sites to see in Turkey."
275,need to turn it back to how it was,The Pigeon island is the main attraction in Kusadasi. They say in the past there were pirates on the island. Then the Ottomans made a castle there. Wild pigeons must have chosen the island because of it's being far from the mainland. In 60s they built a road connecting the island with the mainland. Now the castle is restored and has a nice garden around. The view to the bay from the walls is magnificent! They still keep pigeons on the island in the big cage.
276,Nice views,"The castle is on an island connected by a pier, where you can take daily boat trips. The castle is a small renovated building, might nothing particular with it. But the garden surrounding it, the old trees, bird houses, plants and flowers are so lovely. It is a perfect place to relax, read a book, have a short walk or just to sit under a tree and watch the boats on the sea."
277,Pigeon Island is no fortress - but has a nice view.,"Anyone visiting Kusadasi will instantly notice the attractive castle on what used to be an Island on the edge of the harbor. A walkway now connects the mainland to the castle and many tour boats dock along the walkway. The castle has been restored, and has several walking paths and benches around it. There isn’t much to see inside other than an exhibit containing the skeleton of an unusual whale that washed ashore nearby. However, it is a way to get a great view of the city."
278,"nice views, fort crumbling","I sound like an idiot tourist, (but that is what I am), when I say that this is a lovely little castle which has been really well restored and if you are nearby it is well worth a visit. There are some bones and foundations and lots of ""stuff"" which I am sure is wonderful, but we just popped by because we were in the area and enjoyed our visit."
279,Very Peaceful area,"Situated at the end of a short pier, only 5 to 10 minutes walk from the town centre, the castle gives you an attractive view of the harbour area.  A little bit of hassle as you walk along from locals trying to sell you a boat trip!   Hassle also from local taxi drivers. Just a shame it was closed for renovation,  as at June 2015. Hopefully will reopen soon but worth checking before you set off from the town."
280,nice view / great place to take photos,"We went to the castle on a whim because we had some extra time before checking out of our hotel and we were pleasantly surprised.  There was no entrance fee, and in the morning, there weren't many people there.  Inside the gate, the grounds were well maintained (like a giant garden), and there were benches to stop along the way.  There were nice views of the city, hills, and sea from the top, and there's a fin whale skeleton on display in the top tower.  It doesn't take long to visit, and it's within walking distance from the city center."
281,A tranquil place with great views of Kusadasi ...,"Kusadasi was originally a collection of small towns, until earthquakes destroyed Ephesus and its harbour in the seventh century AD, and the Byzantines had to create an alternative trading port. They amalgamated the cluster of little towns near Pigeon Island to form Scala Nova. It grew to become a thriving port city by the time the Ottomans invaded in 1413 AD. They named the port Kusadasi (which means ""Bird Island"") after little Pigeon Island just offshore. They also built a stone wall around Pigeon Island and a small tower on its high point, and installed some cannons as a warning to shipping. Whatever the Turks meant this little fortification to be, it was never a fortress. It's nothing like the vast and impressive fortress of Saint Peter at Bodrum forther down the coast (see my review of that Fortress on TripAdvisor.) Instead, Pigeon Island is more like a walled garden, with trees and terraces and a square stand-alone tower at the highest point.Today, you can easily walk to Pigeon Island along the foreshore esplanade, 700 meters south of the cruise liner terminal. Pigeon Island is connected to the mainland by a solid 150 meter causeway to which a row of Turkish Gulats are always tied up stern first. Beyond them is the only gate in the circuit wall that runs around Pigeon Island. This gate bears a sign warning that the island is open from 8am to 6pm, but in fact the gate appears to always be open, so you can walk through it at any hour. Inside, a stone slab path winds uphill through trees and bushes, past several viewing platforms that overlook the sea, to the square tower that rises from the highest point on Pigeon Island. This tower has little of interest inside, and is is only open when the gate-keeper (who lives in a small building on the island) decides to open it. He keeps irregular hours, but he's usually around somewhere and he's quite friendly. If you find the tower closed, you can walk around the island in 15 minutes and see it all. There's little else on the island itself to grab your attention. You'll find a few old cannons piled up beside the gate-keeper's house, but not much else in the way of history. However, from the northern side of the low circuit wall, you get a good view back to Kusadasi and its cruise terminal which is often crowded with rows of huge cruise boats that totally dominate the town. Kusadasi was always a trading port, and today it trades in tourists. They flood the place from these huge boats, and make it a total tourist trap. But if you want to get away from the Kusadasi crowds and enjoy a little peace and quiet while you're in town, take an early morning stroll along the esplanade to Pigeon Island and walk up to the higher parts near the tower, and sit on the wall as the mist lifts off the water. The fort is nothing to write home about, but there's no denying Pigeon Island offers some beautiful views."
282,Take a picnic,"This castle is located on a picturesque little island just off Kusadasi seafront. There is paid parking on the opposite side of the road. The walk to the island is along the scenic walkway flanked by the boats at the marina with photo points all the way through. The island is really small and houses the remnants of the little castle, the entry to which is free. Inside the main building is the skeleton of a giant whale amongst other things. It is a lovely walk inside the island with stunning views of the sea and the city itself, which one could cover in under 30 minutes. There is a cafe outside the entrance. The island and the castle look stunning in the night lights as well. Although there is not a great deal to see, I would still rate this attraction high, for the sheer beauty, especially if you are there to watch the sunset!"
283,Worth the walk,"Our cruise stopped in Kusadasi and we walked the promenade until we arrived at the castle.  Slightly away from the city centre,  lovely and peaceful place, part of the history of this place. The fortress is on the beautiful sea, lovely view,  ideal for pictures.  The entrance is free and it's a lovely walk around the walls. There's no very much inside but it deserves the visit also to escape from the intrusive atmosphere of the city centre and the shops.  Lovely"
284,Could be a gem,"When we docked in Kusadasi port during a cruise, instead of going on an excursion,  we decided to stay local and walk around.  Pigeon Island (real name is Guvercinada) is a short distance from the port, so we walked over after visiting the town to see the small castle on the island.  The place looks very interesting, but as we got closer to the castle, the entrance was closed to visitors as there is some work being done.  I was very disappointed.  But you get a nice view of the city."
285,Worth a quick  visit,A pleasant walk from Kusadasi along the waterfront past the tour boats brings you to the castle. Free to enter it is worth walking around for half an hour or more - views are super and the garden inside the walls pleasant enough.Best part of the visit was an excellent mixed mezze and beer at the cafe just outside followed by an hour long  trip (£1.20) on one of the boats berthed along the causeway.
286,Pigeon Island,"On a recent cruise we opted not to go to Ephesus, as we had visited there more than once in the past, but looked forward to walk out to Pigeon Island. Be advised that this was not possible. The road out to the island is under construction and although they allow you to tip toe through the mess when you get to the castle a security guard unceremoniously sends you back. I am not sure how difficult it would have been to put a sign up at the entrance to the roadway or a gate advising tourists that the castle was not accessible. It was disappointing and frustrating for us and the several other couples who experienced this when we were there."
287,Old Landmark,Nice castle on a small island accessible via a causeway from kusadasi. Nice curtain wall. Small keep. Only one floor of the keep is open and contains approx half a dozen not overly accurate ship models and an impressive whale skeleton. The gardens within the walls are well kept with plenty of information boards. You're not supposed to climb the walls but there are decking areas offering an excellent panorama of the town. All this and it's free too!
288,Picturesque,"Although the view of the castle from the main town of Kusadasi is lovely, there is currently no access inside of it as it's closed for renovations hence only the 3*"
289,A nice little walkaround,"Walk from Kusadasi, ""Bird Island,"" along the promenade to Pigeon Island's 13th Century Byzantine castle/fortress.  This fortress protected against pirates, later Venetians and Genoese.  Enjoy the gardens.Return along the promenade, passing Kusadasi Bulent Ecevit Parki, then on to restaurant row.  Toros is the oldest, 1894, restaurant.  You pick your fish or bring it from the fish market, Balik Hali, and have it prepared at the restaurant."
290,Pigeon Island,What a stunning place! Walking around the castle walls is like stepping back into time. The over all ambience and views are just amazing. Perfect place to have a stroll and enjoy the sun set.
291,Pleasant walk .. .,"When I heard that there was a castle in Kusadasi on what is known as Pigeon Island, I determined to visit it. Unfortunately it is currently closed for restoration. What we saw of the exterior of the castle was pretty impressive so if the inner buildings are restored to a similar standard then this building will be well worth visiting in the future."
292,historical area,"This small fortress covers most of the tiny island from which Kusadasi gets its name.  It is connected to the mainland by a pier and is a short walk from the town centre and the port.  I finally got to go inside in my most recent visit in July 2019.  On my previous visits to Kusadasi in 2000, 2004, and 2014, it was closed and locked up.  I walked around the outside of it in 2014 but then the gate was locked and the outside was just overgrown with grass and weeds.  The pier was bare concrete with a railing.  Back then, the pier and the area outside the walls was the site of people fishing or swimming, or youths hanging out.  Now, the pier is  decorated with a wall on one side showing pictures of the town and castle through the years, amongst other things.  the whole area outside is cleaned up, there is a snack bar outside the entrance, and fishing is prohibited.  Inside, the castle has been turned into a very nicely landscaped park and botanical garden with many trees and plants, walkways, benches, signs with information about the plants, etc.,  There is even a small platform offering yoga meetings, etc., and inside the main citadel there are displays including model wooden ships.  There are nice views of the harbour and town form the walls and it is a pleasant spot to relax and explore.  There is a small lighthouse."
293,Going back in time,"The castle and gardens have recently been thoroughly improved, with boardwalks in places, information boards added, and paths much improved from 5 years or so ago.  It's a nice place to wander round, but the only thing in the castle itself is the skeleton of a whale, along with a few information boards.  However, from the gardens you do get a great view of the harbour, along with any cruise ships there may be in dock.Amazingly, there is no charge for going in, so if you have an hour to spare, this could be a nice place to go.  And the toilet block at the bottom is clean, with real sit-on loos!"
294,Not much to see.,"The stone fortress from the 15th century, built in the middle of the island and surrounded by walls, has thus become the trademark of Kusadasi. From a small fishing village, Kusadasi, almost overnight, has developed into a place with a large harbor where you constantly arriving huge ocean liners. It is a city with paved pedestrian streets full of souvenir shops, leather, jewelry and carpets. All houses slope down to the bay, so you have the impression that at any moment fall into the sea. The old part of the city is a strange combination of unusual, narrow and cobbled streets with houses in the Ottoman style, full of small restaurants and Turkish bars."
295,go to pigeon island,"The beautiful ruins such the Library of Celsus, the Odeon, the Temple of Hadrian, the Artemis Temple, etc.  are still there for you to enjoy.  There is no shade, so please make sure you bring water, sun hat, umbrella, and sunscreen.  ent Ephesus are"
296,Romantic,"The castle is situated very close to the city center of Kusadasi and is located on a lone island accessible by foot. It used to serve as a watch out for the people of this town in olden times especially as a shield of defence from the pirates and sea-dacoits. The castle itself is wonderfully constructed and is a piece of marvel to roam around. One can sit in tranquility and have nice views of the beach, sea and the city from here. There is no ticket for the site and it also has a couple of coffee / juice shops for the amusement of tourists."
297,Nice view to the harbor and city,"The Fortress of Kusadasi occupies just about all of Pigeon Island and is connected to the mainland by a causeway.  On the day of my visit, the fortress was locked and we were unable to gain access, but I enjoyed photographing what was a main defense for the harbor under Turkish rule (beginning in 1086).  The site is impossibly photogenic!"
298,A nice small castle at Kusadasi Harbour,"The Kusadasi castle encompasses a island on the Kusadasi beach. In fact, the meaning of Kusadasi is the island of Pigeon (Dove), which was named during the Ottomans due to the migration and life of the birds there. This stronghold was built to protect the valuable Ottoman Empire trade from the ocean from pirates, including Barbarossa's pirates. The castle also protects the city against marine invasions. A small Kusadasi stone castle is located on a road adjoining Gouvernin Adasi (Pigeon Island or Pigeon Island), which is a bright spot at night. Access to this castle is by a passage that leads to the east of the island and looks Kusadasi. This passage is a very popular route for couples walking. This castle dates from the Ottoman period and was made by Admiral Barbarosa in 1534 AD. The castle is usually closed, but there is a museum inside it that is open to the public. This castle is one of the most prominent tourist sites in Kusadasi."
299,A pleasant walk,"Güvercin ada kalesi-Pigeon island Castle, one of the seals of great  Ottoman admiral Barbarossa built by him in 1534 AD, is located in the gulf of Kusadasi to protect  the town. Barbarossa, who was the founder of Ottoman navy & fleet and the great admiral of Ottoman mariners, known as Hayreddin Pasha as the founder of Ottoman maritime in 16th century. When he was appointed as the admiral of Ottoman navy, he was also given  a large state from Kusadası to Algeria covering the Aegean & Mediterranean islands. Kuşadası became the sea port and the custom so Barbarossa ordered a castle built on the pigeon island as the sea base of ottoman mariners. The castle on pigeon island became one of the most important  Military bases later centuries and it protected Kuşadası from the attacks of pirates and knights of Rhodes.  The inner castle and the  outer walls with towers were built originally by Barbarossa  but it was  altered & rebuilt several times.  The outer walls which are 3m high from ground were built  during the rebbellion of Mora 1825 AD  and it was restored last year. The stones used for building the castle were brought from hillside neaby known as Yılancı Burnu-Serpent Cape. The gate of the pigeon island castle is located on the south of the walls and is entered by  10 steps with a watch tower in each 100 m. The castle is overlooking through  Kuşadası and it has inner castle in better conditions, 7 canon balls from Ottoman times on display and  a gravestone inside. The Guvercin ada castle has just been  restored by Turkish government and is being prepared for visitors by the help of kusadası municipality.  Hopefully It will be be opened in June."
