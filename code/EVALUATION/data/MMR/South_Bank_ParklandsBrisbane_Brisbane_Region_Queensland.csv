0,Great place,"Amazing gardens and area in general.Being an ex Victorian, comparisons between both South Banks was inevitable. Got to say not even close...Brisbane and the gardens, the pool/swimming...just excels.Well done Brisvegas"
1,Best place to relax!,"Visiting family in Brisbane, we were advised to check out Southbank Parklands. Wow, what a place this is. Take a stroll along the Brisbane river, with its sights, views, activities and man made beach!Sat along side the river, under the views of the city skyline, is a hive of activity. A swimming pool and man made beach full of locals, tourists and visitors from all over. We came here 4 times in our 3 week visit. A great way to get some pool/beach time right in the heart of the city. Loads of local shops and bars, a huge variety of food options, meal deals, sweets, cakes and ice creams.We came back on a Saturday afternoon for the markets and the place was buzzing. Market stalls lined the central avenue, all of the bars were busy, all allowing kids in too. Live music at the plough inn and a real buzz around. Southbank by night has a real city feel to it. Great scenes, a very pleasant walk to the Brisbane sign and wheel along the river and still people in the pools at 10pm. I cant stress how good this place is. Possibly the highlight of our visit to Brisbane!"
2,Pleasant Outing,"We had breakfast at Next Door Cafe in South Bank (excellent) then wandered around the South Bank Parkland what a great place for families of all ages. The beach, entertainment, markets, cafes or just wander amongst the gardens.  Sit and watch the Brisbane River traffic always interesting and relaxing Look forward to visiting again."
3,Excellent place to spend a few hours,Marvellous use of the riverside in the middle of a city. Great for kids and plenty of nice restaurants for the grownups
4,The veggie garden!!!,Whether enjoying the sites of the city from the South bank cool lush gardens to lounging in a tropical lagoon. South bank has something for every one. Regular markets are held each week and a variety of entertainment can be found. Loads of food options in a variety of eaterys. Catch a ferry and travel along the Brisbane River to South Bank and have a great day out.
5,Just go there!,"A beautiful cobination of gardens, water features and local wildlife. Well maintained, clean and just amazing.A short walk out of the CBD, or 1 stop on the train from the city.Enjoyed a pleasant sunny Sunday afternoon strole around the grounds."
6,Great family activity,"South Bank Parklands is a ""must do"" when in Brisbane, beautiful park and ""Streets Beach"" right in the city... Awesome!  Easy access with the free... yes free City Hopper Ferry.  Open 07:00 - Midnight and it is free!"
7,Worth a look,Southbank Parklands on the Brisbane River has something for absolutely everyone. After wandering east through the bougainvillea -covered walkway we made our way down to the beautiful grassed area and sat to watch the city light up as it got dark. Then dinner up behind the lawn at River Quays. Delicious seafood and cold wine looking across the river lit by the city and the Story Bridge. Just beautiful!
8,Well kept family space.,"I really enjoyed the walk and the scenery, something different. A must visit place in Brisbane, recommended !"
9,The Main Attraction The Wheel Not Operating.,Visited here with our Brisbane Greeter on our tour.  The way the South Bank was developed after Expo 88 is really beautiful and seems very successful.The beach area is unexpected and so inviting.  I wish I had time to swim or had my grandchildren with me.
10,Beautifull well kept family friendly and clean spaces,"This place is amazing! Right on the Brisbane River amongst CBD. Wer had a great day.  Ice cream stalls and plenty of yum eateries. Life guards patrolling all areas, but very safe. So much fun for the family."
11,Under construction ,"Southbank parklands is a lovely place to visit; the gardens are beautiful with an archway of bright bougainvilleas growing over the top of it and beautiful gardens. There is a man-made beach that is very popular with families and walking alongside the river is lovely, particularly at night time where the city lights shine and reflect on the water."
12,Such a great day out,Great place to wander through tropical gardens and lovely sandy beaches right in the CBD.  Ride the Wheel of Brisbane for great city views.   Great place for families.
13,What a wonderful place!,"One of ""must to visit"" places when in Brisbane. Lot of happy faces tell you about it. When you tired of walking, find you spot and enjoy people watching and beer. On your own or not, one will have a nice relaxing time. More bars and street food would suit better than chain restaurants."
14,Just a get together.,"South banks has something for everyone of any age day and night. Chill by the man made lagoon at beach street, grab a cool drink at one of the may bars, have a picnic or stroll the river. Kids water parks nearby and of a weekend a lovely market. Not a place to be missed."
15,Always nice to wander along the river but very ugly due to construction atm,If only other councils followed the lead of Brisbane free across river ferries for access area gorgeous.
16,It's beautiful ,"This is a lovely precinct of Brisbane, and def worth seeing if you are visiting.  Whether it is a day swimming at the 'beaches' and having ice creams or an after dinner stroll and hot chocolate, this area has everything you need.  Located very close (walking distance) to the city centre, it also is the area that has the Performing Arts Complex (QPAC) as well as Museum etc.  Well worth a a visit."
17,great place to relax,"So many different experiences in this magical part of Brisbane - you can enjoy the man made beach, stroll through beautifully manicured gardens and areas of rainforest, spot the water dragons along curved pathways, soak in the atmosphere of the Nepalese Peace pagoda or enjoy a coffee, meal or a drink at one of the myriad restaurants, cafes and pubs which are scattered throughout these extensive Parklands. Good for all ages, and a wonderful vantage point for fireworks if you happen to be in Brisbane at New Year or RiverFire during the Brisbane Festival annually in September."
18,Family fun,South bank parklands is a really nice part of Brisbane. It's great for relaxing and soaking up the Queensland sun
19,Great place to wander round,"This is a haven in the city - from Streets Beach (a man made tropical 'beach') to the riverside walk and Nepalese Peace Pagoda, nestled in its small rainforest environment, South Bank is a great place to wander, eat and enjoy the warm weather."
20,"Relax, Unwind and Fun",Lots to see and do in the Parklads. Very relaxing walking by the Brisbane River and under the Arbour walkway.
21,Excellent for wandering ,Southbank Beach was very nice for a swim and to relax and rest by the poolside. Although a manmade beach I would highly recommend it. The best part was a café called NODO at Southbank near the manmade beach which had all gluten free food which is great if you are a coeliac or gluten intolerant. (Yummy doughnuts! Gluten free)
22,Loved this place,We were in Brisbane for Christmas and the south bank parklands were so festive. Also great place to sit and watch the world go by. This dome is in the park lands where you can sit watch the lights change colour in keeping with the music really lovely.
23,Magical place,"We visited South Bank several times and loved the whole area, great selection of food and bars, culture plus excellent surroundings, we went on the Brisbane Wheel and a great view and good value and we also used the Brisbane Ferries from here, I would recommend catching a Bus to Southbank as car parks are way expensive and not worth it."
24,where to have lunch,Impressed by the cleanliness and gardens in this area. Nice walk along the river. Ferry services available.
25, Brilliant oasis in the city,"Lovely to walk through, really felt odd with so few people and no food fair. Plough Inn, as usual, was great"
26,Fabulous place in the City,"I like this place as it has different aspects mixed all together. A place by the river, has swimming pools and sand, kids friendly, Free of charge, and very close to the city centre. You can spend a full day with your kids over-there (Open from 7:00 to 7:00)."
27,Great place to relax!,This area along the river bank has been very well done and a real credit to Brisbane.Extensive landscaping and paving make for a lovely walk through this area.We also went on the Brisbane Eye to get another view of the area.There are nice places to eat and drink near the Eye.  We also visited the museum which was very well set out and free to visit.We also did a Segway tour that went through the area.Well worth spending a morning visit.
28,A hightlight culture and recreation meld at Brisbane's heart,"Southbank Parklands is beautiful. Can be busy with markets, cafes and restaurants. r just chill on the lawn by the river in the serenity among the pristine gardens. A definite Must Do when visiting Brisbane"
29,Sunny Southbank,"Excellent. Free to use. And as Brisbane doesn’t have a beach near the CBd, this is the perfect compromise without having to travel."
30,LOVE THIS PLACE!,"Well done Brisbane. this is a beautuful inner city sanctuary where families can meet/play/have a picnic FOR FREE. It is safe and generally clean. There are lots of outlets nearby for food and drink, changing facilities, public transport links!!"
31,What a wonderful place to walk through,"Absolutely beautiful, hot but awesome. I was particularly taken with the edible gardens, would love a love here just to look at the specialty gardens, well done!"
32,Beautiful,"Beautiful gardens and area to walk through, along the riverfront.  Very comfortable and easy to walk through."
33,Great place to go,"My favourite place in Brisbane is Southbank.  It is the relaxed atmosphere you want on a holiday. Great food, great cinema, the pool area is great too."
34,"Beautiful, tranquil, easy to walk around",I visited South Bank parklands  a few times with my little grandson fabulous day out. Week days were reasonably quiet. Highly recommend this spot for anyone visiting Brisbane.
35,Peaceful,"With no true beach near the heart of the CBD Brisbane has compensated by creating this wonderland for young and old, where you don’t have to spend a dime to take in the beauties of the city."
36,Really nice area for fun,What a surprise to walk along this parkland.  So well planned and maintained.  Watched many small children with their parents enjoying the safe water areas.  A jewel in Brisbane's crown.
37,Streets beach,"Highly Recommended - Southbank and surrounds is a MUST DO when in Brisbane. A beach in the middle of the CBD where else but QLD. The entire area is an entertainment precinct with loads of restaurants and activities from seeing a show to outdoor cinemas. Swim at the beach or BBQ/Picnic on the grass, there is plenty to explore or just sit back & relax. DO NOT MISS Southbank Parklands"
38,Great spot,"Greats views of the Brisbane River and city. Pools in a man made beach setting for swimming, BBQ’s, restaurants, hotels. It has it all."
39,Great for everyone !!!!,"Families who are exploring Brisbane, this is the pick especially with families.Close by there ice cream place, restaurants and playgrounds with pool!You can easily spend the whole day there!"
40,Don’t forget your bathers,"SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE- fancy a stroll along riverside paths with great river/city views and plenty of shaded seating to take off the load?- maybe some time at a free 170m long twin pool area along with sizeable beach zones (lifeguards/change sheds of course)?- does exploring or relaxing at several rainforest zones appeal? Or strolling thru the one km long ARBOUR? - or maybe riding a big ferirs wheel?- are historic things your jam? The abutments of the old Victoria Bridge are well preserved and notated at the north end of this 1km long strip of greenery and the MARITIME MUSEUM at the south end has no shortage of old boats and stuff.- picnic time? Lotsa grassed areas to spread out a blanket and don the old feed bag. Plenty of free BBQ grills.-free kids and adult entertainment – some regular, some special events.- some overseas culture? - the Nepalese Pogoda will be of interest- or maybe something in the adjacent precinct – an art gallery, exhibition centre, cultural centre, high end hotels, some trendy streets with dining, take-away, shopping yada.TIPS- I accessed from the city via the latest version of the VICTORIA BRIDGE but it is possible to come in by ferry or by bus (the adjacent precinct has bus stations). No doubt that area has parking and I saw a few bicycle racks within the parklands. Online sites will  have fuller access info.- there are 3 ferry piers for SOUTH BANK – each for a different ferry service. I used the 3rd most southern where the free CITY HOPPER ferry calls, to exit. The MARITIME MUSEUM also has a stop.SUM UP – this is a good one, an area where a person, couple or family could spend most of the day at minimal or even no cost."
41,Wonderful free venue in central Brisbane for families.,"A pretty good idea for a city that has no immediate beach. A large clean pool with option for kids and grown ups, even aqua gym classes! Great idea to spend the morning under the sun, with Brisbane skyline as your view"
42,Lovely night walks and fun sunny day swims,"South Bank Parklands are great for all ranges of people - Families with young children as they can swim and play in the water park, Couples to swim, go on a Ferris wheel or go have a lovely breakfast, lunch or dinner. Also for a drink - they have nice restaurants all close by and they are all great"
43,Oasis in the city,"Even though crowded at Christmas, it was still ideal for kids to cool off. Parking underneath. Well planned different depths."
44,A must-do 🚲🛴⛴🏖🚴🏊🏊🚣‍♀️,"Right in the heart of Brisbane City is this well-designed family area, with a supervised beach, swimming lagoon, play areas, gardens, walks and eateries all along the banks of Brisbane river. You can easily spend the day here walking, swimming, take a city cat on the water, explore all the nearby museums and art galleries and choose from a plethora of eateries. It is beautiful at night too with the city lights shining onto the water. There is also QPAC centre, live music at nearby restaurants, markets, a cinema, and tons more. I love the Mexican a street back and near the Brisbane wheel. Check out the tourist info centre for more details and any special events happening in the open amphitheatre in South Bank. The only drawback is it does get busy but there is always somewhere to lounge around and watch the sights of the river and city."
45,Good fun ,"South Bank is a very nice Place on the other Riverside from Brisbane. There you can find the art gallery, the museum, one city beach, a nice park and a lot of different places to eat or drink a coffee. You arrive South Bank via city cat or city hopper from the North Warf or by foot via the Victoria Bridge (directly on the Treseary Building)"
46,Not just a beach but a place to explore.,I always enjoy wandering through these parklands. The highlight for me is the urban beach - this is such an asset for Brisbane. And it's free to use (other than the lockers for clothing and belonging).
47,Beach in the City CBD,Took my granbabies for a day out to the Southbank Parklands. Was a lovely placed to spend the day.Will go back again.
48,Serenity at South Bank,South bank is a must to visit when in brisbane. Amazing park for the kids and a great pool and inland beach with life guards. We spent the whole day here.
49,Every growing; ever wonderous,I was impressed by the nice pool and beach and view. The gardens were lovely. Nice area to walk through. Was expecting shops but there were only a few restaurants really. Definitely a must see . Nice little parks also and some lizards hanging about.
50,Love love love Southbank,"not bad for a fake beach, few bandaids around and a couple of cheeky young fellas, but all in all beats swimming in the river"
51,Lovely to see,"Travelled to Southbank for a very restful afternoon, plenty of open spaces, large beach area fully supervised, coffee shop and many small eateries available. Don’t take a watch and just vege out. You will come back so refreshed. Southbank markets always worthwhile to visit when on."
52,Great place to stay cool,"I had never really been to South Bank Parklands until recently,wow!I had no idea how much planning has gone into this area.It’s clean,manicured full of birds I’ve never heard before. The edible garden is stunning,there are so many spots to satisfy anyone.This is outstanding Brisbane and like a massive Botanical Gardens with restaurants,bars , cafes, pools ,markets ( weekends) and space just to chill out.A must for anyone!"
53,An Excellent Place for Kids and Adults Alike,"Brisbane have created this parkland with so much thought and foresight. A wonderful tourist area with tropical vegetation, walkways, recreation facilities including swimming pools, cafes and gardens. Great view of the city and close to an awesome museum, theatres and more. Well done Brisbane!"
54,Lovely place for a day out,Cross over  the river from the CBD via bridge or City Cat and enter the quiet gentle walkways of the South Bank. Walk amongst the cultivated herb gardens or bimble through the rainforest finally relax in a deck chair close to the lagoon. This area has been tastefully built to give a quiet area close to the CBD.
55,A beach village and lagoon inside the City of Brisbane,"We live in Brisbane, and love Southbank Parklands all year round.It is built on the old site of the 1988 World Expo on the south side of the Brisbane River, and offers many food outlets, views of the Brisbane CBD, swimming, covered walkways, rainforest, and a close walk to the CBD, train stations, bus stations etc.It is also in close proximity to the wonderful Museum, Sky Wheel, Library, and QPAC (Qld Performing Arts Centre)"
56,Perfect for a hot Brissy Day!,A lot going here with a lovely beach area and pools. Very easy to get to on the city hopper ferry. Plenty of restaurants. Museums and Brisbane eye very close. All in all a nice way to spend the day
57,A MUST DO when in Brisbane,"This is a lovely area of Brisbane to walk along the river bank, enjoy the parks and cultural venues and indulge in some excellent eating options in a relaxed atmosphere."
58,Stay cool in a cool new world city,"This is the best area in Brisbane. Beautiful park, free pools, gym lessons, jogging routes and evening walks. Very safe to walk and spend time. Nice cafeterias and small restaurants in the park and nearby streets. Magnificent evening view to the city."
59,Southbank is a winner for the whole family,"One of the great spots to spend time and appreciate the beauty of the southbank parkland area. Great places to eat, great vibe and safe"
60,Fantastic place to visit,Inner city casual and relaxing atmosphere. A lovely walk with plenty to see. Coffees. Ice cream or a meal with a lot of dietary options.
61,Excellent location for a family picnic,"Great eateries from cheap as chips to a higher price range. Take in a show at QPAC, check out the Museum, splash around the beach and pool or just sit at one of the many eateries enjoying a coffee or something stronger, and just relax and watch the world go by. Great place for date nights, family picnics or just enjoy a stroll along the river.If you can travel in by bus saves trying to find a park because this can be difficult especially on a Sat night. If you drive in be prepared to be patient."
62,Beautiful place,"I am from Brisbane and never been prouder of my city than to walk through the beautiful parklands the gardens are so well maintained and manacured and there is plenty of wildlife and restaurants I also like the chairs they provide on the lawns , we walked from the city botanical gardens over the friendship bridge right into the gardens ,, what a treat then caught the train back from south Brisbane station,"
63,Boardwalk South Bank,This is a very nice calm place. Reminds you of Miami a little bit. The options of the pools is really cool. They have a salt water and a chlorine one. A lot of nice restaurants along the strip and music. Great place to take family of all ages. Also great place for photos.
64,Great food choices,"This place is in many ways the beating heart of Brisbane. I love it! You can walk for miles, swim, ride, skate, sit and eat-oh and shop! What’s not to love? Recently here and wandered and ate and took selfies and people watched, was a perfect spot to do as little or as much as you want!"
65,Fantastic,"Fabulous little spot hidden away behind main streets. Gorgeous gardens, lovely restaurants and even a little beach!"
66,Cool off on a hot day by having a swim,"When staying in the heart of the city, the South Bank Parklands is just a short walk away, on the other side of the river.It is an extremely well maintained area, very suitable for families, or those wishing to take a leisurely stroll.There is a man made beach, plenty of lawn areas, and walking paths thru the gardens.There are also great views of the river and the city !"
67,Oasis,"Absolutely loved South bank parklands we didn't every evening we were in Brisbane walking through the parklands and down South Bank, we spent some of the day at the pool/beach side. Worth a visit and a lovely way to past time."
68,Beautiful area,"The parklands are absolutely beautiful. Lovely to find some shade among the trees or to walk along the waterfront. Can get the local water transportation along there. The man made beach is a bit funny. There are people laying around in full on bikinis etc. and there was even a photo shoot one evening when I was walking by. The real beaches (ocean) which are amazing are about 45 minutes to an hour away. This beach is a huge man made beach in the parkland near the river. There is a section that is a fun water play area for younger kids. Huge climbing structure for kids. Also, cool area to hang out in giant circle hammocks. Definitely go for a stroll through if visiting Brisbane."
69,South Bank Parklands,"Parklands, resturants,live music and great recreational activities in a beach setting right in the centre of Brisbane.This is a great place for locals and tourists to experience it all."
70,Great relaxing day or Family day out,"Great for young families, wonderful to have a beach on the cities doorstep! A very worthwhile spot to visit & relax on a warm day!"
71,A Must Do,In the middle of the city you get a beachside experience which is superb. It’s a safe environment for children but also has lifeguards present. The area is adjacent to bars and restaurants along with a market on Saturday.
72,Wonderful family day out.,"South Bank Parklands was a welcome change of pace and atmosphere from Brisbane's CBD shopping district. Vibrant and full of life, this amazing area offers something for every member of the family to enjoy. Kids can relax at the park or pool patrolled by the amazing lifeguards. Take a scooter or e-bike up along the river paths to immerse yourself in Brisbane's delightful river views featuring stunning locations to take photos back toward the CBD. If it's more adventure you want there are jet ski tours, kayak tours and cruises to sate all lifestyels when exploring. After you've had enough exploring, take the time to dine on the culinary treats offered up by the plethora of restaurants and bars available in and around Grey Street. There's something to suit everyone's tastes and did I mention gelato?"
73,Very nice place with an city beach,The South Bank Parklands area is absolutely spectacular! I started the day by taking a 5 km run along the foreshore. It was buzzing with people out exercising and enjoying the space. We then came back later with my two boys (5 and 2). They loved the playground and it catered for many different age groups. The swimming area was fantastic. Great for many different levels of swimmers. We had lunch in this area and just generally walked around. We were so impressed with the different areas and how they all aesthetically fit into the space. There was a lot of green space which I think is so important in cities. The restaurants were many and varied. Overall it was a great area that caters for many needs.
74,Excellent ,"This area of Brisbane is simply fabulous. There is plenty of accommodation and restaurants. The beach pool is excellent with a life guard on duty. Great places overlooking all the action to have a drink. You can even take your own picnic. Just walking along the beautiful path & having a ride on the wheel is great. If not staying in Southbank, it's an easy walk from Brisbane city, or can hire a scooter at various location. Love this layed back place. Its a must to visit if staying in Brisbane. You won't want to leave!"
75,Excellent for Family Funs and Leisure Walk,"Southbank Parklands is an amazing site for all family. Great outdoor attraction, free and designed for all ages. Visit Streets beach on a hot day, and then head to Flowstate to experience amazing surround relaxing music to end the day. Take a pic at Brisbane sign and check the city from up high at the Wheel of Brisbane (paid). If you're feeling inspired, go watch a play at Queensland Arts Performance Centre, and then enjoy a beautiful dinner in one of the restaurants around Southbank Parklands. Its a must-do!"
76,Close to the CBD,"Great to see this wonderful facility fully utilised by the people of Brisbane and tourists alike. Plenty of spaces to rest and relax, cool pools, restaurants and eateries..if anything just need to remember to keep the toilets a bit cleaner."
77,Free resource,"An oasis in the midst of a bustling thriving city! It was pretty packed when I was there, but that didn't prevent me from taking a refreshing dip in the cool, clear, aquamarine water. Parking is expensive. Best to Uber it. Lots of cool restaurants and cafes, and small markets to browse. A lovely day out. Returning again soon."
78,Streets Beach Brisbane,"We spent a day here exploring the park. A great escape from the city. Beautiful landscaping, green everywhere. Great for all ages. Large ferris wheel, looks like you could see the whole city from the top. There is a man made sand beach with a sand bottom pool along with a typical pool. Both with lifeguards. Plenty of spots to grab a snack or drink. The park is located right along the Brisbane river. Truly a gem."

80,Great facilities ,I had great day strolling around Southbank before and after a show at the Lyric Theatre. Caught the City Hopper from Eagle St Pier to Southbank and wondered through the market and a festival that was on at the time. The Bouganvilea was in flower that covers the arched walkway and it was so beautiful. the gardens were so lush and green at the time and it was a lovely sunny day. lots of families were about enjoying the bike ways and picnic areas and festival. After our musical at the Lyric Theatre we walked back to the Emporium Hotel overlooking Southbank and the River and had a cocktail the rooftop bar and took in the beautiful city and river lights

115,river walk between two pedestrian bridges,We had heard about the South Bank Park land so decided it was worth a visit.  We weren't prepared for how big the man made beach area is.  Lots of people were taking advantage of the beaches and pools.  It is a very welcome area as only place that is available outside for public to swim and provides areas for all members of the family.
116,"Nice leisure area, take your swimming gear.","Impressed with the facilities and sorrounding restaurants and bars, pool, chairs, picnic BBQ spots, evening ambience as and lighting, good to stroll around and settle in one bar!"
117,Lovely walking path,South Bank Parklands offer excellent attractions from the huge man-made lagoon with its own sandy beach to gorgeous boardwalks through lovely tropical green lush gardens. The best way to get there is either walk through the Botanical Gardens from the CBD or catch the free city hopper ferry which runs regularly every 20 minutes from Eagle Street Pier to Southbank.
118,A good park with different entertainment facilities in the city heart,"One of my favourite places in Brisbane is South Bank, Grey St & Little Stanley St will definitely be a great day out for you and your family.Huge pool that attracts hundreds or people during the holidays and so many places to eat whether it's a restaurant, confectionery, ice cream and drinking.There is an outstanding lolly shop for the whole family with lots of American stuff in that you probably haven't seen before, they come up with some crazy stuff.Also a NZ Natural ice cream and sorbet place near a Subway.Bavarian Brauhaus if you want some pub grub and beers.A couple of my favourite restaurant there include Yellowfin Seafood and grill, Ahmet's & Harajuku Gyoza."

121,Just nice,"Crossing over the pedestrian Kurilpa Bridge to the South Bank I walked past several cultural institutions to the Parklands area, always with great views over the river to the CBD with its skyscrapers. En route I saw the Ferris Wheel, the Nepalese Peace Pagoda with its intricate woodcarvings and the Streets Beach with swimming pools and sandy beaches.It was a beautiful sunny day and a lot of people seemed to have a great time, also at the many restaurants, bars and cafés. I don't remember having seen a similiar set up, especially with the beaches, anywhere so close to a city center. For nature lovers there is a small rainforest left and I saw quite a few - for an European - interesting birds. Back to the northside I went over the also pedestrian Goodwill Bridge."
122,Fantastic,Lovely spot for a walk along the river with the forest area and the amazing beach and water play.  Well maintained and the arbor walk is wonderful. Walking under the shade on a very hot day was quite pleasant.  Can't wait to return with my family to spend the day splashing away.  Highly recommend a visit.
123,Free and Safe Family Entertainment,"Following a lunchtime function at QPAC we decided to just wonder around and enjoy our city from Southbank. It was wonderful to sit for a while to observe the river traffic as well as the pedestrian traffic and finish with bite to eat in Grey Street. So beautiful, we love this city."

There was some live music being played in a bar not far from where we were sitting which was nice. There are plenty of food and drink options for all budgets around the the area.

We live in Cairns, which is beautiful, but can I just say that this area in Brisbane, the parks, walkways and river are just gorgeous.  The lagoon pool is well set out for all ages, with lovely sitting areas.  It is right on the Brisbane River overlooking the City.  There are amenities, restaurants and bars all around this area.

149,Great beach for a swim and relaxation,"Made a last minute visit to South Bank & had a great time. Parking limited in the area, so had to pay for parking. $20 for almost 3hrs wasn’t too bad, considering. Christmas markets were on. The chlorine smell from the pool was a bit strong (but understandable). Beautiful night & ambience for a stroll through the parklands."

There are beautiful walks and bikeways, swimming at ‘the beach’, playgrounds for kids, cafes, picnic areas, Sunday markets etc. it is close to several excellent restaurants, near to the CPD, Museum, Science Museum, Art Gallery and the Performance Theatre. No matter what time of the year Or day, Southbank is worth a visit and has something for everyone. You can make a day of it or just spend a short time there but you will enjoy what it has to offer you."
151,Fun and relaxing,We went into the city for visit and stopped in at the man made beach .. it’s enjoyable just to sit there and watch everyone run in and out of the water. I had packed a picnic for us as the food around is pretty expensive. It is nice when the sun is out but it is normally full of people. It’s worth a visit! Enjoy!

194,Beautiful spot,"During our 2 wk holiday in Brisbane from Cairns we spend a considerable amount of time exploring South Bank Area, some new construction work going on & unfortunately the Brisbane Channel 7 Wheel wasn't operating.

196,Love the atmosphere,"Great place to pick up some handicrafts, art and clothing at the markets - Friday to Sunday. Multiple bars, restaurants and cafes. The parklands are lovely to walk around, perfect place to bring a picnic and watch the life of the river. Check out the kitchen garden to the east and the Tibetan temple to the western side. One of the best things is the man made beach and free form pools - there is also a water park for littlies. There are toilets, showers and lockers available. The large Ferris wheel is to the west. Also walking distance to the art galleries and museums. Just be warned that parking is expensive but if you park in the Arts Precinct to the western side it is cheaper at $17 per day. Better yet catch the train, citycat, free city hopper or an Uber"
197,Great location,Guess the government are using this Covid-19 time to to a lot of renovations but it certainly does spoil the look of the parklands atm. Quite disappointed. Such a lot of the area is closed and noisy with machinery.Luckily the view over the city from the parklands is still nice.I will be waiting at least 6 months before making a special trip here again.
198,Love the South Bank!,We were here midweek and therefore it was not too busy. It is a very enjoyable place to visit and the restaurants offer a variety of foods. Would visit again
199,SOUTHBANK Brisbane great family place,We took the 3 kids to the beach at Southbank. The pool is great it has a sandy beach sloping down to 1.8m deep in parts. There is lots of different pool areas but I liked the sandy bit the best. There are life guards around but supervising your kids is a must. The bathrooms near the pools were filthy so come with thongs. The toilets near the rock pond bit were the cleanest.
200,Beach man made,This area is very nice and is still undergoing an upgrade to make it better. The swimming pools are great for a swim on a hot day. Plenty of cafes and food available as well plus places to sit along the river.

It’s FREE! There are public restrooms steps away that give you a free space to change, plus lockers available for rent. It is easy to spend an entire day here, enjoying the public amenities and pool while having quick access to restrooms, lunch spots, and ice cream trucks. Overall I give Streets Beach Five Stars out of Five. It’s a MUST VISIT."
204,Beautiful Place to Meander,Southbank is perfect for a cheap day out where you can cook a bbq or take a picnic and watch the river action. Great for a swim or check out.There are some fabulous cafes and restaurants as well

Southbank offers free BBQ facilities, swimming, adventure playgrounds, city views, boardwalks, epicure gardens, entertainment and more. The weekend markets offer a great variety of local arts and crafts for sale. If you want to spend some money the selection of restaurants, fast food or pub style meals is great. The hardest thing you’ll have to do all day is make a decision on what to eat, where to stroll or sit and how long you’ll swim at the beach while admiring the city views."
210,Surprisingly good,"We spent 3 days in Brisbane and each day we spent some time in the South Bank Parklands. The parklands are beautiful and well looked after. We enjoyed swimming in the pools,  the great park for children, walking around, eating at near by restaurants, shopping in the little market and going on the free boat that goes up the river from the parklands. The parklands are a short walk from the museum, art galleries and the State library.... all wonderful to go to with children. Definitely recommend taking children of all ages here."
