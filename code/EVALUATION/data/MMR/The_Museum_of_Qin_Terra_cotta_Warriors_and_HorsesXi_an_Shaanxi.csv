0,Awe inspiring,The most amazing thing I've ever seen.  Incredible history and we were able to get fairly close and we had the first hour here to ourselves.
1,Spectacular,"I visited the terracotta warriors on a group trip and is was amazing. I had not realised the scale of the  exhibition and learning about it was fascinating. We were able to just look around but many groups were having tour guides explain more in detail about the history.It was very busy when we went at around lunch time. I would recommend trying to go at the beginning of the day as i imagine it is quieter then.A definite must see if in the area, but be prepared for the crowds"
2,Horrible Experience! Never again!!,"DO NOT GO HERE! Just skip it! I went on 8/15 and I had a horrible experience. I have a green health QR code but because I’m a foreigner they took me out of line and and wrote down my passport number. Basess discrimination. I had to buy a physical ticket because I’m not Chinese. A ticket that you can ONLY buy with cash. No one uses cash. I needed to ask 5 people to give me 100 RMB Cash and give them WeChat pay in exchange. No one was social distancing, not everyone was wearing masks and Covid is still a very real problem here. It was a mess. You walk from 1 ticket check to another ticket check 500 meters away. Because in your 500 meters somehow your admission into the place must be called into question. You walk more into this big building. Take 1 picture and leave. This whole process takes 90 mins for 1 picture of the warriors. Just horrible! . Also to make matters worse it was 100 degrees and I had two younger children with me.What made it even worse was the fact someone shoved my wife and she almost fell down the stairs. Never never never again! This is 100% factual!"
3,Impressive collection but VERY touristy.,"Visited the warriors and we were not disappointed. We had our own guide, arranged beforehand and was able to learn so much. Living in  china has enabled to see so many things we thought we’d never see including these. The main pit is humongous and the warriors all lined up is amazing! Pure sight of awe. Looking at the others are interesting too, including the bronze statues and the different warriors in the glass display cabinets. Best fact- every SINGLE one has different facial features. No two are the same. Amazing"
4,Awesome Visit with Tour Guide,"Visited August 2017:One of the greatest archeological discoveries of modern time. An extraordinary underground treasure, an entire army of life size terrain cotta soldiers and horses interred for more than 2,000 years. A must see!"
5,Amazing bucket list trip,"My wife has wanted to see the Warriors since she heard about them 20 years ago! It was well worth the wait! We would recommend getting a tour guide while you have questions and they wait outside the ticket office. We found a great one in Emily who spoke excellent English and has been giving tours for 16 years!If you are a foreigner make sure to scan in for health code and have your passport ready. There are separate lines for foreigners in the ticket office and as far as I can tell foreigners cannot book tickets online. Ticket cost is 120 RMB and you can negotiate a tour guide for 300-400 RMB (do keep in mind that tour guides have to buy a 120 RMB ticket as well).To get here you can take a Didi for 100 RMB/car from the city or metro/bus for 10 RMB/per person. For public transport get to Fangzhicheng metro station, take exit A, turn right when you reach the road and walk 100 m to the bus stop to take 306 out there.Remember to bring cash with you. The terracotta museum and bus only take cash. The bus will only accept small bills (10-20). It is also easier to give the tour guides cash for their services. We would recommend to avoid mid to late day as it can get very busy. The beginning of the day for our friends seemed to be less crowded."
6,Must do list,"We visited as part of an organised tour.It’s a large site and takes roughly 2 hours to explore.The Warriors are in three different covered pits where ongoing archaeological digs can be seen.Have your breath taken  away at the sheer number of warriors (more than 6000) all with different faces, which were buried with the first Emperor of China, and unearthed in 1974.It gets very busy, you just need to be patient to wait until you get to the front.  There are so many warriors there is always plenty of opportunity for “that great picture”."
7,Highlight of our Xi'an trip,Took a taxi to the Park and selected a guide at the Museum.  Best to get a guide and he saved us lot of time and seen the impostant locations.
8,The guardians of the first emperor of China,"This is probably the main attraction in Xian.  We took a bus from the railway station. had to queue up with lots of people but buses move as soon as it was full.  Had to pay 120 yuan per person, but free for seniors 65 years and above.  Quite interesting to see the various excavation sites and the terra cotta warriors.  Very crowded with tourists and need to jostle for space to take photos.  Lots of walking and outside sun is hot when walking between buildings. Bring hat and water. Wear comfortable shoes. Need a day trip to visit here."
9,A Must Visit When in Xian,"It's a once in a lifetime trip but the jostling is unbearable. We had a lovely guide who helped us navigate. My recommendation to a Western person, is that you should have a guide"
10,Very impressive,My husband and I were in awe of the immense size of the Terracotta Warriors pits!  The history of these figures is fascinating.  And no two faces are alike!
11,First Time Visitor,"Quite a sight, row upon row of warriors. An unique experience. There is a theater that has a video presentation of the story behind the warriors. Well worth seeing. We were unaware that almost all of the figures were smashed by later emperors. I think only one was left intact. This is a massive task to put the pieces  back together.  Like a giant jig-saw puzzle. The only think that detracted from the visit was the crowds. Our guide said we were there on a slow day. Lots of pushing and shoving that made it hard to get good photos."
12,A Must See Museum in Xian,"Very crowded when we visited, not organised at all , very rude and pushy people,   BUT it was a public holiday so expected I guess.  Well wortht it though what an amazing site,  one visit takes it all in."
13,Main attraction in Xian,"Imagine standing in a large shed that can fit 3 A380s side by side. Then, imagine the jets are replaced by Emperor Qin’s terra-cotta army facing you. Archers, soldiers, generals, chariots and all facial expressions and features  of each soldier are muddled Ina actually soldier in Qin’s Army. That’s the daunting reality of the Terra-cotta Army!"
14,Meeting with the army of Emperor Qin,"Awe-inspiring— how much work went into creating and later unearthing these figures.  Most impressive:  each figure’s face is unique.  It somehow personalizes the whole thing.  Displays and history write ups are good. We hired a guide - highly recommend that.  Tip:  want to buy a replica note that they have expensive ones in the shop, not so expensive out in the marketplace.  They seem comparable- unless you want one larger than 6” in which case you should probably splurge and buy it from the museum shop."
15,Awesome but full of people,"The Terracotta Army museum certainly lived up to our expectations. You queue patiently through security, and then for a ticket, and then to enter the exhibition, and then to view the statues - all the time swept along in an organic seething tide of humanity. I believe my wife’s feet were actually off the ground for a lot of the time! If you haven’t shuffled and jostled surrounded by ten thousand Chinese then you don’t know what the word “crowd” really means. The quantity and extent of the statues is staggering. But if you want photos it helps to be tall and pushy … or else google them later."
16,Amazing site!,"Loved the warriors, especially the individual hairstyles and faces! All the family enjoyed our visit."
17,Terracotta Warriors ,"Awesome experience but full of people. Different chambers with. Some of them were very big. Yet being old, some statues were really well restored."
18,One of the many must-see experiences of China,"Obviously a very impressive place. The sheer scale of the Terracotta Army can only be appreciated with a visit. This is a treasure of Chinese culture. However, the place is enormous and the number of people is really oppressing. The whole thing is very commercialised and there is clearly nothing authentic about it anymore. While this is obviously worth a visit, one should not expect a romantic travel back in time but more of a industrialised tourist experience."
19,Unbelieveable!,"To get to see one of China's most iconic sights you'll need to head to the city of Xi' An and get a bus from there which will drop you off not too far from the museum, make sure to bring enough of the local currency with you and also make sure you come at a time when the whole country isn't on holiday as well since you'll be waiting in long lines for hours otherwise. The museum is divided into several buildings, each showcasing different parts of the terracotta army, some will be statues riding on chariots and then you'll arrive at the main building which houses the huge Terracotta army itself, although some are missing heads and hands. There are tour guides who will show you around but I didn't pay for one since I already knew enough about the army and didn't want to pay anymore money. If you do arrive on a busy day then you'll just need to move with the crowd, try to ease your way through the hundreds of people and when you finish, don't waste anymore time, head back to the buses or you could be waiting hours to get back to your hotel. You'll also likely be one of the few westerners there so people will likely stare at you, bringing friends along may help with that, but you'll also need to get a train to Xi'an which may last a whole day or you can catch a flight. While this is an iconic sight, it does come with its difficulties but it is worth it since this is a part of Chinese history which has survived for thousands of years."
20,What a discovery in 1974.... Fantastic sight.... A must see....,"This is definitely a must see attraction. In fact, it is worth one’s while to just make a trip to Xi’an to see this UNESCO world heritage site.The warriors are so life like that you can imagine the amount of effort that went into making them centuries ago. There are 3 halls housing the warriors. Hall 1 is the largest and is the most excavated so far. Hall 3 is perceived to be the HQ and only housed about 70 warriors. Hall 2 is the one where fully restored senior official, middle official, kneeling and standing archers are placed inside glass containers for closer view.The site is a good 40-50 km from downtown Xi’an. While locals can purchase their tickets online, this option is not available to foreigners. You will need to bring your passport as that is needed at point of purchase. Adult tickets are priced at 120rmb. If you need a guide, there are unofficial ones soliciting business at the entrance as local authorities do not allow them to operate due to COVID-19 concerns. Rates are about 250-300 rmb (including price for their ticket)."
21,Day Trip,Took the public transport which consists of a train ride and a bus ride. It takes around one hour or so to get there by public transport. It can get crowded at times because there is so many people heading to this place. So I recommend to go there early. Many open pits for you to see the terracotta warriors.
22,Seeing is believing,No visit to Xian is complete without visiting this famed world heritage site from the Qin dynasty built for the Qin Emperor (Qin Shi Huang). Take approx. 1-2 hours to visit this place.
23,Impressive “ghost” battalions,"This site of clay soldiers built in the Qin Dynasty in 770 BC to 206 BC. It was set on fire during a battle between two kingdoms for power and not discovered until 1974 by a local farmer. It did not open to the public until 1979. We saw it in October 2019, 40 years later. What progress they have made. The terracotta soldiers were made to protect the emperor. A must see exhibit in 3 buildings."
24,"Amazing, but SO crowded","A collection of several thousand life-size figures, made of terracotta (burnt clay), depicting soldiers, officers and horses found in the tomb of the first Chinese emperor Qin Shi. During the funeral of the emperor in 210 BCE the whole army was also placed in underground rooms. The most important point of the entire complex of buildings that make up the mausoleum is the hill, under which the burial chambers surrounded by the underground defensive wall were placed. According to beliefs, the Terracotta Army was to protect the emperor and help him regain power in the afterlife. Sculptures of soldiers have individualized features, initially all figures were painted in bright red, blue, pink and gold [2]. The colors remained until they were discovered in 1974, however, under the influence of air, the colors began to gradually fade.

The downside of this place is the large number of tourists, which is crowded."
