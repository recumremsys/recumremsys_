0,A great place for a picnic lunch,A beautiful place to have a picnic lunch! Sadly the swimming hole was closed so we could not swim. Apparently the levels were too low so there was a concern about bacteria.
1,AMAZING ! ,"A beautiful spot and we enjoyed a short walk, but as we are in wet season it was closed to swimming.....wished we had known that before we left Darwin.  However it is a beautiful spot but apparently in wet season the crocs may be in the water and the rock pools are closed off."
2,So beautiful fof a day teip,This is a great place to have a swim then enjoy a picnic/barbecue. It’s very warm but lots of grassy areas under the shade. The water is absolutely beautiful and picturesque.
3,great oasis for a swim,This was a beautiful place to go for a swim; there were lots of people but swimming hole was large enough to accommodate all. good carpark & toilet facilities
4,Best place to swim on a hot day,"The Berry Springs Nature Park has a beautiful pool but unfortunately the day I was there, the pool was closed due to a croc being seen there the day before. A shame as I would have stayed there."
5,Excellent waterhole swimming.,It’s lovely just a shame everyone brings their noodles! I felt very safe swimming there. An easy drive from Darwin.
6,Very Clean and beautiful,Such a beautiful and relaxing place to swim with plenty of swimming holes to choose from and grassed areas for lunches/picnics
7,Beautiful place,This is a lovely place for a swim but does get very crowded You can take the family here an spend the day there n have a pick nick lunch There are 3 swimming areas that are all linked up so you can swim from 1 to another It is a bit of a drive out of Darwin tho  but if you have the time an like swimming it’s well worth it
8,Clean and refreshing,"We had a great day travelling through Litchfield Park with our final stop being Berry Springs Pools. Great swimming hole, beautiful parklands well serviced by Rangers."
9,Closed for swimming in the wet,"A beautiful place to swim in crystal clear waters, very relaxing, would have went there everyday if we had time. We also feed the Archer fish & it was fascinating to watch them squirt us to get the food. I loved the sign at the front “If the car park is full, Berry Springs is crowded, please come back later”. Very Aussie. There were picnic tables, a kiosk & amenities."
10,It was closed to swimming,This was by far the best place for children and adults to use the water. The surrounds are beautiful and tons of room for BBQs and picnics. Must see place
11,A piece of paradise,Visited yesterday. After doing the Territory Wildlife Park  it was good to have a nice refreshing swim. We started at the top pool and worked our way to the bottom pool. Well worth the visit and it was free.
12,Good spot,"Enjoyed our visit here after travelling through Litchfield national park.  Was disappointed that we couldn’t swim as their was a sign advising against it, due to the water temperature and possible illness if you went swimming, which we didn’t want on a holiday.   The best bbq area and large spaces.  Would love to camp there"
13,Relaxing spot for the afternoon ,We had a lovely day here! It was a Saturday but wasn’t too crowded. The water was nice and warm and the facilities at the park are great. The kiosk is very reasonably priced and highly recommended to hire or buy pool noodles for the kids as the majority of the water is way too deep even for adults to stand in. Lots of BBQs there to use and heaps of shade too.
14,Very disappointing,"this is a beautiful spot for a swim the top pool has a small waterfall that you can go in behind and then just sit with the water flowing down over the top of you this is very relaxing, this area is quite shallow. the main pool is very deep so it is great for a good swim. the bottom pool we didn't swim in as it looked a little murky. They all have steps into the water for easy access. Only about half hour drive from Darwin. Toilets and picnic areas in lush green park."
15,A nice dip in the Spring,We really enjoyed Berry Springs Nature Park. A lovely cool place to relax on a hot day. I enjoyed a swim in the lower pool which was less crowded than the others. Just lovely! Change facilities are provided. Lots of picnic tables and a small kiosk. Carpark almost full when we arrived! Well worth the visit! We then stayed overnight at Batchelor ready to explore Litchfield National Park tomorrow!
16,nice place.....,This is the perfect place to cool off and chill out on a hot NT day! The swimming is perfect and we went on a weekday so it wasn’t overly busy! We’ve been twice and will definitely got back a 3rd time before leaving Darwin!
17,Hidden gem,This natural spring is an ideal place to spend a few hours having a swim and a picnic.  Great for all the family.  Check before going as it is a little way out of Darwin and sometimes closed.
18,Great place for a picnic and swim,"We had a great swim here, from the waterfall back massage, to swim around the deeper pools, this spring had a lot to offer. BBQ and picnic tables and a handy bathroom nearby"
19,Nice ,"We liked this place for a swim.. Quiet and nature, Good for a swim. Also great pick nick place and a short hike."
20,Nice place,This was a very nice place to have a walk around. They have animals so it is nice for children to see. You can also go in the water in a few places.
21,Nice reprieve from the heat.,What a perfect spot! Crystal clear water. A noodle is a good idea to help float as water is quite deep
22,A no croc wallow in the hallow. ,"We visited Berry Springs on our first day in the Darwin area and really enjoyed it.  Lovely warm water to swim in, felt very safe.  Very laid-back atmosphere."
23,Fresh water springs picnic with a difference,"This is a beautiful nature park, we have visited it a couple of times, unfortunately this last time no swimming was allowed due to a 3 meter croc being sighted over the previous couple of days.The water is so clear & full of fish & really refreshing to swim in. There’s a lovely waterfall at one end & two other pools.The park has bbq facilities & very clean toilets & best of all it’s free.Definitely worth a visit."
24,Nothing out of the ordinary,Loved our half day at Berry Springs. Was a very hot day so relaxing the fresh waters was bliss. Glad we took our goggles as many fish to see. A great spot to take a picnic lunch.
25,Beautiful part of Australia,Absolute must to visit when in Darwin.The water is fresh and warm perfect for a dip.So absolutely refreshing and gorgeous happy to give this a 9/10
26,Gorgeous place ,"I had the privilege of visiting here on my Litchfield Tour with Ethical Adventures. What a fabulous spot! We swam in the thermal pools and saw amazing little fish. I wish I had brought my water shoes, the bottom was mainly little rocks and a bit slippery in spots. I loved the untouched feel to this little bit of heaven! Our guide told us that it fills up by lunchtime as there are many picnic spots. There are change rooms and bathrooms nearby. If I lived in Darwin, this would be a regular picnic spot."
27,Wow,Berry Springs is beautiful. Lovely warm water for swimming and just an idyllic spot. Not far away is the Crazy Mango place where you can buy Mango cheesecake and ice cream which is very delicious.
28,Nicely kept park.,"I was told by a lot of locals This place was nice. We arrived found a little waterfall, but there’s a warning about swimming here that it may cause gastro bug and ear infections. We looked at the lagoons and they didn’t look to inviting, but they must need rain to flush them out as the photos the water is clear. Also beware they may close because sometimes crocs get in."
29,Visit a nice relaxing soak to cool down.,This is a beautiful spot.The water was crystal clear with plenty of room for everyone. We were there fairly early so the crowds hadn't built up. The pathways down to the several entances to the water were well kept and clean as were the toilets.  I would highly recommend a topo here.
30,Average,Was well worth the trip from Darwin for a swim in the fresh water - I was happy to go in as I could see the bottom. Our visit coincided with a ranger talk and we got to hold a crocodile and learn how they keep the springs safe for swimmers.
31,Get there early!,Beautiful place to visit for picnic lunch and swim. The scenery is stunning. A few swimming holes to choose from. Great grassy area and tables for lunch. Worth a visit.
32,Amazing,"Drive out to berry spring for a relaxing swim and picnic with the family, they have great facilities and water is flowing. Check on the website before you leave as sometimes the place is closed"
33,Great park,"What a beautiful spot. Great for all ages. Very pretty and good facilities. Grass area to sit and have lunch. Take a noodle, fun to float down the river."
34,Very good ,We walked along the rainforest trail then had a picnic lunch and a swim (wallow) in the stream. Wasn’t busy and lots of different swimming holes to explore.
35,Crocwise talk - Sunday at 11am,"Despite that we had a quick walk around and sat down at the picnic tables for lunch. Plenty of facilities, rubbish bins, tables, toilets. Only 5 people there other than us during the wet, although it is not wet yet."
36,Great nature park,lovely spot for walking and swimming .Near the wild life park so you could go to both in one day.they are both well worth it
37,Teddy Bears picnic,Had a great time here last Saturday. Beautiful water to swim in and small waterfall to go under. Great facilities and nice kiosk with yummy homemade ice-cream.
38,Amazing!  Water so clear and warm,Beautiful spot at berry springs and one of the highlights of our trip. Easy access and lovely to float down the pools. The cave behind the little waterfall was a touch of adventure for the kids too. We were there in the late afternoon on a weekday and it was quiet but i imagine it would get very busy at times.   Only downer was the kiosk staff who were abrupt and almost rude to several people while we were there.
39,Close to home,"Went for a day trip from Darwin, very warm day so good for a swim and look around! Very refreshing! Lovely setting! Met some lovely people there to chat to as well! The falls are great to sit under very shallow so quite safe. Further down around river corner is deeper! Safe no crocs! Would recommend!"
40,Swimming hole,A fantastic place to visit and cool off. There are a number of natural swimming holes  to choose from with variable depth. Take a pool noodle to help relax your swimming. $6 at the kiosk  or $2-3 from woolies. The grounds are well maintained with many BBQ s.The water is not as clear as the natural plunge pools in Litchfield NP.
41,clean and well looked after,"From Darwin we took only half an hour to discover this natural parkland with great swimming holes for the family to enjoy. There are many suitable areas for a family picnic and is an ideal spot to spend a number of hours relaxing, swimming in warmish water and playing with the kids. A kiosk was shut when we arrived at 10:30 but was open about an hour later where you could hire or buy floating materials and light refreshments."
42,Beautiful Place,This place is a “must see” & “must swim”. Buy some “noodles” for floating & reef shoes before leaving Darwin. Berry Springs is a magical place where you can migrate from one spot to another along the creek. The spring water ponds varying in size & depth & are easily accessible from the car park as paths have been created.
43,A must visit,"We are staying at Tumbling Waters Park and went up to Berry Springs nature park for the crocwise talk. Sooo interesting, kids got to hold baby freahwater crocodiles and a snake. The rangers were so generous with their time and knowledge."
44,Swimming,"This place is amazing! Wow factor is so high! As the sign says though “If the car park of full, berry springs is busy come back another time”. Love it will be back tomorrow for a swim!"
45,Great place for a swim,"Perfect for a day out with the family or friends swimming & relaxing, picnic benches and BBQ areas, always lovely and clean and well maintained, with a small kiosk for essentials, right across from a great tavern selling great family food & the wildlife park!"
46,Swimming fun,Nice fun spot for a picnic.  Loved the Crazy Acres Mango Icy Poles Yummy.  A good spot for locals to all get together not too far from Darwin.
47,Stunning place for a safe swin,"The waterfall in the pic above was the best spot for me.  There is also a main pool and lower pool where you can swim.  There is a small kiosk where you can buy snacks, ices etc.  On the road from Darwin you will see some enormous termite mounds."
48,"Fantastic safe place to swim, absolutely loved it and all for free!!!!!","We found this place absolutely relaxing. The views are amazing and the park has plenty of amazing facilities (bbq, toilets, showers etcc...) all in pristine condition what a pleasure. Will come again for sure"
49,Great spot for a picnic and swim,Lovely clear and warm water. a great place for a swim and photos your friends will love. Close to Darwin so worth the short drive to enjoy nature.
50,Nice spot,"This is a great place to enjoy a good swim close to darwin. The water here is warmer than a lot of the NT gorges and you can move from one hole to the next by swimming the shallow creek.   Plenty of bbqs and large picnic areas with toilets.   Well worth the trip,  would be crowded on weekends."
51,Great natural spring just out of Darwin city. Great to cool off,The pools here are cool and inviting - bring a noodle and float your cares away in the 3 areas of swimming.
52,Great day out,"A beautiful spot so close top Darwin, Would recommend this as a beautiful place to spend the day relaxing. Wide open areas to rest and a couple of pleasant swim holes."
53,Simply stunning,This  is a magnificent spot to visit and depending on the season great for a dip or a lazy float on a tube.  Pack a picnic and enjoy the visit!  Please make sure you read all signage in regard to crocodiles as rangers do regular checks and warnings of sightings so bear that in mind!
54,Over Crowded,A great opportunity to swim in the natural springs of this beautiful country. Cool and refreshing on a hot day with 2 large ponds and creek with waterfalls. Worth the drive from Darwin
55,Lovely for a swim,We have had four visits to Berry Springs during our holiday.  Three waterholes that you can either swim down or use the clearly marked paths.  We preferred the lowest pool.  Noodles are a must.  Has both been very noisy and also quiet.  Just to be in the water supported by a noodle has been wonderful.
56,Bliss,We travelled here when it was extremely hot so it was ideal as not too far to walk from the carpark. Some lovely shaded areas and picnic spots so nice to get some  places to cool down and the lovely pools and waterfall make it an ideal place for family days out. Very clean and not too overcrowded.
57,Great place!,Relaxed place that is perfect for a swim on a hot darwin day. Good facilities and parking and is pretty popular for tourists and locals :)
58,Beautiful swimming in natural area. ,We started at the top and made our way done the creek to the swimming pond. It was a gorgeous sunny day but there was enough shade for sun protection. A large lizard came done the bank and slipped into the springs. That was pretty exciting. Local people didn’t batt an eye but this mature woman from Dunedin NZ might have squealed a bit in surprise. Clean enough changing rooms and toilets. Clear information upon entry. This is a free adventure.
59,Beautiful natural swimming hole,Crystal clear water. Different spots to swim but all joined. Different depths too. Fantastic to spot fish in some areas. Take a mask to get a good look but you can easily see them just looking down. Lovely parkland with picnic tables and small kiosk with ice creams and pool noodles for sale or hire. Some areas are very deep so pool noodle great if not a strong swimmer.
60,If you want to cool down after a day at Litchfield Nat Park,We called in to Berry Springs as the park has just reopened after the wet season. Our first time there did not disappoint. There are great sized swimming areas for people to enjoy with ladders to easily move in and out of the water (the ladder down the lower pool could be quite slippery). There are large areas to have a picnic or BBQ.
61,Beautiful warm springs,"Berry springs is a little paradise on a hot day. There are the actual berry spring, a main pool and a lower pool. The spring is probably more suitable for younger children as the water is a little shallower than the main pool and lower pool. There are heaps of fish in the water and they spit water at people which is fun!  My children loved this place!"
62,Great swimming hole,"Lots of people were there but did not feel crowded at all. A great place for gatherings, clean, BBQs provided, suits families and friends"
63,Quick stop for swim,"An awesome natural waterhole that is perfect to spend an afternoon relaxing. I only mark this attraction down one star for the yobs who smoke and/or play obnoxiously loud music in the otherwise tranquil natural settings. I didn't, but should have taken goggles to enjoy swimming around and admiring the many fish."
64,Very picturesque,Unfortunately we were there in the dry season and there wasn't very much water flowing through the ponds but I would recommend going there after the wet season and take your Bushmans Insect Spray as the bush flys can really bit hard.
65,You’ll be back!,Best place to swim. Def worth a visit - waters are crystal clear and a little swimming kiosk at the front for purchase.Great place to stop and stretch the legs
66,Great place,Beautiful little water fall to visit and plenty of room to swim. You need to get there early to get a park as it was filled up by lunch time. The down side is people not moving out the way when you want to take a pic of the water fall. Wasn’t asking much there was only the 2 of them in there but they just didn’t care where has all the polite people gone.
67,Beautiful Berry Springs,"A very relaxed swimming area in the dry season, recommend you take a picnic basked and some drinks and settle there for a few hours"
68,Top End trip,"Great temperature difference when you get there , shaded really well Good spot for a BBQ/ picnic Water spots quite crowded and there was a sign that there were bugs in the water that could cause gastro or ear infections I didn't swim because of this though plenty of people didKiosk had a great selection of gourmet ice cream and I had a frozen banana dipped in chocolate - delish"
69,Berry Nice!,"This is a lovely place, plenty of shaded picnic areas, and quite a few people swimming in the rock pools. Also a lovely friendly woman in the kiosk"
70,AMAZING place to spend the day! (Must visit),"A truly beautiful place so relaxing just floating down the stream, enjoying our amazing country, it was our first trip to NT will be going back & highly recommending to family & freinds thank you Darwin"
71,Absolutely stunning!,Nice little place to visit and go for a swim even take a picnic lunch and have lunch there just remember this place gets very busy so if you can put up with the crowds it’s the place to go to
72,Excellent Stopover,"An excellent, shaded place to swim for all ages. Staff located my lost wallet and went to extreme lengths to contact me and ensure I received. Would highly recommend for anyone travelling around the Top End. One of the nicest swimming holes NT has to offer."
73,A trip to Berry Springs after more than 30 years!,We went there one day for a swim on the way home from Dundee Beach and it was lovely and had 3 levels of swimming and had plenty of picnic areas for people to spreadout and relax and have a bbq or a picnic well worth going there
74,Very nice,Just loved this place for a beautiful refreshing swim. Lovely bushland to walk through to the waterholes and little waterfalls. Well worth the visit.
75,Great spot,… it turned out to be a big surprise.  What a lovely place well maintained with excellent amenities.  The water temp here is not as cold as the many other rock holes.  So make the most of it.  Bring along a picnic and stay all day!
76,Stunning 😍,"Berry Springs is a fantastic family swimming area that is perfect in the dry season. The water temperature is just right and there are lots of different access points for people to get in and out of the water safely. There is car parking and picnic spaces, and on Sunday mornings there are wildlife talks about crocodiles. The best part is that it is all free."
77,Wonderful way to spend a day,"I live close to Berry Springs and its a beautiful place to go for a swim, has a kiosk, toilets, etc.  In the old days it used to be known as ""dead mans hole"" because of a crocodile that would eat anyone who went swimming in there . . . ."
78,40mins out of darwin,A great park to visit plenty of seating and 'BBQs Easy access to water which is nice and warm. Crystal clear pools with some large fish. Do not miss.
79,Very professional showcase of the local wildlife,"This water hole is not too far away from Darwin and it was very popular when we were there on a Sunday. So much so that a sign at the entrance says if the car park is full try another time (or words to that effect). Well shaded, good amenities and just generally a nice place to go and have a swim. I would return....."
80,Great spot for a dip,Had an amazing morning at the springs!  Water crystal clear and a beautiful temperature.  Easy access what else could you ask for
81,"Swimming amongst nature, can't beat it",Was too crowded when we got there. At the smaller pool. No place to buy food or drinks here as well. Would not really go out off place to do this. Probably a nice place for locals to chil. But clearly not one to be on the tourist map.
82,A great day in Litchfield National Park ,"What a beautiful place. Easy parking with a stroll down to a gorgeously pool. There were a few nerves with one eye on anything that moved but not enough to distract from the amazing surroundings. Quite easy to whittle away a few hours floating around, a nice escape from the heat. Watch out for the biting fish - they appear to love feet & legs ! It's a must do when in Darwin."
83,Great natural beauty close to Darwin.,"This was on our list, drove here and took swimmers, the springs are quite deep so take a noodle, lots of little fish. Unfortunately while here the lovely May flies were biting but other than that a lovely place to cool off."
84,Lovely ,Was a really beautiful place. And lovely to go for a swim. We went during middle of the week and mid afternoon so wasn't too busy. Would definitely go back again. Also an easy walk for those who have difficulty with walking distances .
85,Beautiful place to relax the afternoon away,"We visited on a typical wet season day - no swimming of course, as closed for the season, but the nature walk was enchanting in light rain. Beautiful light in the rainforest and a magnificent Banyan tree right in the middle.  It's a short circular walk of 1 kilometre, but good signposting for flora at least.  We saw an agile wallaby hop away as we entered the park, but no other wildlife on a wet day. We may have missed it, but more information about the birds and animals which live there would be great."
86,Cooling off in the waters,"Berry Springs is a local place for swimming. However, because you are unable to see the bottom crocodiles do get through. If the sign says don't swim, don't swim.  Crocodiles are all throughout the territory, and despite crocodile management, some do get away."
87,Lovely setting on warm day,"We had a wonderful swim at Berry Springs, only to hear that a   1.6m saltwater croc was caught in the same pool 2 days later! Ah the joys of top end travel!"
88,Beautiful swiiming hole,Beautiful place to visit and have a swim. Easy to get to and nice and peaceful surrounds. Scenery was magnificent and we all had a great time.
89,Spectacular,Hired a car for this short journey and what a treat. The water was amazing. Do not miss the mango pop from the kiosk.
90,Beautiful Place,"Paid a visit to this gorgeous free place in September. Not to busy and free to see. Three various rock pools to swim in, although I only swam in the small pool where I could see the bottom due to my fear of crocks. Bbq area, toilets and a little shop where you can purchase snacks etc. this place does have crock cages that are checked daily and is known for fresh water crocks so don’t be surprised if you see them in the pools. The water was warm and clear. I would suggest sand shoes that you can wear in the water to avoid the rocks, but a gorgeous place to visit."
91,Lovely,"Very nice natural location with inviting ponds to swim in. Kiosk for Noodle hire doesn't open until 11am, which was disappointing."
92,Awesome ,"There are 3 pools to swim in, all natural. The top pool has a waterfall but is quite small, the middle pool is larger and the water temperature is perfect. Take a picnic lunch or enjoy a bbq in the grounds."
93,Beautiful little spot ,This is lovely for a refreshing swim in lovely surroundings. Clean toilets and changing rooms. Concrete area and steps make it easy to get in and out. Lots of people but didnt feel crowded.
94,Refreshing,This spot has a warm water feed and plenty of areas for swimming.  Take goggles as there are plenty of fish to observe under the surface.
95,Beautiful spot,"This is a beautiful waterhole close to Darwin.  It has excellent bbq facilities, great shade and is just nice place to be.  Please remember this is a place for families....don't be an idiot and drink too much....take it easy and chill."
96,An amazing place! Don't miss it.,Went mid week so was much quieter than usual. Swimming holes and mini waterfall was so refreshing and clean. Great picnic area with electric bbq
97,Lovely spot and not too far to walk from car park.,"This is a true oasis, the temperature was 38c when we arrived and the spring was perfect. It's not a long way from Darwin and worth the time. It does get very busy but it's a great place."
98,Wished the Rangers Checked a Bit Closer ?,"Great area, lots of tables for a picnic lunch. Shade areas to fit under, toilets, kiosk that hires flotation devices if you require as well as basic foods and drinks. Water is lovely and a few different areas for you to swim in. 45 minutes from Darwin"
99,Fun in the sun,A beautiful setting to find respite from the heat. Plenty of small fish swimming about curiously watching our every move. We had a small child and felt safe with her. In fact she didn't want to leave.
100,Awesome spot,"Excellent swimming spot, try the mini cave behind the waterfall at the top pool.  Well tended grounds, swept for crocs regularly, take goggles and pool noodles - heaps of fish to follow around."
101,Much bigger & better than both Bitter Springs or Katherine Springs,"What a gorgeous idyllic place. Visited whilst in Darwin on holiday. The pools are warm, tropical and the area is well maintained. I would recommend to anyone visiting the far north."
102,Swimming in the top end,I can’t believe this is free!Beautiful spot just to float around in clean clear natural surroundings & watch the wildlife.  I’d go during the week if you can as it gets very busy on a weekend.  Don’t forget to take your noodle!
103,Relaxing Retreat,This was a great day out for relaxing and just walking around seeing the views. We loved the water fall.
104,It’s gorgeous!,"Lots of different swimming spots to choose from - very well maintained and the fresh ice creams and ice blocks were great (dairy, egg free options). TBH, swimming anywhere that has a sign making it clear that fresh water crocodiles inhabit the area is something way beyond my sensibilities - but the fact that the tour companies suggest swimming is ""low risk"" and there were lots of people swimming there seemed to make it ok - and we survived to tell the story! For the risk averse (like myself) it is hard to explain - somehow you know it is ok to swim there."
105,A great day out,An easy swimming getaway not that far from the city to go for a swim with friends and relax in nature
106,Fabulous Berry Springs,"Berry Springs is a hot spring with various pools you can swim and float in. Start at the warmest - at the top, where there is a waterfall to massage your shoulders or go behind it to hide from everyone. Float down the spring (better to bring noodles or pool floats, underneath beautiful greenery to the second pool. Spend hours here swimming and talking to people and then float down to the final pool, where you can jump off trees or use the rope to swing into the water. Areas for lunch and a small kiosk. Just don't float further down stream because there may be the rogue freshie - though they don't bother you if you don't bother them."
107,A little paradise 30 minutes outside of Darwin,"This was our second visit to Berry Springs so we knew to bring our $2 noodles that we purchased on Day 1 in Darwin. Berry Springs is warm enough to lounge around in for hours - hence the noodles (beats sitting on a submerged tree branch and gives you greater flexibility to float around the deeper parts of the pools).  There are a number of swimming options - shallow, waist height and who knows how far down it goes.  The best experience is in the deeper pools. You can buy noodles at the little cafe and possibly hire them as well but it is not cost effective, particularly if you are off to swim at Litchfield Park as well, where noodles are also a good way to stay in the water for longer. Bring a picnic lunch and something to sit on, and you could stay at the Springs all day. An easy 40 minute drive from the Darwin CBD means that you can go back two or even three times in a week to escape the heat and enjoy the beautiful natural surroundings here at the Springs. Make sure you investigate all of the pools."
108,Relief from the heat.,"Being less than an hour from Darwin, makes this an extremely popular spot for families. There are lots of picnic areas and shady trees. The kiosk hires pool noodles as well as selling them. food is reasonably priced there too. BBQ's are clean.The pools look rather inviting and there is a small waterfall. I found it disappointing that people took bottles of beer into the pools as if one breaks people can be injured especially as the rocks make it slippery. The main and lower pools were fairly packed."
109,Natures Bliss,"Short drive from Darwin. Floated down the creek from the rapids into the large swimming area. Water was warm and inviting with easy access in and out of the water via the steps and rails. Parklands surrounding the creek and pools was shady, spacious and  great for BBQ,S ecta"
110,Fantastic swimming holes,This is a beautiful place for young or old can go swimming laze around buy drinks ice creams all comfort facilities to.
111,Nature at its best,We spent hours at this beautiful place! The water is clear and a beautiful turquoise colour. They are warms springs so wonderful to get in and stay in! Great place for families and perfect place to pack some lunch and spend the afternoon. Will definitely be back!
112,Swimming hole,"This is a lovely area to go for a safe swim.  There is a very large area with shady trees and toilets where we had a picnic lunch.  Then down to the water for a cool off.  We had fun in the small pool with the waterfall - you can actually get behind the waterfall which is very cool.  There is another quiet pool above the falls, and you can swim through a creek to get to a larger water hole. The water was clean."
113,Great swimming holes ,"What a stunning gem, berry springs is!  Take a picnic, make sure you bring you’re swimming noodles, and you will have the best day.  Just beautiful ❤️"
114,Refreshing Swim,Berry Springs has lovely shady picnic areas and the swimming holes are easy to get to and a great way to cool off
115,Beautiful ,We travelled to Berry Springs from Darwin and arrived at 8am. We had the whole place to ourselves especially when swimming in the water. Had a great massage from the waterfall with its warm water flowing over your shoulders. Small fish swimming around to enjoy and please take some goggles.
116,An Oasis not far from Darwin,Relatively close to Darwin. Water was warmer than expected! Enjoyed our time relaxing here. Also went to nearby cafe (Crazy Acres) at a mango farm for lunch which was great!
117,Berry spring ,"with 3 large swimming holes ( all connected ) , plenty of shade , great picnic areas , steps in & out of the swim holes , & FREE entry - Berry Springs is one of the most enjoyable & the most affordable places to visit in the Top End. yes some fresh water crocs do get in here from time to time but during the springs open season the rangers do a thorough check each morning before opening the gates. we visited these springs many time & loved them."
118,Relaxing and refresing,There is a few pools to swim in and the water is warm.  There are a lot of areas to have a picnic with tables and BBQ's supplied.  Very nice place to spend a few hours.  There is a kiosk on site.  I would recommend a visit.
119,Best spot ever!,"Hot day,  relaxing swim,  lovely little kiosk. Perfect place to relax and have a peaceful swim. Lots of shade as well."
120,Relaxing & Beautiful,"A quick 45 minutes out of Darwin is the beautiful Berry Springs Nature Park.  With three natural pools to swim in, it offered a lovely afternoon spot.  Picnic tables are available with bbq facilities as well as a kiosk onsite.  During the week was quiet, but could see on the weekend it would be crowded."
121,Refreshing swim,What a great place. Take a pool noodle and you will not be disappointed. The back massage the little water fall gives you is to die for
122,Brilliant place.,Jumped straight in the Freshwater swim hole and had a nice relaxing soothe.Would recommend this visit to all.
123,Beautiful Warm Springs,"The Springs comprise of 3 stunning swimming pools which are a natural wonder. The clear warm water is a delight for swimming or just floating around. Berry Springs itself is the smaller and shallower of the pools featuring a cascading falls. Middle pool is much larger and deeper connecting to lower pool which is not quite as big. You can swim or float the entire length of all 3. There is a kiosk, toilets, bbqs and tables available for picnics. The water and environment  is so enjoyable you won't want to get out."
124,Amazing.,"Went to the Springs to have a look, not disappointed at all. Warm crystal clear water with an amazing backdrop of the falls. We swam in the main, large spring fed pool and loved the peace and quiet with just the sounds of the birds in the trees. Wonderful place for a picknick"
125,Gorgeous ,"Wow Berry springs is amazing, great wildlife, and the springs are awesome to see and also to swim in, it’s like having a warm bath. So worth a drive to have a dip."
126,Family day trip,"Lots of shade, bbq and some tables.Beautiful patrolled springs in which to snorkel and swim.Last weekend had a lovely friendly waigait beach resident share his bbq plate with us.Kids love it here, have space, shade, pools, and mango treats !My favourite bbq place so far."
127,Beautiful swimming spot with crystal clear waters,Great pools.  Easy to get to from Darwin. Clean and tidy recreation area.  Springs were warm and very deep in places.  Recommend taking a noodle.
128,Very relaxing,"This is a stunning, cool and refreshing waterhole, and great place to escape the heat and simply relax. I'm not sure if it is related the mineral content of this waterhole, but I found it strangely easy to float on  my back, with my hand behind my head and watch the kites (birds) riding the thermals in the beautiful blue skies overhead. A definite must to visit and one we will most definitely be returning to."
129,Crystal Clear Water,"Great spot for swimming, waters deep in places clean, crystal clear and warm,  frequented by a lot of back packers and also locals, 30min trip from Darwin worth the drive"
130,Just an awesome place,I didn't know until I visited Berry Springs that there is such a nice retreat in just 40 minutes drive from Darwin. If you are looking for half-day trip around Darwin then this is probably the second best place after Jumping Crocodile cruise on Adelaide River. Or you can very well plan for the whole day and tag both them together. It would be a day well spent.
131,Paradise,Berry Springs is a short drive from DarwinThe springs have 3 different polls to swim in.The water is crystal clear and a must to swim inthe park is free to enter and is popular with locals and tourists
132,Great day out,It was a great way to spend the day. There were a lot of other people there though. If you are not a confident swimmer it is best to take some sort of flotation device as it is deep.
133,Well worth a visit,"This is one of the few natural places you can swim in around Darwin. The water is fresh and clear, and very refreshing. The place is lovely for picnics too, although you might want to bring bug spray. Some times of the year the water isn’t safe for swimming in, but you can find that info on their website before you head out."
134,Beautiful place.,"Beautiful swimming area in natural park setting at Berry Springs, large car park area, however instinct tells me this is always a busy place to visit. Toilet/changeroom facilities available and a tiny Kiosk. Three distinct swimming areas, a large and smaller hole and waterfall area linked with a swimmable creek flow. Surrounded by natural grassed picnic area's. Crystal clear tepid waters and deep blue swimming holes, very pretty place."
135,Beautiful and perfect temperature ,"Lovely place to spend a day in the cool springs, many people having picnics and swimming beuatiful walks lso"
136,Berry springs ,Would recommend these springs.  Popular place for all. Lots of picnic areas and plenty of car parking. Close to other tourist places.
137,Great place for scenery and swimming.,"Berry springs is the largest natural pool to swim in near darwin. It's a beautiful spring and a great place to swim, however beware as there are often crocs I'm the water. The day I visited a saltwater croc showed up while we were swimming and they had to close the pool in order to remove the croc. So please be aware while swimming here."
138,Could Stay All Day,We love Berry Springs for its most beautiful parks to cool off and relax in close to Darwin.We scored a great shaded picnic and barbeque area close to clear swimming pools surrounded by trees and aquatic life.We saw many families with children having their picnics too. One family scored a fire ring to bbq their meats.We even had space to throw a Frisbee!Would consider driving 48km to this venue for my next birthday!
139,"Couldn't recommend more - Tranquil, relaxing and chilled!","Went here from recommendation from our friends who live in Darwin. Great spot to spend the day, bring your lunch and a noodle and enjoy the 3 different ponds (they do connect). Spend a good 4 hours here and will definitely be coming back. Treat yourself to a mango icecream on your way home."
140,Nice for picnic and a swim,"Lovely place to cool off, easy to get in and out of water via ladder/concrete steps. We didn't find any change rooms so had to get changed in toilet cubicle, not ideal. Short drive from Darwin, compared to the water holes in Litchfield. There is a small kiosk and you can hire or purchase pool noodle floaties."
141,Awesome swimming hole close to the city,"The waters although sometimes inhabited by crocodiles, are a great place to swim. Warm and clear water with excellent facilities, this is a favourite of the locals and should not be missed."
142,Wonderful,"A nice place to stop by for a picnic and a dip, however adhere to signage and DO NOT SWIM if they tell you not to, crocodiles are abundant in Darwin and can walk miles for a new water source, other than that its a nice place for a cool dip in Darwins humid environments."
143,Worth a visit on a ht day,"Had the best time water was so warm , rocks can be slippery but other than that I could have stayed forever. Would go back just to visit again"
144,COOL,"A real gem. A great place to have a swim and unwind, easy parking and access and amenities. A must see"
145,Great place to relax ,Very much enjoyed visiting Berry Springs Nature Park and plunge pool.  Well maintained.  Lovely surroundings.
146,Great day out,"This place is AMAZING, like it really is a must do. We arrived around 10am in the morning and spent the full day just relaxing, swimming around the pools and just relaxing. The water is very clear and surprisingly warm. The kiosk was open, but didn't offer a huge variety of food, more just ice creams, crisps and drinks. The park has a BBQ area so pack an esky and you can cook up a feast to enjoy. We honestly love this place!"
147,Great place to spend the afternoon ,"This place is absolutely great. The water is warm so it's easy to just walk into the springs. Take a pool noodle with you and wear thongs. Hook your thongs onto the noodle so after you have floated down to the next pool, you can climb out, walk back to the start and do it all again. Tiring, but worth it for the fun. As you're floating along, try to keep your feet up as there are some quite big rocks under the water and it's easy to hurt yourself. Great afternoon out for young and old."
148,Berry Springs close to Darwin,"We drove the 45 minute trip from Darwin to Berry Springs. It was a delight to be able to easily enter the water and swim around the waterholes. Even though there were lots of tourists, like us, we didn't feel 'squashed in'. It was peaceful."
149,A must see!,very scenic springs. easy to spend hours here as it is not crowded. Has a little kiosk selling mango smoothies which were great. Easy to access
150,Magical day,We visited Berry Springs free entry lots of parking find the falls you get a free back massage standing in the waterfall it great after a long days driving or first thing in the morning before it gets busy winter time only safe to swim. Lots of BBQ areas a cafe that sells local made ice cream which is lush among other items Recommend this to everyone.
151,Peaceful ,This is a great place to visit if you don’t have time to go to Litchfield Park and is very similar without the drive (we did both). Make sure you take swimming noodles to float from the top to bottom.
152,Can get very crowded,"Easy to find, the Springs consist of 3 different swimming spots. The top has a small waterfall and the water is waist deep, clear and very safe for smaller children and those who like to touch the bottom (it's also in complete shade). The other two spots have concrete steps and easy access to the water, but are deeper and are in the open. Yes, there are fish (large and small) and also crocodiles have been found in the area (although it is monitored). Take a inflatable pool toy or pool noodle to use or just enjoy a quick dip. There is also plenty of space before you reach the Springs where you can enjoy a picnic that is shaded, grassed and has tables. There is also a small kiosk that sells drinks and snacks. Well worth the trip for all ages."
153,Sunday pm Visit,"Fabulous little oasis, easy access with a few swimming options. Free with BBQ facilities. Can get crowded.Easy 2wd access. Right next door to the Territory Wildlife Park... both are a must see!"
154,So Relaxing,A Stunning place just next to Darwin where it's possible to spend the entire day swimming and relaxing in the middle of the park.The water is warm and clean.Berry springs are about 1 hour drive to Litchfield national park if you are getting bored and want to change the locations but still remain in a stunning place.
155,Must Do,"Such a nice and lovely place to spend the day with friends and family. Green grass covered by shady trees and a nice bbq/picnic area. Close to the natural pools and waterfall, there is a perfect swim spot for everyone. Modern toilet facilities and a small kiosk. Can become very busy so the carpark fills up and can be a bit of a walk but it is totally worth it."
156,Can be busy but worth it,"A short 45 minute drive. Two lower entry points easiest access, warmer water in these larger pools but deeper water so need floaties, noodle or able to swim. Rocky underfoot in parts and near short waterfall, with very cool water. $2 Mango icy pole delicious. BBQ facilities available. Could bring a picnic and make a day of it. Very relaxing."
157,Trip down memory lane,"Awesome spot for a family picnic or bbq. Safe for kids and plenty of space for them to run wild. Well worth a visitTake a noodle, chair and floating device"
158,A highlight of our stay in Darwin,Wasn’t best time to go but it was lovely still nice. Relaxing aNd fun for the kids. Really lovely. Best times to go are the dry season. May - Oct
159,Wonderful experience at the Springs,We arrived at the wrong time of year. Pools were closed due to possible crocs and bacteria in the water. It look looked amazing and would like to visit in the dry season.
160,Loved the warm water,This Nature Park is a little way out from Darwin but worth the hours drive to see some of natures beautiful creatures on display . The park has a great shuttle train/bus which will drive you from station to station as the walk can be a little demanding in this huge reserve. The Aquarium is a must as this will be quite a highlight of your visit. The park itself is   a naturalists paradise with lots of birdlife and lots to see. The staff are really nice and helpful and so informative about all the aspects of the park . While there just ask about the many variety of trees growing in the park and how you could live off the fruits/berries growing in the park . VERY INTERESTING
161,Awesome ,The springs are beautiful with really clear water. Great for a swim and not too far from Darwin. Plenty of space for a picnic in the grounds nearby. There is a small kiosk selling ice creams and pool noodles
162,amazing,"Beautiful fresh water swimming place. Absolutely indescribable views.A beautiful place to swim in crystal clear waters, very relaxing."
163,lovely place for a swim,"An easy 45 minute drive from Darwin on sealed roads all the way.  2 main swimming areas were nice but there is limited space to lounge around in the immediate vicinity but plenty of grassed space a short stroll away, but out of sight,  from the plunge pools.      High density noodle zone."
164,Nice spot for a family picnic or for travellers to mix it with the locals,"Cooling dips in the springs were most welcome and enjoyable.  Float on a noodle (hire $5 each) from the little waterfall through the three pools, carried by the gentle current - most enjoyable.  Picnic areas plentiful.  Refreshing not have to drive as far as Litchfield Park to get wet!"
165,Great afternoon out,Good park for a picnic / bbq. The springs were warm. Definitely worth the stop. Short drive from darwin
166,Beautiful Berry Springs,"Beautiful scenery.More safety signs, history signs and toilets needed.Not much disability access. Close to other family activities such as wildlife park and berry Springs bamboo."
167,Beautiful Day Out,Berry Springs Nature Park is close to Darwin and recently friends drove us there when visiting the top end. It was a nice warm day and the pools were inviting.     The crocodile free environment is unusual for this proximity to Darwin but local signs warnings reming you the waters may be contaminated and a health hazard! This did not appear to worry the many people who were there and the whole area is very scenic.    So close to Darwin and safe for children is a real bonus - maybe taking swimming goggles would be worthwhile. The park has a kiosk selling ice creams and drinks which was good to see.
168,Amazing site,I enjoined my trip very much.The only complain I have is a difficult access to the main lake. Not suitable for older people.
169,Beautiful place ,"We went down to the gardens today. There was a bbq area and a bear in there! All the bears from everywhere were in the water slides, the games, toy picnic play area, on the trains in the aquarium..Bears bears and giggling kids patting baby animals too. What a lovely day!! Thanks so much.The kids were inspired to donate the out of date first aid things to the doctor rangers. Bewdy!!!"
170,Awesome time,Omg ! What a piece of paradise this is ! Two lovely massive lagoons with crystal clear water ! There is also a tiny waterfall connecting the first lagoon which you really need to go and hang out ! Hopefully you’re lucky enough and there are not going to be yelling children around !
171,Great family swim & eat,"Berry Springs is a must when visiting Darwin (located roughly 45 mins out). You are literally swimming in natural springs, with a choice of three swim spots. Safe enough for kids (with supervision) and there is a BBQ area if you wanted to setup for lunch. I would pass on the 1km walk the next time round. TIP: Bring a pool noodle if you have one (you can rent them there) as the water is deep in spots and this allows you to chill out on the water."
172,Lovely place for a swing ,"Really nice spot to visit and so close to darwin. Quick drive from the city and you can be relaxing in this park, beautiful water and surroundings. Good to visit mid week when there’s not as many people."
173,Idillic,"We visited Berry Springs to find it crowded with noisy, boisterous visitors.  We were also concerned to read the warnings signposted. Be careful about swimming here."
174,Be careful if swimming at Berry Springs,"Clean facilities and well stocked store. Enjoyable swim in warm water, watch those nibbling fish around your feet. Plenty of room to swim in the pool which is easily accessible. Can't believe it's free to enter.r"
175,nice place to vist,"Called into Berry Springs on the way home from the Jumping Crocodile. What a place. Swimming just magic. Lots of swimmers with ""noodles"" as quite deep in places. Swimmers stayed in for ages as so warm. You can hire the noodles. $3 with a refundable $5 deposit. Kids there just loved it. Water so warm. Lots and lots of people there. A café if you forget your lunch?. A must to visit."
176,Wonderfully green shaded paradise,last minute decision the heat was gettingto us so we decided to make the trip up to berry springs from humpty doo and what a great decision that was! beautiful parks to have lunch chill out and go for a swim in crystal clear waters! definitely something that should be on everyone’s to do list when visiting darwin 👍🏻
177,Loved it!!!,Best swimming spot around Darwin. Within easy reach and lovely settings. Water is pleasantly warm and plenty of shade.
178,So beautiful!,"Went out to Berry Springs on our last day in Darwin and thoroughly enjoyed it.The springs are about 40 Km out of town, but well worth the trip.The water is warm all the way through from the little waterfall down to the main pool.Just be aware that it is best to either take your own flotation gear, ie noodles if you have kids, as in the main pool there are no areas where you can stand as the banks go pretty much straight down.The grounds are large with many areas to have a picnic, lunch etc.There is a very small cafe at thee trance to purchase, drinks, ice creams etc,...you can also hire noodles from this cafe.There is limited parking, so if you arrive and there is no parking, then you have to leave and comeback later."
179,Nice Oasis..and popular...,"Berry Springs is a magnificent swimming spring with a small waterfall.  Very tranquil and beautiful jungle area with a current that allows you to float along creeks to three main ponds.There is a small kiosk with limited food but they do have ice creams, drinks and some pastries.  The kiosk sell and hire Noodles and goggles for swimming but have a limited supply so I would suggest bring your own as there are a variety of large fish to see.There are paths to two of the ponds, so wheelchair access is okay.It was an amazing afternoon swimming with lots of shade.  Excellent for kids but the majority is deep, no toddler ponds.A must see in my book and for a bonus it’s free !!!"
180,Reluctantly we went there but...,"Great convenient place for a family day out.Can get very busy during the dry season, particularly during the weekend and is usually closed in the wet season. However, if you can get there either on a quiet weekend or a weekday it be absolutely perfect. Small thermal pool at the top with a fun little cascading water fall, leading to a series of large deep pools further down stream.  Each part has its own charms with the small upstream pools usually having lots of bit to explore, but also being quite busy. The large downstream pools are great for having a splash around and a bit more space. Even the big downstream pools have some fun bits to explore for inquisitive kids with goggles and fins. Berry Springs has been around for a very long time, first being opening during WWII and for years the infrastructure was getting a bit tired, recently though it has been upgraded with a nice toilet block, better pool access and even a very small kiosk. Given its proximity to Darwin it can make for a very nice day out of town. As mentioned above, offpeaks times are the best, but even you are there on a busy weekend, typically there is enough water that you can find a nice space to relax."
181,"Beautiful scenery, excellent facilities","Nicely maintained, good parking and great facilities. Berry Springs only lacks food facilities, although the Kiosk was open for snacks."
182,Fabulous - A must see attraction ,"Take your bathers, snorkel and mask. The pools are warm and full of fish. You can take a picnic and camera. Also the archer fish will entertain you if you hold some biscuit or little pieces of bread orer the water for them to shoot down. Great fun.There are toilets, showers and change rooms. Beautiful shady trees to relax under."
183,Nice nature Park with beautiful swimming,"Within easy driving distance of Darwin, Berry Springs is a wonderful way to experience a stunning natural waterhole; clear water offering relief from the heat, green surrounds offering a wonderful calmness."
184,A dip in the Springs,This is a free thermal springs.Fairly deep Rocky bottom.Stop by you will sure to enjoy.They have local mangoiceam and kiosk too.Take a picnic the grass gardens are lovely.
185,Fresh Springs...,Get there early and avoid crowds in school holidays.  We got there about 10 am and had an hour before families turned up to picnic. Beautiful  warm therapeutic pools. You can hop in at the top pool where the waterfall is and have a play with its power.  Then float down to the next 2 water holes. Shady so sunburn risk minimal.  No insects.
186,Great location close to Darwin,"This place is a little piece of paradise, tucked away.  I wish I had of known about it my last trip to Darwin.  I will most definitely be heading back there the next time I go to Darwin.  There are a number of springs that you can enjoy and you can even hire noodles.  Even better take your own and save yourself some money and just soak up the warm water and the atmosphere"
187,A nice Oasis a short drive from Darwin.,What a hidden gem this place is. It is so beautiful. You can have a free shoulder massage under the waterfall or float for hours on a pool noodle in either of the other two pools. Heaps of shade too. The water is warm but not quite as warm as Mataranka.
188,Refreshing cool down,"These hot springs/pools are convenient to Darwin if you are limited for time. Larger pools than Mataranka, Bitter Springs or Katherine, thy are quite popular and busy. Lots of fish too. Surrounded by beautiful parks, this would be a great venue for a family day out."
189,Berry springs ,Great place for a refreshing swim...but please don't let the little ones wee on the steps near the waters edge :)
190,An Oasis only 30 minutes from Darwin ,The springs had a warning about bacteria in the water.  There were heaps of people drinking in and around the springs.  Found it really dirty.
191,Darwin attractions,The pools are warm the birds are singing and the locals are in all their glory.Definitely a must see.Note: If you are squeamish about the possibility of crocs stick to the top pool with the water fall it gets a little iffy from there down.
192,Absolutely Beautiful,"We were amazed by just how close (47kms from Darwin) and how beautiful this place was. We went on a Sunday and had expected crowds, but it is so big that you certainly didn’t feel crowded. We bought some pool noodles from a local Kmart before we went, but you could buy them there. $3 at Kmart, $6 at the Springs. I thought both prices were really reasonable. It’s also free entry"
193,Popular place - Go before noon,"Beautiful nature park, well maintained, plenty of space. The top pool is small but the other 2 are great for swimming. Try to arrive before 10 to enjoy the pool with not many people as it can get crowded later on. But deep and clear pools, plenty of fish. There are hips of table to picnic with a few birds around. There is also a very small kiosks selling some food. Come and relax in nature"
194,Cool spot to visit,"Very clear water that was pleasant temperature. Free picnic tables, BBQ,  bins,  kiosk, toilets.Bring or buy a noodle $6Easy access for people with disabilities,but maybe,not wheelchairCar park to pool party 2 min walk.Popular local spot but large enough for many people without swimming on top of each other (worse case scenario)"
195,Amazing,"These springs are warm but deep, bring a noodle. Small cafe open for limited hours but you can grab a drink or a snack. Large grassed area to warm up or sit in the shade of the big trees after your swim. A number of pools to chose from or start in the first one and float on downstream. Again bring noodles as it is deep"
196,Swim,"Must do outing for all the family, plenty of parking, toilets, food van, bbqs, lovely lawn areas.  Water warm and relaxing, get there early to avoid the crowds."
197,Great Spot,"This was awesome. 45 mins drive out of Darwin. Free! A real nature experience. Do take goggles...there are some beautiful fish to see as you swim around. A noodle is useful but not essential. We went on a weekday and also went for a second time on a public holiday. Neither time was busy. Its very quiet at 8 am...perfect for a chance to sit in the small but rigorous waterfall. We went with our 12 year old and she was the one asking if we could go for a second time. Each time we spent  3+ hours. The overall effect was a literal emersion in nature. Don't be put off by the potential threat of mozzies. We did spray before we went but were in and out of the water for hours and didn't get one bite. The water is warm and you won't feel cold in the slightest. Its only a short 5 main walk from the car park so I'd recommend leaving your cameras and valuables in the car while you swim so you don't have to even think about them. The springs have 3 pools connected by waterways so you can't always see your towels, purse etc if you take them with you which is why I'd leave them in the car while you enjoy swimming around. Can't recommend highly enough."
198,swimming delight,Having family over from New Zealand and decided to show them some of the Northern Territory wildlife and the nature park is the place. Take the train to each  attraction or you can walk the whole way around. You’ll won’t be disappointed with the wildlife on display and it’s set in the lovely area of Berry Springs.
199,Secret paradise,"Great spot to cool off about 40 mins from Darwin. Bring floaties and noodles, or hire noodles there. Underwater reef shoes are handy too."
200,Love this place,This is a great place to day trip and cool down about an hour from Darwin.Berry Springs is a Pandanus lined swimming hole not far from Darwin. It is one of the few places you can safely swim that isn't a hotel pool. The archer fish there are amazing and they swim around you in the crystal clear water. A great place to spend a few hours. Just up the road is the Berry Springs tavern that has some of the best pub food I have ever eaten.Try the threadfin and chips you wont be disappointed.
201,Fabulous Place,"This is a very pretty place to visit, just pop in for a look and swim if you like, the swimming was closed when I was there, but would be great."
202,Gorgeous!,Great venue and easy to get around. We easily spent a whole day here and learnt new things as well. Can get busy though so we avoided school holidays.
203,Great swimming hole,Can be very busy June/July.  Be there early and take a noodle to float on the water.Can buy or hire one at the kiosk.Picnic tables provided under beautiful shady trees.  BBQ available.
204,What a hidden gem,Perfect little spot just out of Darwin.  Great days outing.  Just bring your noodle or swim ring and relax.
205,Really close to nature!,"We love hanging out here on weekends and taking all of our visitors here as it's not far and a great day out if you stop for lunch after at the tavern.  The water is crystal clear and not too cold.  The waterfall section is great for young kids and families as it's shallow the other pool sections are quite deep and you need a pool noodle or ring with kids.  On weekends the rangers are sometimes out with some demonstrations, baby freshwater crocs and snakes for people to see and touch."
206,Paradise,"We called in this morning on our way past. The pools are very clean and the area is wellmaintained. Plenty of room to swim or just to relax and picnic in the grassed areas. There is a kiosk and changing rooms on site,"
207,Fabulous swimming place within easy reach of Darwin,Busy but beautiful- 100% recommend visiting. 3 different swimming spots. 45 mins out of Darwin- hidden gem.
208,Renergizing oasis ,We stopped here on the way to Darwin.  As it is very close to the city it was a good place to have a lovely swim and some very tasty ice cream.  There are several inter connected 'pool's which are great to swim in.
209,"Relax, relax, relax",went there mid week..great park .free barbies and ammenitties brilliant swimming spot...had a cafe there but we didnt use it......excellent
210,Paradise,"A short drive from Darwin (45 mins) Berry Springs and beautiful and the water is just perfect; not too hot and not too cold. Would recommend going down to the lower pool to get away from the crowds. Probably best to avoid weekends, public holidays and school holidays as it gets pretty busy. Look out for the Rainbow Bee-eaters (beautiful rainbow colored birds) that snap up bugs that fly near the water, and the fish that shoot water to knock bugs off leaves and trees to eat."
211,Clear blue waters,Not to far out of Darwin and a lovely refreshing place to chill out for an hour - the springs were beautiful to relax in.
212,Arrive early!,"We had not been tp this park for 10 years the top pool use to be chocker  full of lovely water,now it only has enough for a foot bath The bottom pool was crystal clear not now and it is slimy i had slime on my feet dripping on to my thongs as i walked up the hill very slippery and my partner was the same Very sad to see the springs like this ,is it the fact that there are so many mango and asian vege farmers taking huge amounts of the under ground water?"
213,Lovely Cool Pretty Place,We spent a few hours here just relaxing. Had a dip in the water and we could see the fish swimming around. Also saw a large lizard which was exciting for us tourists! Bring a picnic and pool noodles and make a day of it.
214,Worth it.,The Springs were beautiful. Made for an amazing swim. Located in a beautiful national park. Definitely worth visiting.
215,Beautiful ,"Lots of swimming holes to choose from - so if one is crowded, you can move onto the next not-so-busy one! Crystal clear water - allows you to see all the fish including Archer Fish!  A relatively easy 45 minute drive from Darwin itself.Plenty of space for a picnic lunch. Lovely spot to relax and chill. Couldn't recommend more!"
216,BERRY SPRINGS N.T.,"About 45 mins from Darwin, Berry Springs is a well maintained natural spring that is safe for swimming. Water is clean and fairly clear. Edges have been built up with ladder for easy access to water. Toilets near car park. Can get very busy. Their are two swimming spots both a short walk from car park. Water is very deep in most areas so best to take a noodle float to fully relax. Our kids loved it. Water was mild in temperature."
217,A must to see when you're in Darwin,We visited three times. Loved the various pools. Good changing facilities.  The little fish that nibble your skin became a intense because I had sand fly bites and they would not leave me alone. Loved the swim.
218,In and out,"I cannot believe how beautiful this place is. Stunning. So pretty, calm and peaceful. Then the walkers, picnicers, swimmers arrived and enjoyed their day, too. There are toilets and a small kiosk, lawned areas, tables and chairs. I went early, then back again on the way home. I had to convince myself to leave. Paradise on Earth."
219,Give yourself plenty of time,What a beautiful place to visit for a swim.  Not too far out of Darwin and virtually deserted in the week.  Had the pools and streams to ourselves and they are wonderful
220,Great place to relax with the family,"Great spot to unpack your picnic lunch in the shade, then have a swim and relax before moving on to your next stop. About an hour from Darwin city."
221,"Don't be a noob, bring a noodle","This beautiful place has a serene and moving energy. The warm spring fed water is so relaxing and invigorating at the same time. We have a were lucky enough to be there on a quiet day, so relaxing, gorgeous boardwalk and plenty of picnic areas. BYO everything but so worth a visit truly beautiful."
222,Lovely any time of year,"Quite nice but the facilities , as such, were completely  swamped by a not large number of visitors. Paths, Shade and general access were inadequate, the smell, presumably fro/m the septic system was awefull   Improvement needed."
223,U have to go here!,"This is just a beautiful spot.  The water is warm. Its very shady. Has lovely lawned areas to have your lunch.  Friendly birds. Very peaceful even with people there. Take snorkles, as good to see how deep the springs are."
224,Beautiful scenery,"Was a nice place to visit,a bit of green in the middle of the brown, not sure about swimming there water was murky and had signs about swimming with the water quality"
225,Cool clear waters,"Saw this on the map and just went to see what was there. Was very pleasantly surprised. There are three ponds you can float down all very accessible. Beautiful on a hot NT day. Wasn’t too crowded, but  expect it could be"
226,Outdoor Adventure.,Stopped here on the way to the Territory Wildlife park.  There is ample parking and the springs look fabulously inviting and cool - although when we visited there was a warning of higher than normal bacteria in the water (so we decided not to swim).  It did not deter numerous others who were happily swimming despite the warning.  There are lovely areas for sitting and having a picknick and there are good restroom facilities too.  I came into very close contact with a green snake in the ladies toilet - which I only noticed as I was flushing the toilet!!  Scary indeed - but that’s what it means to be close to nature!
227,Wonderful water falls,A beautiful fresh water swimming hole a short drive from Darwin. Make a day of it and detour to Humpty Doo hotel for lunch. We did 😀
228,Swimming,When in Darwin you should visit berry springs. Take a picnic. Dont forget fly spray. Lovely.day out for family. Water did smell a little and if you have trouble pulling yourself up and down a ladder dont go here. Plenty. Other watering holes to swim with steps.
229,Enjoyable day out.,I love nature since I landed in Darwin. Everything seems so perfectly blend. Beautiful scenery with the nature forest scents. Recommended for camping and swimming. So awesome!!! The waterfalls so inviting. There are three pools and you can choose the one that suits you. Getting busy at noon. Experience the water massage like in the SPA.
230,Must do if visiting Darwin,"Only a 40 minute drive from Darwin City, loads of car parks but I can imagine in the busy season it would fill up quickly. In the middle of winter there were few spots left.The water holes were absolutely spectacular! The lower pools were great for people with kids.Great place for a swim to cool off."
231,A wonderful way to spend the day!,"A lovely place to relax, water very clear and plenty of space to spread out and lots of shade. Beautiful place and not very far out of Darwin."
232,Top place to cool off,It's free and it's fantastic.  The water is gorgeous and the park itself is lovely. Definitely worth the visit.
233,Just as good as Litchfield ,"This is a lovely spot to enjoy nature, water and the company of people in a serene environment. there is separate areas to swim and you could enjoy picnic or lunch here without a problem. This place is so close to Darwin and if I lived here would visit regular."
234,AMAZING! ,"Berry Springs was beautiful, a little pocket of paradise. Lovely little waterfalls, water refreshing, not freezing cold."
235,cool place to swim,"These Springs are free to visit. They are not thermal but the water temperature is warm due to Darwins weather conditions. There are three areas to swim, one is a large flowing lake style (lower pool) with most areas deeper than standing so taking a noodle or floating device is a good idea,the other (main pool) has steps and rails to enter the water. the thrid is where the Springs come out of the ground and create a waterfall cascading over rocks. This place is so relaxing and well worth the drive to cool off.This nature Park has picnic tables, wood fired and gas/electric bbq's. It has shaded areas, toilets."
236,Don't go on weekends ,"Such a hidden gem, we just sat for about and hour just taking in the sights and listening to the river, water was really cool, cant wait to go back."
237,Refreshing ,"Berry Springs is a must do when visiting Darwin. Around a 45 minute drive and you are there.We arrived early, around 9am and it was well worth it to have this amazing place almost to ourselves. Its big so I don't think it would be to bad if crowded.The water is so pure. An amazing place to cool off.After your visit stop by Berry Springs Tavern for a drink and a feed, well worth it. Great day out."
238,Lovely spot to cool off for the whole family,"Staying in Berry Springs on our travels around Australia and only 3.5km from the caravan park we found this hidden gem. Have come across some beautiful springs over the last two weeks this one would be in my top 2, different size pools to suit all swimmers plus one with a small waterfall. If heading towards Darwin make sure you call in here for a refreshing dip you won't be disappointed."
239,It's good to come back to nature,"Shady, grassy with a crystal clear tepid pool and small waterfall - heaven after a dusty day on the road."
240,Tourists ,"A picnic with a difference as old Territorians use to say ""32 miles out of Darwin city"".  Refreshing areas, small waterfall and deep area for swimming and a Tarzan rope to swing on.  Barbecue areas available for a sausage sizzle."
241,We survived,Just 45 minutes drive from Darwin is the beautiful Berry Springs great the family to relax spend the day. It has a little shop to you can buy ice creams and cold drinks and the pools are lovely and coolI recommend sitting in the top Springs where you can feel the hot water and the cold water mixing together around your body.Then you can gently float down to the larger pool
242,Great spring to swim in.,"Scenic and refreshing in the humid Darwin heat. Beware of crocs,  wouldn't have swam there and floated down the river into different plunge pools if we had heard the stories of crocs and talked to rangers and locals beforehand."
243,One eye open 🐊,"what an amazing spot, but you must go early , gates open at 8 am and by 10-10.30 am the crowd arrives and i mean over 300 people. I was on my own till 10 am."
244,lovely nature pool,Came after a day at the Wildlife Park next door. Not packed but still very popular later in the afternoon. Lovely water and a nice break before the drive back to Darwin.
245,Nature at its finest,Beautiful spot on a hot day. Relax in the crystal clear spring water. Take your pool noodles and just float and enjoy.
246,Perfect place for to relax,"If you have an extra day in Darwin, please have a relax day at Berry Springs! The waterfall is a nice spot for you to stand under and let the water flow over you. There is also a main pool and lower pool where you can swim. You can swim from the main pool to the small waterfall. There are a couple of fish, some really big, but they are scared of you so they will swim away!."
247,Beautiful swimming hole,"This is such a great swimming hole close to darwin. I'd rate it over Litchfield park. Like everything, try to go midweek as it can get crazy busy in the weekends.The top pool is best for family's with young children. Most of the drunken yobbos are in the bottom two pools. The top pool under the waterfall is also warmer water. Take a picnic mat as it's rare to score a table. There is plenty of nice shady spots on the grass under he trees. Other tips: You can't take glass bottles. There are bbqs for cooking, there is a shop for basic food and snacks, take mosquito repellent, take bread for feeding birds and fish, take noodles for swimming. Time your arrival as the car park can get full."
248,Beautiful clear springs for swimming,"Avoid hustle and bustle of Darwin CBD, you could drive to Berry Spring to enjoy the peaceful nature."
249,An oasis,Choose your favourite swimming hole with a choice of 3! Stay and have a BBQ or picnic or stroll through an easy 1km forest walk. Or do it all! We were there about 11am and it was beginning to get busy BUT if you look about you can find tables at the upper pool garden area. A beautiful spot
250,Cool off in the heat,"Bring the kids or the family and take a refreshing dip... You can also enjoy the free electric bbq’s, visit the shop or just have a picnic. Spend a few hours relaxing."
251,Loved it,We went two days in a row as we enjoyed it so much. It is not just the springs. There are lots of BBQ's and seating for picnics etc  Noodles are a necessity to float around and enjoy the scenery and serenity. There are three different pools. We chose the third as it was the deepest and not as busy. Best of all it is free 😁 There is also a small kiosk to get drinks or ice creams.
252,Amazing Springs,If you are tossing up whether to bother with these springs as well as Litchfield the answer is yes ! The water is delightfully warm and stunning aqua colours. We swam in one of the natural  pools and even though it is peak tourist season the place was not overly crowded.
253,Pretty special place,This is one of the highlights in and around Darwin especially on a hot day. The springs are inside a very large area that includes lots of shade and grass to sit back and relax on . The springs are full of fish and there are many lizards and birds for those who want to see wildlife. There is a little kiosk that sells local ice cream and free BBQ's Its a great spot and not far from Darwin. The Springs have different swimming areas of vayring depth so everyone can enjoy.
254,Tranquility at it's best,"Worth the small drive up the road.Come early, we had it pretty much to ourselves for an hour! Water was warm, you can start up near the waterfall and drift down to the main pool and lower pool. Water is clear and you can see the fish swim around. There is a low risk of crocs, so I was just keeping an eye out! Water is deep in the main pool and lower one. Bring a noodle or board for the kids. I bought a noodle ($6) from the kiosk and was happy floating around watching the kites above. Got busy around lunch, there is loads of room for a picnic or BBQ. Bring some snacks etc."
255,Perfect place to relax !,"Just 40 mins from Darwin by car, Berry Springs offers lots for families and friends alike to cool off on a hot day.My friends took their 10 week old baby and stayed in the top waterhole next to the waterfall where it isn’t very deep and although they didn’t bother taking the stroller down the 30 or so stairs, there was room enough to put all the gear on the concrete platform.There are 2 other entry points to the deeper pools with steel ladders to get access to/from the water and there are not nearly so many steps to worry about. We got there early (before 11am) and there weren’t many people there and parking was a breeze, but by the time we left 90 mins later the crowds had started arriving (and this is the beginning of the wet season, it’s more crowded in the dry).I swam down to the next two waterholes but it does get very deep, so if you’re not a strong swimmer, take some noodles or floaty things. Be careful of submerged rocks and fallen trees - don’t jump in unless you know what’s underneath first and have checked the depth as it varies widely. Yes, there are signs about crocodiles, but the rangers keep an eye out and trap and remove them if they come across them and it doesn’t seem to worry anyone!  If you feel something nibbling your feet, don’t panic, it’s just the small fish and they tickle, they don’t hurt. The park is large and has lots of picnic tables, a small kiosk, free BBQ facilities, clean toilets and a large car park.Well worth a visit with kids and adults of all ages if you’re a visitor to Darwin and want to cool down."
256,Perfect Oasis,"Really clear water at a great temperature, kiosk was open but the prices were high. Plenty of space to do a family picnic or BBQ. If your looking for a family relax this is great spot. Sit under the small waterfall and watch the world swim by."
257,Loved it,Came as part of a tour but lovely to see the springs and listen for the wildlife.  Would be a good place to swim in warmer months
258,An oasis close to Darwin.,"We live here, and sometimes forget to take a trip to attractions that we have not been to for a long time. So Berry Springs it was, wow, could not believe the changes after so long. It’s great, the water is crystal clear, the pools very pretty, and the waterfall lovely. We went during the week so it was nice and quiet. Picnic areas everywhere, shady as well. There is also a Kiosk, and I did notice the sign said that they have GF products. We didn’t go in for a swim, as 1 it was a cold Darwin day, and 2 I know its always checked by Rangers, but I just have a fear of crocs. Mind you by the waterfall area is nice and shallow so that really appealed if it had been a warmer day."
259,Busy ,Easy to find.. Lots of people around but car parking still easy to get close. Toilets are clean and change areas provided too. The pools are really wonderful.. Easy to get in and out of water. Top with waterfall my favourite.. Water waist deep so ok for parents with little ones.. I stayed under waterfall for about an hour!!!
260,day trip,"I encourage to go early in dry. As lovely as it is, we visited when it was low water - one week off closure and heaps of flies. Lots of people over a weekend. I look forward to checking out this gorgeous spot after a wet!! Great facilities and rangers info sessions. Love the man made water feature."
261,Relaxing park and swimming spot,"Absolutely beautiful natural swimming pool that stretches for ever and ever, in fact right down to the harbour of Darwin. Make sure you take mosquito repellent when going there."
262,Great swimming half an hour from the city,"Wash the dust off after a day tour into Litchfield National Park, this is where you go! Just float around in the huge wide basin of crystal clear water....."
263,Quick get away from Darwin,Whilst in Darwin for a couple of weeks we regularly drove down to Berry Springs for a relaxing dip. We took a Noodle each with us & just floated around & watched the birdlife & the fish we were swimming with. Set in beautiful surroundings with Toilets & BBQ facilities. There is a small Kiosk but it wasn't open while we were there. Highly Recommend.
264,Beautiful swimming spot,"The water was fresh and clear, just the right temperature, not too cold. We weren't going to get noodles but the pools are very deep and we ended up buying two from the kiosk which made it a much nicer experience for the kids. Goggles are a great idea if you want to look at the fish, there are a few big ones in spots. Several different pools and we could swim from one to another or you could hop out and walk. Steps and ladders in a few places, easy to get out. This is a really beautiful area and not too far from Darwin. Had a wonderful time."
265,Gorgeous little spot,"if you like birds, you’ll love the feeding frenzy display in particular. So many gorgeous birds in a giant aviary swooping down to check out the feed. The Birds of Prey demo is fun to watch."
266,Must must do!!!,Brilliant very clean and free. The UK could learn a lot about free parking and cleanliness. Croc free but great bird and fish life.
267,Arrive early.,"We went there around 1pm on a week day and there were no parks left, so we didn't even get out and look around. National Parks should really do something about it"
268,Great for a cool off,If you want to truly enjoy what Berry Springs has to offer then don't go on weekends when the locals are there unless you enjoy watching them suck on a can of grog and smoke while floating in the water in all three areas of the springs. No respect for families with children. It's a area that is visited by thousands of tourists all around the world as this is not a good image. Why would people want to visit the top end if this is what they get to see as not only does it happen at Berry Springs but also a number of swimming holes at Litchfield.
269,Loved this,Berey springs is a gorgeous natural spring within an hours drive of Darwin.  There's a large gassed area with bbqs and picnic tables and a great place for a day trip. The end pool with waterfall is so beautiful and one of my favourite places. Not too deep so is good for kids. Take goggles to get them looking for fish .
270,I just love taking our guests here!!,"Came here for half a day with a friend and had the best time. Lots of places to set up for a full day with tables, chairs, grass etc but we opted to just throw a towel down on the edge of the springs. You enter the springs at one end and can float down between three big pools of water. Floaters can be acquired if you don’t have your own (I’d suggest getting one!!) The whole place is very tranquil and we were there during school holiday time and it wasn’t too crowded, which was nice. There’s fish in the water with you, as with changing level of rocks so watch your knees and toes."
271,Nice swimming pool,"There is a lot to see, and often more if you have the time to look, it's rustic in an organised way, but wear a hat or take an umbrella it's hot. A great attraction."
272,"Great place to swim, but check the signs for Crocs first.",It’s so nice here just to have a dip in the water or just a walk around and have a look. Maybe you will be able to spot a crocodile!
273,Cool and shady,We visited Berry Springs on our way back to Darwin from Litchfield NP.  Arriving late in the day was awesome as we virtually had the place to ourselves.  The pools are just beautiful and water so warm and inviting.  We swam through all the pools and climbed to the top of the small waterfall.  It was just like being in a spa bath!  Love the natural setting.  Definitely worth a visit!
274,Untouched ,Absolutely stunning! Beautiful fresh water swimming place. Absolutely indescribable views. Will never forget this scenery definitely check this place out won’t be disappointed
275,This is a lovely spot for a visit or the start of a tour of Litchfield National Park.,Berry Springs in Northern Territory just north of Litchfield National Park was a refreshing dip into a natural spring.
276,Warm waters,This park has monsoon rainforest and dry wooded forest. They're nice flat paths. There are toilets and change areas. Also are you for drinking water.The river is fed by a spring with a reasonably strong current near the spring end of the swimming area.You can swim from the lower pool to the upper pool against the current however the narrow channel between the two pools is fairly shallow and you have to be aware of rocks and some submerged logs.There are fish in the water which don't bother you. The water is crystal clear and the water warm making swimming a pleasure. You can swim upstream from the lower pool to the upper pool and then float  back down with the current while avoiding kicking with your legs in the shallow area in case you touch the rocks on the bottom.This place is well with the visit for a gentle interesting walk and a refreshing swim
277,Holiday ,"We spent the morning a few minutes up the road at the Territory Wildlife Park and then went to Berry Springs in the heat of the afternoon, which was a great decision.The water was warm (not hot so it was refreshing while being really pleasant to be in), as it is warm you can stay in for as long as you like without feeling the need to get out and warm up.The waterhole has a number of places to enter the water, I liked the main pool best as from here you could swim to the waterfall area or the lower pool.Definitely take your goggles so you can look at the native fish that share the environment with you. Some of the fish are surprisingly large and if you take some bread you can hand feed them.Much of the waterhole is quite deep so if you are not a good swimmer you can hire a pool noodle from the kiosk there.We really enjoyed the visit and strongly recommend it."
278,Make It A Lunch Stop,Take your googles with you and get there early as the carpark fills up and it gets very busy. Lots of shady spots to have a picnic and there is bbq to use. Changing rooms and toilets are available. I highly recommend a visit here as it is nice and warm and lots of fish to see if you get there early.
279,Beautiful spot close to Darwin,"Berry Springs is about an hour’s drive south of Darwin, easy to find. It has two large safe swimming holes and a range of picnic areas for all the family. A really good day out."
280,Tips from a local,Few laps late arfternoon. Quiet only 5 people in main pool area. Nice even temperature water. Plenty of fish in very clear water. No rubbish left lying around. There are BBQs and a kiosk. Decent change/toilet facilities. Very well shaded by woodland with some open grassed areas. Parking available for trailers/caravans.
281,Little bit of paradise,"Berry springs is hidden gem not far from Darwin , about 40kms in the car. So peaceful and relaxing, the water was warm and clear. There are 3 main areas you can swim, bbq facilities, tables, etc, highly recommend a visit"
282,Swimming with Crocs,"Whilst staying in Girraween for a month we regularly went to cool down at Berry Springs. A very short walk from the car park through a lovely shaded bbq area you have a choice of 3 areas to swim in. Very large & nowhere near as many people as other Springs in the surrounding area. Do yourself a favour, buy a noodle from Big W for $2 or you can purchase from the little canteen there & spend a couple of hours relaxing. There are toilets & change rooms, the canteen sells pies, sandwiches & ice cream."
283,hubbard2017,"I love taking photos of nature, but sometimes there are just too many people  that spoil the shot.  However, great free swimming spot. Take a pool noodle for floating around. Early arrival will beat the crowds."
284,Great spot for swim & picnic,"The shortest drive if you want to do something out of Darwin. We went early in the morning around 9AM on a weekday and there were only about 4 or 5 other people. Great, refreshing swim. But I can imagine this place to be busy in weekends. Bring some floating attributes."
285,good,"I returned to Berry Springs after not having been there for over 20 years. The facilities and amenities have been improved beyond my wildest dreams! It was amazing. Despite the car park being full and overflowing, the springs didn’t feel crowded. The atmosphere was relaxing and tranquil. The water temperature is sublime. The accessible springs are so much bigger than they were decades ago and they are surrounded by great walking paths, multiple entry points and lush tropical forests. This is a must do for all visitors to Darwin, particularly those with children. Take a pool noodle or floatation device for those who aren’t strong swimmers. You only need to wear thongs as the pathways are all great. There is a kiosk with reasonably priced snacks including ice creams. Take mosquito repellent as the mozzies are big and they bite!!"
286,Pleasant swimming,Listen to the Park Rangers.  If they say don't swim past a given point they mean it.  The best place to sit and enjoy a cool drink here is up by the small waterfall that comes direct from the springs.  The water is so clear you can take crystal clear photos under the water.  Beautiful peaceful place.  Closed during the Wet Season but those times are clearly advertised.
287,Great fun,To get to Berry Springs I would recommend that you hire a car for the day and drive out. The kiosk hires noodles for a minimal price so you can just float around. On your way home call into the tavern and have a great lunch.
288,Really worth a visit,"We love Berry Springs because of its location. If you’re a visitor, you’ll be making the trip to Litchfield for sure, but don’t go past Berry springs. It has a huge swimming hole perfect for an afternoon."
289,"quiet, beautiful and relaxing","Berry Springs National Park is a must to visit in the NT. It's about a hour from Darwin and is also located near Territory Wildlife Park  .It's stunning,clear water you can swim with fish in the water. It is so relaxing . They offer parking and toilet and changing facilities ."
290,Pool was closed,"Absolutely love Berry Springs and would have to say it is one of my favourites in Darwin. Not too far of a drive, around 40 minutes and has an awesome park for the children. Water is luke warm and your surroundings are so beautiful. If you love nature you'll love Berry Springs"
291,Berry Springs,"What is a top spot and very enjoyable pales slightly when just an hour or two after you have braved the pools the radio announces a Croc has been sighted, later captured & removed. Puts a bit of a shadow on the day ! It's still a good spot for a picnic with lots of room & shade areas. The crypto warning re the water quality is a bit of a worry though and the signs recommend NOT going in ? So between the bugs & crocs I may give it a miss in future ?"
292,Simply Beautiful,"I can't rave about this place enough. I went here in 2012, and again last week. Both times - perfect. This time was much busier, but it's peak and school holidays, so that's to be expected. The atmosphere was no less wonderful - the water no less relaxing."
293,This is a must do and forgotten place in NT,"Worth the drive from Darwin. Was busy - just got a park, took a picnic, but saw that there was a basic little kiosk selling pies, ice creams etc (the lady in there was very nice!)Advise swimming noodles (can buy/hire there) to float around in the lovely warm picturesque springs!Thoroughly enjoyed - AND FREE!!!!"
294,Great,"Driving in the Territory can mean long distances but Berry Springs is only 30 minutes from central Darwin. The salty (crocodile) that dropped in for a swim the week before had been captured and the four swimming areas and shady grounds were being enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. A café on site has food, drinks, ice creams and more, or bring a picnic. One of the pools is quite deep and plenty of people were using ""pool noodles"" so they could float along with little effort. Worth a visit to the nearby Mango Farm on the return journey."
295,Stunning,"Whenever I'm in Darwin I try to visit Berry Springs. It's around an hour drive from Darwin and is truly a place you need to put on your NT Itinerary. The water is a beautiful turquoise blue surrounded by abundant flora. This place is an amazing space for spending a day out with friends/family, with BBQ facilities, open spaces, public loos, and of course the amazing springs. Love this place and if you can't unwind here....well what can I say."
296,Swimming in Berry Springs ,"Just a shortish drive out to Berry Springs and you feel like your'e in a another world. Warm clear water, wonderful setting, I could have lounged in the water all day. Lovely."
297,Great place to visit,"Berry springs is the locals chillax spot, although it is a little bit of a drive from Darwin. The natural springs are lovely, however bring a noodle so you are not constantly treading water.  My territorian sister keeps noodles in her car, in case of a quick outing to the springs. You can hire noodles at Berry Springs. We stopped at the pub on the way for lunch, however there are bbqs and picnic grounds if you would like.  There are change rooms also.  We were there during the build up, and the springs weren't crowded at all, although the buses were pulling out when we got there. The scenery is fantastic, a true tropical experience."
298,Berry Springs,"Spent a few hours at Berry springs.  Son and Grandaughter loved it.Very clean and well maintained area,"
299,Perfect way to end our stay in Darwin,"Don't get me wrong, Litchfield is certainly a special place and one worth visiting, but Berry Springs has all of what Litchfield has with none of the frenetic tourist hustle and bustle. As soon as you dip below the surface of the crystal clear spring waters you are met with sense of warmth and peace. The spring keeps the water at a constant temperature year round. It's like being in a perfect bath, only with minature waterfall and tropical rainforest surrounding you. There are bbq facilities and ample space to share a picnic lunch and as soon as you have spent enough time in the sun drying off it's a perfect time to grab a floating noodle and head back in."
