28,Unique Structure,Your visit to Jaipur is incomplete without visiting Hawa Mahal. Its a palace with more than 900 windows which make it airy and comfortable even in the scorching heat of Jaipur. It was built for the royal ladies who could sit and watch the activities of the town without being watched by others.
29,"Expect it , when least expected.","Hawa mahal is synonymous with Jaipur but alas! The heritage monument is totally ruined by the apathy of shameless government. Full with dust, has turned black, full heavy traffic allowed right in front, countless shops opened right on the monument itself, dust and pollution at the peak... What a disappointment, in fact i felt so sad I left from the place immediately. And not to forget the greedy and rude cafe shops across the street, desperately wanting you to buy eatables from their cafe before you could click pictures of Hawa Mahal (don't go to the wind cafe, shameless and rude guys sitting on the stairs leading to their cafe confronting tourists)"

51,Very instagramable,"The famous hawa mahal- palace of winds is on the main road. So if you want to enjoy beauty , visit early morning timing with least traffic. Otherwise you'll be bothered by road Side shopkeepers. The palace was made for female of royalty to see without being seen.Five story tall the palace is made of famous pink and yellow sandstone.It's nearby Jantar mantar and city palace.So plan the visit to place accordingly."
52,Must see in Jaipur ,This place is historic the Hawa-Mahal as per the name its very windy in the high temperature of summers when we visited this place our guide told us that the so many windows are made for the queens of king Sawai pratap singh so his queens can see the festivals and the crowd‚Ä¶
53,Instagrammable Place in Jaipur - TheWickedSoul,"Hawa Mahal is a must see in Jaipur, but be ready to be packed in to get a view from its highest point.

54,Hawa Mahal,The most prominent structure on the main road for the ladies to view the processions from jharokaas.  Its a beautifully constructed and well maintained site.  For taking the full view of Hawa Mahal we had to cross the road and take pics from opposite side. Few friendly‚Ä¶

There are two side of hawa mahal one is the back and second one is inside it. The back part is what you will see the jharokhas and building structure and also there are cafes opposite to building you can eat and enjoy the view.
56,Hawa mahal,Want to see how queens and female relatives of king and his family see the functions of jaipur then go to this place.  it is still looks like someone watching you from the window of this palace.
57,Hawa hawai,"Hawa Mahal or the Palace of Wind is located in Jaipur(the pink city), in the Indian state of Rajsthan.   Made with the red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The structure was built in 1799‚Ä¶"
58,Nice,Hawamahal is very big with 1000+ windows.so it's called hawamahal and it is at the edge of road so it makes it beautiful.
59,Great night photo,It is a real hawa Mahal as it is look like standing in the sky as it is very high .It's design is amazing .i loved it
60,Worth a visit....,"This place is situated near to the main road, which is very crowded,easily accessible by public transportation, .It is known as crown of Jaipur city, very famous monument"
61,Classic ,The best time to visit Hawa Mahal is between month of October to March because the weather during this  place is considered to be pleasant.One of the historic place in Jaipur in the night it looks more beautiful in lights but you can't go inside after 6pm.
62,Impressive ,Hawa mahal is more than what meets the eye because it‚Äôs huge from inside with pretty carvings and tiny little windows everywhere! Try going on a weekday as it can get really crowded.
63,In awe,Hawa Mahal is a very amazing place for a tourist. Great for a amazing photos. It's very close to the pink city
64,beautiful facade,"Hawal Mahal is in the busy street with shops area. You need to be too early to get a clear pics of the monuments from outside or it should be on holiday. Inside Hawa Mahal, it has narrow passages resulting in too much crowd and it is advisable to avoid this place by elders /‚Ä¶"
65,Royal mahal,We strolled to the Hawa Mahal from the Laxmi Mishthan Bhandaar. The Mahal is in the shape of Lord Krishna's crown. It's jharokhas (windows) on its decorated facade. Do note that it's almost impossible to find this place sans people.  We chose not to go inside though.
66,More than what meets the eyes,Amazing place and was a wonderful experience. My kids were very happy visiting the place. The place is situated in heart of the city Jaipur. 
67,A piece of Architecture beauty,"Visited this place on 2/2/20 ...Its in the tripolia bazar area of jaipur..Its an heritage marvel build by H.H.Sawai Pratap Singh Ji in 1799,having a  huge pink stone structure with numerous small windows, It does has a historic significance,build by the maharaja for his queens .‚Ä¶"
68,Not what I expected,"I would say that the Hawa Mahal is Jaipur's most distinctive landmark, delicate honeycombed lattice towering 5 stories.  Built in 1799 so that the royal Ladies could view the town/street below.   The entrance is located in the back.    50 rupees for general admission/ about .70‚Ä¶"
69,Brief stop is all that is needed,"The Palace of the Wind was on our tour guide itinerary.  It is the most recognised facade in Jaipur and is therefore a must see. It is built beside a busy road and reflects the colour of the famous pink city.Our guide did not take us in as the beauty of the building is in the facade.  It is very shallow (single depth) and houses only rooms used as viewing galleries from which women were able to watch the grand processions in the times when they could not be seen in public.We were there for about ten minutes and that included finding somewhere to park,"
70,Correctly the visual symbol of the pink city!,i think one should visit jaipur in rainy season when wecwere on top of hawa mahal. the view of jaipur was outstanding. When the winds blows in these jharakos. it feels lovely
71,Great architecture!,This is the most iconic structure of Jaipur and is a must visit place for a photo or two. Mind you it is situated is the middle of the craziest traffic you will ever come across. Hawa Mahal is a five story building in the heart of the city of Jaipur. It has a beehive like‚Ä¶
72,Nice and fabulus.,The iconic image of Jaipur. Even from the outside it is impressive. Looks great in the evening. A great shopping strip as well
73,Pretty ,A beautiful building to visit and it is worth visiting BUT it is in a very busy road and its best to try to cross the road to take photos from the other side. It‚Äôs also very pretty at night when its all lit up too. 
74,Beautiful,The Hawa Mahal was built to allow royal household ladies watch the world and processions etc watch the world go by without being seen. Now just a facade but you can climb right up to the fifth floor and have fantastic views over a Jaipur. A must see ! 
75,Nice place,"Hard to believe the Palace of the Winds sits on a busy street in Jaipur.  Impressive Structure with amazing beauty.Hawa Mahal is a palace in Jaipur, India. Made with the red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur.Worth a visit even if only a short time in front."
76,Hawa mahal,One of the iconic places and most photographed palace in jaipur. Not sure whether you can get in. Most people just stand and take pictures from the road
77,One of the previous historical sites in Jaipur,"Jaipur visit has a royal feel to it and the trip is not complete without visiting the iconic Hawa Mahal. The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. The design of the palace allowed the royal ladies to view processions and everyday festivities without being seen by the common man. The architecture of the palace is such that it remains cool inside even in the scorching summers thanks to the Venturi effect. Your visit to Jaipur has to include this wonderful palace which is the heart of Jaipur city."
78,"Great Architecture, View",Great palace and great to visit. Took an rickshaw from Jantar Mantar to Hawa Mahal.Highly recommended though the location is crowded.
79,Amazing Palace,It is must see piece of architecture because the name suggests that lot of air flows through it when the heat is blowing in open area. It is a land mark beauty of Pink City.
80,Architectural marvel!,"many windows in one tower look too beautiful .as this monument also has too many windows in,  it looks too beautiful   and the amazing also .hawa mahal is  one of the   best places for enjoyment place"
81,Incredible,"Hawa Mahal  - The Synonym  For Pinkcity.  It will make you feel proud about the Royal culture and rich heritage of Rajasthan, Situated at the center of the city, it is the must visit if you are planning to visit  in near future "
82,Signature of Jaipur,This is the main place which named the city Pink city. One must roam around the whole place to unearth mystries and histories.
83,Interesting Architecture,Nice Palace where the royals used to peep from to see their ordinary subjects. Lovely 5 storey building. 
84,turism,"Iconic facade like structure is truly beautiful to behold. Located on a busy street, makes it unpleasant to stay longer. Beggars, and hawkers won't leave you alone, and don't you dare take a photo of those snake charmers unless you expect to pay... Pity "
85,Quick Photo Opportunity ,Architecture of the building is very amazing it is really perfect place for visitors also foreigners
86,Photo stop,"With a history of over 200 years, Hawa Mahal is perhaps the most iconic monument in Jaipur. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of ""purdah""."
87,Impressive facade,The structure is beautiful but unfortunately very difficult to photograph since it‚Äôs right on a busy street.  There are also lots of people selling unwanted things in the area.  I didn‚Äôt have time to go inside but would have loved to.  
88,You must see this incredible architectural masterpiece!,"Always had seen Hawa Mahal from the road side , went last week inside from backside. The view is much better . We hired local guy who explained about this Mahal. It is good and worth visit"

90,Wind Palace ,If you want to see complete old Jaipur than you should go on to the top of this palace. Generally people take pic only from outside but from inside also it is good to see
91,Wondering place,The palace of the winds is highly touted in guide books. It is nice but a single portion of the palace in a somewhat run down portion of the old city. It is really only a facade and about a ten minute stop. If you are in Jaipur it is worth seeing but I would not go there just to see it.
92,Windy Palace,Go to the roof top place just in front to capture at night . There is good cafe also here . The lightings make it look marvelous.
93,The whow ambiance,"From the outside, Hawa Mahal does not look that big but actually it is reasonably large and if one wants to see all with audio guides, it will take at least an hour and a half. Also, the entrance to the Mahal is not at the front, which is the front facade of the Mahal which‚Ä¶"
94,Everything was good but Jaipur police in the city ask for money,It looks awesome from outside. Inside view is also good. you can see Ariel view of nearby jantar mantar
95,"Symbol of Jaipur , every visitor of Jaipur pays a short visit ",The best time to visit is early morning as this place is always packed with tourists. Being on the main road it's packed. The architecture of it was very beautiful and intricate. The inside of the Mahal is nice. Although people say it's not worth going inside but I went inside‚Ä¶
96,Gorgeous Pink Facade,Beautiful from outside only but nothing inside.. People waste time and money to climb stairs whereas it's beautiful look is from outside only. Best view from opposite road. 
97,Best Thing In Jaipur!,The building is nice but the cost of the entrance is between 2000 and 3500 rupees. The museums are an additional 700rupees. Since this is the main attraction of Jaipur they take advantage of it.
98,A Feeling of Royalty And Medival Architecture,"It's very charming , and nicely keep t heritage and nearby market is very fantastic n well preserve the old charm"
99,Go to the cafe across the street,Must see especially at night when the monument is beautifully light up. The facade is gorgeous. The entire area is bustling with activity.
100,Beautiful and Pink,"Hawa mahal, with 953 windows was built so that royal ladies could observe everyday street life without been seen. It is shaped like lord Krishna's crown and is the world tallest building without a foundation! Its located beside one of the busy streets so watch your back when you‚Ä¶"
101,One of the must place to go in Jaipur,"Hawa Mahal architecture is great with winds flowing from all side. The only thing i sould suggest/ask people visiting is to maintain decorum , when we visited some of the crowds were nosiy. "
102,Art of piece,Great architecture! Must visit if ypu are visiting Jaipur for the first time! Perfect for clicking photos and instagramming!
103,Amazing ,"Important building, built so women could view street without being seen. The front is just a facade nothing at the back.Good view at street level but you can get a better view from terrace of restaurant opposite."
104,Kya Baat Hai. iT'S MESMERISING,Nicely  architectured  for  crossing  air.hawamahal must be visited  but  not good  place to spent  much time.it is good  pcs of ecofriendly  architecture  and represents  life of peoples  who lives here in past.nearby market is based  on tourist so prices  are not good enough  and much bargain prices. Also quality  should  be taken care.
105,Great views from the top,"This is a very busy area of Jaipur, but worth taking the time to find a spot without being run over to admire it. Watch yourselves if you try to have a coffee from the buildings opposite, you will find you pay a lot for the view. I enjoyed a walk around this whole area of the‚Ä¶"
106,Where is mahal,Interesting place to visit.  Nice historic palace  overlooking street market. Interesting architecture and good views overlooking court yard
107,Hawa Mahal...An architectural marvel....Indeed Beautiful,We decided to visit this beautiful building at night. Glad we did as it really does the colours justice.  The street is bustling as everywhere is in an Indian city.  We took photos right there but then went to a rooftop cafe and had a drink and got the best view.
108,Drive by for a look,I went to Hawa Mahal and it do not allow to get inside.  You could take picture outside and the best place is coffee shop on the opposite of Hawa Mahal in which you could get the good view and photo there.  This place is one of the must go while you are in Jaipur.
109,The Beehive,"Went here but palace on a very busy street, we couldn‚Äôt go in but was a stunning piece of architecture.  Jaipur is a breath of fresh air after Delhi"
110,View from the front,"This is where the women used to watch the parades without being seen. The facade is stunning, but it is not worth entering. A good photo can be got from the Tattoo cafe or Wind View cafe opposite."
111,Surprising gem on the side of the road,Architectural wonder but can be maintained better. Very crowded and trash all over. I only wish Indian government can take care of these places with very good care!!
112,Fascinating visit,"As our tour group bus traveled along Hawa Mahal Road in Jaipur city center, we came across the stunning facade of the Hawa Mahal or ""Palace of Wind"".  It was said that this structure was designed to allow breezes or wind to easily travel through the building to serve as a‚Ä¶"
113,Visiting,"Hawa Mahal or ""The Palace of Winds"" in English was a palace of the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh of Jaipur and included quarters for ladies, which is the most notable part of the palace. The facade is a very distinctive multi-storey windows of intricate lattice work that extends‚Ä¶"
114,Hawa hawai! Its a place only in facade. ,"Visited this and was told by most of locals that it has a better view from outside than really inside, but as a tourist you want to venture into everything and we did the same. Should have listened to locals, it is a great sight to see, click picture and admire the architecture."
115,Five minute tuck tuck photo stop. ,The place was very beautiful and the guards were very kind and helpful looking so amazing place with the history
116,Beautiful Palace on the busy street or ancient highway to City Palace,Spectacular view had a great time with family. Architecture of the place is amazing but being in city it was a long journey.
117,Hawa Mahal ,"Erected circa 1799 by Sawai Pratap Singh. Very ornate facade. For the ladies of the harem to peer out of! 5 storeys high, one room deep. You can pay to enter (around 180 rupees each) but we went round the street side to photograph."
118,Hawa Mahal,"It's really a great place to visit, nice view of and from inside and outside. I loved this place the most in Jaipur. If you are in Jaipur, must visit here. "

120,Truly the icon of Jaipur,Hawa Mahal looks fabulous from outside.one must go inside and climb to the top.there is a ramp so climbing is easy.the view from all angles is amazing
121,Jaipuri Pinki style wall,Everyone I think will associate The Palace of the Wind when they think of Jaipur. On my last visit here nearly 25 years ago I was lucky enough to see part of the interior with it's beautiful paintings and artwork but this time it was just a quick stop in a few tuk tuks while our‚Ä¶
122,Beautiful Wall Amidst the Hustle Bustle,"its just a wall with small windows, in the middle of the shopping area, u can go & see it ...take a pic and do your shopping, u should enquire abt item in 3 or 4 shops and buy , if they say, Rs.100... start your bargain with Rs.20/-, simply we are in trap, on their lucky day...if we are booked"
123,Interesting palace,"Beautiful building located on a busy street with difficult access, limited parking. Worth stopping to get a picture. Many shops in the area with Indian products - shoes dresses foods"
124,Nice ornate facade. ,The visit to Hawa Mahal was interesting.The intricate stone carvings of theMahal is worth-seeing. The Mahal looksnice with the lights in the night. Overall theplace is worth-visiting.
125,Best place for photos.,The front of the wind palace is a gorgeous pink color. It is best viewed in the morning between 10am and noon from the cafes directly across the street on the second/third floor. However you will have to purchase something from the cafe to enjoy the view. On an adjacent side‚Ä¶

129,Nice art,Amazing and super romantic. Perfect spot for pictures. Very suggested to go inside. Beautiful view of the city from the top
130,A Glorious Monument,There is nothing much to see here apart from the beautiful frontal  facade and the area is very crowded.Very interestingly the building does not have a foundation and attempts to mimic lord krishnas crown
131,Historic,"The balcony is beautiful from both sides. You need to visit inside to see the balcony and get the view the royal ladies had of the festivities from here. There‚Äôs also a small collection of statues celebrating music and dance. From the windows you get far vistas of Jaipur too. You can spot the Victory tower, Jantar Mantar and the city palace. When you‚Äôre done make sure to go yo the frontside to see the stunning architecture from the street. Going to one of the rooftop cafes is an option."
132,A worthwhile short stop,The architecture of this place is absolutely beautiful! Totally recommend to stop at least to admire the beauty of the building.
133,Worthless,Hawa Mahal must be one of the signature places when you talk about Jaipur. Do not think that you would ever want to miss Hawa Mahal. The palace is like a Jharoka for the erstwhile ladies of the royal family to see the proceedings on the road. Even now the busy main road with‚Ä¶
134,Beautiful Building,"The architecture of palace is worth watching. However, there is tremendous traffic outside and roads are narrow. Nothing much to see inside."
135,So beautiful win please..,"Although we could not spend time going inside the Palace, it's a piece of Beautiful Architecture. Some time you Wonder about the Level of architectural skills of ancient India!!!"
136,Visit,The Palace of Wind has a magnificent facade which is best viewed from a distance - although the best place is the adjacent main road and busy market. This facade was built to allow the women of the royal court to watch (from the many windows) parades and other outdoor events in‚Ä¶
137,Better on the outside,My 2 nd visit to Jaipur but still police man in the city stop for no reason ask for all documentation and I have shared but still they didn‚Äôt given my documents they given by when I have given Brie üòÇüòÇHawa hamal is very place to visit I have given 200 üò†üò†üò†üò†and don‚Äôt like the attitude of police against tourists ü§¨
138,"Bit disappointing, basically an empty building.",Good and one of the must do places in Jaipur. Get a combo ticket which allows access to 6-7 other good sites  A audio guide seemed worth but the information isn't that great but still not bad to get one  There place is maintained well and is definitely worth a visit
139,Great for a nighttime photo ,"Not only do foreign tourists get charged four times as much to enter the ‚Äòpalace‚Äô as Indian nationals. The people at the ticket booth refused to give us our change, charging us an additional 100rs.   In a country where you are scammed every second of every day for being a‚Ä¶"
140,A Standout Architectural Masterpiece of the Pink City,On our city tour we stopped to admire this icon of Jaipur.  In our four day stay we seemed to always be driving by.  It does not disappoint.
141,Just a Facade,"Historic architecture with great stories within its campus ,clearly shows how people were more artistic and  a greater architecture than today"
142,Haha Mahal. ,Such a stunning building! The contrast of such a building popping up in such a crowded street makes this worth view from the outside even if you don‚Äôt go in... 
143,See this in the morning to get the best photos,"Very nice architectural property. Amazing to see such property constructed showing the level if technology at that time. Parking is an issue,as area is too much crowded "
144,Wow palace,"Enjoyed the quirky details of the structure, fantastic view points of the city and the fort. Can be very busy. "
145,Spend an hour here,"I have been to Hawa Mahal or ""Wind Palace"" umpteen times. What I like most is the terracotta pink colour. A must visit place for photographers,just in front of the palace cross the road are 2-3 cafeteria so just go their for a cup of coffee or tea and you can find some beautiful‚Ä¶"
146,Great Experience with Hawa mahal & jaipur weather also.,The most of the tourist don't go inside best to be enjoyed the beauty of it from the front cafes. ...
147,get there early,"When you visit the pink city of Jaipur,be ready to see many wonderful sights.  One, in particular, caught my attention because of its interesting shape, color and design. It's known as Hawa Mahal,The Palace of Winds and reminded me of a buzzing beehive.  Why a beehive you may‚Ä¶"
148,As Name Suggests,"It's good place to reach easily, i have taken  300rs ticket from the Alberto Museum itself, so it was easy to get in"
149,Hawa Mahal,"It is a nice historic site attached to the Hawa Mahal Road. You should start by clicking pictures from across the street.  Once done cross the street again, you have to go around the property to buy entry ticket. It costs Rs. 50 per person. You can also opt for audio guide by‚Ä¶"
150,Beautiful architecture from Outside,Only stopped to take photos of the facade. Very beautiful.Very busy street. Lots of sellars and a snake charmer
151,one of the best,This place looks beautiful from both inside and outside. It looks stunning from outside at night. This is a must visit place in Jaipur
152,Visit,"we could only view this building from the outside, its situated on a very busy road but definitely worth a look."
153,Get a combo ticket,"Just took pictures on the outside building with the Tour Guide as it was already late in the evening but its beautiful and amazing. Lots of local shopping, if you wish on this street on both sides. Do bargain hard."
154,An architectural marvel,This is one of an ancient monument built in 1799 and renovated in 2006. The architectural feature allows cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through the structure which makes the whole area more pleasant during high temperatures in summer. This is why it is named as Hawa‚Ä¶
155,Excellent architecture,"We loved our visit to the Hawa Mahal in Jaipur.  We were advised to go early and get a view of the facade from the multi-level coffee shops across the street which we did.  These places were already teaming with people when we arrived but we still were able to manage unobstructive shots of the facade which was nice.  We were advised there was nothing worthwhile to look at inside the palace, however we decided to go anyway and we're glad we did.  We found a multi-layered building with amazing shots of the facade from the rear and the grounds in general which we loved.  I would advise purchasing a multi-stop pass so you can tour all the palaces in one inclusive price.  It's best ot park near the City Palace and walk 5-10 min. to reach Hawa Mahal."
156,Hawa Mahal visit,I am absolutely shocked to see this magnificent Mahal. This was my first experience to see this beauty. The place is situated in a heart of the city
157,Honeycomb facade,A beautiful.monument on the main road .... one cannot visit it from within as its beauty possibly is only appreciated with the external fresco.  The govt could do more to revive this structure to its former glory 
158,Very attractive architecture,This would be the first place I‚Äôd recommend to see in Jaipur. This spectacular architecture literally takes breaths away!
159,As crowded as the roads ,"This palace of winds palace was built for the royal ladies, a safe harbour.  Intricately designed windows allowed them to watch daily life without being visible to the public.It's basically a tall screen wall built of pink and red sandstone. Unique. Beautifully decorated  facade that resembles a honeycomb.  In my option,  the best view is from the cafe across the street.  If you're not in a rush, bypass  the curio shops and climb the stairs to the cafe (go to the very top).  Be still, and soak in the view.Last tip....be mindful of the best time for pics."
160,A marvelous Palace,I believe the only was to visit this is by viewing it from the street in front of it because it is only a facade.  The story behind it which our guide told us made it very interesting but with the back story or not it is simply beautiful to see in person.
161,Great place,This building has a real charm that attracts you and makes you feel awesome. Its wonderful feeling going up one floor to another. We enjoyed a lot with our 5 year old daughter. A visit to Jaipur is incomplete  without a trip to Hawa Mahal.
162,A Must See,Hawa Mahal dates to 1799 when it was constructed for Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh as part of the women‚Äôs section of the City Palace. There are purported to be 953 windows in the lace like structure of the fa√ßade which was designed to allow the women of the royal court to watch activities in the street streets unobserved behind the latticework. beautiful structure in hues of red and pink.
163,Only click photo from outside,The view from the outside road is the impressive part of the building  Have dinner in the tattoo bar opposite
164,Super experience and worth visiting ,"A spot not to be missed while visiting Jaipur. I would recommend paying the ticket and going inside as it I really special architecture. The windows are adorable and details on walls and doors inside the palace are worth seeing. Also, you can see the great panoramic view of the‚Ä¶"
165,Just another building on the road,An amazing place with amazing view. The view from across the road is fantabulous. It reminds you of the rich historical heritage of jaipur. A must visit place if you are in jaipur.
166,"Nice place, elderly and folks with knee problems avoid",It is not able to took pic ...situated in main road ...not able to cover the  area picture ...it is situated in busy street....
167,Hawa Mahal,Our driver told us not to visit Hawa Mahal n just had a glance from outside..we as a traveler believed him.but in the last day of our Jaipur trip we visited it n believe me it's just amazing..every1 visiting jaipur should enter at hawa Mahal otherwise u'll miss something really‚Ä¶
168,Really hawa mahal,"On a recent holiday in India, we visited the Palace of the Wind. The architecture of this building is amazing and definitely reminds me of a big slab of honeycomb. We visited this both during the day and when it was all lit up at night..... it was stunning.Perfect place for great photos and it is a great example of what the Pink City of Jaipur is all about."
169,Beautiful,Beautiful building front. Definatly worth 10 mins of your time to tick of the Checklist. It is in front of a busy road and hard to park.
170,Tour,"We just saw the Hawa Mahal from the outside and admired its wonderful architecture. It looked much smaller than I had imagined it to be. Although, we had tickets to go inside, it was so hot and we were so tired from all our sightseeing, that we chose to skip it."
171,Nothing to see interior,Amazing place one of the my favorite place wind please this is very famous I was with my girlfriend she is crazy about this palace inside so so good but when you see outside it's so beautiful no one can compare to this palace ..
172,Not tourist-friendly at all,"If you are heading to Jaipur this is undoubtedly on your list of places to see, & it is so worthy.More than just a beautiful facade ~I wasn't sure if we would go in or not but so glad we did - the whole place is quite amazing & so beautiful, which also offers spectacular views over to Nahargahr Fort & into Jantar Mantar aswell as across to the bustling streets. Tip~  get the audioguide for some context  & take your own headphones."
173,Interesting but underwhelming ,You can stop to view this very ornate facade. It's only a facade built by a king who had it built so that his royal females could view any events down below on the street through small holes in the facade so they couldn't be seen from the public outside. Worth a visit. 
174,No photo face,It‚Äôs a beautiful palace... but the beauty is only from outside. Make sure you carry a selfie stick for a full photo view. The best time to visit is dusk. Pictures during day and night are totally different.
175,Fairytale and beautiful ,This beautiful wall was constructed to give a view to the poor women of the palace who were trapped inside. I was lucky enough to get an inexplicable nighttime shot capturing the overwhelming shadow of one person praying.  Our tour guide and driver said that I captured a ghost. 
176,Beautiful architecture,Beautiful architecture in Jaipur. Perfect for taking photos. Drive by sight. Takes a few minutes to view.
177,Impressive architecture,For indian nationality adult ticket is 50 rs per person.5 years old kids are free.and students id get have discount for entry tickets.
178,shopping view only,"For those of us who have grown up learning about Hawa Mahal with the picture of its iconic facade, the reality is a bit underwhelming. The facade, though, is a beautiful sight at night when it is lit up in its full glory.  The narrow passageways tend to result in ‚Äúpedestrian‚Ä¶"
179,Not that exciting as it was in history books,it was built in 1799. the original intention of the palace was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life in the street below without being seen.hawa mahal is great .really liked
180,Too much traffic,Really nice building from the outside as well as from the inside! Also go to one of the coffee places across the street for an even better view!
181,Amazing front side,"The fort has interesting history. However, it is prettier to look from outside than inside. I assume in summer it is more fascinating since it keeps the rooms cold. In general most of it seems to need reconstruction. "
182,Wonderful architecture,We had imagined that the palaces and historic buildings we would see in India would be displayed in the way these things are in Europe and Australia.  With relevant inscriptions and descriptions of the rooms and the people who lived there.  Usually some relevant artefacts with‚Ä¶
183,Facade only ,Excellent architecture and concept...was amazed to see this monument. Very well maintained. Definitely worth a visit
184,Impressive Beauty,"Visiting ‚ÄúThe Palace of Winds"" or ‚ÄúThe Palace of Breeze""(built in 1799) is worth it to enjoy unusual artistry with 953 windows with the intention of allowing royal ladies to observe everyday life without being seen. I have not seen such a site before. It was not crowded on our‚Ä¶"
185,Just from outside,Another spectacular place not to be missed. We really enjoyed the place and its more scenic from the side where you can see the coves small windows. its in the middle of a buzzing market place and there is lot of shops around this place. One can enjoy a drink in front of the palace and enjoy the view. Must visit.
186,City's Icon,"This you can just drive by slowly or get out and spend 5 minutes to take in the facade. It's where the princesses went to get a view of what was going on and not be seen, and it's only a few meters deep. There  is little behind it. It's very close to the pink city so do it with‚Ä¶"
187,Hawa mahal,What a delightful place. Amazing energy and treat to the eye. This place is a must for a traveller to visit at least once if not several times.
188,Iconic place of Jaipur not to be missed,For the best view you need to visit the cafe‚Äôs opposite the building which are up some steep stone steps Well worth the climb.  The architecture is so intricate but the busy road in front deflects some of it‚Äôs beauty. Well worth the visit.
189,ANCIENITY,"Since childhood, I had been seeing pictures of the pink Hawa mahal and it was a lifelong dream to visit the place . But sad to say I was sorely disappointed to see the actual place.I realised a good camera angle can make anything look good.  For those who plan to visit, there is‚Ä¶"
190,Better looking from outside than inside,Beware as this place is packed with tourist at all times.  The best time to visit would be early in the morning as the place would be less packed. The place is definitely beautiful but don‚Äôt even bother going into the Mahal because it‚Äôs empty inside and nothing much to see. The‚Ä¶
191,Hawa Mahal,I am in awe after I went here.  It gives a view into India's rich history.  An archaeological wonder. Must visit place.
192,Wonder on the busiest street of Jaipur,"This beehive shaped palace was built as an extension of the zenana (ladies quarters) of the city palace so that the royal women could watch life below without being seen.  It is on a really busy shopping street and difficult for a vehicle to stop, unfortunately, we didn't have a‚Ä¶"
193,Beautiful construction ,Iconic facade but only interesting feature is really from the street level as inside extremely plain.
194,Full of airüòÅüòÅ...,One of the most beautiful ancient architect i have ever seen....at the top of the building u can see the whole city...and that is the best feeling....i had gone with my freinds...and really such a great place
195,One stop,This monument is an architectural wonder once you start exploring. The entire monument has not used cement but some mysterious mix of ingredient... symbol of Jaipur
196,Stopped outside to take photos.,"The structure was interesting, but not so amazing. It is in the middle of a very crowded street, filled with lots of peddlers trying very aggressively to sell you things. No need to get out of the car... snap photos as you pass."
197,Crown of Jaipur,Beautiful building. We didn‚Äôt go in. It really is lovely to look at. The king used to live here at some times of the year. The honeycombs are so his wife‚Äôs could look on to the street without been seen.  Very pretty. 
198,A must watch in Jaipur,"That visible building that looks enormous, it is really not real. But it is a tourist destination. Thousands, if not millions flock here to see this place. There are many things to see in Jaipur. This is a must see. The place is declared by UNESCO as world heritage site. The‚Ä¶"
199,"Hawa Mahal , Jaipur - Face of the City .","Beautiful construction but beware of local guides, surrounding area is full of local items you need to bargain a lot. Must try kachori Kadhi just outside of Hawa Mahal on road side stall. "
200,Best viewed from  outside,An excellent spot for taking photos and selfies. Though parking is a problem at this spot. At night the place takes a different look thanks to the lighting.
201,Marvellous design,Nice decor of wind place .  Example of great artuculture ...enjoy with my team ..all were very happy with art of india
202,Beautiful structure but ill maintained ,This is an overhyped place. It is shown as if it is a big palace but it is a simple building. Avoid.
203,Beautiful facade,An impressive site of red and pink sandstone from it‚Äôs roadside location. Great architecture and well worth a visit when in Jaipur.
204,Beautiful fresco windos,Tad disappointing as not the crisp colours but still an amazing building and do go up to the windview cafe to get a good view.
205,Pride of Jaipur ruined by shameless government,"There isnt much to this place beyond the facade, lots of steps and the views. It was very busy but I understand that's routine.  There is some pretty stained glass. "
206,"""The Palace of Winds""",Very pretty but really a one room wide facade. Nice for a pic and takes 5 min. Watch out for lots of beggars
207,The Palace of Wind.,"The Hawa Mahal is an impressive facade. Guides are available if you want. However, considering the steep steps inside, I will not recommend this for elderly people."
208,magnificent structure,"Price for foreigners is $700 rupees per person the basic ticket, for what we see was good enough, there was another tickets with special rooms you can entered but where to expensive very big difference between the basic and something with more things available. What we see was‚Ä¶"
209,Best to visit from outside,Jaipur must visit place... it will take only 10 to 15 mins... just take a photo and move on... but try in both day light and night too. Here Iam attaching night effect
210,Amazing facade,"This is an example of unique, beautiful Indian architecture.  Try to at least stop on the street and look at it!  It sounds like it is only one room deep - and that the real beauty is the exterior."
211,very beautiful place,"This is a stunning piece of architecture, the area around it is busy and bustling and you really do not have enough eyes to see it all! Cross the road to see this at its best. A gentleman on one of the stalls offered to let us to go on his roof ,( free of charge he said) to see‚Ä¶"
212,Blah,Exterior is more impressive than interior but still it‚Äôs a must see! You can purchase the combo ticket for 1000 INR here and make your way to the other places from here. 
213,Hawamahal ,"This impressive facade house a small museum, reached from the rear.  Photographs are best taken from the opposite side of the road."
214,Expensive ,"This was a place where the royal women could go to watch the street scenes without being seen themselves. Go in the morning when the sun is on it. You can only really see the outside, but it is really beautiful."
215,Lovely place,"it‚Äôs just pretty on the photos. It‚Äôs really just the facade that is very popular but when you come and see it it‚Äôs not special at all. Worn out and dirty. I‚Äôd suggest you come visit it at night where there‚Äôs light on it, makes it look better but be careful in general. Could‚Äôve‚Ä¶"
216,Must not miss this attraction,It is  basically a fabulous architecture design with nothing behind it... Almost a facade on a very busy street
217,"Nice architecture, one can see it only from a distance ,no entry.","We visited Hawa Mahal with a lot of hope and anticipation. The first let-down was the one, single-window and long queue/wait of nearly 40 minutes to buy entry-tickets. The  beautiful frontage/courtyard has been defiled by vendors, eateries and shops. There are no guides readily‚Ä¶"
218,The Famous Hawa Mahal,"I loved this place. Beautiful. I could imagine the royal queens looking out over the square. Amazing structure, so much detail. Not sure if you could enter the Palace but I don‚Äôt think so. So glad I saw"
219,"Elegant and functional architecture,  a must see in Jaipur.","We did not go in to this building, however, was beautiful from outside.  Intricate architecture - certainly worth dropping by."
220,Drop by,"The entrance is in a really nice courtyard where people take time to sit and chat. ¬£2 for entrance. It‚Äôs a bewitching place as you move from one level to another up gentle inclines there is always something to see (and photograph!), from coloured glass to tiny windows which give‚Ä¶"
221,Nice building,We walked through the Pink City and stumbled across this palace. Quite a find. Very well kept on the road side. The Maharaja watched the processions from the safety of his palace from up on high.
222,Holiday of a lifetime,Marvelous architecture. Awesome views. Easy access. No parking nearby. Easier to engage local transportation to reach the place. 
223,Beautiful Architecture ,"After learning about it in school decades ago, it was great to see Hawa Mahal in person! Impressive architecture. You get great pictures from Tattoo cafe opposite The Mahal‚Äôs main entrance. We didn‚Äôt get a guide as it was nice to wander around at our own pace."
224,Amazing place ,Cannot say much more than what we saw from the street. Its a difficult place to stop at being on a busy dual carriageway. 
225,Foreign tourists should avoid brown ‚Äòpalace‚Äô,"Could have the pleasure of a day and a night view of the Hawa Mahal and it‚Äôs just awesome and spellbinding. Did a lot of shopping in the market surrounding the attraction especially the Jaipuri jooti, my favourite and the cute Rajasthani puppets too."
226,Beautiful building ,The surrounding has got cleaner with a little enclosure for selfie clickers. The monument has been very well maintained.
227,We visited hawa mahal as a couple,"Our guide stopped and we took some photos. Interesting historical place, the guide explained what it‚Äôs purpose was - there is nothing behind the lattice, it‚Äôs for the ladies of the court to be cool and not seen by the public. "
228,Beautiful,"very instragrammable one.  very colorful nice place even though we couldn't enter, certainly nice to see from outside."
229,Can only see from outside,This is an architectural wonder. The ambience inside is Royal. You feel like a King walking inside the palace. The whole palace is visible from the rooftop cafe opposite to it. It reminds you of the rich history of the place. A must visit place for all the history freaks.
230,Worth one,"I took a day tour with Royal Majestic Tours. The guide, Mukesh was truly excellent. Our first stop was at the beautiful Hawa Mahal - a truly impressive building with lots of windows. The history of the building is very interesting."
231,Beautiful architecture,You can't go in and have to stop outside on a very busy street to get your photo opportunity but it is worth it. Watch out for beggers who get their kids to cling to you when you stop for a pic and then demand you pay them for the kids being in the pic.
232,Visit,We visited here but the did't allowed to go inside.we clicked pics from outside .so I didt reviewed about the inside.
233,To be seen,"Take pictures from outside for sure, but do go inside, to the top and take a peek outside from many of the small windows that look out into the busy street down below."
234,Special site,Basically a beautiful wall built to house the ladies of the court. Nothing to do there but take a great photo at night.
235,Known as the Palace of the Winds,"I had lot of expectation when I started to this place, But when I reached there I could see that the mahal is on the main road with the entrance not marked. No where there was proper guidance. I personally feel that guests can skip this and visit jal mahal and amber fort. People who wants to shop can visit this place since there are lots of shops near by."
236,Special,One of the best experience in my life iwas there with my freinds we feel very good when we was seen uncrideble story about wind palace guide was explain everything about jaipur city ........
237,Great place to visit in Jaipur,"Even though it looks so grand and impressive from the outside, it's only a few metres wide inside so that the court ladies could look out to city life without being seen.  If you want a really good view, go to the cafe opposite where there is a perfect viewing spot."
238,Masterpiece,This is hard to view and appreciate from street level so it is best to get access at a higher floor from a cafe opposite.
239,really palace of wind,"Not much, very pretty, but only worth a 2 minute camera stop. The rest of the town is super filthy. Lots of garbage and beggars."
240,Ancient Monument,"It was built for the king‚Äôs wives to see him on the other side of the street. Just a quick photo on the street. No point to go in, since there‚Äôs nothing inside."
241,Disappointed,"The building is beautifully constructed. It looks nice from outside, but nothing to see from inside. Too much crowd and traffic on road."
242,Nice mahal,"When you will be going through the busiest street, you wont believe that you will find Hawa Mahal thereüòÅ. Entry fees is ‚Çπ50.   It will take you around an hour or so to explore and click amazing photos. Its a wind palace and we were there last week so it was a cold breeze all‚Ä¶"
243,Palace of the Wind,"Photographers get ready--it's tough to get a good shot of the Hawa Mahal in daytime or at night.  Lots of tourists, lots of traffic, but definitely worth seeing this iconic structure. I had the best luck at photographing it at night from a rooftop bar across the street.  It's‚Ä¶"
244,Brief photo stop,"I couldn‚Äôt understand why all of the photos I saw of this palace (‚ÄòPalace of the Winds‚Äô) were all of the facade and there were none of the interior. Now that I‚Äôve visited I understand why. This ‚Äòpalace‚Äô is really a giant facade with just two floors of, fairly ordinary rooms,‚Ä¶"
245,nice historical place,"We didn't go inside only drove by,  but what a stunning building. Not just in the day time, looks stunning on a night.  "
246,Wonderful piece of history,What a towering facet of this monument. It encompasses your sight and makes you feel that you are in it. A must for any body visiting this beautiful city.
247,Overhyped,"The earlier you are there, the less others tourists are there and that also means less street vendors and beggars. As it is only a facade, one quick picture across a very busy street and that's it."
248,Too much crowded,Having seen pictures of this before I traveled I did not expect it to be on a busy street. For best pictures you need to cross to the opposite side.
249,Classic Pink City,"We crossed the road from the same side as the Hawa Mahal was on, turned around and saw the full front of this iconic building which made me gasp in awe. Although it is more terracotta in colour than pink."
250,A casual visit to the main attraction of Jaipur ,"We were in Jaipur on part of the golden triangle tour and this was added to the itinerary as merely a photo stop. The light is best for photographing in the morning, dozens of tourist vehicles and busses stop just past the palace where everyone jumps out for a quick picture,‚Ä¶"
251,Windy it is,"The facade of this building is incredible with all of its intircate detail. It was so amazing we saw it twice. Well worth a look, even if you can't go inside and have to put up with the pushy touts at the street bazaar that runs outside it."
252,Tourist icon of Jaipur,"Very beautiful place but very poorly maintained. We visited at a time when it was the peak season time for travel. This could have made things worse for us, the place is not well run, people are not very nice. The staff and security who are supposed to help you do not care. ‚Ä¶"
253,A must not miss in busy Jaipur,"The structure, as you might have already seen in photos, is magnificent. However it's actual appearance is so so shabby and disappointing!! Covered with multiple layers of dust and with not even slightest sign of maintainance it's a pity that Government is not taking any action‚Ä¶"
254,Good photo opportunity ,A definite not miss but ensure you have a guide to provide the background! Lovely place and stunning at night- good photo ! 
255,Beautiful architectyral experience,I am particularly shocked about the magnificence and looks of this Mahal. This was my first experience to see an illustrious mahal. The Mahal is comprised of Red and Pink sandstones which give a decent look to the building. I prescribes all of you to visit this Hawa mahal in the‚Ä¶
256,Very interesting,Most of the day tour operators wouldn't take you inside hawa mahal. But I would recommend to visit it from inside. It's worth it. Especially to see how the walls and windows are designed. Actually these designs can be used in modern structures to provide ventilation. Also the‚Ä¶
257,Just wonderful,...with an impressive 'front of the house' architecture. Worth seeing both during the day and at night to gain very different perspective. A favourite location for photo opportunities. Most visitors to Jaipur will come to see the front of the building and not exploring the‚Ä¶
258,Beautiful architecture ,"It's right on a road side, which is a very busy street. Extremely worthless ticket fare as well. Price should reduce. "
259,Hawa Mahal photo stop,"Beautiful, gorgeous, tremendous the art off ancient times was on another level, I must say that.Whenever I got visit to Jaipur this place is always on my list."
260,Hawa Mahal the best place in jaipur ,"This is a stunning building, correctly compared with a honeycomb. Only a pity that it's so close to a major street - so carefully cross the street and take a look at larger distance as well. My guide said that it's not worthy to enter, so we didn't.BTW: ""pink"" is not really pink, it's rather ""terra cotta"" colour."
261,Day Visit to Hawa Mahal,Your taxi driver will not allow you to spend time here. It's a place to spend 45 to 50 minutes atleast.
262,very interesting piece of architecture,"The Palace of the wind is really just the front of a building as shown on the photo, I gather that you can go inside but but we didn't bother, instead we and across the road for a cuppa at one of the two restaurants plying for your business.  Ideally see this first thing in the‚Ä¶"
263,Stunning ,We saw this from the front only one day with a tour but then came back the next to go inside. Lovely and unusual place. Entrance is behind the facade. There is a open arch twenty or so feet to the right that you follow to the back and to the left.
264,Hard to see it all from the street,Really impressive facade! Difficult to get good photos of without other people or cars in it though.
265,Stunning architecture,It's a good place to click photo. Not recommend to go inside and waste time.  You can try the local food they provide near to mall.  Spend more time at jantar mandatharam instead
266,enjoyable visit !,"Essentially a series of viewing Windows for royal women to view celebrations below whilst remaining out of sight, this is a fantastic facade and well worth spending time photographing. Care - the street is very busy."
267,Jaipur diaries,Oh god what a view such an epic piece of art. Reminds us how talented were those artists who built it.
268,Worth a look,It's not as good from the inside as it is from the outside. Rather try to go to a cafe right in front of the palace and have a coffe/beer and enjoy the view while you rest.
269,Architecture at it's best,"We didn‚Äôt go in, as per what we saw in other reviews. But the building is amazing and worth visiting, even if just from the outside."
270,Stunning,We came upon this by accident just exploring the area and immediately realised it was a stunning building in the level of detail and colours particularly the pink facade.
271,Wonderful architecture ,"I will come again, it has such a beautiful interior! The staircase and pathways indoors were a maze, and I loved the little windows that opened to the street. It‚Äôs a good place to imagine life of the past!"
272,Architectural masterpiece ,"Do not be fooled, this us not a building.  It is merely a facade --- and a magnificent one --- attached to the palace, so the royal women could look out up-on the world and not be scene.  It is the signature site of Jaipur in the Old City.  If you are lucky, you will find snake‚Ä¶"
273,Wow,well for starters... i was not expecting this heritage classic to be found on a busy street .. the government should at least ensure that there are no hawkers or peddlers below this majestic structure .. absolutely awesome experience but somewhat subdued in real life than in‚Ä¶
274,great architecture,"We only stopped outside the Hawa Mahal to take the necessary photo, and instead of taking just 1, we found ourselves taking several from all manner of angles. The building is a real feat of physics/angles and you can‚Äôt help but try and capture as many of them as you can."
275,Busy but interesting,"Dusty, dirty, noisy street full of begging children. Interesting architecture but not renovated at all."
276,Good Architecture,"What makes this palace so eye-catching is the lacy ornamental facade accented by delicate latticework and honeycomb windows. If you want to get some nice pictures, go  early in the morning when there are not too many people and not so much traffic. We did not go inside so not‚Ä¶"
277,Impressive facade,"We just stopped along the road to see this and take photos and it‚Äôs definitely worthwhile if you‚Äôre already seeing sights in Jaipur, especially if you‚Äôre focusing on the history of the ‚Äúpink‚Äù In the pink city."
278,Hawa Mahal,"The place is not as nice as the buzz about it, but it is good if you want your pictures clicked.the place is in centre of city, so it is easily approachable, but beaware of the traffic."
279,Interesting Structure,"A very badly kept and maintained monument with nothing much to do or see, its visited only because there is nothing much to see in Jaipur. Rs. 50 is entry charge, but given its condition,i would not go again even for free. Skip if u cn,just hv a look frm outside."
280,Fantastic Trip,"An architectural masterpiece with history. It does not require much time, but it is of interest. Must visit."
281,Heart of Pink City,We only saw this from a distance and didn‚Äôt actually go in but it looked enchanting.  A great photo op.
282,Iconic structure in Jaipur,good historical plac to visitbeutyamazingeasy to go cheep ticketsvery smart photos and viewsthanks
283,Beautiful enough ,"We were told that the interior was just ok, so we stopped breifly for a photo. Absolutely beautiful architecture. A little crowded on a busy street, so be patient for your photos. There are cobra snake charmers on the sidewalk across the street for additional photo opportunities, at a small cost of course. Worth the stop."
284,Must visit at night. With beautiful lighting,We just walked past. Took some photos and we left.  To many people trying to sell you anything - its overwhelming and tiring. 
285,Palace of Winds!,It is advisable to go in the morning to beat the crowds. I arrived about 10.30am and was able to walk around easily without too many people which really made a difference to enjoying this beautiful place.
286,Must see,"Although you get a sense of the palace from the road, it‚Äôs only by exploring behind the facade that you get a sense of this truly wonderful building. Make sure your phone is charged - this is one of the most photogenic palaces I‚Äôve ever visited."
287,Jaipur trip,We didn‚Äôt go inside but instead went to one of the cafes across the road to admire this beautiful building.
288,Amazing view,The tour bus just dropped us by the roadside and then it was a scramble to cross a choke filled road to take a photo of the building. The reality; it is along a very busy street and what I have seen in tourist brochures does not reflect the serenity and calm. Even the colour of the building is not true to the actual colour. We spend more time haggling with street sellers than the photoshoot of the building.
289,Lovely to see - from the street,this was the best trip i have ever been to. The guide was very humble and polite. Had a mind boggling experience on the entire trip of jaipur. A must visit place foe all ppl. Excellent service. Thanks for this wonderful experience.
290,For the royal ladies,All I can say is you need to be standing in front of it to appreciate its beauty. Head across to The Tattoo Cafe & Lounge for perfect shots of Taj Mahal
291,beautiful facade with interesting story,"Our guide didn't want us to enjoy this classic  in the Pink City , probably because no tip was involved ?  But we got the bus to stop and got to enjoy what is a fabulous facade and an endearing piece of architecture !"
292,Must see.,"Great for a quick photo. I didn't go in myself. The reviews are mixed on that and I had limited time and a long list of things to see. That being said , if your in Jaipur you are almost obliged to at least give it a quick look"
293,Architecture at its Best,I would recommend a visit as it is rather beautiful with lots of nooks and crannies to explore.   Ladies note there seemed to be a separate queue for tickets which might just speed your entry even if you are travelling as a couple. Entry fee is 200 INR for foreigners. I would‚Ä¶
294,Beautiful ,"Don't quite know what the whole hype really is about this place....just another structure on the road. In fact, if the driver doesn't tell you, chances are you will not even notice it."
295,amazing building,A very pleasing-to-the-eye building! The windows served as a look-out to the outside world for the ladies behind their veils.
296,Rajput Architecture wonder,"Do not skip visiting it from inside. Well maintained. A note: box office is hardly visible, and do count your money. I think it is always good to have exact cash"
297,View of Hawa Mahal,"Maybe we should have had a guide to explain more about this but, after all the hype, it was a bit disappointing. Maybe we missed the point."
298,Beautiful Monument,Don't hesitate. Go!!!   And then have a drink and/or a snack opposite in one if the caf√©s. Best views.
299,Culture ,Looks nice but don't waste too much time here if you're on a short visit. This is a stop option on the tuck tuck day tour which I highly recommend. See one of my other reviews for the company we used.
