0,finest walk? More likely most overrated,"Do the Milford Track, they said. It's the ""finest walk in the world"", they said.  Hardly ever in my life have I been more disappointed. I was partly disappointed in myself because I believed the hype about the track, but mostly because the Milford Track is just not worth the effort, the money nor the time.  Be aware: The Milford Track is located in one of the wettest places in the world. This alone should make you suspicious. The marketing people at DOC back in the day probably thought let's try and sell the wettest place in New Zealand by calling the Track the ""finest in the world"". Well, it should be called ""wettest in the world"". The problem is: You have to book so early in advance you never know what the weather will be like. Most likely it will pour down.  This means not only will you definitely get wet, you will get soaked, even if you have good gear. Because good rain gear will protect you from the rain, but you'll sweat because that gear won't let air out, so you'll get soaked from the inside (even if it's cold outside). And you can't dry your clothes or shoes, because the huts are not equiped for that. So be prepared to walk in wet shoes for three or four days. The DOC folks in Te Anau called the wetness ""part of the fun"". Yeah, good fun indeed for an hour, but certainly not for three days.  Another thing: You basically walk in a forest the entire time. All you see is bush and more bush with one or two clearings per day. It's nice bush, but after hours and hours in it it would be nice to see mountains or something else. And on the MacKinnon pass it probably rains so even there, where you're meant to have a beautiful view, you'll most likely see a wall of grey 50m in front of you. So if you're into views: Definitely don't do it. You'll be disappointed, no question.  Ah yes, have I mentioned the sandflies? As soon as you want to have a break, they attack you. So don't even think about having a peaceful lunch time break. You'll just want to eat your sandwich as quickly as possible and then carry on - screaming children for an entire night are more peaceful and enjoyable than that.  So no, never in my life would I recommend this walk. DOC does an awesome job at PR for a terrible track. I'm sure every time someone books it they laugh and say: ""Look, we've sold the wettest and most overrated walk in the world to another idiot!"" Don't buy it! There are dozens of walks alone in NZ that are nicer than the Milford, try them!…"
1,Magical,"I never could understand why the Milford Track was considered one of the best treks in the world until I did it... with Ultimate Hikes. The track itself is beautiful, and the scenery just one of the most diverse and lush one could ask for, but the hike with Ultimate Hikes raised it ever so much more! Just follow their instructions and you would be adequately equipped and not feel much burden to carry!The accommodation throughout the trek were well appointed, and the service and food way above expectation! The guides are well trained, and every so excited to share their knowledge and love of the Milford Track with you.Absolutely recommended!"
2,"Excellent service of Ultimate hike - guided walk for Milford Track, the only one I will recommend","We did the Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes out of Queenstown.  Just can't say enough good things about how they treated us.  Excellent food, great accommodations each night, the best guides you could ever have - they took care of our every need.  The guides would explain to us each night what to expect the next day, they were available anytime you needed them and they always made sure you made it to the lodge.  They would run ahead and have hot chocolate ready for you at the rest stop!  It was just a great trip that we shared with 43 other people.  The nice thing is there is plenty of space for everyone.  Many times we felt like we were the only 2 people on the trail but we knew that there was a guide in front and a guide in the read to help us if we should run into a problem.  The lodges were well equipped  with hot showers, nice beds, and drying rooms for your clothes.  It was truly a once in a lifetime experience.  We were lucky with the weather since it really on rained on the last day when we were touring the sound by boat.  This just made the sound all that more special as the falls were running at full speed!  If you get a chance to do the Milford Track you won't be sorry.  It's a memory I'll always treasure!"
3,Miserable management,"We did a half-day hike through Trips & Tramps on the Milford Track.  They're the only company that does it as otherwise, you have to do the full 4 day hike with permits and paying for huts and such.  We never knew how many days we would have off until the morning of so booking months (or a year+) in advance was not something we could do.  This alternative, booking the night before, was spot-on for us!We only hiked from the end of the trail up to Giant's Gate, a not even 2 hour hike in, but what we saw was beautiful, despite it down-pouring!  If you stopped too long, the sandflies were crazy so the small open areas on my legs and my exposed hands were pretty beaten up waiting for the rest of the group at the end of the hike (I hadn't been bite when I was moving prior to that).Everything was green and when we started our hike, when the rain wasn't as bad/hadn't been going for as long, the riverbeds were small.  When we hiked back through, not even 2 hours later, some were extremely large!  When you got into an open area, you could look up and see all the tremendous waterfalls - most created with the rain.  If it's not raining (or hasn't been raining recently), you won't see that many.I was so glad we got to do the Track, even if it was only 12% of the overall amount of time someone else spends on the track, covering less than 6% of the amount of land.  I can imagine the rest of it is equally or more gorgeous!"
4,EziHike,"Milford Track is said to be ""the finest walk in the world."" But at over 30 miles, it takes 4 days to finish. I only had one day there and made just over 4 miles into it in the several hours I was there. Since the trailhead is at the other end of Lake Te Anau, getting to the trailhead also requires an expensive ride on a boat shuttle (at least for the self-guided trips)But with however little I saw of Milford Track, I was lucky to hike through it with a full sun. In the bright sunlight, the the track was a walk through the most vibrantly lush forest I have seen. However, the sandflies were a nuisance and track is supposedly to be one of the rainiest place on earth if you decide to go hiking there."
5,Wonderful hike worth the effort!,"An English publication dubbed the Milford Track Walk as ""the finest walk in the world"" in 1908.Whilst there are many wonderful walks in the world this iconic 33.5 mile walk is hard to beat.  The walk can be completed as part of a group with a company called Ultimate Hikes who start groups of 50 every day (with 4 guides).  Accommodation is fully catered in very comfortable lodges along the track.  This is a 4 night / 5 day experience ... very well managed but quite expensive.Independent walkers can also walk the track and stay in quite comfortable public huts (must be pre booked).  40 independent walkers are permitted to start the track each day.  Each of the huts have mattresses and clean flush toilets.The walk itself is outstanding with amazing and diverse scenery.  We were fortunate to have largely fine weather on our walk;  the bonus being that we had extraordinary views from McKinnon Pass (the high point of the track).The walk would also be remarkable in wet weather when the numerous waterfalls and creeks would put on an even more impressive show.The only word of caution is to ensure you have been walking in the 4-6 weeks leading up to the walk including some hills if possible.  The fitter you are the more you will enjoy the walk.Don't delay any further ... start planning to walk this MUST DO experience for all ages (there was a 10 year old in our group through to 70+)"
6,"Fantastic 3,5 days in an unqiue and imressive nature","The Milford track is sometimes called ""The finest walk in the world"", and our family would have a hard time disagreeing. Make sure to book about a year in advance, because it is always sold out. The hike was beautiful, and everywhere you turn you see something amazing. It is a four day walk, independent or guided, our family did independent, which is much cheaper, and you get more of the real hiking experience. You take a boat to the starting point, and the first day is short for independent,  a little more than three miles. You stay in huts each night, and carry your own food, which you can cook on the gas stoves at the huts. Day two is about 10 miles, over flat ground. It was at the hut on day two that we saw the first Kea, which is a bird, similar in looks to a parrot. They will eat anything, so we had to hang our boots and not leave clothes to dry without supervision. Day three was around 10 miles over the pass and back down. This is the hardest day. The last day was 11 miles, but was completely flat. You then take a boat through the sound, and take a bus back. Each hiking group has about 40 people, and another great thing is that you meet a lot of interesting new people. We definitely recommend doing this hike."
7,OUTSTANDING - The best track in the world for a reason,"This really has to be the 'finest walk in the world', as it advertises itself. The scenery is extraordinarily beautiful and pristine. The walk is quite demanding, so don't consider it if you are unfit.I went with Ultimate Hikes, and there is much to commend them. The guides were excellent - 10/10. The Ultimate Hikes store in Queenstown is overpriced and the introductory talk was hopeless. Transportation by coach and boat was great. Accommodation and food, given the remoteness of the lodges, is of a very good standard. I chose to share a dormitory and would not do so again. I was extremely lucky that I only had to share with one very polite Japanese man, but if I'd had to share with 5 others in what are very small rooms the whole experience would have been very different. Definitely chose an en suite if the budget stretches to it. Another problem with dormitories is you have to carry a relatively heavy, and incredibly uncomfortable, bed sheet.We walked over Christmas and the staff at Pompolona lodge put on a fabulous Christmas party  -  many thanks all.In all, an experience to relish and one that I'll never forget."
8,Ok but...,"Totally lived up to it’s reputation as the World’s Most Beautiful hike.I have hiked in Australia, Canada, Nepal, India and Thailand.  This 4 day hike has the best that nature has to offer - rivers, lakes, forests, waterfalls and spectacular mountains.The DOC huts were not luxurious but they were perfect for cooking, eating, sleeping and meeting other hikers.I highly recommend packing insect repellent, ears plugs and a eye mask.We are in our late 50’s.  We trained for this hike.Overall we found it generally easy except for the hike through the emergency track on the downhill from McKinnon’s Pass - that was tough!!We were extremely lucky with the weather only a little rain on the second day.  The views throughout the hike were stunning, however McKinnon’s Pass was spectacular!!!!!!I highly recommend taking your time on this track - some hikers seem to race through it and then spend a lot of the day at the huts.  We were usually one of the last to leave a hut and the last to arrive.  This meant we had at least 40 minutes on McKinnon’s Pass where there was no one else but us.  That was sooooo special."
9,Great walk with some minor improvements needed,"I walked Milford Track in March 2010 with Ultimate Hikes. All was perfect: sunny weather, amazing scenery. I like to go  hiking in the Alps, where I live, and I think Milford Track is not hard but not so easy.We were a group of 50 people, most from Australia and New Zealand. The guides were fantastic and very helpful. Lodges and food were beyond expectation. First day I met 50 people, last day I left 50 friends.Now I hope to come back and do Routeburn Track next year.Thank you Greta, Toshi, Lizzy, Raenee. Thank you to my new 50 friends."
10,Milford track using Easy Hike transport and car relocation service.,"Not a surprise they call it the greatest walk in the world. Weather was tough at points, legs and back got tired but this should be a bucket list item for everyone. Stunning views the whole way. Would love to go back"
11,A Guided walk the Ultimate way to see this Place,"Advertised around the globe as 'The Finest Walk in the World'... it does live up to it's reputation.Love Love Love everything about this track... just a stunning piece of the world.11 of us walked it independently and firstly enjoyed the boat trip across Lake Te Anau to the start of the Track where of course we all stopped for the proverbial photo's at the sign.The sun was shining so we soaked it up on our 2 hour meander along manicured walkways, across a massive swing bridge and alongside the river into our first stop for the night.....Clinton Hut.The second day was also sunny but a little cooler, so as we made our way through to Mintaro Hut for our second night we needed to rug up a little. We ensured we took any little side trips to enjoy every moment, and the scenery was again magnificent.It rained heavily on the 2nd night and when we awoke to leave early the next morning for our BIG climb up over the MacKinnon Pass we saw the BIG ""Do Not Leave the Hut"" sign on  the door. There were 130 km gale force winds up top and the waters were raging across the streams and rivers. We were held back by the ranger until 10 am as the winds had eased and then left in the rain. Just 200mts from the hut we struck calf deep water and as there was no way around we just had to step through it soaking our boots and socks through... an interesting experience but all part of trekking in NZ.The cloud cleared as we reached the top and the vista's were to die for... absolutely magnificent.Our third night was spent at Dumpling Hut  The cooler weather continued for our 4th day walking out but the stunning waterfalls and magnificent scenery made up for the cold and damp. The Rangers give talks each night in the huts and are very informative and interesting giving information, weather reports and answering any questions.The sandflies are the biggest 'bug bear' and you certainly need a repellent that is strong. They are pesky little bugs!!!You definitely need to carry wet weather gear and warm clothes as you never know what to expect as you can get 4 seasons in 1 day out on the track.All up a little bit challenging for some but a most fabulous 4 day hike through the rugged beauty of NZ."
12,Marvellous Milford,"We did the independent walking on the Milford Track November 2016. I'm not the fittest of people but I was able to do this walk without many problems. On day one, the walk is really short, only about an hour, to the first hut. It's a good introduction to the track. Make sure you bring a book or something to read as there isn't  much to do once you arrive at the hut. Also, if you are coming from Queenstown, chances are you are taking early transportation and will arrive at the hut around 1:00 p.m. Day two is also pretty flat, until you get to the end. We didn't have any rain that day so our walk was rather easy. We could see the markers in the track for days when it floods. Have lunch at the Prairie shelter, not the Bus Stop as the BS is basically a dirt floored shelter with no place to sit. Day three is when things got interesting for us. It was raining, windy, and cold on top of the McKinnon Pass. There is a shelter up there with a gas stove and two burners. I would highly recommend bringing an instant soup or something warm for lunch along with a thermos. Most of us were very wet inside the hut. We did stop in at the hut provided for independent walkers, by the guided walkers, towards the end and had a nice cup of complimentary hot tea. That was really a nice touch. The decent on this day can be kind of rough. We didn't have any hiking poles but with we did.The last day is also a fairly flat walk to Sandfly Point. My GPS came in at a little over 13 miles, although officially it's only supposed to be around 11. We left the last hut at 7:45 a.m. and arrived at Sandfly Point at 1:15. We did take a few small breaks during our walk, but nothing  major. The huts are not heated however there is a wood burning stove in the communal dining room. If it has been a particularly wet day, you'll see a lot of garments hanging around the stove in an attempt to get them dry. You can buy decent rain gear, however be prepared to get wet. If you really want to stay dry, bring a cheap plastic poncho. We are slow walkers so the walking times the DOC posted were never accurate for us. We always took at least an hour or two longer than the posted times. Bring Deet or some other kind of bug repellent as the sandflies are prevalent most places on the track.I brought the following with me, and used everything:Down throwSleeping SheetsSmall PillowTwo pairs hiking pantsTwo shirtsBase Layer top and bottomThree pairs of socks- two for hiking and one to wear at the hutsSweat pants and shirt for lounging around the hut and sleepingUndergarments - clean every dayShoes for the hutsHiking Shoes with good ankle supportRain PantsRain JacketDown Jacket - light fillWool BeanieBaseball capLeave in shampooSoap - some of the bathrooms were out of anti bacterial gel so this came in handySmall washclothHand towelCooking potTitanium cupBowl and plastic silverwareFor food, we brought a number of dehydrated fruits and vegetables from home. We also had some nuts for snacking on while tramping. Water can be drunk straight from the streams so you don't need to carry a lot of extra with you. If you are not in particularly good shape, the best thing you can do in order to prepare for the track is to walk, preferably with some weight on your back. Also, make sure your hiking shoes are well worn in before attempting this.Have fun. It's really a great adventure and such a beautiful place to visit."
13,Guided Walk Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes,"The Milford Track is a fantastic experience. My wife and I have walked it twice with Ultimate Hikes. We walked it on our honeymoon and a year later with our respective parents. The first time we walked it it rained 180 mm on the last day, and this was a fantastic experience. We got soaked to the skin, but it was fun, and arriving at Milford Sound Lodge to hot showers, drinks and dinner was a great finish to the day."
14,Awesome trek well worth your time,"We just finished The Classic (Milford and Routeburn Tracks), and we very highly recommend Ultimate Hikes. Because of their stellar reputation, we booked our guided hike with UH nearly a year in advance, and then planned the rest of our NZ trip (5-1/2 weeks) around it. We loved both Tracks... The Milford is such an iconic walk, and starting in Te Anau and ending in Milford Sound are bonuses to the gorgeous forest walks and McKinnon Pass crossing. If you only have time for one trek in NZ, this is probably the one to do. UH exceeded our expectations in every way: pre-trip information, info meeting, equipment, transportation, lodges, food, guides, amenities, and of course, the trails and scenery. Oh, and weather (ha, maybe not their doing, but we go sooo lucky.. gorgeous sunshine for 7 days straight)!! We met many kindred spirits and got lots of intel on other great treks and trips we should consider. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
15,Warm and dry!!!,"Great landscapes, a good and challenging track, specially the third day when we went through the pass.The organisation was excellent we did it with Ultimate Hikes and they were really careful and always in a great helping mood. We were evacuated on the second day because of the heavy rain and the guides took action straight away to assure our security."
16,Amazing Walk,"We had heard that New Zealand was beautiful - and were not disappointed!  The Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes was a great way to see the remote area between Queenstown and Milford Sound.  Ultimate Hikes provides comfortable rooms and plenty of food, so you do not need to pack much. We stayed in a private room, but the shared rooms seemed comfortable as well.  I was worried about the weather and hoped it would not rain - but it did - on and off  - and it actually didn't matter much.  While the hike is somewhat challenging, there is plenty of time to reach each daily destination - and it was not too difficult.  I had not trained much - and was able to enjoy each day - though I might have enjoyed it a bit more if I had trained!  You can wash and dry your clothes at night in their drying rooms, so one change of clothes for day and one for night is actually enough.  We loved the whole experience, the staff, other hikers from around the world, stunning views.  Highly recommended!"
17,Just do it!,"The Milford Track is a fabulous walk.  We did it with Ultimate Hikes which means hot showers, three course meals and a comfortable bed each night.  The track is very wet any time of the year and our rain pants and jackets were a god-send.  Of the 5 days, three are full on walks so make sure you boots are well worn in.... i.e. you have wet then and walked in them to ensure they mould to your feet as coming down 950m on rough rocks plays havoc with feet!"
18,So beautiful but not luxury with Ultimate Hikes.,"Hiked the independent walker version of the Milford Track. Logistics booked through DOC excellent. Huts are basic but comfortable and even have flushing toilets. The hike is stunning from start to finish. One day of rain which completely transforms the forest and creates roaring waterfalls. This hike definitely needs a day of rain. If you are fit, a must have on the bucket list!"
19,Disapointing,"The idea of hiking, or tramping as the Kiwis call it, for three nights through the 'wilderness' may frighten off many who visit the South Island Fiordland, but don't be put off, it's great fun and not really wilderness as there are other walkers and DOC (Department of Conservation) personnel around although care is needed in bad weather and you need the right equipment. Fortunately we had four days of sunshine which is apparently a rarity on this walk, but the scenery was stunning and the escape from mobile phones and Internet were total - no signal, no Wi-Fi! You can take the independent route staying in DOC huts which will require booking in advance and you taking stores for your journey, alternatively you can go for the slightly more civilised option of a guided walk, run by Ultimate Hikes who work closely with DOC but have their own well equipped lodges. Either way you have to walk the 33.5 miles. We opted for guided (which is more expensive) basically because it was easier to organise -simply less hassle. The Milford Track was just part of our month in NZ and it meant we could limit the amount of equipment we took with us  from home as Ultimate Hikes provide the essentials, rucksack, walking poles, sleeping sheets, rainwear, transport, food and sort out permits, which otherwise will need to be booked in advance and picked up at the DOC office in Queenstown or Te Anau before you start. Guided means you get transported from Queenstown to Te Anau Downs, rather than making your own way there for the spectacular boat trip to the start of the Track. From disembarking the walk is pretty easy going for days 1&2, a good well marked path, allowing you to take in a changing landscape, view the wildlife and generally get into your stride. On day three you start around the 14 miles post into the walk the climb up the McKinnon Pass. The climb is around 2 miles of path, reasonably strenuous as you climb c700m but most reasonably fit people should manage it. The views from the top are stunning if it's clear (no guarantees and often the weather is poor), once you have made it the remainder of day 3 and all of the fourth day is either downhill or fairly flat right to Sandfly Point where the Anita Bay will take you back to Milford Sound, it runs at 2, 3 & 4 pm daily. Give it a go, it's worth it, it's not difficult or particularly challenging just beautiful countryside, however just take your insect repellant as Sandfly Point gives you a big clue what the biggest pest is on the walk"
20,Ultimate hikes....a really special experience,"Walked the 4-day Milford Track January 2014.  As is apparently normal for the Milford Track, we had two days of brilliant sunshine and 2 days of relentless rain.  Walking the first day was very easy after a gorgeous cruise across Lake Te Anau and up to the first hut (Clinton Hut).  Second day was long and arduous because the mercury hit 34 degrees.  Third day was the brilliant McKinnon Pass in a wild storm and the last day was very rainy and very long.  But the scenery throughout was spectacular.  A magical ""hobbit"" forest.  The final day was straightforward but long and there were a lot of streams to cross because the water levels were so high.  Overall the track was fairly easy - very easy for young people.  I did it when I was 67 so I'm rather slow.Definitely one of the highlights of my total world travel!  Highly recommended but you have to book almost a year in advance especially if there's a few people doing it together."
21,Great walk by name Great walk by experience ,"The Milford Track is one of NZ's ""Great Walks."" It's 33.5 miles through gorgeous valleys and mountains in Fiordland National Park. It is not an easy trek.  You need to be able to carry a backpack over 10 to 21 km for 4 to 8 hours a day. One day has a significant climb and descent, some of it on difficult track.  The weather can be anything from sunny and warm to snow/rain/gale-force winds--all on the same day.  It's worth the effort because the scenery is spectacular.  While you can do an independent walk on the track, it's much better to do a guided walk with Ultimate Hikes.  They provide the transportation between Queenstown and the track at the beginning and end; food and lodging while you're on the track; and fabulous guides who are worth the trip all by themselves.  Independent walkers take care of all of this themselves.  The lodges for the guided walkers are comfortable, provide copious tasty food, and have laundry and drying facilities.  The latter is especially important after a wet day on the track.  Independent walkers stay in huts with no showers, food, or laundry/drying facilities.  The track is one-way and limited to about 75 hikers a day, 50 guided and 25 independent. Independent walkers have to apply for permits to stay in huts for each night on the track.  So, unless you are really ambitious and fit enough to carry all your food, bedding, and hiking supplies, the guided walk is the way to go. We enjoyed the track, getting to know the other hikers in our group & the guides, the quiet at night after the generator was turned off, the birds & plants we saw, the history of the track we learned--the whole experience.  A bonus was a cruise on beautiful Milford Sound the final (5th) day of the trip.  There's a good description of the track and the experience on the Ultimate Hikes website."
22,AN ULTIMATE HIKES EXPERIENCE,"Milford track was the best hike i have done yet! It's scenery is amazing and i found the track was very social. The huts are kept in very good condition by the dedicated rangers and have lots of bunks, good bathroom facilities and a fantastic communal kitchen. i found myself staying up very late just talking to people from other countries of the world and i played cards many many times. By the end of the hike i was very sad to split with all the wonderful people i had met but i gave me yet again a very happy memory of Milford sound."
23,A natural wonder not to be missed,"Won't go into the walk itself, as plenty of others have covered this.Booked the guided walk through Ultimate Hikes, we thought - this is typically something you only do once, so do it well - very glad and happy we did. It certainly makes the hiking more fun when there is a cold beer and hot meal waiting for you each afternoon.Ensuite rooms are cosy, clean and beds are large and comfortable. Showers always had hot water for us, with good pressure.Food served each day was of surprisingly good quality, considering the remote locations and there was always plenty of it - you won't be losing any weight on this walk!Lights go out at 10 each night, but that's ok as we were ready for sleep.1 of our party was not very fit, this was not a problem, it just means you move a little slower and take a little longer, no issue as you have all day. In fact it gives you more chance to take in the amazing scenery!Most of the walk is on well laid paths that require little effort. One caution - there are a couple of sections, crossing bolder-strewn rockfalls and a steep section downward from the saddle where  it could be quite difficult, bordering on very hard, if you are not reasonably confident with balance and agility. Take 2 walking poles, you won't need them most of the time, but very handy when you do.Summary - I don't think anyone, of any background, could do this walk and not feel awed by the unspoilt scenery and sense of peacefulness.If you like us, have talked about it for years, get off your butt and do it, it will be one of your life's best decisions!"
24,Great Walk!!!!!,"The Milford track, as so many have said, is gorgeous and lovely even in the rain.  Nice variation in scenery and terrain.  If you do it and have a car rented, use easy hike for booking boat transport to and from the trail, and car relocation service.  They make it easy and stress free.  Our trek went off without a hitch.  Highly recommend and I would use them again.  Fantastic!!"
25,Gorgeous but Grueling!,"I was travelling on my own and did the Milford Track in February - non guided/independent. I stayed in Queenstown the night before and took the early morning bus to Te Anau. There is a connecting bus onwards to Te Anau Downs to get the boat but I decided to have some time in Te Anau and was glad I did. I had time to collect my tickets from the park office. Additionally I visited the Tracknet office which is just near to the National Park Office - they offer a service where they take a box and deliver it to the Milford Lodge for a cost of $15. I thought this was great and in my box I added some fresh clothes, a bit of food and chocolate, some toiletries etc. This saved me carrying extra stuff with me. I bought lunch in Te Anau and then got the lunchtime bus to the ferry. The best bit of advice I was given at the park office was to have a backpack liner and I bought one from the park office for 8 dollars - best value bit of kit I owned for the track. I was glad to have made the decision to get the later boat as it is only a 3 mile walk on day 1. This was the only day I was dry and saw the sun. Food I took - I am not very keen on the add water to dried food things you get so I took a bag of pasta and some sauce and had that every evening. I toasted bagels in the morning on my small frying pan with cream cheese. I had bagels for lunch as well which was a bit boring in the end! Packet of ginger nut biscuits for snacks as well as 6 tracker bars and some tea bags.Sandflys - they loved me - I had bought two different sprays in Queenstown and they were both fairly ineffective. Has to be deet really. As soon as you stop they find you. I was glad to have antihistamine available as my wrist ended up quite swollen.Clothing etc - Head torch was essential. Pots, cutlery and sleeping bag essential. I didnt have a plate and ate out of my pot. I had waterproof jacket and trousers, light weight walking long trousers zipping off to shorts, 4 pairs of socks, long sleeve light weight top, light zip up fleece, change of clothes for evening and an essential pair of flipflops. I took good, well broken in boots and was glad of this. Walking poles were essential for me. I didn't have gaiters but wished I had.  So after day one I walked the remaining 3 days in continual, non-stop torrential rain. I have never been as wet in my life. The track became a steam to splash through, rivers burst out over tracks with wading knee high and sometimes up to waist high. Thunder and lightening storms etc. My feet were never dry, in fact I was soaked through every day. The waterfalls were stunning as was the forest area but I didn't get any great views at all, not once did I wear sunglasses or put on any sun protection cream and my sun hat remained in my bag the whole time. I of course knew it was a very wet area of the world but just wasn't expecting to walk the whole way in constant heavy rain. Still it was a good experience and there were nice people doing it at the same time as me. I did think at one point think that the best type of clothing would be a wet suit, some fishermans wading trousers and perhaps a small boat would have come in handy. Overall I am pleased that I did this walk but hope if you are reading this and planning to do it that you get less rain than I did."
26,'The finest walk in the world' in a half-day walk!,"Had an amazing time on the Milford Track guided walk by Ultimate Hikes. This is the fourth time I’ve walked with this company and they have not let me down. Big thanks to the guides Hannah, Margarita, Megan and Toshi, for keeping everyone safe and happy and to the lodge staff for the excellent meals and accommodation. We had a great bunch on people on the walk and its safe to say that we all had great time together. We had an absolute beautiful’s days weather on the last days boat trip around Milford Sound. Anyone planning to do the Milford Track should be aware that the third day going up and down the Mackinnon Pass is the toughest and the weather can change very quickly. But apart from that the scenery is breathtaking and the waterfalls everywhere are a amazing. Would high recommend this to anyone."
27,Easyhike car Relocation,"The Milford Track - wow! I set myself a hard task there but very rewarding. It's a great way to lose weight! Stunning scenery, beautiful waterfalls, tame and unusual birds, gloworms by night and an idyllic end to the track. Just make sure you are fit before you go and especially make sure you're used to carrying a heavy pack - depending of course on how much you carry. Take painkillers and padding - or squeeze some rolled up socks under your rucksack shoulder straps. I went as an ""independent tramper"" having made my reservations on-line with the NZ DOC office.I got in last minute on a cancellation. These seem to come up quite frequently so keep checking!Day 1 was easy - a doddle.  Starts with a nice stable boat ride from Te Anau Downs. You only walk for 90 minutes and then settle in to Clinton hut, fight for space at the gas ring, cook your dinner, wash up and then socialise before bed. Don't carry too much food and remember you must carry out all materials you carry in including your rubbish.Some trampers took wine and steaks much to the envy of those of us on dehydrated mince and instant potato! I'd do the same next time though - nothing like a bit of luxury after a hard day's walking.  In the evening you can join in the nature walk and talk then bump into fellow trampers in the darkness of the forest as you seek out gloworms in a grotto close by the river. Take a head torch and spare batteries! I can't remember the name of the ranger that presented to us but without exception all rangers at the huts are close to nature and lovely people.Snoring - oh the snoring - it reverberates around the dorms - sleep with ear plugs or better still stick your iPOD on with some pleasant sound to drown out the rumble! The noise was so bad one of our guests moved her bed into the kitchen block. Dorms and toilet facilities are all mixed by the way! All to a very decent standard though. No hot water - this is the wilderness after all.Day 2 - walk to Mintaro Hut. This stretch is predominantly through forest though it eventually opens out into some impressive scenery, a hidden lake in which you can swim (if you're a seal) and the crystal clear Clinton River which has an inviting bluish, turquoise tinge if you can brave the temperature. The odd Weka will pop out to greet you on the trail, Robins will peck your feet and Fantails will flutter around you but only to catch the sandflies that are now biting you because you were daft enough to stand still and watch the birds! Take repellent! You have been warned. By the end of this day I was in extreme pain from my pack. I slept like a log whilst contemplating whether I should ask for a chopper to airlift me out the next day - after all how was I going to climb up to 1154 metres given how difficult lugging this pack around had been.  Day 3 - the best day of all for me. Starts with a climb up the McKinnon pass - to amazing views. Look at my pics. There was an inversion as we emerged from the clouds. Here you will envy the Guided Walkers who will be there sipping hot tea that was carried for them. Take your own flask and make yourself a brew before you leave Mintaro hut. The summit is one place you will appreciate a cuppa more than any other place on the trail - unless you end up walking flooded trails down below of course. Warning: Be prepared to wade up to your waist or even chest in water - I didn't have to but many walkers have had to as river levels rise dramatically and quickly when the rain comes down. Think about carrying sufficient changes of clothes! This stretch is so pretty - you will pass stunning waterfalls on your way to Dumpling Hut. Keas also ""operate in the area"". At Dumpling Hut is a beautiful swimming hole - leap in and when you come out, sandflies will be waiting to dry you off. If like me, you wont want to complete the trail without having bathed in the river - especially after three days of sweating - it'll be welcome refreshment. Day 4 - to Sandfly Point. This last stretch is reputed to take 6 hours - provided you march that is. I did it in 6 hours flat but only because I left the hut at 5:45am in darkness and maintained  a constant pace. Along this stretch are more falls. You'll simply be amazed.They are the kind of falls you'd imagine fairies to be bathing in when you're not watching - not that I imagine fairies you understand. I did see two Possums along the trail which I caught in the light of my head torch. I got to Sandfly point early and being all alone I was in my element, laying there on the wharf enjoying the sunshine. It was 90 minutes or so before anyone caught me up although I did pass some day trampers coming in the other direction. I'd recommend the day walk if you can't do the four days. It covers some of the best parts of the track.I was paranoid about missing the boat as I had to get to Milford, get the bus and then pick up my car and drive 460 miles back to Christchurch to catch my flight the next morning. As it was I got the 2pm boat and made it to Christchurch by 2am in the morning! My advice is to leave yourself time to explore Milford Sound. I had to leave it all behind which made my heart sink - the scenery is incredible. I will return! Finally one point of note. A significant percentage of this walk is through forest. At times I began to think I don't want to look at another tree but other trampers felt that this was one of the attractions. I like scenery and am used to walking in the Italian Dolomites and English Lake Districts which are much more open and varied in my experience.  There is no doubt you'll love this walk but compare pics with the Routeburn (have I spelt that right?) Track which others recommended to me."
28,Amazing walk let down a bit by the increased and extra costs,"We did the Milford Track in February as independent trampers with Milton Rotary. A very professional outfit with wonderful group leaders.We carried our packs and some of the food for the group which was distributed equally each day and  we all contributed to the food preparation in the evening.It is a wonderful walk with amazing scenery.Photo opportunities abound....Do yourself a favour and those responsible for your well being by going prepared..........it is not a walk in the park, so do some training with your pack and pay special attention to what gear you take.Each night there was a talk given by a cabin ranger on wildlife and the environment in general which was very interesting.A special treat is an overnight on a boat at the end of the walk in Milford Sound.Hot showers, wonderful food and lovely cabins, it doesn't get much better.Certainly worth the extra money to finish the walk like this.A very rewarding experience.........and I can't imagine why I haven't done a review before this."
29,Awesome,"I can see why it's one of the ""Great Walks"" of New Zealand. Nothing prepared us for the amazing views on this track. Be sure to bring a camera."
30,Just Spectacular,Organised for car relocation from Te Anau Downs to Milford when we walked the Milford track. Very friendly and efficient. Would highly recommend
31,Hike,"I just completed my second Milford Track hike. I can't say enough good things about it. When you hike the Milford Track, you enter a different universe for four days. Now that I'm a mature hiker (61) I do the guided walk with Ultimate Hikes, a wonderful company that knows how to strike all the right chords providing just the right level of service and comfort. This is a physically demanding hike, and the company provides just enough support to get you through it. I appreciate that they keep it simple, basic, and functional, preserving the integrity of the environment and the historical roots of the hike."
32,"A Lifelong Dream Hike, Finally Realised",Did this independently. Worth doing if u are reasonably fit. The best day is the third days. The views are stunning. The Sutherland falls are amazing side walk.
33,Immersed In Nature,"The Milford track was awesome.  Went in as an independent tramper, making reservations online with DOC.  The track is maintained to a high standard and there is very little chance of getting lost.  You will see some beautiful scenery, amazing waterfalls and cheeky and tame bird life. I personally found the walk a lot easier than I had anticipated, and the first two days of hiking are pretty straight forward.  The third day of the hike would probably be the best, the view from the top of the McKinnon Pass is breathtaking and we were lucky to have decent weather while we were up there.The huts are fairly comfortable, however snoring in the bunk rooms can be pretty loud so maybe bring a pair of ear plugs or take your iPod and also ensure that you have some decent insect repellent as in some spots the sandflies are evil . The area gets a lot of rain and changeable weather so be sure that you are prepared, have decent water proof clothing and that you double bag or pack all your gear into dry bags. Also when we walked the track there was that much rain, that we were unsure if we would have to stay an extra night on the track, so it would be a wise idea to take an extra days food, in case such a situation arises.Loved this experience and would definitely recommend."
34,Fabulous challenging hike,"Milford Track is one of the most famous hikes (tramps - if you are a Kiwi) in the world.  Everyone who likes to hike knows you can do these lodge-to-lodge hikes through an incredible part of the southern island of New Zealand (known as Fjiordland).  But it wasn't until I actually did the Track that I realized the magic of Milford.  If I only tell you the words, you would think I was out of my mind.  Here's an example: on the last day we walked 13 miles in a steady downpour of rain that turned piddly creeks into mini-rivers.  We were soaked to the skin within an hour and still had 6 to go.  We gave up trying to cross creeks on rocks and just tramped on through the water letting it flood into our boots - because what the heck we were WET.  We finally made it to our outdoor lunch spot about 10 miles on -  only to find it was flooded.  And yet, the hike was, as I said, magical.  Part of the magic was the incredible beauty of the area, part of it was the very well orchestrated trip, thanks to Ultimate Hikes in Queenstown, and part of it was the experience of being able to walk completely alone, at my own pace, feeling utterly safe knowing that it was perfectly ok with the guides and everyone else in the group that I get where I need to be when the time is right for me.  Now that is an amazing experience.(To be complete, I need to mention that each of the lodges - Glade, Pampolona, Quintin, and Milford - was well designed, clean, and comfortable.  The meals were delicious and ample.  The guides were knowledgeable, easy going, and fun.  No issues with any of the logistics of the trip.)"
35,Milford Track Guided Walk,My friend and I did the Milford Track Nov 24-28 with Ultimate Hikes   It was fantastic.      The lodges were top notch   The hike was in great shape and well marked.  The views were amazing
36,Magnificent scenery well worth the walk,"When in New Zealand plan your trip around doing the Milford Track.  I highly recommend going through Ultimate Hikes (rather than doing in on your own).  It is worth every penny!!!!  On the trail there are only 90 hikers per day (1/2 from Ultimate Hikes and 1/2 of what we now call the ""freedom fighters"").  Each night you stay in huts--some private and some are shared between 6 people (we opted for a private room because I wanted my own bathroom).  The guides are very personable and entertaining.  Wonderful breakfast and dinners are made for you each day and they provide food for you to prepare your lunch.  The scenery is unbelievable-- you are in the wettest place on earth and there are no shortages of waterfalls!  The water is the purest on earth and you can drink from any river or waterfall along the trail!!!This IS the best thing to do in NZ!!!!Also don't miss: swimming with the dolphins in Kaikoura"
37,An Absolutely Awesome Experience.,"Just returned from Milford Track as an independent tramper. It was absolutely fantastic.Having done some longer treks than this I was expecting it to be ""a walk in the park"". I was pleased to find that it was more challenging than I expected. Not hard but accurately graded as a moderate level walk.The scenery is really something else and incredibly varied. Having a booking system which limits the number of individuals starting each day to 40 is a really good idea as we found that we rarely came across anyone during the day. As for the accomodation on route, I found the huts to be very comfortable with good facilities for cooking etc.One tip I would give is to try and keep your pack as light as possible. I had no problems with sore feet, shoulders or back which can be an issue. I managed to get mine to just under 10 kilo which included all personal items such as sleeping bag, cooking utensils and food for 4 days, first aid kit, insect repellant (very important) clothes for all weather conditions and toiletries. I also took a hip flask of Kahlua which came in very handy thankyou very much. Don't skimp on little luxuries such as chocolate as you need to have some nice yummies to look forward to.Our party took our time during the day and often were the last to arrive at the huts as we stopped and swam, chatted and generally soaked up this incredible part of our world.Would recommend the independent tramp to anyone of reasonable fitness who wants to see nature at it's best...."
38,Hiking in Luxury,"Definitely the best track we have ever done. Gorgeous, impressive nature. 33.5 miles in four days from Glade Wharf across Mackinnon Pass to Sandfly Point. Be aware that this is quite a tough activity - you take all your belongings on your back, even all garbage you produce during the track.Simple accommodation in three huts - Clinton, Mintaro and Dupling hut where there are cookers, water, toilets and simple beds, with about 20 people in one room. If you prefer an easy version of the same route, with more comfort, and if you are ready to pay for that, take a guided walk with Ultimate Hikes and you will walk the same route without heavy packs and with sleeping in comfort huts with good beds, where they will even prepare meals for you. Anyway, if you like nature, Milford Track is a great activity for you!"
39,Milford Track - Hiking in the wild,We hiked the Milford Track in early December with Ultimate Hikes.  It was a wonderful experience and the track is awesome in the true sense of the word.  Our guides were extremely professional and the whole trip was well organised.  Food was good and the lodges were clean and comfortable.   One tip is to not pack too much stuff as you have to carry it for several hours!  The lodges have excellent drying rooms so you can rinse out socks etc. in the evening and they are dry in a couple of hours.
40,It’s no wonder it’s one of the best walks in the world! ,"This has been on my bucket list for years, and as I was in the South Island I finally walked the Milford. It rained every day, but the weather cleared at the right time, and the views were amazing, the facilities were excellent, and I can't rate this trip high enough"
41,Stunning,"We completed the Milford track self-guided in early March 2014 and it was an incredible walk. The scale of the place is massive! If you're fit and have walking experience you can save money by doing the self guided walk. setting you own pace is the best part. we found that there are plenty of hours in the day to get to each night's hut so don't be pressured to leave early. some people on the walk would leave at 7am and rush to that night's hut. I recommend taking you time and stopping to ""smell the roses"". There's something interesting around every corner. also the groups that left early on the day over Mackinnon Pass found there was too much fog on the saddle for them to see anything, they were quite disappointed, whereas we arrived at the pass 2 hours later and had the clearest most magnificent views!. So i cannot stress enough, take your time and enjoy! its much more peaceful at the back of the pack:)"
42,Wilderness walk escape from city life for 4 days,"We just returned from hiking the Milford Track through Ultimate Hikes.  Our friends hiked the same days as us, doing the unguided walks and staying in the DOC huts. Based on our separate experiences, I can unequivocally say the extra money spent on Ultimate Hikes was well worth it for us.The Milford Track is one of the most fantastic hikes we have ever done.  The flora and fauna are incomparable and amazing.  Old trees covered with mosses are everywhere as the trail winds through a rain forest.  You see incredible waterfalls and mountain views as you climb out of the tree line, cross Mackinnon Pass and walk back down into the valley. A truly stunning landscape over 33.5 miles in 4 days. Whether you stay in the huts or the Ultimate Hikes lodges, you walk the same trail. The difference comes in how you experience the Milford Track.With Ultimate Hikes, we stayed in lodges with private rooms, showers, washing and drying facilities (very important when hiking in a rainforest) and large common dining facilities and even bars. We ate great food, they had vegetarian meals for us for dinner and lunch. We had knowledgeable, personable guides. Kelly, Thomas, Kieran and Kyohei were fantastic and funny! We received a slideshow briefing every night about where we would be walking, trail conditions, weather, the lunch stop (where we received hot drinks) and bathroom and water locations. We carried relatively light day packs containing extra layers, rain gear, our lunch and clothes and shoes to wear at night. Also included in the price was an overnight at Mitre Peak Lodge on the last day of the hike and a boat tour of spectacular Milford Sound the next morning. We had an incredible experience that we loved.Our four friends who did the DOC huts had a vastly different experience. They carried much larger packs with bedding and food for four days. They had to arrange their own bus and boat transportation to the trail head.  Because of a communication problem, they missed their bus and they had to scramble to get another boat, much later.  There was torrential rain that afternoon and they were caught in it as they made their way to the first hut.  Two were caught in a flood and had to be rescued by helicopter.  Their boots, gear and clothing were totally soaked and the drying room in the huts was inadequate.  When some of our group met them on the trail a day or two later, our two friends said “you must be with the guided group”. When asked why, they said “because you look happy”. I have seen a few reviews here saying the huts “are 10% of the cost of the guided hikes” and while the guided hikes are definitely more expensive, that’s not quite the whole story.  With Ultimate Hikes you get bus transportation from Queenstown to Te Anau, a boat to the trail head, all your meals for the duration (excellent meals), a boat out and a bus ride back to Queenstown.  On the unguided hikes you have to arrange and pay for all of this on your own, as well as purchasing and carrying in your food. At the end of the fourth day you go back to Queenstown in the afternoon arriving late evening.With Ultimate Hikes, included in the price is a fourth night at Mitre Peak Lodge, dinner, a boat tour of Milford Sound the next morning, lunch and a bus back to Queenstown, arriving at 4PM.For us, Ultimate Hikes was well worth the extra money.  We had a much better experience than our friends did-it was more about enjoying the Milford Track rather than surviving the Milford Track. You will spend so much money to travel to New Zealand anyway, I don’t know why you would cut corners on the Milford Track experience."
43,the ultimate hike,"Spent 5 days (ex-Queenstown) doing the guided Milford Track trip with Ultimate Hikes. As a New Zealander I was a little concerned that I would feel like a sheep being herded with 49 others, and that the track wouldn't live up to it's international reputation. I needn't have worried: Ultimate Hikes have mastered guiding on the Milford. The four guides with our party were fantastic, the huts were pretty comfortable, the food was great and I didn't feel 'herded' at all. The party was a mix of many nationalities, cleverly introduced to one another on the first evening. The only 'tour party' aspect was that we were asked to wear a name badge for the duration. This actually made it easier to meet and chat with others, so made complete sense. The track itself is harder than I expected, rough in some places, steep up and downhill on the third day and long (the last day is 22km, and it's NOT flat despite the elevations on the map suggesting it is!). I had trained for it and I'm very glad I did - this is no 'walk in the park'. Worst night was a Milford Lodge after finishing the track: sweltering hot room, couldn't sleep, snuck out and borrowed a giant fan from the lounge room in desperation. Horrid, if I'd had a mosquito net (for the sand-flies) I would have slept on the grass outside and had a better night.Last day was a nice wind-down with a cruise on Milford Sound and then bus back to Queenstown via Te Anau and the pie shop. I think this trip was the best money I have ever spent. My photos were taken in an old iphone, imagine what you could do with an even better camera!"
44,Brilliant but ...,"I had wanted to hike the Milford Track for over 20 years and finally did so.  Everything you have heard about the zillions of waterfalls after a heavy rain is absolutely true - so unbelievably gorgeous!  HOWEVER that view requires the clouds clearing after that heavy rain.  Of the 80 + people on the trail, only 5 of us were ""slow"" enough to be around on the peak (McKinnon Pass) when the clouds cleared.  Only 5 of us saw the fairytale landscape.  The other 75 grumbled and missed it because they were already far down the mountain when the clouds cleared (but they made it to Sutherland Falls and we did not - no problem as we had seen soooo many waterfalls that my partner finally admonished me to stop photographing every one - LOL!)  BE WARNED - the final day of the Milford Track is Hellish!  Yes you do go through more gorgeous forest, but you are Rushing To Meet The Boat On Time.... and it is By Far the longest part of the whole track (11 miles / 18 km).  So instead of taking your time and enjoying the last day, you are walking as fast as possible to meet the boat - this is Bad Planning on the part of the DOC.  That fourth, longest day was Not Fun...Not Fun At All!!  We almost went into the DOC aftewards with one simple message: Reverse The Hiking Direction!  If the first day was 11 miles / 18 km, you would arrive at the hut exhausted certainly, but then you could wake up and relax the next morning instead of needing to be frantic and hurried.  The second day would then be the Main Day of McKinnon Pass with an easy hike up and a faster descent.  The third day would again be a nice slow walking day to enjoy the beautiful forest and all the flora and fauna, and in this Reversed Direction, the last day would only be a two hour walk and so you could ENJOY your final day with a nice slow stroll to the boat wharf.  As it stands, we loved day one, we loved day two, Day Three (McKinnon Pass) was astounding but only for 5 out of 80 of us, and day four was Living Hell (note - ALL as in 100% of our blisters and soreness came from having to rush on day four on the longest walk of the trip; We were Fine before that day in every way).  People we spoke with afterwards agreed that the first 3 days are awesome and the last (4th) day is bordering on living hell (while surrounded by gorgeous nature that you barely have time to enjoy, which goes 100% against my entire hiking philosophy about Taking Your Time to Enjoy Nature).  You have been warned.  Also your rain gear will all fail - everyone's did from every brand you can name - in this amount of constant rain (160 cm in one day!).  Only the people wearing good old cheap plastic Rain Ponchos reported being dry - LOL!  So definitely invest in a Bag Liner (garbage bags at least).  Typical rain gear is NOT designed for this degree of wetness.  And bring a LOT of bug stuff for the sand flies.  p.s. we were independent hikers, not guided."
45,Make sure you have a waterproof internal pack liner!,"My partner and I did the Milford Track last week and we loved it! Although it rained 2 and a half days out of the 4 days that we were there we still managed to have fun and enjoy the journey. This was my first ever multi-day hike so I was pretty bruised, blistered and exhausted afterwards. The track and the huts were very well maintained. The hunt rangers were also very friendly, helpful and welcoming. We met so many lovely people there and we've become friends with a few of them which is great! The weather wasn't the best but I guess it was good enough for Milford Track standard! One very important advice for anyone looking to do this walk is to bring insect repellent!!! Those sand flies are no joke! Their bites are extremely itchy and they last for weeks! A pack liner and good quality rain jacket and rain cover for your backpack are also a must. I found the walk to be pretty tough for a beginner hiker like myself but it was well worth it. My partner and I enjoyed the experience so much we are already planning to do more great walks next year!"
46,Reconsider if you have joint problems or fitness questions,"We tramped the Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes based in Queenstown.   For five days/four nights we had the experience of a lifetime shared with a group of fellow hikers.   The three guides were very friendly and helpful and skilled.   The accommodation and food surpassed our expectations.   The walking was challenging at times expecially given the unseasonal snow that results in us having to undertake a helicopter ride to get up to the Mackinnon Pass then walk slowly down through the snow and emergency track to get to our accommodation for the third night.   The scenery was unfailingly beauttiful and majestic,   We would recommend this experience to anyone fit enough to participate.   This was the highlight of our four week stay in the south island of NZ."
47,Hard but worth it!,"We just returned from a 5 day guided hike on the Milford Track.  The track itself is 33.5 miles long and it covers both flat and mountainous areas.  Almost all of the walk is done over 3 days - walking for 7-9 hours each day.  The first day you spend making your way to the first lodge with a 2 mile nature walk.  The last day you take cruise around Milford Sound and then travel back to Queenstown.Whilst the walk was at times gruelling, it was absolutely beautiful regardless of the weather.   The path itself changes continously.  You walk through moss covered temperate rainforests, between mountains, next to rivers, up mountain paths, over streams, through mud and here and there you climb over areas struck by landslides.  There are a lot of rocks!  Expect to have very sore feet!The guided tour is excellent.  Food and accomodation is provided each night (and you can buy alcohol at each lodge). The quality of both was excellent except for the last night at Mitre Peak which was comparatively poor.  There is hot water at each lodge.A special mention must be given to the guides who accompanied us.  They really added a special dimension to the trip.  Amazing folk.The tour can have up to 50 hikers.  We had around 18 people on our hike - they were a fabulous bunch of fellow travellers and we really loved spending the evenings chattting.I would recommend you take the minimum amount of clothes with you for the walk.  You don't need much as there are washing and drying facilities at each lodge.  I took one pair of light summer shorts which was fine even though the temperature was 12 degrees celscius.  I also took one t-shirt and two thermal tops (I only used one), plus a fleece and rain jacket. I also had light pants and shoes for the lodge each night.  Either sandals or you can buy a type of slipper shoe at the Milford Track shop in Queenstown.   It is a good idea to borrow a walking stick for the trip down the mountain (McKinnon Pass).  I borrowed that on Day 3 when we stopped for lunch at the top of the mountain.My boots were great except on the downhill track when my foot moved to the front and I had badly bruised toes which was really painful.  My boots were a little too big.  I would recommend buying some foot fleece (at the shop in Queenstown) or wearing another pair of socks on day 3 when you climb down the mountain if your foot moves in your shoe.  Even better if you have boots that are the perfect size!Fellow hikers varied in age from 18 to 80.  The hike is rigorous.  The 80 year old lady on our trip was a very fit person.    There were no negatives to the trip.  It was a great way to relax as because you are so focused on hiking and admiring the amazingly beautiful landscape (plus thinking about sore feet!) you don't spend a moment thinking about your normal life.The memories from the trip are something I will always treasure.  Summary of tips- Make sure you get the best fitting boots possible, it's the downhill that can get you if the boots aren't great- Buy footfleece at the shop before the walk.  - Take slipper shoes  or sandals for the lodge- You can wear shorts - if it gets cold you can throw on thermal pants- Don't take much as you can wash and dry your clothes every night.  I half filled a 35 litre pack- A walking stick was useful on the downhill path - you can borrow one- Take a water bottle!- Be prepared to get wet and enjoy it!"
48,One of a kind,"The Milford Track is a must. If you don't have much hiking experience, it is perfect. We did it independently which made it even more of an adventure. You will make great friends and get to know everyone in the huts. Plan for rain and bring wet-weather gear (Goretex) and thermals. It was cold even in summer, there was still snow on top of the mountains at MacKinnon Pass (spectacular to see!) We were blessed with sunny and rainy days. The second day poured down and all the streams flooded and we barely made it across! Be careful of hyperthermia, try and stay dry underneath. We had the best time of our lives, it was such an adventure. The photos we have to look back on are just amazing. Make sure you train regularly beforehand and practice carrying a pack. Mine was 15kg and I am only 5'3. I did a lot of weights and walking/running prior to. The best practice is hiking ofcourse. We stayed in Te Anau at the Red Tussock before and after the track, and they stored the luggage we didn't want to take with us. You can buy all your food in Te Anau and gas for your cookers etc. Make sure you take chocolate and lollies, you will need them! You might want knee supports for the decent from MacKinnon Pass, my knees were killing me!"
49,Absolutely amazing!!!!,"My wife and I have just returned from NZ where we completed the Milford Track walk, with Ultimate Hikes. There probably isn't room here to fully describe the walk and the experience, and do it justice. From start to finish, the staff at Ultimate Hikes were amazing, helpful, friendly and always ready and happy to put in that bit extra, which makes all the difference. To our hiking guides, Brydie, Hannah, Erwin and Moon, thank you so much, for making our Milford Track walk an experience and a memory to last forever, you were amazing. This walk has something for everyone, starting with a coach trip, followed by a lake cruise to reach the starting point of the walk. Day 2,3 and 4 of the walk takes you along prepared tracks along rivers, through forests, over the awesome Mackinnon Pass, and finally the aptly name Sandfly Point on Mildford Sound. Day 5 is a spectacular cruise on Milford Sound and then a coach trip back to Queenstown. This is really a must do experience for anyone who loves the outdoors, and I guess who want to challenge themselves."
50,A tricky compromise ,"I walked the Milford Track as a solo freedom walker and the reputation for beauty is well earned! Stunning waterfalls (Giants gate is stunning, to say nothing of awe-inspiring Sutherland falls), amazing birdlife, beautiful vistas and ancient forest...it has it all. The task is also fairly manageable but there are parts, such as scrambling down the emergency pass from McKinnon memorial summit, which struck me as fairly dangerous. I also feel that the hut prices are just shy of extortionate for what are essentially very bare-basic facilities and the first and second days could really be merged together. The last day isn't actually as gruelling as the rest but if you are delayed and miss your boat, that could turn into a difficult situation cost and food wise!I'd really like to see DOC tackle the costs and logistics of getting on and off the track."
51,Difficult ,"We walked the Milford (and the Routeburn) as a guided walks in what Ultimate Hikes calls ""The Classic"". This combination was not cheap, but is was worth every cent 200% over. The lodges are spacious and clean, the food excellent, the staff and guides super-pro and friendly as only Kiwi's can be. We had the ideal weather, torrentials rains on the last Milford day.  [-----------] and cristal clear balmy weather on the Routeburn. An experience never to forget.Both tracks are well walkable for reasonably fit people. One has to be able to sustain a couple, like 4 at least, hours on walking boots. Sticks help immensely. So does some walking experience. It is all in the head! The scenery is so stunning that you forget your sore feet though. Plus the welcoming in the Guided Walks lodges, the warm showers, the extensive wine-list and the company of other happy people do wonders. I have attached some panoramic photo's as I can add a thousand more enthoused words, but one (or more)picture say(s) it all!"
52,"Fantastic ""Great Walk""",Wow! Milford track was stunning! Loved every part of it! The first day -5km - was a bit too easy and I feel like you could definitely do longer on this day!! There was bad weather when we did it and an avalanche closed mackinnon pass to we had a free helicopter ride up to the top of the pass which was totally awesome! Walking in the fresh snow on the top of the mountain was insane! The walk down to sandfly hut via the emergency trail was a bit rough on the knees though! Make sure you take mosquito repellent on the Milford track because the mozzies are like small birds!!!
53,Outstanding Walking Track,"We walked the track in the third week of March. Many people had told us what an amazing experience it was so our expectations were very high. Perhaps that was why the trip fell a bit flat for us - or maybe it was the weather. We got no rain at all during the trip. While this did enable us to enjoy great views, we felt a bit like we had missed out on the full experience.  Only the permanent waterfalls were running, and we didn't even get our feet wet. The Clinton river was beautiful and we enjoyed seeing a lot of it as we walked up the Clinton valley. I had a swim at Prairie Lake - it was lovely.The walk over MacKinnon pass was a great day, with spectacular scenery. The Anderson cascades on the way down were my favourite part of the whole trip.  Walking out through the Arthur valley was actually a bit underwhelming, other than the two waterfalls, which were lovely.  It is mostly just very easy track through bush. I think it would be much more of an adventure in the rain. Sometimes it rains so much the track is underwater in places and people have to wade through up to their waist in water! If I did it again I would do it in spring or early summer when it would be wetter and there would still be some snow on the tops, because I think it would be more interesting.  There are many great tramping tracks in New Zealand. This one just didn't stand out as exceptional for me, but I guess for people who haven't done much hiking/tramping in New Zealand it would be a great introduction."
54,Milford Track - Should you spend the extra money for Ultimate Hikes?,"Did the four day 33.5 mile Milford Track walk with Ultimate Hikes. The hike was a little pricey at close to NZD 2000 but did include two nights accommodation at Queenstown, three nights accommodation on the track and one night at Mitre Peak Lodge. Also included was a Milford Sound boat trip with Real Journeys. From the start of the hike right through to returning from Milford Sound on the bus all food and drink (non-alcoholic) is included. The lodges during the walk are great they all have comfortable bunk beds (or a bit more expensive if you want a private room) . Great hot showers and flushing toilets. There are laundry facilities at each lodge with huge drying rooms. So u can finish the day's hiking have a hot shower, then wash your hiking clothes, put them in the drying room and be dry in a few hours, ready to wear clean the next day if you want to. There is lots of food maybe too much, with cooked breakfasts every day, sandwiches and snacks for lunch with a three course meal of quality food every night ie lamb racks, steaks, venison casserole etc. In a way probably too much food, there is no need to take any food. At night you can run a tab for alcoholic drinks. Of course you can get four seasons in one day out on the track and the sandflys can be tough. Every night the guides run a 'foot love' session where you can get bites, blisters etc attended to (a great service). The guides do a great job and are always on hand with advice, medical gear, hot drinks or snacks. On our walk Liv, Tom and Makono-san were great especially Makono-san who is a great girl with 5 years of track experience and fluent in Japanese and English. A fantastic trip and well done to Ultimate Hikes."
55,Ultimate Hikes,"This is rated as the most popular Great Walk in NZ. It's easy to see why. Gorgeous and breathtaking landscapes. Limited amount of people allowed on it per day. Exotic wildlife you can only find in alpine New Zealand... Here's what you need to know. 1. If you are going during busy season, book as soon as booking opens. You can register to be notified by NZ Gov when registration opens. 2. I'm not kidding. I signed into their booking system the moment it opened and within 12 minutes the dates within four days of mine were all sold out. Thankfully I had them held in my shopping cart!3. There are two ways to do this. Through the DOC which is what we did, or through the guided walks. Through DOC you have to pack and carry all your own stuff. With the guided walks, they provide bedding and food and carry most of your stuff for you. But it costs a LOT more. 4. Only 40 people are allowed to start the trail through DOC and 40 with the guided walks. So it can be more crowded than you'd expect, but it's still not bad. 5. SANDFLIES. We laughed at the 80% Deet bug cream at the store. Until we got to Milford. Holy mother. Keep moving and they won't get you. Keep your hut doors closed. I took to sandfly murder with a dirty sock against the hut window. It wasn't pretty. But I was desperate. 6. Kea. These guys are awesome. Parrots that only live in alpine NZ. The little jerks will try to mess with you and steal your food. DO NOT FEED THEM. This track is fun because it's extra remote. To get there you have to drive to the DOC center in Te Anau, take the bus to a boat, and the boat to the trail head. Then walk your 33 miles. The DOC website lets you book all those tickets at once.  walking! :)"
56,Fantastic activity!,"I hiked the Milford Track last week with my mum and I can honestly say it was the most amazing experience of my life. We took the guided option with Ultimate Hikes, and we both had an absolute blast. We were incredibly lucky with brilliant weather 4 of the 5 days and not too many of those pesky sandflies. Ultimate Hikes are a very well-oiled machine - they know what they're doing and they do it extremely well. Communication was excellent right from the moment we booked, all the way til we hopped off the bus at the end. For anyone booking with them, I would advise to listen to everything they have to say and read every bit of information they send - as I mentioned they know what they're talking about and they tell you this information for a reason. We found their packing list brilliant (first time multi-day hike) and we really got a sense of what the track would be like. Still, it was tough - I'm a pretty fit 30-year-old and although I did not struggle, it was definitely no walk in the park. The track can be well-formed in places and you're able to look around and take in the beauty of the place but there are a lot of sections where you have to really pay attention to where your feet are going. Good boots are an absolute must and be sure to break them in. Do prepare for four seasons in one day - we went expecting cold but ended up in shorts and tshirts. It also pays to make sure you have excellent quality clothing - quick dry material (merino), functional items (zip off pants, thermal layers that can be worn as a single layer - and kiwis love their thermals so don't be afraid to get the out-there patterns!!) as this greatly increases your comfort and reduces the weight you have to carry. The lodges are amazing, considering their remoteness. You don't want for ANYTHING. The food is delicious, the staff brilliant, the rooms clean and super comfortable, and what's better than a hot shower at the end of a long day...! (There's actually a bath at the final lodge..... yes, a bath) And the guides. What can I say! There are 4 of them on your walk, plus a fifth who joins you for your descent down Mackinnon Pass. Ours were excellent - Eddie, Hannah, Daile, Kyohei and Ellis - thank you guys for your banter, expert knowledge and friendly smiles. You helped make this hike what it was - a truly amazing experience. You can see your guides, and the rest of your group, as much or as little as you like - even though there's 50 of you (plus the unguided walkers), we found we were by ourselves sometimes for hours at a time. Which to experience the true beauty, isolation and serenity of this place, I think you really need to do. There's not much I can really say about the actual walk itself and the scenery you see - no amount of words can really do it justice. You'll just have to get out there and do the track for yourself!! PS there's a helicopter transfer option from Milford Sound back to Queenstown instead of taking the coach - it's expensive but if you can fit it in your budget, make sure you do it - it is worth every cent!!PPS there is an optional walk at the end of day 3 - after the epic crossing of Mackinnon Pass - to Sutherland Falls. Sure, you see plenty of falls on the main track, but this one is exceptional. Make sure you do it because it's SO worth it."
57,If there's one thing on your bucket list - let this be it!,I spent Christmas walking the Milford Track. It was a challenging walk but definitely one of last years highlights. The scenery is breathtaking. A steep climb days one and two and a very steep descent on day three with alpine waterfalls following you down the mountains. Finish the day with a detour to Sutherland Falls - it's magnificent!
58,It is the finest walk in the world,"The Milford Track was completely booked 2 months before our 16-day trip to NZ. We contacted EasyHike and they were able to reserve hut spaces for me and my partner. So Thankful! Plus, they relocated our car for us and provided the food we would need on hike. They made it so easy. The Milford Track is beautiful. The most beautiful part is MacKinnon Pass. The worst part, the sand flies. Seriously, bring bug spray with 100% DEET. Natural stuff does not work and they just flinch with anything less than 100% DEET."
59,Definitely worth doing,"We did the track as ""independant Walkers"" and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The track is very well maintained but kept very natural.  The DOC Huts are of a good standard with water and flushing toilets (no showers).  The DOC staff are very knowlegable and helpful. However never under estimate the power of nature  - you need to be well equipped for this walk - you could literally be walking in the rain for 4 days (we even got snow) so its vital you have good boots, wet weather gear and warm clothes.  You need to be resoanably fit and without injuries.  Make sure you have insect repellant and be prepared to be crossing rivers oftne up to waist deep.  Be prepared to get wet - they dont call it the wettest place on earth for nothing but it is well worth it."
60,Most amazing experience ever,"Having done the Milford Track previously guided, it was quite a difference experience with kids and unguided.  We went with about 3 other familys.  The kids loved it and had a blast....they had energy to burn and it was an amazing experience.  The scenery, wildlife,huts etc are all absolutely fantastic.  Found it hard going to carry all food etc for 5 people.  When you arrive at the hut you are pretty tired but you have to start cooking before the lights go out and get your kids sorted.  Was good lesson for them in having to carry their own gear and manage themselves.  At the end of the trek we went out on the Doubtful sound overnight which was spectacular.  You can sleep overnight and have dinner etc go kayaking, explore.....such a lovely thing to finish off a very memorable trip.  Kids ranged from 8 - 14 years."
61,Fabulous; fabulous; fabulous,"Ultimate Hikes couldn't be better.  The guides are competent, cheerful, knowledgeable and patient. I remember Mark, Willem, Jules, Lilidh and Veronica among others.  The lodges are welcoming at night, super comfortable with everything amenity and the scenery is breathtaking, the camaraderie of the group enjoyable.  However, I have reservations about recommending unless you are super fit for hiking. I am a strong, physically active woman in her 70s , used to challenges.  But 3 days in the rain, especially over the Mackinnon Pass was much more demanding than I could have imagined, and which took longer than forecast.  Fortunately I have no health problems but was certainly concerned about those who had knee, hip, ankle, feet or back vulnerabilities and would warn those who do have these to reconsider embarking on this walk. We had a lot of rain and I understand from talking to others that this is to be expected and that it is the rain that creates the waterfalls which everyone admires. It is suggested that you check the glue of your hiking boots...this is a serious request as a number of hikers' shoes broke open as a result of walking for some time in deep rain-covered paths.  I was pleased I'd bought new boots. Ultimate Hikes is to be commended on a well-oiled set of systems including the helicopter that is busy many days moving people around when the route becomes impassable.  On reflection, I wish I'd attempted this 10-15 years ago!  If your main physical activity is bush walking/hiking, including on climbs, you should be fine!"
62,"Awesome ""Great Walk"" experience","I did the self-guided hike in February 2012 and I could still go on and on about how beautiful it was. We had a little bit of rain the first night but beautiful weather all the other nights (and days!). I enjoyed the company of most of my fellow hikers and could easily avoid the ones who were a bit on the boisterous side, and I had great fun. This was my first multi-day hike, first hut, and I did just fine, except for sacrificing a toenail to the gods of Milford. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.The DOC huts were fine, the wardens were all three so very different, and ... oh, it was just fantastic.I booked in September '11 and late February was the earliest date I could get, so if you are interested in the hike, sign up early!"
63,Re: Only 1 Star - Track Condition Poor For NZ Premier Track Crap.,"My girlfriend and I did the unguided hike of the Milford Track on Nov 18-21.  Wow.  It was definitely worth the 15 hour flight.  Before we left, we intentionally didn’t look at too many pictures ahead of time and we’re glad we hadn’t.  The scenery got better each day – culminating with the amazing Mackinnon Pass views on day 3.  We had 4 straight days of sunny weather – some would say lucky - though we were wishing for at least 1 or 2 days of rain to see all of the waterfalls roaring and get the true ""Milford Experience"".  We still used our rain jacket and pants on the Mackinnon pass because of cold/wind. Here’s the lowdown:Getting there – we booked with Tracknet shuttle and they picked us up from Queenstown Airport.  They were great – on-time, and even let us store a bag in their facility while we were on the track.  They also provided transport back from the Milford Sound dock (the scenery on the bus ride back on the Milford Road is amazing…like Yosemite Valley…but even better).The Hike – Day 1 – It’s a short and flat 3.1 miles thru the woods once you step off the boat to the Neale Burn Hut.  The first thing we noticed about the trail were the beautiful bird songs – the songs stay with you all 4 days.  Once you arrive at the hut, there are 2 equally sized bunk-bed rooms here (hold 20 each), a cooking/eating facility, and 4 toilets/3 wash sinks.  As you arrive, try to grab a bunk that isn’t near the door (and bring ear plugs!).  Be prepared for your first encounter with sandflies…as soon as you stop there they will find you.  Have your bug spray (high % deet seemed to work, the picardin stuff we bought at the DOC center didn’t).  The sandflies seem to go away at night and didn’t bother us while sleeping.  Scenery is nice…but it’s going to get better.  If it’s clear, the morning sunlight shining off the peaks is cool.  You’ll be lucky if you get Ranger Ross – he is close to 70 – and has a great attitude/sense of humor.  Go on the nature walk with him.  Enjoy the pepper (you’ll know what I mean later…).  Everyone seemed to fall asleep by 10.Day 2 – It’s a 10.2 mile hike over mostly flat ground until the last mile.  While the last mile was a unanimous unwelcome climb, you’ll find the location of the Mintaro Hut worth the climb.  More on the hut later.  The hike itself travels thru beautiful, lush mossy/ferned forests…until it breaks into a clearing that wows you…  You’ll see stunning cliff walls on both sides of the valley with numerous waterfalls, and glaciers/snow at the higher elevations.  Take the side trip to Hidden Lake for a nice snack break.  Keep walking and eventually you get to the avalanche chutes.  Signs there tell you to keep moving thru the areas and we did…because we could hear a few avalanches falling to our left.  We did get to see a few, they were smaller, but still impressive.  They never got close to us but I wouldn’t linger.  The sandflies don’t bother you on the trail unless you sit still too long…even then they really weren’t too bad on the trails – only near the huts.  Now back to the hut… after having done the unguided hike I would never recommend to my hiking friends the guided hike for one main reason – the Mintaro Hut.  It’s location is amazing – you can sit on its front porch and face a sheer mountain wall with glaciers at the top and watch nature put a little show on as a few avalanches fall every hour…what a show.  The mountain seems close enough to touch. I’m not sure how long this goes on thru the year, but during our stay in late November it was amazing.  You could even hear them at night.  Here there is 1 bunkhouse with about 20 bunks on the top floor, and 10 each in 2 lower rooms.  The kitchen is also on the lower floors (communal cooking/eating was cool – you get to meet all sorts of people from everywhere – and just like grade school you can trade food).  Each hut has a wood burning stove to heat it – wood is available and each night folks fired up the stove in each hut.  That said, we were never even close to cold in the sleeping huts which don’t have any heat sources.  As for the bathrooms – same story here: 3 clean toilets, 4 clean sinks w mirrors (no soap) – never seemed too busy, but we tried to beat the rush each morning to wash up.  If you’re into freezing cold water, you will like washing up in the sinks.  Oh yeah, and don’t even think of whispering/talking when ranger Kate is giving her presentation…or you will getting a swift talking to!  Day 3 – This is the day…8.7 miles to Dumpling Hut.  Eat a hearty breakfast because this morning you climb for a few hours.  If I had to guess, it’s about a 1,500-1,700 foot climb that takes about 2 hours.  We started around 7:30AM – and arrived at the pass around 9:45AM. It can be misty/foggy in the morning as you approach the pass – as it was this morning – but have patience (and extra layers handy – it’s cold and windy! – and mind your packs – the Kea birds tore into a few unattended packs) …wait until the mist clears and….WOW…the pictures just don’t do it justice.  Not even close.  Snow covered peaks…a 360 degree view of 2 valleys, mountains, glaciers, rivers, small lakes, a snowy cirque…you’re even up close to the higher sections of the wall that was putting on the avalanche show the evening before.  If you are praying for clear weather – this is the moment you want it.  The Mackinnon Pass refuge is a great place to get inside and wait for the weather to clear or to have a hot snack (there is a stove there, water – and the famous “loo with a view” – a portojohn with a window facing down the Clinton Valley).  If you like downhill you’ll enjoy the next few hours. We took the emergency route due to avalanche danger and it drops quickly – watch your step as it is a rough trail (bring hiking sticks – they are a must for this section).  You continue past a river section with cool waterfalls and hike mostly thru woods until you reach Dumpling Hut.  Unfortunately the 1.5 hour roundtrip side-trip to Sutherland Falls was closed due to rockfall – it’s accessed at Quintin Lodge (where you can get water/bathroom break – there are bathrooms spaced throughout the trail system). You can still get limited peek-a-boo views of the falls thru the trees as you hike towards Dumpling.  Dumpling Hut seems to be the newest hut and offers 4 rooms with about 10 bunks in each.  Bathrooms = 3, sinks = 4.  There’s a swimming hole/rock beach nearby – worth a visit when it’s hot – but no one lingered too long – the water was freezing and the sandflies hungry.  Day 4 – 11.2 miles to the boat.  This is a mostly flat section that seems to pass quickly.  You cross a swing bridge (look for eels below) and soon see beautiful Mackay Falls and Bell Rock.  Keep huffing and eventually you get to Giant Gate shelter – we had a snack there. You pass Lake Ada and you know you’re getting close to the end.  Now…here’s the trick.  If you go too fast, you get to Sandfly Point too early and, well, donate blood.  If you go too slow you miss the boat (and it does leave on-time).  We went too quickly and had to loiter at the 33 mile marker (every mile has a marker) for about 20 minutes – this is the last mile marker before the boat landing and is about 20-30 minutes from the dock.  There was a group of us there waiting there at 33 and the sandflies weren’t present.  We then hit the Point, took the obligatory picture by the old sign-post and hopped the boat.  The 20 minute boat ride to the Milford Road dock is short, but beautiful.  Stay on the back deck to get the views, though you might get a little wet.  The Tracknet bus will be there in the lot waiting for you – enjoy the scenic bus ride – and enjoy some buffet dinners in Queenstown (Ok – and 1 stop into McDonalds) for the next 4 days like we did…Total Cost: Permits/Boat = approx. $250/person, Tracknet Shuttle = $150/personEnjoy."
64,Scenery Amazing but Track Condition Very Poor for the NZ Premier Track,"Did the track on our own. Enjoted every minute. Weather was magnificant, and climbed McKinnon Pass twice due to early arrival to the hut on Day 2 and accepting the recommendation of the track officials that ""if the weather is nice, climb the pass because we can not guarantee good weather the day after"". Everywhere you go you enjoy nature at its best: streams and rivers, plants and trees, valleys and mountains. Booked 6 months in advance!"
65,Jaw dropping scenery everywhere,"Milford Track on the South Island of New Zealand is as good as it gets. Great hike, pristine scenery, like no other experience. Well organized exccellent guides and it is really nice to get a hot shower, good meal and fesh bed at the end of the day."
66,Milford Track with kids - unguided,"A group of friends and I joined up with the Ultimate Hikes in New Zealand and did the Milford Track guided hike for 4 nites and 5 days.  It was an adventure that we will all remember.  The guides were great, lodging was very comfortable, good food and met some really nice people from all over the world.  The scenery was beautiful and the water so clean and pristine.  The hike itself was great and not too difficult.  It might be a bit tiring for those who are not use to hiking.  You need to be able to hike anywhere from 9-13 miles a day while backpacking your belongings.  My advice would be to follow the guidelines that the Ultimate Hikes suggests.  You will be just fine and well taken care of.  The last adventure on this experience is a boat  ride on the Milford Sound. Awesome!"
67,If you need a boat - go for Fjordland Water Taxi,"The Milford Track is a spectacular hike which I would strongly recommend - but it isn't a walk in the park and warrants a few more words of caution than I came across when doing my research. We did the self-guided hike, so here is the lowdown for those considering it:Book early:- Really early. We booked six months in advance and got the last two spots for our dates.Accommodation:- For us, self-guided was definitely the way to go, you are in control of your pace, your side trips and feel like you're stepping into the shoes of a ""real"" tramper.- Fairly basic conditions: bunk rooms, no showers, limited hours of lighting. Which is perfect for suburban dwellers like myself as it gives you some downtime from gadgets and luxuries and you earn that feeling of achievement (prove to yourself that, yes, you can survive without your skinny latte for a couple of days). Saying that, the huts have gas for cooking, fireplaces and proper toilets so there are some luxuries!- It's all communal and you will be staying with the same 40 people everyday. But the fact that they're organised and interested enough to book the self-guided means you will at least have something in common. We met some wonderful people and had a fantastic time.What to take:- You need to take everything with you except water and gas. Pots or pans, bottles, utensils, bedding are not provided. Dehydrated meals will become your new best friend. Tap water is safe as is the water from streams. Bring a camera, of course. Headlamps or a torch are essential as there is no electricity apart from lights in the dining room for two hours at night and in the morning, no lighting at all in the bunk rooms. Insect repellant. - Bin bags. What you take in, you must take out again. There are no bins, so you need to carry your rubbish with you the whole 4 days- WATERPROOF stuff. Lots of it. And i don't mean prepare for drizzle. Prepare for non-stop, heavy rain for the entire 6-8 hours of every day you walk. And prepare for feet getting completely submerged in ""puddles"". Then if it's dry, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise!- A change of clothes. Because you will get soaked through even with fancy waterproofs, and they won't dry overnight.- Ear plus if you're a light sleeper. There will be at least one snorer.- Ibuprofen if you get knee painThe walk:- Stunning. Each day is different, from walking amongst the trees to mountain sides to waterfalls and valleys.- If the weather is dry, this walk is very easy for someone reasonably fit, and a medium walk for someone with average/moderate fitness. However, chances are the weather won't be dry - which means you need to take it slow, concentrate more and get wet and cold in the process, so it gets harder for everyone.- BE CAREFUL ON DAY 2 if it has been raining. The recent tragedy experienced on this walk shows how deadly this track can turn in bad weather. There is a small basic shelter called Bus Stop where you should wait if the river looks too hard to cross. The water level can rise and fall dramatically within a short time period so if in doubt, it is better to wait. Yes, you'll be a bit cold and miserable, but it's worth it to be safe.- If you have a dodgy knee, bring poles for support on Day 3 when there is a long stint of downhill. Not very steep but just goes on for hours.Why do it?- I've personally never experienced landscape like this anywhere else. It is just beautiful.- Its a great way to immerse yourself in the nature of New Zealand- You don't need to contend with altitude sickness, snakes, crowds, litter like some other hikes in the worldEveryone will have a different opinion and experience but I hope this helps others when planning their trip."
68,Spectacular ,"I've hiked all over the world: western US and Canada, Switzerland, British Isles.  New Zealand's Milford Track rates close to the very top of the list.  There are two ways to do the track:  on your own, carrying most of your own gear, cooking your own food and staying in rustic huts (""freedom walker"") or with a guided party and staying in relatively cushy dormitories and being served full meals.  Either way, the trip is out of this world.  Warning:  weather can be iffy, because this country gets a lot of rain.  If you hike it in a heavy rain, beware (the river levels rise significantly, and crossings can be dangerous).  We went in March, and hit dry, sunny weather for the entire trip.  The first and last days of the hike are easy (mostly level), but the second day (when you climb over MacKinnon Pass and then descend) involves rocky trail and significant grades.  Be in shape!  At lower elevations, the terrain is rain forest.  Up high, it's alpine country.  Views are out of this world.  You'll meet hikers from all over the world.  My dad hiked it when he was 84 (had to get special permission because of his age)."
69,Amazing trek with many waterfalls (and sandflyes:))),"This self-proclaimed 'best walk in the world' is right up there with some of the most amazing places I've been in the world.  The hike itself is the perfect length.  My husband and I are fit, but not zealots, and we had a great experience.  The DoC system works flawlessly, from the transportation to the hut system, worth the $.  The huts are large and the bunks have mattresses, the bathrooms are clean and lovely - actually flush toilets!  The kitchen huts are fitted with gas cookers - plenty, we never had to wait to make our meals.  And, well, then there is the natural beauty surrounding you.  We had awesome and clear warm weather.  OH WOW!  I can imagine I'd cancel if the forecast was for 4 days of rain, as the trail can flood... but the beach forests, the McKinnon pass, and then the walk into and boat ride across Milford Sound.  WOW.  Book early and plan your trip around it.  It is truly amazing."
70,Beutiful Tramp,"We have just completed the Milford Track independently through DOC.  We had a fantastic time, what an incredible experience.  We had a good mix of weather, a bit of rain to experience overflowing streams and an abundance of waterfalls and clear skies to enjoy the magnificent views on top of McKinnon's pass and the views to Sutherland Falls on the descent.  The huts and facilities were fantastic, not luxury but certainly very comfortable, well laid out and clean, and the rangers were extremely informative, friendly and helpful.  We used Easyhike to relocate our rental car from Te Anau Downs where you catch the ferry to the start of the walk to Milford Sound where we ended.  They provided a top class service with excellent communication all the way.  I would highly recommend their service to anyone who wants flexibility at the start or end of the walk."
71,Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes,"I believe this is one of the most expensive/inaccessible walks, but worth it. As with all great walks, you really get to know the people who signed up with you. We had a great group and a lovely time. It rained in true Fiordland style on the last 2 days, which made it difficult to see the views, but there were plenty of keas and wekas to keep us company, and unfortunately, entirely too many sandflies."
72,"Cleansing, wonderful trek","If you only ever do one trek in your life, make sure you do the Milford Track. It is absolutely stunning every step of the way. Make sure your camera is fully charged as there are postcard moments almost every five seconds. I had a sore neck from looking up every five seconds and going ""wow, wow , wow"". We traveled as a family, My wife and I (in our 50's) my son (17) and my daughter (14), we are all reasonably fit but still came out quite exhausted and leg and foot sore on the last day. The huts are well equiped with a kitchen and dining area. You do need to bring all cooking and eating utensils. As well as a lighter. The bunk rooms are clean but DO BRING EAR PLUGS ( 'bluetack' is great) as the other campers snoring can certainly interfere with much needed sleep. Be prepared for all sorts of weather as It can change very quickly, very fast. If you buy new hiking boots make sure you wear them in, but still bring plasters and pads for the inevitable blisters. A trek that we will never forget, a bit of a challenge but oh so worth it."
73,New Zealand at its best,We did our Milford Sound Walk with Ultimate Hikes and They did a wonderful job of looking after us. I highly recommend their services.      The track itself is not a hard/challenging track to walk but it must be remembered that weather conditions will play a large part in just how hard it will get. We were fairly lucky with the weather and had reasonable temperatures with only 1 day of rain. The track did flood in some parts but we were able to walk through the water (knee deep)  As we went over McKinnions pass it was a balmy 3 deg below with a 60 km per hr wind...wind chill made it about -12........in retrospect before we ascended the pass we were walking in shorts and T shirtsThe hardest part of the walk is not the climb...it is the decent on the other side  but like most things the achievement makes it all worthwhile...and you are doing this in some of the most spectacular scenery in the world
74,A trip for your Bucket List,"I did the Milford Track walk in late November 2018 as a guided walk run by Ultimate Hikes. There were 50 walkers in the group accompanied by 4 guides. The pre-walk information was very useful.We were lucky with the weather which was fine most of the time, particularly going over the Mackinnon Pass. The food and accommodation provided in the Lodges each night was superb. We had gourmet meals every night. The guides were great, well-trained and informative. They were particularly good at encouraging people who were finding the going difficult. The third day over the Mackinnon Pass is the most difficult as the track requires a gradual climbing followed by a steep descent. I would recommend this guided walk as an easier way of doing the track compared to independent walking and staying in DOC (Department of Conservation) huts."
75,The Milford Track walk with Ultimate Hikes New Zealand,"Spent 10 years dreaming of doing this walk, and it exceeded my expectations!  Doing the walk via the Ultimate Hikes company is TOTALLY worth it, they are amazing.  You do need to be prepared to walk over 10 miles a day, with some challenging weather at times, but that just makes it all the more satisfying.  LOVE the Milford Track!"
76,Sublime,"Absolutely loved our milford track experience with ultimate hikes guides Ondo, Colette, Shaun and Graham.  They are excellent guides and really took great care of us.  The UH huts are wonderful, with Pompolona being practically palatial.  The food is great.  Afternoon treats of different kinds upon arrival at each hut were great.  A couple of tips that l haven’t seen documented....If the bumblebees are out, as they were with us, they are very curious and very much like to invade your space!  They are particularly attracted to blue clothing, and citronella/lemon smelling bug repellent.  Consider yourself warned.  🤣.   Wear repellent for the sandflies though because those damn things will eat you alive.  Go down to the river at the boathouse stop—some of the most magic views on the hike.  Also, watch out for the wekas...they like to steal stuff, as do the keas.  Lastly, be aware that the downhill after Mackinnon pass is very rocky - and I mean big rocks you have to clamor over, and it was extremely difficult with dodgy knees...so make sure to take TWO poles.  However, we will be back to do some other great hikes!"
77,Milford Track Guided Walk: best starting point,"We walked the Milford track in early February using the Dept of Conservation huts and carrying our own sleeping bag & food etc (as opposed to the Ultimate Hikes guided walk).  From the start of our journey in Te Anau, to the boat trip across the lake and along the entire 54 km walk, we were in awe!  This is without doubt THE MOST beautiful part of New Zealand.  The scale of the mountains, the crystal clear rivers, the lakes at the bottom of enormous waterfalls and the moss cover forests (where we are sure the fairies live) were unbelievable.The DOC (Dept of Conservation) huts were excellent. They were modern, well equipped with gas cookers, flush toilets, individual bunks (as opposed to platform bunks) in rooms of 10-12 and come with an enthusiastic resident ranger who will give advice surrounding area, a weather forecast and the what to expect on the track ahead.Walking this way is very cheap, but it won't suit everyone to carry around 12 kg on their back or not having a hot shower every day.  But if you can hack it - do it!"
78,Amazing- Lord of the Rings meets Jurassic Park,"We have now done this track twice, each time the comfortable way, with guides, three course meals and hot baths each night, and drying facilities, hot drinks at morning and afternoon tea and lunchtime (pretty good when you are wet and cold). The views in the rain are also fantastic: Waterfalls everywhere, drifts of misty rain, remarkably varied scenery. Everywhere evidence of the force of nature: new track markings because of recent avalanches, scars down the mountain with loss of trees (from the avalanches). The beech forests of the Clinton valley where every tree is an ecosystem in itself.This time we had fine weather for the first three days and so got to see the full majesty of the mountains at the top of MacKinnon pass, and had time to take photographs of all the alpine (and other) plants in bloom.  If you like walking, this is a must do. (and if you do it the easy way you still could be doing it in your nineties..using two sticks.)"
79,We tried the 1 day intro and will be back to take it on,"We just finished the Milford Track walk today with Ultimate Hikes! Wow-what an experience! Every dollar we spent was well worth it-including the boots, pack and merino we also purchased before leaving home. Every day was so fine, blue with no wind or rain.I had been on crutches 4 weeks ago but was determined I was doing this, so did a late booking 3 weeks from our start date in mid April.  Not a fan of heights, I knew mentally I would have to dig deep. Clambering over boulders, walking on thin ledges, going down stairs beside a waterfall gives one a sense of accomplishment. Even sitting on the long drop at the top of McKinnon Pass was incredible. We stayed in multi share lodges and the facilities were great, our guides were exceptional, the food delicious and I would highly recommend hiking with Ultimate Hikes! Make sure you take hikers fleece for between your toes. We even saw a kiwi at 2am outside one lodge on the way to the loo-and no it wasn’t a weka."
80,Wow,I have always wanted to go to this gem of New Zealand and now I can say I have 'Knocked the bugger off.' I am so glad I completed it. I met fabulous people and such stunning scenery. The best bit was reconnecting with nature and seeing New Zealand at its best. We really do live in god zone!
81,"Listed as a ""Great Walk"" in NZ - and it is!","My husband and I hiked the Milford Track in February as independent (non-guided) walkers. We felt very privileged to be able to explore this beautiful area! This site already has many well written detailed descriptions of the trail so I will just say that it does in fact warrant the superlatives that you have heard.A few points:1. Booking: Book early!!!2. Overall level of strenuousness: You may have read that ""any reasonably fit person can do this hike"". This may be true, but don't underestimate it. Its not a walk in the park! !f you do the independent version, you will be carrying a 20 -30 lb backpack for up to 12 miles a day over occasionally challenging terrain in the rain. By the time we hit sandfly point, I was pretty dang tired.3. DOC hut system: Hats off to New Zealand's DOC! The huts are awesome! It felt positively luxurious to have flush toilets, running water (cold), a dry roof over our heads, and a mattress to sleep on. There is even a wash room and you can heat a bit of water to clean up.4. Crowds/people: The trail never felt crowded. In fact, for the first 2 days, we often walked alone for miles without seeing or hearing anyone else. At night its neat to get to know the others in your group who have also come from all over the world for the same experience.5. Weather: Its beautiful in the sun, but amazing in the rain!6. Milford Sound: We chose to finish our tramp with a cruise of the Sound. After working so hard, it was fun to sit back and drink tea and just watch the scenery float by.Bottom line, we are both so glad we did this hike! Thanks, New Zealand!"
82,Exceptional Country!,The walk was achievable for most standards and the huts for independent hikers are really brilliant (even better than the runnish abuzzy motorhome we had for the previous week). We had an excellent time and have some beautiful photos and memories.
83,"If Milford Track is Booked, Contact EasyHike...Also, Bring SERIOUS Bug Spray!",My husband and I just completed the Milford Track Great Walk. It is a great adventure with wonderful scenery.  Every day nature throws another challenge your way but the tracks are beautifully maintained by DOC. The huts are very well equipped with comfortable beds and amenities.This is the best experience I have had. If you are considering doing this walk - do it! You will not regret it.
84,Wonderful 4 day hike,"Did the Ultimate Hikes Milford Track guided tour. The track was amazing from beginning to end. Incredible beech and fern forests, to waterfalls, lakes, pristine rivers, mountain vistas, native birds...not an easy walk as it requires decent fitness and strong legs and ankles."
85,Excellent hike - know your liabilities ,"The walk is a ""great walk"". !  The walk itself is not difficult at all.  The downhill is the most strenuous.  There are some stunning vistas, wonderful goblin forests,and amazing waterfalls.   I would so stress NOT to do this walk in the off-season when the bridges have been removed.  The track is well marked, and easy to walk.  Having done routeburn, Kepler and Milford I would rate kepler my favourite (but we had a stunning sunny day along the ridgetops).  The rest of our family liked the Routeburn the best (but we had a metre of snow at Harris Saddle so I think that was the added attraction). For the Milford we were unable to book a freedom hike as it sells out so fast.  So we did the Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes guided walk. One  thing really let the whole experience down as it was a costly trip for our family of four and we are still not sure why we were valued less than other clients.  Be aware that not all rooms are created equal with Ultimate Hikes. We were unable to book a freedom walk so booked with Ultimate Hikes 7 months in advance (apparently the first to book the dates thus we were clients 1.2,3 and 4). We were surprised when we arrived at the first lodge to be allocated a room right next to the noisey kitchen. My husband had a head cold and wasnt well and wanted to rest – not happening with the radio blaring and noise from the kitchen. And while all the other rooms of our type had huge windows overlooking the lovely scenery – we had what would be close to a wardrobe with no view. It was noisey, people walking past and not up to the standard of other rooms. It should not be used, or should be advised to clients in advance. In fact – we came back from nature walk and our door was wide open. UM! We mentioned this to the manager who said we would get a great room at Mitre Peak Lodge to make up for it. That didnt happen. At the next lodge we were closest to the generator and drying room – which had frequent visitors and noise. At Mitre peak Lodge our room (and it seems many others) were so hot and stuffy from the radiator pipes that we slept on the floor.Our friends booked the same deal as us and had wonderful rooms the whole way – their final night being a suite with jacuzzi, lounge and more than double the size of our room. It seems we booked the same, paid the same, and we booked before them – but the standard of our rooms wasnt anywhere near the standard of the rooms they had.I raised this with Ultimate Hikes GM who advises “we are aware that one of our ensuite rooms is location without a view ..... While i accept that you feel you feel you have been unfairly treated compared to your friends, I can only say that with all accommodation, and especially buildings dating back to a number of decades, not all rooms are created equal. Rooms are allocated on an ad hoc basis...”Needless to say, our kids had better rooms than we did. So if you are booking do request ES1 (if it is the same as our friends you would do very well), and do stipulate that you DO NOT want any ensuite room without a view at any of the lodges.Its not a great start to be stuck in a wardrobe room when fellow walkers who paid the same are in spacious rooms with amazing windows and scenery – but worst to not even get a proper explanation. I do suggest you confirm the standard of room when booking i.e. large window with view of scenery, away from kitchen.The other thing I missed about freedom hiking was the ability to do what you wanted when you wanted.  The regimented meal times, hiking times etc was not our usual experience of hiking.  And there is something immensely satisfying with cooking a simple meal over a cooker and enjoying it under the stars.  However, we had excellent weather – so Im sure if it was pouring rain the whole time our experience would have been much more thankful for the great bed and facilities.One other thing we noticed between the guided and freedom hikes. We had a small group of Australian woman who drunk too much alcohol each night. They were VERY loud, screeching laughter and noisey. It was humerous the first night. By the second and subsequent nights we (and others) would leave the lounge early as they took over and it was too noisey - and they were no longer funny. I have never encountered a drunk freedom camper on my hikes! We arent drinkers, so our bill at the the end of the guided walk was NIL. One lady advised she had a $600 bill for wine alone! She thought it was well spent. management reply to our complaint was absolutely shocking. They admitted the standard of rooms varies – but basically said too bad, luck of draw!. But the weather played its part beautifully, the drying rooms were awesome and guides really did their best so it was a good trip!  The meals were very good (not our usual hiking food).  Breakfasts were buffet style.  Lunches were make your own from the excellent selection.  The walk itself is not difficult at all.  The downhill is the most strenuous.  At the end of the day I enjoyed a lovely walk with family in the outdoors. thats always great.  Ive rated Milford Track 4 stars (but Ultimate Hikes would not get that rating)"
86,Amazing 4 Day Hike,"The Milford Track while extremely popular and as a result very difficult to get on, is well worth the effort.  Seventy five percent of the summer booking occurred within 24 hours of the season opening.  The Milford Track is a unique blend of beautiful river and alpine views.  It is a four day, managed hike with huts provided at each stopping point. The pace of travel is strictly controlled.  The huts offer just the basic needs, but are spacious, clean and quite comfortable.  Rangers are located at each hut and they provide excellent information about the history and local environs in a humorous way that is easy to listen to and remember.  The trek start and finishes with boat ride which must be booked in addition to the trek booking.  The path starts out wide and easy to walk but as the elevation increases the path becomes narrower and steeper.  Rain is always a factor and really good rain gears is a must.  A few members of our independent hiking group had to wade through chest deep water, while we trod through knee deep water an hour later.  However even in the rainiest of conditions, the Milford track is magical with numerous waterfalls erupting on the steep mountain sides.  The rangers ensure that the path, while sometimes exciting and a bit difficult, is passible before allowing trekkers to proceed.  There are numerous birds, unique plants and for those who fish, numerous brown trout along the route.This track is not cheap, but it is well worth the effort."
87,Lucky with the weather,"Taking the guided option meant spending more money but it was well worth it. The track itself is said to be the 'finest walk in the world' and it certainly lives up to that. Note though, that in the information given, it says you need MODERATE FITNESS. My suggestion is that this description is for trampers. Urban walkers need to be very well prepared, fit and very used to steep hills and rough, stony track conditions.You should train with a pack on too if you are not used to carrying one. Some people found it very difficult, as it exceeded their expectation of 'difficult'. The organisation Ultimate Hikes, is a well oiled machine - guides were great. They were friendly, empathetic, knowledgeable and on hand at all times. The food and accomodation was excellent. The choices for dinner were sometimes hard to make - shall I have the vegetarian option, yum yum or fresh, wild, slow-cooked venison, or fresh salmon?? The organisation provides an excellent briefing, back-packs should you need them, and various other supplies. Everything was clearly explained and worked like clockwork. Also listen to advise about rain as it rains often very heavily 2 out of 3 days down there. We were very fortunate in that we only had a morning of thick misty rain but that is unusual.All in all, my experience of walking the 4 day, 54km track with Ultimate Hikes was well and truly worth every minute."
88,WAOUH !!!,"I dreamed of hiking the Milford Track for years, and was finally afforded the opportunity this past November. I went with Ultimate Hikes, and they were excellent! The lodges were well equipped and comfortable, the meals were gourmet quality, and the guides were well-trained and very personable. We had nothing but pouring rain on the 2nd day, snow on McKinnon Pass on the 3rd day, and beautiful sunshine on the 4th day. But on each day I was well-prepared thanks to the pre-departure orientation from Ultimate Hikes.The trail itself was heaven. The toilets and long-drops were strategically placed so there was no concern about nature calling. Day 3 was a challenge, but do-able for most. There were 2 people in our group of 50 who decided not to take a chance and they headed back to the start on Day 3 and met us at the end. I would rate this hike ""moderate"" for difficulty.You can do this hike as an independent, but I strongly recommend the guided hike with Ultimate Hikes if you can afford it. Ultimate Hikes is the only licensed outfitter who are permitted on the trail, and they own and operate their lodges."
89,Absolutely Stunning,"The Milford Track features a mountain pass. It's not a wide flat footpath for people who don't want to have to watch their step. I'd be gutted if they turned the Milford Track into a smooth and tame road for people who can't handle the outdoors. 1 star indeed... I don't think it's NZ's ""best"" Great Walk. I prefer the Kepler and Routeburn for sheer spectacular scenery. But it's not 1 Star. I think, to walk the Milford Track and give it 1 star, you'd have to be very hard to please. I wonder how many other people think the Milford Track is a 1 star attraction..."
90,Most beautiful trail I have hiked in my 25 years of hiking,"My husband and I hiked the Milford Track at the end of January 2012. We (he) booked this as soon as the date opened in summer 2011- it's that popular- and worth it. We hiked with the independent walkers, and really liked the sense of camaraderie formed by the group of 40 in a very short time. I compare my sense of accomplishment after completing it to running a marathon. We are of average-above average fitness and found it challenging, specifically the 6 miles of downhill after the summit on day 3, but you are not going to get lost and the flush toilets/beds at the end of the day are really appreciated. We did not do the other walks in the area- Routeburn, etc. I would follow other lists of suggested things to pack (in drybags/ziplocks), and nothing more (no, not your two cameras like us.)."
91,An Iconic Hike with Ultimate HIkes,"Where to start? This hike gave everything, I cannot recommend the Milford track  highly enough. The views were simply breath taking.From the boat trip out to the beginning of the hike on Lake Te Anau to the ferry ride back to Milford sound, this journey has it all. Chrystal clear rivers and streams, native bush, lichen covered Beech forest, alpine plants, alpine streams, rivers, waterfalls, ice cliffs, mountain passes, mountains, rocks, avalanches, slips, beachs, coloured rocks, native timbers, native birds and extremely friendly sand fliesThe huts are easy to use, the rangers knowledgeable.My tip is take your time dont race, use every hour of day light you can on the track.Accept the top bunks, late meals and lack of sleep, ignore those clowns who get up before sunrise and race to the next hut to prove how clever they are and then they spend the rest of the time playing cards or reading.We also met a whole lot of great people from around the world. We did the track with our two teenage kids ,boy and girl, and they were just as blown away as us.This is a stunning part of the earth with sooooo much to see, (information overload!) that changes every hour along the way, take your time and savour the finest walk in the world!!!"
92,Ultimate Hikes - Milford Track,Loved the whole experience. Boat driver from Te Anau Downs was very friendly and informative. Track wardens at each hut were the same especially Jen at Dumpling Hut. Huts very nice as were toilets etc. Well groomed track. You still need to be prepared for all weather and long days of walking.
93,Unforgettable experience! ,"We decided on the Milford Track last month to celebrate a few milestones. While the distances were challenging, there was a view we could handle it. We did the walk with Ultimate Hikes which was fantastic. Such a great decision as they have the client experience front of mind.The track is challenging but not hard. The distances are the real gotcha rather than impossible mountains or deep ravines. You will be walking 18-22km per day for multiple days. So why do this walk? There are three great reasons. 1. Milford Sound and Fjordland National Park are hard to get a sense of in a short timeframe. Most people visit and take a cruise, or complete a couple of half day walks and return to the lodge. The Milford Track gives you the immersive experience. By walking through the landscape, you get a better sense of the scale, beauty and ruggedness of this area of the South Island. The pace allows you to see and appreciate the landscape, wildlife and plants that make this region one of the wonders of the world. 2. There are few places in the world where the landscape and micro climates have not been altered by the modern world. The NZ government, DoC and Ultimate Hikes all have the view to leave a minimal footprint and protecting the pristine environment. The track is barely a track - just enough to guide you safely. The lodges are nestled in the bush land and feel just right. Comfortable and practical but not ostentatious. These lodges serve the purpose of allowing people to stop and refresh...they are not there for bling and are respectful of the environment. There’s a sense things have not changed that much since McKinnon forged a way over the pass. Yes there’s bridges and trails (and helicopter for supplies) but it’s all very thoughtful and kept to a minimum. You feel very much surrounded by the sights, sounds and smell of nature.3. Most surprisingly, the Milford Track brings people from around the world together. Lunch and Dinner each night were delightful as we met like minded people from all around the world who just love nature. These nightly interactions were rewarding in that we shared our experiences with others who in turn shared theirs. The discussions made the experience richer and more vividly through reflection of the days events. So if your up for it, you should go for it. Picture is the Clinton River at dusk just outside Glade Lodge."
94,"Beautiful, remote, wet","My wife and I have hiked all over the world and the Milford Track was definitely the best we have ever experienced.  We recently tramped with Ultimate Hikes and 36 other trampers. It rained the second and third mornings  and then the sun came out for glorious afternoons. What a great combination.  The rain produced the waterfalls cascading down the 4000 foot cliffs on both sides.  Then we had great views later in the day.   Allow me to make several points without repeating what others have said.We believe this hike is more rigorous than has been suggested by some reviewers.  We are veteran hikers in our mid 60s.  We trained hard for this hike (and the Routeburn which we did afterward).  But we found the 3.5 down hill stretch on the third day a challenge.  If you intend to do this tramp, training and good equipment are very important.Some reviewers have suggested that the guided hike is expensive.  I suppose that is a relative term.  But we believe that we received good value.  Ultimate Hikes provides quality guides, facilities, and food & drink in very isolated circumstances.  This is a well run outfit.The Routeburn is a beautiful tramp as well but for sheer beauty, the Milford is unequaled in our opinion."
95,Ultimate Hikes Milford Track Hike,"Did this walk as an independent walker in a group. Book early to get your dates. Track well maintained. Huts are clean and comfortable. Cooking facilities also clean and in good working order. Lots of side tracks to do with Sutherland falls a must and the longest. Sandfly yes but the views are amazing. Snowing in December as well as sunny, but can also be wet. Last day aim to get 2pm boat with easy walk from 8am. A great walk anywhere in the world!"
96,First-time tramper,"We have just returned from walking the Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes. There is nothing bad we can say about this. First the walk:  To say it is amazing is an understatement!  You hear about it being one of the world's finest walks, but it is so much more. We were lucky to have had good weather for this - so if you are planning on going then plan to go in February!  The MacKinnon Pass was challenging but everyone in the group made it including those who were over 70!  The scenery is constantly changing making the walk varied and never dull.  Ultimate Hikes were brilliant! So organised and well run.  From the briefing on the first day to the presentation of the certificates at Mitre Peak Lodge on the last evening, it was a well oiled machine. The guides were great, the food delicious!  You burnt so many calories per day then put them all back on again with dinner.  You can borrow backpacks with a waterproof liner inside.  I would recommend you do this rather than buy one unless you are planning to do more of these walks.  Hire the walking poles on offer.  I found 1 easier to use than 2 but had both anyway.  You can hire these from Ultimate for $25. Keep to their recommended list of things to take. I did, and wore nearly everything I took at some time.  The lodges were comfortable and a hot shower very welcome after a day walking. The ensuited ones include all shampoo, conditioner, hairdryer which saves you having to pack it.  Had 50 on the trip and got to know nearly everyone.  You do need to be quite fit, and do adhere to their recommendations of training up hills or stairs - will make crossing the Mackinnon a lot easier if you do. We will return to do the Routeburn. Had a great time and thoroughly recommend."
97,The organisation was excellent!,"Did this independently, my first time on a multi-day hike! It was a magical experience. The hut rangers make you feel welcome and give you all the necessary information on weather, etc. The first night, we even got a crash course in plants. The scenery is fantastic, was extremely lucky to have good weather on Mackinnon Pass day with spectacular views. It's not too difficult even for someone who hasn't hiked multi-day before, though your feet are very worn out by the end. Overall one of my best memories!…"
98,Magical Milford!!!,"A most do experience. We did this route initially in 1965 as a protest. The Government of the day was going to give exclusive rights to the track to the Tourist Hotel Corporation, meaning anyone else wishing to access this piece of National Park would be trespassing. Now it is available to everyone, either with the concessionaire, Ultimate Hikes, or as a Freedom walker using DOC huts. This could be the best four days of your life, go for it!"
99,Absolutely spectacular walk (Ultimate Hikes),"I last walked this track 28years ago and it remained in my memory as the best walk ever. The sceney is beyond words and we had great weather with no rain. The lack of rain is unusual and the following week was very wet. This is the luck of the draw but the rain brings magnificant waterfalls and the sounds of water. Still we saw lots of waterfalls especially the Sutherland Falls which is a worthwhile side trip.This time last week I was walking the last day to Sandfly Point. It is a long 22km walk but easy going. The previous day was harder over the Mckinnon Pass but I was at the top very easily as the track is a series of zig zacs.Ultimate Hikes do a great job to make the walk enjoyable and the accommodation and food were impressive for a wilderness location.Many thanks also to our guides who were always encouraging especially Andrew who had a great sence of humour.Tips. I slept in a bunk room with 6 others. Not being used to this situation I had a bad night at Glade House on the first night. Lots of noise ,snooring etc. This was not a problem again as i was too tired to notice!Good boots are most important. I bought new ones which I walked in prior to the walk.At Mitre Lodge they have a glass case of boots that fell apart on the walk. Do not risk it!! There is no shop to buy new ones. They were held together with wire and band aids.Travel as light as you can with a good raincoat just in case. I didnt need it but it could have been a lifesaver. Wash shirts every night ,one for the track and one for the lodges.Backpacks. Best bring your own or even buy a good one. Ultimate Hikes can provide them but they are not good and lack adjustment. This can only make your walk harder.I tried to adjust the pack for an American lady with only limited success.  So in summary this is a great experience that ordinary people can accomplish walking in a real wilderness. Ultimate Hikes makes it easier but there is much you can do to prepare for the walk that will make your life easier."
100,Totally possible in good weather with well-prepared and experienced children.,What a great service. Easyhike made our car relocation so easy. We will use them again! They picked our car up in Te Anau Downs and it was waiting for us in Milford Sound. Easy pick up on the weekend with a lockbox.
101,The Key is to be Well Prepared,"Fantastic scenery and a beautiful track went there in 1975 and 1981, year is not on the list I can choose."
102,one of the best experience in NZ,"Coming from Australia our first walks in New Zealand (Kepler in 2013, Milford and  Routeburn 2014) were strangely quiet. Spectacularly beautiful and very enjoyable but quiet. What a lovely treat in December 2015 when we walked the Milford Track again, this time to the friendly accompaniment of birdsong! Ross, the wonderfully knowledgable ranger at Clinton Hut, told us of the big push in predator trapping along the Clinton Valley and it certainly paid off. Well done DOC and your contractors. Apart from the birds and Ross the ranger, the highlight for me this time was the fine clear weather over McKinnon Pass. Instead of brief glimpses of hanging valleys and mountain peaks in drizzly fog we had beautiful expansive views of the Clinton and Arthur Valleys and a feeling of being dwarfed by the surrounding snow capped mountains. Well worth the effort of taking on the track a second time. There is something about the Milford Track which draws you back. Maybe the unpredictable weather which is always the elephant in the room for any fine tuned planning. At the end of the day you just prepare for anything and be ready to just slog it out if you have to. Cold snap or torrential rain it all just adds to the adventure although it is reassuring to have the hut Rangers to advise on conditions for the day."
103,Milford Track w Ultimate Hikes - awesome,"We did this walk independently at the end of February, it goes without saying that the weather in this beautiful part of the world will play a part in your walk. Rain on an average of 250 days per year means you are likely to encounter some. I now believe if you don't you are unlucky. We had 1 wet day and what a difference it made the valley came alive. A hundred waterfalls that had not been there the day before and the rivers roared. Sure with rain comes limited visibility so it's s trade off. The DOC huts were fine although for the jewel in the great walks crown I think we can do better. Waterfalls, rivers, bridges and shear sided mountain ranges all add to the theatre as do the cheeky Weka and other native birds. No showers in the DOC huts (cold water rivers on hand), it is common to walk in the same gear on consecutive days so the tip is pack light wear layers and reuse yesterday's thermal. The more you pack the more you carry. Check weather temperature as it can be bitterly cold at the pass. If walking is not really your thing then the drive from Te Anau to Milford offers a number of attractions that will tick many boxes including the Chasm, Mirror Lakes, the Homer Tunnel and mountains on either side of it."
104,A very challenging 4 days.  ,"An iconic world walk and it simply lives up to its reputation.  You can do it as a guided or independent walk - I did the guided walk and loved it.  Pays to build a bit of fitness as there are some hard sections, especially across some rocky areas and the walk up to the beautiful Pass, but overall most people can do it just fine. Like Queenstown and its other surrounding areas, the Track is simply stunningly beautiful.  You never get sick of gazing on the mountains, creeks/rivers, and waterfalls.  The company New Zealand Hikes and their guides on the track do a great job, plus great accommodation (and showers) and food!  Only one more thing to say - just do it!"
105,Milford Track (Independent Walkers),"We walked the Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes and this was the most amazing experience.  We were very lucky and had fantastic weather but can imagine that it would be an amazing experience in any weather.  Ultimate hikes were great guides, the food was excellent, the guides were friendly, informative and helpful, the ensuite rooms were clean and comfortable and the lodges were warm with very good drying rooms.  The walk itself is indescribably beautiful, could not recommend more highly. Tip for people considering - make sure you have done some training, in particular going downhill."
106,5 day guided walk with Ultimate Hikes,"This is my second great walk in NZ. We were lucky with the weather and had sunshine day 3  to cross the pass. It rained all the last day but it didn't matter, it just added to the adventure. The track is very well maintained and easy to follow, the huts are very comfortable but dark so definitely bring a torch. We met great hikers and the Rangers were very helpful. Good to see more birds about. Long tiring days and very sore feet but would do it again anytime. Thanks DOC"
107,Lifetime Experience,"I walked the Track with a friend from England and had a fabulous experience. We took a guided walk with Ultimate Hikes.It was an experience that I will always remember. We had a great group of walkers, the guides were extremely pleasant and knowledgeable, the weather was superb ( it never rained during daylight hours for 5 days)and the views from the track of the mountains and the rivers and streams was outstanding. We had 3 course meals with wine and beer what a life.My friend and I roared with laughter through the whole walk and bus trip back to Queenstown. It was a very special experience."
108,"A great adventure, but be prepared to get wet","We did the Milford with Ultiimate Hikes 17-23 December 2012 and it was incredible! Superb scenery of course, and we were lucky with the weather. For us, Ultimate Hikes was definitely worth the extra - the guides were knowledgeable, supportive, caring and enthusiastic, and at the end of each day we had a hot shower and a superb dinner, facilities for hand laundry and great drying rooms, and comfy beds  (we also took the private room option which guaranteed a peaceful night's sleep). We were lucky enough to do a special trip with Ruud (""the Bug Man"") Kleinpaste as well as our fantastic four guides (for a party of 45) Shaun, Phoebe, Constance and Marco, who did extras like carry thermos of hot drinks to the top of the Pass, and even treated any blisters or other problems during the evening ""foot love"" session, ready for the next day's exertions. Check out the Ultimate Hikes website - everything they say is spot on."
109,Milford Sound Track ,"We did the independent walk in January 2015. Huts were basic but all that we needed. Take ear plugs or be prepared to move, like I did,  my mattress outside one night and into the dining room another. Wash facilities are not enough: one private sink for 40 people is tough. The walk itself is totally divine. Short first day is a nice intro. Long second day with a bit of a climb at the end to get the heart pumping, goes through a few different landscapes, all utterly beautiful. Long third day with a climb up and a long descent 1100m down over creeks, under waterfalls, over rocky terrain, steep steps and paths is quite hard but exhilarating. Make sure to do the side trip to Sutherland Falls - it's worth it. The final day, all flat, is heaven. Every view is picture perfect. Pure, pristine water and landscape .....heaven."
110,Incredible experience,"This is truly one of the finest hikes in the world! The track is a spectacular experience with three solid days of hiking through rain forest and alpine passes. Wether you spend the night in the DOC huts or with Ultimate Hikes lodges the track is the same. The real trade off in how to do it comes down to advance planning, comfort, and expense. The DOC huts may require earlier reservations, but if you are comfortable backpacking it is economical. Ultimate Hikes is expensive, but if you can afford it you won't regret it. They have great guides, feed you good food, have showers and drying rooms."
111,Best experience ever,"We have just completed a wonderful four days of a guided walk on the Milford track. it is such a please to arrive at a luxury hut to be  greeted with hot scones and coffee followed by a hot shower, glass of wine and a private room for the night. We got the weather right also two of four days without rain and guides who were awesome. So good to see some kiwis as guides and also some of the trampers enjoying our beautiful country."
112,Guided Milford Trek,"I did the 5 day guided walk (actually 3 days of walking) with my 13 and 10 year olds. It was fantastic. The guides were great and made it easy and enjoyable. The track is tough enough to get you hungry each night but not overly hard to put you off. The scenery was amazing. Particularly when it rained the waterfalls were incredible.Tip is to avoid anything cotton or wool and take non natural materials. Lycra leggings, shorts (even when it is cold are OK), and have good boots that you have worn in. My kids wore runners and these were destroyed by the finish."
113,independent walking of milford,"I live in an urban area and not doing exercise routinely and afraid of height.  When my husband said we are going to walk Milford track, the first thing come to my mind is ""am I able to finish the track?"".  Luckily, I got 5 fine days so everything became much easier.  Which means I don't need to walk in the water so I have time and energy to enjoy all the beauty around me.  Although I know I missed the real shows when it rains......The hardest part is the 3rd day.  Not the10 Zs uphill, everyone in my group can finish 10 Zs quickly.  The real challenge is the downhill.  We had to walk the emergency track while going down since the regular track was closed due to the rain damage a week ago.  The emergency track is so steep and the road is so narrow.  But, it made me feel I was walking in the real mountain, not a track. We need to climb over a hugh tree and rocks.  My husband said there are more than 30 trees block in the middle of the track for the entire track, he counts.I must mention this.  When I walking on the valley, I saw the snow slide on the top of the mountain in front of me.  It's amazing,  so, when u guys walk, take time to look up, not only front, you will always find something ......"
114,A track of two halves,"7 of us hiked the Milford Track. The Govt huts are clean and comfortable and have cookers with gas! We had glorious weather, enjoyed the beautiful scenery and the entertaining rangers at each hut. Great 4 day hike."
115,"Amazing, incredible, etc.","What a experience we had. We loved this hike that spaned 4days. We were treated like Kings and Queens on this once in a lifetime journey. When we went was right after 911 for us in Feb. we had private rooms with all the amenities. The food was fantastic and all our guides were wonderful. The biggest event for me was when we made it to the top! What great pics we have. The journey did not end there we stayed at the lodge, and woke up to rain and I mean hundreds of waterfalls pouring down the cliffs. Breathtaking ."
116,This is what many come to Fiordland National Park to see,"This has been probably the best trek I´ve ever done.It is fiscally challenging, but technically easy, you have probably have seen tons of pictures and I don't really have to tell you how amazing this place is, but I can share a couple tips and also say that sharing this experience also with another 40 people in huts it really something you shouldn't miss, you get to know different nationalities and folks that love adventure and hiking.Some tips:-Don't go if you hate to get wet, it rains more than 200 days here, if it didn't rain  you wouldn't see so many waterfalls and green.-Dot carry too much weight, specially water. I always do, and I can tell you that its not that necessary in this trek there is water everywhere and using some tablets for water treatment you can get water almost along the four days.-Relax and enjoy the trek, there is plenty of time specially if you wake up early.-Carry with you good rain gear, over boots are handy as well as packing everything in rainproof bags.-Don't forget your camera, I just cant help it and I always carry with me my heavy Mark II but for me its worth it.-Some people like to use what they call ""wet gear"" daily and basically wear their wet stuff everyday and use the dry for the night. I´m from Spain and I like to stay dry daily(its cultural what can I say) , this obviously leads to a heavy backpack..-Food: Don't take too much weight with you , Ive seen people taking bottles of wine and cristal jars with them, for me is not the best practice. We took dehydrated food. A good tip is to bring some fresh foo for the first two days and the use the dehydrated for the rest. Remember you have to take all your garbage with you.-You don't have to be an expert mountaineer but be aware that this is phisically challenging and its not a hike in the park, you will have to walk for four days and with all your gear in the back. The third day is the steepest but nothing technical.Ive seem some comments about this being expensive, I don't see it as such taking into account all the transport and huts.Also and to be fair I have to say that we had amazing weather as we only got wet two out of four days. I believe the 2nd and the 3rd day are the worst ones to have bad weather, the 2nd because you have places that can get flooded and that were you get really wet, sometimes up to the waist. And the third because of the great views in Mackinnon Pass.Just to end up, I will share that I twisted my ankle in the third day going down which is probably the worst place to get injured and even so it was the best trek I´ve ever done and one of the most amazing experiences in my life. Everyone that I meet was willing to take with from me and helping me out, that was really touching. Good thing my wife is a physiotherapist :)This leads me to the last tip: Don't use your poles in the stairs or bridges, they have holes in them and sticking your pole in one of them can lead to a twisted ankle."
117,Simply sensational,We got to do Day 1 of this track and it was worth both the time and the money. Just great. Such beauty in the bush and on the walk from the boat ride to the valleys to the wild life and plants. Loved it.
118,Great adventure,"We did the Milford Track guided walk through Ultimate Hikes for our honeymoon. We had expected it to be great, but it was even better.There were 24 ""guests"" and three guides in our group. Only one NZ born and one Australian born - we had French, Japanese, Brazilian, German, English - very multicultural. Llike someone else said, we started as a group of 27 strangers and finished as 27 friends. We were looked after very well by Ultimate Hikes - we were loaned our backpacks and raincoats, given a briefing the day before - everything was outlined very well. We had a briefing each night in the lodges as to what the next day would be like.The track is absolutely amazing - every corner we came around was met with ""wow, or ""awesome"" - we had to find new adjectives to describe it. There was not one boring bit over the whole track. We loved the rain - because with the rain comes the waterfalls tumbling down the mountains and then the creeks and streams start to flow. We were lucky to have sunshine the day we went over the pass as the views were....awesome.The lodges were great. At the end of the days walking we had a hot shower, put on our dry clothes and washed our hiking clothes and put them in the drying room. Then we would go and socialise in the lounge with the other walkers. A never ending supply of food - we didn't go hungry! We were greeted at the end of each day with afternoon tea, followed by pre dinner nibblies, followed by a three course dinner. Tea and coffee is always available. Travel light - one outfit for walking in, one for the lodge. Flip flops or light shoes for the lodge.I'm 49, carry no excess body weight and don't consider myself overly fit, but I can confess now that I did very little (or no) training for the trip and thankfully didn't find it very difficult. It was downhill all the way from Mackinnon Pass to Quintin Lodge and my feet were screaming by the time we got there, but I still managed to do the 90 minute round trip to Sutherland Falls - it was well worth it - your feet can recover later. If you wear your pack correctly (the guides give you a lesson for this) you shouldn't really notice it too much. Do make sure that you have good hiking boots that are well broken in.If you have ever thought about walking the Milford Track we can highly recommend it. Ignore the rain and enjoy where you are and the absolutely stunning surroundings."
119,Amazing walk,"Milford track is on the bucket list of many people who enjoy hiking. I am one of those. And that’s why I decided to give myself a birthday present for hiking with two good friends at Milford Track by joining the ultimate hike.  Originally we planned for joining the ultimate hike instead of a cheaper way by booking the DOC huts ourselves is all because we do not want to carry too much for our hike. With Ultimate Hike, you can only bring one set of Clothings and some personal skincare items with you. As they will provide all transportation, food and drinks, dry room for you to dry your Clothings, clean towel, shampoo and body wash are in the bathroom, nice bedroom with blanket, heater and pillow. So, your backpack can be light as 5-7kg instead of bringing stove, sleeping bag, all food and drinks for 4 days walk...etc.  However, we met the unexpected heavy rain with storm and trapped in the lodge for over 50 hours.   With this crisis, the differences between booking DOC huts and Ultimate Hike are far bigger.   With Ultimate hike, food and drinks are supplied during our stay. The crew kept communicate with the HQ at Queenstown to get the most updated information, they are so transparent and organised to motivate the group. There are many kinds of board games, books and videos for you to kill time. Even after we are rescued by the team from Te Anau, the Ultimate Hike arranged accommodation to all 100+ participants, as well as tourist activities to them before finding the way to go back to Queenstown.    Up to now, you may already know the reasons for me to recommend Ultimate Hike for the guided walk on Milford Track to you:   1. They treat your safety as the top priority and they walk the talk.   2. They provide excellent customer experience even under a big crisis and under the acts of God.  3. They make your hike far much easier and organised   Although I cannot finish the hike and cross out the bucket list item this time, I will definitely come back and join Ultimate Hike again.   Highly recommend to you with my big applause to the great team. …"
120,"A ""must do""!","we are a couple - aged 60 and 61. just completed Milford as independent walkers - yes - carrying packs. Had 3 days on and off rain and last day blue skiesWant to recommend this way of walking - especially through using excellent equipment (packs and sleeping bags and car moving opportunity) presented by EASYHIKE, New Zealand. Their equipment was the best quality and lightweight so that carrying a pack was no impediment to completing the walk relatively easily"
121,The Finest Walk in the World,"Undoubtly, Milford track was the hightlight of the 4 weeks in NZ..THE place to discover a nature you will never have seen before..Each step goes along  with so many ' waouh !! 'Flora is a multi shades of green and brown...river from light blue to dark emerald...Fauna is rich too....lots of birds with fantastic calls...cicadas...and not so loved ' sandflies !!  The track is well marked..and not strenous except on the 3rd day when a 10kms slope down reminds you of your poor knees..but..but walking up the pass is such a reward for the eyes!.... The huts are well equipped and the rangers most helpful..  you come to make friends with everybody ...that 's really fun...Coming from france, we had the whole thing organized by Easyhike...we didn t have anything to do except answer the emails...everything was provide for...the complete equipment ( rucksack..waterproof clothes....sleeping bag...very generous meals...etc...etc...) , hut reservations , Milford Sound cruise, 1 night in a very comfortable  lodge, relocation of our car...The whole adventure was just top...my husband is 77.. I'm 10 years younger we rwally, really enjoyed it !!"
122,Magical place,"Milford Track is beautiful because it's full of waterfalls which get bigger (or more appear) as it rains, then disappear as quickly when the rain stops.  Fiordland will have rain somewhere in the national park 200 days in a year (7-9m p.a.), so be prepared to get wet. Booking through DOC, you'll get a bus to Te Anau downs at the head of the Lake Te Anau, then a boat trip to Glade Wharf to start the 4 day (53.5km) trip. Day 1 only takes 1 hour, so it's really a 3 day walk. Most people average 6-7 hours/day, but on the 3rd day, one couple took 10 hours, a family took 11 hours, and one older couple didn't finish, so be sure you've got a good enough fitness level to be carrying a pack. The mountains are high, steep and shaped by glaciers. Because DOC class it as a 'great walk', the track is well graded, has boardwalk and steps in some places which are the most fragile or dangerous to remain as track. The Sutherland Falls are are a 90min side trip on day 3, but well worth the extra effort to go see. The DOC huts are comfortable, have solar lighting, gas cookers (gas supplied), flushing toilets and hand basins. As far as tramping goes, it's glamping!"
123,Pretty spectacular!,"My husband and I hiked this beautiful track in December 2014. We had booked in July on the first day booking opened, booking all our transport at the same time. We caught the early boat from Te anau downs and because of high water levels in the lake we had to take off our boots and roll up our pants to wade along Glade wharf to get to the start of the track. We laughed at the time as it reminded us to be ready for anything. We started in misty rain but this soon cleared to a fine day for the short 5km tramp to the first hut. There was plenty of room and we claimed our bunks, made a cup of tea and relaxed. Day two we were awed by the beauty of the track and the sheer scale of the landscape. As you walk further up the valley the mountains gradually close in. The last 5km is a climb up to Mintaroa hut and includes a scramble over an old Avalanche site. The hut is tucked into the end of the valley with cliffs rising steeply on both sides. Mackinnon  pass is visible, tree clad on the lower levels with the last of the zig zags visible above the tree line. It looks a long way up but beautiful. Some of the younger hikers climbed straight up and back on day 2 in case the weather was bad the next day. They captured some fantastic photos and as luck would have it the next day was misty and drizzly so their effort was worth it. We set out early for the big third day and made steady progress up to the pass where the clouds parted briefly to reveal much higher peaks all around and views of the valley way below. Beyond the monument to mackinnon it is another 30 minute climb to the shelter hut where you can snack before the 1100m descent. We had to take the emergency track which was very steep and rocky. Walking poles were a necessity for taking pressure off knees and saving us from any twisted ankles, etc. the way down takes you down into the lush forest past roaring waterfalls complete with viewing decks along the track. Flat going along the river for the last few kms. We were ready for a swim by the time we reached dumpling hut and went straight in to the swimming hole. Very refreshing!Next day was an 18km hike out in the rain. Waterfalls and cool easy walking. We made good time and caught the 2pm boat from the aptly named sandfly point and jumped straight on to the 2:30 bus back to Te anau. In the spa bath at our lovely motel by 5pm. Very nice. As others have noted you need to book early for this great walk. Bookings for the 2015-2016 season opened in February - 4 months earlier than last year. We have already booked our December spot to do it all again. With weather such a big factor on this walk we felt it will be a different experience every time. Just one tip on pack weight: take all the necessary gear but keep it light as possible. We are in our 50s, moderately fit and had packs weighing 9kg and 12kg respectively. By day 3 and the mountains you notice every extra gram."
124,Amazing Adventure,"After doing Routeburn Track (3D2N) in Dec 2007, decided to do the renowned Milford Track (4D3N) last month.  I was blessed with good weather, and enjoyed remarkable and inspiring scenic views everyday except the last day where it drizzled the whole day long as me and my wife walked the last leg of the track out to sandfly point.There are many Great Walks in New Zealand, and Milford Track is known as the finest walk of them all.Nevertheless, the highlight is at the highest point, the Mackinnon Pass.  I arrived at the second hut before 3:00pm, and took the advice to leave my packs at the hut and go up to Mackinnon pass to have a look.  I didn't realise my blessing then, but the next day was so cloudy that nobody can see any views when we cross over the Mackinnon pass on the way to the third hut. We did the track as an independent walker, so we had to carry all our food and utensils ourselves.  The huts provided water and gas for cooking, and a bed and mattress to sleep in, and of course shelter from the wind and sandflies.  This is a really sought after track, so you will need to pay attention on when the online booking starts, and book the track (and huts) as soon as possible.Sadly, Sutherland Falls side track is closed due to rock fall.  Probably a while before they are comfortable that no more rocks are going to fall and they reopen it again .The track ends at Milford Sound, where you can complete your journey with a cruise of Milford Sound.  I have already taken the cruise in an earlier trip, so I skipped it this time round.  It was drizzling and very cloudy anyway, Personally, I liked the Routeburn track better though, which is mostly at a higher altitude, and two big lakes.  The Milford track follows the river, and you get to see more of the different vegetation, waterfalls and the river."
125,Abundant birdlife,"My family tramped the Milford Track as free (unguided) walkers, using the DOC (Dept of Conservation) huts. The first day is quite short, the 2nd and 4th days are a little on the long side. Using huts means that you don't have to carry sleeping pads, tents or stoves, substantially lightening the load. This was such a wonderful experience, particularly the climb from the DOC Mintaro Hut to Mackinnon Pass, and the short side trip to Sutherland Falls after descending down the other side.Because the number of trampers is limited to those that have reserved spots in the DOC huts or the Guided Walk lodges, the track is quite uncrowded. The downside is that you need to reserve spots many months in advance, and you do not have the option of deciding to tarry if the weather turns bad. And, the weather can indeed be quite bad, so it is a total crap shoot as to whether or not you will hike in the rain, sun, snow, etc. We were particularly lucky this time around; rain poured down on us as we took the boat launch to the trailhead, but cleared up soon after we disembarked. And, it didn't start raining again until we boarded the boat at the end of the track.While there is a substantial elevation gain to reach the Pass and then drop down the other side, the track grade is rarely very steep. As a result, our 6-year-old daughter managed to pull off this trip, although we were lucky with the weather, and she only carried a sleeping bag.Sleeping quarters in a couple of the huts are a little tight. The problem is that if you have inconsiderate bunkmates who stay up late or wake up early and make noise, you may not get a good night's sleep. Other than that, meeting our fellow trampers was part of the enjoyment of this trip."
126,A great experience but a wet one !,"There is good reason for this being labelled as one of the Great Walks. This track takes you through some of the most dramatic scenery that you will see anywhere in the world. The mountains, waterfalls, streams, bush, flora and fauna are all exceptional. This month, for the second time in my life, I was lucky enough to enjoy the experience of hiking this track with Ultimate Hikes (this is the guided version of walking this track) The accomodation in lodges was very good (so much more comfortable than the huts provided for the independent hikers) All our meals were provided and the lodges had excellent drying facilities which meant that we only needed small packs.I highly recommend this experience to any one who loves hiking and is fit and strong enough to walk 54kms in 3 days. A word of caution, though: this hike is not 'a doddle' The climb up to Mackinnon Pass is steep and stoney, with the descent being the most challenging part, and very slippery if it's raining. Take walking poles."
127,beautiful but may be extreme,"This was my third Milford Track hike with Ultimate Hikes. Additionally I have twice hiked the Grand Traverse with themNo point in repeating all the tributes from others. This is a fantastic walk, the lodges are first class, the food plentiful and of excellent quality. There were 48 of us which is rather a lot but the staff handled the logistics very wellThe weather can and did vary but even heavy rain can be spectacular with the waterfalls and rushing streamsOnly negative was that the (unusually) all male guides (one of whom was older though not that experienced) were not quite up to the usual excellent standard (I know, it is sacrilegious to say so!). On previous walks we caught up with the independent and day walkers and were able to catch the first available ferry from Sand Fly Point to Milford Sound. Not this time, despite the ferry captain being happy to take us. So four of us had to wait two hours before the guides allowed us to go. Others in the group then had to wait another 30 minutes as this delayed them. No explanation given!!"
128,Beautiful (in any kind of weather),"This trek goes along the Clinton River, beautiful clear water along most of the track.  There are lots of green mossy trees, beautiful mountains, wetlands, waterfalls (Anderson Cascades was my favorite) birds, the amazing MacKinnon pass..., the bunk houses are cool and although at first I thought it a shame that it is so expensive and you can't just hike and camp out in tents...I ended up feeling they really take care of this special place. I felt very fortunate to visit and to get away from traffic and stress for a few days. What an amazing and gorgeous place! Bring a book or cards for the evenings."
129,Magnificant walk but be well prepared!,"the walk is really beautiful from the start to the end - you get wonderful views all the time, but the weather may be extreme. it rains often in the sound, and it gives you humongous waterfalls, but be prepared then to walk in the water up to your bum and watch the trout swim by right on the track! it's definitely an adventure!"
130,The Most Beautiful Walk in the World,"We hiked the Milford and Routeburn Tracks in late Jan/early Feb 2008 with Ultimate Hikes. Aside from somewhat tired feet and knees, we also had sore faces from smiling so much.We concur wholeheartedly with the suggestions/comments of ""An incredible experience"" - no need to take many clothes with you.The trails are fantastic and so are the guides and other staff (both in the office and at the lodges). The accomodations are plain, but far 'fancier' than what we expected. The food was excellent at every meal (note that scrambled eggs are cooked to European, not American tastes, however) and they accommodated special requests very well and very carefully.During the hike you are not distracted/annoyed by any car sounds and you can drink the water in the streams. The water is truly pellucid and the pale teal green color of old, thick glass - you can see the bottom of  the streambed from the opposite bank! The brown trout were the largest we've ever seen (but we're not anglers).Plant, bird, fish (and insect) life abounds (UltraGuard with DEET was the only repellent that kept the sandflies away from me and Xergic and Anthisan brought much-needed relief from the itching bites). We saw two types of lovely spiders, numerous butterflies, and *lots* of birds. Few experiences are as wonderful as hiking through gorgeous scenery while listening to bellbirds, tui, and gray warblers!  Some people in our group saw blue ducks and rock wrens, although we were not so fortunate. The wetlands (bogs to us in the US) were fascinating - the crimson sundew, though small, contrasted wonderfully with the green of the sphagnum and other mosses. Ribbonwood trees were just ending their blooming, so we often walked on stars of fallen flowers. The varieties of mosses, lichens, ferns, flowers, and trees were mind-boggling.We have the guides to thank for pointing out many features of the trails. Their knowledge, cheerfulness, friendliness, good humor, and helpfulness cannot be overstated.I'm focusing on the hike itself here, but we thoroughly enjoyed the part-day excursion on Milford Sound.The only drawback? The trip had to end!"
131,Nice Track,"I do not have to comment on the sights, as everyone will say it's spectacular. I agree. I walked with Ultimate Hikes, which took care of the meals and accommodation, that made it a luxury walk. Of course you pay more than an independent walker, you get the comfort of carrying less than 10kg of load. The lodges are excellent and the dinner is delicious. You can accompany your 3-course meal with NZ wine at your own cost. You get hot shower, clothes, shoes washing and drying facilities. The weather is unpredictable. But it was not a bad thing that it rained as I could experience Milford Track in another way. It rained when my wife and I walked up to Mackinnon Pass, it was all cold and misty but a guide was there waiting for us with a hot drink. Also because of the rain, there were plenty of water falls along the way. We can even walked under small water falls on the way to Sandfly point. One experience that I will always tell is walking through a knee-deep water hole filled with eels."
132,Walking the Milford Track gluten free,"The most amazing walk in the most stunning location, it was simply the best holiday ever! The huts and facilities are fantastic and the rangers were knowledgeable and friendly.  It's a bucket list item and I can't wait to do my next great walk in New Zealand."
133,Independent Walking,A fantastic walk but book early as it sells out fast.  Remember that this is in the wettest region of the world so expect to get soaked - take suitable foot wear (not trainers) and warm clothes (not jeans) and of course waterproofs.  Why do Americans walk in trainers?  This is serious ankle twisting country but our hiking boots received some attention from our New World cousins as if they'd never seen boots before.  If you twist your ankle you will have a serious problem as the only way out is via helicopter.  This is NOT a walk in the park.Take insect repelent - the sand flies are in a league of their own and their bites itch for days.The views from the pass are awesome so if you have time after day two and its clear then get up there as it may well be raining the day after.
134,Incredible Milford Track experience,"Ultimate Hikes is First Class all the way.  EVERYTHING was planned out perfectly.  They didn't make one mistake the entire 5 days.  The only thing that didn't work out was the weather and they had no control over that.  The guides were excellent in every way, right down to providing hot chocolate and coffee on McKinnon Pass on a cold and rainy day.  I stayed in 6-bunk room each night, but my rooms only had 4 sleepers once.  The rooms were adequate and very clean.  The lodges themselves, were very comfortable and had all the comforts of home including a drying room for everyone's wet clothes and boots.  The food was well above my expectations, with a great dinner and hot breakfast each day and a full layout of items for packing your daily lunch.  There was absolutely no want for good quality food on the trip.  As for the hike itself, I would have liked clearer weather.  Unfortunately, when you go on a backpacking trip you get the weather you get and have to make the most of it.  Even with the bad weather, Ultimate Hikes made it a very enjoyable experience anyway.  There were many times that I felt sorry for the independent hikers I saw on the trail because the were carrying their own food and sleeping in basic huts with no way to dry their clothes.  I've been in that situation many times through the years.  The quality of the experience I had for the money I paid was well worth the cost.  Tips:  Use their pack.  My personal day pack wasn't as comfortable as the one they provided.  Take your own sleeping liner.  The one they provided was a bit heavy and bulky.  A basic rain jacket won't be good enough if it rains a lot.  Use the rain jacket they provide, but take some rain pants with you to keep you hiking shorts dry.  And finally, be fit and go with a positive attitude."
135,Scenery 'out-of-this-world' beautiful!!,"After 11 months from booking to completion I can say that the Milford track is worth waiting for. The 2 of us did the individual track and it is fair to say it was one of the better things we have done together (other then raising a family). The DOC is amazing. Well organised from booking online, maintaining the track, transportation and on top of all, the huts. The first day was quite easy but days 2-4 were challenging, especially the McKinnon pass that we had to do with pouring rain and sever weather. The views are the best nature can offer. We had so many water falls it was unreal. In terms of preparation, key word is equipment, less to carry and layers clothing. It is not easy and you should prep for it in advance but it will worth it. Another tip is to stay the night before and the night after in Te Anau. We took the bus back to Queenstown and I felt it would have been better to spare the 4 hours trip to the day after. One way or the other if you can, do it."
136,"Brilliant, wimply brilliant","I completed the 5 day Milford Track walk with ""Ultimate Hikes"" in Feb, with a group of 10 women.  Although we were at first shocked at the fact that the group was quite large (we are used to walking alone), by the end of the first day we realised that it really wasn't a problem and actually quite nice meeting fellow walkers from all over the world!  The scenery was probably the most spectacular I have ever seen - difficult to describe and has to be seen to be believed.  It just feels so ancient and untouched.  I felt like I was in a fairy tale many times.  The walk, was generally moderate - some challenging parts, but generally pleasant.  Accomodation provided along the way was quite luxurious compared to other walks I have participated in - eg: hot showers each day without having to pump the water oneself!  Food was plentiful and excellent.  Ultimate Hikes did a great job and I would highly recommend to anyone who fancies a hiking adventure in the wilderness.  I also recommend the helicopter trip on the last day instead of the bus - it is expensive, but worth every penny!"
137,Amazing,"We did this 15 years ago (this time we did Doubtful Sound). However, Fjordland in the rain is also very special. On the way to Milford is Cascade Creek walk at that time it was like a fairytale landscape. This time in the sun also nice but not as spectacular."
138,perfect in good weather,"I walked the Milford Track alone, starting on the second day of the winter season (2 May). The advantages of winter season are that you don't book your trip so you have flexibility to walk when the weather and conditions are right, it is cheaper (hut fees $15/night not $54), less crowded (although the huts were over full for those walking on the first day of the winter season, and only 7 walkers the second day), you can walk in either direction and stay in a hut multiple nights if you wish. Disadvantages are it is colder and the days are shorter, the plumbing is disconnected and drained to avoid freezing damage; long drop toilets are then used instead of the flushing variety, you need to bring your own stove and fuel (one guy had neither and happily used others', another pair just eat cold precooked food for 4 days and declined offers of stove use!), arranging transport could work out more expensive if there aren't others walking the day you are, snow/ice is possible especially on MacKinnon Pass and could make difficult/dangerous going (you can get snow even in the middle of summer), if there is heavy snow high up there could be avalanches across the track and DoC will remove some of the side stream bridges so they don't get destroyed (yeah, it's a bad look if you get in the way of an avalanche!), As an alternative to the cruise up Lake Te Anau to the track start, I tramped across Dore Pass. This was a gorgeous diversion, I had a stunningly beautiful day with great views everywhere. For me, Dore Pass was the highlight of my Milford Track tramp. A word of caution, do not attempt Dore Pass unless you are reasonably fit and experienced, it is substantially clear of snow and ice, you have a good head for heights, you have good route-finding skills as it is not well-marked in a couple of crucial spots up high (I told DoC Te Anau but whether they do anything about it is another story), you are prepared for the possibility of a night in the open, and the weather is fine. 2 young Germans followed a few hours behind me and camped in Murcott Burn. I met them later in Te Anau; they knew about me but of course I didn't know about them! They had good map-reading skills and had no difficulty with the route finding, and acknowledged the need for them. There were a few steep icy bits in the shady gullies on the Clinton side where care was needed. I stayed at Knob's Flat campground the night before, 1 mile south of where you ford the Eglinton, to ensure an early start. PC, the camp manager, was very knowledgeable about the area and Dore Pass in particular. Oh yeah, it was very frosty and fording the Eglinton was b....y cold! There were a few windfalls in the bush sections to keep you from complacency.The Clinton was lovely, full of trout (I counted 19 and 2 tuna, ha ha that's Maori for eel, not the seagoing variety you find in cans!), and stunningly clear and beautiful. 2 fishermen I met staying at Clinton Hut were having a great time. One was a professional guide, having a holiday on his own, and generously taught the other fisherman who was a beginner a lot of stuff, free of charge.MacKinnon Pass was buffeted by a powerful wind rising from the Arthur Valley, and was also fogged in as a result. This diminished the views, but they reappeared when I descended clear of the cloud on the other side.The Arthur was not quite in the same class as the Clinton, but was still good. I had arranged a pickup from Sandfly Point to Milford Sound, and transport back to my car, before starting, and the other 6 also had done this. We all went on the 2pm boat.I had avoided the Milford Track for 50 years, but finally made it and was not disappointed.The DoC website (www.doc.govt.nz) has very good information about the track; read it carefully."
139,Milford track,"An awesome 4 day walk through some fantastic South Island scenery.  It is hard work, we are reasonably fit but don't do a lot of walking so you will feel it, certainly on the uphill sections on day 2 and 3 and on the down bits on day 3.  But it is definitely do able and you see some awesome sights on the way.  Wide rivers, creeks, waterfalls, mountain passes, forest, suspension bridges - its got everything.  You also see loads of birds hopping around - so tame they follow you and come sit on your rucksack when you stop for a breather.We had fantastic weather but appreciate that this was unusual and actually if it had rained a bit more the rivers and waterfalls would have been even more impressive.  We did the unguided walk staying in the DOC huts.  They are fine for a few days - you won't shower, or sleep due to the snoring of your bunkmates but you will get to meet some interesting people along the way.Things we would take if we did it again - walking poles, they really would help on the downward bits and head torches- so much easier to have your hands free.On the last day we had booked the last boat out from Sandfly Point (the one at 4pm) but we got up early and made the 2pm one and they are fine to let you on.Final tips:If there are hut talks or nature walks offered by the rangers in the huts then go to them, they are full of info - Ranger Ross's at Clinton Hut was very interesting.Do the side walk to Sutherland Falls on day 3, you'll be knackered but they are well worth it.Boat ride from Te Anau Downs is great....Captain Jim as well as steering gave us some great facts along the way.We parked our car at Te Anau Downs, whilst the car was safe when we got back after the 4 days the battery was dead so we then had the hassle of trying to find a phone signal and calling the recovery man.  Which wasn't really what we needed - maybe get the bus from Te Anau there and back so at least you can be having a hot shower whilst you're waiting for your car to be fixed!There are loads and loads of sandflies - whilst you are walking they don't bother you but when you stop they'll be there.  Come prepared."
140,"""The finest walk in the world""",I was very lucky to get on this walk. It books out months in advance. I happened to book it 2 days in advance due to a cancellation and extremely fortunate timing.The walk itself is reasonably straight forward and anybody who is not horribly unfit will be fine weather permitting. I was a bit unlucky as day 2 and 3's were quite rainy and cloudy but still the views are amazing. The highlight for me is the non-stop waterfalls. The highlight is Sutherland falls which at 580 metres is the 5th biggest waterfalls in the world. I didn't even know about it until I started the track.The huts have pretty nice facilities albeit you certainly pay for them. It's a well run and great hike.A very special part of the world
141,Worth Planning,"I completed the Milford Track as an independent hiker this past week (second week of March). I had an amazing time. The scenery was spectacular, wildlife plentiful, and appreciated the information provided by the Rangers stationed at each hut. Some notes for those considering this hike:- The weather was pleasant for hiking three out of four days, there was a bit of a chill in the air, but I alternated between a tech t-shirt and light sweater each of these days. The fourth day (which was also the day spent climbing Mackinnon Pass) had heavy showers early in the day. Be sure to bring adequate rain gear, a cover and liner for your pack and for any gear you don't want to get drenched. You may also want to make sure to have a spare pair of clothes as it may/will be difficult for anything to dry overnight.- Be sure to stick around in the evening for the Ranger talks. They go over the weather for the following day, hut procedures, and also provide a wealth of information on the history of the track. Also: if you are not sure about going out in the weather the next day, ask the Ranger what their protocol for delaying departures from the huts is, and be prepared to wait out weather or flooding.-The sandflies are no joke. The worst I had was at the first hut - Clinton Hut. Bring spray or clothing that will keep your skin protected.- While this is rated as an intermediate/easy hike, do be prepared for rocky terrain, steep climbs (especially on day three), and water crossings. - Pace yourself so you can make stops to take pictures, enjoy the scenery, make side trips (Sutherland Falls and the lakes in the Clinton Valley are a must), and stop at shelters to eat, rest, or use the facilities. As a strong hiker I was able to make it to the next hut with ample time to get settled and go back out and explore without my heavy pack.- Finally, you will be bunking with a number of other hikers, if you are a light sleeper or have a hard time going to sleep, I would recommend ear plugs or other devices to block out light/noise.I would highly recommend this Great Walk and given the chance would happily do it again."
142,Wow!,"The Milford Track definitely deserves the title of great walk. It was an awesome experience from start to finish with some truly amazing views along the way. It is pretty expensive, since unlike the other great walks there aren't any campsites and you need to travel by boat at both ends of the trail. It was well worth the cost in my opinion though. The trail and huts are very well maintained and you can get a clear sense of how important conserving these areas is. The hike is fairly strenuous so make sure to do your homework and know what you're getting into. There is lots of info available on the DOC website. Also it's important to book in advance. We bought our hut tickets the day they went on sale back in May and a lot of dates were sold out already."
143,"Great hikes, views",The Milford track is an amazing four day hike. We were lucky enough to experience amazing views from the top of MacKinnon Pass.  You need to be prepared for rain and cold weather.  However if your prepared and have a good level of fitness you should have a amazing walk.
144,A must walk anywhere in the world,"The independent option was fully booked so I booked the trip with Ultimate Hikes.  Whilst the trip isnt cheap it is value for money.  The guides do a great job in getting everyone to interact and get even more out of the experience.  The hiking was awesome with some of the most scenic views I have ever seen.  The route is perfectly designed and maintained so its the right amount of walking each day.  At the end of the day you have a wonderful 3 course meal to look forward to, reasonably priced wines and drying rooms which dry all that wet kit overnight.Fjordland is one of the few places in the world where its safe to drink the riverwater - and its crystal clear and colder than a fridge.All in all I would recommend this trip as a must do in NZ"
145,Spectacular,Amazing experience. Ultimate hikers guided us through the track.At times it was difficult across the McKinnon Pass but worth it.
146,Book early May for any date,We took 9 young people from Scouts on the 4 day walk and stayed in the DoC Huts.  It was an experience of a life-time for the scouts and they all had an amazing journey. The weather for the first three days was perfect. Thanks to all the friendly rangers at the DoC huts for making our tramp such an awesome experience.
147,The most overrated track,"Had the opportunity for a wonderful guided day hike with as part of an  11 day hiking  trip  with New Zealand Trails (coupled with hikes on the Routeborn and Hollyford as part of a great small group  trip). Unique experience and we would agree with the other posters. Scenic boat ride across Milford Sound to the appropriately named sand-fly point. Shaded hike on a well maintained trail that follows the river, passes by a lake and ends at a spectacular falls. Even saw the local Wika bird on the way plus, fantails and a glimpse of the rare forest parrot. Our guide Andrew made the whole trip come together as a relaxed, enjoyable experience."
148,The most amazing walk,"My friend and I who are reasonable experienced trampers, took his wife and my two daughters on the Milford December 2013. None of the ladies had overnight tramped before. I have done alot of the walks in NZ, and the Milford was the most scenic. The distances are reasonable but challenging for ""newbies"", and the scenery on days 2 and 3 is terrific. The DOC huts are fine, but the sandflies are everywhere during daylight - best to where leggings and long sleeves to minimise the contact - at least their bite is not as bad as mozzies. The rangers in the huts are a mixed bag - it would have been nice to have had interesting talks each evening. In fact you get a boring dissertation on ""dangers"", and in one hut the ranger was blunt to the point of cringeworthy with some of the foreign walkers who breached her ""fire safety protocols"" - I guess man management is not in the DOC training manual. You will meet lots of interesting people in the huts while cooking and hanging out. Overall a great experience - my daughters(23 and 21) loved it and are keen for the next trip."
149,Trek ,"Walking the Milford Track was an incredible experience. The scenery was excellent, from beautiful forest to raging waterfalls. The walk on day three was the highlight when we crossed Mackinnon Pass. This is one of the wettest areas in New Zealand so we fully expected rain and poor visibility and whilst heavy rain makes for more spectacular waterfalls it can also ruin some of the views, particularly from Mackinnon Pass. Fortunately we had superb weather, very warm with blue skies on every day. The colour of the lakes really came to life and the waterfalls looked fabulous. The track is extremely well maintained and I found the 33.5 miles of the walk to be easy going although this of course will be dependent on your fitness and, perhaps, the weather. The big question for many thinking of doing the walk may well be whether to go for the guided or unguided option. I can only go on my experience doing the guided option but here are my thoughts on a few key areas:Cost: the guided option is very expensive even after you factor in buying the small amount of extra equipment you will need to buy to do the unguided option. Adventure: whichever option you take you will walk the same track, the same distance and see the same sites. The guided option doesn't take away any of that feeling of adventure and freedom because the guides themselves are as visible during the walk as you want them to be. If you want to set off early without them each day (which we did) you can...allternatively if you want to walk with them/learn about the track then you can do that also. They do not get in your way at all and appreciate that walkers often just want to get on with it. The unguided walkers still have very good huts that are suerbly maintained and have gas etc so neither guided or unguided walkers rough it to any considerable degree. Neither group are allowed to camp en route or travel further than their consecutive huts so both options remain fairly structured which does take some of the freedom and adventure away but it is necessary to protect the track. The unguided walkers may need to carry more weight with food and cooking equipment but I saw unguided walkers with small packs and guided walkers with packs that were at least 12kg. It all depends on the walker. However, if you find it more adventurous to not have showers ( and  i could easily have gone a few days without this), and to live off more basic food then perhaps the unguided is the way to go. Be aware that if your clothes get wet there are no drying rooms on the unguided option so it's not for everyone.Navigation: if you are choosing the guided option because you are concerned about navigation then think again! It would be very difficult to get lost on the track even with poor visibility. There is no need for map reading skills on this walk.Sense of isolation/freedom: You can get this whichever option you take. Often I was walking with no one in front or behind. So even though this is a busy route you can have plenty of moments of solitude. And, as I said above, the guides leave you to do your own thing.   Camaraderie: Again this is something you can have on either option although on the guided option you do spend more time together in the evenings as a discreet group which I think helps to create more of a group feel and I really liked the people we were with. The guides also added to this and I enjoyed the evening briefings.Food: If you want to eat well then it has to be the guided option. The evening meals were  superb, I mean really excellent. Big helpings and restaurant quality. I also appreciated the fact that the meals were not only tasty but healthy with good helpings of veg and without too much sauce etc. breakfast is also good and lunch is supplied which you make up each morning and carry with you along with your own drinks. 'You' time:one of the things you may appreciate is having a bit of you/partner time after the day's walk. The great thing about the guided option is having your own room. Sometimes you will complete the day's walk quite early and i did appreciate not having to go back to a communal area. It was great to have a shower, check the day's pics and have a read before joining the others. This is a purely personal thing but it did add to my enjoyment.Accommodation: the huts on the unguided option are very well looked after and some of the best I've seen on a walking route. The guided option accommodation is superb, in superior locations with stunning views and very comfortable rooms. If this is important to you then you won't be disappointed. I loved our rooms and was surprised by how good they were.  I was also  thankful that there were no Tvs or other such clutter. Evening entertainment: as I said above, depending on how fast you walk you can end up back at your hut quite early so on the guided route it is nice that you have a briefing and evening meal to look forward to as well as being able get some time to yourself in your room. But it isn't overly structured.So, basically, it doesn't matter which option you take you can have a superb experience. The star is the track itself. We booked quite late so the guided option was the best option as you don't have to book quite as early as you do for the unguided option. Our walk came at the end of a month long road trip, so itwas nice to have something where the  admin work was all done for us. Our experience with ultimate hikes was superb in every sense, and although it was expensive I don't regret it at all and walking the track was th highlight of our trip."
150,Guided walk with Ultimate Hikes,We did this with Ultimate Hikes. Simply stunning scenery. The accommodation is exceptional given how remote this is. 3 course meals and wine beer.  Great rooms with hot showers. Chance to meet lots of like minded people
151,Worth It,"I do not want to say that it is a nice track just because I have spent so much efforts and money to book it. The truth is, over 90% of the time I was hiking in forests, with trees blocking all the views that there was nothing to see. Even when there is no tree, you need to be quite lucky to see something as raining is a norm. The DOC huts are fine and clean, expect to meet a lot of sandflies.The worst of all, when we arrived in Milford Sound, the weather is not good (which is quite normal) thus there is almost nothing to see. This can be avoided if you are NOT doing the Milford Track because you can choose to go to Milford Sound only when the weather us good. My advice is do the Routeburn Track instead and then choose a good day to go to Milford Sound."
152,A Truly Wonderful Experience,"Great organisation, impressive guide, great lunch. We were very well looked after, and well informed. This is an EASY but very worthwhile venture.  We're a pair of ""seniors"", now tempted to tackle the whole 4 day track someday soon."
153,A truly amazing experience,"There has been so much already written about this magnificent walk that I won't recount the details of the walk - but instead offer a few tips:• Being in our 50's and moderately active, we managed the 'unguided' walk just fine. We weren't the oldest on the walk and no one struggled to finish. • Be prepared for ANY weather  and PLAN what you carry in some detail to avoid going hungry or carrying unnecessary weight for 4 days. Treat it as a typical backpack hiking trip and you'll be comfortable. Take too many shortcuts and you might regret it.• Unguided walks (where you carry your own food, clothing and sleeping bag) are 10% of the price of 'guided walks'. You have to sleep in a bunk and have to cook your own food, but you have so much independence it is well worth the effort of carrying your gear if you've had any backpack experience. (We were dismayed at the number of teenagers we saw on the 'guided' trip.)• Also, most overseas walkers do it unguided and this makes the night time conversations in the huts are fascinating, educational and fun. A real melting pot of ages, cultures and backgrounds.• The sandflies are a real pest in some lower areas, but by keeping covered and slowly moving, you shouldn't be bothered too much. If you stop for breaks during the day, do it near a water fall (plenty of them if it's been recently raining!) where the moving air off the falls keep them away. When at the DoC huts, be diligent about closing doors quickly behind you and you won't be swatting them all night.• Take some 'vitamin I' (ibuprofen) for Day 3! • Wet weather is very welcome for at least part of the walk as the atmosphere/views and resulting waterfalls are breathtaking. If you don't experience any rain - you miss out on half the adventure.• If able, plan to stay a night in Milford Sound at the end of the walk and do some sea kayaking in the morning. It's both awesome fun and spectacular and you can still make Te Anau that evening."
154,Winter season tramp,"Walked this track as an independent tramper. It was my first tramping experience so I wasn't sure what to expect, but did a lot of pre-reading on the DoC website and various blogs so fortunately I was well-prepared for a first-timer! I was pleased that the huts were well equipped, with bunks and mattresses, flushable toilets, and a mess with running water and gas stoves. I'm thankful I didn't have to take any shelter, stoves, etc, as the walk became more difficult for me on the third day.The rangers were a good source of knowledge each night and it was handy to be prepared for the next day in regards to the weather forecast. Ross was great, and I enjoyed his guided nature walk on the first night.In relation to the weather, be prepared to get wet or even have to stay at a hut an extra night. On Night 1 we were told that the weather was looking bad for the next day, and if it rained too much we may have to spend an extra night at the hut if it was too flooded for us (or the groups further up) to cross the rivers. We ended up having 124mm of rain on Day 2, and had to cross rivers that were knee - waist deep. Of course, we tried to dry our clothes and shoes in the hut that night by the fire, but most things were still damp the next morning. We were able to cross one of the flooded rivers by jumping over, however one of the ladies there was over 70 and travelling alone, and required assistance to cross through the river. We had concerns as she would not have been able to have crossed if we were not there.Two important items to take: earplugs (there were always 2 snorers in every bunk room at a minimum- they always got a good night's sleep but the same can't be said for everyone else); insect repellant (I used one with 40% Deet, but even this was not enough and I have been eaten alive by the sandflies, and can still feel the effects days later...).I could talk for hours about the amazing scenery you see on the track, but that's for you to experience yourself! It makes the entire track worth it, even the sore muscles, feet, and backs by the end of it. All I can say is if you are considering it, do it, and make sure you book early and have a decent level of fitness."
155,Guided on the Milford,"The first half of this track follows the river through woodland; it is easy walking and very beautiful. The second part involves a steep climb and descent into the Milford Sound. A day walk will show you the former,; the latter takes three days of hiking"
156,4 seasons in a 4 Days,"I highly recommend doing this trek. One of the best experiences I've ever had. The cabins were fantastic! Make sure you have water proof gear, as it rains a lot."
157,Once in a Lifetime Experience....do it!,"Four day hike.  Day one is easy but days two, three and four are much longer.  Everywhere you look is a picture.  It's beyond description."
158,Try to be 1 of the lucky ones,"We walked the Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes from January 15 - January 19, 2013. If you read the other reviews, there really isn't anything I can add except that Ultimate Hikes operates like a well-oiled machine. From the pre-trip information to getting outfitted the day before the hike to the fun, professional guides, to the clean lodges and the excellent meals, Ultimate Hikes does everything right and has the hiker's best interests always in the forefront."
159,Absolutely Stunning,"We went with Ultimate Hikes, their service was excellent. But on day 3 you ascend and descend Mackinnon Pass - up 700 meters then down 900 meters, not on some nice hiking path but over extremely rocky terrain, which may be slippery during the frequent rains.  The best hiker in our group described the descent as the ‘hardest hike he had ever done’. We learned from our guides that on at least a weekly basis someone has to be helicoptered out due to exhaustion and / or injury. If you have nice weather views can be awesome. There are better, easier and less expensive ways to get awesome mountain experiences, but if you want to do this walk, ensure that you not only are very fit but are comfortable hiking in very rough rocky terrain likely to be wet. Photo is a sample of the hiking ‘trail’"
160,Every Kiwi should do this hike!,"Quite possibly the greatest experience since moving to NZ two years ago, the Milford Track earns it's claim to be one of the best walks in the world. Ancient rainforest, towering snow-capped mountains and endless waterfalls, you won't be disappointed! The DOC huts are spacious, clean and well-equipped, with knowledgeable rangers present on a permanent basis. You simply must see this."
161,"So much green, you would not believe!","Milford track (the unguided version) is one of the most professional popular hiking trips you could hope for. I was really impressed with the professionalism that the DOC run this hike with. There is no camping on Milford, just huts. And they book out well in advance in the peak season, so book ahead. The huts are impressive. DOC supply gas stoves (so you don't actually need to take your own at all) and flushing toilets (!!! yes, you read that correctly!!) in peak season. This was positive luxury for us aussies used to carrying tents, stoves, a trowel and toilet paper! The hut rangers are all friendly and informative (and encourage snorers to sleep in the kitchen huts) and your fellow hikers often willing to share their much more appetising food. Next time I will be taking more crackers, tomatoes, cheese and salami for lunch, rather than freeze dried meals! Yes, it rains a lot on Milford (200 days a year, and averages over 10m  annually), but what is NZ without a bit of rain? Plus the mountains look prettier shrouded in cloud."
162,Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.,"As a repeat Freedom Walker I enjoyed the 33.5m walk both times. It is a fabulous walk in awesome scenery. The 2013 hut wardens - Ross at Clinton, Catie at Mintaro and Ian at Dumpling Hut - provided valuable evening talks about hut rules, flora and fauna, and what to expect next day on the track. TIPS:Know the names of the rivers and some mountains before you start the journey.If you want to do the walk as a Freedom Walker, book months ahead with DOC. If you want to walk it with the guided walk you don't need to book so far ahead with Ultimate Hikes.Use trail sticks if you have short legs which negotiate high steps with difficulty.Have a swim at Prairie Lake.On the last day it is supposed to take 6 hours to walk from Dumpling Hut to Sandfly Point to catch the boat. My family group took 8 hours, therefore leave the hut as early as possible to make the boat connection."
163,Scenery and bird song,"We were on the last hike (the unguided version) of the 2014 / 2015 season ... and we lucked in with the weather! The first and second days were stunners. The track is well maintained, and the scenery really does have to be seen to be believed. Even the best cameras cannot capture the feeling of being there, within the absolutely majestic mountains. The bird song and bird life in general is prolific, thanks to the stoat and rat trapping program that has been put into place.Day 3 on the climb to the MacKinnon pass was a bit wet in the morning, but the rain cleared up once we were at the top, and we had amazing views. The afternoon descent was fierce, but again the track is pretty well maintained! I'd recommend a good level of basic fitness for this walk overall, or else you'll end up with groaning quads and calves like I did!The last day saw amazing weather for us, sunshine and no wind. Perfect. The boat and bus transfer went like clockwork, and after a wonderful commentary by our friendly driver Chris, we were back at Te Anau Down in no time.Overall, the Milford Track is the most amazing experience, and I think every New Zealander should do it! The huts were great, the wardens (Ross, Tom and Jen) were full of great info and stories. The bird life was more prolific than the Routeburn and the Rakiura (Stewart Island).Top marks! Again, I'd stress that this walk will be much more enjoyable if you have a good level of fitness to begin with. And if you find that downhills are hard on your knees, make sure you have a good set of walking poles!"
164,Marvellous Milford - well done NZ DOC,"Absolutely incredible walk!!!  Did it with family  (kids 14 and 16) and loved every minute of it.  Am pretty fit and definitely wouldn't tell anyone it was ""EASY"".  We were independent walkers so carried gear.  Huts were fantastic!  Very well equipped with gas on tap, cookers and pot belly fire to keep warm.  Used Easy hike to relocate rental van from Te Anau Downs to Milford.  Info and the process was really good but remember to read/remember the pick up instructions for when you get to the Milford end.  Had a bit of a schamozle but not EasyHikes fault.  Their info was really good.  Would highly recommend using them."
165,Gorgeous Hike - enhanced by the convenience of EasyHike,"We walked the Milford Track over the new year period as a group of 6, including my 68 year old father, an 11 year old and 13 year old.  Four of the group had little tramping experience and we did it the independent way - no ""soft"" option required!  If you have some tramping experience, or someone in your party does then there is no need to worry about the guided option.  The Department of Conservation Huts are great and the hut rangers are a credit to the department.  Knowledgeable and entertaining, they provided a briefing each night, outlining the features of the area, what we could expect on the following day's walk and the weather outlook.The weather was as expected - 1 day of solid rain and 3 days of fine weather.  Expect at least one day of rain and enjoy the resultant water displays that come with it.  Besides your standard tramping gear don't forget your camera, tropical strength insect repellant and walking poles.  There are so many stunning views all along the way your camera will be out every few minutes.  The sandflies are ferocious.  Every time you stop you'll be found by the little flying insects on the hunt for fresh blood.  Finally, coming off Mackinnon Pass will make you very thankful you brought walking poles.Only 40 independent walkers are allowed to start the track each day and all must walk in the same direction.  This means that it is easy to feel like you have the track to yourself but it also means that you have to be prepared to book early.  Bookings for the 09/10 season opened in July 09 and the week over Christmas/New Year was fully booked within 24 hours of opening.On the days either side of the track we stayed in Te Anau, at the Red Tussock Motel.  A fabulous place to base ourselves and we were able to keep our cars there while we were on the track.  The motel is directly opposite the Department of Conservation Offices in Te Anau which is where the bus departs to take you to the boat at Te Anau Downs.  It was therefore just a walk across the road to the bus and we got dropped back at the motel on our return off the track.The biggest surprise for me was that of the 40 that started the track the day we did, we were the only New Zealanders.  What a fantastic experience for the tourists, who are getting to see one of the most beautiful parts of the country.  I'd highly recommend it to everyone and for Kiwi's especially - it should be on all of your bucket lists!"
166,Hard work but awesome ,"The Milford track has been on my father's bucket list for longer than i have been alive, so after getting a medical all clear after cancer, he decided that it was time to tick this off the list. So 2nd week of March 2012, myself, my 63 yo year old father and my 26 yo sister embarked on what is touted as the most beautiful walk in the world. To clarify 2 things up front, it is the most stunning part of the world I have seen...like out of a Peter Jackson film...but this is not what I would call a walk.  I don't regularly walk up the side of mountains and then down again in 1 day (dropping 1000 meters in a matter of hours), nor do I walk anything up to 16km in a day...Its no mountain climb, but its not a leisurely stroll through the countryside. So a few essentials to make this more pleasant than hard work....You need to be in good condition, I mean get out and spend a few days walking 10-12 km with a 10kg pack on your back. Walk up hills, and very importantly strengthen your shins, ankles, knees and hips (pilates on a reformer is a great activity to help with this.) The track is graded in some places, but when it's not, its going to be hell on your feet.There is plenty of great fresh water the whole way so don't overpack water bottles and each hut has a gas burner (plenty of them actually) so pack a pot/frypan and cook some decent food each night, there is enough gas available.We met some great people along the way, took the most beautiful pictures imaginable and got some great quality family time in. We were also lucky enough to get a full night and half day of rain....not so much fun trekking through thigh high water with the pack on the back, but worth it for the waterfalls that were full and spectacular.  Couldn't recommend a more beautiful 'walk' and whether or not it's your first 'tramp' or your 50th year of 'tramping', there is very little that can compare."
167,What a privilege!,"Like the title says, everyone should do it. This was our 2nd time in NZ and this was one of the few things we left behind, and now, for my 30th Birthday it was just a dream. we did it independently (but with other 30 people independent), and it's just great! it's 4 days walking through the most beautiful scenic landscapes you could imagine, i know we were lucky with the weather (5days-no rain..very very rare), but it was superb. The walk is hard, off course, but taking 15kg on your back, up and down, and be able to do all of that, and reach the end is just a sensation of accomplishment and very rewardable. We definitly recommend this to everyone even if you're in doubt. Just do it!"
168,Finest walk made even finer with Ultimate Hikes,Great guides. Excellent scenery. Not enough superlatives to describe this magnificent walk. And waaaaay too much delicious food
169,Amazing trek.  So well worth it.  Just be sure to bring earplugs!,Great walk with a great group of people.  Nice during the day and rain at night.  Cloudy as we walked up to the pass but the clouds parted and wow.  Pack your ear plugs for the snorers.  And extra food if you are staying at Milford sound.
170,Bookings for 2015/2016 season already open,"I just completed this 4-day hike. I chose a guided trip with Ultimate Hikes and I can't praise them highly enough. Our guides, Tom, Kelly and Moon, were knowledgeable, super helpful, and very entertaining. The clean and cozy huts had spectacular views, divine hot showers and drying rooms for wet gear. The food was wonderful with plenty of options. Dinners included salmon, blue cod, venison casserole and rack of lamb! I think Ultimate Hikes are well worth their price. I won't detail the itinerary since other reviewers have done that well. I can only echo everyone's opinion that the scenery is truly awe-inspiring. You are totally out of touch with civilization in a pristine world of incomparable beauty. However, for me, the hike was physically demanding. I am a 62 year old woman of reasonable fitness but had never been on a tramp. I'd expected to be going up and down mountain tracks but I hadn't expected that I'd frequently need to clamber over fairly large rocks. This was especially taxing coming down from the Pass. I suffer from vertigo and if I hadn't hired walking poles on Day 1 I would have been scared on Day 3. That being said many of our congenial party did find the hike easy. At the end, I felt like I'd run an ultramarathon - exhausted but with a great sense of accomplishment. It is definitely worth doing. The equipment list supplied by Ultimate Hikes was spot on for me. You only need to take what they say to be prepared for any weather - we had gales and snow on the Pass, and hot sun on the final day. Surprisingly, considering the other reviews, I had no problem with sand flies. Maybe 'Good-bye Sandfly' repellent really works!"
171,A Grand Tramp,"There is a reason this track is the most famous and popular in New Zealand. It is quite simply stunning the whole way. Myriads of waterfalls - including of course Sutherland Falls - 580m high and well worth the 1 1/2 hour detour, glacial valleys, crystal clear river water that is drinkable, pristine native bush, the song of bellbirds, the uplifting company of fantails, wekas crossing the trail, robins and wrens stopping us in our tracks and coming closer than 1 metre, native ducks, cheeky keas hanging around the huts. Standing on top of McKinnon Pass and looking in every direction at deep glacial valleys was an unforgettable experience. What was not so enjoyable were the voracious sandflies (I DEFINITELY recommend insect repellent or clothing that covers as much of your skin as possible), and the tiredness at the end of the 3 last days. We were relatively fit, but ended each day weary and sore-footed. If you have your own car I recommend using EasyHike who will relocate it from Te Anau to Milford for you (cost us $255) - for our group of 5 it was about the same price as taking the bus, but gave us full flexibility and maximum use of our valuable holiday time - no waiting around for group transport."
172,One of the unspoiled spots on Earth,"The Milford Track is just picture perfect ... the scenery is stunning and the vista's were breathtaking!!! My Mum (80 yrs) and I completed the hike in April ... Go Mum !!!. We began Day 1 bathed in sunshine, however, by Day 3 the weather turned to rain, wind and fog ... but we say, how lucky were we to receive the whole gamut of conditions and experience the Track in all its glory!!!The track is magnificently maintained and the facilities for us independent walkers were exceptional. We had flushing toilets and running water in communal facilities, mattresses on bunk beds and a mess hall compete with gas fuelled cookers.The DOC Wardens/Rangers stationed at each hut were a wealth of information and knowledge which was fabulous.The scenery was simply amazing and my photos do no justice to the serene, pure, unspoilt beauty of the Fiordland National Park... stunning waterfalls, swing bridges, hidden lakes!!!Day 3 it was raining, windy and it was fogged in as we climbed up through the MacKinnon Pass however what we did see was mind blowing. We sheltered in the hut at the top of the Pass, boiled up a hot cup of soup, utilised the toilet, known as ""the loo with the best view in the world"" .. and savoured our amazing journey up to the highest point on the track!!!This is not a hard walk by all means, however, a good level of fitness is required to make it an enjoyable venture. It is great meeting, talking with and interacting with all the different nationalities on the track. There is plenty of down time so a good book or a pack of cards is a recommendation ... and we took hot chocolate sachets and marshmallows as a little night time treat before turning in.Another amazing adventure ticked off the Bucket List!"
173,Book early!,"First of all, I'm 28 years old, quite fit and I had the chance to do many treks in the Himalayas and The Alpes in Europe. I enjoyed the walk on the overhaul, especially because we had the chance to book it 3 days before, two people must have cancelled I guess. Also we had a perfect weather, rain the second day, sun the other days.But, I must say I'm really disappointed, I was expecting something much better and really unique from ""the most beautiful track in the world"". It's not.The first day is way to short and useless and could have been coupled with the second one.So then 2 nights are more than enough for that very easy track.The price for one night is too expensive (140$), on option for tents should exists. The total including transportation that you have to book is more 600$.I'm pretty sure there are many other multi day hikes much more beautiful in New Zealand (I've done only 1 day hikes) which a much better value for money.Don't let yourself being fooled by the advertisement like I did, do not do that hike, find another one."
174,Incredibly Beautiful!,"Experienced the Milford Track in all its glory.  Rain at the beginning bringing out the waterfalls. Low hanging misty clouds giving it the mystical feel.  Howling, cold winds and cloud cover at MacKinnon Pass and then finally the mist cleared and the clouds parted and glorious sunshine appeared to complete our journey into Milford Sound. Totally enjoyed every step of the track.  When considering doing the track I highly recommend using Easy Hikes'Flexi-Pack for both your Water taxi service to and from the track and relocation of your car.  Great service and nice folks to deal with.  Additionally, I would recommend when you finish the track you stay a night at the Milford Sound Lodge and then do a Milford Sound cruise the next morning, altogether different experience seeing the landscape from the water than on foot and well worth it."
175,Fab views on the Sound,"This is by far the best hike/trek in terms of beauty and amenities. I opted for the guided hike as it was Dec. 25th, 1999 and I was treating myself. The ""cabins"" contain double rooms and male and female dorms wit bunk beds, a washer, dryer, gourmet food with wine. They have game rooms and did I mention wine?Departure is pretty much up to you as one guide leave early and the other will wait for the last people to set out on the trail. There is ample time to go off trail to photograph, swim and dawdle at the points of interests. You hike at your own pace with up to 40 people that you only see at meal times which are set.If you don't want to spring for the fete, you an carry your own wine and do  independent trek to comparable cabins (Lodges actually).There are waterfalls everywhere as well as flowers. Watch for the kea birds. They will fly away with what ever isn't stepped down.It is a hike. That is the admission to the beauty. We had a gentleman from Japan who was always last, but he finished every day with a smile. Not bad for 79."
176,Phenomenal NZ guided walk with Ultimate Hikes,"You know you are entering pristine wilderness when your guides advise that ""If the water is flowing it is safe to drink"".Depending on your passion, this walk transports you either to Jurassic Park or Middle Earth. Within minutes of leaving the Lodges you feel you could be the only people on Earth.We did this walk with Ultimate Hikes booking the en-suite rooms. Having your own space and bathroom was an absolute luxury at the end of each hard day.I cannot praise Ultimate Hikes highly enough in taking away the drudgery and making this a memorable experience. Our excellent guides Charlotte, Chenchen, Elizabeth and Jodi ensured we were safe and well served with hot drinks and warm smiles at every stop along the way.The Trek was a struggle for this moderately unfit 64 year old and I found I was bringing up the rear on most days, however I never regretted my having committed to the Experience.Our group was the 5th to last of the season. Nightfall is at 6.30pm at this time of year and, being the last in the group, we only just made it over Mackinnon Pass to Quinton Lodge in time, staggering in at 6.20pm. Special thanks to Chenchen for her firm but subtle encouragement to get me in before nightfall.We were lucky to have fine days on all but Day 1, but even then parts of the track were challenging and felt quite dangerous at times.Tips: -Bring or hire walking poles if you are not young and fit.-Pack the items in the Ultimate Hikes recommended Equipment List. It is comprehensive and well thought out.-Take advantage of their supplied Backpack and PVC Raincoat as they are the most appropriate design for the nature of this Trek. Though the pack may smell a little musty, the sturdy plastic Liner they supply ensures that your possessions are kept as fresh as you have brought them.I wore a Fitbit and continually set new step and stair flight records;Day 2: 33824 steps, 83 flights of stairsDay 3: 41131 steps, 211 flights of stairs (over Mackinnon Pass)Day 4: 44334 steps, 58 flights of stairs.I walked this Track over 36 years ago when I was 27 and I had forgotten how strenuous it was (or maybe I was much younger and fitter then). Other than the more luxurious accommodation this time round, the most significant difference was the increase in the abundance and variety of bird life, now that there is a comprehensive pest control program being carried out. The birds have little fear of humans and saw many native species including a pair of Blue Duck (Whio) in one of the many rapids along the way."
177,Simply fantastic,"Great adventure 4 day guided walk with Ultimate Hikes out of Queenstown We had small packs with personal gear, then beds in lodges each night stunning scenery great food and a barCan be wet however the waterfalls are spectacular second day iis a bit of a climb over a 1200 m passGuides were greatNikParkdale"
178,Wonderful in all weathers,"We walked the track independently in November. We were incredibly lucky with the weather, as we didn't have any rain. We were contacted a week beforehand to notify us that due to an avalanche risk the Mackinnon Pass was shut and a pre-booked helicopter would be needed to get to the other side. However, by the time we got there, most of the snow had melted, so we were able to walk over the top. We didn't have any trouble getting the helicopter charge refunded at the DOC centre in Queenstown. We had to take the emergency track down the other side, but that's fairly normal. We did hear a couple of avalanches while we were up there.We saw lots of small birds - tom tits, robins, fantails, bellbirds, rock wren and tui, There are also friendly weka, kaka and kea which came very close up.We booked the bus from Te Anau to Te Anau Downs and the boat to the start. The bus leaves from the DOC visitors centre, which is 10-15 mins walk from Te Anau, where the bus from Queenstown dropped us off. After the walk we booked the bus back to Queenstown. This was a bus from the main ferry terminal at Milford Sound, which terminated at Te Anau and then we transferred to another bus for Queenstown, which stopped in Mossburn for a 15 min coffee break.Things it would have been useful to know beforehand: Some cookers have lighters. All of the toilets have toilet roll. The flies were worse at the first hut and got progressively fewer as we progressed round. You really need to keep the doors closed in the first two huts to stop the flies getting in. There is dish washing liquid in all huts. Take a tea towel. We didn't see anyone treating the water and we weren't affected. The hut talks were at varying times (7:30pm, 7pm, 8pm in our case). There was a wildlife talk at 5pm at the first hut. You can go for a swim at various places, but it would have been freezing. It's worth having spare camera batteries as you're likely to take lots of photos. No map is needed in the summer - the route is pretty clear everywhere. There are a couple of reasonable length off shoot walks, which are worth doing. Even though there are likely to be around 80 people walking with you, you can still walk more or less on your own by starting late or early. Early nights and starts are normal. You won't get much sleep if you're a light sleeper either due to snoring or keas. Parts of the track are avalanche prone, so there are sections where you are not supposed to stop. When you arrive at each hut in the afternoon, you need to bag a bed and enter your name on the sheet. Boots need to left outside the huts and hung up at the second and third huts to ensure that the keas don't get them. There are some glowworms to be seen a few metres up the track past the first hut. When we went it wasn't particularly cold and we were fine with 2 season sleeping bags and thermals."
179,Simply a 'must do',"group or independant walkers in DOC hut. It rained and rained and rained (it is fiordland) but we had a fantastic time. Scenery fantastic. Hut wardens amazing - Especially Jen at Dumpling. you must do this walk,,,,"
180,Milford Track,Walking independently n the Milford Track is a great way to experience the area. There is so much to see with fantastic scenery and lots of birds.we swam every day in the crystal clear waters - a little cold but worth it.The huts provided are all good with flush toilets and cooking facilities. The huts also have DOC rangers who  have a lot of knowledge about the areas around the hut. Be prepared for all weathers as it can be very changeable and at some point you will get wet as it does rain a lot. We had to wade thorough waist high water off the boat but when we arrived but then in Milford Sound it was clear blue sky. . The track is well formed and easily walked. We walked with people aged from 7 to 80. For those NZers under 18 the huts are free .
181,Rain and limited views is the norm,We booked a one day hike with Real Journeys.  I wish we could have taken 4-5 days to do the whole track but this was a great alternative.  The tour was led by a very knowledgeable and friendly host.  It included a boat ride across Lake Te Anua.
182,Day 1 rocks. Need to come back to do the full walk,"I did this hike with Ultimate Hikes and was lucky with the weather: no rain during the 4 days i was out there. This is RARE. To do this hike, you should be prepared and carry stuff for all types of weather -- from snow to pouring rain to sunshine.  If you go with the guided hikes by Ultimate Hikes, you have the advantage of not having to carry cooking and sleeping gear and you will have very warm drying rooms at the lodges each night if it does rain. If it does rain or is cloudy, you may not see anything up on the pass, either. Also know that the DESCENT from the pass is actually the most difficult section, as it is very  steep and rocky. Watch your step  so you don't fall or twist your ankle. You should have a good level of fitness before doing this hike. If you are in middle age like me (I am 53), you may need to train for this hike. I trained on a stairstepper with a 15 pound back on my back. Alternatively you can train by doing hikes with lots of elevation gain if the weather outside allows for this. If you do get hurt and are unable to walk out, the only way out is by helicoper. For me, going with a guided group really helped with security, safety and comfort."
183,Heaven,"Wow, where to begin... four days, three nights. Bring rain gear as it's likely to get wet - we were really fortunate and had four days of essentially clear weather. I agree with the reviewer who said book a later boat on the return so you can enjoy the relatively flat and extremely beautiful last day hike out. The huts are clean and very welcomed after a long day's trek. Accommodations were fine - flush toilets, gas for cooking, large community room, and clean bunk areas. Don't underestimate the ""downhill"" on day 3 - because of the exposure, rocks and steep steps, it's as hard as the ""uphill"" (in my opinion)! We are very glad to have done this amazing hike - and yes, don't forget your bug spray and be sure to book this early as reservations go fast!"
184,There are not enough words to describe this stunning breathtaking trek,"Did hike in early March, and were blessed with 4 fine and mostly cloudless days,  numerous wonderful memories and photos. All the travel practicalities worked well - DOC huts were clean and well maintained, with interesting nightly talks by enthusiastic rangers, boat rides at each end were straight forward and the Easyhike car relocation worked well. Only comment give yourself plenty of time to enjoy the last day of the walk ( ie consider a later the boat pick up time). It is not just the walk out stage of the trek, there are some lovely water falls and other aspects to enjoy."
185,Great way to spend a few days,Paradox: you want rain to fill the waterfalls and justify carrying a big pack with waterproofs: ...but you want it sunny to see the spectacular views along the way. We had sunshine. The lodges are comfortable (we had an ensuite). The guides were charming and made it a great trip. Unforgettable
186,Breathtaking!,This track is amazing and challenging on the 3rd day. The huts are well organised and the rangers are very helpful. They are clean and tidy and comfortable. The trek itself is inspiring and well worth the visit.
187,I DID IT,"Completing the Milford really is a magical experience, you can definitely see why it is consistently voted one of the best Walks in the world.First things first, actually getting there  takes quite a lot of planning and coordinating; booking your nights in the DoC (Department of Conservation) cabins is first and foremost as the track only allows 40 (non guided) walkers per day and camping in tents is not permitted on the track.I flew down the Queenstown then bused to Te Anau with Traknet, before transferring the next day to DoC transport (bus and ferry) to get to the starting point - Glade Wharf (where due to excessive rain the wharf was under water!) Day 1: this is a great introduction to the track, nice and flat and only around 5km, passing the guided walkers lodge you come up to a nice long swing bridge for some epic pictures. It’s actually nice that first night to have some time to settle into the huts and meet the other 40 people who you’ll see along your journey. Approaching Clinton hut on that first day is like entering a fairy wonderland, with everything covered in bright green moss, making it feel quite magical. I also took advantage of the resident Ranger, who conducted a late afternoon nature walk (highly recommended), takes around an hour but is only about 400m of walking. She talked us through the local plants and birds as well as showing us the best place to spy some Glowworms after dark (well worth staying up to see).With our bellies full (there are gas’s burners provided), it was off to bed (with obligatory earplugs and eye mask) to prepare for a full days walking the next day.Day 2: wow what a day, I was incredibly lucky with the weather, hot and sunny. The day takes you through some outstanding landscape, stunning valleys and alpine vistas. Make sure you take the slight excursion to the Wetlands Track (only around 10-15 minutes) which takes you out into the marshland for some great views. More swing bridges, woodland tracks and river climbs greet you throughout the day as you make your way to Mintaro Hut.Despite a pretty full on day of walking it’s great to relax down by the river (taking a dip if you dare!). I also got to the hut nice and early and with the weather due to close in the next day the DoC Ranger advised us to head up into Mackinnon Pass that afternoon to capture the views, and despite the 2.5hr round trip it was so worth it. Incredible views across both sides of the valley, even saw a small avalanche. I was able to spend some time appreciating the vista (hugely different to the experience the following day).Day 3: well the ranger was right about the weather closing in. They had advised us the night before that we had to be out of the hut by 07:00 latest to ensure we could get over the pass safely, I left at 05:45 and it’s a good job that I did, as the weather was appalling. Having a good quality rain jacket and ample pack protection (dry bags/ rain cover) was essential. Getting up onto the pass was okay despite the rain, but getting to the shelter on top of the pass was a challenge - Howling wind (+130kph), snow and hail. Make sure you stop at the Mackinnon shelter to warm up, put on some extra layers and rest your legs. If the weather is nice though, take advantage of the loo with a view!Getting over and down the other side of pass is particularly tricky in bad weather, there is little shelter from the wind and it’s a very steep decent, a lot of strain on the knees, with much of the track ankle deep in water.The challenge of a day like that definitely gives you a feeling of enormous satisfaction, as you navigate more swing bridges and rivers which come up over your knees. I was incredibly grateful when I spied the sign for Dumpling hut. If it’s been a wet day (barely in mind wet weather is far more common in Fiordland than dry), get into dry clothes as quickly as possible, get the fire lit and have some warm food/drink. Beware of the cheeky Kea’s and Weka if you dare to leave anything outside of the huts, they have become masters of backpack entry, food thefts and boot insole removal.Day 4: A lot easier conditions, warm and sunny with the track gently undulating through more stunning native kiwi forest, a lot of puddles and more wet feet as we navigated through the remnants of the previous days bad weather towards out finish line of Sandfly point. With the final mile marker (the track is measured in miles) calling out the last 400m you soon realise this is completely untrue, with it actually being about a mile to the end. And when you make it to Sandfly point it certainly lives up to its name, I have never seen so many of the nibbling little buggers! The final boat ride taking you into the Sound itself truly sums up this great walk, a marvellous end to a marvellous walk.Top Tips:Don’t forget to collect your DoC tickets from the Te Anau office before you head onto the track.Buy one of the yellow pack liners (these can be purchased at the DoC office), a good bit of extra dry protection.Take lots of layers as we experienced vast changes in weather conditionsDon’t forget your ear plugsTake a good supply of insect repellent (ideally specifically for sandflies) and antihistamines if you are allergicTap into the excellent knowledge of the DoC rangersStop regularly, breathe and enjoy"
188,Absolutely breathtaking and stunning with some challenges,"My husband and I hiked the Milford track at the end of January.  The entire experience was so fantastic that we would both do it again tomorrow if we could.  We had a very rainy start - it was forecast to be 'exceptionally heavy rainfall, even for this area.'  The track was closed for the morning, but reopened for us to get started in the afternoon.  The rain made for stunning waterfalls - literally hundreds falling from the sheer cliffs surrounding the valley we walked up.  It also meant that we had to walk through a lot of water - sometimes at least knee deep.  Every day was different and gorgeous- in terms of scenery,  terrain, wildlife, and weather.  The Department of Conservation did a wonderful job.  I can't speak highly enough of the staff at Te Anau, and the rangers on the track. The staff at Te Anau made sure we knew the risks of going onto the track with heavy rainfall forecast and made sure we had adequate food and equipment.   Each night the hut rangers gave us a 'hut talk', which covered hut etiquette, details of the track the following day, weather report and anything else we needed to know.  One ranger even took us on a nature tour, sharing his incredible knowledge of the flora and fauna.Would totally recommend the Milford track.  It is impossible to put into words the sheer beauty that immerses you every step of the way."
189,Walking with Ultimate Hikes,This track was not easy but well worth the effort. The waterfalls were the highlight for me. Just stunning!  Book early a must. Quite expensive for tourists.
190,This is a must-do!,"The famous Milford Track can be walked either as a 4day/3night ‘independant’ or ‘Freedom’ walker operated by DOC, (see website at http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/great-walks/) or a more up-market fully catered / carry your pack walk over 5 days/4nights with more bells and whistles operated by Ultimate Hikes at about $A1400 pp. With DOC there is a maximum of 40 walkers per day as that’s the capacity of the overnight huts, and it books out early (currently as at Dec 2011 no spaces until March 2012) so we had placed our booking about 8 months in advance. Including the bus transfers to/from Te Anau and the launches to the start and off the track at the end in Milford Sound it cost us about $NZ265pp. We are regular walkers in the 57-62yr age bracket, but upped the activities and trained harder in the preceding two months with walks of 8-12kms a day around the local hills  with back-packs on and did plenty of stretches and weights for upper body strength – we were glad we did!"
191,Awesome experience!,We took the cruise along Milford Sound.  There was a slight mist over the top of the mountains which was for great photos.  It was very windy so you need to be wrapped up - take your camera and you will not be disappointed.
192,Bucket list moment,"Just finished four day Milford Track and it was tremendous.  Concentration of natural beauty from snow-peaked mountains to world class waterfalls and miles of forest right out of the Hobbit.  Each night we stayed in cabins, booked through Ultimate Hikes.  Would do it again tomorrow!"
193,Milford in the rain,"I've hiked all over the world and the Milford has been on my list for most of my life. Finally got a chance to do it and see what all the fuss is about and I was very satisfied. The hike would be a nice challenge for those in average shape, there is a nice pass to climb over and a 13+ mile day at the end. But I would never consider any of the experience strenuous. I did the hike with Ultimate Hikes and would use them again. They were superb, took care of all of the meals and logistics, pointed out interesting things along the way and kept us well entertained for the 5 day adventure. Lodges were comfortable and clean. Meals were filling and excellent. The cherry on top was a morning cruise of Milford Sound before heading back to Queenstown."
194,Independent 4 Day Tramp,"We went with Ultimate Hikes 5 day guided tour. This outfit is incredibly organized with exceptional guides, lodging and meals. Groups are about 50 people and you can lodge in an en suite room or in a group room. There were washing and drying facilities at each lodge. The walk was incredibly beautiful - rainforest, rivers, waterfalls, birds - breathtaking. Though there are many people you walk at your own pace and we were often alone on the trail. Distance walking each day was between 9 and 13.5 miles. Day 3 was the shortest distance but incredibly tough as you walk straight up to the McKinnon pass then straight down. It was the rocky terrain that truly made it difficult and even the most experienced trekkers felt it at the end. I would highly recommend this trek BUT know yourself. If you have existing problems with your feet or knees this may take a toll. I chose to hike before having needed foot surgery and in retrospect this was a poor decision though I do not regret taking part. I just would have enjoyed it even more if I had waited. Our hikers ranged from late 20's to mid 70's."
195,Milford Track. Challenge!,"It all started in late 2010 when watching a documentary and I promised myself to do this ultimate track in one of the world's best and most varied natural beauty spots. Simply magical! Become one with nature, smell the forest fairies and the ancient spirits, feel the trees whispering into your soul!The forest and park (Fiordland National Park) which start at lake Te Anau and finish at Milford Sound have been the shooting ground for ""Lord of the Rings"". The track is 54 km long and it takes 3-4 days for seasoned trekkers, providing ample public refuges (Department of Conservation-NZ) if you are willing to carry your own food and supplies. Alternatively you may opt for a guided tour which will give an opportunity to share the experience with a 'multi-culti' international group and make new friends plus the comfort of having the logistics taken care of and accommodation in excellent private lodges in the park.The highlights: Sutherland Falls (world's 5th highest waterfall), Mackinnon Pass (the highest point of the track) and Milford Sound with cayaks, water falls and seal colonies or a boat cruise right to the edge of the fjord towards the southern ocean."
196,Awesome,"I actually did this hike in late Oct. 2012, but TripAdvisor doesn't allow me to go back that far. For as much as this hike/tramp is built up, it's only OK. Much of the track is very well maintained - to the point that it's almost like walking on a sidewalk. The hiking was good, the views SPECTACULAR, especially when you cross over the MacKenzie Pass (which I was very fortunate to enjoy). The best part was hanging in the huts, getting to know people from near and far...  I've had more difficult hikes, but this was still a very nice hike."
197,Walking in Water,"We did the guided option and though expensive it was worth it. Guides, facilities and meals all excellent. Had 4 seasons of weather in 4 days which added to the experience.  Would do it again."
198,Getting amongst nature,I completed this track almost 20 years ago and it's still th most stunning experience I've ever completed.
199,Photo do not prepare you for the splendor of this trek,We had a great time walking the lovely and scenic Milford Track staying in the DOC huts. I thoroughly enjoyed it but the as flies were a complete menace and I got covered in bites. Be prepared.
200,Very nice track/hike...,"This is one of the best and hardest things I have done. We did the independant walk which meant no showers, carry and cook your own food and great company.We were extremely lucky with the weather, only had a little bit of rain on the last day. I can see how the weather could make or break this walk. The views on top of Mckinnons Pass were beautiful.If you are not fit I would recommend training for this walk (i'm not the fittest person around).  The walk up McKinnons pass was hard but the descent down the other side was worse especially for bad knees. If you are an experienced walker you won't have any trouble.The independant huts were very comfortable with bunk beds and matteresses. The cooking facilities were also very good. All the huts and facilitieswere extremely clean and well looked after.The independant walk was a lot more cost effective than the guided walk. It depends on the amount of comfort you need and if you can carry the weight in your backpack as to which way you would choose to hike. Either way it's a great walk."
201,Just go for it!,We have done many multi-day hikes and this was the best.  The scenery is spectacular.    The day over MacKinnon pass is the most challenging and coming down is harder than going up.  Nevertheless going at one's own pace it is very achievable.  One can limit the clothing one takes as the washing/drying facilities are excellent.  The guides are knowledgeable and always helpful and organisation very good overall.  Lodges are comfortable and well run and good meals provided.  Be prepared for rain but it makes the waterfalls more beautiful.
202,Once in a lifetime trek,Track condition over the McKinnon Pass especially is very bad with lots of loose rocks and uneven surfaces. You had to look at the track all the time to stop getting a twisted ankle. Scenery was amazing. Jan 2018.
203,Amazing nature walk,"We (two of us) completed the 5-day hike (Group #56) with Ultimate Hikes guides Moon, Akiko, Veronica and Shaun. It was awesome. I need to preface that we were v lucky having gorgeous weather bar one morning of rain.The guides were brilliant and made trip, along with a great bunch of fellow hikers from USA, Korea, Japan and Australia. The lodges comfy, food and lunch stations (make your own at beginning of each day) plentiful and hot showers wonderful at end of each day.Here's my pointers, (not dissimilar to other reviews which we found useful pre-hike):1. Only take the gear suggested in the material - you don't need more stuff to carry2. Walking poles are essential (you can borrow them from Ultimate Hikes)3. Do some training so you enjoy the days more4. Invest in a good raincoat and boots5. Use hiking wool in your socks to help save blisters.Ultimate Hikes runs a well oiled machine and highly recommended."
204,Breathtaking at every moment,"This trek is fabulous,  the scenery spectacular and for me, only 1 day was a challenge, day 3 through MacKinnon Pass.  Of course you need to be fit, it's not a stroll in the park.  I trained 8 months in advance.  One thing I would suggest is that if at all possible, train over rocky terrain.  Be prepared for all kinds of weather.   We were lucky, brilliant sunshine, no need to take in food for snacks along the way, it's all provided.   We went on a guided walk, 4 guides with a company called Ultimate Hikes.  A very well oiled machine.   Highly recommended,  if you love trekking and spectacular scenery,  you can't go wrong.   Enjoy.😀"
205,"Well maintained trail, tough terrain at times, totally worth it!","A tramping trip away from it all. Freedom walking with family and friends through this rugged countryside that was the Milford Track, provided a refreshing antidote to the crazy busy pace of city living. The freshness of the air we breathed, plus the pristine native bush provided a visual backdrop that was soothing to all the senses, not just the eyes .....and created a potent sense of belonging to an untouched paradise. The water was crystal clear in the fast moving streams, and so refreshing to drink from the many picturesque and stunning waterfalls. The track was so well maintained, and showed minimal damage to the native flora. The huts provided by the NZ Department of Conservation (DOC) were very comfortable for the thirty plus freedom walkers using them each day. The mixed nationalities among us trampers all getting on so well in the huts each night, provided a rich tapestry of international diplomacy at its best. The weather in our last week of November 2014 was better than forecasted. But the huge snow dump overnight on McKinnon Pass provided an extra challenge to our fitness, both in the ascent but especially in the descent using the emergency avalanche track. The views were spectacular. The photos we took provide such great memories. And the body now feels all the better from such a challenging fitness test. Put it on your list of life experiences to do. You body mind and spirit will thank you."
206,Self-guided hike: Do it! But be prepared,"A year ago we planted the idea of us and another family doing this tramp together - oh my.... so so so lucky to have had the opportunity.  The day the bookings were open we were online to secure our group of 7.  Feel very privileged and proud.  I walked this trek 25 years ago and this experience was so totally different.  With family and friends - what more could you ask for.  Super friendly DOC rangers, beautiful huts, waterfalls and water holes at each corner.  Loved the bunch of other trampers we met - super nice folk ... each with their own story to share.  We loved each footstep, each cracker and cheese meal, and each and every memory - when you look around, we really are just tiny ants on the landscape.  Would like to thank every one we were lucky enough to meet - from our group of independent walkers but also the guided group - laughs shared - Recommend to all - young and old - THANK YOU so so much for the gift of nature"
207,Good alternative to a 5 day hike,"Incredible walk. First time I walked this was on a guided tour with my father. It was nice to have a hot shower and not have to carry food. Definitely worth it for inexperienced hikers or those not super fit. The second time I did it on the self guided tour, which was much more intense and deeply personal. I highly recommend this journey, best 4 day hike ever! A couple of tips. To go independently, book ahead, it fills up quickly. Train for this walk as it is not easy, some days you will walk 18 kms and up many switchbacks over a mountain. Wear layers, and bring extra socks. Good hiking foot wear is a must, not a good place for flip flops. Keep items like shoes, hats inside at the camps, Kia birds will steal anything they can carry. Be prepared for sun, rain, fog and the most amazing views. The terrain changes frequently...breath taking!"
208,Magnificent experience with Ultimate Hikes,"Hi. Back in 1964, I worked in a few shearing sheds in the Southern Otago area. On completion of the run, three of us walked The Milford Track. I was 21 then. On our party there was a youngster,(10 years) and  a lady we affectionately called Miss California, (70 years)The walk back then was an organised trip, ferrry transport, food and accommodation included.We were on the track on Christmas day, and on crossing the river to the boat shed, were greeted by dinner suited waiters, and tables laden with food that had beenbackpacked in for our arrival.The waiters were a little indignant due to our laughter at the scene that greeted us. Here we were, muddy, grotty, maybe sweatty, and here these guys were all spick and span.Now we want to do the trip again. but are not sure if the same tour options ate available."
209,Brilliant hike,This was honestly an amazing tramp! The scenery was absolutely amazing throughout the valleys and on top of Mackinnon's pass. It was quite an easy tramp but be prepared for some rain! The huts were well serviced with good DOC rangers managing them. I would defiantly recommend this track to anyone with reasonable fitness because it was absolutely stunning and is one of the best walks in NZ!
210,Independent lucky walker,"Amazing in every possible way.  It was one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.  The track (trail) is well maintained, the huts are great, the rangers are very nice and helpful.  I recommend this to anyone who loves backpacking, and wants to see what the world's best looks like.A couple things you need to know:1.  There are two ways to do this.  First is a ""Guided Walk"" where you stay in lodges, meals are prepared for you, and you basically just need to walk with your day pack from Hut to Hut.  The huts you stay in are VERY different from the ones utilized by the freedom walkers - note that this is a much more expensive way to do this.  Second, is an independent walk.  This is managed by the DOC (Department of Conservation) and utilizes the exact same trail, but you walk independently, unsupported - you are responsible for carrying everything except a tent, as you sleep in the sparsely equipped huts, which include bunks with pads.  These huts are equipped with gas stoves and sinks.  There are decent bathrooms, with sinks.  There are no showers.  As you do this track, make sure you booked the type that's right for you.  Either way, it's 33.5 miles over 4 days/3 nights, and it's challenging, but fun.  It's very often WET, so you need to be prepared for that, and also be prepared for foot care. Get out and do it!"
211,Ultimate hikes guided walk Milford track.,"Brilliantly managed from booking to the Tom hut ranger escorting us over McKinnon's pass in the snow. Incredibly professional set up with the huts and track in excellent condition. Ranger Ross, in Clinton hut gave a great nature talk and walk and then another evening talk - well worth listening too.  It's an easy walk - especially day 1. We walked with kids aged 11 - 16 and all coped well on the track. we had 2 days of sunshine followed by rain and snow which made the scenery all the more amazing. Pack smart - take your wet weather gear and you'll have a blast."
212,Day hike on the Milford Track,"This has to be one of the great walks of the world. No superlative is hyperbole. You need to book and book early to get a place on this iconic walk. Mountain passes, temperate rainforests, spectacular waterfalls, skinny dipping in gin clear mountain lakes. What more could you wish for? Not for the faint hearted; these are proper mountains with proper mountain weather. If you are fit, you will never forget Milford Track."
213,Everything in 4 days,"What to say, just amazing. Keep in mind, we hiked for 4 days and we only had good weather for 1. The one day we were supposed to see the most beautiful views, we saw nothing. But that can't make me give it fewer stars - it's a truly spectacular place and even with bad weather there is still beauty to experience - the moss, the fern forest, the fog. It's an expensive hike - for two people it cost us $800USD but considering you can't get in or out without a boat and that they have to fly the poop out by helicopter, I guess it's a bargain. Bring lost of warm clothes, and a few changes in case you get the bad weather and just enjoy!"
214,One for the bucket list!,"It was my 1st hiking. The experience was superb. It was a 5 days 4 nights trip in which we walked to one lodge to another in 6-8 hours walk. Beside the walk and carrying the bag, everything was being taken care of. After the walk, I was able to get a good hot shower, got some wines or beers before dinner. Good food everyday, lovely and friendly guides, footcare was available for those who in need. Throughout the walk, I experienced some beautiful scenes and challenging paths. It was enjoyable and fun. My most favorable part was milo was being served during the walk to energise the body. Love it and definitely will highly recommend the track!"
215,A walk through incomparable beauty,"Wow did this end of January as a freedom walker.You have to book months in advance.We had just come from the central Otago drought and temperatures over 30 degrees. Arrived to be told our trip was going to be cancelled because of torrential rain and flooding and they could not move the hikers onto their next nights hut. Anyway by 11am the all clear was given and we started our trip.Next day it continued to rain and we arrived very sodden and temperatures were dropping.. Early evening and it started to clear and we cold see the majestic mountains above us with a sprinkle of snow. Started off the next day and soon found ourselves  walking in snow. First tracks!!  Onward and upward till we reached McKinnons pass and knee deep fresh snow.. The clouds lifted and we experienced a most awesome view at the top. One had to saviour the moment (and feel sorry for the people that missed it the previous days) After lingering to absorb the undescribable feeling we ate and started down. This was by far the hardest part for me. It seemed to go on and on and my knees did not like it even though I had poles..Although feeling shattered we still made our way to see the spectatular Bowen falls. Almost fell into the hut .. a long day. Last day Summer was coming back. Beautiful day finished with Milford sound at its finest. Clear blue sky,snow capped peaks and calm water. Could never have Mitre Peak look better than that. In other words BE PREPARED for any weather."
216,Superb walk in rain and sun!,"Relatively easy track if you have any level of fitness. You get a wide variety of scenery but still alot of time spent in the forest. MacKinnon pass day is the only bit of a challenge but any experienced trekker won't have a problem. The rest of the tramping is fairly easy by North American Standards espically if you have hiked the rockpile in New Hampshire. It is a beautiful hike but the finest walk in the world is a boast at best guess. Unless you have been in the Rocky Mountains in Canada hiking by Elk, Mountain goats with majestic mountains all around you or in southern  Utah in Bryce or Zion National Parks just to name a few could be considered some of the finest as well. Go to Nepal and hike from Lukla to Everest Base Camp and you'll see the finest in my opinion."
217,Excellent and achievable,"This walk was even more glorious than I thought. Worth every step. We had 4 days, of blue sky and very warm which made it even more, beautiful.  A must do! Facilities were awesome and track well maintained."
218,Great track,"This is the reason we came to NZ, to experience some real away from it all time in a  pristine environment. Our trek started on the 29 Jan and we took the rustic option, our base was Te Anau which was great as we left our luggage at the Lakeside campsite, only $10 for a locker, and picked it up on our way back on the Queenstown bus. We opted for the independant walk which was way beyond our expectations. The DOC have this so well organised, the huts are clean and the wardens are all excellent. Ross is a star, he gave us such a great insight into the ecology of this forest that we would not have appreciated without his expert knowledge. Don't forget your earplugs as the bunkhouses are intimate, or just deal with it. We were blessed with wall to wall  blue skies for the 4 days and the views and scenery were just unforgettable. We thoroughly enjoyed the company over the trek and would particularly like to thank the young Alaskan couple for their kindness when my wife injured her lag on the way down to the Dumpling Hut, all's well now thanks.The paths are great, just take care coming down from Mackinnon Pass, the third day is a tiring walk and there is no need to rush it, you will have plenty of time to get down to the Dumpling Hut. If I did it again I would sneak in a bottle of wine and a couple of beers, you could chill them in the river, at the end of the day it would be the icing on the cake."
219,Do this!,"Hi folks. I'm a spanish girl who has just done milford track in the latest december. It's the most beautiful trail i've ever done. It's the pure essence of the nature. We're lucky, during the track only rained 2 days. I still remember the sights of waterfalls running down, while i was cooking in dumpling hut. I enjoyed very much, in spite of sandflies (don't forget repellent). People we met was very nice, michael, the group of dunedin, matias & his girlfriend. I hope to return some day and stay a longer time & explore these lands so green, so wild, so faraway. Thanks new zealand. Lourdes Mencia"
220,A must for everyone's bucket list,"This is a wonderful hike in terms of the diversity of scenery, vegetation and walking over three days, along a track which is incredibly well maintained by DOC.  You do not need a guide to do this hike.  But if you take a guide, you can go the luxury ultimate hikes route, staying in their lodges and not carrying your food with you.  The lodges include drying rooms - really appreciated in wet weather, and it seems always to be wet. The problem is that you are then part of a 50 person group.  That requires organisation and Ultimate Hikes is good at organisation.  But it then feels like a school trip, or a big group tour for active over 50s.  Lots of discipline and setting off each morning in a long crocodile.  And weird group dynamics.  Probably fine if you come as part of your own group (as many did) but uncomfortable if you come as a couple.  It’s all communal dining at big tables and pre supper drinking, with people making a dash to get their places when the supper bell (metaphorically) is rung.  And everybody seeming to make out that this is a really challenging hike for which they’ve been training for ages.  It isn’t that challenging, and I say that as somebody who does very little exercise and did minimal preparation. But I was walking in dry clothes and boots each day and I might have felt differently had I gone the independent route."
221,Absolutely beautiful and very social!,"It was rainy first couple of days and we missed seeing the amazing view it had to offer.We used backcountry cusine which was light and easy to carry and very tasty at the end of the walk. Unfortunately, if you walk slow, you wont be able to claim a bottom bunk bed as they are all taken up by the faster walkers in a first come first serve basis.With EzyHike, all the work was done in the background to help us get back home. The service was seamless and all worked smoothly. I didn't need to worry about transporting back to Queenstown, and we had fresh clothes, snacks and soft shoes ready for us in the car when we finished our walk."
222,A center cut from the most beautiful place on earth,"WOW, this a must do hike!! we loved it as unguided hikers.   The first day is a breeze.  Almost a letdown.  However, after dropping our packs @ the hut on Day 2 we made a late trek and made McKinnon Pass as the skies were clear... amazing views in awe of creation!  Did the same the next day with a pack on.  Day three was tough for us, 400m up, 1000m down.  My calves were talking to me!  Great photos and scenery!!  Sutherland falls was a great side trip... dragged our butts there and were rewarded.  Day 4 is really a half day walk out; reasonably comfortable.   Big warning - you will have to deal with SANDFLYS!"
223,Milford Track walk,"Hiked MIlford Track Jan 2010 with Ultimate Hikes (www.ultimatehikes.co.nz). Very well organized enterprise from pre-departure briefing to collection of borrowed backpacks at trip's end. Track is 33.5 miles over 3 days of hiking. We had great weather, but it rains 360"" annually on the track, so be prepared and don't be afraid to get wet. Each day up to 50 guided hikers (supported by Ultimate Hikes guides and facilities) and 40 independent hikers (carrying their food, sleeping bags and using separate huts) start the Track. It takes a full day to reach trailhead from Queenstown (bus, lunch, bus, boat, short walk). Lodges for guided hikers on the track are clean, with ample hot water, flush toilets, well-prepared meals, beer and wine available for separate fee, and electricity until 10p. At track's end, a short boat ride to the Milford Sound transportation center and shuttle to lodge with beautiful views of the Sound. On day 5, cruise Milford Sound & bus back to Queenstown. Hikers leave at different times and spread out along the track, so those seeking solitude can easily find it. Hikers were international, friendly and generally experienced. Unbelievable scenery, diverse ecoclimates, variety of funny terrestrial birds, temperate rainforest flora reminiscent of Jurassic Park. Swimming opportunities for the hardy. No giardia in New Zealand, so can drink the water without treating it.Bring as little as possible, as you have to carry everything. Recommend Gortex boots (lots of streams to ford), paclite rain gear. Rather than using the free loaner cotton sleepsheet, spring for the $7 silk sheetliner, it's lighter. Also, rent 2 hiking poles from Ultimate Hikes for the long downhill from MacKinnon pass. I brought my own pack, but reportedly the free loaner packs were fine. Stayed at Scenic Suites in Queenstown before & afterward; no problem leaving a bag there while on the track. Washer & dryer in the suite very welcome at trail's end. Can take Connectabus to/from airport to Millennium Hotel and walk 1/2 block to Scenic Suites, thereby saving taxi fare."
224,MIND BLOWING SCENERY WITH ULTIMATE GUIDES AND ACCOMMODATION,"Awesome part of the world, amazing scenery and had 3 out of 4 days of great weather (unfortunately MacKinnons Pass was the wet weather day but still a great experience). Booked via DOCs and independently walked. Rangers and huts were fantastic. Huts were warm with fires, mattresses were comfortable enough and rangers spoke each night regarding the track and area. Take spray for sandflies, they are annoying. Used Easyhike NZ for relocating our car from TeAnu Downs to Milford Sound and also hired hiking pack, gear & food from them. Can't rate Easyhike enough, 10 out of 10 excellent service and all gear/food was top notch. Made it all so easy as we flew in the day before the Milford Sound hike and our packs, gear and food was waiting in our rooms. Car relocation was great option as we stayed at Milford Lodge at the end of the hike and it was nice not travelling on further after tramping for 4 days. Car was easy to locate and Easyhikes collection of the gear afterwards was straight forward and stress free at our accommodation in Queenstown several days later. Easyhike made the whole hike a great experience from start to finish. Even if you use you're own gear/food, the car relocation option is definetly a great service and worth every penny."
225,A must do,"What a fantastic way to see some isolated, spectacular and beautiful parts of the South Island. The trek was extremely well organised and run. The guides were perfect. Informative, helpful and encouraging when needed. The lodges comfortable, with hot showers, great food, spectacular views and everything a weary traveller may need. Very beautiful part of the world!"
226,Amazing place but the sand flies are killer.,"I am new to hiking and trekking so when my more experienced partner and our two friends suggested this track, I was initially all for it....we booked it (unguided) in Aug 2014 to complete it just before Easter 2015....as the time began to approach, I started to get a bit worried that I had signed myself up for more than I could handle. I have a moderate fitness level but lack stamina and experience with what food to bring, when to eat it and even staying in huts with no showers were a bit worrying. Luckily my friends were very supportive and helped me to get through the panic stage!I shouldn't have worried. Not only are the unguided huts almost luxurious (flushing toilets, flowing water, gas hobs) they were well maintained (no dirty bathrooms) and were quite lovely with some having a wood burner to dry off clothes/get warm. The walk itself was absolutely incredible with some of the most humbling and surreal views I've ever experienced...at one stage we walked through the forest with what we thought to be lots of white cloud on our right side only to discover when we arrived to the clearing that this had been a snow capped enormous mountain!! I would recommend carrying less clothes that you think you need- I overpacked in a panic and regretted the weight come Day 3...you will get wet, you will smell, you just need to realise that everyone else does too and no-one cares!!Here are my tips from a novice's view:DO bring the following:- Deet bug spray...this is a MUST. One area is called Sandfly Point- for a very obvious reason!- Wet wipes (aka a blessed shower in the evenings)- Suncream- Good hiking socks and boots- make sure to break them in pre-trip- At least one if not two walking poles- I found this essential for the downhill from Mackinnon Pass on Day 3 and to help tired legs on Day 4!- A treat for each day and each night- chocolate is fantastic (you will get sick of cereal bars/trail mix) some lollies are also a delicious treat along with tea or hot chocolate at night before bed- Good quality EAR PLUGS - trust me, snorers are everywhere (including my friend!!) - Some jandals or old runners to wear in the evening around the hut as you are not allowed to wear your boots- Head torch to get around the hut and bathrooms along with any early starts- Dry Shampoo to freshen your hair up if you like- get a travel sized one - Lots of layers especially merino/polypro to whip on and off when needed- the temperatures change quickly- Gore Tek waterproof pants and jacketAnd most of all....enjoy it! It's a once in a lifetime experience :)"
227,Milford Track Freedom Walk,Terrific walk with the most spectacular views! The huts are well equipped with gas cookers and sinks with running water and detergent. We did the walk un-guided and it was fantastic as we could take it at our own pace. DOC does a remarkable job maintaining the track and preparing guides and maps etc. The rangers at each hut are so helpful and friendly! Pack prepared for all types of weather!
228,Amazing trek!,"This walk was the highlight of our trip to New Zealand's South Island last January.  We booked the guided walk because we wanted a private room---- after a night in a dorm room shared with 9 other hikers at Phantom Ranch ( bottom of the Grand Canyon) a few years ago my husband said he would never do that again!).  We were very happy with our choice and felt the guided walk was worth ever penny.  We were particularly glad to have expert guides on the last day, when we were advised that we would have to wade through a hip-deep pool where the track was flooded ( it rained all three days of our walk so was wet everywhere, but this was the deepest).  The guides were in communication by radio and the one in the lead called back to the lunch hut to report on the track conditions.  The guide at the hut---a delightful young woman----cheerfully advised us we would have to wade through but ""don't worry, there is no current""!  Since I am fearful of wading streams with fast-moving water this was very reassuring.  I actually had no trouble with the flooded area at all.  My husband, who walked without trekking poles, slipped and fell in, getting soaked up to his neck.  Fortunately it was a warm day.  Also, since he used the large plastic bag provided by Ultimate to line his backpack, nothing inside got wet.I should explain that the walk is not ""guided"" in the sense that you stick together as a group with the guides.  Everyone is free to walk at their own pace, in solitude if they wish.  There is always a guide at the front and one at the very back, but the walkers spread themselves out according to their walking pace.  Rooms at the lodges are simple but very comfortable.  We actually spent very little time in our rooms apart from showering and sleeping, as we enjoyed the social atmosphere of the lounge area in each lodge.  The food is excellent---there is a choice of meat ( beef or venison), fish, and a vegetarian main at each dinner.  They also proved a gluten-free option, which I chose.  The guides are fantastic---very friendly but also very professional.  And it was fun meeting our fellow walkers, talking with them while walking, and socializing before dinner.  Our group was largely Australians and Japanese, with a few Kiwis as well.  We were the only ones from across the Pacific.  All in all I would recommend the Ultimate hike very highly to anyone who finds the logistics of planning and booking a ""freedom walk"" using the DOC huts a bit daunting.  Ultimate took care of everything, including transport to and from the track ( with the option of a helicopter flight back at extra cost, which 12 of the Australians chose.). All we had to do was show up in Queenstown at the appointed time on the evening before our walk."
229,Couldn't have dreamed of a place so beautiful,We thought about organised tour but settled on doing it ourselves through DOC. Although much harder carrying all our own food and utensils for four days it was worth the extra effort.
230,A dream fulfilled ...,"I completed the trek as part of the Ultimate Hikes guided hike. We had 5 days of beautiful weather with only a little rain on the bus ride to the boat ride to the trail head. The 4 days of actual hiking were largely sunny. This is not a likely occurence especially for the New Zealand spring. The positive to that is that the trekking was much easier and you can see the surrounding mountains really well. The only downfall is that the many waterfalls ere not as full as you would expect. The hike itself is full of spectacular views with mountains and rivers with crysta clear water. Water that you can safely drink (which I regularly did). The trail starts out very wide and level but progressively gets more uneven and as you progress towards and after McKinnon pass. This is not a difficult hike but you had better prepare for it or it could be difficult.The guided option fits where I am in my life (I am 57). I want what the hike has to offer but I like the comfort of a good meal and wine once the day is done. Ultimate Hikes provides an excellent service and given the remote location I might say that it is almost a luxury. The meals were great and provided a good representation of what New Zealand has to offer (venison, lamb and local fish). I had a bunk room to myself as I appeared to be the lone male on the trek.The guides (Alex, Ant, and Moon) were all very good and provided the information needed to make the hike a good experience. What I liked was that they were there for you (if needed) without being in the way (or perhaps a better way of saying it - noticeable).All in all a great experience and one that I would recommend."
231,Absolutely amazing!!,"Just amazing.  There were four cloudless days when I hiked.... and it was beyond anything I could imagine.  I wouldn't bother with the guided hike.... unless it saves you having to buy hiking packs and other basic tramping gear.  This is the kind of walk that would be very different with different weather, more dramatic in the (usual) rain but equally amazing and different with blue sky.  It is definitely worth booking months in advance and taking the chance."
232,Lucky to experience this great walk,So the first hut is a bit of a waste of time and it would be easy to make the second hut on day one. The trek is ok with one reasonable day of ascent over the pass. We didn’t get much of a view but it was a good walk none the less. We had to do the ‘emergency decent’ track on the far side of the pass due to rockfall dangers; it is tricky to find a rhythm due to the big steps required. Amazing rain on our last day which made the rock walls pour with water. We did a car relocation with EasyHike - great service and highly recommended.
233,The best trekking experience of my life!,We were lucky enough to see the track on three fine clear days with amazing and unforgettable views! We did the track 23rd January to 26th January. I would like to call this heaven on earth! The crystal clear water from the rivers and the reflection of blue sky on the water are unimaginable and will stay with you forever. A must see walk.Be prepared for sandflies with long clothing where possible.
234,Most beautiful hike ever,"Loved it. Beautiful scenery, and a great sense of achievement on completion. Day 1 was easy, day 2 more challenging but still fun, and day 3 and 4 were tough - in our case, relentless rain and strong wind over the pass made it tougher than it would otherwise be. Be prepared to hike in wet shoes most of the day, as rain is very common for obvious reasons, and there are a bunch of creek crossings on day 4 where you can’t avoid getting wet boots. It’s not so bad once you get used to it sloshing around. Pack liner recommended as you’ll be miserable if you can’t at least start your day in dry clothes. Drying is not great at the huts, though everything else is pretty good. Brace yourself for snorers, talkers and/or flippers on night 1, with 20 sharing a bunk room. If you get in early on day 2 you can snaffle one of the smaller rooms available with only 8 beds. Better odds. What else? Mozzie repellant!! Sand flies are a killer at the 3rd hut and the finish line. Matches, in case one of the stoves which has an igniter isn’t available. My friend packed a trigger ball which was handy (though very first world). Flip flops as you absolutely will not want to put your boots on at night if you can avoid it, and of course the sleeping areas are separate to the toilets and the cooking area. And pack at least 2 pairs of extra socks."
235,Did the hike for the third time!,"""Epic"" was the word my husband and I used to describe our five day adventure in this most beautiful part of the earth. One is gently eased through the the first two days, building up stamina for Day 3 over the Mackinnon Pass and then down to the splendour of the Sound on day 5. The Ultimate Hikes guides are there every step you need them and out of the way when you want to have the track all to yourselves for what could be hours at a time. The track itself looks as if it has been freshly zhooshed up by expert landscape designers just for you. One is never far from chrystaline mountain streams lakes or waterfalls and the ferns, mosses, trees and curious bird life make for constantly changing scenery. When the clouds opened at the top of the pass to reveal the snow topped sirque of mountains with the Clinton Valley on one side and the steep descent into the Arthur Valley on the other we felt completely exhilarated.We were very lucky with perfect weather, but I like the guides advice, ""there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothes and bad attitude"".Advice: pack as little as possible in your pack - you can wash stuff and get it well dried each evening. Walking poles essential. Merino clothes great. Treat the sand flies with respect - I'm still itchy five days later."
236,Did the hike in 2001!,"Due to a challenging booking process (the Milford Track season was fully booked within minutes after opening the booking system) we did the Milford Track directly after arriving in New Zealand. Actually it helped us to overcome the Jet Lag (12 hours time difference to our home country) immediately. We did the track with our two girls (12 and 15 years) and they enjoyed it very much. Luckily we had no rain during the track but benefited from heavy rain before leading to many water falls and a fantastic nature. We did the independent walk and the hut rangers gave every evening relevant information during the ""Hut Talk"" (weather, nature, watch outs/ highlights for the next day). The huts itself are basic but provide a save accomodation and the necesary cooking facilities (gas-cookers, dish washing liquid). Exxpect many sand flies during the track, so prepare ourself with the necessary anti-sand-fly things."
237,Hike of a lifetime,"Considering that the Milford area has a higher rainfall than the Amazon, we were lucky to have such great conditions! We managed to have about two days of light rain, however this was welcome as it transforms the landscape into something so different. It was nice to be able to compare the days. Not for the faint hearted, there was some hard work to be done on days three and four however the reward was so worth the effort with stunning panoramic views at most points on the track and also at the location of the DoC huts. At the huts you were welcomed with good clean, warm and well set out huts. DoC rangers are VERY knowledgeable about the area and the track. As per other Alpine walks, PLEASE come prepared with appropriate equipment."
238,Milford Track 1964,"9 of us walked the track as independent walkers, carrying our own packs with sleeping bags, clothing and food. We stayed in the DOC provided huts for 3 consecutive nights, after walking 5-7 hours each day. The huts were very adequate and clean, with gas stoves and a kitchen. We slept on individual bunks with matresses provided. The walk is breath-takingly beautiful & we all enjoyed it immensely. You need a reasonable level of fitness, although it was the downhill leg which proved the most testing. The uphill leg is not too steep, and the rest of the track is relatively flat. It is important to take a good pair of air plugs, as snorers in the cabins are the only fault I could make of the whole experience. If you have the opportunity to do this hike- Do it! You won't regret it. Our group ranged in ages between 22 and 62 yrs."
239,Great hike to do independently,"We loved everything about the trek and the Ultimate guides.  It was the highlight of our trip.  We also had great weather and did not see a drop of rain for the whole 5 day trip.  There was not a cloud in the sky when we crossed Mackinnon Pass.  When I booked the trip, I did not know how unusual this was and not sure I would have enjoyed it as much in the rain.  A typical day on the trail will have rain 50% of each day so be warned.  Some guides will tell you that some of the scenery is more beautiful in the rain (waterfalls and mosses open up).  The lodges are well equipped with drying rooms etc for your clothes, boots, etc.  It’s easy to see why some people consider this one of the finest walks in the world.  The scenery is amazing – the forest and rivers on the first and third days of walking; the mountains on the second day that seem to go straight up into the sky.  The water is so clear, you can drink straight from the rivers along the track.  The track is one way which keeps traffic down.  I was surprised that most of each day was spent walking on our own and the trail feels very isolated and peaceful.  You see the guides come and go to make sure you are ok.  You also see people at lunch and rest stops but the rest of the time it is easy to adjust your walking so that no one is anyone around.The lodges are comfortable and the food is very good.  The lunch making options and snacks include anything you can think of to make a wrap, sandwich or salad.  All our guides were very knowledgeable and had a genuine love for people and nature.  They were more than happy to patch a blister or hot spot to keep a blister from forming.  They even strapped my ankle for the last day to give some extra support.  My feet have never felt so good after so much walking.The walk is easy the first day and challenging the second day.  The third day is also moderate but you’ll be sore just from the cumulative walking.  If you are not used to walking with a pack with 15lbs, you may want to do some conditioning to get used to it.  For me, it’s much harder to go uphill with a pack on because my legs get tired much faster.  You’ll need good waterproof boots.  We had our own packs and walking poles but the ones loaned from the guides looked very good and kept pack weight on hips instead of shoulders.  We also splurged and took the helicopter option back to town at the end of the trip – the views were amazing!  All in all, it was the trip of a lifetime that exceeded all my expectations."
240,Wonderful - a must do!,"This hike is an amazing journey and a MUST DO for all who love the mountains, nature, glaciers, ferns, moss, water, etc. You can do it one of two ways- independently or guided with Ultimate Hikes. We took the Ultimate Hike route (please see separate review for them) and couldn't have been more pleased. Whichever way you decide to do it, make sure you are prepared. Good shoes, good poles, and gear for every kind of weather. We saw 30s (F) and windy and we also saw sunny and 70s (F). We also got a little rain, though I understand most trekkers get lots more. Also be prepared for the sandflies. Of course, I was told about the sandflies too... And I'm not sure what you can do about them, but I can tell you natural repellent doesn't work. The bites are very itchy and last a long time! Cover your skin to reduce the number of bites you get. Despite sandflies, rain, sleet or snow, it is worth the time, effort and money for this amazing trip! (:"
241,Awesome hike with amazing scenery,"I'm neither the weakest nor strongest hiker. I'm used to day hikes and packing for one-night treks. This was my first multi-night experience, so the DOC's hut system was a helpful transition when it came to saving weight. I feel stronger and readier to backpack for real now.Did it independently with my partner and still felt rather spoiled by the huts! They had great cooking, toilet, and bunking facilities—with potable water to boot. The guided groups must have felt utterly luxurious in comparison. I made reservations the day the bookings went live. Seems like locking it down way in advance was a good idea. Did our Te Anau Downs boat transfer via Fiordland Water Taxi so we wouldn't feel too pressed for time; opted for their Flexipack. Easyhike was the company that transferred our rental car from one end to the other—a great service with drivers that can be trusted with your luggage!As the trip approached, I obsessively monitored the weather and did expect rain. Our 4 days on the track were half dry, half wet. Got great views of Clinton Valley, and thick clouds on Mackinnon Pass. It was moody and dramatic, and we managed to get sporadic sights of the peaks and valleys from the high point. I was grateful for the summer precipitation when seeing the countless waterfalls—imagining how hot and sweaty some exposed sections would've been otherwise... And I was so relieved it didn't flood!They aren't joking about the joint-stressing descent off Mackinnon Pass. I was glad to have worn boots. Those who complain about the track not being well formed enough makes me giggle. Sure, there were a handful of sketchy sections that require care, but those are what make hiking what it is. It would've been a lame and literal ""walk in the park"" without that dynamism. Besides, the entire trail construction constantly impressed me!They also aren't kidding about the sandflies. They are everywhere, so religious use of repellant is important (I neglected to spray myself in certain places at certain points and got small welts that itched for more than a week). The sandflies get significantly worse at Dumpling Hut and you'll meet an insane swarm at Sandfly Point Shelter.I loved it and understand why it's so popular. It's supposed to be the ""easiest"" of the Great Walks, and even then it's a challenge! 3 days out of 4 are quite long.Really enjoyed the birds—their encompassing sounds, the curious robins, the funky carefree weka, and that one huge, shaggy kea that visited us on the porch of Mintaro Hut. The rainforests were so lush with funky native trees, prehistoric ferns, moss, and lichens. If you're an alpinist-type that constantly needs big mountain views, this one may not be for you. You get countless mountains surrounding the whole Clinton Valley on the second day, and on the third day climbing around the pass before disappearing back into the trees. The last day is just a super long forested walk to the end.If you're a big geek about birds and flora, you'll probably have multiple orgasms."
242,extraordinary but make sure you are well prepared,"We thought it may be too much for the kids as companies we contacted did not want to take under 10. Kids smashed the 1 day out and did rob Roy the next day. Track is well displayed and laid out.Need boots and proper gear. Rained, was cold, then warm all in a few hours.Walkers that did the whole walk were stoked to never wanting to walk again...Track the 1 day taste was not enough"
243,Breathtaking scenery,"The march is challenging but it is definitely worth it!  Beautiful nature, mountains and great guides!"
244,Don't do it like I did!,"Firstly, this is a wonderful experience and the views are astonishing so it is highly recommended. I knew nothing about it before we went but many people on the walk had been wanting to do it for decades and I understand why. There's no need to review the actual track - it is one of the most beautiful in the world but you have no control over the weather. We were incredibly lucky and had perfect weather all 4 days and then it poured with rain when we were on the Sound so we saw all of the waterfalls.  That said, Day 3, walking over McKinnon Pass would have been incredibly hard going if it had been raining as you are clambering over rocks and it is very steep both climbing up and down.I was a bit disappointed with the accommodation.  Many of our companions (there are 50 on each tour) were hardy hikers who are used to staying in mountain huts and competed to tell the most gruelling stories of hardships encountered.  I am not one of these! We stayed in the best rooms available in the lodges which had en-suite bathrooms but were still very basic with no creature comforts and a hot water bottle (which leaked!) instead of heating. You have to get up before 6am to prepare your own lunch before breakfast. You have to carry your own rucksack with no option for it to be transferred between lodges.  Meals are eaten communally and are basic but filling, rather like ski chalet catering. We were worried about such a big group trekking together but, in fact, after half an hour we'd all spread out and we were often by ourselves in the forest. We had four guides accompanying us all but their job seemed to be to ensure that we were safe so they constantly walked up and down the line and we were given the bare minimum of commentary regarding our surrounding, which was disappointing. I guess, bottom line, this was quite expensive for such a basic type of  tour and I would have liked the option of paying for a higher level of comfort.  We have previously trekked the Salkantay Trail with Mountain Lodges of Peru where the climbing was harder but our bags were carried by pony and the lodges had hot tubs and masseurs. We were also accompanied by a very experienced guide with was encyclopaedic knowledge of the flare and fauna as well as the topography we were traversing.  Milford Track was so much more beautiful but the whole experience was less rewarding."
245,"A great walk in the 1972, equally so in 2013.","Absolutely fantastic few days with memories you'll have forever. The trail is beautiful from start to finish. You can self-guide as it's very well marked and the overnight huts are easy to find. Be sure you are relatively fit and pack enough food. We noticed some of the other trekkers had not brought enough food and were quite hungry even after dinner. The good thing is that your pack gets lighter as you eat. It was really the highlight of the 3 weeks I spent touring the south island. Ok one of the highlights (NZ is just amazing all around). Book early and get prepared, but well worth the effort. I rented equipment in the village at the start of the trek and just brought my own good walking boots. If you get the chance, don't pass it up. You'll have no regrets."
246,Just do it,"What a magnificent trail and experience. 54 kilometers of incredible beauty and diversity. Hiking through forests, wetlands, prairies and over MacKinnon Pass. Traversing rock strewn avalanche passes and crossing rivers and streams on picturesque suspension bridges. Beautiful ponds and lakes and at times waterfalls too numerous to count! All the while following the beautiful Clinton and Arthur rivers toward Milford Sound. If you have the desire and opportunity to experience this adventure my advice is to do so.  Just a few thoughts that might be helpful.1. Yes you can hike this trail as long as you are reasonably fit. I can not stress this enough. I did the hike guided with Ultimate Hikes. We had 37 people in our group ranging from age 19-75. Everyone finished the entire hike. A few people did look a little tired at the end of certain days, but by the next morning everyone seemed ready to go! The huts are spaced reasonably apart so that the hike each day is very doable.2. You can hike at your own pace. We had 4 guides. The first walked as fast as the fastest people wanted to hike. The second walked as slow as the slowest people wanted to hike, and the other two just stayed in the middle. Everyone walked at the pace they wanted, took breaks when they wanted, etc. 3. The trail is very well maintained. 	1. Almost all sections of the trail are easy to walk with good footing. The exception is the            1800 +/- vertical ascent over MacKinnon pass and the descent. These sections are            steeper, rockier, and the terrain is more uneven. 	2. Take the optional trails, especially to Sutherland Falls. It is truly spectacular, especially            close up.4. The weather is unpredictable. We had two beautiful sunny days and two days where it rained continuously. When we climbed above tree line to go over the pass the wind was so strong that the rain came at us sideways. My advice is to prepare and pack for wet conditions. If you have great weather the whole time you won’t need everything you brought but if you have a few bad weather days you will be glad you did. I recommend:		1. A good raincoat		2. A thick plastic bag to line the inside of your pack to keep everything dry.		3. A rain cover for the outside of your backpack. 		4. A rain hat – much more comfortable than the hood of your raincoat. Outdoor                     Research (OR) makes a great one called the Seattle Sombrero. 		5. Light wool hat and light gloves		6. Water proof boots		7. Boot gators. If the trail is wet or your have to cross streams they will help keep                    your boots dry. Again OR makes good ones. 		8. Some type of waterproof protection for your camera. 		9. Some people had waterproof pants. If you are the type of person who gets cold                    easily then I think it is a good idea. I did not bring them and was fine, but make                    sure that at the very least you have some type of long pants that are not made of                    cotton.  		*Ultimate Hikes provides backpacks, backpack covers, plastic liners, and raincoats if                 you need them at no charge. The backpacks and plastic liners were of good quality                 but the other items were only of mediocre quality. I would recommend bringing your                 own raincoat and backpack cover.5. The lodges were great	1. The common area where you eat meals, prepare lunches, socialize, relax, etc. is very             spacious, comfortable, and attractive. 		2. Shared dorm rooms are sufficiently large so everyone has room for gear, etc. 	3. Private rooms are a nice size with private baths. Almost like a nice motel room.	4. Clothes wash areas have everything you need and the drying rooms work very well.            Usually clothes are dry in 3 hours or so. Boots usually take all night but are dry by the            time you awake. Because of this you can wear the same clothes to hike each day and            they are clean and dry. 		5. Power usually comes on at 6:45 and stays on till 10pm. Hot water is available during            these times. If you would like to wake up earlier or stay up later, I recommend a small            headlamp.6. Food - You do not have to bring food. Breakfast and suppers were large and U. H. provided a large quantity and variety of food to prepare your own lunch. There were also snacks in the lodge when you arrived up until supper time. The quality of the food was excellent. Venison, steak, fish, pasta, chicken. All plentiful and tasty. I gained a few pounds during the four days.7. Guides – the guides were young, all in their twenties, but very knowledgeable of the trail, plants, wildlife, etc. Everyone that I spoke to in our group was extremely pleased with them. And they all had a genuine warmth and enthusiasm that was endearing.8. Ultimate Hikes – Top notch. They have been doing this for a long time and it shows. They exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend them. If you are considering hiking the Milford Track I hope this review encourages you to do so. The hike itself will take you four days. I believe the memories will be with you for a lifetime!"
247,Great experience,"I am so glad I trained for this walk with a heavy pack. As a relatively fit middle 40s, woman, I thought the Milford Track would be challenging but not as long and hard as it was. As independent walkers, the 1st day was a very short one. Day 2 was quite a long valley walk with a gentle climb to the Hut at the end. Day 3 was the killer. I did not mind the steady climb to MacKinnon Pass, but the descent to the 3rd hut was endless.There just did not seem to be enough rest stops to get off the track for a break, either. It was a very long tiring day. For Day 4 we were on a time limit to make it to the ferry back to Milford Sound. Again, another long haul. Please wear long pants and socks at all times. I wore shorts and thongs/flip flops at day's end in the huts and despite insect repellant,  3 weeks later I still have unsightly sores all over my legs where the devilish sandflies attacked me and I could not resist scratching the bites."
248,Wonderful Time on the Milford Track,Not much to say that hasnt been said. Fantastic experience. We had 2 days of sun which is unheard of for this track. The Sutherland Falls waterfall detour is a MUSTWe used Fiordland Water Taxis and Easy Hikes for Transport and car relocation. Fantastic service. The car was waiting for us at Milford when we finished.
249,Fantastic!!!,"We booked well in advance and fortunately we had great weather.  The first and second days were easy for our group (which included a not so fit 56 year old) and the third day was as long and hard as predicted.  Still we walked all the detours, including Sutherland Falls as we had all day to do it and the only penalty was having to sleep in the top bunks.  The huts were clean, everyone is very friendly and the Hut rangers knowledgeable and helpful.  You do have to set off early on the last day to get to Sandfly Point on time.  We only had 2 hours of rain and the environment is green, the rivers clear, birds friendly, and the mountains majestic.  Travel light but have the right equipment  and the trip will be truly awesome."
250,A must for anyone able to walk the distance!,"Not too hard for beginners with a generally good level of fitness. Amazing views, kiwi classic.Make sure you suck it up and get behind the falls on day 3. Great fun."
251,Ultimate Hikes is Awarded an A+,"I've done an above average amount of hiking in various place with similar climate as this, but it was utterly breathtaking. We did the unguided walk and got to know a bunch of new folks from all around the world. The scenery was frequently changing from one beautiful view to another. Just when you think you had seen the most incredible waterfall ever, there would be another a few km down the trek. The down side was the Dumpling hut on our last night, it was leaking in multiple places and the layout was not as community building as the others. The fact that there was no dry wood to get a fire built that would help dry everyone's boots was also a bit disappointing. I had my young teenage son with me and he is already planning on how he can get back to do this again...I hope he'll bring me with him as I would do it again today. It was just beyond compare. We had weather from 23C to snowing on us going over the pass, to solid rain for all 6hrs of hiking- all of which made for spectacular waterfalls and a great adventure."
252,Bucket List This!!!,"The Milford Track starts at Glade Wharf and finishes at Sandfly Point in Milford Sound. The hike takes 4 days to complete, with each night spent at a pre-booked hut.  Along the way you will encounter suspension bridges, attractive beech forests, the Clinton River, Lake Mintaro, Mackinnon Pass, Pompolona ice field,  the Clinton Valley, Mintaro Hut, Dumpling Hut, Moraine Creek Bridge,  Roaring Burn River, Dudleigh Falls, Sutherland Falls, the Arthur River, MacKay Falls, Bell Rock, Posedon Creek, Lake Ada, Giant Gate Falls, and finally Sandfly Point which marks the end of the hike at over 33 miles (53.5 kilometers).  From there you board a boat which takes you to Milford Sound, one of the truly most beautiful places on earth.  The hike can be booked as a self guided option, but during the Summer / high season you would probably be better off using one of the numerous hiking companies to arrange your booking for the track and getting too and from the start and end points."
253,Breath-taking.,Even though we are NZers and used to our beautiful country we were blown away with the scenery on our 3 day guided walk. We chose the ensuite option at the lodges and found them extremely comfortable. The three course meals each evening were excellent as well as the selection of fillings for lunch plus a great breakfast. A reasonable level of fitness is needed as the track is quite rocky and climbing up McKinnon Pass on the second day was challenging-having two poles was a must!
254,Astounding!,Hi we were a party of 8 - we started track on wed 14 January finishing Saturday 17th.   We did the independent great walk option.  The walk was so great - scenery changed one day to next.  We had dry weather together with rain on some days which created beautiful waterfalls.  We had a windy and cold day walking over pass so pack plenty of warm gear just in case - dont miss Sutherland Falls - it a must see!  The huts are well catered for trampers.  We had a fantastic group of trampers of 40 with us.  Thank you to DOC for maintaining and providing such an amazing walk - I highly recommend putting it on your list of things you must do in your lifetime - p.s a camera was left in a black drybag at dumpling hut so if any of our trampers picked it up please let us know - my daughter really wants it back - thank you
255,Great independent walk,"Loved it from start to finish.  We had quite a lot of rain but that did not really matter, it made the waterfalls look even more spectacular.The whole trip was so well organised and our guides were fantastic.It is hard work though, so don't be fooled!A real once in a lifetime experience."
256,an unforgettable trip. NZ is the best place for travelling,"A fabulous option for a holiday for those active relaxers!! Scenery was incredible, well serviced DOC huts and met some fantastic people. Great to see lots of kiwis and their kids out there doing it!! Thank you Easy Hike for the trouble free car relocation. This made the end of the trip so much easier!!"
257,"Epic rain, epic experience with Ultimate Hikes","The walk is great. Be sure to book in advance. Try to keep of when most crowded. Do not forget to bring insect repellant, otherwise you will learn why the goal for the walk is called sandfly point."
258,Epic Adventure Hike -  in Beautiful New Zealand,We had a mix of weather with rain on the first and last day of walking which gave us some beautiful waterfalls in the valleys. The middle day over McKinnon pass was absolutely perfect. The sun shone and it was beautiful. I imagine that if the weather were terrible on the middle day then that might take away from the magnificence! The ultimate hikes guides were great. This was a once in a lifetime holiday for us so we went with the luxurious option of having our food and bedding supplied on the guided hike! Of course you could do it as an independent walker but that seemed very basic for us on this holiday. The food and the bar in the houses used by ultimate hikes were amazing. The beds were comfortable and the company was great.
259,Nature Always Inspires,"We've done the track twice, both with heavy rains and limited visibility.  We figured it just bad luck but we've learned otherwise since.Quotes from rangers & locals: ""I didn't see the view until my fifth or sixth time""; in response to someone who got good weather, ""you're one of the lucky few""; 'Dumpling hut is the third wettest spot in the world'.Both times the track was temporarily closed- once due to gale force winds over the mountain pass (plus sleet) and the second for trail flooding around 165 cm.  Walking through heavy rains for two days straight and limited visibility for more, including over the pass, occurred. Others had it worse around the time we went. It's not bad luck, it's typical. There is much beauty.  However, you don't have to do the track to see it. The drive to Milford will provide waterfall & forest views. A day hike up Routeburn from the Divide will provide great mountain views. We have done Routeburn with mixed weather (& enjoyed it).  Given that Routeburn is drier with better views, we'd recommend it over Milford."
260,Milford Track with Ultimate Hikes - the ultimate !,"Unless you really are a marathon runner AND an experienced camper I would strongly recommend the guided walk, which is costly but worth every cent. Being a 45-year-old woman with dodgy knees this was the only way I could achieve my ambition. The guided walk provides accommodation, meals, morning and afternoon tea, and fosters fabulous friendship and support within the group. Even with this support structure, the walk itself is no easy-going, especially when it rains (there is no IF). The pack weighs a tonne, your boots and socks are soaked and every step is tough but the stunning views and feeling of achievement at the end of each day is euphoric. The guides are wonderfully supportive, funny and full of information and work their butts off to keep the walkers happy. I had zero complaints, I enjoyed every day (although there were very definitely difficult stretches) and maybe - just maybe - will do it again one day. My best holiday ever!"
261,Best trek ever,"What a stunningly beautiful place. And definitely must be seen in the rain to appreciate it fully---it is wall-to-wall waterfalls then. The self-catered huts are very well-kept and comfortable. So nice not to have to pack a tent, mattress, or cook stove. Tip for hikers: it rains A LOT in this area. Consider buying a compact travel umbrella. Yes, we actually hiked a whole day with our umbrellas but when we got done we were dry and our packs were dry. Our boots were not---you have to hike through water whether you like it or not. Boots that will drain are a good idea as are thick wool socks. It is worth any possible discomfort though! Make sure not to miss the glow worms at the first hut..."
262,A highlight!,"Check out the official websites and make a bookingThe walk is great whether you are guided for the softies or self guided for the real hikers.  The scenery is amazing, the huts are great, the level of difficulty is medium i suppose.  Take some good wet weather gear, your friends, maybe a snifter of whiskey and a good camera.  Absolutely loved it and will be back soon to do more of the great hikes."
263,The wuss's Walk - one day sampler,"We completed the hike in 2009, so my review may be a little out of date. It is best to be like a Scout and ""Be prepared"" for the Milford Track. We trained for several months before the hike, and even then I was quite tired on the last day. My now husband and I completed the hike as Independent walkers, but often saw the lucky guided hikers out there with us. They got to have showers and hot chocolate, but also had to pay quite a large sum for the luxury.The first two days of the hike are fairly straight forward, following the river through the valley. The huts were pretty comfortable, but it was cold even in the middle of January.Day 3 is definitely the best day of the hike. This is when you hike up and up to McKinnon Pass and back down the other side. The view from the top is nothing short of breathtaking. We were extremely lucky to have perfect weather for the entire hike, and got to see the view from the top in all of it's glory. I could have stayed up there for ages, but it was a tad windy! We did the side trip to Sutherland Falls, the highest waterfall in NZ.The final day is the longest, and I felt it was the hardest, as we had the deadline of catching the ferry. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time! However, when you reach the end the feeling of dipping your toes in Milford Sound is sublime, and the sense of accomplishment make the whole thing worth it."
264,One of the best tracks in the world,"Expect a  challenge unless you are experienced waking in  nz alpine areas  a reasonable level of fitness required, will be on varied  track surfaces from smooth to rough boulders. Birds , bush , waterfalls , alpine scenery this track has it all. My party of over 55 year olds joined the maximum 40 independent walkers allowed each day and all enjoyed the challenge. Well worthwhile even with the last day in the rain . Preparation and knowledge of food and clothing to take essential to enjoyment . Do not worr6 about bus and boat times at the end of the track they are flexible and willing to accommodate your finish times . I suggest booking with track net bus company for the return trip to te Anau as they fit you on the bus that suits rather than having to wait around for the time you have booked"
265,Completed the Trek 22 November 2012,"The first three days went from sunny to cloudy, to a little drizzle and then the last day was was good solid rain all day. Meant we experienced different conditions with each one having it's own special appeal. Yes even the rain coming down the mountainside in torrents was spectacular. Walking all day in ankle deep water, sometimes above the knees was irrelevant as the views were extraordinary. The four guides were fantastic.Kelly, Masako, Moon and Lara ran things superbly. The scenery, the food, the accommodation, the organization made the whole experience really fantastic. Not a walk in the park but for averagely fit people it is not too hard. A must do experience."
266,What a trip!,"This is the main reason for my visist to NZ, and it was so beautiful. We were blessed with stunning weather while on the track especially the climb to mackinnon pass. (That was a little tough) totally worth it. If you are doing it in the season you are quite safe as there are rangers living at the huts that check to make sure everyone has arrived in the evenings. They also do a talk and prepare you for whats ahead and talk about the area. Whats better is the huts have mattresses to sleep on and gas stoves so you can leave that stuff at home and lighten your load. Also a fireplace to get warm in the evenings. Happy days, this was fantastic. You must do it :) but book way way way ahead, like 6 months."
267,Perhaps the finest hike in the world,"I planned to do Milford Track offseason. Things were a bit complicated since my friend was flying over from North Island, therefore we had no choice about date. Pushing our luck in terms of weather. Originally I have booked my boat with Tracknet. They have warned me that final decision will be made day before departure and also boat will not go unless it has 6 people on board. I have tried to organise more people meanwhile trying to ask Tracknet if they got new bookings. Everytime I have called them I felt like my existence was violating them. Worst half a minute of a day, they also hangout while I ask more questions.In the end they have cancelled boat since weather was not looking perfect and they didnt have enough people. They didnt give me any further advices, didnt inform me that Fjordland Water Taxi has a boat going on that day. I have called lovely lady from Fjordland Water Taxi just a day before boat departure, around 4.34PM, just after QT DOC office got closed. She was so keen to manage my booking and buy hut tickets for my friend from Te Anau DOC office which was still open. All the communcation was friendly and I felt like in New Zealand again.Weather was sweet as. And this track is not overrated, just try to do it offseason - mid October. If you have some experience, brain and good weather - you will allright."
268,A Rain Free Tramp on the Milford Track,"As a solo traveler and hiker, there was no way this outing could have been improved.The staff were helpful.  The organization has been in place long enough to get all the bugs worked out.Fjordland is a magnificent work of nature.  If the weather is rotten, it's still worth it but better be prepared for an epic journey!   The lodging is excellent considering the location and limitations of an (almost) wilderness experience.  Best to be in good condition physically if doing the Milford Track.  Alternatives include droppng into Milford Sound either by water, air or the soon to be overburdened highway. A tunnel through directly from Queenstown is being studies and may, in fact, be underway now."
269,Stunning Walk,"What a fantastic walk. This is one 5 day adventure that you really hope you will have rain while doing it. On our last day we had the rain, so we saw over 30 waterfalls. I kid you not!!!My wife has always wanted to walk the Milford. I have an extreme problem with heights. Swing bridges are a major problem and you can imagine what it was like walking up a track on the side of a mountain. Well, I not only did it, but when I look back, I even enjoyed it. The raw beauty of this part of the world is breath taking and has to be experienced. So suck-it-up those of you who have thought about it and put it off. This is a must and I'm so glad I did it. Now my wife is doing it again soon with her girl friends. Me, I'm going to enjoy the local wines, afterall, I've experienced My Everest, so don't have to do it again."
270,My Everest - November 2010,"This truck was stunning! We went at the end of March. Key thing- layer!!! You will add and you will peel off. We went from cold and rainy, to warmer, to really cold, windy, and snow, then to very warm. We got lucky though- no crazy heavy rains. This hike is not for everyone though. The second major day of hiking can be rough. If your knees aren’t the nest, this will prove to be a very big challenge. But I loved every minute of the hike!!!!"
271,Best Hike Ever,"Guided or unguided, the Milford Track offers an amazing array of scenery that is in my opinion unique. Comparing the two, the guided walk does provide the luxury of heated showers, individual rooms (for some), cooked meals and lightened packs - this grants the additional benefit of allowing its participants to truly appreciate the sights. On the other hand, the unguided walk (which was the option me and my team opted for), is a far more economical option, and if you have experience in outdoor camping, the trail should present no challenge to you at all. There were people who trekked with my team that were well below the level of what most would consider 'reasonably fit'. It may have taken them more effort to complete the trek, but they did just fine.The general tips regarding sandflies, etc. are well covered in the posts below, so just some more niche tips for future trekkers to consider:- snoring can reach levels where even earplugs won't save you. To keep the peace, you can drag your mattress to the cooking huts and sleep there instead (or get the snorers to do so). It is no less warm or less comfortable than sleeping in the actual sleeping huts, and you would probably get more freedom with not needing to tip-toe around if you want to go to the bathrooms in the middle of the night- before walking up to the Sutherland Falls (by the way, definitely make time for this detour), drop your packs at the room that Quinton Lodge (for guided walkers) charitably maintains for the unguided walkers. The room is well serviced with a water boiler, coffee and tea. - while gas stoves are provided, it was apparent that many people were uncomfortable with lighting them (note, there are no pilot lights). If that's the case, bring long matches. Otherwise, pack a lighter and be nimble with getting your hands out quickly to avoid burns- there is a surprisingly large number of toilets along the trail, use them whenever you can (and also, pack a roll of toilet paper, one roll per trekker!)- there is a charity box at the final hut where you can donate extra food for the needy who have not packed enough- for the final boat ride, most people rush for the open air seats at the back of the boat. Opt to stand in the front instead, that's where the best views are"
272,Milford Track Fiordland New Zealand,"Without a doubt one of the best experiences of my life.  If you're a fan of long distance hikes, this should be on your must-do list.  The hike itself is more challenging than I thought it would be.  The climb across McKinnon Pass is no slouch and the climb back down is fairly steep and rocky.  Constant rain means that the trail has its share of landslides and rockfall that you'll have to contend with.  That being said, it's a much easier route than a lot of the long distance trails in the States.  I went in February and didn't even bring a sleeping bag (only a sleeping bag liner).  The bunks are plenty warm with all the bodies in there (and a fireplace) and the mattresses are comfortable enough.  The one thing to be sure to bring is earplugs (if you're a light sleeper).  Just be aware that you'll be sleeping with 20 other people in a bunk.  Someone is bound to be a snorer."
273,A family trek,"Book advance and bring your own because only water and gas facility is available in the hut.It's a 4 days walk with backpack.But,except that,not that difficult."
274,One of the greatest walks in the world,"We didn't do the 4 day trek, hadn't planned and allowed the time, but on visiting the area realised this was something we should have made a part of our trip. The whole area is so beautiful and this would be an integral part of any trip to the south Island."
275,The Finest Walk in the World,"4 very tough days, but definitely worth it. Having never done this sort of walking before it was definitely an adventure, but very much worth it. Make sure you prepare for all weather possibilities. Take lots of insecticide! Take as little of everything as possible - you will regret having to carry unnecessary weight! Take as little food as possible - I took WAY too much! Make sure you take gatorade!"
276,A very beautiful part of the world.,"Before I went on this trip I was concerned that I wasn't fit enough. I am in my 50's and am moderately fit. I walk, play tennis, workout at the gym most days but I don't consider myself an avid hiker. We did the Ultimate Hikes guided version of this trip which was superb. I would say that if you hike often you will not find this hike difficult. If you are like me you will find it doable but not easy. Mostly I had sore muscles and feet at the end of the day (especially day two) but it was so worth a little discomfort. Day three is not flat despite what the map looks like. More of an undulating landscape. Some rock-falls you have to navigate and big fallen trees but that adds to the whole experience. It is amazing to think you get to see this place that is only accessible to those willing to go on foot. There are so few dramatic, gorgeous places left on the earth that are so well-protected. We feel so fortunate to have been able to go and that we are fit enough to do it."
277,Backpacking light - with epic scenery and brilliant trail,I did this with Ultimate Hikes so stayed in lodges along the way.  I also did this as a package with Routeburn Track right afterward -- following a nice boat ride on Milford Sound.  Wonderful all around!
278,Awesome Experience,"I must preface this by saying our guides were the best.  They were top notch pros who cared and who did an excellent job throughout.  What you don't know going in is the chances of it raining (but I mean pouring nonstop) most of the three days is higher than any other type of weather.  One of our guides had guided more than 100 trips and only seven had sunny days.  The facilities such as park lodges are excellent, meals quite fine, hot showers great, but it was still quite a tough three days.  You start off with a bus, a pleasant boat trip and then a gentle one hour hike.  Take a picture, get to meet your fellow 40 hikers.  The first day for us was fine.  10 miles, along river.  The next two were more or less hell. Pouring rain, hail.  10 miles, half of it up a steep mountain.  The second half through rushing water  over rocks and uneven terrain.  It felt hazardous.  The next day, constant pouring rain, hail.  Short breaks.  ""It's not a race....they kept saying but it was!""  You wanted to get it over with by all means.  Pretty but I doubt it's the prettiest walk (definitely not in the rain)."
279,Definetly a great hike but it will depend on the weather,"If you are thinking about doing the track, think no longer! :) Book it as soon as possible, as it can be full even a few months in advance. There are 2 options - the national one -  (website www.doc.govt.nz) - which you have to reserve way in advance, and the private option, which is expensive, but if the first one is full, you have no other way. The only good thing with the private tour is that you don't have to carry food with you, because they cook it for you.The track itself is amazing, nature changes every couple of hours and in my opinion it is the best track in NZ. We did the Routeburn track, Abel Tasman coast track, and lots of smaller, less known walks and they were all incredible, but Milford is still our favourite. The length of the track and the walking times are OK for all people with normal fitness, so don't worry about that. We had kids aged 10 walking with us as well as 60 years old travellers.We were lucky to have 5 days of pure sunshine, but it can get quite wet there. If the water is up to waist in some parts of the track, you keep walking, but if it gets higher, they come and get you with a helicopter and take you to the next hut (for free of course). If you take it as a once in a lifetime experience and an adventure to walk in such unspoiled nature, it doesn't really matter what the wheather is like. Enjoy the walk and the beautiful nature of NZ!"
280,A wonderful experience,"Not Easy, but well worth it.  Fantastic differing scenery.  Definitely a must do if you ever get the chance."
281,Amazing experience,"Our family of 5 with 3 teenagers just completed the walk.  The grandeur of the landscape and stunning mountains, waterfalls and native bush make this well worth the effort.  Queenstown is spectacular, but this area is on another level and being right amongst it means you get a more personal experience than the Milford Sound excursions.  However, it’s not for the light hearted, all of our family are tired and have sore legs and are recovering from blisters, although we were well prepared and anticipated these and managed them well on the walk so that they didn’t burden us to any great extent.  I would highly recommend this walk to anyone, but you need to be prepared and do your research because we got good weather and if you don’t things could be more unpleasant.  We went as independent walkers and enjoyed the challenge of taking our own packs.  The package tours are expensive and don’t seem to be the full challenge but each to their own if you want to pay for the pleasure, you still have to walk the same track and that is tough enough, with or without a pack etc."
282,"A new landscape each 2 hours,)","I could just write a long list of superlatives, but I have a limited vocabulary so I wouldn't do the Milford Track justice.The same could be said about photographs.If you have ever thought of going hiking/tramping/bushwalking, this is the place to do it.The only risk in doing this walk first - others will struggle to compete.It is everything the brochures, guide books, etc. make it out to be.I have done walks in several places around the world, and this is the best so far.You just have to do it!"
283,Harder than I thought it would be,"My wife and I and our two children, a 6 years old and a 10 years old completed the Track just before Christmas in 2016. In the absence of existing advice, I would like to reassure suitably equipped and experienced parents that the Milford Track is totally feasible for suitably well-prepared and experienced children, in good weather. On that note, the forecasts were very foreboding in the days before we started. Please keep an eye on them and be ready to bail at the last minute. Do not risk you or your children's safety. There was snow and hail forecast during the run-up to us starting the Track and the independent walkers who started the day before us had pretty awful weather. Day 2 we had quite a lot of rain, Day 3, the all important day, was beautiful, but Day 4 was absolutely awful. Our experienced children made light work of the distance and conditions but they were well-prepared. We live in an area where every walk is a steep walk and prior to the Milford, we all completed a 20km challenge. Stopping regularly, munching on energy bars and chocolate, are all ways in which you can help your little ones complete this fantastic walk. For the rain, factor in 3 layers of waterproof clothing. Gore-Tex just simply won't cut the mustard here, like it doesn't in the UK. A cheap thick NZ$10 poncho type coat that you can pick up in Queenstown, over the top of a Gore-Tex outer has much more of a chance, of keeping your children warm and dry. Fleeces and other man-made fibrous tops also provide back-up, underneath. Remember, people die in the mountains because of hypothermia. This is the number one risk to which you must pay attention at all time. The huts are basic and so are the wardens, so don't depend on them for your safety. You sense that if you were a flightless bird there would be more care taken, by the DOC but hey, this is New Zealand. Sadly, you are just a Second-class funding unit. The First-class ones being allowed to stay in the ""Guided walkers"" huts and facilities along the Track. Yes, folks, apartheid is alive and kicking in good old NZ! You will be familiar with sandflies before you start the walk but Avon So-Soft is the best way of repelling these awful creatures. Just make sure that you re-apply every time you feel that the rain has removed your initial coating. They are however quite large and visible unlike Scottish midges and South American puri-puri so aren't quite as bad as making you reach for a head net. The incredible sense of achievement that your children will get, is worth the hundreds of dollars that you will have to spend to get here and get a place, as an independent walker on the Track. Just don't take it lightly."
284,Awesome,"Having previously walked the Milford Track for the first time in November 2005, I knew exactly what to expect and once again I was not disappointed.This time I was part of a larger group of friends from Canberra Australia, and as we did in 2005 the Hike was booked through Ultimate Hikes in NZ.This is 5 star Hiking at it's best and as long as you are prepared for any type of weather and the likelihood of the attention of sandflies you have the opportunity to experience the magnificent beauty of this unspoilt Wilderness.The organisation of the Walk and the meals and accomodation was outstanding.We experienced all four Seasons on our Walk including heavy snow on the only really tough day as we traversed the Mackinnon Pass.The Friends you can meet from far and wide is another highlight and coupled with the Scenery and Wildlife can leave you with wonderful memories for the rest of your life.I cannot think of many places that might come close to this magnificent Walk.I recommend the Ultimate Hike's website if you are keen to participate in a Guided Walk."
285,Breathtaking,"Wow! Worth doing. If you are not sure about being up for it, spend a few days going on extended walks to train up. Only the second day is challenging with an 1100 metre climb. Be prepared for lots of rain, this is a Fiordland rainforest, but, on the up side, you get to enjoy hundreds of magnificent waterfalls."
286,Definitely the best walk in the world,"There's no need for me to repeat what many people have already said in their reviews.  This is truly one of the great walks of the world.  This was my 5th New Zealand Great Walk out of 9 and only the Routeburn can hold it's own against the Milford Track.  I will also add that the DOC rangers are amazing and tell great stories.So why only 4 stars?  The cost.  Even if you are self guided and use the DOC huts you're talking $140 for each of the 4 nights.  Then you need to get to Ta Anau Downs (minimum $70 if getting a bus from Queenstown but more likely over $100), pay $90 for the boat to Glade Wharf, pay $54 for the 5 mins (5 mins!!!) boat from Sandfly point to Milford Wharf and then get back to Queenstown (minimum $100).  All up you're looking at $800.  Is it worth that?  Yes.  Are there better value walks?  Absolutely.  Routeburn is way cheaper and in my opinion (I've done Routeburn twice) just as good.Would I get my money back and erase my memory of the walk if I could?  No way.  But for those who are price sensitive be warned."
287,What an experience,Fantastic experience. We were extremely lucky to experience no rain during the whole 4 days. Top of our 30 days NZ trip. Used car relocation service and everything worked well. Don't forget to book Milford far in advance (it's usually sold out in one day for the whole next season). Combined with Milford boat trip in the end (recommend to use small boat).
288,Truly awesome,"I'd been meaning to do this for over a decade; it had taken that long to book again after cancelling a previous trip. And not being a sporty person, I approached this with some trepidation. But doing the guided version makes it much easier, especially for someone with no experience of hikes or treks. You are looked after in every way, and the excellent guides inspired confidence that every problem would have a solution (and, in fact, even the serious problems were solved).The weather is a matter of luck; it just can't be predicted. We were outstandingly lucky, which made for very pleasant walking. It wasn't always dry; but almost all the rain was overnight, and it had got cold enough that it fell as snow on the peaks, looking spectacular when the cloud lifted in the morning and the sun came out.The company that does the guided hike is a very slick operation. Nothing is left to chance. The guides are knowledgeable and friendly in addition to being utterly competent and reliable. Follow all the advice given, and the walk will not be difficult (even though it is undoubtedly strenuous).Highly recommended."
289,A great hiking experience and pristine beauty.,"We had an extra day on the track, due to heavy rains.This was no problem whatsoever as it was beautiful with all the extra waterfalls. I could sit outside for hours, looking at nature at work! First day is an easy walk. Most 'difficult' part of the track is going over the Mackinnon pass. But the reward once you are up there is worth the effort.Should the weather be good when you arrive at the hut the day before ascending the Mackinnon pass and they predict bad weather for the next day, do no hesitate to go up the pass! You do not want to miss out on the view. You can do it without your heavy backpack as you can leave it behind, in the hut."
290,Oustanding track and amazing nature!,"If you are a novice at bushwalking and would like to learn a little along the way, try the Trips & Tramps guided walk at Milford Sound.  At 5.5km each way, this hike is generally quite flat and is over in around 3 hours.  We had Ross as our guide and he was friendly and expert on the New Zealand bush and history.  He kept a watch on the slower walkers in the group (never more than 12) whilst allowing us to stop to take in the scenery and take photos.This is suitable for all ages.  Most of the track from Sandfly Point is topped with gravel, but you may come across mud after rains.  All in all an excellent way to get out and experience nature and learn a little along the way."
291,"Amazing, mystical and wonderous","Actually, I visited here quite some time ago, but the format of the review requires me to say I was here in 2013 to post my review, so I did.  The place doesn't change every year, or perhaps ever.The Milford Track is 33.5 miles long from Te Anau Downs to Sandfly Point on Milford Sound.  Four days (""feet on the track NLT 08:00; feet off the track NLT 17:00""), and three night on the Track.  Total trekking time for someone not interested in the sights would average about four hours per day, so there is plenty of time for enjoying the sights, sounds, and scents of the Track.  You may walk with people of mutual choosing, or you may go it alone, which I did.  My tastes in things to stop and enjoy would naturally be different from those of other individuals, and I didn't want to be chatting mindlesly or trying to keep up with anybody; I was here to soak up this beautiful place. The Fiordland is exceptional in its lack of mammals to foul the streams (which are nonetheless tested very frequently), and there is nothing poisonous to bite you when you decide to plod through the lush flora to see something that interests you.I chose the very first trek of the season.  It would be a bit cold and wet, but this was the fiordland and a bona-fide fiordland experience contains some of each. Each day is different.  The first full day's trek (after spending the first night at the Glade House, a bunkhouse arrangement like the other lodging we were provided along the Track) follows the Clinton River, which provided our drinking water in this pristine place.  For much of the day, the crystal-clear Clinton ran deep, fast, and curiously silent.  Then, as the elevation commenced to increase just after mid-day tea at the Hirere Hut, the Clinton commenced to rumble on its decent from the snow-capped mountains ahead of us.  The night's lodging was at Pompono Hut.  Like each night, there was a well-prepared basic dinner, preceded and accompanied by some good NZ wine, and followed by some fun and games, literally.  One is likely to get rained on with some frequency on the Track.  With proper atire (list provided to each trekker well in advance), the rain is not unplesant.  Taps and Reveille at each night's hut are courtesy of the generator which unfailingly turns off all the lights (except a small battery-operated affair at the johns down the path) at 22:00 and turning them on again, right in our faces at 06:30.  We awoke to a chill and the sight of several of the small falls absolutely frozen.  A nice warm breakfast, some Braeburn apples, and other lunch items in our backpacks, and it was feet on the Track.Today, our next lodging was on the other side of McKinnon Pass, named for Quinten McKinnon, who discovered the passage we would trek.  The difficulty of this sefgment of the trek would be called ""moderate"" by most, and we had been cautioned to condition our climbing muscles.  We all made it, some ""puffin' and blowin'"", and one with our guide carrying her backpack and encouraging her.  She explained she had in fact trained for this segment, climbing some of the highest peaks in Florida.  She and her daughter were wonderful folks, as were nearly all the 27 trekkers, and certainly the guide, who accompanied me.McKinnon Pass put on its best face for us; a clear blue sky with patches of white.  Ollie, our guide told us how very fortunate we were in that respect.  Everyone hung out atop the pass for some time, each in their own time drifting over to the Quinten Hut, where Ollie had prepared tea and light snacks.  It was a warm, cheery place, and those who drifted in and out seemed to share my notion that we had that day achieved the high point in our quest for natural beauty.  Even the john had something beautiful to offer.  Called ""A Loo With A View"", and it was and did. Slowly, slowly down from McKinnon Pass's rocky slope (hiking stick was very handy) to the glades that would predominate the remainder of our trek.  We all arrived on schedule (meaning Ollie didn't have to come find us) at Quinten Lodge.  The fabled Sutherland Falls was visible at maybe one mile away from the Lodge.  I dumped my wet clothing in the drying room, redressed and hit the Sutherland trail.  It was roaring and beckoned my and many of my friends to come closer.  We could feel the spray from maybe 200 yards.The next morning, we set out for Sandfly Point (in early November, there was nary a sandfly at Sandfly Point), where I joined the early arrivals and awaited the later ones.  At about 15:00, we boarded some sort of vessel, toured the Sound for a while, then put into a harbor and walked to a hotel, our last night's lodging.It is no exageration to say that any person with a desire to see nature's amazing offerings hasn't completed their quest until and unless they come to the beautiful South Island of New Zealand and trekked the Milfort Track.  It obviously costs something to have those dry places to sleep, and the drying rooms to dry your clothes at day's end, and to have the nutritious meals, and the watchful and knowledgeable guide, but it is the best money a nature lover ever spent.  By the way, the Department of Conservation provides basic shelters for what are called ""Freedom Walkers"", who pay a modest fee to do all this on their own and lug their stuff in (and out).  We saw maybe 30 of those, predominantly college-age kids, along the trail during the three days."
292,EVERYONE SHOUD DO IT!,"We hiked in December 2019 where we experienced extreme weather conditions of high rainfall, hail and 100klm/hr winds going over the pass .The track is amazing, accommodation good with great drying room and food very good - more than enough.The guides worked very hard this trip due to the weather and thanks to Fumi, Kaz, Mitch and Faith we were in good hands.The trip down from the pass is very challenging due to it basically walking down a waterfall and you will need 2 poles to help with the descent. Only pack from the list and your pack won’t bother you.I would recommend the trip with Ultimate Hikes and rain hail or shine(and we had all of that) it is an unforgettable experience."
293,Most beautiful place in the world,"Fantastic guides- Hugo, Veronica, Sam and Kyohei- excellent people skills and caring . friendly and efficient. I was most impressed. The actual track was not particularly gruelling as with Ultimate Hikes you carry very little in your back pack so the climb up MacKinnon Pass is very manageable.The waterfalls and rivers etc is the most exceptional part of the track- I was fortunate to get to swim at the Giants Gate falls.Ultimate hikes is a luxurious way to tramp and has now spoilt me and husband for our usual DOC huts."
294,A day hike at Milford,Wow a great track views are great. Lots of rain but still worth every moment. Meet lots of great people being the oldest (69) in the party they made sure I was okay. Heavy rain over the pass heading down was the toughest but I made it. Would do it again.
295,Awesome,We were lucky enough to score a spot when someone else had canceled.  You can complete the trek comfortably within the 3 night stay at the huts. The Rangers are friendly and provide half hour chats to familiarise you with the walk ahead along with interesting commentary. The track will vary greatly depending on the weather - sou come well prepared for the extremes.  We were privileged to have two of our days with stunning blue sky perfect for passing the MacKinnon pass but were also well aware of the snow melt and potential for avalanches. November was an excellent month to take in the spring flowers and significant number of spectacular waterfalls.
296,Indenpendant trip was great,"Due to cancellation, I managed to book a place with three weeks to spare. I also found cheap fares coming from Australia to Queenstown, and so, after two years of wanting to walk this 'finest walk in the world', I finally arrived at the start of the 53.5km walk at Glade Wharf with about 20 other enthusiastic walkers.I regard the Milford Track my best walking experience. (I've done long distance walks through temperate and tropical forests in Australia and Borneo.) The views of majestic mountains, the tall waterfalls and cascades (highest waterfall in New Zealand at 580m), and the peaceful and pretty rivers, the comaradie of strangers who became friends, and comfort of the well maintained huts and shelters, were reasons to rate this experience hightly. I couldn't say if this was the finest walk in the world, but it must be close.If you're doing it - and you just must - try to walk a slow pace. Even though I'm a fast walker, I slowed down to enjoy what all my senses were absorbing - the sights and sounds mostly. I even plunged into icy cold water (but for just one second each time) and cleaned myself in cold water in washrooms in the huts. This was a great time to be taking pictures so as to remember the adventure. But some moments could only be captured in memories. I had lots."
297,Best thing we have ever done!,"One may not associate the word “Luxury” with Hiking.  However, for a novice trail hiker, that is precisely my experience with the recently completed Milford Track Walk with Ultimate Hikes New Zealand.Being one of my bucket list to do activity post retirement, I signed up with Ultimate Hikes back in January to secure my place due to the usual high demand.With very high expectation of what the Walk will deliver, I was not disappointed, even though the weather has not been kind in Day 2 of the walking section.The walk was expertly organised, with 4 experienced guides leading a group of 50.  Talking about experience, our lead guide has guided some 185 walks before.Luxury refers to the comfortable lodges being provided, where one can have a good hot shower after walk everyone.  We also enjoyed nice cooked breakfast and 3-course dinner every day, not to mention beer and wine that you can purchase.While we were greeted with heavy rain and strong wind in the McKinnon Pass climb and descent, which included walking through raging rising streams, it added to the overall experience of the Walk.  Making new friends, who also helped me to complete my walk is another highlight and bonus to this Walk.Overall, if one wants to experience the beautiful unspoiled Milford Track surroundings, joining the Ultimate Hikes is my recommended way to go, unless you are a very experienced hiker."
298,Walking the Milford Track with Utimate Hikes - fantastic!,"I did this Ultimate Hikes trek nearing 75 yrs of age with my two 50-ish daughters who romped it in.  Don't be mislead by reading the review that refers to this guided hike as the one for softies.  True, it is superbly supported by fantastic guides who walk with you and provide you with hot drinks en route just when you need reviving, by comfortable beds in huts, by hot showers at night and by wonderful 3-course meals; however, it is you who has to do the walking including demanding climbs and a particularly taxing descent. What needs to be said about this trek over and over again is the sheer beauty, the grandeur of the mountains & the huge trees and the delicate detail of the fiord land vegetation.  We were so fortunate to have great weather, including atmospheric sweeping clouds at the pass with only snatches of view and a performance by a group of alpine keas.  The colour of all the streams and waterfalls was breath-taking - glacial and pure - shades of blue and some dazzling greens."
299,Absolutely awesome!!,"As the list of reviews will attest the Track is brilliant, but it does come with two caveats.  One is the weather.  We were lucky and had 3.5 days of sun out of 4; and thus we had a brilliant time.  However that is not the norm, and unless you are prepared for it to rain three days out of four, you are taking a risk.The second caveat is the height of the climb across the 'pass'.  Don't underestimate it can be a tough climb.  My wife just barely coped but another woman in her 50's had to be lifted off by helicopter. So I suggest try a 500m climb or two and if you can't do that you will have trouble."
300,A fantastic experience,"The 33.5 mile hike was an incredibly beautiful and challenging experience.  Countless waterfalls, lush, exotic vegetation, and crystal clear streams.  The guided hike with Ultimate Hikes in Queenstown is highly recommended.  Their lodges along the trail are a welcome respite and a great place to dry out from what is likely to be a wet hike.  Well worth the money."
301,Milford Track:  Wonderful!,"Excellent 4 day hike (tramping)Went for self guided option. One word of warning. Bookings open May 1st for the spring / summer / Autumn.  They get booked really quick so don't waste any time and book as soon as you can after May 1st to avoid disappointment. The first day is relaxed and easy so you can book the Midday ferry. Only about 1.5 hours walking from the ferry to the first hut. Although it can be windy and cold on the ferry, so dress up for it. The second day is pretty flat but through beautiful scenery. The third day is the hardest day going up and over the Mackinnon pass. The last day is of much the same length to the third day mostly flat or down hill. Take your time and enjoy. We booked the 3pm ferry left the last hut at 0830 and arrived with plenty of time at a very leisurely pace. You can be sure that it will rain at some point on your hike as average rain fall is something like 240 days a year here. Ensure you have good waterproofs and good boots. Many others on our trip had merrell boots and said their feet got wet very quick and would look to get something more sturdy for next time. The hut wardens/Rangers were very friendly and helpful. They are very knowledgable if you want their help just ask them. Don't forget insect repellant although I'm not sure it really works on sand fly's. Really enjoyable trip very worth going all the way to New Zealand for. You don't get scenery like this anywhere else. You would be hard pushed to get lost on this track well defined and not a lot of options. Would we do it again? Definitely yes."
302,Walk of a lifetime,"If you're in any doubt of whether you want to do this, DO IT.  It was the most amazing 4 days - interesting walking, stunning scenery, and socialising with nice, like-minded people.  My friend and I were not experienced overnight hikers, and not particularly fit, and still completed the track with no real trouble. We had great weather on 3 of the 4 days - day 3 (McKinnon Pass) was more challenging, as it was raining, and there was also still a lot of snow on the Pass from an unseasonal weather spell a few days before, so I would not rate the track ""easy-moderate"" in those conditions.  There are some steep and narrow parts. I also sprained my ankle coming down the other side of the Pass, which made for a long and painful walk back to the hut that afternoon, but even so, the mountains, forests, waterfalls and streams are indescribable.  You'll never regret making the effort - book well in advance though!!"
303,I can say now: the best track of the World!,It was really worth travelling from the other side of the world to enjoy this beautiful area together with a big group of nice people. We had three days out of four with rain but it was still fantastic.
304,The Milford Track should be on every New Zealander's Bucket List.,"All of the positive reviews you read about this trek are not superfluous. This trek is simply unforgettable. If you want a walk that gives you the whole kit and caboodle of trekking, without too much strain - this is it. The track itself is very diverse. It's constantly changing vistas, and different walking environs never stop to stun. So many times we stopped and simply all said ""woooooow"". With only 40 people on your part of the trek at any one time, you also have this natural wonderland essentially to yourself. Mackinnon Pass is visually arresting. Some other tips? - Take strong insect repellent. The sand flies are everywhere, in parts. They only like you when you stop to walk, and the hutts are all safe havens. But life will be more pleasant with repellent. Possibly unbearable, without. - The Day 3 descent is long. Keep going (feels like ages) until you get to the bottom of the mountain. There is a hutt with coffee and tea. Walking sticks are only really needed for this day 3 descent. We didn't have any, but they may help. - Definitely go and have a look at the waterfall on Day 3. The largest in NZ. - Allow time on Day 4 to spend some time at the waterfall. It's about an hour walking from the boat. - Definitely take ear plugs. There are snorers, and they become the talk of the group. - Anything you don't eat, you have to carry out. So don't overpack. All rubbish has to get carried out. - Definitely take rain gear. - There is a swim hole every night, which is cold, but a brilliant shower. - There is loads of water along the route. So you don't need to carry too much. Just go and do it! You won't regret it."
305,Milford Track fully deserves it's iconic reputation,"If you're very lucky, this is what you will see and the view will be spectacular.  However, this part of the world gets a great deal of rain.  In fact, it's one of the wettest places on the planet.  However, even on a cloudy and rainy day, it's well worth the trip.  The views are still excellent."
306,An awesome experience both visually & physically,"A group of 12 of us - 4 adults, 6 16 year olds, a 14 year old and an 11 year old-walked the track 10- 13 January 2017. We were independent walkers wanting a more faithful hiking / tramping experience.Without a doubt, the most amazing experience for us all. But if we weren't prepared there could have been problems.We had great weather for day 1 and half of day 2. Drizzle and rain on second half day 2. Torrential downpours on night of day 2. Strong winds, rain, sleet and a little snow on day 3 (the day we did MacKinnon's Pass). Heavy rain and snow overnight day 3, and light rain for our final day.There is a fair chance that you may end up walking in up to waist deep water at some time on the trip. As a result , these are an absolute must have:* a water submersible pack liner for your dry clothes and sleeping bag.* pack cover,* good quality rain pants* Gore Tex rain jacket. We found that the effectiveness of our rain jackets were directly associated with cost. Buy cheap - get wet.*2 upper body dry layers per day excluding your rain jacket. Even without rain you will sweat your layers wet during the day.*Well walked in good quality boots with ankle support for the 1,000m drop on the 3rd day from MacKinnons Pass down to Dumpling Hut.*at least 80% DEET bug lotion / spray- sand flys are everywhere.*a basic level of fitness. Hitting the trail if overweight or out of form will result in a very unpleasant 4 days.* Only 1 water bottle needed. You can drink from the streams and regularly refill.It was as an incredible family experience which I cannot recommend more highly. If you are going to book make sure you know when booking opens - was May 9 in 2016 - and make sure you are online at the moment of opening. Track books out for the season very quickly.Enjoy!"
307,Amazing,"We started our hike on New Year's Eve - just in time for epic rain. 18 inches of rain in 24 hours! Ultimate Hikes took good care of us. The entire track was closed New Year's Day 2013, as was the road out of Milford Sound (due to snow!!), but the company chartered helicopters and moved all hikers from one lodge to the next (or past the closed road) with minimal fuss.  So, 10 fewer miles to hike (Glade House to Pompolona Lodge), but a free helicopter ride! More rain and lots of waterfalls the next day, and intermittent rain the next 2. The 4 guides took special care the next day as they moved us past the remaining hazards, requiring us to stay mostly together until the path ahead was clear. Slowing the pace and walking as a pack was frustrating for the faster hikers who were chomping at the bit to hike after a day of forced inactivity, and being pushed to keep up was no fun for the slower hikers among us (that would be me), but with 51 hikers and only 4 guides we all understood the necessity of keeping together past what had become slightly hazardous sections. The Ultimate Hikes' website gives a clear description of the trail and lodges and a helpful list of what to pack.  The only items I would add are (1) a WATERPROOF camera or camera bag - even if you are hiking in the summer (our iphone camera was not up to the task!), and (2) special blister bandages - l-o-n-g sections of the trail are rocky with tangled tree roots over the trail and your toes are going to take a pounding.  Even the best boots may leave you with blistered toes.  And buy and use the foot fleece that is available in their Queenstown headquarters and elsewhere in NZ, it really helps. Others reviewer on this site give good descriptions of the hike and the amenities - good facilities, good food, and good service. We wanted a once in a lifetime experience, and we certainly got that! We all had a fabulous time. (56 year old mom & dad with 3 20-something kids.) Don't be afraid of the rain - test your rain gear before you come and go for it!"
308,"One of the best hikes - in New Zealand, or anywhere","I was on a guided hike, so I had the benefit of a hot (usually) shower and bed waiting for me, and not having to carry my own food.  I work in an office, and come from a place that is flat, so there was only so much I could do to prepare for the hike.  I was tired at the end of each day, but not in severe pain, and mostly the problem was that the bottom of my feet hurt from the rocks even though I had good boots.  Definitely use hiking poles - you'll be glad you did - especially on the way down.  The trail changes drastically every few hours, which is part of what makes it such a great experience.  You hike in dense forest, which opens out into wetlands.  Then cross a river on a bouncy suspension bridge and observe beautiful crystal-clear water sparkling over rocks.  You spend a long time walking along the beautiful Clinton River (which is on your right... if it's ever on your left TURN AROUND you're going the wrong way!)  Scrubland, desolated avalanche paths, hidden lakes and ponds, areas of semi-flat prarie opening into beautiful mountain views.  Then the summit, with fog and wind and tough beautiful Mt. Cook lilies growing straight out of the rock.  And all on the same trail - truly amazing.  I had to force myself to put my camera away and walk or I would never make it to the end of the trail by dark.  As it was, I was the last one in every night from my group.TIPS:- Take every little marked side-excursion.  700 year old beech tree, wetlands, waterfalls, etc.  You will be glad you took the time to see them.- Use hiking poles.- Bring good rain gear in the spring, and some kind of waterproof bag for your camera.  I brought one and was glad, because it rained for 3 days straight.  - Drink the water from the river - tastes great!  Fill your water bottle every chance you get.- Don't skimp on bug spray.  Sandflies are the devil, and the bites itch for weeks.- Remember to look up from the trail.  It's easy to put your head down and just keep tramping - but then you miss all the incredible natural beauty!- Watch your stuff!  Pesky wekas stole a sandwich out of a lady's had from my group and then dragged a bag containing trash into the brush and we had to go fish it out.- Buy (and use) foot fleece and thick wool socks.  Pay attention to your feet and if you feel the burning that means a blister is coming, address it before it gets too bad.  At the end, you will have lovely memories, enjoy the Milford sound boat ride more than anything, and sleep like the dead.  And then you will want to go right back and do it again!"
309,The best thing to do in NZ!,"You can check out any of the other 90 reviews for a day by day breakdown of the track but below are some points and tips that i personally would have found useful before embarking that i found out only through doing the hike1- personally i found it MUCH easier then i expected. in total over the 3-4 days i only walked for 12 hours and pretty much cut the suggested times in half. i also do some photography work and those times included spending A LOT of time taking photos as i walked. That said i am only 30 and pretty fit, but there was everyone on my departure date from grand parents over 80 to kids well under 10. Most people used the allotted times and some of the older ones used slightly over the times but if you are young and moderately fit this is relatively easy walk2- the trail is soooo well maintained that for much of the walk you can push a wheelchair down it. over the pass and for parts of the last day it is harder work on your ankles but there is VERY little chance of getting lost and if you are careful you shouldn't twist your ankles. we came down the emergency route due to rain and that was much harder for the oldies, but still better maintained then many tracks i have down around the world3- RAIN!!!! it rains 8 days of 10 for the year, there is also snow, wind and sleet. If you do the track with no rain you almost cant say that you did the track, coz that is NOT NORMAL!!!! before you go and start packing you need to accept the fact that it will probably rain. Embrace it coz it great. i walked past dozens of grumpy and sad, miserable people on 2 of my 3 days while it was literally bucketing rain and honestly my cheeks hurt from smiling so much from jumping in puddles. if you go in expecting it, prepared for it with the right attitude for it then you will really enjoy it! and it makes amazing waterfalls everywhere4- there are gas cookers but no pots, pans, cutlery etc. the sleeping huts are comfy enough and have matresses but get a little cold at night, there are fireplaces that you can use to dry your clothes in the huts and after a heavy rainy day all 40 of us were generally able to dry out before the next day started5- food- firstly make sure that you pack at least one more days worth of food as sometimes weather means that you are stuck for an extra day or so, but otherwise, i wish i had of packed an extra kg and brought good food and not freeze dried meals.6- baggage size. myself and an irish girl i met on the track had the smallest bags by a very long way and i honestly think we were still the best prepared. i had a 40L bag weighing about 11kg including my high level camera (prob 9 without it)  and hers was smaller still. most people had 80L and above and well over 18kgs. but take special note of the next point7- many people got VERY VERY wet. bags got saturated, clothes, sleeping bags, food etc and many of them were therefore very uncomfortable. as long as you double bag everything, in small individual bags so if it leaks only 1-2 things get wet, then you will be fine. Make sure you have something dry and warm to change into at the huts and your day clothes and jackets will dry out by the fire. DO NOT WEAR DENIM! also a pair of flip flops are great for the huts coz you are not allowed to wear your boots inside. 8- other stuff- sand flies are evil so take good spray not the roll on stuff as you always miss spots. snoring in bunks rooms can be pretty loud. bathrooms always require walking outside, speaking of which, there are bathrooms every 3 mile or so along the track. take a book or a deck of cards for the night times. Merino shirts etc are extraordinary. they are slightly more expensive but you wont regret it. take lots of socks. i wear 2 pairs at once to stop blisters, a very thin light sock first and a thick warm hiking sock over that. given the rain we had it must work coz i was almost the only one NOT to get blisters and i spent most of my time jumping in the puddles.thats about it. enjoy! it is a great walk, def the most beautiful one i have done. dont be surprised if you dont get a view from the pass as most people dont but dont let that stop you from going coz it is amazing. i'm heading back next year with my parents to do it again!"
310,Does it get better than this?,"I have Coeliac disease, and require a gluten free diet so I am always apprehensive about travelling as I love to eat!We booked our guided walk  and they reassured me they would be able to cater for my gluten free and lactose free diet.They surpassed my expectations! I had three amazing three course meals in the lodges after walking all day - appetisers, entrees and mains of rack of lamb, salmon and chicken and roast potatoes. They altered the desserts to accomodate me with yummy sticky date pudding, pavlova and berries, and brownie with dairy free ice-cream . They had gluten free bread for my lunches and all the sandwich meats and condiments were gluten free.Just a couple of suggestions however, take your own muesli bars, own jelly beans as your own favourite snacks were well worth the effort of carrying them. I also took my gf weetbix as was unsure what they would have. They only had gf rice bubbles which are not sustaining enough for me. The soy milk wasn't gluten free and I almost drank it before asking them to check - it had barley in it and so the rice milk alternative was great.The actual hike was fantastic. They fail to advertise in the ads it rains for over 200 days of the year and it rained for us every day. However, I feel in retrospect that it made the walk more interesting (and of course challenging). Make sure you take everything they recommend as it was spot on for me down to the waterproof trousers and walking poles. I did train with long walks at home and felt comfortable with the hikes (I was able to walk three 10km walks on uneven ground with some stairs/hills with a 5kg back pack on).All the staff were professional and they made every effort in making our trip perfect - from the lodge staff, coach driver, and our four fantastic guides (Priscilla, Ella, Kaz and Shaun). The guides were incredible when we had to traverse waterfalls through torrential rain.I thoroughly recommend walking the track."
311,An incredible experience,"There were already severe rain warnings (300 - 500 mm of rain within 2 days) announced days in advance starting in the afternoon on the first walking day by metservice.com.  Once arrived at the visitor center, the guy told me, that everything will be save and I just should take enough food for extra days with me. However; I might walk in and most likely, I won't be able to do the whole hike and walk back out. Which sounds reasonable, but gave already a bad taste.  Around 10am on the first hiking day, they sent out a e-mail, that the track is closed and I can't go. They haven't even tried to call.  My initial plan was to go over Dore Pass, therefore I would have ended up in the first hut without the information getting to me. Furthermore you are standing there without an accommodation for the night.  It gives me the feeling, that it is all about the money and hope that the hikers are canceling it without getting a refund to get more on their bank account.  For that price, I would expect a more professional management and giving out information earlier, latest the evening before. And give the option of cancelling with severe weather conditions coming up.…"
