0,Nice place to visit.,"Safari park is a very nice place. The owners of the park consider is more as shelter for animals than a zoo. All animals we saw was in very good conditions, there are a nice view of Gelendzhik city from the top of mountain where you can get by cableway. The place worth a visit and will be interesting for apll ages."
1,lions and white bears are great!,"“Must see in Gelenzhik”If visiting the area, this is must do! Lots of animals and great views from 340m above the city! Only 1500rubles for the park asks the sky lift...worth the money!"
2,Excellent Zoo Safari Park,It was the best zoo ever!!in Greece we don't have something familiar and it was perfect experience for us !for sure you have to claim up the mountain by cable car!the best time is sunset of sun!
3,Must visit when in Glenzhik,"Excellent.It is one of the largest tourist attractions.The park houses a large array of wild and endangered animals including species from the continents of Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Australia."
4,fabulous tram ride up into the Caucuses Spectacular Views even thunder,"I escape visiting a zoo in Russian. If you have ever visited one, you understand me. But it was a real European zoo as if in Berlin.  And in some aspects even better. There were lifts to the mountain (unfortunately in the shape of benches but not cabins) to overview the whole zoo, mountain and the city down the mountain. The zoo has a lot of species of animals - polar bears, lions, tigers, bears, monkeys.  Some animals are from the circus and can show different plane tricks.2 museums and a special ground for looking around far away make the zoo a very enjoyble place for family visits"
5,The best zoo ever!,"we could see a lot of types of animals-brown and white bears,tigers,lions,monckeys,different birds e.t.c."
6,it was unexpectedly wonderful!,"We just spent a truly stellar day at the Safari Park. Walked to many exhibits of animals. Rode the tram up the steep Caucuses Mountains with spectacular views. Had great borscht, cold beet salad, and goulash at the restaurant at the top. I believe we heard thunder on the way up the mountains!! Earlier at breakfast we had seen live dolphins in the water outside our hotel! Tigers, lions, deer, giant owls, all manner of things to be seen. I am 66 and had no trouble walking quite a ways with my son's help.  Had a little rain but nothing to stop us."
