0,Unforgettable moments,All i have felt was great. Fantastic. So happy and highly recommended. All ride so amazing. Minions. Harry potter. Spiderman. Jaws. The Flying Dinosour is very best. All protocol for safety.. i love it very much. Oh ya.. i just knew.. that u cant use your tripod here..The location is near to station. Many thing to do here. Unforgettable moments.Its good if just solo traveller here.
1,They won't let you bring in water.,"Super rides and great placemaking with fake streets and sets that look great. Staff were very happy and helpful and additional shows took place across the park for free.Highly recommend the Harry Potter area, Jaws Ride and Jurassic Park rides.The only downside was most announcements and video introductions to the rides didn’t have English subtitles (I don’t recommend going into Backdraft because the whole thing is explained in Japanese! Unusual considering it is an American brand)Otherwise a highly recommended and fun day out, with affordable food options and a good selection of shops. Only big downside was no WiFi, not great for tourists who don’t have access to 4G and get bored in queues!"
2,Everyone was very Friendly,"Loved USJ... Amazing rides ... great food options ... super cleanToilets ... Lots of characters freely availableTo meet andTakePhotos . Wear the most comfortableShoesLots of walking ... The park is magical , the attention to detail is beyond perfection .. the rides are different fromThe other universals visited they seem longer and are more enjoyable .Only negative criticism is thatThe introductions to some rides like backdraft and the Minions is tooooo long before the rides start .. it seems like a delaying tactic to make it seem like u started the ride but its still another 10minutes  to the start of the ride and this is  AFTER you get intoThe ride ... i am not Not talking about the queues before you start the ride . But that said i LOVED the park loved the rides and willReturn ...loves the caramelPopcorn .Fast passes can be purchased with different options depending on which rides appeal to you ... worth it  although very expensive . Most rides have the option of single riders which move very fast and beat the queues."
3,"For our USA fans, they still have the JAWS ride","It could be much more exciting and fun if im with my family and friends! what i enjoyed most is the harry potter adventure, it was so magical!"
4,Loved Every Corner of USJ,"There are a lot of attraction and cafe. And there are really many people! But it was so awesome! The best time in the Japan! I think, you should go there. I recommend you it! Go for it!"
5,USJ is really fantastic!,"Great for family with kids, outing with friends or couples ..All good, except for it’s quite costly.Good late afternoons and stay till closing at 2130pm. Less people, shorter queues, and enjoy all the rides and games without the fuss"
6,So much fun,"I've had so much fun there and it's kinda fullfilling my dream! Love everything here, all the attractions, all the shows and nice staffs!"
7,"In between Hollywood and Orlando, but the lines are INSANE","Beats Singapore’s Studios by Miles. Top service, top rides! Just a great park! Recommended for all families with kids"
8,USJ is so much fun,Gosh the Japanese really know how to make people feel welcome! Everybody were smiling. Rides were cool. Food is expensive but really legit yummy! Loved everything!
9,The best theme park ever 🎢🎢🎢,We really enjoyed our time here! We rode the Fying Dinosaur and other rides - harry potter and other 4D rides. Hope we can come back!
10,Great to spend your day with family,I've visit disneyland and disney sea last with my family..and have a great time there..while universal from my personnal point of view is giving a different taste. Enter this park just loke you've been taken to the hollywood side since so many ride which related with the hollywood movies however the explanation is in japanese..Really have a great time here...
11,Very fun and i am enjoying all the attractive ride,"You would need 2 days to experience everything. Son particularly enjoyed the sesame street stuff and spiderman. The harry porter world was surreal. Highly recommend that one would reserve a time ticket to enter. Went in the morning without much fuss. However, come evening, was refused entry as we did not get the time ticket. The wand was not fully utilized. Till next time, expecto patronum..."
12,Very fun place!,A well organized theme park for parents and kids to have fun together. Minions and Hello Kitty are the most pop. one for girls and kids. Harry Potter castle and town view play an impressive expression to all guys. You can enjoy the whole day with families or friends on weekends or free time. Just try it.
13,Simply A Must,"The Harry Potter part is unbelievable! really well recreated, you can do magic! But for that you should buy a wand from the park.."
14,Did not get through a lot with our kids in wet weather. Ok visit.,"Awesome ride especially Harry Potter ride, dinasour ride and Hollywood Dream ride. I went there during Holloween and joined their Holloween party until 12am. So fun and awesomeness is on another level. Also being chased by Zombies is no joke. I screamed and laughed so hard while trying to rescue myself. The memories is unforgettable and it cheers me up whenever I feel down."
15,thank god we were able to go here before they closed down,We had an amazing day here. The absolute highlight was The Harry Potter village and ride which is just outstanding and worth the visit on it’s own. We arrived early and were able to get into the first 2 rides quite quickly (under 30 mins) but for the rest of the day the queues for the main rides at each village became really long (40-60 mins). We waited almost 2 hours to ride the Hollywood!!!! The express pass is too expensive. A suggestion to the park would be to extend the system of virtual queuing that is available in the children’s section to some of the other popular rides to alleviate queue times and allow visitors to spend more time (and money) in other attractions. For other guests I think avoid Saturdays if you can. Still fab though and we all loved it.
16,Great tour ,"Wasn't even on the 'maybe' list of things to do in Japan but so glad we went! Despite teaming with visitors the hospitality second to none! Haven't been to any similar but thought the attention to detail was second to none and as an adult there were a couple fantastic rides. We forked out for the express pass so not 100% sure whether standing in hour long cues would have rated such a positive review so def look at those if you can. If you are willing, the singles' cues are a great option for cutting time in the line if you are willing to go separately...HEAPS of movie trinkets to buy and loved my minion burger lol"
17,Surely this is the happiest place on earth! ,"The rides where great and the Spiderman ride is definitely good for anyone (adult or child ) great area for your kids and the Harry potter ride is a must do though make sure to pay extra for fast tracks on the jaws , Harry potter rides , Spiderman and jurrasic park because the queen's can get very long . The food is amazing serving western and Japanese food and definitely try the matcha ice cream but the best part is the parade but if you want to get to the subway station quicker and go to the gift shop miss out the last bit of the parade as it can get quite claustrophobic in the shop or subway.This is the best theme park ever and a must do for Osaka"
18,Just Like A Dream,"Veryy nice to be here and everyone's dream world .Feel crazy when met a snoopy, sesame street,driving Spiderman Race and Harry Potter"
19,Wizarding World of Harry Potter,"Got buy1free1 tickets from klook. My tips:1. Go on wed/thu. Check Japan school and national holidays, and sometimes sundays can be less crowded. For Crowd predictor, Google search plala gcap usj.2. Google usjinfo realtime (use chrome translate to english) to check waiting times, graph is especially useful!3. Run for the Harry Potter timed ticket first. If you're lucky like me timed tickets are not required for that day, then run straight for the most popular rides.4. Flying dinosaur is easily the best ride of the whole park. Hollywood dream forwards and backdrop are superb too.5. Hp forbidden journey has super long queues in the morning and noon, more than 2 hour queue, crowd dies down near evening and queue becomes 10 minutes long. Always check the graphs for queue times!6. Always use single rider lane whenever possible. Saves you massive amount of time and money.And that's how I was able to ride almost every attraction (Hollywood dream twice and forbidden journey thrice) with a normal usj ticket!"
20,SO MUCH FUN!!!,The rides are all great! Very exciting! But you need a lotof patience coz wait time on the line is minimum of 60-90mins per ride.
21,"You know, it has roller coasters...","love this amusement park!!!my family like to spend time in here...must try ride: minion , harry potter and flying dinosour...many souvenir shop and the stuff was very cute ..also for lunch and dinner at the cafe/ resto was good, the meals was delicious..."
22,So much FUN !,Pro’sLoved how most people dressed up. Good selection of attractions.Loved the zombie parade.ConsQueues.Food and drink a bit pricey but these places are always more expensive.
23,Awesome! No regrets with the 1.5 days tix,Was a fabulous day. Loved the Harry Potter ride- warm butter beer is delicious. The night light show was spectacular. The service was so friendly and helpful. So appreciated how great they do.
24,Cool looking park and attractions,"we did not expect USJ will be this good. the top 3 attractions for us are:  Spiderman, Terminator, and Harry Potter ride. the only complain is, a lot of shows are in Japanese, and they do not have English translation, difficult for foreigner to understand. Other than that, it was an amazing day in USJ"
25,Royal studio pass,"Great time but extremely crowded. Bought the fast track 4 for an extra £100pp (ouch !) as hate queues. But beware - worked well on H Potter - 20m instead of 1h20m. Big attraction was Flying Dinsaur, BUT... the fast track only was valid from 19.10pm, probably to keep us there all day ... turned away at 18.00 and 19.08 (!!) 15m to ride instead of 1h40m - fair improvement. The other two fast tracks were hardly worth it. Jaws was only 18m wait (single rider) and pretty much free for all entry into the massive Terminator theatre .... You pays your money you takes your choice ..."
26,Never too young!!!,The park is fantastic! Went on October 1st and they were ready with their halloween horror nights!  The Japanese staff in the venue is just fantastic!!!
27,Awesome day out,"OMG so worth it purchased tickets through Klook (no issues), I personally reckon rides are better than LA.The day we went no issues with crowds, I went as a single rider so no more than a ten minute wait. Absolutely loved Harry Potter World, try the Butterbeer."
28,So much fun!,"Visited Universal Studios Japan for 2 days and had a great time! It was my second time visiting the park and would love to go back if I ever get back out to Japan. They still have the classic Jaws ride and Waterworld show which has since been removed from the US parks!We enjoyed all three Cool Japan attractions while we visited; Neon genesis VS  Godzilla, Sailor moon and Attack on Titan. There was also various one piece merchandise scattered around the park! We visited in July and it was hot, the park has several cooling stations spray mist too cool people down as well as a water fight parade which we joined in, but warning you get soaked! We also sat in the splash zone during Waterworld and we got cooled off for sure!The night time parade was one of the best I have ever seen also! When the park opens head straight to The Flying Dinosaur, the coaster is incredible but  warning it is very forceful and intense, which is perfect for me! the queue for the ride builds up fast so it's best to go to it right away. DO NOT go straigh for Harry Potter world over the two days we visited I noticed that the queue for Harry Potter jumps right up as soon as the park opens but tends to get shorter around the afternoon. I guess most people head straight there and then do the rest of the park."
29,Energetic feel,"My favorite part of my experience is the Harry Potter ride experience.  but i think, every part that i visited i have enjoyed a lot.  i got back being a kid again hahaha.  Though you have to be hungry walking the entire area.  it is worth all your time."
30,"We went on WED and THURS (JAN 2020), very little crowd (and no Express Pass)",I love Universal studio especially the Harry potter castle. There’s are so much to do here and you can’t finish it in a day. If you want to enjoy your Osaka travel it’s a must to visit this place.
31,The staff were so friendly & happy ,"What more can I say...it's a magical place to be!  We were fortunate to come when there not too many people.  We didn't even have to line up for the Harry Potter area.  The attractions did not disappoint.  There were places where we could refresh ourselves from the heat, love those water mist sprayers.  Clean.  Super cheerful and attentive staff."
32,USJ trip,"This has something for everyone with rides, movies, shows and photo opportunities with celebrities. Harry Potter land is great but gets very crowded."
33,Fun Place For Everyone!,"Enjoyed a full days worth at the park. Rides were great fun even though they were narrated in Japanese. Waiting time for popular rides without fastpass was 90 to 100 minutes. Couldn't do it all but that was expected given the popularity and the sheer number of people present. Artwork, costumes and creativity was amazing with different themes spread across the amusement park. Staff on site were really friendly and cheerful all day long. My wife and I enjoyed our time there."
34,Fun Way To Spend New Year's!,"For me and my family this is the ultimate experience. Of course it is packed, but not 'Disney' packed. There are so many attractions in so many different parts of the park it is a non stop adventure. They even had a whole section for my 2 year old, then the other for the older kids as well. They have an all you can drink deal in restaurant which allows you to enjoy a cold beverage or a hot coffee at all times of the day while you are there. The shows are top notch, and they have so many the wait times are at a minimum. Highly recommended for any family looking to have an amazing time at a theme park in Japan."
35,"The Best of 3 Worlds - East, West and Magic!",We have been to universal studios in different cities but this one was just perfect.Staff is extremely and helpful.
36,Fabulous,"Excellent theme park, much enjoyed my time here. Being a theme park, F&B items are going to be a bit more expensive, but it is not outrageous. I spent 3800 JPY on lunch for 2. The rest are all on you, water dispensers are available throughout the park and resting areas are plentiful.Some tips:Be there early: We were at the park at 0735 which was 1 hour ahead of the park opening and there were already long queues with hundreds upon hundreds of people waiting. The gates opened earlier than expected at 0810 instead of 0830 however.Get an express pass: You will need it to avoid the crazy long queues. Queues can be extremely long at popular rides. I was a single rider on The Flying Dinosaur, entered the queue showing 35 minute wait and eventually waited slightly more than an hour. I finished the ride, looked at the queue board. Normal: 120 minutes. Single: 110 minutes. You can figure this yourself.Consider planning a rushed start where you're moving fast and running and hitting all the big attractions/rides before the crowd comes. Then tuning down into relaxed mode once you've cleared those rides. Refer to above express pass comment. This also works in favour if you already have an express pass because you will need to make choices on what rides do you want to use your express pass on. For example, we did the Harry potter ride using express pass. We had an option of using the express pass for Jaws which was the next area, but we queued for it instead as the queue was ""only"" 30 minutes and saved the pass for Terminator.Some ride review:The Harry Potter ride was excellent, but one tip, lean forward and rest on the shoulder rest. I thought I wanna sit back and relax but my view was partially blocked until I leaned forward and my ride became better. It is nevertheless an excellent ride. You will need to stow your baggage in the provided lockers.Terminator 2: 3DThis is definitely worth your time. 30 minutes of a sit-back-and-enjoy show.Spiderman 4kUpon reaching the end of the queue and seeing the ride, I asked myself: ""Is this recycled from Transformers?"" I didn't find this ride enjoyable not because the 3D glasses were constantly being knocked off my face from the movement and I had to hold on to it all the way, but it was really just bland for me. Transformers was much better  and I really think this Spiderman is recycled from Transformers but I could be wrong.I didn't do the Minion ride as our express pass was for a very late timing and my partner was very tired. So we left early. It's a great place to visit nevertheless albeit the expensive express pass."
37,Osaka USJ - shockingly poor value for money !,"I've been to USJ three time with my family already.  We just love this place!  It's so much fun.  Our favourites are Harry Potter, Jaws, Waterworld, Jurassic World, Terminator, Spiderman, and more.  Only downside of course are the long lines.  Getting fast pass is very expensive especially for a family of four.  So we put up with the waiting and can't always get in all the rides that we want to in a single day.  That's why we have been here 3 different times!"
38,"Great for families, be prepared to walk and have fun",i found this park to be one of the best universal parks that i have been too. If it is a hot day please take sun screen and plenty of Water as it was a hot day on the day i went and i got burnt. Please pace your day out and perhaps do the ride ride that you really want to do earlier in the day with less crowds as i went on a Saturday . As the day went on the park got busier . Find a cool place around 2.00 pm to sit and claim you space for the afternoon parade and just watch the world go past people were dressed up in costumes which made it fun to watch and the parade was interactive with the crowds and unlike a park that has a mouse were the staff forced people to sit down the staff here wanted the people to stand and get involved .  I was mad at myself for not seeing the evening parade as from what i have seen it is awesome but i had only one day here and i was tired and sunburned by 6.00pm when i left but maybe get there early do a while bunch of rides in the morning find a cool place to rest for a while and then do some more and rest so that you get to see the night parade.I want to come back here
39,Family Vacation,Took our 18 & 19 year old to see Harry Potter which they love. The queues were crazy an average wait of 1.5 to 2 hr wait to get into any ride so worth buying a express pass.
40,Amazing entertainment for all ages!,We made a day of Universal but my kids are only really interested in Harry Potter - unfortunately there are only 2 rides in this sector and the hippogriff ride was an incredibly short and disappointing ride for the amount of time one had to wait!  We had fast passes for the other one thank god and we enjoyed a few butter beers and spent all our money on wands etc. The rest of the place was OK I guess but not really for us and we found it very difficult to find any half edible food - I paid a ridiculous amount of money for 3 revolting cold burgers and chips and had to hustle for a table.  all in all the kids enjoyed the experience and now we never have to go again!!
41,number one must visit park,"Yes, it is busy and yes, it is expensive. However, we expected those things and went knowing just how busy it could be. We had bought the 4 ride Express pass so went knowing that we would do at least 4 rides and hopefully a couple more. We actually did a lot more - we made good use of the single rider queues - though actually ended up riding together much of the time with this - and we utilised our time between the express pass slots well. Early int he morning and later in the evening the queues were much lower - by 8:30pm the queue for Hogwarts was down to 20 minutes for example. We particularly enjoyed the Flying Dinosaur coaster!"
42,Nice to be here and feeling crazy,"We went to Universal on the last day of our Japan holiday and what a way to finish!! We had pre-booked our entrance tickets but also our fast-pass tickets noting that the fast pass tickets cost more than the park tickets themselves - but for me were totally worth it. Be reminded that if you choose to buy your fast pass tickets on the day, you will pay top wack as the prices fluctuate the closer you get to the date you want to go.....make sense?? Please carefully choose your fast pass ticket bundle - from memory, you can do bundles with 3, 4 or 7 rides. Unknowingly we selected all the top rides which was a bonus as the queue time for some of these rides (like the Flying Dinosaur) ended up being 120 mins!! Like Disney, the park itself was rammed - more so when we went as there was a Halloween special, with lots of people walking round in fancy dress. The rides are awesome. I have 3 boys (aged 13, 10 and 8) where our favorite rides were The Flying Dinosaur, Hollywood - The Ride, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey as well as the motion based 3D rides such as Spider-Man and Despicable Me. There are height restrictions on some of the roller coasters (I think min 132 cm) but my 8 year old was tall enough. We had lunch - quality was pretty good although grossly overpriced however loads of restaurants and outlets to choose from. We got to the park early and stayed for over 12 hours - yes we were knackered by the end of the day but was totally worth it! The park is well connected to the JR network with its own station which takes you back into the centre of Osaka so we had no trouble getting back to our hotel afterwards. For me, Universal was better than Disney in Tokyo, a fantastic place to have lots of fun with the kids!!"
43,Different style of amusement park,"Regardless of queuing which is normal for USJ, it's a happy moment and i did enjoy it a lot for my first time visiting."
44,Fun and Friendly Staff,I have visited the US Universal Studios many times and it was always a great visit.  Japan didn't disappoint.  A couple of surprises - Only one park - i have become used to two parks in Orlando.  i was able to get to everything i wanted in one day - it helped that i had the Express Pass - though it still limited the use to one per ride (another surprise).  Okay - last thought and i know i only speak English - some subtitles would have been greatly appreciated - many times i was watching a film or show that only had Japanese.  i believe it would be a lot more fun (and understandable) if i could have had some English.  By the way totally impressed with Guest Services as i watched them give people back items they lost - so much to enjoy and learn...
45,not great value for money,"We had a super fun day exploring the park, and found the staff so so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic. We treated ourselves to an express pass which was very expensive but it was nice to skip the queue on a few key rides. Not sure you’d need it In low season though."
46,Incredibly friendly staff!!,"BEST NIGHT EVER: Was a bit hesitant about USJ after Disneyland and the INSANE crowds....I’d read through some forums you can rock up and purchase a twilight ticket for use in the park after 3pm. We did this! Slightly cheaper, We skipped the insane heat, we skipped the crowds. Longest wait times for Minion Mayhem-and that was only 30 minutes. Jaws was a 20 minute wait, The Amazing Spider-Man was 20 minutes and the Jurassic Park ride, my partner walked straight in.If there is just one person riding, we’d definitely recommend the single rider queue. Come 7.30/8 you can pretty much walk straight on in. I’m surprised we got so many “popular” rides in, we had a sick time, and the Hogwarts Light show shouldn’t be missed!"
47,Lots of fun,So I was a typical ignorant American expecting the shows to be in English!  It was a wonderful experience.  Everyone was friendly and the grounds were very clean.
48,Mixed opinions,The theme park is fantastic the rides and shows are high tech . The Japanese staff in the venue are all highly trained and efficient. The best ride would be the Harry Potter as well as Despicable ME. Plenty of venues for food from a sit down venues for hot meals to quick snacks standing or finding a sit down space to have your snack.
49,Very good!!!,Weather is great here! Just in time for the Halloween night and almost everyone is “dressed to kill” or frighten you! An absolutely fantastic experience especially when we visit at this time. Getting here is quite a breeze just a total of 7 stops from Nippombashi station!
50,Extremely expensive for not a lot of rides,"The rides are awesome and mind blowing. It is not possible to cover all the rides in a day. Hence, try to extend for 2 days or buy express pass. So that you can explore all the rides and places. There is some height restriction for kids in few rides.If you are fine with exploring only important/famous activities, one day is enough with normal pass. Don't miss Harry potter and few other rides. Location is near Universal station which is covered in JR pass."
51,Didn’t need Express pass in witner,"We’re frequent visitors to the Hollywood and Orlando Universal Studios locations, and I would rank Osaka below Orlando and well above Hollywood. As is the case with everywhere in Japan, the Osaka universal studios is extremely clean. The rides are solid to great, with the highlights being Flying Dinosaur and the Hollywood Dream ride. As a huge theme park fan, I can say unequivocally that the Flying Dinosaur is one of my favorite rides of all time. The Hollywood Dream ride isn’t a majorly thrilling rollercoaster, though it’s definitely fun and a really smooth ride. Keep in mind, the lines for most rides are absolutely freaking ridiculous. There was a temporary VR Neon Genesis ride while we were there (it was mediocre, though I guess if you’re a fan of the cartoon then it would be cool), and the wait was almost four hours long. As such, I HIGHLY suggest getting an Express pass. Be aware that it’s different than the pass at Universal Studios Hollywood, as you’re only able to choose between several bundles of rides whose lines you can cut. That said, it’s absolutely worth it and pretty much required if you want to ride more than a few rides. (10/2018)"
52,Christmas at Hogwarts,"First time I've been to a Universal. The park is huge, the Harry Potter area is amazing and really nails the magical vibe of the series. The rides are overall more thrilling than Disneyland's, so while my wife and I enjoyed them a lot, my 5yo daughter cannot play many of them like Jaw, Spiderman, etc. Food is good too."
53,Christmas Day treat,The VR ride got me nauseaus!  Im getting to old for these type of rides.  There needs to be better warning about the possibility of getting very sick on that ride.
54,Good fun visit,"I love everything about USJ! The rides are awesome and thrilling, especially the Flying Dinosaur. An express pass may be pricey but definitely worth it."
55,Adventure,The staff is friendly and helpful and they organize the cues very well so if you are alone or by couples it doesn't take that long. The food isn't great but is a common thing in the theme parks. It would be cool if at least there would be English subtitles for the shows
56,Don't go during Holidays,well the flip side is we went on a weekday and still FACED LONG QUES! this explains the park in one line. the rides were fantastic and thrilling. far better than Disney land in Tokyo! we loved it but only took 1 day pass - if this is how a weekday is then please take 2 day pass else the rides are going to take min 2 hours for the turn and by 7pm the main attractions close. so its hard to fit all the fun parts in 1 day
57,Definitely get an express pass and visit in off oeak,"Very weird coming here as it is SO similar to the one in Hollywood, minus the studio tour of course! But the whole feel of the place, and many of the rides and attractions, are exactly the same. We went because a niece is performing in one of the live shows, but in fact had a good day all round! The shows are brilliant and the rides we went on were also excellent. But Hogwarts as an area was the best part of the day! It just looks and feels as you would imagine it would do. There are quite a few food options on the park; we had pizza for lunch, which was surprisingly good, and later on popped into the diner for drinks. Neither was ridiculously expensive given that you are in a theme park so are a captive clientele. Getting to USJ is pretty straightforward on the Osaka subway and local train line, with just a couple of minutes' walk, clearly signposted, when you leave the station."
58,Enjoyable - one of the better amusement parks,"(English couple from London) My partner and I are mid-twenties and from London. Having done Disneysea already we were in two minds to go here on a hot afternoon. We bought the Twilight pass at 3pm for 6,000Yen and managed to ride EVERY SINGLE RIDE in 6 hours!! It is ten times more magical than Disney here and you do not need Express Passes so no need to overspend. This was the perfect ending to our holiday. It doesn’t make a difference that everything was in Japanese, the rollercoasters were incredible. We rode in single passengers where possible. There was no queues in Harry Potter at all and we got straight on those rides at 20:30. Bring some snacks and you won’t have to spend a penny here! If you’re in any doubt, we hope this review convinces you to go for a fun afternoon."
59,Happiest Theme Park I’ve been to so far!,"One of the highlight of my Osaka Trip was a day spent at the USJ!!Love to see bigger Minions and Dinosaur live and alive! Harry Potter is a must to see specially at night.Everyone, please see the Universal Studios Japan..all picture worthy!"
60,Great and exciting holiday,"If I was rating just the park I would of given a 4 star but due to the staff all being fantastic it’s gone up to a 5 The actual park is not the biggest and several rides are very dated now and need changing eg .... Back draft ride ... I’m 40 and even I don’t remember when that film came out or what’s it was about .... apart from fire lol Terminator 2 ride was very slow and dragged , jaws classic ride can’t fault it , Spider-Man great , The pterodactyl ride in Jurassic Park was amazing and Harry Potter world didn’t disappoint The late night parade was good and great effects We went on Feb on a week day and the Qs were only half hr max so no issues there Would recommend for a day out lots of fun and the staff were all fantastic"
61,2nd time - Universal Studio,"Worthy a visit for all, solo, friends, couples, groups, family, a one day visit is enough for travelers, if I live around there I'll be visiting every while for excitement and adrenaline games. Most of the games are speedy trains with different types and scenes. Some of the games are unworthy the time spent on waiting. Waiting line are for too long during rush hours, less at late hours."
62,You must get in here and try all this.,Amazing experience. It sure made a good impression to Jans. The staff are friendly especially to kids. The facilities are well maintained. The food is great. We will definitely come back again.
63,Few food choices,"Being in this place makes me young & relax. My favorite characters are around for the ""meet & greet"".The feel of Christmas is still present, with Christmas songs still playing & Christmas trees are still around."
64,Good,"Finally, I made it here! I've longed wanted to bring my Harry Potter fanatic kids to this place and finally, we're here! 😍 We went to a lot of rides, entertainments but since there was no English map or guide, we might have missed on some.  Nevertheless, am so happy to have visited this place while I can still walk. 😊"
65,the best amusement park,"Very happy amazing place happiest place on earth but expensive. Went during Halloween. A lot of effort put in by amusement theme park workers.  Queues are long, but not unbearable. We used quick pass anyway which was very handy and definitely worth it."
66,It's fun,"I’ll never be able to write a bad review over a universal studio park. The park is crowded, not gonna lie, and the main roller coasters can take over 2 hours. I did not buy the express pass.. honestly what bothered me about it is that differently that I’m US, you have a specific time to ride the attraction and you can only do it once. The express pass is super expensive and I though it was totally absurd I had to schedule the time and only ride it once. Even not buying I was able to ride almost every main ride. The Ride and The flying dinosaur are amazing!"
67,Great experience!,We've been lucky enough to visit all Universals and whilst not to scale of Florida is still well worth visiting. Particularly well done is the forested walk to Harry Porter area - transformative as soon as you enter and helps create a real sense of being there. The area is better than LA but cannot match the two parts in Florida. Some great rides but couple were closed for maintenance
68,"Enjoyed End of Year 2019 Here, will come back given the chance","I usually stay away from Theme Parks so I did not expect to have as great a time as I did. Plan ahead. Figure out what you want to do and the order and how to tackle two hour lines. Do not miss the Harry Potter attraction!! Check out what special events are happening around the time of your visit. When we went they had a Summer Parade where everyone sprays everyone else with water and gets soaked, which was a really fun way to cool off! And don't forget to take a photo in front of the Universal Studios globe by the entrance!"
69,Theme park day,"We had no plans going to Universal Studios but ended up here, fun, loud and everyone gets dressed for the occasion."
70,New Year’s Countdown,"We had 3 kids under 9 youngest being 6mths. All the kids had fun, and there were so many things for them to do. Great rides for the older kids as well as those thrill seeking older ones. We didn't get to go on all the rides partly due to kids, but also due to some wait times, so if you are going best to go mid week (we went on a Monday) or get a fast pass, its basically the same cost as admission but if you only get to do it once, you wont want to be standing around in ques and miss shows etc. But the atmosphere there is buzzing, so you really get into it."
71,Great amusement park for every age,"The interenet gives you access to knowledge like never before and my kid is proof of this!    She saw one brochure at a travel show and from there it was Disney this, Unversal that.    We'd agreed to go to one of the major theme parks and although we would later stay between the two Disney parks in Tokyo, we had a preference for Universal Studios.   This visit may have been for our daughter, but we still had to deal with it and Universal appealed to both of us more.You'll find Universal Studios towards the Harbour,  a few stops down from Osaka station on the Yumesaki line.    The stop you want is actualy called Universal City and is not right on the park, but a short walk through numerous resturaunts, bars and hotels.   As we arrived, station staff were advising that visitors purchase return tickets immediately to avoid long queues.   Do this!   You won't regret it. The park entrance is an open plaza with ticket booth, entry and lockers to the left and the Universal globe and fountain to the right for selfies.   Another great tip here is that there are luggage lockers and toilets before the entry and there are also lockers once inside the park.    Use the ones inside the park as once you leave the park, there is no re-entry.   Seems a bit unfair but it's their park, thier rules.    Entry for two adults and one child cost us around AUD$300.   That includes standard rides in the regular queue.  In hindsight, we shoud have chosen the Priority line tickets, as queues were as long as 90 minutes for some attractions.    We also noted that some of those times were overstated, or the number of riders had reduced and the wait-time hadn't been changed.   We had entered the park around 2pm on a wet day and it was still really busy.   The park itself is broken up into serveral themed areas and you should make yourself aware of these with the park map or before you go.   Some of these may just not be of interest, such as the Americana area was not interesting to us.    The minions area was smashed with visitors and looong wait times and we nded up wandering to the Jurasic park area and onto the boat ride.   Queue time stated 45 mins but it took us about 28 mins and we got to the front of the boat.  Way cool!   BTW, buy the overpriced 400yen plastic poncho from the vending machine.   Those things served us for the whole day and were essential at the front of the boat!    This is a fun ride.   We did get stuck on one part for about 15 mins and a dinosaur peed in my ear, my daughter's favourite part of the ride, and it was really fun.   Just wish I knew where the camera was as the Japanese father next to us popped a dab at the right time and made a very cool photo souvenir!    As the lttle one was mostly too little for the really fun rides, we took her to snoopy land and the other kids areas.   Just beware that some of these shut down their kids rides at 4pm, leaving you with one grumpy kid.   But don't worry, there's plenty of other rides for them that are still going.   Even the waterworld attraction shut early.   For us, the best part was Harry Potter world.   By 4pm, queues are shrinking and so are the crowds so 20 mins or less is the average wait times we found.    Do the ride in Hogwarts, no I'm not going to spoil it, but just don't do the Butter Beer beforehand.   It tastes alright but that stuf comes back to haunt you!    I have to say that HP world make the visit for us.   It's well planned and executed and presents realistic worl at twilight.As we wandered towards the gate, I told the family I was going to do one decent scary coaster ride, with or without them.    That was the Flying Dinosaur ride.    I got on the car with three quite young Japanese guys I didn't know, we screamed and laughed our guts out, and got off to high-fives and the new found bortherhood of the Flying Dinosaur.   Brilliant!!It's hard to write about leaving as everything now had a dull taste to it.    Good thing we had already bouth our return tickets!   Now for a 39 min ride home to Kyoto...Basically, go a little later, buy your return train tickets when you arrive, buy the priority tickets, use the lockers indise the park and have fun.    When we tought about it, this was better entertainement value that a day at the Sydney Easter Show."
72,UNiversal Studio (US) Japan must include in your Osaka Visit,"I got to play in four attractions with waiting time range from 50 min. up to 2 hours. Harry Potter is a must and shouldn't be missed. Restaurant inside parks is filled with people so I only eat from small shop like turkey legs, hotdogs, and soda should do. There is no english guide provided, so recommend to print one yourself.If you can afford express pass, I recommend to buy one."
73,"Huge park, Harry Potter area is awesome","Absolutely fantastic day and a half spent at Universal Studios Osaka, Harry Potter Wizarding World. The activities with the Universal Studios wands is just magical."
74,"Huge park, fun rides","A day well-spent with family. We particularly enjoyed the Harry Potter experience, complete with butterbeer. The only downfall is a lack of good eateries and rest areas, particularly in the hot summer sun."
75,Fun for everyone,"The tour gave us efficient time to explore each location. Amazing tour guide, Levin was very informative and friendly, did a great job."
76,Huge fun park with great attractions!!!,"i have been there last week. since i purchased 1day unlimited pas and express pass, i can enjoy almost all the games. i manage to enter Harry Potter ride 2 times!! Value for money. guys, if u really want to try harry potter game, please go the ASAP, when the gate is open"
77,Catching up to Tokyo Disneyland,My experience in this park is better than the original Universal Studios in Hollywood. The waiting lines are not crazy and the rides are so worth it. My favorite is Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It's like you literally stepped into the movie!
78,最好玩的主題樂園,"I have visited Universal Studios a few times in Orlando and was very much looking forward to my trip to USJ. Firstly we got to the park really early to get our first fast pass. We already purchased our tickets so only had one queue to stand in. The queue was massive (this was supposed to be a less crowded day!). After standing in the queue for an hour just to get in, we rushed to get our first fast pass, we then went to Harry Potter ride. One hour in and all the fast passes were gone! The queue times were 170 minutes for almost all the rides. We decided to go on some of the less popular rides hoping the queues would abate but they did not. After a few hours we wanted to leave and come back later as it was really hot and it was very crowded but were told we could not return (this rule is just stupid!!) we ended giving up and leaving anyway. I was disappointed that you could not leave the park and come back later."
79,Harry Potter,"We really enjoyed our day and evening here. The staff were absolutely lovely, some of the warmest and more welcoming people in the world. They genuinely seem to be excited about visitors having a great day. Only complaint is the food and no passes out.  No outside food to be taken in and offerings inside the gate were disappointing. Would have enjoyed sushi/miso soup/Japanese food choices but the best we could find was pizza and burgers.  Very limited choices for vegetarians, and the poor vegans will be ordering hot chips. As we were staying on site, passes out would have been reasonable so we could grab umbrellas or sun hats etc, but they require you to buy another day pass to the park if you leave for any reason."
80,"Fun, fun, fun all the way!",Lots and lots of people. Book early and get to park early for best possible spot to view show. Getting to a restroom will be a challenge due to the heavy crowd.
81,Pricey but fun,"USJ has something for everyone. Harry potter world was exceptional, even for someone who has never seen a Harry Potter movie, such as myself. A few tips, pay extra and get a fast pass. And try the butter beer in Harry Potter Land"
82,Hot summer day at USJ,"Your Osaka trip is not complete if you not coming to amazing place. Great rides, great game and movie. The environment is just like the movie!!"
83,Great Family Entertainment ,"We bought our tickets online from Klook for Code A week and the tickets are emailed to us and we just printed the tickets directly. Do not resize the tix. QR code is scanned at entry. We arrived at 8.30am and park opened at 9.30am. We ran to Harry Potter for our 1st ride. I think it is better to do Flying Dinosaur as 1st ride and then go to Harry Potter for picture taking. You may ride Harry Potter after 7pm with no wait at all. On average, Flying Dino has a 100min wait. Maybe it is due to the fact that it was closed for 1-2 hrs in the late morning. All other rides were a wait of 15min to 30min. Minion is 45min but i think it was due to the silly introduction which I almost drifted off to wonderland. We didnt watch any show since it was in Japanese. In between we had more than 2hrs of rest for lunch and dinner and after 2nd ride of Harry Potter after 7pm, we had more than 2 hrs of free time for shopping! We did sit all rides. A family of 7 bought the 7 express passes and told us it was truly a waste of money as the wait wasn't long. However you may check if other weeks require express passes."
84,Universal Studios Osaka Harry Potter Wizarding World,Great place for kids and teens. The rides were fantastic although queue was long. But still enjoyable
85,Lots of fun rides,Beautiful park with great rides and attractions.Get the 2 day pass and a more relaxed visit.Research the popular rides and take them upon entrance.Arrive at 7am plus if possible to get the most out of your visit when the park opens.
86,It's Universal Studios - but in Japan!,"We have visited Universal Studios in Florida many times so it was slightly nostalgic to be visiting an almost identical layout in a foreign country. The newly opened Minions Park Area was brilliant much larger than that in the USA. We were there on what was classed as a quiet day so didnt bother with the express pass which can be very expensive. We managed most of the rides within 5-10 mins using the available single rider queues. Lines for Harry Potter and the larger coasters were in the 60 min range and due to a thunderstorm unfortunately these closed down for a period so we missed out doing these. You can choose to just do the Castle walkthrough for Harry Potter if you dont want to ride the Forbidden Journey. Jurassic Park, Spider Man, Jaws and Minions we all managed twice. I would highly recomment the WaterWorld stunt show too it was great to watch even if you didnt understand Japanese. Lots of dining options including Mels Diner although I would advise booking if you want any of the themed restuarants the queue for the Happiness Cafe was over an hour long at lunchtime. Lots of different merchandise to choose from too. Very easy transportation from the Centre of Osaka we took the Universal City Train to the station and it was literally a 5 min walk into City Walk and then the park. Great Day all round. Once you leave the park you cannot re-enter so I would advise eating beforehand as it can be pricy inside and then head to City Walk on your way home."
87,Alot of things to play,"Wonderful time, lots of fun and plenty to do for young children.  It got very crowded when we were there and we got separated but nevertheless, we still had lots of fun !  (there were 7 of us).  We didn't have enough time to take all the rides.  At least 50% of the rides, need to queue for 45mins or more.  We checked, it was not even the school holidays in japan.  So...  Suggest it is better to get a 2 days passToilets are spacious and very thoughtfully designed for parents with young children."
88,Excellent theme park!,"This Univeral was great. We loved the food, rides, shows and atmosphere. We would come back here again in the future."
89,A magical getaway ....,This is our 2nd time to this theme park.  The children had enjoyed themselves as usual.   The food sold by the sides stores were great!  I love their buns as always.  We had a scrumptious Italian lunch that day.
90,"A long, fun filled family day.",Such an amazing place to be! The Flying Dinosaur is a must when you're here. I hope I can go back again one day because the whole day here is just not enough!
91,A fun day at USJ,"I booked tickets prior to going to OSAKA which was a great help and relatively cheaper. I have a 3 year old that loves Jaws. So basically, that was the goal of the trip - the jaws ride. But then I also wanted to go to the Harry Potter castle and have some butterbeer. The day turned out great and we had more fun than we expected. Since, we were with a toddler, i didn't have too much expectations on the rides because we could not go on most of them with my son. But despite all that, we still had a great time. And will probably still go there if ever we're in OSAKA."
92,Good Code A Day without Express Pass,Went there on Monday. Booked tickets from the Klook app and got the special entry. Managed to go in 15 mins early than the others. my first ride was the Harry Potter ride! took a lot of pictures with less crowds in it. love the butter beer (Non alcoholic drink) will definitely go here again in the future!
93,Great visit for families ,"We made a bee line straight to the Harry Potter world. The beer butter is must try but it’s really sweet. Recommended to share a cup amongst a couple of people just for the experience.All rides in Harry Potter world are worth going for, we queue for less than 30min even without the express tickets."
94,One of the best theme parks in Asia,Do come early. Many people running at the start to get on the rides with shorter queues. You snooze you lose
95,Great place to start to a trip to Japan,"get an express pass to avoid waiting in queues harry potter ride amazing [hang on ]big crowds so pace yourself , see jaws ,jurrassic park,waterworld ,and the zombies walking at night"
96,Though packed but queue is fast moving ,"- all great experience, actually in comparison to US Singapore it seems more spacious and more well maintained - we enjoyed most the Minions, Hello Kitty & Harry Potter- it was Christmas season so it seems extra special as everywhere playing Christmas songs although it was chilling 🥶 cold"
97,Universal Studios,"It was not a sunny day. Even it was rain in the afternoon. But we were all happy. Every where we go there were long queues, so for us, one day still not enough :-) . For non Japanese like us, English language will very helpful."
98,My kids are still laughing,I dont know how to explain this place but this place is very crowded and I can not  enjoy or ride anything.So many people at this place and use many character as haloween season.Even I come from the opening this place but I can not ride anything because its long queing.
99,Muslim friendly food in USS Osaka,"We had fun. But it’s relatively small and oh by the way the shows are obviously in Japanese. So that leaves the rides and I have to say two of the roller coasters are outstanding. The waits are outside standingSo you know, it was fun."
100,"A small USJ park, crowded, business minded feeling",Overall the park was a pleasant visit. It had a combination of classic and new ride attractions. The roller coasters were the main highlight and were both thrilling and fun. As usual for amusement parks the wait times were hours long so an express pass at a much higher price may be the way to go to make waits less frustrating and exhausting. I would recommend this for all families visiting Osaka.
101,All is wow!,Provided whole day of fun for the whole family. It’s a shame that the Express Pass are more expensive than the actual entrance ticket.
102,Fun!,Very welcoming and friendly service from staff. We are happy with the Muslim friendly menu.Service is very prompt and food is delicious!
103,Great fun,"You start feeling the excitement and joyful expectation from the surrounding atmosphere, crowds even before arriving at the entrance to the studio, with the remarkable landmark of the Globe!  The designs and layouts of the theme parks truly astonish you - how magical the scenes in the movies of Harry Porter, Minion, Buzz of the Toy Story, and a few more can be presented so vividly with immersive experience!  Not only can you witness, touch the lively displays but you can also experience the heart-bitten extreme rides. Additionally, I was lucky enough to enjoy the night light show at Harry Porter Castle - surely one of the mega works of such shows I've ever seen. What a lifetime memory."
104,Fun for all the family,Loved the Harry potter ride but the place was crazy crowded. Lot of people in Harry potter costume gave it a even more appropriate feel. We somehow managed to do all the rides ones even with the crowd. Kids loved the Butter Beer (Harry potter drink). Would recommend reaching early in order to be able to do all rides. We were thinking about taking the express pass but didn't take it. The rides are all well managed and the crowd moves quickly.
105,Time to be a kid again!,"We had an extra day in Osaka and decided to visit Universal studios with our 7 year old. It is highly recommended to buy entrance tickets ahead of time (available here on trip advisor) and show up at least 30min before opening to take advantage of the first 30 min when waiting time is low. We bought the 4 ride express pass at the gate and while it saved us about 30 per ride on a rainy Monday in December I believe this is a must for weekend visitors during peak season. Harry Potter ride and experience was great and very impressive, we also enjoyed the minions and Spider-Man as well as the traditional roller coasters."
106,A great day out,"A theme park not exactly filled with fantasy, but very strong commercial elements. While all games are free once a passenger enters the park, it’s almost impossible to do more than 4 games in a whole day without paying big fortune to buy the fast passes. The park doesn’t have much newer facilities & is filled up extensively with souvenir shops & dining outlets. Experiences were not good even I have bought fast passes because some of games required pre-booking & no clear indication of when to queue for the pre-booked sessions."
107,Universal Studio,"Truly a delightful which would ignite all your childhood memories. Though entrance fee is truly high but the facilities of fun, games and movie sets are exceptional very good. Enjoy the games a lot while the Wizardry world of Harry potter was very good.Love this place a lot. Truly amazing but be prepared to spend a lot at this place! Awesome place!'"
108,Good fun,"With all the hype and people reviewing this place, I made sure to add this to my agenda while visiting Osaka. Even though the entrance ticket and express pass was quite pricey in my opinion I thought it was worth every penny. The studio definitely had a lot to offer and we basically stayed from morning till night (solid 11 hours).We visited USJ recently, towards the end of September. I can honestly point out that the vibe between daytime and nighttime varies greatly due to the Halloween theme it has provided. Even though we visited USJ on a Wendesday, the place was filled with people therefore express pass became a necessity item instead of a luxury therefore be sure to purchase the tickets while you book online through Klook (which was what I did). Given the duration we stayed, we had enough time to go on all the rides / performances we wanted to go at least once (except Minion Ride). Personally, the rides I enjoyed greatly was the Flying Dinosaur (av. 120mins wait) and The Harry Potter 4K ride (av. 100mins wait), not to be mistaken with Flight of the Hippogriff. (Both of which I used the express pass to go through).We were fortunate enough to enjoy a couple rides that were only available during the Halloween season therefore I would recommend checking their official website before hand to see which ones are available on that period. The one I couldn't enjoy was ""Biohazard™: The Extreme."" This experience provides a handful of tickets and can only be picked up by their entrance. I didn't do my homework and ultimately missed this opportunity. After 18:00 the venue became a lot more interesting. As soon as you hear the announcement that zombies / monsters / creatures will come out as a parade, the atmosphere was spectacular. All of a sudden, the environment became hauntingly entertaining. There were live performances that involved dancing, instrumental, singing and most entertaining of all, general interaction with the public. If you're looking to visit USJ, I highly recommend coming during the Halloween season!Last but not least, I will share some parade photos only since it is not always available."
109,Cute interior design for christmas,We went there as a family in golden week. It was very very crowded as expected but they somehow seem to have managed huge crowds superbly. We purchased express pass (which is very different from express pass in Disney).The queues for small kids rides was much less so we were able to attend lot of rides there. The big rides had lot of queues (more than 2 hours) so unless you have express it gets tough.This park is much more open than Disney so you don't feel that crowded. The eating options were also many here.
110,Timing is Everything,"We spent 2 days here and spent so much time in lines even with an express pass at a disgusting high price, trying to get issues sorted was not easy, food etc was also very expensive. The flying dinosaur ride was amazing as was Harry Potter."
111,Birthday visit! ,"First of all be sure it isn’t a rainy day. Avoid vacation, holiday Saturday Sunday..because you might wait longer then usually for most attractions .if you could stay in Osaka 4 or 5 days then I really strongly recommend to take time and please visit here"
112,"Good, but you need to pay attention for all","I visited Universal Studios and I was having a fun time.But in the Harry Potter section, the Hogwarts Train conductor was REALLy mean. We waited in a line to take a picture with him and when it was finally our turn, there was some random Japanese who cut the line.(I think she didn't know that there was a line)So after her we went to the guy(train conductor) and said that there was a line waiting. He looked straight at my friend's eye and said in such a mean tone 'There is no such thing as a line' when clearly people were waiting. And then he continued taking pictures with random people who were cutting the line. My experience at Universial Studios was great but the whole experience was brought down because of that train conductor."
113,Loved the Harry Potter ride,As good as the one in Singapore. The 3D/4D shows are nice.  Souvenirs and restaurants are a little overpriced. Do visit the shopping area beside USS as well. Hard rock Osaka is there.
114,Amazing trip!,"Best to go earlier in the morning to avoid the long lines of the rides. The Harry Potter is a must of course to visit. The line was a challenge,  for such a quick experience. Overall it was fun to go to USJ"
115,unforgetabble,"Great place to enjoy with family, lots to do great rides, the kids don't get bored. you will need the hole to get the most out of it."
116,Amazing Theme Park,"I have been to USJ for 3 times, and each time they changed some attractions which makes it very fun to go to.  However, was disappointed the last time I was there when I bought express pass to go to Lupin the 3rd, but the show / game was closed and they simply assigned me to any one of the old attractions that they have.  I mean this is really not a compensation if you were going to the park for that particular show / game... hope they can have some improvement in the future..."
117,Amazing,"After in depth research/reviews, we bought tickets on a Monday for 1.5 days. Voila! we managed to cover everything even though it was absolutely crowded. And Fyi, 95% of the language either spoken by the staff or ride/show related were all in Japanese.  Bits of Harry Potter were in English and oh thank God...”Sing” was in English and it was so much fun.  Some staff do understand and speak basic English though I must say all of them were really very polite and looked very happy doing their job so that was very welcoming.  But I must warn you guys about the intro to the Terminator attraction. The lady in red took too long, tried to get the crowd in the mood but it was 100% in Japanese so for us it came across as boring and never ending.  The rest of the attractions were just like any other Universal Studios...amazing. Butter beer was a nice surprise.  Toilets were pleasantly clean all day. There were different sized/priced storage lockers upfront which were convenient. If you’re planning to watch the final show, staff will go all out to keep the walkway/seating in check.  You’d have to sit within the road/garden site so head there earlier if you want a good spot. Only the Express pass will get you a seat on the platform. The final Parade took quite some time to finish but worth the time, it was magical. I found the merchandise quite pricy then again everything in Japan is quite pricy."
118,Fun for all!,"We were almost put off going by all the negative research we read about long queues, expensive food and strategizing, but we ended up having the best day! We went on a Thursday, which I highly recommend doing if you can. The queues to enter started to build up about an hour before opening and as people went in they were literally sprinting to get to the rides. Eventually everyone calmed down when they realised the average wait for a ride was about 30 minutes. We are huge Harry Potter fans and this zone was just magical; we spent four hours there and went on the Forbidden Journey three times over the course of the day as it was just so good! We had a lot of fun casting spells around the zone with the magical versions of the wands. The food was a bit pricey, but the portions and quality were good. It was a great day out, helped enormously by going on a quieter week day I imagine. So go have fun!"
119,Too many lines,At $800 (Australian) I expected more rides. We paid for the express pass 4 and in total used 11 rides / shows over 8 hours. A lot of the shows like Jaws and Backdraft were in Japanese so pretty much a waste of time. This was all the rides possible (other than very young kiddie rides) and included the Flying Dinosaur twice. We have kids aged 10 and 12. They loved it but we felt ripped off. The food  was outrageously priced - we spent $55 (!) on popcorn which included a plastic minion holder ($45 with popcorn plus one refill an extra $10) one ice cream sundae ($12) looked big enough for two to share but was a small cup inside a large bucket to trick you into thinking it had more in it. All in all left starving and feeling ripped off.
120,Very happy amazing place happiest place on earth but expensive,"We got the day and a half pass and only just got to see all we wanted during this crowd free virus affected period. I can’t ride because of injuries and can be pretty grumpy but the cheerfulness here is catching! I was waving to everyone before I even knew what I was doing and chatted to lots of lovely people in the well behaved queues. My family had an amazing time at this spotlessly clean, crazy organised fun park! Harry Potter fans will especially love the Wizarding World, the night illuminations this month were breathtaking. So glad I included this to balance out all the temple time I put my family through 😉"
121,Definitely a day trip worth !!! ,"Universal studio was very fun, i recommend you to come very early because there will be a lot of people. it was very fun, I recommend it."
122,A Must-go place in Osaka if you are a themepark lover!,This is the HUGE park with lots of rides that suitable for both young and old. Going to the park in the winter day has been just great compared to summer. Be prepared for the LONG Q for every ride. The Harry Potter colorful show is awesome.
123,Good experience in November,"Universal makes a great day out for families, couples or friends. Anyone who has been to the US versions will recognise a lot of the rides and attractions but that's where the similarities end. The park was predominately filled with Japanese people when we were there and the shows are all in Japanese, as are some of the rides. We didn't get a fast pass but were there at 7:15 for an 8:30 opening. As it happened, the park opened 15 mins early so we were one of the first in that weren't on the early access pass (total waste of money as they only got in 15mins ahead of us). We were able to make it to the Harry Potter attractions before the queues formed. Overall, we never waited longer than an hour for any ride and early in the day we got through the queues faster so got on some rides twice.Avoid Mel's diner for food. The burger is like plastic."
124,Amazing!!!,"I went there in the late Morning and i spent the whole day there as its fun. There are different sections for different ages like the harry potter rides , the minion rides etc."
125,Fun and laughter,"Went there with my 14 year old. Universal Studios offers a great experience if you are Harry Potter fan, Jurassic Park and Minions aficionados. I heard the crowds are crazy big so I bought an Express 4 ticket (wanted an express 7 but it was sold out one week before my visit date). I was there on a Sunday.Arrived at 9am and the park was already bustling. My daughter and I rushed to the flying dinosaur and the singles line had a 100mins waiting time. Normal line was 220mins long! But the ride was great lasting 2 and a half minutes.I had express passes for Jaws, jurassic Park, minions and Harry Potter. With passes, the wait time is about 15 to 20 minutes.Managed to get on the American dream ride. 2 hour wait. I guess its all in the fun of being together. I saw many groups of young adults dressed up in their favourite characters chatting and posing for photos. They didn't seem perturbed by the long wait.Food and drinks were expensive. Unless you bring your own, you'll be held captive to the long lines for expensive food. I bought a simple pizza for ¥3850! And it wasn't even very good.For teenagers, I would recommend the following ; the flying dinosaur, Jurassic Park, The American dream, Harry Potter world, the flight of the Hippogriff. If there's time, check out sing on tour, terminator.All in all, a good experience. But once for now is good enough"
126,Worth the visit (read this tips) ,We went because of the Harry Potter world. Did’t have to line anywhere to get a entrance ticket for the area. We ate at the three broom sticks... it was very plain and booring. Otherwise the HP area was amazing long lines for the rides. We only visited the castle inside didn’t go to any rides. Over all good experience visited all other areas of the park too. Every ride had a 1-2hour line.
127,My unforgettable....,I am in front of Universal Studio and my friend is denied entrance because I received only one ticket of the 2 tickets I bought. I thought it was normal and it was a 2 people ticket. Now he has to buy a new one.So I demand the refund of one of my two tickets
128,Winter Special is really special!,"USJ’s  tax refund service sucks.“For example”, the one who help you with this has no manner and patience at all.He will take away your receipts from your hand impatiently and keep tapping his fingers when you are trying to recognize which receipts are “available” to get refund.(it takes time cause you can’t read Japanese nor remember and distinguish precisely all the stuffs you’ve bought)Besides, never try to refund if you didn’t buy a lot above 5,000 yen. Cause the clerk will treat you as if you shouldn’t be there.It’s quite ironic that every other staffs from USJ is so polite that I even feel embarrassed, how come this tax refund service could be this awful?爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛爛"
129,Great fun day out!,"Osaka USJ - shockingly poor value for money !You will probably regret this.We regrettably paid for express 4 passes & express 7 had sold out 15 mins into opening time. But It was a complete waste (with a one-day studio pass) of over $500AUD! For 2 anyway. Let’s face it Japan is very crowded & due to this quite regimented. USJ has ineffective management & poor staff supervision, I saw none.The ride staff were actually quite rude often (I know right RUDE STAFF at a UNIVERSAL STUDIOS!) but it was far worse than just this, they were slow disengaged & unmotivated, this is totally unacceptable. I saw many groups of mostly young girl staff wandering around the park like they were guests, I mean with 70-120 min wait times for some rides & people queueing 30mins-45mins for a pretzel or churo…THIS IS SHOCKINGLY BAD!USJ STAFF: YOUR JOB IS TO SERVE THE GUESTS AS FAST & FRIENDLY AS YOU CAN! Or be sacked!I recommend Westerners to STAY AWAY! You won't like this. There is little value placed on your freedom here, it’s a real circus and not in a good way! park management obviously failing to put any reasonable limits on how many attendees they admit to the park.It was not a casual fun experience. It was like being marched around in a prison camp! All the above has a de-valuation effect in my opinion, damaging the historically great entertainment based name of Universal Studios USA The food in the outlets, which could have saved them, absolutely did not! We had a burger at Mels Diner early before lunch - why would an attraction making such huge profits skimp on the food – This was nothing like what you might get at a real American diner. We turned to Alcohol (Extortion like prices) to cover up how we were feeling about how bad this was.I recommend to Universal Studios America to undertake an assessment here, it’s no good if a foreign operator is wrecking your brand! Maybe bring is a consultant from the Singapore USS. I’ve been to all the Disney Parks in Japan multiple times & recommend you choose Disneyland & Disneysea Tokyo Bay – its far superior to this atrocious greedy wrecking ball to western values.There is nothing fun about this claustrophobic regimented experience. UGH!Date of experience: January 2020"
130,"Lovely, clean grounds and cute merchandise!
(Skip the Christmas Crystal show)",We did not purchase the express pass like we did in USS. The que 1 hour before opening was massive. I thought we were going to stay in line for hours for the ride.As soon as the gate open we were runninh to Harry potter forbidden Journey. There wasn't any timed entry and the que was only 15 minutes long. We did the ride twice then flight hippogriff. Bought some butterbeer and pictures and we are off to despicable me. The que was not bad.30 mins perhaps and we were done with the wishlist attractions including spiderman by 7 pm. We went on weekdays. The closing parade was awesome.
131,USJ Tips for families,our first time ever at a universal studio and it was unreal.  went to harry potter world and walked and soaked up all the sights.  hard to see it all in one day thats for sure.  love to go when it was a bit cooler as it was a bit hot and humid for us at that time of the year.
132,Fun and well maintained park,"The weather that day was raining consistently and we are unable to do much activities. The rides are much more fun that the ones in Universal Studios Singapore. The food and souvenirs are cute but expensive. It would have been better if there was English speaking personnel at the various counters. Overall, it was a very fun experience we had even though it was raining."
133,Express pass ain’t worth it,"Having visited a couple other Universal Studios, I was a bit worried that this experience would be same old same old but it was not! We visited during Cool Japan and had so much fun. There are lots of adorable merchandise to browse and buy and the rides are a little more intense as compared to those in the United States. Sure everything is in Japanese but we already expected that. You can read the 'ride sypnosis' on USJ's website before going if it bothers you.Tip: Get in line for the Attack on Titans 4D ride when the park opens. It's worth the wait and so popular they close the ride after lunch time. It was hands down the best ride in the park."
134,A fun day! ,"I really like this theme park, you can many young and elderly here. Service is good and staffs are very friendly and cheerful.By your round trip train tickets before to avoid long queue.There are lugguage storages and regular lockers inside the park. Use the one inside is recommended.If money is not your concern or if you  only have limited time to stay inside the park, get priority tickets instead as queuing time can be over 1 hour. But they let elderly and handicapped people to go first without getting priority tickets.Read the time table of performance to avoid disappointment. They have light parade which you should f miss.We had fun here and we will back if we come to Osaka again."
135,Full day of fun,"I wished we'd known how much fun all the rides and shows would be! We were there from 9am until my old feet gave up at 7:30pm! Still didn't see it all! It was a rainy Tuesday...who knew queues would still be up to 70minutes wait! But... some were so much fun! We had to do them twice! Highly recommend the Harry Potter ride! Avoid eating at Finnegan's, both our parties stopped there and were disappointed in the food served. Drinks and services prompt...but, food wasn't up to Irish pub fare. Don't let the food stop your fun! If you had young people, get a two day pass! To really get your money's worth! People watching was so much fun too as Japanese folk, dressed up, wore matching outfits, adults wearing ear headbands, and corny gear...but so cute to see! (Toilets everywhere, excellently cleaned and available!)Don't let a little rain stop you having fun as there's lots of undercover places and things to see and do indoors. Here's some people watching...happy snaps."
136,Far too busy - yet they carried on letting people in,We bought our tickets and express pass 7 on klook and enjoyed a day of hassle-free and queue-skipping rides! The express pass allowed us to zip through the 60-130 min queues for the valid attractions! One tip is to use the express pass for Hollywood Dream -The Ride instead of Backdraft as Backdraft accomodates a large number of people in one go! We were able to take most major and popular rides before the night even hit! Get the express pass if you can!
137,A must visit ,"A great day out, lots of unique things you never seen in USA parks like Sesame Street, Peanuts & Hello Kitty"
138,Fantastic Day at  Universal,I had a lot of fun here. Although some shows were hard to follow as they were in Japanese (as can be expected) I purchased the express pass which included 4 rides. I went on a Tuesday and probably the only ride that helped having the express was the Flying Dinosaur ride. Most others it only took a max of 15 mins to get through. So it probably wasn’t worth the extra $$.
139,Day trip to Universal Studio Japan in Osaka,"I stay away from themeparks because it's always crowded and almost the same in every country. But USJ has something different with other theme parks.Recommended attractions at USJ 1.Wizarding World of Harry Potter Some interested here Harry Potter and The Forbidden Journey, Flight of the Hippogriff, Wand Magic, and Hogwarts Express Photo2. Despicable Me Minion Mayhem3. Hollywood Dream Ride4. Flying Dinosaur5. The Amazing Adventure Spiderman6. The JawsIt's better to buy ticket online.  Avoid buying tickets on the spot because long queues for buying tickets and queue again to enter.  Double jackpot!If you only have limited time, can buy Universal Express Pass tickets which is super expensive. With this ticket a special queue line will be available.Access to USJ with JR Osaka Loop Line stops at Nishikujo Station and then go with JR Yumisaki Line about 5 minutes to Universal City Station."
140,Very well organized,"Been to Universal studio in the Month of Aug, it was raining and climate was pleasant.Expect your bag to be frisked at the entrance due security reasons and you are not supposed to carry outside food. However there are plenty of staff and all carrying broad broad smile.  Within no time you will find yourself inside the park.It will be highly recommended to go for fast track pass unless you are willing to be in queue for minimum of 30+ plus minutes for many of the rides. I been there on weekend and expect the same on weekends and public holidays.Rides are great but many of the shows that you get to see are purely in Japanese language.Food is no big deal and there are plenty of joints. For those seeking veg food only veg pizza is available in certain joints.Stay in the park till the end and your visit is incomplete till you witness bright, colourfull  wonderful, Parade towards the park closing hours."
141,What a fun day,"We are not Harry Potter's fans, but we really enjoyed ""Harry potter and the Forbidden Journey"", this is now our #1 ride....The other ride, ""The Flying Dinosaur"" Lol... at some point, we thought we are going to black out...The third ""flying experience"" would be ""The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man""... Fun!!! Great day out!"
142,Universal Studios,"We loved this place. We could ride many attractions. We had express 4 pass but we could not use 2 of them. Eventhough entrance and express tickets are expensive, it worth. Espesially we really loved Harry Potter theme. My two kids had magic wand and used in designated spot for many times. Imagination became true in Universal studio. We want to try Florida's if we have chance."
143,Nice 1.5 day pass,"Our 11 and 8 year olds picked this cos of Harry Porter and it was worth it.  I personally am not a roller coaster fan but by the end of the one day, I must admit it was lots of fun.  Plenty of screams and adventures and would advise the purchase of express pass unless you have lots of time to sit in the queues"
144,One of the best amusement park I’ve been so far!,"I am proud to say I am happy I put visiting USJ as the activity for my first day in OSAKA. I bought the tickets online and got an e-ticket form (which ease me from printing and folding papers in my bag). My sister and I arrived in front of the gate by 08.50 using JR Haruka Limitted Express. (you can buy the JR 5 days pass in Klook with a good deal, i'll write about this in another page) Anyways, the queue was long for a low season day. (FRI 10 jan 2020) but we managed to get through the security bag check after 20 minutes. Visitors are not allowed to bring selfie sticks, they were asked to keep them in a locker. Once inside, we directly ran to the WWOHP. Oh yeah make sure you wear comfortable shoes for many walks. The WWOHP is less crowded in the morning and since we did not buy the express pass or Harry potter timed ticket pass (we just have the regular ticket and with great planning it is more than enough). We rushed to queue for the Forbidden Journey ride! Lucky us we only queue for 45 mins! This ride is a must, though we've played this in Hollywood, we play it one more time in Japan. Then after the ride, we took pictures and drink the famous butter beer. Japan offers hot butterbeer during cold seasons and this tastes better! When the visitors flooded the WWOHP area, we moved to Amityville and ride the one and only Jaws experience in Japan! This is fun even though we had no idea of the Japanese drama. Then we had lunch at Three broomsticks around 11.45 and it's starting to get full, but we found a nice spot outside. Lunch was magical with the Hogwarts Castle view. I got a nice shot from the outdoor area. Then to digest our food, we do the Harry Potter castle walk. Afterwards, we queue for the (must ride) Pterodactyls in the Jurasic world. Then there's the amazing spiderman ride which is suitable for all age. We skipped all of the shows for we've seen a lot of them in the other Universal Studios. Sadly one of the big ride (the one rollercoaster which were pulled backwards) were under maintenance and we cannot ride it. We did not wait for the parade at night, for we have another itinerary waiting, but by 16.00 we've bought our last souvenirs and say goodbye to USJ. Skipped minion and all the shows for kids. We took a lot of pictures and enjoyed more of the vibes there! The regular tickets works best when you planned everything well. See you another day USJ! Meet sanrio characters and other famous characters  Gotta say Japan has a lot of characters posing for pictures. We met all of elmo's friends, minions and gru, and of course Hello kitty and marilyn monroe.The employees are super nice and kind, they won't hesitate taking pics for you! Visit Olivander's wand shop in the morning, before the lines are long. There's a lot of restaurants and cafes in front of the gate. Just outside the train station and before the USJ main gate. If you use JR pass, stop at Universal City station, once you get off just walk to the left and voila you're there!"
145,Amazing!,"This provided a pretty good atmosphere. Some of the big rides here in Jurassic Park were great, not available at the Universal in Hollywood. However the mechanics of the characters/graphics could be better as they didn’t seem as realistic as the ones in Hollywood. Nonetheless the staff were all happy and cheerful. Some of the shows could have been better."
146,"One Tourist's take on Universal Studios, Japan",Overpriced and boring rides which are not worth queuing over an hour for. Harry Potter World was big a disappointment too.  I do not recommend!
147,Good day out,Very good. We are planning to go for the second time in this japan trip. Trust me this is worth the money and time!
148,"Great experiences, can't finish in a day.","The first thing caught my eyes is the crystal festival. The field of Harry Potter is indeed sensational. But what impression last in my mind is the sense of humour that staffs have - little baby dinosaur in his unique babyseat and it's ""alive"" like his mum .......l mean ""vivid""! Very creative! Highly recommended!"
149,Express pass is a must but pass expensive ,"The day we visited was very hot, pleased we bought the studio passes, which saved on a lot of queuing.The only queue it didn’t work on was the Sing performance The best ride we thought was the flying dinosaur"
150,Pretty good but graphics could be better,The theme park seemed dated with attractions from movies now quite a few years old. The express pass was over priced for what you get out of it.
151,Traumatic Experience,"I went there to hang out with some friends and because it is very famous.Some 4D movies (we saw ~2 of them) and a water live show were really good; I bought a basic adult ticket for 9000¥ (10000¥/90€, including transport to get there) which I find it very expensive though: long queueing times, everything (except fairground attractions included in ticket and the toilets) lead to spend more money: not just toys or food but practical things I would have expected to be free, eg. I had to charge my phone (my mistake). For that I had to go to some machines that make you pay, and that were not easy to find. charging it to 40% cost me 600¥ (6€).But for those who like theme parks like this, a simple tip. Worth going when it’s raining because there are fewer people and queuing time is much shorter."
152,it’s our first time here!,"My friends and I planned to get express pass to go on the rides but apparently you choose which one and what time and can only go once. They had one that was 7 rides express and costs nearly double the entry price. In LA, you can get an express pass and use it unlimited. We chose not to get the express pass and just follow the crowd but we had the plan by going in the single riders line which cut the time but made my friends and I seperate which wasn’t an issue for us. Also it wasn’t overly busy as the lines were pretty good."
153,Nice USJ!,"Had fun but crowded. Suggest to get a fast pass to rides or shows of your choice,unless your willing to spend half your day falling in-line."
154,Read and follow folks' tips....,"First it’s important to say that the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride is spectacular and it’s worth a visit to the park just for this alone. The use of special affects to simulate the feeling of flight was amazing and wonderful. Even Harry and Hermione screaming at us in Japanese didn’t spoil the experience (and we are in Japan and they do speak Japanese here afterall). Any HP fans will love the village of Hogsmeade which has been created and will enjoy looking around and buying HP souvenirs etc. The other ride, Flight of the Hippogriff, was very short but a sweet little roller coaster which we enjoyed as we are not keen on being spun around upside down and scared to death. The rest of the park feels old and a bit shabby. It’s just a lot of shops which sell souvenirs and food and drinks. Yes it looks like a Hollywood back lot but it’s quite soulless and lacks any kind of character. My 12 year old just didn’t really grasp the whole concept of what a back lot is and why it would be interesting to anyone; he inhabits a digital world after all. And frankly the back lot buildings didn’t create a sense of “Hollywood” or capture the world of movies for me either. It opens at 9am and from 7am people were queuing outside to be first in and I can understand why, when you have to wait for hours to get on a ride it pays to be at the front of the line! We did pay the extra money for the express tickets which gave us a booked time to turn up, therefore it was a shock when we got there to join a line with a couple of hundred people in it; surely this couldn’t be the express? But yes it was and it moved very quickly thank goodness. But it’s good to know in advance what’s going on as we found there was a complete lack of information provided on how the express tickets worked (except for the time and the ride) and there is no signage at all explaining how anything works. The staff were all lovely and helpful. The food is dreadful (theme park yuck) but no worse than any other theme park in the world. We tried the Minion ride and it was really boring. One more issue, you can’t leave and go back to your hotel for a break. There is really no shade or anywhere to stop and chill out, unless you want to sit in a cafe. As a result it’s a really exhausting day, especially given the crowds (and we were there on a Thursday and it’s not the Japanese holidays yet)"
155,Get there early!! ,We went to USJ on a Monday but the park was full with visitors. Average queueing time was 60-90 minutes. Some visitors really live up to the Helloween theme and they do dressed up. Most of the rides are fantastic. I like the Harry Potter show where the castle was full with lights.
156,Great experience,A cool place to take a vacation especially if you bring kids. Many simulator or visual games. Many sell souvenirs with a variety of characters typical of Universal Studio. One day will not be satisfied. The restaurant also offers cakes with character.
157,Nice experience,"We went there on a holiday, so there were way to many people, but we still had a good time! The lines were long, so the 1 day pass came in handy! The Harry Potter ride was a hoot!"
158,Some of the best quality rides in a theme park to date!,thank god we were able to go here before they closed downgreat timing. lines were not that long due to the corona virus. harry potter ride wasnt long.we were able to see the attack on titans. love the ride of the flying dinosaur even if the ride waiting time was 3 hours .
159,Universal Studios Osaka,Highly recommend Prebooking express tickets if you can afford. Very expensive and they were sold out anyway when we bought tickets at the gate. So we had to wait in line like all the other commoners. Unfortunately we went during Christmas/new year so children were on school holidays. The good thing was that the lines were shorter than they were labelled. 40 minute waits were usually 20. The bad thing was there was no wifi in the park so I couldn’t message my husband. Which meant we had to wait for each other to finish a ride with one of our kids before coming back and going to another ride (one child was too scared to go on roller coasters.. or anything really). So we didn’t get to go on every ride we wanted to. The main roller coaster in Jurassic Park had a huge 75 minute wait so we decided to sacrifice that one. It looked amazing though. Hanging from the harness in a flying kind of position. My favourite ride was the Space Fantasy. I think it could be my favourite ride ever actually. Zipping around the universe and taking in the sights of Saturn and other planets was so fun! Something beautiful to look at whilst simultaneously hurtling around and screaming with joy made it very memorable. Would not recommend going to the 3D/4D shows if you can’t understand Japanese. They don’t have translation and we just stood there wondering how to escape because we had such limited precious time (it wasn’t possible to leave because we were standing in the middle of a large crowd).
160,Loves the atmosphere & Harry Potter,"I had an amazing time at universal studios. It ran so smoothly, there was heaps to do. Well worth the visit."
161,Understood nothing.,"It was an interesting with excitement day.  The games in the different worlds are designed for the different age group visitors.  We took the exciting rides in Harry Potter world n the Amazing adventure of Spiderman & the Jaws. The rides in the other worlds are also exciting and funThe shopping streets in USJ are colourful n full of visitors, we also bought some souvenirsWe also enjoy the street parades."
162,Most explanations are in Japanese and no re-entry,"It was a very nice experience, but the people there would wait three hours for a ride. It was also quite crowded and the food was overpriced."
163,Flying Experiences,"Had a blast here with the family. One advice, get the fast pass. Yes, costly but all worth it. This is the first time visiting USJ. Like all our past Disneyland experience, we spent most of our time queueing up for rides and not having enough time to enjoy all the rest. This visit we bought the 7 fast pass tickets and it was a great choice. We took most of the rides and still had time to spend time enjoying rest of attractions, relaxing and absorbing the fun filled atmosphere. Top favorite ride, ‘The flying dinosaur’. The rest were great as well and kids enjoyed. Maybe getting old but me and my wife came out feeling dizzy for some of the rides. Another advice, arrive earlier to avoid the crowd and sometimes they open earlier then stated."
164,Best day EVER,"First time in Universal and not disappointed. Some queues were too much, so we just moved on. Kids like Harry Potter, Minions and Jaws."
165,fantastic,"While some of the rides were thrilling the waits were simply too long. Up to 75 minutes wait for a ride that was only a few minutes long. Given the summer heat, the waits were almost unbearable. Also we had purchased express passes for some of the rides but my teenage children could not use the passes as they were above the size limit for those rides. We were not informed of the size limit at the time we purchased the express passes at the counter. Some of the rides such as Jaws were simply outdated."
166,Amazing but Busy,The park and details are very nice. But: 1. It is very complicated to buy tickets online in advance. You can just do it in  and staying in Japan. Express passes are very expensive. Ques are horrible. And rides are very shot in time. Sometimes it is not worth to stay hours in line. But Harry Potter’s world is maravillios
167,Better than Disney in Tokyo!! ,"USS Japan is by far the best amusement park I've been to. It is one of the largest yet not large enough the location of each attractions and theme parks are well placed and not far from each other which allows us to maximize the park and never get lost. The weather in June is perfect not too hot nor cold. We took the train from Namba to Universal city station via the Osaka look line towards Sakurajima. The ticket is about 7400 Yen or 68 USD for 1 day pass adult. We are very lucky because its a weekday and not very much crowded or touristy. The park is the 5th most visited in the world with about 8 million visitors. It has 9 theme parks similar to USS Orlando that includes Hollywood, Wizarding World of Harry Potter, NY, SFO, Boston, Minion Park, Jurassic Park, Water World and Universal Wonderland that includes Peanuts and Hello Kitty. Our favourite is Harry Potter. I was transformed into the magical land, characters, places and time of one of the world's most beloved books and characters and my personal favourite. You will be greeted by huge stone pillars in circle as it leads you to the main towering gate with Hogwarts Express right in front of you, followed by several key landmarks that include the library, train station, Hogsmeade Village where you could buy the famous Butter Beer (mind you it's delicious) and to top if all Hogwarts Castle. The park also contains artificial black lake beside the castle and 2 adventure rides: One outside roller coaster ride called Flight of the Hippogriff and the inside of Hogwarts Castle motion ride called Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. You could also walk inside the castle if you wanna skip the ride. There are also shows here that include Wand Magic and Wand Studies. If I would go back to USS Japan, Harry Potter is definitely a return and top of my list and will take more time exploring all it has to offer. In the end I bought some  Gryffindor scarf and keychain as memorabilia. Happy and Satisfied that I made it to USS Japan. It is indeed one of the best theme parks in the world. Thumbs up!!!"
168,Great experience with the VIP pass,"If you love theme park, we highly recommend to visit Universal Studios. The crowd is not as important as in Disneyland in Tokyo if even if it was during a weekend in the summer. The park is quite big so one whole day is the minimum, and Harry Potter should be the first attraction to be visited since it is quickly full. People are very helpful and the visitors are very polite (queues are always respected), which makes your day way more enjoyable.Thé only big problem we went through was when we booked through Tripadvisor that cancelled a few days before our weekend our tickets without explanations, we had to buy in a hurry a few days prior to our weekend."
169,Awesome tematic park,"Universal is a great place to begin a trip in Japan. Our class trip was a first time experience for many students to Japan, so it was a excellent place to begin, considering our tight timetable."
170,"Overpriced, overcrowded and overrated",Express ride tickets are super crazy expensive. Start as early as possible and calculate a full day timing and 1000usd for 2 adults & 2 children. In every facet crazy.
171,Way too crowded,"My partner is a huge Harry Potter fan so a visit to Japan had to include a day at Universal Studios.Before visiting my partner had warned me how busy Universal Studios gets, especially for the new Harry Potter ride where queues can take as long as 5 hours.On our visit we were incredibly lucky to have picked a day where queues weren’t that bad, for the Harry Potter Forbidden Journey we only queued for 15 mins and the longest queue was at the end of the day for the Jurassic Park rollercoaster where we had to wait for 2 hours.The Universal crew are amazing, as we were visiting during the Halloween season the crew were handing out free ‘trick or treat’ sweets’. All crew members were extremely friendly and engaging and were very helpful if required. Not only the team but also the visitors made our experience one to remember, the Japanese know how to have a good time at a theme park and they go out of their way to make foreigners feel welcome."
172,Q-niversal studios,"It is a beautiful park, many attractions.  But if you are an obese person, you will not enjoy it much.  Because in many of the attractions you are already invited to sit in the chair to know if you fit or not.  I understand it's a security issue, but intimidating and an embarrassing situation."
173,Be part of the USJ~~,"Even in mid-Sep 2019, it was still crowded. Our family was there the whole day and yet we were not able to experience all the rides since some of the popular ones had 90 minute waiting times for each and no option for single rider. Still enjoyed it especially the Halloween activities. No parade or fireworks though."
174,Universal studio day out,"We spent the whole day at the park (12 hours) with our 2 daughters, had a great time, enjoying the rides at the different worlds and especially Harry Potter world. Language was not an issue for non Japanese speakers, however the queues for the rides were very long and therefore if you can afford the Express Passes they are worth it but very expensive. Transport to the park was easy and we got to the park within 20 minutes form the center of Osaka. My biggest grip was there were very few bins around the park and you had to queue for everything from water at the vending machines to food at both restaurants and popup counters. Also there were very few places to get anything other than beer if you wanted an alcoholic drink."
175,harry potter,"Universal studios Japan is a perfect place to visit when one is in Osaka . Its huge full of interesting themes like Harry Potter , Minions , Hollywood park and many more.It's better to book the fast pass in advance otherwise there are 2 hours long queues for popular rides . Food is delicious , minion sandwich cookie is a must try ."
176,The best attraction part!,"Its pricey but still had a lot of fun,   spent a whole day there and I was tired,  It wasnt the greatest weather when I went,  So maybe thats why I gave it a 4.  Must be better on sunny days"
177,Feeling Gay at USJ!,"Nice enough.  A piece of America in Kansai.  Lines, junk food, noise and ersatz imagery. That's a theme park, right?"
178,Very dated and a bit flat,"We came here during the right period where the weather was just right. Our son enjoyed all the attraction especially the race cars. The shops were also interesting to see, moreover all the restaurants and fast food in the surrounding is very convenient."
179,"Fun, but disappointed with some arrangements","Universal studios Osaka has a far nicer layout than L.A and was more enjoyable to stroll around.  We went on a Saturday and it wasn’t as crowded as we’d found L.A a few years earlier (which seemed dangerously crowded!!!).  We bought an Express 4 which made it a very expensive day out but seemed worth it as 90 minute minimum waiting times for each ride would have otherwise made our day miserable.  The rides were fun, the food was as you’d expect for a theme park (crowded and long wait times to get a table).  The staff are to be commended - they are so friendly and upbeat, they really make every interaction wonderful.    My daughter looooves anime and they had a special Attack on Titan spectacular!!!   Apart from this, I would note there is nothing new to see here if you are looking for something different in your theme park.  But, it was  a fun day for our teenagers and we had a late dinner in the area outside the park before getting on the very accessible train back to accomodation.It was a busy day (Saturday) and very crowded but Japanese crowds are polite and considerate - as they are everywhere in this beautiful country!!!!!"
180,Great Park,"Universal studios Japan was the biggest disappointment. Lines as long as the human eye can see... for peanuts and popcorn stands! Expect to queue around 180-220 minutes for some of the bigger rides (Hollywood dream etc). Expect to wait around 4 hours to get into Harry Potter. Don’t even think about going if it’s a rainy day or you begin a game of darts where your eye is the board and the umbrella is the dart. Once we decided that the rides were too long a wait, we thought to pop into a restaurant or coffee shop to have a sit down, but this was not an option either. I’m starting to think maybe I’ve missed something and the fun is in the queuing??? Would recommend going if you’re just starting a new relationship and you want to find out the name of your potential other halves great great grandfathers dog. Souvenir shops were so busy it was a shoplifters / pick pocketers dream. A sea of people make you feel like you’re travelling during rush hour on London’s central line, if everyone dressed up as minions to go to work. In the 6 hours we were there, my husband and I managed to go on two rides. The Jurassic Park ride (2 hour queue) and the Spider-Man ride (over 2 hour queue... lost count of the minutes). We’re pretty fit people and in our 20’s but my husband said he felt like his feet were gonna throw up! Is this even possible? Only at Q-niversal! We were allowed to leave with a stamp to re-enter later so we could eat something outside as it was just far too busy inside. When we returned, we had to queue AGAIN to enter! It was raining and around 5pm at this point so it was certainly not getting any quieter. Honestly was expecting a super fun day but now that my daydreams lead to flashbacks of queues and crowds I think I’m gonna need to be treated for PTSD."
181,Fun and Loud,"This park is too greedy you can not bring water nor food inside , queue are too long basically on not busy day you would have to wait over 2 hrs for each ride it is very hard on a hot day , you will get very tired waiting in queue. The express pass is very expensive , food and drinks are expensive. There is no way to get fast track for free like in Disney land . We have done 3 !!! rides staying whole day in queue! Not happy never return!"
182,Unexpectedly fun,"It was my second trip to USJ this year. The first time around May this year and I thoroughly enjoyed myself even going with 2 very young kids (1.5yo and 3.5yo) My kids were very entertained with Sesame street, Minions, Hello Kitty and the Snoopy rides. If you were wondering if bringing young kids is difficult, it is not. It is a kid friendly place although with very young kids it is still quite a hassle. There are also plenty of food options. I unfortunately did not manage to try the exciting rides so I can't review those. The night parade was especially spectacular! My husband was blown away and decided to purchase the annual pass because of the parade. HOWEVER, from 14th November 2019, the nightly parade is being done away and in its place is a Christmas Crystal performance which would cost you a further ¥1500+ to watch it. SKIP IT. The performances were rather nice...there were fireworks at the end but I think it would only entertain true Christmas fans. There were no familiar USJ characters participating in the Christmas performances so kids might get bored fast. We thought the usual nightly parades are so much better."
183,Worth a visit,"Worth to go, I suggest you buy the express pass, really worth it to skip the long queues since they limit the pass (200 per day), so plan ahead which ride you prefer the most and buy the express pass accordingly, my kids can cut 50 mnts queue to only 10 mnts with the express pass"
184,One of the highlights of our trip to Japan,"Some great attractions here, the Harry Potter ride is superb. However the amount of people admitted daily is huge making it difficult to see a lot. Go early and stay late will be your only chance"
185,Surprisingly disappointed,"Family group of 7 - 6 adults and an 11 year old. A truly amazing experience despite the language barrier. We enjoyed the shows where very little English is spoken - but that’s ok - we’re in Japan after all. However, two members of staff on the Hollywood Dream ride had the potential to ruin the whole day. Two separate incidents too. Four of us decided to do the singles line to speed things up. My 11yo daughter was fine with this and is a chilled kid. We decided that she’d go in the middle so an adult could be waiting for her. As she placed her bag in the locker at the side she was told she couldn’t and then directed to a full locker. Confused as she couldn’t see where to put her bag - she was shouted at. She then was instructed to put the bag where she was originally going to. She then got told to take something off her head. As she wasn’t wearing anything except a braid that is part of her hair (plaited in and tied back) she again was confused. She was shouted at again by this staff member- she left the ride quite upset. Same ride - I was asked by a number of staff to remove a bandana prior to the ride. Having been on a previous one I was expecting this. I stated I would remove it at the bag locker and at least 3 staff members smiled and accepted this. I lost all my hair following treatment- it’s not a fashion statement- my hair has grown back super curly and is at a stage where it’s in between. I’m self conscious of this - but I also accept their rules. One staff member would not accept that I would take it off when I put the bag and other belongings that were still in my hand in the locker. He demanded I take it off there and then. I was still in the queue. I was so upset I completed the ride choking back tears. We be tried to contact the park directly but as I’m not able to felt that it would be part of my review. Such a shame as other members of staff were amazing - server in Harry Potter world for example. Universal Japan. Please remember that people have paid good money to come to your site, most are either on holiday or enjoying family time."
186,Unexpectedly Good... very interesting place,"The place was great, specially the Harry Potter area, the butter beer is a must, the ques are very long tho, but we had the express pass so we were able to zoom right in front, it's worth the extra charge, a lot of attention is in Japanese so we weren't able to understand 70% of the shows, but it was a great experience"
187,Pick the right day to go,"Lots of interesting rides and a must go,  however, unless u have an express pass Most rides are between 2-3 hours.  It was horrible experience with young children.  And if it rains, it spoils the trip. We cut short the trip when the rain did not stop.   The locals seems used to it to Long Q.  Get an express pass and save your time."
188,USJ,"This is second visit to Universal Studios Japan because of 'Harry Potter'. Bought the Universal Express Pass Package which was quite expensive to avoid the approximately 2 hours queuing for several attraction/rides. The restaurants good food, especially the Finnegan Bar & Grill."
189,Refreshing time but not refresh,All the attractions are amazing with a lot of sensations. You obviously don’t have the time to get bored. The atmosphere is perfect and so so so amazing!!!!!!
190,One day isn't enough!,Good theme park but with very limited food options. A lot of sit down restaurants were full or offered only buffet services. They also closed at 8pm which I felt was a bit too early.Get an express pasa thri Klook!!!!
191,Great place,"I have been wanting to go to a Harry Potter world for ages.  We were visiting Japan, and this park didn't disappoint.  There were many sections with a great variety of foods, rides, and the buildings were phenomenal. I especially loved the Harry Potter world.  It was amazing!  I totally recommend the park if you are visiting.  I have been to Universal Studios in California.  The Osaka is bigger, and the price makes it worth visiting."
192,Happy Me~,It was little pricey but was worth it! Try butter beer (non alcoholic. Tasted like vanilla cream soda.)
193,Unfortunate weather forecast,"Decided last minute to come here as a couple.  Bought tickets at the entrance at face value 7400 plus tax (per person).  Considered getting the express pass but the dealers online were trying to sell them at 4x face value (roughly 4xx USD per person).  Decided not to get them as I found the idea of spending close to 800 USD on going to Universal for 1 day absolutely absurd.  I was just at Universal in Orlando and purchased the express pass at face value.  At this particular park, you can ride as a single person and the wait is usually about 20 minutes per ride.  My partner and I did this for every ride except Minions which doesn't offer this service.  For example, the Harry Potter ride had a huge line and the wait time was 70 plus minutes.  We went on the singles line, together, and we were on the ride in 15 minutes.  Same thing with Spiderman although the wait time was roughly 40 minutes compared to 70 for the normal line.  Most of the other rides were 10 to 20 minutes on the singles line.  The two rollercoasters had long lines on both the normal line and the singles line.  The lady hates rollercoasters so I never had the chance to ride them.  We arrived at 10am although it took 1 hour to buy a ticket and enter the park.  If we arrived at 8am like the other guests, we easily would have been able to do every ride here and watch several of the shows.  On September 30th, there were quite a few people as the local schools were closed due to some kind've sports event.  So the place was packed.The express pass is obviously better but if you are with a group of friends / couple, you could still do everything if you use our strategy.  Go to guest services when you arrive and find out which rides you can sign up for.  We signed up for the new ride based on resident evil and only waited a few minutes because of this ticket.  Area 51 is easily the most underrated attraction at the park.  Line is only 20 to 30 minutes and the actual ""ride"" is close to 30 minutes.  May not be suitable for young children.I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars due to the food situation.  99% of the food is pretty unhealthy and you have to wait in long lines just to get something to eat.  I am positive this is done intentionally to force the customer to wait in cue to eat to relieve pressure off of the lines at the main attractions.  It took over 20 minutes just to get a hot dog.  While universal could hire more people or have more food carts, it is obvious that they have chose to inconvenience the customer for their own benefit.  Also if you are Jewish, Muslim, a vegetarian, have celiac disease or some other kind of food allergy, you aren't going to be happy here.  Don't expect any Kosher, Halal, vegan, gluten free, etc. at most places.  The Universal studios in Florida does a pretty decent job labeling the food in the markets but I didn't see that here.  Perhaps I didn't investigate it enough.  Would give it 5 stars if they were able to address this but I doubt that will happen.  There's nothing worse than spending all this money and then being told you cannot bring outside food into the park, especially if you have legitimate concerns.  Perhaps universal can just charge a self serve fee but again I am just dreaming.Also more bathrooms would be nice.  Had to wait in line for that as well..."
194,"Halloween party, Great fun!","Visited USJ on a Wednesday where the season is marked as 'A' and without the Express pass.Parked is crowded but we managed to try most of the must try rides.  During our visit, the waiting time ranges between 45mins to 95mins each.Rating from us for the rides we tried:1) Flying dinosaur2) Hollywood backdrop (must do the backwards ride)3) Despicable Me Minion Mayhem4) Spider-Man 4K3D ride5) Harry Porter - Flight of Hippogriff"
195,Ridiculous prices for express passes,"I flew all the way to Japan to see the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. However, AFTER paying full price tickets and entering the park, there was a sign saying Harry Potter world is full and can only be accessed via a lottery ticket. I queued with hundreds of people and nobody won the HP lottery.This should have been told to us BEFORE entering the park, ideally at the time of buying the tickets as HP was my only reason for going. Instead, they take customers' money and then forbid them from seeing most of the park. I've honestly never been so disappointed. Terrible problem with overcrowding and even worse way of dealing with it. Staff was rude, and told us literally to ""go away"" when we asked if there was any other way to access HP world that day. (e.g. buying an extra pass).It's theft tbh as they refused to provide a service I paid a lot for, through no fault of my own."
196,Harry Potter World,"Never been Universal Studio before. At first i thought it is more suitable for a family with teenagers, surprisingly i myself became one of them.🤣🤣. Really enjoy view, the shows, foods, rides and a lots more.I really impressed by the Harry Potter Attractions ie, Hogsmeade, Hogwarts Castle, the street entertainment etc... i know i will definately going again...In fact, if only a day visit, it is not enough. I will recommend buying 2days Studio Pass. I bought Universal Express Pass 4 as well. I guess May could be a non peak season because some game i dont really need a long queues.If you like to take photos like us...well one day definately not enough! So, plan your time!!"
197,Toddler Friendly,Our second visit.  We did not spend time on the rides and our main purpose was to spend time on Harry Porter area and to watch their Christmas show.  It was fun for the children at the Harry Porter area to use the wand for various actions.  The special effects of the show were commendable.
198,Went only for Harry Potter World,"The first universal studio in Asia,  large area, but not so huge.The highlight is Harry Potter area which is the only in Asia. Get your butterbeer here and grab its souvenir. Be a wizard of your own. Some thrill rollercoater are worth to try even in a long queue, and if you dont mind pls have the single rider seat or get the express past for better convenient. Dont forget to taste the turkey leg and minions bun. The food and souvenir price inside are acceptable. Access : universal city station, jr pass valid for this station.Get you sunscreen on during the sunny day. Have your day here!!!"
199,Happy time,"Universal Studios Japan is enjoyable for both young and old.  The attractions here are different from what you will see in other places.  We were particularly awed by the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.  Most of the performances were in Japanese but the staff should be able to help you with anything.  A day will not be enough to see all the features, 2 days should be enough.  The lines for the rides are long and so it is best to go early.  There are plenty of food stalls and restaurants in the resort.  Try the Butterbeer!"
200,Osaka Universal Studios,"We live in Kansai and were able to visit in July 2020 during the restricted entry for local residents.  We went on a weekday and there were no lines or large crowds.  Everyone of the USJ staff was very happy and friendly. It was remarkable and added to the fun experience.  **TIP** Download the USJ app on Android or iPhone. The map feature is excellent, you can save favorites and there is real-time information about wait times for the attractions.  The Harry Potter Journey was incredible. It did make me dizzy and nauseous afterwords however.  Overall it was a very fun day and we were able to see/do everything we wanted in about 5 hours because there were no lines or wait times for any of the attractions or restaurants."
201,Harry Potter World a bit over rated,"We bought our VIP passes.Picking up the bracelet from the 16th floor of the viewing tower was no problem. Also finding out the exact opening time of the park for tomorrow went very well (07:00 in our case).On the day itself we were 25 minutes before this time at the meeting point Studio West entrance.The queue at VIP was a bit shorter than at the normal entrance.But ALL entrances were opened at the same time. The VIPs were NOT admitted earlier than the others.Is the VIP ticket worth it? Yes, because you know the exact opening hours and can plan better how early you want to queue. But you don't get in earlier than people with normal tickets.For the Harry Potter world you don't have to get a time ticket in the park so early in the morning (at least not before 09:00 a.m.).We could complete the main line at Harry Potter 3 times without queuing. It was totally worth it - a great experience!After 09:00 the park get very full (we visited the park on a monday)."
202,Great day out in Osaka,"Went there early December, the lines were supposedly not as long as expected but it was cold. I suggest a fast pass to ease the waiting time and to walk around and choose where to have your meals, as there are a couple of options throughout the studio."
203,Day pass,"I enjoyed our visit at USJ. This is not my first time but I still had a lot of fun. The rides will either make you go scared or crazy with its twists for you to enjoy. Although it’s a given that there will be a long line to some of the rides still, we’ve managed to try out a lot of rides. Regarding souvenirs, food and other stuff..there are some that price is reasonable. So no worries, you will still enjoy USJ without getting broke"
204,A day is not enough,"First of all is not as the same as the universal parks in USA, and I got a little beat surprised that there open the doors of the park earlier, also you need to ask for all the information about the schedule of activities, also in weekends you need to reserve a fast pass or when you enter the park go for the fast pass of the attractions you must like.In my case I also had a problem in the tax free, and the don't help me. In the park all the things were well but after buying a lot of things they don't return you the tax of 10% only 8% also if you buy things for a friend in Japan you can apply for it to tax free, because you can open the bag until you leave Japan."
205,"Fantastic fun, queues were too long. ","Whenever i go to any Universal Studio, I always like to be part of it. I would just wear something related to them such as minion shirt. It's very common inside there. We went at October, so a lot people dressed up in their Halloween costumes. The most attraction park in this Universal Studio is the Harry Potter park. You will be amazed how much effort they had put to build up the vibe. The other rides were fun and exciting too. I would suggested you to get the fast pass to avoid a very long queue for the famous ride."
206,Best itinerary!,Cool looking park and attractions. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Osaka. Just make sure you arrive early and plan your day. Expect long wait times no matter the time of year.
207,Way to expensive. ,"Its my first time visiting USJ, and i must say. I think its better than USS (dont hate just an opinion even tho they dont have transformers here). They have these crazy big ass rollercoasters too! A day isnt enuf to roam the place. Its a lot bigger than USS. Such a treat for your eyes. Made me so happy! Worth every penny"
208,Best day at universal!,"We buy the ticket thru online. Well this place is a must if you come to osaka. You will love everything inside here. Till today i still remeber everything. Keep in your mind this place will be full with the people. Just que, wait your turn and enjoy the ride. If you have an extra money, please buy express ticket if you dont like to waiting too long."
209,It's worth the visit!,"Very expensive. I could not put a 3,5 note so I stick to the 3 instead of the 4. The entrance fee is horribly expensive compared to what the park is offering. You have little ball games inside that you have to pay ¥1000 to ¥1200! And if you loose you don’t get anything! I am used to go to Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea, where the fees are cheaper, you have more to do and the same kind of games cost ¥500 and if tou loose you get a collectible pin that is not on sale in the shops. Anyway, it is hard to find your way at USJ. And often the Harry Potter ride is closed because it is broken. So yesterday when I went they kept on opening it and close it during the day!!! When you pay this amount of money, you expect everything to work normally! Disappointed. If you have to choose to spend your money in a park, definitely choose Disneyland."
210,You don't need the express pass,"We took my sister for her birthday and it was the best birthday ever! You can get a birthday sticker from any staff member in the shops and when staff see you wearing it, they wish you a happy birthday! All staff, in the street, at rides, at shops and even serving staff in restaurants (they list it as an item on the receipt so when you collect your food, all the staff know).It rained a bit while we were there which kinda sucked but it wasn't heavy rain so it's didn't stop any rides or shows.If you want to make sure to get on every ride, you should definitely buy the Universal Express Pass (you can buy tickets online even if you don't live in Japan, you just need a credit card). The queues for most rides are in excess of 120mins at any time of day. Express Pass will have you on the ride in less than 15 minutes.Best rides to experience: The Flying Dinosaur (roller-coaster), Hollywood Dream (roller-coaster) , Spiderman (4D moving cart on a track) and Harry Potter Forbidden Journey (4D moving chair on a track).Merchandise is far more expensive than other theme parks in Japan (such as Disney). But it's very good quality in most cases. You can get very cool light up goods for the night time, unique goods exclusive to the park and many fun headbands and hats to show your appreciation for characters.The food is very yum, we really enjoyed eating at the Three Broomsticks in the Harry Potter area. It was very western cuisine such at pot pies, salads, whole corn on the cob, chicken with mashed potatoes etc. Felt a lot like being a student at Hogwarts for sure! And of course, during winter the hot butterbeer was a delight."
211,Whole day of fun.,"Props to the warm and friendly staff at Universal Studios, Japan for ensuring the safety of the crowd while guiding and entertaining the crowd! Before making your way towards the Harry Potter section of Universal, you might want to check out the schedules for the 4D movie or head over to water world first (correct me if I'm wrong but they close earlier than the rest of the theme park?) before spending the rest of the afternoon sipping on butterbeer, getting your wands, having a meal, hop onto the award-winning Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride. While you're there, you won't want to miss out on the parade which is worth the wait!  *Credit card is accepted here."
212,Excellent,Went to Universal studios on a Wednesday hoping for smaller crowds but seemed like everyone had the same idea.Had a good time especially the Harry Potter experience.Real value for money if you are prepared to wait in the queues.Further it was easily accessible rail from Osaka station.
213,The best day!,"I really wanted to go to HP World, but online I found it very hard to understand the ticket system. When I went to book tickets they always said, “Harry Potter World timed ticket not included”. Then when you clicked on get timed entry it was the express pass (but a lot of different options depending on days too). I don’t love rides so didn’t need the express pass and didn’t think worth the money, but couldn’t figure out the timed entry ticket part. In the end I understood the express pass gives 30 minute time slots to different rides, to allow them to have a select number of people and guarantee low wait times. We went on a day that was 18,000 visitors (checked an online website that predicted amount of visitors) and we waited at most 20 minutes for each ride. Obviously the 30,000 visitor days would have more wait times. Overall, Harry Potter World didn’t need an express pass or timed entry and was simple enough. We really liked the feel of it, but also of course a bit silly for adults and it’s more geared towards kids. Would definitely recommend for Harry Potter fans, but of course much better for people who love rides. The best unexpected part was the Water World show, very cool! Would recommend the shows for adults and kids alike!"
214,Highlight of my trip. Definitely not to miss!,"Nice place to be there but there was so many people. If you intend to play, its best to buy the fast lane tickets so that you can enjoy it. I didn't have the time to enter bcos of so many people there & the queue was terrible."
215,Jans' 7th birthday,"Well our visit to Osaka was mainly due to USJ. My son loves Minions. We visited USJ on a weekend. It was pretty crowded as it was also school holidays I guess. Luckily we pre booked our tickets and got the express pass as well. Main attractions are Harry Potter, Minions, Spiderman and Jurasic World. The staff were friendly and always are there to guide you thru the park. Lots of attractions and shows in different parts of the parkI strongly recommend the express pass, as you will minimum wait for 60-90 minutes in a que for each ride. To safe time do get the express pass.  We really had an amazing time at USJ"
216,Best universal studio experience!,"We bought tickets for 2 days (because we knew we will spend long time shopping and applying for tourist refund). 1st day was on 29th JAN 2020, and the next day 30th JAN. We got there at around 8:20 and 8:30 am and on both days we ended up quite close to the entrance when we arrived.The park opened at 8:45 (eventhough it listed the to open at 9am). Since there was a ""Cool Japan"" event, our first priority was to ride the Attack on titan. Eventhough the queue listed at 45 mins, we got on the ride after about 20-25mins. It was a really cool indoor roller coaster ride with VR. This turned out to be the best decision because throughout the day the line for this were consistently 100-110mins. We went to Minion Meyham next with very little wait (20 mins) but it was really disappointing. Maybe more for kids.  Minions Ray sliders was next and it was surprisingly good. Then we immidiately went for Harry potter ride and IT WAS AMAZING!!! This is the best ride I have ridden in awhile! The wait for this was about 45 mins (however we went in after 30 mins.) I noticed the listed wait times are often Over estimated. We did not go on the 2 roller coasters (Dinasour and Hollywood Dream)  because we were more excited for the Harry Potter world. The ButterBeer is a MUST! we paid 650yen for it. Also, there is a line in HP world which seemed to lead nowhere....this is actually the line into the wand magic show. We went in and WE WERE PICKED TO GET A MAGIC WAND! WOW! However eventhough we won, the wand is NOT FREE and costs 4900 yen. With the wand you can go around the park and test your magic spells (like opening a locked door, lighting a fire lamp ect.) - gimicky if you ask me. For lunch we ate at the 3 broomsticks - be warned, it was very expensive although very very delicious. I ordered the Sheperds pie - incredibly good! But the Fish and chips were salty! On the 2nd day we ate at The Dragon's Pearl - disappointing - Dont waste your money here!!! On both days we ate dinner at universal City walk mall (just outside Universal after we have exited the park). we ate pasta at Romaken (just beside matsumoto kiyoshi) - highly recommended and cheaper than eating inside USJ too.Anyways, other rides we went on were Spiderman (really good), Terminator (just another 3-d show), Jaws( quite boring)  and some kids rides (Elmos skateboard - which was surprisingly good, Flying Snoopy and Moopy's ballon). We went to ALmost all the shows, The SHrek 3-D and the  Sing on Tour were really good! Water world (in Japanese so we did not understand) and BAckdraft were okay. I also enjoyed Monster's Rock and Roll show, but I have a feeling the japanese audiences did not - maybe because they sang mostly 80s english songs which I enjoyed very much!But highlight of the trip was the light show at Harry potter world. This show is incredible and Not to be missed! The night parade was just okay - Pale in comparison with Disney's night parade. The 2nd day we went on the Harry potter ride 3 MORE TIMES!!!! Yeah, we loved it that much! It was really impressive! And each time we did  not was wait more than 20 minutes. Towards end of the day at around 6pm , we went on the ride again and had no wait at all because everybody were waiting at outside the castle to watch the light show. We also finished our shopping at around 4pm and at the time, the line for the tourist refund were really short!!! So, my advice is do your shopping early and get the tourist refund done early - as it gets really crowded at night.We glad we came on wed and thurs. There were not many crowds at all. most rides had only 20-30 mins wait except the flying Dinosaur and hollywood dream and even that they were consistently 55-60 mins max everytime i checked. I saw some people buying express passes and cant help to think they just wasted their money on that day."
217,Amazing afternoon out!,"If you've visited any of the other Universal parks then you know what to expect here.  Universal Japan has all the same rides, but you must buy the fast pass if you want to get on the most popular, otherwise expect to queue for up to two hours (which is no fun in 40 degrees).  The park does feel very Japanese despite all the US trappings - it's spotlessly clean, the rides/parades/food stalls are staffed by super polite and efficient people and because it's visited by Japanese people in the main, it seems much calmer than most other theme parks we've visited.  Try to eat outside of the usual lunch and dinner slots to avoid the crowds and take snacks (although there are numerous places to eat they are far more expensive then anything else we came across in our trip to Japan).  It's a great day out and the park seemed to clear by about 6.30pm so consider coming later in the day if you want to get on more rides.  The night time parade was our favourite and well worth staying for - check notice boards for timings.  One last thing is that wifi is almost non existent, so use the paper map to get around rather than any app you might have heard about and check ride height restrictions in advance if you're travelling with children."
218,Bigger than expected!,"We went there on New Year's day & it was not a wise choice.The park itself is OK - good layout, accessible, good variety of rides and entertainment. But we didn't get to fully appreciate it because of the thick crowd, long queue and limited operation hours. Go on off-peak, never during Holidays."
219,"Fantastic Day Out, Large Rides Busy but Plenty of other things to do","On a weekday, took almost 5 & 7 year olds, arriving at 11amish. Bought tix at gate (had trouble online) which was quick (5 mins) and left the park at 7pm. Regretted not buying the express passes (for 3/5 rides) as we spent 45 mins + waiting for most rides and zig zagged the park a fair bit to try catch events at the times they were on. Missed out on a fair bit even though we had a plan. It also began to rain from around 3pm and never stopped so the fireworks and parade were cancelled with nothing to replace either except for a few actors (maybe 6) dressed in colourful outfits standing in a line waving at visitors. This is completely underwhelming and needs improvement.The Cool Japan shows/attractions had a decent area and close to park entry but we didn’t visit as we had other priorities for our kids age interest.Harry Potter land is amazing and looks so magical. Didn’t have timed entry in mid March. A definite highlight even though our kids haven’t yet read or watched any. Magical Nights light show was great. The Wand Studies was a waste of time unless you have it to waste and was definitely a cheesy push to send people through the wand shop which looked amazing but wand prices were bananas at 50 a pop. Zipped through the castle due lack of time. Missed the ride due to long queue in rain and kids too small for roller coaster.Kids loved the Water World performance Sesame st 4D movie was great and the only movie we were able to catch due time/locationMinions and Spider-Man rides were excellent for all of us. Jurassic Park scared our almost 7 more than our younger kid as he hated the steep drop. Be prepared to get wet. Disappointments:-Queues were long for non peak time & minimal or no entertainment offered. Some shows/rides had time consuming pre show/ride sections which were just average and need reviewing -It’s Japan so yes, Japanese is the language used but there is ample opportunity for spoken English or at least subtitles during all shows. -Not enough characters sighted in park. Only saw about 5/6 of the Sesame St characters in the Hollywood area (I think) and that’s it! For the whole 8 hours we were there.-Unlike Disneyland, staff do not give Universal Studio stickers out. You have to request them. Almost all have them so it’s crappy you have to ask. It’s also crappy that there are only a small selection. Disneyland nails this! and it helps keep the kids in queues a bit happier when they hand them out.-Retail merch here was noticeably more expensive than Disney Tokyo a year prior. I expect high prices but I drew the line here as I felt it was a joke.- a number of rides were closed for maintenance and then more due to the rain. - many things closed around 5 pm, too many! With the rain and this, I found the park quite boring and looked forward to leaving but decided to swing by Muppet land where we managed to get on 3 rides in one hour. This area is great for under 5s but in saying that our almost 7 enjoyed it too.In summary: visited La Universal 10yrs ahi and that was great. This time, with kids, it was a good but a number of disappointments for what it cost (time & $) ,too many things closed, not as exciting or magical as Disney."
220,One ticket missing - has to buy a new one,I was really nervous about whether or not we would need to buy an express pass to go on rides. Ended up not getting one and arrived at the park at midday. Went on Tuesday 1st October and walked straight into the park and straight onto Harry Potter and the forbidden journey. After reading the reviews I was very surprised that there was no line but just a nice walk through the castle to the ride! Around this time most lines were advertising about 30 minutes but we then walked straight onto the Spider-Man ride after that. As the day went on things seemed the get busier between 3pm until about 7:30pm when times for rides went down again. Waited about 30 mins for space fantasy and then 60 minutes single rider line for the flying dinosaur.  Ended up being very glad we didn't buy the express passes as only needed them on 2 rides and if we stayed from 8-9pm rather than leaving at 8pm we could have done them then. Harry Potter world is amazing and butter beer is delicious. A great day out!Only con is the food is more expensive than regular theme parks so be ready for that.
221,TWILIGHT TICKET,"If you dont mind riding separately from your friends, always go for the single rider queue, there is hardly anyone else in this queue and the wait time can be just 5mins amd you can easily go for 2nd round. Do wear more sunscreen and use uv umbrella if u are going in summer cos  there isnt much shelter. Packaging of the sourvenirs are so cute, you will be tempted to buy everything!"
222,A Magical Experience at Universal Studios Japan,"Purchased entry tickets plus express 4 from Klook for 2A, 2C (8 & 10) as the only day we could attend was a Sunday. Not cheap!  Surprisingly, the waits for rides didn't exceed an hour but our express pass certainly helped when we were tired at the end of the day. Arrived 30 mins before opening and left 30 mins before close and we didnt  do all the rides.Kids loved Jaws (did it twice), Harry Potter, Spiderman, Terminator, with most enjoyable and  memorable moments going to Jurassic ride (be warned - if you are in the front - you WILL get wet!)  We didnt do rollercoasters due to both waits and lack of interest.  A couple of rides/ experiences are lost due to the language such as Backdraft and Minions. Waterworld was action packed and even without speaking Japanese were were able to still enjoy in the pre-show activities thanks to the great actors.Buying a wand and casting spells, watching stage shows throughout USJ and soaking up the atmosphere all made for a fun family day.We found although the food looked amazing, didnt really taste that great and we craved a decent meal by the end of the day."
223,best time ever,Got to get there early before the park open. Japanese are crazy about the amusement park too. So there will be a long line at the entrance. The Harry Potter section does not require special admission so you can go in. But super long line for the line. At least an hour or more. It is very tiring to go during summer time. The weather is hot and th Elaine is long. Be prepared to suffer😂
224,Excellent day at universal studios japan,"If you are as me, a little bit afraid of taking the rides, you dont need to buy express acess. Spent six hours there and it was almost enough. A must if you are in Osaka. Stayed at Universal Port. 3 min walk from the entrance."
225,Trains,"It was raining since morning til late at night, even though i was drenched but i enjoyed myself on the roller coaster rides 'Backdrop' & the 'Hollywood Dream'. It was raining but the attractions continued operating thru-out, which i expect there will be closures for the rides. I went on Halloween season and played til 10pm at night... The staffs were very cheerful and friendly also helpful even though some of them cant really understand english. I will definitely visit again...I bought the express pass 7, take note that you have to follow the timings to enter the attractions amd only 1 time use for each ride if you are getting the express pass..."
226,Prepare to queue!,"Before coming, I had read the reviews about crowds and was expecting the worst. To my surprise, although busy, it wasn’t “out of control”.We were here on a Thursday in early December - the estimated crowd (google USJ Crowd Calendar) forecast 17,000. Queues for the popular rides were around 1hr though we went as singles which typically meant 10-20min waits.Harry Potter was the highlight with the rides and “streets” having a very authentic integrated feel.The Flying Dinosaur was the definite thrill ride, being both long and terrifying.One negative is that some “rides” are only in Japanese. For Jaws that didn’t really matter, but Backdraft lost a lot of impact. Most major attractions that we visited, the language didn’t matter or they did dual language or sub titles.You can’t leave and re enter so you have to buy food there (not allowed to bring in?). Food was ok but expensive as you might expect."
227,Busy Park,"As a family with 2 teenagers, we visited USJ. While we got the 15 minute early entry, we were done just after 2pm. There are about 4 main rides and Harry Potter world. There is no much after that. For the price that we paid for the tickets, I did not find this to be good value."
228,Family trip,"Let's start that this park is quite different from the one I visited in Orlando, Florida. There are some rides built only there and some are missing. Especially the ride on the pterodactyl tail.The local ride, Attack on Titans, unfortunately, was closed and we couldn't do it. There is another huge ride which is closed as well.First tip: get to the park from Monday to Thursday. Check if no holidays are happening in country. This will save you from overcrowding. Huge tip: should you plan not to get express pass I highly recommend choosing to go via solo lanes. Way faster, ignores 2 hour waiting time. The only negative is the one cannot sit next to their friends/family. It is possible to ask at the ride if they have solo queues or check on booklets (found on internet or handed out at the entrance). As a result, we manneged to do almost all major rides without waiting ages.How to get there? There is a designated JR train connected to main train lines of Osaka. In stations there are various signs indicating which station to take. Don't worry to ask staff, very helpful and resourceful. From Nararel hostel it took us 30mins to get there.The only drawback of the park are prices. Some prices of the place are skyrocketing. The wands start from 4200 yens which is more then a half of ticket. Food is fresh and decent, no complaints here.Almost forgot, terminator 3d show is my personal sleeper. Even if you don't understand Japanese it is rather easy to follow the action. I have never seen that footage with original actors from the franchise. Well worth for anyone. In sum, it was a well spent time full of surprises, great March, tears and 3 rides on HP castle. Despite high prices and sometimes overcrowded days, I highly recommend this park for a visit for families, couples or solo travellers"
229,Single rider queue is the best ,My husband and I are in our 50s and we thoroughly enjoyed universal studios. We managed to do most of the rides with no ill effects. Fabulous day out for any age. I would highly recommend the Harry Potter ride
230,Worth the Visit,"Well, as we do have a Universal Studio in Sentosa (and we had annual pass), which is just a 30-min-drive away from home, we looked forward to something unique in Universal Studio Japan, and they nailed it!Of course we don't have Harry Potter and Minion rides in Singapore, but the real differentiator is the attention to  ""customer experience"" in every single detail. I will not go into details as I don't want to turn this review into a ""design thinking"" analysis. You just need to be there to experience it.It is highly recommended to get the express pass (although it is rather expensive). They do not have one single express pass for everything. Instead, they have a set of express passes you can choose. It looks complicated at first glance but is actually very easy to understand once you read a bit more. You should study the options a bit and choose the most suitable one according to your plan and interests.The only thing I think can be better is that, they do not sell tickets and express pass in their website. Instead their website provides the link to authorized 3rd party agency for you to buy tickets online. This additional layer caused me a bit problem: in fact the express pass does not include the one day pass for you to enter the park first. However, the 3rd party agency website doesn't highlight this to me when I purchased the express pass. Even worse, they told me the express pass is ""direct in"" (turned out it means it is ""direct in"" for the ride, not for the park entrance). We had to re-queue at the ticket office to buy the one day pass when we were there."
231,Amazing USJ,"Too many games and things to do in just one day, so it's really impossible to do in a half day. Things I enjoyed the most was Harry Potter and Minions experiences"
232,Love USJ,"What an awful decision it is! Almost everything, like instructions and movies, was in Japanese. The worst thing was Harry Potter Adventures was also all in Japanese. Why?"
233,It’s not worth it if you just go alone!,"the overall impression of this USJ Osaka was small, crowded park with less attractions and very business minded kind of feeling. Some attractions are alright e.g Hollywood wonderland, Harry Potter castle, Amazing Spiderman etc, the rest was ok, no surprised. Food are boring yet expensive and long queue as any Uni Studios e.g. burger, pizza, fried chicken rice etc. If you were first timer visiting Uni studio, you might be having lots of fun, but if you have visited other Uni studio, then Dun expect too high"
234,Best Theme Park in Japan!,"We traveled by train to the Universal Studios from Shin Osaka. It required two changes (from one line to another) but not too difficult to navigate. It was a Friday on our visit and the park was full of school children in uniform. We had purchased the tickets online and also the express pass which saved us some time especially for the popular rides. We took the forbidden ride in Harry Potter, the Jaws boat cruise and the Despicable Minions. These are not the scary rides but all fun and enjoyable. One disappointing fact is that the movies and explanations were all in Japanese without English subtitles. Given the volume of International tourists I would expect the park to provide English subtitles for the benefit of non Japanese speakers."
235,Couldn't access Wizarding World,We didn’t mind waiting for the rides as the queues weren’t too bad. The best rides were the Harry Potter school and the Jurassic park flying roller coaster. Waterworld show was awesome but Backdraft was not worth the wait. Wish we’d seen the little Japanese restaurant near San Fransisco  instead of all the cheap fast food options. We left on a high! Such a great day!
236,Universal in summer,"We had a shambolic visit to USJ a couple of years ago, unprepared and arriving to by tickets the day of our visit to find nearly all express passes sold out and leaving us to spend the day dreaming of skipping the crazily long queues.Well this time I was well prepared... purchased tickets well in advance and forked out the big bucks for the standard/space fantasy express 7 pass. We saved a couple of hundred dollars buy purchasing direct from the USJ Japanese language website. I just used Google Translate on my iPhone to translate the pages on my iPad...... it was relatively simple and I just used the japan address of our accommodation in japan. A link to the tickets is emailed immediately and you even have the option to print them in English which was surprising, anyway the Klook quote was about $250 more expensive than direct from USJ and there was no waiting at all.So with tickets and express passes in hand we headed for our second attempt, determined to get the most out of the day. We arrived at the gates at 8:15am with gates opening at 8:30, we were through the gates quickly and well ahead of the majority of the crowd and rather than rush to Harry Potter land to queue for the forbidden journey like everyone else, we headed to the Spider-Man ride and walked straight on without any queue.Then we went to Space Fantasy ride and again got straight on without queuing.Next we headed to Harry Potter Land to have an explore before our first timed express pass which was the Forbidden Journey at 10:20am.I had read on a forum that if wands purchased from the park with the the infrared reflector malfunction that they will fix it or replace it. My son had played with his wand which was purchased two years earlier and scratched the plastic tip - no major damage just a couple of scratches on the plastic tip that prevented it from making the magic spells work around Hogsmeade, anyway we asked at the wand shop but they said unless it was purchased that day there was nothing they could do which was disappointing but not surprising.The express pass line for the Forbidden Journey was huge and had us and everyone else worried we’d wasted a lot of money to still stand in long queues all day but once the line started moving we were in chasing the snitch and dodging dementors in less than 10 minutes. We all loved the Forbidden Journey and can see why it is so highly rated as an attraction. The rest of the day went smoothly using the express passes to skip the queues and feeling no pressure to rush anywhere.For food we had a good hearty lunch at the Hogs Head Inn which made sure the kids didn’t go hungry, the must have Minion Banana Ice-cream Sandwich and a few other snacks during the day. There are additional cost games on offer all over the park for 1200y - I was talked into playing a couple to try and win stuffed things.... if you want to win prizes I would suggest the banana toss at the Minion area - i had two goes for two wins - it seemed ridiculously easy to me but maybe I was just lucky ..... anyway now we have a couple of one foot tall and much loved stuffed Minions to accompany us for the rest of Japan trip.By 4pm we had finished our express passes and rain had arrived...we headed back to Harry Potter land and walked into the wand show in Olivander’s - my 8yo daughter’s favourite part of the day as she was selected to be fitted out with a wand and the actor playing Olivander was absolutely fantastic. We lined up for the forbidden journey again and got on in about 50 minutes.By 6pm with rain still falling we called it a day and headed to Mos Burger at Universal City Walk for some cheap and easy dinner before strolling back to our accommodation at the Universal Port Hotel to bed.As we had planned the trip a while out I had purchased some cheap Harry Potter costumes from eBay for the kids to wear and it turned out to be a fantastic idea as both the kids were called up to be part of a magic show in Hogsmeade and my daughter was again selected for the Olivander’s show.They were also asked to pose for many photos with people during the day which they thought was fantastic and apparently according to my daughter may her World Famous!! Which for an 8 year old is a big deal.I think DisneySea and Disneyland are better value parks and the FASTPASS there makes things easier and more fair for everyone - USJ on the other hand really is only worthwhile if you spare willing to throw plenty of money at it. That being said we had a fantastic time and definitely ticked that one off the list."
237,A wonderful theme park for everyone ,"I booked a ticket to USJ on Klook (try to book on a weekday if possible) and since it was a Saturday, I expected the long queue, so I was there 10 minutes before it opened up. First mission, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. I followed the attraction and ended up riding most of the rides, as I went there solo, so I could use the single rider lane. So the waiting wasn't really that bad for me, except for the Jurassic Park the ride (40 minutes queuing for a less than 1 min ride). Since I went there in November, they have already started their winter special, and boy oh boy, it was really special. Don't miss the Harry Potter Winter Special and the Crystal Night Parade. I suggest go for the Crystal first, then run to Harry Potter. The show for Harry Potter will repeat every 15 minutes for 2 hours. And for the show, the language is in English, so fret not for those non-Japanese speaking tourist.Food for halal traveller can be tricky, but I found a pizza parlour that serves non-meat pizza and it was delicious. Overall, don't miss USJ in Autumn. It would be better if I can't understand Japanese."
238,Theme park,Been here several time already. Always greeted with crowded people. A must place to be also when in Osaka
239,Not my thing. I think it is much too costly for value.,I feel like I would have enjoyed universal a whole lot more if it wasn’t so hot. Especially when there was what felt like limited shaded areas. If I was made of ice I would have melted to a puddle. The place itself seems small compared to universal Orlando and LA even with the inclusion of Harry Potter world.Rides also arnt made for chubby people.My fav part of the day though was the Terminator 2 3D/4d movie. Even though it was in Japanese it was still great to watch.
240,Excellent fun!,Went here as a family of 4 for Christmas Day. We Pre bought royal vip fastpass. Very expensive but well worth it. We had timed entry to the top rides and only waited a few minutes to ride when the actual queues were 2 hours long!!! Very festively decorated. We had turkey dinner at the broomsticks all very nice. We had a great Christmas
241,Must buy fast pass ,"Universal Studios Japan is one of the most visited attractions in Osaka. Best attractions are Harry Potterand the Forbidden Journey, The Flying Dinosaur"
242,Bring a lot of patience!!,"My wife and I visited USJ as we had a bit of time on our hands and fancied a bit of fun. It’s quite confusing as to what is open and covered on a standard ticket. The park itself was lacking in rides and many of the attractions we went to were just a bit too dated, just like when they opened in the nineties. It’s very expensive and the atmosphere if you don’t have children is just a bit flat. I know theme parks largely cater to families but if you don’t fall into that category what’s on offer is just a bit stale."
243,Expensive but fun day out,"We arrived at 9.30am (normal entry opening time) the entry was jam packed and people were everywhere, but the staff were efficient and lovely. I would recommend going to Lawsons' just after getting of the train to grab snacks and lunch as they have a great variety which is fresh and healthy but also at a great price.We headed straight to Harry Potter and were able to get on the rides there within 30 minutes each. The trip around the studio was fun however, line up/queue times were what we spend the bulk of the day doing. If you can afford it get the express pass available. You could actually spend a couple of days here if you have the time. We all agreed that the best ride was Hollywood Dream the ride, this also goes backwards but had an extended wait time.All in all a great day."
244,Long hot day,"It was a good decision to get the one day pass via online as it saved a lot of waiting time to get into USJ.  It was a Thursday which was supposed to be less crowded but it was still packed with people even though it was raining for the whole day. Bought the express pass. Even though it’s quite costly, it can really save a lot of time for the rides.  Harry Potter ride was the most enjoyable ride. The express pass does not allow re-entry so we went to queue for another ride. Waiting time was closed to an hour. Minion ride was quite good too. Spider-Man ride was so-so. Quite disappointed with the terminator show. Overall it’s an enjoyable trip, minus the rain."
245,Must buy the express pass!,"Before you enter the park , they need to check your bag very detail. You are not allow to bring food, drinks, some camera and video equipment and a lot of other rules. You should check at the website. The park interior is so cute and pretty for christmas. A lot of ride is challenging for adult than disneyland. Before you come check the schedule carefully. May be because we don’t come on peak day the park close earlier and there’s no night parade. They only have christmas show not parade which make me feel dissapointed at this point."
246,Liked it more than I thought I would!,"We visited in early September, midweek and apparently outside of school holidays but still packed especially with local teenagers. Long queues for popular rides especially Harry Potter Forbidden Journey and Jurassic Park Flying Dinosaur. Within half hour of opening the Harry Potter ride had a 2hr wait. Its probably worth considering the Express Pass if you’re particularly keen on these more popular rides (although it then makes it a pretty expensive day). The Flying Dinosaur ride was closed for unscheduled maintenance, poor communication around if/when it would reopen was frustrating (“come back in 30mins for update” - it was shut for over 2hrs). There’s limited shade for many of the queues so take hat/fan/sunscreen for hot summer days. Some of the rides are showing their age (e.g. Jaws, Terminator 3D). All shows are in Japanese only, obviously harder to follow if you don’t speak the language but the action is still entertaining. Hollywood Dream was good, Jurassic Park The Ride, Space Fantasy and Spider-Man were also worth doing. With hindsight we probably wouldn’t bother with the Flight of the Hippogriff or the Terminator show. For most rides you can cut wait times considerably by taking the single rider queue. In some cases our wait time was reduced by 30mins or more and sometimes we got on the same ride together anyway. Waterworld show was much better than Terminator (partly because the latter started >30mins later than scheduled, for no apparent reason). Plenty of food offerings but what we saw looked pricey and not particularly appetizing, long queues around lunchtime and hard to find a table too. We had a big breakfast before we went then made it through the day with drinks bought from vending machines."
247,Long waits,"Visited USJ in late November.  I was contemplating whether to buy fast pass. However, due to the high cost, i have decided to give up the idea. Arrived USJ before it opened. Waited outside for almost an hr before we are allowed in. Once in, we proceeded to the popular rides first. To our surprise, though there's queue, we did not wait long to get on the rides. On average, we waited for an hour or less to get on the rides."
248,A wonderful 2-days in USJ!,"It's not just western movie themed. If you're lucky, you might encounter Anime-themed attractions (sadly seasonal). Check their website for anime special rides and plan accordingly. You'll definitely enjoy Harry Potter. In fact, I suggest you book for 2 days, 1 for just Harry Potter and another for the rest of Universal."
249,Beautiful tour,We bought the twilight day pass (available after 3pm). This is  discounted from the normal day pass.As a family of 3 the savings do add up. Also good value in the summer as the park was open till 2100. You also get the cooler weather in the evenings so ideal for toddlers or young children. We got to do 3 areas. Also saw the parade. Prebook rides in certain sections to save on the queques. Also if you skip the parade the queques are almost non existent after 2000. The service was excellent and we felt really welcomed by all the park attendants
250,Pleasantly surprise but as expected not the cheapest,"We went for the whole day and got an express pass package.  The express pass was very expensive, but The ride times were well split up and made the day very relaxing to get around.  It gave us plenty of time.  We only speak english, but everything was easy to understand and most of the staff spoke some english, but all were very helpful and friendly, so full credit to them.  Definitely worth the trip if you are in osaka.  Easy to get a train from anywhere.  You need the whole day if you want to go on rides."
251,Just Superb !,"Christmas in Tokyo had served up plenty of carols and Christmas cheer, but I’d missed out on a traditional Christmas lunch. I was at KFC that day (yep, it’s a thing; look it up). But it felt super Christmassy at Hogsmeade – cold weather, wreaths, hot butter beer - and a full, traditional Christmas meal, followed by treacle pudding at The Three Broomsticks! Merry Christmas, Harry."
252,RECOMMENDED ATTRACTIONS AT USJ,"This place is pretty amazing, BUT the wait for the lines, even on a weekday is quite desperate. The local people have amazing patience, the cost of the express pass was exorbitant, so we only did about four rides in the day.Very well organised of course, and being near Halloween, the best part was watching all the visitors, dressed up they made the day entertaining."
253,Family Day Out,"1. Remember entrance ticket fee is a separate ticket from Express ticket fee.2. Do get your express ticket (I chooses 4 ride) it saves you tons of time queuing. 3. If you are not getting the express ticket, then separate from your group of friends and take the single lane instead.4. You can bring empty water bottle inside to refill water in the park. No outside food allowed. 5. Organise which ride you want to go first then move from there, instead of running back and forth. It saves your energy. 6. Not enough cash to buy those cute souvenir or dine in restaurant? You can use credit card.7. There a small Q beside the Harry Potter shop nearby the giant 🌲, you get to visit the experience how Ollivanders in Diagon Alley chooses the wand. Surprise? He will select a random person from the crowd and gave out a wand. ——USJ need to change or upgrade the ride : Spider-Man / The Jaws. It’s not exciting.There are people smoking around the kids area or dinosaurs park area."
254,Best!!!,Always a great place to go with the family. Some rides can be a bit of a wait but there is always something to do!
255,Great experience - but crazy expensive,"If you plan to go USJ be prepared be to bore by it as most explanation are in Japanese and you are not sure what to expect or what’s next. So you can only guess as you go along. And worst of all, no re-entry is allowed which was not clearly stated!"
256,Good experience,"We came to USJ on the eve of Halloween and it was very crowded (not sure if it was more than usual). But besides that we had a great time exploring the park and taking various rides. A highlight (and the main reason) for me to visit USJ was the Harry Potter attraction. It was particularly special at night when the lights were turned on. What I really liked about USJ was that there were ample benches around if you got tired walking and wanted to rest for abit. What would be nice is if there were more English translation for the attractions. Tip: if possible, buy your tickets online so you skip the long queue at the ticket booth. It will save you at least half an hour. If you are a tourist and buy enough merchandise to claim back tax, be prepared for a VERY long queue. At the end of a long day, we were exhausted, hungry and not prepared for the super long queue to claim back tax! (It took at least 45 mins.) This is no fault of USJ though, the staff tried to get through the line as fast as possible but the time taken was simply due to the number of tourists. Just a heads up incase this is useful for anyone."
257,"Very nice, but a lot of people.","We took our children (aged 6 and 8) to USJ on a Tuesday in early October and had the most wonderful day. We booked tickets online and arrived at around 11am. There were no lines for entry at that time and we went straight through. I'm glad that we didn't arrive earlier. We had read that the lines for rides were long, so we weren't surprised that we had to wait a while for some of the attractions. Overview of some of the rides that we went on:- Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey: Easily the best ride that we went on. We lined up for 35 minutes at 11:45am but we managed to ride it another three times without a queue at 6:30 pm! - Minion Mayhem: We lined up for around 45 minutes. I thought it was pretty average and not worth the wait but the kids enjoyed it.- Spiderman: Another crazy long wait and they hide the queue around corners. Not worth it if you have young kids. - Jaws: Exciting little river ride during which the host pretends to shoot her gun at sharks. 6-year-old LOVED it.-Jurassic Park Ride: Holy Moly. I was expecting a flat river ride with a few 'scary' dinosaurs and a bit of a wave at the end. I was NOT expecting the very steep ascent and rollercoaster drop that preceded that wave. EEEEEK!- Flight of the Hippogriff: Quick little rollercoaster (long queue). Kids loved it.- Snoopy ride: Nice for little kids- not worth waiting in a big queue for.- Elmo Skateboard: Our kids LOVED this one. Queue was never long.- Elmo(?) Cars: Very slow kiddy 'racing' courses. There is one for 3-5 year olds and another one for older kids. Our 6-year-old loved it."
258,Amazing day but 2 rude staff spoilt the experience ,"We arrived at 7am prepared to wait in the queue until gates opened at 8:30am. They opened just after 7:30am!! I’m not sure why? I asked a staff member but their English is, typically, very limited and they said no we open at 8:30am. Anyway, we managed to ride HP & the forbidden forest twice, the Hippogriff ride and the Jaws ride all before 8:30am!! HP and the forbidden forest is the best ride I’ve ever been on and would recommend going there straight away as queuing times got up to 120 mins later in the day."
259,"With Strategic Planning, an Amazing Experience","We'd already been to Universal Studios in LA, so this may have affected my rating as I'd already experienced this before. If I hadn't, I am predicting my rating might be higher. It was very similar to the US version we went to, except everything was in Japanese, at times hard to understand (especially for kids). When we first arrived, we sent straight for the Harry Potter ride. It stopped half way through and we were left hanging for 2-3 ?  minutes, luckily we weren't upside down. However, the staff were amazing, and let us ride a second time without having to line up. The Terminator experience was amazing, I loved how they used a combination of 3D with people actors. Even though it was in Japanese, we could understand what was happening, it was very well articulated.Food is very expensive! For a budget holiday, eat before you go, go early and then leave. We were there for about 3 hours. A fun family experience."
260,Exactly whet you think it will be,"I went to Universal Studios Japan with friends on a Monday which was one of the most busy days to go. There were loads of people at the park but we managed to get a universal express pass 4 - flying dinosaur. I would advise getting an express pass with the most popular rides. I found that the most popular rides included the flying dinosaur (3 hours), Hollywood dream the ride (2 hours). Harry Potter and the forbidden journey (2 hours) and Hollywood dream the ride backdrop (2.5 hours). Now with the express pass out the way let’s talk about the rides. I started my day by riding Harry Potter and the Forbidden journey. With my express pass I had no wait time and they gave me the whole car to myself. This is a phenomenal ride which uses screen to make you feel like your going much faster then you really are. The story is well crafted and even with it being in Japanese you will understand everything with ease. I then decided to ride Jaws and Jurassic Park. I didn’t have the express pass for these rides but only waited 20-30 min each and was the longest we waited on the day. Once we finished Jaws I was very disappointed with the ride. If you want the experience then go for it but it is has a Long wait line then I wouldn’t bother. Jurassic Park the ride was very similar to the ones at other parks. It is well done with a refreshing drop down into the pool at the end. Once we finished that we did Spider-Man we went into the single rider line since the main line was an hour and we only waited around 20 minutes. We were on separate cars but was worth it with the massive drop in wait time. The ride was very average but worth doing. After all these rides were done I started to do the main roller coasters. I got onto Hollywood dream the ride which was a quite intense roller coaster but was very enjoyable. They let you choose music to play while your on the roller coaster and was definitely one of the highlights of my day. After that Hollywood dream the ride backdrop had a 2 hour wait time. Unfortunately this was the only ride I couldn’t do on the day because I was not prepared to wait 2 hours. Finally after we went to a few average shows and did the final rides I used my express to get onto the flying dinosaur. This ride has a few inversions and faces you to the ground to make you feel like your flying. This was a very intense ride but was the most enjoyable at the same time. Even though your facing the ground out of your seat for the majority of the ride you feel decently safe with your feet locked in as well. This ride is for the thrill seekers and I would’ve 100% regretted it if I didn’t go. Overall amazing park with amazing rides for all age groups. Lots of shows to go to and plenty of restaurants with unique food/drink."
261,Amazing park but just too crowded,"Easy access via Universal City Sta in Osaka. Not much fuss to enter if you have booked earlier and you need to show only the Tickets code. No outside food are allowed.The area and ride are larger than US Singapore and if you are without the Xpress tickets, you may have to wait between 60-90 min and will not finish the rides in a day.For the muslims, kinda hard to find halal food. If you can live on Churros for the day, it helps."
262,A big day out with something for everyone,"Kind of pricey, with more extra ticket for express pass, which is more expensive than the entry ticket.But, overall, for the first timer at Universal Studio, had a nice time here with so many worlds inside!"
263,The most amazing amusement park ever !!!!!!!😍😍😍💙💙💙,"We bought a ticket to the park so we could go during the day for a bit and then we left when they closed the park for an hour and rentered with the party entry ticket. Fun to walk around and see all the decorations for Christmas. The live entertainment was fun to watch from a distance but we did not stand in that area for very long as we wanted to experience the park.It was cold and crowded, but we were dressed for it. I did buy a Jaws Hat and would have liked to have the royalties on the hats as they sold thousands of them! They do keep your head warm!It was crowded but we worked through the crowds and got on the rides that we wanted to. The Minions and Harry Potter was where the big crowds were. The fireworks were fun and it was great that the park was open all night! Overall we had a great time. We had my niece who is 27 so 3 adults. Glad we went in during the day and had fun at night! Only giitch was the tight crowd pushing and shoving toward Harry Potter when the fireworks were over. We enjoyed it!"
264,Best Universal Studio,"This was the second visit for my husband and I. Last time we had limited time as it was a port visit during a cruise. This time we were visiting in a group of 9 family members which was a lot of fun!The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was new since our last visit, and was fun even though not all of our party are fans of the boy wizard. You don't need to know much about the books or movies to enjoy the experiences in this part of the park.Line ups for some attractions were up to 2 hours long, but we did manage to find a few things with shorter wait times.There were plenty of food and drink options. We had lunch at Mel's Drive In and dinner at the Park Side Grille. The burger combos at Mel's Drive In were freshly made and good value. The Park Side Grille was a little overpriced for the size and quality of the meals.Overall it was a good experience and a fun day out. The night parade was a definite highlight."
265,A fun day,"Knowing how incredibly annoying japanese people can get when it comes to dumbly applying rules, I read them carefully in both English and Japanese the day before going to avoid any problem. Alas, they still managed to find something to nitpick about in my bag : my bottle of water, which apparently was oversized (no joke -,-). So they took it and thanks to them I got a heatstroke. I contacted the customer service but they don't care. Great. Never going there again."
266,Excellent and a must visit place for crazy rides,"Make sure to get an express pass ticket because there are long lines at Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and sometimes they only allow a certain group of people to come in here during peak hours even if you already have a ticket. The rides are also quite long so the express pass comes in handy"
267,Excellent experience,"I would recommend that you buy the tickets ahead of time to avoid the long line at the ticket booth. There is a line also entering the park and lining up at the popular rides takes 45 mins at least.  They are very organized so the waiting is not that bad.  There are many restaurants inside which sold good food.  The park is not as large as Universal Studios in LA, but it's big enough that you can try all the attractions all day."
268,Themepark is for everyone. Enjoy your day here!!! ,Today was my daughters 10th Birthday. I have patiently and methodically planned the days outing as a surprise which has been expensive and at times stressful with language barriers and pre paid tickets being absolutely compulsory. Last week we attempted to visit Disneyland and it was sold out. Long story but could not risk that happening on my daughters birthday today. But pre paid tickets and express passes once in Japan and without access to a printer or translator is not that easy. Be patient. Allow yourself lots of time to read all the reviews and tips on what you need. Don’t pounce on the first ticket sale you come across. Some do not allow an upgrade if you decide to get the express pass - whereas you may have got a package to include that with the ground pass. EXPRESS PASS IS A MUST. It’s the Business Class of Theme Park experience. Not in a conceited way but after spending biiiiig money on the bullet train and knowing it was going to be a 14hr day it was well worth being able to walk through without a queue. Ohhhhh it was well worth it! I’m still not entirely sure exactly what I paid for as I tried to get Express into something and it didn’t count and I thought I bought the top level Express but I really only wanted to make sure we got to Harry Potter without a queue. For that you only need an express pass if you are doing the rides. Diagon Alley is open to everyone so if you only want to walk through the castle and not do the simulated ride don’t worry about an Express pass or timed entry. It only takes about 5 mins. The staff at the park were fantastic. Well organised and friendly. My daughter had a birthday sticker we got at family services and everyone made a fuss when they spotted it. You do have to push your way through to get photos with characters as many adults line up and as they are dressed up so attract attention and get in front of the children. We got better at that as the day went on. Harry Potter world is great!! Definitely eat in the Hall!! What a fabulous set up. Find your way through the shops and see if there is a sorting hat etc. we got a little rushed as it was raining and cramped. The park is a great size to easily walk around many times in a day. Good level of rides and attractions for younger and older children.
269,Very good experience ,"We visit USJ on weekday, but always crowded. We booked advance entrance tickets together with 7 express pass from Klook website. We have got gift 5000Yen coupon per one person, where you can buy anythings from any USJ stores inside the park. That is really cool. Express pass make us save a lot of time for queuing. So, we can enjoy many rides."
270,Fun Family Day Out,"We regret not spending more than a day in USJ, as there were a lot to discover here that we were not able to.  Highly recommended to go for 2 days the least, or buy an express pass so that you do not have to line up and spend a minimum of 1.5 hours in line with the best rides that they have here (Harry Potter, Minions, etc).  Prices are just like the western universal studios, but hey, they will milk you out as much as possible, as expected.  Money grabbing dudes as they even ask for more money to have the best seat in the parade, which actually you can avoid paying by just being there earlier.  We enjoyed wasting our money here, so money well spent. ;-)  Kids were ecstatic!"
271,Very Expensive but kids loved it,"We visited on New Year's Eve and bought a pass for the day and the party that followed. The park is definitely similar to the US equivalents but a fun place to be and high quality! We went on the Jaws ride and it was fun. Of course it is all in Japanese but that is fine. After all you are in Japan. The Back Draft experience was fun for us but there is a lot of fire so if you have small children it may not be for you. Spiderman was very fun. Terminator 2 was okay but Spiderman is better if you have to make a choice. Sing the musical was okay but more so for kids. The Harry Potter ride was really fun but a lot of motion. My stomach was a little queasy but only for a short time. Great ride overall. Be sure that you understand whether the ride is open or not, We ignored a sign (or missed it) that said it was only a castle walk through and we waited in line a long time only to have no ride. We went later and it was outstanding! It would be nice if they had a fly over ride that had a big screen overview of Japan like California Disney has but alas, there is not one. Nice park and lots of good restaurant choices there as well. Expect Universal prices in the stores, but the restaurants were not overpriced as far as we were concerned. Of course we do not have children."
272,Not that fun,"We five intended to visit Univeral studio Japan on January 2nd. We knew that there would be very crowded so we would like to make sure that we could enjoy our rides without waiting very long.We bought 5 Royal Studio Pass via Govoyagin website. Firstly we couldn’t book. So we sent an e-mail directly to them. They got back to us and asked for our airplane tickets and hotel confirmation. After that they sent us an e-mail with a link to book the pass. It was pre-paid. And when we checked in at our hotel, our 5 Royal Studio Pass wrist bands were there. Very professional.These wrist bands gave us the most convenient way to enjoy USJ. We didn’t have to wait at all. There would be some rides that we had to go during the period of time and only one time for fast track such as Harry Potter,Minion  etc. The rest we could go as many times as we wanted like a fast track eg. Jaws, Spider man etc.Turkey legs were delicious here. We had a fun time."
273,Fun two days at Universal studios Japan,"Nice park to visit with kids. But you need express pass if you don't want to wait hours to ride the major attractions if you are travelling with young kids. The shows (Sing and Christmas were quite nice). Harry Potter part is a must, my kids loved it the ""magic"" wands... Also a lot of good places to eat and drink. Better balance than Disney in that aspect... I will come back again"
274,Harry Potter World Great,"We went there on a weekday in October with two young school aged kids and I thought I’d leave a few tips for others who may be visiting the park while in Osaka.   - Ticket purchase: buy them online in advance to save queuing up on the day.   - Consider using ‘direct-in’ with QR codes on your phone. If you have small children and have to use only your phone to enter, this isn’t an issue either, just make sure you display each QR for each child at the gate.   - If you have a Japanese friend, you can also ask them to help you order tickets through Lawson (Convenient store) and pay in any Lawson Loppi machine rather than ordering from Klook or Voyagin.   - If your birthday is a month before or a month after the planned visit day, you can get discount, though to get this discount you have to go into their official web page which is in Japanese so this might not be easy. If you speak Japanese or have a friend who does, this could save you a bit of money. We saved 500 yen per ticket (family members are also entitled to the same discount).   - Express Pass: choose the date/day of your visit and you might not need this. We considered spending £700 on the day pass plus Express pass 4 for four of us and in the end we didn’t and it worked out more than ok. (More details as below)   - Pick a normal weekday and make sure it isn’t a local holiday etc and check the crowd forecast before booking your tickets  - Arrive early because they often open earlier than the official opening time. We arrived at 7.10 for 8.30 opening and the gate actually opened 45 min earlier than expected so we managed to get in before 8am, gaining the valuable 45min to make a head start! When we went, the park was a lot less busy in the morning but as the day went on it was busier and by 1pm it was double the amount of people or more so use your morning time well!   - Use your lunch time well, eat early or eat much later as people tend to go to take time away from going to attractions around this time. Strictly speaking no food from outside is allowed, and they do indeed check your bags from time to time, but you can sneak in a couple of rice balls or sausage in your jacket pockets (there is Lawson around the corner) to save you both the money and time to queue up for food at lunch time.   - Use the board to check the waiting times for different attractions and be flexible in your plan   - Take bottles to fill up water with so that valuable time isn’t spent on queuing at a cafe to get drinks etc  - Check out the time for the parade and be at the start of the parade at least 30 min before to get a good spot - this is particularly important for those with small children as they can’t get a good view with too many people in front of them. The leaflet shows the route for the parade.  - Harry Potter area: Previously you needed time entry pass to this area but these days it is a free  entry area unless it is exceptionally busy. We had no wait time at all to get on Forbidden Journey first thing in the morning by just making a dash to the area (with two young kids too!) and going straight in.   - Take disposable water proofs from 100 yen shop so that you don’t get wet when you are on some of the rides!   - Don’t miss out the castle light up at Harry Potter area! It was meant to be at 18.55 (for the first showing) but it actually started at 18.30 presumably because there were a lot of people gathering already. This is in front of the castle, in the open. I would recommend you to get there at least 30 min early but if not, note you don’t need to be right at the front of the crowd; most of the entertainment is the light effects on the castle which you can see from quite far back so don’t panic if you don’t manage to get there early to get to the front of the crowd.   - Wait time: remember that the wait time sign is often overestimated. This is the times and time we spent queuing at each attractions we went:  7:55am HP Forbidden Journey - no wait time 8.35am Jurassic Park the Ride estimated wait time 25 min but got on the ride in 10min  8.55am Jurassic Park the Ride (kids wanted to go on it again) same again 10min  10am Sing on (show) Got there 15 min early and we got in ok  11.15am Minion Ride - estimated wait time 50 min but it was only 30 min in the end  12.45am Amazing Spider-Man estimated wait time 75 min but got on the ride in 40 min Had Late lunch 14:00 am Went to get a good spot for the parade staring at 14.30 am. Already people taking up their spots and regretted not coming sooner.  We spent the rest of the day visiting different areas covering different street shows etc.   My final and perhaps one of most important tips that I can give to families with children visiting USJ... Do take your kids to toilet before queuing for each attraction! Despite taking kids to the restroom regularly, we still got ourselves in a situation whereby one of our kids went, mummmm I need to go to the toilet half way through a very long queue with no option of going back!! Luckily the queue moved quickly and she managed to hold on till the end of the ride, but it was pretty stressful!!   Oh and have a chat with kids to decide on a memorable location to meet in case you get separated. We decided that beside the dinosaur at the entrance of Jurassic Park area was a good place to remember at the start :)   We enjoyed our visit to USJ (though it was VERY tiring lol) and hope you will too!!"
275,We got to come back !!!,"Went here on 31 Dec 2019, family trip with 2 small children (8&5).As any major tourist attraction in high season, it is very crowded. Everything from entrance, rides, restaurants and toilets needs queue.As a very large park, USJ managed well with the crowds. But unfortunately is very tiring to get from one place to another.We entered and went directly to Harry Potter ride inside the Hogwarts castle. As a huge fan, almost all of the things in the HP world brings a smile to my face (but butterbeer is overrated to my muggle taste). Next to Jurassic Park, had lunch which is expensive and tasted average, but no other option. My wife who is an adrenaline junkie loves the Flying Dinosaur. Using single line, we didn’t wait too long for her. While waiting, the kids enjoyed My Friend Dinosaur parade. Then we all went for Jurassic Park the ride and got a little bit wet and cold (winter, duh).After Jurassic, went to Snoopy area, and queue to flying snoopy, but as the Express pass holder entered and entered the line, the reguler line didn’t move at all. We then gave up for the flying snoopy and went indoor for the snoopy roller coaster, a little queue there. My little boy enjoyed Elmo’s car. Then we went up the carousell but after a 10 mins delay, they announced that it was broken and we were asked to dismount.Then we went to watch SING theatre, quite entertaining and a good rest as it is sitting down for around 10 mins.Unfortunately we just found out that on that day, the park closed at 5. We misread the info that the park is open for 26 hours. Indeed it is open till midnight (fireworks show) but after 5PM, you will need another ticket to enjoy the park after hours.So after finding out that the park is closing, we only got the chance to ride one more which is Minions Race, just a spinning ride.Overall, the park is very enjoyable eventhough crowded. All of the staff is very friendly and making the guest experience very enjoyable.Recommended for everyone, and if given the chance I will come back again with my family as we only rode less that 25% of all of the rides."
276,Usj tips! Ride everything without Express pass,"This is a detailed review and ideally I would have given a score of 4.5, as there are some issues.  Ultimately my journey in USJ was so wonderful at the end that it is a very personal, 5-star rating.First of all, I strongly recommend the 2-day pass (not express).  If you're tight for time during your Japan stay, you can go for the 1-day express.  My friend and I did a lot in 1-day without express (8:30-20:00), but it is impossible to do all of it without express.  However, the reason I recommend 2-days is because, for me personally, my time in USJ felt like a lifetime.  To be able to return for the second day really enhances your experience.  Second, definitely arrive early.  I won't guarantee any gimmies if you do, because even at 8:30 there was a 50+ minute wait for the minion ride, which appeared to be the most popular ride during our 2-day visit.  Though this is preferable to the 120 minutes wait during the day.  Also, try to stay until the end.  The park has a different feel at the night-time; looks beautiful; and when you reflect on the 12+ hours that have passed, you really do feel like you're a part of the place. Third, beware of lunchtime! This is a big complaint that I have in USJ.  Waiting for rides is one thing, but you can overcome this with a phone and battery bank, or a nintendo DS/handheld console.  Waiting for food is, in my opinion, not acceptable.  This is something they definitely need to address.  We were there at the beginning of August, so lunchtime isn't just about eating, it's about shelter.  You can smuggle in a couple sandwiches in the bottom of a deep bag, but in the end, you'll need a bite to eat at some point, and if you're doing a 8:30-20:00 stay, you're going to need a rest! I can't offer tips here, the diners were jam-packed anytime between 12:00-15:00.  I'll I can say is - expect it.Fourth and finally, do as much as possible! If you do the 2-days, definitely watch some of the parades, the water shows (minions and the stunt Waterworld show).  Mix it up a little! The rides are fun, but there's plenty other attractions on offer.  Some attractions are intended for kids and family, but the adults will still enjoy those attractions to!Overall, in my 25-day trip across Japan, the 2 days spent in Osaka's Universal Studios Japan, is one of my favourite memories!"
277,Heaps of great fun. ,"Everything in Japan is crowded, that's just the way Japan is. That is why I did my best to plan my Universal trip so that I could miss as much of the crowd as possible. There are estimated crowd calendars online, so I made sure to line up my visit with a day that was the least crowded (in this case it was a Tuesday in May). I also made sure to buy my ticket online and line up before Universal even opened. It probably saved me from spending a good extra hour in line. The park was fairly quiet for a good couple hrs after I arrived, and even when it did begin to crowd it was never super overwhelming.Because I avoided the big crowds, I had a ton of fun. It's just like the Universal park in other parts of the world with a few minor exceptions. They love minions, so minions were everywhere. Wearing cute, furry character headbands are also a big thing over here so be prepared to see quirky headwear in every gift shop. They also celebrate holidays even after the holiday is over. I went at the end of may, and yet everything was still Easter themed.  Minor things like this is what makes Universal Osaka unique, and I absolutely adored it."
278,Awesome Park for the price,"I bought a 1.5-day pass. I get in from 3.00 pm on Wednesday. The studio closes at 10.00 pm. The next day I got up super early to stand in the line for Harry Potter. By Thursday evening, I could finish all of the activities, except for the flying dinosaurs. No food allowed. Very fun!"
279,"The park is too greedy, very long waiting time !","Getting to the park by the trains from downtown Namba is very straight forward, but do ask the station staffs properly before you board. You really do not want to get on the wrong train, its probably going to be another adventure.First, understand this is one of the most visit themepark in this part of the world.So if you going for all the interesting rides, get the express pass (which will cost you double of the entrance fee)Park is incredibly nicely laid out, get a english brochure once you enter, or just google the park the night before.Highlight of the park : Harry porter, Minion World, Jurassic park.Harry porter apparently have a queue time to enter, and also a even longer queue time for the famed ride. The time i went (weekday) i didnt queue to enter but i also didnt took the famed ride (3yr old too short :/)As we went with our little young jedi, we didnt manage to take any of the rides, and almost all of the rides have an average 60mins wait time.We are only able to take some kiddo rides and there is a indoor playground at the Universal wonderland, which we spent an hour for the little one to play.There are a good range of food stalls and drinks available throughout the park and surprisingly its quite fairly priced.We went around, never queue for any of the rides, just walked the whole park, catch some shows (aircon!) played abit at the indoor playground, had our meals, drank our butterbeer, and it ready it took us 9 hours.We didnt stay for the night parade as we didnt want to jostle with the big crowd. So now your turn to grab those Butterbeer and Magic Wands:)"
280,"Amazing, as expected","When considering going to Japan, you should put Osaka in the travel itineraries, and one full day to visit Universal Studios Japan.  Especially if you or your kid is a Harry Potter fan."
281,Fun place for cinema lovers. ,It is adviseable to visit Universal Studios on a Wednesday and come as early as possible to avoid the crowd. They have a lot of thrilling rides and attractions. Don't miss the Harry Potter ride! The only thing that I didn't like about Universal Studios is that it's very loud and crowded.
282,One Full Day with Kids,"Booked through  Klook and as always purchase and use was easy. just pay, download voucher and scan on the way in. we went on a weds before summer holidays and it was busy but not crazy. arrived at 8.15 and ways let in about 30 mins later. went straight to Harry potter ride and walked all the way through and onto the ride. most of the rides had a queue between 50-80 mins after that but we found they were often a bit shorter than the advertised time and rides like Harry potter, Spiderman and minions have a lot of posters and videos which keep you occupied.plenty of water dispenser to fill up your bottles, but could do with some more shaded spots and healthier food options."
283,Better than L.A !!!,"We were there at 8:30am and the lines were okay for an off peak day. The problem was that unlike Singapore, they bag check everyone. So once the doors opened, it was another 30mins to get in. Unfortunately the Hollywood section was closed which was really disappointing. The lines were insane - even on an off peak day when the park was at 15% capacity lines were still over an hour. We had a fast pass 4 and that was worth it, the rides we used it on had 60-70min lines and we lined up for less than 10mins each time. There are minimal places to sit down around the park and I got told off quite a few times by staff for sitting on a garden bed edge or on a curb due to the lack of seating. I have an injury so the lack of seating was a real issue for me. Be aware everything is in Japanese - none of the rides or 3D sections have any English parts. This means terminator, Harry Potter, backdraft, Spider-Man and jaws have NO ENGLISH at all so you have to just enjoy the ride with no idea what’s actually being said. It was good fun for a day but at close to $200 AUD each for entry and a fast pass, the Singapore one is much better."
284,Worth a visit if you are a Harry Potter fan,"We went there in June on a weekday, purposely chose a weekday as we thought might not be so crowded but we were wrong. It was equally crowded but at least quite orderly.After reading some reviews, we decided to purchase the universal pass for 4 rides and glad we did that, else i doubt we will enjoy the park as much as all popular rides are too crowded. We finished all the assigned rides and only managed to take a few more kiddy rides and we decided to call it a day, because other rides the queuing is at least 60mis or more, where my daughter cannot take it.Otherwise it is still a very pleasant and enjoyable trip. It is a huge park where we got lost a few times. Also having difficulties finding toilets. But the staff are very helpful and guide us along.Will still recommend for people who are going to Osaka to visit the park once and must get the universal pass to save time."
285,Take one day or not enough time.,"We enjoyed ourselves at the Park. It was Halloween and the parade stopped for a few minutes for everyone to dance along, great fun, although the parade was a little short."
286,the most horrible experience in Japan ever,"We spent the whole day here and still couldn’t get through everything.  The place was so much bigger than expected!Like all theme parks, you need to be prepared to wait, otherwise pay extra for the express pass.  Here are a few tips:- plan where you want to go and stick to it!- get there early for the Harry Potter ride.  Hogwarts castle was awesome - Don’t bother with Curious George- Get the unlimited drinks pass. That allows you unlimited soft drinks and coffee at 7 different restaurants.  I bought just one for the whole family :).  - go there when the weather is cooler because there’s not much shelter outsideThe place was super clean and like every else in Japan , everyone was courteous and friendly. So if you and your family are the patient type, you’ll have a great time here."
287,A park full with excitement and fun!,"Entrence price is a bit in the higher end (app. 8.500 yens) but it’s sure worth it. The rides are free of charge once you’re in and even though you just want to do a walk in the park and not try out rides - the detail work is very impressive and makes it worth visiting anyway !! Especially the wizard world is dreamy, definitely the top area of them all !! (Butter beer was delicious regardless of form regular/hot)Season/TicketsWe visited in November so definitely out of the main season so neither had to wait long in entrence line, nor did we need the extra free tickets to the wizard world people have been writing about - because there weren’t that many crowds. We also bought the tickets at the main gate but in high season I’d recommend to buy them in advance, the ticket-scan line should be shorter and faster. RidesFor the main and most popular rides we waited at a maximum of 30minutes (even though the signs said 40-50min). We had the Standard tickets so it was more than descent waiting time knowing how long these lines can be. If your main purpose is to do the rides or you’re visiting during prime season I’d recommend the Express ticket which allows one to skip the line through the fast track."
288,Amusement theme park with so much fun.,"I’m an exchange student here so me and my friends decided to come for Halloween Horror Nights. During the day we had a lot of fun with all the rides and attractions. The crowds weren’t even that bad until nightfall had come. The traumatic experience of mine happened when we did the cult of chucky horror attractions. The haunted house itself was not scary but the bullying and abuse I experienced by a staff member. Most of the staff members I have seen were very cheerful but she was not. I thought it would be funny to take a short snapchat video of a jump-scare to send to my friends back home and then enjoy the rest of the attraction. But she just started yelling and screaming at me which sent me into a panic. I exited out of snapchat right away which automatically deleted it but she kept screaming at me to the point where my body froze and I started to shake really bad. I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t delete something that didn’t exist. She just continued screaming at me until she finally yelled at me to put my phone away which was what I was trying to do from the beginning. I have a history of childhood abuse so this is why I cannot handle someone freaking out at me. After that, I just wanted to leave. Days afters, I cannot remember her face but I still hear her voice screaming at me. The rides were fun but it’s too expensive to have to experience abuse and bullying."
289,Good rides and attractions,"You know you're in for a busy day when it takes 80 minutes just to get in the park entrance. Once inside the crowds just continued and there was very little respite anywhere. The theming inside is one of the best I have seen in a park, with areas to cater for all ages and tastes, and the rides are as good as you would expect from Universal - but there must be a point when they decide that there are too many people in one place, and the day we were there we went well beyond that."
290,A huge theme parks and it took 1 full-day to discover,"There are various zones such as Harry Poter, Minion, Spider-Man, Jaws and Jurassic Park, and there are so many rides available for various age groups. The most interesting ride for me was The Flying dinosaur, but the waiting line was really long, so I was sad. If you buy Express Pass, you don't have to line up, but it's expensive. Therefore, To wait less I recommend waiting in one person line even if you have a party. And I recommend you to go for popular attractions like Harry Potter first. It was so much fun that I wanted to go to osaka every time. If you go to Osaka, please go to Universal Studios:)"
291,Not great - bland experience,"We got 1.5 days pass which allow entrance from 3pm on Day 1 & Full day on Day 2.  Day 1 was Monday, and there were a long queue to get enter. Despite being weekday & non school holiday / public holiday, it was really crowded.  The popular rides waiting time was 100 mins, but waiting time reduced later in the afternoon.  Day 2 was less crowded than day 1.The pupular areas are Harry Potter & Minion.  Harry Potter 4D rides was the best with Dementors & Snitch games & whomping willow factored in the rides, we loved it so much that we went twice. If you're not adventures type, there is a separate queue just for castle tour.  Unfortunately, the characters speaks only Japanese, but still, highly recommended for Harry Potter Fan.  Best to get there at night, as you get to see the laser show in front of castle.Minion rides was cute.  Nobody can resist the charm of Minions.  Everyone either have the minion popcorn or minion soft toys or just minion shirts. Highly recommended the popcorn as it is way too cute to pass.As we visited in October, there was special Halloween event at night.  There were staffs dressed up as zombie walking on street & scaring the visitors.  There were  also many local (Japanese) visitors dressing up as zombie as well added to the whole experience & fun atmosphere for USJ."
292,Unkind workers,"Be sure to arrive early in the park as the lines go very long in the middle of the day. For foreigners it is best to buy the 1.5 day pass so you can explore the park more and take many pictures. Also it is advise to eat first before entering the park because the food is quite expensive inside if you are on the budget. Be sure not to miss the night parade and ride Hollywood dreams, flying dinosaur, and Harry Potter."
293,USJ,"It’s a great amusement park! Easily accessible using the Osaka Loop Line, so if you have a JR Pass, you can use JR trains for free.It’s got the same vibe as Hollywood and Orlando, and it’s got a great value!"
294,Great place! ,"Doing one's homework beforehand paid off. We stayed nearby to minimise travel time. We went on a Thursday (i.e. midweek) in a non-holiday period. We checked opening hours (said 8.30am - went about 8am and they were just letting people in anyway). Bought a ticket beforehand. Virtually no-one inside. Went straight to Harry Potter and did all rides with minimum queues. Could see it getting more crowded by the hour and very grateful we did all this. There are links online to a Japanese-language busy-ness predictor for the whole year, which I recommend taking a look at."
295,Well worth a visit!,Express pass tickets can easily cost 2 to 5 times the price of the regular day ticket (you still have to buy the day ticket!). Usually you can only use an express pass one time each for a select number of rides (depending on which express pass you get). You also can’t use an express pass until the time printed next to each ride on your express pass ticket has passed. This was not clearly explained at time of purchase and does not consider when you plan to leave.While the rides were fun and the express passes helped. I’m still not sure if it is worth paying several times more for a heavily capped express pass.
296,Similar to others in world but worth visiting,"Universal studios it was nearby the city. If you stay around Osaka station. It only take around 30 minutes to there.During summer holiday time the theme park soooo full, even we got the ticket we also need wait around 10-15 minutes to get inside Highly recommend purchase the fast pass, otherwise you may need to wait for 120-180 minutes for hot items such as spider-Man Harry Potter.Lucky I got the fast pass for those hot items.Theme park have some show around every 2 hours, the guest can watch the show and have fun together, especially the minion water show. So nice to have some water fun in that hot summer time."
297,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"This place sucks. First of all, it's very overpriced. The cost of general admission is more than Disneyland, and it fails to produce the magic of that park in any way. The cost of everything inside the park is also overpriced. The food is terrible and expensive, as is all the merchandise. A normal t-shirt is 3,600 yen! Even the souvenir coins are 200 yen to make (they are 100 yen everywhere else). It's a cash grab theme park and they try and milk you for every last coin. Secondly, it's overcrowded. We went on a Tuesday and the more popular rides still had 2 hour waiting times. You can bypass some of this by purchasing express passes, but those are over twice the cost of admission, which puts the cost at $160 per person. No thanks. Disney gives out free fast passes throughout the day; why can't this park do the same? There are queues for everything. Even getting something like ice cream or a drink is a 30 minute wait. It was a hot day when we visited, and there is a significant lack of shade. In fact, the only real shade is at the entrance. This doesn't make any sense. Or perhaps they want all of us to sweat more so that we buy more expensive drinks? The Harry Potter ride is good, as is the minions, but the rest is overrated. Speaking of Harry Potter, if you're hoping to purchase a wand, it will set you back 4900 yen. Butterbeer is 1300 yen with a souvenir plastic glass. Stuffed animals are 4000 yen, and any kind of clothing, well, you get the idea."
298,Go on weekdays,"To be honest I'm not the amusement park type.  However my girls are big time Potterheads so there was no way they were going to allow a trip to Osaka without visiting USJ.  We didn't purchase any special passes, showed up around an hour before opening, and headed straight to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.  The line was very reasonable. Unfortunately this wasn't the case with the remaining attractions that day.  Good time over all though."
299,"Really fun, even without taking the rides!","最好玩機動遊戲是 1. Forbidden Journey  （要排55分鐘）好好好玩，若想再玩，建議在夜晚7點去玩，沒有人排隊直接入去玩  2. Jurassic Flying Dragon （要排50分鐘）好刺激及恐怖，離心力好大，大膽人一定要玩 3. Jurrasic The Ride (要排15分鐘）好好玩，但會濕身4. Spiderman (要排15分鐘）要帶3D眼鏡，都幾好玩，有時間可一試餐廳及小食1. 哈利波特村餐廳食dinner set, 好好味2.哈利波特村小食 chorros 可一試 3. Backdraft 對面的咖啡店的橙朱古力奶，好好飲，有橙嘅果肉  若可留待夜晚便一定要看Harry Potter Hogwarts Light Show, 很好看。至於Night parade本人認為不太好看，最好看是第1 part嘅Harry Potter, 之後三part都不太吸引。"
