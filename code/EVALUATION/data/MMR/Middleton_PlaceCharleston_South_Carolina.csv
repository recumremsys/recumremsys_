0,Spacious historic rice plantation,"A beautiful place to walk and see the waterfront, ponds,  beautiful gardens, and statuary. There are horses, goats, and other farm animals. Reference to enslaved people was found in the rice mill and the freed slave's home.  A tour of the owner's historic home is an additional fee."
1,Absolutely Stunning,A glimpse into the past with expansive and lovely grounds.   Ponds and fountains with alligators on banks.
2,Loved our quick stop,The gardens at Middleton Place are beautiful beyond words. So many different flowers and plants to see. The Butterfly Lakes were really cool! As were the alligators and turtles basking in the sun. They also have a farm with many different animals. This is a fun place for families with younger children as well as elder.
3,Great in so many ways,"Beautiful place,  great food at the restaurant and a wonderful experience all round. Lots of wild life. We saw turtles, herons, an alligator, peacocks, geese, ducks, lizards, and more. The  Middleton oak is amazing,estimated near 1000 years old."
4,Love the Reflecting Pools,"Middleton Place and Gardens are beautiful, historic and informative.  Stroll the National historic gardens,  tour the plantation house, lunch at the restaurant and listen to the many docents who are highly knowledgeable on topics such as slavery, barrel making, history, spinning of yarn and other aspects of plantation life.  It is a very pastoral setting with sheep grazing, horses and carriage rides,  learning about rice production and of course beautiful views of the Ashley River. I would highly recommend a visit for visitors of all ages."
5,Three Tours at  Middleton Place  Plantation: Formal Gardens; Beyond the Fields(Slavery) ; Reserved House Tour,"Had a great ride through the rice fields and around the waters (ponds, rivers, etc.  Saw an alligator, large turtle in our path, blue herons and snowy egrets.  Guide was great, horse was fine.  It was 98°, but riding in the shade with a gentle breeze was a great experience.The equestrian facility is “to die for” with beautiful, well maintained dressage arenas, an event course, hosting a foxhunt, stadium jumps.  I highly recommend!"
6,Beautiful Grounds,"A must see. Absolutely beautiful grounds. Beautiful place to spend the morning or afternoon walking around the property. Take the tour inside the house and be sure to have lunch at the restaurant. It's 16 miles outside Charleston. We didn't have a car during our stay so we used Uber. May take little longer for driver to get there to pick you up, but it worked fine for us. Of course there are tours that take you there, but we prefer not being on someone else's time table."
7,Annual Mother/Daughter trip,"A beautiful and vast expanse of trees, flowers, ponds, elegant statues, cabins and acres and acres of manicured lawn. The rooms are large and comfortable, the setting unforgettable. Great for hikes, lounging around, and sipping wine."
8,Excellent place to visit,"Stunning gardens and view of the river. The history behind the property and family is truly fascinating. One artifact in the home was truly one-of-a-kind-a pass to get through the Union blockade written to a member of the family by President Abraham Lincoln. The second flank home is all that is left to tour, not the original house. However, I would still recommend visiting this gem."
9,Great Escape,"One immediately feels the peace and beauty of Middleton Place.  The large reflecting pool with its pair of graceful, white swans surrounded by flowering plants and trees with Spanish Moss evokes a bygone era of gentility. The guided tour of the last remaining building (there is an extra fee for this upon admission) affords insight as to what it the gentry lived like in those times. It was quite interesting to learn that Henry Midddleton's son, Arthur, signed the Declaration of Independence. Also, the various signs, educational posters and Eliza's house also give credit to the tremendous role the enslaved African Americans played in building and running the plantation.  The walking tour of the gardens is strongly recommended and it is included in the admission. It is highly informative and covers all the highlights of Middleton place.  It is also recommended that you wear comfortable walking shoes and leave  three - to-four hours for the tours and walking around the grounds.  Be sure to visit the restaurant.  The views are beautiful and the she-crab soup was one of the better versions in the region. We visited during the Christmas market, which was also fun."
10,Beautiful grounds,"Great Plantation with beautiful gardens and historic home to visit and spend an lovely, enjoyable morning or afternoon at. Well worth the stop."
11,So Beautiful!!!,What a beautiful place.  Very informative exhibits and a stunning garden.  The site is wonderful - right on the Ashley River.  I will return.
12,Beautiful,We found these grounds to be beautiful with a great view of the Ashley River.  The history of the Middleton family and the slavery story was well presented.  The old house with many of the original furnishings was interesting as well as the demonstration buildings depicting life in the early days of rice growing and exporting.
13,A very historic experience that should not be missed,Structured and manicured gardens with pathways through the azaleas and a huge camellia garden.  Terrace and old water mill and other interesting historic features.
14,Incredible,"One of my favorite places to visit in Charleston, one of the country's oldest formal landscaped gardens. Wonderful camellia presentation in bloom, butterfly lakes provide a beautiful vista. History, nature walks, farm animals..."
15,Well worth the drive from Charleston,"The grounds, gardens and stable yards are extensive and beautiful, full of history.  The house tour was a huge disappointment!  You are assigned a time when you purchase your tickets - $49.00@.  Our 1:30pm tour had over 20 people which was ridiculous!  The rooms in the house are very small and have sections & entire rooms roped off.  The guide uses a flashlight pointer to draw your attention to specific items in the rooms.  Very annoying!  She also did not know about all the items behind glass cabinets on display.  For the price charged, we expected a much better house tour."
16,Must see adventure!,"Gorgeous gardens, setting and place of historical significance.  Worth the short drive from Charleston to enjoy."
17,Best Historical Site/Plantation in Charleston,"Middleton Place is a National Historic Landmark and a fascinating place to visit because of its history and beautifully landscaped gardens (the oldest in the USA). Formerly a rice plantation that used slave labour, the museum within the main house and the permanent exhibition within Eliza's House, a freedman's house built around 1870, show different aspects of life on the land in bygone times. It's a beautiful yet thought provoking place to spend time.One of the more remarkable aspects of visiting is the small hand-written note, signed by Abraham Lincoln, the president of the USA during the Civil War, that's on display inside the museum."
18,Fantastic Grounds ,"The gardens are beautiful especially when the azaleas and camellias are in bloom.  A walk along the river is very nice with big old oak trees.  There are beautiful ponds and bridges.  Interesting old mill house.  The house tour was just ok. It did not have the original furnishings but those donated by the family .  I did not do the beyond the borders or tram tour.  The barn yard with horses, and the outdoor work areas was interesting.  I enjoyed my visit there.  The restaurant has beautiful views of the pond and gardens.  The buffet was regular food ( chicken, catfish, collards, mac and cheese, veges )and good but overpriced  22 dollars includes tea (which is to be expected in tourist places)."
19,Anniversary Staycation,"Very affordable for all the amenities included. Very nice accommodations and restaurants, beautiful plantation gardens and nice tour of what is left of the plantation house. Great all around experience."
20,Beautiful gardens and rich in history ,"The grounds are beautiful. Even the parking area is beautiful. We enjoyed our self-guided walking tour. We were amazed by the massive Middleton Oak (800-1000 years old and still alive). I recommend the interactive experiences near the end of the walking tour. Very knowledgable historians on sight. Jean enlighted us with information and a a demonstration on pottery. Jamal explained the life of a blacksmith to us. Animals roam the area freely. We met a sociable sheep named ""Mud"" and a peacock named ""Kevin"". Also make sure to check out Eliza's house for important information everyone should know about the lives of slaves before emancipation and the humble & challenging circumstances they continued to live in for years after the civil war."
21,Pretty gardens,"Middleton Place more than met our expectations!  Beautiful gardens, a wonderful restaurant, and lots of farm animals!  But we were most impressed with our tour guide, Bruce Georgi!  Bruce took us back in time!  The 1 1\2 hour tour, which is included with General admission, was filled with so many interesting facts that the time flew by!  Step back in time and visit this amazing place!"
22,Embraced by Oak Trees,"We toured Middleton Place on a trip to Charleston. I really loved walking through the gardens. There are hydrangeas everywhere and would have been so much prettier if we hadn’t visited during the scorching June sun. There is a restaurant on property where we were able to cool off, have a drink and a low country meal. There are gulf coast sheep and goats roaming around the property, along with horses, geese, ducks and chickens. It was peaceful and relaxing, and rich with plantation history."
23,History Worth Visiting,"The Grounds are larger than I expected, but so beautiful to stroll around on.  We were the on July 4th and the interpreters were wonderful.  They have us an understand about what the plantation might have looked like back there.  We love the Cooper!  He looked like he walked right out of time.  We walked through the stables where the giant horses were happily munching away on their dinner.  The grounds are so beautiful, plan to just relax and stroll.  Make sure you make it back to The Middleton Oak, it's just huge!"
24,Middleton was magnificent,The gardens are so beautiful that you might forget you made them that...Lots of history at Middleton place. You will see people dressed up so the visitor can imagine how crafts were done by slaves and under which circumstances. You will be encouraged to ask questions. You will see Eliza's house and learn how she lived at Middleton Place. There are stables with horses and sheep and a few cats are roaming around that like to be pet. Out of the three plantations almost next to each other this might be the best to go as a family with children.
25,Well worth the time,"We love the outdoors, taking pictures, learning some history and especially gaining knowledge and ideas for landscaping. What a wonderful place to visit.  Our entire time was spent on the grounds. There were a few baby and bigger gators. We have tours 3 other plantations in Charleston and a 2-3 outside of Richmond.  MIddleton Place is a massive plantation and all flowers were in bloom.  One of the volunteers pointed out the orange azalea which we had never seen before. There is a gift shop and garden shop on the premises as well as carriage rides available. We spent 4-5 hours and it was time well spent for us and will be if you enjoy a peaceful day touring a magnificent place.  There are arrows that help guide visitors and there are important historical signs that honor the history of slaves who built the buildings and all the gardens.  The Mill House is historical, has pictures and also honors the slaves from West Africa who toiled to plant and harvest rice for the Middleton family. Rice was the crop of South Carolina  plantations.  Take the tour.  We previously toured Magnolia, Drayton and Boone Hall plantations."
26,A Must See!,"The gardens are formal, so not many flowers, but the plantation is very peaceful. They have a number of tours, so plan to spend the whole day if you can. If not, at least tour the beautiful grounds."
27,$5 Student Admission :))),We enjoyed touring this beautiful place—stunning gardens and majestic old house.  We were fascinated by the history of the Middleton family and sobered by the tour entitled Beyond the Fields -a discussion about the lives of the enslaved people of the plantation.  Well worth the trip from downtown
28,Pretty but overpriced ,"There is something for everyone.  The farm animals are great for kids.  The slave quarters and tour was very interesting.  Grace gave an amazing explanation of the plantation, and the slaves.  Free parking, restrooms, a gift shop, and the country store.  There is a small restaurant.  Go early, as it gets very hot in the afternoon."
29,Amazing experience,Lots of walking.  Beautiful areas.  Enjoyed.  Go on a sunny day as the smells and views are great. Can’t say any more
30,Great birthday trip,"My first visit to a Southern Plantation. The Garden’s were beautiful. The House was interesting. I found Eliza’s House was the reason to visit. I’ve learned about slavery or at least the version the education system chose to teach about slavey but Middleton Place expanded that knowledge.  One family over 128 year person owned a total of 2800 enslaved people. If you want you, your children and/or your grandchildren to upstanding the enormity of the enslaved African and African-American people in the USA.....you must visit Middleton Place.  This story alone is worth the visit."
31,"Toured, dined and stayed at Inn, mostly disappointing","Billed as America’s first real tourist attraction, Middleton place is a beautifully landscaped area with loads of sculptured lawns, swamp forest trails, and lakes.  The home isn’t that impressive, since the main part of the home was destroyed during the Civil War.  Middleton also has craftsmen in period costume in the stable area doing demonstrations of crafts like weaving and blacksmithing.  The restaurant on-site is remarkably good, with a range of low country cuisine."
32,Stunning,Loved this gem. Great place to stroll and consider the history of the south. We enjoyed the docent lead tours of the garden and the house. We enjoyed a fine meal while we were there.
33,Lovely Gardens and Incredible Restaurant,"Set on the river a short drive from downtown Charleston the house is set in beautiful grounds and gardens. We followed an interesting tour of the house with a look round the historic farmyard and outbuildings where a number of artisans talked about their particular crafts. We then enjoyed a really excellent tour on the ""History of Slavery"", which was worth the admission price alone."
34,A lovely contrast to Magnolia,"Beautiful plantation with a lot to see.  Has a lovely restaurant as well as individuals explaining the kinds of tasks that were done centuries ago. ( milling corn, blacksmith, farming, etc.  Sculpured gardents are magnificent, the butter fly lake, and trees covered with Spanish moss over 500 years old.  You can walk or ride thru the planation. Gift shop also available."
35,Plantation of Old,What a beautiful and peaceful place to visit! My mom wants to move to Charleston just to walk the grounds of this beautiful estate.
36,Manicured gardens with a more formal setting,"This is a beautiful plantation with some of the most lovely grounds and gardens in the south.  The ""home"" and several out buildings are well maintained and the staff is universally well versed in the history of the property and enthusiastic in sharing this information.  The 4th of July celebration was a great experience.  The live interpreters are excellent.  Do not miss the potter-she is outstanding.  Not only is she talented but she is an excellent teacher."
37,"Breathtaking gardens, wonderful tour through the house","Middleton Place has gorgeous gardens with a lot of history. The house tour explains a lot about the families who lived on the property, while the “beyond the fields” tour discusses the lives of the enslaved people who made the gardens and plantation a reality. The low country restaurant cannot be missed. Don’t chase the sheep and the alligators are real!"
38,Well-rounded day,"We visited here during wonderful weather in June 2019.  We took the carriage tour, house tour, and walked the gardens.  The carriage tour was lovely and we learned so much.  The house tour was very nice but my husband did not enjoy it.  I suppose when you compare it to Mt. Vernon, it is very similar.  They do have some very unique items inside and it is nice to see the family history.  The fact that the estate is still in the family makes the whole place even more special. The gardens were astounding.  When we visited the hydrangea were in bloom. The ponds, the moss covered trees.  I could have enjoyed the gardens all day.  The birds that other wildlife make the whole place somewhat magical.  The irony in this beautiful place, along the ponds and in the ponds are very visible alligators.  Don't let your little ones run about freely!  But, watching them in all that beauty is amazing.  I don't think I will ever forget it.  I will return in azalea season!"
39,"Beautiful, historic site","We were amazed at this place- actually older than Mount Vernon! So much history! We enjoyed the beautiful grounds with massive ancient oak trees, camellias, swans in the reflecting pool and even some (wild) basking alligators. Loved the barnyard animals and the house tour (although our tour guide could have had a little more personality!) Lunch in the charming restaurant was nice but my husband’s gumbo was way overpriced for very small serving."
40,"Spend a Day, Enjoy the Sunshine and the Beauty",Middleton Place is full of history. We enjoyed all our tours --  especially the carriage tour. Amazing old Live Oak trees.
41,A Good View of Southern Plantation Life,"Relaxing, beautiful grounds-don’t miss the beyond the fields tour on slavery and especially the Kayak tour. Charleston Kayak company-Rare trip through the cypress swamps led by naturalist - will be signing up again for that activity for sure. Great way to relax-lots of interesting things that appeal to all ages- young kids even teens. Only downside is remembering the place was built on the backs of and by slaves. They are doing a better job of addressing this-through the tours and educational materials but still a ways to go. Definitely going to make this an annual trip."
42,Learned tons about the flowers & trees of South Carolina ,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon.  We strolled through the beautiful gardens, admired the wildlife, observed some cool and very old artifacts on a tour of the house, and soaked up the local culture and history shared by our very entertaining carriage driver.  We are not at all history buffs, but three hours at Middleton Place was an afternoon well spent."
43,Wow,"This was our second visit, took visiting friends. Perfect weather to see the wonderful display of azaleas and camellias. Guides were very knowledgeable and interesting. Lots of history."
44,MY FAVORITE PART OF MY TRIP,"The gardens are beautiful.  Warning:  If you see an alligator down around the ponds, they are real, not statuary!!  Stay away from them.  We had a nice guided tour of the house.  Fascinating history of the family and the Civil War era.  Beautiful historic pieces in the house."
45,Beautiful and informative,"A beautiful place, and amazing guides who described its history, both the Middleton family and the history of the slaves. Nice with the little huts with handiwork, and the animals."
46,Worth the visit.,Our favorite Plantation in Charleston. The grounds and home is so worth seeing. We walked around for hours...hating to leave such beauty.
47,Beautiful Place,My favorite plantation visit. So much to see and enjoy as well as catch up on the historical tours. Definitely worth the visit. the restaurant is a must as well. romantic and delicious with excellent staff.
48,Beautiful,Beautiful kept gardens and grounds.  It is a self guided tour except for the house.  I was expecting a guided tour but instead we were handed a brochure of the place with information about listed sites all marked by numbers.  This will require you to manage your time if you are on a time schedule.  Lunch was very good and I highly recommend the pecan pie with cinnamon hand made ice cream (delicious).  The pristine kept gardens along with the  historical  value of the home and the former owners made the overall tour the most worthy of all plantations in the area.  It is the only plantation that has a restaurant on site.  Highly recommend.  Hope that the next time we get to visit it will be spring time when all the thousands of flowers are in bloom.
49,Enslaved ,"This was definitely a worthwhile day trip from Charleston.  Middleton Place has a wonderful mix of beautiful garden, plantation and stable yard.  Took the garden tour and Beyond the Fields talk.  Both were informative.  Plan to spend at least half a day to get the full experience.  Off season was a nice time visit with fewer crowds and cooler temps.  Paid only $25 by combining it with Palmetto Carriage day tour In Charleston"
50,Beautiful gardens and grounds at a former plantation,"Gorgeous grounds and gardens for walking! The restaurant was beyond fabulous - had THE best meal and drinks there out of anywhere else we had been to in Charleston, hands down. Fresh, seasonal, farm-to-table meals. Cute outdoor market. The Museum shop wasn’t really geared too much towards Middleton Place in particular, but they still had some nice things there as well. The house was beautiful and the tour was very informative. You might also see some gators while you’re out walking by the water! I read a review saying how they glorified slavery at Middleton Place...we did not get that impression at all. I highly recommend including Middleton Place in your itinerary. It was 100% the best part of our trip to Charleston!"
51,Beautiful gardens worth visiting even in the rain,"The grounds are lovely, so much to see and we really appreciated so much history presented, especially concerning slavery and the slaves skills, talents and what life was really like for them during this time in our country’s history. Make sure you visit when you have several hours to spend so you don’t miss anything. In the slave’s village, there are skilled artisans demonstrating their skills, replicating work that would’ve been done during this period by the slaves. Also, fun to interact with the animals on the property."
52,Garden Tour,"The drive from Charleston to Middleton Place is along winding roads with live oaks arched over the highway. The garden tour was excellent and emphasized both the design by the Middleton family over time and the enormous work by enslaved persons to create the sites. We learned about the broad variety of camellias, magnolias and trees in the gardens. Even outside the major blooming period, the gardens are impressive. The house tour is well done and orients to the MIddletons and their roles over time."
53,Actors were amazing,"The grounds are lovely - formal gardens worth a walk and looksee.  The house is a reconstruction of the original and quite frankly, it's a little depressing.  Still the history of the family is interesting to hear."
54,"Not the original house, not worth the price",What a great location to visit and view the country.  The history and way of life are demonstrated with both oral guides as well as people teaching guests with how things were made.  Gardens were beautiful.  Visit.
55,Beautiful,"Middletown was highly suggested by our Charleston Walking tour guide.  It's a beautiful garden and worth the drive to West Ashley. Amazing century old Oak tree, gorgeous grounds and we really enjoyed learning about the history."
56,I love this beautiful plantation,My husband loves history and  I prefer nature. This place combines both in  a gorgeous setting with beautiful vistas and many picture opportunities. The slavery tour was awesome and the guide extremely knowledgeable. Has farm animals of the time period and additionally a couple more. Also easily to spot alligators in the near Ponds and rivers. Didn’t get a chance to tour the house but have seen other mansions recently so we opted not to. We also did the farm animal tour.  Spent a couple of hours here and really enjoyed it was one of my highlights of our trip. An easy drive from Charleston .
57,Beautiful Southern Gardens,"Took a booked tour to/from Charleston (Pineapple Tours).   So much to see (gardens, lake views, interpretation center (weavers, potters, candle makers, etc.).  House tour was very good.  Restaurant's buffet was excellent."
58,Rather than make your kids sit at a restaurant and get frustrated....,This was a great tour.  It is beautiful and ideal spring time weather.  Beautiful flowers and baby piglets were great to see.
59,Great Experience,This was a wonderful snapshot of the way things were. With sheep and chickens roaming free and a history lesson on slave plantation workings - it was well worth the time to learn about the southern culture back then.
60,Beautiful plantation,"Middleton Place is a stunning property that is a must see while in Charleston.  While Boone Plantation and Magnolia Plantation are beautiful also, the grounds, lakes and home at Middleton are unmatched.   From the house tour to the carriage ride to the stable tour, we loved it all.  You can pet the sheep, horses and the three cats roaming around.  They also have cashmere goats, cows, water buffalo and pigs.  We truly enjoyed our visit at the Plantation."
61,Highly recommend,"Upon several recommendations, we toured the Middleton Place Plantation and so glad we did.  Beautiful grounds, lots to see, very historic house tour, there was even a walking tour which was so informative and we found that to be the highlight of our day.  Whether you only have a couple hours or the entire day, the Middleton Place Plantation is the one not to miss!"
62,Visited,"Middleton Place is a lovely place to visit. It’s grounds are very well kept, the staff are friendly, the trails are engaging without being physically challenging. We saw different birds, toads, alligators, and a variety of plants. The oak trees with the moss are all over and they add to the natural beauty of the place. I did purchase an option for the house tour. I learned a bit about the history of the place and the events that influenced it over the many years. However, I felt it was overpriced as it was a really small exhibit. If you have a large group I would pass on it. And if your attraction to the place is the outdoors then I would consider if you could do without visiting it. Highly recommended!"
63,Loved this plantation,"The setting is beautiful.  The tour of the house was interesting but rushed. The ""carriage"" ride was educational but mostly just surrounded by tall bamboo, not pretty sights or views. The restaurant's food was problematic.  The Inn was outdated and rundown, and the people at the desk were rude."
64,"The good, the bad, and the shameful.","The grounds, statues, and garden are lovely, but during the house tour we had a guide who was partially re-litigating the civil war, which we found deeply odd, as well as ignorant and offensive. Is this really the face that Charleston wants to present to the world?"
65,Loads to do in this garden,"This place is beautiful and well worth a visit.  The wagon ride is well worth it.  You see much more of the plantation and our driver was more like a tour guide, with a wealth of interesting information about the plantation and Middleton family.We also enjoyed the gardens and animals.  Plus the restaurant was really good.  I would skip the house tour, as it is very quick and you don't really get to look at much on display.  In addition, we were disappointed by the information in Eliza's House.  It seemed like a high level slavery gloss-over.  Perhaps the Beyond the Fields Tour, which we didn't have time to take, would have had more information.  We got more of a sense for the slaves at the Aiken Rhett House than at Middleton.In summary, go for the gardens, animals, carriage tour, and restaurant.  Do not go to get a better sense of slavery on a plantation."
66,Well worth the visit,Parking is free with lots of shade. Garden market has lots of wonderful vendors.. Drinks and snacks available for purchase. The walking tour of the grounds is amazing. Lots of trails and foliage to see. Great views of the lake and river. Plenty to do for a day.
67,"Beautiful, clean, friendly and inviting.","we enjoyed a great day here, wonderful house tour with lots of period information, and then walked all of the grounds for a super experience.   easy to find, and worth the time to explore.  Grounds were beautiful."
68,Beautiful!,We went March 22nd and the azaleas were in full bloom and beautiful! Such a beautiful setting and kids enjoyed having room to run and play after doing several historical tours in the city. We didn't do any of the set tours but just walked through the grounds ourselves. Highly recommend a visit to Middleton Place!
69,A great trip to the past. ,"Visited from Colorado. The time was splendid, we met some great people that work at Middleton. The gardens are incredible. Would definitely go back, so much to see!"
70,My favorite thing in Charleston - an absolute must-see,The extensive gardens are worth the walk and a tour of the house is nice too.  It was in a much more restored state than the nearby Drayton Plantation.  One can also experience the animals and a carriage ride.  There is a very nice restaurant and inn on the property too.  It is a little pricey if you want to do everything.
71,Underrated destination in Charleston,"Our first  tour  with Chris, a master Gardener,  explained the French Formal Gardens. America's Oldest Lanscaped Gardens. They are amazing and were laid out by  André Le Nôtre, the master of classical garden , who planned Versaille in France! However late summer and fall lack the amazing blooms of the spring season.  We visited The Mill House on our own and read about  the slaves from West Africa  that  labored in the Middleton Rice plantation beside the Ashley River amidst insects, mosquitoes,  alligators and venomous snakes to plant, harvest, mill and deliver the crop to the Port of Charleston for export. Nicole, our narrator  on Beyond the Fields Tour likewise was very knowledgeable and informative regarding Slavery and the Eliza House near the Stables: Sheep , goats and horses are for the most part easy to interact with in their natural habitat.We also reserved and toured inside The Middleton House ; for the most part self guided but with a docent on each floor to answer questions about the Rooms, Middleton Family Ancestry,  Furnishings  and artifacts. Walking the grounds on our own , we observed an alligator sunning itself, egrets (white herons) strutting and flying, magnificent live oak trees and plants.  Driving back to the Inn at night after dinner, a wild sow was leading  her three little piggy s through the low country terrain.."
72,Beautiful place!,"Middleton Place is a beautiful and well manicured garden.  Plan on spending several hours and don't miss the ""Beyond the Field"" walking tour."
73,Beautiful formal gardens,"Right down the road from the popular Magnolia Gardens, Middleton Place is a unique and special place to see! Middleton boasts manicured gardens, pathways, ponds, and historic buildings. Even in March, there were lots of blooms to see, and plenty of different gardens to explore. We also enjoyed reading about the history, as we did not see the inside of the house, and seeing the stableyard with different crafting displays. Plus, sheep! Highly recommend this visit - don't skip it because you think it's like Magnolia."
74,Great tour guides,Definitely worth the trip. Lots of fun things to see and do. I’d recommend skipping the house tour. It’s extra money and not worth it. The groups they take in are too large and the spaces inside are too cramped for that number of people to see everything and be comfortable. Do not skip the restaurant. We had the best she crab soup and fried chicken we’ve ever tasted! The view of the lake from the tables is very pretty. If you look closely you might catch some gators and turtles sunning themself on the bank of the lake.
75,Afternoon trip,The grounds were amazing. 3 good tours included in the price.  The lunch room had a great Buffet of Southern food.
76,Incredible gardens !,"One of our favorite places to visit while in South Carolina.  Not only was the history worth the trip, the grounds were outstanding.  Great photo ops, very well cared for."
77, Beautiful and Haunting,"This plantation was patterned after Versailles.  The grounds are magnificent and would make every photo shoot epic! The area has so much history, charm and overall stellar views you just can’t help but get caught up in its serenity! We enjoyed Beth our guide telling us about all the people and stories. The people who volunteered there were dressed in clothing similar to when the plantation was in working order. What a place it would be for a wedding."
78,Enjoyable day ,"Visiting Charleston for the first time my husband and I wanted to see a Plantation and understand how people worked and lived there. Middleton Place offered a trifecta to experience: beautiful gardens, original house “museum” tour, and a world class restaurant for a most memorable lunch! They also have outside stables for the farm animals (yes there are many still there) and Eliza’s house which documents the life of slaves on plantation who later lived as freemen in that house. We booked with Pineapple Tours which included R/T transportation in luxury minibus with video (about Middleton) from downtown Charleston. The driver also provided background commentary on the plantation and history from back when it was operational. House tour was amazing and the lunch was so delicious. My husband had the shrimp gumbo which was chock full of many jumbo shrimp with delicious sauce and vegetables. I could not eat shellfish or the meats served on menu so the chef made a farm to table vegetarian dish with fresh okra, corn, eggplant, onions and rainbow baby carrots that was served in a garlicky risotto type rice with Parmesan cheese; totally exceeded my expectations! Even salad was amazing with shredded red and golden beets in wonderful dressing. Lemon tart with berry coulis was perfect ending to perfect meal!  Highly recommend this tour."
79,Amazing guides,"What a lovely place. The tours offered were really informative. We started out with the “Beyond the Fields” tour to learn about the life of the enslaved population on the plantation. It was moving to stand on the same ground on which generations of men, women and children toiled. The ability to walk the grounds on your own and to reflect upon all that this area saw was quite something. The house tour was also interesting, although to a lesser degree. Much of the original house was torched by Union soldiers at the end of the war and what remained was subsequently destroyed in an earthquake several years later. The only portion of the house that remains is thoughtfully curated and filled with the collection of the Middleton family from the past several centuries. The house is curated in such a way that you get a sense of how the family lived. The grounds at Middleton are very impressive and include a demonstration rice field so that you can see the conditions in which the enslaved worked to plant, grow, and harvest the crop. In addition to seeing the heritage livestock that they’re raising on the plantation, we were also able to see a number of alligators, some of which were sunning themselves during the day. You could easily spend the entire day at Middleton Place wandering the grounds, reflecting, and attending the various demonstrations, including the potter and the blacksmith. There is also a nice restaurant which features a tasty Southern buffet."
80,Beautiful grounds!,Not to be missed if you are in the area! The gardens are truly a site to behold. Such lovely people on staff also.
81,Very disappointed,"There's something here for everyone. Could have stayed the whole day. The historic house museum is amazing... guides retell the history of the house with objects, painting and furnishings. The gardens are beautiful, especially with the azaleas blooming. The stable yard and artisans provide a hands-on experience. And Eliza's house is not to be missed—a moving exhibition on the experience of enslaved people on the plantation. Wonderful."
82,Serenity and Beautiful Gardens,"We loved visiting Middleton Place on a beautiful winter’s day with Pineapple Tours. The lunch was excellent and the grounds tour and garden was really wonderful. The guide for the house, Mr. Gordon, was excellent and was very knowledgeable about the property and history of the plantation. Really a fun day!!"
83,Plenty to see and do on this day trip,"We chose the general admission ticket which allowed us to walk around the gardens and outbuildings and join talks on various subjects led by volunteers. We joined the talk on slavery, a difficult subject handled sensitively. However, wandering the landscaped gardens was the highlight of our visit, they are truly beautiful although we were too late for many of the flowering plants. The old oaks dripping with Spainish moss give an old world feel and charm."
84,"Probably my favorite day trip, ever",We really enjoyed seeing this plantation and it's beautiful grounds.  Well worth it.  And restaurant on site was great.  Do go...extremely interesting.
85,Especially noteworthy for the setting and landscaping - beautiful,"I read that Middleton Place has the country’s oldest formal gardens, which prompted us to visit. I was very delighted to see the gardens and the huge live oak trees with Spanish mosses hanging from every limb. The area, with its plantings, ponds and bridges, evokes old-world charm. It was also interesting to see the slave quarters, although I hoped the info boards would expound on their story. We joined the house tour, which was very interesting. However, with the main house being destroyed and never rebuilt, you can’t appreciate the grandeur of this plantation. I say, if you’re a garden person, go see this place, but if you’re after old plantation houses, there are other options in the area."
86,An exceptionally moving historical experience that contrasts extreme wealth with the horrors of slavery.,"The grounds and gardens were gorgeous.  The grounds staff were very friendly.  We did not tour the house, but bring bug spray if touring the grounds in the summer."
87,Wonderful outdoor adventure,"This plantation is absolutely beautiful. There is also lots of history here that the other plantations in Charleston don't have. I also think this is the prettiest plantation in Charleston and well-worth the money! They have one of the oldest trees in the United States, as well as the first camelia ever brought to the country."
88,Lovely gardens,"Unlike the Gardens 10 miles up the road Middleton Place offers more formal style gardens.  The landscaping is immaculate and the water views are breathtaking.  General admission gets you access to the grounds, livestock, nature walks and exploration of slaves and their eventual freedom.  Tour of the house is not included with the General admission tickets, however there is a package tour that gives access to all of the above, plus tour of the Edmondston-Alston House  downtown on East Battery.  Great way to explore life on a plantation before the Civil war"
89,Beautiful gardens,"We were interested in Middleton Place mostly for the grounds, which are absolutely beautiful, even in late November.  It is understandable that this is a popular location for weddings, even if it had been a Southern rice plantation with wealth built upon the backs of slaves. The gardens are not filled with colorful plants like Magnolia, but they are finely terraced areas set with areas easily irrigated by water from the Ashley River behind needed for rice farming."
90,Beautiful Gardens and Buildings,"The plantation tour was very good.  Gardens were beautiful.  Very scenic.  House tour was good and appropriate in length,  Grounds are amazing. Azaleas were in bloom. 3/12/2020"
91,Amazing and informative,"We loved our visit to the Middleton Place. We took tours of the gardens and the house. We were very impressed with the knowledge of the guides especially the garden tour. She not only knew the plants but was able to give the history of how the plants arrived in the garden. After the house tour we walked through the stable area were additional guides are there to provide information about the plantation and life on the plantation. They were such friendly people, very impressive and obviously enjoyed their time talking with visitors. We spent five hours there and would like to come back in the spring to see how the gardens change."
92,Gardens and restaurant,"If you only visit one plantation make it Middleton Place. Iconic beauty, wonderful tours. This is a must do."
93,A Piece of Charleston’s Triple Crown of Spectacular Plantations...Each One Different and Every One Stunning!,"Wonderful. Beautiful grounds. We came for a kayaking trip in the swamp, which was great. Stayed and walked the grounds. Beautiful well maintained landscape. Lots of history walking around. We did not pay for any tours. Great place to spend a day."
94,History and beauty married nicely,Plan a full day for your visit. Many very interesting tours and displays. The history of this place is extremely interesting. Tours of the grounds should not be missed. Friendly and knowledge staff are very helpful. Well worth the price.
95,history of this family owned plantation seen from two perspectives,We visited Middleton Place during a recent trip to the Low Country. The gardens were spectacular with the Camellias & Azaleas blooming. We went on one of the free garden tours & were very happy that we did. Our tour guide did a great job explaining all the varieties of flowers as well as the history surrounding this beautiful attraction.
96,Stunning!,Absolutely loved our walking tour. The gardens were beautiful. We gone a few times for their programming for scouts and they have done amazing job. A must for any visit to Charleston.
97,Still not getting slavery right,"Beautiful plantation. We opted for the carriage ride. Our guide provided insight into its history and legacy. The plantation also had re-enactments of soap making; candle making; blacksmith work; rifle making. All gave well done presentations. The is also livestock. You may recall from the movie the The Patriot the famous scene when the British ship blows up, it was on the end of the gardens where the scene was filmed."
98,"Well maintained, historic grounds ",We were staying at Middleton Inn so the gardens were walking distance. The grounds are beautiful and can only imagine they are spectacular when everything is blooming. We liked going near sunset as the shadows and lawns make for good pictures.
99,Very Nice/Historical Re-Enactment ,My friend & I were blown away by the vast gardens & land owned by the Middleton Foundation. What wasn’t destroyed during the Civil War has been beautifully preserved.
100,"Beautiful day, beautiful plantation ","Beautiful manicured land in parts, but the steep cost of admission doesn’t include a tour of the house. The pathway through the gardens was difficult to navigate with a stroller due to small rocks and sand, so keep that in mind if bringing young children. The stables and Freedman’s cabin are fascinating to see and the people working there are friendly and informative. Overall, we had a nice visit but don’t think it was worth the cost to just walk the property."
101,Beautiful November Wedding,"My family visited America's oldest landscaped gardens and interacted with the skilled craftspeople- a weaver,a potter and blacksmith in the Living History Stableyards who were so knowledgeable of their  trade and history of the time period. I'd love to name each one personally but can only remember Jamal and Jeff who spent ample time with us on their area of expertise. I'd highly recommend a visit to this historic landmark."
102,Beautiful place and great history,We had a great time at Middleton Place with our kids and our family friends! The grounds are beautiful and the kids had lots of room to just be kids and run! There were many activities for the kids too as it was Easter weekend.
103,Incredible gardens,"I did a self-guided tour. The majority of the site is covered in gardens and wooded areas, with walking paths allowing visitors to explore. There are a blacksmith's workshop, woodworking shop, barn and pastures with animals, and other historic buildings."
104,A beautiful day,"A remarkable garden, and a remarkable family history. Incredible scale of gardens are a testimony to slave labor then and family care (and money) since. Enjoyable place to visit, with a lot to see. Incredible Live Oak specimens everywhere. Mature landscape. Can only imagine what this place is like when the azaleas are in bloom."
105,Beautiful in the Fall & so historical,"Middleton Place has a bed and breakfast, house tour, resturant, stable of animals, shops and cafes, it has LOTS to offer. The grounds were beatuful the best kept in Charleston. We toured 5 Plantations in 2 days and Middleton was excellent for the money. When you arrive you receive a guide and map with explainations of each stop which is so helpful for your self guided ground tour. The gardens, ponds were immaculate. You need to budge 4 hours to be able to tour the house (which we did not have time to do) and the grounds. Lots of history. I love that the Middleton's still own the property. We ate at the resturant it was wonderful. Very Instagram worthy photos (cannot take photos in the house) and so much history to soak in. I would definetly go back, loved it at the Middleton Place!"
106,Great Place to spend a day,"We went for lunch - which was SPECTACULAR!  Then, toured some of the plantation.  There are guided tours that can be purchased above and beyond the general admission which includes several basic tours.  It can be quite a pricey visit if one adds on additional tours. I believe a whole day can be spent without purchasing the additional tours. We purchased the house tour.  This was very interesting.  We went rather late so we didn't have as much time as we would've liked to look at everything beyond the tour.  Going through the barnyard, a young lady was milking a cow!  She asked if I wanted to try &, of course, I did.  She was incredibly knowledgeable with lots of fun facts about the animals.  I really could have spent so much more time with her & I don't think she would've minded! I would not mind going back there for a longer time... especially if it is not hot!"
107,Lovely Place,"We took the tour bus from Charleston which made for any easy arrival.  The gardens are simply wonderful.  Take you time exploring everything!   The house tour is interesting too.  We spent the better part of day enjoying/walking the grounds.   This was a really good day on our Charleston trip.  There is a place to have lunch on the grounds. It has a very limited menu. The food is not what you get inCharleston proper, but it is ok.  The high points are the grounds, house and tour staff."
108,Historical Plantation,"The founders of this plantation were signers of the constitution. Lots of history and tours explaining it. Although the main house was destroyed, a smaller, side house the family occupied is now a museum with original family furnishings. ""Beyond the Fields"" tour gives the history of slavery at the plantation. You come away with a better understanding of the South. A lot of the activities are outdoors, difficult on very hot days. The house tour is air conditioned. They also have some livestock and period craftsmen showing how things were done."
109,Great step back into history,"Middleton Place is our favorite place to escape to for a weekend getaway or an overnight wine stroll and dinner date escape!  It’s the PERFECT place to un-plug and reconnect with each other and with nature.  EVERYTHING you need is there!  There is so much to do from walking the grounds, taking a historical tour of the house and stables to chilling at the pool, taking a kayak tour or hanging in a hammock below the canopy of trees.  THEN there is the awesome dining at the Restaurant followed by romantic strolls through the woods back to the Inn afterwards.  The ROOMS at the INN offer simplistic decor centered all around the floor to ceiling windows.  ALL rooms come with wonderful VIEWS of the beautiful grounds.  We have been four times since the COVID outbreaks in February 2020 and it has truly been an incredible benefit for us to still enjoy “traveling” while feeling completely secure with our health and exposure."
110,"If you only got to visit one plantation, make it this one!","We went on the walking tour with a guide. Saw the slave quarters and rice fields. Found out that just 5% of the slaves from Africa landed in the United States. Sheep and other farm animals are just wandering around the grounds. This plantation is right on the Ashley River outside of Charleston, SC."
111,Poor customer service - not as represented!,"So many acres and not that much enjoyment. The tour company provided a good clean ride and decent lunch but overall there was no ""Wow"" factor at all. It was good but certainly not great. I wanted to go to Magnolia but chose Middleton for convenience and it looks like it turned out to be a mistake.With that said the lunch was pretty good and the petting zoo was a nice extra highlight. Just could have been much more."
112,Beautiful Plantation,"We looked forward to a trip to the plantation to understand the Middleton family history, the history of emancipation and the Civil War and enjoy the grounds. All went well until our humorless tour guide in the house put her specific “view” of history on the tour in the most dictatorial and unpleasant manner. If you do go, enjoy the grounds and the restaurant but avoid the house tour."
113,Another enjoyable visit!,The baby sheep and piggies were just born the flowers are in bloom. If you have never visited a plantation Middleton plantation is the place to visit. With the rich history and gardeners delight.
114,Historic property - beautiful walk,Had perfect weather for our visit .Ambled the grounds . Saw the animals and had an informative tour with Mary.Good lunch at the restaurant. Delicious She Crab Soup.It is a bit expensive though and for a family of four would imo be cost prohibitive.
115,The carriage ride was the best part.,"We visited during a week-long stay in Charleston. This plantation is really beautiful-well maintained and cared for. We did the house tour and the ""Beyond the Fields"" tour and both were great. We were there just after the cherry blossoms bloomed so we missed that, but the gardens were still very pretty. I wish we'd had more time to walk the grounds. The Middleton Oak was gorgeous as well. Worth a visit, although a bit pricey."
116,Amazing gardens and location,"My family spent about 4 and a half hours here just walking the grounds. It's stunningly beautiful, I can't even put into words how gorgeous this place is. Not only was it a lovely place to walk around, the staff were so kind and helpful. Make sure you see the horses, cow (one of the cows we met was the sweetest!), water buffalo and goats. One thing I cannot imagine is if it is THIS beautiful in the off season, how beautiful is it in the spring? I will definitely be making a trip back to this stunning place."
117,Must See,"This stop on our group trip was outstanding! We walked all over the beautiful property at will. There is a marked path for a long or short tour. The flowers were amazing! It is impeccably groomed! There is an area by the home that has animals in pens, and you can visit the old stables and other brick buildings. It is truly a must see for anyone in the area! Take time to enjoy this gem!!!"
118,Wow.  This was a delightful and educational day.  I’m so glad we spent our time here!,Loved it! We toured the garden’s and wow! is all you can say. It is a Master Gardener’s dream. Learned that several movies have been made there (the Patriot) and it is a sought after celeb wedding venue. There is also an on site restaurant. (Great She-crab soup)
119,Good Plantation Experience,"Very quiet and peaceful to stroll the grounds - our group of 35 got the boxed lunch, which was well organized and delivered straight to picnic tables under the trees.  Many of our group could have stayed all day!"
120,Historic,"My wife and I visited Middleton plantation and took tours of the gardens and the house.  Both tours were very informative and the guides were well versed and enthusiastic.  The grounds are stunning and the house, the only one of 3 still standing after Union troops burned all three in 1865, was full of paintings of the Middletons and furnishings and artifacts from the family's time there.  Well worth several hours."
121,Love the self guided walk and information ,We visited the plantation during the hot summer months.  It truly gave you a real feeling of what it would have been like to live here during the pre Civil War days.  They did an excellent job of giving the history of the white and African American experience.  I learned so much.
122,How to review a plantation?,Exceeded my expectations! Middleton is beautiful and the tour guides were very friendly. We ate lunch at the 100% organic and locally sourced restaurant. It was a little expensive but one of the best lunches I’ve ever had!!
123,Beautiful old Plantation,"I did not visit the interior of the house, just walked around the formal garden. Not a lot of flowers because it was late in the season but, as a gardener, I still enjoyed it. Took the free garden tour which gave some nice history."
124,Wonderful way to spend the day,Spent the morning at this beautiful place we went to lunch first the most awesome food a view of the gardens. Then had a guided tour of the house and history lesson. We loved hearing about the family history. We are dirty we missed the skate exhibit but I will go back for that exhibit. Beautiful gardens and museum shop
125,Great tour and restaurant!,"Although the entry was somewhat pricey-- the grounds here are pretty and there's some interesting history with the remaining house and family.  The grounds here are very nice, but it was really hot when we visited so we didn't spend too much time in them.  The house tour was informative with information on the Middleton family and their role in American history as well as the enslaved people who lived here too.  There were lots of historic artifacts-- jewelry, silver, books, portraits, furniture, etc.  There were several outbuildings containing a chapel and slave cabin with interesting exhibits.  The gift shop was quite large.  The most memorable part of the visit was seeing an alligator come out of one of the ponds and sun itself on the bank!"
126,First major attraction visited & was very nice!,I did the garden tour and the carriage ride!  Both will fondly remembered.  The carriage driver was as he said a descendent of a former slave and grew up on Middleton Place.   The grounds were impeccable and had me awe struck.  The stories provided by the carriage driver of his experiences  was worth the trip in itself!  So glad to have visited.
127,Simple Southern Beauty,"I felt like Scarlet O'Hara as soon as I stepped foot in the gardens. WOW it is beautiful. Hundreds of blooming magnolia trees and massive oaks, vast garden ""rooms"", lakes, stables, and artisans take you back to the old south. I can imagine Scarlet sitting beneath the trees with suitors at her feet! I would have given it 5 stars if the house tour was included (it's $15 extra). Lunch in the little restaurant was pricey and limited. Pack a picnic lunch and sit near one of the many scenic lakes and enjoy the view."
128,A True Look at the Old South,We were visiting Charleston for a wedding weekend and decided to explore more than the downtown area.  We drove to Middleton and took the walking tour of the grounds.  The guide spoke all about the foliage.  The views were beautiful and it was a lovely walk.  Our friends took the tour of the house and really enjoyed the tour guide.  We also wandered through the area where the animals were.  Unfortunately the carriage ride was booked.  It is a lovely place to visit.
129,A MUST see tour when in Charelston,"The most expensive gardens I came across in this part of the world, which I do not think is fair, so I highly recommend for the management to come with an alternative as not everybody is interested in the gardens.You pay 29 USD for the gardens as the house is half the price and where you have to wait for the time of the tour in the scorching sun.  My partner did not want to visit the house but went twice round the grounds, the second time showing me around.  Apparently this location does not have the same high number of insects biting you and has more open grounds, that is why it looks like they have all kind of functions here:- we arrived following our Google directions printed in advance and we found the small road that led to the plantation where we paid at their ticket office and then walked straight to the house not to miss the tour- the house has unique items donated by the descendants of the Middleton from all over the world and they ask you to leave your bag downstairs assuming that you are clumsy and you are going to knock down their furniture?  The place is not that small and groups function properly here without knocking anything.  You are not allowed to take pictures of video and the place smells 'old' their air con can hardly hide it.  Inside of the house still looks like most of the houses built in the precious centuries in the UK look like, even with the same stair case and the rest.... that was rather interesting to see-  although I was already tired I had to see why the garden was so expensive and walked towards the river, noticing little turtles and alligators here and there, then walked to the animal's area playing with the cats and finally to the former slaves' house having lots of info about their lives here.  - pressured by time we had to leave, going the same way near the artesian which looked rather beautiful"
130,Fascinating history and a lovely walk,"Wow.  I’d heard this was the best plantation to visit, and we were extremely impressed.  We took a Beyond the Fields tour with Leslie M, who captivated us with his love of history, his extensive knowledge, his passionate energy, and his sincere enthusiasm.  We could’ve listened to him all day!  Thank you for making this come alive for us.  What a gift God has given this man!  Our tour of the home was also quite informative.  Jackie (I hope this was her name) was also a treat with her stories.  She’s a natural!We were also enthusiastically greeted at the entrance with a guide who suggested a few ideas and answered questions thoroughly.  I wish I could recall her name, but she was a high spirited personable lady.Thank you for a fantastic day!!"
131,History presented very well here!,"We have visited this place many times and love the grounds and history of this place. Its just nice to get away from town and stroll the grounds. We do feel that this place is not as well kept up as it used to be however, but still love it."
132,Beautiful Historic Gardens and Buildings,This was a great experience.   The tours are excellent.  The Garden tour was very interesting from a 900 year old live oak to a camellia bush that was planted by a French visitor in 1786 that is still alive!  The house tour and the history of the Middleton family is very interesting.   The grounds have some amazing things to see from a working blacksmith shop to live animals and very good history of the slaves that built the place.
133,Iconic Beauty,"Arriving in the middle of a drought didn't help much to view the gardens but to learn how those gardens were built and maintained was extremely interesting. The house tour was also very worthwhile to do, we loved the arcitecture and furniture. One word of advice, if you are out in the middle of the lawn and hear the shepard call for his sheep, stop, don't move, and let the sheep run by you. That was a fun expierience!"
134,Enjoyed our visit,Spent the morning doing the grounds and house tour. Well run and educational. Don't miss doing lunch at their restaurant. Food was delicious and reasonable.
135,History mixed with nature,"I've been to Magnolia and Middleton, and Middleton by FAR has superior gardens. They are more 'geometric' in design which I find more attractive. The grounds are easily walk-able and are absolutely stunning. They also offer student discounts with a valid student ID!I highly recommend visiting this plantation!"
136,Nice Plantation Experience,"We stayed at the Inn at Middleton Place and admission to the house and gardens was included in our stay!  Since I was planning to visit anyway, this just made so much sense!  We were not disappointed!  The house displays hundreds of years of history and the formal gardens are beautiful!"
137,Worth the visit,We loved our visit to Middleton Plantation. The docents were knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the rich history of the area. The gardens were in full bloom — incredible!
138,GREAT Tour,Well organized and we learned quite a bit. Our tour guides were very educated in the details and history of this place and were eager to share their knowledge. Shout out to the woman who was doing the pottery demo...she is great. We stopped into the restaurant for a bite and had the best fried tomatoes and had a sweet conversation with the server.
139,Worth the trip!!,If you are coming to Charleston SC you must not miss this wonderful tour of Middleton Place and Plantation.  This is a great place to take the family and enjoy the day.  At every turn there is a person guiding you and explaining the history of the plantation.  The animals are so well taken care of you would think they were part of a family.  There is a restaurant on site and has marvelous food. You can partake in a carriage rids with big beautiful horses for an additional charge. It was Lambing season and  so many of the adult females lambs had babies that were just a month old. The gardens are just like Versailles in France.
140,The best part of our trip!,"The grounds are generally very beautiful. There are parts a little overgrown. I was disappointed that the general admission didn’t include the house. It was an additional $15. There is a nice restaurant on site that we stopped in for lunch and to get out of the heat. I would have liked to have joined the tour on slavery, but I missed it."
141,"Beautiful plantation, wonderful customer service!",Take the carriage tour when you arrive as the buggy driver provides excellent background and history to the place.  The grounds are beautiful and majestic.  The tour of the house and exhibits is also worth seeing.   A lovely day out!
142,Great way to spend the day,"Middleton Place is the site of America’s oldest landscaped garden.  One of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Arthur Middleton, lived here, and his son, Henry Middleton, the Governor, started the gardens in 1741.  The gardens are over 65 acres, and include a 100 year old live oak.The property was one of the 30 plantations owned by the Middletons throughout the south, and, of course, they were slaveholders. So the history of slavery plays a prominent place in the history of this place.The entire site is magnificent.  We started our visit with a tour of the gardens and were treated to the thousand of camellias that were in bloom.  We were a bit early to see the 100,000 azaleas in bloom.We then hooked up with a one-hour talk about slavery.  The young man conducting the talk was a PhD candidate from the University of New Hampshire.  He lives here and asked to do his dissertation at home.  He was terrific.  He discussed the history of slavery in the country at the time, it’s role in South Carolina, and at Middleton.  He talked about the lives of slaves and what they had to endure.  And he mentioned how ironic that the signers of the Declaration of Independence were slave owners. If you are into taking photos, this place offers lots of great opportunities.  Don't miss it."
143,Great place to see!,"Everything about this place is fantastic: the knowledgable tour guides (particularly on the tour discussing the lives of the enslaved workers), the breathtaking gardens and views of the swamps and Ashley River (and a 1,000-year-old tree), the lovely animals taken care of by what seemed to be a solid team of caretakers, and the top-notch restaurant. The garden is filled with little surprises and nooks and crannies, and the river and pond walks are stunning. The animal, house, and enslaved history tours are essential, compelling, thorough, and even-handed. The free-roaming sheep are great to be around - they're fun to be around but they like to keep their distance. The horses, goats, pigs, and other animals were friendly, and the staff let us know what to watch for in their behavior. They seemed to be content and healthy, but I'm not an expert. Eliza's House and the walking enslaved history tour is a crucial aspect of Middleton Place that has excellent stories that confront slavery and racial injustice over the years. It's presented really well. Overall, I was blown away by how much there is to do and see. Definitely easy  to fill an entire day (if not more), but you could do the highlights in 3-4 hours if you're short on time. The house tour is really very good, too. All of the guides that I experienced were smart and empathetic people. Highly, highly recommended."
144,How to glorify slavery? Go to one of these places,"I want to give you some practical information about Middleton Place, Drayton Hall and  Magnolia Plantation. They are all next to each other on Ashley River Rd., but they are a few miles apart, definitely not walkable.The closest, reasonable hotels are by Charleston Airport, about a 15 minute drive.Allow a full day each for Magnolia Plantation and Middleton Place and 1/2 day for Drayton Hall.  They all offer a different experience and recommending one depends on what you'r interests are.  If you like old houses Drayton Hall has never been updated with electricity or plumbing and the woodwork is genuinely distressed from sheer age.  It gives you the ""going back in time"" feeling.If your interest lies more in plants and wildlife you'd probably like Magnolia Plantation.  Their Nature tram ride and Nature boat ride take you through the swamp and you see alligators aplenty as well as a lot of bird life. They also have a Swamp Garden self-guided walk, a garden center (with some gorgeous, pricey plants) and a little zoo. If you are most interested in history and plantation life back in the day, Middleton Place would be the best. They have great tours of the house, the slave experience and a stable yard with demonstrations of old trades needed on a plantation.Magnolia Plantation and Middleton Place have places to eat and all of them have very clean restrooms. All of these places offer more to do than what I've mentioned and although a bit pricey they offer a lot of bang for your buck."
145,"stunning grounds, great tour","Arrive early and see some wildlife before they hide from all the people. Carriage ride in the morning was the best and only time to do it- otherwise way to hot. The tour group leaders all were knowledgeable, friendly and conversational. Would be great to bring a picnic, and relax in the shade!"
146,"Quick, romantic getaway","We spent half a day meandering around this fascinating piece of 300-year-old Southern history.  The grounds are spectacular and filled with examples of history dating back to the settlement of  Carolina, back in the 1600s. A visit is well worth the admission price."
147,Beautiful grounds and excellent tours,Stopped here after visiting the magnolia plantation. Actually enjoyed this more than magnolia because it wasn’t so buggy. Grounds are nice but with any plantation there’s lots of walking involved and there’s no shade for more than half the time you’re walking around. We only bought tickets for the grounds because our day was full. It took about and hour - hour and half to follow the map given to us at the ticket counter. Since we were there in June there weren’t many flowers. It would be helpful if the trails were better marked and that it was clear that you could walk through gates. We weren’t so sure and wound up walking more than needed and that was annoying in the hot Carolina weather. The price for the grounds is also quite high for what you get IMO and there really should be a seniors price! There is lots for kids to see given there is a stable yard and other places for kids to learn about life on a plantation. Parking was plentiful when we went around 1030. The gift shop is ok. Bathrooms are very clean though!
148,Absolute perfection!,"This place was truly amazing! We went in mid-March at the end of the Camellia bloom and beginning of Azalea bloom. Spent four hours and could have stayed way longer. Took many amazing polaroid photos, saw some alligators, and sheep. Gary did an incredible job on the Slavery tour. Learned so much about the history and even how it affects the society today!"
149,Weekend Getaway in Charleston ,"WE toured here September 30, 2019. It was a great tour. Our tour guide was very educated on the history of this historical place. Be sure & take time to tour it. It is beautiful."
150,Go for the gardens bp ot the building,"There are plenty of plantation houses to choose from to tour. It can be tough to narrow it down if you don't have the time to see them all. Middleton Place is a solid choice to give you an idea of how people in coastal South Carolina lived and also why they cared so much for their homes and lands.Middleton has kind of a tiered system of payment. You can pay to simply get onto the grounds which would give you a nice overview of the facility. You can add onto that with a guided tour of the grounds as well as a guided tour of the house (not the original big grand plantation house but the only one still standing). If you like history and have the time, I might recommend the house. If you have children (my youngest was three), I'd say save the money and skip the house. It is guided with presenters (docents, tour guides, interpreters, whichever name you prefer) and it lasts a good 30 minutes. Everything is roped off and some things are within grabbing range so you have to be diligent with your little ones. You also won't be allowed to take your bags or strollers into the house. They have free lockers inside but just as a heads up.When you start, you enter through the gardens. This portion is beautiful but can be tricky if you go off the path. Follow the signs and arrows to keep you where you are supposed to be going but take a moment to see the Secret Gardens. Its obvious why they call them that. The Spanish Moss will also be out so if you are from the North like me and want to see some traditional Southern ecology, you will not be disappointed.There are working animals on site. David is incredibly nice and will bring his water buffalo to you (not to touch but you can get close enough) to talk about why the Middleton's had them. They also have free romaing sheep, horses, and a friendly cat over by the textile mill. The working craft section is cool, especially the cooper. He referenced my squirmy three year old but I still learned a lot from him.They also reference slavery. There are a couple of buildings dedicated to the slave's stories at Middleton which is nice. It didn't come off as white-washed or forced. It came off as ""it happened, here's what happened, the slaves were strong and should be admired, the Middleton's depended on their labor, hopefully we won't have slavery again (I'm cutting things short but this the jist of it)."" As someone from the North, it was nice to see slavery and its role at the plantation acknowledged.Overall, you can't go wrong with Middleton Place for living history. Yes it is a little bit on the pricey side but this is an important part of this region's history as well as a beautiful overall facility. If you want to do a Plantation House tour, this is a good one to see."
151,Lovely Gardens,"The walking tour of the grounds at Middleton Place was the highlight of our visit.  Our guide's dramatic presentation of the information he shared about the lives of the enslaved people on the plantation was thought provoking and informational, without being biased one way or the other."
152,Lovely Visit,We stayed at the Inn at Middleton Place which was fab. We explored the grounds and they were amazing. The Plantation is  lovely.We were disappointed with the tours we had. The Beyond the Field tour was far longer than it was supposed to be and not very 'snappy' We then did the house tour which was OK but a bit negative and 'don't touch' anything.Its the only way to see in the house so you have no choice!
153,Middleton Place is extraodinary,"Wonderful place. Very informative guide on walk tour. My personal opinion it’s a little high priced for each person, but it is a nice place, would not recommend for children teenagers, will not appreciate."
154,A gorgeous afternoon in the country,The Field tour is excellent as is the house tour.  Plan to spend a few hours for tours and wandering around the spectacular grounds.  A slice of American history.
155,Absolutely worthwhile ,This is a must see for anyone who enjoys gardens and or history the docent led garden tours are not just about the plants but also the history
156,Historic Plantation A Drive Outside Charleston,"We did the carriage ride which was interesting up to the house, toured the house, then the barns, & next some of their gardens & their waterfront walks beyond their 28 ft. diameter Live Oak Tree. Saw alligators, large fish jumping up out of one of their  ponds, & (2) young water buffaloes, which I did not even know were ever in the US. Had been brought there by the Middletown family for rice production. They also had live action artisans for a blacksmith shop, basket making, pottery making, cow milking & copper work."
157,Beautiful Plantation!,We visited here as my son wanted to see the sheep specifically. He has a book with the sheep in front of Middleton Place and wanted to recreate it. We loved walking around the grounds and seeing the animals and reading about those who worked there. My one complaint was that we arrived about 10am and there was no mention on the website or when we purchased our tickets that the house did not open until 12. We did not get to see it as it was too hot to stick around 2 hours
158,Best Plantation Experience ,"We happened by Middleton on a day they were doing historic reenactments. Those working were very friendly and happy to answer questions about life there at the time it was a working plantation, what happened during the war, and subsequent years after. I also took a complimentary garden tour with Greg who was friendly, knowledgeable, and charming. While we didn't take the additional house tour you have to pay extra for, the complimentary tours are well worth the time and I would recommend trying to fit at least 1 or 2 into your visit."
159,Beautiful grounds,"We visited here with family while on vacation. We’ve visited several plantations over the years and each one is unique. This one had absolutely beautiful gardens and views. The fact that it’s right on the Ashley River is something to see. We did the tour about slavery. It was very informative and interesting. The original plantation itself was burnt and looted back in 1865, so it is no longer there to see but the remnants of where it stood are still there. The sheep wandered freely around the grounds. The blacksmith was working the day we arrived. There’s so much to see here and it is great for any age. We didn’t do the house tour since we had a little one."
160,Beautiful landscape,"We were excited to visit Middleton Place and bring home a few souvenirs as we share the surname.  We were extremely disappointed to find the museum shop closed for inventory for two days (July 1,2). Not sure why this would take 2 days but that is another story.  We elected to leave and visit Magnolia Plantation and Drayton Hall instead, enjoying both. There was a lack of “give a care” with the folks we talked to at Middleton Place so we saw beautiful gardens and had awesome history lessons elsewhere (and got great souvenirs for memories)."
161,Beautiful Surroundings,"The grounds are magnificent, and what remains of the house is very interesting to tour, with excellent tour guides. Be sure to take the tour that presents the slave experience -- it was fascinating."
162,Perfect for kids,"The place is certainly overpriced ($29!) just to see the gardens, considering there were absolutely no blooms, atleast at this time of the season. We visited with a group of 8 and it is a rip off having to pay so much just to stroll through the gardens. For the first time TripAdvisor reviews were misleading although we checked out reviews from as recent as last week"
163,"nice, but expensive",Middleton Place was one of my favorite plantations we visited. They have a lot of animals which they would have had back then. They also have a heard of sheep that graze in the front yard.
164,Middleton place fails to come to terms with history,"After reading other reviews we definitely wanted to visit Middleton Place on our current visit. Even in November the grounds were gorgeous. It was in between flower seasons but that stlll didn't make any difference. The Camilla bushes were just starting to flower so we did get a hint of the colors. We also enjoyed walking through the farm.When you go, take time to eat at the restaurant. I hadn't had fried chicken in years. Delicious. I also want to give a shout to our waiter, Ryan. He was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. When we asked for another glass of wine to share, instead of bringing us a glass and then we pour, he divided the wine evenly between the 2 of us. Thought that was great. Be sure to take the time for a visit. We did not do the house or the carriage ride. We will save that for our next visit. Will eat the restaurant again, too."
165,Lovely visit and learned a lot ,"The azaleas were exploding with color during our visit to Middleton earlier this month.  And we couldn't walk near a body of water without seeing an alligator, or two, or three, basking on the sunny banks.  They left us alone and we did the same to them.  But how cool to see them enjoying such a beautiful place.  The house tour is informative and the home itself is beautiful. The highlights of the estate are the many garden and pond areas with beautiful formal gardens as well as meadows and park settings.  Absolutely gorgeous afternoon.  Will definitely visit again!"
166,One of the best tours,Great tour and lunch!  Our tour bus had a video about Middleton Place and it was very informative.  We learned more from the video than from the tour guide at the mansion tour.  Middleton Place is beautiful!  The lunch included on the tour was delicious and included many southern dishes.  Highly recommend the tour.
167,A must see National Historic Landmark,"Visited this one Labor Day week-end 2019, on a rainy day.The grounds are nice, although the paths are somewhat muddy, so not great to navigate on a rainy day.We got to see some alligators and some cranes. The grounds are well-maintained and the history bits are interesting, but this is far too expensive for what you get. I would pay 5$ for this, but 29$/pp is outrageous."
168,Visit the grounds not the house,"Enjoyed our visit there grounds are amazing oak trees hundred of years old, each one bigger and bigger.  Learned alot on the carriage ride tour and then did the house tour which was also informative.  Sadly it started pouring after the house tour and we didn't get to go tour the rest of the property.  Can only imagine what it would look like in the spring with all of the flowers in bloom.  All in all nice visit."
169,View of the Past,We were fortunate to visit on a sunny but mild day as the azaleas were in bloom.  New little lambs were frolicking.  Spent several hours there walking the grounds and listening to tour guides.  Pleasant way to spend a day out from Charleston.
170,Great place with one caveat ,"Middleton Place has absolutely gorgeous gardens!! The house was burned by the Northern Forces during the Civil War so there is not a house to tour. There are, however, stables, a blacksmith workshop, a pottery spinning demonstration and a slave shack that has a very detailed history of slave life. The flowering plants and ponds are breathtaking!"
171,A Fairy Tale Wedding,"Go when you have a few hours to spend. The garden walk is lovely and will take some time. It is mostly level, so not difficult, and the views are wonderful. Definitely tour the house. Our tour guide was wonderful! She practically grew up there and told us many interesting personal facts about the items on display."
172,Carolina Trip,"A plantation tour was our our Charleston bucket list. We picked Middleton because it was on the National Historic list. There are many complementary tours available, so allow lots of time for them. All of the tour guides did an excellent job and didn't white-wash the history of the place. It was made very clear that it was the enslaved people who made Middleton what it was. No apology was made for the Union burning the houses and other structures to the ground in order to stop what was going on. Beautifully restored, thanks to later generations of the family, this place really does a great job of presenting history. As one guide said, ""Not all history is good history, but we need to learn it just the same, lest we repeat it."" Truer words have never been spoken."
173,Middleton Plantation does not fully explore the experience of the enslaved,"We stayed at the inn and toured the gardens the next day. We took a tour of the house and walked around the gardens. Be careful by the waters edge, we saw a bunch of alligators."
174,Our new favorite!,"Out of all the historical places in the Charleston area, Middleton Place is by far the best!! Take the house tour to learn about the plantation. You wont be dissapointed."
175,So much history,This is an expansive property with beautiful restored gardens. The main structures were burned at the end of the Civil War however one of the adjacent buildings houses an interesting museum. This is definitely a nice place to visit outside of The city of Charleston.
176,"I want to give you some practical information about  Middleton Place, Drayton Hall and Magnolia Plantation",Pineapple tours is the way to get to Middleton Place Plantation. Benjamin our driver was funny and knowledgeable about the area. We chose the morning tour which included lunch at the Middleton Place restaurant. The food was excellent and the tour of the house and grounds was amazing. Totally recommend this tour to anyone visiting Charleston.
177,Spend the day..,"We’ve been to a few plantations in Charleston and finally made it to Middleton Place.  It is our new favorite!  The staff truly loves being there and it shows.  The history of this place is the highlight and the people know their stuff.  The house, stables and all the grounds are amazing and well kept!  We’ll be back..."
178,National Treasure,A great venue.Advice to managers: the clerks selling tickets should not say:  make sure to go to see this part of the facility to learn about “slavery and stuff...”
179,Lovely way to spend a day,As guests of the Inn at Middletown we I was given free access to the grounds and the Museum.The property was number 1 through 33. So we started with one and continued about halfway before we got overheated. Our plan was to complete it the next day but we became so busy and then had to leave which was disappointing.The grounds are beautiful and I haven't seen anything to compare to the natural raw state  of nature at this place.We also took the tour of the museum/house and there were two guides that were absolutely excellent. I wish I remembered their names but I don't and they gave us so much information and answered all of our questions. It was amazing to learn. I wish the heat didn't cause us to end our tour.
180,Gorgeous,"Although our visit to Middleton Place was on a 90+ day in October and there was less blooming in the gardens, our garden and house tour were still quite informative and enjoyable. The reflecting pools/ponds, terraced lawns and historic background provided by staff made this a worthwhile visit. The restaurant was also quite good. Hope to come back in the spring when there is more in bloom."
181,Pleasure,"The actor portraying Ms Hattie did an amazing job bringing slavery to life with song and stories. There are also folks inside buildings. The gentleman in the carpenter shop taught a great lesson on how to make barrels, and rice production. The gardens are vast and lovely. Middleton Place was also the only plantation I found with student pricing. We really appreciated that."
182,Beautiful Landscapes and natural scenerey,"We toured the Edmonston-Alston House and then bought tickets to do a ""quick tour"" of the Middleton Place Plantation.  This is the southern plantation we wanted to experience.  We toured the grounds and the formal gardens.  Due to time - we did not have time to tour the house.  The gardens alone with the river views are worth a visit to Middleton Place.  Truly a work of art!"
183,Great Plantation but Tours are lacking..,"What an amazing experience! It was worth every penny of the $44 per person charge to visit the plantation and the house museum. There are blacksmith and carpenter still working on the property who love telling you what would be their tasks during the pre and post civil war eras. Visitors will also be greeted by roaming sheep who seem to be constantly looking for greener grass. Additionally, the history of the very political and wealthy Middleton Family is extremely interesting."
184,Beautiful plantation and grounds ,"IF you want to walk in beauty and history this is the place to go.   Make sure you allow at least three hours.  So very much to see.  Make sure you also, take the guided tour.  I learned so much and was amazed by the History.   You have so much freedom to wonder the estate and you will feel like you stepped into the past with old structures.  You are allowed to go through these buildings and read their history.Our guide (DUFFY) was above and beyond so knowledgeable.   She provided so much information about history, the folks that lived and died at the plantation.  She knew so much about the plants, trees and how the plantation worked.  BIG PLUS was her personality.   You just wanted to hang on to each word.Make this a must to visit when you visit Charleston."
185,A Must See while Visiting Charleston,"This plantation offers visitors a sense of what plantation life was like, not only for the owners but also for the slaves. The guides point out that slave labor made everything possible. They did not gloss over what forced labor was like.  Our tour of the house was exceptional. The guide took time to explain and answer questions.  A look back into Gullah culture was the highlight of the experience. Don’t forget to take the carriage ride. Because the welfare of the horses and other animals are always considered, book your ride in the early morning. Charleston is hot in the summer and carriage rides are often not booked in the heat of the day. The guides gave a wonderful overview of farm life in the 1800’s. This was our favorite Charleston plantation."
186,So much beauty.,This is an exceptional garden. This was my second visit....the first was to see the Camilias and not to see the Rhodies and Azailias. I have been in many gardens but one thing that I love about Middleton Place is the beautiful care and maintenance that is lavished on it. It is the most delightful place.
187,A bit overpriced,"We pre-booked our afternoon tour through Pineapple Tours which included bus transportation from the visitor center, all the cold water you wanted, a delicious lunch at Middleton Place, a house tour, and about a hour to walk the grounds.  It was about $105.   If you drove yourself and without lunch, it is $29 for admission plus $15 for the house tour or $44.It is a 30 minute ride from the visitor center leaving at noon and arriving around 12:45 pm.(1:00 - 2:20 pm) Lunch at Middleton Place was a soup or salad (get the soup!)  Shrimp and Grits or BBQ pork sandwich, and ice cream. My husband chose the buffet instead which had salad, fried chicken,  catfish, pulled BBQ pork sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and the ice cream for dessert.  Tip was extra.(2:30 - 3:15 pm) The house tour was nice - the main receiving room, summer and winter bedrooms, child's room, library and dining room.  The house was lived in but was more of a guest house, since the main house was burned down during the Civil War.  No pictures on the house tour are allowed.Outside the house is like a mini-Williamsburg with a blacksmith, cooper who makes buckets, domestic area where sample candles and other items were displayed, and the farm with sheep, chickens, and horses.  There is a mock-up of Eliza's house or a slave quarters with a list of the 900 slaves the Middleton's had among their several plantations.  There was a plantation chapel, but there was not much to it.  Teh The house is built next to the Ashley River, and the gardens and forest area were very nice to walk around.  There are alligators in the water.The terraced hills in the pictures looked very sculpted, but in real life they were softer and less noticable.There are two gift shops, an outside Garden Market, and an air conditioned Museum. In the outside one, there are blacksmith and cooper hand-made items, jelly, and honey and other nice things. The inside one has more traditional gifts and trinkets.4:30 pm -  Return to bus and leave at 4:45 pm.So, about 3.5 - 4 hours is enough time to have lunch and walkaround and see everything.  If you aren't going to walk in the forest, then you will be done sooner."
188,Beautiful Grounds,"We spent a lovely morning at Middleton Place. The house tour was interesting, as this plantation continues to be managed by the original family. Walking in the beautiful gardens was relaxing. Staff were available at different points to answer questions and give insights into the plantation."
189,Guided tours,"Have to agree with the other reviewers who found Middleton Place to be historically sugar coated. The gardens are beautiful for sure and the staff were very friendly and willing to answer questions,  but I personally they didn't appreciate their approach to telling the story of the slaves who worked there. Also found it to be very expensive- $90 for 2 people to visit the gardens and see the interior of the house. Would recommend this for people interested in viewing the gardens and a peaceful walk or picnic outside."
190,Beautiful and interesting plantation,"Sadly we did not have a lot of time to explore the garden thoroughly, but you could spend a lot of time here as there was a lot to do.  We explored the remains of the house and the gardens that had camellias and magnolias.  The old live oak was impressive even with the missing limbs.  We did not have time to go through the house (separate admission), but we heard from many that it was impressive.  We heard a couple of tour groups as we passed with impressive guides."
191,Beautiful grounds,This is the first plantation we visited late in the afternoon and took a tour of the residence.  We came off season to not fight the crowds of tourists.  We didn’t get to see the whole plantation because we ran out of time.  It was ok not great.
192,Overpriced ,"Very interesting and historical plantation.  We called in advance to ask if they had wheel chairs available, as one in our party couldn't walk well.  They said they did have two.  One was available, and our handicapped friend was glad he could participate.  However, the paths were mostly dirt and gravel, with steps up and down in many places.  Pushing a wheelchair around this property is almost impossible. Can't imagine why they'd even provide them.  The parking was also very confusing, they had handicap, but it wasn't easy to find.I might go back to tour the property again, but would certainly not take anyone with me who needs a wheelchair."
193,Middleton Place,"This is a great side trip if you are near Charleston. And yes, you could literally spend most of your day there. The place is huge. And even though we went in the heat of the summer, there was plenty of flora to indulge in. The landscape architecture is breathtaking and is taken care of by a small group of people who really love plants. The on-site restaurant has a small but delicious menu. The stables have a couple of unusual animals, but also feature beautiful horses and free-roaming sheep! We learned some fun facts about the area from the Blacksmith in one of the exhibition areas.So many hidden jewels there for the most amazing pictures. Lovely place - can't wait to visit it again sometime during the spring!"
194,Best Thing to Visit in Charleston,"We started our tour with a carriage ride around part of property. While the guide was informative, the carriage itself was far too small (or the people too big). The carriage is supposed to seat 14 but we had 12 and were tightly packed.The house tour, about 30 minutes, was very informative. It ended about lunch time so we walked over to the restaurant and had the buffet lunch.Afterwards, we walked through the stable area as well as the gardens throughout the property. As it was late April, many of plants hadn't blossomed yet. Still, it was a nice walk around a very picturesque property."
195,Must Visit,"Have visited Charleston ten times but never ventured out as far as Middleton Place ..we did the combo ticket with the Edmondston-Alston house on the battery on friday and the plantation/gardens on a saturday morning. The in town house tour takes 30-45 minutes and gives a unique perspective of how  they lived while in the city. The furniture, carpets, art all belong to various generations of the families that lived there, and some of the remaining relatives live on the third floor to this day. So saturday am we motored out to the plantation with my brother in law who runs a landscape business so the gardens were as relevant as the main house. The main house was destroyed as the war ended, so you tour many of the out buildings and flanking buildings that were built at the same time and were used by the family as a refuge. Paintings, art work, furniture, its all perfect to the time period, and the plantation is a working farm with stables, ironsmith, and of course the gardens. Duffy took us on the most  informative tour of the gradens , and we were in awe of the formal gardens, ponds, landscaping, and historic flora and fauna. We did stop for brief snack in the restaurant and the tour of the house/gardens was 3-4 hours and there was still more to see.  A great half day or full day for seasoned citizens when in the Charleston area."
196,Disappointed,"I have spent a good bit of time here.  It is expensive to visit but well worth it.  A strong effort has been made to show the origional plantation and its gsrdens,  Well worth a visit."
197,Lovely plantation and gardens!,Visited Middleton Place on the way to a long weekend in Charleston and so glad we did! This actually was a great history refresher on events leading up to and through the Civil War.  The Middleton family was right in the thick of it going back to the Declaration of Independence. The grounds at Middleton Place are beautiful and vast and also include natural sightings of alligators and a full fledged farm including almost a dozen baby lambs.Bought the combo tour which gives you the ground access and house tour of Middleton Place as well as the house tour of the Edmonton-Alston house right on the harbor in Historic Charleston.  This was a good deal as it is all tied together and the Edmonton-Alston house gives you a direct perspective of what was happening there during the siege on Fort Sumter.Highly recommend a trip here if you are in the area but allow at least 3-4 hours to get the whole experience.
198,Pineapple tour to Middleton Place,The history of Middleton Place is very illustrative of the South and how it could not survive without the horror of slavery.  I did not feel that it romanticized the antebellum but told its history.  Most of what is seen now was developed after the Civil War.  Imagine the fury of the New York 54th that burned and pillaged after marching through snake and alligator infested swamps with the fever of malaria to find the brutally treatment the slaves experienced.  It was must have been much like the 101st  finding the concentration camps during world war two.  I enjoyed the beauty of the gardens but felt the overwhelming sense of oppression that permeates Charleston that is possible only because of the labor of the enslaved.  These plantations were brutal work camps the owners avoiding spending summers there.  I left with an appreciation of the beauty of the place but a heavy heart as to the human toll exacted by the antebellum culture.
199,dont forget to bring your bug spray!,"We did the ""Spend the Day"" tour which included a tour of the house, a carriage tour of the property, and the slave tour.  I think it might have included a gardens tour also, but we skipped that and just toured the gardens on our own.  All tour presentations were very informative and professionally presented.  This was a great experience to learn about history of plantation life and the civil war period.  We also had lunch at the restaurant on site.  The She Crab soup was wonderful."
200,Tours are great!,Took the tour with Pineapple group.Our driver to and from was very informative.Loved the okanaptatiin tour and excellent lunch
201,Ok. ,"We toured the grounds with a private guide we had booked separately (Charleston History Tours - Joyce Weir) and very much enjoyed it. The gardens were pretty, photo ops all over, the remaining house, the stables and slaves quarters all had stories to tell. We learned a lot. The gift shop was nice and surprisingly the chicken salad was yummy. We had great weather but I think it would get pretty hot in the summer months. Definitely worth the drive"
202,Great place to visit,"My husband and I are staying at the Inn at Middleton Place and the price of admission to the Middleton Place Tours is included. We are so happy that we spend the time (about 6 hours) touring the place.The guides were very impressive and quite knowledgeable on history. We toured the entire property from the gardens, slave quarters, cooperage, blacksmith shop and the Middleton House Museum. The gardens where in 1786 the French botanist Andre Michaux gave the Middletons the first four Camellia Japonicas to be planted in an America garden. the House Museum has a wonderful family collection including Benjamin West portraits. The guides showed examples of corn grinding, spinning, coopers making barrels for storage that was once used for storage and shipment of rice, and blacksmith's repairing historical household items. The Eliza House is a two-family dwelling showing the African American community at Middleton Place both before and after the Civil War.We had lunch at the Restaurant and had delightful Fried Green Tomatoes, Quail and Catfish."
203,Love the guided history,"We were fortunate enough to attend this beautiful place as a start to our lonvely Charleston trip.  Could not be more pleased with our introduction to Charleston or history of the South!While our can be quite pricey for out of Towners, it is well worth the price of admission!  While not intended, we happen to go during the height of the garden blooms and really really enjoyed the tour of the gardens included with admission.We arrived arround 10:30 am and needed to grab a quick bite to eat before going on the carriage ride and house tour.  We went to the market located across from the parking lot and enjoyed an incredible ""light snack"" of a huge chicken salad sandwich (do  yourself a favor and give the market a try - - worth the price of admission itself!  Our only regret was not buying two of these!)We then proceeded to the carriage tour which was an incredible experience.  We were given a history of the grounds and of the hourses pulling the carriage.  We then toured the house, which seemed to be rushed, but was full of history, and not to be missed.We followed that with the most amazing lunch at middleton place restaurant.  The buffet was closed due to the recent Coronavirus, but we were able to order off the standard menu.  Enjoyed an amazing lunch for a reasonable price.Also took the Beyond the Fields tour which is highly recommended.  The speakers go into great detail about the life of slaves and the politics at work.If I were to only go to a single plantation in Charelston, this would be it....go and enjoy! The cost of admission is well worth it!"
204,Magnificent gardens enriched with fascinating history,Got engaged her several years ago. Come back every year and have a picnic under live oaks on lawn. One of our favorite places in whole world
205,"So much beauty, it is difficult to take it all in.","Get there early! Definitely can spend a few hours here exploring and taking yourself back in time.  One of my favorite plantations in Charleston.  Experience life as it was so many years ago, take a break from technology and your cell phones, walk around the gardens and see all the wildlife.  Ride on a carriage, milk a cow, learn about being a blacksmith, take a house tour.  Just such a special place."
206,Great Garden and House Tour,"Don't live too far from here and wanted a quick, overnight getaway for our anniversary.  We have done this a couple of years now.   We always enjoy eating dinner at the Inn.  The rustic feel of the rooms and beautiful, peaceful grounds are perfect for a night to get away from the chaos of life."
207,Wonderful Day Trip out of Charleston,We thoroughly enjoyed the quick drive to Middleton and thought the site was beautiful. The tour time we spent about 3.5-4 hrs taking all three tours. They all had interesting facts provided. Our favorite guide that was extremely witty was the older gentleman giving the garden tour. He reminded me of Tony Bennett looks and made the tour so much more of an entertaining experience.
208,Interesting history and alligators!,"We went out to Middleton Place to see a classic plantation and we were not disappointed.  Although the ladies at the check in booth were a little crabby we soon were on our way to the main house for a tour.  The guide was informative but she was a little flighty.  I still loved seeing the house and hearing the history of the plantation, the area, and the history involved.  The grounds are remarkable and it didn't require a long visit to get a good sense of it all.  We were there 4 hours and it was just right."
209,Beautiful gardens,"Middleton Place is on a very large property, make sure you have walking shoes. It is quite beautiful with gorgeous very very old Oaks.  Make sure you take the tours and learn the history.  Interestingly, the plantation kept a very accurate list of slaves and their jobs---this is great for genealogists.  Many animals are kept on the grounds, always interesting to see.  I would say it should not be a short visit as you will miss much.  The house tour is interesting as well.  This house is what is left of a grand three building residences.  It has many fine portraits of the family thru' the years as well as period furniture.  See if you can find the bench that bounces by the shops.Since we had a large group, we arranged for a luncheon there that was absolutely delicious."
210,Beautiful gardens,"Absolutely wonderful plantation visit. I researched all of the local plantations & felt like overall this seemed the most recommended. And boy, was it WONDERFUL! The grounds were so beautiful to walk through (even in the rain)! And although the house isn’t the original main hour, the docent led tour is still excellent & there are some amazing relics inside. The highlight, in my opinion, were the live history actors who demonstrated how different livelihood work was done (barrel making, pottery making, blacksmithing, etc...) They were so knowledgeable and such a joy to talk with. We learned so much! There were many livestock animals as well, which was so charming and added to the real ness. I would highly recommend this plantation if you are only doing one on your visit - it gives you a taste of everything!"
211,Truly Exceptional,Decided to visit Middleton Plantation for the first time. Have been to Charleston probably 30 times and have never visited this Plantation.  My family and I were down visiting my parents who are snow birds here so decided to visit on a beautiful 72 degree day. Always seemed so expensive compared to the other plantations so that’s why we never chose to go to Middleton. I have to say it’s totally worth the price and turned out to be one of my favorites we have visited! Yes it seems a little pricey but it includes so much and many included tours. We spent about 3 hours and still didn’t see everything! We definitely will be back next year to see the rest. I loved seeing all the camillas in bloom and the animals roaming around! All the live oaks were full of Spanish moss and were just beautiful. We took the about the breeds tour since my four year old was with us. The tour guide was very interesting and had lots of information about the animals. They treat their animals like family there. We also took the Slavery tour that met in front of Elizas house. Tour guide gave a good overview about slavery. Slavery is such an awful time in our history and I’m glad Middleton included a tour that taught about it. Some of the other plantations in the area have you read plaques about slavery and this tour seemed much more informative then just reading information on a wall. Overall that’s all we got done in one day at the plantation. My daughter was getting hungry. I will be back to finish the rest of the gardens and enjoy this beautiful property!
212,Beautiful,Bought discount tickets online which was a good idea.  Tour guides are very knowledgeable.  Best parts were the tours included in the general admission ticket.  Make sure to visit the interactive areas around the stables.  Wonderful!
213,Time Travel,"August heat was unbearable so I would suggest arriving early to walk the grounds. House tour doesn't start until 11:00 so I thoroughly enjoyed walking the gardens, the farm and cultural area, seeing the animals grazing on the mansion lawn and listening to the cobbler and blacksmith as they plied their trade. Beautiful furnishings inside mansion and great docents to tell the family story. Ate lunch at the restaurant and it was delicious. I had the pulled pork meal and service was excellent with a great view of the area."
214,Very beautiful,"My wife loved the place and the house tour. I felt for the $120 spent including a mediocre lunch, pass. If you are a keen historian and love relishing in owning slaves, this is for you."
215,Get a Glimpse of Plantation Life and Have a Great Lunch,"Allow most of the day to tour this HUGE plantation. It has been stewarded successfully by the same Middleton family since the 1600s. Acres of perfectly manicured gardens, elegant walking paths, and beautiful gardens will take you all day to enjoy. A working farm supplies many of the vegetable for the on-site restaurant. Demonstrations of pottery throwing, rice threshing and processing, and historical depiction of the slaves who worked the property were well represented, albeit heartbraking, There are no superlatives to describe how helpful the docents are and how impeccable the Plantation is."
216,Terrific historic gardens at Middleton Place Plantation,"We have done many of the plantations in South Carolina and enjoyed touring this one like many of the others. The staging was fantastic such as the blacksmith who took us through his work and gave us a demonstration. The stables were open and we were allowed to pet the beautiful horses. The history of slavery tour was a bit long and wasn't as focused as I would have liked. The tour of the main house was interesting but the women that were the tour guides were very unfriendly. I'm not sure if the were trying to be in character or were just that way. But if you changed their clothing and thickened their accents, you would swear they were from 1850 and residents of the big house. Overall though, it is definitely worth the visit."
217,Best Plantation to see!,"I picked this Plantaion Trip because I saw somewhere that you could milk a cow.  I was able to do that! So that is a 5 right there. Beyond that the grounds are lovely.  The staff is very well trained, knowledgeable, and helpful.  I liked the fact that they were pretty open about the ugliness of slavery. One of the guides even said the wealth that was created was not free, it was built on the backs of the ""enslaved Africans"". It is amazing to see what people thought was okay, and to know how far things have come. They have a tour to explore the living circumstances of the African slaves and free persons. The visit was amazing for me. A little dreamy as you take a carriage ride, see the animals, tour the house. It's a little like time travel, with free people getting paid for their work."
218,Riding with the alligators,Visited Middleton with Pineapple Tour Group and it was a terrific day.  The trip to the plantation was informative and fun with our tour guide providing comic relief as well as a video about the history of the place and families who have owned and inhabited Middleton Place.  The grounds are fantastic and the house tour was very good.
219,lovely,Friends and I stopped off for lunch at the cafe and for some fried chicken and grits.  We sat overlooking the water.  Beautiful view.   Walked the grounds after lunch and encountered baby alligators.  Watch out for them!   Wonderful gardens and grounds.   The folks running the gift shop are all very friendly.  Highly recommend if you are in the area.
220,Fun but on the pricey side ,"I visited Middleton Place with a tour provided by Pineapple Tours. The owner, Benjamin, looked after us really well and provided us with useful tips and information about the plantation (pack plenty of water, sunscreen and mosquito repellent). I found him very knowledgable, friendly and courteous, particularly with those of us who were less mobile. The plantation has stunning scenery and gardens. The house itself contains a lot of personal items from the Middleton family and the ladies who showed us around gave us a very good insight about its history. A three course lunch was included in the tour with a selection of local dishes. Thoroughly recommend it."
221,Just okay,"Beside the fact that Middleton place is a well maintained and beautiful property they fail to convey the horrors that happened on the property! The tone used by the staff is simply off, this is not Disneyland but an historic landmark where difficult topics need to be discussed with a sober tone and facts.The Middleton should not be praised for the success and the fortune that they built on the back of others! The 1 star rate is for the absolutely unacceptable following comment from Bo during the museum visit:""The slaves that lived here with them (the Middleton), worked for them and loved them""Loved them? Really! Wow... Get a grasp of what you are talking about here!"
222,Interesting history,"We were in Charleston in September and had time to visit only one plantation.  Unfortunately, we chose Middleton Place, largely based on reviews and website description that they had numerous gardens, heirloom animals, live displays, etc.  We paid $39 per person ($10 discount because we'd visited a town home) and took the house tour.  Very nice guide but significant hearing challenge meant she didn't hear or answer any of our questions for our 4 person group.  When I inquired about the gardens, one guide told me it was too hot for flowers and that I should come in the Spring.  The primary gardens we saw were boxwood and other shrubs.  The heirloom animals were visible only briefly.  The artisans demonstrating their craft were an extremely friendly potter, a very withdrawn blacksmith (sort of ""must you watch me?"") and a cooper without much to say.  I did not complain on site but called to do so and was told by the curt person at the ticket office ""no refunds!""  Not ""what could we do to improve?"" or ""I'm sorry that was your experience."""
223,"An attractive, authentic and engaging slice of Southern history","We've traveled a lot in the US and Europe, but Middleton Place in March with the azaleas blooming is one of the most beautiful sights we've seen. No wonder the Middleton gardens are recognized as some of the finest in the world. Every little bend in a path takes you to another picture-postcard perfect spot. I especially appreciated that there are strategically located benches throughout the extensive grounds so that any time you feel like sitting to soak up the beauty and serenity of the moment you can. This is also helpful for folks who tire easily. I strongly recommend paying extra for both the house tour and the carriage ride. Normally I don't go in for carriage rides out of concern for the horses, but the guide on the carriage tour explained that pulling the carriage was easy work for the two very large draft horses . The carriage tour is really a way to get around the plantation so that the narrator can describe the history, plantation life, economics and botany/vegetation. The guide was very knowledgeable and very personable. The house tour was also very interesting. There originally were a main house and two flanking houses for the very large Middleton family. Only one flanking house survived the Civil War. General admission, the carriage ride and the house tour came to slightly over $100 for two people (about $55 each). I felt it was money well spent considering what we got. We arrived around 9 am and left at 3:30 pm. We could have stayed longer but it was a weekday and wanted to leave before rush hour. There's no charge for the excellent talk on the history of slavery and slave life at Middleton. Sign up to attend a talk when you buy your tickets. The lunch at the restaurant was also excellent with lovely views from large windows. There are also benches to picnic.There is a gift shop with sandwiches and snacks near the parking lot."
224,"Interesting, but not handicap friendly.","We stayed at the Inn at Middleton Place, with no real concept of Middleton Place itself until we checked in.  Yet two minutes walk from our beautiful room at the Inn we discovered the incredible beauty, value, and enriching experience of walking the paths and gardens of Middleton Place.  It's like a convergence of Mt Vernon, Duke Gardens, and, with the Inn, Fallingwater all in one delightful and thoroughly enjoyable place.  We intend to come back next year, avid supporters of a Place that we had never even heard about until we booked our room at The Inn.  Not to be missed!"
225,Beatiful PlantationI,"Did not do House tour. Grounds were very nice. Focused stops for mini-lectures, which were not too pedantic but were frank in discussion of co-participation of Southerners, Northerners, & English in creating the slave culture. Azaleas starting to bloom- definitely high point. Sense of history, although nothing like Mount Vernon, but clearly got insight into patrician culture @1760's. Lovely drive out from Charleston through lovely live oak shading the Ashley River Rd."
226,#2 but a must,"I was hesitant about visiting a plantation as I didn’t want to support a place that glorified the old south, but a friend bought our group tickets so I went. Overall I felt like the place attempted to be balanced in their representation of plantation life, but ultimately failed to fully present a well-rounded picture. We took the tour of the main house and I felt like the guide did a nice job of just giving the facts. (Some very interesting!) We weren’t made to think the family was a great family and they let us draw our own conclusion. But the main tour was just about the main house. There was a separate tour regarding the enslaved people's quarters (you can also see this area on your own and it’s eye opening). I really think the two should be combined for a full, balanced view. The staff is obviously knowledgeable and care about the guests and it would be so much more interesting to combine all aspects of the location. Th grounds are interesting to walk around and you could easily spend several hours seeing all there is to see."
227,Beautiful and Interesting ,"We choose Middleton as the concierge said this was less of a ""disney-style"" plantation experience. The main house no longer stands (FYI). The place is stunning which is a little strange as you think of the horror of enslaved people; that said they do a good job about making you think about that time period from many perspectives. It's a beautiful property; the free roaming animals are a treat and the gardens lovely."
228,Great day trip,"Try for the earliest morning carriage ride tour.  It is an added cost, but so worth it.  I scored a solo carriage ride with two riders early on a Monday morning.  It was fabulous, even though they told me it was shortened.  I enjoyed all the other tours and recommend taking each of them, the beyond the fields tour, the historic livestock breeds, the garden tour and the house museum tour.  The Foundation docents are wonderful, committed, engaged and interesting folks who have each done a tremendous amount of research for their tour."
229,"Beautiful grounds, strange guide, re-fighting the civil war",We had a quick couples get away to Charleston and started off with a trip to Middleton Place. Spent about four hours wandering the gardens and grounds and could still go back to see it again. Great farm area with lots of animals. We even visited with some small alligators on the banks of the water areas. This was a fabulous stop and we couldn’t have asked for a better visit!
230,Great way to spend the morning.,"We only had time for one plantation tour while in Charleston and chose Middleton Place.  It was a great choice!  We did not do a formal tour, but rather just strolled around the gardens and grounds.  The setting is stunning and the gardens impressive.  It was a beautiful and relaxing day."
231,Wonderful plantation full of history,Step into to time and come to understand the impact of many people on American history. Without understanding it is impossible to understand the story of human resilience and ingenuity.
232,Call me Scarlet,"We attended a family wedding at the Middleton Plantation this past weekend and it was wonderful from start to finish.  The venue for the service was beneath a huge live oak with water in the background, which was truly memorable.  The cocktail reception following the service was on a lawn next to a pond and was again beautiful.  The service/bartenders were professional but friendly and were serving throughout both the cocktail reception and later during the reception itself.  The reception hall is a modern building but served the purpose well; it was also surrounded by beautiful tress and gardens.  The venue was perfect for a wedding and reception."
233,Important historical visit,"The tour guides, mostly volunteers, provide an excellent historical account of the property. Each tour overlaps regarding certain elements of the story, but they all provide a unique understanding of plantation life. The grounds are beautiful!"
234,Most interesting!,"For my wife and I, Middleton Place was the highlight of a two week trip through Georgia and the Carolinas.  After immediately putting us at ease with his friendly and approachable manner, our guide Gary vividly and accurately described the daily lives of both slave and owner.  As a history teacher I was very impressed with his breadth of knowledge and the ease with which he was able to bring the working plantation to life with his words.  It was a strongly emotional experience to walk through such an amazingly beautiful place and hear how it was built with wealth generated from the blood, sweat, and lives of the enslaved.    We toured the grounds and the house, and I would recommend both.  I only wish I could describe our tour as well as Gary described life at Middleton Place, all I can do is suggest that you go see for yourself.  I read a couple of negative reviews about this same tour and my advice is to ignore them, especially if you like history.   You will not regret your decision."
235,Spend the day tour,"We enjoyed our plantation visit, but with slightly mixed feelings. The plantation itself is quite lovely and very well-maintained; the grounds are immaculate and some of the views are very pretty. They have a lot to see on site, both in the historical and natural senses. The house tour was done very well, with lots of historical tidbits and information - the reason I did not give this 5* was because the manner in which the historical aspects of slavery were presented was slightly 'disturbing' and felt a little skewed - not that it was inaccurate, but more the presentation style and tone in which it was presented...terms applied to the African-Americans and their roles in the house and on the grounds. While I am not a historical buff by any means, or have any ties to the history of slavery, it all felt a little off and uncomfortable."
236,Quite a Place,"We had attended a wedding over the weekend.  Middleton Place was the perfect respite from the whirlwind weekend.  Camellias and azaleas 🌺 were somewhat in bloom and other plants were waking up on this early March visit.  A 900 year old Live Oak tree and the beautiful vista overlooking a river, a flooded rice field, and terraced landscape were just some of the highlights.  These grounds are great for couples, families, and individuals looking for a relaxing time enjoying nature.  Visit the restaurant for a great lunch."
237,Astonishing manicured gardens,Middleton plantation is a worthwhile stop if you’re in and around Charleston. We wish we had longer there but if you want to do everything you need more then 2 hours. The historical meaning of the plantation is well documented there and very informative. Take the tour and buy the tour of the plantation house! If it’s hot weather it’s hard to imagine how the enslaved survived.
238,Enchanting,"I guess I expected it to be a bit more grand. The aerial pictures do it an enormous justice, but the plantation grounds were dry and the flowers needed watering. The house tour was okay, but the staff was a bit unfriendly.  The restaurant/bar staff were very nice and accommodating."
239,Beautiful grounds and a Look back into history ,"We visited on a weekday morning in June and spent four hours.  Encourage a summer visit to start as early as the grounds open.  They are well maintained but this place is huge!!  Gardens are lovely.  We toured the house and especially learned a great deal from Greg, the docent working there.  He has a passion for not only the Plantation but history surrounding it and the area.  It is a bit out of the way but worth the time.  Even starting at 9 am it gets hot quickly so plan accordingly.  At least there are plenty of benches in the shade to stop and marvel at the grounds."
240,Leslie and Megan,"We had a wonderful day at Middleton!  We were not on time for our carriage ride and I was concerned about the long walk for my senior aged MIL, but Kaleena took care of us!  She made sure we were rescheduled, and drove us on the golf cart where we needed to be, and even picked us up after lunch.  The landscaped grounds and old trees are beautiful.  We would love to visit again because we didn’t get to everything on the property since we ran out of time."
241,Interesting Place to Visit,"We drove out and there was so much to see. We really didn’t leave enough time, i would plan on about 3-4  hours, you could easily spend 5 hours. The staff and volunteers make the guided tours fantastic. They bring to life the plantation and it rich history.  Definitely will return on my next trip."
242,Beautiful,It is just not the beauty of Middleton that is its treasure. The history of Middleton is entwined in the history of the United States since the Revolutionary War.
243,Beautiful grounds and house,"it was my first time to be in a Plantation Bay, but wow, i did not expect it to be this vast and beautiful. TBH, you can spend a whole day here, and not even see everything. We arrived late morning, but for some reason, there were fewer people by the afternoon. I am not sure if they are all in various tours, but the middle ground itself didn't have much people anymore.My kids like seeing the horses, chicken and sheep. They even tried following the sheep around for a few minutes. :) staff was friendly overall, and you can ask them for directions in case you get lost."
244,Beautiful and serene step back in time -,"Underwhelmed by the lack of reverence for the enslaved. A pseudo tour that purports to tell the story of the enslaved is overshadowed by the details of the overlords, the moneyed folks, paintings, antiques and most importantly detailed histories. Much different is the lack of names, erased memories and ghosts of the enslaved. Middleton must dig deeper and find its soul!Best go to the Slave Mart..."
245,Amazing place to visit,"Upon arrival we were greeted by free range sheep. Absolutely beautiful! We greatly appreciated the $5 student admission!!! Buy tickets online. My mom, 16 year old daughter, and I greatly enjoyed walking the grounds of Middleton Place together. We highly recommend buying a bottle of the all natural bug spray before beginning your tour. It worked!!! The gardens are beautiful and very well maintained. The trail paths are easy to follow. Due to my mom’s health, we walked probably half of them. Our visit to Eliza’s House was the most moving part of our visit. The tour guide present was very knowledgeable and shared so much history with us in a conversational way. We were impressed she was willing to say, “I do not know,” when asked a question she did not know the answer to. She was also very intentional to preface what there is historical evidence for and what is presumption or folklore. The House Museum was open for self guided tours with a guide on each level to answer questions. Masks are required and provided within the House Museum. The restaurant was open, but we did not eat there. The farm exhibits had two staff members available to answer questions; it was not a full working exhibit today, which was fine with us. The signage is adequate for a self guided tour. We spent approximately 4 hours at Middleton Place. Depending on pace and interest, one could easily spend a full day."
246,Love it!,"I completly enjoyed my visit.  While the house was closed for scheduled repairs, there was still pleanty to see and do.  The grounds are amazing, the sheep friendly and all the staff very helpful.  I opted to pay the additional $18 for the carriage ride.  It was worth the cost for the added history and highlights of Middleton Place."
247,Magnificent,"Visiting a plantation was high on my priority list as a a New Englander where we just don’t have this kind of history. It’s a beautiful and peaceful place (watch out for gators!), but with an obviously troubling past with its connections to slavery. The focus is not on this slave history, but it is acknowledged. The restaurant was delicious and the entire experience was worth the trip. Highly recommend pineapple tours package for this."
248,Middleton,"On the day that I visited there were very few people here and that actually added to the atmosphere while walking through the grounds.  Very nice staff here, well manicured grounds, a truly delightful restaurant with some low country cooking....The oak trees are spectacular but the gardens were disappointing, very little colour.  Plenty of places to sit in the shade while taking in the magnificent vistas.Best of all....the slave talk given by one of their education specialists.  Highly interesting and informative.  A must do during a visit here."
249,Middleton vs. Magnolia,"While at Middleton Plantation I took the Beyond the Fields tour with Gary. Gary was not a concise speaker, and rather than focusing on the experience of the enslaved at Middleton gave a lengthy tour that focused on the general history of slavery in the US, starting with the middle passage and summing up with Dred Scott. While this information would be useful to tourist without a basic understanding of US history (we did have some foreign tourist who most likely appreciated it) it was frustrating when that ended up being the main part of the tour. We left the freedman's cabin area (Gary also never mentioned what the freedmen and women who stayed ended up at Middleton Plantation after the war), and continued on to the ruins of the original house, leveled by Union soldiers. Here Gary spent a lot of time talking about the family (which was again frustrating by the conclusion of the tour because we ended up getting very little information about the enslaved). I think his intention was to explain that this area was perfect for rice cultivation, but it was a lengthy transition that gave little insight to the experience of the enslaved Africans working the property. When discussing rice plantations, Gary brought up the task system, and seemingly implied that because of it rice plantations may not have been as bad as plantations that worked on a chain gang system. This was quite upsetting considering the horrific conditions on rice plantations, where death rates were extremely high. Gary did credit the knowledge of rice production to enslaved Africans, and explained how rice was grown, but little information was given about the actual experience of the enslaved. Touring the house was quite sad, seeing the wealth that was built in the backs of the enslaved Africans growing rice at Middleton Plantation. It was even more sad in the context of a comment by Debbie, our tour guide. While touring the winter bedroom, she explained how a slave girl would be in charge of warming the sheets for the Middletons. Without pause, she excitedly exclaimed, ""What luxury!"" without a hint of sarcasm. Middleton Plantation has a duty to educate visitors on the experience of the Africans who were forced to labor there, and the horrific conditions of rice plantations. Until they do, I would recommend Charleston visitors see Magnolia Plantation (whose solid interpretation is surprising considering the Drayton family still owns the property and apparently is not afraid to talk about the conditions their family forced Africans to work in), Mcleod Plantation (a sea island cotton plantation that does an excellent job giving voice to the enslaved), the Slave Mart downtown, or even to venture to Georgetown to see the rice museum and rice boat tours."
250,"Beautiful place-alligators, too!","Our daughter in law suggested going to Middleton while we were visiting from out of town.  What a great experience.  You have a choice of guided or self guided tours of the plantation.  We chose thyself guided, and with map in and, set out to explore the area.  The map was easy to follow, the makers gave you insights into what you were looking at, and the scenery was beautiful.  We went at our own pace and enjoyed the entire experience,"
251,Beautiful Gardens,"Went to Middleton Place after seeing an ad online and I'm so glad we did. Went for the weekend and stayed at Middleton Inn on the Plantation. It was wonderful. Lots of history, beautiful gardens, animals, kayaking and horse drawn carriage rides. Will definitely be going again!"
252,Sisters trip,"I wasn't expecting much having never been to a plantation like this before. Wow. We went in the spring so it was a little warm, but not overly hot. The grounds are beautiful. We saw quite a bit of livestock and wildlife roaming around. Watch out for the alligators by the water! The sheep wandering the grounds was a nice treat too. They would even let you walk up and pet them. We took the house tour and the carriage tour. There is a lot of history in that place and ties to the founding fathers."
253,Beautiful gardens and insights into American history,"This would be my #2 recommendation for Plantations to visit with Drayton Hall being #1. They are only 6-8 minutes from each other so visiting both in a day is easy to do.We spent about 2 1/2 hours here which included a self guided grounds tour, lunch at their restaurant and a house tour. Grounds are beautiful, many exhibits showing what life was like in plantation time including tools, machinery, blacksmith shop, outdoor cooking and more.We took the house tour which was good but was of the “flank” house which had become the main house after the main house was burned down. Decorated with furniture from the time period, much of what was original.Well worth your time."
254,Gorgeous Gardens ,"The Middleton Plantation is lovely but I think for what is included it is really expensive, for an Adult it is $29 which fair but then an additional $15 to do the house guided tour I felt was a little expensive. The  entrance price should include the tour, that would be reasonable."
255,historical moment,So so beautiful! We were lucky enough to discover that we could stay at the inn at Middleton and with our stay we would be able to be on the grounds of Middleton after hours. It was a dream! We felt like we were visiting Versailles in Paris and it was our own private garden as we had the entire place to ourselves. Watching the sun rise and set overlooking the butterfly ponds and Ashley river was one of the best experiences of my life I think :). Middleton’s grounds are more manicured while Magnolia is more natural. Both are beautiful but the slavery presentation at Middleton was much better than at Magnolia. Loved our visit. Would like to return every year.
256,Wonderful Visit,Terrible experience at the grand illumination for dinner.it was a rain or shine event.  We were not notified that only the dinner would be served and the rest of the event was canceled. The food was very disappointing and the event is way overpriced if all you get is a crummy meal. Should make accommodations if it rains for a rain date or refund
257,Great Plantation,We went here and were appalled at how the place put a pretty shine on slavery The cooper telling us how many more barrels the slave made in a day compared to the English. I challenged him saying that you too would work as fast as possible if you had a whip at your back. He had no comment.Shame.
258,Gators!,"My wife and I stopped here on our way out of Charleston.  The highlight for us was the Middleton Oak.  This is a huge old live oak tree.  In addition to sculpted landscapes there are also some more rugged natural areas with swamp and Cyprus.  Keep an eye out for alligators.  We heard one, but didn't see any.  The staff is very friendly and there is lots to see.  Highly recommend."
259,Disappointed,"I’ve lost count on how many times we’ve been to Middleton place when visiting Charleston but it’s always well worth the time! We toured the gardens which are always kept in beautiful order and staff willing to answer questions. The highlight of our visit though was listening to a guide/interpreter speak about slavery. She was engaging, funny and really seemed to enjoy her role at the plantation..... she was very knowledgeable about the history of the area including interesting tidbits about the enslaved families that lived there. Tame and docile sheep are everywhere!The Gardens are peaceful and well worth coming to see!"
260,Beautiful Southern home and formal gardens on the Ashley River,"When we were planning our trip to Charleston, SC, my husband and I wanted to learn more about the intricacies of plantations and slavery. We did our research and learned that Middleton Place had these extremely manicured gardens, which attracted our attention. In addition to breathtaking gardens and views, we took the ""Beyond the Fields"" tour and learned about South Carolina's golden crop, rice, as well as how the Middleton family treated those who were enslaved on their land."
261,Nice day stop,"We went to Magnolia Plantation the day before and were going to skip this place. So glad we didn’t. Really cute parking lot under beautiful old trees good facilities and store. We followed the recommended long path. It didn’t take too long but a few areas were not marked as well but we figured it out. It was a hot day but many areas shaded. We took our time. Even had some lambs follow us a bit. They have an area where people show how they would have worked with wood working, blacksmith and weavers. Gardens were beautiful and manicured. Saw a few gators too. Lunch place was unexpected and we had pimento hush puppies and amazing salads. Very nice day out of the hustle and bustle. Good for families too. Not too crowded either which was a plus."
262,Educational Visit,"Our son and his beautiful bride were married at the gardens on Middleton Plantation this July. Since this was an important family event, contact with Roxanne, was made early, along with room locations and requests; who couldn't do stairs, who we needed close by, etc.  From the start, Roxanne could not have been sweeter or more accomodating.  She made it clear that her job was to make our stay perfect in any way she could. Juggling 34 rooms, grandmas, bridal party, and activities with numerous phone calls and emails from both myself and the bride on two different sides of the country was not an easy feat, but Roxanne handled it all with grace and professionalism.  I  checked in a day early so I could get goody bags ready for our wedding guests.  Upon arrival, I was greeted by Miss Quinn.  Room assignments, plantation tours, maps, directions, off premise shopping, even local nail salons and who to ask for were provided.  Quinn's smile, calm and friendly demeanor and knowledge of any request I had was reassuring after 17 hours in the car!  Quinn and  Roxanne even helped us get all the goody bags arranged for our guests...and came to our room with a flip flop that had fallen out of my car!  We were in good hands!  The rooms were beautiful, and the plantation was breath taking.  We toured the grounds a bit the first day and were impressed with the history and preservation of dwellings and  tools that made the plantation prosperous.  As we walked we saw horses feeding, sheep strolling along and peacocks sitting in a wall.  The century old plantings were something out of a story book. We went to dinner the first night at the restaurant, which was simple and gorgeous and set in the middle of lush greenery.  I was disappointed in our meals, but that was the only thing during our stay that was not positive.  The following day we walked to the lake house for complimentary  continental breakfast, which was wonderful...the blueberry scones were a favorite by most! You could also order off of a menu.  The wait staff were personable, attentive and funny; they  never got rattled as more and more guests arrived and the tables.   just kept expanding with family and friends.  The food was continually replenished, and the room was spotless.  Later, we visited the market and had lunch with family.  Simple and delicious.  The pool sits right on the Ashley river with kayaks available for rental.  Another beautiful setting.  Perfect for the kids and gatherings.  Some of the rooms were not ready for check in ( there were a lot of people in and out, and the rooms are quite large) so the pool came in handy, and we all shared our rooms.  Now the wedding....The ceremony was in ""The Gardens"" and it was something out of a movie.  It was simply magnificent!  Lush and green and breathtaking.  We were all taken back.  Our guests were seated and looked up at the ceremony which was performed on a small ""hill"" under an umbrella of trees.  Fairy tale setting!  The cocktail hour and photos were in and outside the restaurant...again, fairy tale setting...trees, lush vegetation, ponds, water falls...and delicious hors d'oeuvres.   Golf carts transported bridal, and any guests who wished, from location to location, and horse and buggies were available to us, as well.  The reception was fabulous!  The ceiling to floor windowed room was surrounded by fields and trees, and just beautiful.  The food, wait staff, wedding planner, attendants, and band were all amazing ( they even offered to go to our room for a new shirt for my husband who was drenched with 96 degree temp and as much humidity from the ceremony)  As you can see, I was thrilled beyond with almost every aspect of our experience with Middleton Plantation.  My son, his gorgeous bride and our families have memories to share for a lifetime.  Thank You Roxanne and Quinn for putting up with our craziness and making us all feel like family.  You're the best!"
263,"Beautiful, historic plantation",We wanted to see Middleton bc it had been recommended to us and we knew part of the movie The Patriot had been filmed there. Our kids enjoyed watching some period actors and the grounds were beautiful.  Watch out for gators.
264,So Expensive for So Little,"Advice: Bring your walking shoes and a good camera, and plan to stay for at least 2 hours if you want to get the full experience. This rice plantation is a one-of-a-kind. You can pay a little extra to see the museum, but you'll enjoy yourself plenty without the tour. The signage will assist with your history lesson. This is worth the money folks, although you can save about $3 per ticket if you purchase on-line. Time well spent, particularly during COVID!"
265,Wonderful plantation with lots to see,"This plantation has one house left - its small and is furnished for the period. It has many out building with animals, a blacksmith and has a nice explanation of what went on at the time it was active. Huge lunch buffet with traditional foods. A beautiful view of the river etc. nicely maintained as well."
266,Lovely but expensive ,"Went right for the cow milking and was the only person there...the cow obliged and it was fun. The area around the barn is really interesting with a cooper who was very informative along with a potter, some stable hands who hitched up water buffalo using voice commands, displays on rice, etc...we loved that area. The slave house had interesting displays and most all over were really well done and mercifully the hand outs at the Ticketing office showed right where to find them. Loved the whole place and spent a good 3 hours before enjoying a delicious lunch at the restaurant then had a talk by a lovely fellow about slavery that ended with him singing in the chapel...he was amazing as well."
267,Plan for a full day if you can!,"I am a fan of Gone with the Wind, yeah I know, This place is not really a plantation house. That was all destroyed. What you get to see is one building that was farm offices and guest house later converted for family use. Much is made of the family and their possessions. Unfortunately most are not labelled so unless the guide explains each of them you are just looking at old items of clothes, jewellery and knicknacks paid for with the illgotten gains of slave labor, a subject which is glossed over. Sure there is the ‘slave house’ but I am betting few slaves had double beds on legs and their own living room. You’ll have the word ‘livery’ explained to you and, by no means admit you know what an epergne is because you might be guilty of acting above your station.I got  the impression the guide drank the koolaid and believes the Middletons are somehow higher beings rather than simply farmers who made good from slavery."
268,Beautiful on a spring day,"We were fortunate to be South Carolina residents when they were running the 1/2 price admission fee in January.   Otherwise it would be too pricey for 3 adults and 3 children.  We parked and paid our admission.   It was 2 adults, one senior, and 3 children aged 2, 4, 6.   There is a lot of walking involved.  Not sure if there are any provisions for disabled (golf cart etc.)  You definitely should make this an entire day trip and pack a lunch.    There were temporary bathrooms at the parking area while some permanent ones are being constructed.  The other bathrooms are quite a walk away.  We walked over to the bathrooms at the restaurant.  We passed the sheep and saw the water buffalo pulling a cart.  We went to the area where the goats, carriage's, chickens and large hog are kept.  The water buffalo were very friendly and you can get close up and personal!  We chatted with the folks at the forge, and the pottery area.  The horses on site are gorgeous.  This was a great learning time and fun experience for all of us.  After we visited the stable area, we had a picnic at outdoor tables near the parking area.  We then started the journey through the beautifully manicured lawns and gardens.  So much stunning wildlife to see.  The huge oak trees, and beautiful camelias are breathtaking.  Afterwards we got coffee at the garden shop and purchased some plants to take home with us.   Would definitely go back again.  Only downside is it is not for someone who has trouble walking.  Children love it, and enjoy the animals and spacious grounds."
269,Beautiful formal gardens,"I went here as things were opening up from the pandemic, so the inside exhibits were closed, but there was still so much to see.  The grounds are absolutely stunning and the views of the water are breathtaking.  I could have stayed for hours just taking in the views.  My only recommendations are to take a bottle of water with you as they are allowed and be aware of the gator population.  I saw nine alligators through the grounds during my visit.  Will definitely visit again!!"
270,Completely beautiful,"This is more than your average plantation tour so if you have time when you are visiting Charleston, check it out.  We went on a weekday and the crowds were not bad.  We also did a tour of the house museum which made the experience more interesting."
271,Wonderful afternoon - Great value,"I don't mean to knock Magnolia Plantation, but we did Magnolia in the morning and then arrived at Middleton at around 1:30pm.  We wished that we had more time at Middleton for a guided tour (or two).  We thought the grounds and history were far more interesting and there is a lot more to see and do at Middleton.  If you can only go to one Plantation on your visit to Charleston, this would be my vote over Magnolia for sure!"
272,Absolutely fantastic,"My sisters and I arrived at 1pm and found we were too late to book a horse-drawn tour that day - bummer!  BUT we found we could walk and take our time to get a close look at all the wonderful plants, trees, waterways, animals, statues and historic buildings.  Weather was perfect and we stayed until almost dark (we were the last ones to leave).  We thoroughly enjoyed learning about this historical rice plantation and taking the quick house tour.  We wished we had arrived much earlier.  Definitely visit the expansive and beautiful property and don't forget to wear your walking shoes!"
273,So many things to see!,"My husband and I took our four teen/preteen children to the Middleton Place this spring. The entire experience was phenomenal (except the rain we experienced). My younger kids loved the animal tour where we saw (and got to pet a few of) the animals.  All of us were totally enthralled with the Beyond the Fields tour about slavery on the plantation. The tour guide did a superb job of sharing the facts without offering any of her opinions or political views. She had actual samples and evidence of slavery. She showed us very specifically how the plantation functioned for everyone living at the Middleton Place. We also did the garden tour. Being a gardener, I loved it. My kids thought the landscape design was very fun. We did spend a little time with the potter, but would have gone back there if we had more time. You could spend the entire day here. It was awesome."
274,Go -- the place is unforgettable,"We arrived at the property early enough to avoid the heat of the day, making it comfortable to explore the grounds and take in the natural beauty of the site. When we toured the home, we were pleased to see the historic furnishings, paintings, and family heirlooms that helped tell the family’s stories. Our guide was knowledgeable and charming, making the experience very interesting. We finished our visit with a trip to the gift shop where we found nice gift options. Nice visit!"
275,Beautiful peaceful setting,Went on a tour and the only thing negative I can say is that I wish it had been longer. Definitely could spend 2/3 of a day to a whole day here if you wanted!
276,Beautiful gardens,"Went in early April 2019.  Booked through pineapple tours who drove a group there and back (also recommended).  Incredible gardens, elegantly laid out.  Best I've seen in the USA.  It helps when the labor was free. The on-site restaurant has very good food.  We did the buffet. Yum.  Highly recommended!"
277,Beautiful,"Yes, this is rather pricey if you get the complete package, but we went that route so we could have a tour of the house and carriage ride. What truly made this a memorable experience was our carriage driver, Jamie. Besides being informative, he was humorous and had the 6 of us laughing. I have been on more tours than I can count, but never did I enjoy a tour as much as I did this one (not enough accolades for Jamie) and didn't want our time together to end. Usually I get bored partway through but not this time (can you tell I was impressed?). While walking near the water, be on the look out for alligators. I almost didn't see the first alligator when I was walking down to take a picture. After that I made sure to scan where I was walking, haha. We saw a total of 4 or 5 gators (not sure if the one simply moved or it was a different one). It was also neat to see Ibis and a Blue Heron (neither of which were phased by our presence) closer than I have in the past."
278,Spring Time,"Because it was raining, we allowed ourselves just an hour before taking the home tour. One of the docents (under her umbrella) gave us some suggestions and we had an enjoyable time even though it rained hard at times. The azaleas were starting bloom, but the camellias were still putting on a show and the live oak are spectacular. We visited the Cypress Lake to the butterfly lakes, the mill house and the stable yards. On a nice day we would have spent more time. Our tour guide for the house was excellent- interesting family history and beautiful things."
279,"Loads of fun ...Gardens, Docents, Cow Milking, Displays, Lecture...all GREAT",So lucky to find tour guide Greg Johnson while here. Greg used humor & great questions to engage our group in learning about the flora & fauna of this historic site.
280,Def returning,"Thought that the 5 1/2 hour tour would be too long, but we were busy the whole time.  Great lunch, house tour and history of the place was so interesting. Animals, and gardens, and demonstrations kept us very busy."
281,The most beautiful gardens in the USA,"We dod tje $55 pp spend the day tour...carriage ride was fun....Colonel was smart....then did the house museum tour which was awesome...then went to eat at the restaurant had the sampler lunch $22 pp which was excellent...southern meal....including drinks..sodas, tea, lemonade...then blacksmith ..pottery...other things to see which was cool.  the gardens were beautiful...weather was 100 degrees so uncomfortable ...after spending 6 hrs there we left...beautiful place...there is a tomb also.  Enjoyed our visit."
282,"Amazingly beautiful, a must-see","Of the 3 plantations near each other I was given the suggestions to go to Middleton for the fact that it had a plantation house rebuilt from original brick and with authentic furnishings, donated back to the property by Middleton family members. Take the house tour ! It’s only an hour but could easily be 3 with all the incredible pieces to see. The guide walks you through the ancestry of the plantation and gives it great historical context. Although the gardens were not in bloom when I went, the greenery is fantastic. Again take the garden tour. Even if you know nothing about horticulture...you will enjoy the story of how and why the gardens were built. Make sure to have lunch in the dining room tucked away near the house. It’s a quaint place and gives you a nice “dining in a plantation” feel. Better than a fast food option off property."
283,Beautiful house and gardens and history to boot!,"We arrived early in the day and chose the spend the day tour.  The full day ticket is a wee bit expensive but we did, literally, spend the day there.  We took a carriage ride through the grounds, took in the house tour, and wandered the rest of the grounds and gardens on our own.  The fact that we were greeted by lambs almost immediately upon arrival was immensely charming!  The guides were highly informative.  The house is quite beautiful but no photos are allowed so you must just go visit.  We had lunch at the restaurant, shrimp and grits, which I recommend."
284,Stunning Property with Amazing History ,"Give yourself plenty of time, at least 5-6 hours, if you plan to take the tours.  By the way the tours are very good.  We were lucky enough to have our tour of the gardens done by Greg.  You'll recognize him by his walking stick, ballcap and nice smile. He was a lot of fun and very informative. Every time you turn your head there's something beautiful to see and learn about."
285,A Full Day and Fun Time,A lot of work went into building this many years ago and a lot of work goes into it today to maintain it in such excellent condition.  Very educational.  Would love to see it in the spring when the flowers are blooming.
286,Good Sense of History: Beautiful grounds,"I guess I should have done a little more research, because I was very disappointed that we were touring one of the side buildings because the original mansion had been torched toward the end of the Civil War. It was small & there really wasn’t anything regal or exciting about the house itself. Some of the silver and furniture was beautiful and impressive and the grounds were very pretty, but this was NOT worth the price of admission."
287,Stunning property,"We spent 3.5 hours here. We didn’t do any of the extras, just paid the admission price. We ate at the restaurant, the buffet was outstanding. We walked all around the grounds, visited the craftsmen and saw the animals. It’s was a lovely afternoon."
288,The azaleas were in bloom!,"We had heard that Middleton was one of the first plantations to actually deal with the enslavement of Africans, who, of course, built this place.  Our walking tour was to be about plantation life, but while we saw some of the place we heard little about the conditions of the slaves, how many escaped, etc.  References to 'enslaved Africans' most of the time, but on the house tour the guide referred to 'servants'.  Clearly they are having a hard time admitting what really went on here.Additionally, it was somewhat incongruous to see a wedding going on on grounds built by slaves.  Add to that that all the 'historical characters' were white dressed in clothes that were much nicer than anything a slave would have....for example, they all had on shoes, well, it was somewhat disconcerting to see history avoided.  I would not go again."
289,Slice of authentic history,"We arrived early at Middleton Place shortly after it opened for the day, and we were the only ones on the path where the azaleas were blooming and it was incredible.  The gardens were beautiful.  We toured the home, Eliza's house, and took the carriage ride out to where the rice fields were located.  The guides were informative and thoroughly discussed the history of the enslaved who harvested the rice, worked the stables, cooked and maintained the mansions.  Several school groups were touring when we visited."
290,There is a depth of history that transcends the garden,"We were getting into Charleston too early to check into our hotel so made the wise decision to spend the morning at Middleton Place. The gardens are super and easy to navigate. We joined 3 tours led by very knowledgeable guides. Since we were having such a good time, we stayed through lunch. The buffet of local food was excellent and well presented. Even the gift shop and garden shop were delightful."
291,Perfect spring day,"My husband and I just spent two nights at The Middleton Place Inn. We had an excellent experience from start to finish. The employees were all very friendly, our room was unique and SO CLEAN, we had an AMAZING lunch at the restaurant and enjoyed walking around the grounds. I recommend visiting Middleton Place whether you are a local or a tourist."
292,"Lovely grounds, house is OK","We almost skipped Middleton Place for lack of time but held back for an extra morning...and are so glad we did.  Where Magnolia is a wild and free garden...a little messy in a gorgeous relaxed way...Middleton is more cultivated and more perfectly maintained in the way some formal gardens are.  But its big and the animals have room to walk and roam and run...and do their farm jobs.This Plantation is all about the gardens, the animals they have, their uses even today and the history of the people that lived in the big house AND the slaves who worked on it are all presented nicely, fairly with credit given to everyone.  There are craft cabins near the stables where you will see iron being shaped into hinges and hooks and all kinds of things they used on the farm and garden and gates around the area.You will see free running herds of sheep, Water Buffalo pulling carts, Draft horses pulling big wagons and other farm yard animals that you can approach and even pet.  You will see their stables, walk through them...even see angora goats, all kinds of chickens.  It does not feel like a confining zoo, the animals are more free and friendly.With one exception...the alligators in the ponds behind the big house and below the cafe.  Today they were sunning on the lawn and people walking within 20 feet of them...taking photos but also knowing to not approach further.  And never walk to swamp ponds thinking there will be no alligators....just don’t do it.Now for the gardens, they are more formal with curved lines around the ponds, occasional fountains with swans.  The back manicured terraces and the 2 butterfly wing shaped ponds are so beautiful.  Those are what you see in most of the advertising brochures.  You must walk back behind and below the big house and cafe or you will miss it.   This is a slow walking garden with pathways to follow for surprisingly long distances.  Its a photographers dream...an animal lovers dream and a history lovers dream.  And its fabulous that they are maintaining it in a National Heritage Foundation to preserve its gardens and its animals and history for future generations to see.  So that it will not go to ruin like so many other southern plantations have done.For us off-season was great...fewer crowds, easy parking and a more open area to meander.  There were even a few brave camellias beginning to show their faces, some occasional azalea varieties and the vestiges of fall colors in the trees....and it was nice and cool and NOT hot and humid.  I guess there are some trade offs...but off-season is great too, and highly recommended."
293,Wonderful enriching surprise,"We showed up around 10am and my 2 and 4 year old wanted to do a carriage ride. However, the first ""public"" ride is 12:15pm which a little suprising. So we signed up for the ride. The good thing is both children were free for admission which is nice. The self guided tour is great. We did the full 30+ stops in 2 hours. We really liked exploring and seeing all the animals. The one year old cow even gave my daughter a kiss. We went back around to get on carriage ride at 12:15. It is 45 minutes long and has some interesting facts but it basically does a half circle and if you already did the walk, you see nothing new. So that was pretty disappointing and I was hoping the person who was selling the tickets would have told us. So unless it is your first stop, don't do the carriage ride!! I liked everything else about the place.  The gift shop needs some newer items. It has a lot of older memorabilia in there. Oh and watch out for the alligators sunning themselves!"
294,Couples travel,"My husband and I arrived at Middleton Place around 2 PM on a Sunday. Our house tour begin promptly at 2:30 PM, with very appropriate social distancing. We then wandered through the stable yard and the gardens. We were there for about two hours and 45 minutes and were quite content with what we were able to see. The staff was attentive and we had a great time."
295,A must see in South Carolina,"We had a very mixed experience at Middleton.  The highlight - a must see - is a one woman performance outside called “Momma Hattie Remembers” being offered during Black History Month.  The actress, an African American woman playing a slave, was wonderful and gave a powerful performance, and the experience was both moving and educational.  The tour of the house was given by a very knowledgeable guide, and there were a number of historic items to be seen.  The grounds were beautiful.  But...We took a garden tour - part of the entrance package - given by an older white man wearing a hat that said “chaplain.”   He is a volunteer.  He was a chaplain during the Viet Nam war.  He told us that the Civil War was not civil and should not be called that.  About the “Articles of the Confederacy” ( aka Articles of Secession).  And he told us of clocks, sundials and other non-garden tour information for fifteen minutes before we even started walking the gardens.  After a little bit of walking, we wound up under a tree and he began to explain two types of plants.  One was the “Resurrection Fern.”  And that’s where this garden tour took a turn one might not anticipate.  Our tour guide began to discuss the Resurrection.  And Christ.  And sins.  And more.  I walked away to take pictures.  He then commented to the others on the tour, or me, something like “I seem to have lost your interest.”  I said, “I’m Jewish, so this part of the garden tour is not for me.”  He then apologized and asked if he’d gone too far.  The others on the tour said he had.  He asked where he should have stopped.  They said with the gardens (which we did not hear enough about.) He then apologized to me, noting he had ministered to some Jewish people during the Viet Nam war and even knew some of our words.  He then hurriedly walked us around some of the gardens and did discuss them during our remaining time.  Two of our group of six left after his questions to the group.  I did ultimately tell some employees afterwards.  We then took the Eliza’s house tour, given by another older white man.  As we stood inside the structure, he talked of the number of slaves and where they had come from, but mentioned nothing in the house of the brutality they endured.  He spoke of the Middletons summering in Rhode Island, their wealth, and several other non-slavery related matters.  I asked if the house we were in had been a slave residence.  He said it was for returning former slaves, and that slave quarters were worse, but he did not describe them, though he did return to the topic of the tour.  We then walked outside, and he did not point out the other half of the house that had a replication of living quarters for former slaves.  Nor did he point out that there was an informational brochure available similar to the one each of us was handed on the house tour.  We walked some more and he drew a distinction between slaves on cotton plantations and those on this one, a rice plantation.  And although he whitewashed (yes, I mean that) the reality of slavery, I bit my tongue until he described how these slaves were better off because they had a carrot - if they got their work done early they could get out early, and hunt or fish or spend time with family.  I then asked if they did not get it done would they be beaten?  And he said yes, that might happen.  I responded, “ So it wasn’t exactly paradise.”  It was only at that point he began talking about families being torn apart, slaves being beaten and other realities.Both men seemed to want to avoid or neutralize any discussion about the reality of slavery.  That was wrong, and the foundation that supports the educational programs must make some major changes and vet its toyrs and tour guides."
296,Good choice,"We arrived on a semi-rainy day and kept hoping it would hold out for us. It ended up not mattering simply because of how amazing the entire property is! A truly beautiful place to go back into time. We bought tickets for the carriage ride and house tour. We were able to walk the gardens a bit before the tour--wow! The tour was informative and the perfect length. The house tour was incredible. Our hostess was fun and so knowledgable--we really enjoyed this. Next, we stopped at the restaurant for a late lunch. The buffet was delicious and just what we needed after a morning packed with site-seeing. Afterwards, we wandered around the stables and trails. Just such an amazing place. We could have spent a few more hours there--it was so beautiful and peaceful. We lucked out with the rain only dumping on us once, but we're from Oregon and are used to some rain ;) Come prepared to walk quite a bit, but each step is 100% worth it. Would love to return again someday."
297,Springtime Visit,This was our second time to Middleton Place. This time we had 2 grandkids with us (ages 8 and 5). The house tour is wonderful and walking the grounds and seeing the animals was fun for the kids. We seem to always be there in June when the flowers aren't really blooming yet. I bet the formal gardens are beautiful in later summer. A must see if you are in the area!
298,"Loved the gardens, the animals, and the wagon ride, but...","We visited during an unusual time. The world all but shut down due to the Corona Virus. Our goal was to stay outside and take in the beauty of the south. This was the perfect spot to accomplish that goal. We had several plantations to choose from and we asked many people for suggestions and then we found that Middleton Place was offering a dramatic monologue by ""Mama Hattie."" Let me just say that Mama Hattie brought me to tears. She was amazing and I will count her performance as a highlight of our visit to Charleston. As for the plantation - there was a photo opp around every corner. Absolutely beautiful - reminded me of the grand gardens in England."
299,Beautiful! So glad we didn't skip MIddleton Place!,"After a rough, frustrating day we were just about done, but decided on one more mini-adventure:  When we got to the Middleton Place our attitude hadn’t improved but nevertheless we decided to try our luck.  Wow!  Great decision!  We finally had a good experience: it was late in the day and there was no one in the ticket booth, but the gates were open so we walked right in!  The grounds were immaculately trimmed, the flower gardens were just beautiful, and there were several ponds on the property (we saw two alligators at one of the ponds, and a blue heron at another!).  We also walked thru the stable yard, looked into the barns, and said hello to the horses, goats, & sheep.  Finally we walked thru the slave quarters: a kitchen, bedroom, living area, and outhouse.  A bagpiper played something to let everyone know that the plantation was closing for the day, so we made our way out.  Really a rewarding visit and we vowed to return."
