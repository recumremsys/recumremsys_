0,Great day out,Very good zoo. A great day out for all my family. There is parking outside the zoo but was quite full when we were there. The animal enclosures were very clean and the animals looked very healthy.
1,The best way to spend your day in NN,"We visited the Zoo one time, was too cold but nice. There are a lot of friendly animals.You can buy some food there and feed the animals."
2,Busy and popular attraction,"A great place for a family visit! The zoo itself is remarkable both for the variety of animals and for the way it is run. Everything is arranged very thoughtfully for the convenience of the visitors (warning notices in place, snacks for animals on sale, benches to take a seat on, even a 'bad habit zone' for smokers!). Children are sure to love the 'contact area' where they can feed and touch sheep and llamas. But there is more to the place than just zoo! There is an attractions park, a choice of snack bars and caf√©s, and even a display of Soviet-era cars and bikes in the open."
3,no room for disappointment,"I live in NN and I love this zoo so much. First of all, there are a lot of different animals. Animals are really friendly and funny. You can buy some food and feed them here. P.S. But be careful with goats. They really like eating, so they can run after you to get some food."
4,A lot of friendly animals.,"I think that a think that make the zoo worth visiting - you can contact with all piecfull animals. The zoo isn't very big, but it is special, because of close contact with animals"
5,The first private zoo within Russia... and maybe the best one.,Nice Zoo. A good variety of animals.  The animals were all healthy and well cared for. The cages were clean. Lots of visitors and children.
6,Alive zoo,A really nice zoo in Nizhny Novgorod. The zoo is split in two parts. You can either buy both tickets or choose just one of the parts. Between the zoo's are a few restaurants and attractions.The cages are big and it seems as the animals are all healthy and happy.
7,There is much more to it than a zoo,"After having been at the Moscow Zoo the week before (half of it being remodeled and closed), I was really impressed by the zoo in Nizhny Novgorod.  There is a wide variety of animals - everything from kangaroos to tigers.  The grounds, cages, etc. were all clean and everything seemed well cared for.  It is a wonderful place to go spend a few hours as a family."
8,bigger and better than expected,"Whenever I visit a zoo in Russia, I get distressed. But not here. This is a really good place where animals are loved and taken care of."
9,Really Enjoyed This Zoo,If you are looking for large exotic creatures then this is not the place for you. If you want to see a wide variety of creatures and have the chance to feed some then this is the place for you. It is obvious they are trying to improve the enclosures-especially in the second part of the zoo but most creatures only have the feel of concrete or sand under their feet. The zoo offers a wide range of activities for the young or young at heart in the funfair section. The zoo gets very busy and is highly popular with children.
10,Nice,"Although I'm not huge fan of zoos, Imust admit this one is much less depressing than any others I have been in Russia."
