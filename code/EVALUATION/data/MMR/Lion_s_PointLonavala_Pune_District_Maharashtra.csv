40,Main attraction of Lonavala,The view is amazing and we spent some time at this place which has sufficient car parking. The are couple of food stall and staff keep pursuing you for snacks / tea and beverage. They have also put up chairs and table just aside the boundary of mountain which is dangerous.Visitors kept going ahead towards the edge which was scary despite many incidents of tourist falling and losing their life While the place is good to visit but with caution.Cheers
41,"An amazing place, poorly maintained spoils the whole charm.","This place is wonderful for taking pics and enjoying with the spouse. There are a lot of thela valas who come to you from the moment you stop, and they are very costly too. A pure half lemon and water would cost you 50 bucks. you can have a lot of peace by just sitting there and enjoying the breeze."

45,Exploration trek,It is the most adventurous place in Lonavala and the high tourist attraction.. anyone who visits Lonavla goes to this place as it is very renowned so it is at a very good height and if you look down the view is really very dangerous but I really enjoyed a lot a lot of cars that come in and play music the best thing that you could do is eat cheese pakoda and hot tea
46,Nice view of  valley,The magic of nature! After rainy days the whole scene is transferred to a  awesome green valley. Spend some time and you will fill clouds passing and you can feel the  changing the atmosphere. Best in rainy season.

51,Beautiful in Summer too,"Offers a stunning view of the plateau below. Ample parking. Expect a huge crowd with loads of stalls, camel rides, selfie people...but once you tune them out you can just enjoy a very relaxing breathtaking view of the countryside."
52,Most awesome place,One can view the lion shaped plateaus which resemble that lion is watching you and the greenery takes you to the nature's depth and also the curvy route nice. One must enjoy the Hot 🌽 corn bhajji's on the top.

55,good sunset point,"This is the highest point in Lonavala and view from here is superb, a must visit point in Lonavala especially during monsoon"
56,Not safe for families. ,"Lion's point is the Highest point in Lonavala and you can enjoy the beautiful view of Waterfalls and hills from this Point. you can either hire a taxi from your hotel or drive your own car to reach here. Auto is a Bad Idea as it cannot go up the Slopes.Also, Weather here is very unpredictable so always carry umbrella or raincoats. There are few local eating shops here, serving maggie, pakora's etc. Beware of Monkeys though as there are many.I think it has a paid parking, which is not much, but if you take Taxi, the parking fee is taken care by driver."
57,Sun set point,Best in rainy season for couples. Find a cab or auto to reach this place. Fun if you go in groups like friends and family.
58,Excellent Mountain view,Wonderful view of natural mountain formations.The area needs to be cleaned up a lot and tourism needs to be regulated. The set up seemed to be very primitive with plastic snd other waste creating a dore eye all through
59,NOT VERY IMPRESSED,It's a nice place at the top of the hill and giving very good aerial view of the area with complete natural surroundings
60,Love the Cheese bhajjis,"best place to go  i recommend this place strongly. The place is large, clean.unforgettable experience"
61,Closes at Sunset,"We have visited the Lions and Tiger point are nearby places ,both points have nature beauty..top of the hill...but you can enjoy more in monsoon season.If you like nature beauty of mountains then must visit.It required 1-2 hours for place to visit."
62,Point with nice views,Best place and lovely view from near and far away. A must place to visit and take awesome view. Lovely view.
63,Good view point,"This place is now like a hub during the monsoons. It is definitely a must visit if you're in or near Lonavla, especially during the monsoons. Its foggy, breezy and pleasant. It is ahead of Bushi dam. Pay and parking available at a couple of places. Things to eat here: Corn bhaji, Maggi, Chai, Kanda Bhaji.*Beware of the monkeys*"
64,Lion's Point,One of the best places to visit during monsoon time. I love to have hot chai ☕️ and enjoy my motorcycle ride to this place. While location is scenic sometime extra crowd spoils the essence of the location ..
65,Beautiful views,"Very nice place. Awesome climate. Beware of monkeys. Good view. For vehicle parking, they are charging 50rs.Visitors should maintain this place, as noticed most of them are throwing covers, food, and waste there itself. Soon this place will spoil if people will not maintain hygiene."
66,Very poor amenities,One of the highest point in the area. A god view of the surrounding mountains & valley. A must visit point in Lonavala.
67,Lovely views,"Excellent view point of lonavala hill station and surrounding hills. Good spot for photos. Would spend about 30 mins here. Be sure to go up-hill to the 2nd viewing area, it’s less busy there."
68,Stop for the view,"The view is beautiful in summer & rainy season, that's the only good thing about it. Better if you visit this place after 4pm. It's accessible through road, no entry fee except parking fee which is not even organized. People park anywhere they please. Constant pestering by retailers & no cleanliness. It's better if you avoid to eat or drink from any stall as very unhygienic."
69,Nice place to visit in Lonavla,They now charge money for parking etc. but the view in itself is beautiful. Highly recommended! Camel rides also available.
70,Lions point,One must visit this place all the time clouds surrounding this place excellent view u can enjoy with Maggi & pakora
71,nice beauty of nature,Nice scenic hilly views all around. But you need to visit after rains to see more lush greenery. Also too many stalls and vendors makes it noisy and resulting in trash
72,Amazing place to visit but in monsoon,"Visiting Lion’s Point on the outskirts of Lonavala is a must for any tourist, when visiting Lonavala. It is within a short driving distance from Lonavala. Parking could be challenging. The natural scenery all around is flabbergasting and one can get some awesome views of the changing sky colors just before sunset. The best thing is that it is free."
73,A marvellous view point,A serene and a beautiful spot around 1800 feet above sea level. We missed the clear view as it was raining and covered with clouds. Yet there are some good points.Fantastic hot bhajias prepared on the spot by locals served with Hot tea. Also on offer are maggi and other eatables. Supporting locals is necessary but so is negotiating.Tips - 1. Ask your driver to first take you to Lions Point and then Bush’s dam as you may catch cold after getting wet. Weather can b cold here.2. They charge for parking so negotiate with your tours to include it.
74,Adventurous place,If you go to lonavala you must visit lions point. Best time to visit this place is winter. Lions point is one of the hill station. You can visit this place in early morning or in evening or late night. I went to this place late night and I was there till morning.
75,Beautiful,"When one need a really good place for a decent drive from Mumbai or Pune. This will be a good location. Relaxing, Cold winds blowing. A screensaver pic which can be captured at sunset point. One really needs to go to catch a nice weekend"
76,NICE VIEW POINT,The views at night is amazing lovely place to visit but the snacks that we get it too expensive. but  your can enjoy food and your drinks over there
77,It is okay ,View is good but local people had made it more like business asking money even in non season.. for parking and all
78,NICE PLACE FOR FOR HALF DAY,It is situated in Sahyadri mountains (western). Nice View but may not impress people who have visited North - East hill stations. No proper restaurant here. Everywhere we observed the broken bear bottles . Management is not good. Local People were selling Items at double price.
79,Nice place and good scenic view,What a view !! I visited on a weekday so it was very peaceful and amazing. You can sit for hours and enjoy wind and nature.
80,Quick Relaxation from the hectic schedule....,One of the best places...  Not to be missed No 1 destination of lonavala.  There is a camel ride for all.  Dont miss on the corn pakodas ....
81,Awesome place,Tiger point and lion point both place most awesome place for visit.. mostly visit this place at 5-6 pm nice to enjoy
82,Beautiful views ,"As the place entirely covered with the western ghats gives a mesmerizing view of mountains, clouds and a feeling of being in the lap of nature.Being a famous spot in Lonavala lot's of people visitors of different age groups visit the place especially on weekends and during rains.At this spot itself lot's of small restuarants are available to satisfy one's belly.But one visiting such place should be more careful enough to click pictures and avoid dangerous poses near the corner.Govt being aware that it's being famous tourist spot should take for more safety factors like proper maintenance of railings to cover/mitigate all possible risky corners and areas."
83,View is awesome ,"very good location, for photography lover it's nice place as the view of the welly & a lake  is look very clear from the top of the hill,  we had some good food & a tea also in the pleasant weather."

85,View,"Except during rains, It is a horrible place to visit. No good amenities.Crowded. No good eating placesView may be good in rains"
86,Good to visit,"If you are looking for 5 place to Visit in Lonavala than Lion's point is definitely one of them.Great AtmosphereGreat views, can spend hours over thereVisited place in September 2018, greenery all around. Not sure about summer but recommend to visit in Monsoon (as first preference).Should also recommend to carry umbrella if you are visiting in summer as sun is definitely going to sweat you out. Parking charges varies as per season."
87,Pleasant Point to relax in winter,This is a lovely view point in Lonavala.The views of the valley below on a clear day are fantastic. Greenery during monsoon time would add to the charm
88,Do visit ,In case you are interested in beautiful view of hills and nature then you must visit this place. Almost 15 min drive from Lonavala through hill and good roads you reach this place. though not maintained and crowded during holidays and weekends specially during rainy season. Very high winds and place is slippery during rains. In case you love nature then you will fall in love with this place. Good for photography lovers. Ample parking available but you need to pay for it. No washroom facility available. This place has lot of street food temporary structure but not maintained. You may have Maggie and Corn pakodas.

96,Its good view point on top of hill on a clear day,"Lion’s Point is a prominent vacationer attraction in Lonavala and offers extremely good views of the valley. If you appearance intently, you can see an impact of a tiger trying to leap throughout the valley, that is why the vantage point has earned its name. The echo produced by way of rocks falling into the crevasse is some other spotlight of this point. During monsoon, a small natural waterfall is fashioned close to date. If you're a nature lover, you are surely in for a deal with."

112,Nice view of nature,"like most touristy places in maharashtra, this place suffers from rubbish thrown around, hawkers, entertainers(apparently) and beggars... its not the peaceful point it was 10 years ago...go for nostalgia, or for the view , but mind the deterioration in the environs at this place."

119,Beautiful view....,I visited this place in September. I really enjoyed the visit and as per my experience this is one of the best place near mumbai.
120,Excellent place with a view,"Most popular attraction in Lonavla, Maharashtra. gives a clear and scenic view of Sahyadris on a clear day. A must visit during monsoons wherein it is covered in clouds with light drizzle. Remains windy all throughout the year. Enjoy Indian snacks/delicacies right there from the local vendors - they are equally worthy. Nearby spots include Amby Valley. Occasionally there are arrangements for paragliding arranged from a nearby airstrip - haven't seen it though in recent past. Do take some spare time as at times the approach road from Lonavla city to Lion's point gets choked at few spots particularly in holidays and weekends. Overall - a must visit."
121,Good Experience,The view was OK. You can spend sometime there feeling the soothing wind. Can be recommended to only those who haven't visited any major hill station.
122,Most Best place to visit in winter,"The view from Lions Point is breath taking specially in the monsoon season with greenery all around and waterfalls that add to the beauty of the location. The place has basic eatery stalls with Maggi, tea and pakodas for a good evening or morning snack."

125,Good views,The point gives you stunning view of the entire hills plateus and deep valley. The breeze is nice and makes you relaxed from all pains and tensions. Get an idea of the climate before planning the trip because during sunny days it may not be recommended to visit ..
126,Very nice preferably before 9 AM,"A ritual to come at this point whenever you are in Lonavala. It's a great place to be to enjoy the view. Be aware of monkeys if you are carrying eatables things, they mighty just snatch it. Washroom facility should be there so, that people don't loiter around. This is famous point where most of the people visit hence, should be taken care by responsibile authorities. Best place to visit is Rainy season to enjoy the fog but avoid weekends during rainy season."
127,Terrific Tiger Point,Lion’s point is a very famous place of lonavala. Famous for looking at the nature and sunsets as well. Must visit place in lonavala as you dont get much options here
128,Lions point,"The Lion's point is one of the few points in Lonavala which are famous for viewing sunset. And really the view is breathtaking. Couple it with the hot tea/pakoras/maggi that you can get here, the experience is amazing. Ample place to sit and park ur vehicles. However, be careful not to stay too long in night as the place may get deserted."
129,"Long drive, Fog and Maggie","Very crowds even during rains r... reach early .misty clouds make for a perfect backdrop for some friendly, romantic or family pics . Be careful of your excursions and your steps . Chai pakoras and Maggi are a must . Guys please keep the area clean ... please please do not litter ."
130,Amazing view but poor maintenance,"The place was recommended for a scenic view and tapri snacks like tea ,pakoras & maggi . The view is nice but I am sure its much better during / after monsoons . The place around the peak is super dirty and was not at all manage . This could be a really nice picnic spot if kept well. Looked like more of a show off for bike lovers who just drive their super bikes ."
131,Beware from Monkey at Monkey point,The place is far more better then expected nd it is worth to visit the place......The staff present here is also very helpful nd trustworthy...one of the best activity i liked was net cricket so i jus want to say that the ones working for that activity are very worthy nd i feel they should b raised.....nd one of the person's name was suresh bhai.....Felt happy to visit the place 💯
132,Awesome,"This is a good spot to see the waterfalls from the few streams which convert to seasonal waterfalls in monsoon.The view is awesome in monsoon. Please do not expect the same view in other months.There is greenery all around, the climate is cool and, also, expect some fog. You might have to wait for the fog to clear to see the majestic drops and waterfalls.Walk along the railings to see the valleys from different angles. Once you are done walking , settle down in one place and enjoy the pakoras and hot tea.There are camels here, so, one can enjoy a camel ride, too."
133,Amazing view,"Good natural seen and wonderful environment. One of the best place in Lonavala.You can spend half day over here,bit take care while taking selfie.Air strike could be dangerous , if you have not taken support of railing.Plastic chairs are available.So, you can seat for hours in wonderful atmosphere ."
134,This Place gets Alive in Night,"Visited the lions point and tiger point , all on the same road. Couldn't really understand why they are named so. You good good view of the valley down, probably could provide better exciting sunset views. One difference compared to other view points is that, you have a wide open area to walk around and relax (if you can ignore the littering around)."
135,Nice place but visit with no fog,"The peak has now commercially developed with parking facilities, food counters from localities, safety grills near the valley and fun activities. Few years back this place use to be peaceful site with very few people visiting the place. In case you are a solo traveler looking for some quality time with nature, I would not recommend this place. However, this place can be considered for someone who is travelling with family of kids and aged parents to spend some quality time."
136,View from the clouds,"I didn't understand why it is called lions point though people tried to show me a peak which depicts a lion sleeping etc., Route to this place pretty scary with u-pin turns.Do not try food at this place it might disturb your tummy."
137,Lion's Point In Lonavala,You should go between June to July. Though we have seen some falls in September also. Very nice view specially at evening.
138,Must visit,Good viewing point from peak. Also good entertainment for children as horse ride etc were offered. Fast Indian foods also were on the stalls. A decent experience by and large. Recommended.
139,Must Visit If In Lonavla,"Place is very calm peaceful and beautiful, elegant view from this point. few stalls on the way to enjoy tea and snacks like bhel, maggi, corn."
140,Skyline,"Very touristy and crowded.In the monsoons the path is full of fog, so all the vehicles were driving at a super slow speed due to the roads being extremely narrow.On reaching, we waited a bit for the fog to clear up to get better views of the valley below.Had hot tea and corn bhajjis while passing the time.Definitely one of the things to do there, but do expect lots of people."
141,Amazing,"Visited this point along with family, this point is famous for sun set. you can relax here and view the sun as it sets. Enjoy the tea and snacks along."
142,Visit to the place which I underestimated,Had been there for Exploration trek with friends .. incredible view of Moradi pinnacle from base and fantastic trek
143,Out of the world experience,This place is on the way to Lonavala from Amby valley.The view is superb with mist . One feels like you are in haven .
144,High feeling at Lion's Point,Beautiful valley on the way to Amby valley.The valley is full of clouds. You can see amazing water falls. The pinnacle plays bide ahd seek in the clouds.Must vist place.
145,Monsoon misty clouds ... charming ,Excellent scenic beautiful view point. Nice view from top of the mountains. Excellent weather and we have tea and snacks there. We have chairs to sit and relax. Very nice place.
146,Breath taking view!!,"This point is about half hour drive up from Kumar Resort. It has an amazing Sunset view! Also, I love the Cheese Bhajjis over here. Kanda Bhajji, Corn Bhajji, Cheese Maggi, Tea, Coffee are also good."
147,Good place,"Visited during my stay in lonavala,having few tin sheds,and valley view from height.The barrication is broken at multiple places,be alert if visiting with kids."
148,Best pace in Lonavala ,Place to hangout with your friends and family. You can take good landscape shots. Nice flow of breeze. One can sit there alone or with your friends for some quality time..Cleanliness is an essential there.You can find a lot of street food options. Not that great but fine.
149,It's a really good place,It was a good view at lions point. I visited in Dec. As I heard Lonavala visit is worthfull during rainy season only when u will find great view from Lions point. Ride with a bike at Lions point
150,"Beautiful Hills, Badly Maintained, Locals threatening and Looting General Public",The point gives great views of the Western Ghata of Lonavala.. Its green all around.. There is place for Car Parking..(paid parking).. Small shops sell Noodles and Pakora.. You may enjoy camel ride.. Good selfie point..
151,Good sight seeing,"Wonderful view point in Lonavala.  Need to climb up the small hill. Cabs can reach near view point. The views of the valley below on a clear day are fantastic. Excellent panoramic view of mountains around. Good place for photographs and selfies.We visited during mid day, hot sun hitting us like anything. Best time is during sun set and monsoon season. In rainy season you can see the waterfalls from the mountains."
152,Cloud 9 experience,This is worth your time to look over the edge and see miles and miles of green India (during monsoon).
153,Amazing view,Many friends told us to visit Lonavala but we went in February and most of the sightseeing was dried and empty.Our car driver said it’s best to come here In Rainy season when there are loads of waterfalls and more greenery.
154,Just wow experience,"Its a beautiful place located on hill top near lonavla. Provides a very beautiful view of the valley if you can see it, because its densely emerged in fog. Makes you feel like walking in clouds. Best time to visit is during monsoons(Jun-Aug) and also is good during winters.Try not to bother about rains and keep your raincoats/umbrella (Raincoats hardly are of use and umbrella's get blown by winds)aside and set yourself lose to enjoy the moment.There are also many shops providing hot bhajiyas,maggi, tea/coffe etc. costing over priced but worth eating in that amazing climate."
155,Must to visit place while visiting Lonavala,This is a very beautiful place.It was all covered in fog in September .You can take photographs and enjoy corn and onion pakodas.
156,View is good but its not worth the filth,"Very good weather in almost all season, you can not get any activity to do. Its just open space but many meter above the sea level. One can see fog, clouds just at your eye level and even sometimes below your eyes. there are railing for safety too... tea stalls are there and you can get some wafers in small shops. Surrounding series of mountains are making great view. Autorikshaw may charge you a lot to go there from railway station but its good to share fare with another people if you are two only..."
157,awesome view from the point,"Nice scenic view in rainy season, facility for parking, arrangement for snacks in tapri or shacks. They serve Kanda bhaji to vada pav to tea. Few people find this place appropriate for social drinking in their cars. But don't stop your self from visiting because of this"
158,Awesome view,"Most of us know it's really beautiful during monsoon , so I wanted to try during summer . Took an auto from the station , which cost us 400 with dropping back to station and one hour wait but yeah , it's worth it . The place is really beautiful , amazing cool breeze. Less tourist during summer , you can have a good time with family , less greenery"
159,Nice point,A beautiful spot atop the chota Nagpur plateau. We visited late in the afternoon and watched the sunset which was indeed mesmerising. Also there were so many fighter jets flying in different directions in the sky and the combined view was something you can’t forget. There are some street vendors selling tea and pakoras which are really expensive. In a nutshell it is a place worth visiting.
160,Scenic spot,"Lion's point is the highest point of lonavala, the scenery is very beautiful from there, whole mountains are visible, you will fell above clouds, I like the place alot.As you reach there local vendors run behind you bike or car to park at their place so they can charge hefty fee, after that if you want a tea, coffee, maggy anything they will tell you the rate of gold, it's hard to under stand why so much high rates.I think no body is cleaning the place, because it's too dirty, no police is there, no proper fencing. government need to take a look."
161,Where Eagles Don't Dare,Beautiful views. Lots of food available. Shops selling variety of earthenware artifacts. Toll charges for out of town vehicles
162,"Good for those who loves to spend time in open air, good weather, view fog",It's near Lonavala between Bushi Dam & Ambey Valley which offers some beautiful photo ops. You can see waterfalls and greenary here.
163,Sight Seeing,"One of the famous place to visit in Lonavala. A perfect weekend gateway with mininum travelling from Pune and Mumbai. Situated on the hills of lonavala, road is poorly maintained, considering the sharp turns it needs to be improvised. A rocky surfaced land, which gives breath taking view of nature, beautiful to visit in the evening, having a cup of tea or coffee and enjoying the sunset. There are many food stalls offering the local delicacies, what i loved the most is the CHEESE PAKODA . Amazing taste of melted cheese with indian spices and deep fried. They even offer hukka on public demand.Overall a good place to visit with friends and family."
164,Beautiful view,"This place is awesome with very awesome views. It is at very high altitude with roads like ghats for 2-3 kms. There are many stalls for food and drinks like Cheese maggi, etc."
165,Awesome Experience,"A short visit to Lions point in lonavala.Though the weather was sunny, but the scenic view was very refreshing n chilling.Must visit in monsoon."
166,Great view,Good view but barricades and railing are broken in many places. One should not get carried away in clicking selfie
167,Breathtaking view,"Well it's what it is! A typical hill station valley view/ sunset point that you come across any hill station you may visit in India. Yes the valley view is great, yes the view of Lonavala town can appear cool but same problems: no parking after sunset (about 6 pm), monkey menace (monkeys literally snatching stuff from your hand), hounding by agents of tea stalls for Maggi, bhakti, bhaji or tea, cows roaming around and no safety grill at the end of the hill. You may want to visit in the evening (not too late) but take precautions with kids and elderly parents. If you are really hungry then there are ample stalls offering tea, Maggi, bhajia etc."
168,its ok,"Ever since I moved to Mumbai, this place has become my favorite haunt in monsoons. A long drive passing through mini waterfalls on the way of Mumbai-Pune highway to this place i.e. Around 1800 feet above the sea level, covered with fog, cloud and breeze just makes this experience breathtaking.. To add to this experience, locals serve hot bhajiya, corn, maggie and beverages.."
169,"Nothing specific ,poorly managed place.",Its really good for a short drive from Pune. Its also good for a quick relaxation and stress buster from the hectic schedule...
170,Site seeing trip from Mumbai,"The view is what you'd go for. You spend a little while and head back. It is best viewed in the wee hours of the morning. During monsoons visibility might be an issue. Also, watch out for innumerable mistakes on google maps when searching for this spot. You can be misguided. best ask the locals"
171,Ok,Pleasant atmosphere can be enjoyed on this point with hot snacks and hookah(not recommended) as well. Adventurous roads for bikers' gangs.
172,Great views of Lonavala,if you are going to Lonawala this is best point to visit in my visint Aug 2018 Monsoon it was fabulous too much fog and cloudy very clean air
173,Typical overhyped sunset point!,"Poor infrastructure- good view - can get soft drinks and wafers packets - no ticket charges- in clear weather , can have great view"
174,Beautiful place,Lonavala’s best and superb sightseen point awesome view of lonavala and valleys full greens and clean valley
175,Great place but ruined by visitors & shopkeepers,"We went there with a private driver after visiting the Karla caves. The view is really amazing and we were very happy to see around 20 monkeys parading in front of us, so it was a nice experience!"
176,Relaxing,Attractive sight seeing. On the top of the Hill. Almost 10-12 km away from Lonavala Station and on the road of Amby Valley. Camel ride is famous here.
177,Relaxing place to spend evening,The lions point offers a great view of the mountain ranges. There are camel rides and dirt bike rides for the interested people
178,Lovely point,A good place to spend d evening when in Lonavala. Camel n horse rides available. Snacks tea coffee are also there
179,Great view,"Followed by a nice & smooth ride thru Expressway from Mumbai or Pune & then a ride thru hills to Lion's Point.Spend a night watching stars or enjoying music & at twilight, have a look at calm & orange sun.Its a Happening place on weekend evenings, with most of the crowd of TECHIES from Wakad (Pune) & night riders from Mumbai.You'll find everything, Right from snacks to Beers & from a Hookah to a BISLERI.Would recommend to have a trip in summers on a Friday evening with a group of friends."
180,Nice view of entire area,It gives great view and cool ambience. Fr kids there is horse ride and hot maggi which we enjoyed. Sunset view and peaceful evening
181,Lion's Viewpoint,You keep clicking the photo in different direction and have different backgrounds. We reach there close to Sun set and the view of sun set was amazing while sipping hot tea and pakoras !!
182,Beautiful view,"During my trip to LOnavala, this is the Most Amazingly beautiful point, I have ever been to! Surrounded by Mountains, it leaves you Awestruck! To add icing on the cake, the weather was so beautiful as if you could have spend a lifetime there watching all this natural beauty! If you ever plan to go to Lonavala, this is a place not to be missed at any cost.Watch the Pictures to believe me!"
183,March is not the right time,"Incredible people,batata bhaji at the point served were reasonable price and out of the world taste."
184,Suresh bhai,"This point has plain land for parking and eating shacks. There will be camel ride, horse ride and quad bike rides available on rent. Parking is not free here. Eatables are very expensive due to transportation of raw material. One can spend an hour easily at this place."
185,"Great view, needs more maintenance and tourist discipline",It was a nice and memorable trip which I never thought will be so much fun and lions point was one of the best place where u can really touch the cloud and barbecue corn which we are in rain was also a memorable experience.Will suggest to all to have a visit once.
186,Family visit,This point is situated 14 km away on the way to Sahara Amby Valley project. You can get a breathtaking view of the valley and sunset.
187,Lots of Monkeys,This is one of the must visit places of lonavala. Weather is perfect with stunning sceneric beauty with hills n mountains n valleys.
188,An average location,"The view is great especially with sunset. The road is hilly. However the stall owners persistently pester you to buy snack items from them, which is slightly irritating. Otherwise the area is slightly stony so don’t let your kids run amok. The view is otherwise good."
189,Good for sunset and sunrise view,"After Bhushi dam we visited the lion's point in Lonavala which is only few Kms away. This place is situated at the top and you get a very beautiful view from here. A perfect place to get beautiful pictures. This also being a tourist spot there are lot of food stalls. However, sanitation is not very good at this place. There were hardly any toilets at this place. There is no activity at this place but you can have different types of bhajiya at this place which is the speciality."
190,Breathtaking view,I visited in August during raining season with family and friends. It was awesome to be there as clouds were touching our face. Nice weather with lots of green hills. Loved this place wish to visit again there.
191,Great views,Few months ago we have visited over there for hanging out with friends. There sight seeing is awesome we can see an awesome view from there. Thank you
192,Always fun to be here ,This place is lovely in the misty early mornings...perfect place to wait and watch the sun rise to its glory while you can comfortably relax around the unique bonfire and devour the piping hot noodles and chai!!
193,Fantastic Scenic place,"Lion's point is nowadays not allowed to visit, because of too much rains, it is not safe to visit Lion's Point. IN this Season you will not be able to see nearby mountains. only some of the rainy season fountains are visible. Noting special"
194,Amazing view,Really good view of nature from Top of the hill. we went during evening and sunset was amazing to watch.However very bad management of premise. Parking area is mess with clutter. and person who is taking 50 Rs as parking charges posing in government cloths accept cash and doesnt provide receipt. No accountability and all money goes in his pocket hence no money left to manage premise. Hope govt. takes action soon.
195,"Good view, but very hot during day.",The place was great had a truly memorable experience. The clouds were Misty  very low all around . From the point the valley was invisible due to the clouds was an awesome experience
196,Wonderful picturesque point to observe sunset & sunrise,View is awesome but the location is surrounded by local vendor of snacks and need More cleaniness and greenary
197,Pathetic place... Down market..,"There is no Ola or Uber in Lonavala so you better get a car or cab from your location. There's no need of trekking. Amazing view. Food is too expensive, no proper rates ask before you eat. We paid 500 for 4 maggi."
198,Great View Point with stunning views of the landscape,"It's a view full mountains, it's on the mountain road after bhushi dam. Too much foggy and cloudy around the place and in road."
199,High point at lonavla ,"View was awesome of nature and waste done by us. Shopkeepers please be strict or the people who manages place,  it's a beauty don't let people create nuisance specially with garbage."
200,Awesome place,"I had been this place 3-4 times so I know in monsoon, you can’t even see your hand due to cloud surrounding you and on a sunny day, you can see expressway. The review is based on all experience.In Monsoon, we enjoyed the fog or we feel that we are in heaven. The fog becomes so dense that u cannot see another person at the distance of 5 feet Really, nature at this place during raining or rainy days is mesmerizing. the tea by local ones is really tasty. driving in cool wind and dense Plantation to reach lions point gives new energy. The place will you spellbound but driving can be dangerous at turns as one cannot see in the fog But at the end, worth a trip."
201,Ok ok in February Month,Maggie Bhajiya is what tou don’t go for As soon as you reach the shopkeepers run behind youWhile government hasn’t done anything to make the place better the bhai log still charge parking charges
202,Excellent place to spend Friday Nights if you're from Mumbai or Pune,"It is a nice place to hang out..but if u r planning to go in out season its worthless..i visited there in feb, its totally dried out..try planning between july to nov..nice panoramic view of valley.."
203,"Tea, Fritters and Sunsets","Its the most pathetic place in Lonavala...dirty, congested. In short this is nothing else than the mountain version of Juhu beach, food stalls, one camel, dirtied by place by the revellers...Avoid!!"
204,Great view.,"Best place in Lonavala to be at, clouds were all around, chilling wind , hot tea , Maggie, bhutta make it a delight.These days it is open only till 7 PM only, not whole night, this is little disappointing."
205,Sun set point,It's nice place as the view of the valley and very good location for photography lover. The area needs to be cleaned up a lot and tourism needs to be regulated. The ground is full of bottles crushed into paste which is indeed dangerous.
206,Its beautiful out there.....,It is about 15 km away from lonavala..u have to go through city. excellent place.roads are good. Lonavala lake and bushi dam are on the way too.u can see velly and mountains.pleasent sunset.. u can enjoy onion fritters and maggi and more at thia place with cool breeze. only negative thing is about parking area. They r charging 50 rs per 4 wheel but parking area needs lot of improvement.
207,Serene view,"This once beautiful hill top tourist destination has now been reduced to a noisy and littery spot, frequented by under-civilised humans who don't care a damn about beauty and serenity. The din of car horns, the shrieks of wild women, the selfie adventures of rowdy young men and the complete lack of courtesy and civility by visitors have taken away the smile from the face of these hills. The clouds also seem to be have had enough of this nonsense, and don't really want to come back here again. I seriously think the government should restrict the number of tourists on a daily basis and ban tourist movement between 7 pm and 6 am."
208,Pit stop on the way to Mumbai,"What a place to visit specially on a rainy day. With the clouds hitting you from all around and wind blowing at a reasonable speed it is truly an life time experience on the top of the hill. Enjoyed the hot tea and hot , crispy corn pakodas. Although there was heavy crowd on a Sunday morning but really enjoyed the moment."
209,Lonavala's best and topmost point,"Lion’s point is one of the key attractions of Lonavala. Sunset at Lion’s point is what you go there for. Lion’s point is located at an elevation higher than Lonavala. You are overlooking a valley in front of you and gorgeous mountains in the front. The beauty of the place is uniquely different in different Seasons. In rainy season it is the fog and waxing and waning of clouds. In summer it is the clear view. In winter it is the early sunset.Camel and pony rides, corn,potato, onion and corn bhajias with chai and a congregation of street vendors add magic to the place.Monkeys, stray dogs and cows are the resident performers..All in all a few hours of fun..Mumbai and Puneites love this place.."
210,Really Good in Monsoon,Situated abour 15 Kms from Lonavala city this mountain peak area is having awesome experience. The clouds were Misty very low all around. Visit during rainy day to enjoy full beauty of place and before sunset.
211,Beautiful Morning Point,just an average place. personally did not enjoyed my visit. may be better to visit during monsoon. not worthy
212,Good view-better in monsoon,"This place is also know as Tiger Point, This is the highest peak in the surroundings of Lonavala, and also the most visited place in lonavala.This point is always inside the clouds along with coolest Breeze.This place has some delicious Pakoras, hot tea & coffee, maggi to serve and give you this best feel of hot food in cold climate.They also have shacks to seat in rainy timesBest time to visit this place is before sunset"
213,Wonderful View,"Visit only if u have NOTHING to do. Just a high point with a valley view, not too exciting. Places to eat and park aplenty."
214,Nice drive,The driver took us to the topmost point (Lion's Point ) from where we could have the breathtaking view of the mountains touching the sky! It was a warm day so that we had a clear view.
215,Great views,"No hill station is complete without a commercialized sunset point .....vendors selling over priced snacks and tea on the pretext of a great view....On the road towards Amby valley, a flat stretch of land that offers great views of the valley has now been cornered by few stalls selling tea and refreshments.The views can range from dramatic to disappointing depending on the pollution and haze ..... On weekends you would have to compete with crowds for vantage points and also dodge the monkeys looking to steal your snack.Monsoon views are amazing during the day with mist covering the whole valley."
216,Nice place for watching sunset,"Lion's point is one of the most beautiful spots of Lonavala.The hilly terrain and the appearance of natural scenery gives immense pleasure to eyes, heart and soul.I loved having the touch of the spot."
217,crowded,Too much hyped by name. If you come to south inaid or north east part of india you will find better view points compared to this. Its just hyped jus by the name of lonavala.
218,"Good drive to the place, nice views, but nothing very exciting though","It is a good drive in a car from Pune. There will be steep slopes on the way, so one must be careful. This point is nothing but a huge free space where people can park, play loud music, dance and eat some snacks from local stalls. You can get a nice view of hilly ranges and sunset"
219,Great View but very dirty and crowded,"Visited in Summer so, i have not seen rain fall only hills & mountains are looked is good, It is not a safe place pl. take care while  seeing from the pick, parking is available, & foods are also available, fresh & natural air, Good place for every one, house ride is available"
220,Great Views !,The best place to visit and spend some quality time with your family is Loin's point. You can enjoy the beautiful view of the setting sun.
221,A over hyped place for me specially during winters !,"Located on the one of the highest peak of Lonavala, beautiful Atmosphere. Need to visit early in morning before Sunrise, you can view fascinating view of the sun from there.."
222,awesome,"One of the most beautiful place of lonavala , just 20 minutes ride from main market and 10 minute ride from Bhushi Dam , we visited last week it was awesome , densely cloudy and temperature was so cold that it was tough to stand in open as wind was also blowing with full speed ."
223,Just a View Point,"It's around 10km from Lonavala Station, This is one of the stunning place of Lonavala. It becomes all foggy & Beautiful in Rainy season. Keep your food stuff with you as restaurant here will just rip you off."
224,we went at night .. terrible,Amazing valley View with FOG in morning  and  Sunset in evening. Nothing much to do but to relax in pleasant natural atmosphere  during week days.
225,Nice view from Mountains,"Recently been to Lions Point with the family. It's a far away place from hustle and bustle of normal Lonavala City on the way to Aamby Vally. A big plateau where you can enjoy the scenic vally views and the sun set Few eateries available around to enjoy the snacks and tea, coffee and other eatables /  drinks. Ample charveable parking place available at the venue. A ride from Lonavala to Lions Point is a real fun. But one need to be careful while driving due to narrow and curvey roads..."
226,Superb view,Huge traffic jams on weekend. No traffic police at any place of interest cause some severe jams. View points surrounding are not clean but awesome weather and nice view makes it beautiful.
227,Perfect top View,Please avoid if you are with kids as it is poorly maintained and unsafe .Need some attention from Government and local authorities.
228,Lions point,"I visited this place with my wife on a public holiday (Wednesday, 15th august 2018). It was a one day trip. We took a train from Mumbai and that was a really good decision as you avoid the traffic and reach in half the time. It was a rainy day. We hired a cab from Lonavala station for the whole day.Lion's point has amazing view. But we encountered a lot of rain and wind. Impossible to have an umbrella open. Nevertheless, the view compensates for everything else. A bit overcrowded though. Dont forget to have maggi and coffee (highly overpriced) here, as these go very well with the weather.My only suggestion would be to avoid going here on a weekend or a public holidays. You Spend a lot of time just waiting for your turn at each point. But all in all a lovely place to visit."
229,Family outing ,"A little prior to the Tiger Point. One can park the car at either of the two place. The parking area is uneven , and bumpy . The view is good and in summer it can turn hot , There is very little tree cover"
230,Too much hyped by name,"This place is roughly 1.5 hrs from the city center. We went during the end of winter, so the place was pretty dry, but at the same time the skies were pretty clear too and allowed for some majestic views."
231,Lions Point,Lions point is finest point in lonavala. A must visit place in lonavala itinerary.you can enjoy Maggy and bhajia with tea and enjoy sun set.lots of monkey near by.
232,Lovely Place but overcrowded ,"This is must go.. rest all like Bhushi dam, Lonavala lake, Karla caves, Lohgarh etc would be Okies for regular traveler but this is something not to miss and have a unique view.Tiger Leap/Tiger Point/ Lion’s point are at same place.Other place to look for is Khandala ghat, Rajmachi Garden view, Dune fall view, sunset point. Again at same place and offer a good view."
233,Can be avoided,Visit in night if you love music and chai while sitting on edge of mountain. Cool breeze can be experience.
234,Beautiful view,This place has extemely wonderfull view from the hilltop. Lot of monkeys can be seen. Also nice place to eat maggie and snacks here if you staying in nearby resorts.
235,Scenic View,Just a short stop at Lion's point. Enjoyed the great view! A bit sad to see travellers leave their rubbish behind.
236,Njoiable,Stray cattles are big issue there. Go during monsoon season u guys will get better view and scenery.
237,Nice ,Nice view of valley although the best time to visit is during monsoons. There's ample availability of modes of transportation. Food and beverage is also available.... It isa wonderful drive to this location.. Nice cool breeze
238,Small stop,"This place is a 15 minute uphill drive from lonavala but definitely worth the time & effort. It is covered with fog most part of the year & has some activities like camel or horse riding, hot snacks around the year. Try the corn, pakodas or hot maggi here."
239,Poorly maintained and unsafe ,"Best time is evening sunset. Reach early by 4 pm , spend some time in chats , camal ride etc and get ready for the treat for the eyes. Its awesome"
240,Good view,"A visit to Lonavla during the rains is IMPERATIVE and no visit is complete without venturing to TIGER POINT.The journey to the Tiger point in rains is enchanting though a bit perilous. The smog makes it almost impossible to see as your car moves ahead. However, the mist makes the weather chilly and enjoyable. To visit Tiger point there is no entry fee, just the parking fee.  The Tiger point overlooks the Western Ghats though it wasn’t visible due to the fog. The food shanties start teeming with food enthusiasts like me especially in such enchanting weather. The locals whip up fritters or ‘pakoras”- corn or cheese coated in seasoned batter and deep fried. I’d really recommend the cheese pakoras to the ones who surely don’t want to stay on a diet. Oh! and how could I forget the corn on the cobs- coated with spicy mix and dripping butter, which is simply called “BHUTTA” in colloquial language . And there is always the famous “CUTTING CHAI” (Tea) and classic Maggi. Beware of pseudo stops which the locals proclaim to be Tiger point for commercial reasons and make you stop on the way. I’d also recommend carrying raincoats or a windcheater as umbrellas may turn into a parachute!!!!!!!Furthermore, the route to this bewitching sight passes through the market where in there are various shops with a plethora of hand-made pottery. Your bargaining skills can be put to good use here. In addition, en-route one can also visit the famous Bhushi dam and the serene Pawna Lake.Thus, the Tiger point, Lonavala is a sight to behold. It acts like nothing but a sheer delight to your eyes. The gastronomical features add on to the appeal. Although a tourist place, I was disappointed to see it very poorly maintained and was sad to see people littering around this beautiful place. We can definitely do our bit by not littering and throwing all the waste in the bins."
241,Very Good view and Bad / corrupt management,"Its a great mountains view especially during/after rains, lavish greenery, sometimes there will be fogs"
242,Good View,Beautiful and scenic.It was raining and the point was covered with fog.We had Corn pakoda and Maggie along with hot tea.
243,Magnificient sunset point! ,"Reached Lions point located about 15 km from Lonavala City.  Long winding uphill drive on a very Smooth surface.  Scenic with a setting sun for company.  The point had a rough uneven parking lot charging Rs 50For parking.   Haphazardly parked cars , total chaos over there.  The scene of a setting sun over the dukes noseCompensates  for the chaotic parking.  Overall a very nice place to visit in the evening."
244,Ok place,The entry and the parking area is really run down. The charge for entry parking but looks like nothing is invested back. The railing are virtually all broken and not repaired or replaced. However the views are fantastic.
245,lot of fog overthere,View is good but very dirtyBroken beer and whiskey bottles and bottles and trash all over the place Very hot  take water and wear a cap abd sun glasses
246,Great views and some fun activities for all,Panoramic View of the hills at lions point amazing weather..... great location for outing with friends and family..
247,"Amazing view, with a bit of luck you can see monkeys!!","place is ok because of poor management,now a days it’s really dirty around the area,lost of food stalls but they don’t  think about natural environments,if management can clean the area and arrange some people to look after,it will be amazing place for short trips"
248,A View worth visiting,A must visit during rains or even in sep after rains. Parking available @rs 100 Few small shops available. Corn Maggie etc. Drive is amazing all the way from lonavla market to this point.Advisable to carry umbrella and drive carefully. Best time. June to October.
249,Hill Point,"It's around 9-10 kms from Lonavala. You have to book Taxi on hire because their is no Ola / uber available. Very nice place, excellent view of mountains. Awesome weather. You must visit this place."
250,Lions point ,Not that great. The place doesn't have good infrastructure. The pollution mars the sunset view.  Would give it a miss and go for sunset points in Mahabaleshwar.
251,Beautiful place ,"I visited here during Monsoon this year in the month of July, the weather was quite nice.I visited with my family and enjoyed a lot there. I would recommend to try warm sweet corns / Bhutta... Spend atleast an hour there to feel the environment... Thanks Lonavala..."
252,best place in Lonavala,"We went there in September during the low season.The view was awesome due to the monsoon, everything was very green, the air was clear and we were able to see kilometers away. The mountains in this region are really strange and beautiful.However we were very disappointed to see once again trash everywhere, loud people and even loud disco music coming from the nearby rickshaws... Also you cannot go there by walking, you need to take a rickshaw and the prices are discouraging.Anyway you should go for the view but don't expect it to be a peaceful retreat."
253,Must visit site in Lonavala ,"Love to visit it again again  lovely to spend time with nature....... The Karla Caves and the Bhaja Caves are ancient Buddhist shrines carved out of the rock. They feature massive pillars and intricate relief sculptures. South of the Bhaja Caves sits the imposing Lohagad Fort, with its 4 gates. West of here is Bhushi Dam, where water overflows onto a set of steps during rainy season."
254,Good sunset view,Lions point at lonavla where cheese pakoda and Maggie and cheese corn bhel and other food items are famous.This is a very good natural sight seeing point of lonavla which is definitely visited by every lonavla visitor.
255,Spectacular view and tasty eateries!,"Their are two points at Lonavala one is Lion's point and another is Tiger's point both are at a distance of 200 meters, view is almost same from both points, parking fee is Rs. 50 for four wheelers. Best time to visit before noon and around 4-6 pm."
256,mesmerizing view!!!,"It was hot and dusty, I can only imagine how the place could be during the rainy season. but March is definitely not the right time to go."
257,Awesome ,"Guys...have you ever seen a camel awaiting to carry you, in a cool sight seeing spot! Lion's point is that scenic place where the view was breath taking. The hills & vales clothed with lush green herbs and Yellow flowers, lot of monkeys that doesn't do any pranks, quite a few eateries where you get amazing chai for Rs.20 and some varieties of crispy snacks, Camel & horse rides for Rs.100 and eternal peace for free!! There was another 'vantage point' too...that could be seen from Lion's point. Beautiful experience!"
258,Awesome ,"Weather predictions can often go wrong in hilly areas, but still try to reach there on a clear day. Around mid-day gives you the maximum chance of getting a clear view of the valley. Easily accessible by road."
259,"5th time visit to Lion's Point Lonavala, India",Both Tiger's point and lion's point are close to each other. View is awesome. The only problem with the place is with the parking area. The ground is full of bottles crushed into paste which is indeed dangerous.
260,Scenic,"Just a place to hang around and enjoy view of the hills and nature. Nothing much to do other than that.  Food vendors, people trying to sell all sort of stuff will keep nagging you. Good for folks into photography. Went around noon and it was burning hot, would suggest go early in the morning and towards dusk."
261,"Lovely placr, amazing weather. ",My Son and daughter  bite by Monkey at Monkey point .Please be careful when you visit monkey point lonavala.
262,Beautiful View. ,It's not so safe for families. Tey to go in groups. Come out of that area before the sunset because the boys come with the groups. Being a trekker and being a lover of visiting places. I liked the place but what I saw is that. It's not so safe for families. And don't go alone. Try not to fight with anyone if you are with family. If you are alone then do whatever you want because this place is mostly for bachelor's
263,Must visit but only for panoramic views,We went to enjoy the sunset however just when we ordered some tea and Maggie police came and closed all the shops and asked everyone to leave from there
264,Enjoy the Nature,"I had been in Monsoon & recently visited in Jan. There was a huge difference. In monsoon there is fog everywhere, its cold & you love eating hot snacks. At other times, its just a simple place. Click pics, sit at the various food joints, have some snacks & come back."
265,Beautiful view point,"It was my first visit to Pune. Family also hadnot been to Lonavala so we decided to visit as we had heard of many sites there. We started with Lion's head and were extremely disappointed.Its nothing but someone's imagination to see a Lion in a hill sculpted by nature. To us it didnt even resemble anything like lion.There is nothing to eat except tens of tea stall which also offer maggi, anytime of day, for all your meals.... so typical of India these days Basically its just a view point to see valley below. There are 2-3 waterfall points which may be interesting after a heavy rainfall, if waterfalls grow bigger."
266,"Wonderful view, but mist can totally mask it.","Located ahead of Bhushi Dam in Lonaval, the Point is very good scenic aspect. But it lacks basic Amenities like Clean washrooms. Municipality charges entry fee to the point, but are not using the money to develop the Lion's Point."
267,Lion's point,"It's nice to be here around 5 in the evening. Make sure you check sunset time and plan your travel accordingly. Gets little busy on the way back. One can explore the side eateries where they offer pakoras and Maggie, bit costly though you will love the taste"
268,Good point for lonavla,Must visit during monsoons.Specially designed food stalls for Bhajiya Maggi chai I love corn Bhajiya and filter coffee.
269,Hopeless and waste of time,"This trip to Lions Point, Lonavala was a perfect beginning to my winter holidays. So, I along with some  of my friends got into a  car to take us to Lions Point, Lonavala . On the whole way we just laughed and  talked about how amazing the whole trip will be.Leaving from Mumbai,dressed in a green hoodie top and shorts we went to Vashi and then headed straight to Lions Point, Lonavala.The food at the snacks corner was good. In the nature full of oxygen, metabolism is good too. The best time to go there is early morning or late evening. We went during late evening when the sun was about to set. At that time the air cool and atmosphere is too. Earlier we had lunch at Lion's Dhaba which is around a kilometer away from the Lion's point.Camel ride gives goosebumps, it's must try. I won't really recommend this trip for small kids below 10 years. Perfect for friends and couples."
270,Lion point lonavala,I was here to spend some time as I have nothing else to do that day and somone suggested me to visit this place.It's a beautiful site with amazing views.Must spend some time here.
271,"Naturally Beautiful, Beautifully Natural!","The place offers a magnificient view of Khandala/Lonavala Valley. We were excited to see the Shivalinga shaped mountain, kids enjoyed a lot. Don't miss hot bhajjis and maggi :)"
272,Stunning view,Lion's point is one of the most visited place in Lonavala. Lion's point is just like hill station. You can have best view of nature. Best time to visit this place is winter and rainy season.
273,Ok ok,"We always make it a point to spend atleast 3 to 4 early morning hours at Lion's Point in every visit to Lonavala. Love this place !!Really enjoy Morning hours with Best Valley View, Hot Bhajiya & Tea :)"
274,Good Point,"I didn't find it so exciting about the place as such, but the drive to the Lions point was good with nice winding roads and good views."
275,Nice place to visit,"Just a View point, No maintenance, lot of plastic waste thrown into valley. We went on a weekday and no crowd. There are food stalls but you only get few varieties like maggie.We headed to Korigad fort after visiting this place."
276,Great Mountains view,I felt there is lot of confusion between the name.. Tigers point or Lions point... I believe they are the same thing...'Sher' in Hindi can be tiger or lion too. Mesmerizing view will keep you engaged for hours... Nobody's is interested to take care of the place... But the view just makes you forget everything else... Must visit if you are in lonavala
277,Cloud's Home,Superb atmosphere..too much cold and maggi bhaji & kanda bhaji in that atmosphere. awesome experience..
278,Nice location,We missed fog climate which was suppose to be Very disappointed by all our family members Will come soon
279,Beautiful view,Lions point is not for family. Sometimes crowed over there can be worst come to worst. If you're visiting lion point in night with family thn don't go over there. People go over there for drinks they play loud music over thr and some wired things.
280,Driving up in the monsoons was a bit scary...,"Best time to visit is during end of monsoon. It is covered with dense fog, actually cloud during peak monsoon. Usually crowded on weekends still a fun place for everyone. Widely spread place with beautiful landscapes. Top most point in lonavala.Maggie, chai and snacks points are available."
281,The most amazing views,Spending one hour here is Good.Dont try more rides its not worth money.But you get nice imagesAnd get perfect cold experience.
282,Beautifull fog regular continous rain!!,"We went in the month of January so everything was dried up. Even then, you get a good view from here. I can only imagine how beautiful this turns in monsoons. More than the view, this place is worth a visit especially to taste the corn pakode sold at a food truck at this point. Chai and corn pakode coupled with the scenic view just makes this a perfect destination.Worth a visit if you are in lonavala, though I would recommend that the best time to go there is in monsoons."
283,Very touristy and crowded. Can be avoided,Lions point is one of the best point in lonavala great place and such a huge and height is very high of this point I totally loved it
284,Lion's Point,"Beware of touts who fleece you right from parking charges to exorbitantly priced tea & snacks at this venueOverall, an average view from a height, impressive only during the rains. Of course, reaching this place during the rains is another challenge, due to teeming crowds who throng this venue then"
285,One of the must visit points in lonavala but...,"It was first time for us to meet Lonavala. Already have been to Ooty, Munnar, Coorg and Kodaikanal, so thought this place is also going to be similar points like that. However the climate, the drizzle and the fog changed my perception.It was so nice that we did not have mind to come back even after spending more than 1 hour."
286,Panoramic View of the hills and the valleys,"How nature transforms itself according to seasons and how much panoramas can change with climate.I've seen the images in summer and we visited in monsoon, and just after the rainy season, it is a beautiful spot of Lonavala indeed.The highest point and it offers gorgeous views of the nearby mountain areas, very lush green and"
287,Good For a Ride Out of Mumbai,One of the two points at Lonavala. Luckily it wasn't crowded during my visit last weekend. A good half n hour visit is more than enough at this place.There are few food stalls too.
288,Heavenly view from the edge,"Lion's Point was the 1st place I went to visit in Lonavala. Needless to say, it is the best. It gives you breathtaking and panoramic views of the valley and hills. It is the highest point in Lonavala. You only get snacks and beverages at the place. There is no restaurant. You can spend hours here; it is so beautiful. Parking charges are Rs 20 for two-wheelers and Rs 50 for cars."
289,Nice view point,"Lions point is almost 12 kilometres away from Lonavala railway station, next to the tiger point. It is a great place with fantastic weather during monsoon. First time I seen in my entire life a place with valley, hills, rain and fog at the same time."
290,Amazing View,"I have visited this place on 13th Sept 18 along with my wife. Since it was monsoon retarding season , temperature was drastically increasing after 10 am in morning. So the visit at morning hours is suggestible and cool breeze will lighten your mind & becomes stress free. Also carry some snacks or light foods , if required , because buying from local shops is too costly and unhealthy also it seems."
291,Good rainy day,"Good enough view, camel/pony rides for kids; LOTS of littering and irresponsible behaviour towards monkeys by the visitors"
292,Don't go with family ,Had a good time and u have to be there before 6:00 pm to see sunset.Lots of monkeys and have to careful otherwise your purse or glasses will go.
293,A peak to enjoy with family,I keep coming back to this place again and again. We went to this place last week. As usual amazing place to visit. Can try Tea & Maggi (& Hookah). You must have seen these hills while flying over Lonavla during your flights to / from Mumbai.
294,Nice scenic view in rainy season,"2/3 times ive seen the point covered in thick fog with only the lights of the car in front visible.. but the time i managed to get a look at the view, it turned out to be beautiful.. the valley is really deep with a lake visible at a distance"
295,Good place,"This is not the first time, I was visiting Lion's point.But traveling first time with my kid.Was a bit disappointed with the crowd"
296,Awesome Lion's Point,"we went at night, some where around 7pm... the place was totally terrible.. No Lights at all... only uneven place to walk, so many cows, and filthy environment... we left in 5 minutes after seeing terrible stuff..."
297,Beautifull valley scene,"If you have not been to this point, I assume you missed an important place in and around Lonavala. This is a must for all visitors for a view that you will remember for your entire life."
298,Beautiful sight in monsoon,Good place...Like a fair... people are waiting here...Crowded on weekends...On way to ambey valley...Camel rides and food stalls present...
299,Mindblowing view from top,Evening on a green platue....winds blowing...a bit crowded..the ride to the poiny is much enjoyable....
