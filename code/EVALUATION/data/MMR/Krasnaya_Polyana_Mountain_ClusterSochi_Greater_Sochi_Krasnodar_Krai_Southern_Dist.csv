0,Nice trip in the mountains. ,"Everything is new, the gondols was nice and not to many people. It was a warm day and beautiful view 360*We had a good lunch almost on the top. Nice to see after use, after the Olympics. Great place, love to come back."
1,Stunning,"There was no snow but yey it worth the visite, there is easy to reach and it was nice to be in the nature, towards the left you have the snowy peak of the mountains and to the right the beach."
2,Out in the open,"This place is best for winter time and for ski and snowboard lovers, but we visited in summer and very very happy about it. No lines, no crowds, fresh air, wonderful views, mountains, walks, bikes, horses, it was quite enough ) if you in a area it is a must see!"
3,OMG !,"Indeed a wonderful place to visit and enjoy the nature, especially in summer its most attractive with freshness of the nature around. Exiting vacation point and love to spend time around with family or friends."
4,Gorki Gorod Cluster cable car,"You will see one of the best places ever.Wonderful nature,tremendous mountains,feeling of flying. Besides, beautiful buildings seem like from some european city."
5,Shouldnâ€™t be missed,"The place worth to visit while you are in Sochi. Wonderful buidlings, spectacle view and a lot of place to walk and sport."
6,Amazing trekking on the mountains,"It's absolutely worth seeing! 7 years ago there were just empty mountain slopes and today you can enjoy newest cable roads, cosy stylish hotels, walking areas and shops. The view from the height of  2400 meters opens a captivating panorama of the beautiful Caucasus. The road is very comfortable - it's only 30 mini tunes from the airport and Olympic park."
7,Very Amazing Place and Great location,"Beautiful mountains, stunning views, great food and drink. The cable car ride up,the mountain was stunning. Can only imagine what it is like in the winter!"
8,You are about to touch the clouds ,"Great place to visit as it is where the 2014 Olympic games were hosted.Very popular even in summer and quite busy.Lovely wildflowers,snow in the distant mountains,cattle grazing on the summit and a horse saddled but no riding just taking photos.Took three enclosed cable cars to reach the top.Can purchase food and souvenirs at the top.I would highly recommend using Sergei from Kopeika taxi company +89182086201.He was the only taxi driver to use a meter the entire time I was in Russia for one month and he even waited 2 hours til I finished without charging waiting time."
9,Rose Valleys' tourist attraction,"it's a beautiful place. But now we do not nature - Putin cut down all the trees and destroyed Mzymta River - there is no more fish. The village is dirty, a lot of construction equipment and a lot of people. I do not recommend it to rest. Very expensive."
10,Good view and virgin nature,"A trip to Krasnaya Polyana is interesting here mountains, clear mountain air, crystal clear water of the rivers, flora and fauna, but the animals I was not able to see and photograph them on camera. All the animals live here in the mountains far from people and construction of various facilities for the Olympic Games. In the mountains I climbed to an altitude of 1500 meters above sea level. Animal I have not seen here only plants and trees. Guide in the mountains was a resident at an army jeep, which suggested to me by my guide, for an additional fee. Do not forget to specify when ordering on a tour of what you see and what will be a stop on the road in the meadow. Great choice of routes, as well as travel agencies in Sochi. I ordered a hike in the mountains with a guide, cableway, lunch, and stops at tourist attractions. The purpose of my trip here to take pictures of mountains and attractions. First stop was the viewing platform overlooking the gorge Ahtsu, beautiful mountain views and even fly helicopters here along the gorge. At the second stop called ""Bear Corner"" all the tourists drinking seltzer water healing, here is the mineral springs of water. Water from this source was to the taste pleasant and invigorating, I felt that it might even sweet. Take a 1.5 liter bottle to fill it with water, which I did in the absence of packaging. Before entering into the source of the locals sell honey which is extracted industrious bees in the vicinity of the Caucasus Reserve. The third stop was at the waterfall ""Girls tears"", where you can take pictures of waterfalls and mountain views. Here we are at Krasnaya Polyana, in a wine tasting and honey from a local resident. After the tasting we were brought to the restaurant where we dined. Everything was tasty and inexpensive here. At the exit from the restaurant we waited for a local guide in the mountains at an army jeep, which took us, me and three people from the group in the mountains, but only to places where there is snow, because it was impossible to drive farther, and we walked through the snow up. For this trip bring athletic shoes, but you can not take it, because you can even sunbathe here at the height of the mountains, and the form of snow happy it's warm here. There is also a beautiful view of the Krasnaya Polyana at the foot of the mountain Aibga where you can photograph the panorama of the mountain range with snow-capped peaks. After a trip into the mountains brought us to the cableway, where we waited for a part of our group. There is also a good view of mountains and rivers, which resemble snakes, and of course the fresh mountain air. I really liked it here, especially the mountains. Skiers do not have here, as the ski season ends in mid-May, but tourists are always here a lot. I know what draws them here, the mountains."
11,unforgettable ,"Breathtaking scenery with spacious cablecars.  This will be the setting of the 2014 Olympics Winter Sports.  The place is still obviously going through massive work in building resorts and facilities.  I beleive in about 2 years the place will be simply amazing. You have to keep in mind that Sochi's climate is a bit humid due to the Black Sea, so you have to check to see how the weather is at the time and that the snow has not melted yet. Sadly I visited the area in June and there was no snow at all in the skiing area."
12,Wonderful trip,"Just spent 4 days at the Rosa Khutor resort, and the skiing was Great. Tons of snow, especially near the top.  Unfortunately only about 60% of the runs are open due to avalanche danger, which concentrates the crowds on the gondolas. But all in all a great ski experience."
13,Just visite it,"The most wonderful experience to live with the whole family. The views, the weather, the attractions and the possibilities to spend a magical day are endless. We will definitely return. This is the NUMBER ONE!"
14,The magnificant landscape,"Need to take 4 cableway to reach 2500 meter, fresh air and incredible view, strongly recommended. don't fofget the sunblock cream in case of sunshine day/"
15,Cable car to the summit is a must do,Beautiful in the winter with snow. A must is the journey up the mountain. Limited activities outside of skiing and snowboarding. Ice skating is available.
16,Worth to see,"We went to the winter park for a day tour in early october , there was no snow but it was a great tour around and up on the hils, it must be super in the winter time for the snow lovers."
17,Amazing scenery,"Visited in February 2015 and had an amazing time with the family as we tried out the three major resorts in the mountain cluster and discovered an unmatched breadth of facilities and opportunities for skiing down slopes and cross country, despite being very busy. The resort dwarfs the ""well established European"" equivalents for the quality of facilities, unmatched scenery, views and its proximity to the infrastructure of the Sochi city. The unique location allows visitors to explore the wider area on snowmobiles, as we did, and also to go ice skating on Sochi's excellent  skating rinks. We also went on brilliant excursions in the wider Sochi area and took a boat trip. An overall unforgettable experience and we will definitely return.Contrary to the anti-Russian politically motivated propaganda, including the previous review, Sochi and its winter resorts (three major locations) had record visitor numbers in the 2014 season with all hotels reporting record occupancy rates. As testament to its popularity Sochi for the first time appeared in the Prime Ski Property Index ranking 11th out of 20 world resorts  and beating a number of heavily publicized resorts including Switzerland's glitzy Gstaad, which we visited 2 years ago. I can see why as other resorts pale in comparison with the Sochi mountain cluster's scale, beauty and location."
18,It is beautiful...,"We visited here on an excursion from our cruise ship.  Well worth doing, even in summer.  The scenery is beautiful, and we were able to ride some of the ski lifts for better views.  50+ billion builds a pretty nice resort!"
19,Breathtaking views,Shortly if you go to sochi don't missðŸ˜„ that place it's not expensive if you use car cables it costs 1300ruble but you are not forced to use it as you can climb yourself or use cars there wasn't snow it was at the peak about 9 c there is macdonalz at the bottom of the mountain and also in the second stop of car cable there is a good restaurant
20,Amazing!,"A small village that needs to be visited for winter sports such as skiing, snowboarding.Only thing you can do in summer is mountain biking, camping, tracking, rafting etc. and this will be challenging due to heavy construction progress going on for Sochi Winter Games.Had an apartment last month by the main road and had to change it due to non-stopping traffic of construction trucks and exhaust they heavily produced. Could not breath at night and used face mask while sleeping.Not much to do, even a day trip during summer might be considered seriously, might be waste of time."
21,Beautiful view and nature,We've visited the mountain cluster by cable car and the ride was so adventurous and great. Don't miss this cable car ride if you visit Krasnaya Poliyana. Plus while you are going up to the mountains you'll see a breathtaking Panasonic view of Caucasus mountains.
22,Very nice even in summer,It is impressive to see what can be built within only a few years. I seems to be a real good skiing venue only 50km away from palm trees on the black sea.Hopefully they finish what couldn't be finished before olympia.
23,"A new gem on the winter holiday circuit. Unmatched facilities, unique location",We visited Gorki Gorod cluster cable car.We went to the peak 2350 Meter.K5 Calble car is must. Bring your own Food and drinks.
24,Beautiful area with limited activities. ,"I went there this year in January and this was the most beautiful place for skiing I have ever seen. Mountains are beautiful. The are differenf slanks for each taste from the beginners to the experienced one. The best complex is Laura-Gazprom. Everything is new. Service is good.We stayed in Belarus hotel and I advise it to everybody: very large rooms, very tasty breakfast an dinner buffet, sauna, swimming pool, spa, nice territory.I will go there next year."
25,Must visit place if you are visiting sochi... unforgettable experience.,"We've visited the mountain cluster, with 6 persons. The trip was a part of the hotel booking that's why I don't know any prices. If you go to the mountain in the summer don't except to do anything then taking photos. There are no other activities, so if you have bigger children or teenagers it may be boring. Everything was new and in a very good shape. We felt very safe with all of the lifts. Check out the weather before going to the mountains. Otherwise it can be a very gray trip.I recommend to take also a look at the Galaktika center. It's really beautiful and has a lot of offers."
26,Summer visit just as great,This mountain resort should not be missed when you visit Sochi. Itâ€™s easily accessible from Sochi and all the facilities are modern.   Stunning scenery everywhere.
27,"It's great, but it can't last!","It was an amazing trip. The cable car took 25 minutes to reach the top. The view is amazingly shocking. You can see the clouds between mountains. The weather was amazing when we went, we didnt even need our jackets."
28,Amazing what 50 billion will buy.,"This place is incredible. one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. I can not easily express my feeling because I felt I was in a painting frame at the time we were on the top part of the mountain, the last station of cable-car.If I decide to go to Russia again, I absolutely go to Sochi Mountains."
29,Very beautiful,"One of thing you have to do in Sochi is going to Krasnaya Polyana , and uses Mountain Cluster. It will be wonderful. Very good view, virgin nature, Weather with much oxygen. Never miss it. Do it certainly."
30,A new mountain city,"The town itself now resembles Disneyland with the amount of hotels being constructed for the winter olympics. Drive up there is an adventure mainly because of the other drivers overtaking on blind bends coming down the mountain road. Normally a scenic drive, this is now a 50km construction site, but still worth a visit to get into the mountains which are beautiful."
31,Ski Resort Town,"Thhis is becoming THE wintersport resort in Russia. Investments out of this world are being made and I cannot wait to see, how this finally will turn out."
32,"Krasnaya Polyana, Esto Sadok, Rosa Khutor, Russia",We went by funicular up to the third level. On each level we stayed for a half an hour to enjoy the magnificent  views.On the second level there is quite cheap restrant
33,Impressive artificial Cluster,"Everything is so beautiful!  The ride there is great, and the views once you get there are breathtaking. Definitely take a day or two to visit Krasnaya Polyana!"
34,Improving,"The mountain cluster area of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics!  Spent several days here during the Olympic games!  Great transportation service via train (bus transportation also available) up to the Mountain cluster from the Sochi / Adler Coastal cluster.  Plenty of direction signs to help you get around once you arrive here.  lots of shopping and dining possibilities available especially in the Rosa Khutor area.  Beautiful high mountain scenery on a clear day! Safe, clean, scenic!  Great time!"
35,Spectacular venue for 2014 Winter Olympics,"The KP Mountain Cluster is improving visually very quickly, but you need to question the quality. Still a lot to work on but good progress so far."
36,Awesome powder skiing,"Another on our own private tour, this time with Sochi Holidays. It is a fairly long drive from the port in Sochi to the Ski Resort but it is well worth it, plus we had a fantastic guide and also a very capable driver. Along the way the scenery is wonderful, combine this with all the renovations they did for the 2014 Winter Olympics and you have a perfect setting. To see it in all its glory, and we did before it becomes too cold and ready for the winter skiing, you must take the Gondola ride to the summit, listed at 2240mts, it affords a beautiful overview of some snow capped mountains to the changing of the foliage for Autumn, to the villages in the valleys below. To get to the top you will make two stops change Gondola's before reaching the Summit. It maybe a long journey but it is, perhaps, a once in a lifetime experience."
37,Snowboarding was Great!,"We came to Sochi and Krasnaya Polyana this summer and we loved it. Its untouched nature is amazing even though the main attraction (winter olympics) had been passed for years. Shopping, restaurants, coffee shops, gift shops, hotels are great and so many alternatives you've got. Mountain cluster and the way to get to the top of mountains was amazing. Several aerial railways and cable cars is available for your choosing. I'm definitely gonna come back in winter with my board."
38,Biulding a huge ski resort,"About an hour drive from Sochi, itâ€™s were all the action will take place during the winter Olympics. A very nice drive with breathtaking views. We had lunch at the Peak Hotel, which was just ok. I thoroughly enjoyed the area very much"
39,Krasnaya Polyana,"The commute from Sochi takes about 1 and half hours. On the way to Red Meadow we had visited the Trout farm and the Canyon (Greek restaurant).The Red Meadow has a great view, modern mountain lifts and other facilities.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnaya_Polyana,_Krasnodar_Krai I liked best the Gazprom complex (comfortable parking, lifts, shops and cafe).http://www.grandhotelpolyana.ru/en/mountain_tourist_centre/ There is also Mountain Ð¡arousel place.http://gornaya-karusel.ru/  (as for now the service is very poor - long time waiting in line to buy tickets, no free parking space), I hope it will change in next 2 years. But it has the magnificient view - about 1700 m high (much better from Gazprom viewpoints) and some restaurants on the top (expensive)."
40,A Must to visit when In Sochi,It's one of the most beautiful places to visit.It's easy to get there by train.To get the most out of your visit there I would recommend to get a guided tour and included in the tour was a trip to the top of one of the mountains where there was a fantastic view.
41,no good,"At present this has to be one of the largest construction efforts going on in the world - building a modern ski resort in the Caususes mountains.Because of this it is a difficult place to get to, to explore if you do get there and there is limited capability to stay etc.What has been built (ski jump, sliding area, some hotels,etc) is pretty impressive, but this place will come into it's own after the 2014 Winter Olympics."
42,Nothing to do at Summer: Small Village for Winter...,"This is must visit place if are around Sochi, Russia. The lift-served summit climbs to 2,320 meters (7,610 ft), giving a vertical drop of over a mile at 1,760 meters (5,770 ft). There are three lifts. Cost per adult is around Rs. 1500 for children around 750. For 2 adults and 2 children is Rs. 3000.I visited in Nov so was not able to ski, but if you visit Dec -Apr and love to ski you must visit. Very good location. Best photo place in world."
43,Olympics work in progress,"This place worth a visit at any time of the year, as it's really  beautiful. So if you like picturesque nature, come here."
44,Home of the 2012 Winter Olympics,Krasnaya Polyana is a newly constructed ski resort town that has the potential to be a world class ski resort. Much of the area is still under construction but the venues are up and running with great ski runs. It is very close to a convenient rail system that takes you to the coast or the airport. The town is new and beautiful. Can't wait to return without the Olympic crowds.
45,Great mountain view,Nothing to see.... everithing is under construction. Dusty and dirty
46,Big mountains and snowy peaks,Disney in the snow above Sochi..........Plastic town in spectacular setting. Very little to do other than ski or snowboard but that the point of the town .  A good choice of bars and restaurants from expensive to extremely expensive with a wide variation in quality and service.
47,Best place for skiing,"Krasnaya Polyana is more like a region or city in Russia.  I wouldn't really consider a ""Thing to Do"" in Sochi, but more like another place to stay near Sochi.  Krasnaya Polyana is up in the mountains about 10 miles north of the airport where Sochi is located on the Black Sea about 10 miles West of the airport.We visited over Christmas for skiing. Lots and Lots and Lots of Construction going on. Pretty amazing size to see.  I'm a little skeptical that it will all be done before the Olympic Games in 2014, but we shall see. I hear there are 3 ski resorts in Krasnaya Polyana, although I only saw 2.  I heard the 3rd is closed for construction right now.  I visited Rosa Khutor and it was a nice mountain.  Very small right now, but also undergoing construction for new hills. The mountain was challenging. The Greens were closed and the Blues were basically aggressive cat-walks with switchbacks.  The Reds and Blacks were basically untouched terrain and very fun.  Definitely for experienced skiers and snowboarders. I had a lot of fun thought.  The mountain was somewhat busy, but nearly everyone stays on the catwalks.  So if you like the reds and blacks, you've got untouched terrain all to yourself.  Be careful on the blacks though, I would highly recommend going with a partner for safety reasons.  The blacks can get a little dangerous at times if you don't know what you're doing (like me!).The other mountain is Gazprom and is located by the Grand Polyana hotel.  I tried to go, but it was closed for Construction as well. The said sometime in 2013 it would open."
48,Sochi's Ski Spot,"Don't get me wrong, this centre is top of the range - one of the best I've ever visited (and I've skied for a long time!) The facilities were up to date and very effective and the views of the Games were breathtaking. The cable car up to Rosa Khutor Alpine Centre are glorious - be sure to check that out.My only fault is a horrendous feeling it won't last - which is a terrible shame. There are at least 5 or 10, 1000 room hotels which will never be filled again. It makes me so sad that all this money, effort and a lovely resort will go to waste..."
