0,Gorgeous building day and night,This may be a new mosque compared to others around the world but it's still beautiful. Took photos day and night. The interior is also impressive and its good to spend some quiet time in there when prayers are beung held. One of the symbols of kazan .
1,Very good place!!!,"I saw a lot of mosques in UAE, Turkey, Kazakhstan, but this mosque anyway looks different. It's better to visit in evening time due to the booster light."
2,Kul Sharif - one of the most magnificent mosques,"The largest mosque in all of Europe, this is definitely worth seeing.  The inside is so light.  Plus, it's free!"
3,Beautifull,"The Mosque looks amazing from the outside and just as impressive inside. The Islam museum underneath was a little bit boring, but still worth visiting. The observation deck lets you view the floor where people pray, which was a bit strange, but allows you to see even more of the interior etc. Well worth a visit"
4,Kul Sharif Mosque,A beautiful brand new mosque in the heart of the city. It's colourful and bright. Inside you can visit a Museum of the History of Islam and an exhibition of the Islamic calligraphy and broidery. The entrance is free
5,"A beautiful, must-see place in Kazan","Seems people are divided on this one, but for me it's one of the most beautiful mosques I've seen, particularly outside, day and night. Very photogenic in my eyes and ideally situated within the Kremlin."
6,One and only,"This mosque and its surroundings are just incredible. The construction itself is out of this world, but so is the view from next to it. And the area and buildings around it are really nice. Best place to visit in Kazan!"
7,Fantastic Mosque,One of the most beautiful mosques I've ever seen! The inside of the mosque is worth a visit as well. I found the people working at the mosque to be very friendly and kind to visitors. It was fascinating to see the reading of the Koran being done (happening 24 hours a day since January 2015).
8,Glorious,It’s very beautiful. The most beautiful mosque in Russia. We stayed very near to the Kyle Sharif Mosque
9,Sure its the best-looking Mosque in the World,It looks fantastic from outside.  The mosque is surrounded by other historical structures.  A great place to walk around.  There is not much to see inside the Mosque.  A small museum is located at the basement. The entrance fee is 100 Ruble; it is not interesting to me since I do not understand Russian.
10,don't miss this beautiful mosque,"Definitely one of the most beautiful mosques I have seen in a while. Lots of historical tidbits available for showcase inside the mosque. The interior design, too, is amazing. Probably not the most populated mosque in Kazan since it is far from the centre but definitely worth a visit."
11,Russia's most iconic Mosque,"Not sure who chose to build this here, it seems out of place. Although it is a nice enough mosque, I just wonder why!"
12,A Kazan highlight,It's an amazing place to witness the great architecture of Islamic Art. You have to bring your camera cause this great mosque have lots of details that should be realized. Ps: bring your own bottles of water and snacks as they are sold in a very high price in the places near the mosque and Kremlin.
13,all together,"This was the only mosque we visited in russia,so it was an interesting experience and a nice change from all the churches and cathedrals"
14,Kul sharif mosque ,"One of the most beautiful places I have been to, it's architecture is an amazing mixture of the Iranian, ottoman and middle eastern style.."
15,A really beautiful building!,"you cant miss this mosque it is a modern mosque built within the kremlin  ,it certainly very eyecatching."
16,Great,"One of the most beautiful mosques I have seen! We got to clime up to see a prayer from the balcony, the sound carries so nicely, it was an interesting experience."
17,Just stunning ,"This is a very impressive new mosque. It is free admission and they lend you a shawl for your head and or to cover your legs. Well worth it, the ceiling and chandeliers are very impressive."
18,Spectacular views both day and night.,"I enjoyed visiting every aspect of this Mosque, also blessed myself with a short prayer inside.It's awesomely designed from the inside and outside."
19,Kul Sharif’s Gigantic Mosque ,A real icon and must visit in the center of Kazan. It is a realy new but beautiful mosque. You can take very nice pictures here and the inside also is very amazing.
20,Awesome temple,"Heard a lot of good things about that Mosque before visiting it today.I must have taken 100 shots of it, while still could stopped shooting. All angles look good and with great lucks I saw new weds posing for professional shots with the Mosque as the backdrop.kazanians are so lucky!!!"
21,Definitely a must see in Kazan,If your in Kazan you have to visit the mosque. The colours are fantastic and inside it looks modern and grand. Woman do have to wear head scarfs but the men don't.
22,mosque,"It is beautiful, but less than the ones in Istanbul. It is great to take a photo with night light, more brilliant than daytime."
23,Must visit place ,This beautiful mosque in Kazan was for a very long time the largest mosque in Russia. Not it’s been overtaken by the big mosque in Moscow.In my opinion still one of the most beautiful mosques.
24,Kazan Kremlin,Nice walk and good for pictures. The building is in good condition and feels new. It does not feel like it has a lot of heritage to it.
25,The Best place,Kul Sharif - one of the most beautiful mosques that I've seen. Excellent interior decoration. Peacefully side by side with the Orthodox churches.
26,Breathtakingly beautiful,"This is the most beautiful mosque I have been in so far. As you walk in, you are surrounded by beauty and piece. I was lucky to  be present for their 6pm service, and it was magical. Must see in Kazan"
27,Must attend in Kazan,The symbol of Kazan - amazing mosque inside and outside. Really nice to see and to walk around it. Needless to say that it is a 'must' when visiting Kazan.
28,Amazing Mosque,"Loved this mosque, was a personal highlight on my trip to RussiaThe beauty of the mosque outside and inside - uniqueGrateful for having had the opportunity of visiting this beautiful mosque"
29,Kazan Kremlin,"I’m very well travelled around the Islamic world and have seen great many stunning examples of Islamic architecture of different schools and styles. While not without charm – I was particularly fascinated by its slim beautiful minarets and most scenic location – Kul Sharif was not the most impressive mosque I’ve ever been to. It is relatively new and conveys no ambience of centuries. But of course, keeping in mind we are in Russia, it looks fairly impressive as it is.My experience of visiting Kul Sharif was a bit disappointing. At the time of no service the mosque is turned into some kind of a walk-in museum, and as such loses its spirit completely. There’s no division for male/female parts. All visitors are allowed to ascend the narrow stairs to the balcony to watch the mosque interior from up there. The balcony is small and becomes crowded fast enough. Compared to the richest decoration of the mosques in, for instance, Shiraz or Abu Dhabi, the interior of Kul Sharif is somewhat simple and restrained. When I was there, the main hall was almost unlit and looked grim. And that took away much of the interior beauty. You don’t take your shoes off when entering Kul Sharif; they sell one-use boot covers for RUR 3 at the entrance. There are also skirts and headscarves, so even if you are not dressed properly for attending a mosque, you can use these, should you wish to enter. Of course, Kul Sharif is quite a prominent landmark of Kazan and cannot be missed. It provides for fantastic photo opportunities, especially from the outside, as a part of Kremlin ensemble. But I enjoyed modest ancient mosques in the Old Tatar Sloboda much more."
30,You must see it!,"Great place, amazing view to take some good photos , I liked the mosque from inside too, I liked the whole area and Kazan people ❤️❤️"
31,A good mosque,"Probably the idea was to show how big and shiny a mosque can be, but I actually like the colors, the blue and the white, actually the interior is also simple and this I find very beautiful and at the same time a bit unusual looking back at my knowledge of Islamic art. It is worth seeing."
32,beautiful,"Compared to the mosques in Central Asia, the Middle East and N Africa, this was nothing special to look at. The best thing was how relaxed it was inside. If only Islam was as tolerant around the world as it is in Kazan, the world would be much better."
33,Stunning!,"The outside is really stunning and makes a visual impact compared to the Orthodox onion domes. But the inside is not really special. Actually, you can only see the main hall from a balcony built just for tourists. I wasn't really impressed.You can take a headscarf to cover your hair (if you are a woman), but everyone must buy plastic covers for the shoes. I think the pair cost 3 rubles. I didn't understand this because you don't walk on any carpet and you are not allowed to enter the praying area..."
34,Incredible architecture!!,The mosque is a spiritual place with unique Architecture. It is really beautiful from the outside and the inside. I recommend you go to the top storey as you will be able to see the details and the history of the mosque.
35,Well worth the stop ...,"This place is beautiful, huge, but looks light inside and colorful. If you are women- don't forget to wear scarf on to respect their culture"
36,Grandiose,"I always go into Churches of any kind. This was built for their 1,000 year celebration and is very well known. When you go in to view this place you will see people of all walks of life in here to look at the architecture of this building."
37,White Blue Mosque,The Kazan Kremlin is amazing and what I think is the most beautiful building is the mosque. Epic in size and wonderful architecture.
38,Breathtaking interiors and soaring graceful exterior,"I have spent few hours inside and around the Kul Sharif Mosque, It was very well maintained and nicely kept. it doesn't have any entrance fee but to go inside the mosque, ladies need to wear hijab. it was not crowded at all eventhough we went there around 1-2pm during the world cup fever."
39,stunning,"The only other mosques I've visited were the Blue Mosque and Aya Sofia in Turkey, but this mosque could compete, despite it being small in size. The white and blue on the outide is already beautiful and the mosaiques on the inside in the same color palate are stunning. Men and women should wear full-length pants or skirts and as a woman, I just had to cover my head and shoulders. Entrance is free."
40,Beautiful,"It was disappointing to visit this beautiful city and to find the Kul Sharif mosque and the adjacent museum on Islam closed. We were told it had been closed since the middle of 2012 and there was no sense of when it might reopen. For a city that uses its Islamic history and this mosque as a major marketing tool - it is after all a major point of difference for Kazan compared to many other Russian cities - it is not a good message. We're told it's being remodelled - but there was no sign whatsoever of work being done, unlike the rest of Kazan which resembles a construction site. It still is however a stunningly beautiful building that can be seen from many spots in the city."
41,"Very beautiful, especially in the evening","In my personal opinion this is an ugly mosque both inside and out but as it is part of the Kremlin, you may as well have a look at it. Furthermore the entrance fee is only 3 rubles (yes, 3 rubles or 4 or 5 cents in euros or dollars) so definitely not a ripoff. And for that money you get shoe covers so you don't have to take them off. In the basement there is a museum about Islam in Russia and Tatarstan in specific. Separate entrance fee is 200 ruble. In my opinion you better spend 60 ruble on the general history museum around the corner and don't forget to go inside the cathedral, it's magnificent."
42,Incredible structure,"This was the first Muslim church I ever visited, and after what I've seen, I think it's one of teh most beautiful of all the modern churches that are shown on TV with service at Muslim holidays. I was really impressed by the outer beauty and inner decoration."
43,To good to be true,The most beautiful mosque I've ever seen. Night time you can feel like in a fairytale. Definitely the most important sight in Kazan.
44,Stunning ,I made a morning visit to the mosque and was extremely impressed with the beautiful architecture and design of structure. The art work is amazing and the tilework is outstanding. A must see in Kazan
45,Amazingly beautiful Mosque,"The mosque is gorgeous. Make sure you go there both in the day time and at night - completely different experience. There is no attendance fee, but if you find a good city guide in advance - you will enjoy the mosque even more!"
46,Kul sharif Mosque at Kazan Kremlin,"This Mosque is extremely beautiful. Both from the inside and outside. There were many Russian tourists, and significantly a lot more than foreign tourists. Remember to dress modestly as this is a mosque, and to respect the culture, cover up your hair, shoulders, arms, and legs (for women) - in the winter, a beanie and a scarf would suffice.It was great for me because I understand Russian, however, if you do not speak or read the language, it can be slightly challenging."
47,Just amazing ,True masterpiece of modern Russian architecture. Probably one of the most beautiful modern buildings in Russia.
48,Very chic,Beautiful and educational. The museum in the basement is worth visiting. The architecture inside is wonderful.
49,Worth a visit,"A stunning building, the mosque as impressive inside. This grand building is a significant example of the revival of religion in Russia"
50,Walking around,"the mosque is picture perfect. what a beautiful building. in the sun light the outside shines. inside the mosque the chandelier grabs your eye. the bright blue, white and gold colours are stunning. we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. bring 3r per person for booties. headscarves available at the entrance. islamic museum was closed unfortunately which is my reason for deducting one point. we visited on a Tues and monday is usually the day places are closed."
51,Fabulous,"Given the relatively young age of this mosque, it is very beautiful. Make sure you go to the visitors gallery for the full feel of the place. I would imagine that Friday prayer times are very special, if you can time your visit."
52,Mosque,"We visited the mosque during our Kazan trip. We are from Malaysia( Islamic country) but this is the first time we visit a mosque. It's really a beautiful place. Girls, remember to bring along your headscarf during your trip to the mosque :)"
53,Wonderful,A must see location when visiting Kazan regardless of what religion you are. This is an absolutely stunning building architecturally whether it be from the outside or the inside and it certainly gives one an insight into the Islamic Religion.
54,Tour of mosque,Its a magical place; World Heritage Site. Needs more signage and information panels to aid English medium users like me. It was summer so it was colourful and alive with vendors and visitors
55,Amazing miracle Kul Sharif Mosque - مسجد شگفت انگیز کل شریف,"You don’t have to be Muslim to enjoy this mosque, it’s obvious that they work very hard to inform people about Islam. You can go up on the balcony and see where both the men and women pray, and then go down to the museum of Islamic Culture in the bottom. There is a small fee to get in, but it’s a wonderful experience. All throughout both the mosque itself and the museum are old Korans, art work, and artifacts that inform you about Islam. Women should be aware that you do have to cover your knees and head. If you don’t bring a scarf with you, they will provide one, and they’re pretty relaxed about it, so don’t worry. This is one of my personal favorite sites in Kazan!"
56,AMAZING,"This Mosque is ya far the best view Kazan has to offer, it's located in the Kremlin; therefore, you can see a few more things in just one trip, the thing I liked the most were the little selling stalls on the side, the have many souvenirs, of you am sure at least one anyone would like."
57,Absolutely Amazing,"It is a wonder in design, very beautiful, a jewel in the city"
58,First time in a mosque,Fantastic building situated inside Kazan’s Kremlin. Both- inside and outside is worth to see. Highly recomended!
59,Beautiful piece of architecture,A beautiful piece of architecture in the Kazan Kremlin. Our guide helped us better understand the basics of tradition as practiced in the mosque. I hope that its religious leaders keep on preaching tolerance and respect to others as they do today.
60,Amazing place,It was the most beautiful mosque I've seen(outside). Free entrance. Go to left or right  upstairs - nice vision! Downstair museum is small and main parts of it are books - 200rub.  Wasn't interesting for me
61,Beautiful and tourist friendly ,This mosque lies with the Kazan Kremlin and is well worth a visit. It is pretty spectacular and forms a key part of the very impressive Kazan Kremlin.
62,Fantastically Beautiful ,This mosque is beautiful both on the outside and the inside and kept up in excellent condition. This is a must see in Kazan.
63,Making Kazan skyline special,"I was thoroughly impressed by this mosque, and I have been to mosques in Istanbul, Abu Dhabi and Ashgabat so I definitely mean it!The interior is stunning with blue, gold and white. The mosque is visitor friendly and there are two tourist viewing platforms.The museum of Islamic history is very informative in the basement. I was especially impressed the museum respectfully displayed a Torah and a Bible also and emphasised the importance of these religious books.This is one site that should not be missed when visiting Kazan."
64,Not as big but very cool mosque!,"This is a must see place while in Kazán city!, there is a lot to learn from this place and its cultural understanding, its architecture is amazing!"
65,Good condition - Lacks wow factor ,"One of the most beautiful mosque that I visited, there is a museum in the ground floor where you can learn a lot of the history there"
66,Beautiful Mosque ,This really clean and beautiful mosques and in the Kazan city 🌇 people all respect each other which religion🙏🙏 they support.  Which is amazing 💕😍
67,"Remarkable place, have to see","Very beautiful mosque both inside and outside. Free entrance. It looks amazingly great in the evening when the backlights are turned on. There are also other places of interest just near the mosque - all in one place, in the city center."
68,Beautiful,"Good to visit and see how this Mosque was built and see the daily workinks of the Mosque, also the lovely grounds and great to visit during summer"
69,Must see...,It's one of the major landmarks in Kazan.  It looks great from far and close up.  There are also other historic structures nearby.
70,Beautiful place among Orthodox churches,Beautiful location. Incredible place to visit.We went back in the evening to see the lights which made it even more like a fairy tale location.
71,Interesting ,"Absolutely beatiful Mosque, recently built atop Kazan Kremlin where it dominates the city skyline.Gorgeous white walls with blue towers. It is immaculately clean and pristine and looks like it was opened only yesterday!Inside is very nice. You can climb up to a third floor observation hall to look at the mosques interior and you don't need to take off your shoes. You do need to cover legs and women tbeir legs, head and shoulders but they give you wraps to do that. Free to enter. There is an Islamic Museum downstairs but I didn't visit.There's a very grand plaza outside where you can get great photos. I dont know how anyone could visit Kazan and not cone to the Kul Sharif.m In a word - magnificent."
72,Beautiful ,"This mosque is large, stunning, over-the-top and worth a visit while at the Kazan Kremlin.  It is more about the architecture and decor than anything spiritual feeling.   Definitely walk up to the balcony where you see the interior of the mosque from up high.   Do not bother with going downstairs to the museum and paying to see some pages out of books or old coins.  Not worth it at all.  Head scarves like all the Russian tourist churches are provided for the women."
73,The most beautiful mosque,"This is located inside the Kazan Kremlin.  It is very beautiful but we didn't go inside,so I can't comment on the inside.  But you can visit this when you go to The Kremlin.  It is worth a visit."
74,Pleasing and surprising,The mosque is beautiful on the outside. Do not miss the opportunity to go inside and see the beauty within. Climb the stairs to the tourist balcony and admire the stained glass windows and Islamic calligraphy.
75,Architectural beauty,"a very nice mosque, big enough or large groups.women should wear head covers and long skirts, you have to pay 3 rubles for the plastic shoes cover or else you will have to carry your shoes inside the mosque.you can take pictures but I couldn't pray there. there were men praying but the women's part was closed and people there only understand Russian or Tatar so they couldn't understand me.there is a small museum in the underground floor where you can buy lots of stuff."
76,An outstanding mosque,"Completed in 2005 and formerly (I believe) the biggest Mosque in Russia, the Kul-Sharif Mosque is certainly worth a visit if you are in Kazan. Entry is free but you are required to pay 2 roubles for the some plastic shoe covers. The Mosque is truly breath taking and I recommend walking up to the viewing platform at the top of Mosque, where you can get a very good view of the ceiling."
77,The Kremlin precinct of Kazan. ,The Mosque is a beautiful sight to see. The area has a huge park-like scene where you can sit and enjoy the view of the Mosque as well as the city below.
78,"One of the most beautiful Mosques I have been to, and excellent museum",And it was special. From outside it is one of the most constructions I have seen. Inside I found it very nice.
79,A beautiful Mosque ,"That place was really amazing even despite of being very young (it was opened only in 2005). Everything was made to amaze the believers and usual visitors and to show that Islam is a bright and attractive religion.That is their website http://www.kul-sharif.com, it is going to be in English soon."
80,Family visit,"A wonderful modern mosque, beautifully designed and with a good sense of peace and respectfulness by visitors of all religions. The public entrance or foyer is a bit busy , but once you get out of that it's a must see."
81,Beautiful,l have been here a while ago. But lblike it to much. İt is very nice mosque. İf you are in kazan you must see it.
82,Impressive,Hundreds of visitors everyday. You will need 3 ruebles to purchase your plastic shoe coverings. The mosque is live so be respectfully quiet. Very narrow on stairs be careful.
83,Beautiful mosque ,"It is inside the Kazanski Kremlin complex.It can not be compared with other symbolic mosques around the world such as in Turkey, Balkans, North Africa, Middle East, etc. but as it is from few symbols of Muslims in Tatarstan therefor it has strong meaning.The building itself is not a mosque masterpiece design and not really old but when you are in Kremlin better to see it."
84,Perfect,"So much history, so much beauty!  I felt incredibly welcome. What a Beautiful Mosque. Be sure to climb Up to the Balcony to get a good view of this grandiose building.  A must see when visiting Kazan."
85,Beautiful Mosque,Free to go inside but better do it with a guide. Plenty of details on the walls and in every corner explaining the structure and history of the building. Stairs to the second floor are not easily visible (on the left side from the entrance). There is a museum of Islamic culture in the ground floor and a splendid souvenir store where they produce hand made items in front of you.
86,Perfect visit,"Very beautiful place, clean, bright. Friendly ppl around. Excellent view from the towers. We enjoyed being there"
87,İnteresting mosque,Kul Sharif - one of the most magnificent mosques.We were lucky to see golden sunset contrasted with brightly smaragd archs and minarets.
88,Interesting,"This is a very grand mosque with beautifully decorated details. There are multiple floors for praying, one for men, another one for women. You can see it from outside and inside. There are special people singing Koran throughout the whole day. Definitely a place to visit for a cultural education"
89,Very beautiful,It strikes your view the first time you see it. It's located on the hill so it can be seen from a distance. It is particularly beautiful at night time.
90,Beautiful place,"One of the most attractive mosques I ever seen and visit in whole world, be sure you'll never regret it."
91,Stunning building...,"Very impressive and fundamental to the attraction of Kazan, although it's  completely modern, no earlier than this century,  It is magnificent."
92,Strikingly beautiful,I have never seen such a beautiful Mosque before. I have been seeing image of this Mosque so many times but I never imagined I will be able to come this far to stand in front of this Mosque. It looks great with the blue sky behind because it's shining with white and blue. Go there with your camera to take good photos or else you will regret 😊A must visit place in Russia I must say. I would also suggest to spend a days or two in Kazan to know more about the city.
93,Beautiful Church,Entry is free to this beautiful mosque. As expected women need to have their head covered. Photos with no flash are allowed. You can go up stairs at either side to look down from the gallery. The windows and structure are stunning.
94,Very modern feeling mosque ,"If you've never been in a mosque and want to know what it feels like, this one won't help.It doesn't feel like a religious site at all - there's hoards of tourists; the mosque is literally crammed with people. I actually doubt if the building is actually used as a mosque or just as a pretty and touristy spot."
95,Best sight in Kazan,One of the most beautiful and impressive buildings I've ever seen! Wonderful illumination at night. I want to see it again and I will! There are many small stores with souvenirs.
96,New Large Mosque,"The mosque is very beautiful, worth seeing 100%. The whole Kremlin territory is nice, clean, with wc. A lot of souvenirs."
97,Beautiful ,funny how they build muslim church only after they got permission from putin to do so. Lots of people hanging around tructure
98,Modern ...,A must visit place Extremely amazing architecture and very spiritual You must visit kul sharif mosque if you are in Kazan
99,Must visit if you are in Kazan,"The most beautiful mosque which I saw In Russia, it is possible to see interrior from two balconies for tourists"
100,Beautiful,"I am a fan of religious architecture, so this is the building I came to Kazan to see. It does not disappoint. From the outside, the mosque is stunning, especially at night when it lights up gold and green. Climb the steps inside to look down on the place of worship from a balcony. Ladies, your hair must be covered. Babushkas inside will do it for you if you don't."
101,Beautiful Mosque,"Most Beautiful mosque I have seen till date , went for Jummah prayer , felt soo much at home , prople are so soft spoken here . After Prayer the Mosque was open for tourists .. the colours , the architecture is just too good. A must visit."
102,kul sharif mosque,We immensely enjoyed our visit to this beautiful mosque. As you enter you can see a lovely 3D model of the mosque slowly turning in a glass case. There is also a display of Qurans written in Arabic and Russian. There is a place on the second floor where you ascend a beautiful staircase to end up on a balcony overlooking the prayer place. It’s huge and beautiful. I don’t think that any visit to Kazan would be complete without seeing this marvel of architecture and place of peace.
103,Breathtaking,"Very nice mosque with modern style, in the middle of the Kremlin of Kazan. If you're lucky enouigh you'll be able to get in."
104,Magnificent ,"The Mosque is simply breath-taking with its blue dome. Visitors are allowed to go in and walk around the exhibition area (but before entering, the staff there will provide you with head scarf - for the women) You are welcomed by a mellifluous sound of an Al-hafiz reciting verse from the Quran. The interior of the mosque was astoundingly beautiful as well."
105,Wonderful,The nightly view in combination with the Kremlin is Stunning when looking at it from the Most Millennium Bridge. Bring a tripod for stunning pictures. The Wolga river and Kazanka river will give a stunning background around sunset.
106,Amazing inside.Such a hige place,Beautiful and well-preserved mosque in the city of Kazan. Make sure to pay it a visit when visiting Kazan.
107,Bene! ,"It is worth a trip up here in the evening just as the light is going to see it all lit up, it is a beautiful looking building"
108,Very beautiful,Beautiful mosque full of marble in the middle of the beautiful Kremlin. To be seen absolutely if you visit Kazan. Wonderful.
109,Spiritual center in Kazan,It is very beautiful from outside and good from inside. The shade of blue is amazing. I liked it. It is not that big.
110,Great building!,"This is a must visit place in kazan. Very beautiful and big mosque, every one are allowed but with proper dress code like any other religious place."
111,Design,With its many minarets this modern mosque stands out in Kazan's Kremlin als a symbol of the city'smulticultural background.
112,impressive,"far from middle east, different nations, but same religion and same God.  you must close your eyes and feel, where you are"
113,Beautiful building ,The Qul Sharif is a beautiful mosque in the heart of the Kremlin. It is brilliantly white with a beautiful shade of blue at its centre and on the towers. It's one of the most striking parts of the Kazan Skyline. Free to enter and you can go to a third floor platform to see the interior without removing your shoes. It has an Islamic Museum and an lovely plaza out front that makes for great pictures.
114,a must see !,"Beautiful mosque. Not to be missed in Kazan. Right inside Kremlin. Has balconies for tourists to see inside, Muslim culture museum. Typical of Tatar style of mosque architecture, different from Arab mosques. Loved it inside, nice from outside. If you visit in an inappropriate clothing, the covers are provided for free. Recommend to see and visit."
115,Incredible,"impressive building from the outside and surrounding, interesting visit on the inside as well. highly recommended"
116,Magnificent Mosque,"Very nice, you can walk around, even had an art exhibition.  Very pretty throughout. Watch out for guided groups who think they own the place."
117,Stunning mosque,"Beautiful enlightened Mosque, showing the islamitic grandeur in the Kazan Kremlin. Where various religions meet. Worthwhile the visit!"
118,One of the best mosques in the world ,This is one of the major sights of Kazan and it would really be a shame to miss it.  It is an incredibly beautiful building and for that alone it's worth the visit.  It is often packed and incredibly 'touristy' during the day but if you're visiting as a tourist...that shouldn't put you off!  You can look around the inside of the mosque and there is a fairly informative paid museum downstairs that you can go in to find out more about Islam in general and in the area.  All the information in the museum isn't necessarily very clear or the set up particularly cogent but it's a good introduction for anyone with little knowledge of the subject.  There are also plenty of objects of interest to peruse.
119,THE STAR OF THE KREMLIN,What an amazing construction! The colors are beautiful! On a warm bright spring day the bright blue roof of this mosque almost blends in wight he color of the sky! Definitely a great addition too the Kazan Kremlin!
120,A must see in Kazan ,"The mosque is very beautiful and very prominent in the Kremlin of Kazan. The mosque is a newer addition to the Kremlin. The inside has an Islam Museum which is ok. To the right or left are stairs to the balcony to see the inner part of the mosque, don't miss it.Kazan is very proud of the mix of the religions and culture visible in the city.Don't forget a head covering (women) and something to cover knees (this is for men and women)."
121,Stuningly Beautiful,"An historical mosque, with a long history of Kazan city, Inside, we can see the history, and people reading Al Quran"
122,A must see in Russia,Modern place with special design. feeling and amazing just to sit and listen the quietness of place.
123,Most Beautiful mosque I have seen till date,Impressive building set in beautiful grounds. Self directed tour with magnificent views over the town.
124,Beautiful Mosque,A cold and blustery day made the visit even more enjoyable. The interior is truly stunning and the view from the balcony is stunning.
125,looks good from the outside,Even more beautiful from outside rather than inside.Will be great to come there twice - at daytime and in the evening. It has nice lights in the night.
126,"Amazing place, a must see","Super crazy from outside, but from inside its not so much and museum is really really bad ... super boring and not interesting .."
127,Beautiful place,Fantastic place to visit built in the grounds of the Kremlin. A must to visit and enjoy the beautiful painted walls and ceilings. Accept the dress code required for entering the mosque.
128,"Must visit in Kazan ! Amazing, pays to go during the evening / night time.","The church is very beautiful. campus wide. There are many historical statues. From here you can see the beautiful city of Kazan. rivers, streams or buildings. You can come in the evening. I'm not sure I could go in but look outside very shimmering"
129,Unique sight! Hard to miss out one once in Kazan,"As has already been said, beautiful from inside and outside, morning and early evening light really flatters it. The mosque is magnificent and beautiful. The visit is for free, apart from 3rubles for shoe covers, you only pay for the museum of Islamic culture one floor below. Should you find yourself in Kazan Kremlin, this is a must see."
130,Magical and super clean,"Very nicely created mosque which on first entry gives an impression of only a toruistic building, but when you go upstairs to the blconey, the upper floor prayer floor opens up - fantastic colours, designs, wood work, glass work and much more; and then the basement opens up more surprises with exhibitions and digitalised quran, and much more"
131,Great,"breath taking, located inside the Kremlin and the beautiful Volga river in the background make this a perfect spot for pictures and picture enthusiasts. The blue color on the Mosque blend nicely with the sky and create a gorgeous image worth staring at for hours."
132,Visit all the floors,Certainly worth a visit. It's very new but built and designed with a nice touch. Make a good shot of the mosque from the tower on the city wall.
133,It's pearl of Kazan Kremlin ,"It’s beautiful, this all I can say. You can visit without paying nothing, but to visit the museum you need to pay around 100 rubles. All the complex - Kremlin and others builds around is nice to visit to."
134,Beautiful Mosque,the most wonderful place to visit! expesuly when your on vaction! but it is kind of quite in my apenin!
135,Amazing ,"The mosque is absolutely worth to see, it's a good idea to visit it in the evening also, it looks different, than in the daylight. I also recommend the Museum of Islam. The entry is free to the mosque. At the entry women can take there a headscarf if they don't have one."
136,A stunning beautiful mosque,"As photographer, I enjoyed every angle of the building, and was hunting for even better shots during sun rise and sun set... It is visible from many parts of the city, and it's a nice spot to visit. You can go inside and go up the stairs where people pray. Downstairs has a few mini shops and a museum I believe. Fine place to visit, and definite must to take pictures of."
137,Beautiful!,If you are in Kazan you need to go and see this Mosque. You dont have to be Muslim! Islamic art meets with modern art. There is the small museum under the mosque and inside is very nice too. Higlhy recommended.
138,A definite must in Kazan ,"Difficult to describe the place with only words. You have to be there. It is impressive. And the most beautiful is the mix of religions and people around this place. I have seen people from many origin and different religions visiting the Mosque without judging each other whatever the way they were dressed, neither the language they were talking, nor the God they were praying."
139,"Marvellous architecture, zenith of diversity",Beautiful inside and out. They gave us a scarf to cover our heads. That was very thoughtful. The people that work there were very friendly.
140,Nice architecture and decoration inside,When I first see that blue-white mosque I think that I was in the middle of a story book! It was an afternoon when I first see it but after that I saw the mosque in the night I fell in love again!
141,Nicest building in Kazan ,"You can't like everything you see when you travel and I felt the Kul Sharif was rather too clinical and without any atmosphere.I am a great fan of Islamic architecture, but this just did not do it for me, as many of the modern mosques in the Middle East and Central Asia have done."
142,Beautiful,Excellent place to be at Kazan Kremlin. Quite scenic and photogenic. You can spend a full day with family at Kremlin and places around it.
143,Beautiful mosque,One of the most beautiful and impressive place in Kazan. In terms of architecture and the interior design. Very difficult to describe - don't miss - JUST VISIT AND TAKE A LOOK !
144,Modern but beautiful ,"walk around the place in the day and the night, its gorgeous. you can walk inside if you cover your head and be moderately dressed"
145,Beautiful,"Really beautiful to see from the observatory floor, but feels super modern. Still worth a visit, for sure."
146,Very interesting,"You feel you're in a fairytale, it's amazingly beautiful. The sunset, the beautiful peaceful atmosphere. We where there late at night and we felt very safe (make sure u rug up) -1 degree one night I'd recommend anyone that's going to Russia make Kazan a 'must do' u wont regret it"
147,Beautiful mosque!,"A a slamic region this mosque represent a lot for russian tartar who´s nation is now undergoing a cultural revolution, worth a visit"
148,Beautiful graceful religious place,Very interesting Mosque and the interface between Christianity and Islam in central Europe. The historical events in this region can be better appreciated by visiting the Mosque
149,As impressive in person as it is in pictures,to see a different culture as a fist hand experience widened ones knowledge and understanding of  the world
150,Superb,"Very beautiful Mosque, it is located inside The Kremlin and its easily the most visited of all the touristic buildings of the city. There is a dress code in order to be able to go inside it."
151,Defiantly worth a visit,"Situated on top of Kazan's white Kremlin, with its blue and white slim architecture it is extremely beautiful building. Very pitoresque, visible from far away, even from the plane, in my opinion the most beautiful mosques (outside) which I have ever seen (and I have seen many)."
152,Wow! ,"Located inside Kremlin, impressive architecture, situated next to the Cathedral. The small stores nearby house nice stuff."
153,Kul Sharif Mosque in the Kazan Kremlin,"This huge mosque is located in the Kazan Kremlin, and is perhaps the most beautiful structure in the Kremlin complex.  Visitors can go inside, photographs allowed.  There are some dress rules, but that is to be expected, as this is a place of worship.  Information for history buffs: It is NOT the original, but a new construction, built in the 1990's and inaugurated in 2005.  The original was destroyed by Ivan the Terrible.  So, in that sense, it is not an ancient monument, but still worth visiting!  You need to climb a fairly narrow staircase to reach the upper level.  Very photogenic!  Wikipedia has an interesting write-up on it, this should be minimum reading for history buffs before going."
154,Wow,This place is symbol of Kazan. If you travel to city you must see it. Easy air structure involving a sight when you go to the Kazan Kremlin. At night the mosque building has very beautiful illumination
155,Mystic,This is a must-go in Kazan. Lies within the walls of Kazan Kremlin. Take a short look in the basement where you can find cultural stuff about the Islamic history in Russia.
156,Beautiful architechture,"Firstly, mosques are rarely seen in Russia. Then, at the time of writing, there are not many Singaporeans who have visited Russia nor are they familiar with Russia, let alone visit the city of Kazan. Nevertheless, I believe this will change in time to come. Whenever I share my photos with friends about visiting Russia, I will also include a picture of this place - the Kul’Sharif Mosque. Kazan is a major city in the republic of Tatarstan and I must say, together with the Kazan Kremlin and other major landmarks such as the Suyumbikye Tower can be considered the symbols of Kazan. This mosque is not as big and grand as the Blue Mosque of Istanbul, Turkey. Nevertheless, one does not need to always be big and grand in order to stand out.The Qul Sharif mosque is big, spacious and modern( rebuilt in 2005 as a replacement to the original Kul Sharif mosque which was built almost 500years ago. It has its own beauty in the interior design and architecture. Inside the mosque, one can go up to the upper floor where you can have a nice view of the inside of the mosque. As with many religious sites, religious customs have to be followed but its good to know that there’s no major restrictions in camera use.All in all, if you are visiting the Kazan Kremlin, I would recommend coming inside this mosque. Recommended!"
157,Amazing Mosque!,"It is one of the major sights of Kazan and worth to see. It is huge and beautiful, women are not allowed to show sking, they must wear headscarf."
158,A must see!!!,This mosque was built less than 20 ago inside the Kazan city Kremlin. It is obvious from a long distance with a striking contrast from its blue and white exterior. I has no appeal to me but it might to you.
159,Perfect photo taking at night,"This is the symbol of the new Kazan style tolerant Islam. Brand new, pompous, white marble, expensive lighting, it is a nice object for tourists. It would be even better during the coming years, I think."
160,Modern mosque in ancient Kremlin,We really enjoyed visiting this beautiful place. The view from the balcony was excellent. We also saw it at night that was also very photogenic.
161,Seen better.,The visit was very well worth it . It was very interesting looking at the interior of the masjed and i would definitely visit it next time . It has a small art gallery and a museum which was marvelous. This is one of the most unique mosques I have ever been too.
162,Puzzling.,Very beautiful both in summer and in winter.  Definitely must see in Kazan.  You can go inside even if you are not a muslim.
163,The Kul Sharif Mosque in Kazan,The Qul Sharif mosque is situated within the Kazan Kremlin. Stunning architecture. It is required that visitors comply with modest cloths. Woman should wear a headscarf and men long trousers. Would definitely recommend a visit to the mosque.
164,The most attractive place in Kazan,"When visiting the Kazan Kremlin you will see the Kul Sharif (Qolsarif) Mosque with its beautiful white and blue exterior, originally built in the 16th century and destroyed by Ivan the Terrible in 1552. We were told by our tour guide that the new mosque, opened in 2005, could accommodate 6,000 worshipers--and she added it was a good thing we had not come on Friday.  Our group of both men and women stood on the balcony looking down onto the floor where only men could pray; some were troubled."
165,Absolutely stunning!,a unique mosque in the kremlin of kazanthe visit there is must can see the other islam as well and enjoy the spirit
166,The beautiful mosque,I vist the mosque with my wife. İt was nice and intersting. definetly people should visit in the kazan
167,so specific,"A must see place, really beautiful, located on the territory of the Kazan Kremlin. The Kul Sharif Mosque is one of the largest mosques. I highly recommend to visit"
168,Definitely need to see!,"... both outside and in. Opulent, dramatic, atmospheric. Climb to the viewing platform inside if you are able, the views are breathtaking."
169,"Touch the East, feel the beauty.",Interesting museum. Mosque is really beautiful. Very friendly and helpful people. Women are not allowed to show skin
170,AMAZING AND SO BEAUTIFUL,During the night has a great presence and beauty !! Illumination is great! Everybody must visit this great mosque. Best I have ever seen!
171,Great views by Night,Beautiful mosque :) As a visitor you can go on the second floor. Take something with you to cover your head.
172,Kul Sharif Mosque,The insides are accessible to all and there are beautiful motifs on the walls. there is a museum on the basement and you can also climb upstairs.
173,Interesting,The main aim of our visiting Kremlin in Kazan was this building. We expected more. The Moscque has very big wood external doors with nice wood crafting. Inside is empy. There is no possibility to pay for audio gude so we only can  have working  to different lewels without undestanding means otherwise detail of interior.
174,Very nice,"Beautiful mosque interior is amazing , I highly recommend must visit this place in Kazan you will feel relax yourself with beautiful views"
175,Very beautiful mosque!,Located in the Kazan Kremlin complex the Kul Sharif Mosque is stunningly beautiful both during the day and at night when it is lit up.  A must see.
176,Amazing serene blue-dome mosque,"Charming. Beautiful colors, very kind persons who guide you. Clean and exceptional. Day and night two different view."
177,The bright star of Kazan,"Probablyy the number 1 landmark symbol of Kazan. A beautiful and sublime building. See it at dusk, floodlit and amazing."
178,You can't go to Kazan without visiting,"When you have time, please visit Kazan, especially this beautiful Kul Sharif Mosque. At the heart of Kazan Kremlin, the renovated Kul Sharif Mosque stood close by to Annunciation Cathedral. There are museum and areas for non Moslem. The interior is magnificent. It is quite different from the architecture of the mosques in Moscow or St Petersburg. There is no entrance fee, except for the museum downstairs. However, for praying, the mosque is closed after 18:00, so come early. At night, the mosque lightened up brightly that you can see it from afar."
179,Masterpiece,It is literally one of the most amazing things I ever saw in my life! I was there on a business trip in May 2008 and had some time during the day to visit this mosque. It is very nice both on the outside as on the inside. And it is even more amazing in the evening with all these beautiful colors! To be honest I still remember this mosque as if I just saw it. Left a strong impression.
180,"No, not in Turkey, In Kazan !!","The mosque where reading sacred Koran never stops, and a pray are voiced 24 hours. The is special entrance for tourists, but better to come with a guide to understand all tiny details about the mosque and muslim religion. The building itself is impressive as just you see it. It was build recently and the structure and view was based on the descriptions of the first original mosque which was destroyed within the battle to conquer Kazan.  Some of scientists consider that the St Basil Cathedral in Moscow has some similarities with the original Kazan mosque. So try to find them!"
181,Beautiful sight seeing,"The stunning Kul Sharif Masjid inside Kazan's Kremlin, was built to replace the fabled masjid of the Kazan Khanate, which was destroyed by Ivan the Terrible in 1552. It is the largest masjid in Europe outside of Turkey. The original masjid had eight minarets and some scholars speculate that architectural elements of the mosque can be seen in  St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow (8 minarets & a central cupola, atypical in Russian architecture). The interior is just breathtaking. Zoom in to see the splendour of the chandelier in the third interior picture. They switched it on for us but it was too blinding to photograph well."
182,Spectacular and spiritual,"A beautiful mosque, you can't miss it as you approach the kremlin. If you're a woman, make sure every strand of your hair is covered. There are stairs on either side inside, leading to designated tourist balconies so you can see the interior prayer area."
183,Very very touristy,"she is beautiful and I admire her. best kremlin out of Nizhny Novgorod and Vladimir. Don't delay, Kul Sharif Today!"
184,Kul Sharif Mosque,"A must see inside the kremlin, or for a photo op. The 1st building to see is the Jewish mosque in Kazan showing the diversity of religions.The mosque is colourful and shaped like 2 parts.There is a line of shops outside, selling small souvenirs.Inside be warned that the stairs up to the viewing deck is really tight and hard to have one person go up and another coming down."
185,Bizzare but intresting,"Really good place lies in centre of city,we can museum inside the mosque and there is a special balcony for tourists inside the mosque"
186,Shiny and big,"I had a few minutes free before heading to the airport so I visited the area around the White Kremlin and stepped inside the Kul Sharif Mosque. I was only inside for maybe 20 minutes and did not have a guide or an audio tour to educate me about the mosque’s history. Instead, I was limited to the knowledge of a young Kazanian (is that a real word?) friend who accompanied me on the trip inside. While I might not suggest visiting just the mosque by itself one should probably factor in 20-30 minutes of time when planning their day of site seeing at the White Kremlin complex.  I did find the mosque’s modern approach to be a welcome change from the usual ancient buildings that I visit on these trips and honestly, it is a good thing for non-Muslims such as myself to visit other peoples places of worship when afforded an opportunity IMHO. It was very welcoming. Hope this helps someone make that choice."
187,Must do,One of the most beautiful mosque in Tatarstan Republic and Russia too. I recommend to visit mosque and to know more beautiful things about really Islam culture.
188,"Stunning, breathtaking","Recently rebuilt on the site of the original Mosque, the Kul Sharif Mosque is an impressive site both externally and internally."
189,So so,very wonderful place near kazan kremlin with beautiful view of volga river.entrance is free but women need cover to go in.
190,I love this beautiful mosque,Great setting and foresight - breathtaking views across to the river and ambiance that teleports you ... !
191,excellent experience,Due to the large tourist groups you can only goto a viewing gallery. However there is a great museum of Islam at the bottom which tells the story of Islam in Russia. I have a video on my youtube channel [departures1]
192,Stunning mosque,"The mosque is located in the square wins a spectacular architecture, definitely a must see. Square of the mosque is extremely clean and has a great view"
193,Central Mosque in Kazan',"Dropping by on a winter evening, it was a stunning experience being able to enter and experience the overwhelming atmosphere of this great mosque. Walking through the Kazan Kremlin the mosque is a unique landmark.  Nicely lit it attracts attention from far away. An absolute must see"
194,Brand new,"Despite the queue on the stairs towards the vestibule of the mosque, it is absolutely worth a visit both upstairs and downstairs. It gives the visitor an overwhelming experience.Worth reading about it before you go - not much information on the spot. Or take the audio guide for 300 rubels at the entrance to get to know more about it.Beautiful interior and exterior."
195,Interesting Mosque in Kazan,The mosque are very well decorated and it still function as mosque on day-to-day basis. There is an islamic museum in it that tells more about Islam which i think is very good.
196,Just ok,Nice place....where you can explore more about islamic culture in Kazan.....quite and nice from inside as well as from outside....entrance is free you will only need to pay 3 rubles for shoes cover ..... but you don't have to spent long time there....one and a half hour is enough
197,Stunning,Excellent preservation from the old days. There is a Visitor's Balcony and a guide who spoke English to explain on its historical heritage.
198,Very impressive place,"It is said that in the XVIth century there was a mosque in this same place that was named after its last Imam, Qol Sharif, who died with other people in trying to defend the building to be destroyed, which finally happened that same century. After many, many years, the temple was rebuilt late in the XXth century. In year 2005 this great monument was finally opened as it is known today. Its architectural line is impressive, and the peaceful room for prayers is great, too. Tourists, with the corresponding dress code, can also access the interior through a couple of stairways. Inside there is also a museum of Islam, which is nice, but I think signs in English could help foreigners to understand what is on exhibition, even more, when a good part of the exhibit is written documents. Well worth to visit this complex."
199,A wonderful visit to Kul Sharif Mosque,"Kul Sharif Masjid is symbol of Kazan and Tatarstan. Entrance is free, so don’t believe to Taxi drivers and tour guys that you need to pay entrance in Kazan Kremlin. Free of charge"
200,Sorry to be negative but.....,This mosque is absolutly amazing and its so worth visitingAt night the mosque looks very beautifulInside there is a person who sells some art designs carry some cash There is a small a gallery with beautiful paintings worth visiting
201,Modern mosque,"must see if you come to Kazan. Must cover your head and shoulders but they have covering available at door which are clean,"
202,great view,"This was the first time I had ever been in a mosque.  Frankly, I was a little nervous, considering the political situation in the world.  It was absolutely beautiful inside. Our guide was great and did a great job explaining everything and answering all our questions."
203,What a site!,"This imposing edifice dominates the skyline anywhere you are standing by either the Kama or Volga rivers. Spectacularly gorgeous both inside and out, you are viewing a piece of history, one of many pieces of history inside the Kazan Kremlin."
204,Monumental Building,"... in a historical surrounding. It is really up to each individual to like it or not, without hurting religious feelings."
205,Amazing,"Very beautiful mosque. Open until 7 pm. You need to cover ur naked body parts to enter and cover ur head if you are a woman. If you are not sure about ur gender, do not enter that at all."
206,Most Attractive Mosque Ever,Amazing place must to visit ..!! I got in love with Kazan ...the church it's in the middle of the city ... with a view which is incomparable...!!!
207,A beauty,Kul sharif Mosque at Kazan Kremlin one of beautiful place at Kazan was destroy and build Again 2005 .
208,"Wow, it is amazing!",At the Kazan Kremlin two worlds are meeting: islamic and orthodox christian. The islamic 🕌 has an open balcony with a spectacular view.
209,must see,"I was on a business trip in Kazan and had some time to walk around on a Monday morning. Of course, all the museums in Kremilin were closed, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover the mosque was open to tourists. It is a beautiful building on the outside, with its turquoise domes and minarets, but on the inside... oh my! When I reached the top by the narrow spiral stair and saw the ceiling of the dome I literally stopped motionless. Rich, beautiful colors in every shade of blue, white carvings as if made of lace, colorful stained glass for the inner windows - which is very unusual for a mosque. And such a profound sense of peace and quietness too. One of the best places I've ever been to.Come during a non-rush time if you can so that you can enjoy the site undisturbed. To all ladies out there, wear pants or a longer skirt covering the knees, and you can pick a headscarf there to cover your head for free."
210,Awesome,Kazan Kremlin is the most ancient and beautiful place of interest in Kazan. The orthodox church of Anunciation was built in the middle of the 16th century. It stands not fsr from the mosque Kul Sherif constructed in the 21 century. It is terrific place!
211,Striking!,"I live here, in Kazan, and, of course, I'm proud of living in a city having such a beautiful mosque. This is really something worth to be seen."
212,Lacks the spirit,"I'll start with bad: the entrance fee shoe!No toilet! Toilet has a surcharge in a nearby building! Is it worthy of such a beautiful mosque?The mosque itself is large, airy, beautiful, worthy, if not above, the 5 points!"
213,Maybe the world's most beautiful mosque,I been here twice and both times I enjoyed the beauty of the mosk. If you are planning to visit Kazan this mosk should be on your list to do.
214,Beautiful mosque,A must in Kazán Beautiful and sober have to go up the staircaseDelighted with stained glass windows
215,a beautiful sight out and in,"Impressive building of what stone inside Kremlin walls can be seen from long distance and definitely forms skyline of Kazan City. The Mosque is acting and open for tourists. This is Islamic spiritual center in the city. The interior is very impressive also. Visiting tourists can be admitted to the balconies inside mosque. There were two expositions in lower levels while we were visiting Kul Sharif. Admission to the mosque is free, but tickets are required for expositions, although the price is quite symbolic and affordable. One of the exposition was dedicated to history of Islam. Respectful attire is required when visiting this spiritual place. Visiting women are expected to cover head when entering mosque."
216,Currently closed to the public,"very beautifull mosk on the out and inside, go and see for yourselve.note: for woman: they should dress with skirt or dress and keep shoulders and head covered!special balcony for visitors, so you can see all inside!"
217,Only Symbol of Muslim,"How can one visit Kazan and skip the walk through Kazan Kremlin? Please don't be a fool and go there. The entry is free and you start feeling history beneath your feet even on the walk up to the entry when stepping on the road made of huge rocks. The mosque is beautiful and very picturesque. We went through the Kremlin on different occasions and most beautiful views happen at the time of sunset, between 7:30 and 8:30, at least during this time of the year."
218,Like a place from a fairytail,"...definitely worth seeing.. gorgeous mosque...inside and outside...at night , the lights add the glamorous look ... and you can see the city since it's on top of the hill....."
219,Great Mosque,"We had just come off an overnight train from Nizhny Novgorod and feeling somewhat worse for wear and if honest, a bit jaded from over a week of sightseeing. then we arrived at the Kremlin and saw this most beautiful mosque!  suddenly all the cameras were out again and we couldn't help snapping away at the different angles of this mosque.  when we went in, a service was going on and it was just mesmerising listening to the recital of the Quran.  definitely worth a visit"
220,"Is new, modern, big and interesting","At the End of the Baumana street, when you passed the Musa Jalil statue, then in you can find the front of you Kul Sharif Mosque and Kremlin.Any time you can visit this historical place, but I suggest you will be there at sunset, then you believe me, why am I said ""Amazing miracle Kul Sharif Mosque"".It is a hardship to explain, Just Imaging you are on the highest hill one side of you beautiful blue Volga river and the other side you can find the miracle sunset including yellow, orange and red light and of course the Withe-Blue mosque in front of you.This time is the exact time, you should take some photo.در آخر خیابان بومان بعد ازاینکه از مجسمه موسی جلیل گذشتید می توانید در مقابلتان موحوطه کرملین و مسجد کل شریف را مشاهده کنید.برای دیدن این محل زیبا هر ساعتی از روز می توانید بروید، اما پیشنها من به شما هنگام غروب هستش و بعدش شما متوجه می شوید که چرا این مسجد و محل رو سحرانگیز گفتم.توصیف کردنش سخته، اما تصور کنید در بالاترین نقطه تپه هستید و در یک سمت رود آبی و زیبای ولگا و در طرف دیگه غروب خورشید با رنگهای جادویی زرد و نارنجی و قرمز و البته در مقابل شما مسجد سفید و آبی قرار داره.این دقیقا وقتی هستش که شما باید اونجا باشید و عکس بگیرید."
221,Kazan`s spirits,"If you want to experience this jaw dropping moments while you’re here in Kazan, I strongly  recommend to visit this gigantic beautiful mosque. It’s a walkable distance from bauman street and kremlin. It’s really a best spot for picture taking and while relaxing esp during sunrise, sunset and if the weather is gloomy as you will get a different kind of experience."
222,If you are in the kremlin go in here.,I must confess that I'm not quite keen on architecture ( or art as matter of fact)  but it's impossible not to admire how majestic the khul sharif mosque is. It's located inside the Kremlin so it goes together with a wonderful tour around the fortress.
223,Incredible workmanship,"The Eiffel Tower in Paris, The Colosseum in Rome, The Pyramids in Egypt, etc.. and The Kul Sharif .. now you have seen it all !The most remarkable Tatar mosque with amazing acoustics. Amazing during the daylight, and breathtaking in the night."
