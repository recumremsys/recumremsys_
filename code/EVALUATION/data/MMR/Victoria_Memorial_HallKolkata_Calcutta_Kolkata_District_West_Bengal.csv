A must place to visit although the entry fee is 30rupees for Indians but 500rupees for us foreigners. Racial discrimination that would not be tolerated in UK. Did not detract from my enjoyment at being there.

10,Superb collection!,Bright marble celebration of the British Raj with statues of all the main players of the late 19th and early 20th century.  A great experience inside and out.
11,A beautiful piece of architecture,"A wonderful monument of British India. The Victoria Memorial is a large marble building in Kolkata, which was built between 1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria (1819–1901) and is now a museum. In January 1901, on the death of Queen Victoria, The 1st Baron Curzon of Kedleston (later created The 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston), the then Viceroy of India, suggested the creation of a fitting memorial. Lord Curzon proposed the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens. The Prince of Wales, later King George V, laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906, and it was formally opened to the public in 1921.      It is currently a grand museum. From perfectly preserved and maintained in excellent condition"

There are free hourly guided tours for the museum inside, where you might be pleasantly surprised by the Indian and Western paintings and memorabilia.

13,Most Evident Remnants of The Colonial Past,This place are so beautiful. This Place Based On Queen Victoria Memories. Here Is Queen Victoria's Museum..
14,Beautiful Structure worth Visiting,"Victoria Memorial needs no introduction. Built during the British Raj, this museum is a must visit place in the City of Joy. The lush greeneries around the place and the adjacent Maidaan area is absolutely mesmerizing"
15,Victoria Memorial Hall,The Victoria Memorial hall in Kolkata is perhaps the grandest sign of the British Raj. The building itself is imposing and majestic in well laid out spacious grounds. The many interesting displays and galleries in the building are also a well maintained and interesting.
16,amazing plsce,Place worth to visit. Monument of Self-importance and Loyalty to the Queen. Build by Indian for British.  Worth to stay couple of hours with a good camera. Tickets for foreigners are much much more than RS 20-30.
17,"Make sure you  have time, if you are really interested in History.","More than 100 years old, huge building to honor  queen Victoria. Even London doesn’t have done this. The Indian blue collars made it , but only statues of white British occupiers in and around the beautiful building, a must do when you are here, locals 30 rupees and old colonials like me 500....!The exhibition about the history is full of neglected paintings etc. They have to take more care about that. Otherwise this heritage will disappear slowly. The garden around it is nice and all mainly indian visitors enjoyed and made selfie after selfie.The main question which British intellectual decided to build this , because of Victoria in Kolkata to impress or / and insult the locals.Who paid for this ?"
18,Very nice gardens,"Superb Remains of a beautiful remains of Victoria who never visited Kolkata, erstwhile Calcutta. Must visit for anyone who visits Kolkata."
19,Incredible,"Built in early nineteenth century in memory of Queen Victoria after her death is perhaps the most popular structure in Kolkata. The marble structure combines variety of architecture styles like Indian & British along with touch of Egyptian, Venetian & Mughal.  A tour of building is very educative as you get glimpses of British colonial ruled period.The white marble structure reflects city’s colonial past."
20,Love this building,"This magnificent piece of architecture was built for Queen Victoria's visit to Calcutta, whist it was the Capital of British India. She stayed in it for one night only.No matter what your view on colonialism are (mine are definitely not in favour of!) a visit to this magnificent monument that is now a museum's a must. Its very much an active place - people use the gardens for morning runs and yoga and walks- and as such is just a tad grimy. Visit it anyway. You won't be disappointed."
21,Very good place to visit in winter.,What an amazing structure beautifully preserved. Built in memory of Queen Victoria. The clouds that visit this monument yearly have not detracted from its beauty. At all angles around the building you are presented with another amazing sight.
22,It was a nice walk with some amazing historical reading.,Victoria memorial is of the greatest attraction of Kolkata city .It aws built by Lord Carzon to commemorate the 25 years rule of Indian by her Majest Queen Victoria. The building is 338x 228 feet with 184 feet height . It is made of Markana marble . The buildin is located at the centre of huge garden with lakes and flowers .Inside there are 25 gallaries .
23,Day Tour,Some time with Queen Victoria's residence. Its a museum now and its definitely worthy to visit. Light and sound show available around evening which is also quite amazing.
24,Historic,"Had a splendid experience walking around the monument and learning about it's construction, the British era and the history of India between 1700s and 1950. The monument is grand and surrounded by beautiful lakes with some amazing Flora and Fauna. We also spent some time through…"
25,Must visit ,This grand monument to Queen Victoria is a beautiful building in Kolkata. The gardens surrounding the building are also lovely. Inside is a mish mash of museum type displays and artwork.  The artwork is not my style but locals were snapping photos all round.  The building is huge and really lovely~ a white beacon amidst the chaos outside.Entry cost 500 rupees.
26,Awesome staff,Amazing museum displaying history of British Raj in India. I wish my school teacher had taken us here to teach history lessons! Make sure you get free tour guide. Guided tour is available every hour.
27,Place wort to visit,Very interesting sight to visit with lots of galleries. Beautiful gardens as well. A memorial built for Queen Victoria 
28,good place for morning and evening walk.,A must visit for any Traveller to Kolkata. It has treasures from the British Raj which cannot be seen elsewhere. The place is well maintained and under surveillance. The art collection was amazing and the statues of Queen Victoria and other British Viceroy's of India were grand.There is a buggy( horse carriage) ride available outside the place...it's not too expensive and was fun to do.
29,"Replica of Love, Lover's paradise",The Victoria Memorial is the iconic architectural heritage of Kolkata. Certainly a must-visit if you are on your maiden visit to Kolkata. There is ample greenery and open spaces. However the memorial itself leaves you feeling that it could have been preserved better.
30,Magnificent. Majestic. ,"Think of Kolkata, think of Victoria!!!It is a very famous historical monument of Kolkata. Word of caution - carry a water bottle as a long walk.."
31,A must visit in Kolkata,The pride of Kolkata is Victoria Memorial Hall.The atmosphere inside is like a touch of the mind.This Victoria Memorial Hall is within a few hundred bighas of land.Here you will see all the historical things.By looking at them you can find out a lot of history.
32,Fabulous building at great at night. ,"A trip to this monument will takes us back into  the History of the pre British era. The building is majestically designed in symmetrical fashion and looks beautiful. The sprawling lawns are an added delight. Illumination of the building added variety to my visit.  To my disappointment (in Dec 2019), the Queens Hall was closed for renovations, & thus to that extent I wasn't to delighted. The Kolkata Police band was a pleasant surprise ( which we are informed play out on Sundays ).I could have rated the experience very good but  for the fact I couldn't go to the museum."
33,Superb place for adults as well as children,It’s a beautiful structure at the heart of Kolkata which is reminiscent of the British heritage that was once present in this region. The visit is worthwhile but the tour is a bit short.
34,Great place ,This is the most famous attraction in Kolkata. There is museum in the building with statues of Queen Victoria and others. The architecture is brilliant. There are gardens all around the campus. Bad part is no good food options and that too it is available only after 1 pm. Atleast they should sell cool drinks to the customers before 1 pm. It is delight for photographers as they get to shot some stunning photos from various angles. There is an arch at the entrance.
35,"Not just another museum, a masterpiece of history!","Good place to visit and see different types of historical weapons, museum and queen victoria & the inside view of the palace is unique u have ever seen. People come here from different places to visit and experience it."
36,VICTORIA MEMORIAL,You can get the feel of Old Calcutta under British Rule. Memorabilia of many great person's are on show...Beware of Pickpocketears....
37,Victorian Charm,"Victoria Memorial Hall. The architecture is really good. Very good museum with a variety of swords and guns for display. Cleanliness needs to be improved. The green park outside the Hall is good. But the water collection was very dirty. Further, its better to avoid taking the kids to the Park as its a lovers paradise"
38,European Architecture in Kolkata,The Victoria memorial has multiple things in the museum which is worth visiting and adoring. It is worth visiting.
39,A wonderful monument of British India.,"Calcutta and Victoria Memorial are synomous with each other. Having passed the monument umpteen times on my previous visits to Calcutta, being high on the tourist list, i decided to visit the Museum this time though with mixed feelings- ""A building made by the British for the British""- I asked myself do i really want to visit this instead of the Indian Museum?? I'm glad i went as it gave a better understanding of the history of Calcutta, the city of my birth-pictures and accompanying writeups were well detailed"
40,History,"Best palace to visit in Kolkata. It is located near park Street . It has a good history about the British time period and many old instruments, photos , artifacts are there which give you feel like you are in the period of 1800s. Nice place to visit . Sunday it is closed 😂"
41,A marvellous monument to British imperialism,I visited here last month and enjoyed watching Victoria Hall and gardens spread over acres of land in kolkata
42,Marble Building,Victoria Memorial hall is an old charm. Their gardens are well maintained. I do not feel Grandeur while visiting inside Main hall. Public management process is not too efficient. Items on display are not properly maintained. I am not very much satisfied with its up keep.
43,Stunning building,"The most iconic monument of Kolkata, Victoria Memorial is known for its immaculately maintained lawns and gardens which attract locals and tourists alike. Check out the rotating fairy on top of the dome."
44,Nice place for Visit,"It seems like no trip to Calcutta is complete without a visit to the Victoria Memorial. I was blown away by the experience there, actually, not merely because of the building itself, but what's inside it. The exhibits there tell a fascinating story about Calcutta herself and the role of the British when they arrived."
45,Not much things to see,it's a decent place to relive the colonial past when Kolkata was a great centre for trade and also had considerable political influence
46,Heart of Kolkata,One of the legacy of the British empire that is still a must see for any visitor to Kolkata. Imposing structure very good for Photo Ops.
47,beautiful architecture and colonial style ,"Since I live in Kolkata, I've visited the Victoria Memorial many times:with friends, family and also my journalism students, and each time was enjoyable and informative. In Kolkata, visiting the Victoria Memorial is a must-do outing. It's the best place to check our during the autumn - winter months (November - February). Check for the timings when it remains open from early morning till evening. Entry tickets are reasonably priced. It has lush open lawns and gardens to walk around, a museum and art gallery inside, replete with paintings, statues and memorabilia dating to British Colonial times. Victoria Memorial was constructed to commemorate Queen Victoria (1819–1901). Built of white marble, it holds iconic stature in Kolkata, West Bengal, and was built between 1906 and 1921. Some important legal documents are on display inside the gallery; for instance the one announcing the change in British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi.  Thousands throng the premises in winter months and sit around the large water body that is surrounded by lush trees and plants. The large imposing statue of Queen Victoria in the front adds its own aura. At night, the entire marble structure becomes even more enticing when blue lighting adds an ethereal glow. Not just visitors, locals also enjoy the ambience and come in droves, with family and friends to spend some 'fun time' here."
48,Must visit monument,"It is a white marble monument; looking at it, Taj Mahal comes to your mind instantly.  But this is a really imposing structure.  Once you are inside the sheer height is awe-inspiring.There is a sprawling garden all around.  Over all a nice place to spend time."
49,Victoria Memorial,To identify city of Joy Kolkata this unique memorial is the symbol of this city.An open space for the visitors to enjoy the winter during sun light.
50,A sight that has to be seen.,Well worth a visit to this ‘Taj of the Raj’Beautiful gardens and such an impressive monument. Museum inside also has a great exhibition.
51,Can be better maintained,Victoria Memorial is a monument of British style It is Very crowdy particularly on Local Holidays. But it will be very helpful to understand the value and significance of this place if somebody has some knowledge of Modern Indian History. One of the important places in Kolkata to visit.
52,Worth a second visit,"Victoria Memorial is a landmark monument of the city of Kolkata. A small but wonderful museum inside, it boasts of lush green gardens outside the magnificent building. A favourite place for joggers and young couples, it attracts all kinds of crowd. With new Programme Consultant in place, some amazing events are being hosted here most of the time.Being an artist , I have had the privilege to perform at one of the quadrangles of the monument.A must visit for the tourists."
53,Historic visit,A place to relive Calcutta when it was the captial of India. The place is very beautiful both from inside and outside. There's a museum inside the Hall with historical artefacts. You should visit if you are in Kolkata. One should know the history of Calcutta.
54,Beautiful Building with Interesting exhibits.,This is a large marble building dedicated to queen victoria. It is a kind of museum and best tourist place
55,Excellent piece of Art,"As you visit the Victoria Memorial Hall you will find a vast beautiful grounds.  It's being maintained every day.  There are beautiful flowers, statues, and waters.  Inside the building is a museum with some original photography, statues of famous English nobility, and then some additional art from the time from the area, and some cannons.  If you wanted to fully view all of the museum, it would take about 2-3 hours.  We didn't view all of the museum fully and were able to walk through it in about an house, but didn't get to read all of the history in one of the rooms that goes along with the art."
56,Old Charm,It was very difficult to access the entrance to the Victoria Memorial with a child in a wheelchair. The cemented path is only partially completed with pebbles and stones as filling seperating the concreted strip so we had to carry our child and wheelchair to cross the pebbles to prevent the stones getting locked in the wheels.ln addition there are no ramps at the entrance and you have to carry your child accross the steps. No facilities for wheelchair tourists
57,A bigger scale than I expected,"Victoria memorial is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Kolkata.This white marble structure looks dazzling during the day and equally mesmerizing at nighttime.The structure has been very well maintained and is a delight to watch even from a distance. With a beautiful dome, the structure houses a museum with statues, paintings, weapons, canons of the British era. The gardens outside are beautiful with small water bodies which can serve as a great picnic spot."
58,Beautiful place,In  a nutshell Victoria Memorial  Hall is the heart of KOLKATA.Until you visit you can not imagine.Great monumental structure of eastern India.
59,Wonderful place,"Nicely designed structure, really shows us a glimpse of British rule in India and their contribution, it is really a worth watching monument and pictorial experience al together Just go for it for the memories"
60,Never disappoints ,"Kolkata city evokes some images – images of its icons - and the most promising ones among those of the two icons – Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge (leaving a plethora of them aside including those of the electric trams, rickshaw pullers and the famous puchkas).My childhood had been spent with umpteen visits to the Victoria Memorial – and in those days, my father was neither very busy nor very rich. And as he rose in the corporate ladder, the time started becoming scarce and visits also reduced. But every visit was brilliant for the very long walks in the exquisite gardens of the Memorial – which was followed by some great street food in the Maidan right opposite the gates of the memorial. The most famous among them was the Dal Vada (that had moved to Vardaan Market – see its review), chana jor garam, Bhel Puri, Batata Puri, Puchkas and the Churmurs. Now every delicacy had a place in Kolkata where it was served right – not very simple anymore! Those were days of innocence – and days without gadgets or mobiles – and days with hardly any needs worries or distractions. And hence numerous visits to the Memorial. But never did I remember entering the main precincts of the building – it was out of reach. And now almost three decades later, I was here at the famous icon of the Kolkata – back for good.A small crowd had thronged near the entrance gate. There were tickets only for the lawns and extra for the main Hall. For foreigners, the rates were significantly higher (Rs 30 vs Rs 500). After a wait of about 10 minutes or so, we entered the Memorial. The main lawns were magnificent and decked in myriad hues and colours. The cobbled stone walkways were as we had left – though the stone count seem to have been diminished and parts of walkways were broken. There was plastic ban in the compound – which was good thing. May be it is expected that a nationwide ban on single use plastic is coming soon – good riddance of a catastrophic human blunder. Apart from lawns, there were small lakes in the grounds that provided excellent setting for this masterpiece.Inside the main hall, there was huge crowd that had built up – to see numerous exhibits on displays – there were holy books, old armoury, communication equipment, paintings, canons and what not. I had just been to the National Museum in London and this memorial administration could surely learn few tricks of trade. There was significant scope of improvement in how things should be displayed or how a museum should have been managed. There were places where the paint was peeling – or the AC cables had made a mess of the venue (built at a time when AC possibly did not exist) – or birds that freely flew inside the main hall – or dustbins that were just not clean enough. Built between 1906 and 1921, the century old icon of Kolkata was classic case of elusive Utopia at an architectural masterpiece – niggles here and there and here and there."
61,Beautiful building and parks,Victoria memorial is the main attraction of Kolkata.It looks very beautiful.If you visit kolkata and miss victoria memorial your journey is incomplete.Victoria memorial is a landmark of The british period.There is a very big hall inside it and twelve paintings are on the wall.The statues of various viceroys are in the campus.The area of victoria memorial is very large.There is a garden also.
62,Impressive and relaxing visit,The beauty of this place still shines. Hope the indian government can preserve it in future. Require more systematic arrangements and nice lights.
63,Journey into india's colonial past,"This is more than a memorial, it is huge and full of interesting material explaining the British Raj and it's occupation of India. It costs 500 rupees to get in if you are not Indian (they pay 100). the surrounding gardens are a quiet haven from the manic streets of Kolkata outside. Definitely worth a visit. There are only two entrances into the park, one at the north side and one at the south."
64,Beautiful place for spend quality time,A beautiful building built in the British era surrounded by endless green well maintained gardens interspersed with small water bodies will lift the hearts of everyone. The children can enjoy the endless gardens  while the grown ups can add to the experience by visiting the museum. If u are visiting from another city make sure to keep a full day aside for a complete experience.
65,Memorable place,"As a history lover, this is where you find it in Kolkata, pre-during and after the British. A bit dusty, but the story is worth it."
66,Really beautiful building and interesting,"It's an iconic building not only of Kolkata, but the whole of India. Sadly, the gardens and the ponds are not maintained as the status. I wish Indians took more pride in their heritage."
67,Fabulous architecture,Victoria memorial hall is lovely place it was .great place Victoria memorial is built by British sarkar such a huge hall it was lovely place it was .I love the vibe there
68,MUST VISIT,"Its a very good memorial hall located in KOLKATA with beautiful surrounding gardens where you can take a fresh breath.A museum is also attached within Victoria compound, which also very nice to see."
69,Impressive memorial of British occupation ,"One of the most iconic symbols of Kolkata.It has a rich history associated with it and there is a museum inside. The gardens are very well maintained. And if you are interested is Morning walks or a breath of fresh air amidst the concrete jungle, then this would fit in perfectly. The lawns are spacious and there is enough space for young kids to run around.The place is equally mesmerizing when the lights are switched on in the evening. Finding a parking spot for your vehicle might be problematic as most of the roads around it has ""no parking"".The angel statue on top is supposed to whistle if there is a storm brewing, but I am not aware of anyone who has heard it personally.All in all, a nice place for an outing. And a must see if you are visiting Kolkata."
70,Grand building,"This place is a tourist place. It has a wonderful white structured building with a beautiful statue of queen Victoria in front , surrounded by huge well manicured gardens, lawns. Inside the building is a small museum having artifacts, weapons of olden times. Overall a great place to visit!!"
71,Stunning building ,Tourism in kolkata is incomplete without visiting Victoria Memorial. Beautiful British architecture and Lush green garden makes it a perfect tourist place.must visit place
72,Gem of Kolkata,"Though it is a very good and excellent architectural wonder, nothing less than the Taj Mahal of Agra. Unfortunately the place could have been developed better for a great tourism experience. Maybe the Travel Agents World did Not see the proper tourism opportunity to promote in its proper perspective. Maybe the Ministry of Defence, which has the adjoining iconic Fort Williams of great historical importance, don’t want visitors for strategic security reasons or whatever."
73,Great heritage,This is the highlight of Kolkata. Interesting museum with amazing architecture. Reminds one of the Taj Mahal. Beautiful gardens. Need at least half a day to a day to visit and take it all in. Situated in a lovely green area of Kolkata too.
74,Access for the Disabled,"Kolkata seems has not many attractions, and Victoria Memorial has not much things to see. Visitors also have to join a long queue in front of the ticket counter, and 2 entrance gates. Total wasted time is 1 hour while the visit is not more than 1 hour. If you're not a fan of architecture and British Royal families, you can skip this attraction"
75,A gem for all,"The Victoria Memorial is a huge and attractive marble building in central Kolkata, India, Victoria Memorial was built in the beginning of twentieth century between 1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria and is now a museum and attractive tourist destination under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture.  Victoria was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain she adopted the additional title of Empress of India. On  the top the central dome of the Victoria Memorial there is the Angel of Victory.I visited with my wife, son and grandson after Birla Planetarium. My son and grandson went inside the gallery while with my wife I was seated on bench where we were sitting many times before marriage. We were recalling the past looking at lake in front of the Victoria Memorial.Victoria Memorial is itself a landmark surround by St Cathedral road, Queens Way, Calcutta Race course.Caution: Photography is allowed inside the garden but not inside the gallery to protect the paintings."
76,Major attraction in Kolkata - Take the tour,"Victoria memorial is a great piece of architecture. The garden around it, the lakes, the squirrels, the birds everything was so peacefully surrounds it. The statues was well planted. I love the calm and quietness in the middle of the chaotic Kolkata"
77,Crowded,It was lovely to walk through the gardens and view the memorial from every angle. The local population kept on asking for us to be in their photos and that was lovely.
78,Worth a visit,"Well maintained historical structure which is essential attendance for all new and repeat visitors coming to Kolkata, to infirm and remind how central this city was to Indian and British trades and cultures since the late seventeenth century. Beautiful grounds outside, beautiful galleries and exhibits and ceilings inside."
79,Beautiful building and architecture,As young person grew up in Kolkata was disappointed to see the Victoria Memorial in such a poor state of Maintainence. The marble is stained yellow the grounds are poorly maintained.
80,Magnificent monument ,"This is something else again. A time machine that takes one back to the years before the First World War although only built in 1921. It is a tribute to its eponymous dedicatee. Extracted nay blackmailed into contributing, India was generous in its tribute to her. The building is instartlingly white Indian marble. Ornate and rather elegant. Once past the bronze of Victoria Emperatrix , one steps into a vast echoing hall surmounted by a galleried cupola. The first sight is a beautiful statue of the young queen. The ground floor is full of loot, portraits of the dignitaries of Victoria’s India, watercolours by her sailors, cannon, a wonderful black marble table mounted on four bronze howitzers, weapons of the period of British rule.Upstairs I found an exquisite exhibition of Indian miniatures that took me a full hour to see properly."
81,Overrated ,Beautifully presented memorial where one can easily spend 2 to 3 hours lazily walking around the gardens.The memorial hall itself is quite interesting with two levels of viewing.
82,majestic Monument and Gallery,"This major historical site in Kolkata is really worth visiting for its historical value and lovely gardens. There are night tours available too where you can see the monument lit in dark night. But I only could see it from outside.Inside is a good museum where we get to see some good paintings giving us a glimpse of yesteryear times. In the 1st floor, there are few shows arranged. When I visited it was a painting exhibition from an art gallery that was being exhibited."
83,Historical Monument,"A British era monument beautifully sculpted. One of the icons of Kolkata, must see place of this city. Best time to visit is in the morning to avoid hot sun. Gardens are beautifully done too. One can spend 1.5 to 2 hours here if interested in history."
84,Good place ,A trip to Kolkata is not complete without a trip to Victoria Memorial Hall. We visited in the morning and there was a long queue for tickets. The only time I was hassled by beggars was waiting in this line. The site can be crowded depending on the day/time. Target enough time to stroll through the grounds. It's a lovely place to sit under a tree and relax.
85,Victoria,"Victoria Memorial Hall and Gardens are walking distance from New Market and definitely worth a visit. Also close to the planetarium and St. Paul’s Cathedral, both worth a visit. Garden entry is just 20rupees/€0.27approx. Nice for relaxing or taking pics, be prepared though tourists are a little like celebs at most attractions in India. You will be asked for many selfies and to join family pics... ☺️📸"
86,Memorable trip,"Historical place in kolkata, India. We enjoyed with our family. Good place for tourists and all. Thank you."
87,Sunday,The Victoria Memorial Hall is a beautiful historical monument . It's well maintained and an eye catching sight situated at the heart of Kolkata City.
88,Beautiful,"The best monument to worth of visit in Kolkata and also the most significat, if you are not Hindu. I enjoyed also walk in a park all around."
89,Historical place,This major historical site in Kolkata is really worth visiting for its historical value and lovely gardens. Sunset is a great time to go to get great photos
90,Enjoyable place to walk around for 20 RS,If u are in Kolkata don't miss this historical place . It's brilliant . The structure of Victoria memorial is mesmerizing and beautiful . Entry fee is around 10-20 and high for foreigners. I visited here with my friends and we all enjoyed a lot .
91,Visited after a long time,I have visited this in 2001 and now 2019. Needs more uplifting work. It’s a monumental effigy of Britain’s rule of India.
92,The best monument to worth of visit,"Despite the statue of that pompous git Curzon at the front, this is one of the great buildings of India particularly viewed from an angle at twilight. Beautifully executed, beautifully maintained"
93,Powerplay by the British occupiers to suppress or impress the locals.,"Dramatic empire style/Edwardian architecture that still looks brilliant despite losing some gloss when cleaned of the black paint job that was done in World War II. Really interesting collection of sculpture, paintings, documents and some memorabilia inside. All surrounded by beautifully kept gardens."
94,Must visit,Whenever there is any mention of Kolkata in any papers or video almost always the first thing that is shown is the Victoria Memorial . It is a remnant of bygone Colonial rule and an architectural marvel. The Memorial grounds are beautiful and one has to keep this in their bucket list if he/she visits the city of Joy!!!
95,Kalkuta ,A well maintained beautiful structure from the British Era. Nothing much to see inside but the acres of green lawns around it give a charm to this beautiful structure.
96,For One Night Only,"Nearly after 44 years I visited Victoria Memorial hall, with lot of curiosity and great old memories of my college years. But not that happy. The grand wide garden around the hall is not taken much care. No one fountain is working.Inside the hall those great sculptures are not illuminated properly. The arts and some antiques are kept too far to the visitors, so that not able to read the descriptions of those items. Such a great heritage building should have given more focus and attention by the archeological department or the relevant responsible department."
97,Beautiful and peaceful ,"Made of White Marble this victorian era masterpiece is situated in the heart of Kolkata within a huge green compound with fountains that make it a favourite place for morning walkers.Just opposite are the Maidan and the fountain of Joy.Apart from Raj Era relics,the atmosphere of the place mesmerizes you.Definately worth a visit"

100,A Must see Attraction,This one is a masterpiece. Just see what the Britishers have left for us. Beautiful.. my family likes it very much
101,Colonial Architecture,"The monument is jo doubt glorious and beautiful, but it pains the heart that it was built at a time when our country was in extreme poverty and famines were commonplace .  Though the britishers built it to further their own legacy, it is an indian monument today and thus mist be cherished. The good thing we can learn is how to preserve our past and heritage ,the same way the british have ensured even when they have left our country"
102,Feel of European Style Structure,Victoria  Memorial is a famous memorial of Kolkata. Huge area and well maintained. Entrance fee is not costly and separate ticket to enter Memorial hall.
103,Dirty,Lovely gardens and interesting displays inside.  Interesting and even-handed history of Calcutta/Kolkata. Make sure you go up and circle the dome looking down on the statue of Queen Victoria.
104,The city Icon of Kolkata,"This is really an imposing building. Not just the building but the entire complex and the the statue in the middle of the grounds. The museum inside gives us a glimpse into the history. Lot of armoury is on display. The garden is well developed with vast lawns, large trees and a small stream flowing. This is a must see if you are in Kolkata. You can enjoy a lot of time relaxing with history and nature!!"

The gardens are lovely and the museum is great to photograph from the outside. No need to go into the museum."
112,Cool,"I bought the ticket for the gardens surrounding Victoria Memorial and not for the museum itself. It was a very pleasant early morning walk - warm spring air, birds calling, and the beautiful structure of Victoria memorial."
113,Historical place,"It is a historical monument. A day is not enough for a student or admirer of history to see it. Take a small notebook and make notes. Weekdays should be ideal if you want to see it leisurely. Please don't use cameras inside, be responsible"
114,Nice Architecture,"This is a popular tourist destination and there is a lot of history here, but it is incredibly crowded. There is very little breathing room, making it hard to see some artifacts. If you are visiting as a foreigner, I recommend getting a guide to help shortcut the long lines and to highlight the important artifacts."

It tooks minimum 2 hours to visit all the premise.  Very very beautiful place for tourist."

132,Victoria memorial ,"So I was born and brought up in Calcutta and perhaps crossed this enchanting monument twice everyday of my school life when I was not on a holiday. I remember peeping out of the window to see the Fairy on top of the domw twirl just once! But, Alas!I went back now, almost 25 years out of school, this time vowing to myself I would go into the monument to see what I had missed!And I did not repent it one bit! Its a wonder! An architectural marvel and a work of outstanding geometric precision. It is an exemplary expression of Vistorian artistry, not to be missed for anything on this earth and in the city!However, my two bits of advice would be- read about the place before you go! Do not expect a guide beacuse we found none! If you are aware of what you are walking into the delight would be deeper and more heartfelt!"
133,Amazing monument,It's a good example of architecture white building with history of indian freedom movement every one who visit kolkata should visit this place just to know our history
134,Great Architecture Victoria Memorial ,"It's a lovely place to visit and specially when the weather is pleasant and the clouds are clear. Established in 1921, Victoria Memorial Hall was dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria"
135,Victoria memorial,Visiting KOLKATA and not going to Victoria memorial is simply unbelievable and unthinkable.  It is one of the most sought place to visit in KOLKATA.  It is an icon of KOLKATA

140,Lovely gardens and people!,"The gardens, are truly an Oasis in the desert of noise and chaos that is Kolkata. They open at 5.30, so one can take a walk before temperature's rise too high. Definitely worth a stroll!"
141,Trip,"Beautiful monument, a must for any visitor to the city.Beautiful gardens, best if visited not in May or June."
142,True wonder,"Visiting this museum with a local friend was very nice, as it showed me some of the vast history of the city, but also overwhelming. There are few rooms with air conditioning, so it was mostly hot and humid as we wandered the halls. It is a good-sized museum, with much to see, so be prepared to walk and stand a lot. Warning to foreigners (especially blond women): some locals will want to take photos with you."
143,Queen Victoria's Museum,"This is a major historical site in Kolkata.  It is not worth more than an hour.  There is a free guided in the Memorial Hall that is worth the time.  Check out the paintings.  There are a few hidden gems in there.  Do not miss ""Bharat Mata"" by Abanindranath Tagore."

It looked so beautiful and also really historic.If you enjoy history and reading then you can easily spend around 4hrs here,  but you are not much into reading then you will simply see the place and come out in an hours time.There are a few things which you want to see then will have to take staircase, which are tough for old people snd heart patients.If you are going with an infant then, avoid taking pram as you won't be able to go to level 1 with it.The entry is super cheap for Indians and evenings lights especially during Christmas time are worth watching.Enjoy this place once and there is ample of place and good benches to sit outside.You can enjoy the cool breeze during winters."
147,Popular historical place,One of the iconic monuments of Kolkata.  Most of the movies and serials having storyline based on Kolkata will show a glimpse of this magnificent structure. It has inside the items on display of Victorian era. It has a beautiful garden and water bodies around it. Best place for outing with family on a holiday.

The park is large and well kept, but relatively to European sites, it is nothing to tell home about."

Lord Carzon also proposed the idea of a grand building with a museum and garden.The ""Prince of Wales"" later ""King George V laid the foundation stone on 4thJanuary,1906.It was formerly open to public in 1921.Kolkata was the capital of British regime but before the completion of construction the British Govt transferred the Capital from Calcutta to Delhi.Lord Carzon appeal for fund and the Indian states zamindar and Kings arrange this.

Very friendly and happy people !!  0:)"
159,An Oasis,"One of the few must see attractions in Kolkata. It is located in the central Maidan area close to Park street, the Kolkata race course, golf course and the zoo. Currently a part is under renovation. Must walk around, see the display inside, take a buggy ride and sample some street food."
160,Victoria memirial,"If you visit Kolkata, this is a must visit place. As much I have seen Kolkata this is the most beautiful building in this city."
161,Historic place,Great collection of historical importance. Must see place if visiting Kolkata. Grand place. The museum has been methodically planned and well maintained. Must visit
162,A good historical building.,Its symbolic to Kolkata and is right in heart of the city. In season during morning hours the que for ticket is long. It's moves fast but you can avoid by checking online also. It's a great place for morning walk as well.
163,Historical Place,"One of the beautiful and must visit place while travelling to Kolkata, West Bengal. Historical Monument..."
164,Historical Monument.. Must VISIT!!,It is british era bulding with big garden full of flowers. the place is nicely maintained and a must to see place in Kolkatta
165,Must visit place in Kolkata ,A nice museum to visit along with family and especially young kids. There are several historical artefacts.
166,Famous place,Its a great structure and there are lot of information about Indian History but the interiors smell real bad. Bengal Govt need to take care of it.
167,Giant statues,Informative but crowded.Unable to read as people were pushing.Lovely architecture and a must visit place.
168,First visit,Beautiful and mesmerising monument...a lovely museum inside it.the greenery all around is specially breath taking.
169,Beautifully preserved,"It is a magnificent victorian era structure in white marble.Surrounded by large open area,garden and water body one can imagine great British Empire.When we visited only some part of museum was open as renovation work was going on but whatever we saw,could give us insight into early days of British establishment which Kolkata experienced first in India.The museum has grand collection of British era manuscripts,paintings,weapons and other important information of those days.Those who are interested in history must come here and those who are not interested in history they should not be disappointed as there is a beautiful garden,sitting benches,lake etc for good photography and of course tasty street food just in front of memorial."
170,Historical Symbol not my money waste,"This is our History Well maintained with old memories Slight renovation is going on and lawn grasses are not maintained otherwise this is the great place to visit with family Location is great Taxi or car will reach to the entrance gate Buy a ticket ( 20 for only lawns , 30 will allow you to go for inside and museum for Indians 500 for foreigners (8$) per person Old book , riffles, statues ,canon ,paintings and many more in museum Architecture is beautiful Done is very good You can take your mobile and take pictures free Timing is 10-5 pm so in summer or hot day proper enjoy can’t be done in open lawns and pond lake inside Water bottle allowed but there are few free drinking facilities with chilled water inside Good place for visit with family"
171,Great monument,Opted to avoid the museum as it was 500 per foreigner. Instead took the 20 ticket which allows you to walk around the gardens which were very well kept.
172,Relive the History of Calcutta,"it is about nonexistent glorious past, just go for a walk in the nice day, architecture reflects tastes of the departed so nothing spectacular"
173,Elusive Utopia at the Architectural Masterpiece,Its a place that has a very special place in my life. I have grown up seeing my dad and uncle go there for morning walks and now that's the place I work out every mrning. The structure is breathtakingly beautiful and well maintained pride of Kolkata.However it does get crowded on weekends and festivities as there is an influx of rural travelers.
174,Marvelous creation of marble!,A history buff could easily spend the whole day here for the wealth of knowledge about the olden times. Well maintained.
175,A beautiful monument,Such a pleasure to see the opulence of the period captured in a building. Basically British architecture with an obvious local influence. Exhibits are good but the highlight is the ambience of the building and grounds.
176,Wonderful Architectural Design,"It's out of my expectation , the total architecture fascinated us very much. Nothing to explain about historic value. It's also an idle place for the people who are interested for photo shoot ,"
177,Do not miss the museum,"Last time I visited Victoria Memorial, it was with my ex boyfriend which was about 13-14 years earlier. I only had flashbacks memories of this place, the way I have of him.So, what made me visit this place again? It was not my intention to revive the lost relationship but to create one. My friend and his mother wanted to see Victoria Memorial and I am their tour guide for the day.So, a cool day of February (except Monday) was selected for three of us to visit one of the iconic heritage of Kolkata. It's an outing to know each other and perhaps his mother liking me a little bit more.( Ugh!!what a place to choose!!)The first confusion started when I entered at the wrong gate. They entered from the main gate ( 2 lions sitting in front) while I entered at the back gate side). It took me almost 10minutes to meet them with a little jog from my side to cover up the distance as quickly as possible. Lesson learned - be minute in planning, including gates!!As we entered, the left hand side of the museum had pre independent stories and pictures. Three of us all carefully scrutinized with occasional inputs from his mother. I nodded and smile like a fool as if I am getting my first lesson of History from her. The right hand side had paintings all over the world including a Monalisa.As you proceed toward the main hall you get to see different statues and artefacts. In the meantime, due to long hours of standing, she was feeling tired and they had benches to sit.We placed her there and took stairs to go upstairs. You could see the whole beautiful hall at a glance and I transcended to the Victorian Age while holding the hand of my Knight.As I write this review, I get to know from newspapers that Victoria Memorial is going to have over 2000 more artefacts and extended hours. There were lot of sections closed for revamp and anytime soon in June,2019- Kolkata is going to get it's popular tourist spot in a new avatar with more accessability to disabled.And as for my newly found relationship, we are going strong for 7months and his mother is little bit impressed by me, I presume as the picture I clicked of hers in front of Victoria Memorial is her WhatsApp Profile picture."
178,Beautiful ,"We visited this place twice, the reason being the first time we visited was on Monday and they do not allow visitors inside the museum and also it was getting dark.Well maintained and really good architecture. Also the garden area is well maintained. The museum hosts some really good history.One of the must visit places if you are in Kolkotta."
179,Best building in Kolkata,This is a very interesting place to visit but unfortunately there were hundreds of school children and this made it very noisy.A must if you are interested in the British connection in India.
180,Amazing place to visit.,Dont bother. Poorly kept. A colonial vestige for the poor population to gawk at. Terrible ticketing service. No shelter from rain or sunAvoid
181,Good one,One of the most visited places in Kolkata. Weekend and afternoon is bit crowded but it’s a very beautiful Victorian style building surrounded by large beautiful gardens and fountains
182,WONDERFUL WHITE PALACE OF KOLKATA,"Although I visited this place in summers, i was very happy with the way arrangements were done.Educated and wise visitors were there. The pebbles on the main road is amazing. Not very costly. Overall, I recommend everyone to visit there."
183,The place which only kolkata has,"Victoria Memorial has always been one of the favourite places to hangout for couples to spend some quality time with you Special one's.But nowadays they are not allowing to sit in the garden.Moreover this has always been one of the attraction of Kolkata, you should definitely visit this place once in your lifetime."
184,Awesome structure,Well worth walking around if you are nearby. Looks great illuminated at night. Lots of market stalls selling food nearby.
185,Heritage Building,It's situated in Heart of the City. A very nice place and constructed with white marble. Presently a number of people with bad intention visit the place which brings bad name to the city. Galleries are there.A awful contribution of British Empire.
186,Reminiscing Victoria Memorial,the most attractive and historical palace as well as the best tourist post in Kolkata. sarounding campus used to be always greenish along with lots of flowers decoration
187,Must go in Kolkata,The massive size of the gardens and the serene pond with birds flying over it is the best morning to start with. Located at the heart of the city with accessibility from all the possible conveyance by road. Must spend time if you get to visit kolkata. Best time to visit anytime except summer. INR 20 is the entry for the garden and INR 100 for the museum in the memorial hall.

189,Vacation with mom,"We had a charity ball at the hall, the staff were amazing especially Laura and Danielle they catered for our every need and it felt like a very safe happy environment 10/10"
190,Takes you back to history!,"There is so much to see and absorb if you are really interested in Indian History and the Raj, so do ensure you have the time to see and browse. If you do not enjoy history then do not bother to visit, let those that do have more room."

196,Victorian Era masterpiece in the herat of Kolkata,Surprisingly such a great monument is not easy access to wheelchair persons. The pebbles and lamp post makes it difficult to move around for wheelchair.
197,Slice of history,"Historical Symbol not my money waste, a large amount of money was waste to build  this huge and beautiful structure in an unnecessary amount of land. The money they've spend it was my forefathers .and taxpayers of that period"
198,A morning spent in Victoria,Lovely building housing dull unrestored paintings and unremarkable artefacts.More effort could be put into making these displays more appealing
199,Remains of a Grand Yesterday,"Victoria memorial is a widespread estate with a musuem surrounded by a huge beautiful garden. There are ponds, green lawns, trees all over. The museum has life size stautes carved in marble if most if the British viceroriys and governors. The biggest attraction is the worlds largest painting of oil on one piece canvas size @ 7meters x 7 meters. Its a treat to watch. Its a must visit on your list. Enjoy the tour. It takes twi hours for the museum tour so go with amoke time on hand. Enjoy!!"
200,Kolkata's Pride,"It is beautiful, well maintained, relaxing place. The day I went there is not crowded, weather was fine.Museum is not big, but have some good paintings to see.I like the architecture and garden.Foreigner's ticket price is higer, for me is acceptable though.是個美麗而愜意的地方，維護得不錯，建築物本體跟花園都很漂亮。我去的那一天不擁擠，而且天氣很好。裡面的博物館不大，還是有些作品可以看看。外國人的票價比較高，然後我還是可以接受的。"
201,Majestic,If there is one thing to see in Kolkata it is this building.  It is in a lovely park and a wonderful place to spend some time.  Some of the exhibits could use some TLC.  It is unfortunate that there is not more attention paid to the exhibits.
202,The Taj Mahal of Kolkata,you must explore this beautiful architecture of kolkata. the museum is also very very nice. the whole area is simply beautiful apart from the typical hustle and bustle of the city.
203,Definitely worth a visit,The garden is beautiful and well maintained. The lakes and waterbodies are pleasing to the eye. The memorial is a huge imposing structure.
204,With family,Its a lovely old building with a very small museum. Worth visiting but you won't need very long here. The gardens are lovely though.
205,The most impressive Heritage Site in Kolkata,Best haritage place in India.One of the best thing British made in India.If you want come to kolkata you must go to Victoria.
206,Photoshoot,"1. The gardens/park is one of the best green patches for morning/evening walks or jogging.Or you can just sit there and enjoy the pleasant breeze.2. The museum inside is also worth a visit.3. A visit to Kolkata is not complete without this.4. After dark, the lights bring out another facet of this beautiful building. As such, although you will not be allowed to go inside at night, seeing it from outside is also great.5. If you are driving your own vehicle, parking may be a problem.6. The angel on top was supposed to sing (indicator of hurricane speed winds). Thank God, never heard her sing."
207,Must Visit place in KOLKATA ,You can spend hours there inside and outside. It’s garden is beautiful and so is the architecture. Water body is also clean and kept amazingly beautiful.
208,Memories,The building us beautiful and looks gorgeous. Though I thought could have been maintained better. The location  is just breathtaking.
209,Awesome ,Simply majestic and magnificent. We went during the day as well as night. A huge property with a well kept park. Any ardent Instagrammer will find this place awesome. A must visit while in Kolkata.
210,Clean n historical,"This was exceptionally beautiful...the building is lovely and the gardens are even better.green clean and well kept..must go..first public place in india I have seen that has such well kept gardens.. no litter,no spit, no screaming...and great history..."
211,THE ANOTHER TAJMAHAL,"Amazing place....Loved it, iconic, best tourist place to visit in Kolkata.Good to visit with families and friends."
212,A tale told of the era gone,Very disappointing since the building is so nice but inside: NOTHING interesting! To add insult the admission for foreigners are something like 10 times higher ( forgot exact amount but maybe even more ) than local visitors!
213,Must see in Kolkata,Beautifully made! Went with friends enjoyed a lot. Loved the environment and ambiance. Building is so old but yet maintained
214,Essence of Kolkata,I was here in mid august with family.The complex premises is very good.The outside view of this building is more attractive than inside view.It is just like a small museum where you can see many ancient things.My children had enjoyed very well.Overall a nice visit.
215,British Era legacy,Very beautiful place for the travellers who love to click pictures.  I really enjoyed my tour over there
216,A short visit,"Visit this place, if you love visiting and watching historical place. Its a beautiful huge building. Inside this is the museum having belongings and photographs of the queen Victoria. Outside is the garden, where you can spend quality time. Spare 1-2 hour to visit this place. Personally i rate this place as routine, average place, NOT MUST Visit place. We visited only for sake of visit as we were first time at kolkata with family. Nearby is the Birla planetaurium, 5-10 minute walking distance, loved by kids."
217,Tour,"Invading a country, make its people work for a small country on the other side of the world and then have them pay for a preposterous building say all about colonialism. The building itself is impressive though, but it’s INR500 for foreigners to go in and look at old guns and paintings."
218,most beautiful british landmark of kolkata,"a beautiful tourist attraction in the heart of kolkata, lush gardens beautiful construction. you can spend your evenings there people watching, there are artists painting the memorial on their canvas, families having an outing, theatre plays being rehearsed etc. its fun to sit in the backside where the hoogly river meets the bank with a view of the howrah bridge (if im not wrong) its just amazing and soothing. you can munch on the chana choor chat and other snacks being sold by the vendors. definitely some good memories"
219,A purposeful visit to the Iconic Heritage of Kolkata,Recently had a 7 hour layover at Kolkata airport on way to Bangkok. So decided to visit queen Victoria memorial in maidan area.took a prepaid taxi to dumdum metro and then metro to maidan. Queen Victoria memorial is walkable distance from maidan metro. Entry fee is rs 50 for indians. Very beautifully kept pieces of history during British raj.gifts to queen Victoria r displayed here.part of the museum is partially air conditioned. Take ur time and enjoy the museum. Gardens around the memorial r very neat and well maintained.
220,breathtaking,Beautiful building but not well maintained. You feel suffocation inside the building and couldn't stay inside for long.
221,History with exercise,"Lovely park and lake for a stroll around, very well kept and worth a few photos.  Not sure its worth 1000 rupees for 2, for a walk, when there are other nice parks around with free entrance, but there is a museum of sorts."
222,Visit in October,Never thought it will be so big and amazing to look at. Great historical place to visit. You can roam around the garden which is also large enough.
223,Pleasant early morning walk,"The structure is magnificent and very beautiful and surrounded by sprawling lawns. It is one of the beautiful structures that the Brits built in India. When in Kolkata, it’s a recommended place to visit. The museum is small but decent and it aptly chronicles the history of Kolkata (since advent of the Brits)."
224,Awesome place to Visit,Very beautiful place to visit.the garder is very decorated. Love the place very much.have a try you will love
225,Oh So Royal!,One of the best places with combinations of historical place as well as nature like pond and trees. Clean and sober.
226,A must-see tourist spot,"Excellent monument, neat and tidy, very informative museum, don’t need a guide.Nice garden around, clean toilets , must see place in  Kolkata"
227,Beautiful place,Excellent place having historical values and awesome architecture which makes you feel good. Perfect place to spend quality time with near ones in a lovely evening. You can also enjoy the beauty of water show in the garden just beside this.
228,"Built by our opressors , beautiful nevertheless","This place has a great mixture of both natural beauty and Historical beauty as well, preferable place for couples, family get together also a must visit for photography enthusiasts."
229,Nice,This is a must-watch tourist attraction if you are in Kolkata. Well maintained and the staff is also quite cooperative. There are several picturesque sights in the memorial
230,Combination of British and Mughal architecture,"This is a very impressive and indeed over the top piece of colonial excess. It needs to be seen, but for Western visitors hardly worth going inside. The museum which occupies all of the area open to the public is rather poor and of little interest. The crowds made it a chore to walk around.Best just stay outside and take photos."
231,Monday is closed,I have visited here before a couple of times actually. This time was a night visit if you go before 10pm it is lit up with different hues of colour. Worth seeing and good for photos.
232,NICE BUILDING BUT NOTHING TO SEE,Ticket with museum is for 30rs and only garden is 20 rs. Gardens are well maintained . Stones laid down are not easy to walk on.Museum closes at 5 and food canteen at 4 pm. View is breathtaking . Visit inside to see more about the way people and british officers lived . Pictures of old city landscape and famous paintings are displayed.
233,Historical place ,"Great place to visit,  if u are in kolkata it's a must visit,  also u can goto the maidaan in front of it"
234,Victoria Memorial Hall is a MUST to see,"i had heard a lot about this place so it was  a must go place in the list i loved the well maintained garden hall architecture and surrounding around this place you can spend couple of hours there , evening is best time to visit"
235,Beautiful place,Worst experience..the view from outside is great but nothing worth seeing inside..the upstairs rooms were under renovation..waste
236,Iconic place for the city Kolkata,Myself and family enjoy a lot. Great collection. It grains knowledge of mine and chield.Security man behavior is not advisable. 2 - 3 persons (including 1 lady security) were very rough talking / behavior. needs to improve. Overall good experience
237,Big and crowded,"Nice location and very clean place, it’s good place to visit with kids , the garden and all maintenance is good, wonderful place with old memories"
238,"Victoria Memorial, Kolkata",Amazing place for photography ...a cultural heritage surrounded with soo many types of trees... Cool breeze flows from Ganges situated beside... So many things to look around here the architecture and the museum inside has so many things to learn from...
239,A must in Kolkata,Visited there in July'2019 along with some of my friends and just loved the place . Such a wonderful place to visit in Kolkata
240,Mesmerizing architecture ,Very beautiful! Must visit. Really enjoyed with my friends. Had a lot of street food to eat. Was a beautiful day.
241,Beautiful structure,"Known for beauty of Kolkata,fully white marble surrounding covered with very good land scaping, well maintained"
242,Victoria ,Place is beautiful. During my visit was a little bit crowded but we managed to see everything. Reserve at least one hour for this visit. 500 rupees to get in (around 7USD).
243,A must visit in kolkata,"Nice for people who likes history. A bit expencive for foreigners (Inr 500/person). Good view from outside aswell, nuce for taking photoes/video."
244,Unmissable stunning white marble monument,"A wonderful building to look at from the outside, but then when you enter it is even better. The museum section is very interesting"
245,Victoria Menorial,Awestruck monument with a lovely lake. I love the vibe. Its better if you visit early in the morning or around 3-4 to avoid harsh sun rays and have a comfortable visit.
246,Iconic landmark of Kolkata,A treasure and well maintained. Very easy to go around and tickets are easily purchased at the gate.
247,Excellent ,"think about very nice world no-1 place beautiful moments my life thanks, travels Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose airport Kolkata nearby."
248,Uti meeting,Very gud and ancient monument to visit. Had a great story of the place and property also maintained very well by government.
249,Place for History lovers,This is one of the must visit places if you are in Kolkatta for the first time.The structure is currently going repairs on western side. Good lawns all around with water bodies. Museum offers good insight of pre 1900 events.
250,Victoria Memorial - An Excellent Place in Centtral Calcutta,"This was a highlight of my trip to Kolkata but only gave 4 starts as local rate is 40 rupees, foreigner rate 500! Gardens are nice and I enjoyed their collection of historic paintings."
251,beautiful building,"Enough is known to most people about Victoria Memorial. All I would like to add is, it is the most impressive heritage site in the City of Joy."
252,Interesting but not top of my list,Really enjoyable journey. Lots of historical thing are there for watching and learning. Great design and art in the building which long years ago.
253,"Victoria Memorial, Kolkata",Great place to visit in one day trip...it's in heart of the kolkata.. Nice sculpture.. have nice garden to see or seat.. romantic place for couples..
254,The face of Kolkata,"In our five day stay in Kolkata we came here three times. The first time with a guide, when we walked round the outside, the second time when we walked in the gardens and the third when we did both museum and gardens. (Nominal charge just for the gardens) it was within walking distance of our hotel, the Oberoi Grand. The third visit was on a Sunday and we had read it was very popular with Indians and it was. We also got a lot of requests for selfies with us which occasionally got a bit wearing. The information of the colonial history: East India Company etc was very extensive and detailed. Enjoyed our visits very much."
255,Awesome place,"Expect to spend 90 minutes to two hours here.  It will be time well spent.  There is a mixture of exhibits.  Some grand paintings and sculptures, surely.  But the obsessively detailed quarter on the history of Kolkata is fascinating, but also tiring.  It's more than you can absorb completely.  But you can choose where to dip in deeply and where to skim the service.  A fun and informative visit."
256,Gardens Only,"It was interesting to visit this place, weather was really hot so could not enjoy much. the monument is beautiful and should be visited by first time tourists interested in getting to the know the imperial history,"
257,Casual visit for one hour,"Go early to beat the crowds - we were let inside the park before ten, so were some of the first visitors inside and could appreciate the beautiful building itself and also the painting gallery and interesting exhibition of the history of Kolkata. Highly recommend this place. Walk in the park was also very relaxing, it is an oasis within the chaos and noise of the city."
258,Most popular tourist attraction in Kolkatta,I was in durga puja holiday.For ticket line is too long for 1 he's.I booked online and its too costly .Front side had work so it closed . enter with back side and its interested.its memorable place
259,Peaceful gardens.,Namaste Being local I have been this place numerous time. Best time is to visit early morning with less crowd and better atmosphere ! Try to relax in garden area near monument for relaxation ! The museum is from British era ! The inside area is average just good for photo shooting !
260,Awesome Place,This is the most beautiful place of architecture as this place is having very good halls and gardens where the flowers are numerous and I was really mesmerised here in Kolkata
261,Good stay,This place is beautiful... Truly an incredible architecture... You will get to know a lot about history.. What a monument.. One small problem is the place is little crowded. Over all amazing place... You will definitely  appreciate the architect who built it.
262,Beautiful Building,"Extraordinary building, interesting paintings, pleasant grounds, and eye-catching fellow visitors. I went twice"
263,Excellent ,"Do not go on Mondays as this is when they close, all other days are opened. However if you go on MOnday, there is plenty of happiness in walking though the gardens which they keep open for a small fees. There is an artificial  lac and lots of trees giving shade and fresh air when the city is hot boiling. There are birds that you can also watch. We could not visit the Museum inside. Will return next year"
264,Historical place,"It is a beautiful monument surrounded  by a huge expanse of well laid out gardens. It is in good condition and well maintained. The central hall has a beautiful dome, houses a stately statue of Queen Victoria and there are some breathtaking paintings illustrating the milestones in Victoria's life along the base of the dome. Do climb up to the gallery to get a better view of the paintings and the ceiling of the dome. The other halls have a lot of displays, pictures, artefacts etc of the history of that period. There is a beautiful plaque giving the wise proclamation of the Queen made in 1858. The words are applicable even today."
265,Must Visit once,"Beautiful building, but some rooms were closed. Nice visit for a Sunday morning, also good to walk around in the garden."
266,Spectacular edifice in a lush garden,Looks beautiful from the outside and has good old artifacts but that's about it. there is not much to do there but you can relax in the garden outside the Victoria Memorial.
267,Terrible experience ,I was with my 7 year old son and wife.Unfortunately our private taxi diver did not guide us and just dropped us at St. Pauls Cathedral and said he would park there and Victoria memorial is just opposite.Once on the street we asked at least 5 different citizens who gave us vague directions.Finally a security guard of one small gate misled us into the garden and we walked in the midday sun for some 800 mtrs to a gate where another guard said it would open only at 3 pm..we managed to get out of the garden and on the street and  our taxi driver picked us up from there.We were so exhausted that we just saw the structure from one of the gates from outside.Worst experience of a historic structure of my life.!!!The locals I asked for directions were clueless about the two access gates.Please get dropped only in front of either gates..ignorant citizens and lazy and insensitive taxi driver!!!Bad..bad bad experience in this city of Joy?????
268,Too Noisy,I feel fortune to visit this beautiful place of city of joy nice garden outside the palace which is awesome
269,Stunning beauty ,"You can visit there with family, friends, colleague, but the best to visit with couple. It's best for the romantic couples. You can see the beautiful garden. It's a memorable place at the time of queen Victoria in power. Inside the hall you can see the historical weapons, maps, dresses, the demo of life style of Britishers."
270,An interesting reflection of the British Raj,Wondeful place to hang out. I visited this place almost 10 times. Its the best place in kolkata to spent some time with ur loved one.
271,Tajmahal - like.....,Iconic symbol of the city. It is one of the best heritage place in the middle of busy city. The best thing about this place is the wonderful architecture of the monument. Victoria Memorial is known worldwide built during British rule in India for the queen. Today it is an iconic and landmark build as well as serve as a museum. The white behemoth has some splendid architectural features.
272,Palace Type Marble Monument,Great place to visit while in Kalkuta . The quality of air it’s not the best so make sure you have a breathing mask
273,Great architecture,"This place is must visit place while travelling to kolkata.No tripod allowed, you can carry camera."
274,Nice place to visit,Though it was a rainy day - but we enjoyed the memorial hall trip all day. Nothing much to see but we were amazed by few collections specially those bones of animals.
275,"VICTORIA MEMORIAL,KOLKATA",It a true wonder of Kolkata very relaxing and enjoyable place in Kolkata.  One must visit during weekend
276,World class monument ,"We spent a couple of hours here along with hundreds of other visitors, avoid the weekend if you can and be prepared to be asked to be in a photo if you are a foreigner. For some reason the locals like to have a photo with you, which we found a bit weird at first but wee fine about. the locals are really very friendly.The building is very beautiful and has an excellent history museum inside, so expect to spend a good couple of hours here."
277,Still same look,It's a great place to see... Very beautiful building and peaceful place has a very large open area.... We can sit.... Play... Relax. There. Great place for time pass and a good way to get relaxation from city crowd
278,A must Visit in Kolkata.,One of the things that I admire about this place is the lush green lawns with colourful flowers blooming. It has been well maintained. The gardens provide a very relaxing place for those who visit here. This place looks so beautiful at night and is pleasing to the eyes.The place is open for the public for all days of the week except Monday and entry fee is very minimal. A special light and sound show is held as well. Photography inside the structure is strictly prohibited and one can only take snaps from outside.
279,A trip down the memory lane during Victorian era,Went here for a photoshoot of my kid. Really well maintained and beautifully kept.It's actually a great place for clicking pics.
280,Beautiful ,"One can go inside by paying INR 3-5 per person and spend the time by walking and strolling in the garden or by the side of the lakes. After 930am one can go inside and see the different pictures, photos, documents and other interesting things during Victorian Era on every day display"
281,Exhibits are in dull light,"One of the best places to visit in Kolkata. The place is beautifully kept , great architecture. There is huge statue of queen Victoria in the entrance.The exhibits tells you a great story about Kolkata and the British role there.Definitely recommend"
282,Great collection,We visited Victoria memorial and we were surprised to see that. It is beautiful white building. Garden is also very beautiful. We spent 2 hours there. We enjoyed very much. We eat puchka there very delicious. We also get a ride of horsecart. This trip always be in my heart. Victoria Memorial is a live symbol l of architecture
283,Very beautiful green heaven in the midst of cocrete jungle,The onlyt thing is having photo in the garden. There is no any interesting thing inside and it is very dirty!
284,Photoshoot,"This wasn't in my list and I had to visit this place because of a cab driver. I didn't regret it though They have a entry fee of around 25 INR ( not sure though ) and your baggage will be checked by para military before entering The lush green gardens and the tall building will make you fall in love with it. The old rifles,monuments, statues and other artefacts will definitely make you travel back in time. This is a must see place in India if you are a lover of history and architecture"
285,Place for photography,I was disappointed when I have visited the ground. There was gravel everywhere. It would really difficult for wheelchair user to access. As for top attraction in Kolkata it should be better looked after. Rubbish and unfinished work really spoiled the experience. The staff were keep blowing they whistles and shouting at the visitors. I felt like I was at the swimming pool with this amount of noise.
286,Must visit,Very good service and ambience. Himangshu and Chimsang Surujit are very cordial and supportive. Food quality specially vetki and gur baked rasgulla were nice. Special mention for cleanlyness.
287,Mesmerised by beauty,It is a famous place and nice place for the visit.It is a known place in the city.It is beautiful and nice visit.
288,Victoria beauty,this is a good place for morning walk and making friends from all over Kolkata.This also have number of visitors from all over the county to see the monument andit is a nice place to visit for first time visitor.
289,The iconic Victoria Memorial Hall,The garden is a good places for walk. But the inside of museum is congested and musty and there is nothing much to see.
290,Memorial of queen Victoria,This is one of the very important building of Kolkata. Open blue sky his very attracting from this location.
291,I loved the place,Gery good hotrl.pleasant stay and vomfortable stay.all staff are good.Specially arpita as lssd's o good.Vidit soon
292,Beautiful Architecture,It is one of the most overrated places in Kolkata. Park is decent sized but during the evenings it is crowded with low standard people who are only there to create nuisance. Majorly couples who have got no sense of public decency. Museum is opened till early evening but is nothing much to write about. Overall something I would suggest to skip but very few would skip as it comes first in any itinerary for Kolkata
293,Places of couple,"you must enter by front door, dont walk around to side entrance, as no ticketing there. If short on time you may not find entering worthwhile, as mainly art in museum part and to see murals you have to able to climb up towards Dome to see them clearly.Best part for me."
294,Outstanding building,It was a great experience went for shoots and all... Such a calm and quiet place... 😇  a very fun place to chill out or spend nice quiet time with friends or alone... Beautiful architecturr ❤
295,Beautiful building unfortunately is not maintained properly,Beautiful from outside...if u r running short on time...i suggest a round trip from the outside is good enough...its pretty less than average from inside...most hotels n malls have better interiors
296,"Beautiful grounds, interesting museum","Last year on the 19th of October at 2:15 a.m., I reached the Indira Gandhi International Airport (in Delhi) to catch my flight for Kolkata. I felt both excited and nervous as I had never traveled on my own before then. I reached after couple of hours and did my work and reached Victoria memorial I was amazed by the beauty of Victoria memorial.The beauty of the architecture of Victoria Memorial is far-famed which makes it one of the best places to visit in Kolkata. So, I decided to go there first.  Made up of white Makrana marble and encircled by beautiful gardens, this museum is constructed in the memory of Queen Victoria."
297,Looking back amidst nature,"If you are near the area, definitely try to make time for visiting this place. Best to visit before evening. Also when going, ask for the entrance area, as there is entry allowed from only certain points."
298,"Stunning architecture, long queues",Surrounded with pine trees and mountains valley with a little water body. The valley is lush green some time the trees are covered with fogg. And some time it’s sunny.
299,A must,Went there for a photoshoot....great place.... really well maintained...Amazing landscape...They have changed a lot from the look which we saw in our childhood days.
