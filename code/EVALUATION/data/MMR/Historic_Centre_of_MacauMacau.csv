0,Excellent exploring,Winding streets and colonial architecture make for a stimulating heritage adventure - with plenty of cafes etc to take a break
1,MUST SEE no-1 in Macau,"The place can get crowded but the European architecture and the Chinese culture make for a very interesting venue and, if you're into history, this is a fascinating place to visit"
2,"Take your time to visit, don't book a rushed tour",If in Macau you should find the time to walk the Historic Centre. Lots of shops and restaurants. It’s a busy location so watch your valuables.
3,"Day 1, KLIA-Macau",Very picturesque and full of sights and sounds. Shopping everywhere and historical monuments. I really enjoyed my day in this area. Come early in the morning less people and not as hot!
4,How could you not come here?? It is a must-come place,"It is crowded and a shopping haven but it is also the best place to see the old buildings preserved, and in use, instead of just being devoted as museums, as is usually done. I go there primarily for the currency exchange, as they usually have higher rates compared to those near the Lisboa area. There is also the yummiest pork bun in one of the alleys leading to the St Paul ruins."
5,Lovely buildings,really enjoyable time walking down the tiny streets full of well maintained old fashion Portuguese style houses. Vibrant business and commerce offering almost unlimited kind of products. Great restaurants and lots of shops to buy traditional souvenirs.
6,A bit of Portugal in China,"This area is always very busy, but there are many shops and historic attractions to see, which makes it a must visit when you come to Macau. There is some very good street food in this area as well."
7,Nice to look around,"the street is really bussy and crowded with many people, but insteresting for exploring. walking around this place is very fun"
8,so crowded!,"It's an easy walk wherein you can find restaurants, boutiques, old churches.  It's clean, safe, although in some occasions like when we went there there was a festival, so there were many people around and like any place you just have to watch your personal belongings."
9,Interesting Area,"Macau is not only cazinos! The all area is ideal for a walk, there are a lot of old european buildings, stone streets and you can enjoy the serenity and the architecture. The best way to learn about this -ex portugal colony- city. Don;t miss it!"
10,I do not understand the Unesco,the portuguese origins. Charming and historical buildings. Some interesting museums in between.Attracts me more than all this artificial and crowded casino area
11,Ditch the casino and come here!,"Wonderful juxtaposition of the Portuguese buildings with the Asian, really different and interesting to visit. Lots of shops selling traditional food and wares."
12,A Beautiful Facade,All part of visiting Macau and seeing the buildings and side markets. Hub of activity on a Saturday and lots of shopping opportunities
13,Just the front of the church,This is a must win on Macau to walk around the cobblestone streets and enjoy the mixture of styles of architecture. Definitely stop to see the ruins of Saint Pauls Cathedral. There are many shops to look in.
14,Must try Sei Kee Cafe pork chop bun while you are there,"Some interesting places in a quick walk. Heritage places, and definitely cheaper than Shoppes at the casinos!!"
15,Macau's Landmark!!!,"Really enjoyed a couple hours downtime wandering the old streets here. Scenic mix of colonial with evolving, some quiet areas amidst the bustle of this city. There was one street full of food vendor stalls of every description, loved it but still manageable to see on a short time schedule."
16,A Visit to Macau's History,There are enough shops and history in a very small area to keep teenagers and parents satisfied. There are a few markets in the area with the copy  t-shirts and bits and pieces. . There’s a couple of gelato bars and places to buy a drink but I’m not too sure about eating from the local places.
17,Reminded me of the Spanish Steps in Rome,Narrow streets full of people. Here you will find mansions and churches preserved for all to see. A good place to wander
18,Interesting to see historic centre,"Easy access to everywhere, hotels, shopping and St Paul are all within walking distance. A lot of buses around as well."
19,A historical site and icon of Macau,"Except for the weather, nothing to complain about. Some great architecture, with lot of shops around and plenty of options to eat. One of the highlights of our stay in Macau"
20,Great for a half day (from Macau) to full day (from Hong Kong) exploration by foot,Lovely buildings and atmosphere. Like being in the centre of a smaller Mediterranean city. Lots of attractions close to each other.
21,Old church,It is an nice place where you can really see the mix of tje Chinese and Portugese cultures come a life.
22,Fantastic Portuguese-Chinese cultural fusion,Interesting to see the history of Macau as well as the more modern casino stripLiked the old cobbled streets. Lots of bakeries and pharmacies
23,Not what we expected ,Yes the impressive restored Portuguese architectural buildings and flavour is evident and impressive both day and evening. Try the Portuguese egg tarts !!!
24,"Worth walking around, go early!",Enjoyed the architecture and history of the lovely place.  Vibrant and colourful.with people everywhere.  The local food was amazing.
25,Thanks to god.,"This picturesque area is bustling with shoppers and tourists on the weekend.  However, it is well worth a visit to see the historic buildings and attractive architecture.  Many of these buildings now house up market shops."
26,The real reason why you should visit Macau,A good time pass to shop around. Near the city center. Lot of restaurants nearby. Good public transportation provided
27,The remarkable ruins,"The Historic Centre is perhaps the highlight of our visit to Macau.  So wonderful to spend half a day walking in the area, which is a good mixture of old buildings, eateries, small shops and sidewalk stalls.  From the Grand Emperor Hotel, we entered Senado Square and started on the walk. First, St Dominic's Church and the Cathedral, then we had lunch at the Boa Mesa Restaurant.  After lunch,  we went up to the St Paul's Ruins, passing many snacks and souvenirs shops.  A very pleasant way to see the old Macau.  Visitors will be amazed when they reflect on the many changes that have transformed Macau into a modern gambling mecca!"
28,O Moon souvenir shops in the World Heritage area,"Old Macau is stunningly beautiful and it is such fun to wander the historic alleyways aimlessly. The juxtaposition of this against the prominent newer casino hotels blighting the skyline is also quite surreal. Be aware that whilst a must visit, the small streets become oh so crowded with the tourist hordes - best to turn off the main streets and explore the quieter backstreets."
29,Portuguese architecture,I enjoyed walking around the historic centre and seeing the different buildings with Portugese influence. Very nostalgic feels.There's no entrance fee in the area and there are street food and restos everywhere...
30,Overcrowded,This is a decent central place to hangout.You can view tuck shops inside and do some shopping as well while enjoying the historic places built long back.
31,Very photogenic on a sunny day. It takes you from Asia to Europe,"When I think of any old city like this I envision something more European with little restaurants and bars, great places to hang out and people watch over a pint. Well Hong Kong and Macau aren’t much of a drinking culture. After walking through all the old Macau stops (I wrote down a list from an advertised tour) we didn’t pass a single bar/restaurant/pub. Guessing it’s a zoning/legal thing but had I known, we would not have gone there, after a couple historic sites there’s really nothing to do there except go back to the overpriced casino where it also seems frowned upon to drink."
32,City Centre is busy place and every person visits ,"If you want to see what there is to see beyond the Casinos this is a great place to take in what Macau has to offer.  Architecture, shops, stone work and just lots to look at.  Walk around the surrounding area as well as there is a lot to see outside of the main square."
33,Must See in Macau,"the most touristy place of Macau! but great to feel the history and see the other side of the city life behind the luxury of the casino area. Eat samples of meats and cookies in all the shops, and just a cool vibe overall, but sooooo crowded!"
34,Worth to visit,"historic buildings, shopping, fantastic views of macau and you can feel you are in another place (like a caribean island) due to the architecture of downtown"
35,Great day out,I love the floor and all the architecture of Macau. There is also lots to see at all those store on the side of the road. Must Visit if you are in Macau. there is a small water fountain near by as well.
36,heart of Macau ,"Historic Portuguese streets and buildings, little shops and alleys, small restaurants, pubs, park squares, all fun to explore."
37,Great view and a must visit if you are sightseeing in Macau,Very nice walking around area with beautiful architecture and interesting sights.   Eat at a local restaurant like “A Vencadora” for a great day.
38,Beautiful Area,"Walking through the historic centre of Macau was quite refreshing, the architecture is very old school and blend really good with some modern designs. The streets were very clean and the people are very nice. Felt very comfortable and safe walking around the city."
39,Macau and its past,"It is very walkable and very clean. Lots of shops, ice cream stores, and coffee houses. Interest old or old looking buildings. Also, we felt very safe. Macau has more than just casinos, so you should give the historic center of Macau sometime during your visit."
40,Ruins of St Paul,"This area is a great combination of both history and the ability to shop!  With the ruins of St. Paul's as a backdrop, you can wander down the stairs to explore sculptures, architecture with a definite european (Portugese) flair, and then sample some of the goodies at bakeries, or shop at a Skechers store.  It's all right there.  We got off the main path a bit and there's even more history, with at least two more catholic cathedrals to explore.  Wonderful place to spend some time when in Macau."
41,Beautiful old town!,"The historical centre goes to show that Macau has more than just casinos. Interesting sites, interesting food. Not to missed"
42,2019 Vacation,Shame that they have turned every building into a tourist trap...but very centrally located and one would  go pass if walking around the old town.
43,This is a Chance to see Macau as it was originally Built,"second time visiting the old quarter and a great experience sampling the food of traditional Portuguese and Asian, taking in the  sights along the way. A bit too commercialised these days though compared to our first visit a few years ago."
44,a bit of Europe,"Macau has a small historic center , built by the Portuguese, it’s nice to spend a couple of hours strolling around the old town, and sample the famous Portuguese egg tart , and street food ,"
45,Take a walk in Europe while in Asia!,"The historic center of Macau has a lot to offer, and is easily explored by foot, included Saint Paul's Ruins, the Fortress and the Macau Museum, and many beautiful temples and plazas."
46,Old Macau for the tourist,Great area to walk in. Cobbled streets. Would recommend comfortable shoes and wearing sunscreen. Packed with people.
47,Very mixed feelings.,"We walked and enjoyed the many fresh noodle places, Macau is a great city to explore. We hired a guide at the ferry terminal, he took us around and showed us the best of Macau."
48,Charming Macau,It’s a typical city centre with plenty of people walking around.  There are shops and restaurants all around.  Nothing special.
49,Beautiful,"Very crowded but very cool! Feels like you are in an old European City due to the architecture, Neat area to walk through."
50,Decent Place,"It is a must so go anyway, and it is nice to see some old Macao, but strangely it has many shops but not many cafe and restaurants so don’t expect to have many nice place to sit, drink and people watch"
51,Busy,"The pilgrimage to the ruins was very crowded. This historic centre is commercialised and lined with retailers on either sides.  Good for appreciation of the architecture and the churches in the area. Post visit, you can walk to local eateries in the area. Shopping wise, there's a Yaohan departmental store within 10 mins walk."
52,all in short walking distance,I loved the historic centre with most of the heritage buildings still holding their original portuguese names.  Its a site to see.
53,A must see for anyone with an interest in history,"I love the atmosphere and historical buildings around the Senado Square. The stone pavements, historical building, streets and St. Dominic's Church make it a great sight and interesting place to stroll around. You can get a good photography spot of the Senado Square from the balcony of the Holy House of Mercy by visiting their museum (MOP5/entry)."
54,A must go and a Nice walk,Macau bears a lot of history with Portugese occupation and walking this historic city is a good way to experience it
55,What a disappointment!,"A lot of the Historic Centre is crammed with tourists, yes - like us, but unlike us with no manners. Unfortunately we have found this in so many places in S.E.Asia, and thought Macau would be more civilised. The otherwise lovely centre with the notable buildings is spoiled because of the emphasis on shopping, most of it for the Chinese customer, and a distinct lack of anywhere to get a cool drink and sit down!We are glad we were here for more than a day, so got to see some of the other sights outside the centre. And the casinos were of no interest to us, apart from one casino's free entertainment one evening!"
56,FUN to Explore!,"There is much to see and do in and around the Historic Centre of Macau. One could easily dedicate 2-3 days to comprehensively explore each of the 25 different UNESCO World Heritage attractions and other interesting attractions located within the area referred to as Macau World Heritage.

57,Great day out from Hong Kong,The World Heritage sites in the historic centre are quite spread out over the city and involve lots of walking to see. Great pamphlet with directions and maps from the Information Centre is essential. Take a few days and really appreciate it.
58,Old town of historic Macau ,"Macau truly comes alive here with crowds of people, shopping, food, historical sites, and always some fun displays.This is a must stop when in Macau.  Its a fun walk from many casinos.  Its a great place to grab quick food, take pictures, shoo, exchange money."
59,"""messy and sassy, what else do you want?""","Lots to see, too many people to enjoy comfortably Clean and safe May be better to avoid Saturday or Sunday"
60,Nice Historic Centre but very crowded and small,"This location is beautifully maintained with traditional & modern shops & eateries. Great for photos, shopping, eating and soaking up the atmosphere."
61,European influence but overcrowded ,"You can take a day trip (or two) from Hong Kong. The Historic Centre is the main tourist spot here. You can stroll along the narrow streets, enjoy local food and visit a couple of tourist sights available in the area. Also, you can take a bus to another island and walk inside luxurious hotels such as The Venetian."
62,European heritage,"The Historical Centre of Macau is a great place to visit with kids and give them an idea about the past, the presence of the Portuguese and the co-existence between Chinese and Portuguese. If your kid(s) loves history, it’s a place to visit: from the Senado Square to St Paul’s Ruins!"
63,Great Heritage Preserved,I really enjoyed walking around and taking photos. The streets were busy and atmospheric. I prefer this side of Macau to the flashing lights of the casinos. There are historic building to look at and excellent views to enjoy. I felt like I was in Europe and not Asia for the day.
64,Great to visit,"This is a lovely square with beautiful buildings, relatively well preserved. However, one has to come early to appreciate this place as it’s overrun with tourists."
65,Calm walks,Charming European style city centre from the days of the Portuguese  occupying the city. Colourful buildings and many lovely Chinese Bakeries with aircon and free samples. Would recommend the governor's house which houses a gallery.
66,Avoid the tourist areas,Upscale shops and restaurants in this European square in the heart of Macao. Nearby the beautiful ruins of St. Paul's as well. Truly a unique experience in Macao/China.
67,Loved It,There are lots of interesting buildings to see here and well worth going inside to visit those that you can.
68,Leal Senada - Fountain Square,A beautiful area of Macau - the mix of Portuguese architecture with Asian influences is absolutely stunning. Go early to avoid crowds.
69,Bustling historic area that is worth a visit,"We had a lovely day walking around this older part of Macau - it was much nicer than the ""Disneyland"" of Cotai which seemed so unreal...would recommend just walking around the older parts of Macau to see how the city really lives."
70,I love Macau!,"If you like the Portuguese architecture, you surely love it. The mosaics and various colors of buildings around this area are the mimic landmark of Portugal. The cleanliness and maintenance by the Macau Government makes it a must visit in Macau. It is worthwhile to stroll around the area and enjoy the friendliness and relaxing atmosphere."
71,Tour around historical Macau,I'd recommend visitors to walk around the Historic Center of Macau: the churches and small streets are special.
72,Senado Square,Good place to visit and get some custard tarts!! Both times we came it was very busy. You can walk all the way through to see the Ruins of St Paul
73,The real Macau,"If you ve been living in Asia for long, it is nice and surprising to see some old european architecture. Outside of that, the huge crowd makes it difficult to enjoy."
74,Good Colonial History,The little streets are really busy with lots of jerky and biscults on over. A nice lead up to the ruins.
75,Fantastic to see that Portuguese colonial cobblestone preserved,The Historic Centre of Macau is worth the visit.  It's a picture perfect area that was fun to explore.  Lots of little places to eat.  The fort and St. Pauls were perfect for tourist activities.
76,Please remove the rubbish decorations,"We enjoyed walking around the old city area, visiting the shops and eating the local delicacies like egg tarts. Much nicer than the casinos."
77,This is the reason to visit Macau,Nice place to visitRecommend to check out the churches in the areaCan be busy at times but worthwhile the visitCombine with a visit to the Ruins of St. Paul
78,Too crowd ,"Older part of Macau this quaint Portuguese styled buildings, best way to get to one of the main highlights the ruins of St Paul's.  Pretty much all the same stuff in all the shops."
79,"Nice and colourful, but traffic jams are awful",The historical old town represents the real history and story of Macau. Despite the crowd and cookies seller all over the place a walk through all small lanes reminds me Europe.
80,The heart of Macau,"I love Macau!  It's not only a city to go for gaming but also for some cultural heritage sites.  Macau is for gambling but Taipa, the other island, has beautiful old homes formerly occupied by the Macanese people.  The casinos are more grandiose, more opulent and larger than Las Vegas. Of course, the odds for winning are the same.  There's great restaurants and street food.  Senado Square is the center of activity and the ruins of St Paul is picturesque, worthy of an Instagram photo.  The old village of Taipa is charming and lots of places to eat and shop.  It's more laid back than Macau.  The boulevard that's behind the casinos facing the bay is a nice place to take a stroll and to view of Taipa is worth a selfie. The only negative experience I had are the rude and mean taxi drivers who don't even speak a word of English and are money hungry.  I don't know why this is. But despite the rude taxi drivers, my husband and I had a nice experience in Macau"
81,Must visit in Macau,lots of tourist and good food if you want to avoid the crowds go early in the morning around 8am or at night at 9pm onwards but those time not all shops are open but quieter with less crowds and great for taking photos
82,The fusion of cultures,"Our first time in Macau and we enjoyed the stroll along the old streets of Macau.  Lots to see, eat, shop.  The place was surprisingly clean, compared to HK.  The black and white cobble stoned walkways seemed intact and original, facade of old building were nice. There is a range of food choices and drinks along the streets.  Bring comfortable walking shoes."
83,Our favourit part of Macau,"Even if you had seen the names of the roads written in Portuguese you feel the influence as we go around the area. The architecture, churches and the cobbled roads provide a old time feeling. Only issue is the sheer crowd :( and it appears too many shops are being opened to cater to tourists changing the atmosphere to a feel is it a shopping mall strip"
84,The old town,This historic area is bustling with activity and a heavy dose of Portuguese/Chinese history.  Take your time- it can be very crowded and hot (and it poured the day we were there).  Take breaks and don't forget to get samples from the shops!
85,Heritage of the past centuries,"It gets really crowded but the place is always nice either way. There are shops lined up here so if you are up for shoes, cosmetics, food and clothes...its right here!tip: if you wanna shop cheap go around the small streets behind the senado square, there are a lot of to chose from there."
86,Portuguese influence on Macau,"This area is simply stunning and the buildings are simply divine. We're not into shopping so we just absorbed the atmosphere and the beauty of the stoned pavements, the buildings and the churches. Definitely another ''must do""."
87,Old Europe in Modern Asia,"The old city centre of Macau is a unique synthesis of Chinese and Portuguese architecture. Strolling around the cobblestoned alleys is an interesting experience. Unfortunately some parts of the city, especially the area between the Ruins of St. Paul's and Largo do Senado, are totally occupied by tour groups and tourist traps selling kitsch souvenirs. To enjoy the beauty of the former Protuguese colony, go for less crowded neighborhoods like St. Lazarus Quarter."
88,"Great architecture, shops and the real Macau",Get away from the tourist hot spots and explore the streets between St Paul’s and the lighthouse site. The old Portuguese style streets are beautiful. We found some great quiet cafes and restaurants.
89,Portugal fading away...,"This is the bustling square for a typical European city. Given its Portuguese roots, I am therefore not surprised to find such a place.Definitely worth a walk around. You will find many shops selling knick knacks and food. There are also money changers to cater to those who need to exchange money to eat and shop at this area."
90,Must visit,Thanks to god. This is the classic macau attraction. Many mainland tourists like to take picture here. It is very crowded during vacations.
91,Best part of Macao,Such a nice atmosphere! Living in Shanghai/ Hong Kong over 3 years in Macau you really don’t feel you are in China or South East Asia. It is a lovely old city with lots of heritage from Portuguese. This is our 2nd time in Macau & I think I can never get bored of this city.
92,Nice to see...,"A historical site and icon of Macau. Usually full of visitors.  Suggested to visit the Macau Museum and the terrace together, they are nearby. A night visit is also good as not so many people and avoid sun heat in day time."
93,Interesting for a day trip!,Highly recommend to visit Macau and experience the unique and historical place that is a combination of both the Portuguese world and China.
94,Best part of our trip,I went around here the other day. There are many great sights to see here and it's a busy area. The ruins is here and the old fort. Many other sites to see.
95,Worth a visit,"This was an unexpected area, different from the rest of Macau.  A bit crowded when we visited but it was interesting exploring some of the side roads rather than just sticking to the main areas."
96,Don't Miss this Inspite of the Crowd,I really liked it here. All the old building and shutters in south-Europe style. There are small shops with drinks and some souvenirs. Only if there are fewer people...
97,Well preserved historic area,It's a great pleasure to walk around historical part of Macau.The buildings are very beautiful in old Portuguese style. I highly recommend everyone to walk there.
98,Amazing ,Beautiful to see this historic city is preserving it's colonial architecture including the designs in the cobblestone sidewalks and public squares. Captivating!
99,Portuguese & local history,"It is a nice place but enough to visit one evening and one daytime. In my oppinion 1 day is enough to visit Macao, more is just for who plays in casino because the visiting options are small."
100,"Senoda square, great if you like shopping",This is a little bit of Europe in Asia. Originally designed and built by the Portuguese it is now a dynamic part of old Macau
101,Just wow,The historic centre of Macau is well kept and still have the ambience. Mainly Cantonese speaking residents and shop assistants you may find communications patchy. Selling rather simple food but tasty and retail outlets for browsing.
102,A huge and pleasent surprise,"If you are living around South East Asia, this attraction should not be missed. Walking around this area is like going to a whole new different place. It is not amazingly clean but the preservation of its building architecture, roads and walkways is just perfect to experience the European feeling - with the help of the cold air."
103,Bustling ,"We explored the historic area of Macau, which was across the water from where we were staying. Very interesting mix of architecture with Portuguese and Chinese influences. It was fun to just walk around and watch the people."
104,Good place to walk through,"It reminds me like I were in a small town of Portugal. Building are well conservated, clean streets, not so croudy, plenty of nice places offering good food in every corners, several parks, and good atmosphere. It takes not so manytime to visit it."
105,Great Atmosphere,Love all the beautiful architecture of the Portuguese buildings in Macau. We went on a pedicab tour around Macau main island. Well worth experiencing and exploring on one of these! We also went to the other island to a Portuguese town. Stunningly beautiful and the colors were amazing. Most favorite part of Macau. See photos 😁
106,Festive,This is the obligatory visit you have to make when in the old part of Macau. Lots of things to see and eat.
107,Lovely square,Fascinating blend of cultures and styles. Macau was a Portuguese colony and the influence and style still in evidence. Get off the casino streets and into old Macau for the real flavor of the cite. Historical signage sharing the early history in multiple languages. Nicely done! Very close to the facade of the Jesuit Church established there in the 1600s. Great walking tour. Easy to access from the free casino shuttles.
108,25 World Heritage attractions and much more to see and do,While being in Asia for 7 months for work it made me happy to see this “part of Portugal” and its type of buildings with colorful walls.
109,Fascinating!,"There is literally nothing special at all about the ""historic centre"" of Macau.  The museum was okay and fairly cheap but all of the buildings highlighted on the historic walking tour of Macau were average at best (I did like the Mandarin House).  Also, even if its extremely hot with 100% humidity you must be wearing pants if you want to enter the Churches."
110,Great for a meander,"There are lots of hidden gems if you get off the big streets and into the smaller streets and alleyways. From murals on walls to cute cafes or local artisans, it pays to get off the beaten path! It’s a bit of a rabbit warren, but worth it if you have the time to get lost!"
111,Take a walk!,"A must while in Macau was to see some of what I had heard was the old Portuguese Charm. Most of the old area of Macau is centered on this area. The city has done much to redo the streets, keep the buildings in good shape, and there are some touristy stores that do have some unique fare for Macau. You definitely have to check this place out if you want to see how Macau had existed for hundreds of years before recent modernization"
112,Old Macau - a world away from the dubious casino scene,"Walking around Senado Square and then to the Ruins of St Paul’s Church brought back memories of our walk on the Camino de Santiago only its a whole lot shorter, roads here are narrow and extremely crowded. Interesting to find a pice of Europe in China! It’s worth a visit."
113,Love this place,Too crowd. We were there in weekday and there was packed with tourists. Hardly find a proper restaurant there. Visit once is enough!
114,Beautifully restored old Macau now recognized by UNESCO,"Nice place to take a photo, near this place there are some tourist place like Dominic chucrch, Senado Square"
115,Lots of history,We stumbled across this area by accident. It was hectic. So busy. It is filled with character with older buildings and as mentioned these beautiful paved streets.
116,senado square,"Busy everywhere, but worth you while, nice shopping eating and lots more. Transport easy to get to, taxi's are reasonable."
117,Old Macau,"The place is full of beautiful historical buildings. At the same time, it is also a shopping area with clothes, cosmetic goods, jewelry and also street food. Only 5-minute walk to the ruins of St. Paul."
118,Step back into history,"It was raining when we visited, and very crowded - just getting around fm one place to the other in the centre was tough - the jams were awful!"
119,Nice and Clean,We booked a tour of the historic centre of Macau but found it too rushed to appreciate fully. The short time we were there gave us a wonderful experience of a Portuguese-Chinese blend. We recommend to arrive in the morning around 9 am and to combine with a visit to the casino area by nightfall.
120,Visit to Macau to See Historic Center,"Macau disappointed me somehow, I was reading a little bit about the history of Macau and expected much more than I saw. Make sure you take a walk in the small streets around. I enjoyed to explore the city on this way much more. The main street is full with fancy shops etc. and is crowded, everything looks so posed. Well I hope you are able to enjoy the city more than me."
121,Great History,This is the remaining part of the church. Crowded with people just taking photo. A exhibition hall to show some of items form the old church and history. Don't miss the watch and clock museum around the corner. Actually there was more interesting thing to see in the museum if you like watches and clocks.
122,Nice festival decoration,"A nice tour. The historical center of Macau is small. The tour can be done in one day. A good option to return to the past of Portuguese architecture. Mandatory passage on this tour is the ruins of St. Paul's Cathedral. Another option is to visit some spaces at night, as the night lighting gives another charm to the streets and monuments."
123,Avoid local holidays,Amazing history and brilliant photo opportunity here! Well worth the visit but make sure you engage a guide ( preferably Aubrey ) so you get the most information and history possible.
124,Early evening stroll,"If your visiting Macau as a tourist, then the old part of Macau would be a great place to visit and see the San Malo area, St. Paul's Ruins and the back streets. But be warned, it is Crowded most of the time, and noisy."
125,Crowded But A Good Walk,u can discover all by urself - no guided tour needed as it's all close by each other. most sightseeing places have public wifi as well
126,Preserved Beauty ,While this is a bit touristy - and a bit small - it was still worth visiting this small historic center.  My understanding it was built by the Portuguese and there's a lot of variety and just fun to walk around - doesn't take long to stroll up and down - try a few street food - like the teas and waffle cones with ice cream :)  Don't have to spend a lot of time here but just good to at least visit.
127,Cultural jump,"The whole day getting around the whole place enjoying Historical Marks,getting delicious food,Enjoying taking photos"
128,Lots of great architecture,Walking on the streets of Historic Centre of Macau takes you back in time and even continent and you feel as if you are walking on the streets of an European city. This part of the town provides good walking/touring experience with many historical sites to visit.
129,Crowded but well maintained,An area of Macau with multiple historical items all in close proximity. The village itself is an eclectic mix of old Portuguese architecture in quaint little streets
130,The floor is so pretty,Visited Macau solely for the world’s highest bungee jump but never expect the historical sites available also surprised me!
131,"Small, but a beautiful piece of history",this is the Macau's land mark and historic place you must visit when you are in Macau. there is a fort which tell's you the story of the fort which equipped with plenty of cannons.
132,Nice place to spend the afternoon,"Portugese architecture, nice place, lot of tourist, colourful place, egg tart is must, the place has its own historical importance for people of macau."
133,Nothing Special,We visited Macau for a day excursion to specifically to visit the Historic center of Macau.  This part of the town has buildings that are left from when Macau was a Portuguese colony.  We found out that bus 3 could drop us off at Senado Square.  We spent a few minutes at the square and then walked up to the Ruins of Paul's.  We passed the St. Dominic's Square and visited the beautiful St. Dominic's Square.  There are lots of stalls to get snacks.  I ate a pork chop sandwich and one of inf the famous Portuguese egg tarts.  I enjoyed visiting this part of town and trying some of the local foods.
134,A Pilgrimage,"Wonderfully rebuild historic portuguese-style city center of Macau peninsula ! Very lively , clean , safe and never boring..."
135,A piece of history,"The basic place is absolutely gorgeous, why put up cheap, large, gaudy, disposable decorations to spoil the view?"
136,A good day trip but no more....,"Nice to see a piece of 1600 era of Europe in a faraway place in China now called Macau. Worth the visit and be lost wandering around the streetsMany places to visit, the cathedral and the other historical buildings"
137,I was hoping for more...,"The Centre has always been crowded with tourists whenever I get the chance to visit.  This time I started in Senado Square and wandered all the way to the Guia Fortress.  The crowds thinned out the farther away as I got away from the main tourists attractions.  What I liked to see were the brightly colored, historic buildings that gave a nice European flair.  Many like the churches, post office building, etc were open for touring inside.  Markers outside the buildings helped provide more background about the building history and importance.  In addition to the buildings there were a lot of shops to do both window shopping and buying and restaurants and stalls to take in the smells and tastes of the local cuisine."
138,A step into Lisbon,"Due to revenues from casinos Macau managed to transform itself from quite a nasty/dirty place into a seriously picturesque place. The renovations have transformed the place and it's certainly worthwhile strolling around and discovering what the town has to offer in food, architecture, etc. Be mindful of the weather though - it was hot."
139,Second Best Thing in Macau,"There are too many visitors. If you choose to go early morning, you may feel better to have a historical walk among the old buildings or ruins. Especially when you go up to the top, there are many pastry shops selling almond biscuits and egg rolls. It’s quite challenging to ignore them and the free tasting."
140,Take a couple of hours to walk around,"The centre of Macau was a welcome reality check to the contrived opulence of the Cotai Strip. If you look carefully, you can still see where and how East and West originally met."
141,Very busy on the weekend,"Although we knew bout the Portuguese influence in this peninsula we were not prepared for how much there was. The architecture, food, religion and culture is everywhere interspersed with Chinese elements as well. Take the time to walk around and don’t forget to look up as well! A lot happens above head level which often gets missed."
142,everyone comes here,"Usually lots of people in the weekend, the concierge of hotel that i stayed in suggest this place i'm a fan of Portuguese structures and culture this place has a nice view!"
143,3 hours is really all you need,"Authentic, romantic, historic, interesting old town, lots of local delicacies and souvenir shop.  Free to sample their famous almond cookies, egg rolls, barbecue pork and local pastries."
144,Wander for a couple hours,This is the first place i’ve seen aside from the ferry terminal when we arrive in macau.. everything is just WOW with their christmas decorations and the busy people just taking pictures and smiling happily..
145,Surprising,As this is very popular and one of the must see tourist attractions it is very crowded. Most interesting building is on top of the hill. Otherwise small streets are full of small shops mainly for tourists. But anyhow i recommend to visit the area.
146,An unexpected treat.,"If the weather turns very cold, one would really think that you are in Europe walking around the old buildings and cobble streets.nice place to walk around with lots to see and do"
147,Walking area,Macau is probably one of the biggest surprises when visiting a new place. Get lost on the streets of Macau and discover the people and their beautiful culture. The little stores can hide treasures so don't hesitate and get in various stores food or furniture. This place is a huge inspiration.
148,Adventure,"Although Ruin of St. Paul's might be the no 1 photographed place, this is a must visit (in a way, it is connected and the same. You can start from the Ruin and walk all the way to Largo do Senado/Senade square or go reverse).In addition to UNESCO listed historic buildings and churches of colonial Portugal, there is a lot of opportunity for people watching, tasting local snacks and proper meal. One can do generous sampling of snacks followed by buying at  Koi Kei Bakery (main one is at Senade square but you will see its branches all across Macau. Narrow roads with a lot of traffic; it can be as European as it can be in Asia. But it is very safe and pickpocket is very rare. No ISIS or terrorists in Macau."
149,Great place to stroll around,I strolled in the old town Great place I ate a Portuguese cake Lots of people especially for the first Saturday is not recommended to visit these days
150,"Historical,Relax,Enjoy Places of Macau",I loved to walk around in the old city. I gave me a feeling to be back in Europe. But very very crowded with mainly Asian people there and mostly restaurant with Chinese food. We made a daytrip from Hong Kong. Easy to travel around by taxi and we never paid more than € 5. We could pay everywhere with Hong Kong dollars.
151,Simply Stunning - You Won't Want to Leave,"Nice and stunning in the evening. It was no hustle  crowded than in the afternoon, so I could take more picture. I tried some  and drinks juice, Portuguese egg tart, nougat, etc. Delicious but pricey. Ok it is touristic area. A must visit area in Macau. Walking by yourself is enough, you do not need a tour guide."
152,Interesting Mix of Cultures,"It is nice town with many things to see and food to taste, it is good for afternoon visit if the weather permit"
153,You don’t feel you are actually in China,"We visited the Macau museum, the Ruins of St Pauls. Lots of people as you would expect. There are public toilets here which is helpful. Nice views from the top."
154,Spring Break 2018,"My second time in Macau. The old town is very beautiful, a bit crowded but nice. Don’t miss the street food in the alleys. It’s especially nice around Christmas with all the lights and trees."
155,Historic ,"Many type of food, delicious. Great view, the buildings are beautiful. many tourist police around the city."
156,A nice place to spend an hour or two,"After two weeks in China this was quite a cultural change, even after intermediate stop in Hong Kong. The old part of the city is quite charming, Portugese style will prevail at least until 2049 - but actually the mix with Chinese elements makes the place even more charming!"
157,Fascinating Architecture - lots of shops to explore,"Best to take photos half way up the steps. It is impressive and well worth the visits. Hence, the amount of tourist during August month. Very inspiring to see the Ruins of St Paul’s!"
158,Historically amazing,"Spent an enjoyable day walking around the historic area of Macau; highlights included the ruins of St Pauls, Senado Square, the Lou Kau mansion and the Mount Fortress. Great little food and drink outlets abound in the narrow side streets. Area is easily accessed by bus (No. 3 bus) from the Maritime Terminal, arriving there by the red TurboJet from Central Hong Kong.If you want to visit the casinos, they are present on the south of the island, or take another day and another ferry (the Blue one) to the lower island, the Ilhas Islands, where more abound. We didn't, with the historic town enough  for our day. Wear good walking shoes?"
159,Portuguese Architecture,If you are visiting Macau for pleasure don't spend all your time in the gambling and neon palaces that abound in this small territory. Old Macao has been beautifully preserved and is well worth a stroll.
160,Step back in time but with modern shopping !!!,"We visited the Historic Center of Macau on our recent visit. The renovated parts of the city are quite nice, and should definitely be visited, but a couple of streets past the center and you'll find the old run-down parts of Macau. 3 hours is more than enough to see the whole of the Historic center."
161,A little bit of Portugal in Asia - nice to wonder around see the colorful buildings and historic sites,We visited the historic centre of Macau as part of our overall walking tour of the old city. It is certainly steeped in history and is certainly worth the visit. Many interesting old shops and stalls. Recommended.
162,macau’s center,"Let's be honest, you don't come to Macau just to see it's historic city centre! It's small but nonetheless it's nice and worth a visit, especially if you're from the Far East and not normally used to seeing Mediterranean/ European style places, so please go and enjoy the buildings, small streets and atmosphere. In 2-3 hours you should have seen it all. Enjoy."
163,Most popular place in town,"I love Portugal and visit the colonial remains of this country, than Macau was on my list, but now I think, it was a waist of time. The ruins of church was the only thing here, to show the Portuguese heart... The streets are too Chines, Asian, nothing remain from the Portuguese feeling... nor the nata, it's fake with pudding, not an eggcream. The best part was the casinos (replicas of Las Vegas)... and some colonial buildings (theater of Pedro V. and town hall) find them with magnifying glass."
164,Tour,"This was as is described, the facade of an old building.  There is a crypt downstairs and a museum of collectables at the back.  We enjoyed the latter as it was air-conditioned!"
165,Rewarding walk in old Macau!,"The old town in the Macau peninsula is by far the highlight of the city.I went to Macao from HK for a day trip (travelling with the quick but bumpy ferry from Sheung Wan terminal) I spend 5 hours wandering around the ole streets, visiting heritage buildings - both Portugueses and Chinese styles. With a map, you can easily to that in half day as it is quite concentrated.I finished my day on the other side - Taipa island.While the Taipa village also offers a glimpse on the old life there, this is overshadowed by the casino development.While it is worth seeing for yourself the Venetian Casino and the Grand Canal-theme shopping mall, I regretted not being able to finish the night in the old town too."
166,The architecture is so different ,"O Moon is a local souvenir shop that started in Macau in 2016 and now has four branches around the city including two in the Macau World Heritage area, one along Ave. Cinco de Outubro and one in Taipa Village. Opening hours are around 10am to 7 or 8pm depending on the branch.These are cute shops, blue-and-white in colour like Portuguese style tiles offering a range of Portuguese and Macau inspired souvenirs and related products. The walls are neatly decorated with skyline images of important Macau heritage sights like the Ruins of St. Paul's. The O Moon shops have their signature Moons setup for photo taking as well. Don't hesitate to snap a few pics during your visit, they don't mind."
167,Experience Portugal,"Come to Macau and not visit the historic centre would be a most ridiculous decision ever made! hahaThis place is bustling with people, just about any day of the week, but MORE SO during weekends, esp Sunday!Tons of shopping, eateries too, so you wont be bored for sure.With massive numbers of people, taking photos can be a challenge though.Food is not cheap here, as one might expect of a touristy place.Nonetheless, a happening place to be!!"
168,Wonderful World Heritage sites,"What a wonderful place. Caught a cab from the Ventian, then explored. The nicest place I went to out of Hing Kong, Macau and Shenzen. Just tremendous, the cobble stones, the old church and fort.  Walked back the ferry terminal from here, probably took a half hour."
169,Blended architectural styles,It was a very nice discovery and we were quite surprised. It is a mix of portuguese-chinese culture and environment. It is like a south-east Asian city with an European touch. Full of places to see
170,Euro Feel,Way too crowded with some streets being shoulder to shoulder...but you can’t say you’ve been to Macau without visiting the historic center
171,Good place for shop around,"There is only one word for this site, ""MUST SEE no-1"" in Macau. Every tourism area, city, country has a local characteristic, a symbol for the place. 'Ruin of St. Paul' College is a brand-mark of Macau. You shall take a photo in this place and show it to your friends & relatives."
172,Back to the history,"Usually when somebody is mentioning Macau/Macao 9 out of 10 people are thinking of casinos -"" Vegas of the east "" , gambling and party. Well this review is not about that side of Macau - but about the old town, the historical center of this beautiful city. Here are some items you should consider when visiting Macau: - the Historical center is part of the UNESCO Heritage sites and as such it was preserved in its state with the Portuguese colonial style buildings.- the narrow streets of Macau old center are still today houses, restaurants,bakeries and shops.- in old town you have quite a number of landmarks to visit - to list some:    1. Ruins of St. Pauls.    2. St. Dominic's Church    3. Senado Square. - it very interesting for those who love history and architecture. And here comes the recommendation - get a guide so you can get the most out of your tour. - as you walk through the streets you have a lot of options to enjoy a coffee in the old colonial style coffee shops - grab a snack at bakeries, dine in one of the many traditional restaurants (when I say traditional I refer to places that have more 100 years of history behind them ). - be prepared is always crowded - tourist from all over the world are flocking here to grab a piece of old Macau as a memory - so be patient. Overall is a great experience - I recommend when planning a visit to Macau include the historical center on your to do list."
173,Good place for an afternoon,I go there because of the architecture and the floors! The designed floors by the traditional Portuguese black and white granite blows your mind.
174,Interesting. ,"It was also relaxing and have a good feeling visiting historical places, such the landmark of Macau and always feel good to sit down somewhere for a cup of coffee or a bowl of local noddles"
175,Very popular amongst the tourists,It's just amazing to visit this place. We see only the front portion of the wall which is the remains of the church ruined by fire. You should never miss visiting the whole place. It reminds of how beautiful the church would have been before it got ruined. One should not miss visiting this place when they visit Macau.
176,Good walk,"Haven't visited for close to 20 years dreading the glitzy new reclamation . Happy to see north with its historic heart remains, as does the southern end of the island. Far more charming, only 10km / 15 mins drive apart. This is where the fashion and shoe outlets reside too"
177,A piece of Southern Europe in Asia,"After the Panda Pavilion, the second best thing to do in Macau is go to the Historic Center. Everyone goes here and the place was packed when we got there. Coming down the steps from the Ruins of St. Paul’s Church and into the busy streets are a sight you won’t soon forget. Really worth the time and effort."
178,Beautiful but busy,"The very centre of Macau. Indvis surrojnded by historic, Portuguese-style buildings including the Senate Building, St. Dominic’s Church and within a short walk from the Cathedral and the iconic St. Paul’s Ruin."
179,A nice tour ,"The entire place is Season ready for Christmas. The Christmas flowers are in full bloom and the huge decors are lined up and high, too bad though we did not go at night to the lights lit."
180,Super Crowded But a must see area when in Macau,"You can gamble your life savings away practically anywhere, but you can only visit the remains of an old Portuguese church and fort here in Macau.  Plus, the whole area is full of narrow streets and small shops that are very inviting. We are so glad we visited."
181,Do go with enough time on hand,"Just an hour from HK on the Turbo ferry to Outer harbour, then grab a taxi and 10 minutes later you are in the Historic centre. Very picturesque, lots of tourists but lots to see. The area is well signposted and there is a choice of temples, churches, the museum and cathedral. Lots of shops and restaurants. We spent about 5 hours exploring and then got a taxi back for the 4.00pm ferry back to Hong Kong.Ferry cost was 160 HKD single and taxi 40 HKD.Most attractions are free."
182,Too crowded,"As the Chinese New Year was beginning, the decorations everywhere on the buildings were so bright and cheerful, so many people around, but the Senado Square, the surrounding old Portugese buildings were so nice. The ruins of St Paul's is amazing. This whole area was a joy to walk around."
183,Little Portugal in China,"Almost identical to Lisbon in parts (Obviously because it was a former Portugese colony).Perfect for a day from Hong Kong. Some interesting buildings and places to eat, but that's really about it!We spent the morning at the casinos on Cotai strip and the afternoon in the old part of Macau, no need to spend more than a day doing both (Unless you're here for the gambling!)The casinos free buses are an ideal way to get around and drop you at the Grand Emperor hotel, only a few minutes walk from the old town.Keep away from the main streets as much as possible, they are crowded with mostly Chinese tourists and you can't move in parts!"
184,Must visit while in Macau,"This was one of the most interesting tourist attraction. From the looks of it, it didn't seem like many visitors patronize this historical venue. This is one place I think that the bus load of people need to see and read about. The library was absolutely wonderful. We found an English section that we would have start for a few hours to just 'get away' but it was time for lunch."
185,Great view with delicious food,"From Senado Square to Ruins of St. Paul's to Mount Fortress - you'll be seeing the history of Macau.Here, you'll be visiting the historic center of Macau with European-styled buildings and Portuguese pavement.But don't forget to brace yourselves for a thick crowd. Went there before 7:00 AM to get good shots (without many tourists)."
186,Like a piece of old Europe,"We came to Macau for a day trip and headed here first.  It's a beautiful area and we loved seeing the architecture here.  But as everyone has said, its very busy!Plenty of places to eat and drink in the area.  You can walk from here to all of the other main sights such as Ruins of St Paul, St Lazarus Church, Monte Forte etc."
187,A little Portugal,"Enough has been said about this place. Just want to suggest pork chop bun from Sei Kee Cafe while you are there. This cafe is open 11am-7pm (closed on Tues) and is hidden at the end of a short alley between Luk Fook Jewellery and BCM Bank, opposite Koi. The pork chop bun is quite big and enough for lunch. They use real pork chop with bone. Add egg for even better taste. MOP30 each, add MOP8 for egg."
188,Good landmark of Macau,What not expecting to learn about the history of this area.Was invited to Macau by friend working for MGM and went on my own to enjoy the city. Great for walking.
189,Nice but crowded,We were a bit rushed and that's the only regret. It is so beautiful that one could spend more than a couple of hours here.Huge crowds are the only drawback.
190,Crowded but nice views.,This place has not changed much. Came here last in 2002 and this place still catches the historical value of the true old Macau.
191,"A bit crowded, but a must!","The center has lot to do with portuguese arquitecture with mosaic and little stones that are joint together to create lovely designd in both streets and walls; nevertheless the contrast with new modern hotels is strong! moreover you do not find any portuguese around, the idea is that China took over completely"
192,European Style square,"I’m in Macau for the first time.  Always wanted to come here and go to Hong Kong often.  This is the “real” Macau and you must spend at least 2-3 hours wandering the streets and checking out many of the historic sites.  The combination of Chinese and Portuguese is wonderful and very unique.  Looking at some of the tiles streets, and seeing the signage in Portuguese, you’d think you were in Portugal.  Fun shopping streets, museums, lovely parks and restaurants all filled with locals and tourists  alike.  Leave the casinos and head straight here and absorb the local culture!"
193,Very busy ,even though we went there in February the weather was awesome but u only need to plan one day to go there and at the same time go try the sky walking at the macau tower and have tea at the 360 degree tea house in the top floor
194,Preserved Europe in China,I came here with my boyfriend and we walked all around this beautiful area. It was very busy especially because we went just 2 days before Chinese New Year— but that’s what made it more fun. The festivities around the holiday was very exciting.
195,Its worth your time..,"Most Mainland Chinese people will go to the Taipa-Cotai-Coloane side of Macau for shopping and gambling. However if you want to see beautiful architecture and be transported back to a by-gone era, you should visit the Macau peninsula to see the colourful buildings left by the Portuguese, the small winding roads where only mopeds can go through and the variety of churches and temples dotted around the place. The Macao Government Tourism Office has several walks you can take, which only take about an hour each. You can download the document from the website or download their app to your mobile device."
196,Must do part of Macau ,"We have very little good to say about Macau as a destination. Some of the food was very good.  This is one of the gems in the area.  Having been to Lisbon makes this a special place..  It is a real step back in time, with the steps taking you directly to Lisbon.  Beautiful to look at, and beings back memories. Well worth the visit and stroll along the paved streets."
197,Stunnig,"I was expecting something cute,  Portuguese style,  and ended up in a dirty,  grey,  ugly environment. The facade of the cathedral St Peter is fixed with cement and is lost in a landscape of ugly buildings.  Moreover it is crowded to a point that wandering around is not enjoyable.  Seriously do not waste your time nor money,  avoid visiting Macau..."
198,love it,"We were surprised by how nice this area is. I’ve lived and travelled all over Asia and China, and found Macau to be a charming mix of old and new, east and west. I believe most people think of Macau as a gambling area, full of gamblers and all that they represent. And, Macau does have that,but the local government does a wonderful job. The town is clean and safe. You feel secure walking around."
199,One of the many highlights of old Macau,If you are in Macau or thinking of coming definitely spend half a day in this area. So much history wonderfully kept and restored. Heaps and heaps of people but such an amazing place to be.
200,Walk around Centre of Macau,"Historic centre of Macau is a known for the various locations which reflect the cultural and architectural influence of the Chinese and Portuguese culture. Macau used to be a Portuguese colony as such huge impact of the Portuguese culture. There are streets, churches and temples in the area which makes it historic. Some of the important landmarks are Ruins of Saint Paul cathedral and A La temple. It is a nice place and you need to walk around it and crowded with tourists."
201,Interesting and worth the walk,"The area was resrricted from building new one and preserved as 16th century europian quarter. Stone lanes and iron street lantane are nostalgic. Old municipal house is well preserved. Nearby suvinior shops sell sea products like fish intestine, bird nests and signature dried pork."
202,Historically beautiful Macau,"This is the center of attraction. Before the casino boom, this was the only attraction. So don't miss it. Walk up the narrow streets to the ruin of St. Paul and then turn right to visit the Macao Museum, then you can say you have been to Macau."
203,Trip to Ruins of St Paul,"The historic center comprises of most of the place of interest in Macau. Senado square, St Paul church, Ruins, most of the govt buildings and shopping areas fall here. Be prepared to walk, and ensure it is not a hot day when you plan your trip. Luckily for us, we visited in January. The weather was perfect for a trip to the center."
204,Walk slowly and take lots of photos,"We spent Christmas Day 2013 here & still fondly remember it.Cobbled stone streets, St. Paul’s Ruins, well preserved historic buildings, the Fortress, many places to eat & drink...what’s not to like, even the ugly Hotel Lisboa looks nice in the sunset."
205,Beautiful Cobblestone,Macau got a lot of places need to be visit.Very crowded during weekends.The weather is too hot need to use umbrella.
206,Just a massive shopping area,"My wife, the Buddhist, wanted to see this. It is an old facade of a Catholic Church. If you like history...you'll like this stop in the middle of Macau."
207,Nice walk on a sunny day,"Generally speaking, this historic centre of Macau usually refers to the area surrounding Largo do Senado. Yes there are some famous sites usually on the list of international visitors to visit this area. Some of them are Dominic Church, Ruin of St Paul, Monte Forte, Macau Museum, and Largo do Senado itself. No wonder visitors always flock here and resulted busy crowded place in weekends or big holiday periods. This historic centre presents architecturally beautiful old Portuguese and Chinese buildings and housing styles."
208,Some of interesting places here,"The area around Senado Square -  part of the UNESCO Historic Centre of Macau World Heritage Site - is lined with historic buildings painted in Portuguese pastels. The area has a nice feel to it and is loaded with restaurants and shopping. It's a good place for walking and a change of pace from the gambling casinos that are nearby. At this time of year, it is filled with holiday decorations and event stages, somewhat obscuring the strong historical presence."
209,I interesting place to stroll,"Worth going to check out this area. We made the mistake of going mid afternoon - with the rest of the tourists in Macau. Umbrellas everywhere, and an odd rabbit statue addition to the surrounding gardens.Worth a look and a selfie, doesn't take long to walk up and around."
210,Hide out!,Went here late afternoon/ early evening after spending the day in the casinos and outer parts. Well worth a visit. A nice stroll.
211,a nice walk through a very interesting area,"Amazing how the Portuguese and Chinese cultures blended so well.  The Portuguese did an amazing job in keeping their identity and respecting the Chinese culture at the same time.  Great authentic Portuguese architecture and restaurants, on the other side of the world.Forget the casinos and enjoy a nice walk in the historical center of Macau."
212,What a beautiful city,"Having visited Portugal last year, I was interested to see how much of the Portuguese influence remains. The answer: a lot!! There are many, many well-preserved buildings, and narrow streets and squares of the black and white terrassae that are slippy when wet -- just like Lisbon!You can walk everywhere -- it's a small city."
213,Beautiful,"This is a UNESCO site. It includes a least 30 sites that exemplify the Portuguese influence in China. Everything is beautiful, clean, and safe. The locals are friendly.Everything is free. Macau is indeed a very generous city and as such it deserves a lot of respect. You need at least 2 days to visit and enjoy all these sites. The first day we walked from the Mandarin Oriental to the Senado Square and we visited all sites located northern area of the square. This part includes the ruins of the church of Saint Paul. The second day was even better. We visited the southern part. It is more peaceful and very relaxing. We arrived to the area by walking trough the shore from the Mandarin Oriental. It was absolutely beautiful. The wind from the ocean, the warm weather, the sun and the blue skies and the contrast with the modern and colonial sites were memorable! Macau is not a big city and if you don't have physical impairments you can visit the historic centre by walking."
214,should visit,"As a first time visitor to Macau, I went directly to Largo do Senado (Senate Square) from the Hong Kong Ferry terminal to begin my sightseeing day trip from Hong Kong.  Next to the water fountain in the square, there is a Tourist Office where you can get a free sightseeing map and so tips for sightseeing.  Also there is a bakery next door which as Portuguese Egg Tarts which taste like the ones I experienced in Lisbon.  Here you begin your walk on the pedestrian path to many historic sites in the historic center.  There are tourist directional signs to help you navigate along with the free map from the tourist office."
215,There is More than Casinos!,"Landed 11am, i stay only one night in Macau. Next day I went Gongbei to Guangzhou by Speed train. 70RMB."
216,Interesting,"The weekend walk in the narrow ally on the way to St. Paul  was like walking inside a sardine box, so many people it was unbelievable."
217,Loved Macau,All that remains of this Church is the facade as the Church was destroyed by fire.  But the facade is rather beautiful and striking in appearance.  But the real treasure is in the crypt below.  There is a small but wonderful collection of religious artefacts in the very small museum in the crypt.
218,Nice afternoon walk around ,"it was etched right there in solid stone, marking the site as the historic center of macau, right at the foot of the stairs leading to the ruins of st paul’s cathedral. i guess it starts from the streets before the senate square and branches its way to old alleys and cul-de-sacs. souvenir shops abound as well as clothing stalls, restaurants, banks, markets and what-have-you. you know you have arrived in macau if you reached this center."
219,Interesting cobble streets,The Portuguese left behind a rich cultural heritage stretching back 450 years to 1555. The new Macau Special Administrative Region government accentuated its past and preserved and restored nearly all the historic buildings and spaces that make Macau unique. These efforts were recognised by Unesco in 2005 when the Historic Centre of Macau was added to the list of World Heritage Sites. There are visible road signs to guide tourists and the city maps are are illustrative enough to guide moving from spot to spot by foot. Public toilets are located at strategis stops with clear direction together with the road signs.
