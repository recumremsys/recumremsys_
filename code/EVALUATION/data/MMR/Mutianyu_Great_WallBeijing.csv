0,A Must ,"No trip to Beijing would be complete without a Great Wall tour. We came to this point because I’m pregnant and we wanted to take the cable car and not walking too much. We were lucky because wasn’t too crowded and the weather was nice however we had to wait in lines quite long time and there are some points overcrowded, it’s very difficult to walk or even move. In general I would recommend to come early and to choose an specific day to really enjoy or being able to take nice pictures!"
1,Best experience ever!,"Worth the long bus ride. We had a dinner included with the tour. We booked with KaiBeijing Travels, there is a slide down hill from the peak. Kids loved it."
2,Fantastic Experience!!!!,"Do not go to Beijing without visiting The Great Wall! We were slightly anxious about visiting in December but whilst there was snow on the ground the sky was beautifully clear! Layered clothing defiantly the answer. We took two public busses to get there because we missed the shuttle bus which leaves daily AT 8am not FROM 8am as the information we’d seen had suggested. If you’d going to take a public bus, have the destination written down in Chinese! We walked half an hour up to the wall, about two hours along it and then about 20 minutes back down. There’s a cable car and toboggan option down but I’m not sure it’s worth it, we got down faster walking!If you can keep walking along the top after the crowds have petered out, it’s steep but I promise it is totally worth it! Take a snack and if it’s winter, a flask of something warm! Enjoy it! You’ll remember it forever!"
3,A must see,This is my third time touring Mutianyu and I took my mom and friend here since they were visiting China. We took the ski lift up and the view was great. The mountains we covered in snow which made the experience so cool. We took the tobaggan slide down and it was so fun! Shops around the wall are bargain/barter friendly and accept USD.However do NOT take pictures with the men dressed in traditional chinese dress with swords. They put a sword in my hand for me to pose for a photo and then demanded ¥40 from me. Kind of took away from the experience.
4,My Experience at the Great Wall,An enjoyable day out and close to central Beijing - could have done with better signage to explain what we were looking at and a lot of it felt over restored. Tobogganing was fun
5,Serene get awasy!,We had Linda from Odynovo as our tour guide in Beijing for three days and she took us to this section of wall.  Excellent location.  Very scenic and postcard picture location.  The toboggan ride down was a hoot as well.  A must do in Beijing.
6,Where are the Otters? ,"We had two days in Beijing and planned to do a visit to the Great Wall on one day and see the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square on the other day.We checked into our hotel late Thursday afternoon. The excursions office at reception was closed but later that evening it was open so we enquired about the Great Wall.The excursion on offer was quite interesting. It comprised travel by coach to a Ming Tomb, a visit to a Jade Factory, the Great Wall, with cablecar passes, and a tea tasting session. The cost was a shade over £50 each, including the cablecar tickets which wasn't included in the tour. That seemed to offer great value.We were picked up from the hotel at around 8 am next morning and the first stop was at the Ming Tomb. Quite interesting and impressive. Then we went to the Jade Factory. More of a shop than a factory as we only saw a couple of people actually making anything. We did get a very nice lunch there so I suppose it was worth it.Then on to the Wall. Unfortunately our guide wasn't that great. She spoke English but was almost unintelligible most of the time so we missed out on a lot of the information. She also walked very quickly and had no patience for anyone who doesn't, like me. She would race off into the distance and leave me way behind.    We eventually got to the entrance to the cable car and all joined the queue. Clearly our tickets didn't get us to the head of the queue as had been suggested.Having queued for about half an hour alarms sounded and a chap started bellowing something in Chinese through a loudhailer. We learned that due to high winds the cablecar had to be closed. That was unfortunate but I suppose can't be helped. Safety first and all that.So the guide told us we would walk to another entrance to the Wall. It was a long slog which I have to admit I struggled with but got there in the end. I didn't actually make it onto the Wall itself but got close enough. There was a huge queue waiting to climb a very steep set of steps about 100 metres up to the wall and then to come back down again. I decided I was close enough. I had got some good photos.We walked back to the coach and went on to the Tearoom, where we sampled some different types of tea. I haven't drunk a cup of tea for over 40 years and wasn't too keen to try these. I wasn't wrong! Most of them tasted pretty foul.All in all it wasn't a perfect outing in many respects but it was a once on a lifetime opportunity to see one more of the man made wonders of the world and I'm very glad I did it."
7,Incredible! ,You can't go to China without walking the Great Wall. It's of international importance and it didn't disappoint. China has done a very professional job in catering for the large numbers of tourists that visit.
8,China's iconic sight,"The most important thing while our time in China is that Chinese tours arrive at 10am at attractions. This is true for any attraction, of course, there are tour that go to different attractions between the day, but the main and biggest groups will arrive at that time and it is awful. We were in China during late November and early December and avoid all the crowds, but still we observe that at that a 10am the groups will arrive. For the great wall we used the transportation services of Mubus, and they offered buses in the early morning that arrive from around 10am at the wall and anther late service that leaves at noon and arrives before 2pm at the wall. We chose the late option, at the time because we wanted to visit the summer palace in the morning, but once in China it worked perfectly because we avoided the crows at both summer palace and the wall. The Mubus tour guide speaks Chinese and English and will give you a history about the wall as well the options to climb the wall and prices. The do not get any money for the tickets, you simply choose you ticket, give them the money and once at the wall they will buy the tickets for you at the same price, you do not have to make the line. For souvenirs wait until you meet the tour guide back at the restaurant, they have way better prices than the other places we visit. We a try to visit everything by ourselves but the public transportation to the wall was to much hassle and the money saved was not that much when compared to the Mubus price, and your reservation is made without paying the anything from their webpage. Once at the wall, you will have to walk a lot, we chose to take the lift to tower 14 and from that point climb (yes, climb since is only stair step from there) to tower 20. The view from tower 20 is not that great mainly because the walls of the tower itself that are too high, but the steps leading to tower 20 from tower 19 offer a great view. The steps look very step but is very doable, do not worry."
9,"Why, WHY WOULD YOU GO HERE??","I was only in China for a few months, but still the day I spent going to the wall was a waste. If you'e seen a picture you're good. Just skip this and have an extra day doing something interesting. Easily the worst day of my several trips to China. ANYTHING ELSE is better. Washrooms are disgusting too."
10,A Must Do in One's Lifetime,"Visiting This section of The Great Wall is an amazing experience. One word of caution. Even though there is a gondola to take you to the base of the wall, from where the shuttle drops you off, the road to the gondola requires a walk up a steep incline and is very difficult for someone with limited mobility. There was someone with a motorized cart that will transport people up to the gondola for a fee, but he is an independent business and we did not see any other means of assistance. We had two members in our party with limited mobility and assumed that the gondola would address their needs. The whole process took longer than expected, but once we made it to the wall, the experience was well worth it."
11,It was AMAZING!!,"Bought our voucher via Klook one day before the trip! Though last minute, everything was confirmed quickly. The pickup location was near our airbnb location at swiss hotel. Our tour guide for the day is Michael and he shared alot about the history of Great Wall with us. Funny and really helpful!"
12,Don't Miss this! Ride the Slide!,"We did the Great Wall with friends during a long layover in Beijing from U SUnbeknownst to me ( I didn’t do my research  so I didn’t fully know what was involved in touring it )I didn’t know you had to cable car up there ..I am afraid of heights . Very afraid!So now I had a problem either go back sit in the  airport for an over 20 hr layover Making everyone else in the group miserable ..hygyyyyOr muster up some courage go up there and see one of the wonders of the world !Well I opted for the latter . It wasn’t easy getting up there ..that’s another review of its own .. but I got up there climbed a few sections ..the steps aren’t even so it’s not easy but the good part is once you start climbing steps you can climb as high as you like or as low as you want or don’t climb at all.. you can just sit under the garrett and just take in the views  of the Wall from a distance .. there’s enough wall for all to see .. I’m told it spans some 26,000 miles ..The experience is grand We had perfect weather end of October I would not recommend it when it’s hot because uou expend a lot of energy ..if u do go stay hydrated ..We decided to toboggan down rather than take the terrorizing ride down with the cable car ..at least for me and my“ height fear “ it WAS terrorizing !The toboggan was a lot less intimidating even fun at times ..I felt better because w the lever you can stop it thereby keeping ME in control ..Well I got down it was exhilarating ..So Do Ii Recommend the Great Wall ?   By all means  if you have time and the means .. ( not afraid if heights that is)just make sure you fo your research and hav full understanding as to what it involves .... Enjoy .. take lots of water and snacks !"
13,Closest Wall to the City,"If you want to go individually, not with organized tour, we were offered the option to go by taxi. The taxi left us to the bus station were we bought tickets for the bus, the entrance and the cable. The bus left us at the cable station and the cable took us to the Wall. It was very easy and not so expensive and we arranged for the hours which were convenient for us."
14,Amazing Human Accomplishment,"We availed the Mutianyu whole day tour package from klook, (round trip transportation from Beijing, entrance ticket, English speaking guide, round trip cable car and lunch). It was a wonderful experience to be at such renown landmark. Great thing it was a very sunny day that we get to enjoy the view.  We took our time to stroll to the 20th Wall of Mutianyu great Wall part and hike til way down to 8th wall. The Mutianyu great Wall was not crowded at all. I highly recommend this part of Great wall to visit."
15,Great winter day with sun and only few other tourists,"Visiting the Great Wall At Mutianyu, Beijing has been on my list, I am so happy to tick off this attraction now. The great wall of china is surely massive and revered. It is over 6,000 kilometres long and extends over breath-taking scenery. It was cloudy on our day visit; this added a mysterious element to the whole experience. We reached the top via cable car ” or “teleferic. It is a UNESCO listed attraction and definitely worth visiting.  SEE photos."
16,Great Wall,There are several parts of the wall you can visit when in Beijing. We were recommended  Mutianyu and it did not disappoint. The scenery is stunning and my colleague and I really enjoyed the walk. Highly recommended!
17,Wonderful experience,"Unfortunately it rained when we visited the Great Wall. The cable car ride through the mist and clouds was marvelous. Walking and climbing the slippery steps to the wall was not so much fun. The photo provided for this review shows a blue sky which is a myth anyway given the pollution around Beijing. The locals call a blue sky Olympic Blue, meaning that clear skies are produced by the government for the tourists who attended the Olympics and not for the residents who live in Beijing. The wall of course is impressive and surprisingly wide. However, in winter it must have been a miserable place to have guard duty."
18,The Great Wall experience ,"Stayed in central Beijing but wanted to visit a section of the wall which wasn't as touristy as badaling ( closest section to Beijing) . We booked a private driver and visited the Longqingxia gorge in the morning and went to the wall in the afternoon . It took around 1.45 to get to the this section of the wall . The best part was there wasn't many tourists which meant you could walk the wall leisurely without being rushed and also take photos without getting random people in them .There are two tickets you can buy . Go up and down in a cable car or go up on a ski lift and come down via the tabogon. We chose the latter option. Both are same price . The price for the ski lift ,entrance to walk the wall and to come back down was about £18! Bargain . Ski lift up was very scary but safe .You arrive at the wall at entry point 6. We walked from point 6 to 1 as recommenced by the driver . This section has the best views and is more difficult as it's steep . I think this part isn't as re-made as some other parts of the wall . The walk took bout hour but OMG , the views were breath taking . Absolutely amazing . We walked back to point 6 and took the tabogon down which was another experience !! You can slow if you like or faster - there's a hand break . It's worth visiting this section of the wall for the quite and calm and views . The best day by far on my travels"
19,Third time and it’s still great,"We hired a taxi for the day in Beijing. We did this to beat the touringcars and that worked. We got in the taxi at 6AM (yes very early) and arrived at the gates just before they opened. Because of this we were at the wall with very few others. This gave us the opportunity to get the pictures we wanted. We were with a party of 4. 3 of us took the cablecars and 1 of us walked up. The walk was do-able, but not really interesting. The views up on the wall were great. Be sure to wear good footwear, cause it can be very steep and take some water with you, cause it get hot quickly."
20,Amazing!,"This is one of the must-go Great Wall. According to our guide, Clare, she said Mutianyu has lesser crowd than Badaling. We took the cable car to Tower 14 and strolled to Tower 20. Weather though was 17 degree but was sunny. Too Hot to take photo. We were there about 9am ++.I could only advise for those walking from Tower 14 to 20. Need to have good legs. Lots of stairs, and some were uneven. Careful when going from Tower 19 to 20, I stopped few times to catch my breath. Tower 20 stairs were really steep. Chop chop take photo and walked back to Tower 14. Coming down was easy for me. And to take cable car back, we queued rounds 15 minutes, and no one cut queue. We booked the trip through Klook."
21,Best part of the wall!,This was an amazing experience!  It was a small hike to the cable car (I recommend not  pigging out on dumplings right before) and then a short ride to the top of the wall. The views were amazing and the wall seems to go on forever. I highly recommend taking to toboggan back down to the bottom...just don’t expect any belts or safety equipment.
22,Stunning!,"Maggie You of Sunflower Tours knows that I am there for pictures, so she took me to Mutianyu Great Wall. This place is more quiet as normal big group tours won't come here as the journey is very far. We took many lovely pictures and I am very happy and please with the tour leader."
23,Go early for the best experience,Well worth the extra drive out of Beijing to see this.  Enjoyed the cable car up and the exercise walking along the wall I'm sure did us both good :o)
24,Definitely go this one!,"We visited this section of the Great Wall as part of an organized group arranged through the hotel, and we did so because its supposed to be the less popular section (i.e. less crowded) which isn't necessarily the case.  It should also be mentioned that photos can be deceiving as the walk up to the cable car is very steep and when you actually get to the top of the hill where the cable car lets you out, there's more stairs to the entrance of the wall near tower #14.  The area is very crowded and the entrance to the wall itself is very steep with large stone steps so if you're not able bodied you're going to have a very difficult time.  Once on the wall itself, your physical fitness will definitely be tested as there are inclines of 70 degrees in places over uneven surfaces and in some areas large crowds seem to gather which make passing on narrow sections difficult.  Overall its an amazing location and experience but be prepared to work for the enjoyment!!"
25,GREAT WALL MUTIN YU,Enjoyed our day to the Great Wall! Very seamless transport with Mubus and our tour guide Michael was wonderful and helpful
26,Spectacular,Travelled to the great wall using a cable car ride. Experience was good. Neat and clean. You can spend as much time you want and climb further.
27,Superbly restored section of the Wall,"I visited Simatai and Badaling Great Walls, but Mutianyu is my top choice. It is the longest fully-restored Great Wall section open to tourists, with 23 watchtowers. It is also much less crowded than Badaling, has better architecture than Simatai. The most convenient way is to head to Dongzhimen Wai bus station and take the 0830hr bus direct to Mutianyu Great Wall entrance. Bus fare is 30rmb, about 1.5 hours ride. At the ticketing office, I paid 45 rmb for the entrance ticket, 15rmb for return shuttle bus ticket & 100rmb for cable car up one way. If you wish to save money, you can purchase the cable car return trip 120rmb, but it means you have to start and end at the cable car station.After the entrance, I took the shuttle bus to the main section, then walked past some souvenirs shops and restaurants, then took the cable car up to No. 14 watchtower. On top, one can walk eastward to No. 1 watchtower or westward to No.23 watchtower. If you head west, it is much steeper and you need to u-turn when you arrive at No.23 watchtower. Majority of visitors, including me, headed east to No. 6 watchtower, which is generally downhill. It was a pleasant hike, with nice surrounding scenery. I took about 2 hours hiking from No. 14 to No. 6 watchtower, with many stops for photo shoots and short rests. At No. 6 watchtower, I took the toboggan one way down 100rmb. It was fun sliding down the track, highly recommended."
28,Nice views,"My husband and i were at the Great Wall in November 2 days after it had snowed. We found a private driver to take us to the wall and also to the Ming Tombs via a previous guide - approx. $900RMB and he stayed with us all day. The day was clear and with the snow was memorable. We rode the bus to the village and then the cable car up to the wall at Mutianyu. We walked left (up) for about 4 towers, then walked back (down) by the cable car entrance and continued to the toboggans down. They were very fun however there is a staff person at every turn telling you to slow down. We also stopped in the village at the tea shop for a demonstration and some tea. We had heard the street sellers were obnoxious, but they were fine and it was cold that day, so if you needed a scarf, hat, gloves or sweater you would have been glad they had supplies."
29,Interesting,"We went with Benny to visit the Great Wall, the summer palace and the Olympic area. The visit was amazing, and enhanced with the Benny’s support. He is a great driver, calm and prudent, very kind and respectfull. I strongly recommend Benny for tours in Beijing."
30,Fun Day Trip from Beijing,After having read so much about the 8th Natural wonders of the world - this place is exactly how i imagined. I wish i had some time to hike which would be a great experience. It's also worth a visit in the fall the colours are just beautiful. if you are the adventurous kind then the cable car to the 14th tower and then a hike up to the 23rd tower. its steep and tough! there are other options to go up as well - there is chair lift to go up and down at the 6th tower or also an option of toboggan to come down ....its fun! overall definitely a visit
31,Go in winter to avoid the crowd ,"We live in Beijing so for our visitors, we like to send them to mutianyu rather than badaling. For people who like to hike there are some wilder parts to consider. Mutianyu is fun because it proposes cable car and toboggan, which, by saving time, give you more time to do more doors. The right side, shorter, is much steeper than the left side."
32,Xia Wei is an amazing guide,"We got lucky to get to the Great Wall on a clear sunny day.   The ride up a ski lift and the slide down a toboggan was thrilling.  The hike from view point 6 to 15 and back was spectacular, especially as we could see as far as the Beijing skyline.  A must see...and hope for good weather!!"
33,Great section of the Wall,This was the culmination of a lifelong dream to walk on the Great Wall. Mutianyu is a lesser traveled entry way and it comes with a cable car to make the climb to the top and a thrilling luge ride to descend off the wall if you are so inclined. There is a small tourist oriented village at the base filled with trinkets and food. The wall was been reconstructed to its former glory and you can walk for miles but it rapidly becomes strenuous as the wall follows the contour of the mountain top. Do not miss the chance to see the Wall!
34,Nice to be on a less visited section of the Wall,Around 1.5 hours away from Beijing center. I booked a vehicle with driver so that time is more flexible. Food stores and shops for you to stop by.
35,Beautiful!,"Our tour of 9 people had a guide who spoke very good English and we spent about 3 hours at the wall area.  Climbing the stairways to reach the wall may be very challenging for many, as well as actually walking on the wall may be too taxing for most.  I didn’t have any issues and was able to walk about 30 minutes up the wall, so with with the return walk it was an hour trek,  Many steps are 16  to 18 inches high, with others shorter.  Regardless, however you experience the wall, it will be a once in a lifetime experience and you surely should do it."
36,Beautiful in Winter,"We visited this section of the wall from recommendations, we went on a beautiful day. The wall was not overcrowded and the views were just amazing. This section of the wall is very long and can be challenging at times, so need to have some fitness. Breathtaking place! A bucket list must."
37,Amazing structure,"Unfortunately we were there during the ""golden week"" holidays, like many thousands of others. The wall itself is amazing however because of the terrain and the stone walkways a fair degree of fitness is required to do it justice. The trip to and from Beijing was very long, probably because of the number of visitors there during that week. This detracted from the overall experience. It was however an amazing thing to see."
38,must go,We tackled this area via a hike to the non restored section of the Great Wall and then walked to the restored section.  The hike is a challenge so you much be in good shape and the wall is very steep.  A life changing experience that I highly recommend - our favorite site in Beijing.
39,Fantastic!,"A visit to Mutianyu in the winter is special - especially after a snow storm. I've been to Mutianyu twice (November 2014 and January 2020). Both times were ideal as the crowds were not as crazy as what you hear it can be during the spring/summer months. While the January visit was COLD, it was still beautiful to walk around and take some great photos. The cable car ticket for 120 Yuan was worth the price for the round trip. After a few hours of exploring the Great Wall, you'll want to take the cable car quickly back to the staging area if you're visiting in January. One of these days I'll walk back down or take the slide rail. There are some dining areas that are decent prices, but the souvenir shops were over priced. I enjoyed my tour group as it gave us 4 full hours to explore the Great Wall and down time at the end. The trip was about 60-90 minutes from Beijing depending on traffic. Overall, this has always been my favorite day activity while visiting Beijing."
40,Amazing,"Very glad I booked this tour. It was well organised so took the stress out of planning for me. Jily was a great guide, very knowledgeable and experienced so knows how to make sure everyone has a good time.I think the trip is good value for money and the Great Wall is worth visiting when in Beijing. Met some fun people too and Jily was always in good spirits which made it very enjoyable."
41,Very cold.,"Mutiyanyu is a crowded and tourist-ridden section of the Great Wall. But its views are fantastic, and the wall is well renvoated. Several stones are over 2000 years old and weigh hundreds of tons. You can go up in 3 ways - climb 1300 steps (with 2 paths, each reaching a different guard house), cable car and gondola (ski/chair lift). Would recommend climbing up as the forested steps are a fantastic experience - can be done by first time/not-so-fit trekkers (like me) although you may need several breaks (also like me). While coming down, we chose the chair lift although the toboggan ride is a popular and fun option. Get here first thing in the morning to avoid crowds. August is especially very crowded because it is vacation month in China.A beautiful and accessible slice of Chinese and world history. A must see."
42,There is nothing flat about the Great Wall of China’s !!,"We had booked a Great Wall day tour. Our tour guide showed us how do everything and even went on the wall with us to take our picture. I found the Wall amazing but didn't go very far, because the steps were steep in some places and uneven. My sense of balance is not that good.  But my friend did an hour walk. It too almost 7 hours from our hotel in downtown Beijing to the Wall and bac."
43,Best section of the wall,We were able to visit the Mutianyu while in Beijing. It was an awesome experience and you can feel the history when walking along the wall. Going with Odynovo made it really easy.
44,Stunning Views,"Such an amazing experience. It takes some time to get from centre of Beijing to this section of the wall but it was worth it. Took a chair lift up, then walked quite a way, and lots of steps, but not too hard.  Views spectacular. We had an amazing trip down via the toboggan type speed chute, which saved a bit of time, but was lots of fun."
45,Incredibly beautiful,"The first visions of the Mutianyu Wall will just take your breath- it is an incredible site from any angle, so have your camera ready.  Walking through the stone towers and along the stone paths will have you marvelling at the skill of the Wall's construction and at the intensity of the labor involved.  Mutianyu is the location of the highest section of the Great Wall, so visitors  are offered options to hiking such as cable car rides, toboggan rides, or chair lift rides to reach the top or bottom."
46,Must See section of the Great Wall,The location is bit far off - and of course there are lot of tourists - but the closeness to ming tombs makes up for it - and the views are great.
47,Another cool place not to miss,Really breathtaking and impressive.  One experience we will always treasure as a family.The climb was made even more interesting with a cable car.  The part of the Wall itself was a of a friendly slope and good for us with small children.
48,Beautiful Spot,"We came her with a tour and its magnificent. There are two ways to get up and down, the toboggan way or the gondola way. For the more adventurous people, the toboggan way is the way to go. The view once you get up there is magnificent. We didn't spend too much time walking the wall because we didnt have much time but we wished we had."
49,Went back in time at Mutianyu Great Wall,Took the chair lift up and the luge down - worth it!  The Great Wall is an amazing experience!  The beauty of the Wall and the surrounding area takes your breath away!  Loved every minute of our time here!
50,Mutianyu Great Wall,"Our tour guide recommended this section if the wall as he described it as more authentic without as much renovation.  The views were amazing.We arrived by car and then our guide purchased the tickets.A short transfer to a shuttle bus and then a short uphill walk to the cable car to the top.Alternatively there is a ski lift to the top and luge down, or a walking track for the very fit.There are many steep sections and some stairs but a wheelchair (still steep) access is available We were lucky to have a clear day and there were few tourists because it was winter."
51,Lovely during the off-season,"The views from the Great Wall have to been seen to be believed.  We didnt go as part of a group, just got a taxi from Beijing and it worked perfectly.  The Wall wasnt as busy as we anticipated.  Late October is an excellent time to go."
52,Stop  over at grat wall at Peking Airport,What a place! The walk was tougher than I expected but worthwhile. Great views and history. On our way back we took the toboggan down to the base station. Fun! Really worth a trip from Beijing!
53,"Not much tourist, great preservation","we loved the experience of walking for a long stretch of the Mutianyu great wall, imagining the past that caused this great structure to be built."
54,not special as i think,"Visit during a layover from Thailand. Happened to meet a very helpful driver in the Beijing airport. About an hour and a half ride. Because of our personal driver, the ticket process and everything about our visit was simple and easy.  He even waited for us in the tourist area and recommended a nice restaurant after our visit to the wall. The crowd made it less of an experience for us. It was severely touristy. However to be able to visit the Great Wall of China even under those circumstances is in itself and honor. Although I wouldn’t recommend it because of the lack of a sidewalk, we even missed the shuttle back down the mountain on purpose and walked back to the shuttle hub after our great wall visit, through the small town. Amazing experience."
55,Seven wonder,"One needs to be fairly fit to do this trip.  The walk up to the chairlift was a little daunting (I'm 60 years old and not very fit).  However, the chairlift up to the wall was delightful and the men assisting me to alight were great. I didn't walk much along the wall, preferring to experience just being there and enjoying the views.  This area of the Wall is apparently the best preserved so gives an indication of what it would have been like.  Truly magnificient."
56,Toboggan down The Great Wall of China!,"This is a part of the wall that can be easily visited from Beijing. Highly recommend getting there early to get some pictures without the crowds. To cable car up, walk the wall and then cable car down you need about 4-5 hours minimum. Beautiful views of the wall."
57,MUTIANYU Great Wall of China with the Family in winter.,"We visited the Great Wall of China, Mutianyu section in December 12, 2019. We are a family of nine (9), eight adults and one kid. It was -7 C when we left Beijing downtown area at 7am. The weather was between -2C to -4C when we reached Mutianyu by 9am. We booked our MUTIANYU Great Wall adventure with Bus Tour on Klook. We got it on discount. Good for 2 People per set (we bought 5 sets for 10pax at P1,100 if I can still remember. No cable car ride included. We bought it separately from the Tour Guide at RMB 120, prices depends on the season).We Book Great Wall of China Tour on Klook. Pickup Time is 7am. They will tell you where the nearest pickup point. Make sure to arrive on time. Bring water and snacks. Travel Time from Downtown Beijing to Mutianyu is two hours.After the tour, we had lunch in a Chinese Restaurant called Chun Ju Farm House. They served sumptuous and in huge serving. It was worth the money.Although, there were only five of us who took the cable car and went all the way to the Great Wall Section overall, we had a great time in Beijing."
58,A must visit,we booked a day tour w lunch w Klook and the local tour is handled by Mu bus.  Our English speak tour guide Leo Liu recommended 2 ways cable car up to Station 14 and walk 1.5hrs-2hrs to Station 20.  The scenary is the best between Station 19 to 20 but was also the most difficult walk w steep steps.  We walked back to Station 14 and took the cable car down.  Bring sufficient water and snacks so that u could stop on the wall.  Visit the toilet at the base of the station before u catch the cable car.
59,Quiet to visit in winter ,Sensational tour of the wall our guide was amazing All couples were seniors some with limited mobility Most made it to the top of the wall A once in a lifetime experience Great tour guide Catcus
60,"Stunning section of wall, easy to get to from Beijing Airport","We booked a tour and the guide very sensibly took us to the wall as the first stop so we were there before the crowds and didn't have to queue for the cable car which took us to tower 14. The cable car gave scenic views over the valley but WOW when you get to the top and see the wall, your jaw just drops in amazement. From tower 14 you can take the gentle slope to the right or the more challenging one to the left. We did a little of both and you would not believe the angle of the wall, how steep it is even on the ""easier"" sections. You can see the wall on many of the surrounding hills and view towers off in the far distance. We went at the end of October and the autumn colours were just stunning. We were also fortunate to have a sunny day and the wall, against the blue sky with the reds, greens and golds of the leaves was just incredible. My husband hadn't really been bothered about going to the wall but he now admits that he was mightily impressed."
61,Impressive but I suspect there are better options ,"We went to the Wall a few days ago. Breathtakingly BEAUTIFUL views. The cable car up and down was another highlight, scary though  exhilarating. We were blessed with fantastic weather, freezing but clear and sunny. This section of the Wall is not crowded at all, just a totally acceptable amount of fellow tourists so didn't feel cramped at any point. The surrounding scenery is remarkable. It's very peaceful, with the exception of the helicopter tour every 20 minutes. Which you can do for 750yuan I think it was.The Wall is a once in a lifetime experience.Perfect opportunity to take those bucket list photos. Beware of the merchant ladies just after the entrance, they will entice you with fake silk,   t-shirts, paintings, and the likes. If you're hard up for souvenirs and belated Christmas gifts for your mother like I was, it's easy to get acceptable prices. They will start with the astronomical figure just to warn you. fake silk garments for 280yuan oh my golly! So if you enjoy a good HAGGLE, it's easily done with this lot. PS. Gatorades are NOT 25yuan! can be haggled to an acceptable and fair 10yuan per bottle, after a tiring Wall hike."
62,Very very impressive,"it is a life time experience must visit and easier than badaling a 2 hr journey from beijing, lift and cable car access to top available for elderly, astounding views and awe inspiring feelings and the drive is scenic"
63,Great place,This is a wall and it is a very long wall. Seems like it will keep people in or out. I don't know why it has to be 100 characters. I've said enough.
64,Highlight of our trip! ,"We went to the Great Wall at Mutianyu in Jan, with some snow all around. Two companies operate cable cars in this place, separated by a considerable section of the wall. If you do not mind buying separate tickets instead of a round trip ticket, it is preferable to go up in one cable car, walk the length of the wall to the other companies operation, and take the other cable car (or a tobaggon) down. We were a bit worried about the sub-zero temperature, but with the bright sunshine and the walking, we actually felt quite warm. Do reserve some time for the Mutiyanyu village. It is beautiful and has several restaurants, including a Burger King. Do not plan to get on the wall if you are weak or have a heart condition, since there are many steps to climb up and down all the time."
65,Explore the view and the history,I like this one better than Badaling. You have many choices which Great Wall to go. My driver recommended his one.
66,Awesome place,What other superlatives can be used when reviewing this place. Was not prepared for the scale of it! We visited on a clear sunny cold windy day. It was tremendously busy but we had so much fun. Got the funicular railway up and then you had to walk. This is not something to contemplate if you have mobility issues - however it is wonderful - steep climbs lots of steps and spectacular views. What a feat of human endeavour was this. Highly recommend but if the weather is bad would think this would be challenging.
67,A must visit in Beijing and less crowded ,Booked a private car trip through tripadvisor. We took the cable car up and down. Also walked for quite a while on the wall. It was a lot of fun.
68,Stunning!,"I visited the Great Wall at Mutianyu on the 30th of October 2019 having left the Hilton Beijing at 09.30. I hired a car rather than take a tour...considering the morning traffic, the drive took about 50 minutes on what I would describe as a scenic tour on the motorway and country roads to the greeting pavillion. This is where you purchase your tickets for the motor coach ride to the chair lifts. You have the option of using the chair lifts to and from the wall or take the tobaggan down. I opted for the chair lifts in both directions (which I recommend as the views are so breathtaking).  I am sixty two years of age with two artificial knees and had absolutely no problem managing the stairway to the wall...I would recommend some good walking shoes or trainers for 100 or so steps onto the wall. My recommendation to anyone with some disability or artificial implants is to GO TO THE WALL...and take your time. Sadly, I believe this experience is not wheel chair compliant. There are clean toilet facilities, restaurants, cafes and shops. I bought my Great Wall T-Shirt  and purchased fruit and nuts from local vendors, which was so much fun interacting with the locals. I speak Mandarin Chinese, but most everyone working there  speak some English. Needless, to say I was ingratiated with warm hospitality.  I am an U.S. traveller that first came to  Beijing in 1979...I am so impressed with the ease of touring this UNESCO heritage site and recommend it to everyone. I stayed two hours and felt that my visit was sufficient. I intend to return to the Wall at Mutianyu to experience the seasons, the natural beauty and solemnity of the wall in all it's majesty."
69,Awe-inspiring great wall ,"I want to visit this place for longtime, we go in january when we are in beijing. A lot of place cannot go to because of snow."
70,A Highlight,"You visit China, not visit Greatwall will be a big mistake. So pls do visit there, and again get your ticket online from “Get Your Guide” or “Klook” or from a local website to safe your time, and the tour leader will do the rest for you. Get a nice camera to take a great photo there, don’t forget."
71,Outstanding tour ,"well kept section of the Great Wall, apparently less busy than other sections close to Beijing. Going up by skilift was pictoresque, going down by tobbago was more convenient than I expected"
72,Not too crowded in November,We wanted to visit a part of the wall which is not much crowded and this was the right place. We took a direct public bus from Beijing. Wall itself is nice and you can have a good walk around. We have used the cable car to get up and it is worth it. Definitelly a good place to visit.
73,Avoid the Great Wall Crowds,"To get here from Beijing you'll need to take a tour bus for several hours depending which part of the city you are travelling from since the traffic can be crazy in China and often is. Once the bus drops you off and you pay for your ticket to go through, you'll need to climb up a hill which takes about a half hour to get up, passing through trees and up wooden steps, hopefully you wont mind bugs flying into your ears. Once you reach the top of the hill you see the wall blocking your view, then you can go up some steps and you'll finally see a wall that seems to go on forever. It slides up and down the hills, like a snake almost as it twists and turns in both directions on and on; on a clear day you can see it stretch out, but be careful of when you visit because it can get unbearably hot in China, up to 40 degrees Celsius. You'll also need to make sure that you're visiting when few other people are because otherwise you'll be cramped in with hundreds of others beside you and barely able to move or enjoy the wall. You can run up and down the sloping wall, explore the small castles dotted along, see old cannons and behold northern China, aka Inner Mongolia and experience a piece of history. To get back down you don't need to walk, you can simply take a sled down a long slide for a fun 5 minutes back down to the bottom."
74,Omg! Must go!,"had a truly great day on the Mutianyu part of the Great Chinese Wall. Leaving from Beijing at 7 AM in the start of December in light frost end sun, I really enjoyed the 90 minutes ride. If your driver speaks English, I can only recommend that you interview him/her about the infrastructure under construction etc. you pass on the way to Mutianyu. If you come in Winter, don’t forget to bring warm clothes. As I arrived, there was some centimeters of snow on the North Sides and in the shade. Ski lifts are offered to reach the wall, but I strongly recommend,  that you consider to walk the 200 meters of altitude since this will – so to speak – prepare your mind much better. The track is well marked and in very fine condition. On the top of the wall, you must try to imagine the mongols approaching on horses from North. Read some history in advance. Along the wall, you will find more cafeterias. Prices for a coffee are not cheap, but what a place to enjoy it. Such a Winter day, we had approximately 100 km sight. Magnificent!"
75,Top of the list while in Beijing,Michael was a perfect tour guide. We booked a basic tour package to include transportation and admission. He gave information about the Great Wall on the bus and allowed ample opportunity to explore. It had snowed and some extra time was given so we could walk slowly. Michael and the driver were organized and helpful. Pickup and drop off location was centrally located. Highly recommend this tour.
76,amazing,"This portion of the wall was relatively easy to get to (joined a small group tour by Trippest)  and not too bad to get to the wall itself. There is a short uphill climb to get to the cable car, which I used. Going to the top on foot didn't look as hard as I expected, but time is also a consideration. Once at the top you have the choice of continuing up or down the wall, but there are also up and down areas including steps all along each segment between towers. The views were amazing all along this portion. If you can make it up to the cable car, you can enjoy large portions of this wall no matter what your physical limitations are. The active people, in the tour group I was with, made it to the top tower allowable, and back, in less time than we were given, the rest did what they could or wanted to do. It really didn't matter as the views were great from the very first tower. Loved this location!"
77,Great Experience at The Great Wall,Amazing trip to Mutianyu Great Wall with our guide Lisa!  Incredible memories supported by wonderful pictures!
78,Great place to see the Great Wall,"We got here with Mubus from Beijing (see other reviews) arriving at around 2pm. We opted for just the entrance tickets (40RMB per person) as the add-ons like the cable car were far more expensive (+120RMB pp). My girlfriend did do the chairlift up and toboggan/slide down (previous year) which she said was worth it however.As we were part of a tour, the guide handled tickets and we got a free lift to the entrance (the ticket office and actual entrance are some distance a part and you have to get a shuttle at 15RMB pp to get there otherwise). We were recommend to take the path up to tower 10 and proceed from there. The walk up to tower 10 from the Great Wall entrance is tough and certainly the cable car is suggested for anyone who struggles with moderate exercise. The walk up took roughly 20 minutes. We went on a clear day (we waited to book our tour until we were certain of the weather conditions) and the 40RMB plus 20 minute walk was absolutely worth it when you arrive at Tower 10 and take in the view. From Tower 10 we walked all the way to Tower 20 (the last accessible tower) taking as many photos as possible along the way; there was certainly no shortage of scenic photo opportunities. The wall is well maintained and there is a good balance between necessities (e.g. bins) and shops, and keeping a natural vibe; it didn't seem touristy at all and felt like genuinely scaling an ancient wall. The walking conditions, of course, are sketchy, but this only adds to the experience (note: wear appropriate footwear!). The climb to Tower 20 is not for the faint hearted, but again the view was well and truly worth it. The walk from Tower 10 to Tower 20 took roughly 1 hour 30 minutes with photo stops a long the way. Not stopping on the way back makes it quicker, and then we descended via the same route from Tower 10. Despite being a world renowned attraction, it did not feel busy at all, possibly as the afternoon, we were told, is less crowded.In conclusion, this experience of China, to date, has been my personal favourite. I truly reccomend a visit, not just to 'tick-off' another famous site, but because it is genuinely awe inspiring."
79,Magnificent wall,"If you want to see the wall this is the best and less crowded spot. We booked a tour with a private driver, it was at our own pace and worth every penny"
80,"Great place, simple hike","Mutianyu Great Wall      BeijingA terrific way to get to the best part of the Great Wall from the airport is by local, public bus (not tour bus/private car/organised tour) Take the airport express from the airport to Dongzhimen station. It is about half an hour; the ticket price is 25RMB. Take 916 express (make sure it's the EXPRESS) - go to Huairoubeidajie station, transfer H23 or quick cab ride to Mutianyu. Or get the bus all the way up, & head to tower 14, then just keep climbing. You can go all the way to the top. It's hard, but soooooo worthwhile. There's not much food, and it's quite arduous, so take food with you or you can get to bargain for water, fruit and snacks on the way up, if you forget. I even had large portions of the wall all to myself, sometimes for several minutes. And there are drink sellers right near the top - hardy souls, I think they deserve patronage.Such an achievement to climb so high, you feel like you are on top of the world.If you have time to visit Shanghai, aside from my favourite restaurant - Mr and Mrs Bund - there are two other hard-to-find places you should visit - the well-hidden propaganda poster museum and the Former Provisional Government Site of the Republic of Korea (a bit like a poor man's Churchill War Cabinet rooms in London)"
81,"Beautiful scenery, just breath taking.","This is a great way to experience the wall. Entry was easy and the walk along the wall was spectacular. The alpine slide was just OK. Unfortunately, it gets backed up and people hit the brakes too frequently, causing it to come to a complete standstill, which is disappointing. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun. The wall visit was wonderful!"
82,Experience it by your feet,Awesome place to stay for a visit to the wall.  Fantastic staff and the rooms have a stunning view of the mountains and the wall.  Will definately stay again!
83,So worthwhile,"One of the great wonders of the world, this is a must to when in Beijing. We went up Mutianyu via cable car and down by the toboggan. It was simply amazing up there with the scenery and vastness of the wall. Remember to be in comfortable footwear and dress appropriately. We went up in winter and even though I was wearing four layers, I still felt chilly so be sure to be snuggly before you do the climb. Steps and more steps, prepare to do lots of walking and climbing. Other than that, don't forget to bring along your camera to record memories of the journey!"
84,Nice!,This is a must if you’re visiting China One of the seven wonders of the world steeped in history amazing cultural importance just fantastic took photos galore
85,Excellent ,The great wall is a good 2hr drive from the centre of beijing traffic permitting. We went in November low season and it was still quite busy even though the temperature was 1oC. You can take the cable car or chair lift up to the base of the wall. We took the chair lift. There are a lot of steps up to the wall and on top .There are many more steps as well as undulating path between the towers amazing site worth the visit spectacular but go low season to miss the crowds.
86,Best Part Of The Great Wall To See,"If you can only get one visit to the Great Wall, Mutianyu is a good choice. Not too far from Beijing. Crowded but not as crowded as closer sections. Beautifully restored and a great bit of scenery. Visited in Autumn and the colours were lovely. Access easy via a cable car. You can stroll a neat section, see guard towers and climb some steep steps. Some great positions for photos. I believe this section was favoured by Chairman Mao, so what more endorsement could you have?"
87,One of my Best Family Holiday Ever,The tour was well organized and very convenient.  Michael gave good advice about the different options for the wall.  He had a good sense of humor andshared interesting information.  We live in Beijing and this is the second time we have used this company. Would definitely recommend it .
88,Nice and not much crowded part of the wall,"I went specifically on a Friday afternoon as that’s when they said the otters would be being fed. However when I got there, they said there weren’t any otters there? Bit confusing."
89,Best part of Beijing trip,Great-phenomenal-masive-mystical-must see-i recommend cable car up to point number 14 and use the slide down from tower number 6.  Anytime again.....
90,Excellent place and some small tips.,"We arrived very early at the airport from Manchester, so prebooked a 3B taxi to the Wall.  We were there as it opened, and there were maybe four other people there.  We had a good couple of hours to explore and get amazing photos, whilst it was empty and cool.  As we were leaving tour buses had started arriving.  It is still a quieter section of wall than some others and even at the end it was not 'heaving'.  Our son enjoyed the toboggan down from the wall as a bonus."
91,Mutianyu in winter,Visited this section of the Great Wall after lunch and there was not much crowd which suited us well as we got to take many great shots.  Views were breathtaking and the wall itself was a magnificent sight.  A must visit when in Beijing.
92,Family Holiday ,"What more can you say, we took a private car out, cable car up to the wall and we walked from Watchtower 14 to 20 (Quite a climb but we did it in 45 minutes each way and were both 60) Spectacular"
93,Great place to see the wall,"What an amazing experience it was to be at the Great Wall.  We took the cable car to #13.  Then we walked as far as #19.  It was quite a trek, with uneven steps and a variety of levels, but it was so worth it.  The views from the wall are incredible.  But it's mind boggling to stand there and realize that this was built so long ago and to realize its massiveness.  We checked it from our bucket lists."
94,Great place for visiting Great Wall,The tour picks you up and drops you off back at your hotel. The groups are small and build a sense of community during the hike. Everyone cheering each other on. The tour guide is very kind and answers all questions and provided historical facts as well as other key facts for the hike. The tour guide was very responsible and made sure everyome was accounted for when it was time to have lunch and start our return. It is a trip i would do again with Graylime.
95,Magnificent view and history,"We were told by several locals that this is the best section of the great wall, and we are so glad we visited it. We went on a perfect slightly sunny day in June, and it was not overly crowded with tourists at all, but actually quite peaceful. We asked the concierge of our hotel in Beijing to book us a driver for the day, which worked perfectly. He picked us up at our hotel, drove us to the great wall which was about an hour drive, and picked us up after spending about three hours, and drove us back to Beijing. We took the cable car up and down, as we were not into climbing that many steps, but there were people who did it and said it was great. The ski lift and toboggan on a different part of the wall also sounded fun and were highly recommended. Once at the top, we spent about an hour and a half hiking around the wall. We certainly could have spent longer if we had more time and energy, so plan your trip accordingly. The views were gorgeous and it was definitely an amazing bucket list adventure. It’s so fascinating how sticky rice was used in the mortar for the bricks. While this is not the closest section of the wall to Beijing, I think it’s worth the extra bit of driving as it is so scenic and definitely less crowded. Beware of the souvenir sellers at the bottom who will definitely try hard to sell you their goods, though it can be fun to bargain them down. It’s definitely advisable to use the bathrooms at the bottom of the wall, as there are noneonce you get up to a certain point. We bought our tickets at the wall and it was no problem. This is a must do if you are in the Beijing area."
96,Hike!,"We were fortunate to visit this section of the Great Wall on a cool, cloudy, but dry day. The views would have been better on a clearer day, but the experience was once-in-a-lifetime.It took about 2 hours to hike up to the ""top"" (Tower 20), with the last section being particularly challenging -- but doable. Just imagining how this incredible wall was built hundreds of years ago is humbling. Absolutely worth a visit -- bring some snacks and water."
97,Finally made it to The Great Wall,"Went there on a private tour, VIP parking therefore less uphill walking to the main entrance.  Recommend the cable cars,  you’ll do plenty of walking on the wall.  Use restrooms before going up, none on the wall. They do have a sort of a snack bar at top right after the cable cars exit.  The wall is clean and well preserved.  Once you go up to the wall you’ll have plenty of stairs and lots of walking to do, depending on how far you want to go.  The further you go, the better your photo ops.  We went in the morning and it was foggy and rainy, about an hour later it stopped and cleared up.  Highly recommend this section of the wall."
98,Lived up to its reputation,"We chose to take a tax from our hotel in Beijing. The driver helped us buy our tickets and gave us directions on where to go. It is quite a walk  - steep in parts, to get to the cable car station. We chose to go up the cable car to Tower 14 and then walk to Tower 6 and get the toboggan slide back down. Both were good and the queues weren't too big.The wall is very busy at Tower 14 buy got quieter as we walked along it. It is very steep in parts so may not suite those who are less able.The Toboggan ride was great fun ( you can take a chairlift down if you want) and we were allowed on it despite the age limit being 60!"
99,Winter visit,Spent 2-3 hours here and it was breathtaking in many ways.  Unbelievable views of the mountains and the wall.  It can be a very taxing climb both getting to the wall and then on the wall.  Steps are uneven and some can be quite tall.  It is well worth it if you are physically able to do it.
100,Great views!!,This was by far the best part of the Great Wall to visit as it was practically empty! Zero crowds but very challenging walk. We walked for an hour and a half up and down the various sized stairs (including stops for photos) before reaching the cafe where you can opt to take a chair lift down or ride the toboggan! It’s super fun but make sure to allow time for the people in front to go down so you can ride at maximum speed. This was the highlight of my trip to China and I’d highly recommend using China Discovery for this tour.
101,must see!,We took a Viatour day tour beginning early in the morning.  Tour guide walked us through Forbidden city before heading north to the wall.  There wasn’t really a choice but to take the ski lift up in order to spend the two hours allotted on the wall.  We rode down in Bill Clinton’s lift car.  The gates aren’t labeled so we needed to watch the time to know when to turn around and come back although the walk back was quicker than the assent.  It was a little hard to avoid photo bombing people’s selfies even though it wasn’t very crowded.  Don’t bother with the jade store or the tea stop that were included in tour if you can avoid them
102,Not too crowded,"I’ve been fortunate to see this part of the wall three times and it never disappoints, especially with first time visitors. It’s an easy visit, and well worth a visit. If you go in the winter, it’s incredible. Cold, but pretty."
103,Breathtaking,"the air was clean, the sky clear and perfect for the 21/2 hour walk up and down the great wall.it was a thrill, so glad I went"
104,Great experience,We went to Muyianyu in the perfect timing. The weather was amazing around 25 degree and it was a nice breeze. It was not to much people and we just lived every second of it. There was plenty of stops eith drinks and toilets. The sad part is when tourists don't respect this historical place and they throw rubbish. It's so disrespectful and we got really upset when we saw trash here and there.
105,"Amazing , Amazing !!!",I have been to 2 other sections of the Great Wall and this bar far is the best experience. If you want to ride the toboggan down from the top then you should take the gondola up to section 6 and the toboggan down if your adventurous. If you are not going to do that then I would take the gondola up to section 14 and take the gondola back down. Section 14 is much higher and the views are incredible. If you have small children DO NOT take the toboggan down. I feel it would be very dangerous.
106,Incredible!,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed climbing this portion of the Great Wall. It thrills you to know that this construction was erected over 2000 years ago and helped protect China from her enemies. Please note that you do need a reasonable level of fitness to tackle the wall as it is quite steep in parts and I saw a number of people struggle and one take a serious fall
107,Indeed a Wonder ,Was on a tour that went here. We took the cable car up and a few steps we were on the wall and it felt like I was on top of the world.  A must do and see if in Beijing
108,Step in chinese's long history here,"This is such a beautiful part of the Great Wall.  Personally I feel it is more breathtaking than the Badaling section and less crowded.  The facilities at Mutianyu is good too with many restaurants and clean public bathroom facilities throughout the attraction (always bring toilet paper).  We hired a private car from drivers just outside of our hotel.  The return charge from Beijing to Mutianyu was RMB700 (RMB18 toll road charge each way is not included).  Once we reached the base of Mutianyu, the driver purchased the attraction tickets for us.  The tickets included the shuttle bus ride to the next level, then a cable car and entry to the wall.  For a family of 4 (2x students applies for the wall entry), all those tickets costed RMB680. The cable car ride is already RMB120 pp return, so if you are super fit, there’s a well paved track to the top of the wall.  Even with the cable car, there is still a 300-400m of fairly steep uphill walk and steps.  We left the hotel at 9:30am, got to the wall at 11:30am.  Including a quick lunch Mutianyu before visiting the wall, we left at 2pm and returned to Beijing around 4pm.  We went on Saturday in early January."
109,Great Experience,I just got back from a ten day trip in China and it was amazing. My wife and I visited the Great Wall and had a wonderful time. Be prepared for a lot of climbing. This is definitely a workout. But it’s worth every step. Also the scenery is breathtaking.
110,Scenic place with very little crowd,"Went on a weekday tour which comes with transfer service, cable car and lunch. Not duffcult to climb which my 4 year old son managed to walk up and the stairs of great wall in mutianyu. However that still mean we need certain amount of strength and stamina :)"
111,Scenic and breathing. Picturescque,"A suggestion to travellers:Arrive into Mutianyu the evening before you want to visit the Wall. Get up around 8am, have a relaxing breakfast and then visit the wall before the throngs of tour groups (international tourists, school groups, etc) arrive.Typically, for each photographable section, there were only a few people and if you were patient you could have uninterrupted wall views."
112,Amazing Experience,"This is the most ""touristy"" section of the wall but if you have friends coming to visit or its your first time then it is by far the most accessible. This section is the wall is stroller and wheelchair friendly. There is a cable car as well, if you don't wish to climb all the stairs. Also note; there are plenty of buses heading up here from the train station, or getting a taxi is fairly well priced as well. I recommend buying tickets beforehand; if you are staying in a hotel they can arrange this for you. You can buy them on entrance as well; it just means if there is a long line of people you get to head in before them."
113,Fun but not amazing ,"Love visiting the Great Wall at Mutianyu! Visiting during the winter was freezing, literally, but still enjoyed going. It’s about a 2 hour drive from Beijing city center but worth the trip."
114,The Great Wall - take the local bus,It took an hour and half from downtown Beijing. At Mutianyu we took a shuttle bus and then a cable car to the top of the wall to watchtower 14. The wall wasn't crowded. An incredible structure. We made it to around watchtower 17 or 18 with a three year old.
115,Worth the visit,"We went in early November, and had sunny skies to climb the hill to the tram, which helped as I think the walk might be a bit slippery in the rain.  Lots of tourists, but able to get around to walk some on the Wall.  Great views from the wall, and some repairs to the wall have made it safer.  This is not a safe trip up the hill or onto the wall for anyone handicapped with canes or wheelchair."
116,Great hike on the Geat Wall!,"When we arrived in Beijing and after looking at the weather forecast and knowing that the weather will be good the next day, we booked with Mubus, a bus company which is driving you to the wall and organising the tickets for the wall and cable car, if needed. Firstly, I just booked the transfer and entrance, but then at the bus we could buy the ticket for the cable car, too, which turned out to be the best choice. If going by foot you need at least half an hour, so when we arrived at the top by cable car there were no people around and we felt being alone at the wall. It was always a dream seeing the Great Wall, but having it nearly for yourself was spectacular."
117,Geat Wall was amazing after it snowed!,"Great experience for me and my 12-year old son! The ride up provided a stunning view and the ride down was sheer fun. But the wall itself, and the history of the wall, was captivating. We went in November so it was really (really) cold. Bring gloves, especially for the toboggan ride down. And wear sturdy shoes for the uneven floors and many, many steps. The views from the watchtowers are incredible--you'll want to take photos. We kept our visit short--maybe an hour and a half walking on the wall--which was just right for my son's attention span."
118,Great part of wall,We arrived in Bejing with cold weather but was greated with respect by Hyatt Staff until Check in. We visited Great Wall of China driving almost 1 hour and the view and facilities there are fantastic.The people are friendly and we have no problem visiting Great Wall of China.
119,Great visit of the China wall,"We visited Mutianyu Great Wall on October 29, no much crowd and the ride on the cable and down by the luge was smooth. From the main entrance to the cable car station take about 8 minutes walk.  We were told not to patronize the stall up in the great wall and it is true, they charged much more than the stores at the base.  A cup of coffee (instant mixed) cost CNY45!   On the whole, the beautiful view up at the great wall is worth all the walk."
120,"Great, but skip the shop at the top","Mutianyu is the best place to visit the Great Wall - it's less popular' than other portions so you avoid jousting with the large crowds and yet it features some of the most spectacular parts of the Great Wall. A large number of guard towers within a short distance along the wall allows you to experience the environment in different ways. It's a bit of a steep walk up the road from the village at the base to the gondola to ride to the top of the wall, so plan on either taking your time or hire one of the carts rides to cover the distance."
121,Excellent fun,"We had a great time on this trip. Just the right amount of time, and full of good exercise, and excellent view. It was great that our tour started early in the morning, as it was not crowded, all the way to tower 20. By around 1pm, the area started to get busy.; fortunately, we were already on our way back to tower 14. We booked lunch with this tour, and it was excellent. Our tour guide, Qiang, and the driver, Chen, were very helpful, funny and knowledgeable."
122,Clear day for a walk on the wall.,"I climbed Bataling and Mutianyu and I have to say Mutianyu is so much easier to climb. You need to pay for cable car and it brings in to Watch Tower 14. From there you can get quite a good view of the Great Wall. Also because it is further out, crowd is much thinner. Overall, a great experience."
123,Short and sweet,"If you are wondering which of the great walls to go, i will highly recommend this one at Mutianyu! Lesser tourist, public transport available and coupled with the great views on offer."
124,Definitely worth the trip and the visit,Incredible experience. its a great feeling to stand on the wall and imagine what went into building the wall and the battles that took place. Unless you are very fit I suggest taking the cable car to the top.
125,Like they say you are a hero if you step on great wall of china,"Less crowded than the 'tourist favorite' Badaling, this 3 km portion of the Great Wall features some 26 Ming-era guard towers,  with excellent views. If you don't fancy the climb up or the walk down you can take a cable car ride up and do a 'relaxing' toboggan ride down!!"
126,Great view,A very nice section of the Great Wall. Not too far from the city. Steep steps leading up to the proper walk on the wall.Several restaurants between parking an wall. You can also use a chair lift to go up (imnstead of the cable car) and go down on a sldge.
127,Great wall,"A must see attraction in China! With many tour options please choose wisely as the Mutianyu section the Wall is the least visited and so worth to avoid the crowds. This is a day trip so plan  accordingly. I booked a two day combo advertised here however day one of the tour is not really worthy. Going up the mountain the lift chair fee is not included in the tour price and the most fun part is the descent via the toboggan, a sliding car that will take you back to the base."
128,Time of the day to avoid crowds,This part of the wall is very scenic. Autumn is a beautiful time to visit. It’s an easy day trip from Beijing so be sure to plan it in your itinerary.
129,Easy Wall to Climb,"The Wall was a Wall. I was underwhelmed, but realize I am in the minority. This climb up was steep but manageable. The views were amazing. The toboggan ride was fun, not super fast."
130,Crowded but AMAZING experience,"Even in a normal day, many people were visiting. I feel quite crowded and hard to walk in some places. My expectation and reality didn't match. But the great wall is very good, its huge, long wall."
131,Lifetime experience,"I kept seeing pictures of the crowds at the Great Wall.  Well, not when we were there.  We had the place practically to ourselves for almost 2 hours.  Get there early!  Glorious!"
132,Great Visit to the Great Wall,Had an enjoyable time at Mutianyu Great Wall. Took the slide down and it was really fun! Highly recommended to go for the Toobonga if you are here! Our tour guide Michael was really friendly and attentive.
133,The Wall,Easily accessible and really nice views. Absolutly a must when in Beijing. Get there in the morning is possible. You’re basically alone then before the big crowds comes.
134,Something amazing to see. A once in a lifetime event.,"The Great Wall is an icon of China and is a must-visit. There are many parts of the wall you can opt to visit, but I recommend the Mutianyu area. Great views.You have the option to climb up to the wall via stairs or ride a cable-car for a fee. Climbing up is a great experience I highly recommend, but it is indeed very tiring. This is one thing you must consider. It was winter when I visited, with temperatures less than 5 degrees celsius, but I ended up sweaty when I arrived at the wall! Don't regret it, though!Going down you also have the option to walk, ride the cable car, or whiz down by toboggan slide. I chose to ride the slide, which was a bit expensive, but was very, very thrilling. The views while riding were amazing, and although the speed is a bit fast, you would never feel unsafe. If you can, ride the slide! I believe it's only available at the Mutianyu Great Wall!"
135,Amazing Great Wall! ,It’s an amazing global landmark.... but not the most user friendly.  So here are a few considerations:  wear good walking/hiking shoes.... the steps can be steep and irregular.   Plan on about a 1.5 mile hike on the wall (after the gondola ride and turn right heading to return “slide”.).....you will encounter a variety uphill and downhill terrain....but more downhill and less tiring on your legs....bring water to keep hydrated-no services on the wall or restrooms except at “slide” station (where you can enjoy a beer with spectacular views).....Hopefully you don’t mind getting up early to get out Beijing and get to the site early in the day.... say leave by 8am at the latest to arrive by 10an to avoid the arrival of large tour buses.  There didn’t seem to be much variation in walking the Great Wall... the towers seem to be relatively similar and no historical displays are found inside....It is a marvel to imagine the construction of the Great Wall with basic tools and its durability.....The terrain at this location is impressive too....The “slide” is fun and a quick ride down to the base station....Plenty of souvenir shops and food await your return
136,Good great wall,"We  were thrilled to visit the Great Wall . It was an incredible visit for all 7 couples from Florida , USA . It was physically challenging for those with limited mobility. However, it was an accomplishment to climb the wall."
137,One off my bucket list,This is a friendly city where residents are helpful and respectful.  The Great Wall in itself is a great wonder and a must-see.  Our guide was very helpful and made the experience not only educational (think of all the history and significance) but also enjoyable and fun.
138,"The better, quieter choice (than Badaling)","I went to Mutianyu taking the Mubus which was very convenient. Its an uphill slope to get to the cablecar and chairlift but you get nice views as you walk. I expected the place to be filled with just a handful of people since people kept telling me that only foreigners go to Mutianyu and its really few people. Its definitely not crowded like Badaling but there are crowds at various areas of the wall itself and also around the base of Mutianyu. I feel like the place is becoming more popular with the locals too. Not that it is a bad thing. After you reach tower 14 and go up that short stairs to get on the wall itself, you can turn left to go up to tower 20 or turn right to tower 6 and lower. My cousins went to tower 20 while I decided that I could not leave the place without taking the toboggan and also my legs were dead after the stairs at Summer Palace and more stairs everywhere else. Tower 14 to 6 is a breeze. Its easy, the steps are really low and wide and not tiring at all. Of course the views aren’t as spectacular as the ones you get at the higher towers but its still not too shabby. Its mostly stairs or slope going down with just 2 or 3 stairs going up which are nothing difficult at all. With really tired legs, I managed it quite easily. The entrance to the toboggan was at the side of the wall and very easy to miss. So you need to watch out for it if that is your aim. I think it was on the right as you come down from tower 14. And the sign at the small opening says ‘Shopping Area’ and ‘ Great Wall Footpath’. Go down the stairs and turn left and its on your right after a small cafe or souvenir shop. The ride is very safe. You actually have to push the lever down alot and with strength if you wish to accelerate. If you dont touch the lever at all, it wont move. You have their staff standing every few metres to watch out for you in case anything happens and mostly they are telling people to slow down or to be quicker since there’s no problem with the ride. Its about 10mins for me since I didnt go exactly very fast. When you start, they let you go in batches. And they flag you off one by one to create a safe distance with each person. I love the ride so much that I want to go back to Mutianyu just for the ride. I will take the chairlift to tower 6 and take the toboggan down."
139,A dream comes true!,Visited the Great Wall with wife and friend. The fact that the weather was beautiful caused us to forget the immense crowds. Everything was well organised and moved well. To walk on the wall you could feel the history. Massive experience that will live we me forever.
140,Breathtaking.,"A must see. Lived up to all of my expectations, and given the beautiful weather, much much more. If you're looking to save money, just pay the 45RMB park entrance and walk up to the wall. It only takes 45 minutes up evenly spaced steps and you'll be at the wall."
141,Visit to the great wall,It was really enjoyable to visit the MuTianYu Great Wall in winter. We took the cable car up and the speed slide down. It was amazing looking at the Great Wall with snow. Kids had a fun time playing with the snow there.
142,Best preserved section of the wall,"Possibly the best section to go to especially during the winter season! You basically could get the whole place to yourself! The view was magnificent! However couldn’t ride the toboggan down, as it was snowing earlier. But it was worth it to be at the top!"
143,Such a great icon to visit,This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.  We got amazing pictures with no one else in the background because there were so few people at this location.  Great climbing opportunities and different difficulties offered at this location.  This is the site to visit if you want to see the Great Wall.
144,Mutianyy Great Wall,"We spend the afternoon touring this unbelievable site. Some uneven stair climbing was required, as was a bit of hiking around the site and on the wall"
145,best view of the Great Wall,"If you opt for going up this section of the Great Wall by Chair Lift then please be prepared to get on and off real quick because you could hurt yourself really badly if you have long legs. Older people would be better off going by the cable car. If you opt for chair lift there are two options to come down, by tobogan or by the same chair lift. I had a bad bruise on my leg as it got caught under the seat when moving forward. Definitely not for older people. Also you got to hold on tight to your belongings. There are attendants to help you on and off but if your not quick enough you could get hurt."
146,The Better Part of the Great Wall,The Mutianyu Great Wall is indeed a wonder of the world ....one should experience it once in a lifetime! The top can be reached either by hiking or cable car . The tickets can be bought at the base and then shuttle buses take you to a point . After that one has to walk till the cable car which takes you to the top .The place is crowded with tourists so one take into account the waiting time in queues .There are shops at the base to buy souvenirs and clothes. Restaurants are available like Subway etc The place is well organised and once on the top it’s a world apart !
147,This is a wall,this is a great stretch of wall to visit.Cable car to the top and toboggan down.The food options are limited here though
148,Once in a lifetime opportunity.,We walked sections 5 to 1 and it took us about an hour and a half with 1000 steps each way. Was worth it but we were glad we took the cable car up.  We rode the tabogan back which we loved (No photos can be taken while you are on the tabogan)
149,2 days China unplugged,"We chose mutianyu instead of badaling to avoid the massive tourist . It was a nice sunny Jan . We took the transfer bus , the guile’s helped with ticket for cable car and son on . Then we have almost three hours free time to wander on the wall . Lots photo shoot ,and we made us to the top . It was a fantastic experience ."
150,Worth  a visit,"Was the best part of my trip, Be prepared for a workout, steep steps  steps and inclines.  I walked from tower 6 (where the tram drops you off..remember this is where you also take tram to go down the mountain) to tower 18.  I was exhausted.  comfortable shoes, water eny the beauty and history."
151,Walk on the Great Wall!,Highly recommended to climb this part of the great wall. Less crowded amd also quite challenging. Breath taking views!
152,Benny as great as the Great Wall,"This section of the Great Wall is reputedly the most beautiful part of the wall so it is definitely worth a visit. It naturally gets very crowded but it is a beautiful site to visit. Built in the early 15th Century, this section truly is spectacular as it snakes along the contours of the mountain. Take comfortable shoes and for the best experience be prepared to walk quite a distance along the wall."
153,"Lots of climbing, beautiful views ","Wow! It's amazing. There is quite a bit of uphill walking just to get to the skycar after you take the shuttle. Then at the wall, the steps are very steep and not uniform. It is nice to see that there are public toilets there. It gets very crowded so go as early as you can. We left Beijing at 6:45am."
154,Incredible Wall,"It was a very pleasant autumn day. We took Zanbus to Mutianyu, the bus was very well organised. We chose to take the cable car up to Watch Tower 14 and walked to the top Watch tower 20 and walk down to Watch Tower 6. We found that was a good choice, my husband and I both do regular exercises we still find the last 100 meters of walking up 45 degrees steeps was a little challenging.Walking downhill was easier than we thought. The scenery was beautiful, except that day the air was a little bit hazy. The whole area was well maintained and clean. The view of the Great Wall is always magical!"
155,Magnificent views of wall and mountains,We had Leo as the tour guide. He made the trip enjoyable and was really coherent with his explanations
156,"Very Few Tourists, and Great Views!","Best spot to experience the Great Wall!!!  About 30-45min drive by car from Beijing. Park in parking structure, (tons of souvenir shops there too), take shuttle bus to the “ski“ lift (fabulous views!!!!) and you’re up there!!!!  Trees, panoramic views, such a cool experience!!! Take your time taking it all in & make sure to wear good shoes - lots of uneven/cobble stone steps up & down. But THE BEST part is taking the tobaggon/slide on the way down!!!!!!!!! Unforgettable!!!! You can go as slow or as fast as you’d like!"
157,You can’t miss it,Try climbing the wall all the way from the cute coffee shop at the bottom to the highest level possible. I did and it was fantastic.
158,No words to describe the beauty!!,"Trekked from tower 9 to 1 and back. Tobogan ride down was a lot of fun. Views from towers 1,6,3 are exhilirating."
159,A MUST SEE BUCKET LIST ITEM,You have to visit The Great Wall in order to really experience the beauty and the Marvel of such human engineering feat. Mind blown!
160,The World’s Longest Wall,Highly recommend visiting this part of the wall and towards the end of the day. We went from 1:30pm-3:30pm and there were not a lot of other people which was great. Difficult stairs to climb up and down but if you take your time it’s doable. Beautiful 360 views. Very cool piece of history to take in and be able to enjoy hundreds of years later. Recommend going up the chair lift and down the slide way.
161,Excellent attraction.  Must do with Odynovo Tour Guides,"The great wall is on many peoples bucket list, as it should be. An amazing feat of construction over many hundreds and hundreds of years. Prior to our China trip we watched quite a few Youtube videos on the great wall, and most suggested the Mu Tian Yu portion to see because of less crowds. Wouldn't you know, out tour had us going to badaling portion, but we changed it and glad we did. The views from this section were great. The chairlift to the top of the wall was effortless and great views on the way up. The wall itself, in great condition although steep in areas but not too crowded at all. The optional louge run to get down was fun too. (you can take the chairlift down)"
162,Amazing Way to See the Great Wall,"Visited the part of Mutianyu. During the time I went there it was actually relatively quiet. Enough people but no huge crowds. You could comfortably walk around and no long queues at the cable car and so on. Views very good, Mutianyu part had been restored. Therefore good and safe walking paths along the wall. Used public transport to get to Mutianyu. Express bus 916 from Beijing Dongzhimen bus station and got off at HuaiRou Bei Da Jjie (怀柔北大街). From here took bus H23 to the Mutianyu Roundabout stop, where most of the people get off. Journey by public transport is a bit complex when not mastering any Chinese. Beware of taxi drivers approaching you at the bus stop in HauiRou to persuade you to take taxi."
163,Ride the chair life up and take the toboggan down,Mutianyu is the place is for those who don't really like to climb up to the great wall as they provide the cable car to go up. The view is very nice and you may walk up to tower 21 from tower 14 (if I am not mistaken). Better to take the tour package because it will take you about 2 hours time from downtown Beijing. It is a must-visit if you are travelling to Beijing.
164,Incredible experience!,"Tons of steps. Cool giftshops with good prices, even though you can bargain. Not much to eat. But it's a great experience."
165,Thank you Lily!,Finally we were there! The views were amazing and an unforgettable journey to be walking on 2200 years of history... A surreal experience... Something to strike off the bucket list!
166,Amazing,"Book the two ways bus, entrance and cable car ticket via klook, China Apps need to book with China mobile number. You can book private car with your hotel as well.The cable car will reach to 14th watch tower. You can either walk to 20th and come back to 14th to catch the cable car or walk downward to 6th watch tower for another rides."
167,An Adventure ,"Worth the long drive, not to crowded & 2 easy ways to get up & 3 ways to get down. Awesome & very powerful place to see. Especially to think they built this on the top of these mountains back in the 1400’s"
168,Great Wall,"We went on a bright an sunny cold winters day. There were hardly any tourists so we had the wall pretty much to ourselves. We walked along the wall for hours, with magical views to both sides. Parts of it are very steep - so wear good walking shoes. It was a fantastic experience."
169,Grand,"This section is a little further out from Beijing than others which mean that there are somewhat fewer tourists and hence a more enjoyable experience. But including time at the Great Wall, this will require half a day. The village at the bottom is at around 400m altitude and the cable car takes you up to the Wall at 540m. We were lucky that it was a very sunny blue sky day and the views were awesome. The Great Wall is in a good condition here and although it is steep in places and rough under foot in places; it is reasonably ease to walk around sections."
170,Wow,About and hours drive out of central Beijing with easy parking at the visitor centre at the foot of the hills.You can either walk up the 800+ steps to get to the wall or do what we did and get the cable car. I was wary to begin with thinking it would make the wall seem a little like a theme park but the cable car station at the wall end is well done and 'ties in' with its surroundings.Not the easiest walking on the wall with several steep sections but take your time and enjoy it. Weather was clear and mild in early November and not overcrowded
171,Breathtaking,The China wall is beautiful. The path from the village to the wall is steep but not too difficult. For a fee you can ride the cable car up (return price 120)
172,Convenient visit to the Great Wall,"We arrived  at the great wall about 8.30 in the morning  to beat the crowds, from the drop off point it's about a 600 metre walk to the cable car which is quiet steep walk. The cable car takes about 2/3 minutes to get to the wall or if you are feeling energetic you can walk up. On reaching the top you can go  left or right, the left is the easier of the 2 options  we spent about 1 1/2 hours on the wall the views are magnificent  if the weather's good. You have 2 options to go down ,the cable car or the tobboggan  which you will have to buy tickets for before you go up.there is a souvenir  shop just before the cable car but it is quite expensive  for cold drinks a 600ml bottle of beer cost about 80 yuan but worth it  on a hot day"
173,Absolutely amazing!!,What an amazing trip this was. One of the world wonders. Truly remarkable. Be aware of the slippery roads.
174,Unreal,"Hike up, otherwise the cable car line takes 2 hours or more. Best done early or before closing. Loved the view!"
175,Stunning,"Visited the Wall on November 11. Wife and I hired a taxi that took about 1-1/2 hrs from Beijing's Park Plaza Hotel Wangfujing. Upon arrival, we purchased tickets with no waiting as we got there around 8:45 am on a weekday. Paid for the bus ticket that takes you a little ways up the hill, before transferring onto the ski lift type tram.  Worth the price since it's a decent hike up the stairs to the Great Wall.  Save yourself the  energy for hiking on the Wall itself. Cable car lets you off at tower 14. From there you can choose to walk to the left or right along the Wall.    We hiked for about 2-1/2 hours round trip, making a left when we got to the wall.  Could not go further beyond tower 23. Going early enabled us to avoid any heavy crowds.  There are some fairly steep uphill portions, especially the last stair leading to Tower 23.  You literally will be climbing the stairs with help from your hands on the steps above you. Definitely worth the time to climb the Wall."
176,China trip ,"Great wall, Mutianyu. Yes more touristy. Easy enough to catch cable car up & down. Walking along top not hard. Steps of course. Can walk for miles but so beautiful & historic. Would thoroughly recommend going there plus other great wall places."
177,Spectacular!,"This was a perfect section, we went 9am - 4pm, longer than expected but ended up that way because its so stunning. The main towers near the cable car are obviously busy with tourists but you'll only need to walk a couple towers either side to get away from the groups, there's not much of a climb so perfect if you just want to walk casually. The further you walk the quieter it gets. Tower 19 to 20 is 400 steps and is a massive climb but well worth the view. Tower 6 has the luge or ski lift down. The luge is controlled by staff ensuring you go slow, if you want to go abit faster I recommend waiting until a queue has gone. We went up by cable car and walked to tower 20 then walked to tower 6 with a toilet stop at tower 15. Getting to the wall at the start you need to park at the ticket office then get the bus to the starting point. Locals complained of tour buses cramming the area so they set up this system instead, it worked really well. We had a really awesome tour guide sort everything out for us called Alvin Benton, totally recommend him. He knew so much and it made the experience so much more special and interesting. He then took us to a local dumpling restaurant afterwards which was excellent. We thought we didn't need a tour guide but his tips and stories made our day easier and memorable. He was so flexible and helpful, really lovely guy and great English. He's well worth the fee between 750-1050rmb depending on what you want. alvinbenton@yahoo.com"
178,Mutianyu Great wall ,"The wall is more than 10 km long, it's possible to trek it if you have a strong stamina but the view is spectacular. Me and my brother used the cable car to travel to one of the entrance points of the Great Wall itself then we used the exhilarating sliding ride back towards the exit."
179,Beautiful and Strenuous - Some Data,"If you want to see one more place before you die, Great wall is the place to visit. This section of the wall is most preserved, kind of easy to walk with the most beautiful sights of the Great wall."
180,Mutyanyu on your own,"This is a most beautiful part of the world , it was first time for our family and we were speechless. I wish we could have spent more time there but we were on a tour.I strongly suggest you don’t go on a tour to this place. Go there so you can spend as much time as you want. The walk from tower 14 to 20 is  amazing but not for the unfit or elderly ."
181,A Must Do,"Oh my gosh, were do I began, the entire experience was amazing! My sister and I were traveling to Hong Kong in April of 2019 and  wanted to visit the Great Wall while in China. I don't recommend doing what we did, but thank God that it worked out really well for us. We didn't have much time in Beijing, so once we obtained our 144 hours transit visa, we waited around the airport until 7am and by the doors of PEK airport there were people soliciting rides to the wall. The ride to the wall was less than 1.5 hours and once we got there the taxi driver parked in the parking structure and we were able to purchase our tickets from inside. We had the option to purchase the cable car ride along with the ticket, which we did. My sister purchased the tickets and I'm thinking it's because they didn't accept credit cards, so be mindful of that and make sure, before getting there. There was an ATM there in the lobby though.  My only complaint with the ticket purchase was that we paid extra for our ticket as it had like a postcard attached to it and we didn't understand the addition in fee when they sold it to us, so if you're not interested in the expensive post card, then make sure to get the cheaper ticket.Once we got our tickets, we then walked and waited no more than 15 minutes for the free shuttle bus that takes you up to the entrance,  that is full of freaking wide stairs! Anywho, once you make it up there we went on the scariest cable car up into the freaking trees to the wall! Okay it was a really nice and new cable car with an excellent and safe set up, I'm just terrified of heights thus was NOT ideal for me, but I mustered through with hands over my face and a few tears shed, but once we got there I was like a kid at Disneyworld! I was in total awe, it was amazing! Many of the stairs are very steep to go up to the watch tower portions, but it's worth conquering the fears that you may have! I'm soo thankful that we went. Oh we went in early April and I was freezing! The sun was out, but I was super cold. I had on thick athletic leggings, long sleeve tee-shirt, hooded sweater, and gloves and my sister had to give me her coat! But again it was worth it!Upon your departure there's places to buy food, nothing too desirable, but if you're starving, it would serve it's purpose. There's also tons of shops where you can purchase items and souvenirs."
182,Nice view at Mutianyu,"We had Stop over in Beijing and booked tour to great wall.Herbie was our guide . He was waiting on or meeting point and was in sms contact before. I took a 24h visa , and that took approx. 1,5 h waiting in line. 30minutes at teh free visa counter ( cross over E11) than 45 minutes at Foreigner Visitor entry.We got excellent discretion how to process 24 h free Visa in advance by Beijing Layover Tour Organization.We were picked up by Mrs Yang, an excellent driver and went to the great wall. Herbie took care to buy the tickets and support me to buy ticket for the toboggan run return from the wall ( very funny ) Tour was done in perfect  English, never meet a Chinese guy speaking English without chinses dialect. :-) Herbie also spoke some  German wordsWe went up by a lifter and got multiple extreme nice  pictures done by Herbie our tour guide. He knows the best hotspots on the wall to get fantastic picture .He is a great Foto Shooter :-)After the tour we drove back to Airport.Drive was approx. 45 minutes . We had Stop over in Peking for 10 hours ."
183,Dream come true,"This is one of the seven wonder that we are looking forward to. However, our experience turned out to be a little disappointed based on our experience. Firstly, the location is not quite accessible via public transport and the public transport it is not foreigners friendly because there is no English sign which one needs to speak/ read Chinese in order to get around. After some research online through some traveller bloggers, we managed to find our ways getting to Mutianyu by public transport. First, take metro to Dongzhimen metro station, then proceed to exit C to public bus station (note that there is no clear sign which you may have to ask around to navigate). At the bus station, take 916快(which means 916Express). Make sure you have the Beijing transport card “易通卡”which works like Octopus Card in London, so that you can tap in and out of the bus. If you pay cash, there will be no change given, so make sure you have small notes. Bus916快 will have indication of the name of next destination, but it’s all in Chinese. You need to alight at bus stop named 怀柔北大街. Then, transfer to a taxi to Mutianyu Great Wall. Try to look for taxi in blue colour which is the local taxi by meter. The taxi ride should cost 40-50yuan. Some taxi driver may ask for 50yuan directly. Do not pay more than 50yuan per ride as that is the maximum standard charge even by meter. The same method to go back, but it can be a hassle to wait for taxi when going back. Take note that some taxi driver will bring you to some touts trying to sell you entrance tickets to Mutianyu Great Wall which we encountered. Just turned down politely and proceed to ticket counter to purchase the entrance tickets. Entrance fee plus shuttle bus to the Mutianyu entrance is 60yuan, cable car ride is 100yuan one way. We took cable car up which reach tower 14, then walked up to tower 23 and return to tower 6 and took toboggan down at 100yuan. It is cheaper to take return ride for cable car or chairlift up and toboggan ride down which cost 120yuan for return trip respectively. Otherwise, the single ride will be 100yuan per ride since both cable car service and chairlift/ toboggan service are run by two different companies. Because we wanted to go up to tower 23 from tower 14 (where the cable car station is located), then walked down to tower 6 to take toboggan down which will cover most of the beautiful sides of Mutianyu. And, toboggan ride was really fun, so make sure you try the ride to end your trip at Mutianyu. It took us 4 hours to complete the trek. Second disappointment was that the whole place is very commercialised with pricey food and drinks. We had brunch at one of the Chinese restaurants named Traditional Beijing Noodle 老北京 (shown in the photo), which the food was terribly salty. Both the stew tofu and wanton soup that we ordered tasted like salted food which we hardly can finish them despite our hunger. The service attitude of the restaurant was very bad too. Before going down by toboggan, we had drinks at one of the drinks stall. Guess what?! A bottle of coke that usually cost 5yuan in Beijing city was charged at 45yuan at the drink stall. It was a blatant daylight robbery!!! Also, there are not many toilets along the trek, even at the drink stall at tower 6, so it’s very challenging for anyone with weak bladder. We visited in early September on a scorching day at 36 degree celcius. Cooler weather may make the trek more pleasant, but will be more crowded too. We Glad that we did it at least once in a life time to witness the extensive architecture of this Seven Wonder, built since 7th BC. Few tips for traveller who wants to explore the Great Wall at Mutianyu: 1) Start early, possibly take the first bus to avoid crowds which you can take many beautiful photos without human/ crowd obstructions. 2) Go during cooler weather, which also means it will be much more crowded. 3) Bring enough drinking water and pack your breakfast/ lunch box to avoid paying a bomb for expensive yet terrible food (refer to the restaurant we went)! 4) Beware of touts trying to sell marked up price tickets, just purchase it from ticket counter. 5) Some fitness level required even this is the most restored part of Great Wall. Do at your own pace, don’t rush. 6) Tobbogan ride is a must to end the trip with a fun ride! 7) If you are looking for more beautiful site (online info) where is less crowded, go to Jin Shan Ling part of Great Wall instead, but it will be further from Beijing about 2 hours car ride."
184,It is that Great!,Hey dont go past this if in Beijing. Bring cash if you want a drink or snack on the way and if you go in winter good footwear (snow is slippery).
185,An Autumn Morning At Mutianyu,"Less crowded and also quite challenging. Breath taking views! It's quite easy to visit, as the majority of the climbing is done by the gondola, which takes you up to an observation platform."
186,Nice view ,"Others have commented on the beauty of the wall and surrounding area, and I concur. It is beautiful and unbelievably cool! It’s worth the trip and price of admission!We went in mid November. Temperature was a couple degrees below freezing when we started hiking around 10 am and a few degrees above freezing when we finished. It was windy, particularly in the valley but less so on the wall. So dress warmly but in layers because the wall can be strenuous. At this time of year, take hat and gloves. We took the enclosed cable car (rather than chair lift) because the temperature and wind. R/T 240 RMB. A very pleasant way up to the wall. While you could walk up, save your exercise for later. This section of the wall has towers numbered 1 through 20. The cable car comes in at 14. Around tower 14 is probably one of the flattest section of the wall as you head toward tower 15. But it is not flat. It rolls, sometimes on an incline, sometimes on steps. We hiked from tower 14 up to tower 20 and then down to Tower 6 and back up to tower 14. My Apple Watch reported that was about 1600 vertical feet over ~3.5 miles round trip. The final pitch of stairs up to Tower 20 is very steep. So this hike is not for the faint of heart - it is challenging even for those who are fit.You don’t need to hike the length to enjoy the beauty. And I wouldn’t necessarily say any portion was better than another. So definitely go even if you aren’t prepared for major exertion."
187,Surreal Experience!,Well worth the drive to get there.  Amazing place.  Very steep climb not for the unfit or disabled.  Toilets were good.  Shops were good helpful staff.  Plenty to look at.
188,Amazing,"Absolutely stunning! We visited two days ago, and luckily the weather was not too bad, with a temperature of 7°C. There were no crowds and one could stroll at their leisure. Everything still had a bit of a white sprinkle over it, making the wall even more spectacular - having said that, no trip to China would be complete without visiting the wall. We took the shuttle as it does seem as quite a distance to walk uphill, approx 3km. The cable car was also a wonderful experience."
189,Mr ,"I was travelling with my two grandson aged 8 and 14 and they were as overwhelmed as I was, actually standing on the Great Wall."
190,Amazing ,"We visited in the off season and the temperatures were cold, something like -5 but no crowds and we were dressed appropriately so worth a trip at this time of year."
191,Awesome experience of a lifetime,"Lovely views, and well preserved area of the wall. Fun coming down on a Taboggan, even if a little comercialised!"
192,"Less crowded, great views",Great Wall great place . I really liked how everything was organized here .perfect visit no issues .
193,The Great Wall Experience! ,"For heart patients and older people this place has a cable car.   And then just a few more steps and you’re comfortably on the wall.  Walking it And taking in the beautiful sight.  We were there to see red, orange green.  The beauty of autumn."
194,Go!,"Fantastic snow resort at the great wall, this place is a must visit and visitors are encourage to spend more time here - either at the great wall or to soak in the ambience at the resort town with the many restaurant and cafe bar to enjoy"
195,One of the truly must see places in the world!!!,"If you have an opportunity to see the Great Wall, particularly on a layover using the 24-144 transit visa, there is no reason not to see it! To see this Wonder of the World and to understand the sheer architectural feat that it is remains truly incredible and impressive.The Mutianyu portion of the wall is DEFINITELY less crowded. Per my guide, going in the afternoons (as we did) is optimal, as it is more crowded early in the am. We quite possibly saw no more than about 30-35 different people on the expanse of wall that we traversed - between Towers 6 & 8. We took the Chair Lift up and the toboggan down (so much fun!) - which I would encourage. You can also take a separate lift up to the higher towers, but would not be able to do the toboggan which is only located near gate 6.Warning for people with knee issues - while some of the steps are not super steep, they are uneven - with some shallow and some steeper steps, which may make things more complicated with some of the inclines."
196,"A little longer drive, but worth it","Took a private tour but there are many tour operators. Mutianyu is the best preserved part of the wall and a good hike. Plan a full day and wear comfortable shoes. Need local money for chair-lift going up and toboggan gen ride coming down, unless walking up and down. Great history and a guide can be very useful."
197,Breathtaking!,"As this is further away from Beijing, it is less frequented by teeming hoardes of people.  I enjoyed this area very much."
198,Well Worth It!,"This is worthwhile seeing for several reasons - the scenery, the history involved in the wall, seeing the sheer scale of what was done.  It's quite easy to visit, as the majority of the climbing is done by the gondola, which takes you up to an observation platform.  From here you can go in either direction.  The first part in either direction is quite level.  If you want more of a challenge, you can go walk to the left from the observation platform along the wall, and go as far as station 19.  The last part in this direction is quite steep and climbs far up the mountain.  In fact, the final staircase was so steep that I went up on all fours, as a slip or a fall would potentially have caused injury - so be careful if you go this far.  It was worthwhile, though.Our tour bus arrived just at opening time, and it was not crowded at all.  By the time we left about four hours later it was packed - so try to come early if you can.  If you come in April you will see the mountains covered in flowering shrubs of various types (yellow, white and pink flowers), which adds to the beauty."
199,Really impressive,Best place to go on the wall!! Get there early to hike up and avoid the small crowd. The views are amazing and it’s about 1.5 hours from Beijing!
200,Brilliant,Arrived about 930 am after drive from central Beijing.  Took ski lift up then walked along wall up and to the left to visit many posts before taking gondola down.  This was terrific as we didn’t have to turn around and both lift and gondola were at base of mountain near each other.  The walk and climb  were tiring but views were spectacular and thought provoking about the magnitude of this endeavor with no modern tools. There were few people here. Be sure to wear stable shoes due to uneven paving stones and steps.
201,No crowds in the afternoon!,"It is a great place, unfortunatelly we had a guide that lets us to visit alone, a pit as it could add more knowledge. the wall is long, so take 4 to 6 hours if you want to enjoy the place."
202,Adventure,The great wall was magnificent and a fantastic experience. It is less crowded than badaling great wall and the view was excellent. The final climb was near tower 20 was very steep but the view on top is worth all the effort. There is option for cable car to tower 14 and ski lift to tower 6. There is also tobaggan option down from great wall at tower 6 and can combine with the ski lift. Cost is about 120rmb for both direction ticket for both options and 100rmb one way.
203,Visit the Great Wall -  smart choices,Was very happy to see a wonder of the world and also walk on it just the experience of being there is great
204,Mutianyu Great Wall,The title says it all. You can’t fail to be impressed by the scale of the wall. This entrance is very commercialised (Subway etc.)I was lucky to do it mid week in January so not crowded or hot. Even using the cable car access needs a fair bit of effort.
205,Great Experience,"Just too many people to truly appreciate and enjoy, but you have to go. Also, as you walk the wall, it does get repetitive so you don't need that much time for the actual visit."
206,Good day out with great guide,"Very economical and fortunately not very crowded the day I visited.  You need to wear hiking boots, if possible.  There are plenty of places to stop and rest as needed.  I took the ski lift partially up, walked 94 floors up and down and then took the slide the remainder of the way down.  The slide is a BLAST and should be experienced by all.  Like most public places in China, bring toilet tissue with you."
207,Mind blowing!,We spend the day at Mutianyu. It was on a friday and suprisingly it wasn't crowded and could enjoy the walk along the wall. We took the option going up on the cable car and down with the slide. Is good fun on the way down. Views from this point are spectacular. Not many western people in this area and chinese people wanted to take pictures with us!
208,Best great wall for hiking & photography,"This is a bucket list item for sure. I got a lot of heat from locals since this was the ""touristy"" section of the wall, but hey, I'm a tourist. My only regret is that I didn't make my way over to the luge to slide down. I'd love to visit again if given the chance."
209,Bucket List Checked,Trip was very scenic on the way there. Cherries were in season so there were vendors on the street. Took the ski lift to the top of the wall. The experience and the views are unforgettable.
210,One of the best parts for first timers,"I had such a great time. It was quite a hassle getting there. Took about 2.5 hours to arrive via bus routes from Chaoyang district, but other transportation options are available with better timing. I advise doing research on how to get there once you decide you are going. (There is a bus for about 30¥ that leaves at 8:00 am from Dongzhimen Wai Bus Stop (东直门外公交车站) daily. I paid less than that for a round trip via other public buses but be mindful it will take much longer to reach your destination because of the stops.) I arrived there around noon and there were no lines. I purchased an eticket and I used the QR code on my phone to enter the Great Wall and to ride the shuttle buses (round trip) and cable car (round trip). The views were amazing and surprisingly, it wasn’t busy. I didn’t wait in any lines and I was there for a few hours. They also have a few restaurants, a hotel and souvenir shops that you can check out. It was such an amazing experience. Another item crossed off of my bucket list."
211,A must in China,"We took the chair lift up to the wall and the toboggan down. Though some steps were steep, we paced ourselves and where able to walk this section comfortable. The view was fantastic. At the base there is a range of food available, from Burger King through to more traditional cuisine,"
212,Worth the (slightly) extra distance,"There is a cable car system that takes you. A 46-60 minutes walk to the top, the last 5-10 mins is a bit steep. Recommend to wear hiking boots if you have them, but normal trainers are fine too. If you go in the winter season, bring extra layers for the wind."
213,Definitely worth a visit,"Without a doubt one of the most unforgettable experiences I got to share with my mother-- summiting The Great Wall. We traveled by Didi (China's version of Uber) and it took just over an hour from city centre. We visited in December, arriving at the wall in the afternoon to catch the sunset which was absolutely breathing. The wall was mostly deserted due to it being off peak season so we go some really awesome pictures and enjoyed the wall mostly to ourselves. Also in winter I would recommend going in the afternoon as the mornings can be bitterly cold. Also to note in winter the sun goes down much early just after 5pm and it's completely dark by about 5:30pm. We took  a return trip cable car up the wall 120 yuan and a shuttle to the start of the wall from the ticket office 10 yuan return trip highly recommend. We also purchased all our tickets online so we just had to scan our barcodes and enter very quick and easy. Have a warm coat, gloves, scarf and hat for December and most importantly have layered socks and good walking shoes else your feet will freeze. Truly a bucket list item-- not picture can do justice to being on the actual wall and taking it all in."
214,Toboggan is amazing!,"The journey involves a bus trip, a walk up a steep hill, a cable car and finally another steep hill. Take stout walking shoes, Plenty restaurants and gifty shops"
215,Out of this world,"A visit to the Great Wall was at the top of my wish list and it did not disappoint.  On my visit it was not overly crowded and I was able to enjoy so many vistas and appreciate the history and beauty of this iconic site.  Don't miss it.  It is a bit challenging to navigate if you have ambulatory issues, so be sure to plan accordingly."
216,Easy to overdo it,It's wonderful since there's options to get up via cable car. However it's not very accessible for any disabled person. Walking up to the cable car station is still possible using the elevator but coming down from the cable car station is a bit unfriendly for my disabled husband as he was not able to use the elevator to get down from the station to ground area. The elevator is only accessible from the entrance section. We tried to talk to the officer mending the cable car so he could allow us to use the elevator but was quickly chased out before we could request.
217,Absolutely worth the visit,"The architecture of this place is amazing! Even though the fall leaves were gone and the landscape was quite drab the wall holds it's own in awe. Knowing we were there in off season I can't say I'd want to be there during busy time! You are rarely alone. The hiking up and down the stairs are not for the faint at heart! We are quite active and those are some steep stairs! Take the time to hike to tower #1 so you can see the old non restored section. Also, unless there is no line dont bother with the toboggan. We had a super scared lady in front of us and I could have walked down faster."
218,Everything We Expected ,Spent a few hours on the Wall with my wife in September. Really nice walking up and down early in the morning before the hordes of other tourists come. Great pics...
219,The great wall is GREAT ,"The Mutianyu sectio is supposed to be less crowded than the other sections. Early in the  morning it was nice and quiet but around noon it was packed with people. After you buy your ticket a small bus takes you towards the mountain.There you hike up a steep road until the Cale Car station, or you can hike the total way up to the Wall. The Wall is even more spectacular than we expected. Go as early in the morning as you can!!"
220,Beautiful Autumn at Mutianyu Great Wall,"We took the cable car to get from the bottom till the tower 14, and from there we walked till the last one (number 20). It’s a very nice experience, a bit tiring but not impossible. I suggest you go as early as you can cause from 10:30/11 it starts getting really crowded and it’s more difficult to walk."
221,Great Wall with Tina,Excellent views of the wall! You definitely should arrive early to avoid the crowds. I highly recommend you take the chair lift up and the toboggan ride down.
222,It was a wonderful day.,"Stellar views and no wait for either the chairlift or toboggan down (which we highly recommend). A view of the snow covered mountains. It was around -5 Celsius, but it was manageable and we were very hot after the climb, so we even took our coats off. Highly recommend experiencing a climb during quieter months."
223,Highlight of China trip,"Breathtaking vistas from the ancient walls. As the saying goes, if you haven’t been up the Great Wall, you are no hero. What are you waiting for?"
224,Beautiful!,It is easy 1 h drive from Beijing. Not crowded and good visibility. Have cable car and other at reactions
225,Beautiful view,"Mutianyu is a great place to experience the fantastic Great Wall of China. The entrance is very close to the bus station and car park. There’s a supermarket and cafe here too. From there It’s a long and steep steeped walk up to the wall, but well worth it. There is a cable car and a chairlift as alternate modes of transport, also a toboggan for coming back down. There are a couple of refreshment stalls when you get up to the wall. The views even on a smoggy day were amazing, and when the sky did clear it became very chilly. Parts of the wall itself are also very steep, and there are forts to explore as you wander along enjoying the spectacle. It wasn’t too crowded on the day we went, and you can see why it’s the number one thing to do in China. An essential experience."
226,Great Wall views,Cold slippery but not crowded. Good food and fun shopping. Came with MU Bus tour via Klook. Smooth trip with waiting lounge.
227,Mutianyu sections ,"This area of the wall is situation sinuous mountains so makes a spectacular view. From the car park, you walk through a series of stalls, into the main reception area. It's recommended to take the cable car to get to the base. From there you can get into the wall, to the right a steadier walk awaits you or to the left's, a steady climb not for the faint hearted. But the views are outstanding. Shops with icecream, water, food and souvenirs are available, same with toilets.You need to be there really, really early or you will face 2 hrs wait at the cable car station."
228,Chair lift at Mutianyu Great Wall,"Amazing spot on the Wall ! We arrived around 2pm on a weekday and there was no crowd. There were some people of course but compared to Badaling it was very moderate. Very easy to walk there, great spots for photos ! Great for the sunset (in November, the sun sets at 17:02 so we could see very easily before taking the cableway, which btw ends at 17:30 so  you have more than enough time)."
229,A must see,"Cant rate this enough, another amazing place to tick of my bucket list. So well kept, very impressive site."
230,Great experience ,How do you describe the Great Wall and do it justice?  It is so OVER THE TOP amazing and special!!!  The craftsmanship and beauty are awesome!!!  Very beautiful vistas and every place you look could be a painting!  Couple of pointers: 1) wear very comfortable shoes and clothing! 2) bring a hat and warm coat.  It can be very windy and cold! 3) bring water! 4) the slide going down is worth the whole trip to China!!!
231,Tourism ,It is the best place to visit and fun thing to do.  Tina is an excellent guide that we had and flexible with the group.  We had three different type of activities to and from Great Wall and she accommodated to our please.  Tina you are the. Best!  Keep it up for good work!  See you again!
232,One of the best spots on the Great Wall,"You can save money by taking a bus, and then a shared taxi (if you want do it privately vs tour groups)."
233,Spectacular!,"In contrast to the more touristy Badaling, this section is harder to walk (more steep) and a bit further to get to. However it’s less crowded and doesn’t feel as touristy. You can get a good view of this section without having to fight with 20 other people to take a picture. We went during the winter so didn’t get to try the toboggan on our way down - surely would be an experience in the summer."
234,Once in a lifetime trip to the Great Wall,"You can't say much more than has been said for 600 years.  An amazing sight and experience.  However, it is not easy to get to if you have mobility problems."
235,Amazing! Expect to climb!,Try to go for the Tobaggan ride early as it gets crowded later in the day. There are quaint shops on the way up the ticketing station
236,Impressive,"Xiao Wei is a fluent English speaker who treats you as if you are a dear family member. He is a fantastic guide with a vast knowledge of Chinese history. My husband and I were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and Xiao Wei provided us with wine and took great pictures of us. We enjoyed learning about history and seeing amazing sites in China. If you are planning on exploring the Great Wall or exploring Beijing’s sites, I highly recommend Xiao Wei! Excellent service with a smile!"
237,The wall,Wow! It was surreal and our photos were amazing! Such an honor to have visited this site.I had dreamed of being there and still cannot believe I was there!
238,Great place must visit !,A must visit.  Had a lovely blue sky and snow which made it look stunning. Views from the wall are amazing.
239,Definitely a wonder of the world,"Hike to the wall or take the chairlift, both options are available.  But there is plenty of hiking along the wall for anyone.   There are two directions to choose from when you get to the top of the chairlift. The right side is steeper and the left side is not flat but easier.   The wall and guard stations are well reconstructed.  You can opt for a sled ride downhill for added fun"
240,WOW,"Fantastic place, great views. Mutianyu can be quite crowdy but still is sooooo impressive. Worth every RMB"
241,Great wakk is an experience not to be missed,we came last week(october( it was a 3 h woke it is ameizing  very large and beutefull the wether was very good litel rain the veiw is so ameizing you cant know till you arraive
242,Amazing bucket list visit,Great tour overall with good services. Booking to pick up process were hassle free. There was explanation about Great Wall history by our tour guide Michael as well!
243,A Cable Car Ride to the Wall,"Maggie again was our Tour Guide, she made us feel so at home and welcomed I can not say enough about her.  Her knowledge about everything was commendable.  The wall was breathtaking with fantastic views on every side  having the best tour guide added to our overall experience."
244,Not for the faint of heart,Great experience. Took a cable car up to the wall and then back down again. Pretty busy on the wall but great views. Not easy if you have problems walking/climbing steps.
245,Great wall Matianyu,Went to the great wall in winter time. Highly recommend. Smaller crowds and much better atmosphere to view. Really nice cable car ride up to the wall. Nice trinket shops and reasonable prices. Had a great time.
246,good place to view the Wall,The best time to go to the Great Wall is 2 o'clock. The most of the tourists are already gone and we had fortress sections partly completely to ourselves in this time. And definitely book the toboggan run - it´s so fun!
247,Incredible Views,"Wow what an amazing walk on the Great Wall of China, amazing view from each look out points along the wall, November weather was fantastic while we were there."
248,Great Wall ,We had a great day sightseeing and went to the Mutianyu Great Wall and Ming Tombs.  We had hired a driver and English Guide/Interpreter as you can only get here by travelling.  This did take up our entire day.  We happened to be here during the Chinese holiday and had no issues with it being overcrowded.  I would say it was perfect!  We took the cable car up and the toboggan down - don't worry - it's completely safe and worth it.  If anyone is interested in Gale - her email is iyy10000@126.com.    She was very informative of the Chinese history and kept everything interesting!  She also did a great job taking  pictures of us :)
249,Great Wall Beauty,"we were in Mutianyu on a cold, sunny day in December, just a day after snow had fallen. Fantastic day on the wall, quiet, and what a spectacular views on the mountains! Prepare for steep climbing, especially when you go up to Tower 20. Take the cable car up and down (to Tower 14) or go with chair lift up and toboggan down (to Tower 6, is lower). Absolutely great experience!"
250,Great Wall,We went to  Mutianyu part of wall. Took ski lift up and was in awe of its beauty shrouded in snow. Walked for around for 2 hours then caught toboggan down. Paid extra $120 Yuen for this but so worth it.
251,Prepare for cardio,"Very tourist friendly location to visit the great wall of China. Very well renovated and many options to buy souvenirs and drinks. If you chose to go right, it is one steep climb to the last renovated tower, but it will take a shorter time. If you start going to the left, your endurance will be tested with ups and downs and steps ranging from approx. 5-80cm.The views were stunning during autumn, with all the changing colors. If you are up for a climb, skip the cableway and hike up to the wall (approx. 1 hour).But don’t miss the Taboggan, a slide down from the wall that is fun for any age!!"
252,Don’t miss the Taboggan!,This section of the wall has beautiful views! There are lots of stairs and some are steep. Be careful on watchtower ladders as someone did fall while I was there. If visiting in winter use extra caution because of ice and snow on the walkway. The staff does clear a path to walk but it can still be slippery.
253,Nothing prepares you for this,"Been there on 16 Nov by using the paid round shuttle service from the town (cost only 5 euros per person), I started cable car from the beginning, the weather was windy and cold. The view was so stunning even thou cloudy."
254,The Tobaggan was definitely worth it. Early is better. Not so crowded,"Amazing amazing amazing. Please help me saying amazing. It was wonderful, there were not so many people and I could make some great pictures. Not an easy hike but if u fight a bit you can definitely make it 💯💯💯"
255,Little Disappointment...,This is one of the most wonderful sights I have ever seen a true masterpiece showing what human achievement. It is absolutely breathtaking to see. Words cannot describe this. Need to go back one more time with my son hopefully in summer to see the Great Wall with green vegetation. Went up and came down with the ski lift.
256,Mutianyu Great Wall,Meeting place in Beijing was a bit vague but all worked. Small party was nice. Guide told us intereting stuff then left us too it. We avoided the tobogganing and ski lift as i don't like heights!
257,A real world wonder,"Worth the visit. Not to cold in early November so a light jacket would do. Also the crowd is at a minimum. I heard during summer time you will be walking toe to toe, inch by inch with all the tourist. Take the difficult route for the view, easy route is more relaxed. We did both routes. There are many stalls selling souvenirs before the entrance. Make sure to buy yourself a nice traditional head gear. I got a Mao hat and my wife got a furry one. Make sure you bargain. My hat originally sells for 100rmb I got for 12rmb. My wife's original 220rmb I got for 50rmb. We received so much compliments with the hats. We took it home as souvenir. Enjoy!"
258,Beautiful.,Took a layover tour to Mutianyu Great Wall of China as we have layover of 8 hours. It was very cold and the tobagan and chair lift were closed.
259,Great Wall great place ,"Perfect weather and autumn colours added to this experience. It can be very steep so make sure you can make it back! Avoid the ""tea ceremony"" just a ploy to sell overpriced tea."
260,Be a part of history,great picture scene for there is less crowd and many scenery photo shoot opportunities without the crowd. always good to be in healthy physically to climb but slow walk is still possible but avoid the steep climb and the fort climb. with the help of cable car up the initial climb
261,Magnificent!,"It’s really great place to visit and discover , long history and something different, don’t forget to wear sport shoes or comfortable one"
262,Great place ,"It was great at the wall, we took the chairlift up and the toboggan down. Its best if you are there early morning at 8 so you can take great pictures without other ppl on it! Even though it was misty weather it was great and mystical!"
263,"Great City, Great Attraction- a must see","Advised by hotel staff and some local friends to avoid Badaling Great Wall. And totally agree, much lesser crowd so that u can take some really decent photos. 20 fortress points as compared to badaling’s 8. Definitely must visit when you are in Beijing China"
264,Great section of the wall for first time visitors/non-trekkers,"We visited the wall on 30th September in the afternoon and there were no crowds at all.  For some time we were the only one walking around.  We used the lift up and toboggan down and it was great! From the lift station you only walk down and after 8 sections you reach the toboggan station,  where they are less people. We had 2 hours and it was enough for walking that part, have some rest and take hundreds of pictures  ;)"
265,Mutianyu Great Wall,After a long busride finally arrived. Place is beautiful. But feel like we paid more than other passengers.
266,Mutianyu Great Wall: Its a Great Wall but not a Great Visit,Was amazed by the splendid view and the spirit of chinese people; parents with little children and old people climbing the stairs; simply wonderful
267,Go w MU Bus for a day trip to Mutianyu Great Wall.,"Loved this area of the wall. It was freezing and two women were shoveling snow on the wall. Be careful of slippery, uneven steps in the winter!"
268,Incredible place to visit,"Visited with a company tour, definitely worth the walk. Not much tourist compared to other part of great wall and great preservation considering it's more than 5000 years old."
269,Friendly guide- Michael,"Absolutely fabulous, must do!Took sky-lift to Watchtower No. 6, climbed from there to Watchtower No. 1 -- WOW, portions are extreme inclines with irregular treads to stone paver steps. MAGNIFICENT VIEWS!"
270,Well organised tour of the Great Wall,"Some well known landmarks are overrated and disappointing. The Great Wall of China is most definitiely not one of those. We stayed in Mutianyu and went upto the wall early on a cool but clear autumnal day with the backdrop of the trees turning colour. It was beautiful. For about the first 90 minutes we felt like we had the place pretty much to ourselves but from about 09:30 onwards the coachloads of daytrippers from Beijing start turning up and the tranquility disappears. Nevertheless, this is a must see site however and whenever you're able to do it.We walked upto the wall from the entrance which is a steep 20 minute walk but there are other options namely a gondola and a chairlift. Coming down you have the same options as well as a toboggan run which looks like fun but gets a bit congested.The wall itself has a lot of undulation and uneven surfaces so wear sensible shoes, take water and take it easy!"
271,"Amazing, but a challenge for those with limited mobility.","Went with tour agency KLook, excellent loop bilingual guide, Flower who managed large group with tact and humor. Bus took us up to restaurant meeting point, quite a steep hike even to cable car station. Short steep ride in closed car with 6 passengers after long queue but rewarded with marvellous view of winding path of mainly restored wall and watch towers. The elderly will have problems with large, steep, uneven steps that take you up and down the paths but young and robust will have no problem doing a few stretches in fine weather. Very crowded even on weekday and morning but rewarded with nice group lunch at Farmhouse restaurant with glass front serving local cuisine. Drop off at Olympic Stadium and Wangfujng but traffic jams hold you up. We had to get off before Wangfujing because of road accident and take the Mrt back."
272,Magnificent vista,Great trip to the oldest part of the great wall. They sell sugared apples near the entrance which are worth to try!
273,Great,An excellent facility with many types of access to the wall including the chairlift and a cable car. You can also toboggan down from the wall (although it was snowy when I went so this was not available)! This stretch of the wall is it extremely scenic and well preserved. The views are magnificent. Highly recommended.
274,Best experience in China,Great views from the tips and you will marvel at the constructions here at the top of the high hillsGreat place and an inspirational place
275,Absolutely amazing experience,This is one of the most famous site in the world and a must visit in one's lifetime. It take approx. half a day to visit and there are a few routes to choose from. Best to visit very early in the morning to beat the crowd and best not to choose a wet day as it can be slippery. A must do when in Beijing.
276,Spectacular place to see and experience the Great Wall,"Way up, you can take the cable car or climb by foot. Way down, you have another option to take the slider. Speed is much limited and limit is enforced (many controllers on the way down- 1.5 Kms). The wall- very impressive. Hard to believe how much effort was put to build that. Stroll in between the guarding towers and take your time. Could be physically demanding but allow enough time, so no rush.All is all, worth the travel time from Beijing' city center. Make sure to take photos in all directions- up and down, south and north."
277,great visit to majestic site,"Absolutely stunning place. as i had short time i used cable car. but hiking is highly recommended, buy your ticket online beforehand."
278,Good view,"Definitely recommend this nicely structured tour by Michael who was also very helpful in providing assistance on anything you needed along the way, even during lunch he help us to order and find our way. Went for the early trip with departure 7:30 am and it ended up being a great choice since The Wall became more crowded towards the afternoon."
279,Wow,You should use the cable car for going up of the hill not chair cable car. And you can use slider for coming back. Slide should be used as per people in front of you. Avoid old people or slow people when you will use the slider. Otherwise you can't run faster.
280,A great walk on the Great Wall ,"Great scenery, impressive. Please skip the coffee corner at the top and buy your coffee in the valley.The coffee there is around €6 and they wanted to let us pay €89 for 2 medals. A rip-off. After walking away they charged only CNY 100. Which is around €13. Still way too expensive but ok for us."
281,Great Wall,The place requires you to take shuttle to later explore the great wall. Easy to find place to eat and some little souvenirs.
282,Convenient and Cost Effective,"When you're on the wall, you think thaht it was made on kilometers and kilometers, you're very impressed."
283,Excellent day,"Local guide Jonny Zhang excellent, see his contact on Facebook. He will put together a personal itinerary for you."
284,Highly recommended!!,"Its more than an hours drive to reach mutianyu great wall section ,this section is best for many reason ,its less crowded have cable or chair car to reach on top and its picturesque. This section is newly renovated. After walking a bit from the bus parking you reach the base from where you get the cable car which is worth as you need to keep your stamina for the walking part on the wall. It was a chilly morning , so was quite hazy and less crowded so you get many photo ops , once u be there you get that feeling and all the stories regarding the wall (all the good and the bad ones)If you happen to be in Beijing you need to come here ."
285,Mutianyu Great Wall Tour,This site was preserved as a UNESCO heritage site and one of the wonders of the world. Defintely a must-see.  You will see breathtaking views of the great wall and the mountains.  It is not for the faint of heart if you go further hiking since the steps are man made and have irregular steps but try as much as you can. Everey angle of the place is picturesque and lovely. Very nice to explore and see.
286,Mutianyu great wall morning tour,"Well restored section without crowds. Can be reached by walking, cable car and you can go down by cobble car"
287,Nice sunday stroll on the wall with the help of Michael!,"Truly one of the greatest wonders of the world. I was amazed by not only the great view, but also how this was built by human being."
288,THE GRRRREAT WALL,Very enjoyable great views can be very windy but worth it. There can be a lot of people at Certain times but all and all great day .
289,Lots of steps,Magnificent structure build over thousand years. Beautiful place to visit. View from Tower 20 is awesome.
290,Awesome,"We visited the wall in summer and it was awesome , this time in winter and it was also awesome as the landscape was covered in snow and snow was on the wall. Great photo opportunities. Also no crowds so even better!"
291,Lovely area of the wall.,There are alot of transportation to go to thr great wall. The area is clean anda all facilities are working well. There are restaurants and shopping centre. The great wall are maintained well
292,A must do,This place is preserved by UNESCO. It is one of the rarest treasures of the world. If is a must see.
293,Need to be fairly fit,We took taxi from hotel near airport and it was about 1.5 hours. Snow in the ground but sunny. Only a few shops are opened. Love the cable rides since there were very few people visiting. You will need mittens and warm jackets. Love it!
294,Great Wall of China Mutianyu 慕田峪,"We came prepared, packed up a couple of croissant sandwiches with meatloaf that we quickly put together from our breakfast buffet,  wrapped nicely in napkins and placed in ziploc. Prepare to layer up and down.  This saved us during the hike and packed couple of bottled water.  Hired a private chauffeur that drove us from our Beijing hotel to the Mutyanyu entrance. Picked us up at 7am and it was a 2 hour drive.  We had the car all day. Hiked at our own pace. Driver waited at the parking structure.  We bought four tickets per person at the ticket office. There are a ton of stores before the shuttle pick up. I strongly suggest to buy walking sticks. But try to bargain down to 5 USD equivalent per stick.Tickets to buy:A. Shuttle that will take you to entrance of the wallB. Entrance tickets to the parkC. Cable car tix from entrance tower 14D. Return chair lift which can also be used as tobbagen tix from tower 6.As we reached tower 14 by cable, we made a left to go all the way to 23. It was not an easy hike but sticks helped a lot.this was a 2-3 mile incline more or less then going down to tower 6 is another 3. We stopped to eat our croissants at tower 16.Breathtaking views. Definitely the best part of our Beijing trip.  Cant miss this.  Go early to beat crowd. Chauffeur was waiting for us at end of day.Exhilarating experience!"
295,Breathtaking and Gorgeous views,"Totally breathtaking and amazing view. I choose Mutianyu side of the wall because of view and I heard it is less crowded. Definitely, it was less crowded and had a peaceful trek. During my visit in November, it was very cold and temperature was close to 1c during the day."
296,Amazing experience.,"From last 4 years was travelling to South China, never got an opportunity to visit this wonder of the world.Though it was - 5 temperature I like this place covered with Snow. Need lot of energy to roam around the Great Wall."
297,"Breathtaking, once in a lifetime experience","Nice views, easy to get to.  Worth the visit.  On a clear day you can see far and wide, all the different slopes and sections that scatter the countryside."
298,Less crowded and less commercialized,"In 1368 AD, Mutianyu Great Wall was built by Xu Da who is the main general for Zhuyuanzhang in the Great Wall ruins of Northern Qi Dynasty. Surrounded by the mountains, the Greening rate of the Great Wall reaches 98%, and its scenery is beautiful. Known for its gorgeous scenery, Mutianyu is one of the essences in the Great Wall of Ming Dynasty. Mutianyuhas the characteristics of the fresh air, sided embrasure, peculiar guards, intensive watchtowers, the strong feeling of three-dimensional and the existing of the inside and outside branch. Much more can be added to it but I feel that one has to experience at his/her own."
299,very  impresiv  amizing,"很好的导游，通晓中英文。很有耐心的解释，带队也很有秩序。 建议找他做领队/导游说👍Very good tour guide, good in both mandarin and English.He will explain in details and bring the group nicely.Recommend to look him for tour guide."
