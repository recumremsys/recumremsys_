0,Quiet Visit to Winter Gardens,Was surprised that the Winter Gardens were open when I visited to see the CRUCIBLE. So went in after asking the staff member on duty if it was OK. Spent about 30 minutes  inside looking at the various displays of palms and exotic trees. Surprised how tall they were. Unfortunately the eateries and cafes were all shut. Took a few photos  while there.
1,Break away,The winter garden is quite small but pleasant. The surprise was how good the art museum in it. We easily spent an hour looking at some art with explanations of what they depicted and the history of Sheffield steel. I was in ad wheelchair and everything was accessible  and easy to manoeuvre  around.
2,Mindfulness Journey,"A lovely atmosphere to sit and chill. Spent abit of time on here after visiting the museum as the back entrance leads to it. Nice palm tres and plants. Very peaceful, near to bars and coffee shops."
3,Nice building,"We were walking through Sheffield and had been told of the Winter Gardens. We found the Peace Gardens amongst some fabulous old stone buildings. The Winter Gardens was hidden down a side street behind a very modern glass facade. Inside we found paved paths through flower beds planted with tropical plants, trees and models of animals. It isn't large but it is covered and so on a wet cold day it offered some respite from the weather."
4,a must see !!!,"Went to the winter garden with my grandsons during the school holidays and we enjoyed our visit, the garden itself is fabulous and one of my grandchildren couldn't believe the plants were real, they had to touch them to see, the colours and care taken to look after them is great, we visited the museum and we loved the artist showroom with the different effects on the floor, good food and drink available, good place to sit and read, and warm. What's not to like"
5,Peaceful,Came across the winter garden on a recent visit.Worth a look around the tropical plants and the free museum.Enjoyed it very much.
6,Amazing,Walked through on our way back to the hotel. The structure of this buildings is very interesting and the plants inside are lovely. Some of the shops/cafes around the edge looked a little ‘sad’ but I was interested in the plants and not the shopping. A very nice thing to have in the centre of a city
7,"Nice, cozy and entertaining.","At first I thought it was a simple greenhouse garden, and not very pretty, but turn out there are exhibitions and coffee shop. I think it’s a really nice place for taking photos, to chill and relax."
8,Lovely spot for coffee,The Winter Garden is small but nice to walk round. Nice places to sit and relax. We came into look at the Lego. Nice that Winter Garden was a part of that. We would visit again when in Sheffield.
9,Marvellous ,"I took a walk while waiting to go into a local restaurant. It’s nice, peaceful when I was there. Worth the minor de-tour if you’re nearby."
10,Nice,"Came here and viewed the modern art exhibition, and it was really great. The other long standing exhibitions were also good, especially the one about the steel works."
11,Small but worth a visit,Myself and my husband stay at the mecure every year and as its attached to the winter gardens we always go into the gardens to have a drink and snack in the beautiful surroundings
12,Peaceful setting,"Went in to look around and have coffee, looking around was fine, fabric flowers a bit odd but didn’t stay as no seating for coffee."
13,Worth a visit,"I visit this place regularly, if I'm passing through or going to the connected Millennium Galleries..a green space in the city centre lovely to sit and read or visit the exhibitions."
14,Nice place to sit for lunch.,"Came to Sheffield specifically to find and visit this place. I knew where it was rougly located, but it still took a while to find it. Did not see a single signpost for it, or anything else either, for that matter. Nice, bright, clean and airy inside. Several exhibitions on at the moment and expressions of Sheffield life, past and present.It is small, but it's well maintained and clean throughout.I enjoyed my little visit.See photos."
15,Unexpected art,"I have been in The Winter Gardens many times since its construction, to look at the wonderful botanical specimens, to rest awhile on one of the benches, to look at something being exhibited there, or perhaps to see an occasional performance, to purchase lunch, to meet someone or merely to use it as access from one place to another.However this was the first time that I have stayed there to have an afternoon meal with others. Although the number of tables and chairs is limited, there was sufficient space for all and the exotic flora provided a pleasant atmosphere for dining and convivial chat.There was a fair selection to choose from on the menu which was reasonably priced. It certainly made a very suitable venue for the afternoon.There are a couple of other shops selling mainly souvenir stationery and other mementos, and should these not suffice there is further available in the adjoining Millennium Galleries.The Winter Gardens are cool and well ventilated, but also have underfloor heating. There are steps at one entrance but also a relatively gentle access ramp. The opposite end opens out onto a flat pedestrian precinct for easy access.Although it can be a busy place at times, there is always a sense of space and openness, perhaps a few more plants might not go amiss. The plants are generally labelled but one or two occasionally lack such. The general information boards though cannot be faulted.However The Winter Gardens is a well designed, wonderfully constructed, Ideally sited gem that combines natural beauty with architectural skill. A place for a single visit, or more likely one to return to time and again."
16,Winter garden,We came to see the photo exhibition that is on at the moment and were very impressed by the Winter Garden.Great place to stop off and eat your lunch on a cold November day.
17,Lovely quiet place in the centre of the city,"Nipped in before going to the theatre. What a beautiful and calm space, so important in busy cities. Plenty of seating to enjoy the atmosphere and great things for children to look at. A real sense of Sheffield pride is evident."
18,Take a break from shopping ,"I literally stumbled upon this haven on leaving the Millennium Gallery. It was lunch time-ish, so I decided to grab a bite and sit at one of the cafe's tables. It was what I needed - to rest after standing. However, I wish that the fare at the cafe was more refined than transport 'caff' sandwiches with thick bread. Nevertheless, it was better than nothing."
19,Worth a visit ,"We were on a visit to Sheffield for the Lego event and went through the gardens, which are lovely, amazing plants and a very relaxing place with places you can buy coffee and linger a while."
20,"It’s ok, nuce",Fascinating museum in 4-5 rooms. The one covering cutlery in Sheffield was so informative and it is all free. Plants good to see too.
21,Flying visit,We went there to show the grandchildren what Christmas lights were like and they were definitely not dissapointed as it was lit up beautiful..
22,Small covered collection,"Palm trees in the middle of Sheffield, well in the winter gardens really.  Also found a museums and displays in the area."
23,A real asset for Sheffield,The sat nav took us to a florists along the street but once we found the gardens we were quite impressed! Indoor gardens under arches were worth a quick look and we liked the talking bench. The millennium gallery was the highlight. Well done.
24,Fantastic shopping centre,"Happened to fall across this place on following goggle maps to a place we were going to eat and it was a lovely indoor garden place with shops,cafes, etc, seating to sit and eat your lunch, would be a great place to come relax and eat your lunch here if you worked near by."
25,Pleasant area,Didn’t even know this existed until my recent visit. Beaut location even in the dark Lots of bars and restaurants around the area to enjoy the views Clean and tidy inside like stepping into the tropics. Lots of lovely plants and tress like going into a jungle
26,Relaxing oasis,The place is small i wouldn’t travel here just to come to winter gardens but its lovely to walk round when coming to the city centre has a few little shops and a cafe
27,Nature in the middle of the city centre,"I was quite surprised to find this as I hadn't known about it. I had a glance around the interpretation boards (of which there probably should have been more), and then sat and read for a bit as the sun set, which made it quite atmospheric. (The fans were quite noisy though.)"
28,Smaller than I imagined,Lovely little place. You go in and where the crucible theatre is and come out where the restaurants are. Ideal place to simple wined down and have a cuppa or read a book. Doesn't cost anything to enter.
29,Slightly disappointing,We visited and really enjoyed seeing all the plants and the little stalls inside are nice to visit too. A good place to pop into if the weather turns too!
30,Charming! ,"We were impressed by these gardens.  In a lovely building, very peaceful and interesting plants.  Lovely cafe at one end.  An excellent attraction for the city."
31,Interesting place,We came during the day so didn't get the special effects of the lighting. Nice enough to look around and get out of the cold. Lots of little displays set up. Nicely done but not the sort of place you would make a special trip to.
32,Well worth a visit,"We came upon this by accident when looking for the art gallery and museum (which are across the road ).  Wonderful tropical plants and a nice calming atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the  nearby shops.  Includes an adjacent gallery of its own and of course the ubiquitous gift shop, but a nice spot to while away a few minutes, or even hours."
33,Excellent place to roam in the middle of the city of Sheffield,"I was quite impressed by the winter gardens.  Inside gardens with exotic plants. Seating all around. There is a café, gift shop and small individual art galleries inside. All free of charge."
34,Nice place to visit,"Great to walk through here. There was some art exhibitions on when went, which were very interesting. All free too!There are also some nice stalls selling gifts, which are worth a look. Plus, some little actual shops too"
35,Interesting,"We wandered through here during the Bricktropolis event.  Nice place to relax, with plan, big trees and cafes.  Would be a good area to sit in if it is raining.  Nearby Millenium galleries just off too.  We were also able to find a virtual geocache, themed around the elephant"
36,Relaxing walkabout,"Popped in to the gardens for a quiet 5 minutes whilst the Christmas ma4ket was on all around it. A lovely calm  space with access to little shops, cafes and a gallery. Lovely!"
37,Winter garden ,Visited last week with some friends. Was really surprised to find this in the middle of town. A very nice setting.
38,Good place for a wander,"We visited the gardens as they were next to our hotel and a restaurant we booked overlooked the gardens, which were beautiful. We chatted over lunch and decided to visit on our way to see the snooker at the Crucible opposite, when we saw a few snooker stars walking past and realised that this was the place the snooker stars were interviewed on the tv. We went in and saw cafe's and places to sit and lots of beautiful plants. It was busy but serene and a calming place. We had a walk round before watching the televised snooker interviews and star spotting, Tho this place is beautiful without the snooker hype. Looking forward to going again on our next visit to Sheffield."
39,Lovely place to sit,"When we got married we originally wanted to have our pictures taken in the peace gardens but the Sheffield by the seaside event was on at the time, so we went in to the winter gardens and it is lovely inside, we got some beautiful photos.We've also been inside when it has different activities on in the school holidays.It has nice little coffee shop too."
40,'Warm Winter Gardens',"I've visited Sheffield's Winter Garden's before, but only when they've been being used used by the BBC for Snooker coverage, so it was nice to finally visit and see them in their entirety. Nice relaxing spot to enjoy the beauty of the plants and trees, away from the rain Up North!!!Well thought out.Lots of benches, places to eat and drink.Truely a highlight of any trip to Sheffield!"
41,Four mph art,"Loved it! Lots of NZ native plants, made me smile as i was visiting from my new home ( NZ) . Really peaceful, loved the small galleries etc in there too.Well done sheffield!"
42,Delightful little place.,"I watched the Winter Gardens being built almost 20 years ago (does anyone remember the Egg Box?). It's such a familiar building I'd almost stopped seeing it. Found myself waiting here yesterday evening and it really struck me what an amazing piece of architecture this is. There's a church-like feeling with that tall, vaulted ceiling and the way sound travels within the space. Somewhere peaceful to stop, pause and take a moment just for yourself right in the busy city centre of Sheffield."
43,Lovely place,"I was exploring this area of downtown on my own one afternoon in September.  There was a brisk wind and the temp was 63' that day. Coming from Florida, it felt very chilly and I appreciated the jacket I brought with me. The Winter Garden was a wonderful place to seek a reprieve and rest on a bench.  I enjoyed the mobile adjacent to my bench.  The greenery provided a restful pick me up.  I encountered a fat pigeon with a right foot amputation.  I marveled at nature's adaptation with the callous formation on his stump and how well he navigated with just a slight limp.  It didn't seem to slow him down at all. I imagined from his girth that lots of visitors gave him tasty morsels. I met a shopkeeper of a kiosk walk-in booth that was utterly charming. She introduced me to her elderly dad and we talked politics amicably for a good quarter hour.  The educational displays in the adjoining rooms were interesting.  Best part--it's FREE!"
44,Amazing,We walked round the Winter garden last weekend.  There are a lot of plants in the there from all different countries.  Worth a walk round if your in the area.
45,Paradise in the city,"Passed through here on an overnight stay in the city, nice to have such a natural structure with wood and glass letting in the light from the outdoors with so much greenery in the heart of the city."
46,Lovely place and good for family ,I have been a few times now to Winter Gardens usually after eating at one of the nearby restaurants every time I have been it’s always been a relaxing occasion.
47,Oasis of peace,A lovely place to visit when In the city that weather can’t spoil. Always go there when I can and this time took my partner
48,Very festive,"A wander through the Winter garden to the theatre. Time to stop and gaze on the lovely, colourful flowers and bamboo.See something different every time!"
49,Lovely green space ,"The winter garden is housed in a lovely modern glass building. It’s not massive but it’s clear see a lot of effort has gone into the design. The building a lot houses a nice modern gallery, cafe, toilets and shop. Big plus, the garden and galleries are free. Walking out one side takes you the side of the town hall, a lovely area of fountains and water displays which was very popular with families and people just enjoying the afternoon sun. Plenty of restaurants surrounding the area."
50,An oasis in the City Centre,A favourite place in Sheffield. Just a lovely space - always try to walk through it when in Sheffield. Sometimes has exhibitions and activities.
51,Christmas,Found a pop up shop with gorgeous items to buy for cmas presents. Took some lovely photos and had a great coffee
52,Lovely for families,We visited the Winter Gardens last week with our granddaughter as it was part of the Lego event which was being held around the town. It is a glass domed well kept garden in the centre of Sheffield. There are lots of different shrubs and plants which are all named. There are bench seats and there is also a cafe as well.
53,Sidney Opera House,"I popped in to escape the cold outside while waiting for someone. I live in the Caribbean, and was so happy to experience a bit of home. The orchids and bromeliads brought me so much joy!"
54,Why not?,Lovely plants and layout in a small space right in the heart of Sheffield. We went as the half marathon finished - lively.
55,Peaceful and welcoming,"Whenever you are in Sheffield you must visit The Winter Garden,a fabulous place with so much to see,I’m sure the place will amaze you!"
56,Bit of a surprise really.,Me and my partner stay at the adjoining Mercure and always have a walk through its nice and peaceful and loved the fact that one of the elepgsnts remained
57,Evening in Winter Garden,"Our group walked through the winter gardens sbout 10.30 on a nippy Monday morning. There were several groups of young school children, very excited at their adventure. The planting is fabulous, giving a real sense of the exotic in this northern university city. It feels like a welcoming friendly place. Nice atmosphere and spacious enough for gatherings. We took several photos here and I understand many people come especially to see the elephant signed by........??? Look it up! It’s a real tourist attraction in its own right."
58,Warm!,Lunch in the gallery cafe after a stroll around the exotic plants of the warm gardens. The architect is wonderful and it is a great place to relax and chat. The Leonardo de Vinci exhibition is a must see and was unsurprisingly busy. Your patience will be rewarded when you see these amazing masterpieces by this renaissance genius. Park at Q Park Charles Street and get a 50% discount from the gallery reception 😉
59,Sheffield Winter Garden,"We visited on the 6th April even though it was a Saturday and the city centre was busy we were able to sit down and take a breath, we only stayed for a coffee but we are going back this weekend to stay longer. A lovely oasis on a busy day."
60,Oasis of calm,Been a few times the gardens are brilliant all year round. It is becoming the place for wedding photography. Inside here are a few shops and access to the museum. Currently the shops are Sheffield makers which sells hand made goods made here in Sheffield cards badges prints magnets and other goods. There is a cafe next to with a seating area under the branches of the trees  and views across the square to the crucible. The gardens are used when the bbc arrive late March early April for the snooker with the presenters doing analysis from the gardens. The gardens are also used as a  starting point for a city centre walking tour.  Just one thing to note the gardens does not have parking of its own. On street disabled parking is just outside but do not use any of the nearby loading bays even with your blue badge you will get a ticket.
61,First visit,"Beautiful building with some interesting plants, attached to attractive exhibition space. We whiled away an hour or so in the steel and photography exhibitions and wish our home town offered something similar."
62,Winter gardens ,"A lovely spot in the middle of the city, trees and benches, completely free to use. It's well used by locals who stop off to eat their sandwiches or just to sit. There's a little cafe, and a smarter one downstairs, also pop-up shops and exhibitions happening all the time."
63,Very pleasant and refreshing amenity,Restful area to walk through. We. Had a fantastic serenade from a young Opera company advertising a forth coming event.
64,Enjoy the warmth of this tropical garden,Lovely exotic planting. Pleasant place to sit and people watch. Went on a Sunday so not overly busy. Good organic cafe was open with excellent food  and a nice craft pop up shop. A great modern high vaulted glasshouse. What a good idea in the he heart of a city. Clean and well maintained. A little warm but on a very hot summer’s day.
65,Modern art ,"This was a lovely place to visit briefly, if somewhat smaller than expected. It seems to be well kept and with plenty of seating is quite a relaxing place. The museum and exhibition area attached to it is also very interesting."
66,loved it,"After perusing the book ""111Thngs Not to Miss in Sheffield"" or something like that, we listed the Winter Garden as a place to see.  During our four days of walking around Sheffield and taking in the sites - like movie locations for The Full Monty and the Leopold Hotel where Joe Cocker was a student when the hotel was a technical school - we stumbled on the Winter Garden by accident to get in out of the rain.  We could have spent hours here, siping hot chocolate and coffee and reading a good book."
67,A HAVEN IN WHICH TO RELAX,"The Winter Garden is a lovely oasis in the city, we walked in and out a few times over our few days there. Especially entertaining when the Snooker World Championship is on and you can try for a game of snooker! Also a lovely entryway to the museum."
68,"A green glazed oasis, must visit","Plenty to look at, all the questions asked by the kids can be answered by reading the numbered sheets placed near the items, we’ve been several times and all of us have enjoyed it, usually prior to a meal at one of the local restaurants"
69,Nice sight,We wandered through the Winter Garden and enjoyed the interesting plants. I imagine this would be an especially nice spot on a cold or dreary day.
70,Beautiful ,"Nicely laid out, seating, cafe museum and pop up shops. Interesting planting.  With a short visit if a stranger to the city."
71,Something different,Stayed in mecure hotel next door what a lovely place even sitting having breakfast was a joy to see people walking through we loved the flowers and different plants a joy to go into the little gallery’s off stainless steel John Ruskin Chatsworth house arts we thoroughly enjoyed our visit somewhere lovely to go for a break from shopping and plenty of seats to sit on and admire the gardens
72,Beautiful haven of tranquility,Huge glass house in the middle of Sheffield. Amazing construction and most impressive.Many entrances off the streets or via the Millennium galleries.Lots of beautiful tall and exotic plants and some lovely dainty flowers.Plenty of interest for children to explore and for older people seats to take in the surroundings. Cafe and restaurant on site but didn’t partake.
73,Nice,"Every time I go back to Sheffy, I visit this place. You can find many different species of plants and trees , the temperature inside is a bit humid to allow the plants to grow, there are also some decorations around, some stores to visit and to buy a souvenir. There are some paths between the trees and the plant and where you can walk through and some small lakes. All the species have a label so it’s also a moment to know new plants. I like a lot this place, it’s very quiet. Some benches are placed in the gardens so you can also sit and have some relax."
74,"Really interesting, calming space in a busy City","Although the winter gardens are interesting and host lots of tropical plans it’s realky not the place for teens. It’s a giant glasshouse with a few coffe shops sandwich bags and art shops , it’s a great place to take lunch , but please don’t take your teens they will moan your their heads off ."
75,What a delight,Really enjoyed the place. It’s literally outside my hotel and very easy to link thru the block and lead to the art gallery. The plant inside are nice and is a lovely please to gather and hang out as it warm in the winter and provide spaces for kid to run about. And you get to learn stuff out of it too. The roof is nice and created a landmark as well. It’s a free and great place to visit in Sheffield!
76,Lovely atmosphere ,I love a wonder through the winter gardens - especially when the snooker is on as you can guarantee you will see them filming the BBC coverage. Nice place to sit and take it all in - cafes and the museum next to it so plenty to see
77,Respite from Stroll,"Visiting Sheffield for the day, I wandered through with friends and found the gardens to be peaceful and a total escape from the surrounding city. A really nice feature, and a place to stop and slow down. I wish my home city, Leicester, had something similar."
78,Outside inside,"On Saturday night we walked through the Winter Garden to go to the lyceum. We were with some of our family, not from Sheffield, and they said how lovely it was. Our grandson staed with us for a couple of days after some shopping we had a picnic in the Winter Garden. Brilliant- a great asset for everyone."
79,Amazing,We visited a lunch time and it was obviously a haven for locals looking for a quiet spot to eat. Loved the physical structure but felt that the planting was a bit tired in places.
80,If you go to Sheffield - don't miss this Garden - we almost did,"Within a few minutes of walking from the train station we came upon the Winter Garden, perfect for a coffee and a sit down while we got our bearings.  Free entry to the Winter Garden is lovely, I expect it's very cosy on a cold day too.  We sat at the window and watched the world go by for a few minutes then wandered through the garden then back again to the Sheffield shop for a few purchases."
81,Peaceful,The winter gardens are great full relaxing and having a bit of dinner. Perfect location next to St. Paul’s.
82,good for a wonder,We often come here but a visit with our granddaughter at Christmas was magical. She loved the fairy theme and we spent a long time looking at the different fairy houses and creatures.
83,Interesting plants ,Ok when we went it was very quiet but peaceful and lovely palms and flowers to to admire. Nice little coffee shop selling snacks and drinks.
84,A tranquil relaxing space in central Sheffield,I saw the place in winter with a dull cold and grey weather but seeing some kind of tropical forest inside this building brings you already in a hot country
85,Lots to see,"Whilst in Sheffield a few months ago we decided to take a trek through the markets and the surrounding area and we came across this absolutely wonderful oasis of calm and greenery which we didn't even know existed.  A series of arches which bring to mind the Sydney Opera House containing effectively one giant urban greenhouse where all types of exotic plants and species of shrubbery and flowers are on display and allowed to flourish. The place is so perfect even songbirds were nestling in the branches above us, chirping away happily. There was even space for a series of temporary art exhibitions for the creative minded to admire. The closet to a city centre paradise there is.... (Backwood Birmingham Council please take note - you even took away our beloved Floozie in the Jacuzzi fountain in Victoria Square by the council house because of austerity cuts but chose to waste it on stupid bus lanes, fancy railings and the rest).Such a beautiful place where you could sit for a while, chill out and admire the lofty plants and take in the scenery. This place certainly helps cement the claim that Sheffield is one of the greenest cities in the UK - an aspiration to which our own city of Birmingham - for all its horrible inhuman sprawl and bland mediocre architecture - could do well to at least try and emulate."
86,Great garden area with an excellent museum,Nice area for a chill out. Visited at lunchtime and it was obvious that it was used by people as a lunchtime break area. Nice
87,Indoor Garden Space,"Brilliant architecture ,tropical plants and access to the art gallery. Clean space, will regular see cleaner around ect."
88,Free and worth a look for sure ,The Winter Garden looks as if it used to be an empty gap between two buildings. If this is so it’s an excellent use of space. To roof it and fill it with plants. I was very impressed. Lovely space to sit and chill.
89,lovely space,Lovely place to go kids enjoyed it.Had some activity’s on for the kids provided by local uni students I think?Well worth a visit 👍👍
90,Ok.,"Nice sight in Sheffield, located really close to the train station. It has access to Millenium Gallery and gift shops"
91,Lovely oasis,"Discovered this place whilst browsing on Google,a lovely place to visit,peaceful and relaxing,some lovely exhibitions to look at as well,recommended"
92,An interesting structure,"We were tourists and from the write up it sounded as though this was a huge greenhouse. To be fair you would walk through it in a few minutes, but it's worth a diversion as it's very close to the centre of the city. Beautiful palms and ferns with some orchids and cacti. A calm place to sit and eat your sandwiches which is what the locals seemed to be doing."
93,Great indoor garden,That was my first impressionWonderful building beautiful woodThe plants were really something and exhibitions really worth a look
94,Lovely area in the middle of Sheffield.,"Came across this whilst walking through the city, lovely little free tropical garden under a roof. Well worth a visit or just a walk through. Very impressive."
95,a very pleasant place,"I have traversed this route many times on my route into Sheffield centre from the train station, and it has never entered my head to think about what others may think!  This public area provides for a free area to sit and relax in the centre of Sheffield, with numerous stalls to buy local produce:  It also provides for a beautiful indoor experience from time to time, including operatic pop ups and more; give it a go !!!"
96,Hot house,"We were expecting maybe a bigger area but, having arrived there, we were impressed with what we saw. It has a nice ambiance and it's free. For lunch check out Mama's and Leonie's around the corner."
97,Very nice,A lovely place to visit alongside the millenium gallery. Highly recommend popping down through the gallery to Ambulo cafe...amazing food there!
98,Excellent Tropical Winter Gardens in the heart of Sheffield,"While in the area we called in and did the tour, very clean and impressive. Well maintained and definitely worth a look if you're in the area.Unfortunately didn't have time to see it all but if we should return to the area we'll call back in for sure."
99,Memorable Place,"Pretty garden in a huge glass house. I can see the appeal of the Winter Garden on a wet, miserable day. Not worth seeing if the weather is lovely, go to the real thing...botanical garden! The art gallery inside the glass house is worth viewing if you have time."
100,Nice place to relax,"Staying at the adjacent Mercure it made sense to take in the winter gardens. Open, light and airy this is an attractive public space, enclosed from the elements. It contains some stunning species and attractive artworks. There is seating and a small café. Wish I'd had longer and a little more sun."
101,Nice place,"This little oasis in the middle of the town, is full of tropical plants, art and small outlets. Plenty of seats to sit and have a sandwich or just watch the world go by. The flower beds were beautiful and full of colour with art incorporated in them. After walking around the town, what seemed like hours, it was a great find, as we knew nothing about it and a welcome place to rest and get our breath back!"
102,Lovely ,Always a great nice walk through the garden on the way to work. Very peaceful. Full of nice little cafes and gift shops.
103,Rainy day welcome distraction ,"We often visit here to see any new exhibitions and chill out as it is very calm and peaceful. The facilities are good, there is a nice cafe and it really is somewhere you can escape the bad weather in winter. Every city should have a building like this.Wander through there are more bars and cafes out of the rear entrance."
104,A peaceful spot,We enjoyed visiting this lovely wee garden in the city centre.  There are sweet little shops and a cafe as well as Lego sculptures and animal art to look at.  Relatively small but a nice place for a quick wander to look at the plants.
105,Lovely little garden,"Went in here for a coffee. There’s a nice independent coffee place in there. It’s a stunning building and the plants are spectacular, creating a peaceful little oasis in the city centre. There’s access to the museum (worth a visit) and there’s a great independent shop next to the coffee place selling locally made products. A lovely glasshouse in the heart of the city. If you’re in Sheffield it’s worth popping in."
106,Good for a wet day,It’s a nice and well mantained indoor garden. They should organise some event or entertainment more often though. The gallery with the shop is not the best. Too expensive to buy little things!
107,An oasis of calm,"A nicely laid out and well kept attraction. It offers the opportunity to visit some nice exhibitions. We were quite taken with the cutlery exhibits. A nice insight into Sheffield’s industry. Go, you’all not be disappointed"
108,Impressive!,We travel by train to sheffield regularly and always go via the winter gardens to the city centre.Apart from being a beautiful structure there is alwayssomething of interest going on.  It is well worth a visit for this reason alone
109,"Tropical plants and divers exhibitons, all free.  A relax","My cousin loves to play in the winter gardens, it’s a great place to go for a play and drink nice Coffe."
110,Lovely space,We ran in here to escape the rain and what a surprise. A little tropical paradise in the middle of Sheffield.
111,pleasant hour,"The Winter Gardens are situated right in the middle of Sheffield City Centre, so you would need to park in one of the City's Car Parks if you don't want to walk very far.  This building is predominantly made of composite, arched, wooden spars and rafters and of course glass!  It does get quite warm inside, even in the middle of Winter it is very warm; so much so they have tropical trees and plants growing inside.  The building is approimately 100 metres long and 20 metres wide, and has paths and walkways winding through it from one end tyo the other.  It is very wheelchair friendly as it's very flat inside, and the best thing is it's free entry!  When the World Snooker is on at the Crucible Theatre, they also have an exhibition snooker table inside the Winter Gardens, so it does get quite busy at that time.  if you are in Sheffield at any time, it is worth a look-in.  There is a small cafe inside at one end, with chairs and tables on the pathways which makes you feel as though you're among the plants and trees whilst having a cuppa!"

119,Topical plants and more,Not to be missed free to enter and go in the Museum see what was made in Sheffield years ago before the foreign firms got in the act
120,Always beautiful ,Some lovely plants within the garden and seems very peaceful if arrive early less people. Can become very busy the food bars within the garden can also attract people to eat and drink within the enclosed garden. Just like a massive greenhouse in the town centre. Very mini version of the edan project

124,Excellent,A lovely place to go and sit and enjoy the atmosphere. The Winter Garden is a rather magical place in a busy city - such a nice place to walk through to get from the Crucible through to the Millennium Galleries or out towards the restaurants. Lucky to have this in Sheffield!
125,Garden in the city ,"Whether one wants a break from husltle and bustle of The town or shelter from elemmets, this is perfekt. We had a picnic after visit to the galery, aNd as both are free, it makes the combination very cheap way to send afternoon with the familly. The trees and bushes are getting quite vild. Totally safe for the little ones to run around."
126,Walk,"From the pictures it seems a lot bigger, it is more a gallery to walk through. It has 2 coffee shops that look OK but not exceptional. Nice place to just sit a bit on a bench and relax, like an indoor park for when it rains.It is free to visit"
127,Lovely ,Was heavy rain and around 10am so decided to walk up here. Really nice place. Great plants/ trees on the other side theres a cafe. Bit expensive. But thats the money side. I just sad down on a free bench and relaxed and people watched. Nice place. But should bring back the hole in the road.
128,Worth a wander through ,"Very romantic venue for couples, can’t wait to go back,Lovely tropical feel inside when it’s freezing out feels like you have been transported to a tropical island"
129,Great for a quick walk-through before the museum or Crucible,Winter gardens are a wonderful little escape from.the hustle and bustle of the city. One of the first places I visited when I first came to Sheffield. It's a wonderful place to spend an afternoon or jaut a quick escape on a lunch break. With cafes and eateries along with a wide range of exhibits and boutique shops it has something for everyone. A must see for any first time visitors to Sheffield
130,Unique,"This is a large glass building with tropical trees containing some little shops and pop-up shops and exhibition rooms.When we were there there was an exhibition of Sheffield Silver, its history and hand crafted show pieces. There was also an exhibition about the Peace Movement (anti-war).It felt a pleasant little haven where there was also a cafe."
131,Hidden escape,"Just a short wander there and back, really nice and comfortable.  Tropical gardens with banana trees, coconut tres and all manner shrubbery."
132,lovely,"Having lived in Sheffield for around 15 years, I usually make a point of visiting the Winter Gardens every time I'm in the city centre. It's a beautiful, peaceful indoor garden right in the heart of the city centre and is a great place to go for a moment's peace in the middle of a busy day or to eat lunch. I love looking at all the unusual plants there and the occasional art displays. There is also a cafe so it's a good place to meet friends for a coffee."
133,Peaceful,The Winter Garden is well worth a visit whatever the weather. There are some beautiful plants here very colourful. It’s not massive you can walk through in about 60 seconds but take the time to have a seat and enjoy the place.
134,Exotic Plants ,"Nice place to sit down and have your packed lunch. Can be very busy and there aren't enough benches to sit on. A bit tired and scruffy looking and some of the plants are a bit neglected,  brown and crispy! Floor stained and sticky. Parking is difficult if you are on a budget, the multi story car park nearby is expensive and limited on street parking. Some disabled car parking near the library but always full and not by badge holders! Sheffield is very poor for disabled parking and facilities."
135,Gorgeous city centre gardens,"The Winter Garden is only a few minutes walk from the main train station and well-signposted too. Anyhow, be aware that it is only a small'ish ""garden"" though with some large trees up to its very well-designed wooden frame. Well worth popping your head into and a few minutes walk."
136,"Amazing, calming place in town centre",Always an interesting place to go or just pass through. The art galleries are right next door too as is the gallery cafe.
137,Fabulous gardens to visit,What a lovely place - especially in winter! And it’s free! I just wish it was bigger with more seating and perhaps some grass to sit on! All City’s should have them!
138,Beautiful,"Sheffield have done a great job bringing nature into the town centre. It's right next to the crucible theatre. During the snooker weeks the BBC use the hall for interviews and practice tables. Inside there are trees , plants and flowers. The tunnel is an  arched glass dome. Being glass it creates it's own heat and in the summer it's boiling hot with doors wide open."
139,Lovely place,"Its not a large structure, but a very noticable part of town. Its put to various imaginative uses through out the year"
140,Oasis in urban Sheffield,Good shops for crafts and cafes. Museums and displays interesting. Close to winter gardens and theatres.

152,Interesting ,This lovely indoor garden offers a nice break from the cold and rainy outside.  It is even lovely to go into on a nice sunny and warm day.  The plants inside are beautiful to look at and if you want to know more about them there is plenty of information on what you see.  We were there and there was a nice choir singing and it sounded wonderful inside.  It is a nice place just around the corner from the peace gardens and just adds to the feeling of the whole area.

162,What a lovely inner city oasis!,We were in the area and decided to have a look in here. There are lots of trees and plants for a more tropical country. It is nice to walk around and there is a small pond. There is seating inside to sit and chill for a little bit. It is all covered so doesn't matter about the weather outside. It seemed to be safe inside. It is worth visiting this place if you're in the area.

170,Delightful Indoor Gardens,"I went on a trip to Sheffield with my mother, and this was one of the first places we decided to go and visit. The pictures make it look a lot larger and a lot more interesting than it actually was. We were both quite disappointed with what it was actually like"

180,FABULOUS PLACE!,"The architecture is as astonishing as the planting. High sweeping beams cover the area between the Millennium gallery and the neighbouring hotel, creating a large light area that has been filled with plants that provide shape and interest tot he space. There are benches and many people use this as a tranquil area to sit and enjoy a break. There is also a cafe and popular shop and it is easy to get into the gallery form here."

186,Europes Largest indoor greenhouse,"Sweet little place giving sanity to the workers and shoppers in their lunch time. Only a small selection of tropical plants but the place offers local craft shops, cakes and coffee. It also has exhibitions on and events like choirs or yoga. So a well utilised little Amazon jungle welcome in the heart of the shopping district."
187,Magical,Would be a lovely place to stop and read for half an hour as it is free to enter. Food and drink is available but there is not a lot of seating.
188,Great place,"Such a immaculate conception of how true nature can combine to become a beautiful hidden gem in a city landscape because it really makes you feel like like your truly able to forget your worries and concerns and put you at peace even of its just for a fleeting moment.

195,Nice and warm!,A good e ample of imaginative use of space to bring something different to a city centre.  Certainlcomplements the Sheffield Botanical Gardens.  A decent cafe within the gardens would make it even better and not allowing it to be used as a studio for world snooker would make it perfect.

197,Bit of a damp squib ,"About an hour's walk around if you go slow, great attraction. Right next to the museum and has lots of little cafes inside. Beautiful plants and lots of seating. Excellent to visit on a lovely day but it is inside if raining."

214,City oasis,"A walk through the gardens is a very calming experience in the centre of a busy city.  It is so pleasant to walk round and the little shops are nice to look in.  When you walk in here you enter another world, definitely worth visiting.  The area outside the gardens is also pleasant, very clean, a lovely place to get away from it all."

223,A lovely oasis of calm and a great picnic stop,I love Christmas shopping in Sheffield but it’s so nice to pop into the winter gardens and take time out. In December the gardens felt so warm and inviting. The tropical plants are so impressive and the smell of flowers is intensified under the fabulous glass roof. You must visit and take time to enjoy.
224,Worth visiting,These gardens and the adjacent millennium square are well worth a visit if you are in Sheffield great architecture and use of metalwork. Look for the measurements set into the stone next to the town hall. Craft for sale and metalwork museums just off the gardens. Several cafes suitable for lunch.

232,A pleasant area to spend a short break in-between shopping/walking around the city,"Fabulous bit of architecture. A great idea. And could have been stunning. However, as with Fargate and other areas, it lets the opportunity of impressing visitors go to waste. The planting is getting tired, the place is scattered with cheap, nasty  stalks and cafe overspill and it s lost it s tranquility. Apart from getting out of the rain, I wouldn't bother."
233,Wish every city had one of these,"The exhibitions are best visited at a minimum of 4 mph, so as not to waste time.  The venue is very good, with snacks and interesting shopping.  A good place to spend time away from the Yorkshire rain."

At best it’s a reasonable place to shelter when it’s raining outside, it has a few plants and trees which will hold your attention for a few nano seconds. There’s access to a few shops and the exterior is interesting again for a few seconds. If your passing worth a look once but nothing more."

265,Day out,Lovely quiet place to escape the bustle of the City Centre for a short time. Also shelter from any bad weather!Light and airy. Not overly big. The only thing that lets it down is some ridiculous large bright plastic ‘snakes’ in the plants! Why? If it’s ‘Art’ it doesn’t work!!
266,Exploring Sheffield,"It’s quite warm in here, and very peaceful. There aren’t too many things to walk around and examine as such, maybe 10 minutes maximum, but the building and plants make for a pleasant place to sit and relax. It’s generally not particularly noisy in here, and it seems to be very well monitored by staff.I’d highly recommend coming here for a breather and some peace and quiet if spending the day shopping or on your feet in Sheffield. There are a fair number of benches to make use of, and I’ve always felt comfortable on my own in here."
