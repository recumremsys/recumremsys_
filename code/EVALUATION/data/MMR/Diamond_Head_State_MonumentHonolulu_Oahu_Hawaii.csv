0,Expansive views... the famous Diamond Head,"I’ve heard that this is a great hike... but we didn’t hike up, we were on a tour and we were driven up.  Great views!"
1,"History, expansive views, excellent exercise....not to be missed","This ""hike"" (we are really only talking 1.6 miles total) is very pretty and views are gorgeous. But, it is one of the most popular hikes, so it is very crowded. Don't expect any serenity. The parking lot is small, so come early or take the available transit. Wear sneakers - even though you are on an island doesn't mean you should wear flip-flops as it can get quite slippery and it is fairly steep and definitely narrow. It is kid-friendly, especially as you can bribe with a delicious treat from the Dole truck at the bottom ;-)"
2,Great exercise and fantastic views,"It’s not as hard as we thought ! The hike to get there slowly goes uphill and you can stop along the way to catch your breath. There are steep steps towards the end  but walk at your own pace . There is a great food stand at the entrance of the park that I recommend ! Pure pineapple juice is delicious but unfortunately, it comes in a plastic cup. You can also purchase sweet pineapple slices separate . My daughter ordered dole whip and it was delicious ! They should use paper straws and  completely eliminate plastic containers .Prices could be better ."
3,Great view but come prepared,"The views are amazing! This was our first hike in Hawaii, and we did 2 hours after we landed. Crazy, but be wanted to wear ourselves out so we didn't nap and would adjust to the 5-hour time difference. And I am so glad that we did! We took a quick Lyft drive from our hotel on Waikiki beach, which is highly recommended since parking can be very limited. We were fortunate to have the ability to go on a Monday afternoon, which was way less crowded than usual. The fee is only $1 per person to enter. The hike for us for about 1.5-2 hours roundtrip with stops along the way and at the top. It was pretty east for the most part, rocky, but safe with fencing along. Some areas are pretty narrow so just be patient if people are coming the opposite direction. The entire way was just beautiful, lots of photo opportunities, but the views from the top are amazing -  all 360 degrees - mountains, ocean, city. Just wow. Bring water and a sweat rag. And there's some delicious treats at the bottom when you head. The pineapple whip with fresh pineapple was amazing. The fresh coconut juice was refreshing, but not sweet. This hike has left us a thirst for more to come!"
4,Spectacular!,Honestly this is a pretty easy hike for a person who does hikes :) and the view is spectacular! The only not fun part are the stairs (stair master time) and the short tunnel towards the top. I read a review to stop and take a breather before going through it so I also recommend. Catch your breath then head on through!  We took a Lyft there and jumped on a trolley back to Waikiki. Fresh coconut and pineapple juice at the bottom was a winner!
5,The Island's Icon,This is not an easy hike and we went a day after rain so there were some slippery parts. The steps are steep but it is so worth the view. We walked from Waikiki up to diamond head and it took about 2 hours all up but you can catch a bus to diamond head then just walk the crater.
6,The famous Diamond Head!,This was a great hike but I wish our tour guide and not said igt was only 800 steps to the top.....I think he meant to say 8000 steps.  It takes about 30  minute at a good pace to get to the top and some of the trail is a bit broken up.....so be careful....it would be easy to twist an ankle in some spots.  Once at the top the views are spectacular.
7,"Beautiful sunrise, but get there early!","We did the hike to the summit of Diamond Head.  It was a fabulous view.  The hike up is not bad,there are a lot of steps but I'm 65 and I had no issues.  Just take your time.  My husband has issues with his right leg and he made it; but we stopped to rest when we needed to.  It is not a huge distance but it is the number of steps."
8,Worth the Trip,"It is such a good hike, when you reach the top the views are beautiful. I didn't take the second set of stairs going straight up I took the easier stairs to the left. It took us half an hour to reach the top, but my daughter did it in 20 kinutes. Then after we decended there was a place to buy pineapple judce and dole ice cream"
9,Amazing Views,This was a quick fun hike. Definitely steep but it’s paved and has hand rails. The view is worth it (if you can get past the selfie sticks) and the dole pineapple truck at the bottom was a nice treat.
10,"Great hike, not too challenging, AMAZING views!",We have climbed several times and it’s not a hard hike but can be strenuous If you are not in shape ! This past time we climbed when it had rained the day before and the walk was slippery and dangerous in sections. Make sure to wear athletic sneakers or hiking shoes no sandals and be careful ! Arrive early so you can get parking !
11,A great walk with a great view.,"We hiked Diamond head on a cooler overcast day and we're so glad we did!  It's a pretty steep hike!  Easy to do, but definitely gets your heart pumping!  We took a trolley from our hotel and enjoyed our hike!"
12,Amazing views from the summit!,"We walked to the crater from our hotel in Waikiki and then did the crater walk. It is very popular but it is still comfortable on the track. The walk can be strenuous towards the top of the crater, but we saw people of all ages on the track. Take water and take sun protection. Looking out over Waikiki and Honolulu with the ocean beyond from the top is well worth the effort. Get yourself a pineapple on the way home."
13,A Must See Attraction,Visiting the Diamond Head Monument was no only a great hike to the top which little kids can complete.  There were good opportunities to see the wildlife and a great views from the top.
14,Well worth the effort to hike to the top.,I'm not a big fan of hiking and this trail was considered easy.  It was very safe and well indicated. But do not hike to the top around noon as the sun is way too intense. But the view is what decided me to hike up there.  It is worth it!
15,March 2020,"I was so looking forward to this hike but disappointed. There is one path up and down, so tight and there were literally thousands of people. Was a very slow go and the tunnels are just down right dangerous if you over 6' tall were a helmet. The lookouts are tiny and we were lined up just to squeeze in there for a few moments to snap some pictures. This needs some serious trail maintenance and maybe another trail head for the more advanced hikers."
16,Cheap and Great experience!,"Great visit. The hike is quite long, lots of steps but well maintained. Views were amazing. We took a taxi here but was very hard to get one on the way back as it had started raining."
17,Well worth the climb!,"It’s a quick hike, about 1.5 miles there and back, starts as a very slight slope and builds up to about 100 stairs to finish it off at the top.  I went at 730 am, any later and I may not have enjoyed it as the crowds were starting to show up and just one group of slow people can back it up pretty quickly."
18,Diamond Head visit ,This is a easy and rewarding hike for the whole family.  The views are spectacular and the kids didn't complain at all about the elevation change.
19,Wow,"Hike was fairly easy but the stairs were a little challenging but so worth it. We hiked with our 12, 9, and 6 year olds and they did great. Not a hike for people out of shape."
20,Great walk and wonderful views.,We actually walked from our hotel to Diamond Head via the coastal route which was beautiful but definitely a trek. Took the trolley back to our hotel which is a great option. The hike itself was a climb with lots of stairs towards the top but well worth the climb with amazing views. Cooler day so it wasn't bad.
21,Beautiful View and Historically Interesting,"Diamond Head is an amazing hike!! We tried to park in the parking lot, but it's so small that the lot was closed when we arrived at approx 7:30 am, so we had to park at a lot that was a 15 minute walk to the entry of Diamond Head. If you're walking in they charge $1 per person, if driving $5 per car. After paying the entry fee,  the hike begins with winding walkways, then you get to the uneven terrain and eventually the climb upwards and your journey through the tunnel. Once you get to the uneven terrain and stairs, the walkway is very tight. It's barely enough room for one person to walk. You will definitely get a good workout as you work your way to the top. The closer to the top you get, there are lookouts where you can rest and take gorgeous pictures. For the most part, everyone is moving at a steady rate. It took us 30 minutes once we started, to get to the top and it was definitely worth it!  The views from the top are amazing. It was very crowded at the top, but it was to be expected considering everyone was probably very tired and needed to rest. We stayed at the top at least 30 minutes. The sun was not fully blazing when we hiked, so hiking in early morning or late evening may help reduce fatigue.  Make sure to take some water and a towel (because you will be sweating).  Wear the appropriate shoes, especially since part of the hike is on slippery and broken up rocks.   Pace yourself....it will pay off in the end. Overall, I'm very glad I did the hike."
22,Nice hike!,"Really great way to spend the afternoon. The hike isn't too difficult, there were numerous people that didn't look to be in the greatest shape but they were doing fine. I would recommend wearing proper shoes."
23,Terrific views  and worth a visit...,"I have read reviews of this walk and most say if you have knee issues don’t do it. I have arthritis in one knee and really wanted to do it so set off. Some areas are steep, there are stairs also but mostly it’s a steady incline. I reached the top ok just taking my time and it was well worth it for the views and sense of achievement."
24,Beautiful Views,"Well worth the hike (trail and stairs ... nothing too difficult, but not for dress shoes and high heels).  Train has been improved from years past so it is much better for all.  Something to brag about when view the iconic Diamond Head pics.  You can point to the summit where you climbed to."
25,Great hike!,"This is a fantastic hike.  Its somewhat of a steep trail, but newly paved so much easier then it used to be.  Take water, wear a hat, Sun screen, and sturdy walking shoes, NO Sandles or flip flops! DAH !  You can use your cell pH as a flash lite in the tunnel.  This will be one of the most breathtaking panoramic views you will ever see in your life.  Its a must.  If you're a novice hiker just go slow, its so worth it!"
26,"Easy, well traveled, but great views","Even our kids loved the big monument. The sky seemed incredible! It’s a long walk, but worth it. I have arthritis in my knew but I still made it to the top! Yahoo!! Worth the trek! Great walk, and welcoming! I felt strong. Really made my day! Fantastic walk!"
27,Eh,....but didn’t climb to the top. The wife was concerned she couldn’t make it. So we stood at the bottom and looked up. Guess that will count?
28,Loved the hike but parking ;(,Great hike. Last bit was all stairs straight up. Took us about an hour but we were moving pretty quick and there weren’t any lines. I’d allocate and hour ... longer if it’s a busy season.
29,Worth the view!,"Beautiful, calm! Must do in Honolulu. I heard that hike was the easiest one! But took my breath away, in all meaning!"
30,Nice climb . Don’t miss it.,"The Diamond Head hike can be a very nice hike but if you are a hiker who does not like crowds this is definitely not the hike to attempt in Hawaii.  It's a fairly moderate hike so you don't have to be in great shape to do this hike.  There are many switchbacks so for most of the hike it is a gradual climb.  Towards the top of the hike there are vertical stairs. This is where people who are not in good shape will get winded.  At one point there is a section where you can choose to go up 99 steps or an easier route off to the side.  Once you get up there the view is spectacular.  You can see all of Waikik and the South shore coastline.  And you can see all of the crater and the mountains and valleys.  It is a great tourist hike, but with a lot of tourists there are lines everywhere.  Trying to get a picture without strangers in your picture is not easy to do."
31,A View worth the challenge,"Not a bad mile hike, the view from the top makes it totally worth it!. The steps were crowded so we took the long way up, got a few pics and took the steps back down.  Easy access to the park, restrooms in the parking lot and a food  vendor.  Would definetly visit again."
32,Tried and it failed!,"If you’re physically able to do this hike you must add it to your to do list! It would be strenuous for folks who are not very mobile or have any limitations such as knee, hip or ankle issues. My husband wasn’t too excited about going but after he did it he was glad he did! It was crowded but well worth it!"
33,"Fantastic views after a long, winding, steep walk",Always wanted to hike up Diamond Head. They say the view is amazing. The view is amazing but it does take some effort to get to the top.  Almost nothing is close to smooth or flat walking up the trail. So make sure you can walk up and down unlevel surfaces.  There are a few places to sit down for a break on the way up.  There are lots of stairs but you can take one of two ways up towards the top. One with more stairs than the other. The parking lot is small so you may not be able to get in that way but you can walk in if dropped off. Mornings are really busy. You might be able to park about a 1/2 mile away and walk in. There is a stand that sells refreshments etc. MAKE sure you take water with you.
34,Great ! ,"The hike to the top of Diamond Head is certainly worth it.  We went early in the day and there were still a lot of folks out doing the same thing; however, it made it fun to be walking to the top with lots of company (it wasn't so crowded that you were tripping over each other or anything!).  You may need to take a breather every now and then, and there are spots to do that (which often have a spectacular view, so you can catch your breath and take in the sights all at once)."
35,Worth the Climb ,We love this hike it is not too hard for the view that you are rewarded with. Our only complaint was that it was too busy but no way around that! For a better hike and not to have to pay for your car park further down the mountain.
36,Great walk ,The hike up and down is only 1 1/2 miles. Some people needed to stop and rest on the way up. There are lots of stairs and a short tunnel. The top is an old army bunker. There are some educational points but go up just for the view!
37,Weekend in Waikiki,"A must experience hike while in Honolulu! Omg! I cannot express how outstanding this hike was. Diamond Head is great for anyone who wants to experience nature at its finest. We did the early morning hike 6:30am so we could watch the sunrise and it was incredible!!! The hike itself was a moderate hike, but I recommend to get there as early as possible because it can get hot really fast. Take the essentials; water, sunblock, a hat and some really good shoes. There is a food truck that sells acai bowls, water, hot dogs, pineapple drinks, and some other goodies. Nice treat to yourself after conquering the crater. There was also a nice little souvenir store at the bottom of the hill too."
38,Great view!,A must do in Waikiki.  We walked from out hotel to the top and back again (approximately 14 km round trip) but there are plenty of transport options that will take you up there.  Breath taking views at the top
39,Moderate hike with a fantastic view!,"Was a good hike. Great view, once at the top. Came down and had some dole whip at the food truck. something different for us to do."
40,The view is great! Watch your speed..,"As many others noted, I did this hike at sunrise.  It was pretty dark at 6:30 so I recommend bringing a flashlight or using your phone.  Don't forget to bring water.  It is an inclined hike but not bad until you get to the stairs.  They are pretty steep and there are a lot of them.  However, it was well worth the trek. The views were amazing. I highly recommend doing this.  The parking/entry fee was only $5."
41,A hike must for all,"We visited the lookout and see the beach, also visited the Diamond Head national park and found the most expensive pineapple juice ever!! but about the taste worth it hahahahaThe best: the views!!! you should take a lot of pics in a sunny day,"
42,Top of Diamond head is an awesome view,"This was our second time hiking up to the top (our first was nine years ago!) so we knew what to expect.  There were a ton of tourists and we just looked past the huge crowds and enjoyed the beauty.  The views from the top are wonderful.   It's crazy hard to get a spot for a good picture at the top overlooking Waikiki and most people don't move once they find one.  It's easier to get pictures facing the ocean away from Waikiki.  We enjoyed some different view points along the rim before heading back down.  At the bottom we stopped at the gift shop and bought a certificate saying we had hiked to the top.  As a heads up, getting a parking spot is crazy hard.  We dropped everyone off and had the drive wait in line with the other cars to get a parking spot.  Took about 15 minutes.  It the lot is full they will make you drive back down to the lower lot and walk back up, but we chose to wait in line at the upper lot."
43,"Hike to the ""Top of Honolulu""",The view is spectacular. We walked from Waikiki beach up to Diamond Head. A very easy walk to get there. All sidewalks. Once at Diamond Head it's a moderate hike up to the top. Don't forget to stop at the snack shop to get some refreshments once your done.The hike is uneven terrain so just walk careful.
44,Great views,"Not as easy of a hike as I was assuming but I’m in decent shape and was prepared. We went later than planned so was pretty warm. The stairs just before the tunnel were a workout and if someone is claustrophobic the tunnel isn’t ideal. Gorgeous views - 360 of the coastline and Honolulu. Not hard but not easy. If you don’t park inside it’s $1 walking in or $5 for a car which sometimes you may have to wait 10 mins or so to get a parking space. There is a food truck at the base offering variety of food but the coconuts and pineapple are the best, especially after that hike!"
45,"Breathe taking views , considered the easy one, but took my breath away, in all the way!","Worth every step. I am 60, my wife is 56, and while we got winded near the top we didn't really have any problems - it was fun just to get out and walk off some of the island food! It was interesting to see that you got to the top rim of the crater by exiting a WWII pill box. The views of Honolulu, the mountains and the ocean were spectacular. Here are my tips:  1) walk from Waikiki 2.6 from Marriott; or take and Uber ($10-15) one way, depending on where you are in Waikiki; the 'green' trolley is $10pp one way! 2) tennis shoes good, flip flops difficult 3) watch the weather, don't forget a wind/rain jacket if chance of rain or drizzle 4) the trail will be more crowded that you think...early or late day is best 5) $1 per person entrance fee if you take something other than your own car (I don't know how much they charge per car, sorry)6) take camera/phone7) enjoy!!!"
46,Fun to do once ,"Enjoyed it very much, It was a long trip up to the top but once you get up there the view is absolutely beautiful"
47,The view makes it worth it,"This is our first activity during our recent trip to Hawaii. It's a moderate hike, though there are some steps that are a little steep. Wear good shoes and take water with you. There are a few stops along the way as well as at the top where you can enjoy the beautiful view and take pictures. And there are food stands where you can buy food/snacks including fresh pineapple and coconuts. Parking lot could get full when you need to wait for a parking space. But it didn't take us long because people just come for hiking and then leave instead of hanging around for hours. So the turnover is pretty fast.If you come on a Saturday, you can also visit the Farmers Market which is right next to it."
48,Great hike with wonderful views,"We were told that the Diamond Head offers the best sunrise views, and it was true. Me and my wife woke up early, planned our hike based on the sunrise time. Well, reached there before sunrise but were surprised to see there atleast a couple hundred visitors already waiting for the sunrise view. But eventually the moment was epic. You absolutely do not want to miss the hike to Diamond Head. Plan for an early morning hike. It would be a treat."
49,Ignore the crowds and just enjoy the view,We tried to go but there was no parking and to park at base and walk up was too much for the group we were with.
50,"Nice hike, Amazing view","We did the Diamond Head walk whilst on holidays. It's not overly difficult, but it can get a little busy depending on what time of day you decide to do the walk. The views @ the top are worth it though. 😊"
51,Great walk! ,"There were some 70 steps of steep hike. But the view in the end was worth it, you can see wakiki beach and holululu, and the inland from the other side. Can get hot at the top and the parking lot can get full very early, we ended up parked at 20 mins away and hiked up to the entrance."
52,Enjoyable afternoon hiking Diamond Head.,"We visited on 12/29 and it was fairly crowded, but a beautiful day and not too hot for climbing. It is not a long hike, but it is fairly steep and not handicap friendly. Still the views are great and you get a 360 degree perspective."
53,Hike,We walked in the late afternoon to see the sunset.  The track is well maintained but does require some basic fitness.  It wasn’t crowded and was a great opportunity for photography.   The pineapple drink at the bottom on the downhill trip was very welcome.   We Ubered to the track it was easy and convenient.
54,To the top in 20 mins - Yes!,"Great experience, with awesome views!  It's an extensive walk, but one that people of all ages can and should experience.  The views from up top are breathtaking!!"
55,Beautiful Light to medium hike. Multi-Views for pictures,"I've this hike many times but took the four kids up this trip. Even the 8 year old did it easily. Go early, we like taking an uber there no parking fee and they drop you off right at the tr0al head.Dole whip, shaved ice, and snacks are sold at the base too"
56,Beautiful view but too crowded.,"It took us 1 hour and 10 minutes to hike up from our hotel on Waikiki beach (near the zoo) We started out at 5.30am and got to the top at 6.40am and waited for the fabulous sunrise just after 7am. The path up to the top from the visitor centre was busy and it was pitch black, so you definitely needed the torch on your phone! There are a couple of decent breakfast places on the way back to WaikikiDefinitely well worth getting up early to hike up"
57,Great hike. ,"It was very busy when we did the hike, arriving around 10 am. I’d recommend going early during the holidays. At times, the bottlenecks caused by the crowds led to stoppages. The hike is not challenging but offers nice views of the coast."
58,Great Hike with great views,Nice scenic hike!  Make sure you were proper shoes.  It rained a bit the day we went and it was slick.  Take water too if its warmer when you go. It is very crowded at dawn with all the tour busses.  We went about 9 and it wasn't too bad since we were before the second wave of tours.
59,"An impressive sight from an iconic ""site""",Amazing hike. They charge you a dollar to get in and then you follow the trail all the way up. It's a combination of ramps and stairs. I would suggest still wearing good shoes as there are some uneven paths at times. It's pretty busy as it's a popular hike but very much worth it for the views. They don't let anyone hike after 4.30pm so make sure you get there in time.
60,Diamond Head - must see while in Oahu!,I couldn’t believe it was only $1 to hike Diamondhead.  I recommend just taking a transit bus.  It’s a nice hike.. it was a bit crowded but well worth it.
61,"Amazing Views, Must so while visiting Honolulu ",It is a beginners hike to the top of the pillbox. We took our 5 five year old and she was able to make it.View was breathtaking over looking the resorts around Diamond Head and Waikiki.  You can see Koko Head from the top and admire the landscape on the southeast part of the Oahu.  If you want to avoid the crowds go early in the morning and the trail wont have as much people for better photo ops.
62,Loved the Diamond Head State Monument!,Even with a knee waiting a replacement it wasn't a terrible hike !!!  The view is well worth it ... breath taking
63,Worth the climb,There is a good hiking trail here.  This trail is suitable for all ages - not too difficult.  Good views.
64,Beautiful inside the volcano.,Highly recommend this hike. We stayed at hotel Renew and could walk to the trailhead. Spectacular views.
65,Be prepared,"I’m not the athletic or outdoorsy type, but this was mostly an easy hike. Bring water. It’s a sloping uphill walk, then towards the top, you will encounter steeper areas, a 99-step stairwell, and a long, dark tunnel. We tried to get to there for the sunrise, but I couldn’t get my husband awake on time. By the time we got to the park (about 7am) there were already people coming down the trail. It was CROWDED when we reached the top of the crater (about 45 mins to the top for us). You won’t really have a quiet moment to take in the scenery and enjoy the view because the whole place is crammed full of people taking selfies. Not advising against the experience, per se; just do your research and find more opportune times to go if crowds are a factor for you. It was beautiful nonetheless. I got a Dole Whip on the way out of the park (there’s a food truck that sells pineapples and snacks), and that made everything better. :)"
66,"I’m out of shape, but I did it! ",This hike was very tricky and hard with all of the uneven parts and especially if it was raining . I recommend taking a break in the middle of the hike to drink some water
67,Great views - lots and lots of people,"Awesome hike with phenomenal sights!While in Oahu this was highly recommended so we decided to check it out. Beautiful hike up the side of crater which includes a dirt path, an old tunnel, and steps. All of these were used by the military during ww2. Hike isnt to difficult and is worth the view.I highly recommend checking this out!"
68,Busy but fun!,"This was a fairly easy hike, but it is uneven terrain as you begin your accent. It offers amazing sight lines of the coast and of the Diamond Head Crater! A definite must do!"
69,Great visit,its a short but great hike with great views from the top and food and drink at bottom when you come out. i would however let people know at the entrance when the lot is full rather then have us drive all the way around to find out we cant park at base and need to park outside of the entrance. but all in all a great experience!
70,Great visit!!,The hike going up and down was pretty easy.  It’ll take about half an hr each way.  The view above looks pretty nice since you can see the city on one side and the ocean and beaches on the other side.  Definitely stop by in the morning for a nice workout.
71,Incredible views,"After hiking Koko Crater Stairs the Diamond Head State Monument hike seemed very easy in comparison. There were quite a bit more people but the ease of the hike is refreshing. Most of the trail is pavement, you could do this with just running shoes very comfortably. Even saw some people in flip flops too. The ground does get dusty though"
72,Beautiful view,It is a step climb but the views were worth it. There is a lot of walkers doing the trip so be prepared for that and also for returning walkers
73,My favorite activity in Honululu,"My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Honolulu and decided to hike the mountain. The hike to the top took us about 35 min, which included a few stops along the way for pictures. Before you reach the top, you must walk through a very narrow tunnel, which, for someone like me, who is somewhat claustrophobic, wasn’t all that fun; however, once we exited the tunnel and began the last part of the hike, maybe 5 more minutes, the view was absolutely amazing. We took panoramic pictures of the ocean! I would highly recommend visiting Diamond ahead!"
74,Beautiful,The place was very crowded but that wasn't a problem. The view is totally worth it! The hike to the top is pretty chill.
75,"Great views, but very crowded","It was a nice hike to the top. The views of the ocean are spectacular.  We took an Uber to Diamond Head visitors center. It is about .8 mile to the top (very steep).  It was a nice walk back to center of Waikiki or 2.8 miles  if you want to be specific. We stopped at the Rainbow Drive-in for lunch on the way back. If you want exercise it was a nice morning of walking, viewing and lunch at a local favorite."
76,Diamond Head,"The hike up to the top is a little difficult and at times you want to turn back, but the views are worth it.  For those of you who are claustrophobic please note that there is a very tight tunnel you need to make it through shortly before the top.  This was the hardest thing for me and I am not claustrophobic!!!   The view is worth it though."
77,Diamond Head Expedition,"This is a must see stop if you are on Oahu. While the hike is steep at times, it's very manageable because the path is paved and has rails. It's also wide enough to stop & pause if needed. It only took our family of four, 25 minutes to hike up and the views were incredible---city, ocean & mountains all in one spot."
78,Diamond Head,"We really enjoyed our visit. It's a must-do in Oahu. The hike is quite long but well maintained. We loved the views. Parking lot is very small, but we waited in a line and there was a person there to organize it. We waited about 15 minutes to get a parking slot."
79,Amazing,We loved hiking up Diamond Head (DH). It was neat to see the island from the top. If you are staying on Waikiki Beach try starting from your hotel. We went from the Hilton Garden Inn to Leonard's and got Malasadas and then hiked to DH and up. Needless to say we needed the Pineapple juice they offer at DH after our hike up. We then hiked home. The whole thing took half a day.
80,somewhat under-whelming,"The view at the top is very nice. The hike to get to the top is very tiring, it makes it worse that it is so crowded. There's people coming and going from all directions. There is no hiding from the sun while climbing up the trail. Very hot. There are a few rest areas along the way. Parking was a nightmare. Expand that lot, there is plenty of room. Overall - not too bad."
81,Beautiful views and worth the hike.,"That is a medium hike. For a previous hiking fanatic to now a homemaker, that was a decent hike. The tunnel is a bit tight but the view is worth it all. Water. Bring lots of water."
82,Breathtaking natural wonder!,"Nice hike, mildly challenging. My wife doesn't hike at all and had no problem with the trail. The views that you get at the top are completely worth the trip. I'd go earlier in the day before the bigger crowds show up. This is now on my to-do list for every future Hawaii trip I take."
83,Nice and easy hike,"It is a moderate hike that culminates into 360 degree view of Honolulu. You see a lot of families walking here. I stopped twice to take pictures at the look out. At the end it is little challenging for those that have not climbed stairs in a while, but a good fun hike"
84,Long hike,Nice and safe hiking trail. It's about 20 mins to go all the way up. Amazing view is waiting for you at the end. 初心者でも登れるハイキングで、お子さんも沢山上っていました。頂上までは大人で約20分。時間によってはとても混んでいますが眺めは最高です。日差しが上るにつれ強くなるので帽子をお水は必須です！
85,Great hike,"We decided to do this early on a Saturday morning. I'm glad we did. This gets very busy, and there is limited parking. It's $5/car load. We previously hiked up to the top of Diamond Head 14 years ago, so we were looking forward to going again. Make sure you are prepared for the weather. It was a cloudy day and starting raining on us, but we had our umbrellas. Also, make sure you wear closed-toed shoes and take water to stay hydrated. The path is paved until you get to the base of the crater then it's rocky and you have to watch your step. The good thing is you can go at your own paced and people aren't trying to rush you along. There are 2 sets of steep stairs. I'm not in physically good shape, but after resting periodically I was able to make it to the top. When you get to the last set of stairs there is an alternate route without stairs. You just go to the left. It's longer, but it won't wear you out near as much. I would suggest going early to avoid heat, and try and go on a clear day so you can get the best shots at the top."
86,Can be done with a young kid ,"the entire hike is mostly paved.  It is a strenuous hike, but not horrible.  The views from the hiking trail and the summit are amazing.  This is a worth while experience."
87,Panaromic picture postcard views from the top🤩😍👌,We climbed Diamond Head for our second time with friends of ours for their first time. We did not go as a tour. Some parts of the climb can be challenging for some people but there are lots of places to stop for a break along the way. Once up to the top you’ll really enjoy the views. Be sure to wear footwear for a trail hike and you may want to take water with you.
88,Headed to the top!,It's a hike but worth every step!  Diamond Head is a must see for visitors.  The views are breathtaking.
89,Good,"It's not an easy walk, tons of people, but the view is worth it. Bring water! Also, the Pineapple Whip from the food truck is THE BOMB and you will want one after that long, hot hike up and down, trust me."
90,great view.. and good work out,A beautiful location and site! the hike up the mountain was exhilarating of not tiring! great facilities available and what a view once at the top
91,I can see Clearly now,"We booked a tour to Diamond Head, left about 7am so we got there before the crowds. It was a nice walk up there however there were some parts that were quite slippery, it had been drizzling so that may have been why.  Luckily there were some hand rails to grab on to. There were some steep stairs & a tunnel to go through so that was quite cool.  When we got to the top the views were amazing, well worth it. The crowds starting coming through as we were descending so it is best to go up early."
92,Great Hike,Recommendation is to arrive earlier. We reached 630 and when we started our climb some were already on way down midway up. On our way down past 715am the crowds were arriving. Views are spectacular.The path up may be slippery and uneven  at places so be careful.You can take a trolley back to town at the guard house when done but we got charged $10 pax for a short ride.
93,Worth the Climb,"We arrived fairly early in order to get a parking spot, but there were lots of tour groups also.  Hike is fairly easy and much of it is in the shade.  Great views and worth the climb in spite of the crowds."
94,Go early!,"If you are able to walk up inclines and stairs, this should be doable. It it somewhat like walking a city sidewalk, for the number of people. At the top, there are beautiful views of the city. If you are in the right season and lucky, whales can be seen."
95,Worth the Trek,"We enjoyed our trek up Diamond Head - it was a warm, mostly sunny day. The 4 of us ranging in age from 59-66 all made it there and back down. No incidents! Mostly gradual inclines / declines on uneven terrain. So be sure to watch your footing so as not to trip or twist an ankle. Nice views all the way! At one point we were rewarded with a beautiful rainbow! Costs just $1- $2 each. Sorry I never paid much attention to the exact cost. Took us a couple of hrs I believe. We would do it again! Great views and good exercise!"
96,Beautiful ,Great view at the top for sunrise! We got there early for sunrise. The climb was crowded with people. Recommend bringing a flashlight so you can watch your steps.
97,Family hiked while I sat eating dole whip,Was a very good hike up to Diamond Head at the top thoroughly enjoyed it I'm 62 and had no problems at all with it beautiful sight up top
98,Family fun,You have to do this hike to check it off of your list. It's crowded but worth it for the view at the top and the Dole Pineapple whip at the bottom afterward. If you really want a challenging hike with even better views I highly recommend doing the Koko Head Crater hike after doing Diamond Head.
99,Amazing views ,"Was hot, so we bought a dole whip at the start and ate it on the way up! Wonderful views at the top."
100,Must do,"I recommend hiking up Diamond Head if you're in the Honolulu area and looking for a beautiful view and somewhat challenging exercise. It will get your heart pumping if you're looking for exercise, although people in average physical condition should be able to do it fine. The views are amazing!"
101,Great views - easy hike.,"After riding through a tunnel you arrive inside the crater of an old vulcano, there you hike the side upp to an old military installation with a magnificent view over the ocean and honolulu. Make sure to bring water and wear good shoes!"
102,Fantastic views,"A beautiful view and nice little hike. Wear shoes, we saw a few people walking in flip flops which didn't seem like a good idea."
103,Unbeatable view of Waikiki,We got to Diamond head around 0700 and we were part of a crowd of people heading to the top and heading down.... not what we expected.  We were told there are lots of crowds all day long.
104,Climb to the sky,"Great hike, which took about an hour from the gate. Some steep parts and stairs - be careful if you have a knee injury. Stunning views from the top, with several lookout points. There are restrooms at the bottom and also a food truck which sells Dole Whip."
105,Worth the walk,"My husband and I hiked up to the top.  It's been something I've wanted to do. We went a little faster than others, but you can definitely go at your own pace.  There are many areas where you can stop and take pics along the way, or sit and have lunch."
106,Tried to visit,"We took a taxi from the zoo to the crater for 15$. Quick and cheap, and it wasn’t a problem getting a taxi back again even though we are five. The taxis are waiting for customers inside the crater. It only costs 1$ to enter the crater trail. The walk up the crater is steep and uneven and can be rather slippery, and it is not for the poorly walkers or disabled. Otherwise it is manageable. When you get to the second and really steep and narrow stairs, I recommend not going up that way and instead going left around. That trail is easier and the views are amazing! The walk up is certainly awarded when you see the beautiful view of Waikiki. A must do!"
107,Tiring trek for outstanding views,"This hike should NOT be done by anyone has done more than one hike at any point in their life. It is over crowded with tourists on their go pros attached to selfie sticks, documenting a climb that could be done on your hands, backwards while sipping a mai-tai from the local bars. The views are substandard and not worth the cattle train that exists going up and down. If you are wearing heels and think it's cool to do a hike and take 100 selfies at the tops, this ones for YOU!"
108,Vacation,This is a great 2 mile round trip hike but be prepared for some steep inclines and steps. The reward is awesome views of Hawaii. I would suggest gong early since the parking lot is VERY small and they stop allowing vehicles to enter. There is an off site parking lot that we where unable to find but that will add another mile to the hike...each way. Walk in fee is $1 and parking is $5  but it is well worth it
109,Must do in Oahu,"The views were amazing. The hike is not for the faint of heart. There is no way little kids could make this hike without help from parent and that just makes the hike harder for parents. I only mention this because I saw several parents try to start this trek with kids, but no one had kids at the top. It does get slippery if you go with any rain or mist, which seems to be always during my trip."
110,Cool touristy spot,Very nice hike that is safe for all skill levels of climbing. Great views of Honolulu from the top! Good parking and reasonably priced.
111,Tough hike but worth the views,"This is a great hike and lots of stairs uphill,  but worth doing when in oahu.  Definitely bring water and try to go early before the heat gets too bad."
112,Hiking,"There are plenty of other people on this path, and at least during the holidays it was actually crowded at the viewpoint on top, but it was a fun walk with nice views all along. It is steep enough to require some fitness, but there are no precarious spots and it's not too far. Bring water bottles as there's not much shade along the way. There is a bathroom and water filling station just before you start the walk.We took a rideshare car to the park. They dropped us off and we paid $1 each entrance fee."
113,Excellent experience...,Easy hike that leads you to amazing views of the surrounding area. I found a poster telling the story of the introduction of Kiawe to hawaiian islands. Kiawe is omnipresent in O'ahu island and particularly at Diamonds head crater. What it is interesting for me is that Kiawe is actually Algarrobo (prosopis plaida) that was introduced from south america in the 1850's.
114,Spectacular View,"Let me start off by saying that hiking is one of my favorite activities. This is not ""hiking"" to me - paved trail with TONS of people. And we're talking people wearing flip flops, etc, you name it. The trail was all switchbacks and ended with a great view, but it could only be enjoyed briefly because so many people behind you wanted to see too so it was a rush rush thing. We didn't do any more hikes after experiencing this one. Sad. I gave it 3 stars cos it's a neat view, but just not what I was expecting at all. Not worth packing tennis shoes/hiking shoes. Parking: they have you pull in line with your vehicle and when a spot opens up they direct you there. It's a really smooth system and we didn't wait for more than 5-10 minutes."
115,Gorgeous!,It's quite easy to reach the top of the monument. From the top there is a great view and in January we waited for the sunset and were lucky to go out before the main gates were closed.
116,Fantastic hike,The hike up took us about 30 min. It was hard at some spots and the stairs during the last part of the hike were steep and narrow. The view more than made up the hard work hiking up to the top. We managed to catch the sun rise at the top and took some amazing pictures of that. There were a lot of people there though... which made pictures taking a challenge.
117,Well worth it !!!,"We caught the number 2 bus from Waikiki, the bus drops you off near the trail into the crater. After a short walk you pay your $1 to enter the crater. The crater itself is beautiful and it’s beauty improves as you walk up the trail. My husband has a bad knee and he had been warned to not walk the trail, we decided to start the hike and if he felt uncomfortable we would turn back. The first part is nicely paved and flat, then the path becomes more uneven and steep. We took lots of tests and before we knew it the stairs were in front of us. The views from the top were worth all the hard work. After some photos and rest we started the decent. It was busy and crowded, but we always managed to find a good spot to enjoy the view and take some snaps. Highly recommend you will regret not giving it a go. Mahalo!!"
118,Do not miss but wear good shoes ,"Wear good walking shoes, as some steep inclines, wet stones which can be slippery. Our family ranged in age from 8yrs-74yrs---everyone loved it."
119,Humbeling,Was hoping to go there during our interisland staycation since we imagined it would not be as crowded as it usually is but unfortunately (July 2020) it was still closed
120,Up the mountain with a 3 and 5 year old,"Great hike and amazing view! The only downside of this is that the parking ($5) can be extremely limited for how many people are trying to come in. I’d recommend making this your first stop of the day, unless you want to park at the bottom and hike up the WHOLE mountain (the hike from the top is already 1 mile). Little kids and the elderly might find the hike challenging, as there are a lot of stairs and fairly steep incline."
121,Intersting,"This is a moderate difficulty hike about 45 minutes up.  There are very narrow spots with lots of exposed rocks, an area that you go through a low dark tunnel and then steep stairs to get up the viewing area.  It becomes very crowded early, so get there by 8 am if possible.  the parking lot only holds 40 cars"
122,"Beautiful, rugged, stunning",My wife and I did the Diamond Head Peak with our 15 mo daughter. There are no provisions for a stroller/ pram so a baby carrier is highly recommended. Also a good Level of fitness is recommended if you want to go all the way to the peak along with good running or hiking shoes. Take plenty of water as during hot season it is very hot. The terrain is well maintained and there is ample room to walk with hundreds of people as the place does get busy. The steps near the peak are steep so caution is required if you don’t like heights or get dizzy spells.It is a great morning activity to do with the family and on the return you can stop for a nice cold drink or ice cream.
123,Great trip! ,"Great way to start Hawaii and Waikiki after long plane flights, Started early morning and it was very popular on the day we went. Must have patience as it the walk accomodates most walker types and even people in High heels and evening gowns. Great for family to do some bonding with spectacular view makes the effort very worth while."
124,Best view of Waikiki beachfront,The experience of hiking to the edge of an extinct volcano is on our list of “must-do” in Honolulu. We hiked in the morning. Lots of information available in the Visitor Center area that you can read before you start.  Make sure to use the restroom and refill your water bottle before you start your hike. Pause when you need to catch your breath and just enjoy and take in the scenery. Gorgeous views of Oahu and the Pacific Ocean - so worth it. Beautiful hike!
125,Diamond Head,"The crater hike is definitely a must do when visiting Hawaii.  The hike itself would be considered intermediate with uneven surfaces most of the way up and some strenuous parts.  There were a number of kids and older folk on the trek so as loing as you have good health it is doable.  Toward the top there is the tunnel walk which is unique and then to the top with spectacular 360 views of Waikiki.  Make sure you take runners, water and a hat, and put sunscreen on before you leave!The walk down is easy and make sure you stop off for a refreshing pineapple dessert at the food truck when you are done.It wasn’t too busy when we were there but the track is narrow with single file in each direction so I could imagine you would need a little patience when it is peak.   My advice is just relax and enjoy the experience.Highly recommend this walk!Note:  We walked from our hotel on the beach the entire way which took over 4 hours.  If you are not up for that level of effort, catch the trolley to the middle of the crater where the walk starts."
126,Get ready for a hike....lol,"This is a strenuous climb by path and lots of stairs.If you go left before the last set of steep stairs it is a bit easier.Many areas to stop and rest along the way, as well.Views are amazing!"
127,Beautiful views,"Super cool time with family and cheap ! Think it was a dollar admission fee to hike the park. Kids had a great time. Ages 10-17 great history and views of Honolulu are breath taking. We where able to see the city, Ocean all surrounding. We even noticed a whale out in the distance come up and down for some time. Must see if your in Hawaii."
128,Definitely go!,"Hiking Diamond Head as a family with teens was a great time. We took an Uber from our hotel in Waikiki which was quick and not expensive ($10). We went at 8:30am and beat the crowds although still plenty of people. The last bit will get your heart pumping as you climb stairs but it’s a fairly short hike to the top. Amazing views, obviously. To pickup Uber to depart the area, walk through the highway tunnel to the lower parking lot-they can get you there. (Don’t make the Uber wait in line at the main gate; takes too long)."
129,Terribly crowded hike with subpar views,"Beautiful inside the volcano. Lots of trails you can take. It was surprisingly green and Lush in there. Have seen it there on countless trips to Hawaii, but never went up inside it until this trip and I'm glad I did."
130,A worthwhile trek but not the easiest!,The walk/hike up the path was fairly full of people but not crowded. The weather was great and the view of the ocean and the city was enjoyable.
131,Excellent walk from Waikiki,"Be prepared for rain, sun, heat and the incline of the walk.  We're both 60 or older and we have knee and hip issues. We still made it to the top by taking our time and stopping along the way.  The walk is uneven, possibly slippery in places and LOTS of steps at the top.  When you come through the tunnel go left and it's a less strenuous climb.  Take water along and a camera. The view at the top is really beautiful - all of Waikiki, Honolulu, and the other side of Oahu."
132,Woohoo!,"This was our third climb so I had to rate it a little less than the first when it was a nivel experience. Having said that, I would consider it a must do if you are in Honolulu. Public tranportation is available and cheap. It was $2.00 for a city bus, but it does not get you real close to the crater. About a 15 min walk and it does get hot. There are trolleys that drop you off right at the visitor's centre but they are more expensive. We went by rental car and the fee was $5.00 for parking. No other charge. Since we are both seniors we took our time going up. Also my wife has a bad knee, but that should not deter most people. They say 20-30 min is a good time to reach the top. The ascent is fairly gentle with the stairways the hardest part. 99 and 76 steps. There is a long tunnel too, if you are claustrophobic at all. The view at the top is spectacular. We liked being able to see our hotel, the Royal Hawaiian. You really should go."
133,Hike and Great Views,"I have not being up to Diamond Head in 40 years, but all the memories came flooding back. The view is something you don't forget easily, and it figures prominently in the view from down below on Waikiki Beach, which just reminds you of the glory of that view. There's a few long flights of stairs with maybe 60 and 100 steps each, but if you take time any one can make it to the top. It's really worth it!"
134,Poorly ran ,"We loved the park and we did the hike with the four years old boy. It was doable, we had to carry him during part of the hike but he was able to do most of it with us.The views from the top were really spectacular."
135,Awesome view!,"A bit of a hike to get to the top but so beautiful once you are there! Lots of stairs, but the view is so worth it."
136,Diamond Head Hike,"we last climbed diamond head 23 years ago when we visited hawaii for our 25th wedding anniversary. have visited a few times since and decided it was time for another climb when we were here in nov. we arrived between 8-9:00 a.m. and parked outside the parking area, not sure if spots available. walked through the tunnel, and used the restroom facilities and got a map after paying the entrance fees. concrete path for the first bit. the switchback trails help with the steep 560'/0.8 mi. ascent. not too busy, people already descending as we were walking up. drizzling at times but still warm. the 3 sets of stairs are challenging. one needs to be somewhat fit to do this climb. great views from the observation station at the top and from the lookout on the way down. the metal handrails help. the trail is uneven and can be slippery. when we arrived at the bottom the parking lot was full. there were tour buses and it was busy. there is a pineapple stand and a souvenir spot. very little of plant or bird life, so that is not part of the hike. interesting to read about the history of the site, dating back to 1908. glad we finally did this climb again. we had just returned from japan where we had done a couple of hikes so we were in o.k. shape. we're almost 70 and I'm looking forward to doing this again!"
137,Great hiking trails with amazing views,"What a variety of views, from our hotel on Waikiki Beach we caught ""The Bus"" - note cash only, fee is good for 24 hours, keep your receipt - Had some interesting conversations with local residents on Oahu's public transit. About a 15-20 minute bus ride through surrounding neighborhoods, took us to a community college campus just outside the park entrance, walked through the tunnel which passes through the crater rim - traffic is a little close here but speed limit was low maybe 20mph. Then you are greeted with a grassy/bushy tree covered landscape inside the old volcano. About a 1/4 mile walk along the road to the entrance booth - no side walk here - seems like there should be. There's a 1 dollar fee for walk-ins, parking is a problem sometimes. Information/Concession area at the parking lot and then the trail to the lookout. Trail has plenty of views on the way, can be tiring with all the vertical but not too bad.Even has tunnels as part of the trail. Take a left after the first tunnel and avoid the second tunnel to the right if you don't want to crawl over the wall from the lookout bunker to get to the top. Stunning views of Honolulu, the ocean and surrounding island well worth the hike."
138,great hike,"Go early - a lot of visitors come to this attraction so it can be very busy as the day goes on! We went mid morning and the path was pretty busy going up and going down, but it was still a very enjoyable hike! It was beautiful at the top and the 360 view was AMAZING! There is a steep stair portion, but also a longer flatter route to the top which is great for all hikers! Tasty treats at the bottom when you finish! Bring water and sun screen and solid walking shoes! We enjoyed the top for about 30 minutes, so I would factor at least 2 hours for the hike from start to finish!"
139,Beautiful!,"Hiking up Diamond Head was a breeze. A steady ascent but never very difficult or hard on the body. And the view once you get to the top is stellar, of course."
140,The view is breathatking!,A beautiful hike up Diamond Head mid morning before it became too hot.  It was quite busy that day but everyone kept a nice steady pace and just passed the ones who couldn't .  Seating was available at certain look off points which provided much needed relief.  The trail was in good shape but closer to the top it became a bit rough and  uneven so I'm glad I had proper footwear on and no sandals.  Beautiful views through out the hike.
141,Great hike with amazing views!,Very nice walk but be ready for an incline and then a lot of steps to the top. Bring water. There is very few benches and the trail can be crowed.  Get the dole ice at the end of your trip .
142,Views for days!,"Walked this many times.  This was the most crowded I have seen.  One dollar walk-in fee, 5 for cars.  Just a mass of people at the coconut truck, bathrooms, tables, and walk.  Pace is slow, and stops were frequent.  Views are amazing, but the rest is forgettable."
143,Nice view but crowded,Started of the day with a ride in the Green Line express to diamond head. Great hike up the mountain to a fabulous view. $1 entry fee for walk in and totally worth it. The view of not only Waikiki but all the surrounding area is breath taking.  Good way to get some cardio in to jumpstart your day
144,Nice view and well laid out; albeit crowded at Christmas time.,This is a easy hike but always busy.  The hardest part are some stairs at the top.  Great view from top.  A couple of food vendors at parking lot if you get thirsty.  Parking lot gets full all the time so bus in or walk.  Recommend good running shoe or hikers as the trail is uneven.
145,Love the view from the top!,It’s a nice little challenge the stairs near the top. Well worth the walk as the view was fantastic. Shaved ice cream at the bottom of the hill was perfect
146,Nice hike but make sure you have 1$ cash for walk in entry ,"This hike is not for the faint of heart. I love that it's not perfectly groomed, but adequate. A wonderful way to work out, a wonderful view from the top and a nice little gift stand and fruit stand. Loved it all!"
147,Sunrise,"Read a few reviews which suggested to be there at the crack of dawn but let’s be honest we couldn’t reach the trail before 12 (on a Monday) after finishing brunch etc with 2 young kids. Around 50 parking spots but very well organised, you pay $5/ car and the parking attendant ushers you to a slot - may have to wait a little - we waited 7/8 minutes so not bad ( there is a waiting section on the parking lot) Started the hike and 5 minutes in, Mr 3 year old was tired and had to be carried ( up and down) from there on. The Trail does get narrow in parts and people coming in both directions. Please don’t Strollers or they end up on the side of the trail. Don’t go without the Pineapple smoothie and pineapple whip (my fav). Hat sunscreen, water and good spirit mandatory!"
148,Wow!,"We timed our trip so we got there in time to get up to the first look out point to see sunrise. That is just a little later than most people who get there for sunrise - as folks are typically trying to get to the top to see sunrise rather than just to the first rise. Our strategy worked well, as we were headed up to the top when most folks were headed down - so we had more space to ourselves at the top. Sunrise was gorgeous."
149,Workout and a view,"The walk is uneven and very steep towards the end but well worth the effort! The views on the way up are gorgeous and the view from the top is breathtaking. My six year old could not do the final portion of the walk due to the amount of stairs so she stayed back with her Grandma. Bring a camera, water, and you will definitely need to wear comfy shoes and watch your step!"
150,Love the views from the top of Diamond Head!,"Coming to Hawaii, I was planning amazing hikes in nature and to go see the volcanoes. The Diamond Head trail is for everyone that is capable of climbing stairs and walking uphill for a little while. It's very much controlled and secured, which of course can be a good thing. But it was not the hike in nature I was hoping for and it was extremely crowded!  Go ahead if you like a relatively easy hike and hope for a beautiful view of the crater, the ocean and Waikiki. But plan a second hike somewhere else if you want to experience Hawaii's beautiful nature !"
151,Great Hike,"We started our walk at the opposite end of Waikiki Beach from Diamond Head and walked all the way there, and then up to the top. In total it was a bit more than ten miles. If you’re not into hiking just catch the trolley, a bus, or an Uber to the park.  The hike up is a bit tiring if you’re used to hiking, but if you’re not it can be pretty tiring. There were a lot of older people and very heavy people who went to the top, so it’s not that bad, and there’s lots of places to stop and rest along the way. Once up the views over the ocean and down Waikiki Brach are beautiful. Definitely worth a few hours away from the beach."
152,Great adventure ,"Wife and I toured the old volcano Feb 26/20. A significant climb, well worth the effort - impressive view from the top, and breathtaking scale of the crater."
153,Amazing Sunrise,Hiked this gem early in the morning to witness the sunrise. Tip: wear comfortable shoes as some areas are not paved. Reaching to top you'll see the beautiful city facing ocean and the crater of a volcano on the other side. I would not suggest bringing young kids since it is tiresome and dangerous for them.
154,Fabulous at sunrise!,"The hike was for someone in a healthy shape quite easy! At the end, you can decide whether to take stairs, which is the harder way or take the other way. I went during lunch time when it was really hot. There weren't that many people hiking to that time, which was quite nice. However, when I reached the top, the area is rather small and it was full with people. The view was great though!It costs one dollar (cash only) to get into the hike or 5$ if you wanna park your car. I suggest to take the bus to diamond head. This saves you money and you don't actually hike further than the people driving up cars."
155,Worth the walk,"View on a clear day was spectacular! Worth the hot, sweaty hike and climb!  Tour bus picked us up close to our hotel in Waikiki.  Driver was great, cool personality and was our guide as well.  Very knowledgeable too.  Crowded at the top but everyone was polite."
156,"Nice uphill walk, but very crowded","Fantastic view, moderate level hike and I had open heart surgery 3 1/2 months ago!If i could do it anyone can!"
157,Great view and sunsets,"The whole park is very well maintained and clean. The hike up to the rim of the crater is quite exhausting and it's super hot but so worth it. The views you get are amazing. Make sure to wear proper shoes as the path is uneven. Don't forget sunscreen and lots of water, you'll need it."
158,Great hike,"The view from the top of Diamond Head is worth a million bucks, just come prepared. We went on a hot summers day and there isn’t a lot of shade on the walk up. My friend and I are both healthy and in shape so it wasn’t difficult for us. We can prepared with water, sun glasses, and SPF. Most people walk at a normal pace but people can pass on the side. There was a large crowd at the very top but we were able to get unbelievable pictures. There was a rescue helicopter when we came down. I wasn’t surprised though because it seemed like a lot of elderly people didn’t heed warnings about the difficulty for them. I was able to get shaved ice afterwards. Go early to beat the heat and the impossible parking situation!"
159,Go For The View From The Top,Loved the long hike up but the view was so very worth it. Climb is hard lots of stairs long paths going up we took our time rested when we got to spots with benches.  Loved the view.
160,A must see,"Full disclosure, the title ""Top of Honolulu"" is just something I came up with for this review, but based on the breathtaking 360 views available, I may not be to far off.The hike can be made by almost anyone, since it is paved all the way, as long as you pace yourself according to your fitness level. The views at the top are worth the trip.Test your fitness level by sprinting up the steep stairway at the very top, (see picture below) or take the more gradual route to the left.By the way, be careful as it gets quite windy up there. Hats and accessories may decide to travel independent of the owner😁Enjoy!"
161,Beautiful!,"This hike was a real challenge. From slippery rocky slopes, steep natural and manmade steps and a narrow tunnel-- I was tired. I would recommend you bring water, hiking shoes, rain jacket (cheap plastic ok), your camera and plan to take a few breaks. Once to the top, the views are incredible. It doesnt take long unless you take many breaks or bring kids. But it is worth it :)"
162,Great view at the top,"It is a very worthwhile hike to the top of the crater fro an excellent view of Waikiki and the Pacific Ocean.  Then when you get down, buy yourself a Dole Whip as a reward !"
163,Diamond Head Mountain Hike,"Dont let the unknown of this trail scare you. If children and elderly people made it up and down, so can you!"
164,Great hike with a view.,Wow great hike with a beautiful view at the top. Such a rush once you get to the top. Make sure you have plenty of water
165,Looks better when viewed from Waikiki Beach,Reason it’s the #1 attraction and fully justifies it. Breathtaking views all around once you get to top.The climb is bit steep and strenuous but not extremely challenging so can be done by most.Parking is limited - we went on a busy day and had to park in an off location and walk
166,"Okay Experience, but a Fantastic Workout!",If you’re with a hotel that offers a shuttle here definitely take it as if you get the bus it’s 2miles away. It’s a steep hike/walk up to the top but i would think it’s manageable for most people as it’s not a long distance & you can rest . Entrance is $1 & the hike to the top will probably take about an hour. Take water with you & wear trainers rather than flip flops as some terrain is rough. The views are absolutely awesome. You can see various views across the whole island. Do not miss.
167,Not for the unfit!,Fantastic walk which takes approximately 40 minutes up and 30 minutes down.You will get the best Waikiki view when it’s sunny day. So much fun climbing and seeing other tourists from all over the world.
168,Diamond Head State Monument,We hiked to the top of Diamondhead midmorning. Lots of people but not overly crowded. The view is unforgettably beautiful.
169,"Nice view, easy climb","Nice trail, LOT'S of steps at the end, but worth it. Great views. The top part was not as tight as some people said."
170,Breathtaking view,"Very crowded but that’s to be expected. Good workout to get to top but not overly difficult. Fun to go through various tunnels, up steep staircases and spiral staircase right before summit besides the usual hiking on pathways. Great views at the top. I took bus from Waikiki to soak up some local flavor and walked in instead of trying to find a parking place in crowded lot."
171,Very Scenic,"We didn’t arrive early so did not have the benefit of parking at the base.  Can find parking just before the tunnel but it does add more steps to the journey!Be prepared for crowds, uneven pavement, tight spaces and a long dark tunnel."
172,"Great, really enjoyed it.","Interesting place but nothing special, it’s good to drive in to it and check it out. I enjoyed the look out and view more than the place itself"
173,Great view from the top,"The walk / hike up the trail and steps to the top of Diamonhead was definitely worth the effort.  It is moderately strenuous, but not overly so.  The views are fantastic and well worth it!  Try not to drive, as parking near the trail head is limited.  On weekends it seems fine to park at the college near the park entrance but I am not sure about weekdays. There are bus routes that go there and it is also a short Uber / Lyft ride from Waikiki."
174,Lovely walk.,"The hike to the top was strenuous; however, the view from the top was beautiful and worth the hike. You could see most of Honolulu and Waikiki beach from the top. Make sure you are physically able to walk lots of stairs, uneven footing and narrow passages at an incline but the hike down was easy, lol."
175,Nice short hike,Oahu is 4 hours behind us so we woke up at 5 am on our first day. We jumped up and headed to Diamond Head to see the sunrise. Great walk. Guide books call it strenuous but it seemed moderate to me. The path is uneven so good shoes are needed but I think that walking sticks would have been in the way. Take it at your own pace and just step aside if people need to get around. It’s stunning to be there and watch the day break but any time would be nice. A few tips:  1) drive through the tunnel and into the park. Don’t stop at the first parking you see. 2) bring a flashlight if coming before dawn. 3) go left when coming out of the tunnel on the hike. The ascent is MUCH easier that way.
176,Great view,"In Oahu - for all the popular to dos, make sure you get there early! We arrived at 8am - to be met w/ traffic entering the park. Then told to wait in ""wait"" parking spot. Those behind us were turned back. The morning hike was wonderful.  Lots of shade even though it was already hot. Our whole hike was about 1hr 15mins, including photo ops, and checking out all the lookout spots. Apparently, there is an easier route than those stairs, but if you are there, you should take the stairs.. my daughter turned out earlier and so missed the stairs, so on the way back down, she saw the stairs and decided she would run up & come back down and she did. Now she can say she did the Diamond Head hike!  Great hike with Great views. Just very crowded. At the base, there is a gift shop and a truck selling pineapple drinks and fruits - very popular!  Take some great photos as the base as well! Quick pretty"
177,Challenging but worth the effect,"Walking up is hard work. When you get to last lot of yellow stairs, you can go the easy way and turn to your left. Otherwise it’s 100 very steep steps. Very crowded once you get to the top but views are amazing! Once your back down the climb have some fake dole whip(real stuff is at pineapple plantation) and fries. Catch the bus to the entrance at bottom of the hill, then walk rest of the way to inside the crater. 1 gift shop only and toilets There were people with little kids doing the walk. Take water"
178,BEAUTIFUL,I did this is in an hour going up and down and was bagged by the time I finished. BUt it was so rewarding once I got to the top. I saw a lot of people that were 70 plus and was very impressed that they could do it.
179,Must Do Honolulu,Nice hike and awesome view from the to. Pretty easy hike to the top. Didn't even break a sweat! A little crowded at the top but it is an attraction so.....
180,Couples,"I enjoy hiking and nice scenery, but would say I definitely prefer the magnificent view of the iconic Diamond Head from the beach at Waikiki to climbing up it and looking down from the top.  You can easily get there by The Bus (cheap too) but the info. we had neglected to mention you must transfer to a 2nd bus  and when you get off there's NO SIGNAGE directing you to the monument and trail head!  We got lucky and followed others who were guessing at the way to go.  When you see it up close it's disappointing too-looks not so impressive.  There is railing to hold onto luckily since the path was uneven mostly & slick from the rain so potentially dangerous.  It was early a.m. - cooler- but got busy & crowded quickly so you feel like you can't stop & enjoy tho you can move over to let others pass if you need a break. I liked the steep long stairs, but not the scary spiral staircase inside.  You can look down and see views of buildings , greenery & ocean, but I guess I wasn't as impressed by that as others.  There was a nice rainbow though. I felt I had to buy the charm proclaiming that "" I Hiked Diamond Head""  just as a memento.and proof. It only costs $1 to get in!In retrospect, I can see that by not reading the pamphlet you get at the ranger booth, I missed out on the meaning of it all-but if you stop to read, you get stuck in all the crowds following you!"
181,Great hike and great views,"We got here just after they opened, hiked in the dark to watch sunrise from the top.  I’d recommend good shoes, the path is very uneven and you may need to use the flashlight on your phone to see parts of the path.  Bring your water and maybe a snack.  To the top and back is about 2 hours.  Sunscreen is a must, especially for a daytime hike.  Once you leave the base of Diamond Head, there are no restrooms."
182,Great hiking spot for all levels,Thoroughly enjoyed our walk at Diamond Head. Very busy but a variety of fitness levels we’re tackling the trip - it is quite doable but wear the right shoes - and hold on to your hat up the top! Highly recommend this for great views.
183,Worth the walk,"Great hike, bring your own reusable water bottle and good walking shoes.  The view from everywhere on the trail is breathtaking, but the top is amazing.  We did not do a guided with headphones tour, maybe if we had I would have rated it a 5.  Once you started the trail you either had the provided map to look at to learn a little history or you just climbed and enjoyed the exercise and view. It is a must see, just be prepared for a strenuous hike and do your research before your hike.  We paid $5 for parking in the lot at the base of the trail and walked from there. You can take a bus or trolley for cheaper but don't get dropped off as close. Glad to check this off my bucket list and would do it again."
184,Diamond Head ,We hiked up Diamond Head early morning caught a great sunrise lots of fun recommend that time can get hot later in the day
185,excellent hike,"A must do when visiting Honolulu area!  Trail leading to the observation areas is constantly being maintained and improved.  Hats off to the park for keeping this trailhead open.  Some tips for the travel.Recommend wearing good trail shoes for added comfort and traction.  Looking for a special and exhilarating hike?  Do the sunrise experience.  For added comfort and security, bring a headband light to help with the trail during early morning darkness.Enjoy the journey and epic views!"
186,Worth the hike,Diamond Head is a great family experience. I would definitely recommend going early though. Parking is limited and can fill up very quickly. I would also recommend to take an umbrella with you as it is known to rain quite often. The earlier that you go the less crowded that it is. Definitely worth the hike up to the top because the view is amazing. Do make sure that you bring water as well to stay hydrated. This is definitely a must see attraction.
187,Nice views,Easy-moderate hike if you’re wearing appropriate footwear. Nice views. Can get pretty crowded on the narrow paths.
188,Hike to the top for a great view !,"Take the hike up Diamond head - as long as you are in good physical shape and can manage stairs, lots of stairs!  This hike is NOT stroller-friendly, so leave . it behind,  The views are wonderful, and worth the exercise.  We are 69 and 73 and made it just fine, but you must be in shape . and have water with you!  The tunnels are short enough and, if you keep to the middle,  you won't bump your head."
189,What a view,"While we had a fun excursion day, we walked from our hotel (which turned out to be quite a bit - deceptively - farther than anticipated). Still, we thoroughly enjoyed the hike and views."
190,Amazing views!!!,This was quite a trek ( about .8 miles each way at the summit) but well worth the view.    Bring a water bottle or buy one before you begin. Parking lot fills quickly so the earlier you go the better.
191,"Great hike, great views, worth the time","I think each time I have visited Oahu over the years I have done this walk, and each time I have loved it! This year I also got to take my kids, which was great. The views at the top are lovely, its a tradition we will continue!!"
192,23 years in between climbs!,"This State Park is extensive and however, easily overlooked because it is where you find the most iconic place of Honolulu: Diamond Head. You will find yourself at the Diamond Head State monument which marks the beginning of a trail to one of the most beautiful lookouts of Honolulu. The panoramic views are spectacular, and this is a must visit. Remember to check the weather even though it can change quickly in Hawaii. However, it is my advice to start your hike in the morning.  The hike itself includes some areas difficult for children and it will be better if you don't bring babies as well because there are parts which are very narrow and difficult to go by. Of all the experiences in Hawaii this one will be one you will never forget."
193,Beautiful view,"Diamond head is a nice hike, but it is very touristy. Be aware that at the look out point you have to climb steep stairs go through a tunnel and duck through a small entry at the top. If you have mobility issues be aware! Also make sure to bring water and do the hike early if you can. Fire trucks were sent and had to help a guy who got dehydrated at the top. It’s a nice walk if you walk from Waikiki up to the visitor center and then up the trail from there. Make sure you bring cash if you’re walking in! Expect it to be a bit crowded but nice for a close hike from Waikiki."
194,Enjoyable.,"Visiting this state park gives one the opportunity to see inside the crater of the iconic Diamond Head which most people only know from its iconic profile visible from Waikiki.  Parking is limited there and it was full when we visited on a Sunday morning, so we just drove back down and found some street parking in a residential area.  We did the hike to the summit and it's quite doable, especially if you take your time.  From the trailhead, it's .8 miles to the summit with a 560 ft. elevation gain.  The toughest part is the 99 steps up to the first level, so be ready for that.  The view is worth it; one can see all of Waikiki, the hills leading up to Pali, Koko Head to the south, and, of course, wonderful views of the ocean.  I have seen whales breaching from atop Diamond Head.  I have hiked it early for a sunrise viewing and was surprised at how crowded it was; apparently, it's a ""thing"" for some tourists."
195,"Gorgeous view, big walk up","Very busy, but the line kept moving and a good pace. You have to be in good shape as it’s very steep! My 88 yr old dad would’ve had to wait at the bottom and eaten pineapple whip. Best views of Waikiki beachfront. Very easy to get to- right off the bus route. You can be done in time for lunch."
196,Just do it!,"A massif volcanic crater ,if you have the time & are very fit , go up the top path 1 - 2 hours, in main parking area , only fruit / drinks sold , no cafe."
197,Amazing Views,Stunning scenery of the coast with a good hike!  Loved the view! Lots of people so parking is a problem!  But worth it!
198,Beautiful!,"Awsome view of Honolulu and the Pacific ocean. Parking is limited when getting inside diamond head volcano you may have to wait for 30 minutes or more until other vehicles leave. It's worth the wait and its a beautiful walk to the top  bring water, a hat and sun screen, and please wear good running shoes no sandles it can get rough for your feet. For those with health problems please take your time to walk up because it is a very high volcano to climb.  Bring a healthy snack for extra boost. And a bottle of water."
199,Best Vantage Point in Honolulu,"Good workout, great view.This is a must do activity in Honolulu. If you are older or not in the best of shape than just take your time. Let the kids pass by. Take breaks. You will be proud of yourself and you’ll get some great pictures. Have a pineapple whip when you finish!"
200,Great hike ,"Nice walk, awesome views. We did it in the afternoon which was a little cooler. Entry fee to part from inside the crater is $1pp."
201,Worth the walk!,Big crowds during the holidays but always a fun hike.  Couldn’t park in the crater lot so had to park in nearby lot and walk in.  Be sure and wear appropriate shoes with good soles.  Not a good idea to take young children unless you want to carry them.
202,Easy hike and nice view,"The trail is steep but fairly easy to navigate, although it can be crowded.  The views are great and useful info is provided. A must see."
203,"Easy enough hike, lovely view","Being it is only $1 to get into the part it is worth the climb to the top. The stairs are not too bad but the crazy tunnel with no oxygen is a bit freaky if you are not prepared. SUGGESTION, catch your breath before you enter the tunnel. It is a beautiful site to see though!"
204,Lots of stairs ,"We rode the Outrigger trolley to the entrance.  Got there about 10:30.  Bring a water and wear athletic shoes because the trail quickly gets rocky. The climb took about 40 minutes because of stopping to take pictures. The hardest part was the 99 step staircase.  No place to stop once you begin.  Going left out of the tunnel also gets you to the summit, easier but longer.  The view at the top is worth the effort.  Much easier going back down."
205,Not enough parking,Great hike which is busier the later it gets. If possible get there at 8am. Suns not high and the temperatures are not high. Parking is available in the crater but limited. I have seen people double park outside of the crater entrance but be prepared to get a ticket from the police who actively patrol the area. Entrance to the park is $1.00 per person walking in or $5.00 by car. Enjoy the easy hike and the views that is offered at this location!
206,Midday walk,walking the diamond head is a must-do when visiting Waikiki. You can easily walk on your own and do nto need to book an agency to guide you. An uber takes you to the start in 10-15 minutes from the city and the walk is easy. you must have 1 dollar in cash to enter the park.
207,"Great hike, with beautiful view","This is not an easy hike. Take water. Pace yourself.  Take your camera! Don’t worry about letting the quicker hikers to go around you, just pull to the side and let them go. You will all get bottlenecked at the 99 steps anyway!  Up the 99 steps and you will go through an old WW2 bunker. At the base of the 99 steps (straight up metal staircase) you can pull off to the left side. There are views there plus you can rest. If you don’t mind missing the bunker you can use this route to see the top (but you will be going against the crowd flow). This side offers wider stairs. Do the hike!  Then buy the hat or t-shirt that reads “I hiked up Diamond Head!”  This is a don’t miss for me!"
208,"Super Hike, Commanding Views at the Top",Great walk and only USD$1! About a 1 hour round trip if fit. Cool bunkers and amazing views. What more can I say!
209,Great view,"If you don’t like climbing a hill, than this is not for you. Otherwise, I loved it, and so rewarding at the end (when I got to the top). Enjoy!"
210,An easy walk and a must do,Got a taxi to the entrance of the car park...then made the easy walk up to the peak in about 30 minutes with stops. You only need sand shoes .. certainly not tracking boots. This is a must do if you have more than one day in Honolulu.
211,Beautiful location,This is an easy hike and family friendly.   There is section with short tunnel which the kids love.   The trail is safe and easy to navigate.  This can get busy so plan to avoid the middle part of the day.
212,Worthwhile...,Stopped on the green line trolley. Was an amazing view. Trolley driver let us feed the native birds. Wish I was young enough to have done the hike up.
213,Great Hike,Easy to moderate hike-- beautiful views.  There are two ways to go and one included multiple steps.  The other is longer but has ramps.  There is a food truck at the base.  The Acia Fruit Bowl is great to share after finishing your hike.
214,Top of the world,"This is a must see experience to appreciate American fallen soliders in WWII, burned and buried undersea. ."
215,Amazing view ,"Great views.  Walk/climb is not particularly strenuous if you have a basic level of fitness.  The path can be slippery/rough underfoot - kudos to the visually impaired walker and his guise on the day we visited.Summit was crowded but walkers happily taking turns - I imagine it can get very busy in summer - we visited in January.Refreshing pineapple juice available at stall after the walk.Getting an Uber back to city proved challenging - couldn't get a usable signal within the crater, so took the short walk out through the tunnel where signal came good."
216,Great views and fun hike,"Take the time to hike to the top of Diamond Head. It's a tough climb, especially in the sun, but the view from the top is worth it. There are steep paths and stairs, so don't wear flip-flops! After a satisfying hike pick up some cold, refreshing pineapple spears before heading back to your motel."
217,Amazing view ,Beautiful views of Waikiki beach along the drive up to Diamond Head. We enjoyed the drive as much as the destination.
218,Hike to top,"this is definetly a place you need to go first thing in the morning. the parking is minmum. me and my wife tried to go about 730, and the lot was full, and the over flo lot outside the tunnel wws full also. so we had to park down the hill. and do a hike just to get to the hike..lol. walkin in entrance is 1 dollar a person.  before you began the hike make sure to use the bathroom . there is only 1. and it is at the bottom of the hike. make sure you wear proper shoes. the terrain is not stable going up or down. and the walk space is tight with hikers going up and coming down at the same time. there are places on the way up to take excellent photos.  overall this was an amazing hike with wonderful scenery with people from all over taking advantage of nature."
219,"Gorgeous view, easy walk but crowded","DH Monument is a great place to get great views and see interesting wildlife. Sadly, it seems there are some  who like to use the Diamond Head (DH) monument as a personal training ground.While there with my small children, we were bustled and jostled more than 3 times by folks who are running up and down the trail!!While usually great for families , when these trail hogs are going up (or down) and passing everyone the trail begins to verge on dangerous. I would love to see trail masters or someone visible who can control the site."
220,Great hike!,Good walk  but wear very comfortable shoes. Do it early. Strenuous walk up hill. The views are magnificent. A must do for all.
221,Good hike for some awesome sights,"Worth the hike up, plenty of spots to stop and take photos. Spectacular views.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Very clean!"
222,Great Challenge for Seniors,To not visit Diamond Head when in Honolulu is unthinkable.  To fail to do the hike to the summit is a shame.  The hike is medium to energetic but if one takes their time it can be done by most.  Howe
223,Great View,"This is one of the super touristy places so it was packed. We parked down the road at a park and walked all the way up. It was a beautiful lookout, a bit of a hard hike at times, and a great experience."
224,Great View of the island,"Take a hat, runners, sunscreen & plenty of water & be prepared for wonderful views. Explore the bunker at the top. Have a full battery for your camera."
225,Worth the hike,Go early to beat the heat and the crowds both on the trail and in the parking lot.  It is worth the effort.
226,Go for sunrise,We parked at the community college at the bottom of Diamond Head for free and walked up to Diamond Head around sunrise 6:30am. It cost $1 a person to walk in and $5 for a vehicle to park (if there is room). There is a small snack truck with pineapple for $4. The gift shop and a narrated guide for the trail. It is only 1.6 miles round trip. You get to come out if a Bunker.
227,Take the hike!,"If you visit Oahu, you must go to Diamond Head, hike/walk to the top, and get a snack at the truck. There are parts of the trail that are muddy or steep and there are lots of stairs, but there are also handrails for almost all of the trail and lots of places to sit and rest along the way. Also along the way are many amazing views, but the best is obviously from the very top. There are some info stations at the start of the trail in the crater and there's also a little gift shop and bathrooms and a water fountain. However, the best thing at the trailhead is the snack truck that has shave ice, pineapple whips, mango whips, and smoothies that are amazing!"
228,Mid January 2014 not bust at all,"Track in the most is good, well worth the visit and walk up. Can get packed and is a bit uneven. Only cost $1 too which dont mind as goes towards maintenance."
229,Awesome Hike,"We visited in early May so it was't peak season, but still pretty busy. Parking was very busy, but you have two options. The first is to park outside of Diamond Head which is faster, but will add to your distance. The second option is to simply wait. Thankfully, there are parking lot attendants who assist with parking on a first-come-first-serve basis, so it takes the stress out of it. If you visit and there's a line, please don't try cutting - if the line isn't moving, it isn't moving for a reason. Stay in line and you'll get your turn!The hike itself was a good workout - especially on a hot day. Once you get on the trail, there are no restrooms, no water, and very little to no cover so be prepared. The trail is pretty steep in some places and there are a LOT of stairs to climb. The path is also uneven in some areas - not made for those with limited mobility, little legs, or strollers.Important info for anyone who's claustrophobic: There is a dimly-lit tunnel near the top. It's fairly narrow. Most people won't care, but I wish I'd known beforehand. Thankfully, the line kept moving so we got through it pretty quickly, but it's fairly cramped so you can't easily zip ahead of those in front of you. It was crowded near the top, but the views were great. We snapped plenty of pictures. The descent moved much quicker, of course, and we rewarded ourselves with an icy treat at the bottom.I'm glad we were able to make time for this stop and am happy to say we've been here, but I'm not sure it bears a repeat visit, and I consider it to be more of a time filler - not a main event."
230,Great walk,"This hike not only offers some of the most spectacular views of Honolulu but it also gives you an opportunity to check out a pretty old crater. We climbed all the way to the top to get the 360 degree perspective and a good cardio workout for just a $1.😝🤩👌Depending on your fitness level, it's a fairly easy hike, totally doable. It does get a little hard at the top though but If you're up for a challenge, take the steep steps to your left👈, if you need an easy peezy, less strenuous way to the top, go to your right👉. It took us about an hour return trip with a few photo stops at the beautiful vantage points. Do make sure to wear comfortable clothes and shoes as it can get very hot and sweaty. Take a hat, sunnies, water bottles and dont be lazy to apply sunscreen - 'Slip, slop, slap and wrap' 😂 as the sun🌞 just hits you like a ton of hot bricks.🔥🔥Coming down the track was great fun and once we were down we treated ourselves to some sweet coconut🥥 water at the food🍔 and pineapple🍍 truck that strategically stands at the entrance. You will also find a little souvenir shop near the food truck if you fancy carrying some home.Absolutely a must do hike as the stunning views from the top makes the climb totally worthwhile and enjoyable.❤⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
231,Worth it!,"Great way to start the day! Was a little rainy, but the view from the top was worth it. Yes, it was a “paved” hike, but it certainly was uneven and rugged. This wasn’t a walk along a boardwalk. Too many narrow steps to count and a couple of tight squeezes. Saw some whales jumping and a beautiful view from the top."
232,Perfect first day on Oahu,"Great view and good exercise, gotta go! It is not difficult, not too hot either, you will love it, there are tunnel you need to get through even on the way to the top.  Not crowed if you enter the park before it closes at 4:30pm, an hour and half is good enough."
233,A must do when visiting Waikiki,"The climb is moderately easy. Be sure to wear good athletic shoes.  Stop to enjoy the scenery on the way up. There are some beautiful views. And the view from the top is definitely worth the climb!  And, the Dole Whip at the bottom was amazing!!"
234,Great hike,"Be ready to experience people. A lot of people. Don’t think being there when it opens at 6:00 am for a sunrise hike will help avoid people. However, it does make it easier to find a parking spot. If you like the serenity of hikes in nature, this is probably not the hike for you. If you are fit and like to run, hike or exercise, you can easily make it up in 30 minutes. Even with the lines of people (if you’re not afraid to squeeze by them politely). They like small bills for entrance fee."
235,Always busy,This is the time of year to go! SPECTACULAR VIEWS! Wear comfy walking shoes and SUNBLOCK IS ALWAYS A MUST a nice breeze at that elevation will fool you into thinking it’s not necessary but it is!
236,Climb-worthy View,Looking at Diamond Head from ground level is beautiful- especially if there on Friday’s when a hotel does fireworks at 8pm. Climbing up the stairs to the top leads to an awesome view. Yes the stairs are steep. Make sure you take water. Great experience. We’ve done a number of times.
237,Epic experience and views ,What can you say except spectacular? The view is unbelievable. Easy to access. Definitely a must sight
238,Great hike with great views,Great way to see the view from the top of Diamond Head. For only 1 dollar a great cardio workout to the top
239,A nice hike straight up!,"Good hike, trail is busy and very narrow in some parts, lots of tourists be prepared to be patient.   It was raining during our visit so trail was slick and many puddles that you had to go around.  Saw several people slip on the wet rocks/mud.  1.00 to enter park, per person."
240,A very popular tourist spot,"What a view. Bit more of a hike than expected. A lot of warning about stairs but not so much about the long and winding trail. Well maintained though, and some interesting military history as well!"
241,Awesome viewpoint,The top of Diamond Head offers some of the best panoramic views of Waikiki. The hike is a moderate uphill climb on paths that range from good to fairly poor. The path is often crowded during peak hours so expect to be patient with folks of different fitness levels. The gun emplacements at the top carry you back to a different time when the threat of war and invasion was very real. This is one of the most affordable family activities on the island. Clean restrooms and snacks are available at the base of the trailhead.
242,A Nice Hike and Beautiful View,"It only costs $1 admission which is very nice of them considering they could probably make a good amount of money on it. The hike was moderate and beautiful views, even if it is a slight struggle, if you can do it I suggest going all the way! Highly suggested!"
243,Magnificent view ,"Beautiful place. You can take the trolley to get there or the bus/Uber.  Take water, sunscreen and hat. Be prepared for crowds!"
244,Bucket list hike,"When the nice guy I was renting my airbnb from said do it. You can make it  to the top. Take your time and move to the side when you need to rest. It probably took me longer than most. Just  turned  63. Had a little problem catching my breath at times. But, made it to the top. And its Remarkable. So beautiful. You have to go. Take your time its worth it."
245,Diamond Head Hike,Get a tram or a bus to take you because there is so little parking. And it is cash only into the park itself. We were able to snag a spot after waiting maybe 20 minutes. The hike is very strenuous to the top so be mindful of that but you can go to different points and not go all the way to the top
246,Worth the hike and crowds,"Two adults visited here on a Friday midday in early February and had a great visit. Spent about three plus hours total.Rented the audio tours for $4 each. Well worth it. Informative tour. You also get an ""I climbed Diamond Head"" certificate with the audio tour.Hike up is not extremely difficult if you take your time. Not ADA accessible. Only complaint is that it was packed with people at the top. Barely room to move around and see the views. So many people taking selfies….Concession stand and restrooms at the bottom. Nothing available on the way up or down."
247,Hiked to the top to watch sunrise,"Worth the climb. If you have time, I highly recommend this hike. It is best to go as early as possible in the morning - I ended up going around 7am to beat the crowd. After 8am-9am it gets pretty packed at the top."
248,Go Early,"great view, fast to get up to the top.  Lots of people. Very crowded at the top. Not much room to take pictures. People are climbing over railings to access non permitted areas. Doesn't see to safe when they do"
249,Nice walk and great view!,"This 1.8 mile round trip hike gains 452 feet and has various lookout points offering sublime 360-degree views of Honolulu and the East Side. However, it is the view from the summit that is the most rewarding – a nearly unobstructed view of the Waikiki Beach coastline and its endless collection of high rises. Check out the Hawaii blog in my bio for planning your next trip!"
250,Diamond head hike,"I was super excited about visiting this place for an early morning sunrise with my wife while on a work-vacation.  Apparently, everyone else thought the same thing!When we arrive at what is still a dark and 30 mins before the park opened, we were already at the back of the line to get in.  HOARDS of people there for the opening of the gate which made the ""hike"" (it really a bad walk on poorly constructed ""sidewalk"") very congested.We literally got about 50 feet from the top before we had to stop because of all the people!  Pretty sunset and cool view from top, but there are MUCH better and enjoyable things to do on this island alone than spend too much time here"
251,Must-do when on Oahu,Tips for making this hike:1. Bring water or buy some at the vending machine or at the food Truck (both are located after the parking lot) before hitting the trail2. Try to avoid mid-day when the sun is at its peak. There is not much shade on the trail 3. Wear sturdy footwear and/or sneakers as the ground is rocky/unleveled on most of the trail 4. Take the stairs it’s quicker and shaded from the sun5. Enjoy the view
252,Old man’s challenge to himself,"We were here in January and the rainy season came early.  We had a rental car for the day and first arrived in the morning but it was jam packed with cars; the wait for parking would have been long.  So we passed and went on our rest of the day tour of the island. Toward the end of the day, we decided to give this place another try; to our surprise, there was plenty of parking and they weren't even charging to park, but we would have to hurry before they closed. The hike was much harder than I expected; not so much for our energetic 18 year old grandson. He kept slowing down/waiting for us.  The view from the top does not include the actual Diamond Head crater, which was disappointing, but the views of the island were great.  With the rainy season comes the rainbows. On the way down, I slipped on a wet area but luckily was holding onto the rail and just wrenched my shoulder a little, but better than falling. Wear good quality shoes!  I was but still slipped in the steeper wet areas."
253,Crowded great view,Limited parking area and numerous cars were waiting for someone to leave so they could park.  Couldn’t even see the visitors center without waiting to park. Very disappointed.
254,Wonderful hike to watch a sunrise,"Must do sunset hike. $5 to park, and then 35-45 min hike, overlooking Waikiki beach. Park indicates it closes at 6pm, but gates don’t close until 6:20pm."
255,"Excellent, hike was steep but safe. View was incredible",I wish I could give an awesome review of the gorgeous view but all I seen was the parking lot and the two ladies working the entrance screaming at everyone. As someone who has lived here for 13 years I was  embarrassed that this is what my visiting family experienced. First can you invest in some upgrades and expand the parking. Second 6 people were rescued that day because it was overran by hikers shoulder to shoulder on the hike. This is way too many people at once with different skill levels hiking. There needs to be some order to the chaos. My family returned today to drive instead of hike and have been in line for two hours.   Hawai’i can you please spend some of the state money to make this an enjoyable experience and hire people that have people skills?  Also you pretend to care about the environment but having that many people descend on that daily is damaging it. There should be a ticket sale with a time for so may you people with a hiking guide.
256,Good hike ,Great view but a long walk from car park.Was a hot and busy day but the views are just amazing went you get there
257,Challenging walk amongst lots of people,Great way to spend a couple of hours off the beach in Waikiki. The hike of the volcano crater not only is a good morning exercise but is rewarded at the summit by spectacular views of beautiful Oahu that are not to be missed.
258,360 degree view,Get ready for a long walk that well worth the journey to view the breathtaking scenery. Comfortable shoes and water are a must. The natural beauty is just amazing. The views from every direction as you reach the top are awesome.
259,a must see spot!,"Go in the morning, the earlier the better, it gets hot and crowded.  Wear comfortable walking shoes, it is definitely not an easy walk but manageable for most.  Take water, however there is a shop that sells drinks and shaved ice.  The walk is definitely worth the view from the top.We caught an Uber there from Waikiki and paid $1 per person to entry. We struggled to get service on our mobiles to book an Uber for our return, however I spoke to a driver who was dropping off and offered him cash for our return trip which he accepted."
260,Breathtaking Views,"We were rewarded with a 360 degree view of the city, the sea, and the mountains. But to get there, a hike of different effort levels are needed. There are several viewing or lookout points that can serve as a rest stop to catch a breath. There is even 1 where there is a winch that shows how they are able to bring things up/down instead of lugging it up through the hiking trail.At the last stop, we had the option of the easier but longer route or the straight, 100 steps/stairs up plus a spiral staircase into the bunker area. Your choice. At the bunker area, we needed to slouch through an opening to get into what is best described as a balcony. Then the viewing deck area."
261,"Beautiful views, easy hike",The panoramic views of the coastline are magnificent.  Not a traditional hike because of the paved walkway but definitely worth it.  Good for families and people of all ages.  It's good exercise and worth the investment of time.  The trip was memorable and enjoyable for our family.
262,Awesome hike up the trail,Great hike up the trail. It takes about 1 to 2 hours round trip. There is a cost of $1 per person and $5 per vehicle to enter but the walk is good and the view is nice. The walk is not too steep but can be bumpy for those who aren’t steady on their feet.
263,Diamond Head Hike,"Worth the effort, nice view but very crowded. Am 60 yrs young and had no problem but was not a hot day so would expect people a little older in the heat to not enjoy it as much."
264,Ideal visit time & practice trail etiquette,"Great state park, well maintained and well run. Good concessions, good restroom, and good rules to prevent littering. Beautiful area and then great hike up well-done path and steps. You should be wearing tennis shoes, casual hiking clothing, with water and suntan lotion in daypack. Incredible view of crater on top and viewing spots along the way—as well as incredible views of the ocean and Waikiki.  Plan on at least 2hours to hike, enjoy, take pictures, relax with a pineapple whip."
265,Diamond Head,What better way to experience a birds eye view of a truly beautiful place? It was much more phenomenal in person
266,"""Diamond Head Trail""","Lovely views on the way up and at the top. It’s a bit of work but worth it.  Plenty of spots to pause for a moment if you need to. We did it in the morning, which was good. I don’t think it would be as much fun in afternoon heat. Took an Uber there from Waikiki and walked back, about 2.5 miles, from the park entrance. Easy walk coming back, downhill then flat. Just get up in the morning and do it!"
267,Great Hike!,$1 (cash only) pedestrian entry fee ($5 per vehicle) is well worth it for this walk that provides amazing views. Definitely recommend!
268,Always a great view,"There were so many people here that the going was slow, but the rainbow view we got made it all worthwhile."
269,A great hike with awesome sights,"Got there at 6am. Hiked to the pillbox and watched sunrise.  Bring some light, there are no lights on the path. About halfway up, the path gets uneven and it's easy to misstep.  A great way to kick off our 10 days in Hawaii"
270,To the top of Diamond Head,Great place to get some exercise and see the surrounding area from the point.  The park is well maintained and the entrance fee is very little.  A city bus takes you to and from there if you don't want to taxi or Uber.  We are in our late 60's and were able to get to the top without difficulty--although a lot slower than some!
271,"Amazing Views, Go early",Not for the eldery or infirm. Wear a pair of sneakers; not fashion victim shoes. The ground is flat at the beginning but becomes quite uneven. The stairs are steep and more difficult to navigate on the way down. Forget strollers. Children under the age of 7 will struggle.The ‘hike’ is worth it. The views are beautiful when you get to the top. Go early  to avoid the crowds. We walked back to Waikiki with our kids.
272,Must try,"When you're up early on your first couple days to Hawaii, get out and go for a hike or even just a walk through the park."
273,Fantastic views,"If shopping is not your thing then head out on the public bus to Diamond Head Crater.  Only a few $ entry, long, steep, quite difficult hilly walk up the crater, rewards you with spectacular views over Waikiki."
274,Good hiking trail ,Definitely a place to visit. The view is amazing. Try go earlier in the morning to avoid the crowd. About a 45 min hike. Highly recommend.
275,"VALUE ADDED: Helluva Hike (and, I am a gymgoer)","A lot of visitors, lot of lines. Small parking area. Take liquids with You. I would not recommend for small kids are people with leg issues."
276,Breathtaking view after a nice upward hike,"My tips for doing Diamond Head would be arrive early before 9 am: the parking lot fills up quickly as this is a very popular tourist destination, wear proper footwear and bring water.  There are lots of stairs so if you mobility issues this may not be a place for you or young children.  Diamond Head offers amazing 360 views!"
277,Too busy,"It was a hot day by Hawaiian standards but plenty of shade, a breeze, good exercise and a thrilling view while absorbing a fascinating history lesson."
278,Best  hike ever,"Walked from Ritz Carlton to the park, hiked up the hill to the lookout and back to the hotel.  Over 8 miles, but a wonderful experience.  Lots of visitors so a bit crowded.  However, it was great walking up the hill and the multitude of steps were challenging for this 70 year old.  However, much easier than those I saw wearing shoes meant for the walk down Grand Hawaiian Blvd.  The views from the different lookouts and the bunker were marvelous."
279,A must do for Oahu!,"Really great experience on Diamond Head.  If driving, I would get their earlier around 8 at the latest during the busy seasons as the parking lot and park fills up quickly.  The hike is paved or has gravel/steps.  Not sure how this would be if wet, though, but dry is very straight forward.  We spent a lot of time taking pictures and we were in and out at right at 90 minutes."
280,Nice but crowded hike,We were turned away because of the limited amount of parking - it could be a LOT more accommodating for tourists - not really sure what we missed out on
281,Wow... what a view,"Was unable to hike due to back issues but my wife, son, and two grandkids did and they loved it. The views from the top of the crater were awesome."
282,Love this hike!,"There are two ways to get to the top. If you do not want to go up stairs, take the other route. If you're up for a challenge, take the stairs! There are alot of people so get there early if you want parking. We had to park at KCC and then walk to Diamond Head. There is food truck in the parking lot if you get hungry afterwards or need dole whip icecream to cool down."
283,A hard slog but worth it,Great place to go for a morning walk before it gets too hot.  Wear sturdy shoes.  Bring a water bottle and snacks and a camera!  Great views.  Bring a flash light for the tunnels if you are not real comfy in the dark.  Places to buy drinks or a snacks in the parking lot.  Easy to get to off a public bus.  Places to sit in the shade and eat or rest before heading on to your next adventure.
284,Amazing view ,"This adventure was taken with a full on workout in mind;  I did it in flipflops and made it to the top of those many many many make shift stairs in 20 minutes.  The climb for the average person would probably seem grueling bothersome and not worth the trouble, but low and behold once you make it to the summit you are rewarded with the most fantastic views that will surely be one of the most lasting memories of your entire vacation!With all of that said, I would highly recommend gym shoes for the safety and overall comfort of the climb.  Go for it!Enjoy and have a safe blessed adventure."
285,Fun and beautiful,"Lovely hike, lots of stairs, take your time and rest when needed and don’t worry about what others think of you! The way up:- it took us about 30 minutes, which included 2-3 short rest stops along the way.- The tunnel is about 3/4th’s of the way up. There is a large set of stairs right before the tunnel and once you exit the tunnel, you have a “T” in the road. Here you can take an immediate right and go up another steep flight of stairs, or you can go to the left and take the switchback route, which has less steep stairs, but still has a few sets of stairs before you reach the top. You will be huffing and puffing at this point, so take whichever way suits your heart! Things to bring - small backpack, bottled water, sunscreen, phone with camera, comfy shoes suitable for a hike. You will encounter puddles of mud along the way if it’s raining and also slick surfaces, so shoes with good traction is a must!"
286,Climb a dormant Volcano to stretch your legs,I just recently took my granddaughter here early in the morning and we both enjoyed the cool breezy trade winds. When we got to the top my granddaughter enjoyed the beautiful view of the beach and Waikiki.
287,fun hike,"Cool place with too many people and cars,but worth the wait. Early  is the best for this event. you drive thru a bored out mountian while gaining acess to this beatiful momument."
288,A Great Hike,What a great view and challenge for the less physically enhanced.  But a view well worth.  Take your time and enjoy the uphill as much as the downhill trek.
289,Great hike and fantastic views,"Wear some good hiking shoes and make sure to walk at your own pace, so you will be able to enjoy the rewarding view at the top."
290,"Great walk, Worth the Effort","If you just flew in - and you spent the better part of the day on a plane - then make this hike the first thing you do.  If you are staying in Waikiki it’s a 2.5 mile walk into the crater - then perhaps another 1.5 miles or so (steep but walkable with good shoes) to the top.  Lots of railings but I would NOT want to be carrying a child to the top unless you are in really good shape.  Some people had tour guides - we didn’t.  Didn’t find it necessary.  There is a bathroom at the bottom - and a place to buy a coconut or pineapple drink.  The views are fantastic.  Elderly and “less exercised” people were struggling but many of them made it to the top eventually.  Being casual runners we followed a few other folks and passed lots of people along the way - probably took 35 minutes from the trail head.  It’s very crowded on holiday weeks (that’s when we were there) so go early.  You’ll be annoyed if it’s so crowded you can’t pass (unless you just like turning a 90 minute hike into a 3 hour one).  We walked from our hotel in Waikiki- and Ubered back.  I don’t recommend ubering all the way into the crater if it’s busy - just get dropped off and picked up at the entrance to the park.  There’s lots of other ways to get there too including trolly... Great trip, great views, and great way to stretch your legs."
291,Diamond Head,"This is a popular place, for a reason, during the wee hours of the morning.  There is a mass of people that make their way up the mountain to see a beautiful sunrise and some of the best views on the island.  See my pics which show it better than I can describe.You need to wear comfortable shoes because even though the path is paved it is step and some spots are not even."
292,Perfect vista!,"Take TheBus and arrive at entrance on  Diamond Head road. We took #2 from Waikiki.  If you drive, there are free parking areas along this road.  The lot inside the Park is small and fills up fast; not worth trying this. Plan to arrive just at or a few minutes before sunrise.  You will miss the sunrise view from the rim but then, do you really want to hike up in the dark and then huddle with a few hundred people at the rim lookout awaiting this?  The best part about doing it this way is that the ascent will be wide open as you will be hiking against the flow of traffic as the hordes will be descending after viewing the sunrise.  From bus stop to summit was about half hour, maintaining a steady brisk pace.  15 mins or so at summit to soak in the view.  Another half hour to descend.  Total +/- 1 1/2 hours.Any other time and you contend with the following. 1. Hordes of humanity; the trail is single file up or down so it gets congested.  2.  Single file means no passing lane; this trail is popular with tourists who may not have appropriate footwear, the many Japanese octogenarians, or any reason that slows the pace.  3.  Heat and blistering sun; there is no shade through most of the hike. 4. Hopeful sunset viewing - even in winter, the sun does fully set until 6 pm, so a partial view at most before sprinting down the path and exiting before the gates lock at 6 pm.What to wear:  t-shirt and shorts if the temperature when you begin is 74 F.  Layering if cooler or if your pace is slower and you need some extra insulation."
293,Worth the climb,Spectacular view of the island. A quick tour is sufficient to enjoy the beautiful scenic view of Diamond Head.
294,Worth the hike to see the view!,"Came up from Texas for Spring Break, and spent 3 nights in Honolulu and 4 nights in Kauai. With limited time in Honolulu, we wanted to hit the major sites. We actually walked from our hotel in Waikiki to Diamond Head, which was about 3 to 4 miles one way. It was a beautiful walk along the coast with sights of remarkable seaside homes and a lighthouse. Once we got o Diamond Head, you pay a small entrance fee to walk up to the top. It wasn’t a very difficult walk if you are in decent shape. Along the way there are many opportunities to take pictures and capture nice views of the island. Once on top, you can get breathtaking views of the Ocean and Waikiki Beach. I would have to say that this is a must see and do site to experience."
295,Worth the hike,"We went with our 7&5 year old! Wear comfortable shoes, sunblock and lots of water. Its perfectly fine to take young kids, I was worried at first but it was all worth it since they enjoyed it."
296,Worth the climb!,"A year ago I had full knee replacement surgery and didn't expect to make it all the way up to the top. However, thanks to the guardrail that runs all the way up I was able to do the whole thing! It took several hours but the climb is very doable, and very well maintained. There are a lot of rest spots along the way. It's wide enough for passing so I didn't hold anyone up. Lots of water is a must and we made the mistake of going mid-morning rather than early morning. It gets very hot! The bunkers on the top were a pleasant surprise and the view is spectacular. Tip: near the top the path splits into 2 climbing options, the more challenging inside bunker stairs and the easier gradual outside stairs."
297,Fantastic Hike,"Beautiful trek and views, met lots of people, clean, safe. Les crowded in the morning! Would probably go again if I went back"
298,Must visit,"Climbed up Diamond Head on New Year's Eve to watch the final sunrise of the year.  Was not disappointed.  The gates open up at 6 a.m., however by 6:25 the parking lot was full, so be prepared to get their early or park further away and walk more."
299,Go early ,"Please don't visit Waikiki, or Oahu for that matter, and not make the effort to walk up Diamond Head.  I can't imagine anyone could be disappointed in the experience.  It may be busy, with a bit of a crowd at the top, but just take it at a relaxed pace and stop to enjoy the many scenic viewing spots.  A selfie at the top with Waikiki in the background is a great memento.  You will see small children, elderly couples, people in wildly inappropriate clothes (think formal wear) and shoes (jandals - don't go there) but I suggest standard walking or sporty gear and running / walking shoes for comfort.  Take some water, it gets hot, and early morning/late afternoon are probably best to avoid the heat of the day.  An uber to the base from Aston at the Banyan was $9 and we walked all the way down and back via Monserrat which is an easy all downhill walk.  You could walk from Waikiki there are back if you are fit."
