0,I love this cartoon,"In my childhood I loved this cartoon - Kitten from Lizyukov street.  I watched it numerous times.  My friends in Voronezh let me know about this monument.  I understood that I couldn't miss it.  The monument is not in downtown Voronezh.  So I took a taxi to get there.  It was late at night, so I just got there, took pictures and left.…"
1,Kitten,"Simply small cat from the Russian (could be Soviet) cartoon. Can’t say that it is something special, but see once - why not? "
2,Такой классный котик - но фиг найдёшь. Such a gorgeous kitten - but hard to find.,"Nice to have a photo taken with the famous sculpture.  It sits just outside the ""club"" Kolisei.  It is one of 2, I believe, in the city, though this is the one most often found on fridge magnets."
3,Good,Nice funny monument not in the center of Voronezh.  If you want to see typical Russian/Soviet city district - look around when you are near that monument - this is what Russia looks like literally everywhre from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok.
4,Sweet and cheerful cat,"How anyone can rate “Kitten from Lizyukov” as the #1 attraction in Voronezh is beyond me   Go see Central Park - beautiful, peaceful with chimed in music"
5,Funny sculpture in residential area of Voronezh,Nice cat and everybody has to touch his moustache. That's why we saw one only hair attached. Local people like it and for foreign tourists it is interesting to see neighborhood and the cat with crow of course
6,Photo op,"Russia is very large, and not all of its residents are familiar with Voronezh, but almost everyone knows the funny cartoon ""Kitten from Lizyukov Street."" This monument is an almost unofficial symbol of Voronezh. It is considered in some way indecent to visit Voronezh and not make a photo with a monument to Kitten, yes, and touch his mustache for good luck!  We often go to Africa, Australia, Brazil Usually by airplanes And less often on water But if you are a kitten, And your name is Vasily That's better than Voronezh There is no city anywhere!  There are no hippopotamuses, Monkey and reptile And even just a hedgehog You will not see everywhere But still for the kitten, And your name is Vasily Better than Voronezh There is no city anywhere!…"
7,nice funny monument,"Просто обыскались этого котяру! Заплутали на улице Лизюкова, кружили-кружили и даже местные не сразу смогли подсказать, где он. А памятник-то оказался совсем небольшим и страшно милым. Недаром его многие называют визитной карточкой Воронежа. Есть в нём что-то из мультяшки. Прелесть!  We spent loads of time searching for this kitty. Lost our way in the Luzyukova street where even some locals were not in a position to show where that monument was. When discovered it appeared to be rather small and terribly nice. Admiring it we understood why many deem it a symbol of the city. A charming dude as if from a cartoon from your youth. A must-see when in Voronezh.…"
