0,Great experience,"I took the ferry from Key West to do the day trip over. The crossing is about 2 hours and ours was a bit rough. However it was completely worth it! Dry Tortugas is absolutely beautiful. It was raining when we arrived so I did the extended tour of the fort. Hollywood is an excellent tour guide and I found the tour to be fascinating.  The weather broke just as the tour was finished, I went to have lunch which was good ( they do have a vegetarian option). After lunch the sun came out so we were able to go swim and snorkel after all. The snorkeling was murky due to the rainstorms which was disappointing, but might be a reason to go back. All in all I would highly recommend this experience."
1,A great (all day) outing,"We took the American Freedom III ferry from Key West to Dry Tortugas - 2.5 hours each way. Boat is nice but if you get motion sick be prepared for popup storms. This is an amazing historic site - antebellum (1840s) fort that is HUGE! Great views from the top of the wall. The ferry crew give a great tour! Snorkeling is fun and there are lots of fish even in shallower waters. But if you can, swim to buoys, better coral out there. The water quality changes - our first day couldn’t see past our hands. Second day we could see 5-7 feet, third day 20+ all the way to bottom of coaling dock piers. Cross your fingers for clear water. We camped two nights, nice - especially Sunday night when much quieter without the party boaters. Recommend camping Sunday through Tuesday for less overnight population. Yes, rats are there - so definitely pack with solid cooler etc. Best advice is take an air mattress- ground in camping area is very compacted, like concrete. Otherwise a great location, beautiful sunrises and sunsets, a place to truly “unplug.”"
2,Real speechless paradise,"Fort Jefferson was a bucket list trip to Key West.  Checked this one off the list.  Went by ferry for the day and was worth every penny.  Snorkeling, swimming in aqua blue water and exploring the fort is what you do for the day.  Amazing views is all we can say."
3,Anticipation greater than realization.,"We took the ferry, Yankee Freedom III, to the Dry Tortugas. It’s was about a 2.5 hour trip both ways. They include a light breakfast and lunch, as well as having other drinks and food available for purchase. The Park was amazing, Hollywood gave a short tour and we walked in/around the Fort learning the history of its existence. We snorkeled and enjoyed the beach for a while before heading back to Key West. Beautiful blue water, saw sharks, parrot fish, barracuda, and so much more. Highly recommend, next time we will try to reserve one of the seven camping slots allowed."
4,Absolutely beautiful!,"Ferry was sold out so I spent the extra money for the 40 min seaplane to Dry Tortuga. Pilot, Kris, was awesome.It was worth it! Beautiful ride. Saw tons of sea turtles and sharks from the plane. Ride was very smooth. Snorkeling was beautiful by the old dock pilings, out by the buoy and along the moat wall. Saw lots of fish, including barracuda and pretty corals. Water was very clear. Didn't do a tour of the fort but we walked around and saw the beautiful views from the roof."
5,Dry Tortugas,"We visited the Dry Tortuga National Park via the ferry from Key West.  Other options include a flat plane but it is much more expensive.  When we visited, a storm had just passed through and the water was cloudy so snorkeling was not an option.  On the key, there is the fort which includes a small gift shop.  The tour offered by the crew of the ferry is excellent - about an hour and it gives a great overview of the history of the fort.  The tour was free although the guide had a tip jar in his hands as we exited the ferry at the end of the trip.  The ferry ride was smooth an reasonably priced.  They offer a buffet continental breakfast and also lunch on the ferry, and alcoholic beverages are available for purchase on the return trip.  We spend a couple of hours at the fort which was pretty worthwhile especially with the tour.  And we found a nice shirt at the gift shop.  This is a great way to visit the Dry Tortugas National Park and I would highly recommend it."
6,"Dry Tortugas Park, Key West Florida","Great day trip from Key West.  The trip aboard the Yankee Freedom is about 5 hour round trip for an approx. 4 hour time frame at the fort, but your only other options are a seaplane or to charter a boat.  The area was well worth the transportation time.  The ocean is beautiful and the water very clear the time we were there.  Hollywood, the tour guide, gave a great short history of the fort and its geographical and historical importance.  The food provide was adequate and there were plenty of food/drink to purchase on board. On the way back we saw sea turtles from deck."
7,So neat!,We took a trip over for the day on a big catamaran. It was a local company and snorkel gear was part of the trip we took.  They served a really nice picnic style lunch.  The beaches were super clean and the water was very warm.  We enjoyed the sheltered waters and saw lots and lots of fish.  The tour of the fort was very fun and informative without being boring.  I certainly would do it again if I ever go back to Key West.
8,Must go,"We opted for the 4 hour float plane trip to Dry Tortugas.  The flights themselves were worth the price - flying low over clear shallow waters allowed us to see lots of sea life.  The pilot communicated through very good headphones.We had a little over two hours at Fort Jefferson and the key.  Because we were the first plane out, the whole place felt very quiet - the 10 from our plane and a few campers.  We toured the Fort on our own - saw nobody there for most of the time inside.  Went snorkeling off the south side - water was clear, saw some interesting sea life and, as before, we were the only ones there.Got back in time to have lunch.  We debated staying for the 8 hour trip - that would be a good trip also except there is no shade there and the day we went it was cloudless and very warm; also, once the boat arrives there are a couple hundred more people around.  Not crowded but not as peaceful."
9,Amazing location and day trip!,"We booked the park ferry months in advance to go to this quiet National park.  It was a full day, but fun.  The seas were a little choppy and we were told that the snorkeling there would not be great.  We brought gear, but decided not to go swimming after others said there was not much to see.  We listened to the guides short lecture on the Fort and then walked around exploring it ourselves.  Had lunch on the boat and then spent more time walking and just sitting on the beach watching others and enjoying the sun and beautiful views. The excursion was a bit pricey but the staff on the boat were great.  The return trip was a little more than bumpy, but we had no issues with seas sickness or otherwise.  One more National park off our bucket list!"
10,Memorable!  Everyone Should Experience.,"What an excellent adventure! We took the Yankee Freedom ferry out of Key West over to the Dry Tortugas early in the morning. It was a 2 1/2 hr boat ride (which was fun). They fed us breakfast on the boat and we were able to enjoy being either inside or outside for the ride. Once on the island, you could opt to tour the old fort or enjoy the beach by snorkeling or just laying in the sun. Your lunch is also served on the boat. It’s basically just sandwiches, salads and chips. We bagged ours up and ate on the beach after we snorkeled. We arrived back to key west about 5:30 in time for the sunset on Mallory Square. Great Day!"
11,Romantic getaway ,"We took the Yankee Freedom boat tour and it was amazing. It is a full day from 7am to 5.30pm but it is worth it. Once on the boat you ticket includes a full buffet breakfast at 8am. You arrive at the fort about 10.30 and there is a 20 minute talk which is a good investment of your time. We then walked up and around the fort walls before free lunch back on the boat between 11am and 1pm. Snorkel gear is provided and there are changing rooms. The whole place is amazing, a feat if engineering and willpower, the tour makes it all worthwhile. If you are in Key West for a couple of days this is an absolute must do."
12,"A lot of boat time, but worth it.","We took the ferry from Key West on March 2 to Dry Tortugas.  There were some waves, but not bad.  Had breakfast on the boat.  On the Key, we had a short lecture and time to explore around the island, with an  option for a longer 45 minute guided tour..  It is amazing the buildings and the number of people that used to be housed there at one time.  There was an option to go snorkeling, but the surf had riled up the water and they said there would be little visibility, so we did not swim. The ride back to Key West was much rockier and people were told to remain in their seats.  If you get a chance - go to this jewel in the park system."
13,A bucket list adventure for sure,We visited in February and the weather was ideal. You have a few hours on the island which is enough. The ferries are clean and breakfast and lunch are provided
14,Great Day Trip,"We had a great time on our tour of the fort yesterday.  The water on the trip over was VERY rough (they reported 4-6 foot seas) so there were many sick people on the boat over.  (We were lucky and took Dramamine - so no trouble!) The Yankee Freedom was great and the crew was very helpful and knowledgeable.The fort itself was phenomenal, with extensive history to enjoy.  The water was one of the most beautiful sights I have seen in my entire life! I only wish the day could have lasted longer - the trip was worth every penny!!"
15,Beautiful Park and Trip,"I'll be honest I wasn't crazy about the the 5 hours round trip on the boat.  What did help with that is we had amazing weather so it was a really smooth ride and was able to sit outside the entire way back.  The inside was a kept a little chilly for me. Once we got there I was immediately glad I did it.  Hollywood gave an amazing tour, we did the extended due to love of history, you can truly feel his passion for the park.  The whole crew was wonderful and very organized.   It is truly an amazing piece of history surrounded by beauty."
16,Florida’s Absolute Best Attraction,"Dry Tortugas NP has been on my bucket list for a while. We booked a 2:00 departure via Sea Plane Adventure. As we arrived the ferry was leaving so we enjoyed the island and snorkeling with absolutely no crowds.  Unfortunately, we did not get a tour of Fort Jefferson and the small gift shop on the inside was not open. We were traveling with 2 teens who wanted to snorkel anyway so it was not a big issue for us. Be sure to remember your ""reef safe"" sunscreen. Most snorkel areas are between 4-7 feet deep. The best area for sea life and coral is along the western moat wall. Compost/pit toilets are located near the campground. While the ferry is at dock they close those bathrooms and the ferry bathrooms are used.  There is a changing room (with two stalls) but no mirrors or sinks."
17,Went in  a hydroplane. What a trip!,Most beautiful beaches by far around KW. We went on the yankee freedom and it was well worth the over. 2 hour trip!
18,Must Do ,We took the Ferry out here for the day - snorkeling was fantastic and the crew was great.  Not to be missed.
19,Do Not Give These People Your Money!!,We had pretty great weather on a February day—boat ride fairly smooth but others before and after us weren’t as lucky due to wind churning rough water. History of Fort is worth learning. I wish I’d known that the water was as cold as it was—we couldn’t tolerate much snorkeling or swimming. Water clarity was lower due to winds. I recommend visiting in warmer months.
20,Snorkel Trip,"Horrible Experience!!! I was on the ferry this past Friday, 8/28. We were about 30 mins away from Dry Tortugas when the captain came over the intercom to advise that there was a problem with the ferry and that we had to go back to Key West. This problem resulted in about half a day of lost time of vacation because we didn't make it back to the harbor until about 12:30 (boat leaves dock at 8). On the way back to Key West, a crewmember came around asking the passengers if we wanted refunds or to reschedule. He was conveniently unable to answer when our refunds would be processed, therefore, I decided to call the next day. Left 2 messages at 2 different times. No response. Called again this morning. No response. On top of that, the crew took the opportunity to excitedly announce on the way back that ""The bar is open early!"". You would think that after inconveniencing an entire boatload of people, they might comp at least one drink. Nope. Pay up! This tour company is a joke and I would advise anyone to avoid using them. I'm wondering if I will ever see my refund"
21,Cancelled on us last minute with no possibility for reschedule,"This was the last National Park I was missing in FL and finally went to visit it. The trip has to be scheduled way in advanced because there is only one boat ride a day and fills up. It is a long trip to the key where the fort is located. If sea is choppy, please get Dramamine ahead of time. And have some for the ride back. The check in process and boarding went smoothly. Not much to see along the way. Light Breakfast and lunch were included and were fine. Once in the island, they gave us a tour of the fort. Take the long tour, it was worth it. They will tell you the history of the fort and answer questions.  David is a good story teller. The hiking was limited because birds are nesting nearby."
22,Exciting,"We had a fantastic time on our vacation this year.  We stayed aboard the Rogue Angel for 10 days.  The day we arrived we were met by Hannah and showed around our catamaran.  It was so clean and well stocked with linens, and galley equipment.   We settled in and when our captain arrived we set sail on an amazing adventure.  We sailed to the Dry Tortugas where we snorkeled, dove, and explored the Fort and the surrounding keys for seven days. the park was like no other we have ever visited. the reefs were spectacular and we saw so much wild life. Our captain was so helpful and wonderful with our kids. When returning to Key West we enjoyed Stock Island Marina Village for few days before returning home.  I enjoyed watching my children and my husband COMPLETELY unplug and the memories we made are so dear to my heart."
23,SO BEAUTIFUL!,"Luckily, we booked well in advance, as was advised by several people at a travel show. The boarding and all information on board was well organized by friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff. It was a beautiful, calm day and a lovely trip. Once at the park there were no bathrooms, but we were able to use the ones on the boat. The fort itself was quite interesting, but we opted to take the brief tour and spend the rest of the time snorkeling. The snorkeling equipment that was  provided was excellent and the water warm and calm. The snorkeling itself was variable. Some people saw more than others. Yellow and black fish were abundant. The breakfast and lunch provided were perfectly adequate. My only complaint was that the music was too loud for my tastes and played for the duration of the sailing. A note of caution:  not every day is lovely and calm. The following day was predicted to have 9 foot seas and they were still planning on sailing. The staff confided that people with young children should be very cautious. People would not be able to snorkel, and with rough seas many people often get seasick. Overall we had a wonderful day and the excursion was run very well. We would recommend it on a calm day."
24,Just Amazing,"We loved our trip out to Dry Tortugas! Crew made sure everyone was spaced out on the ferry & everyone worn masks on board. The crew was able to accommodate me with my gluten allergy with gf bread for my lunch. Once we got to the island, we did the Fort Jefferson guided tour. David was very knowledgeable about the Fort & shared lots of information. Very cool to see for any history geeks! The island itself is absolutely stunning. Probably one of the prettiest places I’ve ever been. I highly recommend to anyone coming down to Key West! Just make sure you bring sunscreen & a hat since you will be outside majority of the day."
25,Glad I Checked It Off the List,"The trip to Dry Tortugas National Park on the Yankee Freedom was great! It’s a bit of a long ride(2 1/2,hours each way) but once you get there Fort Jefferson and the island are incredible."
26,Great second visit ,"Took the ferry over to Dry Tortugas.  The entire day was great!  The folks on the Yankee Freedom III ferry were professional and accomodating.  The ride over was a bit choppy, but the crew sold dramamine.  Make sure you pick some up; I watched a lot of big macho dudes lose their breakfasts.The fort itself is huge and interesting.  We enjoyed walking about and reading information.  There is a tour but we opted out.  The woman working in the bookstore was really fun to talk with, and told us a bit about what it was like living and working on the fort.The beaches were beautiful and the water sublime.  I've never seen so many conch shells in my life!Make the time do do this when you visit Key West.  You won't regret it!"
27,incredible,"Just came back from Key West on Sunday June 28th. On the first day of our trip 6-23-20 we took a sea plane out to the Dry Tortugas. The staff was great and helpful and our pilot John was awesome. We went snorkeling out by the pylons and the beach side, the water temp was perfect the scenary was amazing. LOVED IT!!! We had an amazing time."
28,Amazing service,"My fiancé made me this surprise: he took me to the airport in Key West and we went to Dry Tortugas National Park by seaplane!So, it was a double wonderful trip, flying over this paradise and spending the day snorkeling and just watching was an experience! If you can do that once in your life don’t miss this opportunity!!"
29,Amazing place to camp,"I had the opportunity to experience Fort Jefferson and Dry Tortugas National Park courtesy of the Yankee Freedom III ferry, which was awesome. The park itself is stunning and the history is just amazing. I've been wanting to come here for years and it did not disappoint. Even with somewhat overcast weather at first, everything was perfect. The snorkeling is the best I've ever experienced. As someone who isn't generally a fan of snorkeling, this trip might have convinced me! The fact that you can camp there is also fascinating. I definitely heard some great stories from campers on the ferry back! I'm so glad I had the opportunity to experience this!"
30,Beautiful!  ,"The day trip on the Yankee Freedom was wonderful start to finish.  Where else can you visit a remote national park, a civil war fort, and go snorkeling all in one day?!?"
31,Absolutely worth it!,My husband said that it would have been worth our 1000 mile drive from home just to have seen the Dry Tortugas even if we had not have done anything else in the keys! That's how amazing it is! The fort has a very cool history and I would definitely recommend taking the one hour guided tour with the tour guide to make the most of it. Our guide was Bryan and he did great! The beaches are absolutely breathtaking with clear turquoise waters. We even saw a live conch and starfish in the shallow waters! It's an expensive trip but well worth the money! You gotta see it to believe it!
32,Worth it!,We took the Sea Plane down in the morning and had a wonderful flight! We saw lots of turtles and dolphins swimming! You can clearly see two shipwrecks from the air. It was all very exciting! Great snorkeling on the island and easy to hike around the fort. Best money spent!
33,A Must Sea,"Took the seaplane from key west to the island, an amazing place and still even more amazing that we had troops living there.A great history lesson but also beautiful water to snorkel in and topped by a fun float plane ride"
34,Truly Amazing.,"If you take the 8am flight, you have the island to yourself until the ferry arrives at 10:30. Yes, it costs more (1/2 day is probably enough), but you save 4 hours of boat time and get great views from the plane."
35,Hot!!!,The ferry crew and the tour guide were very knowledgeable about the park  The swimming and beaches were beautiful. Bring swim socks as the beach is crushed shells and not really sand
36,It’s worth the hype!,"Visited via Yankee White Catamaran and their service is excellent, they care.You definitely want to experience Fort Jefferson.  It is breath taking beautiful there.   During the first 30 minutes when the scenery was all new, I felt like I was seeing the most beautiful place in America.The snorkeling is fun.  There a reefs, plant life, and colorful fish.  It was awesome.  Wear a lot of sun block.  I had so much fun snorkeling, that I stayed out for a long time and got a mean sun burn.Watch out for moon jelly fish too!  They like to come say hi while you snorkel.The fort is fun to explore and the views from the top are amazing.There are lots of crabs hiding in shells all over the island too."
37,Very good destination to do in Key West,"‘Ello chaps!  Yankee Freedom is the exclusive water transportation option to get to get to Fort Jefferson (island) in the heart of the Dry Tortugas National Park.   Located approximately 70 miles west of Key West, it takes roughly 2 hours 30 minutes to get from Key West to the island, where you’ll have several hours to explore the fort and dip into the near by clear blue waters for some snorkeling and other aqua fun.   It is approximately $180 per person for the ferry day trip.   The cost includes round trip ferry transportation, a light breakfast and lunch, NPS fort entry fee, and use of snorkel gear.   The light breakfast consists of one-half bagel with cream cheese and a fruit, as well as choice of water, orange juice, or milk.   Lunch is choice of ham sandwich, turkey sandwich, as well as several cookies, chips, and water, canned lemonade,  or canned tea.   You have to prepare for an EARLY alarm on the day of the day of departure.   Campers have to report to the port by 6 a.m. with gear in hand - and day trippers are urged to be there by 7 a.m. for boarding to begin around 715/730 a.m.   The boat leaves around 8 a.m. for the hair more than 2 hour ferry ride out to the island.

It’s not five star cuisine, in quality nor pricing, that’s a good thing. Chips, drinks, etc are just a few dollars. Alcohol beverages are also available for purchase on the return trip.   For many, this trip is a bucket list trip.   It truly is a memorable experience.   Overall I give Yankee Freedom and the trip to Fort Jefferson five stars out of five."
38,Just GO!!!,"Best Kept National Park Secret.  We were there with about 100 people in a National Park.  The history was fantastic with beautiful scenery and sights.  We enjoyed the tour, gift shop and snorkeled.  Take the day trip and enjoy one of our most beautiful National Parks.  We will go back again.  The ride was relaxing and fun and the staff and crew were amazing.  If you have never been, GO!!!"
39,Amazing location ,I have wanted to do this for years and finally took a boat to the torugas.Snorkelling was great as was the tour.
40,Must See American Site,"It’s a 70+/- mile ferry ride but you see gorgeous views along the way such as sea turtles, flying fish (yes really) and even the occasional shark! This was a fort from the 1800s and is amazing!! They give a tour to explain it all which is totally worth it (and optional) and then you are free to explore more and snorkel around the perimeter! Probably my favorite part about key west overall!"
41,Dry Tortugas National Park and the Yankee Freedom,The staff on the Ferry were the best. Smooth trip for a great day at the park. Enjoyed the water and snorkeling.
42,Amazing trip,If you do not have tome to go on a day or multi day boat tour to this incredible place Charter a Seaplane. A must see!
43,"No fishing, no diving no drones, no pwc’s!",Must make reservations well in advance or check at kiosk by port for cancellations.  Our guide was great and very enthusiastic.  Two and half hour ride to island was beautiful and they gave information the whole trip.  The fort is amazing and we wandered the entire island.  Wanted to snorkel but the water was a bit cold.  Highly recommend this for a day trip from Key West.
44,vacation 2020,"I was afraid my second visit to Dry Tortugas was not going to be as good as the first because you know what the saying is about second parts. But this time it was even better. Starting with the reservation process. I had to call because one member of our party could not make it. Yvonne at the Yankee Freedom was super helpful. The entire crew in the ferry did the best to make our experience unique despite the whole COVID situation. We had a great day at Fort Jefferson. My recommendation is to bring mosquito repellent, those bugs are hungry. Also bring an umbrella and go to the North Beach, it is better than the South Beach in my opinion. Do not miss the snorkeling even if you cannot swim, it is really shallow. We saw two huge tarpons and many yellow tails. We could have touched them because they were totally un afraid and very curious. We are looking forward to go next year."
45,Amazing piece of History!,"Interesting history, we went during winter but many people snorkeled and they had a good time. The fort is huge by itself and spent 3 hours just walking around island and fort"
46,A must see if you are going to Key West,It's a must do trip if you love snorkeling and forts and boats. Fort is huge and snorkeling on south beach is fantastic. Stay along fort wall and go over to pilings as well. It's amazing the fish you will see by pilings. Yes is $$$$ but for most like me it's a once in life experience. Just do it!!! 😎
47,Must do. ,"We took this tour on my birthday.  It was fantastic!  The weather was perfect.  The crew of the Yankee Freedom III knows how to treat their guests.  From the ticket booth first thing in the morning until the final docking back in Key West, they all had a wonderful, friendly attitude and were very helpful with any and all questions.  Hollywood is a very knowledgeable tour guide and a wonderful storyteller.  Capt. Meg was kind enough to circle the boat a few times when we encountered 2 pods of dolphins on our way back.  Bryan, Mark and the rest of the crew did a great job keeping all of us fed, watered and happy.  Even canine Maddie was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this tour.  It is well worth the cost!"
48,Great snorkeling with a historical backdrop,"What an adventure we took on a seaplane to this amazing, desolate park.  Tons of bird watching, hermit crabs, ghost crabs, starfish, barracudas, conchs, and other wildlife.  We took the first seaplane out so we basically had the place to ourself with 16 other people plus a few campers.  The fort is cool to explore.  It’s obvious the government has shut down money for this place throughout the years.  I’m glad I got to see it."
49,def. a must visit when in KW,We had such a great time on our trip. We were fortunate enough to have calm seas and saw lots of fish when we snorkeled.  The tour of the Fort was very interesting and we explored it on our own as well.  The food for breakfast and lunch was fine but simple. I would definitely do this trip again!!!
50,An amazing day and experience,The boat ride to the Dry Tortugas was fabulous and you would have never guessed that they were short handed.  Getting off the boat you are immediately infatuated with the crystal clear water.  The fort was fantastic as well.
51,Don't want to skip this tour!,"It’s two hours on a boat, but well worth the voyage.  The huge fort is fascinating.  Be sure todo for on a day that the guide named Hollywood."
52,Worth The Money,"This was a great day all around.  Booking online was very easy.  I arrived early for check in and they really made us wait until 7am.  The check in was easy.  While waiting to board they walked us through what to expect and sold us a single dose of Dramamine.  If you have any doubts buy it.  There were several instances of people getting sick, and the drug would have saved them embarressment and feeling sick for the rest of the day.  They provided a cold breakfast.  They showed info videos that helped me to be set for the snorkeling later.  Once on shore I opted for the guided tour of the fort and learned things I would have missed, due to my lack of patience with reading every plackard.  After eating my lunch of sandwiches provided for us, I went on my snorkeling adventure.  I came back in with time to get showered and change for the return trip.  Several things to know and plan for.  You will take all your items with you off the ship, so bring a pack you can carry.  The WiFi did not work, so if you want to buy something bring cash.  While they provide scuba equipment you need to bring the towel.  It may be warm in Key West, but it won't be on the ship especially after going for a swim.I loved this trip.  I was able to relax due to no WiFi accessibility.  Did something I had never done before, snorkeling.  A perfect day."
53,Enlightening History of a Unique National Park,"Went to the fort with the ferry. Just as I was amazed by the Grand Canyon, after finally seeing it, I was amazed by this location and the history behind it. The snorkeling was amazing, it was interesting to know one could camp on-site, and the fort itself is awe-inspiring. Very much recommend this as an agenda item on any Key West trip."
54,Dry Tortugas is a must see!!,"Unfortunately we took the boat on a very choppy, windy day.  We were forewarned and given the opportunity to cancel.  Dramamine was encouraged and sold before we took off.  Even so, by the end of the trip, many passengers were ill. The trip back was less choppy.That being said, the water was beautiful and the crew was stellar.  Breakfast and lunch were served on the boat with a variety of choices.  Breakfast: fruit, coffee, tea, juice, bagels, hot and cold cereal, boiled eggs.  Lunch: sandwich makings with several choices, fruit, chips, cookies.It took about 2 1/2 hours on the ferry each way.  Seating is at tables with comfortable benches and high back seats. All indoors, Lower and upper level. Four restrooms. At 2 pm the snack and drink bar open with adult beverages at reasonable prices.When we got to the fort there was a 15 minute background talk if you chose and a guided tour 45 minutes or you could take the self guided which was what the guide followed. We had visited Fort Taylor the day before and that background information was very helpful.After the tour was time to eat lunch, explore around the fort, or sit on the beach.  No snorkeling the day we went due to wind and chop. We could not go much past the fort due to frigate birds nesting area and we saw dozens of them.There was a small gift shop that also had exhibits.  We did the day trip but several brought camping gear for overnight, booked ahead.It was a unique adventure for us and we're glad we went."
55,Amazing Time.,"We were really excited about this trip and some of the disappointment was the bad weather.  However, even with good weather, it would be hard to enjoy much of the snorkeling and leisure with the short time provided. It takes a long time to get out there and back, so between lunch and a fort tour, there isn't a lot of time for other stuff. If you get bad weather, it is tough to enjoy it. It's booked way ahead too, so no switching days. If you go, make sure to arrive before 7:00 as you board first come in numbered groups."
56,Clean and well taken care of! ,"20 to 30 mph winds and mid to high 60s forecast for the day of our reservation.  Called at 7am to ask about conditions and recommendations since they are the experts and got a very rude response.  To my question about conditions I got “either you go or you don’t, we are still going”.  With that response I knew I just lost 360 dollars so I cancelled.  He said “ok I’ll cancel your reservation”.  I thought maybe there would be a Hail Mary chance for a refund but all I received was a blunt “no”.  I feel I made the right decision after seeing 12ft seas.  That would cripple my wife for two days at least due to motion sickness.  This was one of her bucket list items for our trip to Key West.  She can handle choppy seas but nothing like what we saw in the forecast the morning of departure.  We plan on making another attempt in the future but via seaplane.  We will not book the ferry due to the lack of customer service.  Our lesson, read the reviews carefully and take note of the bad ones.  Heed the cancellation policy and don’t expect any consideration from the vendor due to weather or conditions.  Also don’t cause yourself anguish by thinking you can make the boat trip.  Sea sickness is no joke.  Be sure you can handle rough conditions.  Cancel early if you have any doubts."
57,Very Rushed. Camp Instead,"Great trip and well worth the time it took to do it. Our guide, Hollywood, was fantastic and full of knowledge about the history of the ford."
58,Cat trip,"Yes, to book this day trip is pricey at around $150 a ticket but, so worth it! You get breakfast, lunch, unlimited water, snorkle gear, an awesome tour of the place b the same guy Hollywood, who clearly loves what he does and does it well!!! I will be going back for sure. If you like learning about hte history of places, this will be beyond perfect for you!!!"
59,Absolutely gorgeous,"The Park Ranger answered all questions we had.Lots of good views.  Not a ton, of stuff to see,  but, it is a fort.  But, good history happened here."
60,Photos,"So I know this is an expensive trip. And yes, it’s a long day with the boat ride and getting up super early. But it is worth it. I am not a history buff so we skipped the tour in lieu of exploring and snorkeling. The water was perfect on the island the day we went. We snorted around the outside of the wall and saw quite a few fish, coral, sea turtles, etc. It was a once in a life time experience for sure. That being said, there’s not a lot of time on the island so you need to be sure of what you want to do. There’s NO shade on the island whatsoever(we put our towels in an almost shade area. But it was a bit rocky) so the sun was, obviously, quite intense. I put on several layers of sunscreen but still ended up burned. The Snorkel equipment for rent wasn’t great - two of the vests leaked and the fins were a little rough. The snorkels had seen better days. The boat ride over was fairly nice until the last 40 minutes it got a little choppy (I get very seasick and I was using the patch and staying outside in the air the whole time, most everyone else seemed fine.) I would recommend taking medicine if you get at all seasick ever. Even though there wasn’t much chop to the water and it was a big boat, I wouldn’t have enjoyed myself without that. We saw lots of flying fish and some turtles on the way back, and the ride back was very smooth. The breakfast and Lunch served were basic but fine. (Bagel and cream cheese, fruit, coffee and juice, and sandwiches and chips for lunch. Alcohol and other snacks available for purchase.)Definitely a long day and we were tired but a great experience."
61,Delightful Day,Very interesting.  Park Ranger Bryan did an awesome job telling us the history of the fort.  Beautiful views.
62,Beautiful!,"We enjoyed our 2 hour visit here.  Touring the fort, walking on the moat wall, seeing the fish, watching the Frigate birds, strolling the beach, and sitting in the sun took up all our time.  We did NOT snorkel as the 75 degree water was too cold for me!  Currently you can get here by ferry or seaplane from Key West.  There are loads of fish in the waters and under the dock that you can see from dry land. It was a nice visit on a wonderful sunny day for us."
63,average place to visit but still nice,LOVED this Experience!  We took the Seaplane and we felt it was well worth it.  Such a beautiful ride to Dry Tortuga.  Snorkeling was great- and the water was perfect!
64,Dry Tortugas National Park,"The captain and crew of Freedom boat were all professional and made the trip very enjoyable.  Good food, drink, and freedom to move around and enjoy the experience on the water.  Once arriving, there was plenty of time to enjoy Fort Jefferson and the surrounding area.  We really enjoyed this trip.  As seniors, we were a little concerned that there were no bathrooms on the Island, but with the boat nearby, it was easy to get to the ""head"" when needed.  Hot coffee was always available on board and a very good lunch bar that we had ample time to visit a couple of times.  It was cold and blustery but very comfortable in spite of bad weather."
65,Worth the Money!,"Although we love visiting national parks, we had never been to Dry Tortugas National Park which is in our own state of Florida. Although it is small and not easy to get to, we are so glad we did. Fort Jefferson is amazing and the water around the key where the fort sits is gorgeous. Of course the national park includes other keys, but you have to have your own boat to get to them."
66,WOW!,Worth every penny! We went on the Yankee Freedom for the day. Lots of history and awesome snorkeling!
67,A nice day!,"Beautiful views, great snorkeling spot. We enjoyed walking the fort. We went by seaplane which in itself was a fun experience, but visiting this island National Park was bucket list worthy."
68,Worth the money!,The 2 hour trip was beautiful. Kenny Chesney & Jimmy Bufffet radio for 2 hours was not!( I usually love them both).  A few people vomiting made me sick (chain reaction). The boat goes very fast. We were given an apple and a cold 1/4 of a bagel for breakfast and mini coffees.  Lunch was a cold good sandwich and chips. Drinks were $5-$6. We saw barely any coral. And maybe 10 fish. We snorkeled on both sides for more than 3 hours. Thelady on the boat literally walked around every 10 mins checking masks. And yelled many times from the bar area telling people to put their masks on..I get it but yelling solves nothing. You can have it off only when eating and drinking. More than half of the places on the island and Fort were closed off for swimming and touring. Overall would not go again unless I was camping. Very rushed. There were so many birds you could barely swim in some areas. We did get some cool photos
69,Seaplane to Dry Tortuga,"Loved this trip! Staff on the Yankee Freedom III were very nice and took great care of us. We had our National Park Annual Pass and the staff applied the refund exactly as stated on their website. Breakfast was a snack - so if you need more bring it or buy it. The food and drinks they sold were very reasonable - not marked up which was awesome. Lunch was a sandwich made with love, chips, cookies and a cold drink. We snorkeled for hours and toured the fort. Kids got their National Park stamp and the gift store was open - which was not the case at Everglades or Key Biscayne. Dry Tortugas is a must see!! We have great memories, beautiful pictures, and enjoyed every bit of this tour. Thank you Yankee Freedom III and the lady working at the National Park Store!"
70,Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was our first trip to the Dry Tortugas National Park, and will not be our last! The trip out aboard the Yankee Freedom was a very pleasant and enjoyable ride. The crew went out of their way to make us all comfortable. We went straight to snorkeling and missed the tour of Fort Jefferson, as I said we will be back. This is a must do when exploring and enjoying the many things in Key West!A 5 Star booking!"
71,Well worth the price!,This is a great day excursion. Go see the fort and snorkel around. Easy boat ride and the park rangers are great. Everything felt safe and was hassle-free.
72,Amazing Trip Back in Time!!!,"This was our second trip to the Dry Tortugas. The trip was wonderful, and I can’t say enough about the crew. They made sure everyone was well taken care of, even when several were feeling sick from rough water. I highly recommend taking the hour tur of the fort. The staff knows so much history about the place. Hollywood is an amazing guide!"
73,great day,No matter how you decide to go this is another historical and nature place that visitors should go to. It is a National Park and there are many things to learn about the fort.
74,Worth a trip,"Beautiful place, less colorful than 15 years ago when I first snorkel there. Awesome place nevertheless."
75,Wonderful day,The trip to Dry Tortugas by catamaran was the worst. People eating breakfast and then vomiting all over the place. Never again! Lets be honest folks that this is very false rating of this excursion.
76,Snorkeling and sightseeing,"A visit to the Dry Tortugas National Park has been on our bucket list for some time.  Finally made it!  Having researched the history of  Fort Jefferson, we were looking forward to exploring the fort.  Almost the entire fort is open for exploration and it proved to be a pretty spectacular experience walking the different levels and imagining what it was like in the mid 1800s. If this is all you want from your visit, I don’t think there’s a reason to ever visit again.  However, there are opportunities for camping, snorkeling, and kayaking that we did not take advantage of.  We visited in January and the water temp was pretty cool and due to recent storms the water clarity was not good.  We took the ferry here (2 1/2 hrs), but there are also float planes trips to the park."
77,Rude customer service,We had a great time at Dry Tortugas National Park.  The weather was perfect.  Loved the blue ocean.  Would love to try camping out there sometime!
78,Long trip but worth it,The Dry Tortugas was so clean and taken care of! You can definitely tell they care for this national park. I came with my fiancé to snorkel and we were not disappointed. Also very awesome place for families!!
79,Boating to and from the National Park and snorkeling,"I had no expectation and everyone in crew loved this. Touring the fort, beautiful water, snorkeling was fun. We took the ferry. A few got sea sick....we brought snacks but the ferry has snacks. Breakfast is a half bagel w/cream cheese. Lunch was a choice of turkey or ham sandwich made by the crew. Bring your own water there is no water and the water on the ferry are tiny bottles. Parking, we parked where the ferry said to park $32 a day but there is a parking garage right across the street from checkin for $15 a day. Overall, worth the trip!  Makes for a long day but very worth it."
80,Dry Tortugas via the ferry,Took float plane to Dry Tortugas and snorkeled there.   Great experience!!!!  What a great fort—-made up of 16 million bricks.
81,An excellent day trip!,"Lovely water, interesting fort and story. You get a few hours to walk around and sunbathe, glad we visited. Pictures say more than words cab"
82,Amazing place and amazing experience,"First I have to say it was not the trip to take if you are covid conscientious.  It is not 5 hours on the ferry it is closer to 7 when you add in boarding twice and such.  The only outdoor seating up top, no canopy, and if that is full, which it was,they tried to insist inside. That was not happening, no one is wearing masks, they are all eating or drinking,  even sleeping with no masks, they did not open any windows for air circulation. So I became the person who refused to sit inside. 5 or 7 hours in the sun, plus 4 when you get there is way too much sun, and I have never lived north of Orlando.   I do live in Florida, snorkel and dive, so snorkeling is so much better elsewhere, I knew that was going to be true, so can't fault that.  I travel a lot and maybe have toured too many forts, although it is the biggest and most impressive i have ever seen, it is a fort. It is awe inspiring to think anyone would even imagine building it. Kind of like visiting Machu Picchu, another ruin yes, but huge and why there.  I have been waiting more than 30years to take this trip, couldn't afford it with 4 kids, turns out that is just as well, do not think it is a great trip for kids, boat ride too long, too much history, for an hour of beach time.   Glad I did it, might have been better if no covid, or they had a place to sit outside in the shade on the boat, or opened a window inside."
83,Took the seaplane out to the fort.  It was fantastic!,"If you can bear the expense, by all means do the seaplane trip to the fort, and NOT the boat. 35 minutes in the air and you get a great view of key west, as well as the various islands going out there. The 8AM flight gets there before the boat comes, so there are no crowds, and doing the half day trip, you are back by lunch. The boat fills up weeks in advance, whereas we made the plane reservations only 2-3 days before. Its a very friendly, easy experience... 11 persons on the plane. BTW, the island and fort are very interesting and scenic."
84,Great day,"If you can bear the expense, by all means do the seaplane trip to the fort, and NOT the boat. 35 minutes in the air and you get a great view of key west, as well as the various islands going out there.

BTW, the island and fort are very interesting and scenic."
85,Float plane to Dry Tortugas,"We went on 2/23/20.  Winds were 20+ mph and wave heights were 4+ ft.  We are boaters and knew what to expect. While it was a choppy ride, we were fine.  Others, not so much.  Take the dramamine.  Once at Fort Jefferson, you can listen to a short talk, then take the longer tour.   Your choice.  Snorkeling was offered, but water was churned up and cold.  We passed.  You can walk all around,  on the sea wall, and atop the fort.  Great views and lots of history.  Breakfast and lunch were good.  Staff was busy with sick people, but always had a smile."
86,"Walk, Snorkel, Birdwatch, Kayak",We were well warned about the choppy seas which unfortunately prevented snorkelling. But our guided tour of the fort and ramble around the island was very enjoyable once the sun came out. Excellent service on board and off by the Yankee Freedom crew.
87,Amazing,"This national park is pretty amazing. Although it's on a small island, there is a lot to see and do - from touring the park to swimming, snorkeling or just laying on the beach. I recommend Yankee Freedom III to get to the island. They do a great job!"
88,Worst trip ever,"We thoroughly enjoyed the ride out and the history of the fort. It is absolutely stunning and it’s amazing to think of the challenges faced when building a fort of that size in the middle of the Gulf. Unfortunately, with the rain on the way out and while we were there it was too murky too see much while snorkeling, but the views from the top of Fort Jefferson were breath taking. As for the crew on the Yankee Freedom III, Bryan, Tom, and Kelly were wonderful and kept everyone comfortable. While we weren’t sick, we watched as they retrieved waters and cold compresses for those that weren’t fairing as well. They made accommodations for my GF diet needs and offered to store the couple’s insulin that we shared a table with. There are not enough positive things to say about Hollywood. His enthusiasm is infectious and we appreciated having such an energetic and knowledgeable guide. Two downfalls: 1) many parts of the fort are closed for restoration so we’d like to return when it’s more open and 2) we were told to be there at 7am to checkin and board. At 8am, they were still admitting people to the ferry that were “late” after we were supposed to leave at 745am. Be prepared to spend about 5 hours total on the ferry. It was about 4 hours at Fort Jefferson and playing in the water."
89,Unique Adventure,"What a great way to spend the day in Key West.  ""Hollywood"" was a very informative tour guide and made history come alive.  The boat ride on the ""Freedom Express"" was smooth and comfortable.  Plenty of time to explore the island and go swimming.  Can't say I was thrilled with the food (due to COVID it was paired down) but I got enough to eat.  Make sure you follow their directions of the things to bring.  You will need them."
90,Worth the trip!!! ,"Most unbelievably beautiful water we’ve ever seen! Enjoyed walking the fort and hanging out on the beach! Amazing paradise views in the middle of the ocean! Highly recommend Yankee Freedom boat ride to get there, very professional and friendly! Worth the time and the price!!"
91,Worth the time,"We waited all week for tickets to open up. When they finally did, we didn't hesitate to book them. Got up at 5:30 AM to get there by 6:20, paid $32 for parking.. The Ferry station was a ghost town.. Okay maybe we're just early? Then another person showed up and asked if it has been cancelled. We didn't know. At 6:50 a man shows up and informs us that the trip was cancelled because ""the island isn't allowing anyone to come because of the storm"". The storm had passed key west two days ago - The weather was perfect all day. No more trips would depart until Sunday at the earliest, and we leave Friday. This was the main reason we came to Key West, so getting cancelled last minute was a big deal to us. They did send a cancellation email some hours after we booked it, but unfortunately google decided that one was spam, not the confirmation email though, I got that one. Don't book your trip to Key West around this event because who knows if it'll even happen for you. We won't be back to try again any time soon."
92,Once in a lifetime trip,"Can not express the joy of visiting the Park!  Have visited (and camped there, 3 day max, primitive camping, ie garbage in/garbage take with you when leaving) as well as day tripped there at least 10 times.  You can take the Dry Tortugas ferry, or a seaplane.      The fort is a gem!  It was used as a US military installation, as well as imprisoning the doctor that treated President Lincoln’s assassin (Dr Samuel Mudd).      You can explore the fort which is quite the journey, or just lazily lay on the beach, or even snorkel around the fort.  The marine life is fantastic!  Spotted Eagle Rays, Sea Turtles, octopus, the list goes on.  I have been scuba diving for 42 years, and I still get as much enjoyment from snorkeling the fort!    Well worth the trip, bring your swimwear, and most importantly your camera.  It’s run by the US Park Service, and they do a superb job!"
93,A bumpy ride but worth the trip,"Don’t go! It’s a long trip there, and when you do get there you can only fish at anchor. You can only anchor with in a mile of the fort. It’s not where you would want to fish. The snorkeling and diving is very difficult, as there only a handful of morning balls to which you can only go to, and there all Bussey! or set in a place where you can’t get to the site due to the strong current! Your only allowed 2hrs on the morning if you could even get one!! The little time we did snorkel, the reefs are mostly dead, and not an abundance of fish, better in the upper Keys!However, the WORST problem in doing anything here is the federal conservation police that watch EVERYTHING you do, I mean minute by minute. The come to your boat the first night you check in. This is NOT a social visit or a courtesy!! They are there to set you up for your ticket that you’re apt to get the next day!!! I am a 70 yo senior citizen, I have not had a speeding ticket in the past 25 year, I consider myself a very law bidding person that respects the law. I received a ticket for fishing in an area he now tells me is no fishing allowed. If you read the information brochure they give you, they don’t make it clear where and where not you can fish. One statement said you can not fish in 46 % of the Park, which leads you to believe that there’s places to fish. THERE IS NOT! Don’t think about a spear gun, you would probably end up in the very prison you are visiting!!!"
94,So much to see,"I am a huge National Park fan (I have been to 50 of the big 62). Of these 50 parks, Dry Tortugas ranks 19th for me. This may not seem great, but I rank it above Arches, Hawaii Volcanoes, and many other great parks. Those parks have excellent attractions, but Dry Tortugas has 3 top notch things to do. The first is the noteworthy Fort Jefferson. A giant brick building with massive turrets, fascinating history, and beautiful ocean views. The whole place is enjoyable with interpretive signs, bright colors, and even some wildlife around the fort. The next activity is snorkeling. I love snorkeling and would consider the Great Barrier Reef one of the most beautiful places on Earth. For the most part, I feel that snorkeling in Florida has nowhere near as much color and intricate shapes as Australia does. However, Dry Tortugas proved me wrong. The south docks have giant coral structures living on the dock pilings and have plenty of parrotfish, barracudas, and other interesting sea life. My favorite part, however, was taking a seaplane to and from the island. From the plane, I got aerial views of Garden Key, the Marquesas, and wildlife including 3 nurse sharks and dozens of loggerhead turtles. On the way to the island, a beautiful rainbow formed behind Fort Jefferson and made for a great photo. Other wildlife I saw includes frigatebirds, ghost and hermit crabs, pelicans, egrets, and many migratory birds. This experience was amazing. Between coral reefs, brick forts, abundant wildlife, and unique activities, this is a seriously overlooked park. I encourage everyone to visit this park. There are practically no people on the island at any given time. I recommend taking the seaplane, but those who get air sick should take the boat. Bring lots of sunscreen and water, because you’ll be almost on your own for the experience of a lifetime."
95,Yankee Freedom Ferry Tour,"If you’ve never been to a pristine beach or are really into historical forts, absolutely go. We took the sea plane for about $330 which was cool but the sea was too rough to snorkel. Maybe if we had snorkeled, it would be worth $330. My mom loved the sea plane and felt it was worth the cost. I felt a little differently. The next day we went snorkeling at Pennekamp State Park for about $30 including the boat ride out to the reef and it was awesome. Dry Tortugas was great, but it was costly."
96,National Park Tour,"Excellent! Well worth it! As a family traveling with a teenager we all thoroughly enjoyed the day! Had a combination of a historical tour, physical activity of snorkeling and then laying on a beach! The island itself is beautiful and surrounding water gorgeous! However don’t expect to see a lot of marine life while snorkeling especially if you have dived and snorkeled around the world!"
97,Worth the 2.5 hour ferry trip,"We were lucky enough to have beautiful weather and gentle seas, so we enjoyed the ride as well as the Park.  There was plenty to do at the Park: sightseeing the historic fort, swimming, and snorkeling.  I got lots of great photos.  The included breakfast and lunch on the boat were both cold buffets, but there was a reasonable variety of choices and everything was fresh and tasty.Three of the four of us sat in on our guide Hollywood's 20-minute talk about the history fo the Fort.  The 20 minutes stretched until almost 30, but we enjoyed every minute of it.  His knowledge of the history was impressive and his enthusiasm for the place was contagious.  We all did different activities but we all enjoyed our day."
98,A National Park not to be missed!,"Due to covid, the number of passengers was restricted, as was movement on the boat.The crew was great, but by the time we got to the fort, the heat & humidity were oppressive. Had no desire to wait in the heat for everyone to gather, then sit/stand in the heat for a 20 minute talk, and walk around in the heat with the guided tour. Highly recommended taking your own cooler with drinks for the beach(es), and be aware that there is no shade.The fort is beautiful, and fascinating, but would probably be better visiting in cooler months. For snorkeling, head to the areas sea life will use to hide...coral heads, old piers, and among the debris where the most wall collapsed. Find a spot and hover...the fish, sea turtles, etc. will come out."
99,So worth the effort and time and money,"We are so grateful we got to do this before the coronavirus shut everything down.  Fabulous history and fabulous birds ( magnificent frigate birds, sooty terns, etc)..The boat ride over is pleasant with breakfast and lunch provided and info from a guide...This was a bucket list item and it exceeded all expectations!"
100,INTERESTING VISIT,"The Yankee Freedom III tour of Dry Tortugas is a must see if you have a day to do it. I've been coming to Key West for years and this was my first time doing it. The day starts off with a breakfast buffet of cereal, fruit and bagels. The trip out to the fort is about 2-1/2 hours. It was a little rough the morning I went but the crew was very attentive to passengers who weren't feeling well. Once we arrived, the ferry's crew offered a 20 minute starter tour, with an optional 40 minute add on. Our tour guide, Hollywood (yes, that's what his name tag said), was one of the best tour guides I've ever had. He reeled off facts about the fort staccato fashion and with great humor and passion. You could tell he absolutely loves his job. After the tour, there was lunch on the ferry. Typical cold cuts  but they were fresh and copious and no complaints. After lunch, there were 2 hours to go around the fort taking pictures, which is my thing. Another option is snorkeling around parts of the park. You are also allowed to camp in the park overnight. It's not inexpensive but it is well worth the price because everything is taken care of for you and you get two meals. The only caution I have is that for kids that get bored, it is a 2-1/2 hour ride each way, so it might be too much for them or you'll need to bring something to entertain them."
101,Yankee Freedom tour,"Loved the boards throughout Fort Jefferson that explain the history of the fort, and what the various areas were used fo. Amazing views from the top of the fort. It took us approximately two (2) hours to explore the entire fort, and got some amazing pictures. Be sure to take your time, read the explanation boards, and enjoy the amazing history of Fort Jefferson."
102,Enjoyable trip over on a blustery day,"The give you snorkling gear and a cooler with water/ sodas.  You bring your own food.  The pilots give you a great history lesson as you scan the ocean for rays, sharks and turltes!"
103,Dry Tortugas National Park,"Two of our three days in Key West were miserable; some of the coldest weather they've had in a very long time actually. Being in the Keys basically required a visit to Fort Jefferson and Dry Tortugas NP and we are so glad we went. The ride to the park was a bit choppy but that was due to the lingering high winds they'd had. Once there, you've got four hours to try and conquer the island and if you choose to layout and/or snorkel, it feels even shorter. If you read the packet about Fort Jefferson, you can skip the guided tour and explore on your own which we did. After taking in some of the awesome views atop the fort, I chose to walk the perimeter of the island which is awesome. This place gives you some super primitive camping and experiences as your cell phone is just a camera and clock when you're on the island. If you're a national park nerd, this park tends to be a bucket list stop; it's worth it. If you're in the keys, make this a priority!"
104,Dry Tortugas camping. 3 days 2 nights on 2 different occasions,It's truly amazing how they could built such a fort in the 1800's and to learn about the history. Our guide from the Yankee Freedom gave us a nice tour of the fort with plenty of information.  I have to saw the crew of the Yankee Freedom were very attentive on our voyage to the fort and on our way back. We have 5-6 foot seas going back to Key West and they made sure everyone was comfortable and doing okay. Well worth the day outing.
105,Dry Tortugas day trip,"I was a little skeptical because of the high price tag, but so glad we booked this trip. Awesome snorkeling if you go by the coaling towers. Great history but we spent most our time snorkeling. Be brave. Go out where the rocks and pylons are. So beautiful."
106,Absolutely Incredible!,"If you like history and have an imagination of what it must have been like in the 1800’s when they built this place you will like it. Well organized, facilities were clean. I was told it was cold cut sandwiches, yogurt, salads, etc. and it was, and it was good. If your expecting a full breakfast and lunch buffet then you may be disappointed. I knew it was going to be a sandwich and chips and it was good.  All the crew did a good job. Bring sunscreen and comfortable walking shoes. And beach sandals too. Snorkeling gear is provided and it would be a nice trip on a warmer day than when we went. Overall great trip."
107,Rest trip!,"My friend and I absolutely loved our day on the Dry Tortugas. We snorkeled and spent quite a bit of time wandering Fort Jefferson which was amazing, especially if you like history and military history at all. The crew were awesome as well."
108,Not for everyone,What a fun day! Staff were wonderful. Whole experience was well planned for the enjoyment of the passengers. Highly recommend.
109,A hard to get to place!,Absolutely breath taking sites! Great and relaxing place to go with the family. The tour was informative and entertaining and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend and go again!
110,Great Pristine Beach ,"My boyfriend and I had such a great day here! The boat staff is wonderful! Shoutout to Tim! The food on the boat is actually not bad, and the drinks are pretty great! The fort itself is incredible, and such an important piece of history. After we explored the fort and got sweaty, we headed down to some of the best snorkeling in the Keys. We snorkeled along the fort, which has now become a beautiful reef. There were many fish to see and the water was crystal clear. I definitely recommend this trip!"
111,Quiet!,"Go to this park, a lot of snorkelling spots, you will see a lot of fishes, we went there by plane with seaplanes adventure, this was amazing. The sand and the light are beautiful. You could visit the old fortress, or make snorkelling. The snorkling near the old charcoal dock is amazing, or in the north, at the extremest right along the dock"
112,Best part of our trip!,Awesome place to visit for history and natural beauty! Everyone needs to see it once in their life! The crew of the Yankee Freedom 3 was great! The price is reasonable and you can even camp there for up to 4 days!
113,Interesting history that most people don’t know,It’s a treat to be able to either explore on your own or catch a guided tour.  There were a couple of beaches pictured below that were magnificently clear.  The views from the forts 3rd level were awesome!  This was on my bucket list and it was sure worthy of being there!!!!  BEWARE SMALL hermit crabs will gather to share your snacks if your not careful🤣.  It’s pricey but worth every penny!
114,Great National Park,"My family of 5 plus my parents' (ages ranging from 13 yrs - 78 yrs old) took a half day tip to the dry tortugas nationa park.   The beaches are fine and it was interesting to walk around the fort and read all the history.   We brought our snorkling gear (we are all scuba divers) to do some snorkling off one of the beaches. We actually saw a decent amount of wild life.   There are no services here.    No bathrooms, food, beverage etc.   You will need to pack everything with you that you would want for your time there.    They did have bathrooms on the ferry that was docked there.   Not sure what you would do if the ferry was not docked?   I would say the park itself is ordinary.    We actually booked a sea plane adventure and this was the destination (The actual  sea plane ride to the park was awesome - I definately recommend).   I am not sure I would recommend the park itself."
115,Beautiful and Educational,"I hate to let the masses know about this still-somewhat-secretive gem, but probably the most beautiful park I've ever visited.  Camping was a delight and the snorkeling was top-notch."
116,Take the morning flight,"The island is amazing. Beautiful, clean and big enough that you wont run into anyone and can be pretty much by yourself in some spots. Great for snorkeling, the beach is amazing. The fort is well kept. The area is clean and well taken care of. Amazing for a day trip, would love to stay and camp out once"
117,Wonderful if you like old abandoned forts ,"Dry Tortugas is cool, but it's a bit pricey to get out here and there's plenty to do in the Florida Keys without ever going to the fort. I'm glad I checked it off the bucket list, but not sure I'd do it, again."
118,A Perfect Day,"Wow! What a history lesson this trip was. Additionally, the views from atop were magnificent. The turquoise waters are breathtaking. It was a cool, windy day so we didn’t snorkel, but other travelers (northerners) did and truly enjoyed the experience."
119,Best ever!,"Awesome snorkeling on the north side!  We saw so many different, colorful fish, and even a big tarpon. Word of caution--several jellyfish popped up, too, and the water was a bit murky the day we went... I can see how it would be easy to not see them until it is too late to get out of their way.  I can't comment on taking the ferry out, but we absolutely loved doing the seaplane ride.  It was pricey, but 100% worth it for the beautiful views, the speed of travel, and the overall experience."
120,Birthday celebration ,"Dry Tortugas is such a wonderful trip. Hollywood is an amazing guide. Kelly was an awesome bartender! Take the tour of the fort. It is wonderful,"
121,Yankee clipper to dry tortuga,"This place is special.  From the beautiful water, to the birdlife, to the history, to the snorkeling and beautiful sea life, to the quintessential quiet.  You MUST go here."
122,A great day!,"We loved this trip. We snorkeled and seen lots of fish, jelly fish , crabs and coral. The water was warm and clear. The fort was interesting to tour also. You had an amazing view from the top of the fort. The crew on the ferry were great. Bryan made amazing drinks on the way back. We made new friends and had a great time we won't soon forget."
123,Wonderful,"The boat crew (Hollywood and his band of merry makers) does a really nice job of keeping the guests informed about the park and they provide an informative talk as the boat makes its way out to the islands. Once on the island, the snorkeling was very good along the moat wall on both the North and South side of the fort. A very nice experience to get out to the Dry Tortugas and see what many people do not get a chance to see. Next time...camping in the Dry Tortugas!"
124,Fantastic trip!,"Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprized, a good mix of history and swimming plus a boat ride.  Saw lots of loggerhead turtles and flying fish on the way out.  It is a long ride, it was too much for most of the little kids.  The fort was amazing, both in size and the expense paid.  Why would the gov't pay for a fort in the middle of the ocean?  A lot of the people on our tour headed straight to the snorkeling and I'm sure it was amazing.  The swimming was very good, colder than I thought it would be, and so clear and clean!  Just a great way to spend my birthday in Key West!"
125,Outstanding!,"Historic camping outside a Pre civil war fort. No amenities but excellent snorkeling, a library,  a slide show of US Forts.  70 miles west in a 3 hr catamaran trip to and from the fort.  7 islands comprising the National Park.  Smooth ride on the Yankee Freedom ferry and the Fast Cat, no seasick feelings at all."
126,Excellent way to spend your day,"This was an amazing National Park.  I truly did not understand the significance of this site to qualify as a National Park so the tour was quite enlightening.  The history and location is so unique that it is worth the extra effort to get there.  Also, the beaches and water [including the snorkeling] were great."
127,A Must See,"It can be hot, it can be humid, and sometimes miserable, but there is no place like it. We visited and camped overnight twice. My favorite experience was snorkeling around the entire island. Sunsets are beautiful and the stars really stand out since there is almost no light pollution. History buffs can learn a lot, including a connection to the assassination of President Lincoln!"
128,Fantastic Trip,"Amazing staff especially Vinay he was extremly polite and friendly, great place and atmosphere, thank u"
129,Larger than imagined,This place is bucket list worthy. Get here any way you can. I can't wait to return someday. By boat or seaplane or swim if you must!
