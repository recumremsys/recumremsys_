0,Worth the walk up there,Nearly killed my husband walking from our accommodation!😂 Well worth it though as the views are amazing. Don’t do it in thongs!!!
1,Amazing view,"Always busy at the lighthouse and very limited parking so be prepared to park further away and enjoy the walk, its worth it!"
2,Great day activity ,"It is a quite steep climb but worth it! People were skydivers active also, really nice to see. You can walk further up to a viewing point but that is not really necessary."
3,Stunning Cape Byron Lighthouse,"Agree with what other fellow TA mentioned, it is simply beautiful.Don't drive all the way to the top as I can 99.99% guarantee that you won't be able to park there plus the fun is to walk your way up to the light house.Park at the bottom and leg it. It is a gentle easy walk. Enjoy the view there.Clean toilets. Cafe. Bring coins for parking 🅿. Be warned it is not cheap, but worth it."
4,Worth the walk,"It is a long walk, with many stairs but the view is so sure worth it. So a must do when in Byron Bay."
5,Best Views in Byron Bay,We came here late afternoon after a wedding renewal ceremony & it was just magical.  Beautiful views in all directions.  Whales breaching the ocean below the lighthouse.Great photo opportunities all around.  Don’t miss the spectacular Tallow Beach photo on the way back down from the road.Definitely worth a visit on a beautiful sunny day.
6,The icon of Byron Bay,Absolutely magical spot to go for a walk from the city centre. Steep climb but the views on the way up in the board walk and the views upon reaching are simply breathtaking. A must see if you’re anywhere close by!!
7,Just Magical ,Haven’t been here for years but it hasn’t disappointed the view is spectacular in all directions and it was a clear day nice place to stop and have a coffee and enjoy the view
8,Morning visit,Did the lighthouse walk with a friend one afternoon on a 3 day trip to Byron. Can highly recommend. It’s a hilly walk of course but very worth it and if you take the longer route its a nice wide clean path (the track through the woods is clear but messier so take sturdier shoes). You get wonderful views of whales breaching and of the bay from up there and it’s a great place to watch the sunset.
9,Amazing. ,Great walk with fantastic views. Cafe at the top is a bit crap - good for coffee and and ice cream thats about all. Better to eat at the one on the way up
10,Great views,This is certainly well worth the hike up to the lighthouse.... Amazing views and stood at the southern most point in Australia AWESOME !!!!!
11,Forever special,Lovely walk and view a must do. Take your runners and walk down to the most Eastern point! You have to pay for parking but you do everywhere
12,Awesome place,Nice to do the coastal walk up to the lighthouse! Make sure to catch the most eastern point of Australia’s mainland
13,A highlight of Byron Bay,"Don’t miss this place when visiting Byron Bay. Amazing views, lovely Cafe, nice walking tracks. A must go!"
14,Beautiful location! ,"Beautiful! If your in Byron , Cape Byron lighthouse is definitely worth visiting! Great views of the ocean and Byron :)"
15,Lovely spot with great views,Great to see don’t miss it! All buildings well looked after and easy walkways. Nice cafe with a view for lunch.
16,Great views,Walk up to light house moderately difficult but worth the effortGreat viewsWalking path from Byron all way down and around lighthousePerfect way to exercise for a few hours in the cooler weather
17,Magnificent view!,"We really enjoyed the views from the lighthouse! While it is quite the tourist attraction, it wasn’t too crowded and there’s an opportunity to take a great photo on every side of the lighthouse. The water is beautiful blue and, if you’re lucky, you may even catch dolphins or sea turtles."
18,Great views,We drove up for a sunset and walked up one morning (quite strenuous). Best views of Byron Bay and surrounds. We even saw whales blowing on their way south.
19,"Stunning views, great walk",Quite a hike up there if walking but well worth the view from up top bit of wildlife along the way nice little cafe up there as well can take a different route to come down which is a bit easier
20,You won’t be disappointed. It’s as good as it looks in photos,Visited Byron Bay Lighthouse which was being painted/restored but had one room for viewing. Great information inside.Decided to do the steps and walk down to the beach. Very easy walk down but a little tough on the way up being a rise of approx 95 metres. Well worth the effort and views.Would do it again.
21,Lighthouse ,The best view ever !You can watch all the turquoise water around the Cape !If you go to Gold Coast you can´t miss to visit there !
22,Stunning,A lovely place! Beautiful views and we got to see whales! Were really keen for the lighthouse tour (gold coin donation) however it was fully booked which was disappointing! Well worth a visit
23,Beautiful family walk,A bit difficult to achieve At the top as many other tourists are doing the same thing.Parking up the top was crowded and had to wait for a spot and pay $8.00. The alternative was a climb up the hill. The $8.00 is worthwhile. Parking attendant does a top job.The wander around the light house was good and yes there were whales.The small coffee shop on site is well overdue for a makeover to encourage visitors to stay awhile.
24,Worth the walk,The lighthouse is popular for good reason - it boasts the most beautiful view of Byron in my opinion. I must have walked up to the lighthouse trail a thousand times and still never get sick of the view. Sunrise and sunset are also great times to admire the sun rising above the ocean or setting below the mountains.
25,The beautiful Byron Lighthouse,"The Lighthouse visit was absolutely amazing! Would totally recommend to do the walk down to the cliffs and the beach, it's wonderful!"
26,Great,"This was an easy stroll with a couple of steep parts from Town of Byron Bay. Great views can be seen from the top. We also experienced sea turtles, rays, huge lizards and beautiful beaches on the way."
27,Best view of the coast,If you’re energetic you can hike to it. We drove. Worth the parking fee to see the fabulous views. There is a coffee shop so you can sit and relax taking in the views.
28,Nice and worth a look,Really nice walk around the lighthouse! Saw some whales! Make sure you bring bincoleours if you have them! Also don't miss the most western point of Australia!
29,Awesome,The views are stunning! But they do take some effort to obtain! Ensure you take a bottle of water and a hat. We took the scenic steps route on the way up and then the road on the way back down which was much much easier!
30,An energetic walk with a rewarding finish,"Not dog friendly. No point going. Too many backpackers! Hard to find parking. But, great view. Nothing more to say."
31,It is an icon - another one to tick off,Its worth the hike or drive up.Be very careful of traffic as road is very narrow and cars dont have much room to pass .
32,Ways Outstanding to Walk up,Just stunning. Well maintained and great history. Dissapointed the gift shop wasn't open though. But what a view of the east coast.
33,Australia most eastly point,I can’t rave on enough about Australia and the beautiful area sthe country has to offer. We did the Bryon bay lighthouse trail it’s absolutely tired us out so sensible shoes is a must. Very tiring and a lot of steps so not suitable for those with limited mobility or very young children unless your  to carry them for a while.
34,Amazing,Great walk along track but be warned the full walk is very demanding & feet were sore afterwards.Fantastic views from lookouts & lighthouse & great refreshing ice cream from the lighthouse cafe.A must do for the fit.
35,"Australia’s most easterly point - worth the walk, drive or ride with superb views in all directions ","What a spectacular view! However.... $8 to park for one hour only - if you’re lucky enough to find one. In that hour you can get a tour of the lighthouse... if there’s a volunteer available. The gift shop sells tacky and expensive souvenirs of questionable origin.However, those views are incredible and worthy of a 5 star rating except for the things previously mentioned."
36,A long climb but worth it,"My daughter and I walked up to the lighthouse, a little steep in places but the views are so worth the climb. You can choose to drive.Definitely worth a visit."
37,Amazing ,The lighthouse itself isnt anything to gawk at but the walk up is what you wanna hit! It will challenge you but worth it and theres plenty of vantage points for great snapshots!
38,Beautiful spot,Nice scenic walk to the lighthouse. The last part had lots of steps. I would recommend as a nice walk from Byron. I would advise 2 hours there and back.
39,Beautiful lighthouse and beautiful views,"The walk was lovely but if you have toddlers or seniors not accustom to walking you can drive up and park for $8 near the top, it does get full so you may have to wait a bit. The view was amazing from the top and the small lighthouse has some artifacts inside."
40,Simply stunning !,Was great for the kids the lighthouse tour is small but definitely worth it such a beautiful part of Australia to visit
41,Stunning views,"We did a couple of runs to the lighthouse early morning and late afternoon. Fabulous location and great to see the views on both sides into Byron , Julian Rocks and Tallows. The area around the lighthouse has plenty of space to sit and relax and enjoy the views. If you can get up go there to experience the sunrise. If you’re driving there’s a few parking spaces and an $8 fee. Also worth looking at the exhibition and history."
42,"Lovely tour, view, environment, everything! ","Beautiful views, got to see a pod of dolphins while we were there,a great walk to the point, can walk from the bottom or drive to the top and pay $8 parking, well worth it."
43,Wow what a view,Great walk and amazing view. Saw dolphins galore! Kids aged 9 and 5 loved it too. Would probably do it wearing closed shoes next time.
44,Absolutely stunning view!,Great views along the entire walk and once you get to the lighthouse. Bring sunblock and comfortable walking clothes/shoes.
45,Too crowded and not worth the price ,"Lovely day was had visiting the lighthouse. The crowds were light and there was plenty to see. It's a great end to walking the trail. Much better to walk the trail and end here than to just drive to the lighthouse. We enjoyed the small museum. Unfortunately, it was a day of youth tours, so we did not get a chance to see the views from the top of the lighthouse. Maybe next time. Since it doesn't cost anything, it's a good thing to do at least once while in Byron Bay."
46,View To Behold,I went up with my 5yr old and she and I really enjoyed the authentic tour. Was quick - not long winded and/ or too much info for kids! Then we walked around the top outside - views were beautiful!!
47,Spectacular.....but watch for parking inspector!! ,Cape Byron shows a stunning view of the coastline. Definitely worth a visit.Limited parking so you’ll have to hike a little to get to the top.
48,Great place to visit ,We didn't go in but the views are amazing - saw Dolphins and whales. It's a great walk - we went one way and back the other
49,Quite a hike!,Great walk from the town to the lighthouse around 5.30 am. Nice exercise and truly amazing sunrise !!!
50,Such a landmark ,"We have just got back from this walk and we are in our 60’s, it is a long walk of 5-6 kilometres or more. The walk is best with trainers on and if it is a hot day go by the tree lined walkway and steps on the right across the road as it is more shaded.  It is a long walk with lots of steps so beware as it is hard going.  We did it as we wanted to go to the most easterly point in Australia, it is where Captain Cook landed but named after his grandfather Lord Byron.  Good for historical buffs. Highly recommend if you are in the area as views are spectacular. There is car parks but you have to fight for a space as there is not that many and also not for anyone in a wheelchair."
51,Beautiful ,If you are in Byron this is a must do walk. We strolled along the beach from Byron and then up a path to the right and then just followed the track right round the headland. It’s steep in places so maybe wear trainers. The views along the way are wonderful. We saw plenty of whale spouts as we went too. There’s a cafe at the lighthouse and then the walk back follows a lovely ridge through the forest back to Byron. It’s about 5 miles / 8km though you can drive up there too - but leave the car and take a walk!
52,Brilliant views,walked to the lighthouse from central byron bay along the beach and then up the path/stairs.its quite hard going but worth it once you get there. the views are amazing!!
53,Unreal views,"This is the most easterly point of Australia and well worth the visit just for the views... simply stunning.  If you see dolphins and whales that's a bonus. Parking, if available, is $8 up at the lighthouse or there's metered parking on your way up. Tours inside the lighthouse give great insight into the life of a lighthouse keeper as well as the inner-workings of a lighthouse. Cafe on site serves great coffee."
54,Great lighthouse to visit,Rewarded with Fantastic views on a long climb to the lighthouse. Cafe at top then less structured path. Trainers advised.
55,To hot for a view at the top,Get up for sunrise well worth the visit. You could struggle for parking and if you park in the lower space you need to pay. Otherwise walk up
56,Really worth a visit,"As always, the sunrise view from the lighthouse is nothing by spectacular. Only issue was the parking, need to be there early in order to find a park!"
57,Top of the hill,"Iconic Cape Byron Bay lighthouse and claim to visiting the most far Eastern peninsula of oz 😬 is well worth a visit ! That is, if you can find a carpark nearby or take the long leisurely walk from the base (recommend drive/visit early morning or midday when less crowded). Previously visited here late afternoon (sunset most specular but oh so hectic !).This time it was long weekend and a Friday so avoided mid-morning crowds. Also,  lucky enough to score a park from of  lighthouse - Whoohoo ($8 for approx. just over an hour visit due parking restrictions) so had enough time for a visit to cafe (snacks and milkshakes were great whilst admiring views) and proper wander around to take in nature’s views! If time permitting, join lighthouse tour with volunteers as they are great - shares insight to life of local keepers (cost of hair a small gold coin donation) or go for bush walk down to the furthest east of Australia cliff walk .. pretty spectacular once you get down there .. the walk back up all the stairs not so much lol but worth the visit if you are a nature lover ! We did both and well worth than my last visits of taking a happy snap/drive by 😬Worth the visit if you can when in Byron Bay and highly recommended !"
58,Sunset ,I didn’t expect it but somehow I was able to see whales there. The lighthouse is beautiful and also it’s possible to see inside. This place is worth visiting I suggest.It was weekday but there were lots of tourists !
59,great,"Really nice walk to reach the phare /from the phare along the coastTakes up to 2h to do the walk, you can't visit the phare but you get a really great view"
60,Such a beautiful Place ,Nice lighthouse. Had morning tea at the cute cafe and a wander around.Was very busy despite us being there before it actually opened.
61,Lovely Lighty,We walked up to the light house each day while on hols in Byron.  The view is spectacular.  Its a great way to start the day.  Approx 40 mins each way depending on how fit you are.
62,Iconic landmark near the most easterly coastline of Australia ,we went for a Beautiful walk up to the lighthouse then back down to get our bike's @ clarks beach then went for a bike ride around byron  then out for lunch somewhere maybe or a swim first
63,Spectacular views,Well worth the walk up to the Lighthouse! Iconic Byron activity. Saw whales and dolphins gliding through the waves.
64,Splendour,"the place is so wonderful and awesome. though it rained when we went there, the view is still instagrammable."
65,Beautiful views,Highly recommend the lighthouse walk!! Love the views and the feel! Can’t wait to go again! A must do! Even on a misty morning!
66,Wonderful view,Loved the view. There is a cafe there as well. Nice walk down to a cute beach. You can park near the lighthouse for free if you have the national parks sticker on your car.
67,Worth The Time . .  !,If you are wanting to see the Byron Lighthouse I would highly recommend parking at the cark parks at the bottom of the roads (about 2k from the lighthouse) and do the scenic walk. Some amazing views to be had but take a good pair of shoes as it is quite hilly but well worth it!
68,Awesome views !,Beautiful walk overlooking the many beaches in Byron Bay. Took us 1.5 hours round trip from Byron Bay centre.
69,Leave the car and walk,Well worth walking up to the lighthouse even if you haven’t got a car - parking gets pretty busy. Amazing views from the headland
70,Guided tour,"Nice lighthouse, very pretty and surrounded by cliffside  along with the spectacular surroundings of Byron Bay."
71,Not dog friendly ,Definitely worth a visit if you are in Byron Bay. The views make this a worthwhile stop. Have a drink or snack at the top and soak in the views and sun.
72,Very scenic walk,"Great walk with family. Started at captain cook carpark, nice climb to the light house through the bush. Return via the point and along the beach. First part of track need shoes then down on the beach is was nice to walk in the surf. Go to end of point beyond lookout as the rock formations we're very cool."
73,Evening walk to the Lighthouse,Such a beautiful walk to the most eastern point of NSW and I see whales and dolphins every time! Its very special
74,Stunning views,"My partner and I parked in a park about 2km from the lighthouse. It was a steep walk would recommend having covered shoes on. Very up and down, took us an hour return to do the 4.5km. Very scenic walk and worth it."
75,A good hike,The hike on a hot day is amazing and what a special view. There a quite a lot of stairs and luckily a few spots to take a break.
76,Scenic Path to the Lighthouse,Beautiful walk and spectacular panoramic view! Be sure to drive there if you can and bring your swimmers to go for a dip after you do the trek to and from the lighthouse. A must do whilst in Byron! it's not everyday you can say you've been to the most easterly point in Australia.
77,must do the FREE lighthouse tour,"Perfect for whale watching easy access from wategos beach.stunning outlook must do whilst in Byron , most eastern point if Australia :)"
78,Uphill,Love this place! The views are amazing and the lighthouse gift shop was fun to look through. Will visit again of course ❤️
79,Well worth the walk. ,"I can't believe they are charging $8 to park here! If you have a elderly person with you who can't do the longer walks to get there, you are forced to pay $8 for parking at the top. Seems like everywhere in Byron Bay they are trying to make money with their parking fees. Driving from one place to another, if you are stopping & getting out, more parking fees to pay. I don't know where the money is going, but it seems not back into the roads as they are full of pot holes & are so rough. Whilst the place has great views I won't be going back in a hurry."
80,Great little walk,"Really worth making it up to the lighthouse, there are many different pathways up.The view is great, and we saw a fair few whales from the top."
81,Amazing!,Enjoyed the quick visit and regretted not climbing to the top of the lighthouse but recommend a visit to it. Only negative would be limited parking at the lighthouse so maybe park further down the road and walk the rest.
82,What a Beautiful part of the world,Grey place - lovely cafe opens at 9.Really pretty viewWe scored a carpark at the top 😀Costs $8 to park and you get 1 hour ( which is fine). Google on maps there are about 3 car parks that get closer and closer ( small ones) and one is at the lighthouse itself - maybe 20 spots or so.
83,Lovely walk and view,This place is beautiful just 6km from the main beach. I loved. Easy walk for all ages. The views are amazing 😍🤩
84,Vistas! ,"Defiantly worth a look, such an amazing place. You can party down near the beach and there is a great walk up to the lighthouse!"
85,Amazing view,"Beautiful views. We drove and parked a few mins walk away which you had to pay for ($4 per hour). Lovely walk and views - easy trail and great lookouts. No whales at this time of year, but lovely all the same. Ended with coffee and ice creams at the cafe."
86,Lighthouse at sunset,It would pay to walk up to the lighthouse as parking at the top is limited and if you do get a park it's $8 there's not a lot to see but the view back to Byron is very good it's a busy place to go unless you go in the morning or later in the afternoon in the morning the sunrise is magnificent and worth the walk there is parking halfway up or the best parking is just on the way down
87,Lighthouse,Nice views but like everything else in Byron Bay they charge you to see it and it’s overpriced so if you must go there take my advice and take a packed lunch and stay awhile to get your moneys worth
88,Fantastic walk with amazing views,"We walked from the Pass to the Lighthouse and back on a Saturday morning. Can get very busy, recommend going early morning. It is quite steep in parts but only 1.7km in total. Take a bottle of water!"
89,Magnificent views,"Really lovely and scenic walk up to the lighthouse from Byron Bay, great views out to sea and incredible views of whales and dolphins. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Information in the small museum was also interesting. The walk is very steep and can be hard in the midday sun!"
90,Afternoon walk,Must go hike here for sunrise!!! This is the eastern most point of the Australian land mass and it was absolutely stunning to watch the sunrise from the lookouts points and the lighthouse. The lighthouse grounds are very well kept. The hike is a bit steep and can be pretty tough if you don’t leave enough time to get to the top!
91,Beautiful taste of Coast and Bush,"One can not visit Byron without the mandatory up to the Lighty!It is so iconic that you always have to get a photo there, even if you go each year!The views are forever changing with the seasons and weather but are always gorgeous.Parking can be a bit limited up there, and you have to pay for it.If you are energetic you can ride a bike or take a walking track up there.Toilets and a café at the top.Lots of lovely tracks from the Lighty going down to the most Easterly point in Australia.Whales can be spotted in migration season.Fabulous views.You can go inside the Lighty too for a look.One must go here!!"
92,Don't walk there at midday!,"A MUST when in Byron. On a clear day the views are spectacular.Worth the walk from the Carpark to the top and for the fitter amongst you, go all the way to the bottom. Remember, every step down, equals a step that must be taken back up."
93,Coffee after a challenging climb,I’ve been to at least 15 lighthouses in Australia and as lovely as this one is it wouldn’t be in my top 5. Still worth a look if in town. Paying $8 for parking is a bit rich though. But seeing whales close by was probably worth it
94,A room with a view. ,"I have to admit, the lighthouse offers stunning views and the view gets even better at sunrise and sunset. However, beware of parking fines - the lighthouse offers only limited parking (about 10 to 15 spaces) and I was travelling with a disabled passenger. Saw about 8 vehicles parked at the lighthouse in no stopping or no parking zones at 6am and stupidly thought that this would be okay.... found a $276 fine (and all the other 8 vehicles too!) - council ranger must have been sleeping in car nearby knowing that many drivers do this with minimal parking available. Anyway - I really enjoyed the view and despite the fine I do still love Byron Bay. Just warning anyone here - beware that parking is taken extremely seriously in Byron Bay."
95,Lovely ,Such a great view and so many whales frolicking.Recommend early morning or before sunset. Take a drink bottle.
96,Spectacular view ,From the town center this was a good hike with some chaklenging hills so take plenty of water with you. It was worth the energy as the views were fantastic and don't forget your camera.
97,Worth the climb,Just a 5 minute car ride to the top to a superb view of Byron bay and its adjacent bay. Only thing leave your car just a short walk from the top because they will charge you 8$ for parking at the very top.
98,You're always guaranteed the best view at lighthouse locations!,Absolutely wonderful views to be had from the White House at sunset. Make sure you are there at least 15 minutes in advance to get a great spot to see the sunset
99,Brilliant place to see,"Historic most eastern point of australia, very little parking at the top but some further down. Great view of the coast and sea"
100,Lovely lighthouse walk ,If you’re after a challenge for the day then put your sports/climbing shoes on and take a walk/climb to the Byron Bay Lighthouse. I was so glad to be able to relax at the top with a coffee and spectacular view before the fun of going back down again. I definitely don’t recommend tackling this with thongs on like I did four years before as it is certainly a steep climb at the top. This experience is a wonderful way to burn up the calories after all the delicious food you’ll be eating in Byron Bay.
101,Great views,"Not a stroll in the park, and some strenuous uphill sections, but well worth the effort and good way to spend a couple of hours if waking from Byron Bay itself. Take plenty of water and sun block even if cloudy as can change to sunny very quickly!"
102,It is just a lighthouse,The (volunteer?) guides at the lighthouse are fabulous. A wealth of information and so friendly. I did the free lighthouse climb with my 6 and 8 year old and it was informative and interesting. Stunning views.
103,Climb those steps!!,Went there  a few times over the years the view can be different depending on the weather but well worth seeing & walking up the incline of the hill which could be a daunting for the elderly.
104,Amazing views,"We spoke about the lighthouse walk for weeks before we went. The views are sensational. We discovered that there is the straight route without the stairs (not signposted btw) which is at the point you see a sign that says left 1.4 km. This 1.4km route hugs the coast more and entails lots of steps. You walk through Wategos area which is gorgeous. You don’t need to be very fit but be prepared for a steepish ascent. Views on top worth it. You are at the most eastern point of Australia. There is toilets, water taps and a tea garden on top. You could drive but seriously worth the walk."
105,Amazing view in Byron Bay,"Nice spot, great views but parking is at a premium and with a $8 price tag thought it was a bit rich"
106,Byron Lighthouse,"always worth the walk for the views but if your feeling a little lazy, drive up and relax with a coffee to recharge..."
107,Fabulous guides,"Outstanding views. As stated by most reviewers it is just stunning. We did drive right to the top expecting lots of car parks, but it is very limited, around 15 cars at once and $8. I would suggest parking at the car park halfway up and walking, if able."
108,A wonderful walk around the cape,"Beautiful sunrise view, and the Light House, the path way and the Easternmost tip of mainland Australia was worth a visit."
109,Amazing views and yummy gelato,"My family and my friend family visited here during school holidays,we are very disappointed with parking facilities It’s very buzy place during school holidays Limited parking near light house.We parked our car more than 2 km far from light house and walk all the way from there with little ones.It is very hard for elderly people and family with young kids.I suggest people if they travelling with elderly people or with kids drop them first near light house and come back for park your car."
110,Beautiful view ,This was a great little walk to round out the morning. There is plenty of stunning scenery to take in and a few option for a dip if you want to cool down.
111,Superb experience,You can walk from Byron or drive. The views are worth it but parking is very difficult. You can see a long way in all directions. We drive but the walk looked worth doing if you have time.
112,"Go , go ,go ","We made the drive up there just at sunset, what a sight, it was perfect a lovely sunset over mountains set us for a perfect evening. would highly recomend if you are into getting the perfect sunset shot :)"
113,Absolutely Spectacular,"Did this as part of our sunrise walk.  so beautiful and an icon of Byron.  We were lucky it was not too busy and to top it off, it is a wonderful spot from which to see whales if they are migrating"
114,Not to be missed,"The Cape Bryon lighthouse is a classic!  well maintained and beautiful to see and photograph, I think it is a ""Must do"" for Byron Bay.  Loved the trails coming and going, plus the Easternmost point in Australia, beaches, overlooks and the like."
115,Fantastic walk!,Walked all the way up to the top of the lighthouse amazing views all along the way. Nice little cafe there on the top and the volunteers who work here as guides are really knowledgeable and interesting worth the walk
116,Nice place to visit,Spectacular place to visit especially if you are looking for a physicl workout. Lots of pathways to explore. Great little cafe at the lighthouse. Parking is $8/hr but worth it if the hard trek upp the hill is too physical for you.
117,Beautiful view with limited parking ,The view is spectacular but recommend walking not driving as there is not enough parking. During the Blues Fest. The cafe is very limited and the table height is very low.
118,Great spot to visit ,"Very interesting to read about the history, the lighthouse keepers and their families. Great ocean views, saw a pod of dolphins. Parking is at a premium, so best to go early or expect to walk a bit of a distance."
119,Beautiful spot,"As good a view as you will get from any similiar lighthouse.But parking, seriously.Spoilt by a greedy green Byron Bay Council who are keen to take your money and give you nothing.Similiar to paid parking all through Byron.Not the Byron I remember growing up.....   🤔"
120,Worth a Look,Lovely scenery. Lovely walk all over the area. Fantastic to see the whales in the ocean as well. Great spot to visit.
121,Amazing view from Cape Byron Lighthouse,Tricky for parking but worth it to see the fabulous coast on both sides plus the school of dolphins playing below.
122,Not to be missed,Such a pretty spot to see an expanse of coastline from the south right around to the north. Quite spectacular when the weather is a little wild. There is a small museum with information inside the lighthouse.Several walks lead down from the lighthouse to take in different views.They see lots of wales from here - check out the internet for best viewing months...There is a coffee shop up here too but would be super busy on weekends - go for arvo tea during the week for the best seats.Parking up the top is $8hr but lower down is $4 an hr (not many parks avail so go midweek!).This is a must stop place if in the area 😊.
123,Fantastic,"Go to the top of the lighthouse to see the great views of the mountains, beaches either side, inland over Suffolk Park and Byron. I went to the top although I'm absolutely terrified of heights and shake non-stop, so didn't venture out of the door but my partner did and took the photos for me! The information inside the lighthouse is really interesting too. You get to have a drink, snack or tasty ice cream there too!"
124,"Bring coins for parking, beautiful view",The views from the lighthouse were amazing. A little sad that because of the time(after 5pm) we were there the cafe and gift shop were not open.
125,Nice,I'm sure its gorgeous at any time of day but with having jet lag we were up & out nice and early and caught the sunrise from the lighthouse. We were also lucky to spot some whales.
126,Absolutely breathtaking...,"Beautiful lighthouse and view. Great 180 scenery. Feels like you Can see the entire ocean, majestic view! Must go if you’re in Byron. Parking costs $8. Parking man was very helpful."
127,A must do,"Such a good view , saw whales within a couple minutes of being at one of the many lookouts. Probably went there 5 times during our stay ."
128,Worth the Walk,"I walked up to the lighthouse, the views were breath taking and often you can see dolphins swimming below. The lighthouse has a café on site and a small free museum where you can go and read the history of the families and history of the lighthouse. A must go and do."
129,Beautiful,"My husband and I had a lovely morning visiting the lighthouse. After 9am you can visit the museum and get some free tickets to the lighthouse tour! Please make a donation to help maintain this beautiful landmark. The volunteers are extremely helpful, lovely, friendly and have so much knowledge about this place. There very passionate for their work, and visitors can see that. The little museum explains a little about the Byron bay wildlife, the history of this particular lighthouse and Byron bay history too. It's a must do!!On the day we were visiting the last tour was done at noon, so make sure you arrive early. And maximum 10pp per tour. Kids under 5 can't go as on the top there are no nets and the wall is high, so they wouldn't be able to see the view and it's dangerous to level them up."
130,Great view ,We did a morning walk from the centre of Byron Bay (ca 10km in total) to the Lighthouse. It was a nice but heavy walk (we did the path with the stairs).
131,Great views!,As probably the most iconic tourist destination in Byron you would think council would invest in this opportunity ...The road leading to the lighthouse is littered in potholes and patch work repairs When you reach there are prob only 25 car spaces and barely any room to turn back causing grid lock If a space is available they sting you $8 to visit the natural coastline - another Byron bay council cash grab The mobile phone tower nestled on the drive up is covered in graffiti The lighthouse and surrounding coastline is magnificent - such a shame
132,Must visit,Great drive up and worth a stop for a relaxing time looking out to see. Parking at top is $8 a car. Viewing areas are amazing and cafe looks nice but we didn’t eat there.
133,One of the must see in BB,"Unless you want a long tramp, I wouldn't bother. There's parking issues at all levels. Parking charges too. But the older parking attendant at the top level is lovely and chatty and ensures that you get a good paid spot."
134,The Lighthouse Light's Up Your Day!,What an amazing lighthouse. Such a senic walk and view. The tour guide who showed us inside the lighthouse (Barry) was fantastic and so very good answering all the questions my 7 year old son had for him.We will visit again
135,Authentic and magical views ,fabulous views of the coast of  Bryon Bay and surrounds. Light house no longer has any historic items and the obligatory souvenir shop grossly over priced as is the $8 parking fee to view the lighthouse.
136,Nice views,"Get up early (ish) and do the beautiful coastal walk up from ""The Pass"" to the Lighthouse. You very likely to see pods of Dolphins ""surfing"" with the locals at Wategos or Tallows beach.I Its a spectacular walk."
137,Byron Bay lighthouse,Lighthouse was amazing! Amazing views of the sea. Even got to see a whale playing about. Was very windy but there is a cafe there. Costs $8 to park but worth it if you get to see whales!
138,Great Views and Walk,One of the nicest things to do in Byron! We walked up at 530am to see the sunrise. Very pretty and great walk! You’ll go past a lot of local beaches and lighthouse looks great in pics
139,Lovely views. ,"We went in November - I would hate to go there at peak times. The car park at the bottom (a 1.7km hike) was almost full so we took the chance to drive to the top as we had been told there was limited parking there (there are a couple of disabled places at the top) Our luck was in as a Japanese group were leaving one of the spaces as we approached. It is only an hour for parking there so it was a bit of a rush to see everything but worth it. Fabulous views from the most easterly point in Australia, a hike down from the top to the shore for the more intrepid if you have the time looked interesting! Byron Bay left me cold, but the lighthouse was worth the detour."
140,Whale of a time,"Suggest you walk, if you want to see it, in saying that the views at places like Yamba are no different except you don't get slugged $8 to park for an hour"
141,Great walk,A must-see when in Byron Bay. Short walk up the hill to the lighthouse. Very crowded but great views.  Lots of walkers/joggers use it as a regular route.
142,great views,"We drove all the way to the lighthouse, cost $8 for a car park. Worth it as the walk looks like a trek. Beautiful old lighthouse, very well maintained. Worth going inside to look at the history, very interesting. Has some short tracks to walk around with all of them having spectacular views looking over beaches, cliffs and back over Byron Bay. Well worth a visit if you're in the area."
143,Good scenery ,Great work out. Plenty of steps! People were doing it with babies strapped to their backs (crazy!!). I’m fit and definitely got my heart rate up. Don’t wear thongs. Great views.Must do.
144,Beautiful Lighthouse and view.,My friend and I did an early walk to the lighthouse and had a great morning. Refreshing walk and good exercise. Plenty of steps - which I’m not a fan of!! But well worth it for the views.
145,Afternoon look,The walk to the Lighthouse is awesome. It is quite long and a tough with many stairs but worth it. The view along the walk is breathtaking and worth the effort.
146,Nice view,"I joined in a tour as I had wanted to visit the lighthouse. It stands majestically for all to see. Inside are old artefacts, photos and stories alike. You can climb the 71 steps to the top. But unfortunately my tour group departed earlier than expected so I didn’t get to enjoy this  experience. There is a walkway down the beach. Next month you can see the whales. But we did see a small pod of dolphins. The cafe was open and had a good selection of food. Sadly the souvenir shop was closed for stocktake.   Definitely a great place to visit - just need more time here than an hour"
147,What a view,"We did the walk up to the lighthouse on a cloudy day.This did not change the amazing views from the walk up.Glimpses of the ocean through pandanus and native bushland makes the walk so worth it.The walk up is fairly steep and you need good walking shoes and plenty of water..Plenty of places to rest on the way up so you can take your time and take in the views, as you go...We didn't see any dolphins or whales due to the weather conditions, though it is so worth it just for the views.."
148,Fabulous Spot,Unbelievable traffic on a terrible road that is obviously never maintained to get to the top and have absolutely no parking and if you do manage to find a car park you get charged an EXORBITANT $8 to spend 10 minutes being windswept.
149,Must see in Byron bay,"Worth the trip to Byron Bay on its own. If you ever doubt what a beautiful coastline we have then here's a place of beauty to remind you. Whales a plenty to be seen migrating as well as pods of dolphins and a coastline that is just spectacular. What more could you ask for. The lighthouse tour is worth doing for a gold coin donation. Parking is the only problem. Unless your first in at the top parking, especially if your mobility impaired, is problematic. There are currently no designated disabled parking spaces and parking in the lower parking areas makes ascension difficult. All parking is $8 for an hour but people often stay well past the allocated time. The walkway to the point is worth doing. There are frequent lookouts along the way each with their own beauty. There is also a cafe for a coffee with a ""view"". The lighthouse is very well maintained. For me the experience was majestic."
150,Awesome view,"I visited on a Saturday lunchtime having walked the route up from Byron Bay - not a difficult walk, but in the heat of the day one to take steadily.The views along the route are very pretty and the route was busy but not so busy that it detracts from the scenic area.At the top I decided to take the tour in the lighthouse, there are a couple of rooms in the base with some interesting exhibits about the lighthouse and the need for it in the area as well as information regarding the working routines of the lighthouse before it was automated. The volunteers in the lighthouse were friendly and gave an interesting tour up to the top (this is free but they do ask for donations). While at the top our guide spent some time pointing out the whales and dolphins that were visible in the water below as well as landmarks that can be seen.Definitely worth the effort of the walk, great to spot wildlife along the way. There is limited parking at the top. There are toilets and a cafe at the top."
151,Quick visit with family,Lovely picturesque instagrammable place. During peak seasons difficult to par near by so better catch the walking trail
152,Amazing views,"Make the time to walk up the bush trail to the lighthouse from Lee Lane rather than drive. You can leave your car there. The lighthouse is majestic and the views up and down the coast are mesmerising. At the moment you can spot whales heading south. Take the Wategos Beach track back, stop at all the lookouts, checkout the surfers and further along the excellent track have lunch at The Pass cafe. Follow the path back to your car for a satisfying day out."
153,Always worth a visit. ,No parking!  Drove up 3 days and drove down again. Leave the car at Wategos Beach and take the walking track. Easy walk to Lighthouse.  Great view.
154,Lovely even when raining ,"Had a walk to the lighthouse which was a bit of a trek, lots of stairs! And made it in time to watch the sunset. Beautiful location, worth a visit"
155,Amazing views,A very enjoyable coastal walk. We visited Cape Byron Lighthouse to watch the sunset. It was an easy 45 minute walk from the town with lots of photo opportunities. Only issue was the lack of lighting on the boardwalk when descending after sunset.
156,Very interesting!,Long walk but enjoyed every minute uphill and down all the way to the lighthouse   Stayed for a tea and and a tour
157,Gorgeous views and Whales,The East most point of Australia and a bucket list to do if visiting. Excellent views and wslk. Recommend parking at Wategos as no need to pay to park and heaps of spotss
158,Lovely! ,"An amazing spot to go to and a must to do for all visitors. The views over the beaches and out to the hills behind Mullumbimby are just beautiful. Look down into the ocean and you will regilarily see pods of dolphins surfing and playing, breathtaking."
159,Outstanding views but beware of parking,Great place to visit- car parking right at the cape ($8) but saves the walk - could have admired the views for hours - out of season visit so quieter than in the height of the season but glorious weather when we visited. A great time to spot migrating whales heading North - easily visible from the shore when we visited - also Australia’s most Easterly point- A MUST DO
160,Amazing view ,"If you planed to visit Byron bay, I would recommend Cape Byron is one place to see the scenery.The day I visited, it was very windy; however, I still enjoy the beautiful view of this area."
161,Amazing sunrise views ,"The lighthouse is a must when you go to Byron Bay! It is worth the drive up to the lighthouse and pay the $8.00  for parking. The views are stunning and gorgeous!! Could have spent all day there taking in the view. You can tour the lighthouse, we did not we went into the museum which was interesting. There is a small restaurant and gift shop up there too."
162,View spectacular,We parked a tad down the hill for free and finished the short walk up .   Go early or late to get a parking space.   It is worth it !
163,wonderful views of most eastern part of Australia-many whales,"Nowadays, seeing and standing up at the lighthouse is really the main reason to visit Byron. Unless you are a Yuppie or the new ""äspirational class "" and you can swan around town and pubs and crowds!!The views are magnificent, the lighthouse and buildings well maintained."
164,Awesome walk with wildlife views ,There is nothing bad you can say about this place. It is beautiful. The lighthouse itself is nice but it is the surrounding area that compliments it. We saw whales in the water so we were very lucky to be there at the right time. Don’t miss out of seeing it if in the area.
165,Stunning views and well worth the climb,Well signposted walk on good tracks and boardwalk and sturdy steps. Loads of places to enjoy the views including the most easterly point on Australian mainland. Views from top were amazing. Didn't go in to the museum though.
166,Stunning views ,"Best to visit this place early morning. We tried during the day but after driving up, had to drive right back....totally inadequate parking and organisation up near the lighthouse. We went back early next morning and were not disappointed!! Ample space to park and a view to die for. Beautiful lighthouse and stunning scenery."
167,Outstanding views,"Stunning views from the lighthouse area. Parking is tight, there is car parking half way up hill but very steep walk up especially when hot. Limited parking at top but attendant ensuring fair parking, pricey to park there, but I felt worth it. Grounds are well kept and clean."
168,Great walk and views ,When visiting Byron Bay a trip to the lighthouse is a must do- if you are feeling energetic walk or run up- there is a trail or drive up- you so have to pay for parking - the views are stunning from there.
169,Morning Walk,The view of Bryon Bay and the beach and ocean is amazing. The colour of the ocean is divine. If u are lucky you might see dolphins. You have to wait around for parking as lots of people and it costs $8 of you drive right up otherwise cheaper parking and then Walk up. Definitely a must do if in Bryon Bay!
170,Not for the faint hearted!,"It was a good walk up from the Byron Beach carpark.  A few places were pretty steep. We aren't super fit, but took our time and got there.  Stupidly, we were walking in the heat of the day so this walk would have been so much more enjoyable in the early am, or late afternoon.  Make sure you have sunscreen on!Cafe at the lighthouse was lovely, and the views were terrific (even with the bushfire smoke in the air)"
171,Steps for days,"Nice to walk up there, not the fittest person but you can take it slow or even drive up by car (parking fee)Quite touristy, next time I would go earlier on the day.You'll have a great view from up there."
172,Lovely walk ,"This is one of the most beautiful lighthouses I've seen. Unfortunately it was pouring rain when we visited so we didn't enjoy it to the fullest, however it is worth the visit.You do need to pay 8 AUD of parking if you're taking your car, however there's no time limit. It was a bit hard to find a spot though - they have very few spaces, and although there's a security gentleman controlling it, if there are no spots you need to wait until someone leaves. We waited about 20 minutes (we didn't wait at the parking, we were down the hill so I don't know exactly how much you would need to wait if you were waiting at the parking).We didn't have the chance to take the Lighthouse trail, however if you're into hiking I'm sure it is worth the walk as the sights were beautiful."
173,❤️❤️❤️,Visited on our last day. Glad we went. $8 charge for parking for an hour. So just enough time to spend going round Taking great photos. Little coffee shop serving coffees in pot cups not takeaway a nice touch.
174,Lighthouse walk,"Australia’s most easterly point and worth the walk, drive or ride with superb views in all directions"
175,Great view,It’s one of the must visit attractions if you visit Byron Bay. We went on a day where it was rainy so we were unable to do any walks or go up to the top in the lighthouse. The viewing spot about 300 mts from the lighthouse is also good to spot some dolphins. They have a little cafe and clean toilets. The lighthouse gift shop was a bit disappointing. They had very things related to the lighthouse more general stuff. The souvenir shop at the beach is way better.
176,Steep walk but worth the views!,"We drove to the top, not sure what to expect but like many others we were unable to get a car park in any of the car parks along the way as they are very limited for the amount of tourists. Expect a long walk from the lower car park but it was pleasant and challenging in parts. The view is breathtaking and we saw whales in the distance and pods of dolphins. The light house itself is spectacular and beautifully maintained. We stayed for lunch and enjoyed the food and views from the coffee shop. An ice cream for the walk back down is a great idea!"
177,Byron Lighthouse,This was my first time and I spent a few days in the area. What an absolutely gorgeous place to visit and spend some time. Did a lot of hiking and visiting Byron Lighthouse was breathtaking...definitely a must see. I hiked much of the time. Parking is definitely difficult during the busy time of year; Spring and Summer for sure.
178,Amazing walk from town up to the Lighthouse,Just don’t go at 3:30 when the place closes at 4:00. We rocked up only to be told by the volunteers who run the place that they had  escorted loads of people up that day and they were closing at 4 so tough. That was after they had to be asked because they were chatting amongst themselves. Explained we were visiting from Uk and even so no go.
179,Sunrise beauty ,"Great place to observe the Wales migration. It has spectacular views of Byron Bay. If you want to go for a walk, the bushwhacking to or from the beaches is very nice. Do not recommend the walking to toddlers and people with disabilities, as it has a lot of stairs."
180,The most beautiful view of Byron Bay,Amazing views lots of different walks to access. Very informative tours if you wish staff very helpful.
181,Great at sunset,The views are fantastic.   3 cafes and toilets along the way. Good chance of seeing dolphins or whales.  Visitor centre at the lighthouse informative.
182,Great views,Cape Byron Lighthouse is a working lighthouse and superbly maintained. A really interesting tour that explains the history and the current operation of the lighthouse.
183,One of my favourite places on earth,"The views on this hike are stunning. Be prepared... it’s a two hour round trip and there are extended uphill stair climbs but it is well worth it. Wear comfortable walking shoes, take water and a hat. We saw Whales, birdlife and beautiful views of Byron Bay. The lighthouse has a little museum with some interesting history. Make sure you return through the inland rainforest section (not the road) it is an absolutely stunning walk.  The temperature drops as you are shaded by the trees."
184,What A Wonderous View,"Spent a day trip to Byron Bay end of April 2019 and visited the Cape Byron Lighthouse. Plenty of car parks when we arrived. The lighthouse is very well-maintained and very nice-looking. You can actually go up to the top of the lighthouse to catch a bird-eye view of the entire Cape Byron. Against the clear blue sky and beautiful coastline scenery, you can almost get very photo shoot a nice shot. We actually spent around an hour at the lighthouse enjoying the coastline scenery and enjoying the strong blow of wind from the Pacific Ocean. Really nice...."
185,Great view but busy,"We originally drove up to the lighthouse, there is not much parking up there so we drove back down and found a spot at one of the lower carparks - all the parking is charged per hour. We walked back up the hill, it's a longish walk with amazing views along the coast - walking it really gives you time to soak up the view. The lighthouse is nice to look at and there is a cafe and gift shop to browse. We walked on to the most easterly point in mainland Australia which felt pretty special. The view from here looks back to town and up the coast the other way. We saw pods of dolphins in the water and watched them for ages. On a sunny day there is very little shade so sunscreen/hats etc are a good idea."
186,Breathtaking,"We were very dissapointed about the closure of the climb up the light house stairs. There were three volunteers present, who took no notice of us, and eventually one of them told us that we couldn't go up due to the hot weather. We left as we were astonished about the pathetic conduct of the so called volunteers."
187,whales and steps,If you are feeling fit and have energy to burn follow the track if not follow the road either way the views are rewarding and magnificent
188,Since 1901,"We took a 3 hour stroll around this walk and were thrilled to see plenty of whales, dolphins and even a turtle. The scenery was amazing. It was a bit much for our 8 yo but other than that we just loved it. This is honestly one of the best spots I’ve been in Australia"
189,Must Visit in Byron Bay!,Just gorgeous. I spent a week here and visited to watch sunrises and whale watching. Parking at sunrise can be tricky- it’s better if you can walk. It’s only about 1.5kms from Main Beach and evening in the dark there are plenty of people walking/running to the top.
190,Spectacular view point ,"Best views of the Australian coast, nice walkways and facilities.  Good guided tours and friendly staff"
191,Fantastic tour of the Lighthouse,"We walked to the light house but stopped at a near by beach,as it was a warmer day. It’s a lovely light house but once you’ve seen one you’ve seen them all"
192,Spectacular views - in particular for whales and the sunset,Was a nice drive then hike up to the lift house. Amazing views from the top. Cafe there also had nice snacks
193,"Excellent view from the top, great coffee shop.",We had a guided tour of the lighthouse - to the top. Viewed the marine museum and display. Can look for whales and dolphin in the bay. Good access and parking.
194,Stunning views,Highly recommend starting at the lower end car park and making the 35-40min walk along the coast line and then up to the light house for the most spectacular views and take the time to watch whales and dolphins splash about.
195,Fun place and small museum of fun,Parking is hard to find so you better off enjoy the walk around the coast and magnificent views. Stop at the pass cafe for acai bowl to get those calories/protein back and enjoy the views.
196,A great place to reset,We visited in the morning. It is $8 to park or free if you have a National Park Pass. We saw whales and dolphins. Had a great coffee and yummy treats looking at the magnificent view.
197,Amazing!,If you are visiting Byron Bay youMust visit Cape Byron Lighthouse We saw Humpback Whales and you can sit down and have a coffee
198,Opportunity missed.,"We parked within the compound of the lighthouse, & did a short walk through the bush land, and down the road back towards town. There are particularly stunning views across to Tallow beach. There is also a cafe & museum on the premises.If one had more time, & the weather is pleasant & cool, I would definitely walk around the coastline through Wategos beach.Recommended"
199,Spectacular Views,"Beautiful Lighthouse with a great walk leading to and from it. Amazing views, whale watching hot spot, sunrise hot spot etc. Plus a cafe and car park."
200,Stunning ,I rode to the lighthouse each morning on a recent stay in Byron. It's a bit of work riding up the hill but well worth the effort. It's great fun on the way down however. It is very peaceful of an early morning before the crowds arrive. A must see.
201,Stunning views,It’s a perfect walk from the bottom and not a hard walk at all. The vistas on the way up the hill are magnificent in a good day and even in a bad day. Defiantly worth a visit if your in the area. There is also accommodation in the light house. Very popular attraction.
202,Lovely walk ,The views are spectacular with the bonus of seeing whales and dolphins. It is great to be able to walk along the paths and have different vantage points to take some awesome photos. Must do
203,Views and history on well maintained tracks,A great spot to take in the views. Tours are a gold coin donation. So much information and history to read though.
204,Beautiful and well worth a visit,"We walked from town up to the lighthouse. It is quite a long way, about 3.2km each way, and very steep at times.Very scenic and you walk past famous Wategos Beach.The walk was great though and I would do it again!"
205,Great view,It's a great walk from the town along the beach and up amongst wooded tracks to the light house and then back along Watego's Beach and back along the woodland paths. There are excellent views and there's a cafe if you feel like a cuppa and snack. We saw many whales and dolphins and beautiful place to watch the sunset or sunrise. We also saw a koala:)
206,Iconic ,So beautiful walk up to the lighthouse if you're doing the Cape Byron walking track. Even though the sun wasn't shining and later on thunder was under incoming it was so worth it !
207,Fabulous view,"The views from the lighthouse make this a must do attraction when visiting Byron Bay. Sunrise at the lighthouse is beautiful, especially on a stormy day watching the clouds roll in. Just be aware that the upper car park doesn’t open until 8am so you’ll need to stroll up the hill to visit if you’re wanting to see the sunrise. Also the museum opens at 10am."
208,parking rort,Visiting the lighthouse and taking a walk to the eastern most tip of Australia was breathtaking.highly recommend.
209,Worth the walk,We walked to the lighthouse and when we arrived we were rewarded by dolphins and whales breaching. It was absolutely unbelievable. The views were spectacular!!!!!
210,"Peaceful, beautiful part of Byron Bay","Breathtaking view, amazing spot for that perfect capture. Head out there for a breath taking view and a perfect sunset."
211,Beautiful Cape Byron Lighthouse,"This still functional lighthouse over looks the most Easterly point of Australia. You can walk out to the point, visit the museum, stop at the Cafe or head up the lighthouse. The views and colour of the water was incredible. $8 to park up top or park down the bottom and walk up."
212,No parking - Byron council failure ,Incredible views of the Byron Bay area and right above a marine reserve filled with dolphins. You can watch the migrating whales passing by.
213,Sunset View,Loved the walk to the lighthouse. Our 2 year old loved all the steps. Best view and we got to see whales
214,Fab ,Highly recommend a visit......$8 to park and view but well worth it!! Most amazing views.....and a spectacular lighthouse!
215,A sunrise must,"Paid parking everwhere, with lovely maintained parking meters and parking inspectors with brand new vehicles but every road in Bryon is 3rd world or worse and the road to lighthouse is a total joke and dangerous. Everyone who comes to Bryon goes to the lighthouse and takes there life into the council hands with their total disregard for safety of tourists driving on that road.byron council wake up before there are deaths caused by these disgraceful roads."
216,Fix the roads ,"The walking track from Captain cooks Carpark to the lighthouse goes down to beach level and has lots of steps and is moderately steep in places as you climb up to the lighthouse. wonderful views... a moderate level of fitness required. It is possible to have a tour of the lighthouse, unfortunately a school had booked it out when we were there.. Very pleasant and informative lady in the lighthouse museum area. We spotted whales from this vantage point. We walked back down the road which more than halved the time it took on the track.. and no steps"
217,Picturesque walk with a stunning view from the top,We were lucky enough to secure a park at the top and were happy to pay the $8.00 fee in order to enjoy the stunning views. It is a lovely spot to visit and relax taking in the natural beauty of this area.
218,Beautiful old lighthouse. Awesome views!!!!,"We were lucky the day we walked to the Lighthouse, the weather was prefect. We were incredibly lucky to see many pods of Dolphins swimming and interacting with each other."
219,Beautiful views but very busy,Little parking and 8 dollars . Be prepared to wait for a parking place and can be a queue waiting . However the lighthouse and views are superb .
220,WOW!!!,We drive to the top and paid the $8 parking fee.  You could park a little further down the road and walk up.  The view is definitely worth it - fantastic.  Highly recommend a visit
221,Icon Byron Bay lighthouse - beautiful walk and amazing view  ! ,"There is no darth of beautiful light houses in Australia's east coast, however, with little doubt this one takes the crown. Two tips - 1) Visit during sunrise or sunset, it's magnificient. 2) take the lighthouse walk, it's worth way more than driving past"
222,Fantastic views,I was hesitant to make the effort but it was worth it. You have to pay to park at the top otherwisr you cant stop. The views are excellent and we could see whales not too far out.
223,Beautiful trek and so worth it!,we drove and paid parking at the lighthouse. the views are amazing. we walked out on the trail to the most easterly point of Australia. we saw turtles and two pods of dolphins. there are toilets which are clean. we had lunch at the cafe which was very nice and the two girls were very helpful with menu and advice on surrounding area. well worth a visit for the views
224,Stunning ,"A popular spot at sunrise on the eastern most point in Australia. Be prepared to walk from Watego's Beach and or the carpark as the main gates do not open early, but it is well worth it."
225,Beautiful view,"Well worth taking the time out to stop and admire such a beautiful place in the world, and some walking tracks to follow if your into that as well"
226,Parking probkem,We sat out for the sunset and did the boardwalk.  Well worth doing with spectacular views.   easy to get to
227,A must ,"Visited  on the lighthouse. Our legs got a good workout going up,but it was worth it.Watched the beautiful sunset,lucky it was a clear sky."
228,Probably the best in the east coast,"If you enjoy a bit of a walk and a little bit of a challenge this walk is well worth doing. You can take your time getting up to the lighthouse and stop along the way and enjoy the breathtaking views of the ocean. We saw a pod of dolphins swimming along and kayakers heading along to the light house as well. Beautiful spot up the top and there is a nice cafe at the top as well. Interesting to read about the history and life of a lighthouse guard, the responsibility they had was immense."
229,Amazing views,"... the lighthouse overlooks the beaches and town of Byron Bay. Come here after a leisurely walk from town (about 40 mins, comfy shoes are fine, the walk is paved or with wooden stairs) and enjoy the view and the sunsets. You could drive up to the light house in a car, fees apply. BYO or enjoy a sundowner at the cafe/bar. And bring your camera for the amazing pink-golden sunsets. If you’re an early bird, you could hike up before the crack of dawn and see the sun rise from Tally beach or eastern most point of Australia, just 5 mins walk from the lighthouse."
230,Definitely worth going to Cape Byron lighthouse ,"When in Cape Byron, one must do is the 3.7km walking track which offers spectacular views of the bay."
231,Amazing views,I had been wanting to get here for ages it was definitely worth the wait. The walk there and down is spectacular. The best time to visit is May to November to watch the whales
232,Cape Byron Bay,"As the National Parks website says, you’ll love this walk so much you’ll want to do it a second time! We ended up making this our morning walk for the last four days of our stay in Byron Bay. Although it is advertised as a Grade 3 and in parts challenging, it’s doable for older people and kiddies. Just take your time, stop and enjoy the view to get your breath back. In one of said stops we were entertained by a pod of dolphins 🐬 playing in waters of Tallow Beach. Would recommend taking swimmers as a swim at Clarke’s Beach at the end of the walk is a must do. And stop for a coffee at The Pass where there are excellent coffee and eats available. My photos don’t do the view justice as we did this walk during the Bush fires so the sky was clouded with smoke."
233,Great views!,"The views from this attraction, which is on the Easternmost point of mainland Australia, are beautiful. A must see.Do yourself a favour and visit the little museum in the lighthouse, which is staffed by knowledgeable and enthusiastic volunteers who are happy to share information about the lighthouse and local knowledge."
234,Lovely views,It is a winding trip up to the lighthouse. Be ADVISED you have to pay for parking. There is not much room to maneuver cars round. There is a walking track up but you would need to be fairly fit or take it slow.The view is wonderful and you can see in the distance the whales migrating depending on the time of year you go. We were there in Sept and they were traveling south.Definitely worth the trip it may take longer than you expect.
235,Spectacular Sunrise View,"Couldn’t get a parking space... straight in and straight out again. A bit like Byron itself, clearly a victim of its own success. Considering there was hardly any spaces I’m not surprised, but this wasn’t even during peak season and it was so busy. $8 just to park is also a joke but you’d be lucky to find somewhere to anyway!"
236,Amazing views ,Very scenic and interesting visit. Includes a lookout where we saw some whales. Small museum in the lighthouse and regular tours of the lighthouse available. Cafe onsite with a great view. Small car park run by National Parks at a cost of $8.
237,Worth a walk ,"We took the costal track from our hotel outside of the town along the beach and then up onto the headland. a reasonable level of fitness is required as the track is steepish in place. However, it is mostly made up with boardwalk. There are toilets on the way and a couple of cafes - we stopped at the Pass on the way down for lunch which did a nice meal. The view from the top was great over the Pacific and we saw dolphin pods and six whales - it was migration time. We returned the following morning to see sunrise as it is Australia’s most easterly point - it was a great sight and one not to be missed on a clear day. The overall round trip from Elements of Byron where we had been staying took 5 hours."
238,Beautiful lookout,"A definite must-visit when in Byron - the carpark at the top costs $8, highly recommend if you don't have time to do the full walk .. money well spent! There's the lighthouse + surrounds to check out, but also a walk down to the cape as well as a bay and various look outs. We spotted a big pod of dolphins on our way down to the cape - didn't see whales though which was a bummer! We timed it well with a free lighthouse tour running, note kids must be 5+ and you need to have 1/2 hour available to do the tour. Learnt a lot on the tour & my goodness what spectacular views from the top of the lighthouse! We were going to dine at the cafe onsite but it was quite pricey so we opted to drive down to the beach for a yummy feed.Such a cool spot, make sure you check it out."
239,Breathtaking sunrise ,The Lighthouse is a must for visitors to the region.  The most easterly point in Australia with 360 degree views.  Hang gliders can be viewed closely and tours through lighthouse can be made.  Cafe and souvenior shop on site with historical information and sighting excellent.
240,Towering high over the bay...,The view at the top is world class but the walk from The Pass through rainforest canopies and open coastal paths is equally spectacular. Whales spouting but not breeching but saw a pod of dolphins close up.
241,Hard to park and a long walk,"We headed to the lighthouse for some time out. Such an amazing day! We saw numerous whales, a pod of dolphins (at least 19) and two sea turtles! I tried to grab photos but they are super hard to see on a phone but so many people had digital cameras and I’m sure they got some amazing shots. We spent a couple of hours sitting at the point watching the ocean and the other visitors."
242,Just Beautiful,"The Byron Bay Lighthouse is iconic for Australia as it’s the most easterly point of Australia.The walk to the Lighthouse go through the National Park where I was able to see a large blue tongue lizard, as Wellers a local Wallaby that was eating on the side of the steps each time I walk to the Lighthouse which was four times in a week.The Lighthouse is really worth seeing at sunrise something that I remember for a long time. It’s also worth visiting at sunset.The walk has many steps great for those people wanting to do the 10,000 steps and I recorded 57 floors on my pedometer.Can’t wait to come back and do it again!!"
243,Walk to the top worth it,"Great panoramic views of the surrounding coastline, with easy walks in the adjacent bush and suburbs. Passing whales were easy to see on their trip back down south."
244,It's a nice walk,The views alone are something else but are made more spectacular if you take the free tour to the top of the lighthouse.Amazing how the built the prisms that came all the way from the UK in bits. then assembled on site. If you visit you must take the free tour and look at the magnificent 360 degree beauty from the tip of the cliff.  Take some money for parking as that is not free.
245,Terrific Views ,A 20 minute free tour of Cape Byron lighthouse was excellent. The tour was informative with a very friendly guide and the view from the top was magnificent - well worth the 71 step climb. I strongly recommend this short tour if you are at Cape Byron.
246,Hard climb but rewarding,"We flew in from Sydney arriving at the Ballina airport caught a bus to the Byron Bay Resort arriving at about 1:00 o’clock. On our flight we set beside a lovely gentleman Terry, from Byron Bay and when we ask him what was the number 1 thing in Byron Bay to see was the lighthouse. So we had the hotel staff call us a cab and $20 we were just a short climb to the base of the lighthouse. Spectacular views all around.  We enjoyed reading and studying all the equipment that was used to make the lighthouse function from years gone by. We had not paid any attention to the tour times and when we decided to climb the 77 steps to the top the last tour had left.  We where extremely disappointed.  We continued to tour the rooms surrounding the tower, enjoying everything very much and then all of a sudden Christine a volunteer came over to us and said come with me and I will give you a personal tour to the top. We could not express our gratitude enough.  What a windy spectacular view.  We then toured some of the buildings that had been the homes of those who had worked there. One thing we would recommend is in one of these buildings is a video on local birds, we found the narration and pictures fabulous. Thanks once again Christine.  $20 later we were back at our hotel after visiting the number 1 spot in Byron Bay"
247,awesome view,It was always going to be a little bit far from town to walk up here so we brought the car and were glad we did.With fantastic views in all directions this was a splendid place to just take a few minutes and enjoy the scene. A real delight and so peaceful.
248,Suntise,We chose to go to the lighthouse on the windiest day of our holiday. We would definitely recommend a visit to see some of Byrons history. After you take in the incredible views and take a look through the lighthouse there is a small gelato bar that is great to top off to the experience with some of the best gelato you’ve ever had.
249,Must do walk around the coast and sun rise.,"Have to pay to enter unless you walk up.  Even if you do elect to drive, don’t count on being able to park.  That said landmark location, worth visiting if you haven’t been before."
250,Worth the walk,"If you don't want to do the walk up to the lighthouse, there is some paid parking available but competition is fierce and personally I think walking is less stressful than fighting for a parking spot! The keepers house and cafe are nearby, with toilet and drinking fountain facilities. Take some binoculars to look for dolphins (or whales if you're there at the right time of year)."
251,Amazing views ,What an amazing family day out! I’ve always wanted to go to Byron and thought we would do a day trip! The lighthouse was beautiful! We did the tour for the gold coin donation and had a lovely man Graham give us the tour! I would definitely recommend!
252,very cool lighthouse,A good destination due to its position as the Eastern most point of the Australian Mainland. The downside is the parking charges they impose on you when you get there.
253,Amazing! ,"Must see, period.  The hike down to the beach, the whales, the dolphins, the waves, the views...a total highlight.  I can’t really say enough, mother nature takes the cake on this one but don’t miss it."
254,Climb the heights and see the sights,We went  to Lighthouse at night. Just magical definately worth a visit. Cant drive all the way up to park but only 5 min walk. Take a torch.
255,Amazing,We decided to go up here around 17:30 on our last night. It was a beautiful clear night. We chose to drive up most of the way as we had our 11 month old with us in stroller and the hill would have been quite challenging in the afternoon heat. We parked at the “P” just a few minutes walk away as it only costs €1-2 for about 30-45 minutes time. If you go all the way up it can cost you €8 to park. We saw a park ranger checking on that so be careful. The view was fantastic. My husband walked further to the furthest point as I stayed with my son. This walk was not possible with a stroller.It’s a great view but you don’t need long here. And go early morning or late afternoon!
256,Never fails to impress - even on an overcast day,You can’t stay in Byron without visiting the lighthouse. If you can be there to watch the sun rise across the ocean then that might just be something you’ll never forget.
257,A Good Place To Visit,The displays housed at the base of the lighthouse are extremely interesting especially the families historic recounts and there is more to look at in the National Parks area now. The walk along the cliff face is always spectacular and I have never been out there without seeing a special bird or sea creature. We are so fortunate that this area is so accessible. Parking can be tricky at times but well worth the visit.
258,Worth the visit,"My family visited this lighthouse on Thursday, 19 September 2019. This structure was built using prefabricated concrete blocks, back in 1901.There are two parking areas available. It is best that you park your vehicle near the lighthouse itself.The view and scenary from this area were really spectacular."
259,Great view point of Byron,"The views along the trail and up to the lighthouse are outstanding. The road is fairly steep and winding, but it is worth the drive or walk along the trail. The lighthouse was great to walk around and is a feature for Byron Bay. There is a cafe open for drinks and light snacks also. A limited amount of parking is available near the top about 30km from the lighthouse."
260,Amazing,"First stop at Byron, but could not get a park. Husband & I got up at 5:30 to watch the sunrise at lighthouse. Was absolutely worth it and beautiful! Get there early as we double parked in car park not on road and quite a few people there already. Gates are locked so you can’t drive up to lighthouse. Many people were parked in front of gates etc and come down the hill to parking inspector there at 6am writing out nearly $300 fines."
261,Great bit of exercise,"A must do In byron. A great walk that needs to be done early morning or late afternoon. A chance to see turtles, whales, dolphins and stingrays. Miles of blue water and beaches and scenery that is not available any other place in the world."
262,Gorgeous!!,"I visit everytime I come to Byron. It's a nice walk up from Byron township, a great place to watch the sunset (take a picnic) and at certain times of the year, an awesome place for land based whale watching"
263,Fabulous view,"If you come to byron Bay, you can’t leave without visit the Lighthouse. Around 7:45pm (summer time) is the sunset time, the perfect moment of the day to go to the light house and see breathtaking views from anywhere you look. And go home with some awesome pictures!"
264,Beautiful view a tough walk with a stroller,We loved walking around the lighthouse. The views to the ocean and beach are awesome. We got to see a bunch of dolphins eating near the bottom of the ocean close to the rocks! Spectacular views. Highly recommend especially during sunset!
265,Must see in Byron,We tackled this walk on a gorgeous July day. It took us 3.5 hours round trip but we made it! This was with a 5 year old (enticed by the promise of an ice cream at the end of the trip) and 14 month old (in carrier). Gorgeous views from all vantage points. The rainforest part was quite slippery in some places so definitely recommend hiking shoes and if it's been raining maybe try the coastal track as this was a much sturdier trip up.We also visited the Captain Cook lookout which provided beautiful views.A great walk to visit the most easterly point of Australia.If you are not interested in the walk you can drive up to the lighthouse car park and park (approx $8) but there aren't that many parks.We started our walk from the Byron Bay surf club but there are a couple of other car parks further up that will make the distance shorter.A must do when you visit Byron Bay.
266,Most popular thing to do in Byron,"Come here at sunset, you’ll get lovely pictures of the place - even though you might not be able to see your own face!!"
267,Nice walk ,"A steep track through woodland via a cobble path reveals the stunning lighthouse and the most easterly point in Australia. The 360 views are stunning with dolphins swimming and playing which you could watch for hours. It’s worth the walk, take it steady"
268,"Nice View, But Parking.....   Seriously","We came but couldn't park our car. We didn't have time to walk up, and it was a long way. Unless you have time or go on a week day, don't bother."
269,East most point,"We stayed in Byron Bay for a week and did this walk every morning. It was a great way to start the day, steep in parts that gave you a great workout. Amazing views all the way."
270,Must see in Byron,The Cape Byron Lighthouse is an  icon of the Byron Bay region and its easy to see why. An easy walk from the car park to the lighthouse area affords you outstanding views of a beautiful and rugged coastline. Great way to spend an hour and a really photogenic area. A must see for visitors to the area.
271,Lighthouse at touristy Byron,I’m really happy we decided to leave the beach and take a walk to the lighthouse. Not only was a great exercise (though many locals were actually jogging all the way up and down) but the whole path was full of great views and many things to discover (like the wallaby you may see in one of our pictures. We got so much fun and soooo many pictures. Please take this walk when you visit. It is really worth it.
272,Beautiful must see spot,"Excellent views from the top, you can drive all the way to the top and just a short walk to the lighthouse. We saw wales as well. Cafe was night too, good coffee. Worth a drive up for a look."
273,Most eastern part of Australia,"Lovely lighthouse, which is still working today. The lighthouse itself has small exposition on the ground floor, acquanting the visitors with thw history of the lighthouse and people who run it and lived there back in the days. Visitors are also allowed to go up on the top with guided tour which rewards them with absolutely stunning view ans in the season you can spot many whales! The entrance is empty but there are donation boxes as the tours are run by volunteers. You can also visit the keepers cottages and small cafe. It's beautiful spot which shouldn't be missed."
274,Great walk worth the effort ,"We parked the car down the hill from the lighthouse, as the car park at the top was full, and walked back up.We got there just in time to join the next scheduled free tour of the lighthouse. These are run by volunteers and there are several every day. While we waited we looked around the museum on the ground floor. It was really interesting to see how the lighthouse used to operate.The guide was great, he knew his stuff! And he told us that you can sometimes see the migrating whales from the lighthouse! We looked but couldn’t see anything!At the back of the lighthouse you can walk further down to the “most easterly point of the Australian mainland”. More spectacular views here.If you can get your car parked definitely get yourself up here."
275,"With memories from 4 years ago, I thought all of the houses have spoilt this icon.","Cape Byron is the most easterly point of the Australian mainland - tick this one off and then meet (the much, much bigger) challenges of visiting the continent's other cardinal points. When we last visited (June)  it was blowing a gale but the views were still fantastic, probably even better than in summer when it can be hazy. And the tough conditions didn't stop a bunch of hardy souls with long lenses standing around waiting for sightings of whales migrating north along the coast."
276,great vantage spot and coffee and cake destination,"Besides the walking tracks, the historic lighthouse is well worth a visit.  If you time it right, the volunteers will take you up the stairs to view the surrounds and hear of the history of the lighthouse."
277,WOW WOW WOW,"We only had a few days in the area so wasn’t sure if time away from the beach was worth it ,but it was .As we had a motorhome and thought we’d struggle with the walk we grabbed an Uber there and back. Brill service from locals with loads of insider info and we were able to walk to the look outs , see the lighthouse , visit the most easterly point and watch the dolphins off the coast .So if you. are in the area go - it’s amazing and gives you such a different view of beautiful Byron"
278,"Stunning views, worth the trip",Walk or drive to the top. Park near the top for $4.00 or drive all the way up to the light house ($8.00). Amazing views to the North to Mount Warning and South towards Lennox.
279,Stunning view,"we weren't expecting to be able to do a tour of the lighthouse when we got there after the walk from town, as i'd been here before and hadn't done one. It was a free tour to go up to the top of the lighthouse with a volunteer guide, and they only allow 10 people per group handing our 'tickets' to each person. You can inside the lighthouse to look at the artefacts for the museum, but going to the top to see the views and learn more about the lighthouse and Byron Bay was good. The lady who took our tour was lovely, and also told us about her encounter with Chris Hemsworth and Matt Damon! Not sure what times/days they run the tours, as they stopped doing tours at 11.30 the day we went."
280,Beautiful beyond words.,This was a great trip up here. It takes between 1 1/2 to 2 hours to reach the lighthouse from the centre of town by walking but worth the walk. The scenery along the coast line was great. To get back down you can get a taxi which takes about 10 - 15 minutes or walk back again. One way on this day was enough for me. The tour of the Lighthouse is limited to if I remember correctly 10 people at a time and is provided by donation. The lovely lady that took us around was very  informative and when you get to the top we had breathtaking views. There is a gift shop up there so you can get souvenirs to take home.The chocolates were well received when I got home. The downside is the coffee shop on site. I had tea in a pot which was great but all they had in the way of scones was wholemeal scones. When other reviewers wrote about scones I thought they were normal plain or fruit scones that you get anywhere in Australia with a devonshire tea. When I got the scone I can honestly say it was HIDEOUS. In all my years I have never tasted a scone so unpleasant and where the idea of a whole meal scone came from is anybody's guess. I love scones and was looking forward to this but seriously DON'T  BOTHER with these unless they offer plain.  You can get limited other food here lots of drink options but if you are relying on a normal devonshire tea ( THINK AGAIN!). Well worth the trip to the lighthouse just plan your food options before you go.
281,Great views and helpful volunteers,"Even on a slightly smoky day you could see for miles, we left our car way back down the esplanade so the walk was huge and steep but we made it and spent a couple of hours relaxing up at the lighthouse which was so serene 🌊"
282,Run to the lighthouse ,We drove up to the light house and parked in the available area closest to the lighthouse. It was free to park and sight see before 9am. All other parking areas have a 4hour parking limit which are metered. The walk up to the light house is spectacular. It's a gorgeous lookout and not particularly windy unless it rains. It is $8 per car to park near the lighthouse.
283,Great walks and fantastic views...,"What a great day with the group today! From the moment I had my first interaction with Alice, I knew I was in for an awesome time! Their entire team was incredibly friendly and helpful. You can tell they genuinely love what they do and go above and beyond to make sure everyone is safe and enjoying themselves.Thanks again Cape Byron Kayaks for everything today! U guys are the best!Sincerely,The Crazy Canucks"
284,Most Eastern point in Aust,This was an amazing place to visit We stopped for an afternoon coffee .Then went for a walk down toward the lighthouse  I’m assuming you can normally go on but it was closed . We walked the well made tracks and steps around the area to the most eastern point of Australia which was amazing and rather breathtaking . We even saw whales in the distance .
285,Spectacular visit at night,"The lighthouse is the main attraction when in Byron. It's a short drive from the center of town, or there's walking tracks if you would rather walk up. There's a small carpark at the top but I wouldn't count on getting a park there, it's very busy and no where near enough parks for the amount of cars going up there. If you like walking, I would recommend parking down the bottom of the hill and walk up. There's great views from up the top and of course you can say you've been to the most easterly point of Australia."
286,Big big walk,Byron bay lighthouse is located on the most easterly point of Australia. There is no better place to experience nature at its finest and catch the dolphins and whales heading past the cape Or watch the sunrise I highly recommend doing a Toast the Sun experience to see the sunrise with a loved one
287,Catch the sunrise...its impressive!,"If you're driving up, don't forget some coins for parking and take one of the first spots you see. Good walk up to the lighthouse and fantastic views. We didn't do the walking tracks due to having a pram but they looked great. Really enjoyed the historic information around the base. It was great staring off into the distance and enjoying nature."
288,Early morning bicycle visit ,The lighthouse is beautiful and well maintained. The person in charge of the tours is very nice and gives good historical information. There is also a room where you can see antiques and old photos from the place and its operation.
289,Worth a visit ,This has always been on the bucket list and did not disappoint. We drove as far up as we could after a couple of days walking around Byron Bay. Spectacular.
290,Stunning view,"We walked from the public parking area in Byron on the beach along the length of the beach and up to the lighthouse then returned via the road. It was a very hot day for such a walk as I did not anticipate the distance was my starting point. Wear comfortable clothing and shoes for sure if you want to do the same. Barefoot along the beach was lovely, but the walk up to the lighthouse and return needs footwear. Take water as well. The view at the top and the beautiful aqua coloured water was spectacular. You can drive up to this location as well."
291,Stunning!,"We came up for sunrise and it definitely did not disappoint. The only thing we wish we did was get there earlier whilst was still completely dark, I would aim for 45 mins before sunrise to find your position. Parking is poor as who is going to walk all the way up in the dark? So we just parked anywhere and didn’t worry about it as a parking inspector out at 6am was unlikely. The views are absolutely stunning from all angles. We also saw at least 10+ whales, some even breeching as well as a pod of dolphins! Definitely recommend waking up for this. It’s the most eastern mainland point of Australia so definitely significant and you’ll be the first in the country to see it."
292,Lighthouse walk,"The Lighthouse Light's Up Your Day! Do the walk to the Lighhouse on a sunny day, and you'll feel 100% happier and healthier than the day before.Great views. Great Sunrises. Great Sunsets. Great Photos.I never get tired of visiting the Lighhouse!"
293,Nice view,Been here several times and in all manner of weather. This time it was during cyclone oma which was producing Gail force winds and huge surf. It’s the number must do while in Byron.
294,Amazing view,We did the long trek from the town along the beach and up to the lighthand house . A very good workout at a brisk pace . When you get there the views are awesome . If you are lucky you can see dolphins and other marine life and at the right time of year you can see whales breahing  . You can also drive up there but you have to pay for parking .
295,Great walk ,"Arrived there last Wednesday afternoon to a very blustery welcome.   The winds from Cyclone Oma were strong and whipping up the waves,  Surfers were everywhere and traffic was very slow.  It cost $8 to park up the top, but well worth it, because the walk up from free parking locations, if you can find one, is pretty steep.Not that many people later in the afternoon.  A nice café, good toilets, were there making it worth a stay.   A couple of walking trails also start from the top."
296,spectacular sunset,"We came here for sunrise on Monday morning. We drove out a bit before sunrise (around 5.15) planning on going to the parking lot all the way to the top, right before the lighthouse. In case you were planning the same here is some helpful information I would have been grateful to know: -the access to the parking lot at the top is blocked at that time (sunrise). It is open for sunset but very very full. Go early is you want to find a spot. -there is a parking lot right where the road is blocked. It gets fairly full. There is one more parking lot as you turn to go down. Not very from the first one. -Take some water with you and wear comfortable shoes. There’s still a bit of a climb to go to the light house from the parking. - try to not double park. There were many aggravated people blocked in. There were a decent amount less people during sunrise, compared to sunset."
297,Beautiful! ,We took a turn off and headed right as we were walking and ended up walking thru a forest area-lots of steps but very nice & cool from the heat. Walked past where the hang gliders launch and then up to the lighthouse. Stunning views. Worth the hike. Check out the historical items in the lighthouse too.
298,Sightseeing,Visit the Lighthouse for exceptional views. There is also access to a small cafe and the centre offers information regarding the history of the area as well as marine life.
299,Worth the walk,"Whales rounding the point is a fairly common sight over the winter.  Regardless of the time of year, this is an awe inspiring place."
