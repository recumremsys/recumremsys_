0,Couples holiday ,"Really enjoyed our week here, better than expected, beach nice but very pebbly once into the sea, Blue lagoon beautiful and free pick ups. Plenty bars and restaurants to choose from and good value for money. Lots of trips available also great prices all day boat trip lunch for £15, £5 for pedalos or paddle boards so did lots of activities. Would definitely return!"
1,"Lovely beach, bit stoney","Been to several beaches on  the lagoon all very nice, always get a sunbed, billys beach, sea horse beach, sugar beach all great , free bus to and from the beach , we staying at the turqoise hotel so we got on that beach for free, beaches seem to be getting dearer and dearer, but still a great day , billys beach has nice food, 2 sunbeds ans 1 parasol 30 tl, thats just over £4, great value"
2,Nicest beach in turkey,"The lagoon is beautiful, clear sea, no waves, ideal place to spend a day with additional activities. Well worth the small entrance fee. However the food in the Blue Lagoon Cafe is terrible. Cold, tasteless & expensive."
3,Dream place,"I visited the lagoon with my done, it's beautiful the sea warm and lots of cover from the sun.My issue, over crowded and too touristy.  The locals have seized the opportunity to turn this into a real commercial entity and in doing so it's lost something"
4,It's worth it. ,Had a great day at the beach. Two sun beds around £6 for the day.  Clean warm sea and fun to watch the paragliders coming in to land.  Plenty of excellent restaurants for food.
5,Very clean water ,Beautiful beach and lovely sea views nice restaurants close buy to.Loved seeing the turtle aswell well worth a visit this place is breathtaking
6,Most beautiful beach in Turkey.,Love the blue lagoon. Ate at the first big restaurant on beach. Food excellent quality and really well priced.
7,Lovely ,"Had a recent day visit to the blue lagoon. It is a peaceful retreat perfect for a relaxing day! Beach is mainly pebbles, plenty of sun beds with the added opportunity to hire a pedalo. I would advise visiting one of the other beaches on the other side of the lagoon as they have bars, restaurants and WiFi!!"
8,Awesome,"It’s a rock beach but water was clean and the coulor was magnificent. Good place to spend nice time with all variation.  Beach ,parasailing , boat trips etc"
9,The beach is better viewed from afar.,"Lovely beach for a stroll on the front or simply having a lazy day, the blue lagoon is further down towards the right , many excellent boat trips leave from this end"
10,Pot luck with good results,"Visited today for the 1st time,beautiful place,more than enough sun beds,amazing to be in the water with fish swimming around you,deffo must se if visiting the area"
11,Too busy,Stopped here lovely water and beach no real need to swim as you float water salty so so relaxing turtles in water so amazing
12,Didn’t meet the expectations,Long rough sandy beach surrounded by a beautiful landscape.But very crowded in July and August - off season is fine!
13,Stoney and very rocky beach - tide is not suitable for young children,"Loved the blue lagoon, relaxing atmosphere, lovely warm water, great views, sun trap. Cheap to get in and for food and drink."
14,Great,Fabulous beach easy access to the sea. Billys bar offers great food and drink great day out. Easy to get too with free buses.
15,One of the worst beaches I have ever been,"Beach beautiful, family friendly, great choice of bars and shops. Very friendly helpful people. Would definitely recommend and am going back next year."
16,Enjoy 50 shades of blue,"Fantastic beach, handy toilets, lots of snack bars and drinks, loungers reasonable. Planning next trip as we speak!"
17,Beautiful Beach. Turquoise Water.,"Billys Beach Bar on the lagoon, great position for sunbathing and a good restaurant. Having got married on the Blue Lagoon in 2016 it will always be a special place for us."
18,Very nice Long stony Beach!,"Spent the whole day at the blue lagoon so relaxing, they also have toilets changing rooms, and showers, all are very clean. Cafe/bars very good food and service.You pay an entrance fee of about a pound, and just under six uk pounds for 2 sun beds and a parasol for the day."
19,Hard to Swim,"Takes place in a national park, nice and clean beach,the sea is super blue. Getting deep so suddenly!The cafes and restaurants are overpriced."
20,Amazing place,Lovely beach even though it's stoney. Lagoon is a great swim and plenty of reasonably priced good food and drink.
21,Sunbathing,"Visited the blue lagoon beach several times during our stay in olu deniz, and it is beautiful, nice flat seashore made it easy to swim, plenty of sunbeds, and a few nice beach cafes which have great food, reasonably priced too, would definitely come back"
22,One of my favorite places,"We went to the Blue Lagoon. So relaxing in a beautiful setting. Water lovely to swim in so went back the next day for more. And probably would have again if we weren't coming home. Beautiful, pure bliss."
23,Beautiful beach,"Lovely beach, we had a wonderful time on the beach and swimming in the sea. There is s bar for drinks...."
24,Beautiful Beach,"Fantastic place excellent service and views are amazing, has a really good time here, the staff was really polite and helpful."
25,"Beautiful scenery, clear water, pebble beach, but can be crowded","Amazing views from this white pebbly beach of mountains & islands. Like paradise with clear water turning to deep turquoise which is warm. Plenty of cafe's, showers & toilets."
26,Empty at this time of year ,"Beautiful environment, very clean beach and lagoon. Enjoyed several days chilling in the sun and swimming in the clear water."
27,Lovely lagoon,Lovely gated beach. Only 7 lire to get in very clean and safe. Lovely to swim in the lagoon and the sea. Prices in the snack bars very reasonable.
28,Crystal clear Med and Paragliders,Shallow water great for young kids but beware of the rocks further out sea shoes a must staff on beach are great and food and drink excellent and cheap
29,Beach,Such a beautiful place beautiful Beautiful warm water spent many days there would highly recommend Golden Sands Beach club was excellent fantastic food and good service
30,Stoney beach,"Nice beach, water very shallow, plenty of sunbeds, lovely for a day out, great for snorkeling, also water sports available"
31,Overrated ,Great views and facilities really recommend a visit. Nice clean restaurants with good service and beach views. Exciting to see the paragliders landing
32,Blue 'What'😱,"Loved it here. 15tl for a sunbed and table, beautiful beach and the water is fairly warm and a clear turquoise.  Spent a lovely day here finished by a fab cocktail :)"
33,Overrated,"Love this place, free WiFi even works as far as in the sea. Lots of fish, good for snorkeling, can hire kayak or pedalo for cheap £8 for an hour. Best cocktail in Olu Deniz Banana banshee."
34,Overrated ,Lovely sea very clear and warm. The lagoon is breath taking my beautiful. Watching the gliders coming down of the mountains. Lots of boat trips available too. Expensive food but it is providing a service on a private beach area. Only disappointment was it's a stone beach rather than a sandy beach but you can't have everything for a relaxing breath taking view and day!
35,Just beautiful and love coming back here.,"Beautiful water shame the beach was so rocky, no sand just lge pebbles and grit, but the water was lovely."
36,Magnificent Shoreline ,"Really relaxing beach nice and quite. Stunning scenery, lots of amenities like toilets and showers and a few beach bars and cafes. Really great for snorkling as it's really calm and clear"
37,Lovely Beach & calm waters,For me it’s the best beach in turkey clean and peaceful it do get hectic in busy summer with families but you can always find a peaceful spot to lay down
38,Great place to swim,Warm waters lovely scenery. A pedal boat is a must we would go out to the middle and jump off into flat calm clear blue warm water it was so nice.Good at the beach cost us  £20 for food and drink for four of us.£3 to get on the beach each includes sun bed and umbrella. Can get crowed but show me a place that isn't at the end of August. Overall we loved this place.Only thing to comment on is we were disappointed to see plastic and litter on the banks of the lagoon at the far end but that's people for you not respecting the place.Don't let this spoil your time here you do have to go look for it to find it.I'd go again lovely place
39,One of the best beach on world,"Sandy beach,  usually free sunbeds, nice way to spend afternoon with free bus shuttle from most Hotels"
40,beach Oludeniz,"Beautiful resort.  Amazing reviews off the mountains.  The beach is peebles not sand. There is  paragliding so be very careful when walking across the grass amazing to watch. I did the paragliding and at £75 it was  a good price, a amazing experience.  The resort is 1 strip off bars restaurants and shops and booking offices for trips. Oludeniz is great location for trips. Amnials trips are great ,we went up the mountain to where the para gliders go from the views were amazing."
41,THINK TWICE,Pure Turkey- not to be missed. Good variety of beaches catering for different tastes from quiet to lively! Billy’s Beach is one of my favourites. Good place to spot the turtles too.
42,Beautiful but needs maintaining ,"lovely beach. recommend water shoes as the stones are hard to walk on. good price for sun beds. sea clear and calm, just a large drop to deep water. not great for kids as not sand and dangerous drop in the sea. hard to get out and defo recommend sea shoes so your feet don't hurt."
43,beach very poor and dirty,"The photos of the Blue Lagoon look amazing but what a disapointment😭😭. The public beach is very stoney with a fare drop into the sea. Not for small children. The actual Blue Lagoon is full of private beaches with what i would call builders sand. The water is warm but not very clear, nothing like the photos you will see on many web sites.Oludeniz town is fine with some nice restaurants."
44,a relaxed day with friends away from hotel,Spent the morning at the beach 45 tl for 2 beds and a sunshade. Sea can be a bit rough at times and I recommend wearing beach shoes as very stony...
45,If you abuse it you will lose it,Spent a few nights in the town sone nice bars and great eateries really enjoyed the resort but a few days was enough other town close by are easily accessed by dolmus so this worked well.I will return.
46,Not very special,"Lovely beach the people was friendly and not hounded us,the sunbeds was poor guality and 45tl each they had a good food selection."
47,REVELATION OF 2019!!,Lovely sandy beach with fantastic views of hang gliders as they land on strip between beach and shops.Loungers to pay for here but reasonable. A walk to the blue lagoon where more loungers and cafes with showers changing rooms etc. is well worth it.
48,Nothing special,Just returned  from  this lovely  hotel cannot fault it beautiful  hotel friendly staff and nice food great location on a small hill room service spot on speedy menu and all the bar staff great as were all the staff cya next June thanks for a lovely  week xxx
49,Ok ,Great beach with beach bar sea beautiful..beach pebbly so good idea to have beach shoes...waiter service on beach...
50,Average beach,"Pebble Beach near to the water, not so easy to get in the water.Nice soft sand, further back.Plenty of room, locals would bring down chairs, tables & have picnic's, didn't feel squashed in.You can put your towels down in the middle, on the sand for free & no hassle from anyone.Visited most days on a 2 week holiday.Lots of Para gliders landing on the promenade, so be wary, if the guys shout move to a side, you need to do so , so they don't land on you.Can get sunbeds, 15 lire each, umbrellas 15 lire, cheaper than the lagoon.Boats & pirate ship are further up, so safe for swimming as it is roped off.Great day out for all ages including families.Sand is very very hot will need to keep your flip flops on.People were buying swim shoes to wear in the sea, from the look supermarket, which is half way up the main street.Changing rooms & showers on the beach.Toilets on the prom, near a beach bar for 2 lire, but no public toilets on the beach.Worth a try before going to the paying private beaches."
51,POO HOLE,The sea was wonderful for a swim as the water was so warm and clean. Very nice sunbeams available to rent and the Blue lagoon cafe was a welcome retreat for good food and drinks particularly the made to order savoury pancakes. The disappointment was the litter on the beach particularly cigarette ends which is unusual on a blue flag beach. However don't let that deter you from a lovely experience.
52,Avoided it this year,"Great beach facilities food and drink. Well worth getting a pedalo and go turtle spotting , take some bread and feed the fish"
53,A beautiful beach with a buzzing seafront shopping and eating area,Visited here as part of our hotel has a Beach Club here but unfortunately the water was dirty and looked more like a swamp than a lagoon ( maybe due to the heat ? )
54,Crowded and Dirty,"Cristal clear and very warm and welcoming waters (, surrounded by picturesque mountains only sometimes you have pollution from the boats, which is a big problem for many beaches) around the world)"
55,Beautiful,Paid 25TL to go on the beach and get a sunbed. Area very clean. Gently sloping into the sea. Loads of fish to see. Not too busy. Area roped off where it goes deep into the lagoon but you can go through.Surrounding scenery is stunning
56,Very disappointing,"One of the best beaches in Turkey, the water color is amazing, waves are existing but not annoying, umbrella and seats service is  available with fair price."
57,Great beach lovely scenery,Lovely place so nice to spend a day relaxing only 15 lira for a sunbed so well worth it and the water was lovely had a swim and seen lots of small fish and even a small turtle
58,Beautiful beach,"The blue lagoon itself is beautiful  pebble beach and lovely warm water.  Cafe/bar there.   Toilets and showers.    One thing spoiled the beautiful day for me were the men coming round with a monkey and a parrot  tethered, for the tourists to have photos taken with them.   It is a cruel thing to do and see and I was shocked to see some families calling them over to have their pictures taken.  I hope more people feel as I do and eventually this activity will come to an end."
59,Oludeniz Beach,Lovely chilled atmosphere. Stunning scenery. Billies Beach is definitely the best place to go to visit the lagoon. Take a pedal boat out and go turtle spotting 🐢 😍
60,Surrounding views,We love it so much great beach :) its clean and its not that busy .ee had drinks from the bard and they were so helpfull
61,Fun beach,"great holiday area, i stayed at the white otel, very clean, great staff, room serviced every day. the blue lagoon is so clear."
62,Blue lagoon turkey,"Clean and very blue water. The best beach I ever been in Turkey. Hotels are not nearby, and laying on the beach you can see hundreds of paragliding flying above you"
63,Wonderfil,"Blue lagoon and Oludeniz beach are not what we expected. The view and nature are beautiful but the beach is disaster. Sunbeds are so close one to each other that you can not pass and the beach is very dirty. There is no send at all. We have paid 14€ sunbeds for 4 of us and 4€ for parking, sped an hour walking around Blue lagoon, took few pictures and escape this place. Calis beach Fethye is much better organized.The beach in Oludenize surely dont diserve blue flag!"
64,Needs a good clean up. ,What an amazing beach also known as the Dead Sea. everything just chilled and laid back perfect for the kids to enjoy and just float the day away with perfect clear blue water and Stoney sands. Overall defiantly a must when you are in the area.
65,Pebbles ,"wife and I spent a couple of days on the beech where we stayed on seahorse beech, fantastic view of the what I called the sleeping giant , a formation of the rocks opposite looks like a head then arms across the chest etc, water nice and calm."
66,Fun beach ,Lovely beach with warm water .. very friendly bar staff with nice lunch ... Two sunbeds and umbrella 50 tl this year .. more than doubled !
67,Gorgeous!,"Had a day here it was lovely, relaxing a very pleasant day.We had lunch in the restaurant which was very good. The lagoon is calm and warm for non swimmers, you would feel very safe"
68,Beautiful,Great place to visit - green pine was our favourite place to stay when visiting - lovely lady on entrance and she was so pleased when we went back a second time x
69,Lovely,Beautiful beach with amazing views and lots of paragliders to enjoy watching and have a drink by the ocean.  The Med sea is Crystal clear where you can take short daily trips to nearby islands and the Butterfly valley. The cost of the trip is very reasonable.  You can also book a tandem paraglider flight from the top of the mountain.
70,Deserves No rating. Blue Lagoon... dire....,"Lovely beach, warm clear water. Can get very busy so check the times. If it is busy take a pedal boat out into the lagoon to get a better view.The beach and water can be a bit dirty with lots of litter because of the number of people that visit, which is a bit disappointing. If you want food, head to the main restaurant. The small cafe's food wasn't great and took a while."
71,Blue lagoon cafe,One of the nicest beaches in Europe I’ve visited Some hotels have private bays around the side Small charge to get into the public bit.
72,Beautiful beech in Turkey.,"Absolutely Beautiful beach , clean everyday and plenty of distances from other people. Great restaurants and also they can  serve you by the bed . Great break"
73,Don’t have your picture taken with monkey or parrot,"A must visit!! Absolutely lovely, calm clear water, stunning views. The beds are chargeable however we just put bag between beds and didn't actually use the beds. It's 7 lira pp to get in unless you walk along the beach, where it's free"
74,One of the best water,Visited for one day to spend time swimming in the beautiful lagoon. Pebbly/stone beach (no sand) with the most gorgeous clear water to swim in. We paid 44TL for two sun beds & parasol & £4 to paddle board for one hour. Plenty of little cafes & places to buy food/drink and lots of beach/sea activities too! Would highly recommend a visit!
75,Sea was like dead,"We enjoyed our time at the Seahorse Beach Club, it is 25 TL to get in, including loungers and parasols! Lovely food and drink at reasonable prices! Outside of this venue though, it needs cleaning up, there is a lot of litter on the roadside!"
76,Nice beach and nice atmosphere ,Beautiful and clean beach and coast in Oludeniz. Close by facilities and restaurants. Sandy and specious. I would recommend for families and couples. Very romantic views after sunset and many excursions available from local agents.
77,Beautiful Setting and Atmosphere but litter very badly managed here..l,"The 'dead sea' is a peaceful and beautiful location with plenty of safe swimming beaches. Some of the development along its north side is insensitive and regrettable, but mercifully low rise. It is still a lovely lagoon with water a range of blues and turquoise. The wooded south side seems largely untouched and there is some important nature conservation in hand."
78,Summer holiday ,There are s few beaches in the lagoon. Our favourite is the Seahorse. Comfy beds either on the sand or decking. Restaurant is good serving snacks or main meals and s selection of drinks or cocktails. You can hire a pedelo or just swim. Makes a change from sitting by the pool.
79,Hoilday,Excellent day trip to seahorses beach . Fantastic food . Lovely location . 25 Turkish lira for sunbeds and entry was very good value.
80,Free Public beach !!!!,A nice place. Plenty of little fishes in the water and quiet enough to enjoy the relaxing vibe which it has to offer. The cocktails were pretty great too.
81,"Very busy, pebbles - Tiger side much better swimmming","Wonderful beach to look at and to sit and watch the paragliding. It is a stoney beach so you will need proper beach shoes, the stones get very hot. The sea drops away from the shore very quickly with a steep gradient so it is not suitable for young or inexperienced swimmers.Great place to sit and relax for an afternoon though"
82,Beautiful surroundings crystal clear water ,Such a lovely beach.  Very stoney in parts and water can be changeable and steep once in the sea.  Charge for umbrella and beds but reasonable.  Good beach bar.  Just watch out for the Paragliders landing lol.
83,Our wedding vow renewal ,"The beach is beautiful. Long and clean, with amazing sea colors, the beach is partly sandy, partly with pebbles. There, you can find a cool place for diving or snorkeling. You can pay for sunbeds, or you can just lay on the beach. I don't know how much the sunbeds cost. You chose watersports or paragliding or just enjoy the sun and sea."
84,Cracking beach,"Beautiful place to visit, great for relaxing, sunbathing, canoeing and swimming etc. Just several minutes walk from Oludeniz too. Waters are so clear and a great view of the mountains and paragliders. Highly recommended!"
85,Was natural but not any more,"There are few beaches within the lagoon, our favourite is Billy's, we always grab a bed right at the front and chill for the day(30 lira for two beds and umberella), water is so inviting whether its for a swim or hire the pedalo and investigate the lagoon, Billy's restaurant is lovely, with plenty of choice for kids and adults alike, word of warning on the jacket spud (its huge) The home made lemonade is a wonderful refreshment. If you look out long enough you will see the beautiful Caretta Caretta (turtles)."
86,Amazing,We went to the blue lagoon expecting to see blue gorgeous sea but instead it was normal clear water and warm. We were advised that this was like the Caribbean water but certainly not going there again and being charged to enter then also to hire the beds and parasol.
87,Beautiful,"A very nice beach with stunning views, brilliant to watch the sunset on with all the paragliders coming down, the sand is quite pebbly so it would be better to wear beach shoes rather than flip flops or sandals, the private beach a bit further down is worth the small entrance fee to enter, you can rent sun loungers and parasols to chill out in the private part too"
88,Life is there!,"Great to walk up and down the strip,  and try the many bars and restaurants   also amazing place to watch the sun go down"
89,Green Forest Hotel,"Incredible beach been 3 times now and will be going back again in the future. Absolute stunning. If going on transfer from hotel and get dropped off at billys beach highly recommend, walking back along the road and going on the main beach. Some nice little bars and very cheap"
90,Nice view,"Visited blue lagoon paying for the privilege then pay for sun beds.Sea full of rocks, couldn't see the attraction when the main beach is free to visit and closer to restaurants and bars. Definitely wouldn't go there again."
91,Large drop in to the sea,Really love this place with beautiful hues of blue and lovely boats and promenade to walk in. There are many nice bars and restaurants where you can enjoy nice meals or drinks by the beach with nice music. Really lovely place to be in Summer.
92,Sunbeds ,"Huge and small pebbled beach, very painful to walk on - trying to enter and exit the sea was quite difficult as there was a big drop into the sea with waves hitting the beach.  At lagoon end, there were huge slimy rocks which made entering exiting the sea even more difficult - I nearly fell on my way in and had to dive into the sea to avert an accident.  Mountains are nice to look at but it's nothing special."
93,Simply the best,"The actual lagoon area was okay. The water was really warm as we did visit in high season.It is very busy with local and holiday guests all vying for a space to settle down in - although we were told there are quieter periods in the day should you choose to visit then, mornings before 10 am was one of them. The view of the lagoon is pretty cool when you paraglide down from Babadag mountain.Note, there is a fee to pay to get into the area."
94,Disappointed,"Nice long stretch of beach . Unlike Calis the sea floor does not shelve away so violently but those with small kids should still be wary of the large waves. There are loads of beachside places to eat. Our choice is always Kumsal Pide where the prices are good, the food lovely and the chairs comfortable."
95,Beautiful,If your looking for golden sand then this beach is not it. Hot gravel stones as you get closer to the water which then becomes huge pebbles and finally razor-sharp stones in the water. It didn't stop others from enjoying the beach but was not what I was expecting. Plenty of sun lounger available. Try Billys Beach for soft sand.
96,Stunning,"We love turkey and no trip would be complete without a visit to the blue lagoon ,it really is as good as it looks in the photos"
97,Holiday,"Have been before, thought the sea looked very murky this time, don’t know why, still worth a look, for the day"
98,Great stretch of water,The beach here is lovely and the sun loungers are reasonably priced. The waves are a bit of pot luck as sometimes it's as flat as a pancake and other times they are giant. Overall a wonderful beach that I will definitely visit again.
99,Filthy!!,"Can be crowded but a beautiful place to visit. The sand is quite coarse and there are rocks in the sea but that aside you get to swim with fish around you, the colour of the water is amazing and the colour gets better the further out you go so a pedalo is a must. We got to see a turtle 😊. You have to pay for a sun bed but it's peanuts to be fair, you're drinks are brought to you and there's a lovely little beach restaurant and the food is lovely, you are not pressured to buy anything."
100,Fab beach,"A beautiful place! It is not compeltely sandy but has gorgeous views! There are quite a few cigarette butts in the sand - the locals should consider putting ash trays on the unberellas pr something! Other than that, this place is lovely! 7TL to get in and 45TL for 2 beds and a brolly...you can't go wrong! Enjoy 🙂🙂🙂"
101,Great stretch of pebble beach!,many beaches at the lagoon are fantastic but some have loud music and some are quite prices are very reasonable
102,Fabulous Alize ,Always a great place for a swim although the beach seemed a bit grubby this year with litter and cigarette butts laying around.
103,"Lovely place, bad timing",A very nice place lovely people bars everything you need while on holiday.lovely shops to buy your goodies and so very cheap.Lovely ice-cream and slush puppy drinks are so needed as they are so cold.
104,CraZy,"The main beach is big and wide and part sand,(near promenade) and pebbles at waters edge. It shelves very steeply into the sea so not ideal for children. Lots to see especially the paragliders landing on the promenade and the boats coming and going with the occasional super boat moored in the bay.The actual blue lagoon is at the Western end of the main beach and has several private beaches inside its circumference. As it is a protected area and almost landlocked from the sea it is very shallow at its beaches edges and flat calm and ideal for children to swim in complete safety. The beaches have restaurants attached where you can drink and dine within a few feet of your sun lounger or take out a canoe or pedalo to explore the lagoon.Being a conservation area means that the waters are teeming with fish and feeding them by hand in the water is a favourite pastime.We visited the Seahorse beach which we have seen develop over the years. Free shuttle busses are provided from your hotel and back though you do have to pay for your lounger and parasol ( 25TL for both @ 7.8TL to the £ for the day) You need them as there is no wind in the lagoon area as it is bordered on three sides by high hills.Well recommended for a visit."
105,Unique experience,"Seahorse Beach is beautiful, they have a decking area with sunbeds and parasols. Food is lovely and love the music they play to."
106,Great small resort,The blue lagoon is a must visitStunning calm watersTake a pedalo onto the waterIt's crystal clear
107,Fantastic ,"Clear water, friendly people. Paragliders landing in close distance. Went in june so not too busy, could stay there all day. Only thing is food and drink is slightly overpriced as it is on the beach. Beach has more pebbles than sand also. Still beautiful"
108,Nice stretch of beach,Excellent place to relaxe and unwin.d perfect scenery and view. Marvelous water and perfect for families with children. Very busy during the summer days
109,Average beach,"Amazing location, blue water, surrounded by mountains, with so many paragliding in the sky, with the amazing blue lagoon... Really really nice even if it is not sandy beach"
110,Beach ,"Apparently it was the Turkish holiday week so whole week it was packed with people, the beach is beautiful but the crowd and noise took it all away."
111,Stony panoramic beach,The beach is not sandy. It is quite crowded. The water is nice but again. Nothing special. You need wter shoes since the entrance in sea and the beach are full of pebbles.
112,Just beautiful,"The water is nice but that's about it. Beach is really dirty, facilities even worse. Not sure why this is ""the place""; I've seen much nicer beaches in Turkey."
113,Stayed in olu deniz but the lagoon is amazing,"Beautiful beach, great setting, paragliders are constantly landing, sun beds and umbrellas can be found, but they are not cheap. the beach has free space where you can bring your own sunbed. Refreshments and food are available on the beach. The water is clean, refreshing. In the afternoon there are usually waves. It is not suitable for young children and non-swimmers, as it is deep in the shore."
114,Clean,The blue lagoon is one of the most beautiful places we have visited it's so calm and peaceful the views are stunning you carnt visit oludeniz without going
115,First vist to turkey ever,Omg went there today and I've never going again the water is not blue more like grey with suntan cream floating on the top like oil. Theres me and my husband and 2 little kids are swimming and a big brown floating turd come next to us well I've never jumped out so fast in all my life theres toilets 40 seconds away and no one came to clean it out discusting. The bar men where pissed they kept dropping classes tripping over spilling drinks. Shame if it was well looked after would be lovely just really run down. Needs help. To long on the coach 4 hours stuck in traffic. The market was lovely very friendly.
116,Hang gliding watchers,"Gorgeous place! 7 lira to get in. Quite busy! Cafes and toilets there. Safe clear water for swimming, great for kids. Beautifully surrounded by mountains. Worth a visit!"
117,Like a dream,"Visited last year and kids wanted to go again. A lot busier this year, but still perfectly clean. Sea is warm, kids loved the peddle boat. Unfortunately didn’t see any turtles this year but lots of fish. Food good and everything priced well not the usual tourist rip off! Great day out!"
118,Lovely sea front amble,"It was our second time here, the beach is stunning.  Loved being able to have cocktails and food and watch the paragliders in the air.  Good vibes, great for families also."
119,Gorgeous beach,beach is very stoney and dirty fags ends every where people struggled to get out of sea grass area in front of hotels is very worn from all the paragliders landing on it too many paragliders now people sleeping in tents on the beach
120,"great holiday, and the beach and bars are friendly.","Oludeniz Beach is perfect for its location, sand and natural beauty. I did not like the water that quickly deepened and was quite wavy. I did not go to the very edge parts but I guess there will be more beautiful. You can see more foreign tourists than the local tourists at the beach where the paragliding people landing over you. Anyway, this beach must be seen."
121,Nice Beach,"What can I say, the beach is okay. Its not all sandy though its quite gravelly and rocky in places, its in a nice area surrounded by mountains and there are several bars and restaurants along the front. However, when moving from the beach make sure you're alert as there are paragliders landing on the beachfront very regularly and I did see someone get knocked over.I"
122,Changes for 2019,Spent a lovely couple of days on the beach relaxing and playing in the sea with my daughter. It is well worth a visit if you are in the area. lots of food and drinks available near by for not much money.
123,Nice,"Spent a lovely week at the Alize and would definitely return.Rooms comfortable and clean, as is the whole resort.Food is basic buffet style and can be a bit hit and miss but we ate out mostly because of all the great places to eat in oludeniz.We were a group of seven including three adults, three teenagers and a five year old.. Big shout out to Rosa who runs the childrens club she was amazing with all the youngsters there xx.Ignore the bad reviews I couldn't find any fault with this hotel if you want all inclusive this is the place to stay."
124,One of the best in Turkey if you love the sea,"Beautiful beach  here, watch the gliders come down, plenty of shops and bars behind you when you get hungry."
125,Overcrowded ,As i say relax 100% here drove here in hire car not far from calis beach . Oludeniz is one lovely place to visit or even stay on holiday lots of nice shops found on were i told lady she had nicest shop in turky also places to eat and drink we were on roof top cafe for coffee etc while we watched parashoot people landing on grass in front of us was great . The beach itself is to die fore sweeping sand all round what a place to go have been here three visits now will never lose its charm
126,Relax 100%,This place is stunning..we loved it..but pleaae take beach shoes as beach is hard to walk on as its not soft sand 🙄
127,Beautiful beach - especially from above!,Shingle beach with space to move. Be warned it shelves very steeply so probably isn't suitable for small children
128,Stunning,Oh how much I love this place its just amazing. The waves sun blue green just wow. Bring suncream and enjoy your life!
129,Fabulous staff on beach to serve your every whim,"Glad I’ve been but was more impressed by photos of the blue lagoon. The water is very warm, but is just like another beach."
130,Great evening with friends,Had a great day here 15 per lounger and 15 umbrella so 45 for the day 6.00 pound for both of us. Lovely clean place loads of eating places and toilets and water here is the sea not the lagoon side
131,Oludeniz - Dreamland…..,"We went to the blue lagoon during our stay in Hisaronu, please do not be fooled by the tropical pictures you see online, you are CRAMMED in like sardines, overcharged for everything and it isn't at all what you imagine it will be"
132,Not for the Wana be snobs,Not blue but it is a lagoon!  Not able to walk leisurely to the water as EVERY SINGLE SQUARE INCH HAS A SUNBED!!!! water is almost stagnant and dirty and bleeding awful!!! Stick to the sea near it.....
133,Beautiful scenery ,"The Blue Lagoon is truly unique, I definitely recommend chilling around there watch the clouds go by, and a couple drinks perhaps?"
134,Fantastic ,Crystal water - the only benefit of this place. Toooo many people. Upon entering the water are big slippery stones. Not good.
135,Would be good if not so dirty,"Secluded location, sheltered calm sea and shallow gradients in a beautiful setting.  Entrance for adults 7 lira, young children get in free. Sun beds and shades extra, but the cheap lira makes it a good deal.  Limited food of poor quality, so stock up in town before taking the short walk to the entrance to the Park."
136,Shame about the cigarette butts littered in the sand!!,"After being recommended we visit the lagoon we headed off. Charged to enter the area. One side is the sea the other side is the lagoon. The place is tiny, filthy and over crowded. There was rubbish all on the small beach and the water looked like bath water. It was quite unnerving when camps had been set up or families sitting in the bushes making mess everywhere. Definitely one to avoid. Stick to the sea side."
137,Pay to sit on a beach?,Lying on your back on sea and watch blue sky with many paraglidings from Babadag hill is true lazy time to visit Blue lagoon in Oludeniz with sunglasses and sun cream.Water has 28 °C is for never ending leasing water.Changing cabine for swimming  costume is very poor quality.All is for water and sky.Thanks for place on the beach.
138,One if the best place in this planet,Worth a visit. Kept very clean and we had a lovely time exploring x it is worth investing in some water shoes as there are rocks and pebbles underfoot- which do hurt.
139,Stunning ,"Must go beach, no sand however feet comfortable on the pebblesAge of group from 8 weeks to 62 years old,The setting of the beach is stunning,you would have to travel long way to get better"
140,Enjoyable ,The best place ever you can imagine.swimming in a clear Blue Lagoon with a breathtaking view to the mountains
141,Sensational !!,Stunning!blue crystal waters...warmish...not sure about pebbkes/sand beach.Lots of restaurants..many choices...not to many people which is lovely can imagine Summer would be madness!You are reliant on weather and we have had a few rainy days but also some glorious sunshine.
142,Boat trip,"Oludeniz Beach offers a clean sweep of golden sand and calm water to swim in. At is also the place where, at the far end, is a designated area for the many para-gliders to land. Quite a spectacular sight!  Backed by plenty of good bars and eating places a great place to spend a day or two."
143,On Holiday,"We had heard about the blue lagoon so went to see for ourselves, It was probably beautiful at one time but all we found were row upon row of sunbeds, cafes and souvenir shops, we did not stop."
144,Child friendly bathing,"A beach and walking area around the bay, where the numerous paraglyders come down to land. Lots of bars and restaurants to sit anjoy the delights."
145,Beautiful ,"Spent the day here and it was stunning. Very clean with lots of sunbeds available. Lovely cocktails served at the beach bar and the food was reasonably priced. Highly recommend this beach if you want stunning views, beautiful scenery and lots water sports on a very safe beach"
146,long sandy beach,Table all set out on the beach in the exact spot we got married 4 years previosly. The food was great the service was good and drinks well priced. An evening that will never be forgotten
147,Chill out and relax,"After looking at the photos of the Blue lagoon i couldnt wait to see it but was i dissapointed when i saw it it was nothing what i expected it was part of the beach at the top end which was fenced off from the rest of the beach and you had to pay to go in , could not see what the attraction was as it looked no different to the rest of the beach ."
148,Holiday ,"This is such a lvely place , crowded in August, but swimming in the lagoon with the grandkids was graet fun, lots of restaurants and bars by the beach, and shope where you can buy your beach shoes , its a bit stony in the sea."
149,Beautiful... however,"Lovely day out, think the charge to come in, is not good and should be free, as you have to pay for Sunbed’s and parasols. We can’t thank the bar staff enough. It was the day of the storm and we had our 4month baby with us. They were so good and looked after us well, even getting us a car to get back to our hotel after the storm was not letting up. We had a brilliant time. Thank you"
150,Spoiled by rude staff,Nice beach but spoilt by pebbles as you near the sea. Make sure u have beach shoes ouch ouch ouchThere are showers situated along the beach and plenty of bars. The boats that do the trips also moor up here.
151,Beautiful ,"One of the most photogenic places from the sky to siting around on the beach with umbrellas or shaded beds depending on which part you choose to enter If you choose to stay on the beach front side walking down from the moored boats be careful of the pirates lol 😂you’ll find your about to walk into a fee zone , where a small fee will be paid to enter ( similar to our national trust , of which keeps this little haven clean tidy and preserved ) after paying you’re TL ( unsure how much but by today’s rates 6tl to the £ year 2018 its pence really ) Keep walking until you start getting umbrellas and beds if that’s to your liking or just sit on beach with your towels This runs along and around entering towards the lagoon From previous years I choose to stay here or make base camp for the day enjoying the views of babadad mountain and some 2 day excursion boat trips also more fun if you want to jump of the Rocky. Out crop in front ( always check for hidden rocks below and depths so it’s safe to do so ps jelly shoes recommended generally for most of the beach areas in olu)I also chose to swim around the whole perimeter of the lagoon snorkelling ( was looking for those dam turtles 🐢 lol on that event none seen 😵☹️☹️) Any ways I digress    There’s food and drinks served in a taverna type beach bar and eatery Not used can’t comment Generally fare prices for where it is I’m sure you can hire forms of peddle boats sun canoes etc here OkLet’s get to a different side of the lagoon by road ( quick tip if you get hotel free bus or some how get dropped if it’s better ) although walk is within most persons capabilities flat and tarmacJust be careful as I think the path stops and you walk on the road ( not walked but from travelling on a free service just noticed ) You enter into some of the better bar / eateries with free beds and umbrellas ( again tongue   in cheek as you will be expected to buy a drink or two ) service is great and well why not your in your jollies Very shallow waters warm sometimes merky due to persons paddling around but if you want better snorkelling just swim further out Safe for all kids You can hire the boat 🚣‍♀️ or sun canoes here It’s worth it to peddle around the lagoon More likely to see a turtle this way Be warned this area can have a bit of a smell to it as remember it is a lagoon and water isn’t generally refreshed by sea tides unless in late. Winter , which means early summer most freshest but colder There’s some hotels further  down that side with loverly verandas unsure if you can walk of the street  and use Either way this is a loverly side to olu and should be on your list of visits at least once After all it’s that good plenty have had their weddings there Not naming bars as don’t want to be bias Enjoy your trip Respect the area Take litter back or bin it Keep this place special Once you’ve been tick it if your list then go do paraglide and get your own above view to complete you’re photo album 🇬🇧❤️🇹🇷🤘🏆🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢"
152,Beautiful beach ,During our recent holiday in Turkey we visited Ölüdeniz and the blue lagoon and it was what we expected absolutely stunning we enjoyed Ölüdeniz as well the people were really friendly and allowed to us have a look around there shop without hounding us to purchase anything which was good a good selection of food places and reasonably priced again we looked at the menu’s without being hounded overall a very enjoyable visit to Ölüdeniz
153,Fabulous ,"A  great place to visit and watch the para gliders descend. The beach is stony and we found it uncomfortable to sit on. However, sun lounges and parasols can be hired."
154,Great beach great food,Nice resort..the main beach isn't that great but the blue lagoon is nice for swimming..only a small resort but you can jump on a dolmus and go up into hisaronu for the evening. Which is what we did most of the time. Lots of paragliders to watch too.and take a bus ride to the ghost town..not far away and well worth a visit
155,Wonderful...,Haven’t been to Ölüdeniz Beach in three years and on this visit we were very disappointed. Rubbish everywhere and no attempt to clean it up just 50 Turkish Lira for two sun beds and a parasol. What a let down this used to be a beautiful area but they are just interested in taking as much money as they can without providing a service.
156,Lovely beach,The beach was clean but a lot of pebbles and stones so you need shoes or wet shoes to walk on. The sea was wild a few days but then on others so calm it was unreal.
157,Amazing beach | Great views | Para-gliding and much more activities,"We didn’t see much of the beach, this is a review of the blue lagoon cafe. We had a drink at the big bar/cafe at the lagoon which was ok “ish”.  We bought soft drinks and one cocktail which a member of staff insisted that we drink in the bar. We were quite happy just to sit in the regular seating area and he eventually gave us our drinks although clearly not happy.  It turned out that you are charged more for drinking in the restaurant/bar rather than the regular seats, regardless of buying exactly the same drinks. Obviously they didn’t mention this at the time and I only noticed by chance. It felt a little dishonest as the member of staff was very keen for us to be sat in the bar area. The bar area isn’t even particularly nice! While in the queue to pay I noticed a young British couple changing money at the bar and getting a rate of about 4tl to the £ which was almost half the going rate. I know it’s up to other people to be cautious but it all felt a bit like they were out to rip tourists off. All in all, it’s just a cafe on a beach and nothing special. Because of the location they’ve got customers, it’s just such a shame that they don’t treat them better."
158,Tranquil,Beautiful area and a must place to see. The sea is gorgeous to swim in and the views are tremendous.
159,Heaven on earth,"With the clear blue waters and pebble beach Oludeniz is somewhere you want to visit.We had access to the Oludeniz Beach Resort Private beach area but you can also buy loungers for a few Lira further along the beach.It's a great place to chill out, catch the sun and watch the paragliders make their way down to the beachfront to land.Be sure to catch the sunrise/set"
160,October,"I recently came to this beach for a family wedding and it was gorgeous And perfect for children, we came here every day and it is so clear and full of fish."
161,Amazeballs,beautiful place with a special water .its perfect in the morning you can see the real  color before it will be full of people.
162,Sisters Holiday,"Myself and my partner booked our holiday in Oludeniz based on the pictures of the Blue Lagoon which looks like a beautiful sandy beach, well it's not. It's very much like sharp sand and pebbles. This is what gives the sea it's lovely blue colour.Don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful place and the views are stunning. We were lucky enough to get there early and managed to get into the sea with some fish swimming around however this soon ended as everyone else arrived. For our liking, Its a bit too commercial and too busy. We actually preferred our hotel pool. I'm glad we went but wouldn't bother next time."
163,Day out,Enjoyed walking along the full stretch of beach with friends and taking a dip in the sea. Plenty of shops and restaurants to drop into as well as a beach full of pebbles to skim stones.
164,Beautiful,"Pebble & shingle beach not at all comfortable on your feet ( Beach shoes recommended) sit at the edge of the water and let the waves wash over you, very refreshing! stunning views."
165,Blue lagoon,Fantastic beach and if you're there at the right time you can see turtles. Very popular with tourists and locals alike. Love this place
166,warm even in early october,Beautiful beaches to choose from.Sunbeds 15 tl a day about £2 you can also get parasols.Lovely food at the beachbar.
167,peaceful,"This is a lovely resort, lots of food and drink available as well as supermarkets and trinket places. Easy walk along the prom just keep an eye out for the hangliders"
168,Must watch in Turkey,"Paid 25TL to enter the park/resort. Place is pretty empty given its winter. There was only one cafe open, right at the end of the stretch of beach. Expensive food too, but I Guess that’s to be expected. We managed to hire a boat to go towards Butterfly Valley. Good boat ride but otherwise the valley was a tourist trap."
169,Beautiful ,"Not the nicest place to go to. Gets very crowded with locals placing themselves right in front of your sun bed as they will not pay for sun beds. Shingle beach, water very nice though. Inside the lagoon it is very still and very little breeze gets very hot. Sandy beaches inside the lagoon at the beach clubs on the other side. Restaurants not great. Best we have been to around the lagoon is the Paradice beach club, food is good there."
170,Amazing and tranquil atmosphere,"A lovely resort with plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from, a lovely beach and the amazing blue lagoon around the corner."
171,Beautiful Beach,This place is something out of dreams. The crystal clear waters and the sunset here is amazing. I have been to pretty much every holiday destination in Turkey.but Ölüdeniz blue lagoon always is the best place to relax.
172,Beautiful beach,"Beautiful place to go and great for relaxing away from the large crowds. There are many private beaches you can go visit and wine & dine for a good price. Plus they pick you up and drop you back from you hotel. Paradise Beach is our favourite, highly recommended."
173,Beautiful setting,Lots of bars and restaurants about and plenty of room on the beach. Might be a bit pebbly for some but the scenery is amazing.
174,Lovely chilling day at the Lagoon,"We visited the blue lagoon as a family of 6, we took a taxi from our hotel and found that there was a charge to enter the blue lagoon, which we didnt mind as it goes towards keeping the beach nice etc. There is a cost of 15tl for a sunbed per person. But we found the beach to be full of cigarette butts and the sand was really rough and stoney. The water is clear and you can see fish swimming but wouldnt really call it 'blue'. The water also smells really fishy and leaves the smell on your skin. We rented a pedlow for 50tl for an hour which was nice but we didnt see any turtles unfortunately. I think the beach needs a good clean up since thats why people pay their money at the end of the day and you are packed in like sardines it is actually ridiculous... you have to be really careful as youre practically ontop of eachother and i nearly fell over the sunbeds numerous times! A bit rubbish but was still a day out ^_^ feel free to message for any questions you need answering."
175,Stunning,"Crystal clear water and great vibe. Tons of water activities including kayaking, boating, paragliding etc"
176,Beautiful,"too noisy, lots of smokers, people using mobile phones on speaker. We went to Billy's beach which helped but not by much."
177,Nice beach,"Clean turquoise water, small stones and very clear water. Surrounded by mountains and with a lagoon, it is quite unusual and beautiful."
178,Lagoon. ,"I love Oludeniz, its chilled and relaxing and surrounded by natural beauty.. what more can anyone want..."
179,Beautiful Location ,"Popular place, small fee if on foot or in car, well worth it goes to preserving the place. Plenty toilets, sunbeds, umbrellas (small fee). Plenty places to eat and drink, but can take your own. Beautiful clear waters in a safe environment. Scenery stunning. You must visit this place if nowhere else. Popular with the locals at weekends."
180,Peaceful blue lagoon,This is a long sand and pebble beach. It is not exciting. If you have delicate feet a pair of beach shoes will be needed. On a hot day I can imagine the stones to be hot. Along the beach there are several umbrellas and deck chairs. Waiters go up and down the beach taking orders. I thought they were a bit slow but during the busy time it may be different. Along the strip there are several bars providing a respite from the sun. May was a bit cold for the sea and the current appeared a bit strong. The spectacle of the hang gliders provide a great way to use up time on the beach. This beach is for sunbathers.
181,Don't eat there,"This is a real frustration. I thought Ölüdeniz would be peaceful and sea would be flat. On the contrary it’s a very crowded beach, waves are big, you can see nothing in the sea. Very very unpleasant, including the quality of the crowd."
182,Family holiday,"Visited the lagoon on a very busy day last week but it was well worth it.  To truly experience the beauty, you must get a peddalo which are very cheap for an hour."
183,Beautiful beach ,Water is very clean and warm. Only problem is that is not sand so is hard to enter to the water and come back
184,Simply superb,Everything about Oludinez is so chilled from the lovely beach bars and bean bags to the wonderful restaurants or if you want it to be exciting try a bit of skydiving from Babadag or the bars on the strip with there funny ways of entertainment but this place is just tranquil love it.
185,The heart of olu,"Lovely water to swim in, good for Snorkeling. Pedellos are a must and the restaurants are reasonably priced."
186,Beautiful beaches.,"What a shame, the photos of this beach are amazing and maybe during the low season this place is pretty. What we saw was nothing like the photos. We even had to pay to go there!! It was rammed, I mean rammed with plastic beds. People are amongst the bushes..The sea, which is shallow and safe for children was full, I mean full of people. It is difficult to negotiate your way amongst the people, families in there hordes. PLASTIC everywhere!. We couldn't stand it. We went to the beach on the other side, which is ok but after a largeTURD floated past my daughter we decided to escape the area, running!"
187,Stunning ,"After people raving about ölüdeniz and being the most beautiful and photographed beach on earth i decided to visit... I was looking for this beautiful place.. As I arrived to ölüdeniz I found lots of travel agencies, lots of tourists... I was looking for the 'Blue Lagoon', so I was directed to an area, where I paid a small entrance fee of 7TL... I  was walking and walking looking for the beautiful place... Once I arrived to the end.. I saw a LOT of tourists, sun beds.. there was no natural beauty, I did not see the beauty of the place... I can imagine if you don't travel a lot, you may find it nice... I have been to some of the finest beaches in the world.. I really could not find anything nice about the 'Blue Lagoon'. (except lots of tourists and overpriced bars)Though I enjoyed the ride from Antalya to Fethiye, the landscape was amazing thru the mountains.If you hire a boat you possibly can visit nice places in the area... Otherwise this beach/area is not worth to visit.. It s not what I expected from the photos..."
188,Stunning,Spent the day at paradise beach.We were picked up from hotel by the owners and spent whole day there. You are given your own number and everything you order is put in that bill. We had beers /cocktails / the bed came to 30 pounds for a couple
189,Beautiful,The lagoon is gorgeous. The challenge is to spot where to spend the day There are more secluded spaces. But also some near to the snack bars.
190,mid morning earlrlt afternoon visit great beach good facilities,"This is such a lovely beach, lovely clear water and stunning scenery.I could sit and watch the paragliders flying and landing all day.It’s meant to be great for sunsets which sadly didn’t see whilst staying here."
191,Mark and lozzy,"Not the cleanest of beaches and, regardless of the hype, the sea water is cleaner than that in the lagoon. Food not that special either. You're better off spending the day on the beach."
192,Perfect beach ,"This magnificent beach spans both the shimmering Mediterranean Sea and a tranquil blue lagoon. The sheltered lagoon is perfect for leisurely swimming, kayaking, and stand-up paddleboarding, while the Mediterranean side is a popular anchoring point for sailboats and yachts. During fair weather conditions, keep an eye out for paragliders cruising overhead. Aside from the small village of Ölüdeniz, the lagoon and a sizable section of the adjacent Taurus Mountains are protected as part of Ölüdeniz Tabiat reserve. Within the reserve, a well-marked hiking trail leads to the abandoned town of Kayaköy. Approximately 20,000 Greek Orthodox residents left the town in 1923 as part of a population exchange agreement between Greece and Turkey following the land grabs of the Greco-Turkish war. It takes about two-and-a-half hours to reach the town, where numerous homes, fountains, and two Greek Orthodox churches remain largely untouched since their abandonment."
193,Beautuful,A must visit !! The blue lagoon is stunning. There is a public beach on the entrance to the lagoon and a number of private beaches around the lagoon all about 20 minutes walk from Oludeniz. Sandy beaches clear water and amazing place.
194,not what you think,"What can I say about this hotel,this has been our 2nd holiday there & like the 1st one it was absolutely a great place to visit. The staff are very hands on & very intentive to all our needs nothing was to much. Hotel itself is cleaned daily has very pictureresque location . All your needs very close to the hotel as in bars ,restaurants & night life."
195,Looks great from 6000 ft above in a paraglide.,"To be honestly we dont know why it’s so hyped! Yes the sea is beautiful but not rarely or something. The toilets are far away and the foodcorners are way too expensive with bad quality and bad services. I mean, how can you mess up fries? they were one bad piece of oil sponges! So bad! Nice to go ones, but not so special to base my holiday again around hete because of the sea!"
196,Lush,"Fantastic, awesome, a must try, really enjoyed😍😎 I would be happy to come back here year after year, I could not say any day we had was a bad day, just what we needed after working hard all year, the only thing we didn't try was the paragliding! Next time though for sure!"
197,Great beach for youngsters as shallow,Row of shops and restaurants and lots of paragliding overhead. Lots of stones leading down to the beach. Loungers and umbrellas are available for hire.
198,Varied spots to sunbathe and sand on some parts,Wonderful Ambience/great choice bars/eateriesFabulous scenery/sunrises/sunsetsCrystal Clear Waters
199,Relaxing beach,All i can say about this place AMAZING!!Need to say more though as trip advisor wants more!! Beautiful must place to visit
200,Wonderful,"Better than previous negatives,3* not perfect but better than some comments that were aimed at this place,if you have a open mind & remember the staff are over stretched but very helpful you will have a great holiday, food was good better than some of the over priced hotels I've been to but if you think your special I advise you pay a special price and go elsewhere as this is for people who understand the value of a budget holiday & realize that some times you get more than you have bargained for if you take off your blinkers."
201,Back again,Very charming place but started to be very very crowded with cheap tourists... noisy music and stupid shows by night. Should be as a start point to visit around but not to stay 100 % there
202,Paradise,"Not impressed by this supposed national park, rammed with sunbeds and families everywhere litter all over the place and the stench of sewage.A real shame as lovely area and views."
203,Worth a visit,Swiming in a crystal clear water in a boat trip and Paraglide makes this place special and a must visit place in Turkey.
204,Must see,"I was very disappointed with the beach, it was slightly coarse sand as you got on it but the nearer you got to the sea the more it becomes pebbles, you definitely need to have beach shoes on, the sea was very warm once you got in and a beautiful light blue colour."
205,Walk,"Very nice to swim here but some times ou face strong waves if it is windy, also the stones are rough if u walk with ur bare foot."
206,Overrated beach,"I'm reviewing the main beach. I think everyone would realise there is no sand at oludeniz but it's almost like builders gravel at the top. Bigger stones at the waters edge which is fine. Take water shoes. The sea is lovely, beautifully blue unlike the lagoon which despite the presence of fish resembles a stagnant pond, what's dissapointing is how poor the up keep of the beach is. Very dirty in best bit places and I saw broken glass as well. Love the sea for a quick swim but couldn't sit down there all day, sunbeds also very poor looking, take your own towel and just sit on that. Recommend Mandellini beach bar though right on the beach."
207,Beautiful,Pebble beach and definitely not for children was in deep before I knew it !!! Go to the Blue Lagoon with children (still pebbles) but  far safer
208,Lovely relaxing beach,Such a stunning area and place. We spent a lot of our time in Oludeniz here just as shame so many people leave their rubbish on the beach? Such a beautiful area ruined by people not being responsible. A nice place for food and drink would be good too as all the same junk food. Healthy food please!!
209,Beautiful ,The lagoon is beautiful and a must if you’re staying in the area. Late in the season oct\nov you practically get it to yourself!
210,a must see and do,We visited this beach club several times - the man who runs it is a true delight - friendly & super helpfulYou can order drinks from your sunbed & they will be brought to you Lunch menu is very goodWe also went for an evening meal - which was absolutely fantastic - great setting & good foodThey will pick you up too & take you back at the end of the dayJust fantastic - a wonderful way to spend the day with fantastic views - calm warm water too
211,Beautiful ,"We visited twice during our two week stay the first visit was hot and we went to the seahorse beach ,the second was just before the storm .Highly recommended"
212,Sunny day at bluish lagoon,"Oludeniz is one of the best place for adventures sports , You can sail in the sea and fly in the air, witnessing the best of mother nature.People are very friendly and generous, food is wonderful, locals prefer to speak Turkish……for paragliding – consider one of the best places on earth with clear blue sky & sea…..Places to visit.Blue lagoon, Butter fly valley, paragliding – tandem flying, Fethiye market (big town near Oludeniz), snorkeling and may more……"
213,Disappointed ,Paid to walk through but didn’t use the beds as overcast daySat on the beach but wasn’t that impressed with the cleanliness I. Glass and lots of beer bottle and water bottle tops.... come on time to stop leaving litter people but also time for those who run the beach to clean up!Even better from the air when you try the paragliding!
214,The main beach Oludeniz,"We went on a Thursday and it was very, very busy. Loungers and an umbrella are extra - the photo here is deceptive, there are literally hundreds of loungers carpeting the fine shingle. Access to the sea requires tough soles - a bit like extreme reflexology....."
215,"Perfect for snorkelling, but a bit dirty ","Spent a couple of days on the main beach whilst staying in Hisaronu.  We took taxis to get there as they are cheap and easy (only 30 lira) and got the bus back (19 lira for all 4 of us)We picked the area of the beach nearest where the main strip leaves the promenade as it is convenient for the shop and slushie stalls although if you pay for sun beds the attendants will happily get drinks etc for you.  We got 4 beds and 2 umbrellas which were 15 lira each for the whole day.  I saw some people complaining about the price but this is a lot cheaper than Spain.The beach itself is quite steep and pebbly and is quite difficult to get into but once in is warm and has some good waves.  You really need water shoes to get in and you can see people without struggling which can be quite funny at times.We walked up to the lagoon area which was absolutely heaving and wasn’t worth staying at.  The pictures you see from high up are much nicer than at ground level although the beach was sandy and calm.Overall, a great beach for a fun day out."
216,Paradise Beach club,The water is beautiful but the beach was way too busy... it was awkward to lay less than a foot away from the next person - almost like laying down next to a stranger...
217,Beautiful,"I do not reccomend anyone visiting Ölüdeniz main beach, try visiting the less crowded ones. It was dirty and 2 meters deep after few steps. PS: there’s no sand, all stones, bring plastic shoes."
218,Bit of a let down,The color of the sea and the harmony of nature is perfect. water temperature ideal. The pebbles do not disturb your foot.The view is great
219,Beautiful ,"This is an amazing lagoon. The water is so clean and clear. Great for swimming and snorkelling. Hire a pedlo for 50lira for an hr...dead cheap. Was great just peddling around the lagoon. Quiet and peaceful. Has a fantastic beach club at seahorse beach. Great for food, drink and shishaDef worth the visit!!"
220,Picturesque ,"one of the best beaches , but pebbles beach. Make sure you wear proper footwear. You can rent the sun umbrella for 15TL and sun bed for another 15TL. But if your stay is around 1 week, it is more economical to buy the sun umbrella and a foam cushion"
221,Billy's beach,"This was our second visit to the Blue Lagoon.   Such a beautiful place, but such a shame that people think it's okay to leave their cigarette butts littered in the sand and sea. Very sad to see. Not sure I'll visit again for that reason."
222,Amazing ,Almost talcum powder sand. One or two stones to avoid before swim depth. Clear water for first 3 or 4 meters . Then fine for swimming but not snorkeling as water then murky.Good spot to relax excellent salads worth 2/3 visits. Charges incurred.
223,Just so touristy ,"The Blue Lagoon is anything but blue, it is a almost stagnant mosquito lake, there is very little movement in the water which is very cloudy, when you take a look at the surface of the water it resembles a oil slick, that could just be the suntan oils off peoples bodies or could come from the boats along the beachfront, there is also a very strong smell of drains and sewage in the air which we noticed when walking to the Seahorse beach club, we wish that we had not bothered to go there as when we returned to our hotel we realised we each had between 15-20 mosquito bites, be aware that the main beach is a safer option."
224,Swimming/Food,"Amazing nature and beauty of lagoon... one of the most special place in the world...We visit end of october which means end of season.. was empty and peaceful... But summer time impossible to go and not reccomended for sure.... during summer season legally 3000 sun bed placed! This kind of precious places has to ve run by the concious professional stuf educated by gov.etc. there is no respect to people no respect nature, no respect silence and peace... There is one  horrible place ""blue lagoon cafe"" (horrible because of the owner not by decoration! ) run by the rude uneducated young mens they are fully money oriented, spreading violent energy full of men no women worker at all... only focus to cheat the forigner tourist and they hate of Turkish tourist...so pitty we wrote about all this to Turkish tourism office  and minister office by mail... this kind of place must  be protected....For sure  has to be visit! But  out of season!"
225,Ticked off bucket list,This beach charges 7TL per person for entry before renting sun beds or an umbrella.  We found it rather crowded but we fortunately arrived early and were lucky enough to see some small turtles.  The water was beautifully clear.  Unfortunately during the afternoon a sewage type smell blew up!  We only went once during our weeks stay as we preferred watching the paragliders on the other (free) beach.
226,Seahorse beach,The beach is not blue as I expected from pictures. But it's still nice. I like the atmosphere with all the restos and shops along the beach. It's a rocky beach and you need food water shoes. You can walk all the way to the end and pay to go to blue lagoon. Again not blue so disappointed but clear and calm. Still rocky and need water shoes. You can pedalo jump in water. There is a resto nearby. I recommend these beach.
227,Walk to this little paradise! ,This beach is beautiful. If you visit Turkey you must visit here. Near by you can do water sports and paragliding which is an amazing experience.The colour of the sea is like no where else.
228,Blue Lagoon Hotel OLU DENIZ TURKEY,"Absolutely wonderful, breathtaking place, loved every minute. You can just relax and forget about everything. Nice places to have a meal and drink around too."
229,crystal clear turquoise sea,"This is a beautiful place and I regret that we only briefly visited and should have spent the full day. There is a small charge to enter thr lagoon and I believe there is a charge for sunbeds,although we didn't do this :("
230,Wonderfully Relaxing,"This is a beautiful beach and a must if you're anywhere near this area.The beach is accessible to every one, but if you wish to rent a couple of chairs and umbrella then expect to pay 45TL... a bargain."
231,Day out ,"We were told that the blue lagoon was the best place to relax on the beach, so we were recommended by the Thomas cook rep that sea horse beach was good, so we took a short taxi ride from our hotel there. It cost 25 liere for entry, use of sun lounger and parasol for the day. The lagoon is split and separated by hotel/cafe,bars who all charge to gain entry, not sure of there costs. The sea horse beach is sandy which is a nice change from the pebbles of the main beach, and with only a small current makes a nice beach for small children, and non strong swimmers. You can hire out pedalows, canoes, etc and explore the other sides of the lagoon which we did, if you are lucky there are turtles to be spotted, sadly we didn't the water is beautiful and clear in the shallows but not as blue as I was expecting.  Blue lagoon is worth a visit while in the area and lots of choice as to which part of the lagoon you visit. If you do not like fish swimming around you stay out of the water."
232,Must visit,"As vibrant as ever, paragliders galore, boats leaving in the morning, a whole range and choice of bars and restaurants to visit - what more can you say - pictures say everything."
233,Not as expected ,"We again opted for the more expensive Seahorse Club beach. It is now 25TL per person (~£3.10 each) to get in but it is sooooo worth that, plus it runs a free shuttle bus back to most hotels in Oludeniz and Hisaronu/Ovacik which drops you off at the door. Always calmer and more chilled than other beaches with a lovely bar area where you can sit and eat in the shade, or bring drinks back to the beach.The water is (as always) beautiful and crystal clear, and if you don't want to swim out across the lagoon, you can now hire canoes (single or double) and pedaloes. I recommend the swimming though - floating in the middle of the lagoon is just a wonderful feeling. They have cordoned off an area which marks the edge of where it goes from waist height to deep water if you're not confident in water. Definitely recommend this place for a chilled day at the beach. BLIISS"
234,Beautiful,Been here many times. Water always claer and warm. Difficult to get in and out because the bottom slopes sharply down and the waves batter you a bit. Over shoes recommended because its stoney.
235,Free bus from the hotel to billys beach ,"The blue lagoon was lovely to swim in, but it's just so packed, with beds so close together. The water is sectioned off with rope as well to separate areas for swimming, boating, and private beach areas etc. I'm glad I visited, but it's not the picturesque lagoon you think it's going to be and we only went for one afternoon during an 11 night holiday!"
236,A bit disappointing ,"Oludeniz is a must see place. It is very beautiful but very crowded. I highly recommend you to go to a private beach they are affordable. If you go to the public beach it will be very crowded so don’t go to the puhlic beach. There was also so much traffic while entering the public beach. Also it is very hot in August so you better go in June or July. The water was turquoise, very calm and crystal clear."
237,Fantastic beach,"Best location at the Blue Logoon, good food, exceptional service by Jamal. Thank you, see you next year!"
238,Beautiful,"Not much to speak, it's one of the best places must go in Turkey.Try paragliding, rafting and Turkish kebap. There are a lots of activities around but don't miss blue lagoon."
239,Beautiful! ,Just spent a week in Oludeniz and after reading other reviews thought I would try the Blue Lagoon. I found it very untidy with lots of cigarette butts left around and also a babies nappy. The general feel is dowdy and not well looked after. On the plus side it is safer to swim in and there are various activities available.
240,stunning,Olu Deniz beach is beautiful but the litter lets it down. Surely the powers that be must realise they have a fantastic location that draws in the holidaymakers but the litter is putting people off. The cost of keeping it clean is far cheaper than losing tourism. I noticed it was locals as well as tourists that were culprits. Put up signs in various locations asking people to respect the area and if necessary start introducing penalties. The famous Blue Lagoon is also suffering from the same problem.
241,Thought it was good,This is a piece of unspoiled beauty my sister and I paid a very small fee 7lira to enter national park and chilled at the beach the lagoon is stunning shallow water to swim in. Totally chilling. The other side of lagoon there are a few hotels but not peaceful the National Park side is far superior. There’s some refreshments you can eat on the beach. It’s clean safe there’s lounger’s and brolly’s and thankfully no boom boom music!!! Just peace.
242,"Scruffy,filthy ",It's a very long coastline so if you like walking you'll come across beautiful beaches. Don't settle down the first one you see. And the water 'pureness' used to be better back then. Just try to get ahead of the crowd and swim away. its much better.
243,Stunning,"Wow this place is spectacular. I couldn't believe how blue the sea is here, it's a real picture postcard moment. The water is so clear and has so many shades of blue in it when you just sit and look out into it. This place has such a chilled out vibe nestled between mountains,the sky dotted with parigliders.a great spot to put your snorkel on and explore under the still waters. This place made my holiday."
244,Great beaches,"One of the most beautiful beaches i’ve been to. The area is a well known paragliding spot and the best way to see the beauty of this beach is definitely from above. Paragliding isn't something I would normally do as i’m scared of heights but in the name of photography I bit the bullet, jumped off Babadağ mountain and soared over the lagoon. I managed to take the attached photo inbetween hyperventilating. Well worth a visit if you're in the area, the turquoise and emerald calm waters also make it the perfect place to take a dip!"
245,Beautiful,"Visited Easter Sunday as we were staying in Fethiye for the week - booked into Blue Star for a night - have stayed here 3 times and knew it would be open ( one of only about half a dozen hotels open at this time) pristine cleanliness as ever and great to catch up with Mehmet and family/staffTook a walk around to see what changes had taken place since last AugustLots of building going on still - season about to start in a week but so farSOK supermarket opposite Belcehan Beach hotel on top road has popped up and another supermarket between Marcan Beach hotel and the Mavruka has opened but doesn’t look good to the eye - Azda has been replaced with another supermarket but Sanctury Spa remainsKarbel Sun has put bedrooms in the space which once was the breakfast room but they had a lot of work still left to do in time for opening, we saw a tractor in the dining room and the whole place looked very much a building siteFurther down we saw the biggest change - Karbel have bought out the Flying Dutchman and replaced Buffalo Steakhouse with concrete buildings which will become shopping outlets - looks awful - and on the corner towards the White hotel some 3 storey rooms with balcony’s - solid stone and so very different to the open space where Elvis performed Tuesday and Fridays - great music videos were a pleasure to listen to whilst enjoying great food - so no neon Vegas sign lights the strip anymore - we joked  Elvis has well and truly left the building and the building went too! but in truth I’m sad about this change.Shadows bar had many workers busying about and I could see they had moved the bar yet again - not open yetMavi Belche has been demolished and replaced with same style building next door (which used to be part of Mavi Belche) but now expensive place to stay - can’t recall name - didn’t check to see if wall was still through pool!On Dolmus road Swallows is still an eyesore - another tourist shop opened on the corner selling paragliding and day trips “like they any more” Adam was open in “One for the road” and has a new addition to the family “Whisky” a golden Labrador very tiny but going to be spoilt a lot - sadly Lucky is no more. His deputy ( sorry can never remember his name ) has gone - but he was such a lovely genuine guy he will be missed.Asena Beach was open but garden bar was not - nor was bar opposite but Ramos was open for the football and was telling us the drag act was due to come down next day from Hisaronu - not sure if this bar is NJOY or is that the one on the corner opposite garden bar? Cherry Chow was open but didn’t walk down that far so don’t ask about Bloody Gorgeous - expect he is still there though.All the shops/pop up stalls are still there - we caught up with the guy who creates miniature glass animals - so skilful and always nice to meet up with him.Over near/behind Kumasi Pide they are completing a nice looking hotel Belcekum Beach but could they be apartments?Few boats were taking day trippers out and sun beds had been put out - paragliders were not out on Sunday as it was windy but by Monday morning they filled the sky once moreOn the beach a new bar “Farnkys” has opened by the Dolmus stop - handy for anyone waiting for a bus - wanting to chill or witness a great sunset - lovely comfy blue cushions and 2 great friendly guys own it - also Crusoes set to open up again next week so together with the nearly completed Buzz bar it will be like old times - albeit Effes was around 22 - 25 lira and exchange rate was a little above 7 to the British pound."
246,Beautiful,"The 'Blue Lagoon' is classed as the main attraction in Oludeniz i.e. Idyllic, which I have to say it was on my last visit 25 years ago. I know things change, but if this is 'progress'... Oh dear. It is incredibly disappointing. I know August is really busy, but I've never seen so many people crammed into one area. I believe it it supposed to be a conservation area but it is being ruined by so many people funnelled into the tiny area. Many tourists were knocking down branches and plants to park their arses in the shade.It felt dirty, cramped and quite simply, just a money making venture. No idea what the thousands of pounds they have to be taking in everyday is being spent on... Left after two hours. Vile and very, very disappointing."
247,a dream to swim in this water,A lot more sunbeds this year .restaurant was poor.exchange rate poor.change money before you go.it is just as good on main beach if you buy some rubber shoes for the sea
248,Amazing place,Depends on what part on the beach you go on as can be very slippery going into the sea trying to get across the flat rocks. But the sea is warm even in October. I would advise to buy the rubber shoes to go into the sea as they then stop the pebbles and rocks hurting tour feet and do give you some grip if you are bathing at the front of the lagoon. At the front the rocks are slippy but at the side there are some sharp small rocks and pebbles. Then at the back where there is not much breeze it is a little easier to walk into the sea. There are some self service bars there that serve food and drinks etc and are quiet reasonably priced. The sun lounger and parasol are extra to the entrance fee you pay to get on the beach. Try and make sure you have the correct lira for the beds as twice the man told us he would bring back what he owed us and never did.
249,Beach for lying on your back.,Costs 7 Turkish lira to access this beach but that’s less than £1 at current exchange rate. Lovely beach but take beach shoes as is a stoney beach. Sun bed and parasol you have to pay for but you have to pay for this on every beach. Lovely place
250,Beautiful beach,A Pebbled beach with paragliders landing around you. Water was lovely to swim in. The loungers were priced more than what we have been paying for at other beaches in Antalya and it was grubby. The beach wasn’t as clean as the others we’ve been too had litter and cigarette butts.
251,Dirty and overcrowded,"It extends for more than 2 kilometers starting with a marina from which marine cruises take off, also there is the landing spot for paragliding tours, there are many free and paid shores , the best one lies at the other end of the shore ( the blue lagoon), ticket: tl 7 per person, add to this tl 15 per chislung and tl 20 per an ambrellaI recommend that you take a pedol for tl 50 and cruise around this glass clear water and you may get lucky to watch sea turtles, i was 😀"
252,Dissapointed,"We were charged to get onto the blue lagoon and charged further for sun lougners. What baffled us was that, the blue lagoon is basically Tiger beach, with a rope across it (same strecth of beach and sea). Tiger beach is alot closer, has a bar and is also free"
253,"Crowded, smelly and noisy",Me and my wife went to blue lagoon last week....it was as superb as we had its talks with many ppl earlier....the water is crystal clear and shallow in the beginning....it’s one of the most maintained beaches of turkey ....has a good amount of small restaurants n u can also avail water sports right on the spot...simply awesome...
254,Fantastic beach,Go to one of the many private beaches around the lagoon....a small price to pay. We chose Seahorse beach which had a lovely restaurant. Pedaloes and canoes are for hire.
255,Take care or it will be ruined.......,"We used the GREEN PINE BEACH CLUB during our stay in OLU DENIZ and all I can say is check them out !!Friendly, helpful staff, sunbeds with mattresses and cabanas at very reasonably rates and free use of hammocks in the shade when required"
256,Enjoyable days at the Blue Lagoon!,They are selling a 50cc beer for 20 liras and very crowded! I wouldn’t recommend this place or other ones in this beach!
257,Beach,This area is beautiful but sadly you are sandwiched so close to each other you can barely walk between chairs
258,Peacefull,"In this day &,age as a matter of urgency we should be trying to protect the planet  Sadly on this my 4th visit to olu deniz i found this not to be the case 1) the blue lagoon was filled with rubbish on the beach &in the bushes . We watched the local inhabitants leave it .2)olu deniz beach we watched as people just dropped &left again local inhabitants 3) went to dalyan again watched locals put cigarettes out in the sand &their children digging which is forbidden .its where the endangered turtles lsy their eggs Do they not realise if they carry on treating it like this they will lose the tourism?  Everytime i come it gets worse . Simple solutions put up more signs have someone patrol the beaches &fine people for dropping all the rubbish .Old saying dont bite the hand that feeds . Sadly thats what they are doing"
259,Beautiful,"Entrance was 8tl and and a sun bed was 2tl which I thought was excellent value.  There were showers and toilets in several places, a shop and a couple of restaurant/bars.  It really is stunning there with the turquoise sea and the lush greenery all around."
260,Second visit to Seahorse Club at the Blue Lagoon - BLISS!!! Pay the extra and go here!,My summer holiday this year in Oludeniz was a huugeeeee and outmost revelation ever! I never expected a place to be even more gorgeous than on the photos! Oludeniz beach that ends with stunning Blue Lagoon is a Turkish Copakabana..😎Clear blue waters with white stones ...nice beach bars and even sometimes stubborn waves were so much fun!Visit Mandellina and Sunset beach bars and DON'T get out of the cristal blue sea!
261,Beautiful place to visit.,"This long, pebble beach is well worth a visit. Look up and you'll see dozens of paragliders in the air (we also saw two crash land in the sea!)Sunbeds are spread out and cost 15 Turkish Lira to hire. Sun umbrellas are also 15 TL each.The sea is calm and clean. A large section of it is 'roped off' from passing boats. No jet skis, so apart from the odd party boat all is fairly quiet. Spent several happy days on this beach!"
262,Most beautiful place ,"Walk through the beach from the begining of Belcegiz to Kumburnu ( Sandy jutting) , stop there, watch the tons of Blue, right side Oludeniz ( Deadsea! - Lagoon)."
263,Lovely beach - better than the main one,Absolutely fantastic. We went 4  years ago to a wedding so went back again this year. Must say going back again. The sea is like walking into a bath
264,Love the lagoon. ,"We tried private side, don't pay to get in, instead go to the right and follow road, first beach you come to is green pine beach, brand new loungers wooden ones very spaced out, a real lovely relaxing beach, bar restaurant etc"
265,Greenpine beach,"What a beautiful part of Turkey. We will be back to Oludenez, it was so special to be here with all the family and friends."
266,So beautiful,"Have always loved the private beach, but it's now more crammed with a mishmash of poor quality sun beds and parasols it's everything about a holiday resort I hate, the beach after Bayrwm holiday was dirty with visitors rubbish....I'm afraid was disappointed this year for first time.Kidrak much nicer if your idea of enjoying a beach isn't being surrounded by beds and rubbish..."
267,very busy,Loads to do. Loads of beds Beautiful. Lots of restaurants and everyone is lovely. Not pushy at all. Really enjoying our stay
268,Family holiday,"Not a relaxing place at all, music is loud in all of the places you pay for entry and you’re crammed in like a sardine.The beach is mud with some brown sand sprinkled over like a bad cake."
269,Be Aware ,Unfortunately after visiting every year for twenty years we avoided going back this year. Traffic is horrendous and tailed back up the mountain road and beyond. Disappointed as it’s a beautiful beach and the lagoon is amazing. We were there during a Turkish holiday so it be easier to get there now
270,Lovely,"Admittedly I went on one of the busiest days of the year, but, it was packed, chaotic and awful. Reminded me of a refugee camp! I guess it might be lovely at other times though.Luckily I only saw it briefly as I swam over from the Sugar Beach resort, which btw was the opposite; chilled and relaxed."
271,Beach Club,"Not much to say, pictures say it all. Just go visit. You will not be disappointed. A most peaceful and tranquil of beaches when we visited in Nov though very crowded in the summer. Water lovely to swim in, not deep and easy to swim in. Perfect weather all week full sun. Delightful."
272,Julie Ridley ,We visited during the day and the surroundings are something to see...We returned in late afternoon one day and went for a swim in the crystal clear blue water near the entrance to the lagoon.. The water was warm and theres a cool vibe about the place...as you go further in to the logoon it was busier with families as the water is shallow... theres a small charge for sunbeds if you want one...There is also an entrance fee to park of 7tl per person which is less than £1..
273,Visit ,This beach is very easily accessible by public transportation but you'd have to pay a small entrance fee to reach a side of the beach where water is calmer for swimming.
274,Ask for Jamal!,"Ölüdeniz Beach is beutifully set, surrounded by craggy limestone mountains forested on their lower slopes.  The Mediterranean water is crystal clear, and fish are occasionally visible.  The beach is clean but pebbly, so it can be a bit difficult to walk (water shoes or sandals recommended).  Unfortunately, it is crowded with tourists (us!) in the hot months.  At this time the water can be so warm it might not be refreshing.   Tourist amenities are available, but prices are a bit high (e.g., 25 TL for a beach chair and umbrella which you need as it gets hot).  The town of Ölüdeniz fronts the beach; cafes, restaurants, bakeries, food markets, ice cream stands, and ATMs are readily available.  It is entertaining to watch the frequent paragliders touch down near the beach.  Water shoes, sunscreen, lots of water, and a hat are recommended.  The beach is open at all times without charge, but some areas are restricted to private clubs with charges for chairs, umbrellas, and other amenities."
275,Beautiful unspoilt beach,We got married here in 2011 so to return again for the third time I was unsure if it would still be as pretty but my goodness it still took my breath away it is such a beautiful place can't wait to return next year.
276,no point in paying,"Easy to access via a shuttle bus from most hotels in the area. Well worth the effort to come here instead of the main beach at Belcekiz, Oludeniz. A nice clean bar, not too expensive either with seats in the shade for when the day gets too hot. Lovely soft sand, plenty of space to relax and well marked out areas to help you choose deeper water or more shallow for small ones. The water was warm and clean with loads of little fish swimming around in it. The sunbeds were a bit tired looking, but as they're free if you come from certain hotels then you can't really complain, easily covered with your own towel."
277,Incredible blue water and nice beach area with options for a quiet or busier spots.,"even if you travel alone,there,s plenty company here and a choice of refreshments,or chill out for a quiet day"
278,Dirty and crowded,"A lovely area but our visit was ruined by the surly staff we encountered, particularly the young man taking the money for our sunbeds. He was exceptionally rude and obviously did not care about customer service in any form. Other staff were also rather off-hand. This place needs to sort itself out. We will not be going back."
279,It's ok I guess,"Lovely relaxing day, swimming, snorkelling, and sunbathing and watching the paragliders drift past in a beautiful location. The lagoon area was clean and well looked after, small fee to enter the area and 45tl for sunbeds/parasol but worth it."
280,Relaxing,Extremely popular and trying to meet Covid rules appears to be a challenge for those actually using the beach. There are better beaches within a short taxi ride away.
281,spoilt by commercialism,there are canoes and other craft to hire to go round the lagoon and umbrellas and recliners to hire on the beach mainly sand but a few stones as shallow the water is warm and separated from the boats for safety.also fee to get into the area only 7 lira a day
282,Beautiful,"Stayed in nearby Hisaronu just as we have a few years ago and had to visit here. It's beautiful. To sroll along the beach to the Blue Lagoon is a rewarding walk and in the centre of Oludeniz, there's a great feel with all the paragliders landing around you."
283,Little gem,"Not as good as it is made out to be,in brochures.Nice place tho..Seen better places.still worth a visit .Nowhere clean as clean as what we thought."
284,Beautiful blue sea and sky,"Oludeniz Beach  is one of the most beautiful beaches in Turkey. You cannot go to Turkey and not visit this Beach, and you cannot visit Oludeniz Beach and not indulge yourself in paragliding. About 100 metres from the Beach are some amazing restaurants offering toothsome sea food and local beer. After 6 PM, when the place gets darker, it turns into a complete party place. Do get drunk only if you have a cab, or you are residing nearby. Most people (like us) stay at places at some distance, like Fethiye etc. If you are one of them, it is advisable to leave by 7 PM or so - though the place is safe!"
285,Not as advertised!!!!,This is a must see in Olu Deniz and only costs 7 lira to enter.I think it was about £2 ish for a sun bed and the same for umbrellas.The water is shallow until you go past the warning lines where the sea drops.The food and drinks were reasonable within the lagoon.
286,A beautiful enclosed sea,"Lovely, but beware the shingle...can be a little painful underfoot.  Well worth the entrance fee of 7tl"
287,Very poor beach,"One day before i been to Çalış in Fethiye Center and i can say that there is a huge difference between these 2. Ölüdeniz/ Belcekız ia really wonderful. It is so clean , just blue and no wave"
288,Nice trip,"It's not clear which part of the lagoon all the reviews refer to? This review is for the lagoon that you pay to visit on the main front at oludeniz. We have stayed at Oludeniz over a number of years and always visited the lagoon beach clubs,Billy's beach,Sugar Beach etc.  This year we decided to visit the lagoon area that you pay 7 lira to access. What a disappointment it was horrible,dirty,full of broken furniture,litter and like the local land fill!! How anyone could spend anytime on this dirty scruffy beach area is hard to believe!! This is meant to be a natural park of beauty,not sure what the entrance fee is being spent on or are there too many people visiting and ruining it? Such a shame it's so dirty.We left and went round to the other lagoon area.very disappointed."
289,Overcrowded,i thought when i saw this in the holiday broochure sit would be spectacular. Nope you don't rareally get to this part that is in the brochures. The water is turquoise and amazing to see it is also warm but can be a little rough at times.worth having a swim in though that is for sure.i went to Tiger Beach which for me was far better than Billy's Beach and it is free especially for those on a budget.
290,Loved it! ,"This beach is called Belcekız (Belcegiz) beach by the locals. It is a beautiful long beach. There are cool places around to spend time eating and drinking or booking for a trip. At the end of the beach you can go up the stairs and watch it from above, you will be having a great landscape."
291,Where's the blue???,What can be said other than it's one of those placed you have to visit if your in the area. I would recommend hiring a boat and a snorkel to see all the fish and hopefully see turtles if you're lucky. Prices on the beach are good. 15TL for an Efes for example.
292,Bliss,Oludeniz isn't what it used to be. Bars and clubs are run by gangs and thugs which leaves you on edge with a bitter taste in your mouth. Cocktails for £7 with hardly any booze in of the bars or clubs. Hard selling in the majority of the shops and stalls. You're better off going to Spain
293,Busy,good beach loungers and parasols didnt appreciate someone checking i had a piece of thread on each piece of the good as every hour but hey ho
294,Swam the lagoon,Disappointing how humans can destroy such a beautiful placeExtremeley dirty and bad preserved. So sad
295,Beautiful place,"Spent a day here last week with my sister - in - law, but almost didn't make it due to some of the very negative reviews.  I am so glad we took the chance as we thoroughly enjoyed our day, and found everything very reasonable.  I'm sure in the height of season it could feel overcrowded but this was not the case this month.We found the beach very clean and the water was lovely, surprisingly warm.  The food in the restaurant was very nice and very reasonable, I took someone's advice in a previous review and tried the banana colada, absolutely beautiful! The toilets were clean, and there was also a shower provided.  Great getting the free bus back at the end of the day to our hotel.  Planning a return visit to Turkey in 2020 and will definitely be visiting Billy's Beach again as we had a perfect day."
296,Day trip ,"Oh dear. Unless there is a better policy on fag buts and plastic bottles put in place, I would not recommend visiting, you will be disappointed. They badly need litter pickers to save this. Food in restaurant was good"
297,Expensive and crowded,I didn't believe at first when I saw the pictures on the internet of this place. But it is all real and beautiful. Spent amazing days over here.
298,Beautiful,"Oludeniz is the Turkish equivalent of ""Ballermann style Mallorca""... cheap , touristy, not clean, horrible dirty sunbeds on the beach, loud music, unattentive staff at most places (exception Jade restaurant and Oyster Residences)"
299,Amazingly blue,"Date of travel: Sep-07-2018Mode: Istanbul to Dalamaan Airline: Turkish AirlinesPeople: Me and my wife and our two young kids aged 4 and 6On Sep/7 we embarked on the trip to Oludeniz. Following advice from fellow travelers on various forums we decided to take a flight from Istanbul to Dalamaan Airport and then taxi to Oludeniz beach.Flight was great. Departed on time and they served a simple fried cheese sandwich and drinks. Landing was spectacular. Plane approaches behind from a mountain and then descends. You get lovely view. Dalamaan airport was deserted. I think it is under construction. Very new but with few facilities. Decided to change my currency - clerk there didn't want to give me smaller notes. So I have to beg her little bit. Given I was travelling with wife and young kids - decided to bite a bullet and get a taxi. It is expensive it cost me 40 Euro. But Dalamaan Airport is pretty far away from Oludeniz. About 1.5 hours ride. Taxi driver was mean, ill mannered and reckless driver. He constantly broke the speed record and was driving pretty much wrong side of the road. We reached our destination by a miracle of God. Dumped our bags and then head out towards the beach. Hotel was only 5 minutes away from the beach. You will find all sorts of shops on the way - food / stores / beach stuff related / high-end restaurants / tours.It was 1500 hours and beach was not too much crowded. It was hot. They rent out lounge chairs and umbrellas for TL 30 - don't forget to get them.Kids and wife went into water - I decided stay back and took photos. Only thing I hate - is the folks smoking every where. I can't think of any place where they are so many smokers (perhaps in Russia?). There are boats offering tours to nearby islands. They are parked right at the beach. If you like speed boat experience there are couple of shops there as well. As far as beach sand is concerned - it is bit rocky and leaves white stains on your skin due to excess of calcium carbonate. If you are allergic - better wear a mask.However I would highly recommend you to visit this place. Oludeniz is bit on pricey side because of the European tourists - prices often get quoted in Euros and GBP."
