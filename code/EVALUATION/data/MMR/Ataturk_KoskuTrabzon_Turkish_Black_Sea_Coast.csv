0,It was ok,"Nothing spectacular, just a small house with a small fountain. Nothing special I would say unless u want to see the house of Ataturk. Wouldn't come all the way for it though"
1,Beautiful palace with nice views,Great location. It is in the park. I wish I had a house like that . Don't expect too much. Need renovations for lighting. Some lights are missing some of them replaced by led lighting and it's not matching with nature of items.
2,City Symbol,"You wont miss very much unless you are a fan of Atatürk. A simple mansion, but with an interesting photo collection upstairs."
3,"Tour, couples","Some ppl adviced us to miss it, but it is actually worth visiting. its nice to c the details of the house, plus its perched up in a v. nice place."
4,Nothing special ,"good place to take pictures,a little cafe,a little garden,well kept.its only need 45 minutes to see."
5,Lovely property ,"A little slice of history starting from the 1900 to 1940s, beautiful location and building. Strongly recommend having a tour with a good guide, because every piece of furniture has a story."
6,"Beautiful, but too crowded","Yesterday I was there. Its a little gem in a beautiful garden at the top of the hill. All the furniture and decoration is original.Atatürk was staying there while his visits Trabzon. Most interesting and important thing  is, this is the place where he wrote his will  donating everything he owns to Turkish nation."
7,Interesting but very busy ,"If you searching an instagramable location this is the place. The entrance is cheap, get a nice view and spot everywhere and some historical stuff. It is also a nice place to chill out or visit with friends. Visitin the place during snow days can be tricky to walk. The place is very easy to reach even by the local bus"
8,Shopping,It is nice to visit no much things to see... The palace garden was beautiful .. Nothing to know about Ataturk  Information was very poor
9,Worth A Visit,"If you like to see some historic pics of turkey history and see the city landscape, it's a perfect place."
10,A house in the forest ,"Visiting fee is 9 TL, however it deserve it, great place to visit and have a cup of tea in the garden. You can wonder inside the palace and take pictures. Enjoy"
11,Nice to visit ,very beautiful garden and a beautiful house. there is a cafe to have rest. you climb a lot by car or bus but the view worth it.
12,Must see Trabzon attraction,Went there during Trabzon tour. There is not that much to see in the city. but really nice to visit the villa since you are already there. Only costs 2 TL for Adults and 1 TL for children
13,Çok çok yaşa Mustafa Kemal Paşa,"If your into history you will definitely love the place , history every where , nice place and nice garden , must stop by when visiting trabzon cause it’s important to get to know the history of trabzon"
14,nice ,"right on the top,looks very attractive,nice place to take pictures,just an hour is enough.well worth it."
15,Wonderfully sympathetically maintained historical building and gardens,Beautiful place to see would for sure come again Peaceful and interesting - you can just feel the history
16,A stunning and unique mansion with beautiful gardens and a sea view,Nice small palace of two floors with ability to see the furniture in each room. Beautiful garden for a walk. There are few restaurants outside the palace with nice view.
17,History is never boring ,"It’s a villa more than a palace , simple furniture. Great garden, the view from the terrace is breathtaking.The visit doesn’t take a lot of time to finish the whole place."
18,Nice place to visite,it is a nice lovely pavillion with nice views from the balconies. go there and see it. there are some interesting pieces that was once belonged to the founder of turkish republic.
19,Historical and Beatiful,"Very nice palace Beautiful garden , rooms nice design modern You need to pay when you go inside Nice staff and security"
20,Interesting building.,"Great location to see, a great  historical site, plenty of staff that speaks english, and will be happy to give you a tour of the building."
21,It was a nice destinations on top of the hill,Those are who has been in Dloma Behçe would not be impressedThe gardens around are amazing with beautiful scenery to the city below The house it self is small and crowded.
22,garden is so beutiful,Elegant building in nicely groomed garden with period furniture. Could get very crowded. Looked like it got public transportation. Poor service in the lovely garden cafe try the one across from the museum a little bit better but do not expect much.
23,Vacation,"Its also called the Ataturk House/Museum. A little difficult to get here - although yu can get a dolmus to take you very close and then walk up (when returning you can get a ticket at the museum itself and a bus comes along every 15-20 minutes).The Ataturk House holds a high position among the tourist attractions in Trabzon - it is the house of Ataturk (father of modern Turkey). Everything used by Ataturk has been maintained including the beds chairs, study table, crockery chandeliers. Photography is not allowed inside the house. Best to keep your voice low and not rush up stairs or make make noise inside. Outside, behind the House is a cute tea-shop under the trees - a great place to chill out. A small curio shop near the House sells fine and expensive souvenir made of Trabzon silver. Outside the House, there is a bigger restaurant and souvenir shop."
24,Nice residence ,We visited in May and unfortunately the actual villa was closed for renovations. However we were allowed to walk the beautiful gardens and see the building from the outside. It is located almost at the top of the mountain and you can see all of Trabzon from the gardens. Nearby is a gift shop and a beautiful silver jewelry shop. Worth the visit.
25,Small mansion on hills,I like this palace. Very nice and neat. Modern designed rooms and beautiful garden. The view from the terrace is very nice. We enjoyed touring the palace and we took nice photos there. We had to pay 5 Turkish lira per person. ( young children can enter for free.)
26,Nice to see,"Well worth a visit! Lovely gardens and the Pavilion of three floors is very interesting. Fitted with the original furniture and lots of pictures of Kemal Ataturk.Gives a great glimpse into a bit of history and gives some good views as well.One can reach there by bus - need a bus card - or get there by taxi. Getting a return ride is simpler by bus, but they do not take cash. Be sure to pre-arrange a taxi for your return. One can easily complete the tour within an hour and even less if there are crowds. We went early morning 09h30, but could be busier later. As the access is quite small, I suggest one avoids the crowds."
27,Overcrowded and falsely portrayed,Just an ordinary popular attraction in Trabzon. Building and arounds are nice. Much more ineresting  for locals or history lovers. You can take about an hour of your time for this place.
28,Very insteresting,It is very nice place for an hour or less visit.On the top of hills and nice garden. Ataturk were there only for a night!
29,Little Gem,"It is a very nice summer villa, that was preserved in a very good state.Don't look for some special furniture or architecture as the meaning of this place is rather historical.Here stayed the first President of the Republic of Turkey and that is why this place is so important to Turks.If you search for typical fancy turistic attractions it might not be as interesting for you."
30,Ataturk palace visit in Trabzon ,"Small palace comparing to what you can see in Istanbul but nice for short visit. My kids loved this visit especially there is small and nice garden and they loved to see how Ataturk palace look like and to old pictures, instruments and furniture. You can Plan to see this place on your way to other interesting places. Should not take time especially if you are Trabzon."
31,"Amazing palace, beautiful view","This is a beautiful property that offers a nice view of the black sea from the balcony; however, we visited on the weekend and found it to be way too crowded to enjoy the property.  The amount of people make it almost impossible to find any area to sit and take in the property in peace.  Overall it is worth a visit, but i would just be prepared for way too many people."
32,Relative Very Small place,The place is ok but not really stunning. There were so many tourists and so many bus tour full of people there. The house is normal not really big or luxury. We take van from trabzon for 2 lir and for return we did hitchhiking and came back to the city.if you r free its ok to go there and spend two hours time
33,Nice garden,Very good envirenment.There were a lot of historical things.The balcony was good for photographers.All around was like a forest.It was top of Trabzon.We arrived there at a very curly road along.But you must go there early in Sundays because alot of traffic.
34,Visit it,A beautiful house set in lovely gardens.An interesting place to visit.Nice tea garden to relax in and reasonably priced.
35,Small and Nice place,"Very interesting building from outside, but closed for renovations. Gardens are beautiful, but didn't feel it was worth the trip until renovations are completed.."
36,Weekend Breakaway,"A pretty building - a summer pavilion rather than a traditional house.  Taken from the original owner during the population exchange, I think, and later given to Ataturk.Attractive gardens.  Interior currently closed for renovations.  Worth visiting if you are nearby but not if you need to spend time getting there."
37,Nice,"very nice garden . you can see the house from inside , Ataturk bed room and some photos to him when you finish you can eat some thing in the coffee shop out side"
38,Unbelievable Palace,Building like many others. I just can't understand why this place is so crowdly visited . Maybe bacause in general in Trabzon there are not so many places worth seeing ?
39,Small and really wasn't interesting palace,Nice place with wonderful garden. The history behind it is great. There are many pictures inside the building which help to understand what happen there during time interval. Nearby this place has a great veiw of a village with unique architecture which worth to hike a bit to see...
40,The pavilion location- is the secret,"Spread over several floors are many artefacts and photos dedicated to Atatürk. Interesting to see one of his houses, well preserved."
41,Nice visit,It is amazing place to get in touch with history. Rooms are arranged with furniture and everything is labeled. Ground floor and first floor was open. But second floor was closed for renovation. Garden was amazing. There is an entrance fees.
42,Good example of early 20th century aristocratic Turkish house,Stunning building with a beautiful garden and amazing views. Very interesting to see the antique furniture in each room along with lots of images of Atatürk
43,Historical Palace ,"When We visited the place, it was first time free, there was a band playing music to celebrate the date of the opening of the first visit."
44,Must visit ,"The house and garden itself are pretty enough. What bothered me was the poor representation of history propagated there. Everything in the place is Ataturk this and Ataturk that, but the guy spent a sum total of three days in his life there. Meanwhile the Greek banker who built the place and lived there for three decades gets but one obscure mention on a side wall. If you enjoy false propaganda you might like this little stop."
45,must see,"This Villa was given to Ataturk as a summer residence, it’s a lovely home and gardens.Apparently he did not spend a great deal of time there but it’s worth checking out.  The gardens are well maintained as is the furnished Villa.There is a tea cafe near the garden and places to sit and enjoy the views.There is an entrance fee of 10TLHappy travels..."
46,Nice historical house,it is nice place to go you can injoy there nice pake the wether was very good i went there by the office of
47,"Interesting to visit (architecture, history and nice tea)","A summer pavilion with beautiful garden and great view from balcony, it's not big and luxurious for a great leader but everything in building so charming for me, rooms with nice design, antique furniture and more interesting."
48,I love it,White antique Palace . Rooms are like ataturk left them . The garden is very beautiful with imazing trees.Should be visited
49,Historical place,The garden is lovely. The furnushing was not as great as i thought it would be but its great that you can take photos inside the house! Our tour guide told us this is only a guest house that Ataturk stayed a few times while in the area.
50,Nice old home.,White mansion set in beautiful gardens with fountains and overlooking a pine forest. You can view most of the rooms which contain several antiques.
51,Insight into Turkish nationalism,This is well-worth the price of admission. The gardens are gorgeous. the villa is very well-maintaied. Who would not want to stay at such an impressive villa? This is a good example of how to preserve a historic site.
52,House of Mustafa Kemal ATATURK in Trabzon,"If you are an admirer of Ataturk like I am please do not miss this museum when you visit Trabzon. The setting is a bit on the outskirts of the city and the forested neighbourhood is a break from the busy city. The museum has wonderful Ataturk memorabilia and it is  kept in good condition. The garden surrounding the villa is lovely and you can enjoy a cup of tea under the trees. There is no minibusses (dolmus) goiing that way but southwest of Ataturk Square you can take a city bus marked ""Kosk"" and the bus actually stops right in front of the villa which is up a steep hill. The buses are regular and it it is easy to get one back to the city. At the museum kiosk you can buy a return ticket. Can get a bit crowded with school groups visiting but I can highly recommend a visit."
53,Beautiful ,"The location of the house is very impressive in the middle of the forest. However, we could not go inside due to the hordes of people."
54,Good to visit,Very high level house built almost a century ago. Located on a hill and in a very large garden. The sea view is amazing. I would expect a better preserved furnitures within the house.
55,Ok ,"I beleve Ataturk didn't use this villa to many times,it is beautiful,  with  stunning gardens! nice place to relax!"
56,Highly recommend a visit ,This palace is located in a luxurious neighborhood on the top of the pine forest Nice home and Garden It's well maintained and properly taken care of
57,Ataturk kusku,"If you interested in Ataturk, you can visit there. Garden and Kosk were so amazing and I visited all rooms of this Kosk. History of rooms and decoration were so natural."
58,Interesting Place to Go,His house shows how simply this great leader of the Turkish people lived. A few beautiful pieces of furniture set in a house with numerous windows and views.
59,A selfie picture,"I have been there with my family .it have a Nice garden with a great view of Trabzon city.The house is small . If you have free time ,visit it."
60,Visiting Ataturks Mansion,High on the city's highest point lies the house that Attatuck once lived in. It has a beautiful garden and excellent views of the city.
61,just an ordinary big house,3 hours is enough you can try the tea and the sitting area also walking around the palace is a good idea but be carful of the crowd
62,The Kiosk which Atatürk testament his last will to his properties ,"Well maintained house with memorable moments of Ataturk's life. The photo collection is impressive. The room, where Ataturk's last will was written is very emotional."
63,Not a must-see ,Kosk is really build perfect place..its in the woods and on the sea...view is amazing..and they keep all furnitures and staff from that old times..Ataturk s bed..table..kitchenstuff..etc..when you r in the Kosk you feel.it..its huge national feelings...
64,Palace above the top of a mountain,"If you are an Ataturk fan, definitely come and see this place, which is festooned with myriad photos of the great man, as well as a war map annotated by him personally.For those with a more passing interest, the visit is still worthwhile to see the wedding-cake architecture of this summer house, built before WW1, and gifted to Ataturk by the city after he stayed there a couple of times.It is situated up a steel hill from Trabzon, and the extra altitude means the place is significantly cooler and less humid than the city below. This alone will make visitors want to linger over tea in the pleasant tea garden on the grounds of the house."
65,Memories From Ataturk,"Nice place and a glimpse into the history of Trabzon. Beautiful scenery all the way up to the ""White House"""
66,With family,It was interesting to the decoration and furnishings of the time. The building and gardens are well maintained. It's well worth visiting.
67,History spot,"If you have liked the building in which Trabzon museum is housed, don't miss to visit the Ataturk Kosku! Not that much for the exhibits (unless you are an Ataturk fan), but for the chance to admire another example of well preserved early 20th century Black Sea villa located in a well maintained garden about 6,5 km south of the city center.In order to reach it, take the Cumhuriet street (the one where Demirgrand hotel is located) going down the hill in the direction of the sea, cross the busy coastal road using a pedestran only bridge, buy the bus tickets at the newspaper / snacks stall you'll see as soon as you've descended from the bridge (don't forget to buy the return tickets, too) and find the bus marked ""Park - Kosk"" on the big local bus terminal just beside.Once in the villa, don't forget to check the period kitchen and bathroom as well. Enjoy a tea in the garden of the villa or in a tea garden just across the street (there you'll also find a big shop selling very tastefully made jewellery with semi precious stones)."
68,Ataturk palace,"The villa is located on top of a hill, the drive up is a curvy one way road.Both the building and the gardening is beautiful. The interior is well-preserved. You can visit all three floors and step on the balcony to enjoy the view over the decorative garden and the woods behind the residence. The rooms are simple, but chic in design, there are a few signs with quotes from Atatürk and on the top floor there is a collection of original photographs that aren't known widely. Atatürk has signed his testament here, leaving his entire estate to the Turkish public.However, I missed some contextualising. A few more signs would've helped to explain why he chose this building when he stayed in Trabzon, when and by whom the villa was built, when it was converted to a museum etc.Still, it's a lovely place to step into the past."
69,Amazing,Outlet available price reasnobleChoices r available if u need branded items or ordenary itemsResturant very good
70,Adding meaning to Trabzon.,This place is so dreamy and relaxing.  Like palaces in a story...This place is so dreamy and relaxing. In a story like palacesAtaturk's personality is important but the building itself was simple and it was interesting to me...I recommend it to travelers
71,Excellent ,Interesting to see this house even if Ataturk only stayed here on 2 occasions.The place is a few km. South of towncenter.Easiest to go by taxi all the way up high and have it wait or buy returntickets for the bus when you pay the entrance ticket.The building must have been luxoriuos when it was built s a summer residence back in 1890.Unfortunately there is no panoramic view although it is quite high up - due to vegetation etc.
72,Quiet and dream place,"The villa is nice, around 15-20 minutes from the center of Trabzon; however, if you are short of time, don't give it a try, small simple nice villa from the 20th century, I recommend spending your time in Sera Golu lake which is also 15 minutes from Trabzon  or drive for 2 hours and visit the alpine village of Ayder."
73,Gorgeous!,its not a must-see place. but if you are in trabzon you must do. because there are not so many places in there to see. anyway it has great view of blacksea and beautiful garden. in my opinion i liked there because of Atatürk.
74,Historical beauty and art,A fascinating piece of the city's history. The architecture of the building and its contents are great to see and it is all set within a lovely garden with great views over the city. If in Trabzon you need to go.
75,Nice Villa with rather historical importance,"Small Palace at magical place, surrounding with beautiful garden with central fountain, the palace belongs to Ataturk Pavilion, Modern designed, has many historical photo for Ataturk Don't miss !"
76,Ordinary popular attraction,"This is a wonderful place to learn a little, or a lot, about the history and politics of Turkey, although you will need a guide or a local to tell you about it. The place is kept as it was around a century ago, with all the pieces of furniture. Atatürk slept in there when he visited the city and then it was donated to him by its citizens, to revert to the ownership of Trabzon after his death.The gardens are awesome and they were full of tulips in bloom when we visited. Take your time to wonder around and explore every corner, from front to back. The view from the balcony is also really worth it."
77,Nice building,"It's easy to get there by public transport. We took a mini-bus under the bridge near the maydan/tourist office in direction to the ""Atatürk Köşkü"".We visited the house because it was raining and we wanted to to something inside. Unfortunately there was no information in English at all. The house is nice to see, but we didn't spend a long time (about 1h)."
78,TRABZON,The house was interesting but we struggled to find a place to park had to wait to get in and the house was so busy it was hard to walk around and see the rooms.Nice cafe opposite and a shop that specialises in silver jewellery.
79,"Nice palce, but it's nothing compared to Istanbul's Topkapi Palace, Sultan Ahmed Mosque",The Ataturk pavilion is a lovely former Greek banker's summer house that is a museum of Ataturk's time in the house.  The grounds are lovely and events and weddings are held on the grounds.
80,Interesting Building,"Attaturk has many places of residence around Turkey, but this one is well maintained and compact, if you can spare the time not to be missed."
81,Nice but not good,"This mansion is on the top of Trabzon, I would say. It is a medium-size white palace among the trees. One of the must-see places in Trabzon. There are also benches and tables/chairs in the yard to take a break, have some tea/coffee or ice-cream and enjoy the nature."
82,A beautiful home with a great view of the city,Palace on top of a mountain and when you climb to the top of the mountain you see this palace Alraih wonderful garden and can be in and watch the palace from the inside
83,A beautiful setting in the hills above Trabzon,"there is a big and nice garden. pavillion is nice with landscape. Ataturk's everyday life is in it. Architecturally, it's also about a period of modern architecture. It looks like the style of expressionism."
84,Feel the history,The villa and gardens are beautifully kept but although Mustafa Kemal Ataturk might have lived there it is difficult to keep my concentration on seeing a chair he sat in or a desk he used to write on. It is interesting to see but not riveting.
85,good,"I managed to visit this mansion using only public transport - I took a dolmus up the hill and a public bus on the way down, although you need a transport card to pay for this. The mansion is stunning, especially in the sunshine, and I was lucky enough to see it in spring when the tulips were open."
86,good for taking pictures,"I like this palace it can give you an idea about how was the life of Atatürk, and also it’s a serene place"
87,A great and important Turkish leader's very pleasant house and gardens,I enjoyed being there with my family seeing the area and reading the written information being based every where
88,Very Nice Palace ,"We had been on the dry side of the mountains most of our time in Turkey. Although beautiful, we really enjoyed the contrast of seeing the gardens in the moist Black Sea environment. It was interesting to see more of what Ataturk did when he was in Trabzon, and to see the rooms in the beautiful villa."
89,Ataturk's house in Trabzon,"Previous a large private summer residence outside Trabzon city center. Built by a greek (greek-russian ?) businessman.Not big as a museum but a a place in honour of Ataturk.Worth a visit, although the place is high up there is not a panoramic view.Taxi up easiest.Bus down if taxi is not waiting (Busticket at the entrance booth)."
90,Well Worth the Effort,"Lovely white house, very elegantly decorated and beautifully maintained. It was Ataturk's home when he'd visit Trabzon. It's just a short drive from the city center and views from up there are fantastic!"
91,A must to see.,"It's a classical designed triplex home completed with a large gorgerous garden.When Atatürk came Trabzon,he stayed here and liked it very much.And then Trabzon folk decided to buy it and gift to him.I love Atatürk,I loved visiting there.Besides it's history,it is an amazing house.So neat and chic...And with a wonderful garden."
92,nice architecture,"The house was open when we visited in September, 2014. Ataturk actually only spent a few days here on a visit to Trabzon. A beautifully preserved late 19th century house on the outside and inside."
93,nice view from the balconies!,"It was a good decision to go and see this kiosk however the way to go there was really difficult. It took us about 20 minutes or more to go there from the air port. The place is very good, you will hope that you have a similar house for yourself far from city noise. The kiosk is 3 floors, and was used by Ataturk for only few days as I remember. It was a gift from Trabzon people, a gift which was alomst never used!!"
94,Long trip to reach there!!,The entrance garden was great but because of tall trees there is not see view. The building was simple but good design.
95,The Father of modern Turkey,It's a small house for Ataturk on top of Trabzon mountain several rooms and nice garden with cafe looking to the part of the city
96,one of the historic places in Trabzon,Although the pavement is very beautiful but the palace wasn't that much interesting  such as to ottomans  historical palaces but if you like to know new Turkish history it will be nice to visit it
97,A white marvel!,"Summer house of ATATÜRK despite short time. He loved this pavillion after previous Greek owner. You feel peaceful and cool spirit of the last owner. ATATÜRK gifted this hous to Turkish citizens as museum. Triplex white house has classical features of Mediterranean big summer house despite location of black sea. Garden is beatiful consists of magnolia, hortense, etc. big piano at entrance, balconies has great landscape"
98,Nothing special,"Visit this stunningly beautiful home high in the hills above Trabzon.  We took public transport up and back, and spent a couple of hours just sipping tea after our tour of the house."
99,Ataturk Kiosk or Ataturk's villa ? Listed by Tripadvisor under both names !,"in the hart of Trabzon nature attraction, It nice to see the palace and the old furniture which shows Turkish art and culture, I visited the place early morning there is nice garden around to I enjoyed 30 minutes walk and I had good coup of coffee under the shade of trees."
100,A greek businessman's summer residence turned into Ataturk Pavilion (Kiosku),"I was expecting something a bit grander, but unless you're a big architecture or Ataturk fan, it's pretty much just a dusty old house. The Trabzon Museum house is much more interesting, beautiful, in the city center and Ataturk stayed there too. I would pass this one up and go to Trabzon Museum instead."
101,Over rated,"Impressive rose garden at entrance. A very well respected man, Ataturk is responsible for a Constitution granting the Turkish people many freedoms. His house is pleasant and not ostentatious. Several beautiful pieces of furniture."
102,Mountain Mansion,"In reality another beautiful ex-Greek owned, like every house from the old Trabzon. Built  around 1900 and served the Theofylaktos family till 1917. After that with the organised excile and genocide plan from the New Turcs it was confiscated. Mustafa Kemal just stayed there for some days and within the plan of renaming greek and armenian buildings and streets, in order to be forgotten from history, the mansion was called by the official state and some Turcs as Ataturk's house. Like the well known Museum of Trabzon-The Kostaki Mansion in the center... !"
103,Worth a visit,"This is a villa about 10minutes by taxi outside the city , which Ataturk lived in for a period. It is furnished in 1930s style and well maintained. There is a small coffee shop in the garden."
104,Worthwhile,"During our preparation to visit Trabzon- Ataturk Pavilion was among the hot spots. We decided to include this attraction in our short list. Reaching the site by public transportation was easy. Many other visitors choose to rent a car, some with a driver. The public transportation driver charges little extra as this Pavilion is located remotely. The nice building is dated back to year 1890. It was little rainy and heavily cloudy.  In general  the temperature in mid-October was nice. The Pavilion location and architecture style were exceptional. The garden was well organized. The fees I would say were exaggerated for such attraction."
105,Ataturk Kiosk,"This place is in up of Trabzon mountain. The path had Steep slope. You should pay 15Lira for one person for enter to place.  Relative to other similar place it is not great, But had good view as trabzon."
106,Beautifully preserved villa,"Although Mustafa Atatürk only stayed here once Or twice in his life, it certainly is worth the visit, just because the house is an eyecatcher. Don’t forget to check out the garden as well"
107,Nice building from Outside,"Ataturk has stayed once for 3 days in this place,there are different rooms labeled as meeting room, library, ...The palace has a beautiful garden with different color tulips . Nice place but not a must go."
108,Pretty exterior; interior closed.,"Atatürk was lived in the villa for a while. His study room, his chamber, kitchen... They all well preserved.The villa is like frozen moment of history and Atatürk's life.  If you are in Trabzon do not skip this place."
109,Lovely gardens and great view,"Located in the top of a hill looking over Trabzon city ,it is and old historical home with very nice gardens all around it."
110,Pretty historial mansion,Dolmus from opposite Garanti Bankasi and in front of ING is TL 3.5 to Kusk. Remember to stay on bus to top of hill where the Vila is situated. Good exterior. Not much inside and what could be a spectacular view of the coastline is obscured by conifers. Easy bus ride back to the centre from outside the gates.
111,Lovely,Best attraction of trabzon . tihs villa locate on a hill that 10 minute far from city center with your car
112,A beautiful house.,"The kiosk is a must-see place in Trabzon. It is maybe smaller than nowadays kiosks, moreover it has really historic background."
113,nice place,"Build by the wealthy greek banker Karayannidis as his house and served him and his family till the 1917. After that with the new Turcs movement it was confiscated (nationalised) and Mustafa Kemal stayed there for some days (around two days). Very nice exterior and garden. Very interesting for people who like ""tinny"" beuty and relaxed atmosphere."
114,Ataturk-Karayannidis Mansion,"You can reach here by Dolmush from the avenue beside Meydan (3.5 TL , July 2017, one way).It is good to visit. You can take good photos there."
115,Constantine Theofylaktos Mansion-A Greek Banker,"Atatürk himself spent only a little time here.  It was originally built by a wealthy banker and given to Atatürk.  Still , there are some very good vintage photos of Atatürk's life, and some lovely gardens."
116,A bit disappointed,a nice historical kiosk when atatürk came to visit to trabzon residents of trabzon give the kiosk to atatürk as a gift.
117,Villa of The Founder of Modern Turkey,"I was stuck in Trabzon for a couple days in January because my flight to Istanbul was redirected there due to the snow storm that was battering Istanbul's airport. Deciding to make the most of the fact that we could not continue our journey back to Uzbekistan, I with my mum and another passenger decided to visit some places in Trabzon. This was one of the few we visited and while I wouldn't say it was extremely exciting, there wasn't anything that made me say wow, it was quite a nice house, with old carpets, and tiles."
118,Amazing gardens and fabulous views.,"We decided to go to the Ataturk Kosku after having visited the Sumela Monastery because it was only around mid-afternoon. There was no queue and tickets were not too expensive. The house offers an interesting insight into a small part of Ataturk's life, and the beautiful gardens are peaceful to sit in and relax. The view is also great with the black sea in the distance."
119,Well maintained museum,"A truly challenging place to get to...... take A Taxi!!!!!!!!!!  But well worth the effort. A lovely spot in a beautiful forest setting. The house and gardens are quite interesting.... a great look at Trabzon life in the early 20th century. In spite of the Ataturk connection, the house is quite charming, well appointed and woth a visit for the interior and architecture alone. Lovely tea garden ovverlooking the Sea, great restaurant and shop next door. Just dont waste your time waiting for a bus or dolmush, grab a cab for $20 TL and check it out.   Great pictures on balcony."
120,Waste of time,"While Ataturk only stayed here a handful of nights, this villa was bequeathed to Ataturk.In its day, the 3 storey house must have been quite spectacular, and there would have been flight deck views.  However, the majority of the would be view is now blocked by massive conifers, and while the exterior of the house is kept in good condition the inside of the house needs a lot of work to bring it up to its former glory.The walls of the house are full of photos of Ataturk during his reign.There were two wedding parties there while we visited the property - no doubt photos with the gardens and house as backdrops would be very nice.Across the road from this attraction is a jewellery store/café (and toilets)"
121,history and seanery,This house is where Ataturk stayed when came to Trabzon. It's been used as an Ataturk museum. Very interesting old buildings displaying furniture and other stuff he used while  staying in it. It will give you some Trabzon and Ataturk history as well as old time architecture.
122,Definitely reccommended,Ataturk was the one of the greatest commander and leader in the world. And you can see and feel some memories from Ataturk in this house.
123,Elegant Villa,"Ataturk`s maansion in on the road to Soguksu from the old city and take about 20 minutesdriving by car or taxi from Trabzon Airport. This mansion was actually consturcted at late 19th century for a whealty greek family. After the independence war all greek minorities were deported to Greece and mansion was left unused for some time and later in early 1930 was bought by local municipality and offerede as a gift to founder of Tuurkey, Mr. Keal Ataturk as a residance place while his visits to Trabzon. The mension is on a hill overlooking to Black Sea and well kept and remediated by local grater municipality. The mansion do not offers parking place so it could be sort of difficult to find a place around and the last time I visited, I had to park half a km away. An neterence fee of 5Tl, aboyt 1.3EURs should be paid it is better to have some local currenncy ready for the tickets."
124,A Charming Villa,"We took a local minibus up to Ataturk Kosku (3.5TL one way).  The house is very well preserved as it would have been when used as a summer house. Yo do get the feeling of how historic this house is by the number of locals visiting.There are a number of artefacts and furniture which are very in keeping with the period. The views from the house and gardens over looking the city to the sea are very good.Only cost 8.5TL for an entrance ticket.In summary, an excellent place to visit to embrace a slice of history, well worth the effort. Recommended."
125,V.nice place,"The pavillon used to be the house of an Ottoman Rum Konstantin Kapagianidis, who made every effort to built this impressive palace. I liked especially the gardens and the view from first floor balcony"
126,Another perfect sample for Trabzon's civic architecture,"Attaturk was spending his time in this palace while visiting Trabzon.The architecture of tha palace is so unique, the garden of the palace is beautiful and clean including fountain in the middle. the palace is located on high hil' so you can arrive there by local taxi (dolmish) , and of course the view wich you can see from above is a beautiful."
127,Worth a visit,"The place, a gift to Ataturk from people of Trabzon and they back from Ataturk to Turkish people, is the house of Greek, left the country in 1920s. It represents interesting architectural style and has a interesting furniture and other things inside to learn the living in the beginning of the XX th century.  Garden has many great flowers and very peaceful tea cafe. Outside the Kosku, across the street you can buy Turkish famous silver products and other souvenirs, although I preferred to do it in small shops of the city center of Trabzon. If you are in town, it is one of the must-see attraction to feel the spirit of Ataturk legacy."
128,"built by a Greek banker, ,to be liked by everybody",Well preserved and renovated place of founder of Turkish Republic Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Turkish people grateful to Atatürk for every sacrifice he and his colleagues have made during establishing of this powerful state.
129,Beautiful gardens and an interesting house,"If you're really not big fan of Ataturk, don't waste your time going there. Nothing so special about it except how the house looks like from outside."
130,historical place,"High above Trabzon in the district of Soğuksu, Atatürk Pavilion was built by a Greek citizen of the Ottoman Empire in 1890. It is a splendid building in a well kept park. Often you can watch newly weds being photographed there, or young boys together with their families after sünnet (circumcision).Atatürk stayed there in 1924 and was presented with the Pavilion as a gift in the 1930s. He did not return there often. It is here that Atatürk held a speech in which he donated all his property to his fellow citizens. I was told that that is also one of the reasons why the Turks love him so much. He did not want to own anything. You can find various texts about that speech on internet. The interior of the house is in any case worth a visit if you are interested in Turkish history and politics. It shows how Mustafa Kemal‘s „normal life“ was in Trabzon. Most impressive were the countless photos and, of course, the bedspread: an enormous Turkish flag laid across the bed of the Father of the Nation. A solemn, yet very serene place on the whole, I would say."
131,A pleasant place to have a cup of tea,"The founder of modern Turkey, Kemal Atatürk stayed here during his visit to the city of Trabzon. All furniture have been kept as they were once used along with personal items. Must visit it to understand his mentality better, as you will see a saying by this great man that really will struck you."
