0,Such a disappointment after Hiroshima,"The scale model of the Bomb, time-lapse of the Explosion (ghoulish or what), the Display about the History of Nuclear Bomb Development, its Testing and their proliferation around the World since - they were good.The rest, I regret to say, was a big disappointment, as was the crowds inside (over-exited & out-of-control School Children, all in immaculate School Uniform comprising the majority). I have to stress, this was an exception - only time on 7 weeks.Being incredibly rushed, on a -round day Trip from Fukuoka, due to an error in Tour Planning, did not help, but this Museum compared very poorly with Hiroshima."
1,Destruction and Rebirth,"You can learn about the background to the bombing, see a model of the bomb, and see the bomb's effects on various objects.  There are also exhibits on its legacy, including interviews with survivors.  I was surprised to learn that Allied POWs were among the victims.  The exhibits are well presented."
2,Reminder of the horrors of nuclear war,"Factual and to the point, shows the true horror and total destruction that an atomic bomb produces. If you have not been to this or Hiroshima you should feel duty bound to visit if in the area."
3,A history everyone should remember,"Great learning experience with detailed explanation on effects of atomic bomb, and the importance of not using such a dangerous weapon. A must visit."
4,Impactful memory to the horrific consequences of the Nagasaki bombing,"The museum definitely is a highlight. Precise information is given what the detonation of a atomic bomb means for the buildings, fauna and flora that is hit by the blast. Also, consequences of radiation exposure are depicted and explained accurately. The detonation of an atomic bomb is a tragedy that must never happen again. Despite this, I would like to  congratulate the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum for their great work in collecting, preserving and displaying information about it."
5,A Must Visit as a Reminder.,"The photos, the victims accounts, then where we stand today in terms of the threat of nuclear warfare.Heart wrenching, eye opening and scary"
6,"A Sobering Visit, but an Important One","Comprehensive presentation of the atomic bombing and it's aftermath with multimedia and static exhibits. Quite graphic in a couple of places but not gratuitously so, merely factual. Stands as a memorial and hopefully a deterrent."
7,Harrowing but I still visited twice,"Excellent job educating the public about the horrors of war. It explained the history behind the bombing and its tremendous heat that killed people and decimated objects. Their attempt to put into perspective when 80% of the city had collapsed and burned with strewn corpses was achieved visually with photographs, objects, personal effects left by the deceased and stories from the survivors. The vast destruction can be felt. Their pain and cry for world peace is a message you will take home from here."
8,emotional,"Thought provoking ,Historic museum ,to advise what the horrors of war can bring ,very solemn and disheartening feelings looking at some of the artefacts/photos/and descriptions from that horrifying moment in history , its worth taking your time to take in the meaning of all this ,in a very quiet and peaceful atmosphere . There is a park and memorial pond close by that is also worth a walk around ."
9,Well organized and informative museum,"Visited with colleagues in October.  What  an overwhelming exoerience. Seeing all the death and destruction created by the bomb in just few seconds. , the after effects felt by people to this day..... It makes you chill to your bones. Spending few hours in the museum is highly recommended and also that you read the plaques , description on exhibits and the video clips."
10,Informative Museum,"Really interesting, very well presented, this is the story of the awful day in August 1945 when the atomic. Bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. In general,the detail is clearly presented (it’s a pity that one wall is presented in Japanese, without translation), and one can see the twisted metal and artifacts remaining from the explosion. To anyone visiting this site it must be blindingly obvious that this must never, ever happen again, no matter what the provocation."
11,Sad but it happened on 9Aug1945,"We take all our visitors here.  Tells the story leading up to the blast, with an ominously ticking clock.  Tells the story after the blast, or course from the Japanese perspective.  They think the war would have ended anyway within a few months.  Not mentioned is the possibility that there might have been a land war in Japan.  Expect to have strong feelings.  A great museum."
12,Educational ,"Very well designed museum. Moving without too much gory details.Helps put in perspective the bombing, its rational and the effects on Nagasaki"
13,Entrance is 200 yen per person,An impressive display of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and the very sad consequences. All the gruesome details tell the same story: never again...
14,Reflective,"The museum presents the run-up, day of and aftermath of the dropping of the atomic bomb on the city in a well organised, sensitive and thoughtful manner. This is a must see site when visiting the city."
15,Heartbreaking but Important,"It is when you see the pieces of the broken city, the photos of the bomb's aftermath, and read the eye witness accounts that you realise how devastated this city was. The museum has a place for resting and a small cafe for those who need to sit a review what they have seen."
16,Immersing in Japan,"This museum deals in rather a disjointed way with the terrible after affects of the atomic bombing and uses this to rightly promote the disarmament and removal of all A bombs world-wide. It also uses this to promote Nagasaki as the victim and fails completely to deal with Japan’s hostile involvement in the Pacific rim from the 1930’s, with Pearl Harbour and their refusal to surrender in 1945.  I think the Japanese youth of today should be told this story and be able to refute what our local guide told us that the US had the A bomb and wanted to try it out somewhere to see what happened.  Regardless of my comment, I still feel that this is really worth visiting as we cannot have Nagasaki again and everyone should learn about it."
17,Scary!,"A very well thought out exhibition, combining a sense of the horror with a balanced view of background to the bombing. Its not a big museum but worth the tram trip. A short detour to see the One Legged Torri at Sanno Shrine is worth it. JR pass holders desparate to save the tram fare can use Urakami Station."
18,Educational,"This was a very interesting and sobering exhibition on the dropping of the Atomic Bomb with many gruesome photos. It was laid out in a factual way with real artifacts from the time. I learned much about the event that i didn`t previously know.  However I didn`t see any information which explained the events that happened in the years prior the the decision to drop the bomb.It is good to hear that Japanese children are learning about tolerance and living in peace, and they are encouraging this to be a worldwide initiative. Lets hope we all can benefit from this teaching in the future."
19,Humbling experience,Very interesting place to visit. A sad reminder of the tragedy of the atomic bomb. A nice gift shop too
20,Must-See for Every Nagasaki Visitor,A fantastic insight to the devastation caused by this bomb. Very emotional. Very well done. A must visit when in Nagasaki.
21,Sombre History,"Is a great museum reminding mankind of the horror and distruction power of Atomic Bomb, this is happening in 1949,70 year ago, how much advanced technology now and the distruction power we have now hope that we will never another horrific even again"
22,Ineffably sad history of the after-effects of the second use of the Bomb,We visited the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum after we visited Saint Mary’s Cathedral and Hypocenter Park. The museum had a plethora of information about the aftermath of the atomic bomb.
23,A step back in time,"For those who would like to know, see and even feel the affects of the atomic bomb being dropped onto Nagasaki, I would recommend to check this place out! (also a good spot if it's raining outside)Comparing this to the one in Hiroshima, that one is more comprehensive, whilst this one seemed more personal, with first handed descriptions and items for you to touch.  Less crowded here, too, comparing it to Hiroshima's museum."
24,Downplays Japan's role in WW2 too much,"The WWII and the atom bomb history, facts and untold stories are life images when seeing the photos, documentaries and illustrations in the small museum. A must visit attraction in Nagasaki."
25,BETTER PRESENTATION THAN HIROSHIMA,"It's one thing to know about the A bomb, it's another to see photographic evidence of the destruction they caused. Parts of the museum were confronting and other were heart breaking but it was very informative and well set out. If you go in a supporter of nuclear weapons and don't come out with a changed opinion you didn't pay enough attention"
26,Brutal truth,This is the real record of the result if using nuclear weapin. As many people as possible have to see and realize its risk.
27,Educational visit,"This museum covers both the human ad physical toll of the atomic bomb. Although it is small, it is packed with information. The stories are moving, really is a must see."
28,Educational visit,"Sobering , well done. Flows well. Doesn't glamorize any aspect of war and the presentation was politically neutral as could be done."
29,Very well done museum ,"Deeply moving experience. If you have any doubts about the futility of war, weapons of mass destruction, nuclear bombs in particular, visit this site and they will be dispelled immediately. It is not an overly large museum and it is laid out so you follow the narrative of the war, events leading to the dropping of the bomb and of course the terrible, terrifying aftermath. Several exhibits make for grim viewing and display the destructive force of a nuclear blast. However, the testimonies from survivors and observers make the event all to real more than 70 years later. All were sad and one in particular at the very end of the display left  me crushed.That Nagasaki has risen from that terrible day, to be the beautiful city it is now, is nothing short of amazing."
30,Historical memorial,Fascinating exhibits and very impartial. It was done in such a way that the horror of nuclear war didn’t feel gory to read about but factual and respectful. Loved all the colourful paper cranes. A must do when in Nagasaki.
31,Moving and poignant,"This was the moving, informative site we were hoping for to better understand the impact of the Atomic Bomb on  Nagasaki. The displays and explanations (almost all with English as well) offered that. It was, of course, sad and moving. At the end, there was a display of the history of atomic bombs and the current state of atomic bombs worldwide. I was especially surprised by the thousands and thousands of origami cranes around this museum--many seemed to have been sent by Japanese students. (These can be viewed in the lobby areas and you don't even have to pay to see them.)"
32,Unbelievable,"The Atomic Bomb Museum captures the pain and inhumanity of atomic weapons. It is skilfully designed to lead you through the various parts of the exhibition giving you a sense of the horrors that unfolded on that day. Time stood still at 11:02....The twisted metal.... the replica it the ‘Fat Boy’.... the charred personal belongings of young and old.If you travel to Nagasaki then this museum, the Peace Park and the Hall of Remembrance must be close to or at the top of your list to see.I visited the Atomic Museum in Hiroshima but, in my opinion this one here in Nagasaki is excellent."
33,When in Nagasaki,"Good museum that portrays the horrors of these gruefull events. If you’re in Japan, definitely give it a visit, it will give you a new insight to what you have been taught in school. No doubt a good and important reminder of and insight in the victims horrible experiences."
34,"Good, but chilly inside","An unbelievable exhibition showing the horrors of war and the devastation of an atomic bomb which killed over 70,000 innocent people, with more dying from the effects of radiation many years later.  There will never be agreement on whether this action should be taken, however, together with the bomb dropped in Hiroshima it led to the end of WW11.  Hard to comprehend the actions of the Japanese during this war and their devotion to their Emperor, when compared with the friendliness and courtesy of the Japanese of today."
35,A good place to visit,It was informational and educational about the atomic bomb and how the powers that be decided to select the cities to bomb.
36,Emotional unique experience ,This is a place to be reminded about the brutal facts about the realities of nuclear warfare. The museum is haunting and disturbing in its use of images that conjure up a day that will hopefully mark the last time such a weapon is used on human beings. There were people under that mushroom cloud.
37,Fntastic in it's scope,A time machine to bring visitors back to the day of the horrific destructions. The displays are very presented with actual remains portraying the immense and merciless power of the atomic bomb.
38,Poignant but...,We went to both (Hiroshima and Nagasaki) A-bomb museums but found this one more impressive. Many personal stories and information on the aftermath of the bomb. A real size replica of the bomb is present.
39,A museum presented professionally.,"Explanations available in English, with various artefacts and photos to illustrate the impact of the bomb on Nagasaki and its citizens. Great learning experience."
40,A Somber Reflection On Atomic Warfare,A must see for all of us. The adjacent peace building is also very moving. For the gas bags complaining about schoolchildren in the way-well perhaps you weren't so fortunate to be taken on field trips as a child but despite their laughter and noise I am sure they absorbed good information. Next time do what I did and go on Sunday-no school groups but yes some families-mostly Japanese. The balanced presentation about the causes of the war is particularly impressive. Very glad I came to charming Nagasaki and this world class museum and park.
41,Complete overview,We are a family of four that recently visited the Atomic bomb museum. Having to read or listen to the English and Korean versions of the displays take quite a bit of time and our 4 and 5 year olds lacked the patience to get through the entire museum without becoming antsy. The hands on displays were entertaining for the moment but I suggest that you bring something else to occupy children if you really want to see everything the museum has to offer. The museum is very quiet and may be difficult for little ones to understand why that is so. The detail and care that the museum took to put all of the displays together is well worth the money and helps to better understand the events that took place in history.
42,Breath taking,"A must visit when in Nagasaki. Good explanations, visual displays and artifacts on display which memorize the horrific impacts of the Nagasaki nuclear bombing. Missing, understandably from a Nagasaki perspective, is the role of Japan in WWII."
43,Educational and emotional ,"You cannot say it was a great visit, atomic bombs should not be allowed. However it accurately depicts the horror of and following 9 August 1945."
44,A must visit for everyone to learn from our past,"A well appointed museum with various artifacts, film clips and photos dedicated to the atomic bomb, that was dropped on Nagaskai and the start of the nuclear age. There is a lot to be gained from this museum. The museum is across the street from the street car stop and adjacent to the Peace Memorial."
45,It was just alright,My wife and I recently visited to well designed memorial museum that described the dropping of the atomic bomb on this city.  Authentic photographs and recovered artifacts made the experience even more vivid.  An absolute must see in Nagasaki!
46,Remember...,The museum achieves a good balance of factual as well as personal information about the impact of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. The exhibits are easy to follow and the museum is well laid out and accessible to all. A very important place to visit in Nagasaki.
47,Lest we forget,"Great records of the history through pictures, artefacts and videos of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki.  It is not a museum that tells just the history but many what happens to the people after that.... many of the pictures and letters from the people can be very heart wrenching.... I did not understand the paper cranes till i finished the tour.  From the many residents in nagasaki that have experienced atomic bombing, they are praying for world peace. A must visit place in Nagasaki and Fukuoka!"
48,Small and informative,"The museum is incredibly informative and educational. Pictures show all the devastation made by an atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on the day of 9th August 1945.  Nuclear fission was created by the explosives imploding on the core of ‘plutonium’.Facts of the atomic bomb: Length 3.25m, diameter 1.52m, weight 4.5tons. Explosive  force: Equal to 21-ktons of TNT. Nick name: Fat Man (because of the look of its shape).According to the information, it was targetted at Kokura- an industrial area in the northern coast of Kyushu initially, but due to clouds and poor visibility, the US Bomber B29 that loaded with Fat Man then changed its course to the next target- Nagasaki, when they sighted Mitsubishi Nagasaki Arm Factory.Plutonium: the chemical element that used as a fuel in the nuclear reactors, and as an explosive in nuclear fission weapons."
49,Nice record of history,"Not as informative as Hiroshima's atomic museum. But since it is a history that every human being should not forget, still worth a visit. The museum is on the hill. Take taxi if you go with elderly."
50,Good exhibits and history,Museum was very interesting to the adults and kids. Very apt reminder on the devastation a war can have on ordinary folks.
51,Nagasaki Atomic Museum ,Definitely worth a visit. Can't help but feeling the sadness and tragedy surrounding the bombing. Details of the event are thoroughly explained and the videos shown around the museum are very informative.
52,"My fourth or fifth trip here over the years,...","to see the artifacts and how the people came together to help in such devastation. to see shadows in concrete of human remains. and the burnt bodies. was in hiroshima the year before and the affects on those lives as well. a strong christian faith is evident in nagasaki, that i believe helped the people overcome such a tragedy. gives me a new perspective as i hope it does in the world. never again another nagasaki or hiroshima."
53,Heartfelt ,"I heard that the Hiroshima memorial is ""bigger, better"", etc."", but you cannot quantify something like that by size. I would recommend one see first the historic shipbuilding musesum from Mitsubishi Heavy industries, because it contextualizes this disastrous event. I think you cannot praise the tecnology that makes weapons without considering that at the base of war is only greed and stupidity. The museum might be smaller, compared to Hiroshima, but the grief you feel is the same."
54,Easy way to understand the atrocities of the atomic bomb,A great place to visit to learn on the atrocity of war and also the destruction of atomic bomb.  The exhibits are well narrated and there are videos and interactive displays for better engagementDo visit the Peace Park and the Nagasaki Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims as well
55,A must do,The events of leading to and the effects of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki are recorded in this museum. A must visit to Nagasaki. Parking is JPY100 for first hour and JPY50 every 30min thereafter.
56,Definitely visit with a strong heart,"The Museum does not convey the intensity of the shock and trauma from the bomb explosion to visitors as powerfully as its counterpart in Hiroshima, but a visit to Nagasaki would not be complete without visiting this Museum which reminded the world of one of the greatest human sacrifices in history."
57,Peace,"This area is the location of where the atomic bomb hypercenter exploded over the city. It's very educational, heartfelt, and exceptionally sad. It's interesting to see the various types of foreigners that visit this area. Please take note of the water bottles, and find out their significance. Water plays a large role in this area. I'm mostly refering to the outdoor parts of the museum, not inside."
58,Most important stop in Nagasaki,"Must do place to visit. This is a place for quiet reflection. The exhibition covers the period before the bomb, the destruction of Nagasaki and towards a world free of nuclear weapons. Individual stories make the experience of others really relatable. Everyone in our group was effected by the stories told. I particularly liked the messages behind the many thousands of paper cranes on display."
59,Definitely go!,Very moving and thoughtfully curated museum..better than Hiroshima in my viewExtremely cheap ¥150!Peace park is also good but the museum was the highlight for me.
60,Meaningful,This museum shows the horrors of what a nuclear bomb and war can do to mankind.  Man's inhumanity to man is so well shown here.   Thousands of innocent people killed and maimed and there are still people alive today suffering from the effects of this horrendous happening.  It is a must to see in Nagasaki and take your time when visiting to read all the information.  Very interesting.
61,Painful but A Must See Place,After seeing the near commercialism of Hiroshima this was so well done in showing the real effect on the community and the recovery from such dire event.
62,humble respect,This museum thoughtfully provides information and insight into the devastation caused by the atomic bomb. It's a must visit when you are in Nagasaki.
63,Deeply moving,"Impressive museum with a message. It gives an good overview about the aweful event that happened in the past. Warning: you do see pictures of dead people, burnings etc. But the museum also explains the different stages and arrogants which have been found afterwards."
64,Must visit place in Nagasaki ,"Visited this museum on a cruise port stop primarily to compare it to the Atomic Bomb museum in Hiroshima.  Although this museum does not have as many historical photos and graphic displays as Hiroshima, it provides a truer history of the Japanese involvement in WWII.  I was very disturbed by the Hiroshima museum's historical writeup about how Japan went into China to ""help"" the Chinese as it's an attempt to hide the historical fact that it was an invasion and attempt to take over China.  At least in the Nagasaki museum, there were at least a couple of displays using the terms ""invasion"" in describing the Japanese presence in China during WWII.  The museum also provided an inside look at what the U.S. was planning and why Nagasaki was bombed as an atomic target.  I highly recommend visitors interested in the atomic bombed cities to visit both museums to make their own comparison and judgments on how history could be manipulated..."
65,Atomic bomb's devastation,I’ve been to Hiroshima and this one in Nagasaki May not be as big and explicit but the idea of it all still strikes home. Be ready to walk uphill though. The hyper center is also located below which means you have to go up the stairs again.
66,Impressive,"I knew this would be a confronting Museum and so it was.Haunting and so sad, the cost of the atomic bomb must not ever be forgotten. This museum is critical to ensure we dont forget what the city and people of Nagasaki endured.Compelling, achingly real and heartbreaking.Expect to be touched. Expect to remember this place."
67,Day after Hiroshima,"Excellent museum, mix of exhibits, photos, videos, explanatory models, replicas and original pieces - very disturbing/sombre experience but gives you a complete understanding of how this happened and the immediate and long term effects and also the history of nuclear weapons afterwards upto modern day."
68,Insightful Visit,"A must see when in Nagasaki - the displays were graphic and gave a good sense of what the city was like before and after the bombing. It makes visitors aware of how quickly so many lives can be snuffed out from one moment to the next. There are a number of interesting artifacts and stories from survivors with translations in English, as well as audio tours. The hundreds of thousands of cranes in the entrance way are touching."
69,Excellent eye opener,"A very good insight of the bombing of Nagasaki, was very interesting and of course very emotional. Well laid out."
70,Japan Holiday 2019,"The atomic museum is the must go destination in Nagasaki. To see and experience second hand from survivor testimony of the A bomb blast is something that we all should experience. The major part of the museum centres on the bomb, the science of the bomb and most importantly the impact it had on Nagasaki. Being picky here but there is not enough information on the build up and decisions made to detonate the bomb... but maybe that is all difficult territory to explore. So read up before and discuss afterwards."
71,History and voices of the people ,"As much as the entry architecture of the building would have you believe you are moving through the historic hypocenter of the bomb, that park is elsewhere (not far). Most of the museum is very quiet, despite many visitors, and taking pictures just feels disrespectful.  Most of the displays describe the magnitude of human life lost and building destruction.  Evidence of the UV effects and the melting effects of the bomb are on display and the eerie coincidence that all the clocks stopped at 11:02."
72,Excellent!,A must see museum while in Nagasaki but worth the cost of entry. A solemn experience so can be quite draining. From the museum an easy walk to the peace park.
73,"Many, many ""how"" and no any ""why"". This is what freedom from evaluation comes to...",To realise the terrifying disaster and consequences to the residents of Nagasaki after the drop of the atomic bomb in the Second World War.
74,Histotical artifacts,Visiting museum we know what happened exactly when the atomic bomb was dropped in August 1945. It was disaster for the people.
75,Excellent museum,This excellent museum tells the horrors of nuclear war. It's a must visit on any trip to Nagasaki. Sad and thought-provoking
76,Excellent,"HIROSHIMA is for ProtestNAGASAKI is for PrayerThat's how our fabulous guide, MIYUKI, put it as the difference between the HIROSHIMA & NAGASAKI Bomb Museums .. ..Well laid out and incredibly informative .. .. Take your time, wander and reflect .. ..I actually like it better than HIROSHIMAs museum .. .. For me, HIROSHMA was too big and NAGASAKI was just right .. ..And, unlike Hiroshima, the Nagasaki museum had a timeline of JAPANs involvement in WWII that put them in harm's way of history .. .."
77,Learning the history,"Anyone wanting to understand the effect of nuclear weapons must visit this museum. Some of the exhibits are confronting and bring to life the horrible impact of a single bomb on a community of over 300,000 people."
78,If you love world war history.,"This is just a short walking distance from the Peace Park and the Hypocenter of the bombing.  It is often full of school children learning (the Japanese version) about the war and the atom bomb.  It certainly gives a ""victims"" perspective on the bombing and very one-sided (and flat-out incorrect) information about the Americans dropping the bomb and the efforts for a peaceful end to the war without the bomb.  Despite what I consider a warped perspective, the museum is excellent, informative and very interesting for about an hour."
79,Atomic bomb museum,"The museum is very nicely laid out, it is full of memorabilia and facts regarding the devastation caused by the nuclear bomb having been dropped in 1945.The museum was strangely silent as people walked round taking in the facts and horror of the event.Definitely a place to visit, and only costs a small amount to get in."
80,Solemn and appropriate,"Finally aware why I'm here at Nagasaki. Where the World war 2 started from here.. Open my eyes to study about 1945 aug 9, the 2nd nuclear atom drop on top of the sky of a Chruch, death n hurt about 14k ppl..  not a fans of history but really a must knowledge for life.History continue. Won't too boring of the museum. After the museum can walk to the exact where the boom explored, left one ""tiang"" standing .."
81,Interesting history from the other side of the WW2,A must to see and do if you go to Nagaaki. Hope on the Blue tram and get off stop 19. Very emotional and sad
82,Educational visit,"This is an smallish museum depicting events surrounding the bombing of Nagasaki.  There are also many artifacts affected by the bombing, the most famous of which is a water tower from an elementary school.  The issue for me is that I was quite familiar with these events and the museum added little to my knowledge."
83,Sombre but educational visit,"Overall the museum was well done with a clear statement of the devastating effects of the dropping of ""Fat Man"" on Nagasaki on August 7, 1945, killing between 40,000-80,000 with many dying later. Japan surrendered on August 15 and the war had ended.It also depicted the history of Japan at war in China and other places leading up to WW 2 and the development of nuclear weapons since.Overall well worth visiting and probably the best part site for understanding what transpired . Not as as good as Hiroshima but worthy of a visit."
84,Nagasaki Atomic bomb Museum,"What is the purpose of a museum? To explain facts or also to educate and answer ""why?""I have mixed feelings on this museum, as I had on the similar one in Hiroshima. Both are influenced by the need to show Japanese as Unique Victims.In terms of explaining what happened on 9th August 1945 and the impact to the people and the city, it does a great job. Many carefully arranged artefacts, with multilingual labels, are on display. And for those that don't skip the later (less visually arresting section) you'll get some background to the War and the role of Japanese militarism in the catastrophe.But you may also come away with the impression that:1) the dropping of the  Atomic bombs represented some new and catastrophic moral line the Allies crossed. This is  dubious, given that 6 months earlier far more Japanese civilians had died in the American firebombing of Tokyo on March 9th-10th). So the right question is why the war had reached the point where democratically elected civilian politicians accepted the need for arguably indiscriminate mass attacks on civilians?2) the dropping of atomic weapons was avoidable as Japan was about to surrender. Contentious, to say the least.3) a world without nuclear weapons would be more peaceful. Also contentious - at least for those of us who lived through the Cold War in Europe.Great museums don't spoon-feed babies. They help us to think about history and how to critically assess competing explanations (whilst indicating where there is a historical consensus). That's why this is a good, but not great, museum."
85,Moving Museum,"Not only does the museum displays artifacts of the bomb, it also has 3D video animation of the bomb and its effects to Nagasaki.  Video of interviews from the victims and their families were also available and there were viewing rooms to watch the videos.  It gives the visitors full awareness of the atomic bomb, its history and its effect to the community in Nagasaki."
86,Mission to Inform,"Thoroughly enjoyed the museum visit, which can be accomplished in about 2 hours even with the Peace Park next door thrown in. There’s a QR code inside the museum which allows you to access an audio guide from your mobile phone. Had expected the visit to leave me terribly sad but displays were well curated and educational without being overly emotional."
87,Difficult to access and gave a strange impression of events,"Somewhat disappointed after having visited Hiroshima. Both museums adopted an oriented viewpoint on the bomb and both truly deserve full respect for the horrors that happened after the bombings. But I cannot buy in the idea that the USA just dropped the bomb on Nagasaki to perform a scientific test. Many historicalreferences to WW II's context are missing (starting with Pearl Harbor or comparing the number of victims with that made by incendiary bombs every day...). In my (yet humble) opinion something is missing to museum's message and it fails to educate new generations on the remanent and actual threats of the atomic bomb going forward. God knows they are many.However, please judge by yourself : go there !"
88,Full of artifacts and reminders of the Atomic Bomb,"I think the museum should add a huge section explaining why the bombs were dropped, the suffering the Japanese had caused to people in nearby countries. I wonder if the Japanese, the major visitors of this museum, truly understand what had actually happened during those years."
89,Go and offer prayers in the remembrance hall,"We visited the Atomic bomb museum on a recent cruise call to Nagasaki. This museum is awe inspiring, solemn and distressingly sad but I am so glad we visited. There are videos, models, replicas and actual items from the blast - an excellent museum."
90,A Must Visit,"Very well set up with lots of actual material (i.e. metalwork, old clothing, roof tiles, etc that are actually from 1945). Almost all explanation is also available in English. We’re not usually the museum type but spent twice the time we planned in here."
91,"Poorly delivered storyline, could have greater impact",The place is well designed with lots of information for tourists. Learnt a lot about the bombing of Nagasaki. Some of the pics are sad to look at with victims charred and burnt by intense heat and flash of fire.
92,"Maybe it is my expectation, but...","I had a sad feeling going through the museum, having been to the Hiroshima A- bomb museum days ago. Quite remarkable is the timetable of the nuclear testing done around the world from 1945 to present."
93,A must visit when visiting Nagasaki,"A very detailed trip through the events of August 1945.   A lot of material to absorb.  Within  a short distance there is the Atomic Bomb museum, the Peace Park and commemorative statues, a full day is needed to do the area justice."
94,Very educational and a definite must see,"It's a place to visit to reflect on life and the senselessness of war of any kind. It does downplay Japan's role in WWII but is still a powerful place to visit nonetheless. You could spend an entire day here just to fully immerse yourself in all this place has to offer, including video testimonials."
95,Very well presented ,An atomic bomb should never be dropped again is the focus of this amazing museum. It did not focus on the reasons for it happening but on the effect. The ticking clock as you enter was spine tingling. This is a real must of a museum for all to visit.We visited on a Saturday morning and there was hardly anyone there.
96,A Definite Must See,"The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb museum contains a very thoughtful collection of relics and remnants of the 1945 bomb which was dropped close to a school and church in the city. The atmosphere inside is one of quiet reverent interest and respect. Many of the exhibits have a very moving impact on the viewer. There is also a “cut-away” full sized example of the type of nuclear bomb that the Americans dropped. This place will bring a little of the reality of what terrible damage, death and injury was caused. A moving experience."
97,Thought provoking,"Educational, a jolting reminder of the importance of working at keeping peace.  Do visit the free remembrance hall next to the museum as well."
98,Heartbreaking but Must-visit,"With the focus on peace and education this museum is thought provoking, providing information on the horrors of the atomic bomb.  Personal stories and exhibits bring to life the suffering of the people of Nagasaki.  There should be far more world focus and awareness on this event to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.  This museum is an absolute must see for visitors to Japan."
99,Modern look musuem,"We headed to Nagasaki with plans to visit the museum. A well organised museum with various artifacts, film clips and photos showing the after-math of the terrible incident.The painful sharing by the locals showed the human touch. Like one of the stories which shared a lady who is terribly burnt yet trying her best to get her child out when the rescuers told her that it is impossible for them to reach out to her kid who was stuck underneath the massive wooden blocks. She didnt say much but use her last breathe to push away the heavy blocks to save her kid before passing away almost immediately.The lesson learnt from this musuem is so enriching and emotional as it showed the human touch and mother's love."
100,Thought provoking visit,It is a must visit in Nagasaki. The exhibits show the moment of the explosion and the aftermath. The presentation hits the heart of the visitors.
101,Totally worth the visit,Makes you wonder how anyone could have done this? Moving and thought provking place you must visit if you are in the area.
102,One side part of history,The Japanese are still acutely aware of the tragedies of war and nuclear weapons and here and in Hiroshima they promote peace
103,Well maintained museum ,"Let me start by mentioning the terrible fate of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, no 'but' on my side. However, the thing that totally offends me is the fact that in the museum there is (to the best of my knowledge) zero reference to the reason why these bombs were dropped. The atrocities of the Japanese in Manchuria, Korea and the rest of southeast Asia are not mentioned. For this reason I consider this museum a missed chance."
104,Very well done,"Museums should be informed by the story of history, not partial history; advancing some great points while ignoring other essential points.  This is about the end of a war . . . an ending in horror for the nation Japan.  This ending is not presented objectively.  I get it that this is Japan so some tilt in the presentation is to be expected.  Yet the display says the bombs were dropped to save the lives of American soldiers.  This is true.  But it is just part of the truth.  Other nations’ lives stood to be saved, including, yes, Japanese. So the Japanese lives lost due to the atomic bombs were not in isolation.  Had the war continued conventionally, Japan was ready to continue the fight sacrificing many thousands of its own people.  How those lives would have added up, one battle at a time, we will never know.  But it is not totally unreasonable to imagine that more Japanese lives would have also been lost than those lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  As for the allies Americans were not fighting alone.  You would not know this from the displays here.  This was not a Japan-versus-the-United-States war, it was a World War.  Allies active in the Pacific theater also included Philippines, China, United Kingdom, India, Burma, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and others.  They all stood to sacrifice lives had the war continued.  There is nothing here suggesting why a then-belligerent Japan was fighting in the first place.  As this is a Japanese memorial mostly for the Japanese people, not visitors; perhaps they know their own history so thoroughly, the origins of the war go without saying.  For similar memorials in the US, I’m confident our own young people are not that informed of this history.  If you are interested in how a culture displays its own history, this might be a good visit.  Otherwise, you may also be disappointed."
105,A must do,"Having visited Hiroshima 2 years prior, this filled the missing pieces of the history jigsaw. I have been to many war museums and this one is very well organised and diplomatic. Strongly recommend a visit if in the area, be wary if it is hot!!"
106,This is a venue that everyone should visit.,"This is a very somber and thought provoking museum, It gives an excellent idea of the destruction caused. While it is heartbreaking to see and think about what happened, it is not to be missed if you're visiting Nagasaki."
107,Focus on peace and reconciliation,Lot of information is displayed with regards to the bombingEvents prior and after are explained in detail
108,Absolute Must See,"Though it is pretty sad to visit the museum where it's showing the city after the Bomb, but I think it is really reminded each human being to cherish world peace. We learned a painful lesson."
109,From the cruise port,"Was a very heartwrenching experience, reading about the peaceful days of Nagasaki and suddenly so many innocent lives lost in just that few minutes. So many young children, kids in school, parents at home ...The pictures say so much about the very sad impact that wars have on humankind."
110,No more wars please,I have been to Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Museum and I was reluctant to go for secound time but it's educational and no matter where you're from or what kind of opition you have I think you'll learn something from it. It's not a big museum but plan to spend  2-3 hours if you want to read and look at everything. Peace park is walking distance from this museum.
111,Very interesting,"Chilling museum. The preserved items are very realistic and impressive. The interior of the museum and the way those items are displayed gives excellent and  logical sequence of wartime events. All items are also provided with English explanations. An absolute must if you wish to be informed in a very realistic way what happened to Nagasaki in August 1945. There is also a nice bookshop within the museum, however the amount of English language books is rather limited."
112,Good exhibits showcasing the human toll of war,Smaller yet better than Hiroshima. I have visited for decades and seen the progression in the museum to its current state.
113,"Sobering, very well curated, very sad in the end","This is so well put together, worth allowing a few hours to go through, partly to read the detail in the exhibits but also because of the volume of visitors. Very respectfully done considering the sadness so many families have gone through then kindly donated their personal items."
114,Museum to vosir,Very sombre exhibit - be prepared. Reminds you why revenge war is never good although I sense there's a bit of downplay of the root cause of this -  the Japanese invasion into southeast asia. Well maintained museum with a good part of the exhibits neatly translated. The last part of the exhibit about US's role on making the atomic bomb is mainly in Japanese when 90% of the exhibits are well translated in English - wonder what they don't want foreigners to read. Wish they could have ended the exhibition by acknowledging the wrongs of the Jap invasion and how innocent citizen lives are made to pay for the price of the invasion. The very last photo of the young boy was simply heart breaking.
115,Very well set out,The horror of war is seen at this very moving museum. Lots of stark reminders of that awful day. Lots of exhibits to read and gaze upon.
116,A new museum,It was a good place for those who love WII history and military science.A must visit in Nagasaki city.
117,Atomic bomb museum ,"This is a much smaller museum compared to the one at Hiroshima, however the exhibit and impact from the museum is still strong.  It is very close to the Peace park.  A note of warning, the exhibits might be too much for small children  - so I would take caution of this."
118,Japan is not a victim.,"Although the subject itself was quite disturbing, the displays were well presented and informative. Everything is labeled in English, so we had no trouble guiding ourselves with no audio guide. They have examples on display of items that were distorted by the blast that you are able to touch; the effect is quite shocking. I was moved most by all the personal accounts from the survivors. An absolute must-see for anyone visiting Nagasaki."
119,Amazing presentation of the dropping of the 2nd atomic bomb,"Having been on a walking tour around Nagasaki and listened to the stories of the atomic bomb, we visited the museum and the whole experience was very sobering. There were some very good visual aids showing the effects on the surrounding area in the moments, days and weeks after the bomb.It is just to hard to describe the detail which the museum contains and it is definitely somewhere everyone should visit.One overriding memory is that after walking through all the displays showing the devastating effects of the bomb, there is then a display showing which countries still have nuclear bombs, how many they have and how often they carry out tests,It really must never happen again."
120,Nicely done,"The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum and surrounding area, including ground zero of the atomic bomb that struck Nagasaki, is a powerful and emotional must-see in Nagasaki. The museum includes a plethora of historic items and photos and explains the history before, during, and after the dropping of the bomb and its horrific affects. A theme throughout the museum is the importance of peace. Of particular interest, visitors can access any of many videotaped interviews with survivors and others related to the circumstances surrounding the bombing.  It's an important reminder of the cruelty and horrors of war - something leaders around the world would do well to absorb."
121,The importance of peace,"I am sorry but I can only compare it to the Museum at Hiroshima which is miles ahead in every way. I left the museum still looking for answers, & was if fact disappointed."
122,Informative on Past and Present Nuclear Situation,"As per the other reviews, the horrible tragedy that struck Nagasaki city and its people are well described via chilling photos and relics. It’s certainly moving and designed to evoke strong emotions. What is not well covered is the ever important question of “why” the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombing of Pearl Harbour. Countless atrocities that the Japanese Imperial forces caused in Asia. The rise of blind fascism, imperialism and racism towards its colonies. Essential ignorance of the Potsdam declaration. Leaders’ sacrifice of its own people in kamikaze attacks. Why the Japan’s denno had to be essentially stripped of his power and be left as a figurehead post surrender.Granted, in comparison to completely whitewashed exhibits of Hiroshima, there is some mention of the history of Japan in WW2 in a small part of display (curiously, in Japanese only), as well as some interactive videos that point to the rise of fascism in Japan. I also noted the videos of Australian POW survivors who did voice out that the atomic bombing would have prevented the Allied invasion of Japan and the millions of casualty that this would have caused. Perhaps any more than this, the museum will face the wrath of the ultra-right nationalists and be entangled in a political cross line.However, this is still not enough. This was not some natural disaster. Japan was not an innocent bystander and victim, but an active and belligerent participant. We must hope and work towards a future without another nuclear tragedy, not by merely singing peace songs and folding pape cranes but through impartial education and analysis of past actions and mistakes. It is the lack of this component that left me with a bitter taste as I left the museum."
123,"A well presented collection of objects, images and tragic stories.",A really thoughtful presentation of a horrible atrocity.  Well laid out and very informative. It’s really a must see if in the area. Allow a couple of hours to see it all plus the park. Very sobering.
124,Historic site,"If you love world war 2 historyYou must go to NagasakiAtomic Bomb Museum.Everything in this place is so touch.Museum have more information about world war 2 japanese people in nagasaki , fat man(name of nuclear) or etc."
125,"Of course, a must see",The museum is very interesting and shows a lot about how the impact of the bomb happened and what it did to city and people. Unfortunately it doesn't show a lot of the other side of the history.
126,"Stunningly sad, an excellent historical reflection","This place is a must see if your in Nagasaki thought provoking and very interesting, meeting a survivor in the peace park was an unexpected honor"
127,Good review of history surrounding bombing,"By far the most interesting place I have visited a world of education in one place, so easy to get to, we took the tram from the port and found that it was so easy to use, and very cheap."
128,Chilling museum,"I've been to both atomic bomb museums in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You can't really compare the two but in my opinion the Hiroshima museum has more impact. Nonetheless, this one is sobering and leaves you at a loss for words. Be it the displays of ceramic roof tiles that bubbled and melted in the 3500c blast heat or the human bones that are embedded in a molten glass bottle, the museum does a good job of illustrating that this famous event, one that we have all read about, is really a tragedy that has a huge human element to it, one that you cannot truly appreciate unless you see it with your own eyes. The atomic bomb drop is a defining point in the history of this city, if you are going to visit Nagasaki then you owe it to yourself to visit this museum. Entrance is only ¥200."
129,Historical Moment,It is a museum in Nagasaki with the place of Ground Zero of the atomic bomb. As you walk through you get to see the sad turn of events with the bombing and the after effects.
130,Balanced perspective,Everyone who comes to Nagasaki or even Japan needs to visit the museum. Very well designed and thought out. Well done to the curators and historians.
131,Sobering indeed,"Pleased we came, the Japanese have handled this event well in the Museum. Exhibits relate to time and dates, no inference or suggestions concerning either side seen.How to get there: Take a number 1 or 3 Tram from Nagasaki Station, go down the first stairs for the Tram, they are past the stairs for the buses.Get off at Hammaguchi Station.Look across the road and you will see Lawsons, take the road up the incline on the left of the Lawsons store for 300 metres, turn right past the Daiwa hotel.You can see the building from the corner, approx 100 metres.Very confronting when you see Women, children, prisoners of war and familes destroyed.Takes about 2 to 3 hours to visit.Peace Park access is via steps down from the Museum Building."
132,Disappointing,This is a modern museum which gives you a good impression how Nagasaki was before and after the bombing.
133,"Moving,  Sobering.","Stopped here on a tour from our cruise ship, and glad we did. I never realized that The three potential targets for a second bomb were Kokura, Kyoto and Niigata, in that order. But the day they bombed these sites were clouded in and could not be found. The plane circled a few times and couldn't see anything, then through the clouds they spotted Nagasaki and decided to drop the bomb there. So basically those people were very unlucky. Much to my surprise, the people there are very friendly towards Americans!"
134,Military,"As one of the atomic bomb museum, she is responsibility of showing the truth of history and reminding the next generation of tragedy. By providing the sufficient and moderate information at the end of exhibition, I think the museum has been done a good job!"
135,Eye opening ,The museum replays what happened that horrible day in sometimes very graphical pictures and tells the story from a number of angles. Lots of exhibits showing the immense force of the destruction.Maybe not for very young childeren because of the pictures.
136,Must visit ,The museum reminds us of the tragic history related to the horrific event that war could bring to mankind. It was heartbreaking to see some of the exhibits. The atmosphere was somber and quiet. It shows how innocent people had to pay for the cruelty of the war.
137,Multiple ,Learnt about the impact of atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Paid 157 Yen for English audio set which was helpful. Entrance fee is 200 Yen and you can go up to the roof to see the actual site where the bomb was dropped. Highly recommended if you are in Nagasaki.
138,Must Do,"Most visit Nagasaki to understand the effects of the atomic bomb, and the museum does an excellent job of conveying them in the most solemn of ways. The museum itself was very simple - there were no gimmicky exhibits or over-the-top displays. The whole place was simple, making all the items on display, primarily artifacts from the war period, much more impactful. English captions were available for all exhibits and were well-written. Definitely a must do when in Nagasaki, and perhaps half a day, just to take in the full scope of the tragedy, would be good at the museum."
139,Humbling ,"This is a ‘not to miss’ tour when going to Japan, very raw and still stuck in the hearts of the Japanese. Fairly graphic images, remains of structures and live pictures of the days and day after the bomb was dropped. A bit of walking involves outside the museum, toilets available, you have to pay to go inside the museum but ground zero is free. It’s easy to find, wheelchair friendly."
140,Poignant reminder of the WWII.,"Yes this is a must visit when in Nagasaki, possibly after visiting the peace park as it shows the horrors of war and is a stark reminderThe staff again speak very little English and the signage could be so much better to give precise instructions to non Japanese visitors"
141,Must go- read up first,We were here to remember the tragedies of Hiroshima/Nagasaki on the 72nd Anniversaries of the August 1945 bomb Drops. The Museum is well documented in the creation and evolution of Nuclear technology. Could say more about War Atrocities on Both sides (no mention of Pearl Harbour). Overall a moving place which reminds us of People's cruelty and coming around to Peace. Good luck and enjoy!
142,Must see,"The museum is full of artifacts from the ruins of the bombing. It explains the effects of the bomb on the people involved and the surroundings, you can even watch multiple different accounts of the bombing from both Japanese and western people who fell victim to the nuclear bomb.The history and everything revolving the bombing is explained."
143,Worth a visit ,Explored the place with the kids and we all learnt a lot about the bomb that hit Nagasaki. Hope the kids remember the stories!
144,A  must visit,"This museum is next to the site where the bomb hit in Nagasaki. It has various exhibits telling stories of victims and survivors.  At the entrance is a series of paper cranes.  The legend is that anyone who folds 1000 paper cranes gets their wish granted. A 12 year old girl exposed to radiation from the bomb at age 2 folded cranes in hopes of her wish of surviving would be granted, but died before she could complete them. The museum is not huge, but it is modern, interesting and comprehensive."
145,Saddening but super informative,"Predictably you come away with a profound melancholy despite a certain lack of balance in how the story is told. Have never understood how the second bomb was justified (except by an inhumane desire to compare uranium and plutonium variants). But had forgotten Nagasaki was a secondary target with little strategic value, especially compared to Kokura, the prime target. And how only a momentary break in the cloud permitted the eventual drop. All that said the storyboards and the videos have precious little to say about the inhumanity which gave weight to proponents of the weapon’s use. Visitors from the Philippines and Korea with engrained family lore to factor in may find the presentation wanting."
146,One of the best and worst museums i have ever been too,Went as part Inspiring Vacations tour.WHAT AN EYE OPENER! the devastation that occurred with this event was extremely well portrayed in fine detail.Well worth the visit
147,Good but not great,It s amazing to see how the residents from Nagasaki raised from the ashes of an atomic bomb to a beautiful and peaceful community.
148,Must-see Museum in Nagasaki,"Very well done, exhibits were well thought out, with first hand accounts, and real stories of people who survived the explosion.Simple everyday items are also displayed  to show us how the extreme heat, and power of the bomb explosion destroyed the materials. Very relevant today as countries are getting more and more nuclear arsenal , that is more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki"
149,Highly informative with a great collection of artefacts,"I found this museum to be very honest and informative, blending politics, facts, humanity and artifacts tastefully and honorably.  I would recommend getting the audio guide. There is quite a lot you can read depending on time you want to spend your interest level,but please take time to read all the exhibit info you can.  English was common among the written narratives, but can't say what other languages there were.  I learned quite a lot & was touched.  The origami tributes/prayers that are throughout are beautiful and meaningful.  The museum layout allowed for easy comfortable viewing with lots of ""elbow room"".  The air conditioning was great & appreciated in July!!  Be sure to go to the hypocenter park as well as the remembrance park adjacent."
150,4th of July Nagasaki City Japan Travel,"Historical symbolic museum, emotional, ecstatic, grand place. Though the old site is demolished to build modern buildings. However, the site gives you the history and the location where the bomb landed in Japan."
151,Informative and detailed,Very thought provoking.  A small museum but with just enough to enable you to learn all about the August of 1945 and feel the horror of what happened. Very informative.  Every Country's leader should visit and this will hopefully ensure that nothing like this can ever happen again. Pictures of victims and information about the bomb.
152,A must-see!,We visited her 30 years ago since then the building has been demolished and totally rebuilt - the display material remains basically the same but the presentation is amazing- well worth a visit
153,An emotional trip,The site gave a lot of information about what happened during ending world war 2 and what the dramatic consequences were caused by the atomic bomb. It is a must to see.
154,"Fascinating, Informatative and Thought Provoking","I had a chance to visit this museum on the actual day of the Nagasaki Bombing, 9 Aug. There were lots of paper cranes given as offerings from people all over Japan/the world. The atmosphere was very gloomy, sad and heavy. I have always been a lover of places with history and this is definitely a good attraction to visit. It gives detailed description of the atomic bombings, something in which we should and must never let it happen again in our lifetimes.Highly recommended place of visit when you go to Nagasaki."
155,"August 9, 1945:  A Museum to reflect on the significance of that day","The atomic bomb museum is located next to peace park and hypocenter, it is a museum focused on educating people of the tragedy 70 years ago. It is fully ac so its a quite pleasant experience. The entrance fee is cheap too!"
156,A stop-over for history and non-history lovers,This was quite sad to see all the damage done but the Japanese say how silly it was for their generals from an island country to attack the USA and Britain on the same day.
157,really sad !,"Nagasaki atomic bom museum is a place to remind us to always keep the peace around the world. War brings nothing good.The museum gave us a look on how horrible the atomic bomb is. The effect is still felt until now.The collection of the museum include the remains of buildings and things after the bomb, photo, video, and there also some special exhibitions held about the portrait of the survivors."
158,A Piece of History,"The museum does not try to sugarcoat thinga from Japan’s perspective. Their actions during the WWII and those of the US and other countries just show no one really wins in war. It’s a very sad place to visit, but it is important to remind people of the past and see how those who survive must continue to live with their loss and their pain. You can go to Japan for the anime, the castles, the ramen and the festivals, but also go to Nagasaki and Hiroshima to see how their history will always have the marks of the atomic bombs and all their work as a people since then has been to rise from that and be better for having endured it."
159,History Museum ,"A very well presented display. Full English interpretation. Only drawback was the cast of many school children, but I guess they have to go some time."
160,Zero historic reference to World War II,The museum gives a good overview of the terrible events on 9 August 1945. The pictures were more explicit than those in the museum in Hiroshima. We were surprised to see young kids viewing this pictures. It is good to be aware of this for parents with younger children.
161,An important meuem,"Having visited Hiroshima as well, there’s more of a sense of anger here- and the human cost of the bomb seems even more stark (although more died at Hiroshima). It was almost accidental that Nagasaki was bombed - whilst it was on the original long list of 17 targets - it wasn’t on the short list (which included Hiroshima and Kyoto), and it seems to have been added a potential second target to Hiroshima at the very last minute (just scrawled, in hand, on the strike order). Whereas the attack on Hiroshima was well planned and strategic, even General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project (described as a micro-manager) years later couldn’t figure out when and why Nagasaki was selected, especially as it held a POW camp.Even on the day of the bombing it was the secondary target. The attack on the first target, Kokura, was abandoned due to ‘fog’ (although it could’ve been due to the smoke caused by the allied bombing of Yawata the previous day) and the attack on Nagasaki was almost abandoned due to real fog. The plane, the Bockscar, (most people seem to know the name of the plane that bombed Hiroshima- the Enola Gay- but not the one that bombed Nagasaki), was almost on its last dregs of fuel, when a gap in the cloud opened- and they dropped Fat Man. It didn’t even hit its intended target- the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works- but instead it hit the centre of the city- the bit where all the maps show the schools were. As the museum also shows, the Japanese government were about to surrender after the bombing of Hiroshima, the subsequent bombing of Nagasaki almost seems an after-thought- except for for thousands of people wiped out, due to the scrawled, hand-written, change to the final strike order."
162,Moving but well worth it ,This is a good museum that highlights the atrocities of war and its long-lasting devastating effects till this day. Suitable for adults and teenagers. Good place to learn about the history of related events as well.
163,Awe inspiring - so glad we visited,"This is a must see museum. When you enter it starts with how Nagasaki was chosen as the target.As you walk through there are photos of Nagasaki before and after the explosion, and horrific photos of injuries to the survivors. There are letters written by survivors just after the explosion detailing their thoughts, very sad to read some of them.There is a life size model of the Atomic Bomb ""Fat Man"".At the exit there is a wall covering how many nuclear weapons are in the world today and who as them.A very solemn place, a place to reflect, a place to pray that this never happens again."
164,A visit to this museum will give lasting memories,"I have been in Hiroshima Bomb museum and Nagasaki is comparatively small and less visitors. However, atomic bomb reminds us war is terrifying and all of us should keep peace in mind."
165,"For those to Remember,And never Forget","The museum isn't ""in your face"" but rather one of survival for the citizens of the city and the strength of the city to rebuild and become the city it is now.  This is a MUST do to understand the city of Nagasaki.  Aside from a replica of the atomic bomb (mindblowing how the little fusion site destroyed lives and the city itself), we walked away with the words from a survivor of ""Remember where you are.  Our loved ones died here.  You are walking on their remains""."
166,Thought provoking museum,"Be sure to get the audio guide as it offers additional information to the signs. Moving, but has less graphic photos than in the Hiroshima Memorial Museum."
167,"""please rest in peace, we shall not repeat the same error""",The museum is a record of the timeline that lead to the bombing. Photographs and artifacts are displayed in a sensitive manner. There is an emphasis on recording the past to highlight the need for World Peace in the future.
168,Moving experience,"If you have to compare the museum between hiroshima and nagasaki, I would say the one in hiroshima is much worth going. There are explanations as to why this place was chosen and how it affected the people but not as much in depth as the one in hiroshima, was disappointed."
169,Well done and balanced.,Struggled up a steep hill to get to the site and the first thing I encountered on entering the building was a steep flight of steps down. Not the best designed museum. It was sobering to see the exhibits but personally I felt as though the history was very one sided. The overall impression was that the town had been unexpectedly bombed and had then gone on to be a world leader in anti nuclear peace campaigns. Missing the history of why the horrific incident had been caused by all parties involved.
170,Facinating and outstanding,This is a museum that you have to visit. It is a travel in time back to the end of WWII. All world leaders should visit this museum.
171,A must to do in Nagasaki,"Not much to add to the title other than you need to go and experience the exhibits.  While a visit to Nagasaki may not be as compelling as going to Hiroshima, this is a must see."
172,Very confusing place with limited facilties,"Very well laid out. If you have been to the museum in Hiroshima, this is not the same! It is small and graphic, not for the squeamish, but it happened and we should all learn from it, never more so than now!"
173,A day in Nagasaki,"In light of all the nuclear talk between Trump and Long Un, this is the place they should both visit to get their heads screwed on right. Adjacent to Peace Park, this museum shows the  destruction and after-effects of the bomb on innocent humanity. A worthwhile visit..."
174,Cruise excursion,"Given the rhetoric between a couple of world leaders these days, a visit to this museum might be of true value.  Seeing the displays, the artifacts, the taped interviews, documents - who would want to ever think to use another atomic bomb on anyone or even have them as part of the arsenal?   The museum, itself, is smallish but packs a true punch.  No one talks much, there is no banter or laughter.  A very sobering experience."
175,Very sad and moving,"This museum tells one about Nagasaki, of course it does, but it also puts the events into context and informs of the processes that lead to the bomb being deployed. It tells of the time and the place the world was in at the time. Extremely informative, interesting and very much worth a visit, or in my case a repeat visit when I get the chance."
176,Superb!!!,It’s hard to look at some of the photos and read the stories but it’s a good reminder of horrors that come with war. I think there’s enough information provided in the museum without a tour.
177,Impressive and well set up. ,"You know, this is the one of the most heavy feeling places I ever visited.Museum of Atomic Bomb you can call Museum of Peace. Call to the Peace. Call through a pain, fear, despair of war. A demon that turn people to an evil creatures that murdering men, women, children, old ones. Turning moms, dads, sons, daughters to an ashes and burned corpses bleeding and crying because of the unbearable pain.You seems to be transferred in time. Dark room and a lot of photos. Common photos of common morning of common people. Owner prepare his shop to open. Children goes to school. Janitor cleaning streets. Trams are ready to start a line. Common morning of common people... you almost hear a laugh of scholars, noise of milk truck engine, water rings in a river and wind whispers in a leafs of a trees... but... you hear a clock. Tick-tock-tick-tock. Boys are running in a school.Tick-tock-tick-tock. Taxi driver is open a door of his car.Tick-tock-tick-tock... soon... soon... a bombers are already here. Soon... tick-tock...And in a moment morning city with all it’s people turns into an ash...“Water, water, give me a water, please, I beg you...” and a men gives a water to a burned young girl, she drinks it once and dying with only one word “thank you”...All this place just staying in a water. Memorial with tens of thousands lights that are shining under a thin layer of water. Fountain of the Peace is a wings of water, hundreds bottles of water under monuments... living now people seems to ask them sorry and bringing water to a souls...So much feels a pain... and feel of lump in throat that bitter unbearably...If only there were no war... If only there would no war.Strongly recommend to visit + Peace Park."
178,Interesting displays ,While once could never say this is a fun stop it is very well done.  Most of the signs have English and there is an excellent English audio guide.
179,Bringing the experience to an individual level,"Whilst in Nagasaki a visit to the atomic bomb museum is a must, it is easily reached from the train station on any tram.You will come away with the knowledge that nuclear weapons must never be used again."
180,Somber Museum-Moving Experience,"Having visited the Hiroshima museum the previous day we were very emotionally in touch with the content already. I, however, felt that this museum was better. In a different way. It’s difficult to compare the two are they both share tragic stories and articles related to the horrific bombings. In my opinion this museum gave a more well-rounded perspective, also sharing more background of the war and arms race as well as the future of our planet under the threat of nuclear weapons. I felt that if I were to recommend one or the other to someone who only had time for one I would choose Nagasaki."
181,Haunting,"the right place for the people all over this world to reminisce how brutality of war, it's quite sad and provoking historical museum, here with the aspiration message from cenotaph for the A-bomb victims, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum ""please rest in peace, we shall not repeat the same error"""
182,Very interesting,It’s worth a visit and is well layed out. Lots of English explanations. My only disappointment is it doesn’t really explain why the bomb was dropped.
183,Lest we forget,Every person should be aware of the power and devastation that mankind is capable of subjecting others to. Very deep.
184,required viewing,"This museum is ""quaint"" compared to the high tech one in Hiroshima.  I learned a lot here, its important to keep an open mind as the history lessons are a bit different than what I learned decades ago.  I lingered here reading everything and I am convinced that every world leader needs to visit places like this."
185,Made an impact,"While the effects of the bomb are very vividly portrayed and the human suffering shown clearly, it is disappointing to see any lack of context. It is stated that Japan was at war since 1937 not that Japan had started these wars.No reference is made to the terrors imposed by the Japanese Imperial Army in places such as Manchuria, Singapore or Burma where civilians and POWs were killed without mercy or starved to death. Perhaps a reference to the Burma railway and the horrors imposed by the Japanese might help understand why a wonder weapon would end their ability to impose more death and destruction. The reference in text claiming that as millions of dollars had been spent on developing the bomb, it had to be used, is offensive. President Truman took an appallingly difficult decision and the correct one. I am not from the USA."
186,"Presented as victims, not villains ","Visit for the artifacts. Do not visit for any history lesson. The Information panels lead one to believe that the Japanese had no fault in the dropping of the atomic bomb. Example: information panel states “Pacific War starts” instead of “Japan brings United States into WW2 by bombing Pearl Harbour before declaring war”.  Be aware that the video at the museum entry cause congestion, but you can watch the same video further inside."
187,Not easy viewing but a must-visit ...,"The museum takes you through the short part of the history of Nagasaki from just before the bomb and takes you through many years after it happened. A visitor can see what was the Nagasaki like before and after the event and what were the consequences on land, city, infrastructure and especially on the people."
188,Atomic Bomb Museum March 2018,"Ignoring the fact that the museum twists history and ignores the Japanese war crimes, it is a very nice and interesting place to visit."
189,Must visit in Nagasaki,There museum is well set out with enough English to make it interesting. It is hard to see what happened to so many of the citizens. At the very end there are some displays asking for an end to nuclear weapons and the number held by many nations. Well worth a visit.
190,Vacation ,"We first visited this museum 13 years ago and it's the same, apart from the end where you get to see a wall of places that are still resting atomic bombs. I was amazed to see that the US has tested one this year...in the year 2019!!!Moving account of the bomb through survivor stories, objects and WWII history."
191,"Hopefully, never again","There were so many Japanese school parties here and the children clearly did not understand the significance of the place.  It felt totally surreal to be so distraught and moved while surrounded by a sea of laughter and exuberance.  I shall never forget the experience.The cafe is pretty useless.  Serves only the basics and in a country where waiters and waitresses are unfailingly helpful, the staff were all surly and miserable.Finding your way into the museum is quite tricky.  It seems to have so many entrances, yet once inside it is not very clear where to go. But maybe a lot better without a million kids around?"
192,A must see if in town,"For 200yen entry, not expensive. I went on a very rainy day so it was pretty quiet, but even then there were a lot of tourists. Parts were ruined by others taking photos (despite signs not to), and speaking loudly in the halls when it really calls for quiet reflection. A somber trip to be sure, but truly important."
193,Well done & Reflective  .. ..,"My wife and I spent a hot August summer day in the Atomic Bomb Museum. The museum is a commemoration of the unfortunate event when the US unlatched the atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki on Aug 9, 1945 at 11.02am. The exhibits include pictures, interviews, actual items from the war, etc. I recommend using the audio guide if Japanese is not your first language. Definitely a sombre wake-up call that nobody ultimately wins in a war. Worth a visit..."
194,Sadly interesting,It has very well done museum about Nagasaki’s dark history. Some photos and short movies may be too graphic to the children. But this place and the one in Hiroshima are must to go.
195,The museum with pictures and exhibits before and after the Atomic Bomb.,You just need to go and see this place. There is no real way to describe it on here to do it justice.
196,Extremely Well Done Museum,"Not a very large museum, which can be covered in a couple of hours. The exhibits are more focused on the human toll of the atomic bombing, with many artifacts demonstrating the destructive power of the bombing and the horrific injuries suffered by the victims. The last section, which showcases personal letters and artworks from some of the victims and their relatives, is especially poignant. The audioguide is useful, and recommended. If you visit with children, be prepared to help explain some of the exhibits, which can be disturbing as the museum has chosen not to sanitise any of the images of the victims."
197,Not As Graphic As Hiroshima But Truer Historical Display,"Visited this museum as part of a trip in the Far East and how glad I was that I made the effort. The museum is very well laid out, gives lots of information and accounts from survivors of the bomb. I felt very humble after being there. I only hope to God we as human beings never allow this to happen again."
198,Importance of  peace,"The museum not only presents the tragic past of Nagasaki but it also gives you an idea, how many countries in the world have nuclear program, which frankly, is alarming. Because of the data and display available, you would need  a couple of hours to really digest and understand the purpose of this museum. There is a museum shop that sells english books and some souvenirs."
199,A very sobering experience,People should learn the lesson from this horrible history. The museum exhibits scientific aspect of atomic bomb. We learn about more details about war in Asia which eventually merged to WWII.
200,A great way to learn about an awful time in history....,A bit overwhelming. But it tells the whole story. You cannot come to Nagasaki without visiting this museum and the adjacent Peace Park and the spot marking closest point to the explosion of the atomic bomb. May we all learn from this......
201,Poignant,...and it never gets old coming here. Most of the displays makes me well up with emotion and question the principles and morality of my country - really the overall decency of the people involved in doing this.  Two things were striking for me on this visit.  First was that photo of the little boy with his dead baby brother on his back.  I don't think photos get much more powerful than that.  The other being that this photo gave me pause to think just how resilient the Japanese people are.  I'm not sure another culture could have survived (and flourished no less)  the devastating atomic bombings.
202,Worth a visit,Well worth a visit to understand history a lot better. The horrors of war is terrifying and should act as a good warning to us
203,Learning experience,a very sad place due to the tragedy that happened. but a must-visit when int he city. it gives a good details on what actually happened on D-Day. short walk from the tram station. spend some time and take it all in.
204,My China Trip,Building was new and there was a bookshop and a cafe.Bookshop selling limited English books that is worth a read.I prefer the mesuem at Hiroshima which has more significance and history.Easily access by tram with a 7 min walk.
205,Very moving.,"This is a 'must-visit' museum when you are on a trip to Nagasaki. The visit will be incredibly sobering/serious and yet highly educational and enlightening.Please make sure to get the audio guides (for a small additional fee) as these will give you a ton of more information than what is provide in the limited English text boards next to the exhibits.I would say, plan on spending around 2-3 hours at least and do plan to walk it to the hypocenter and the nearby peace park."
206,Lack of balance,Must visit. Amazing place that gives you a goosebumps. So sad and tragic story of people who experienced atomic bomb attack.
207,A must to see,"By visiting the museum you will experience the details of the day through photos, film, artifacts and relics recovered from the site. Of particular interest is the way in which the Japanese present the event - and on our visit there were loads of school kids there for a day field trip. A Perfect place for kids to learn about their history and the terrible tragedy of nuclear warfare. There are displays not only of artifacts but those that show a model of the ""fat boy"" bomb and how it was made and how such a bomb is detonated. This is a museum not to be missed for its insight into this terrible day and the human tragedy that occurred. The museum is air conditioned, plenty of bathrooms and they do a great job moving people through so don't be intimidated if you see lines or lots of school kids. They are great - polite and friendly and offering their greetings to you."
208,Excellent Museum !,"We travelled here after visiting Hiroshima and did both museums. Both my husband and myself felt that this museum offered more (the other is still very good). We elected to do the audio guide and felt that the place was less crowded and that you could really take the time to experience everything it had to offer there were exhibition pieces, video interviews and objects from the impact that you can actually touch."
209,Amazing,A timely reminder of the destruction mankind can bring to this world. It was an emotional journey but everyone needs a reminder now and then.
210,Must visit.,I found it an interesting and poignant tour well laid out but I found the museum tour in Hiroshima better and more of an impact. Good to do both but if only one then Hiroshima would get my vote. Having said that I did learn new information here. I also found the peace memorial here more poignant.
211,A Place to Make you fell humble,"As an American, I knew it would painful to visit this museum, and it was, but the overall experience is one of recognizing why this must never happen again. Don't miss this well-designed special place."
212,Very interesting but a bit too onesided,"If you travel to Japan and get close to Nagasaki, I highly recommend that you visit the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum.  It displays the tragic history of the bombing but I did not feel that there was any attempt to justify the Japanese actions leading up to the bombing and no criticism of the U.S. decision to drop the bomb.  It just displays the horrible effect that the bombing had on people and infrastructure.  I came away with the feeling that the museum is trying to convey the grusomeness of the event in an effort to prevent it from happening again."
213,Intresting,Ok first off i will say as an American it makes you feel horrible about what happen and the reason why the museum even exist. After you that it is by far a very good museum that is very informative and very factual. I would recommend it to anyone. If you're going to Nagasaki city then this is a must. you have to be aware of what happen here to make sure the world never gets to this again.
214,Educative and Enjoyable,"The museum is tasteful and informative with artefacts, stories and photographs that bring home the futility of war and the human suffering associated with it."
215,A Should See,"The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum is a remembrance to the atomic bombing of Nagasaki by the USA.  Next to the museum is the Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims, built in 2003, which marks the hypocenter of the event. The bombing marked a new era in war, making Nagasaki a symbolic location for a memorial. The counterpart in Hiroshima is the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. These locations symbolize the nuclear age, remind visitors of the vast destruction and indiscriminate death caused by nuclear weapons, and signify a commitment to peace.  For reasons that are still eluding me,  I did not find Nagasaki memorials as emotional as Hiroshima; I don't know why, as they were both equally tragic events that should never have happened. The museum itself covers the history of the event as a story, focusing on the attack and the history leading up to it. It also covers the history of nuclear weapons development. The museum displays photographs, relics, and documents related to the bombing.  A humbling and emotional place to visit to reflect on the horror of the nuclear bomb attacks in Japan."
216,Educational ,"An amazing place to visit but be warned its not for the faint hearted.  Lots of exhibits, stories, memorabilia to step back in time and relive the horrors of war.  It is hoped by all that we can learn from our past mistakes and for the sake of humanity, never use nuclear weapons again in the future."
217,Deeply moving,"I am reminded of Immanuel Kant after visiting the Museum. Or rather his words from the treatise ""Zum ewigen Frieden"" (""Perpetual Peace"") that we must carefully choose the means of warfare, remembering that peace will be tomorrow and present enemy become a partner. The question of the military necessity of atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the destruction of Dresden in 1945 is controversial. Put it mildly. To be honest, they are more like acts of intimidation. Terror against the civilian population. The authors of the Museum is carefully bypassed. The emphasis is on description, not explanation. We see how the bomb was prepared, what it is, what happened after, what damage, what suffering. But no way, why? What conclusion should we make after the visit? An atomic bomb is bad? This is obvious to children. At the bottom is an exhibition dedicated to nuclear weapons and the countries of the nuclear club (there are already 9). And oddly enough, you come to the conclusion that having nuclear weapons is the only way to avoid Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The logical conclusion after viewing the exposition without moral judgement. But after all the authors wanted another?"
218,interesting and sad,"Visiting the peace park and museum and its exhibits make for deeply moving experiences. The museum itself is quite an interesting modern building, particularly the upper part!"
219,Thought Provoking Displays,"I went with my wife and found this museum very thought provoking.  It is very different to the museum at Hirosjima.   The museum gave a detailed build up to the dropping of the A Bomb, with images of old Nagasaki.  There were images of the immediate aftermath and also various exhibits.The museum is well set out, and deals with the subject in a very subjective way.I would thoroughly recommend a visit if in Nagasaki."
220,Must visit in Nagasaki,"Perhaps I shouldn't compare, but as we visited this museum and Nagasaki after Hiroshima, I didn't find this as shocking or as interesting. I think the parks around the museum were of more interest to me than what was on display."
221,"Well presented, sobering look ","We did a two day tour (the other day was spent visiting Hashima - aka Battleship Island - which was also humbling but in a different way) of Nagasaki and the bomb museum and peace park nearby are both must-visits. The museum displays and commentary are fascinating and sobering. From facts about the compression waves of the bomb to the side effects on people to the debates by scientists about the use of atomic weapons, it’s a lot to take in without losing one’s appetite. And to think that this bomb was created more than 70 years ago. It also shows how, when the super powers and other nations start throwing their weight round by boasting about their nuclear arsenals, it’s time to get very very worried.Not to be missed and unforgettable..."
222,Sad History,"The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum is very well organized and detailed. They have a lot of good information and artifacts on display. When it comes down to it, this museum is a sad reminder of what occurred. It shows a lot of artifacts left over from the bombing and has stories of survivors and victims. I came out with a lot more knowledge then going in, it is unfortunate what happened here in Nagasaki. The entrance price was very cheap, just 200 Yen, and the museum is not to big, can easily be done in 1-2 hours. Afterwards, go to the hypocenter and Peace Park."
223,Nagasaki on 9th August 1945,"The Nagasaki Peace Museum was definitely worth the entry and the time to look around. There are lots of personal artefacts and plenty of signs in English. I went for the audio tour, which was well worth the 150Y. Allow about two hours."
224,Interesting comprehensive museum,"Very informative place, great place for world war historians. It has elevator access for the elderly."
225,A must do when in Nagasaki,"The people of Nagasaki should be proud of this amazing museum.  It was very balanced and well thought out, the whole purpose of the museum is so that this never happens again.  Hard to be there - be prepared to be emotional."
226,Must visit to comprehend the horror of a nuclear bomb dropped on innocent people.,I feel that this is very scary museum. Every body needs to go to be reminded of this tragedy. I feel that their should be a children’s section because we went with 3 children and they were horrified and had nightmares. That is horrible but they need to learn. In the children’s area they should have lots of things to touch. But overall is was a fun experience.
227,Worth Visiting for historical value,"Having been to the Hiroshima museum, the Nagasaki one was less empowering.9 August is a very sad day for the city.Interesting with the museum being packed with teenage school students, how the entry of Japan into WW2 is downplayed. If you do not fully know your history then lessons from the past will be forgotten. I gather that current Japan history books used in schools also have this slant."
228,A place to appreciate peace,I did enjoy reading through the history of Nagasaki history. Nagasaki was the first area of Japan to allow foreigners to start trading into the country.
229,"Difficult and sobering - but that is as it should be, for this Museum",The museum was just a short walk away from the nearest tram station. This museum was good as it portrayed the devastation caused by the 2nd Atomic bomb. I have been to the Hiroshima museum as well and this Nagasaki one was smaller but still just as educational.
230,Very sobering and enlightening place,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum  is organized  and give all the relevant information for the visitor. You will know the details and see the pictures.
231,Worth a visit,"Like Berlin and Hiroshima, Nagasaki is a difficult place to visit but important to do so. It is also smaller and less busy than Hiroshima and if we can't learn anything by seeing the overwhelming and bleak exhibits here, we won't learn from anything."
232,Difficult but important to visit,"I'm glad I went to see this Museum. It presents the history and tragic events very well, seriously and sensitvely. Like the Hiroshima museum, it is a difficult place to visit for anyone who cares about the awfully tragic bombing and destruction of so many lives of innocent people."
233,Haunting.,A very good memorial to the fallen. A lot of work went into this. With museum's and original buildings. Lots of pictures and artefact. A worth while visit.
234,Harrowing but necessary ,A must to visit when you are in Nagasaki !!! Nice architect building. A small fee for a nice museum to remind us a sad event on Earth. Nicely done up. Lot of items including part of a church are on display. Just follow the directional signs & you will enjoy the museum.There is also the ground zero of the bomb in the park outside where monuments of the events are erected.
235,The evil men do,"It is both an informative and educational visit for me. It brought me back to the past and to the historical sites where the atomic bomb lands. Through the accounts of the people, I truly felt the pain of losing your loved ones, family members and everything at that split seconds. Felt pretty uncomfortable reading the accounts of those who suffered during the war after sometime. Do come prepared with an open heart and mind to have a balanced view of the impact of war and leave with an determination to promote peace and harmony in your own country and world. I believe this should be the spirit of anyone who wants to visit this museum."
236,Well worth the trip,"This museum is very informative and terribly sad. We did a half day tour from a cruise ship, which covered the ground zero site, this museum and the peace park, so I don't know how much the tickets are. I think it's a museum that all should visit so nuclear weapons are never again used. I will never forget this place."
237,Still worth a visit,"Lest we forget the trauma and impact of our actions, how could we? It helps us understand the impact of our actions and inactions."
238,Excellent place to learn about a terrible event,Last year I visited Hiroshima and the Hiroshima peace museum a few times and each time I was very impressed by both the museum itself as well as the exhibits. Each time I left wondering why and how people can do these things to each other.In the case of Nagasaki I was less impressed. The museum of course is about a very similar event and tries to tell the same story as Hiroshima but somehow fails to bring the message home. Maybe because it misses the very compelling story of the girl that contracts leukemia and tries to survive folding 1000 paper cranes. That story really drives the message home and I missed it in Nagasaki. When visited the museum it was raining cats and dogs for 2 days in a row (our entire visit). Maybe that had something to do with it as well?
239,visit Nagasaki,"Kind of a must see, to get a feel of wartime history. We enjoyed a hike up the city's very steep slopes, where even cars (in some places) can't navigate. I love looking at the houses, and imagining the lifestyle of living on such slopes..."
240,"Peaceful, respectful and fascinating visit","The entrance to the museum is on hill that requires walking up stairs or taking an elevator on the side of the hill.  There is an entrance fee to the museum.  The museum is two levels.  The visitors are directed to follow a path in one direction. There is a gift shop and a place to buy a light meal near the entrance.  There are pictures, statues and exhibits from the area of the bomb explosion."
241,Great organized Museum,Heart saddening experience to see the horror of atomic bomb. I really hope 9th August 1945 is the last time for this horrific event and I pray for all the victims.
242,Worth to visit,"War is horrifying. If a reminder is needed, one should visit this place. You will see exhibits that recounted the horror of the nuclear bomb. But who started the war in the first place? It seems hypocritical for the aggressor totell the world that they were the victim. Well worth a visit whatever your opinion."
243,Informative,"We walked here from the port expecting to take half an hour, actually it took one hour twenty minutes Flat for most of the way but a short climb at the end. We had several conversations along the way with young Japanese people just to verify we were on the right path. The museum itself is quite moving with graphic pictures and displays, in fact we couldn't look at it all. You can spend quite a long time here if you see everything on display and there is a lot of written information.We did walk back to the port too."
244,first hand pictures/info of the bombings,This is a place everyone needs to visit to be reminded that we should never again wage nuclear war. The exhibits are clearly set out and English explanations and labels are extensive - unusual for Japan. There is also an audio guide in different languages. A very moving memorial to a terrible event.
245,Learning history and science,"This place tells us the history from the victims’ angle. After coming here, i am very upset with human mankind, especially towards the Americans. Why would somebody approved to build such devastating bombs that could inflict so much harm to human mankind. And how could the then President approve to release such bombs on innocent victims? The WW2 was ended when Enola Gay dropped the bomb on Hiroshima against the military there, but why Nagasaki when there were so many non-military and civilians? I just cannot understand but life has to move on....let this be history and a lesson for humanity.Come visit this museum and learn to know what actually happened here in 1945."
246,Visited Second,Very informative displays and photos. Highly recommend visiting this museum as it is well done although somewhat sobering.
247,Magnificent ,Visited the museum in a short trip to Japan to try and understand more of the history. We found the museum to be both solemn and very informative. Nothing was taken to excess and the information on the exhibits was easy to read. Price was well worth it. Arrived at opening time as we have found this the best time to visit many places. Caught a taxi from the hotel and walked back.
248,Wow just wow,"When I arrive the museum, colorful paper crane, which is prying for peace, caught my attention. To be honest, I don't believe those is delivered by volunteer but by those poor students who are demanded by hypocritical teachers.I mean, come on, the war ended more than half century ago. Why do people care?However, when I enter the showroom, when I saw the extremely tragic photos, documentary, and the detail explanation of how the atomic bomb destroyed the city , cooked human alive, toxic the agriculture - I cant help but keep questioning why do human brought wars to the world? I entered the museum with careless attitude but end up leaving with heavy heart. I wish I knew how to make a paper crane so that I can leave my wish in front of the monument that hoping no one, no country will ever have to experience this agony anymore."
249,Interesting and moving museum,"Well worth the visit.. sombre  and emotional, some confronting content but also great historical  information  You absolutely MUST visit this place for peace and reflection and education"
250,An informative presentation of exhibits,"We headed to Nagasaki with plans to visit the museum. Didn't expect my parents to love this place so much that we spent around three hours inside. It's not a big museum but it does hold a lot of artifacts and information. I appreciated the timeline near the exit of the museum. I guess we liked this this place because it didn't just focus on the bombing but EVERYTHING related to it. Downside, us Iphone users couldn't make the wifi work in this place."
251,"Very sobering experience, but tastefully done","We found this museum very interesting, although there was a lot to visitors it was not crowded . I was glad to see a few schools there of Japanese children, There was a small cafe there where we had a nice cup of coffee and cake."
252,A must see when in Nagasaki,Wouldn’t say you’ll enjoy the visit but you may feel that such museums are important if only to keep in mind the horrific injuries and suffering caused by atomic warfare.
253,"Confronting and ""must do"" ",The museum presented the information in an interesting and informative way. The token entry fee of Y200 does not commensurate with all the information that it presents. A must go!
254,The museum of truth,"Although a shocking time in history, we need to know about this.Hopefully a step closer to educating the world about peace and living harmoniously I learnt so much, and felt quite sad."
255,Sobering,"The wife, myself and our 10 month old flew from Naha Okinawa to Nagasaki City for a few days of our July 4th week. The kiddo took his first flight and did quite well. Besides the down pour of rain the first couple of days, we actually got out to see quite a few places. The main ones being the hypocenter where the second atomic bomb went off and the old Dutch settlements. The Atomic Bomb museum was pretty informational and had some old pieces to show of when this thing went off. A Bunch of glass rosaries fused together during the blast along with other items like it. If you can do without seeing those items and just want to see the hypocenter where the actual bomb went off, then don’t waste time at the museum. The hypocenter site itself has plaques and signs with enough info on them that you don’t really need the museum. Just saying...if you are pressed for time. Buuuut, if you have a little time, go check out some of the artifacts.The first two pics are some of those artifacts. The pic of the clock of when the bomb went off was the actual time it stopped during the blast and the second is the melted rosaries I mentioned above."
256,Less impressive than Hiroshima ,"we walked in and around the museum and visit ground zero. it was interesting but also sad and scary at the same time to see the aftermath of the destruction and sufferings of the people affected by the bombings. we thought this would be a quick tour, but they had explanations in english, so we ended up going through all the exhibits in 2 hours."
257,"Awesome for adults, too solemn for children","As a first time visitor to Japan, I wanted to experience as much as I could which, of course, has to include learning about the dropping of atomic bombs in Japan.The Museum has done a great job of producing a chronological history of the lead-up to the Nagasaki bombing. It might be confronting or harrowing for some to visit, but it’s a chapter of history that illuminates the human tragedy of war."
258,Well planned displays,"Coming to this place will make you learn a lot of things about what happens at 'that time'. Not only in Japanese, English translation also available. I am not sure the story version is the version from Japanese Gov or from both Country. Not only the museum, you also can enjoy the ground zero park also. This museum is very well made and very informative"
259,Impressive,"Since this museum is the top ""must see"" in Hiroshima, it was very crowded in the morning because a cruise ship was in port.  There are many interactive displays, short films and English descriptions throughout the museum.  On display is a mock up of the ""Fat Man"" bomb, remains of household items damaged by the bomb, photos of ""shadows"" which are images of where people were decimated, stories told by survivors, and much more.The small book shop sells keychains containing tiny paper cranes (approx. 1/4 of an inch tall) encased in a plastic/lucite cube for less than 500 yen which is a nice and hopeful reminder of the museum's message of Peace."
260,Great but overwhelming experience,"Nagasaki atomic bomb museum is a must-see place whether you like visiting museums or not. It's accessible from the tram line, and it's a few stops north of the main train station. There are signposts to follow from the tram station, and you can probably spend a few hours here.Firstly, the information provided (in English and Japanese) is extensive, varied and deep. Sources are quoted, and there are a wide variety of displays, from photos to the twisted remains of structures. There are also quite a wide number of viewpoints of the bombing. Korean and western prisoners of war, school children, soldiers, doctors, and those making the big decisions all have a voice. I even found a video about the war in Manchuria, including information about Japanese atrocities there. Secondly, the exhibitions flow so well to create a story.The displays are clearly designed to be emotive, and it's hard to leave the place without feeling something. I think this is a great example of how to engage an audience, and I can think of some museums around the world that could learn from this.  Finally, a surprising thing for me was that the final exhibition display in the main museum had been updated a mere two days before we visited! The curators here are clearly working hard. Final word: Is it fun? No of course not, it's about a nuclear bomb being dropped on civilians. It is interesting, emotionally charged, visually stimulating, thought provoking and well worth a visit? Yes."
261,Too Bad Everyone Can't See This,"We visited and we were sad to see, read and hear what has happened to this beautiful city of Japan.  Although sad we were glad we visited.  I can recommend you visit here."
262,must see,"More subdued than the Hiroshima Peace Park and less spread out, the Museum provides a place to reflect. The walk through exhibit shows the devastation caused and the lookout on top allows you to see how the area was rebuilt. Surprising to see one of the schools then is still being used as a school now. Be prepared for the graphic material present."
263,Grim.   ,"I visited on a very warm day and was wearing shorts and t-shirt. Inside, the air conditioning was very strong and I found myself shivering, so perhaps take an extra layer. You have to pay extra for an audio guide, but there is sufficient English text in the descriptive boards. There is a coffee shop on site, but only for drinks and limited selection of cake."
264,Haunting!,"After visiting Hiroshima previously, we thought we should visit Nagasaki.  I'm glad we did.  The museum and the impact area are moving.  Hopefully there will be no more Atomic Bomb museums to visit."
265,Must See,It was nice to see a historic place but at the same time heart was heavy imagining the incident which happened during the war.
266,A surreal and heartfelt experience,It’s very sad to visit here but it is an important part of world history . The museum is tastefully put together with many pictures and artifacts. From here it’s a short walk to the Peace Memorial . I would highly recommend the audio sets which they rent . The museum is a short walk from the tram line . This museum is not as large as Hiroshima but it is very poignant.
267,Soak it all in,This museum is informative and emotive. It always leaves me with a sense of deep thought and reshape my view on nuclear age and humanity.
268,Every child should visit,Main attraction and easily accessible by tram or coaches.  A good way to see and understand historically happenings in Nagasaki and impact of nuclear bomb in 1945. Great range of exhibit to view
269,A Japanese perspective,Having visited the Hiroshima memorial my husband and I wanted to give the same respect to the people of Nagasaki. Of the two memorials Nagasaki was the stand out for us. Well done English translations for all the exhibits and a better layout without the huge crowds. A pleasant two hour trip from Hakata with nice scenery along the way
270,Don't overlook this museum,This is a fascinating museum as it shows the war from the Japanese side.  There are plenty of interesting artefacts on display along with video footage.  If visiting it is a must see museum.
271,A Sombre Reflection,"We reached this museum by city tram from the Nagasaki train station.  There was an uphill walk about 10 min from the tram station to the museum.  Entrance fee is 200yen for adults, well worth it.  We paid 150yen for an English audio guide.  The English signage is pretty good  too.  The museum gives a good portrayal of the city of Nagasaki leading up to the war and why the US chose it as a target.  The most dramatic part is the time the bomb was dropped and the horrific aftermath of the suffering and death of those affected.  There is no blaming or negativity, just an informative look at history and the effect of using such a weapon and why we should never use it again.  There is a gift shop and Victims Peace Memorial worth visiting at the museum.  Make sure to go to the city overlook next to the museum to see how the city looks rebuilt.  We spent at least 2 hrs here."
272,This will change your life,This was a very harrowing visit but the museum is very well done and we are really pleased we visited Nagasaki as well as Hiroshima. There are lots of good exhibits. The video testimonies were very moving. It was really interesting to watch the Australian POW video testimonies as well for a different perspective. We had a great cup of lemon tea in the cafe afterwards which was well needed
273,Moving Memorial to the Second (and hopefully last Atomic Bomb dropped on City)...,The museum is extremely well presented (given the subject) with information well set out and well presented. Information is provided in English and easy to understand.We were fortunate to observe a picture show reading when we visited which was a bonus.Suggest a good couple of hours is required to take everything in.
274,NAGASAKI ATOMIC BOMB MUSEUM,"I am not sure what I expected, but the museum fell short. It is of course a very disturbing event to memorialize. I was missing the the big clear message and cohesive path. It felt a bit disjointed and I think it could have been executed better. Having said that, I still recommend going because it is a traumatic event that every man, woman and child should learn about it."
275,Educational and Confronting,"As an American, visiting this museum was difficult. Although no one in my family tree has participated in WW2, it was an experience for pure historical purposes. It’s a must visit for anyone to understand the devastation one of these mass destruction weapons can do, and to see first hand the remnants of the devastation takes your breath away. The cost is less than $2.00 US and can be visited by traveling on the local team."
276,A must,It’s an amazing experience and everyone around the world should see this place. It can open your eyes to what was really lost
277,Sobering,We made a special effort to visit this museum as it is a reminder to all mankind what a devastating world we would have if someone was to be so stupid to ignite another. If children of the world were made to see the horrors they may get together and ban them when they are of an age to do so. That is the effect that this had on us. It was factual without recriminations and it is more about peace than war. I would urge visitors to Nagasaki to spend a little of your time here.
278,A must for everyone visiting Nagasaki,"This was our second visit of this museum and we were as impressed as we were the first time ! The presentations are very explicit , the pictures are quite clear and even if this is a very sad topic , one senses that the message conveyed is not one of hate nor acrimony  but one of peace and hope . The museum was full of tourists , students and Japanese citizens and yet it was very quiet !"
279,Nagasaki after Hiroshima ,"The museum was historical and educational. Having visited Hiroshima in March, I wanted to pay my respects here, too. I spent about four hours here  as I like to take most everything in. The spacious museum flowed very well, no bottlenecking of visitors. I recommend visiting both peace museums as they're the same and different."
280,"informative, moving, perhaps the best Atomic Bomb related site","In the two or three hours I spent at this museum I think I learnt more than at any other time. It gives valuable insights into human nature as well as providing an account of the tragic events in August 1945 and the subsequent proliferation of nuclear technology as well as the efforts to contain the destructive aspects of that science. This is, in my opinion, the most vital place to visit in Japan."
281,Excellent and moving,The museum is easy to travel to within the city. A 15 minutes walk from the tram stop. Plenty of artefacts to remind us the horrors of wars and importance of peace.
282,Make a point to visit ,"I look forward to visiting this museum because I genuinely wanted to learn more about the history of the incident. I am happy and glad to be able to visit such an excellent museum. It's solemn but appropriate, interesting but relevantly educational. What had happened was a tragic event, but I appreciate the museum for the informative display and stories."
283,Informative,It is a smaller version of Hiroshima atomic bomb museum. It is more modern version. Entry fee is very low. They can charge more as this is a very important historical place and record to be preserved and it's story should be told to many many generations to come. Any war weapon should be abolished eventually starting with nuclear arsenals.
284,A must visit place in Nagasaki ,"Interesting museum also the Hiroshima ones has a greater impact on the public. Reachable by tram, near you have other park"
285,Excellent interpretation and display,We made the day trip from Fukuoka to Nagasaki in 2 hours on the JR train.  Next to the Peace Park is the Atomic Bomb Museum.  The museum has a small fee of 200 yen per person for entry.  We also went to Hiroshima on a separate day and it is definitely a sobering visit.
286,Must see ,We learnt a lot what this destruction did not only to people of Urakami but entire world. We pray nothing like this will ever happen again
287,"visit for the artefacts, not for the history lesson","I spent a couple of hours here absorbing the information and looking at the exhibits, some of which are very graphic. The day before I left the city I went back to use the library there, there are many books in English and also a video room for those who want to learn even more. There were lots of school children when I went. The staff were very helpful. The location is also very good, near the hypocenter park and peace park."
288,"Very interesting, but a sad chapter in history","I was not sure I would be able to handle the sadness of the facts but I am so glad we went - well laid out and informative, you don't have to read all the sad details - my husband could have spent all day there"
289,Emotional place,"Although I’ve lived in Japan for several years in the past (more than six years), I never had a chance to go to Nagasaki to see the museum, although I’ve been to Hiroshima several times. On a recent onsen trip to the Eastern part of Nagasaki Prefecture, my wife and I first spent a few days in Nagasaki City. It was then that I finally had an opportunity to visit the Peace Museum. It is, without a doubt, a sobering and emotional place that will take you through the days, months, and years following the dropping of the bomb. The facility is filled with interesting artifacts that will have you wondering how any humans could have survived such an ordeal. Indeed, some of the chronicled stories of those that did somehow survive will bring tears to your eyes. When you see and hear their stories you will then believe that often said statement that ‘the lucky ones died that day’. There are a multitude of reasons which supposedly support the dropping of both bombs. However, when you see the devastation,  and the impacts that the bombs had even decades later…you cannot help but question the decision, and religious or not, you may very well find yourself praying that this never happens again.  There is one section which focuses on the years leading up to the dropping of the bombs. It highlights Japan’s actions (aggressions), in the Asian region. There is a tremendous amount of misinformation given, or more accurately, an abundance of historical facts which are left out (as is also the case at the Hiroshima museum), or tremendously downplayed. If you are a war history buff you will indeed notice it, especially if you can read and understand Japanese. Although not as grossly inaccurate as Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, it nonetheless speaks to Japan’s legendary ‘denial’ issues. But that is a socio-political discussion better left for another day,  As a first time visitor to The Museum, I thought it was a well thought-out and designed facility with ample space to see all of the displays without crowding. We spent, literally, an entire afternoon there, but my wife (who is Japanese), and I (a native New Yorker)spent much time discussing historical points as we viewed the exhibits.  I do think it is somewhat smaller than Hiroshima’s museum. The associated Halls, event spaces, and archival library, however are all very nice. Really well done in a way which encourages contemplation and peace of mind. I think that Nagasaki is typically something of an afterthought for most foreigners traveling to Japan. When friends or coworkers here in NYC talk to me about their potential destinations in Japan, Nagasaki is hardly ever mentioned. Of the two ‘atomic cities’ Hiroshima gets the overwhelming majority of the attention. I think this is primarily due to the perception that Nagasaki is more difficult to get to or out of the way, which is not at all the case. It is readily accessible by multiple rail routes, and is a wonderful little city that is very easy to navigate. The museum is up a very steep road however, which can be challenging to anyone with mobility issues. If so, a taxi may be in order.  In closing, in my opinion, if one is visiting Japan they should try hard to visit either Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Just as Japanese people visiting Hawaii should see the Pearl Harbor Historical Sites. Given a choice between the Hiroshima and Nagasaki museums, I actually prefer Nagasaki, as it is much less crowded. But, I can understand someone heading to Hiroshima to see the Dome in addition to its Museum. The artifacts are largely the same at both locations; clothing worn by people at the time of the blast; metal, stone, and other items melted by the intense heat; household items which somehow survived, etc.. The individual stories at each location however, are quite different and riveting. Visiting Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum was a sobering experience to be sure, and a stark reminder of how close the world currently is to repeating such a horrific act. It is something you really need to see. I’m so glad I went. Hope this review helps"
290,Museum,"One of the most moving museum experiences. The museum does a really good job of capturing the past, current, and future repercussions of the bombing.I enjoyed the sense of peace at the same time with all of the paper cranes and the very serene, clean, minimal atmosphere."
291,"very good information, also from scientific point of view","This museum has a few floors that tell what happened in Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. The exhibits show the town before the bomb and then the affects of the bomb. It is moving but can be too much for some people."
292,I was unsure but glad I went,"A friend and I visited this moving museum on a weekday morning in early October. We had come to see how Nagasaki portrayed the effects of the Aug. 9, 1945, atomic bomb drop on the city. The curators have chosen to tell a story, presenting Nagasaki before the bomb fell; immediately after the explosion; and today.  They weave explanations of historical details within the story and show what happened through photos, videos, artifacts and much more. The conclusion focuses on the need for peace and the end of nuclear weapons, made abundantly clear by the bomb's destruction of the city and the killing of at least 74,000 people. Those, who survived, would often have to endure physical ailments from the radiation and psychological trauma.    As soon as I entered the exhibition hall, I felt  uneasy, looking at a giant black-and- white photo of Nagasaki as it appeared before the bomb fell. That's because I knew what would be ahead for the thriving city. A recovered wall clock frozen at 11:02 a.m. soon appeared, marking the exact time that the horrors began. Displays feature English descriptions and include photos of the atomic wasteland that Nagasaki became, along with stories of that fateful day from survivors, including heroic rescue work. Artifacts damaged from the flash of heat range from  a 14-year-old girl's lunch box with rice charred from the fire to six green glass bottles melted at the top and stuck together, which were found in a store's ruins. A helmet with the remains of a skull inside is one of the more grisly items. I found information on the bomb itself to be especially interesting. A life-size model of the one used on Nagasaki is displayed and called ""Fat Man,"" because of its appearance. A video shows the military loading Fat Man and transporting it to the plane for the mission. There is also a photo taken from the plane that shows the mushroom cloud rising into the sky after the blast.We went through the relatively small museum in about 1 hour. It cost 200 Y (about $1.89 U.S.) to enter. A corridor leads from the museum to the adjacent Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims. There is no fee to enter the Memorial Hall. Both are located near ground zero for the blast and the Nagasaki Peace Park. To reach the museum, we took the blue line to the Matsuyamamachi tram stop and then walked for about 4 minutes."
293,Wow. Just wow.,I first visited the museum 30 years ago.  Since then it has obviously changed for for the better giving much more information and fantastic relics from the past and even more recent information about the atomic age.A must see in Nagasaki.
294,Rather depressing but a good reminder,"I went there and this place made me feel really sad about Nagasaki people after second war, i also really respect their power . many things touch my heart."
295,You must visit if you are in Nagasaki.,You've got to visit the Museum if you're in town. Most of the displays and movies are also in English.  You can purchase the audio guide in various languages at the front desk if you'd like do so.   It's a bargain to get in(200 yen).
296,Very good place to learn about atomic history.,"We travelled across town to visit this museum. My wife wasn't too sure she wanted ro go, but we decided we should. In the end, we were glad we visited.Unlike Hiroshima, Nagasaki was an interesting place before it was bombed, so it is possible to visit the city without coming to the A-Bomb Museum. Last time I was, it was a rather rickety display on the second floor of a former school house. Now it is in a splendidly appropriate purpose-built building, with carefully designed exhibits, pointing up the horrors of atomic bombing and, in the final exhibition area, the ongoing danger posed by nuclear arsenals.There were not many people around, so the atmosphere was pretty still and quiet. We wandered at will through the horrific exhibits, with ample opportunities to record our impressions. In all, we spent about 90 minutes there, and were pretty glad to emerge into the spring air."
297,Absolultey must visit!!!,"I grew up doing duck and cover drills in school.  I've wanted to come to this spot since I was 15 and read about the bomb.  This is a surprisingly non-political presentation.  It does show Pearl Harbor although it doesn't show a direct link.  It does share Truman saying the bomb was dropped to save hundreds of thousands of US soldiers. It described the militarism more Japan in a very dark light.  Sober Museum.  I heard no one speaking.  Just moving quietly from exhibit to exhibit.  Profound for me , other than the pictures of corpses was the pieces of school yard and pictures of destroyed school ranging from pre-school to young teens."
298,"Wonderful history museum, slightly skewed presentation","There is a fee of ¥200. I would recommend to visit this museum to learn more about history of Nagasaki. It is also relacing inside, there is a library and a place where you can stay and wtite your thoughts about the museum and an observatpry at the top."
299,significant museum in Nagasaki,It was eye opening .................really. one had to remember the history behind it. I was in awe and saddened at the same time
