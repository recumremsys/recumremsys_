0,"architecture is beautiful , but too crowded to experience the heritage",It was way too crowded to experience the heritage. this could have been manged properly by the  management. 
1,Time well spent,"This is historical place, but did not attract us much. Maintenance is not upto the mark. This is one time watch."
2,Folk dance,"This would have been a beautiful home but like so many, it has been let go. Now it is being refurbished but in my opinion they would do better to turn it into a beautiful boutique hotel."
3,Could not watch anything,It's a lovely haveli although i have seen better ones. The cultural programme is lovely. They fill up the place to the brim and in summers it becomes difficult to sit tightly packed for an hour or so.
4,Traditional Folk dance,Arrive early to get in and to find a decent seat - it gets very busy. This is a fine showcase of Rajastani culture. The commentator is good and the performers are skilled and enthusiastic. The show closes with a lovely 73 year old lady dancing with ever greater numbers of pots…
5,Top priority in Udaipur tour,"There is not much to explore in the museum. There were no guides when we went to heritage either, so we couldn't learn much about the culture or history. It's close to City Palace, so you can pay it a visit if you have time in hand but not a necessary visit. Hope this helped."
6,Interesting history,Read the reviews and thought I'd go along as its in the centre of town. Got there for the show (7-8pm) around 620pm which was good guidance as it was already very busy. Got a seat down the front and waited for the show.. I paid for the use of my camera phone as I'd read that…
7,Must Visit,The show is worth a visit - good light entertainment with some laughs too. It’s a regular performance which is often sold out so go early to ensure you get a seat.
8,Over hyped show,This is worth a look see just for the building alone it is still being restored in places but it is a wonderful place to see what some of the buildings looked like prior to being rescued.  The turban display is actually very educational this is a language all of its own &…
9,Cultural Show,Despite other bad reviews we visited the traditional show and we thought it was great. Very entertaining. It gets very busy so get there at least an half an hour before. Apparently the main lady has been 72 years old for a quite a few years but who cares she is super skilled. 
10,Dharohar dance ,We did not visit the museum but we attended a FANTASTIC evening cultural show. The show includes enormous information about the Rajasthani culture and presents the folk dance of all the regions of Rajasthan. The performance by artists were mindblowing.  Things to remember :  1.…
11,Glimpse of Rangeela Rajasthan through cultural show,"Went to see the dance show here, and it was amazing, really great value for money. The dancing was great, the stories behind each were explained (in English and Hindi) and even included some puppets. We bought our tickets online, and good job we did as when we arrived at 18:15…"
12,There are better places to visit,This is a  heritage Haveli as usual and inside renovation work is continue to make it attractive. You can see or skip it but there is spacial cultural show from 7 PM to 8 pm where artist perform traditional dance and Puppet Show. If you are in Udaipur you never miss it as worth…
13,Dharohar folk dance ,"Hi.  There is not much to see in the monuments just a arms museum, but cherry on cake is the folk art show priced at 90 rs per person .  Its shows traditional rajasthani folk dance with puppet show and star attraction is dance with 11 pots of head performed by 72 years old Lady…"
14,Evening cultural dance and puppet show,"We were very keen to catch the cultural show here and queued up very well in advance to score the tickets. People start flicking around an hour before the show and you should also try to get here soon as the tickets and the seating are available on first come, first serve basis.…"
15,Must see the folk dance show,A great show with a display of great talent. The place is nice and authentic though there is no AC so can be hot in summer. It didn't bother us though a it was a nice atmosphere/environment for the show. The dancers are very talented and the music is good. The seating is such…
16,The dance show was fantastic!,"It was a royal residence before but now Museum. There is a hall dedicated to puppets. It's beautiful. entire place will take max of 1 hr to visit.   There is a local cultural show that happens in the evening 7 pm, 90 rs ticket which will take your breath away. There are 4 shows,…"
17,Go for traditional show,"We went in with the assumption that this will be another of those boring ""musical fountain"" equivalents. But, we were proved so wrong, the show is fantastic and should not be missed at any cost. The traditional performances, music, compering (both in Hindi & English) make it a…"
18,Restored Haveli,"Didn't get back to tour the museum itself.  But we were able to see the wonderful dance show on a Saturday night!  Tried to buy tickets early in the day, but box office didn't open until something like 6:15 before the 7:00 pm show!  We didn't expect the huge crush that there…"
19,Beautiful Haweli,We only visited the museum during the day and did not go to the evening show (which other reviewers rate highly).All credit for the restoration which has been undertaken to this building but I was left disappointed. More information around the displays or better still an audio guide would have made the visit better. The wedding display was good and a good way to learn about the various rituals that form part of a hindu wedding. Would I visit the museum again? No; Would I recommend it? Only if you have spare time.
20,Really promoting our heritage ,"Nice museum showing some of the rooms in which the royalty used to live. It is great to see how the Mewars passed their time, the decoration of the house, the display of their items...  Also it was fun to try one of the turbans as they use in Rajasthan 👳"
21,Nothing great,Can’t fault the show as such. Traditional and with prelude descriptions of every dance. That said it wasn’t particularly entertaining except for the 74year old lady who you have to take your hat off to for her stacked pots act.  Bit of ‘camera’ police where you have to pay extra…
22,Ok,The visit experience at this haveli was great... It is a haveli converted into a museum with a lot of cultural richness... highly recommended for a visit
23,Do not miss the culture show,"The museum this haveli hauses does provide visitors  a quick glance of Rajasthani culture.  But the display, the explanation, the direction-line and even the custodial are far away from the caliber of a world class museum.  Having said that, the architecture of this haveli by itself is worth a visit.  It is a drastic change from the bustling old city outside during my visit as the first visitor on that morning.  Get your camera ready.   You can take many beautiful shots in the many courtyards and toward the lake."
24,Ok,This one is recommended for sure. We liked the dance enactments and the puppet show in the evening. The couple who manages it are doing a great job. One of the dancers almost 72 yrs old is highly appreciable.
25,The Cultural Program is a Must See,We went to see the folk dance here after hearing about it from several people. It is good value for money and you get to see some interesting styles of rajasthani dance. There are two people that provide the narrative in hindi and english. We bought our tickets after queuing for 30mins but you can book online for quicker entry. We had a good evening overall! …
26,Nice,"We got bit late to watch the show, and was worried if show was really worth ,  But I assure you it's a must visit when you are in udaipur, lovely cultural show and you get to know about rich culture of Udaipur(Rajasthan). It is advisable to reach on time and occupy front seat so…"
27,Excellent,"This is a typical residence of the minor nobility of Rajasthan, which has been converted into a museum.  What is not to be missed is the evening programme of traditional dance and puppetry.  The show lasts a little over an hour and is very popular, with a limit of about 200…"
28,Bagore ki Haveli,This place has lots of formalities but the place is cool. Very good architecture. Price was reasonable.
29,Nice rajastani musuem,This is good as you get to experience local folk dance plus lovely puppet show..but the standing in a queue is little bit more while you are with kids or old aged it gets uncomfortable..
30,Nice evening show with traditional dances,This is a old haveli where kids adopted into the royal family were imparted training. It runs a very good folk dance programme in the evening. You will have to reach well before the show time to get your ticket.
31,Good dancing,"The dancing show was fabulous, loved every bit of it. Does get very busy so best to arrive early, they are very good at squeezing people in. We were lucky getting good seats, imagine if we had sat on ground in middle of the audience it would get quite hard on the knees, older…"
32,Must see the folk dance in the evening,Mewar people still live here and use this haveli to stay. People live here with their old comforts and their old tradition style
33,Evening Cultural Show well worth it,"We went there to watch the show (dance and acts). The ticket costed Inrs 90 (for locals) and 150 (for foreigners); the show was 45 mins long. It comprised rajasthani folk dances, acts and songs reflecting local culture and traditions. The combination of colourful costumes, Folk…"
34,Lovely experience of dharovar folk dance show,"This was a beautiful building, pleasingly empty of tourists in an otherwise busy town.  It offers good views over the lake and shows you what merchnts houses used to look like.  Well worth a visit"
35,Book early. Skip the queue,"We went to see the Haveli for it,s Rajputana Culture & Heritage but what took us for a big surprise , was the presence of quite a few Freelance Artists , camping in the Haveli premises & drawing beautiful visuals of this heritage Haveli . We stood there calmly for quite some…"
36,Nice,"The access to place is difficult but the folk dance program presented today was extraordinary. The dancers are authentic and exceptional, their energy level are contagious and performance is mind boggling! Definitely worth a visit 👍"
37,Baghore ki haveli: a confluence of Rajasthan folk lore,Approach is bad through a waterlogged entrance... have to wait in a long winding queue for the tickets a very slow and painful process and again in a long queue to enter the show because there are no ticket numbers . Finally is the whole effort worth it ...a big no ... total…
38,Dance show at bagore ki haveli,"In my view its a must visit place. All the performances are amazing. Kids really enjoy the puppet show. For a good viewing angle, one must try to be there atleast 30mins before the show starts (currently it starts at 7:00pm). Ticket counter gets open at 6:15pm. Now they have…"
39,Average point,I went to the evening show and it was absolutely brilliant and unlike anything i've ever seen before. The atmosphere was wonderful and it was great to experience another culture's entertainment and heritage. My favourite part was the puppet show and the when the ladies danced…
40,Great show but pathetic entrance inside the premises,Absolutely loved this haveli. There is a good museum too inside. The evening folk dance show here is a must. Highly recommended spot. 
41,Pretty nice,"The Bagore Ki Haveli is a former townhouse and royal residence that is now a museum focused on Rajasthani culture. A few of the rooms have been restored as they would’ve been used by the royals of Merwar with information about the rooms, functions and activities. Some of the…"
42,"The museum is diverting, interesting and a little bit different.","We went for the Rajasthani cultural dance.. it was fantastic.Pricing - reasonableCamera - cheap .. only INR100 I thinkShow duration - 1 hourShow content - music, dance, puppet dance, pot dance.."
43,Excellent cultural evening show,Good place. Do watch the folk dance conducted every evening at 7pm. The museum is overpriced but worth watching
44,Lovely,The bagore ki haveli is like a museum. One room is specifically for the puppets made of the rajas and the other persons. There is also a place in this haveli which shows how marriages were organized at that time. Darohar is the name of the show which is organised every evening…
45,Good show but tickets are hard to get,We loved this show set in an old Haveli courtyard. The dancing and costumes were beautiful and the puppetry was highly entertaining. The hour went really quickly. This is a must see for people of any age visiting in Udaipur. Foreigner tourists pay just 150RPS for entry but must…
46,Good collection.......But seems repetitive!,Went with little expectations - 150Rs entrance for the dance show. Absolutely loved it - won’t spoil what happens but would highly recommend - a must do in Udaipur! 
47,Personalised Rajasthan Tour,The evening folk show is really a colourful spectacle. And a good piece of showmanship. Highly recommend going.
48,Hidden gem,"The Dance show is good one but i felt it could be more entertaining and Vibrant.I recommend you should your camera / mobile aside to enjoy the graceful dance.The beauty of the moment is to be experienced, its lost if your behind the camera.Reach by 6:30 show start at 7, no need to worry if you get back seat, its a small setup, every body gets close view."
49,Folk dance,Some of the performances are good but the rest are okay. You need to book the ticket on advance else it gets too crowded at the counter n you may not get tickets. But its not worth the hype
50,Amazing,Good architecture and an exciting history. The guide is a must to understand the importance and relevance and other fine details
51,A restored haveli - now a museum,"We rather enjoyed the traditional show which is hosted daily 7 to 8 pm, the artist were so amazing that we enjoyed every bit of the show, the price for entry to watch the show was INR 90 per head for domestic traveller. Overall I would recommend if they are in Udaipur and nearby City Palace then even they must visit this show to have a mesmerizing evening."
52,Good place for sunset,Many people. A few dances. Traditional dresses. Nice puppets. Ok. You must arrive early to buy and get a good seat. 
53,Awesome dance show,We went in the evening to the Cultural Show and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our guide got us in there early and got us really good seats. It gets packed so best to arrive in good time. The show was really colourful and entertaining and the lady that danced with lots of pots on her…
54,Crowded in the evening,visited this place in the evening..found it more live and beautiful ..they also have lighting around the place ..which make it look more beautiful... Inside bagore ki haveli is dharohar dance programm..will write its review separately...This Gangaur ghat is beautiful in the…
55,Dharohar Flok Dance Show at Bagor ki Haveli is awesome,"Enjoyed our short visit, especially the (life-sized) displays with traditional wedding sceneries. Also enjoyed some of the views on to the lake from upstairs, where we also found a number of people selling various (home-made) crafts / gifts."
56,Why you should NOT miss this Rajasthani Cultural hub!,"The visit was quite short to the place. It was old haveli converted to Museum and art performance. Evening art was missed but the museum is worth a visit. The terrace shows wonderful view of Pichhola lake and I like the most is puppet museum. Do take your camera with you, you…"
57,The performance is very good ,Excellent dance show and a museum which is good value for money. Line up early to get the tickets otherwise you may have to go to the 2nd showing. Line up early to enter for best seats.
58,beautifully restored Haveli,A small museum in a restored haveli  Features a museum of puppets and also the worlds largest turban  It’s good that the old building is being kept alive 
59,Haveli is a must visit,"A lovely aristocratic house of the once prime minister who served the Udaipur royalty, the house is now a museum worth a visit. The puppet room is fantastic and so is the view from the terrace overlooking lake pichola. In the evenings, folk dances take place in the courtyard…"
60,Amazing place!,Just a short walk from the Palace this Temple has some intricate carvings. Small by Indian standards but still an interesting site to visit.  Steep steps up from the street means access is somewhat restricted.
61,Disappointing Visit,"Located on the sides of Lake Pichola,it's an Museum with lots of ancient things like clothes, weapons, utensils etc. Can be covered in 30 mins. The place is partly under renovation."
62,Very awesome show.,I'm writing this for the artists..specially the 72 yes old woman who performed some ofthe folk dances from different parts of rajasthan..don't miss the opportunity to witness the rich cultural heritage of our country..but was disappointed by the staff who were rude..had reserved…
63,Must visit place in Udaipur,"Beautiful Rasjadthani dance and music. so colourful and amazing to watch, something not to be missed in Udaipur. The little lady in photo will surely surpriseyou with her skills and balance."
64,Beautiful local culture.,"A must watch for people who love to see the original culture of dance of Rajasthan,the performance by the dancers is amazing and very entertaining and they are so talented .. do visit"
65,Rajasthani culture show,"Excellent show in the evening  Also very nice haveli , well maintained and preserved. Happy to come again"
66,Nice place,"We are from Rajasthan and has seen many folk performances still this was very good. Small and cosy ambience, good comparing and crisp show. Must visit for 1 st timers. A 72 yr old woman perform multiple dances. Other young woman also very good. Singer is average."
67,An evening to cherish forever ,"Inside the museum, there should be a proper sitting arrangement. Difficult to sit for whole 1 hour without proper seats. "
68,Amazing folk experience,Very quirky house located right on the lake with interesting exhibits including a creepy doll room. Seemed queit when I visited during the daytime much more relaxed than the city palace 
69,An amazing place to witness culture and Art,"We were in two minds to go to this show after similar experiences in other countries, but this is not to be missed! We attended the cultural show on our last day in Udaipur and it was such fun! We’ve heard the show is sold out every night, and you can see why. The locals get…"
70,Must visit if you love tradition,This place is a must visit if you're a fan of cultural performances and in knowing the history of a place in the most entertaining way. It's surely one of the top most places you should visit.
71,Average Museum,"Entrance / gifts etc quite reasonably priced compared to everywhere else. Only a short visit but nice to see, especially the puppets and a great view from the roof. "
72,Great experience,"The museum is quiet and totally unvisited...  I know so  much more about turbans now.  The living quarters of a noble family in a restored palace. When you visit in the day buy your ticket for the evening performance of gorgeous Rajasthani dance,  music, puppetry and then at…"
73,Just waste your time ,This is a must watch on a visit to Udaipur. Mesmerizing performances by artists. The  show was so good that even my 3 year old kids enjoyed
74,Beautiful cultural heritage,"The evening show is a Fire and Safety Hazard - visit at your own peril.  Bagore Ki Haveli is a museum located in an 18th century building on the bank of Lake Pichola in Udaipur. It's multiple halls contain art, artifacts, and everyday articles from the lives of the Rajput…"
75,Evening show is a must visit!,"I really enjoyed the display of Rajasthani culture and dancing offered at Bagore Ji Haveli. With descriptions in both Hindi and English, visitors from far and wide could enjoy the experience.  The dancing was especially impressive!  I was not (due to personal reasons) a fan of…"
76,"Nice architecture, interesting displays","We went to this haveli for the evening show. Show starts at 7pm, but tickets are sold starting 615 pm only.no advance booking. We reached early, and had to wait 45 min before we got tickets. The show is in open area with seating for about 300 people. Overall show is very rajasthani and everyone in crowd enjoyed the show. The show stopper is a 72 year old lady, who does the final performance. Excellent show. I did not visit the haveli though."
77,Tired looking,"Jan 1: We were here for the show a week back and this time, we came to visit the museum. This is infact a haveli that has been restored and converted into a museum. The hard work shows - whether it is the katputlis, paintings, glass work, art work. They have a huge collection of…"
78,Amateur Folk drama in a dilapidated ruin,We went there in a group with kids and senior family members and enjoyed the dance show in the evening.  It was wonderful experience to see various type of folk dances of Rajasthan..  I am writing this review as a token of appreciation for the performers who put Thier heart and…
79,Super Experience,We got tickets for the cultural show and it was one of my favorite things to see in Udaipur! The traditional dancing and costumes where amazing! Buy your tickets the night before the show so you can get in early and secure a seat! It fills up fast! This Haveli is also a great…
80,Beautiful Heritage. ,"A tour of this ‘haveli’ can be divided into two parts – the museum and the cultural show in the evening.   We did the museum first, which opens at 10.00AM. When we reached there at around 10.15AM, neither the person attending the ticket counter (tickets cost Rs. 55.00 per head),…"
81,Wonderful folk dance and puppet show.,One of my favorite places in town ! Just stepped in for a show before your Dinner and make a complete evening of the trip!!! Enjoy very much.Tqvm
82,Bagore ki Haveli is a lovely place to hang out,"We missed the museum due to lack of time but we managed to attend Dharohar, a cultural folk dance show. Thank God we don't miss it.   The show is performed at open air within the haveli and is like a homely private show where people enjoy it in close proximity where there is no…"
83,Worth the visit!!,We really enjoyed the evening show here. It includes rajasthani folk dance performances and puppet show. The highlight of the show is the amazing performance by the 72 year old lady!!!
84,The best thing in Udaipur,"Good presentation once inside but terrible service to purchase tickets and would not accept entrance voucher issued by suppliers. Had to purchase tickets again and nobody at venue are polite or understanding , THE WORST CUSTOMER Service"
85,Dharohar- Heritage,"Perfect mix up of types of performances, perfect duration (only 1 hour) and definitely worth going to, not to miss out on when in Udaipur.  "
86,Engrossing,"Thanks to my cousin, I could experience the amazing dance show at this place. The show opens up the rich cultural heritage if Rajasthan and is not to be missed on your visit to Udaipur."
87,Traditional folk dances,Amazing cultural show ....one hour well spent if not for the entrance ...that was filled with sewage water.  They could have easily cancelled shows instead of making us walk on makeshift ramps on the sewage water.
88,Dharohar Cultural Show,"It was a great experience watching the colorful dances of Rajasthan, worth your money and a must watch if you are visiting Udaipur. Could not believe a 72 year old balancing the pots on her head and dancing."
89,Nice folk show,"This venue has a cultural show that is a MUST visit for anyone and everyone!! It's everyday for a duration of an hour. Starts at sharp 7:00pm. To get your tickets you need to be there in line atleast by 5:30 as the line gets really long. Or, I'd strongly advise to get your…"
90,Nice for a  change ,This place was beautifully lit and well organized. The long queue was worth it. The dance and drama artists were well supported by amazing live musicians. The pot with fire dance and the pot lady who danced with numerous pots well balanced on her head were the highlights of the…
91,Transitional dance show,"The museum was fascinating and the cultural dance show was well worth going to. The combined live music, historical stories behind the dances and the dancing was amazing. The room was hot so bring a fan. The show is only an hour."
92,Dharohar- Heritage,The music and dance cultural show was excellent. And the next day we went back to see the museum. The building is fun to explore and we loved seeing the room with all the puppets!
93,A nice evening  out,Lovely haveli to visit. We had all the time to see it as we went in the early afternoon  Gets crowded in the evening before the cultural show for obvious reasons. Well restored haveli and worth the visit Book tickets for cultural visit ahead the previous day or earlier in the day
94,Culture Defined,"The mansion is certainly beautiful, like many mansions and palaces in the area. The folk dance and puppet show in the evening is superb, and there is even a 75-year old lady (perhaps the teacher) who dances in the group!"
95,Catch the show,This is old havali converted into museum. Good for people who wants to know about local culture . The views are good . Near by market is good to roam around.
96,Good cultural show but....,This is a must see show if you are in Udaipur. The puppet show and the last dance (leaving this as a surprise) is the best. 
97,Must visit!,The place is small but lovely. Make sure to visit the evening show. Tickets can(and should) be bought online as in the evening the line is crazy. Be ready to pay more as they charge something for online purchase. The guy at the counter has no idea about online tickets service. 
98,Interesting museum,It's one of those places that you can visit without having to spare much of your time during your walkthrough around the Lake Pichola bank.  Good view of the lake. Also houses a full fledged Indian traditional puppet collection. Entry fees is 50 INR per person. There is an…
99,Rajasthani culture at its best,"This is a not-to-be-missed experience while in Udaipur!  The show presents a number of different dances with full explanation.  Fun, lively and informative! "
100,Enjoy the cultural evening,"A place where you get to see the traditional and cultural show of an hour which takes you to live the Rajasthani culture, dance and music.  Also adjacent to Ghanghor Ghat to see the lake view as well. Nice to visit."
101,The best thing about our Udaipur trip,"We were a party of three, parents and grown up son.  I really wanted to see the dancing so we arrived early and got o.k. seats.  The costumes and dancing were very good and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, my husband thought it was o.k. but my son wasn't fussed.  I think had the…"
102,One of the best places in Udaipur ,Had to get the tickets the day before for the following day. Cheap entry and good way to spend the evening.Can get a bit cramped but get there early to chose your seat
103,Near to Gangur ghat,"Do not miss this little treasure! Much smaller in scale than City Palace and quiet, too! No crowds At all on a Sunday morning. The first few rooms including the puppet museum will involve the hard sell to buy souvenirs. Nice prices though. They are currently doing more…"
104,Family and Friend Trip,We visited this site while staying in Udaipur. This is a heritage property which conducts cultural Rajasthani dance shows as well as houses a museum. Very close to City centre and worth a Visit!
105,Tradition first,"Situated on the edge of Lake Pichola and so with wonderful views. The haveli was very tired looking and in need of some tlc, as were the museum rooms, including turbans (the world's largest), a puppet room, costumes, etc, but many of the 130+ rooms are not accessible to visitors. We didn't see the cultural show, but perhaps that would have been the better option."
106,Beautiful haveli ,"Myself with my better half visited in October,2018 and spent a colourful,delighted evening at Bagar Ki Havel, a old and historical Haveli. Here, Rajasthani traditional songs, dances along with music could be seen and which started sharp at 6.15 p.m in an open area and closed at…"
107,Bag or ki haveli,Didn't visit the museum only went there for the folk dance which was a one hour performance and would definitely recommend the same. They presented dance from various regions of Rajasthan which was executed brilliantly..The puppet show as well was great .Only found it weird to…
108,For art lovers,"This show runs every evening. In peak season come earlier in the queue as there are only 250 seats inside. The show includes various dance and act forms from various parts and tribes of Rajasthan. The sitting is inside an old Haveli, some chairs, some steps and some mattresses.…"
109,Not a 'must' see,Attended the evening dance and puppet show at the Bagore ki haveli and it was a treat to watch the same! lovely light and music to compliment the dance show and some amazing dancers too.The 72 year old lady dancer amazed me with her skills!! Must watch for sure.
110,Must see show,"I  had visited this haveli in the evening for the cultural  show only . It was a great show done by local troops and is very well organised!!it is worth watching!! There were various dances performed from.various parts of Rajasathan, puppet shows etc..Ticket is INR 90 only..do…"
111,dance and puppet show,The cultural show with the folk dances and the puppet show at the Haveli was totally amazing!  The puppet show had me and my folks in split! The dancing lady with the multiple matkies was amazing too!  My parents can’t really sit cross legged on the floor; but if you can; then…
112,A must see cultural show,"Not maintained at all.... Everywhere is bad smell, garbage... I don't know why is tourist spot... Not recommend at all... Pls don't go just waste your time... "
113,Great place to spend in the evening,I was recommended to visit Bagore ki haveli for the famous evening dance program. I obliged and visited the show. It was fantastic. Very well managed and all the performances were great. Different dance forms of Rajasthan were performed by the local ladies. It was so colorful.…
114,Must visit for evening cultural show,"We have many reviews about Wats good here , so I will try telling other pointers. Since it's held in open area , so do carry woolens in winters. Camera passes can b bought in the middle of d show as well.. but d whole performances available on YouTube . Be in line by 5:30pm. It…"
115,Must visit Dharohar show of Udaipur...!,First day in Udaipur we went to the Indian folk show in the Bagore ki Haveli museum. All I can say is go! If you want to see how India looked like or get a taste of Indian culture. I would surely recommend.
116,Superb Rajasthani traditional Culture,One the real best maintained place to visit entery with nominal fee. It is a Lovely museum the best I found very neat n clean  with proper display lights n detailed stories. Best time to visit in day time and book your reservation for cultural music n dance programme of an hour from 6-7 7-8 8-9 seats limited in high demands
117,Some great talent,"""Bagore Ki Haveli"" is more Famous for It`s Traditional & Culture Performances ..... An 18th century Rajput masterpiece situated at the heart of City of Palaces, Udaipur – Bagore Ki Haveli beside Lake Pichola  Every Evening Show , Called "" Dharohar "" Around 7 Pm  Must be spend…"
118,Such an entertaining show!,Very impressive folk dance. Must watch if you are in Udaipur. The museum is also worth watching.  Must buy ticket in advance.
119,Cultural dance performance,"I had no idea what to expect when I opted to attend this show other than it was recommended by the guesthouse that we stayed at. I was pleasantly surprised by the visual storytelling of the Rajastani culture - we were entertained with music, dance and so much more.  It is an…"
120,Times to reach for evening dance show,If you want to experience some amazing cultural show with Rajasthani folk dance and music... dont skip this. They have show timings in the evening for which one needs to reach there early to queue for tickets. Advice is to reach there early and get the tickets. 
121,A visit to this place is a absolute must,We visited the Bagore Ki Haveli in the evening for a performance of local music and dance. It was a lovely evening with a commentary of the origins and history of the various dances. The cast were very talented and provided a good evening of entertainment. Show times when we…
122,Cultural Dance show in the evening ,"The Dharohar cultural show at the Haveli was one of the highlights of our Udaipur trip. Definitely one NOT TO MISS!
