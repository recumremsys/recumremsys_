0,"What a great place, if a lot of walking.","What a great place! We did the night tour, which is self-guided with an audio device. It's a lot of walking, but it is very interesting and very informative. Save yourself some headache and park in the lot next door (which is $12 after 5 p.m. Sunday through Thursday.)"
1,Interesting a educational,I thought that this place was really cool. It’s huge and the audio tour was very detailed. Lots of history and it wasn’t that expensive to tour.
2,Definitely Yes,"Very cool experience exploring the prison. It’s a self guided audio tour so it allows you to do this at your own pace. Very well done, kudos to whoever put together the audio. Many eye opening facts and a look into prison life in the early 1800’s."
3,Loved it,Well worth the trip! So interesting! We did a night tour and they give you a headset to listen to a narrated tour.  We were able to socially distance because we guided ourselves through the facility.Very interesting - a must see in Philly!
4,Interesting and timely,This was my favorite attraction in Philly.  The audio tour is extensive and very thorough.  It’s very interesting and can take a whole afternoon.  The extra exhibit regarding incarceration was fascinating.  Highly recommend - don’t miss!!!!
5,Awesome Attraction,"We visited Eastern State Penitentiary today and found the self guided audio tour to be wonderful!  We could go at our own pace, listen again if we missed something or skip something all together if we chose to.  There is much to see and take in.  The photos we took of the amazing architecture are beautiful.  It’s hard to imagine just how many people spent time locked up there.  If the walls could talk!  If you’re in Pennsylvania, go check it out!"
6,A must see while in Philadelphia!!,Haven’t visited any prisons before so this was a cool experience. The tour is all self guided with an audio tour so you can go at your own pace and see what you pick. Went on a warm winter day but it was freezing inside. Never need to go more than once. But for a one time thing it was pretty cool.
7,A MUST VISIT while in Philly!,"We went on both tours. The daytime tour, which was a self-guided audio-was very detailed and fascinating. The history in the building and life of the prisoners was well detailed in the audio.(Steve Buscemi  has a great voice) The night time-Halloween tour (Terror behind the walls) was brilliant, not for the faint hearted. It involves 6 scary attractions, each one puts the heebie jeebies through your body, especially when they separate you from your group, their features from the make-up is brilliant."
8,A love the history,Great audio tour!! We loved going here and doing the free self guided audio tour. They have done an excellent job with providing information and history and making you think about things today!
9,You HAVE to go ,"This was a great audio-tour of a wonderful, and tragic site. My friends and I did some of the bonus stops after the baseline, and they only added to the value of the tour. It was very educational and interesting to see how far we've come, and yet how far behind we are still. Additionally, with regards to it being haunted, I definitely felt vibes."
10,Rich history in this beautifully preserved building,I was really surprised with how interesting this place was! The audio guide is the best i've seen at any attraction. Budget about 2-3 hours to see everything.
11,Do not do the in-person tour. Let Steve Buscemi be the guide!,"It's a real cool experience with a ton of history. Place is very fasicinating to see. Audio tour is good, but would be more informatiove with a guide."
12,I’d go again,Great trip. The audio set provided a lot  information and the tour gave great glimpses of life there. Provided hands on activities on how and why prison rates are on the rise.  Didn’t take too long to tour maybe 2 hours.
13,Visiting the Eastern State Penitentiary,Very cool place and easy to get to. I did the audio tour and you can easily spend hours walking around. I wouldn’t go when it’s too hot or cold or raining. There is a lot of outside walking involved.
14,Blend of history and current events,"Haunting and interesting! Took my teenage son who loved it...the audio tour is excellent, but it is a semi-expensive entrance fee. The audio tour is included. There is free parking if you can get it along the road in front of it or an expensive lot next door. Definitely worth the visit!  Similar to an Alcatraz visit:)"
15,We were surprised!,"This place is definitely worth visiting.  It is reasonably priced with a self-guided audio tour.  The way to go is well marked and there are lots of volunteer staff members stationed along the way.  If you like old buildings it is interesting, the history is interesting and the information is very relevant today. It covers the history of the U.S. penal system and where we are today with more people incarcerated than ever and crime rates similar.  Also, many things that were a crime then are no longer treated the same way, like vagrancy, sodomy, alcohol and abortion. There are lots of interpretive displays and you can plan on spending at least several hours here.  Afterwards try Zorba’s Restaurant close by."
16,Fascinating visit. Well worth going.,My son and I took a tour. It is an audio tour which is nice that you can go at your own pace. There is staff throughout the prison who can answer any questions. The tour starts out with specific stops. It hits the majority of the prison. After the initial tour is over you can walk the rest of the prison. There are planks with information that have numbers on them that you can plug into your audio box and it will give more info about that particular area. There were even certain spots that had actual guides that would give you tours of certain places like the solitary confinement. It was an amazing place where you can really learn a lot about how prison was looking ago.
17,Really Cool!,I was so glad we did this tour. It was a good break from museums and political history. Audio tour that does not take too long to go through and really informative. It would probably not be too easy with anyone with physical disabilities and it is really hot in there as to be expected. If neither of those things don't bother you then it is a must do! Easy walk to the Rocky Steps from here.
18,Birthday trip ,I really like this tour; they provide you a audio tour where you can listen the story of the penitentiary but you can listen about other topic.
19,Super interesting!,"My boyfriend and I loved this part of our trip to Philly. The guided tour is really great and highly educational. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and professional. She walked the very delicate line of comparing and contrasting the prison system from past to present. She was able to connect to both children and adults by making it intellectually stimulating but also avoiding more intense subjects for the adult visitor to explore on their own with the audio tour. We spent about 2 hours total. The guided tour was about an hour, and then we spent another hour doing the self guided audio tour and visiting the spots that weren’t covered in the guided tour."
20,a little creepy,This place is way cool!  The tour is well done and very informative- almost too informative.  My recommendation would be 30 min tour- then explore for 30 minutes.  Still a great experience
21,Actually Haunted.,"This place is pretty sweet. An easy to navigate audio tour that you can take at your own pace. When you’re finished with that, there are additional places to explore, with audio recordings for some of these extra areas. Historically accurate, but also distressing and unsettling. We used to treat criminals as animals, and you can feel that while you’re here. Definitely gives you something to think about."
22,"Only heated in certain rooms, but otherwise very well preserved ","WOW! To see the first real penitentiary was amazing, a lot of walking but most places is wheelchair accessible.  This place is great learning tool for anyone.  You can spend as little or a lot of time here.  I recommend to see Al Capone's cell and all of it."
23,Beautiful Disaster,The audible tour was really interesting. Reminds me of the time I visited Alcatraz. The guides were friendly and the staff pleasant. Good way to spend a few hours. There was a bit of felt coercion and racial tones as to whether our criminal justice system works for everyone. Not sure a tourist spot is the right place for this or not. Nice spot overall
24,Extremely interesting place...,"Took the day tour through the facility.  The audio was included with the price of admission.  It was very easy to use.  You only needed to key in the number to match what you were seeing.  The stories on the audio really gave you the flavor of the prison and it was so interesting.  Spent several hours there walking through the chilling prison at our own pace.  We enjoyed it so much that we went back that night for ""Terror Behind the Walls"", which is only available during the Halloween season.  It was a terrifying experience, but very well worth it if you enjoy ghouls popping out at you and grabbing you.  It was, hands down, the scariest Halloween haunted house I've ever been to."
25,"Really unusual, interesting museum!","Very impressive structure, and interesting experience.  The self guided audio tour lets you move at your own pace, and explore those areas that interest you the most."
26,Worth it.,This exhibit was much more interesting than I thought it would be. The audio tour that comes along with it is very informative and gives a good summary of the history of the place (bonus: it's narrated by Steve Buscemi). We spent about 2 hours walking around before we saw everything we wanted to.
27,Enjoyable afternoon,Toured this facility and ended up spending almost 3 hours just looking around.  The tour is an audio tour but unlike a lot of self directed tours was both very informative and interesting.  If you are in Philly definitely looking at!
28,Frozen in Time,"The tour guide was not as knowledgeable as we would have liked, but this place is something to experience. it is the nations first Penitentiary, and the groundbreaking philosophy that led to its construction is worth thinking about. Especially with the prison issues we have today. Seeing Capone's cell was also memorable."
29,So fun and educational too!,"This was a very cool tour, with tons of information. We’ve done this tour, and the tour at Alcatraz. This one certainly has more information included, and was honestly a much more enjoyable tour. I would certainly recommend making this a stop on your trip to Philadelphia."
30,Pretty cool old prison,"A visit here is an interesting thing to do.  It takes about 45 minutes to do the audio tour.  It’s probably not a compelling destination in itself, but is best visited in combination with visiting another Philly site, like the nearby Museum of Art.  In addition to the walking tour, there is a pertinent exhibit that reviews the current rate of incarceration in the U.S. compared to the rates in other nations. Worthwhile, if you’re in the area or if you have a particular interest in criminal justice."
31,No Advance Tickets ,"We were curious to see how things were. The self guided audio visual tour was excellent allowing you to pick and choose  bits of information, depending on your interests. Do not expect well preserved cells throughout all the blocks- this is not the case. But you get a great understanding of the origin of the design, the intent of incarceration originally, and the impact this penitentiary had on the evolution of jails."
32,NOT a Ghost Tour,"This place was very interesting.  Loved the self-guided tour so much that we didn't feel the need to go to the guided tour.  Keep in mind that the place isn't climate-controlled, so avoid the really cold or really hot weather.  It's also not really handicapped-accessible at this point, although I think they're working toward that."
33,"Educational regarding past, present & future",Highly recommend visiting this site and talking the audio tour. Powerful educational experience with great visuals.
34,It's just an old prison,"The audio tour was fantastic. So well done and allows you to tour at your own pace. My 14 year old was able to explore without me being up his butt the whole time. He enjoyed it. Also, there is an exhibit that brings together the theme of the place, which is incarceration reform and justice. That was incredibly eye opening. I am grateful for the work they do to preserve this space and educate the future generations on alternatives to mass incarceration."
35,Real Prison,This was a great place to visit and very interesting. My husband and I enjoyed the audio guided tour as we can move around at our own pace. Would highly recommend - & order online to get a discounted rate!
36,Fantastic experience ,We were blown away by this place. It’s a definite must see! The history (which I’m not a huge history person) was jaw dropping. Check out Groupon before u visit
37,Kinda creepy but well worth the time and price of admission,I cannot speak highly enough about this place. The audio guide was brilliantly informative and combines a good amount of being directed around to the main parts and then allowing for self exploration. My favourite bits were the art exhibitions they have throughout on quite thought provoking topics and their dedication to raising awareness about the modern conditions of incarceration in America. I spent 3.5 hours and wish I had come earlier in the day to have even more time to explore. Excellent!
38,Cool place to visit..,"This is a self guided tour. You receive a headset and device that you can go at your own pace and listen to the ""guide"". It is done in a way that teaches everything from when the prison was built and closed, to the actual examples of of how the prisoners lived inside the walls. I found it to be very informative. I was shocked in learning the length of time people had to serve and that some were put to death for minor offenses. Of course, we had to see Al Capone's cell while we were there. The gift shop had some nice t shirts."
39,Well worth a visit,It’s worth spending a couple of hours here and it’s nice that the audio tour is thrown in with the admission price as often you have to pay extra for things like that.  It does become a bit repetitive but the Al Capone section is towards the end so make sure you don’t miss that.Not much is air conditioned (obviously) so it can be warm on a hot day.
40,"Eerie, eloquent, and educational Eastern State Penitentiary",Brandon was very informative and the prison was fascinating. We did the private tour and then the audio tour.
41,very unique experience,"This was an excellent historic building, and the audio tour (narrated by Steve Buscemi!) added a great deal to the already interesting displays. Quite a bit of the complex is either outdoors or poorly heated, so bring a jacket if you're visiting in winter. Also, not particularly accessible for guests with mobility issues."
42,Educating and fascinating ,"I really appreciated the audio guides here, meaning it was easy to go at your own pace. There's 10 listenings / areas that it guides everyone through, to get a general overview of the prison, but there's another 55 or so listenings you could check out if you're really interested. It's the kind of place you could spend 1 hour or 6 depending on your interest. We really appreciated that they had somewhere for us to store bags so we didn't have to carry around heavy items. The statistics model in the grassed area was shocking. Definitely worth checking out if you're in Philly."
43,Informative with audio tour,"This place had an awesome tour during the day. The audio tour was great. However, they kept advertising Al Capone staying there and that wasn’t mentioned in this audio tour. My husband also went back for the Haunted House at night and loved it. He would definitely do it again. He said it was long and good variety of themes. This is a must see if you are in Philly!"
44,An all day adventure!,"We have a handicapped son and were happy to see this place almost entirely accessible. You get an audio guide free, narrated by Steve Buscemi, which details tins of info about the purpose and eventual demise of this prison. Lots of cool details in the guide. Neat picture opps and a cute little souvenir shop."
45,Eastern State is Cool!,Very interesting place with lots of information.  The audio tour gives you a good overview of the site and you have the option to see more areas if you wish.  I wasn't expecting much but definitely exceeded my expectations!  There is also information on more current prison issues.  Interesting to see as well how the place is deteriorating and how it is important to support such a building for future generations!
46,"A Sobering Monument, Not a Haunted House","I did the self-tour option with the recorded narrative.  It was neat to have Steve Buscemi's voice leading me through the abandoned prison and I wished I'd allowed more time for my visit.  So interesting!  I wonder how many native Philadelphians know how this prison was on the leading edge of prison reform back in its day?  In the fall, The Terror Behind the Walls event is not to be missed!!!"
47,Highlight of our trip,"I toured Eastern State during Christmas week and while it was pretty cold, we had an amazing time! The audio tour is fabulous and very detailed. Worth the trip, definitely. You can see Al Capone's cell, but overall, it looks exactly like how it was left. I love the feeling that you're touring an abandoned prison. You almost feel like Indiana Jones exploring a ruins. It's a bit spooky but that's what makes it so interesting. Bottom line, this is a place where people lived, each with a story, some notorious."
48,Interesting & A Definite Must See,"We just went to look and decided to take a tour.  Highly recommend, very historic self guided tour with audio set.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable and give extra tours of the hospital ward/wing."
49,Interesting,"The penitentiary museum is unusual and thoughtfully curated, with an informative audio guide. You can see much of the prison and learn about the history of prisons."
50,Fascinating!,Very interesting. Enjoyed the audio tour. Lots to see and explore. Employees were helpful and polite. Place is very creepy. Would recommend.
51,Interesting Site,"The Penitentiary is very impressive what with its upkeep and how intact it is. The tour is actually just you following a guided path while an audio recording narrated by Steve Buscemi acts as your tour guide, talking about the origins of the prison, inmate life, and the reasons behind the setup of the place. I would come here in the spring or fall though, because some rooms don't have heat and I came in the winter. So if you do come in the winter, wear a coat!"
52,Interestingly haunting experience  ,"Out of all the sights visited, this is my favorite!  I was there for hours exploring and taking pictures.  Trudging around in 110 degrees was exhausting, but so worth the effort.  There are a couple of places with AC to relax and cool off inside the penitentiary.  The cells are decaying and artifacts are left in them.  The lighting is spectacular for creepy photography."
53,Lifelong History lesson,"Finally got to visit the Penitentiary, and it is definitely worth the trip. Signage and the audio part of the tour explain details about the prison you may not readily notice. Be advised that the prison is not air conditioned but there is a centrally located rest room on the property where you can cool off and even charge your phone. Buy electronic tickets online and save a few dollars each vs the door price. Allow yourself at least 2 hours to see & digest all the exhibits but you could easily breeze through in an hour without feeling cheated. Bring your camera."
54,Interesting ,"Take a tour of this old prison, which is an historic place.  There is a guide, who explains details of what it was like to be incarcerated many years ago there about a century ago.  It actually stressed a manner of reform rather than punishment. Plan a tour ahead of time or check the schedule online or by phone to make sure visitors are allowed in the day you want to visit.  You will see the cells, the original flooring, the stairs snd doorways plus you will hear about an important part of history as regards prison system at the time in Philadelphia."
55,Unique and moving experience,"This tour was fabulous!  Our group contained kids, teens, and adults, and we all really enjoyed it!  The audio tour aspect was perfect and allowed us to travel at our own pace. The upkeep and layout of the facility is impressive. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone!"
56,History of Incarceration,This is such an awesome place to visit.The prison is huge and took us about three hours to go through it.You can see All Capone's cell and hear some very interesting stories.Its a incredible experience .I recommend highly.Parking next door is $13 for up to twelve hours.
57,Very Cool Experience!,My wife and I visited form the UK. Amazing place to spend a couple of hours. Well presented and very informative. We both think it’s a must see while in Philly.
58,Wonderful experience,Super interesting and a great audio tour included.  A great history lesson on how the prison system developed over time.
59,Overwhelming experience,So interesting to hear about and learn the history of this prison.  There was an audio tour and commentators included previous guards and inmates.  It wasn't hard to imagine the conditions the prisoners lived in.  This was one of my favorite tours in the city.
60,Creepy But Cool,"I became aware of Eastern State through an old ghost hunting show that set up there, but the main tour is fascinating, informative, and thought provoking. In addition to giving insight into the construction of the prison, the evolving philosophies of incarceration throughout its history, and a larger commentary on incarceration in modern society, this is a very interesting counterpoint on individual freedom in the birthplace of our freedoms."
61,One of a kind experience,"Fun place to go see, with a great audio tour. Lots to see including Al Capone's cell. The architecture is awesome too."
62,Unforgettable,"This place was a perfect spooky season group event! The skits were so realistic and well executed. Wearing the necklaces limits your activity and if you're gonna go, might as well do it right! No necklaces!"
63,Guided Tour Recommended ,For some reason this creepy old prison is awesome to visit. The narrated tour by Steve buschemi makes it better. There is a lot of information available and the place is quite photogenic. It is sad how there were children imprisoned here. This was a different time though. I highly recommend a visit. You can book online and save $2. Also you can save $2 with a coupon code from the brochure in your hotel.
64,Another fun visit!,This was a very interesting stop.  The audio tour is well done and so interesting.  Well worth the visit and admission price.
65,Cool and you feel it,An amazing experience.  Worth the entrance fee .An unusual tourist attraction. I suggest that you go on a day when it is not raining as some of the area is outdoors while other parts are without a roof.
66,Outstanding!,"I came here many years ago for their audio guide tour where you're given a headset and could listen about information on the place. That voice to my surprise was Steve Buscemi. Steve and I walked the corridors into the spookiest of rooms to learn about inmates to the usage of each room. On this tour, you'll see the famous Al Capone cell and even a dog that had been once imprisoned here. When I last visited this museum, the gate keeper was even nice enough let us open the main gate with his key. Not too sure if that's apart of the tour or not, but it was surely interesting."
67,Good audio tour,This is a must see while in Philadelphia. Would love to come back during Halloween as apparently they do an off the hook haunted tour.
68,Amazing tour at your own pace,We took the self guided tour and really enjoyed it. Very informative and interesting.  It was a hot sticky day but still enjoyed the facility and to see all the areas along with Al Capone’s cell etc. so glad we took the time to tour and shop the gift shop too.
69,go in nice weather,We booked a visit to the ESP including a guided talk that happen twice daily (I think) at 2pm. We enjoyed the building and the history and also opted to explore on our own with an audio guide after our 45 minute tour was completed. You can also turn up at certain areas at certain times for little mini tours/talks (schedule given on arrival.)The tour that we had with a guide was more of a discussion regarding the issue of incarceration rather than the history of the building which wasn't particular for us but we had an excellent time overall.
70,Always something new to learn,"We only did the audio tour, but it was enough.  When you see and hear how we treated the prisoners here you can't but question the philosophies behind incarceration.  It created fabulous conversation between us and our friends on what kind of crime deserved this level of incarceration.  How do we use the prisons to reduce repeat offenders?  Conversations we would never have had without stopping here.  I recommend this tour, but expect to leave feeling sad for those who called this home."
71,More than a historic prison,The visit to this penitentiary was so informative. Everyone on the tour was invested in learning about the history of the institution.  It showed the real side of the early 20th century.
72,Cold Tour,I knew nothing about this prison but visited on a recommendation and glad we did. It’s a very informative thought provoking visit and the history of this place and previous inmates recorded stories really bring it to life. A must do visit and good value.  The cafe across the road did a nice breakfast too👍
73,A Must Visit Attraction,I have been watching a lots of documentaries about prisons and such!This by far is an AWSOME live experience!It’s as if you could see in your eye what you see in TV! Definitely a great experience and unique experience!For $10 it’s definitely worth it! 2hours spent there and we could have spent even more! Unlike some of the reviews I have seen this place should stay as is... otherwise what’s the point if renovated and AC/heather....We are there to experience what human have endured and what is like to be in a prison!!!!
74,A Must-See!,"The building itself is absolutely magnificent and beautifully preserved. It really is an incredible structure!Unfortunately, my rating is for the HORRENDOUS in-person tour my wife and I took when visiting the prison.I would like to preface this by saying that my wife and I are AVID visitors to historical sites, take historical tours, voraciously read history and watch documentaries...etc.With that being said, I have never in my life heard a tour guide speak so much and yet say so little. The tour was comprised of almost entirely rhetorical questions that you would ask a first grader. ""How would you FEEL about having a bag placed over your head?""...""Would it hurt to wear shackles?"".......""How would you FEEL about having to live in silence"".....""How would you FEEL about being forced to read the bible?"".... ""Would you FEEL scared?""...""Would you feel hungry if you weren't fed?""....... on and on and on. Even more awkward was the deafening silence that came after each absurd question as if expecting us to answer. There was zero substance, zero objective fact, just vapid rhetorical questions about feelings.We didn't take a tour to be asked rhetorical questions.....""how would I FEEL about being hungry and not being fed?"".....GEEZ, hmmm, that's a REAL tough question there.It was borderline insulting. Are we on a first grade tour here? Are we adults or are we children?Even more bizarre was a refusal to answer the most basic questions. I politely asked a question regarding a riot that occurred in 1961.  I received a response from the tour guide that went something like this:  ""Um, well, I do not want to upset you or members of the group....these were humans...this was inequity....we mustn't sit in judgment of these humans.....mmkay?""A nonsensical 'trigger warning' along with some inane comment about inequity and judgment?Are you kidding me, lady!???  THIS IS A PRISON!!!!  YES, TERRIBLE THINGS happened here! YES, believe it or not we CHOSE to come here and LEARN more in depth about the events that happened here! Even the bad things. Are we children? You need to sensor historical fact for us because you 'feel' it would be 'too upsetting'.  RIDICULOUS!Eventually my wife and I left about mid way through the tour. We couldn't take one more rhetorical question.This was by far the worst tour I have ever taken in my life, hard stop.I'm deeply disappointed we didn't just do the damn audio tour. I just found out that STEVE BUSCEMI narrates the audio tour?! We really missed out on that, man!To summarize, do yourself a favor....definitely DO VISIT Eastern State. Like I said the building is magnificent, it's very well restored. Even if you are not a fan of history the architecture is intriguing!  Just...whatever you do, do NOT take the in-person tour. Do the Steve Buscemi tour, ok? At least do it for me...., please just do it for me!"
75,"Really insightful, well worth a visit.","We choose the guided tour option, which was scheduled for 2PM. Since you can also get the audio tour and we had plenty of time, we also took the audio tour, which is self guided with a personal mp3 player and headset, which allows you to key in the numbers on the exhibits for in depth information. We spent at least three hours walking around, making sure to listen to every available selection. In addition to the 10 stops on the tour, there are even more numbers on the individual exhibits. We met up with our tour guide at 2 for an in depth discussion about the history of the prison. It was a wonderful tour, but when we first got to the prison, we were told we could ""skip"" the 10 stops on the audio tour since it would be covered by the guided tour. I'm glad that we finished the self guided audio tour since the tour guide really didn't cover the same material. By doing both, we got a fuller visit.You should by your tickets online a day or two before to be sure that there are spaces available for the guided tour. We were the last two admitted and we were there first thing when they opened."
76,Fascinating Attraction!,It’s very well organized with it’s included audio-guide. The temporary exhibition its also quite fun. I recommend!
77,Interesting ,"Wow, is all I can say!  The self guided tour is great, you can follow along by the number as it goes or you can skip around.   The info you get is great!  Stories from actual inmates and people who worked here.  Seeing the place now and hearing the stories you can imagine how it was and what it was like.  Of course the big attraction I suppose was knowing Al Capone was kept here at one time.  You can see the Cell(s) he was in and the info surrounding him is really something.  While it does a few bucks to do the tour it is well worth it and highly educational."
78,"Museum by day, haunted Halloween attraction by night","I liked visiting Eastern State Penitentiary.  I took the audio tour (which is narrated by Steve Buscemi!) and it was informative and relaxing. Lots of wonderful architectural photos to be had and an overall relaxing walk through this prison. The audio tour was informative and easy to follow with interesting facts about the prison, it's inhabitants and the overall thoughtful design behind the prison's creation.  The worker in the museum shop was funny and nice.  This is a definite must see if you like prisons, architecture, history or just neat photo opps!"
79,Great ,A fascinating bit of history and architecture.  Detailed audio tour.  Interesting exhibits.  Halloween show also looks interesting but I didn't see it.
80,$$,What an interesting place.  In a sad state of disrepair but nonetheless worth the visit.  You have an audio tour to follow at your own pace which gives a good overall impression.  We learned a lot about the American penal system and some very interesting figures which certainly gave us something to think about and discuss.I don't know that I'd rate it the number one attraction but it is certainly high up on the list!
81,Make this site a priority on your tour of Philly,I would call this the Alcatraz of the East. The audio tour was very similar to the one at Alcatraz which I liked immensely. The stories they tell are very interesting and well laid out. Buying tickets was fast and easy. We spent about two hours here. We could have spent more time but it was so hot out that we were too pooped to continue.
82,Fantastic experience ,"Excellent place to visit, really enjoyed it. Very good audio guide, and friendly staff. Lots of thought has been put into the audio route, and visual displays. Highly recommend."
83,A Must-See In Philadelphia!,Learned so much in the self guided audio tour about the growth of and the current prison system. Spent about two hours there and it was about perfect.
84,Very interesting and educational ,The audio tour really makes this experience.  Listening to the stories of the prisoners and workers brings the place to life.  It is a very interesting concept and very different from the modern penitentiary system.  The architecture and restored and abandoned cells are truly worth seeing.  The exhibit on modern prisons and reform programs was also thought provoking.
85,Dress warm!,"What an intrigiung place.  Was concerned our teenagers would not like the visit, but they really enjoyed it.  Be prepared to walk.  Underestimated the size, but enjoyed every step.  So much history.  You get an complimentary audio set, which is outstanding at explain each stop.  I like how they have ""redone"" a few spots and then left most like it was.  Really interesting about how the philosophy changed over the years here and what they wanted to accomplish with those incarcerated.  So glad they kept this place and did not tear it down to build houses, hotels or stores.  I really enjoyed our visit and highly recommend it.  You'll need to be prepared to walk, but well worth it.  Got to see Al Capone cell, but honestly that was not the most interesting part. Just walking and listening to the audio about the history was very educational and interesting."
86,Intimidating Profound Awesome,"Loved this , great commentary on the headset guide provided. Well laid out, and I like that they’ve left some of the cells in their derelict form.Staff dotted around were all informative and friendly."
87,Something different than the typical museums,You are given an audio headset for the first 10 or so staged. Afterwards you can roam wherever you please. We were there for 2 hours but only got through maybe half of the entire prison. Highly recommend going! Amazing tour at your own pace
88,Interesting & Informative,"Lots of history in this penitentiary and worth the visit. Headphones are provided so you can walk around the property at your pace. Look for the numbered placard and put in the number to listen to life in the penitentiary.  It makes it easy to learn a lot.  Once you do the basic guide, walk around and find more numbers. Also, stop by the indoor displays by the ball field."
89,Take the time to see this historic prison,Arrive early in the summer months as it is cooler and not as crowded. The tour is a self guided audio with great information as to the history of the prison and it’s prisoners. Tour took about 1.5 hours. You get a discount on tickets if you pre-purchase online.
90,Interesting visit,"Great place to visit for history!!! Kind of spooky, but the tour was good! Make sure you wear comfortable shoes."
91,Visit to understand evolution of prisons in the last 200 years,We visited the Eastern State Penitentiary with our three boys. It was very interesting and informative and of course really cool for my boys. The self guided tour was easy to use and gave us a lot of information as we walked around this creepy place.
92,Great piece of history,"As a photographer, it's great to find a place that looks abandoned but is kept open for the public.  From Al Capone's cell to the recorded tour voiced by Steve Buscemi...a must."
93,Welcome to your JAIL !,"I was so intrigued by this entire tour. Loved that you were able to go at your own pace, we weren't rushed at all & we learned so much about this part of history that was both shocking and enlightening."
94,Who Knew?,"Eastern State Penitentiary is an amazing historic site in the heart of Philadelphia. The listen as you walk tour is pretty cool. You can go anywhere on the provided map and punch in the coresponding number on your provided audio device and listen to facts and stories. We went as a part of the ""City Pass"" which provides 3, 4 or 5 attractions for 1 price. All in all Eastern State is an amazing place worthy of half a day or more."
95,Give yourself a couple of hours to walk through this amazing historic site,"I booked the ticket online and it cost 2$ less then in museum. This is a real former penitentiary. Architecture is amazing! Also how everything looks is very interesting and impressive. You can take a free audioguide which tells you the history of this place and many other curious facts. Guides also make some free activities like short tours. For example you can get in a hospital where the tour guide will explain how prisoners were treated etc. I spend there 3 hours but I would like to come there again, probably in the evening so its more atmospheric"
96,Historical Trip and the Inner Workings of the Prison System,Fascinating to tour this old prison. Location was great near the art museum. Parking was very easy with the lot right next door
97,Unexpected Fascination,Even more interesting than Alcatraz. Audio tour is a necessity to get the full experience. Give yourself a minimum of two hours as there is a lot to see.
98,"Fun, interesting, different. ",Interesting overview of the first penitentiary. Well laid out. Great audio recordings. Don’t miss the tunnel and Al Capones cell. Close parking.
99,Fascinating place - well worth a couple hours,"I was really surprised by how interesting this museum is. It’s a really interesting site with a lot of deep history to it. There are a lot of staff around who are very helpful, and the audio tour was very well done. I think a lot of really good research and work in general has gone into the museum. I don’t think it would be great for young children, just because of the nature of a prison being potentially upsetting. I would say maybe middle school and up? We stuck around to see pretty much all of the additional audio tour stops that are not on the 35 minute main circuit, and I think in total we spent about 2 1/2 hours. I think it would be hard to spend much longer. Do be aware that most of the facility is not climate controlled because it is either outdoors or in corridors that are open to the outside. So dress appropriately, but go! It’s great and you will learn a lot."
100,Interesting Amazing ,Eastern State Pen. is a great place to visit that has a lot of crazy history and exciting facts. I believe it was the very first State Pen and the first Pen. to incorporate solitary confinement. Many other famous prisons around the world were modeled after this place. If you are lucky you might even hear a ghost from the past.
101,Interesting and informative ,"I spent a couple of hours here because I kept finding area I had missedThe audio guide is very helpful and provides insights from staff, former inmates and prison management. Most cells have not been restored and some have been reclaimed as artist exhibit spaceAn exhibit about the prison system was very interesting. You had an opportunity to write a statement about breaking a law. There was a board displaying these statements and a button to push to see those who had written by prisoners versus the general public visiting the site. Very enlighteningThis exhibit needs to be updated with the recent criminal justice reform bill since it makes reference to the need for it.Although interesting, this exhibit seems out of place for a sanctuary city."
102,Terror at the penitentiary,"Found this place fascinating, well worth a visit! Would recommend the guide tours to get the next level of detail."
103,Interesting Insight into Early Penal System,"Extremely interesting audio guide, which provided accounts from former residents and employees which added real authenticity and context."
104,Interesting,"Very interesting self guided tour of one of the oldest prisons in America. Hard to believe they allow people to walk around on their own because the place is in very poor condition. It takes at least two hours to have a good look around. Lots of displays. Definitely worth the price of admission.  We went on a cool day and it was cold inside, dress accordingly"
105,Reality check for everyone!,"It was pretty neat.  We were there for 1hr 40 min and still didn’t listen to everything there was to listen to.  I took my 11 yr old son and he did pretty good, it kept his interest for the most part.  It’s definitely cold in there so dress appropriately.  It was in the 40’s and breezy the day we went which equates to a very chilly prison.  There is one (small) heated exhibit and they have one space heater in the center of the facility that you can stop and warm up for a minute.  There’s a lot to see and hear on the audio tour. You can actually walk into some of the cells too."
106,Spooky Season!,"Went with a 15 year old and 2 12 year olds.  We were all entertained and found it both interesting and eerie inside.  The self guided audio tour seemed to move too slow for us and we skipped over a lot of the stops, but what we did listen to had informative information and stories about life in the prison.  We will return again in warmer weather as it in not climate controlled at all.  Neat to see the way it is deteriorating and the way they are keeping it in its natural state of decay.  Worth the trip there, Fairmount Park is also a very nice area to check out with your family"
107,Eastern State Penitentiary,Very instructive for all ages. Try to have at least 3 hours to visit. It is close to the Rodin and Museum of Art so you can combine these together.
108,Fantastic insight to this prison,"This was a great afternoon, 2-3 hours for us. All ages we’re fascinated. We pre-booked the 2pm tour on the website which was a riveting hour. Focus on penitentiary function in society over time/ in different countries as well as facts about ESP. After that we enjoyed looking round- especially finding out about Al Capone (and seeing his luxurious cell!) and other old gangsters and escapees. We learnt a lot. Also - we didn’t know children stayed in ESP. Recommended for a weekend break in Philly. Nice cafe opposite the main entrance too."
109,Best thing to do in philly,"We took the guided tour and so got some great insights into this fascinating piece of US history. We learnt a lot about the kind of approach to criminal reform - not just punishment - they tried here and how the radial design of the building, where guards can see down all the corridors from the central hub, was adopted by many prisons around the world. We highly recommend the guided tour because you get a whole range of insights that would be missing if you just wandered round by yourself."
110,A must see,We took a guided tour of the First state penitentiary in the states.  It has long since close but a great historical site.  It looks like a castle from the outside till you enter those gates.   I don’t believe small children would enjoy this but there were families there with small children.  It is very run down.  It’s just more or less to be seen for the history of a penitentiary.  Al Copone was incarcerated in this facility.   Enjoyed the trip.
111,"Fascinating, Crumbling relic of a bygone system","This place is so huge - imagining it filled with prisoners was overwhelming. There is a street parking lot nearby. We paid for 3 hours on the timer, but only needed 2.5 so we thought we did pretty well.So we bought tickets from a little booth on the street. You save $2 per adult if you purchase online before you go OR take the little brochure about ESP found in the hotel lobbies. Our teenagers got the child/student rate.When we went in, they gave us audio tours where you push the button and play a numbered segment at each sign with the corresponding number. The tour was well done. Only 1 time did I think they were offering too much information and I got bored. Our teens listened the whole time, too.After the audio tour is ""over"" there are also many other places you can listen if you choose. We did not continue, but wandered around on our own to see where Al Capone stayed and where folks dug an escape tunnel.So there are lots of artists renderings in spare cells - some of it interesting, some creepy, and some very politically charged. To each his own.There is also a large exhibit about prisons today and information about how many people the USA has in prison. A little too political and opinionated for my taste, but we just skipped by it mostly.So the backdrop here is crazy wild. Our pictures are just amazing - so eerie and beautiful at the same time. If you are around, you should take a couple of hours and see this place.The audio tour is cool, especially when you get to the part where they have the guards and ""guests"" voices telling their experiences. Really amazing.Be aware that it is not an ""inside"" place even though it looks like it. Dress for the outside weather. It was quite cold the day we went and they did have a few heaters going, but we never even unzipped our heavy coats!"
112,Very interesting,A great experience and keeps the kids entertained. A easy walk and an educational journey that doesn’t feel “educational” to the kids. Well done.
113,Excellent piece of history,It was an eyeopening experience walking the halls and corridors of this prison. I am glad we went and the guided headphone tour was good to have. We did not stay too long and were very glad we could leave when we WANTED to!!!!!
114,Historical Site,A great experience for the wife and I to visit.I can't imagine being locked up in a creepy joint like this!
115,The place where prison as a cure for criminality was conceived,The tour were really explicit with everything.. as you walk you can see even the little details. Its an interesting tour inside
116,Great Adventure,"A unique experience exploring the prison, which includes a guided audio tour and also a lot more information after the tour if you want to walk around and see more. It’s huge, plenty to listen to and learn about including modern day prisons and facts. I found the site well worth a visit. 2hour free parking outside."
117,Iconic and Well Preserved Prison,Visited ESP in July after seeing it on a number of documentaries and paranormal TV shows. Had booked the live guide tickets but got there earlier to have time to walk around ourselves and take it all in. Did the audio tour at our own pace and then walked around taking photos and reading details from the displays. Did the guided tour which was fine but would depend on the group you end up with (some people enjoy asking ALOT of questions which the guide did the best to answer).Tips:1. Don't bother with guided tour as the audio self guide is just as informative which you can do at your own pace2. If going on a hot day bring plenty of water as no air conditioning of course (shop at entry for water also)3. Maybe use restroom before you go as although there are toilets the cubicles are so small you may feel claustrophobic.
118,Very exciting and educational,"Walking through this historical and iconic prison is a unique and gloomy experience.  Seeing Al Capone's cell and the isolation cells were a highlight.  I highly recommend visiting the prison during Halloween time when the prison staff host the ""terror behind the walls"" haunted house event.  t is a crying shame that the city of Philadelphia no longer holds the annual Bastille Day celebration event at the prison."
119,Jail cell of Capone,It is always a challenge to find a place to visit with teenagers.This place is the perfect spot. The audio guide is extremely well executed and the way they rehabilitated partially some cells give a feeling of what was the life in this prisonIt is must to visit
120,Interesting tour with military discount ,All members of our family enjoyed this....even the teenagers!!There are so many stops on the audio tour. The stories are interesting. This is worth a stop and very much worth the money!!
121,Interesting,"I’ve visited Eastern State three times so far and I would go again. It’s a self guided, tape tour where you listen to info about the exhibits while walking. I always go during the day in the fall because I feel like the real history of it all is actually more scary than the “haunted” tour where actors jump out at you. I’ve had a paranormal experience myself during the day. Highly suggest this is one of the first places you visit when in Philly."
122,So interesting!,Everyone loved it. It is a cool site to see of the American prison system. My girls are 9 and 15 and they enjoyed it.
123,Creepy but interesting,Great audio tour that covers plenty without bogging you down. Lots to explore and see beyond the audio tour path. Audio notes provided at additional sites.
124,Everyone should experience ESP,What a great job with the detail on costumes and decorations. A few spots where it was creepy. Many exciting things to learn and see. Can’t wait to do the daytime tour.
125,Very interesting ,Interesting place to visit as it's different from other sites/museums. They do not have much tours but they do provide headphones for audio tour. I spent about 3.5 hours and seen/read almost everything. The only problem with this place is that it doesn't have heating (except for 2 to 3 indoor exhibits) so it gets really cold at times. Would recommend!
126,Not your average tourist cite.  ,"Fantastic tour. Most definitely lived up to my expectations and was the biggest Penitentiary I've ever visit. Dwarfs Alcatraz in size!!Excellent audio guides not only giving an insight from former inmates held there but also the detailed history of the facility until its closure in the 1970s. Inmates were hooded on their entrance and placed in solitary cells. Until their release is possible many did not see another inmate. This served twofold in that they had little or no awareness of their surroundings along with upon release never being able to identify another inmate of they came across them in the street after serving their ""penance"" in the Penitentiary!Over time dual occupancy cells were added and exercise yard expanded. Well with the admission price!"
127,Great outing,"I visited Eastern State Penitentiary on my recent visit to Philadelphia.  It is a fascinating place that is full of history.  It also has a pretty good creepy factor since it is partially in ruins.  The prison functioned from the 1830s until around 1970.  Cell blocks were added over the years and the operation of the prison obviously changed over the decades.  It was a fascinating visit to learn about the architecture of the prison, the history of this prison which was a pattern for others around the world, and some of the famous prisoners who had been held there.  Al Capone, for example, spent a year in Eastern State Penitentiary.  The audio tour is very interesting and was included in my admission.  There is some very interesting commentary in the tour, but I think the audio stories from former inmates really helped to personalize the visit.  It made it more than an old ruined prison.  There is also an interesting presentation on incarceration in America.  It was very thoughtful and gave me a better understanding of the issues surrounding prisons in the US.  I highly recommend a visit to Eastern State Penitentiary."
128,Must visit in Philly! Free audio sets too!,We tried to buy tickets on line. The website was acting up. So once we arrived I showed them and they honored the on line pricing. We received the head set and were on our way. It was very informative and from many points of view. You can walk at your own pace allowing you to stop and take it all in. The whole family was glad we made the effort to see it.
129,GREAT!,"The audio tour (free with your entry) is very informative and easy to use.  It gives you the freedom to choose your own pace and spend as much or as little time as you want at each spot.  There is so much history, so much that happened at Eastern State, that shaped the way our prisons are today.  One thing to note is that the day we visited, it was VERY hot and it was even hotter in the prison.  I guess that added to the experience, you could imagine how miserable it would have been to be a prisoner there."
130,Great Vip tour and haunted house,"From the moment you approach the building, it is a haunting experience. The self-guided tour makes the prison come to life. Steve Buschemi is an excellent narrator who tells the history in a manageable, non-overwhelming way."
131,VERY SCARY  and tons of FUN!!!,This penitentiary has amazing history and stories.  I love that it is not completely restored and you can really see the history.
132,I went to prison,"My teenage daughter and I were excited to visit just for the historic and creepy experience, but we came away with so much more.  I am not a huge audio guide fan, but the audio guide that comes with ticket had actual voices of former prisoners and prison guards that corresponded to interesting photos along the way.  If you’re into the creepy aspect there is certainly enough of that- you can enter actual cells (daughter would not do it alone) and there are plenty of crumbling exposed walls.  The reason I gave this visit five stars was for the thought-provoking and interactive displays about our prison system.  This place is not to be missed if you are visiting Philly!  P.s. Bundle up if you are visiting on a cold day."
133,Very Unique,"I have visited Philadelphia several times and hit all the historic ""must-sees."" Always wanted to go here as I've heard great things about it especially their ""haunted tours."" Even though it wasn't time for the haunted tours, my cousin and I decided to check it out and were not disappointed. Price was very reasonable - only $13. You are given a small hanging headset and player that narrates the tour.  You spend as much time as you want touring the buildings and related displays. There ae arrows on the floor to direct you so that social distancing takes place and you get to see if all without missing any hallways. We found the tour facinating. The place is clean while still maintaining the eerie atmosphere of an older prison. Displays, placards, and narrations were very informative. There were many times when the recording said that you could press a number for more indept discussion and I wish I had the time to listen to them all. There was a great display of prison practices today that dealth with current prison conditions, ... Very eye opening. Al Capone's lavish cell was a cheery ending to the tour. I would highly recomment this prison tour to anyone visiting the Philly area and especially families with preteen to teen children. There were a couple of ""adult"" theme displays that were not for children but overall the place would be a great learning experience for kids."
134,Interesting Building and History,This was a once in a lifetime tour. I took my girlfriend and my niece and was so excited to tour the facility. Filled with information and the history of those who have been incarcerated. It is amazing by its sheer size and the age of the facility. You will never experience corrections like this again but it is impressive to see how far we have come.
135,Creepy but interesting ,"My husband and daughter wanted to see this place after watching it on haunted TV shows.  While we didn't see any ghosts, we did learn a lot about the history of prisons.  Even though it has been through the wringer ESP still has its own beauty."
136,Fun! ,"I certainly would not want to do the Halloween nighttime tour here. I thought it was quite spooky from the moment we entered. We did the audio tour and were pleased to find there was no charge for the handsets. It was interesting to hear about the theories of the founders of the prison and to hear accounts from some of the former inmates.Al Capone's cell was  a surprise. The section on modern day prisons and attitudes to crime/punishment was thought provoking, as were the confessions pinned up in the room.The toilets were outside in those caravan type units. The ladies was clean but the cubicles were very small."
137,A Philly Must-See!,"It was a good visit tour.  Full of information on the history, former prisoners and some incidents took place before.  The audio covered major information.  If not read the brochure carefully, you may miss other information not along the major cell blocks.  So read the brochure after the major audio tour and there would be a lot more to explore and also covered in audio."
138,Worth the money,"This place is positively dripping with bad energy and restless spirits. Even during a daytime tour you can feel the oppressive feelings of those who have suffered in the past and their resentment towards those who invade their space. If you're looking for some philly history or just a good scare, this place is legit."
139,Well worth the visit,"Fantastic and scary, what a fun experience. Visit during the day for a historic experience or after dark for the scary haunted terrors....."
140,Eastern State Penitentiary is a must see!,"This was a nice experience. Well, not nice. But very interesting. It is a great piece of history and I like that it was interactive with audio from people who were incarcerated.  The staff is helpful, even when in inclement weather. Tom in the synagogue was very nice and very knowledgeable. Thank you for the experience. I will stay out of jail."
141,Great place to visit!!,"We purchased our tickets online, in advance choosing the mobile ticket option. Apparently this means nothing as you still wait in the same line as those purchasing tickets. Pre-purchased tickets are scanned there and then you are sent to the entrance, saving no time at all.Staff onsite also weren’t very knowledgeable (we inquired about a guided tour) or friendly. All that being said, once inside we enjoyed the penitentiary and the history it holds. Please note some of the exhibits are graphic and explicit. You will be warned with signs stating mature content and you should head the warnings and use your discretion.Even though entry to the penitentiary could have been smoother we’re glad we put it on our to do list and would recommend a visit."
142,Well worth a visit,"We did this as part of our Philadelphia Pass ($50 for 3 activities and unlimited bus ride - well worth it in my opinion). This was one of my favourite things to do in Philly whilst I was there. It is an audio tour that is easy to understand, provides interesting information and it doesnt go on too long to make it boring for those with weak attention spans. The tour gives a good insight into the history of the prison and the life of prisoners who lived there. It allows you to see the prison pretty much as it was, with sights of the cells and real audio from prisoners and guards who lived and worked there respectively. There is a section of the tour that is based on modern day incarceration rates which gives you facts and statistics from the present through the last few decades and questions whether incarceration is working. It was thought provoking and interactive. In this section there were confessions of crimes from visitors put on the walls mixed with crimes from real prisoners. There was a lot of interactive stuff in this section which really makes this tour stand out. In the garden of the penitentiary you can see the skyline of Philadelphia which is pretty edgy. I recommend this tour, especially if you have the Philadelphia Pass, which can be purchased from the Visitor Center."
143,Terror Behind the Walls + Day Tour,"You get your own headphones and can go at your own pace on this tour. You can also listen to additional content if you want, so it can be a fairly quick tour or all-day experience depending on your mood. Interesting look to the whole place. We did the day tour, but they apparently have a popular night event around Halloween."
144,Fascinating,The History of the prison is so interesting and it's very touching to hear all the stories about what all the prisoners had to go through. My fiancee and I took a day time tour and we loved it. We also went there for the halloween attraction they have.
145,Spooky and fascinating,"very scary, this place is for real,you can feel in your skin, this is a must stop place for people who are visiting phila."
146,Hell hole,"This museum is fantastically put together - not only does it properly preserve and showcase the history of the prison but it also has a handful of exhibits tying it to present day trends and issues with incarceration, as well as a scattering of artistic exhibits.Things to know beforehand:- the museum is largely unheated and partially outdoor. if you're going in winter, dress appropriately- guided tours book up fast! if you're interested book in advance- the audioguide that is included with admission is fantastic, even if you can't catch a guided tour- great large coffeeshop right across the street to warm up again after the museum visit, if needed"
147,Good history lesson. ,Fascinating.  The place is huge and Al Capone's cell was there to view.  You really get a sense of what solitary confinement would be like.  Don't miss this one!!!
148,Amazing,I love the history behind this phenomenal work of art. This place should inspire you NOT to be a guest in any prison. This one even housed some famous people like Al Capone.
149,Not sure what is hype,"I'd say this tour is one of the best that I've seen in all of my city trips in the U.S. It comes with an audio tour and lasts about 1-2 hours based on your pace. They did a good job preserving this structure, and injecting some art installation towards the end of the tour. I've been to Philly many times and I'd say this is not to miss!"
150,It opens your eyes to our penal system,"We had already decided to ride the Phlash bus to get to the Art Museum, but saw this was on the way so decided to get off and have a look round. It was well worth it. The audio tour takes you through the history of the building, the way the prisoners were dealt with, their living conditions and how the prison developed over time. At the end there is a thought-provoking exhibit related to the proportion of the population held in incarceration in various parts of the world, related to the situation in the USA. It touched on alternatives to imprisonment, and also on how social issues affect people's life chances/choices and outcomes."
151,Eastern State,"A must do if in the area imo,fully enjoyed it and the audio was informative.1.5 to two hours is plenty of time here plus it’s cheap $16 at door or $14 online pp and an easy walk from downtown.Hard to believe this exists in such a metropolitan area."
152,Another awesome visit to Terror Behind the Walls,"Overall the ""Terror Behind the Walls"" experience was fun and entertaining.  Just standing in line and watching people react to the actors and staff, scaring them was a hoot.  The penitentiary is a great experience, and was fun to be in.  While I didn't find the experience to be scary, I did find it well done and thought out.  The Al Capone Speak Easy tour after the main scare to me was worth the price of admission $10.00, just to be able to sit in a few of the cells that these gentlemen had to be in for months and years at a time."
153,A Fascinating Location,We visited in May . We had been to Philly about 9 months before and seen many of the historical sites but someone missed this. We were glad to hit it on this trip. The audio tour really added to the experience. Good value (pleasant way to spend a few hours)
154,A great family experience,"Did this as a field trip, but would definitely do this without my middle schoolers! Some go at night during the Halloween season, but no way...too spooky for me.  I had no idea that Philly had such a vivid criminal background!"
155,goose bumps,"Great history & Learned a lot about the prison, My Young kids enjoyed learning and going in & out of the cells."
156,Fascinating.,"Word of warning- wrap up warm!I would definitely recommend the guided tour, our host was fantastically knowledgeable and told a tale in a way the audio guide could not- you could literally spend half a day here exploring, and it would be half a day well spent."
157,Highly recommend!,"I'm glad we finally got to visit Eastern State Penitentiary because it is even more interesting than I would have imagined. Admission includes an excellent audio tour from which we learned a lot about the progressive ideals of those who built the prison. They believed that solitary confinement would restore calm to minds that had become uncivil. That proved not to be true, but Eastern continued to try ideas that were progressive and humane. Their nighttime haunted attraction Terror Behind the Walls is popular and, I am told, terrific, but if you only do that and don't do the regular tour, you are missing out on a fascinating experience."
158,Magnificent example of early public works project,"Incredible!! Visited with teens and adults. Great experience over all, a little scary but not as much as other places we’ve visited. Different kinds of things in each attracting making sure there’s something for everyone. Hospitality and customer service like no other."
159,Didn’t find a ghost,"Went to visit this historic building with my wife, we both had a great time and we learn a lot from this visit. There are some parking lots where you pay a fee to leave you car secure and well parked. I will strongly recommend to take some kind of sweater or a jacket if going to this place, it gets cold inside the building because of how the prison was constructed. There's a lot to explore and see so i will recommend this to anyone interested in history. Wonderful experience!"
160,Interesting History,A fascinating slice of history you probably never learned.  A really good self-guided audio tour narrated by Steve Buscemi.  If you like Alcatraz you'll like this.
161,Love it!,We come down every year for Terror Behind the Walls. The setting is incredible and the monsters really enjoy trying to scare everyone. The sets and animatronics are well thought out and are of high quality. We love it and will be back next year!
162,Holy cow!!!!! Best place so far in Philadelphia ,Since they give you headphones you can go at your own pace entering numbers for audio you would like to hear at specific destinations with in the penitentiary. Very cool visit!
163,Haunted attraction,My husband visited here a few days ago and not only was it fascinating it was very educational and heartbreaking. I believe this is a hidden gem when it comes to “must do’s in Philly”! We were amazed by the size and absolutely blown away with the way the prisoners were treated. We spent a week in Philly and my husband and I both agree that this was one of our favorite tours. Definitely one of our highlights of this vacation!
164,Great visit,Well worth the money! Great experience; Had a blast. It was terrifying! I loved it!!! The actors really take their job seriously to assure you get your money's worth!
165,Another reason to go to Philadelphia!,This is a visit for those interested in Social Justice.  I don’t know how anyone could leave thinking about anything except prison reform. Surprised people would bring children.  Not for people with walked or wheelchairs.  Left me very mellow.
166,Amazing history ,Great visit on self guided tour. We spent an hour or so but you could spend much longer. Be sure and wear warm clothes if it’s cold out as there are very few places with heat. Even our 11 year old who doesn’t like museums found it worth the visit!
167,Good visit ,What an ominous place with a dark history. We could've spent the whole day there and it wouldn't have been enough
168,Makes you want to be a very good citizen!!,"Interesting place to walk around and learn about history. For two adults with military discount, it was $28. Highly recommend when you’re in the philly area as it’s a great way to learn about the historical culture and get off the beaten path."
169,Terror behind the walls ,Pretty awesome vio tour of the prison then the haunted house which was great we really enjoyed our trip.
170,Super interesting and exciting,So I thought we would walk around and see a few abandoned cells but it was so much more interesting. The self guided audio tour was very easy to follow and had all sorts of fun facts. It was very cold in there so bundle up if you visit during winter. Staff was available for info and guidance throughout. We spent about 1.5-2hrs here.
171,LOVED it!,Really great way of having past prisoners and past guards tell the stories of what the prison was like. It was also good how there were so many pictures since most the building is broken down. Parking nearby was good! And gift shop was cute.
172,I went to Prison,"Our original thought was to pass this by, but friends recommended it.  We're glad we decided to go! It is the first modern penitentiary in the world, having opened in the 1820's.  It's an interesting tour (audio tour is included in the entry) and very enlightening.  Be aware that it is, for the most part, not heated or cooled; dress accordingly."
173,Lots to learn!,"My 15 year old teens wanted to visit this site for their birthday. It blew us all away. Fascinating look into the history of incarceration up through present day issues. The stabilization and preservation of this historic prison is a overwhelming project - but they are doing a wonderful job. The self guided tour is well thought out & additional theme based mini-tours are available on the grounds.Also there were artist installations, enough variety for everyone. I don’t think young children would enjoy it. It’s a bit emotionally exhausting by the end - as it should be. I totally recommend it -plan for at least a 3 hour visit."
174,Well worth every penny....even for kids,The Eastern State Prison offers a guided tour which you have to book in advance or a leisure self guided audio tour. I took the audio tour. Prompts easy to follow. Tour was very informative and stories told in inmates on voices was a nice touch.
175,nice place if you like prisons,"We stopped here on our recent visit to Philly. It was a great visit that we had not originally planned to visit. Haunting and informative visit. We opted not to take the audio guide and stayed about an hour after we had already had a very long, touristy day. I am sure the audio guide would have been extra informative."
176,Interesting place,"I absolutely love a good scare and this place is really good for that. Apparently, it’s already haunted which makes it that much better. But I have to admit that the art that goes into the people that make this place fun is phenomenal! There was a guy walking around that looked like his chest was exposed to show a beating heart! To this day I can’t figure out how they did it but it was really cool to see. Expect lines around Halloween. I need to come back during the day for a tour."
177,Tour of penitentiary ,Philadelphia history at its finest.  Well worth visiting.  Dress for weather but outside of that it’s a cool place to visit!
178,Fun to explore,"We had a little extra time in Philly, and decided to visit ESP.  It was really neat to see what the first penitentiary in the country looked like, but creepy at the same time (it's basically in ruins, with areas you cannot enter, as they are not safe).  We opted to do the live tour, rather than the audio tour.  Our guide was interesting and engaging and we definitely got more out of it that just doing the audit tour."
179,Halls of Horror,"Awesome experience, fun haunted house. Definitely buy the separately ticketed Speakeasy ticket, super cool, you get to explore the cells and drink alcohol."
180,Fright night at Eastern State Penitentiary!,"It's not the most well preserved prison, but it actually lends to the authenticity. Very minimally ""staged"" areas, while the rest has been left as was and adds the depressing, ambiance of sorts... in a great way. The audio tour is extremely in depth and on point! Large facility with much of it open to the public. I'm a die hard so I would have loved to be there at night or allowed into some more areas. I was visiting from Wyoming, this was at the top of my list & did not disappoint!! Also great for photography enthusiasts who enjoy the darker subjects.  Will be back with the family!"
181,Eastern State Penitentiary ,"Eastern State was well worth the time we spent there. It was raining the day we visited and I think that added to the experience. You really got an idea of how dark the cells could get when there wasn’t any sunlight coming through the skylights. There was a detailed audio tour, a great map, and lots of detail on signs throughout the site."
182,Interesting ,"We arrived on a rainy Friday morning and this place does the trick. It's horribly creepy. Make full use of your audio guide. Many of the cells, corridors, and even outsides are grey, cold and ugly. And then there's Al Capone's cell, which is another story...........As depressing as this jail is, you will learn a lot about penitentiaries and there are plenty of other visitors to bring you back to reality.  How to say it, depressing and fun at the same time!"
183,Interesting and educational,This prison was a fascinating visit to make while we were in Philadelphia. We spent around 1.5hours there but could have spent longer. The newer exhibit about the future of prisons was fascinating. They were advertising nighttime tours when we were there which I imagine would be very spooky as the building itself and the stories within it are pretty creepy! I’d recommend this to anyone visiting Philly.
184,Our first time going,Very good audio guide.  the visit  it is interesting to see different ideas of how a jail should be and changes across the years.
185,Step back in time,"I knew heading into our trip that this was one of my must see attractions, however it exceeded my expectations and we spent longer here then I had allotted and could have stayed even further if we didn't have other time constraints. We started the day by picking up the Philly Phlash bus at the stop closest to our hotel near the convention center. It was packed and we were smashed together standing room only. Many of the people got off at the ESP stop. It was a short walk from the bus stop to the entrance. We had a coupon for a dollar or two off admission. We paid the ticket price, got our audio guides and maps, and we were off. The audio guides provided a ton of very interesting information and I found them easy to use and well documented as to when to turn them on.The facility is a mixture of ruins and areas that have been renovated for tourists to visit. I thought this dichotomy was excellently achieved and provided a real sense of the history they were attempting to evoke. As you will learn from the reading material, there were plans to demolish the penitentiary and turn it into shopping and housing. I am glad it was preserved so that people can visit it and see what it once was.There is a guided tour you can take as well as mini guides/talks of certain areas. We only managed to catch one about the hospital facilities, but it was incredibly interesting and the docent was very knowledgeable. There is a small room off of one of the spokes which allows you to get air conditioning and charge your phone while watching movie clips. Once you are finished you turn in your audio guides and proceed back the way you entered. We were stopped by a worker with a tablet and asked if we would complete a survey about our visit, which we did. As with most attractions, you can visit a gift shop as you exit. The shop was very small and very crowded. This was my favorite attraction on our trip to Philadelphia and I would heartily recommend."
186,A must stop,"The other reviews pretty much tell the story so I'll just say that we are very glad we visited ESP. Every staff member we interacted with, (except one), was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The going can be quite uneven, mobility device users may want to check with them before visiting."
187,Super Cool and Interesting,This is a very interesting place to visit.Lots to learn and lots to see.I highly recommmend. I was also here once many years ago for their halloween event that was really a lot of fun.
188,Not a site I would have expected to be so interesting ,Totally recommend for the fright enthusiast! Wow! It got me! Definitely scary andyou must enter at your own risk.  This definitely sets the spirit for Halloween!Be prepared for ghoulish creatures and monsters to be lurking as you walk throughthis haunted prison.  After the tour you can stop in at Al Capone's speakeasy fora much needed drink.  His jail cell was the most elaborate of all the cells.  Interesting.You could even have your fortune told!
189,Awesome ,"I read about this place online before our trip to Philadelphia but was unsure of what to expect. Overall, my family enjoyed the audio tour and exploring the penitentiary.  I really never thought about the different prison system models, so we learned a lot during our visit. Some of the property is preserved...some is not. I still can’t believe this property remains standing in downtown Philly.  Definitely worth a visit!"
190,Unbelievable!,One of the best visits on our Philadelphia holiday. We were there late October and the weren't many visitors.Quite spooky and chilling walking around and looking into the derelict cells.Make sure to take the audio guide device as this give you so much more detail than you could get from just waking around.
191,Worth the Visit,This was such an interesting visit.  Highly recommend.  You’ll get to see the conditions prisoners faced in the era before electricity and hygiene.
192,Very Interesting,"During the day they have tours that take you to different cells and you get to see the remnant of what this penitentiary once was. At night they have the ""terror behind the walls"" which is a Halloween haunted attraction which is also pretty fun. I've done both more than once and enjoyed it"
193,A lot more interesting than I would have thought!!,There is so much to do and to see at this location. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. I will definitely be back again for both their Halloween experience and to learn more about the history.
194,Goal Visit,I was shocked at the conditions and the stories of the prison.  My only regret is that we didn't have more time there.  Very Educational.
195,First Tour in Philly!,"it was a weird new experience , it is going to be nice for people who enjoy this mysterious kind of  adventures."
196,Amazing and Foreboding,"I thought this would be a hokey museum mostly focused on Al Capone's cell, but it was really detailed and well done. Some of it is so hard to believe, you really need to be there to see it for yourself. It's informative without being ghoulish."
197,Really neat old prison..,"I wasn’t really expecting to enjoy it when I went in as I’m not a fan of anything historical but was surprised that I actually found it interesting. I would highly recommend using the audio tour but after you have finished the tour there’s more information you can listen to but I didn’t find any of the additional information that interesting. It’s most famous for one of its inmates: Alcapone. The section on him is right at the end and is easy to miss, which I did, so once your finished make sure you do that."
198,An eye opener,What a great place. It's amazing to walk through the cell blocks and to imagine what life was like for the prisoners.  You can walk in some of the cells. The audio tour is well done and definitely helps describe what you are seeing. Well worth the trip and time.
199,History,"While in Philly we wanted to share ESP with our 2 kids as they had watched the ""ghost adventure"" episode featuring the prison. It had been awhile since hubby and I had visited, they've done quite a bit of sprucing up, however there is still ALOT Of construction that seems to be going on. The self guided tour was as I remembered, but the kids did get bored near the end. All in it was a good experience, and interesting to hear how it was used."
200,Cool piece of hostory,"Easy access with the Phlash buses in the city. But, it can be hard to see everything with younger kids (4 year old and younger) as the place is older and un-even floors and entries."
201,Interesting history,Not bad had a great time. Definitely buy the vip. Quick pass tickets. The line is very long without the VIP. I think it would be ten times scarier I you had to walk through that old prison by yourself with just an old fashioned low light flashlight. It's a creepy old haunted building
202,A prison everyone should see and experience,"If you like ghost hunting shows, this is your place.  If you like photography this is your place.  Everywhere you look is just so cool.  We did the guided tour at 2:00, but you can get there earlier and look around on your own, then do the group tour.  Also, there are certain times during the day that a staff member will take you to areas that are not included in open public areas, like the hospital wing.  Do as many of those as you can.  We stayed there for 3 hours.  Highly recommend. No orbs in my pics :)"
203,Must see attraction in Philadelphia,"Eastern State Penitentiary is a must-do visit if you’re in Philly! This haunting but fascinating former prison refined the revolutionary system of separate incarceration, and housed criminals such as Al Capone. For $16 USD, you receive entry to the prison and an audio set to guide you around the site. I spent a good 90 minutes exploring all of the prison, which was simply fascinating, despite being slightly eery!"
204,A transforming experience,"We stopped here on our 4th of July weekend visit to Philly.  The place was included in our sightseeing package so we didn’t have to pay extra to see it.  When you check in the give you an audio player with headphones and allow you to do a self guided tour.  We spent about an hour and half doing the regular audio tour, and then my wife and teenage daughter proceeded to tour the rest of the prison and listen to the rest of the information on the audio guide.  What an interesting place."
205,Wonderfully creepy. Try to come on a bad weather day!,Fun Place if you Like History and exploring!! I been here a dozen times (history teacher you know) with students and family.
206,Creepy but AWESOME!!!!,There's not too much to be said of a visit here except it truly is an outstanding experience. The history is amazing. The way different parts of the buildings are in very different levels of disrepair is astonishing. If you're in Philly for one day this is place to go to.
207,Must see!!!,"This is a terrific and fascinating piece of history!  don't miss it, I have been 3 times over 2 years and each time I learn something new.The audio tour is simply excellent, you will leave with a lot of insights.  It is a powerfully impactful site to visit.  I have had the opportunity to speak with a few of the guides and have found them to be friendly and engaging and more than willing to share any and all knowledge.  This is a great place to take out of town guests - it is so unique!"
208,One of the best Halloween attractions,My first time here and it did not disappoint. I would reccomend the upgrade  ticket you enter very quickly and dont have to wait in the long lines.Tons of FUN!!!!
209,100% worth it,"A group of us educators in town for a conference had a morning free and visited this penitentiary. My few takeaways include: what an incredible accomplishment of construction when it was built, what a transformation of its use during the decades that followed, and what a great last second save to keep it from being destroyed. Yes, the place needs some serious upkeep. I would also consider removing some of the worst areas to provide for more interpretative areas and visiting center conveniences, cafeteria, museum, more restoration, etc. This tour is pause for personal refection on the entire concept of the purpose of incarceration. If the walls could talk. Do not miss out on this attraction."
210,Fantastic,"I've been to Philadelphia a few times and done pretty much all of the historical things so has my friend who is here with me. We saw this had top reviews so decided to give it a try. It was really interesting - the history, the architecture, etc. It gets you thinking about the whole prison issue in general as you conclude the tour. My interested in this place was unexpected. I'm glad we went!They are currently doing some remodeling so the ""box office"" is a black trailer a few feet down by the entrance. Dress warm in cold weather because most of the tour is not in heated areas."
211,The original big house,"On a rare business trip, had the chance to visit the eastern state penitentiary in Philadelphia.  Tickets through the hotel concierge were only 9 dollars as opposed to 16 at the venue, so worth checking this out.The building is impressive and has the aura of a mediaeval castle from Europe.  Stepping in gives an insight into this particular model of incarceration, the inequity of race and gender and how skewed it has always been against people of colour.  The cells are ruined, but stepping into them gives a feeling of claustrophobia, which you can imagine being in your cell for 23 hours a day would be soul destroying.The prison is open to the elements, and you can only imagine the extreme heat in the summer as well as the bitterly cold winter months, the prison is fairly small and with the audio tour, narrated by the fabulous Steve buscemi, is informative, with lots of side elements you can listen to.Most of the prison is off limits due to the nature of dangerous masonry and general decay of the years since it closed down.Well worth a visit for an hour or 2, with a quaint gift shop as you enter/leave, don't expect Alcatraz and you won't be disappointed"
212,East State Penitentiary,Would come again. Very interesting to learn about how prisoners were treated. Audio guided tour made it convenient to view different parts of the prison. There’s a charging station where you can also sit and rest in a small area. Bathrooms are somewhat clean and located outside of the prison. Whole tour takes about an hour to complete.
213,Great visit!!,Interesting info however the main audio tour is too short and leaves out several pieces. If you continue on your own there is an option to play the other sites on the tour but not clear that there is so much more to see.
214,Fascinating Museum,3 of us and we took about 2 hours to tour this magical haunted beautiful place ... I have been wanting to see many years and now off the bucket list!!! So cool and informative and would recommend
215,Summer trip,I may not have found any ghosts but I sure learned a lot. It’s amazing how the men and women both shared the same prison. Some women prisoners even got pregnant. There were escapee’s and riots. You have got to tour this prison!!! Maybe you can find a ghost!!
216,Exceptional exhibits,Great spot for something different to do... You get an insight into that hard and terrible life.  The audio tour is informative and easy to follow... A private tour will get you into places you otherwise cannot go into.. Bring a camera this place is a photographers dream... Takes about 2 3 hours... Many little spots to eat around thr Penitentiary itself. Do it you wont be disappointed..
217,Full of information,"Our whole family (including kids ages 14, 11, and 7) enjoyed our time here.  Showed up at 10:30am and walked right in using our City Pass CityPass.  The main tour (audio guide with Steve Buscemi narration) lasted about 45 minutes.  You can then walk around as long as you would like. We spent about another 30 minutes, but we probably could’ve stayed even longer, but we wanted to get on to something else.  The reason our group rated this only 4 stars instead of 5 are:  cleanliness (LOTS of dust); and some in our group questioned the premise of the attraction and whether it should be preserved.  With that said, the section about America’s over-incarceration of its population was very well done."
218,Educational and enjoyable.,"Very informative, however, there was a woman who worked there who told me to keep my hands off a light switch (I didn't even know I put my hand on it).  So, that was kind of stupid.  But, it was a very informative place and even in the rain, you did not get wet indoors.  We went in the morning so there weren't any ghosts hanging out just yet."
219,Steve Buscemi Lead The Way!,Very interesting place and well worth the visit. It's been done well and you feel you get your monies worth. We were there for 3 hrs and could have stayed longer.
220,A different way to spend the day,"Rich history in this beautifully preserved building. So much to see and learn from inside of America's first penitentiary.  I can usually easily express my like or dislike for any attraction but my love for this place just cant be explained that simply.  Go see it, go tour it, take it in, learn from our country's history.  The place is amazing and the staff was great. Don't miss this tour!"
221,Very interesting experience,"This was a spontaneous visit. I had no idea eastern state penitentiary was In Philadelphia (I know). When I realized this, I made this my first go to. Definitely worth a visit. You get a headset for the personal tour, very informative. The headset lasts a good 45min, after that you’re able to walk through other corridors."
222,Fab visit,This place was amazing and has full potential of being better. The place is run down and in need of refurbishment but this doesn't stop it being a very informative place to visit and an eye opener to the amount of people in Prison. This is a must see attraction
223,Must see,"Very interesting history. Good audio tour. Cold in the winter so dress appropriately! Additional exhibits unrelated to Eastern State available to view - when my friend and I visited there were readings/discussions of letters by MLK, Jr., as well as artists' installations on site. Throughout the day they offer numerous mini-tours/lectures by guides in various locations around the penitentiary. One guide never showed to one of the tours we wanted to participate in, but all the others showed and they were well-informed and very enthusiastic. Really enjoyed this supplemental information to the audio tour. You can leave to go get lunch then return to finish your tour if you'd like - just be sure to get your hand stamped on the way out. Well worth a visit! Really enjoyed it."
224,"Nice to visit, but not to stay...","This was a pretty good attraction. We went when it was cold outside though, so it was definitely still cold inside. I’d recommend assuming you’re going to be exposed to whatever temperature it is outside for the whole time. They are working on renovations and things. I’d go again."
225,Everything and more!,"Had heard about this place from others, so on a recent visit to Philadelphia we stopped in to see the joint (pun intended).  Our family found it very interesting - as they have some cells of the building returned to their original design (originally was solitary confinement), as well as other cells that reflect the renovations where multiple prisoners were housed in a single cell.  They review the different approaches to prisons (NY model vs PA model), and their purposes.  They also have a great deal of information on prison populations in different countries, and comparisons between countries with and without the death penalty, etc...  It was very interesting in a great many ways, and we all found ourselves challenged in some of our assumptions and attitudes.  It's a good attraction, and most people will emerge better informed and hopefully giving it some thought."
226,Really cool,Great tour and very interesting place.Could not imagine having to spend any jail time in cells like those.
227,Amazing experience about law enforcement & corrections in the United States,"I thought this would be a nice attraction and that we all would learn something. Not only did everyone enjoy themselves, learn more than we thought we would, in addition we all left with a new conversation about the penal system and how society can benefit from looking at this again. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable as well!"
228,Enough to make you stay out of prison ,"Well worth a visit if in the area.  A lot of history behind those thick walls!  I also can't recommend terror behind the walls enough if you are visiting around Halloween, it is scary!"
229,Awesome Tour!,"Ever since I heard about Eastern State Penitentiary years ago, I have wanted to visit and it didn't disappoint. I was a little concerned that, in an understandable effort to attract visitors, they would play up the touristy, sensational aspects, such as Al Capone. Although he is a feature, the  museum is much more about the history (and present status) of criminal justice and incarceration. The audio tour (narrated by Steve Buscemi) and pop-up exhibits ask tough, thought-provoking questions about why prisons exist, whether reform works, how mass incarceration came to be, and how the history of Eastern State sheds light on these subjects. I particularly liked the first-person oral histories from former inmates and guards and the interactive ""confess to a crime"" exhibit. These were very moving. Fortuitously, I came on a cold, gray rainy day, which enhanced the experience of visiting this urban ruin. Note that most of Eastern State is unheated and was intentionally left in a decrepit state, having been abandoned almost 50 years ago. This is not a place for kids or anyone with claustrophobia, but it must be seen."
230,Great Time,"Impressive work to share history of prison and to present current issues with incarceration as well.  Our guide, Tori, who does many of the short tours, seemed pretty disinterested in sharing much.  She even described one tour as ""underwhelming""."
231,Awesome tour,If you have never been in a prison this will give an appreciation of what prison life was like and probably still is (although with possible better amenities) . The visit causes one to think if our idea of massive rates of incarceration (the highest in the world) is the only correct solution to the problem of  of reducing crime.
232,Enjoyed a lot! ,"Very interesting self guided tour of 142 year old prison.When you consider the men and women that did time here, the conditions they lived in, the everyday schedule, it is an amazing story to hear. I feel like it was well worth the price of admisson.of 14 dollars.I spent about 2 hours here but probably could have spent another for everything available to see and read.They have a Halloween tour that I bet is scary and not for the weak of heart. Not for me."
233,"Interesting and Fun, We Learned Alot About the History of the Prison System","Allow yourself at least 2 hours if not more to visit  it, Some of the cells was giving us creeps. If you visit it during vintner time, dress properly, they don’t have too many heated spaces inside."
234,Exceeded Our Expectations,Overall good place shows you the timeline history of when the prison was first built to it being shutdown great place for tourist to check out
235,Fun stop,"It is my second best visit in my whole life.  The first was the Museum at Hiroshima, Japan. It is a must see attraction to visit in Philadelphia.  Take the time to read about the prisoners incarcerated in US.  There is a lot to think and reflect on the kind of society we want and deserve."
236,Interesting and Unexpected ,"Without a doubt one of the most underrated attractions in Philly. It was incredibly fascinating, informative, and a must see! It's a very reasonable price and there are also coupons online."
237,History,"This is a must-see for Philly. I didn't do the Halloween deal, but I gotta imagine that is crazy good. Al Capone's cell was one of the coolest things I've seen in Philly. You gotta go."
238,Very interesting place to visit,"My hubby and I stopped in on a day date in Philly. I loved visiting the penitentiary and seeing how it was established. Learning about the conditions and how things worked prior to technology. The listening tour was great, and so was the hospital tour given by the staff member. I loved all the textures of how the building was decomposing."
239,"We all enjoyed ESP - adults, teens and 8 yr old",It was an eye opener for sure.  Very surreal to imagine how these prisoners lived. Being in complete solitary day and night with no electricity. I can see why they saw its haunted. Makes me feel sorry for the prisoners back in the day.
240,Really cool and interesting,"We squeezed a lot of things into one day in Philly and this was by far the favorite of our whole family (mom, dad, 3 girls ages 15, 12, and 7). The audio information was extremely well done and was a fantastic way to give information about the Penitentiary. We loved that it was self paced and we could all start the next audio track at the same time. We even discovered extra tracks at the end of the main tour that told more about the place. We went on a weekday so it wasn’t crowded at all. We spent about 2 hours there but could have definitely spent more time. The place is hauntingly beautiful in its various states of ruin. Some parts have been restored so that you can see what it looked like in its original days. The goal of Eastern State was not to punish but to reform, which was a new method at that time. It began with having each prisoner in complete isolation. Even the kids completely enjoyed touring this place. It is most definitely worth the price and a must see."
241,Must see in philadelphia,I know a lot of visitors to Philly have limited time and may pass on a visit to Eastern but they are doing so at a risk to their own entertainment. I was here for a conference and decided to take this attraction is and found it to be very interesting. The interpretation is very well done and it appears they offer a strong range of programming throughout the year. Have been to Alcatraz and other jails (just visiting) and find this prison to be right at the top for a solid experience. Not sure if I would want to spend the night there in solitary but then again?
242,A little eerie but very interesting,"For those looking for a reconstructed or restored facility, look elsewhere. This is a cold, drafty penitentiary that presents itself in a realistic way. The audio tour is very good, but the guided tour is excellent. There is a lot to see here, and a few hours could be spent here easily."
243,Awesome family outing!,"Great piece of city history in which to learn about part of American culture and identity not often talked about. Just about everyone knows Alcatraz, but this place is worth a visit as well."
244,Very Interesting ,"I feel like myself and others, who have never experienced a maximum security prison or prison at all, have a curiosity of what it would be like to live in one for years. The isolation, loneliness locked in a small room. Honestly, not for me. Like they say, don’t do the crime if u can’t do the time."
245,Very interesting,An amazing time in history that should be on your Philadelphia sites see. Built back in 1826 is one of the oldest east coast prisons. We spent 4 hrs there and used there walk around talking headphones.To think this prison before shutting down in 1971 had a capacity of 1800 inmates and in solitary confinement. And has store available to sell books and memorabilia.
246,Very cool way to spend a day,"Eastern State Penitentiary was my favorite site in Philadelphia (tied with Independence Hall.  But two totally different experiences.  You need to do them both!).  I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with Eastern State Penitentiary, but since we are history buffs, and since it was so highly rated on TA, we decided to check it out while we were in Philadelphia the week of July 4th.  We actually went ON the 4th of July!  (It was one of the few sites open that day!).  And wow -- we were not disappointed!  We spent about half a day there. We were easily able to walk from our hotel in Rittenhouse Square.  It was a pleasant walk -- it probably took us about 25 or 30 minutes to get there.  As others have mentioned, the site is not temperature-controlled nor is it fully enclosed (there are holes in the crumbling ceilings as well as exterior portions of the site), so be sure to dress appropriately.  Since we were there on a sunny day in July, we found the temperature inside to be pleasant, but on rainy, cold days, it might not be so pleasant. We did not purchase tickets ahead of time but had no trouble purchasing them on-site.  It wasn't terribly crowded, perhaps due to the holiday, and that was fine by us!  They do offer guided tours, but those apparently sell out well ahead of time; the audio tour was outstanding, though.  One of the best audio tours I've ever done.  And there were staff members stationed throughout the facility to answer questions.  We didn't have a ton of questions, though, because the audio tour was so thorough.  The stops along the audio tour are clearly marked and easy to find.  The basic audio tour takes about 45 minutes, but there are tons of ""extra"" stops you can do after the basic tour, and we did them all!!  That ended up taking a couple of hours, and it was so worth it!  Every stop was interesting.  If you have the time, I highly recommend doing all of the additional stops on the audio tour.  Many of the best, most insightful stories are on the ""extra"" stops.The basic tour begins chronologically, in the oldest part of the prison.  That corridor has been refurbished to give a sense of what it would have been like in the early 19th century, when the penitentiary first opened.  It was actually started by a group of reformers who thought that prisoners had the best chance of truly reforming by being in complete isolation.  So these cells were ""solitary confinement"" in every sense of the word.  The group who planned the penitentiary considered themselves to be compassionate, though, and they didn't just stick prisoners in solitary confinement and expect them to magically reform.  They believed they needed to be productive, so the prisoners engaged in (solitary) trades, such as furniture making.  They were permitted to read the Bible (that would help them with the penitence), and they were given fresh air twice a day in their solitary exercise yards, which were attached to the back of each interior cell.  They were, however, strictly kept away from other prisoners, and even the prison guards just passed food to them through a small hatch, so there really was no opportunity for the prisoners to see or interact with anyone during their confinement.  That, as we know in hindsight, was not the best method of reforming them, and eventually the managers of the prison figured that out. That first part of the tour was one of the most fascinating -- learning the history and seeing the cells and exercise yards in their original state.The other corridors of the prison have not been renovated and were left ""as is"" when the prison was abandoned in the 1970's.  That in itself makes for a fascinating glimpse into history.  The furnishings are left just as they were the day the prison was abandoned.  Walls and ceilings are crumbling.  Only a few areas have been refurbished, such as Al Capone's cell, which is decorated to look as it might have when he stayed there.Again, it's the stories that make the prison fascinating.  Learning about the men, women, and juveniles who were interred there is both eye-opening and interesting.  There are horrific stories, humorous stories, some social commentary (i.e. prison reform), and just really insightful glimpses into the evolution of the prison, of society, and of our culture.The prison, which looks like an imposing medieval fortress, is laid out in a ""hub and spoke"" pattern, with numerous corridors radiating off of a central circular room.  You are free to roam about, and the audio tour stops can be done in any order.  We spent a long time at the site, roaming about, backtracking, listening to the audio tour stops, visiting the outdoor areas, etc.There have been several successful (sort of) escapes from the prison, and learning about those was really interesting.There is a small gift shop, which we visited on our way out.I highly recommend a visit to Eastern State Penitentiary.  Be sure to allow adequate time -- at least a couple of hours, more if you really want to go in-depth.  The site is really unlike any other I've visited and is well worth a few hours of your time."
247,Interesting history,"We took our kids here while on a family vacation. The kids are 6, 11, and 13 and they really enjoyed it. There were a lot of cool things to see and the audio tour kept the kids interested."
248,First timer,"Usually jail is not a place you wish to enter, this one is “must see” on any Philadelphia visit. Fascinating stories, well designed audio guide, interesting for any history lover place. Little bit too much of leftish propaganda at the end, but it’s their right to think so"
249,Prison tour,"This was a real eye opener, and very informative. When this first opened all the prisioners stayed silent! If not the punishment was unthinkable! The audio that went with the walk around was most interesting and I'm not going to give all the secrets away it really is a place to visit."
250,Interesting,"This penitentiary is one of the older ones and has a feel similar to Alcatraz.  At the moment, self-guided audio tours are available and are very well put together.  A lot of the structures are in rough shape but that’s what makes it cool.  Tours are reasonably priced and there’s a lot to see including one of Al Capone’s cells!"
251,Penn tour,"Amazing trip. We arrived at approximately 1 pm and made our way inside of the penitentiary. We were greeted by several staff members who gave us audio sets for the self guided portion of the tour. We also opted to do the guide-led tour and discussion, which lasted approximately an hour and provided more in-depth information about the history and significance of the penitentiary. There were several informational plaques located throughout the penitentiary, along with select numbers that allowed us to listen to the audio portion. The penitentiary was very well put together and the stories we heard were absolutely jaw dropping! I highly recommend this trip!Tip: I recommend spending 3 hours here if you truly want to see everything."
252,Easy self guided tours,"Very interesting piece of history that is creepy and beautiful at the same time.  Walking down each cell block was so eerie...seeing the beds and furniture as they were left.  Only a little restoration was done to parts of this prison, so most things are left as-is.  Al Capone's cell was very cool!  This was not on our list to do, but we had time to kill and decided to see it and I'm so very glad we did!  Highly recommend..."
253,Curious about Eastern State Penitentiary,We visited the penitentiary on a couples visit to Philadelphia late in the day and although I was not originally interested in going to visit this site in Philadelphia it turned out to be a very interesting late stop on our trip. The penitentiary is mostly a run down institution that offers for about $14.00 per person a good look into what jails were like until the 1970s. The price of entry includes a audio aid that provides the visitors with a good understanding of this jails history. They even have a spooky night tour available late in the evenings. If you visit Philadelphia you can make this a tour stop and there is parking next door.
254,CURIOSITY VISIT,"Hope the title attracts you ! Eastern State Penitentiary in Philly - imposing as you drive up to the site...imposing, brutal, towering.....what's inside ? You enter thru thick walls and get an audio tour which lasts about 1/2 hour but take your time as you view the cells, walk around, and soak in the feel of the place. This was a PENITENTIARY in every sense of the word. Part of the reform movement at the time. Instead of the prisoners being locked up together; the prisoners had individual cells. The prisoners would enter from outside into their cells and their limited contact to the outside was thru food doors from the central corridors.Abandoned in the 1970's...it's crumbling, strange, a sort of quiet even when others are around, disturbing to the soul -think of the people spending theirs lives in here...days and days and months into years of solitude.If you can picture monk cells with vaulted ceilings, cramped, little furniture - you get the idea of what the prisoners faced."
255,Really Fascinating!,"Thishuge crumbling structure is maintained by volunteers.  It deserves to be, as it was where the idea of prison as a reform rather than just punishment was invented.  OK, it did not work as planned, but it is certainly interesting.  Most of the place is derelict and you can only, really, visit a rather limited bit.The real eye opener is the display in the grounds at the end showing the growth on the US prison population, the clear imbalance of over representation of African Americans in prison, and how, compared with any other country in the world, civilised, harsh  or whatever, USA leads by an unassailable amount. As most of it is privatised and in the hands of the big business influencers, we should not expect much change, there.  It was a sobering display."
256,A prison you want to enter!,Little has changed at Eastern State and this really gives you a glimpse into what it would have been like.  Have heard that their Halloween events are spectacular.
257,Really cool place!,"As a family involved in local government, community supervision, and law enforcement, this was a very educational experience. Surprising to hear how the term Penitentiary was coined (it probably shouldn't have been but it was). Regardless of your view of the current corrections processes in the US, this is an eye opening exhibit. We still have a ways to go but the history is good to know."
258,"History, history!","This old penitentiary was in the vanguard back in the 1800’s and many prisons followed its policies of isolation and severe treatment until someone finally realized this was not a way of rehabilitation. I totally recommend the self guided tour. It is very organized wearing headphones and pressing the number to listen to the information. We thought we would stay an hour and ended up staying more than three. It was captivating, interesting and educational. Highly recommended. ( buy tickets on line)."
259,Favorite Philly Attraction,Wild part of history.  All the lessons we've learned and hopefully do not repeat our mistakes.  Heard its amazing  during Halloween.
260,My teen boys enjoyed this!,This place is dark its creepy it's awesome you get to walk the halls in Americas first jail you get to see Al Capones jail cell it looks today as it did then it's simply Amazing.
261,Very Surprised!!!,"E.S.P. was cool. It's a huge prison that takes the span of a whole entire block,  i was amazed. It felt a little haunted but it was interesting to see how tiny the cells were and how many were housed at the penitentiary. I kind of felt sad for the prisoners, the cells were like solitary confinement cells.We took the tour bus to the Penitentiary and it dropped us off at the coroner and we just walked up the block. My newphew liked it sort of, but overall it was a great place to visit."
262,A must for family with kids. ,"After doing Terror Behind the Walls (which is AMAZING!) 2 years ago, my husband and I couldn't wait to get back to Philly to do the daytime tour.  I think we might have been expecting too much, because it was really just OK.  After the initial excitement of being there wore off, everything really started to look the same...crumbly, broken, overgrown and gross.  To say nothing of the fact that it was over 100 degrees the day we were there...Also, the photography group who seemed to think that they had first dibs on any good shots and that the other people trying to get pictures were just bothersome got on my last damn nerve.  Taking 5 minutes to take one picture is ridiculous, especially when there are a lot of other people who just want a quick snap.  They should run this tour separately if they are all this arrogant. (Vent over...but really, they were all kind of jerks!!)"
263,Super interesting!! ,"The building was the world's first large scale prison and offered in each cell running water, flush toilets and central heating --  when even U.S. presidents still had no such luxuries.The building's design reflected a Quaker approach:  encouraging repentance through solitude and communion with nature.Later on, it was converted to today's common format with shared cells and large group work shops.Al Capone had a cell there, still luxuriously furnished.And to meet and promote inmate spirituality, a church and now restored synagogue where included.The museum/exhibit center has interactive activities and traces imprisonment around the world as does its massive outdoor comparison bar chart sculpture. All make the same point: U.S. incarceration numbers are far, far greater than any other country on Earth and legal reform is needed."
264,Oh my word what a way to live!,"Came for 2 reasons - terror behind the walls and daytime viewing of a delapidated prison.Terror behind the walls was fun. Not too scary for me since there were so many people around and I chose not to get the necklace that allows the actors to touch you. I did find myself running at times but also laughing. I screamed at the most stupid things like puffs of air.We went during opening weekend so the lines were crazy. They have separate lines for each time slot. We waited an hour outside to get in. Seemed like people just kept showing up for the 9pm time slot line even though it was well past 9. We had the 9:30 slot and were first in that line. There were creepy costumed guys scaring the people waiting in line.The next day I enjoyed the self guided tour of the prison which is narrated by Steve Buscemi and others. Very easy to follow the narration and stopping points along the way. We saw Al Capone's old cell which has been recreated to look like it was when he lived there. Several artists did some work inside some cells, including a whole car that must have been disassembled and reassembled inside. I hoped to see some ghosts in my photos but no dice."
265,Very interesting and informative tour of one of the oldest penitentiaries in the country.,"I did not have this on our itinerary initially, but I am so glad that we didn't miss it.  The audio tour is fascinating and quick moving.  The building is really interesting and creepy.  So many stories and information.  My kids, 14,11 and 8 enjoyed as well."
266,So much history! ,"This is not the most famous historical site in Philadelphia but it has to rank as one of the most interesting.  The prison was built almost 200 years ago and closed about 50 years ago.  The building, looming like a giant castle or fortress, now stands in partial ruins with a haunted air.  We took one of the guided tours and I was glad we did.  Our guide was terrific - extremely knowledgeable (and we did ask questions!) and a great story teller.  He also made us think, asking us questions and leading us into discussions.  The founders of the prison were reformers but their theory of keeping prisoners isolated fell far short of the goal of reform.  As you tour, imagine being in an isolated state in this building or even working here as a guard.  Easy to understand why reform did not occur.  I was able to use the self-guided audio tour to visit some of sites not included on the guided tour but I could have spent additional time exploring. (We were there a total of 2 hours or so)  The building was chilly during my November visit so dress accordingly (I was glad I kept my jacket on) and wear comfortable shoes.  There is a gift shop - good book selection as well as t-shirts and other souvenirs,  Apparently, the site hosts a haunted house event during the Halloween season, keep that in mind if you visit that time of year.  Highly recommend this site!"
267,Great Visit,"Not sure what the hype about this place was but I did not get it. Not much to see. Excited to see Al Capone cell but they are not ever sure its his. Place was not restored it is just a rotting, destoryed place with a sad story. I do not recommend for kids"
268,Fun Place if you Like History and exploring!!,Just not my cup of tea. I guess the audio tour may be interesting if you are genuinely wanting to know about the prison history.  I felt bored the whole time.
269,Super cool!,"Great place to visit and learn a thing or two.... actually lots more about American penal system, stories of some not pleasant individuals and just walk through the walls of history. It was great to visit a place like that and see why you wouldn't want to ""stay"" there."
270,Cool visit!,"This abandoned penitentiary, once the home to Al Capone and others, is a must-see if you're going to be in the Philadelphia area.  The parking lot is right next to the prison and easy to get in and out of.  The narrated tour is excellent and gives a lot of history about the institution while you are walking around.  You are free to stop at any time to take pictures or read about the inmates and the history of the building.  There are a lot of cool photo ops here!"
271,The inmates stories stick in mind,To think people spent 23 hours a day in a small cell with no windows and doors for years is crazy!!!!  You really get a good feel for how it was for the prisoners.
272,Very worthwhile and authentic ,"Whether you’re a photographer, a philosopher, an activist, or a tourist, you’ll find this a provocative and interesting place to visit. The Liberty Bell is a symbol, but so is this place. Worth your time. I came with 4 teenaged girls — not during Halloween — and they all left with a lot to talk about."
273,Very Interesting,"A spectacular peek into history.  I am at a loss for words there is so much to be absorbed here.  The grandness, the evolution of society and how culture has changed...yet stayed the same.  Recommend.  Took 11yr old grandson, he was captivated.  Dress for the weather, not climate controlled and many open areas."
274,Hauntingly Incredible,"Bad time to go - Labor Day Weekend! The traffic to get there was horrible . . . but well worth the wait. The penitentiary itself was FABULOUS!!! Quite educational in the history of corrections. Artists even get ""cells"" to do their thing in. Plan on staying longer than the expected 1 hour for the audio tour. There is SO much to see and do within the gothic walls."
275,Fascinating Place,"Took 3 boys: 11,13, and 14. The older boys enjoyed it but we're hot and tired pretty early. The 11 year old really enjoyed the audio tour. If u can, use the bathroom before u get there. Theirs are more like portable potties"
276,Interesting,America can sometimes lack original buildings as museums. Most are relatively new constructions housing artefacts from an earlier era. This Penitentiary is an exception. Great audio guide and related art exhibits within. Highly recommended. Close to city centre.
277,Genuine feeling,"Ever thought that a prison could absorb you for more than 2 hours?  Well, this one can. Alcatraz was notorious, but ESP is virtually unknown to those of us outside a prison system. Yet, ESP was revolutionary.  The curators did an excellent job of connecting the current dilemmas that we experience with this historical experiment.  The audio tour was well done.  The refurbishment of parts of the prison gave much insight to those of us without imaginations.  The stories of Will Sutton and Al Capone added personalities of the noted but shameful.  The audio tales of inmates and guards were edited extremely well.  There were art displays.  My only request for improvement are the toilets that seemed relics from the 1800s and were inadequate for the number of visitors."
278,Interesting ,Lots and lots of history.All who visit philly must go at least once.Al Capone cell is there and you should definedly listen to steve buscemi audio commentary. (im not sure how his last name is written 😄)
279,Well worth a visit,"So where can you freely roam a prison and still see all the disarray of the years?  Why, it would be Eastern State Penitentiary.  You get a wonderful audio tour and it's so informative. The photos you see here are true to form and you even get to go inside old cells and imagine what life could have been like here.This is a great place to take cool photos to impress your friends & do cool social media posts.  It was cold, but there's no central heating. I imagine in the Summer it's extremely hot.You musts go here. It was one of the coolest sites I've been to. There was also a Martin Luther King program going on and it was very informative and interesting.We also got free parking. Just drive around and there's plenty to be had so we didn't have to use the pay lot.  If you liked my review, please let me know & give a thumbs up.  Thanks!"
280,Prison Time,"The Eastern State Penitentiary is redone in a just a few small areas, the rest sits as it did the day it closed. Most of it is open to the public and it is just creepy and you really want to see it.You can take a tour with audio and headphones and Steve Buschemi narrates part of the audio tour. If you don't know who is he, think of movies that are dark and Steve is often the gangster. He is adorable and his voice you will know as soon as you here it. Be prepared to walk a lot, there is tons to cover.You will see Al Capone's cell, which he claimed was very comfortable. It is far from it. Al Capone was a whiskey runner, murderer and otherwise bad guy from Chicago talked about in many US movies. Some of the cells have bars, many have wooden doors. The old plaster and paint is still there and you would not want to spend the night. You will see death row, small cells with bars and the exercise area for some inmates. It really is amazing and you will learn something about the way prisons in the US were run years ago. It is kid friendly, they can run a little ahead of you without being a problem for others. Have fun."
281,Worth your time,"I was not overly interested in going through the penitentiary, however our son in law was greatly interested, so we went. It is the world's first of its nature  and served as a trial experiment for more humane treatment of criminals, which of course did not really prove out. It did, however, evolve over years but was really a nasty experience for the inmates. Not in great shape  now but you can get a really great feeling for what it was."
282,cool tour,"We went on Halloween. Bought the fast pass as the lines went on for more than a couple of blocks. But it was worth it. There were 6 sections. The organizations made sure we did not bunch up, hence the lines. Without giving away anything, I would just say it was done very well. It was creative, varied and professionally done. Highly recommended.I didn't get a chance to see the place in the daylight. I would have loved that too."
283,Must visit !,"This was my husband's choice. I couldn't believe how the criminals were treated back then. But, perhaps if they did the same today criminals would think twice about the consequence of their action."
284,Great learning experience,"Visited Eastern State Penitentiary on a dreary weekday in February.  There were more visitors than I expected, but it wasn't nearly crowded.  While renovations take place to the visitor reception area inside, tickets were being sold from a curbside trailer in front of the facility.  Once tickets were purchased, we walked to the main entrance where we were greeted by pleasant attendants directing us to the check-in area.  There, an audio tour device is provided and we were off.  We thoroughly enjoyed the audio tour, complete with clear signage and landmark guidance.  The audio tour guided us to various areas of interest, told us about life in Eastern State in the earliest days and steered us to some of the most interesting frozen-in-times sites we were hoping for.   And it was all at our own pace - the audio tour picks up as you select the respective numbered tour points, whenever you happen to arrive there.  After the audio tour, I went off on my own to explore parts of the prison which aren't included in the basic audio tour.  Yes, visitors are encouraged to do so!  Areas I found included the death row cells and recreation yard, the infirmary wing and placards describing various points of interest and life in the prison over the centuries.  On this dreary weekday, there were plenty of opportunities to just stop look and listen in silence - no one around, no real sounds - to the echoes of the past.  It was surreal.  Most areas are handicap/wheelchair accessible, though some tour points direct you up stairs and directly back to the starting point.  There are also some tricky doorway thresholds which might be difficult to maneuver in a wheelchair or create a challenge for those with mobility issues.  The restrooms are the real thing - while clean and bright, there have been no renovations since before Eastern State closed decades ago.  Parking is a breeze - free, unlimited-time street parking on two sides of the massive Eastern State complex and a city parking lot immediately next door.  The general tour, including the audio tour, is suitable for mature children.  There's a lot of walking in following the main path of the audio tour, and a lot more if you choose to go out on your own.  Signs warn visitors about areas which contain stories about more ""adult"" issues at the prison.  The tour would probably be too much - too long, too far, maybe too dark - for very young children anyway.  The web site says Eastern State Penitentiary is in a ""semi-ruin"" state.  That's a fact.  But that's what helps to bring you back in time.  All walking surfaces are safe and they did a terrific job of mitigating pretty much all potential hazards while maintaining the fascinating ""semi-ruin"" look of the place.  Absolutely worth the trip into Philly."
285,Educational and Heartbreaking ,Wasn't sure about this stop. But let me tell you well worth it. We took our time and maybe 3 hours to see it all. They furnish you with audio no extra charge like some places but you go at your own pace. Al Capone was there for 1 year or so. But is a lot more than Al stuff. Neat layout.
286,Cool tour!,"Eastern State Penitentiary one of the oldest prisons in the us now been saved from demolition and being brought back to life by volunteer group. The self-guided tour through the different periods and penal systems that have been deployed thought the years is very informative. Yes, this is a work in progress but it is defiantly worth a visit if not just to see Al Capone’s Cell"
287,Absolute Highlight Of Trip,"We were there for around 2 hours but we definitely would have stayed longer had we not needed to get back on our tour bus. ESP is not only informative about the past but about the present as well. I’ve never done an audio self guided tour so I was a bit nervous on how it would turn out but it was easy to manage, lightweight and again, very informative. They’re currently going through construction but it didn’t get in the way of our visit. I also liked the (prisons today) section that gives updated news about the prison systems. If you have a moment to purchase your tickets online you can buy them for a couple bucks cheaper than at the door and if you’re utilizing the hop on hop off tour buses like we did, the drop off/pick up stop is only a 2 minute walk from the prison entrance. Don’t forget to stop by the shop before you leave. The proceeds help preserve the prison."
288,Just OK,"I wasn't sure what to expect, I've seen the ghost investigations on tv but this was such a different experience.  We learned a lot about the history of the prison system, there are exhibits and videos to see. The audio tour was very nice while touring the prison at your own pace. We were there for 2 hours and still didn't see everything. I would suggest going in early Spring or Fall, it was very hot in August and not much of a breeze throughout the prison."
289,Glad I am free!!,"Eastern State Penitentiary is the oldest prison in the United States. This dates back to the 1800s.   When you walk up to the prison the massive walls dwarf you.   When you walk inside it is cold, damp and creepy.  The prison has deteriorated over time, walls are crumbling.  We took the self-guided tour, and with your admission you are given a headset and audio system.  There are about 10 points-of-interest on the self-guided tour.  It took us about 35 minutes to complete.  There are various stops you can make that are not part of the tour. You could spend hours here.  There is so much to learn and see.  I like the self-guided tour because you can go at your own pace and skip stops if you wish.  The tour is narrated by Steve Buscemi and you will hear stories from former prisoners and guards.  When the prison first opened there was one person per cell and prisoners never interacted with each other.  When they first arrived at ESP they had a hood over their heads.  This was a benefit in two ways.  The first was so the prisoners would not get familiar with the lay out of the prison.  The second was so that nobody would recognize you.  They spent 23 hours alone in their cells with no windows or doors.  The only light source was a small skylight.  Food was delivered through a small slot in the wall and they were not allowed to speak to the guards.  They were allowed one hour per day outside.   Each prisoner had their own small outdoor space.  The back of the cell opened up to an individual exercise area with high thick walls.  This is the true meaning of solitary confinement. The operating room was state of the art for its time.  They performed major operations and plastic surgery, among other things.  You will learn about the history of the prison and how our system has changed over the years.  I found it fascinating that men, women and children prisoners all were in the same facility.  A few of the women even gave birth and kept their children with them while serving time.  Al Capone spent about a year here and they have a replica of what his cell looked like.  This proves that money can even buy some freedoms while incarcerated.  Make sure you use the restroom before you visit as they only have port-a -potties.  The summer months can be hot as there is no air conditioning and winter cold as there is no heat. During Halloween they have a haunted tour at night.  If you wear a glow-stick the tour guides can touch, move or chase you."
290,Cool and a little spooky,Took my 2 boys (14yo and 9yo).  My youngest enjoyed the scavenger hunt.  My oldest liked the walking audio tour with the headset. Cool for a different look at history.  Our total time onsite was about 1.5 hours.  You could spend 3 hours onsite if you are really into prison history.
291,Very Hot in the summer but cool too,"Unless you're a big fan of prisons or it's Halloween, maybe skip this attraction.I personally am not interested in prison torture devices or  crumbling lead paint."
292,Family trip out,"I can't believe it took me coming to Philly so many times before I finally saw this place. I appreciated that there were audio sets that didn't cost an additional sum of money. The audio guide was very informative and easy to follow. After awhile, many of the rooms start to look similar, but there is also a more traditional museum set up area with interesting information and first-hand written statements from inmates."
293,Powerful and Unforgettable,Very interesting and well thought out visitor attraction Definitely enjoyed experience Good value for level of detail and atmospheric
294,Ever so creepy. Go there.,With all that is going on in current events it was an interesting time to go. Especially with hot topics of injustice for minorities and overcrowding prisons. I am afraid of my own shadow and was afraid it was more a haunted type place. I didn’t feel scared at all and i think my teens learned some things. Worth a stop.
295,Family Trip ,I have been to Philly more than once but for some reason never made it to Eastern State Penitentiary. I went in the summer and it was hot but well worth the visit. We went on a self guided tour and we had headphones to guide us-I  like the freedom that the self guided tour gave us. We could spend as much time as we wanted too. I would recommend giving yourself 2 or more hours so that you do not miss anything.This is a great piece of history. There were places with AC to rest in the summer and I am sure they do the same in winter. If you can make it in the fall you can tour the prison during the day and do the Terror Behind the Walls at night for some great scares!
296,"In Prison, but only for a short time",This a very interesting jail that was active for a very long time in modern times. Many cells have been left undisturbed. It is on one of the mus see event in Philadelphia.
297,Absolutely phenomenal ,"I wasn’t sure about this at first, but my husband heard it was cool. It was! We learned a lot and although it was sobering, it was not morbid. Well worth the time and we spent quite awhile on many of the exhibits. There is a recorded self tour and on some days there is a live docent explaining aspects of penitentiary life."
298,Holiday weekend in Philly,"Go at your own speed, listen or not. Spend as much or as little time as you want in each area. There are staff members spread around the area that are great sources of information. If they don't know the answer, they find someone who does."
299,Great audio tour,If you have ever been to Alcatraz go to Eastern State Penitentary. Here in Philly you will find a much less touristy fell and I love that a few of the wings are left as they were. Not remodeled or made for tourists.The stories. The history. The atmosphere. They all make up what this prison has to offer and if you are in the neighborhood for obvious reasons take you time and walk here and spend a few hours. You will not be sorry.
