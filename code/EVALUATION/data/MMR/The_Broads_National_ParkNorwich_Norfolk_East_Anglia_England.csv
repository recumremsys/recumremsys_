0,Lovely and relaxing,"The Broads National Park is great for walks, picnics and boat trips!  The scenery is stunning and I found it to be really peaceful.  I'd definitely recommend visiting."
1,"Enjoying the scenery aboard Tower Bridge, lovely.","The Broads National Park is a great place for exploring, it's very clean and beautiful! Be sure to visit if you're in the local area"
2,Pretty place,"The Norfolk Broads are a delightful place to visit with relaxing country side, it's even better if you go by boat and get some good weather.  There's plenty of wildlife and plenty of places to visit, out on the broads you can find peaceful places to relax or if you like a bit of hustle and bustle you can visit Great Yarmouth or Norwich.I am not sure why other reviewers are reviewing their boats or the weather, when it is about reviewing the broads as a place.  But for me the broads provides one of the best British holidays."
3,4 nights exploring the Norfolk Broads,Fabulous four days hosting on The Norfolk Broads.The scenery is beautiful. Lots of wildlife and some lovely villages to visit.
4,Fabulous boat trip,Took a boat ride in this famed area of lakes and waterways and the views were fantastic.  There are also numerous birds and waterfowls to spot and identify.  On the whole an interesting and lovely place to explore.
5,Beautiful,A drive around the villages and inlets is a must whilst in the area. Beautiful and outstanding scenery along with plenty of paths down to the broads to give you the best views possible
6,Wroxham and the River overcrowded.,"Hired a day boat to explore the Broads. It is a very tranquil area. Lots of boats sailing past , all with a friendly wave. Lots of little coves to pull into and watch the boats and birds go by . Not as many pubs/ shops around the broads as we imagined, so you’d be advised to walk with your food and drink and settle in for a very quiet day ."
7,Clean sweep trip,"We spent a very relaxing five days sailing on the Broads.  The scenery and wildlife was stunning.  I wish the same could be said about the boat.  We hired Horizon 2 from Hoseasons and picked it up from Richardson’s boatyard at  Stalham.  I think the boat was built at the same time as the ark.  It was very tired and in desperate need of some tic.  The motor however was pristine.  The boat was very long and difficult to reverse and moor in some places.  We visited Ludham, Coltishall, Wroxham then returned to Stalham.    Some tips, hire a hairdryer if you need one, there are no sockets on the boat, make sure you have a 12v plug to charge up phones.  Take your own pillows or ask for extra.  The ones we had were so flat we had to sleep on folded up blankets and clothes.  Showers are fine if you are 5 foot or under.  Having said all that we had a lovely time.  Definitely wouldn’t hire that boat again though."
8,"A rainy, windy fun day!",Stunning place to visit with so much to see especially the beautiful bird life there. Perfect for lovers of wildlife and beauty a deffinate place to visit with the family.
9,Best seen in a Canoe,"A wonderful way to see Norfolk at its best. Lots of wildlife to see, places of interest to visit and places to stop off to eat or have a drink. All types of boats available to hire, or you can go on a Broads Tour where you will have a guide to point out various things of interest."
10,Complete waste of time!!,"I had a great day out here with a group of students and staff from school. Lots of great walks and views, or if you have time take a boat out and enjoy the fantasy wildlife and tranquility of the area."
11,Hired a boat,Beautiful scenery and relaxing time on a boat trip through the Broads. Really relaxing pace of life!
12,Amazing,"Lovely riverside pubs,  boat hire. Holiday lets. Fishing, lots of wildlife and plenty to see and do. Stately homes to see, norwich castle. Close to beaches"
13,Day trip ,We hired a day boat from Potter heigham and the views are amazing we also stopped of at a pub and the mooring was free.You see a lot of wildlife
14,Love the broads,"We took a nice stroll around Whitlingham broad this morning in the brilliant sunshine and it was gorgeous! A beautiful walk on a flat travelled path that go around the whole broad. Great company, great sunshine and not many other visitors so the pooch had a lovely walk! The cafe was open when we finished up, so we had a coffee and bit of lunch sitting out in the sun. A couple of hours later and 2.40 into the parking machine we went home rather satisfied with our successfully morning."
15,The broads,"If you love the water and boats this is the place to visit. Very unique setting, peaceful and calm. The weather was sunny and warm so this added to a lovely visit."
16,Reedham to Great Yarmouth - a stunningly beautiful walk,"The broads is a great way to explore some magnificent parts of Norfolk, however to truly get the best experience you need a canoe or kayak to get to the parts inaccessible by motor boat. We regularly put our canoe on at various locations and explore new hidden gems of the broads."
17,Great nature reserve,"Beautiful scenery, with great photo opps! Wildlife was plentiful with sailboats running in all directions. Friendly people all around with OK parking!"
18,A little part of wonderful Norfolk,"The broads is a beautiful, relaxing place and you have to come at least once. Particularly the North Broads is full of quaint old villages, lovely broads and plenty of good pubs to have a pint by the water or eat some tasty grub. Nature is in abundance and if you keep your eyes open you'll see plenty you won't have seen elsewhere. Recommend Barnes Brinkcraft boats. Take a short break (Mon - Fri) and just take it steady. Perfect"
19,Beautiful and peaceful ,"The Norfolk broads offer something for everyone. Quiet, peaceful, loads of wildlife  lovely pubs and restaurants and time to watch the world go buy. You can hire boats yourself or go on organised trips but whatever you do you will see this lovely area of beauty. Everyone is so friendly and always willing to help the novice boaters, even taking the boat in August was busy but we were able to moor up each night with a little bit of planning.  Just take a little care and plan the tides with some of the bridges."
20,amazing place 3 times now on a hire boat gets better everytime,Absolutely gorgeous. Loved the area. Stunning views and so relaxing cruising around. Loads of good boat hire companies arouncMust see
21,Shame about the weather,"We hired a motor boat for a few hours to see the Broads for the first time.  The scenery is something to behold as are the houses that back down to the water.  However, in some parts it was like the M25 on a Friday rush hour.  You have to give way to sail and there were yachts criss-crossing the water so steering our boat became reminiscent of the dodgems at the funfair.Others may be more sanguine than I am but how we didn't collide with anything remains a mystery.  If we went again I'd take one of the commercial cruises, much easier on the nervous system."
22,Walking off the Xmas dinner!!,"The Broads are delightfully unspoilt, even allowing for the numbers of tourists around. There are lovely little villages around but, of course, the waterways are the attraction. The best way to see the area - almost the only way - is from the water. A trip on a Mississippi River boat sounds a tad garish, but is a good way to find out a lot about the Broads in a short time - the skippers give and excellent commentary. Our trip taught us, amongst others,  about the harvesting of reeds for the thatched roofs and we say Greater Crested Grebes fishing and the rare March Harriers hunting - you are unlikely to see them from a car. A longer waterborne holiday is a good idea."
23,12 glorious years,"Just spent a week afloat on the broads on a stunning boat, the scenery is amazing we were blessed with good weather, no rain, so were able to dine on deck four days out of seven. The only disappointing aspect was the lack of decent places to eat as we traveled along, if you are a fan of deep fried rubbish with chips then fine but we aren’t! The outstanding place we found was the waters edge at Bramerton. The rest were decidedly average with a similar menu which you could take from one place to the next Brakes must be raking it in in this part of the world. That aside our boat had fantastic galley facilities which enabled us to prepare excellent meals aboard. Great trip will do it again next year as I doubt plane travel will be on our agenda for some time to come!"
24,A lovely day out on the broads,"We have had fantastic days out on the broads. Boat hire is reasonable, we often take family to Wroxham when they visit the area and go out on a day boat or you can go on a cruise for a few hours.They also have boats with a lift on the back for wheelchair users which is very easily accessible."
25,Relaxing and fun,Best way to see the Broads is to take a boat tour with commentary so you can learn about all of the nature around the rivers. Favourite places for us to visit are Horning and Coltishall. Lots of pubs and cafes around and Wroxham is a large place with lots of shops and boat yards.
26,Messing about on the river ,Whether you hire a boat on the Broads or stay in the area it is all very worthwhile and there is so much of interest. Nature at its best. Lots of lovely Norfolk villages and easy to visit other places nearby.
27,"Peak time, still a good time.","On a boat, plenty of free mooring places, beautiful scenery.  Windmills, wildlife including otters and kingfishers.  Potter Heigham - Bridge Stores cafe - well worth the visit - wonderful cakes!"
28,A great boating adventure,We were able to take a 90 minute boat trip through the Broads national park on a fine sunny afternoon. It was our first trip to this part of the UK but the scenery was outstanding and I am sure we will be back.
29,The Beautiful Broads,"If you avoid the popular spots in high season, you can have a very peaceful time, boating, walking and enjoying nature."
30,Lovely Scenery Pity About The Boat,"We hired a beautiful boat for a week. Tranquil and beautiful sailing on the Broads. Everyone is so friendly on their boats, plenty of moorings and so much wildlife to see."
31,Beautiful place to visit and/or takeout a boat to explore.,"My family and me have just returned from a weeks boating holiday cruising the rivers of the Broads National Park and no matter how many times we visit, there is always something different and mystical about the place. Drive through it and around it and it's amazing; cruise through it and it's just breathtaking. Thoroughly recommended is this part of the UK."
32,Trip down memory lane,"On a sunny day we enjoyed a 45 minute guided walk round the circular nature trail which took us round two islands connected by two foot bridges. Our guide Elaine pointed out many species of birds, insects and plants. You have to get there by boat and in our case we had booked the Salhouse Broad ferry. For £10 each we got the ferry to the nature trail (about 5 mins), a guided walk round the trail, and a 45 min trip round the Broad in the ferry (a small open boat max 5 passengers). If you are on your own boat or hired craft you can moor up and enjoy the walk without a guide free (donations requested). Back on shore there is a kiosk selling hot drinks and snacks. Car parking at Salhouse Broad is free and there are public loos in the car park. There is a 10 to 15 min walk from the car park to the Broad. It was a very enjoyable outing highly recommended on a sunny day."
33,Rented a boat from Richardson's for one week at the end of September.,Lovely area with plenty of pretty villages to explore and boats to hire or go on an organised trip. Lots of tea rooms and pubs en route.
34,Interesting going under Wroxham Bridge,"Well worth a visit even in the winter . Pretty , peaceful and lots of birds and other wildlife to see. A bit too cold for boating today but amazing in the summer . Definitely a place to visit on a warm day to get away !"
35,Boat trip from Wroxham,Forgot how beautiful and relaxing the broads where. Had our honeymoon here back in 1997 and our return was fantastic. Some lovely little towns and villages to visit with wonderful bars and restaurants a plenty. If you've never holidayed on the broads i would highly recommend it.
36,"Boat tour gave a great overview, views & birds",Call me biased but I love the county of Norfolk and the Norfolk Broads. The countryside and vistas differ from one area of the County to another. There is always something to do plenty of walking sailing boating on the Broads bird watching plenty of entertainment friendly people Norfolk is the place to be
37,A winderful refuge from modern life,It has been many many years since I last took a break on the Norfolk broads.The bird life is amazing
38,A unique area of English countrside,We have made several trips out on our boat to visit the far ends of the Broads and many places and restaurants on the way. With good weather it is hard to beat!
39,Norfolk Broads Direct's Fair Commissioner - Brilliant!,"the norfolk broads is what norfolk is best known for.there is so much to do here.you can spend a relaxing week on a boat cruising the water ways,or just a day trip!don't like boats,then rent a house on the river.there is loads of places for the kids to explore and learn about nature,or grab a fishing rod and go fishing.in the evening you can pop in one of the many pubs and restaurants that are about.a great place for the whole family,young and old."
40,Relaxing and tranquil,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. There were shops, cafes, restaurants as well as lovely scenery. We rented out a boat for a few hours and that was the highlight of the trip."
41,Day trips on the broads,The broads are a great place for an absolute beginner to boating to come and have a go slow speed is a must to avoid damaging the banks. The wildlife in the quite area is amazing .Bird watching paradise .The village's and pubs along many routes provide tasty food and a good selection of beer.
42,great week in the sun cruising,We enjoyed a wonderful week in a cottage right on the river at Horning. So peaceful  and relaxing doing a spot of fishing and watching the world go by in their boats. You can visit the busy centres or lose yourself in the villages or go visit the wonderful beaches. The best break ever. You simply must...
43,Hoseasons boat on Broads,"Just returned from a lovely boating holiday which was quite magical. A lovely place to be if you appreciate the wilds of nature! I would recommend having a loose plan though as some of the more popular areas to moor get full up (these are often the ones with more facilities and shops). The boat had surprisingly good storage space so I would stock up on food beforehand, just in case you can't find a mooring space in time to have an evening meal at a pub. Our best night was being mudweighted in the middle of a gorgeous wild broad, cooking jar-based curry for dinner! (Our boat also had a decent sized microwave which could accommodate ready meals). Having said all that, we were able to moor everywhere we wanted to, and were blessed with unusually beautiful weather!"
44,Wonderful holiday as always!,"Go frequently on boating holidays here and there are plenty of riverside hostelries for lunch, dinner or just drinks"
45,Very enjoyable day ,"great place for family fun, walks boat hire of just people watching a real gem of Norfolk we love it here."
46,Day boat hire,"Beautiful area to visit for a relaxing time. Boats maybe hired for the day or you can go fishing, subject to having a rod license ofcourse. The area has plenty of shops and cafes too so there is something for most people. It's a great place to visit!"
47,Trip on the broads,Any Season but Autumn Colours are stunning this time of year xxThe birdlife and wildlife are plentiful and easily visible
48,The Broads-but NOT a national park!,I took a two hour boat tour and it was a very interesting trip through gorgeous scenery. The captain/tour guide pointed out local flora and fauna in a relaxing and informative way. The boat was spacious and served basic drinks and snacks.
49,Relaxing boat trip to unwind and drift away..,Sucha beautiful setting and would recommend a visit even not being in the water! We went walking around and just boat watching but would hire a boat next time!
50,A stunning location,You cannot come to Norfolk without visiting the Broads. Birds and ither wildlife are abundant. If you are a birdwatcher. You must visit the Broads.
51,Top class service!,"Birds, fish, otters and lots of rest.All of this can be found in the Norfolk Broads.Friendly people in a unique world of rivers, lakes and reeds"
52,Exquisite,"This is quite a special place, my second time.A maze of waterways lined with nature & some beautiful houses.One can go on a cruise or hire your own boat.Lots of bird life."
53,Beautiful area,"The Norfolk Broads used to be a paradise for cruisers and sailing boats. Unfortunately moorings are in short supply, very often when you find one the bank is in poor shape and usually totally impassable if you have a crew member with a wheelchair. The North Rivers are very congested but the Upper reaches of the Waveney and the Yare can still be very pleasant. The fishing can still be superb out of season but to get the big stuff you need to hire a guide, well worth the cost."
54,Boat trip,Easy Access and lots of things to see and do with great eating out places on the edge of Broad s and rivers - some cracking real ale pubs out of the way and log fires in winter.
55,Peaceful,"You can easily obtain tickets on line for a fun afternoon on a large party boat on the Norwich/Norfolk County Breads.  These medieval canals wander all over East Anglia on their way to the sea.  If you are in for adventure, you can also rent and operate a reasonably priced smaller power boat and arrange your travel and overnight stops on-line as well.  Highly recommended of you are having  a leisurely vacation in that part of the world."
56,A delightful afternoon at Horning,"We visit the broads in May 2019 and I really amazed because of the beauty of the nature. Especially to see the wild animals makes me always very excited and happy. I saw some wild birds, ducks, swans on the lakes. To watch boats on the water and listen silence of the nature was amazing.  I highly recommend  to visit here for nature lovers"
57,Stunning!,"We'd never been to the Norfolk Broads before - we like water but we also like hills with views. But it was a great place to go for a holiday. We had perhaps the best of both worlds, a good holiday 'cottage' with day boat provided, so we could get on the water more often than we otherwise would have. There's plenty to explore and much of the navigation is straightforward so several people can take a turn. It was quite busy even in June and I can imagine that it could get unpleasant in some places with full moorings and perhaps rowdier less responsible visitors afloat.There were plenty of places to visit within a short car ride and the coast is close too for a change. We did a lot in our week and there was plenty we weren't able to include.It is a bit challenging with a dog as many nature reserves don't allow dogs and quite a few of the attractions (some for obvious reasons, some shouldn't find it a problem if willing) and I can imagine it might be challenging for the nerves with small children and not plenty of adults watching. The main navigations we visited (along the Bure) were less wildlife rich than we had hoped, perhaps because diesel boats are noisy, and perhaps too because the breeding season was coming to an end. We were delighted to see kingfisher and marsh harrier on multiple occasions.A great spot to slow down and relax."
58,Wayford Bridge to Neatishead ,"We have visited the Norfolk Broads for boating holidays many times over the last 45 years. It is one of our favourite places in England. Simply sit back and potter about at 4MPH, you'll soon feel chilled. Its a bit of a rude awakening when you get back into your car for the journey home."
59,Loads of nice places to go for walks ,"I am lucky enough to live close to Wroxham and visit often.  There are several nice places to eat and drink.  Even though we live quite near, we often take a boat out, sometimes just for a couple of hours and smetimes for the day.  The boards has an ice-cream boat which my grandchildren love to find to get an ice-cream or lolly.In the height of summer it can get quite busy, but once you are out on the water it's great.The Broads is a lovely place to relax and enjoy yourself on the water or in Wroxham village itself.  If you have time (many holiday-makers take a boat out for a week or more.  There are many other places to visit along the length of the broads, most of which have food and drink outlets.  If you have time, you can even take your boat as far as Great Yarmouth.Feeding the ducks is a favourite with kids and adults alike."
60,Late Summer Treat,"We went here with the little man to explore some of Norfolk's great hidden nature gems. We took the ferry from Salhouse Broad, which cost £10 for a return and included life jackets. The man who took us from Salhouse Broad to Hoveton Gt. Broad was super friendly and took great care of us when embarking and disembarking from the boat.Once we completed the short 5 minute journey to the nature trail, we spent a lovely 40 minutes walking through the wetland, taking in the plethora of information about the area. Our 2 year old really enjoyed the walk and was convinced that he could see the Gruffalo!All in all, a beauty spot of important scientific interest which I would recommend. However, this trail does not accommodate for wheelchairs or buggies (It will do in a few years).We finished the trail, were greeted by the friendly warden who is there full-time and she radioed for the ferry which arrived around 5 minutes later.A great little hidden adventure."
61,Another good week sailing,A beautiful place to visit must go on a cruise or hire a small boat. Can get very busy. The guided visits are very informative
62,Lovely scenery,"Having travelled the canals for many years, we had never visited The Broads. There is so much to see it was difficult to know where to go. We chose Wroxham. The scale of the place  and the number of available board is incredible. We drove around the area towards Caister crossing many waterways and more and more boats. Being a fan of boats and birds, can't believe it has taken so long to visit."
63,Beautiful nature and peaceful time,"I recommend taking a couple of hours to get on a guided boat tour. Sit back, relax and enjoy this beautiful setting; both natural and human (great waterside properties)."
64,Boats and more boats,We be on for 4 boating holidays on the Broads i just think it is a beautiful place. the best bit about the broads that you wake up in nature and see the beautiful scenery i love to hear to birds singing when you wake. the best place we like is Oulton Broad you have great sunset at night lovely great holidays hope we will come again soon great experience.
65,Boating holiday on the fair princess,"We have been regular visitors to the Broads for over 20 years - hotels, cottages, b & bs, boats. It is a beautiful area with different aspects to enjoy. It should be compared with other outdoors type destinations such as The Lake District for example, it is not a holiday resort bursting with shops, cafes, bars and pre-set activities.  Another reviewer referred to it as man-made which sort of suggests theme park to me. Now whilst the actual Broads themselves (small lakes) were created as a result of peat digging a very very very long time ago,  they are connected by a small number of rivers which meander through beautiful countryside and pass by/through small hamlets and villages, as well as up to the city of Norwich for example , and through the seaside town and port of Great Yarmouth which joins the two areas of the Broads which are to its North and South.  The speed limit for watercraft varies between 4 & 6 mph so passage is at a gentle pace and thus takes much longer than by a car on straight roads, so you will not reach a metropolis, or even a shop, every hour or two! In fact there are often no shops at many of the spots and sometimes not even in the small villages - afterall if it was that built up as an area, i.e.with facilities at every turn, it wouldn't be the special place it is. Those who go walking in the fells don't expect a Burger King half way around their hike of the day! So,if you want services and facilities on tap this may not be the holiday for you, especially if you are in a boat. There are lovely villages on the water , some with a pub, a cafe , a local shop or two, a nature walk etc but other mooring places for boats, and often holiday cottages etc, are set in very quiet locations, not least so that the peace and the wildlife can be enjoyed/observed, or a waterside walk undertaken. There are some stretches of river which gently wander through fields and you can trundle along and not see a building or even another boat for some time. These stretches are more frequent on the southern side, but whether North or South the quiet stretches of water offer the chance to see some fabulous wildlife rather than a pub and some houses, so choose your locations after a brief bit of simple research. Same goes for the choice/location of a holiday cottage, bed and breakfast etc. Another reviewer called their waterbourne trip ""boring""  so perhaps they didn't consult a proper map and simply pointed the boat in any random direction. Research is key - if on a little boat for a day then do you want to head for a quiet picnic spot, or a pub lunch, or somewhere with a boardwalk/nature walk? Or do you want to see Wroxham (the so called capital of the Broads) and all its waterside properties from the river. And remember, if you are on a boat as your accommodation it is not a floating holiday cottage or hotel - you will not have electricity on tap, you will need to fill up your water tank regularly (various places to do this) and there is no room service so ensure you have at least the basics to eat and drink, and some easy meals if you are not aiming for a pub ( or decide to stop somewhere else that takes you fancy). This is all part of the fun. Being on the water is wonderful , magical, peaceful and amazing. Nothing like spotting a kingfisher or heron on the bank, or hearing the owls hooting as you go to bed with the water swishing around the boat. Early mornings with a coot or swans by the boat as you have a cuppa, or spot an otter by the riverbank - all these things are special. If you hire a cottage which is waterside you will also be able to enjoy the wildlife first hand, or from the comfort of a cosy armchair, or whilst fishing from the garden.  Equally there are some lovely cottages and B&Bs where you can walk to the riverside and even to a shop or two, or the pub or the restaurant. We are back to that key thing - do your research! The greatest thing about the Broads is that it can be enjoyed by three generations all together - unlike a hike to the fells where really only the younger or fitter ones can participate. We've done Broads holidays with children, teenagers, grandparents and some limited mobility family. It's a unique and special area ,  and if you seek peace, tranquility, nature, or even a pub lunch by the river and a browse in a local quirky shop, you will certainly enjoy The Broads. If you sail, or fish, this is also a great destination for a holiday. If you fancy an upgrade on camping, with a floating home for the week instead and a different view each morning, you'll love the adventure of a boating holiday whether as a young family, couple or mixed age group. If you prefer to have all home comforts on tap you could choose a cottage or small b&b. Some holiday rentals offer a dayboat so you can tootle off for a river trip but return to all your creature comforts in the evening. Before I go, one myth I must definitely bust - The Broads is not actually a real National Park, though plenty of businesses and the authority for the waterways abuse the national parks link that the area has, and like to kid all the tourists !"
66,Worth a visit,We’ve as a family have been visiting the Broads National park on the rivers for over 40 years and basically it’s stayed the same . It’s always been a place to get away from it all alongside Mother Nature in all her Glory On many occasions we have seen Otters kingfishers Marsh Harriors cuckoos Reed warblers Barn Owls  and for the 1st time in June this year The Swallow Tail Butterfly. There are numerous pubs and villages to walk to or some you can just moor alongside . Fishing as always has been part of my families activity but make you you go in the fishing season which starts on the 16th June each year. There is always something to do just messing about on the river and now  our Grandchildren are enjoying what has been preserved for the future. It has always been a very magical place hopefully it will stay that way
67,Beautiful part of the world,"Had the opportunity to work in and around some of the lovely Norfolk broads, it was June and the weather was perfect, visited some lovely rural villages and my only disappointment was not seeing a Swallowtail butterfly this time."
68,Something very different for us,"There a few companies that do the cruises on the broads, if its a nice day it is lovely. We had a lovely day for it and a good boat with a good commentary for the hour and a half trip. We cruised up the river calling in at two of the Broads and passing others which were not open to the publicThe broads are in a National Park with plenty of wild life to see.well worth a visit.."
69,Boat trip on the broads,Was amazing day with my sister and our partners We had an amazing tour along the broads which was organised by a lovely lady called dawn in the info centre Amazing views and lovely relaxation
70,Visit at least once in your life,Boating on the broads should be made mandatory for everyone at least once in their lives. It is such a relaxing thing to do and for only £15 a head six of us hired a boat and spent the day pootling about in the sunshine stopping at each pub for refreshments. A fantastic way to spend a Saturday.
71,Peace and Tranquility Fun and laughter,"Took a boat tour of two of the broads.  Very interesting to see, beautiful homes.  Also walked around one of the locations."
72,Peaceful,We are lucky enough to own a boat and so can visit broads anytime usually. Now back on broads following lifting of restrictions. You can see that lack.of use has seen vegetation etc increase.  Si much to enjoy and much better if you afloat as many areas cannot be seen from shore.
73,Best relaxing holiday EVER,Visit here often as have a boat moored on the broads. Great for a relaxing break to get away either for a few days or longer. Go at your own pace and moor up at different places each night.
74,Go in winter,"Superb place to potter about on a boat, very well kept.  Gets really busy in summer and even end September / October parking for boats is tricky if near well pretty much anything!Worth a visit, and a bit of advanced planning sorts the parking options :-)"
75,Hoveton Great Broad Nature Trail,"We spent a fabulous day exploring the quite end of The Broads by boat. Hickling Broad, Horsey Windmill and the stunning rivers that connect the two. We started out from Martham Ferry Boat Hire."
76,Relaxing day on the water,The Norfolk broads offer something for everyone. From secluded backwaters where wildlife abounds to busy towns on the river with lovely pubs and restaurants. You can hire boats yourself or go on organised trips but whatever you do you will see this lovely area of beauty. Very busy in peak holiday season in August but it's available all year round.
77,This should be in your bucket list,"We've been to the broads for the last 3 years with our family and it's a lovely, relaxing place to go, we come home and our batteries have definitely been recharged."
78,Four day boats for a Hen Night,Hire boat for the day had a fantastic day Richardsons Boat 🚤 ideal place to take the family and do a bit of fishing and call at the local pubs en route it is very busy in July and August on the Broads but it can be fun I hire boat once a year 👍
79,An excellent day out,Spent a day strolling in a lovely park and a boat trip on the broads. Enjoyed the tranquility of the gardens and many species of plants and birds.
80,Fabulous!,We went on a 90 minute boat trip and thoroughly enjoyed the scenery and commentary from the captain.
81,Amazing area of natural beauty,Great place to escape the hustle and bustle of 21st centurybkife. Fantastic chance to see wildlife  in this unique landscape
82,Stunning Scenery,"Nice and relaxing place, plenty cafes and pubs for a nice meal or for a drink. Possibility to rent a boat. Take a bread loaf as there are lots of friendly swans and duck around!"
83,nothing beats it,"Because I live near the Broads I am lucky enough to be a frequent visitor.Take a day launch from Stalham or Wrexham or even one of the tourist boats,sit back and enjoy the beauty,the birds and the wildlife,not to mention the peace."
84,Yachting on the Norfolk Broads ,"One of Norfolk's wonders. Beautiful wide open skies and space to get away from people. There is the chance you may see kingfishers, otters, marsh harriers, and so many other wonderful wildlife gems. You may hear bitterns booming or see a murmuration of starlings. There are pubs on some of the waterways which offer excellent food and good beer. There are also wind pumps some of which are open to the public and the ruins of St Benets Priory to see,"
85,Stunning,We had a wonderful ten day holiday on a boat on the Norfolk Broad. We have done this quite a few times and never tire of visiting the lovely villages and waterside pubs. When the sun shines it's even better !
86,"hire boats from Richardsons boating Holidays , Stalham","We love it, just decided to do the northern Broads on the upper river Bure and Ant. Very relaxing and just great going at your own pace. Unfortunately the weather hasn’t been great but I can only see it being even better during the summer months due to the weather and the foliage of surrounding vegetation. During early spring it tends to be a bit bare and the theme is just brown nevertheless it’s a great experience and with a nice eateries, quaint stops, a serene atmosphere, banter and great vibe between fellow broadgoers I reckon we’ll be back!!"
87,A great place to escape at any time of year,"We spent three days exploring various parts of the Broads. I had never been to the area so was keen to see a few places. We went on a boat tour from Wrexham, visited Fairhaven Water Gardens, walked around Salhouse Broad and stayed in a small hamlet. We only visited a small section of the Broads but would definitely recommend a visit!Some of the Broads are closed to boats in order to protect the wildlife, and there were other signs of great management schemes. I hope the Broads continue to be well managed like this in the future."
88,"A wonderful area to visit but it isn't actually a national park, don't be mislead.","After boarding the Broads Tour boat we sat down for a comfortable few hours travelling down the river. They move along slowly so  it is a peaceful, unhurried journey. One can watch  other boats, the bird life on the shore/river and in all a wonderful  day out. I would do it again, and recommend it to all."
89,Stunning,Spent a wonderful peaceful two hours on a cruise with an excellent commentary by the skipper.  The wildlife was abundant and I would certainly go back again to view more
90,Beautiful and peaceful (in places),"My husband and I and two friends booked a four night stay on a boat here in September.  The scenery was lovely and we could have had better weather but made the most of it.  Unfortunately our boat was a complete disappointment.  It had not been cleaned properly and had broken glasses not enough crockery and the bedding was abysmal.  We had been on a boat on the Broads many years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it, we cut short our trip as we were fed up with the state of the boat and came home early.  We did have a lovely meal at one of the lovely pubs facing the river that was our saviour, we couldn’t get the heating to work and weren’t told where we could fill up with water luckily another pub let us use their garden hose to fill up.I think we have now decided that our boating days are over. The Norfolk Broads are beautiful and I would recommend but chose one of the well known boating companies."
91,Broads Cruises excellent 2 hours,"Our second year boating on the Broads and again this beautiful part of our country did not disappoint.. booked through Richardsons at Stalham, we arrived on Monday to a warm welcome once again.. after a quick refresher on how to run the boat we set off. Over the next couple of days we visited several different spots and the weather was good.  Already booked for next year for a longer time and a larger boat!"
92,Boat trip is a must,"For a taste of the Broads, get a train and boat ticket on the Bure Valley Railway at Aylsham: narrow gauge train trip plus a cruise along the Ruiver Bure. Pleasant, scenic trip and particularly good for elderly prople or those with mobility problems."
93,Beautiful peaceful place,Went for a very relaxing two hour boat trip. The experience was a joy. Boat very clean and food and drink served.
94,Not sure which was best ,"Our most recent holiday included, for the first time, a view of the Broads from the Bittern Line train. We've also hired boats from Horning Marina on several occasions, and gone on the boat tour from Wroxham. There are busy spots, Potter Heigham being the busiest place we encountered, but peace can also be found at places like Fairhaven Gardens. A beautiful area."
95,spring getaway,Always a good place to visit especially if you want to show young children there is more to life than TV and computer games wildlife mixed with fun and loads of places to eat and drink children and adults of all ages will enjoy this experience
96,Norfolk Broads Experience,We went to a day visit to the Broads. We hired disabled friendly boat from the Broad boating company. It had its own car park. Had to pay £3 for parking. We paid £58 for three hours hiring a boat. Disabled chair was available from the company. We had lovely three hours on water on selfdrive boat. It was easy to drive. I recommend this day trip to any disabled person who is bound on wheelchair.
97,The most relaxing place in England,"Staying in a cottage by Wayford Bridge and have canoed up and down the Broads. Our favourite was the trip to Neatishead, a long pull from Wayford but worth the stunning wildlife, including herons and kingfishers and many swans. Lovely pub in Neatishead too!"
98,Never ceases to amaze,"Our second experience of spending a week on board a boat with some glorious sunrises and sunsets. A lovely peaceful time going where you please and when you please. Last time we had ""Magic Gem"" which was a good boat and recommended. This time we had Clarion which was cramped and a little uncomfortable so I wouldn't recommend it. However that didn't detract from the holiday. Richardsons are an excellent company with exemplary customer service (although some of the pre holiday communications could have been better). We had a problem on our boat at just a little after midnight and when I called the emergency number nothing was too much trouble and despite thunder and rain an engineer was with us within about ten minutes and sorted our problem.The broads are lovely and the views and wildlife can really be appreciated from the unique vantage point of a holiday home on water."
99,Fun and learn,"We have enjoyed the broads for many years and it supports many and varied interests. We have camped, sailed, swum, fished, leisure boated as well as walked and dined. Ranges from tourist areas like Wroxham with many shops an leisure craft through to quiet small broads only accessible by boat. Can recommend the area and the Canoe Man if you want to paddle yourself. An area not to be missed."
100,Beautiful scenery and wildlife,"Lovely on the water with the sun shining, beer in hand and travel BBQ, what more could you ask for on a lazy summers day?"
101,My favourite place in the world. ,It is nice but can get very busy. Best to go not in school holidays. Can get some great sights and beautiful walks alongside too.
102,Ahoy there,"I mean it is fine in summer as well, but there is something magical about the golden reeds through the winter months, and the frost on the river banks in the morning. No shortage of birds and wildlife as large numbers of birds winter in the fens."
103,Two years of motor boating on the southern broads has been lovely,"first trip on northern broads after visiting southern broads, just a great relaxing week in the sun, great boat from richardssons and the dog loved it, fishing geat pus great , in fact going to buy my own boat here"
104,"This is not a National Park, it legally cannot become one.","That's pretty much what you'll get used to if you visit the broads. A rather scenic place to plod along in a boat with almost nowhere to park the damn thing.As a first time boater I was nervous enough as it was, we got our boat from Bridgecraft who were a disappointment. The son of the owner rushed through the instructions, ticked all the boxes on the release form to say he'd told us about all the functions and safety features of the boat when in fact he had barely scratched the surface. Yes I know I should have read the form more thoroughly at the time but he was in such a rush to be done with us I didn't check till that evening.  The boat we had turned out to be too big to go under some of the bridges which meant we couldn't actually see half the broads.And why oh why are there so many boats on the broads and so little places to moor? There must be 70% private Mooring and 30% free Mooring. So you spend half your time looking for Mooring. We won't be going back."
105,Nature cruise,Get yourself into a kayak or a canoe to help the environment and enjoy this bootiful and peaceful place. It's fab and if you want a boat try and book an electric one.
106,Let's bust a few myths!,"We spent a brilliant afternoon at Horning watching the antics of the sailing boats of the Horning Yacht Club practice their skills on the River Bure. There were also plenty of motor cruisers about and. of course, The Southern Comfort Mississippi Paddle Boat to add to the interest. Unfortunately, the paddle boat arrived from its last cruise of the day while we were there, otherwise we would have taken a trip on it. If you go to Horning, park in the Village Hall car park.  It's free and only a short walk from the river side. Also there is no time limit on parking there"
107,enjoyable but a bit boring,"Toured on a tourist boat, with lots of funny stories of local history and luminaries. Easiest way to get around, but made me want to immediately hire a boat and stay for a week. We had perfect, sunny weather, and nice people on the boat with us, not too crowded."
108,Quite relaxing area,"Brilliant .  Glorious weather, glorious sailing, glorious wildlife, glorious pubs, glorious people.  Love it."
109,Boating on the broads,"Just back from a lovely week on the southern broads. Pubs, water, food, wildlife. Lovely week.stayed at Beccles, Loddon, Oulton Broad amongst others and it was quite. Totally recommend April. Plenty of room wherever you go. Loved the broads."
110,Richardsons boat hire,"I've been coming to the broads on holiday now for over thirty years and it's wonderful!  A different pace of life by the river, nobody in a hurry and everyone in the same boat !! If you like the outdoors, the water, boats, fishing, fresh air, getting away from the hustle and chilling out, come to the broads!!"
111,You simply must...,"We travelled in a cruiser from Herbert Woods and fell in love with the broads. Some are too shallow for larger boats and many have channels you must stick to while travelling through - no matter as you have such choice of where to go, where to stop, nature walks, pubs and sites of interest.Most people are fabulous and we fell in love with the Broads.Definitely returning next year."
112,A wondeful man-made feature,"Went with a company well known around here. The broads are stunning, and worth a few days of staying in a boat. Wildlife beautiful."
113,Excellent,Love walking around this place could never get bored as there is so much to look at would recommend it in a nice day or weekend
114,autunm colours and lots of wildlife,"We have spent a lot of time on the Broads in the past so it was lovely to go back again this year to see if anything has changed. It's still a haven for peace and nature - really lovely to potter along the Broads from Brundall to Whitlingham Country Park and back again, stopping off for lunch along the way and cruising through a couple of the smaller broads as well. The Broads themselves are very well looked after and although it was August, our day trip was on a Saturday (guessing changeover day) so it wasn't busy. Perhaps the southern broads are less busy than the northern ones. Whether it's a day trip or a longer holiday, there are plenty of pubs and mooring opportunities to enjoy. We're coming back for a longer holiday next year and can't wait!"
115,Relaxing weekend on the Broads,"2nd year running we have been on The Queen of the Broads for an evening disco trip. What a great night we had again, such a beautiful place"
116,Richardsons Boating Holidays,"We just fall in love with this part of world:) Peacefull, green, amazing! Loads to do. Cycling, walking, boating! All great!"
117,Herons and Swans,"It was a the first time to visit the broads, we took our own small boat and were able to find a jetty and parking easily. The engine broke down and a local boating yard tried to fix it. All the people we met were kind and helpful. This is an amazing part of England and I can't wait to go back. The scenery, wildlife and the waterways are spectacular."
118,First visit - impressed,The train journey was quick and cheap. We did an electric small boat trip and this was a very informative outing. There were just four of us on the boat and the pilot was excellent. You booked at the Information Office near the Rail Station and only steps away from the riverside and all the shops and cafes just down the road.
119,Dog walking,"We recently hired a day boat from Wroxham with friends, and had a super day out. The rental company gave us all the instructions and safety advice, lifejackets etc, and we were soon ready to go. We took a picnic, our cameras and with such wonderful weather, lovely scenery, it was impossible to go wrong. Lots of nice pubs to moor up to, and other stops for sandwiches and pies. I really can't wait to go again. Not expensive when you consider that it's a full day's fun for a family and friends. Give it a try."
120,Nothing special,"The Norfolk broads is a gem on the edge of east anglia. Now with reasonable road links it's the perfect place to spend a relaxing holiday or short break away from the hassle and gun crime in the rest of the U.K. There are plenty of low cost hotels and b&b's to choose from and a plethora of rural villages and historic towns to visit. Easy links to Norwich with its Norman Castle and 2 cathedrals, one being the second tallest in England. Hire a boat, take a hike or visit the coast, unlike the rest of the U.K. It's usually not raining."
121,Midweek boat trip,"Took a scenic boat trip through tge Broads for 1.5hrs.  Well organised, covid safe boats - with lots of seats removed.  The Broads were beautiful and it was lovely to gently meander through the water.  Boat was embarked at Wroxham which was a very busy, over touristy, town.  But worth putting up with the town to do the boat trip.  Recommend booking the boats a day ir so in advance as get very booked up.  Very enjoyable."
122,ALWAYS GOOD,"We booked on the 2 o'clock sailing. It just shows how good these tours are, the operator had to put on two additional sailings. The event was entertaining, informative and very professionally conducted. Highly recommend. Well done to the crew."
123,beautiful,"Ranworth is a bird sanctuary just outside South Waltham in Norfolk. The broads themselves are absolutely stunning. There's a boardwalk leading to a pontoon where you can sit upstairs using their binoculars to see the local bird life. Coming back to the broad itself where there is a lovely little gift shop, tea rooms and the local pub. The food is first class in the pub. The tea rooms sell lovely tea and cakes and the gift shop also sells boxes of bird food so you can feed all the fowl you want. A lovely day out."
124,Wroxham and boat trip,i have been going on the broads for almost 40 years and never had a bad holiday just so relaxing a peaceful
125,Do not use Hoseasons/broom boats,"We have discovered one of the most peaceful relaxing places to be to get away from every day life.  We will now be returning on many occasions to enjoy this haven of tranquility.  Have enjoyed the beautiful  place in holiday homes and boat hire and cannot rate it highly enough.  Forget airports and motorways, this is the place to be. The whispering reeds, the abundant wild life including many birds, geese, otters and majestic sunrises and sunsets. An everchanging landscape that calms in the best way possible."
126,"The Broads, Wroxham area, Norfolk","day launch hire from Potter Heigham, can be expensive but not at Maycraft. Located by walking 5 mins along the downstream bank from Herbert Woods boatyard behind about 20 riverside chalets we found Maycraft a traditional yard still working on wooden boats . Hired a perfectly suitable diesel engined day boat and enjoyed a lovely half day cruising to Ranworth and back. Overran our time by 20 minutes but the yard simply said as long as we enjoyed ourselves they were happy!!! They offer fully fitted cruisers as well about 30% cheaper than other local yards. No on site parking but only 5 minute walk. Would definately use again."
127,Barton Broad by boardwalk,"We rented a cruiser from Richardsons boat yard in August 2017 for 4 nights with our grandsons. Beautiful weather, beautiful scenery, appalling boat! Curtains falling off the rail, no curtains in the cabin, so no privacy. A toilet which showered us in sewage,extremely basic inventory......no wine glasses, broken shower curtain, unusable tv( which we didn't want anyway)We couldn't complain during the trip as there was no signal, we couldn't moor anywhere near a pub to make a phone call, and only having 4 nights did not want to return to base. On our return our concerns to management were met with total derision, we were told we had an agenda!...... Not really what you go on holiday with. The more expensive boats looked fabulous and seemed to be fully fitted out, our craft probably saw service at Dunkirk. If you rent a craft from this boat yard, please make sure which boat it is and check facilities yourself before you cast off and don't rent a cheap option. Good luck I hope you have a lovely holiday, we were offered £50 discount off another holiday, as if we'd like to relive the experience !"
128,A unique landscape,"We hired a boat for 3 hours and drove down through a couple of broads and the river, had lunch at a nice pub and drove back. Lots of wildlife... swans, ducks, herons, an otter."
129,"Amazing, but need more boat parking",We have just returned from another broads holiday on the boat Broadway. Had a lovely time despite the weather the boat was really good and very comfortable and easy to drive. We called into horning marina for water one day whilst we were there we mentioned we couldn't get the TVs to work.  The man that came to help was really lovely and friendly and helped get tv working . Looking in richardsons brochure later we realised that he was Clive Richardson one of the owners. Just like to say thank you again. You were a gentleman.
130,"Worth a five, but not enough mooring",Everyone should see the Norfolk Broads if only to see how much wealth there actually is in this country....
131,Very nice,A very restful placeSpend a day just looking at the beauty of the Brosds and grooving to everything
132,Holiday ,"Stunning place to be to enjoy life on the water.If on a cruiser, as long as you have food, drink and a bed, you dont need to worry about the time.    A wonderful, stunning place for scenery, wildlife, and just messing about on the river"
133,RICHARDSON BOAT HIRE.,"Just back from another lovely holiday on The Broads thanks to Bridgecraft, excellent boats and lovely staff.  Nothing is too much trouble and they cannot do enough for you.  All their boats are well maintained and well presented, looking forward to our next trip in 2018.  Thank you to everyone at Bridgecraft.  Di & Craig x"
134,Abundance of nature,"A weekend away from London took me to Norfolk and some country life.On a sunny Sunday morning, a walk along the University of East Anglia broads highlighted the wonderful hues and colours of the seasonal change from autumn to winter"
135,Fair Empress 3,"We are very fortunate to live only around a 20 minute drive from this scenic place and so we visit frequently, especially if we fancy a Sunday walk. Beautiful area of Norfolk and the UK, with so many footpaths and beauty spots. Very tranquil and relaxing, especially if you cruise gently up one of the many waterways of this lovely place. You can properly get away from it all here. There are plenty of country pubs dotted up and down all of the rivers and plenty of walks to be done."
136,Serene Setting,"The broads are full of privately owned cruisers and rental boats. One rental company advertises that they have 1800 cruisers. Seeing many boats is quite a spectacle. Seeing the broads, the rivers, with hardly any boats is wonderful. The beauty of the broads will stay with you for a while, that's for sure. Enjoy a drink in a pub on the waterside, walk along the river and you will relax."
137,Summercraft,"My family and I have been coming to the Norfolk Broads for over 30 years, hiring many different boats and cruising the beautiful and tranquil area.There is somethig to do for everyone from just relaxing and watching the world go by to busy days out with the family. If you've not hired a boat and gently cruised around the Broads before, do it! The scenery is stunning and not changed for centruries and remains unspoilt to this day. There are plenty of riverside pubs, restaurants and attractions to stop at in between chilling out. There are boats to hire for all price brackets from the top end luxurious to the more basic budget friendly. All float and get you around this amazing area and you can't go wrong with any choice of boat or boatyard really. Just sit back, unwind and enjoy!"
138,Spectacular,"Had 5 different boats in my 12 year stay on the Broads, mainly on the Southern Broads.What great years, lots of great helpful people to meet and plenty of different places to visit and moor up for a drink, meal or even a nice secluded spot all on your own.Life is slow and leisurely on the Broads it’s a great way of life, was on boat every weekend and got out as much as possible, Beccles was a regular place to moor up, good old Tim, the harbour master, always available to assist boaters to moor up, big moorings at Somerleyton with a good pub a short walk away, Waveney River Centre complete with indoor pool and spotless toilets/showers with underfloor heating.St Benedicts another lovely mooring, but so many but limited here on space.And then all the network of tributaries leading to all the different Broads, moor on the banks or in the middle with a couple of friends.You can hire day boats from many a place, and they will give you a taster, or you can hire all different size of boats, all with good facilities on board and have a week or fortnight trip, brilliant holidays Safety is the main priority, wear life jackets."
139,Family weekend cruising,"After 65 years sailing on the Broads you would think I had seen and done it all. The Broads is ever changing with the seasons, wonderful place. Now seriously spoilt by a lack of decent moorings in the wild places, exhorbitant charges for shabby facilities on commercial moorings, very poor access for disabled, especially my crew in a wheelchair. The few pubs left, most have lost the art of decent cooking. Take a list of taxi's with you and eat inland, excellent food abounds at respectable prices. Time to look at other cruising grounds, I.e. Ireland, what a lovely country to cruise, try French Canals, we did and were very surprised at the quality of vessels and the food...............great!"
140,Blissful relaxation,"We have stayed in Norfolk many times and always find somewhere to go as there's always events on in one village or another.    Wroxham  is the place to go if you want to do some shopping at Roy's, hire a day boat, take a boat trip on a Mississippi style boat down the River Bure and around the broads. You can Also hire holiday cruisers from the boatyards and make your way up to Coltishall or in the other direction towards Gt. Yarmouth.  You can always find plenty to do or places to visit.  There are always some pubs serving quality local produce at reasonable prices. The Broads are a hidden gem which hopefully will not be spoilt by tourism and over development."
141,Boat hire,"If you have never been to this wonderful area before, put it on your Bucket list..!!The scenery is amazing, for Bird lovers, the variety is abundant."
142,Lovely Natural Place,"The Broads are amazing and a place of beauty but it’s how you see it and when you see it.You think of Broads and you think of Broads Cruisers, those floating caravans.Come at the start of the season or at the end and I’m sure they’re great.Come in the mid season, especially school holiday and you’ll be sailing in a long string of boats, wherever you are.I know this because I kayak, right through the year.The best way to see the Broads is to come and stay; a cottage say and drive about and see places. Get a day boat out maybe, or hire a canoe.Get a canoe and get on the water early and you’ll see lots of wildlife. In a Broads Cruiser, not much.So come, it’s a beautiful place but think what you want out of it.Enjoy."
143,My favourite place in the world!,"We have been twice and are going again in April - great fun, you do not need to be experienced or adventurous or even young.  We go out of season so it is not to crowded, it does not need to be dawn to dusk sunshine on this sort of holiday.  Plenty of good places to eat and not expensive.  We talked for years about wanting to do try boating, I only wish we had done so before."
144,Hard to beat a day out on the Broads,"We took a trip with family on the Broads in August. The weather was good and warm. We hired a boat from hoseasons via Richardson's boat hire in stalham. Easy to drive, good service. The boat was old but fitted our needs fine. We did a video of our trip. Check out you tube ""Norfolk Broads weekend"""
145,Boating holuday,"I cane here with half a dozen blokes from work who had hired a boat before and the trip was amazing. The sites and fantastic and the whole experience is like nothing else. It’s the sort of thing people say they would love to do but never get round to it, but it is a must with various locations to stop off every day is an adventure."
146,Beautiful Nature (Even if man made),Nothing special. If nothing better to do possibly take a boat ride. Better to visit the nearby beach and watch the whales. Much over hyped.
147,"Summer Craft Boat Hire, Wroxham","Have been blessed with beautiful October weather for a long weekend on the broads. Booked crusading light from Herbert woods at potter heigham. 2 couples and 2 teenagers in an 11 berth boat was just right. Service on arrival was faultless, all staff pleasant and helpful. Although the boat was rather dated (we knew that when booking) , everything was in good working order and clean - would definitely recommend bringing non stick frying pan and a few of your ""must have"" utensils, as although there are the usual plates, mugs, glasses - there is little else.  Having read a few reviews before our trip we were a little apprehensive about where we were going to be able to moor. We had hoped to moor at ranworth on the first evening, but all available space was taken by four o'clock so we headed back to st benets abbey where we found space easily. Second night we intended to moor at neatishead to visit the white horse for dinner, the broad up to neatishead gets increasingly narrow but don't panic there is a turning point at the end. Small mooring here ( probably room for dozen boats ) and again we were unlucky, partly due to others poor mooring) so we headed back to gays staithe, a pretty and peaceful spot and from which we could walk to the pub in neatishead. Third day we moored at ludham and walked to village where we found the most decent shop of our trip to shop in. Had hoped to moor at Womack water (only space for 3/4 boats) but were out of luck again so ended up at Womack staithe - very quite (only one other boat moored up)  - so our final night ended up being ""party night"". To sum up- we had a fab few days and would absolutely recommend a very relaxing October break BUT would think it could be quite hellish at the height of the season."
148,Never mind the weather ,"Perfect to relax and unwind.2 choices for a boat ride. You can pay per head to get on to a chartered boat to take you around a set route. Can just walk in - usually lots of boats going out every half hour or so.Alternatively you can hire a boat for a couple of hours, Can work out cheaper for 5+ groups. Definitely need to book that in advance."
149,A wonderful tour in a beautiful setting,"We hired a day picnic boat from Richardsons, Wroxham on the 9th December, mad people you may say, but we have done this whenever we visit the area generally in December.  Graham was really helpful, had the boat warmed up before our arrival.  We had brought provisions with us to make tea and bacon sandwiches, unfortunately the gas did not work properly and it took over an hour to boil the kettle.  We called Graham when we had service and he said he would try and find us and bring a new gas bottle.  Unfortunately he was unable to find us, but that did not spoil our day we had a fabulous time.  We were on our way back when smoke started pouring out from the engine at the back of the boat.  We were fortunate and able to moor up somewhere where we had phone signal.  Graham came out and towed us back full of apologies.  What we could not believe was we received a full refund.  Thank you Graham much appreciated and would definitely use you again.  Richardsons, well done for employing such a wonderful ambassador for your company, would not hesitate to recommend you.  Happy New Year"
150,Boat trip ,We have just returned from a lovely autumnal walk along the boardwalk at Irstead to see Barton Broad. There are Norfolk Wildlife Trust notice boards at the entrance outlining what you might be lucky enough to see. There is a magical feel to this place wandering through the wetland to get to the viewing platform to see the wide expanse of the broad with numerous species of water fowl. There is a disabled car park at the boardwalk but additional car parking for the able bodied a short walk away (half a mile) along a narrow country lane. Worth a visit.
151,Wonderful National  Park!,"The Broads are plain beautiful.Both, the South Broads and the North Broads.Very nice villages and nature at its best.Rent a boat and relax."
152,Broadland Saturn hire boat from Richardson's in Stalham,"We spent 5 days touring the Norfolk Broads in the Herbert Wood's boat Silverlight 2.I would highly recommend a visit to the Broads. Luckily the weather was perfect and we cruised the length and breadth without once returning to the same place.We stopped at lots of fantastic pubs and visited some charming little towns.Its easy to see why the Broads is so popular with anglers, even we managed to catch with little or no experience between us and a budget rod and reel (you will need a rod license for fishing).There are many places where you can moor up for free but generally you will need to pay a small fee (often redeemable).Although we had a big boat and not much experience, navigation and mooring was fairly simple with people only to willing to help (there were many such heroes on our trip). We also took our dog who generally hates water but loved sitting on the boat watching the world go by at 4mph."
153,Scenery beautiful,We took a trip on the Southern Comfort Mississippi Paddle Steamer.  The commentary was excellent and the journey is slow and lovely.  There is a bar / snack bar on board.
154,Fabulous,We had a almost two hour trip of the broads which was very informative  well worth the money. There was seating upstairs but we sat insider.  You Dan take the dogs with you and food and drinks available  only snacks.
155,Stunning,"Had a lovey midweek break with family enjoyed the tranquillity so much we booked our next trip down as soon as we got home. The drive from Glasgow was long but with a few stops and food it passed quickly, once you are there it’s well worth the drive."
156,Much bigger than you imagine,"Lovely trip down the broads from Wroxham, many other boats floating on by so not too peacful, but the scenery is wonderful. Bird life is great and ideal for photography, as are the skies. Well worth a trip on a boat, great yarmouth, Burgh Castle, or Norwich area. Suffolk too but i not able to comment as not sailed there."
157,Hoveton Great Broad Nature Trail,"Been several times and never let down, just beautiful, the wildlife and boats which the children just love, will keep coming back"
158,Great Weekend,"We took a boat trip with Broads on the Belle of the Broads our driver was Ollie with his support Marion, What a fount of information Ollie was he was passionate about the Wroxham Broads and the wild life, Yes it rained all afternoon but that was to our advantage as there were few day boats out but lots of ducks and birds and we were able to observe many of the ducks sitting on their nests."
159,Recharge and relax,"We took a short break and made boat trips onto the Broads and stayed in bed and breakfast accommodation each night. It was wonderfully peaceful, the calm atmosphere on the Broads and the opportunity to observe birds was so relaxing. We were fortunate with good weather too, despite leaving it rather late in the season."
160,Excellent Day Trip,"We visited the Norfolk Broads in late October and almost had The Broads to ourselves.Not knowing what to expect, we had a good time. It's very tranquil and peaceful. The boat hire from Richardson's was sensational. We arrived and were on the boat with 30 mins. Another 30 mins later and we were cruising the rivers.I was quite surprised how far away from the Broads the attractions of the area were. There are only a few small villages actually on the broads, so we had to walk about a mile each time to get to various locations.We only went for a 3 night cruise, which for us was long enough. Had a relaxing time and will probably venture back down that way in a few years time to do it again."
161,Beautiful place to visit,"When EVER you come our delightful county include a day on the broads, so much to do for all ages, sailing, wildlife, and so much more."
162,Beautiful,"We hired Gala Girl II for a short break from Summercraft. We had a great holiday and enjoyed our time on the boat, and had great instruction from Summercraft staff to get us underway. There was however an issue with the bedroom lighting, which caused damage to the lining of the cabin. This could have been dealt with in a friendly, amicable and professional manner. Unfortunately for us, Sue at Summercraft decided to approach things altogether differently.The front cabin of the boat had a fixed internal light that couldn’t be moved, it had a toggle switch beneath it. The bedroom light however was a light that swivelled, allowing the light to be directed. This light fitting was fitted with what we were told later was an ’indicator bulb’, which protruded from the fitting. After being on the boat for a couple of days, we noticed that at some point the bulb had been pointed upwards, making contact with the roof lining, making a burn mark due to the heat of the bulb.I think a lesson to learned here is to use an LED bulb, which generates very little heat and would be fit for purpose in a confined space, and not likely to be a fire risk.We wasn’t certain when the damage was done, we didn’t notice any smell, but pointed out the damage straight away upon our return. We didn’t admit liability as we didn’t remember creating the damage, but did say it may have been from our usage of the light. We may have added to previous damage, we just don’t know for sure, and said as much. We were told not to worry about it, and left with our fuel deposit check. All was well.Sue who I understand to be the owner of Summercraft, called me 30 minutes later to discuss the ‘substantial damage’. She asked if we could return so she could ‘adjust the fuel deposit cheque’. Being a reasonable person I travelled back to Summercraft to discuss the matter.Sue then proceeded to be very rude and aggressive. She relentlessly questioned me, in her words questioning me ‘like a barrister’, but in reality not listening to anything I had to say. She denied that there may have been any design flaw in the lighting that was fitted, and denied that LED lights would have prevented the situation. I would stress again that regardless of who created the damage the situation would not have occurred had the lighting been fixed like the front cabin light, or not movable, or a low heat / LED bulb.I’ve worked in customer facing environments and had to deal with angry customers that won’t listen to reason, won’t listen to what you have to say, and basically just want to shout at you. This felt like that, but with reversed roles. A very unpleasant experience.The cheque we received for £76 pounds was a fuel deposit cheque, not a deposit for damage. Sue appeared to take great pleasure though in tearing up this cheque in front of me. It seemed like she called me back simply for the drama of tearing up the cheque, highly unprofessional, rude and discourteous behaviour. She certainly didn’t want to have a conversation, as she wasn’t interested in anything I had to say.Prior to this we had a great time exploring the Norfolk Broads, and our dealings with the boatyard were fine. A 5-star review would have been given, it’s a real shame that Sue ensured that we left our holiday on a real sour note."
163,family fun,"As part of our organised trip to Norfolk, had the two hour tour from Broads Tours. The Queen of the Broads was clean comfortable, the commentary from the skipper was very informative and passionate about the wildlife and area. Would definitely recommend."
164,Richardson's Rhapsody 3,"Visited for a boating holiday with my 23 yr old son. Lovely weather so was beautiful. Did some fishing , lots of birds to see , kingfishers if your lucky / quiet. Love the broadsSteve & Lewis"
165,Excellent holiday with Richardsons,Spent an excellent couple of hours aboard one of the Broads Tours ships cruising down the River Bure and into the Wroxham and Salhouse Broads. We had a running commentary from Ollie and were well looked after by Sarah. Thoroughly recommended
166,"Overall great service from the staff, But our last boat was a bit run down","A week aboard Tower Bridge from Bridgecraft at Acle, it was fantastic. The friendliest boat company you could ever wish for. Very Covid safe, each boat has antiviral fogging before you get it so you know the boat is safe. Well equipped boats and a wide range of different boats to suit your needs. We love Tower because we like the roof down cruising. We saw 3 otters this year, which is great and a good sign that the population is doing well, although the number of cormorants is worrying and I think they need managing. Had some lovely meals at some great pubs, like the Lion at Thurn and the White Horse at Neatishead. These pubs had great track and trace and were doing table service only well before that became compulsory. The food was also stunning.The Norfolk Broads were busier this year, which I think is because people are not able to go abroad. That said we still had a lovely quiet relaxing time aboard a stunning boat. We will be back."
167,Fabulous,A nice walk which is not a difficult walk it would suit most ages. Very dog friendly but do remember to put your hound on a lead where you are instructed to do so!!
168,Annual day out on the Broads,With my sister I went to the broads for a day. It was good to get out on the water but after an hour I felt it was all pretty much the same. Having said that it is relaxing.
169,Beautiful setting,I've been coming to the broads for almost 40 years and it never fails to please me. Beautiful beautiful location
170,A good place,"You need to visit it to appreciate it you can lose your self in time.  Miles of unspoilt country side miles of beautiful waterways for all to enjoy.  Norfolk May be a long journey for some but the enjoyment will be worth it.  Great river side pubs, restaurants, Wild life outstanding.  Peace and quiet in abundance.   Remember to wear life jackets as they say still waters run deep.I will bet your first visit will not be your last."
171,boat hire,Brilliant holiday on Gala girl she is easy to handle and a ideal size for a couple Summercraft boats always stand out as they are well maintained both inside and out.A ideal start from Wroxam to enjoy the delights of the Northern Broads.
172,Dodge Those Sailing Boats,"Norwich has it all - steeped in history, fab architecture, lots of things to see and do. Excellent restaurants and vibrant nightlife. Something for everyone."
173,Great for Nature,"Travelled the Broads on the Mississippi steamboat which was a beautiful craft, well cared for and with all the facilities, including a bar serving refreshments, alcohol and coffee to make our trip very  comfortable.  The seating is well spaced and comfy and there was plenty of room to move about the boat, to take pictures.  The upper section was for those who like to feel the wind in their hair.  The area is amazing with the most beautiful houses on the waters edge, most with boats moored at the end of their gardens.  It reminded me of the Florida Intracoastal as the properties were of such a class that you saw ‘how the other half lives’.  We enjoyed the trip very much and the commentary from the captain of the boat was both informative and amusing.  A lovely couple of hours spent in a wonderful location."
174,Magical Place,MY 14th time on the broads just got back having another great holiday with Richardson's in Statham u can't possibly go wrong with their boats or their fantastic service every single time I'm back there in april
175,barnbrinkstadff,"Just returned from a short break boating holiday on the Norfolk Broads, using Summer Craft Boat hire in Wroxham. We hired a smaller boat (Glitter Girl) which sleeps four, as it was the first time I had 'skippered' a boat. I had spoken to Sue by email prior to arrival and everything was ready to go on our arrival. David gave us a comprehensive training and safety brief on how to use the boat.We had a great time exploring the Boards. I will never be the greatest Captain in the world. But the experience of using and managing the boat will live long in the memory for me and my son.We had a couple of problems - a leak and a crash, all of which were dealt with by Summer Craft staff with good humor, relaxed and professional attitude. Thank you all for your assistance. it was a great time away."
176,Wonderful boating holiday with Bridgecraft,"The Broads is a lovely part of the country that go's without saying, but having just returned from a boating holiday i'm not too sure I will return again & this is down to the lack of mooring spaces available.This is the 3rd year in a row I've been boating on the broads late September & each year it seems to be busier so finding an overnight mooring is getting to be difficult & that's not just at the popular places like near pubs but out in the countryside.It came to a point where we were planning where to moor in the evening as soon as we got up in the morning before we had been anywhere.I did some rough calculations, the 4 main hire company's on the northern Broads have between them approx. 428 boats, there are also a couple of smaller hire company's as well, if you then add on private boat owners who might be out for a few nights on the rivers the figure is potentially getting up to between 450-500 boats looking for a mooring.According to the broads authority website there are approx. 399 free moorings on the northern rivers down as far as Stokesby. Doesn't take a genius to work out there are more boats than moorings.There are moorings available that you pay for & that ranges between £5 & £10 a night so a 7 night holiday could potentially cost you another £35-£70. I know you can moor free of  charge at certain boatyards but if you were on a caravan holiday would you want to park up at a motorway services every night?Lack of moorings is a problem the B.A need to sort out, I've spoken to others who feel the same way as I do, I also think local businesses & the hire company's should get on to the BA as in the long run it will be them that suffer when people stop visiting the Broads & spending money in the local economy."
177,Simply beautiful,"While we spent a week in Norwich (without a car) we wanted to see something of ""the Broads"" so we took a bus to Wroxham and took a tour on a large tour boat (Broads Tours - 90 minute tour of River Bure, Wroxham Broad, Salhouse Broad). It was fascinating to hear about the Broads and how they were formed and I only wish we could have spent a few days there, perhaps renting a boat on our own. But at least we got to see this beautiful part of Norfolk. Wroxham is very touristy and crowded with people, though...not exactly peaceful and quiet. And the tour boat we were on was a large one and it never stood still, so getting photos of wildlife (mostly ducks, etc.) was difficult. If I had to do it over again, I would go with a small boat company that could stand still and perhaps get closer to the birds. And allow for a few days to visit. Clearly the Broads is a very popular tourist area - full of boats and tourists. Am sure there are quieter areas reachable only by car as one moves towards the coast."
178,Beautiful ,"Richardsons Boat Hire of Salham run a very professional boat hire business.  The collection and return of boats is swift and organised.Rhapsody 3 is a four birth (two bedroomed) holiday cruiser.  The boat has a single diesel engine but is easy to learn to steer and moor.  The double room is a little small but the bed is comfortable.  The bunk room is very small with each bunk measuring as small as five foot ten, however once in the bunks they were comfortable.The kitchen on the boat is small but well equipped.  The cooker and oven work well. The boat needs refilling with water daily, however this is easy even in peek season.Moorings can be found and as long as you moor up by 3pm each day you can easily find spaces.  We moored at both free and paid moorings.  The cost of these was between £8 and £14.Richardson give you ample fuel for a week's cruising.  The only other expense will be a toilet pump out at £12."
179,Wonderful area to visit,"We had a week on the north Broads on a Richardsons boat.  Great company, reasonably priced.  This is a slow, peaceful, take your time, meditative experience - great for relaxing. Highlights include: Thurne, Fairhaven Gardens, How Hill, River Ant, Stokesby, Womack Island.  Technically part of the Broads, the seal colony at Horsey is unmissable.  Closer to Wroxham it gets busier, worth avoiding if you want tranquility.  The landscapes vary from big sky, open, to tree lined and mysterious. In sunshine and full leaf of spring and summer, or autumn colour, this is glorious.  In dull weather or the leafless season the Broads can be bleak and depressing.  Avoid the school holidays.Over a week there are limited areas that can be visited - its a long way to the south Broads with little mooring and few, non-day boats can get under the bridge at Potter Heigham so Hickling Broad is out of reach."
180,Beautiful place to visit,"northern broads, so many good night stops and bars, with some top evening fishing. moored up early most days to enjoy the freaky sunny uk weather! dog spent age sin the water keeping cool and swimming about."
181,Great area with much to see and do ,"Lovely walks in the winter sun, find a pun, bring the dogs. One of the country’s best loved areas and easy to see why"
182,Kl,"I have been extensively on the Broads, with holiday breaks and for work as I shoot for a local luxury Broads boat company commercially , so have seen this beautiful place over the course of so many visits over many years.So many things to do and too many to mention to suit all ages from Boating to Chalet and B&B stays for weekends, day hire or longer.Well worth the visit as there are many waterways to explore at your leisure :)"
183,"a great place,full of adventure.",Got aboard an organised trip from Wroxham through to Horning Ferry and a return trip. It was quite eye opening with the most beautiful properties that you wouldn't normally see on show. There was a very good jazz quartet playing for the entertainment of everyone. They even played some rock and roll for customers to dance to. Well worth the price and I would certainly recommend the trip especially if you haven't experienced the Norfolk Broads.
184,Best little break for many years,"We have just returned from a long weekend on the Norfolk broads. There were 10 family members on 1 boat called Dancing light. Our family age group ranged from 50's to teenagers and inbetween. Because everyone had different expectations we took a trip to the boatyard at Potter Heigham and was able to look around some of the boats to see which ones were suitable before booking it. As we are fairly local we were able to do this. And actually chose the boat that we liked on their site. So the photos and descriptions are really great. The staff I cannot begin to say how helpful and friendly they were at all times,this just added to the enjoyment of our experience. So a huge thank you everyone.Dancing light was a lovely boat had all you could need for your stay. It was cosy for a large group but this made it all the better. A long weekend was just right."
185,Working in the beautiful broads.,"We've been on the Broads many times, with & without our kids & greatly enjoyed it.  However we've returned today (should've been tomorrow) from a disappointing weekend. You're told not to run the engines between 20.00-08.00, however the HEATERS DON'T WORK IF ENGINE NOT RUNNING.  The first night I spent in trainers, 3 layers of tops, 2 sets of trousers, blanket wrapped round & quilt tightly cuddled, my husband also.  It was 8 degrees outside (& inside).   2nd night was similar, hence the 3rd night we are spending at home in the warm.I checked details to ensure there were heaters before booking.  Unfortunately when you haven't slept its harder to enjoy the days.  It was lovely experiencing the Broads again but, as has been previously mentioned, there are SO many boats & yachts now that you need to moor between 2-3 to ensure a space.The heating problem needs to be addressed as boats are hired through October & its very very cold at night with no heaters."
186,Amazing place for a relaxing day out,"We’ve been hiring boats from Richardson’s for the last 6 years and can honestly say that when you return home you do actually feel like you’ve had a nice relaxing time. We love this holiday, we’ve hired the Broadland breeze, the broadsman (a few times) the challenger and the commodore or commander, our favourite was the broadsman, we are going this year and will be travelling on the broads harmony and cannot wait. So many lovely places to stop off for sightseeing, drink, food or even if you just want to cook on the boat or do a bbq, a wonderful, fun and must do holiday, less stressful than a holiday abroad with the airports etc. If you are reading this review and have not done this holiday with Richardson’s of stalham then please try it at least once, they are so professional so accommodating and make the whole process of this kind of holiday so enjoyable."
187,The best National Park by far.,An hour on the broads.You can rent by the hour Half day full day all sorts of little cruisers to bigger boats.We did an hour and yes it’s very easy my husband was the captain of his own boat.Weather was good and so was the boat easy to use and handle round the waterWith no problem.Given a 5 minute instruction how to use and safety features noted.Off we went when we returned did the 2 hour cruise wonderful .
188,Eleven nights of chilling on the South Broads,Had a trip into the broads after work for a walk. Seriously need to hire a boat and stay for a long weekend. The views are stunning and there is so much more to explore.x
189,Interesting and knowledgeable guy - sadly not so much wildlife,If you are searching for peace and tranquillity and a slower pace of life this wonderful hidden gem is for you. The Broads always take me fifty years back in time! The peacefulness of the waterways is complimented by the busy wildlife going about its daily survival routines. A beautiful part of the country and I reccomend hiring a boat for the day to really examine the wildlife and explore these sublime waterways!
190,Breathtaking and relaxing,Fantastic trip - off exploring on our hired boat.  We hired it with no boating experience (you're shown how to before you set off!)Recommend for great family time out.
191,Peaceful,"We stumbled across this one Sunday lunch time and what a hidden gem it was, we paid £7 each for a 50 minute tour in a lovely little electric boat, the staff were very kind and friendly in the store where we bought our tickets and on the boat. Well worth the money and a lovely trip out!"
192,A wonderful natural resource for boaters walkers and birdwatchers.,"We have hired boats before but I have to say Faircraft Loynes/NBD are the perfect Company to hire from, very professional, extremely helpful and really customer oriented. We had a great time on the Viscount 1. Thanks for a brilliant holiday."
193,Tranquil,"Left Wroxham and traveled down the Bure, some off the houses along the river are amazing, occasional complete windmill, but after leaving the trees there's nothing but reeds, you can see the odd something above them. Horning is a stunning village, great pubs, coffee by the river, but finding somewhere to stop is difficult! Easier on other side of river but need small dinghy to cross! At junction of Thurne/Bure got a choice of directions left towards Potter Heigham or right towards Yarmouth. Low bridge at P Heigham and lots of cottages along the river also The lion which was being refurbed, nice food but new staff need a bit of training, places to moor, if empty. Right you have the Acle bridge pub and village, pub is great especially for kids, next is Stokesby with the Ferry Inn no room to moor, on to Stracey Mill paid mooring and water. Shop not quite complete, don't know about mill, no where after this till Yarmouth. Not enough places to moor even if paid and if you want an awsome view try some of the canals elsewhere in Britain, will try a different part next time to see if any better"
194,Fantastic Service,"Staff at Richardson's are very friendly and helpful. Explaining not only safety instructions but local area so my husband and I could get the most out of our morning hire. Great little boat, nice and clean. Thoroughly worth visiting them if you find yourself in the area."
195,Broads and a boat trip.....,"We spent a week in various parts of East Anglia, including a day in the Broads. This included a 90 minute boat tour from Wroxham, a visit to the Broads Museum, Stalham, which included a history of life on the broads and the boats and also Horning."
196,Most relaxing holiday ever,"If you haven’t discovered the Norfolk Broads then you haven’t lived! Hire a Boat either for a day, week or longer, take the kids your camera and your dog and visit the Broads. There is so much to see and do, wildlife, water mills, abbeys and so much more. It is so relaxing, actually why am I telling you this, it’s my secret place"
197,Great Time On The Broads,"very pretty place to visit so much to do, but please do your research as most things book up fast. lovly part of the world"
198,Old fashioned boatyard from 50 years ago.,"Went on the 2 hour Broads cruise and thoroughly enjoyed it. The skipper (Richard) gave a good commentary full of infirmation. The wildlife, history, different style housing and much more was given on the way out, with photo opportunities being shared mainly on the return journey.I had been on this cruise 2 years ago and enjoyed it just as much a second time. Will go again when I next visit the areainfirmation in the office for boat hire for people wanting to spend a longer period or have a boating holiday exploring"
199,A beautiful part of England,"Great for days out or longer stays, plenty to do in fair weather, in bad weather it would be very limited though."
200,Weekend trip on a boat,Been going to the broads since 2000 our parents use to go back in the 70s on the old classic wooden boats love it we even bought our own boat and had 12 years of bless in it with out little dog too . Had to get rid of ours due to relocation but still really enjoy going back on the hire fleets when we have time to travel. Go out of season if u want lest traffic on the rivers 👍xx
201,Lovely slow holiday but chose your time and place,"We booked a small cruiser and set off on a 4 night recommended itinerary stopping at Ludham bridge, Potters Heigham, Acle, Ranworth , Neatishead, Wroxham, Horning and Sutton. We found some excellent pubs and restaurants, amazing sights and very friendly people on our trip. A very relaxing break and a great introduction into boating. We will most likely repeat the experience in a slightly bigger, better equipped boat possibly with more of the family."
202,Boat trips,"Each year for the past 5 my parents have hired a day boat and with my sister and our children we have taken to the Norfolk broads. This year as every other we were treated with the peace and serenity that messing about on the river brings as well as wonderful weather. The beautiful surrounding countryside and abundance of wildlife means we're always spotting somthing new. As well as looking out for favourite landmarks like windmills or St Bennett's Abby and if we're really lucky a Norfolk wherry, although the boys love watching out for sailboats and canoes too. With the children ranging from age 8 to 16 it can mean that finding a day out they all enjoy is difficult. Not so with this. They all love having a go at driving the boat, fishing while we're moored up and a picnic lunch is a win for boys of any age. A highlight of the day is often the point we call over the ice cream boat and cool off with a nice ice lollly each. If you get the opportunity to have a day or even a holiday on the broads you will not be disappointed."
203,Relaxed day,"We had the most wonderful time.  I really wish it could have gone on forever!  Our boat, from Herbert Woods, was clean, easy to handle and reliable and enabled us to explore all of the broads.  It was easy to steer and my wife and I were able to handle things like casting off and mooring up with ease.  The broads are very, very visitor friendly with lots of attractions within easy reach of the rivers, lots of wildlife to see and lots of pubs where we could get meals.  There are no locks on the broads, a major consideration for my wife who's slightly handicapped, so it was plain sailing all the way.  This is definitely one place where we'll be visiting again soon."
204,"Lovely gardens, well kept area","Love the Broads, its a place we come back to time and time again. Nothing better than being on a boat amongst these beautiful rivers and Broads. Very relaxing holiday."
205,Okay but not sure what all the fuss is about,Had a wonderful day on the broads on Saturday on a day boat.  However disappointed that although having spent an extra £20 on having one with a toilet it could not be used as the smell was appalling and when I discussed this was told they are all like this. I have had many different boats over the last 35 years and have never experienced this before and not sure why one is offered if it cannot be used.  My rating is based on the experience of the boat not the broads which I love
206,Brilliant boat tour at wroxham by the info centre,"If you have the chance when visiting Norwich, England you have to rent one of the boats and coast up the waterway. There are many places to stop for a picnic or one of the pubs along the way. If you are in the mood for ice cream not to worry, there is an ice cream boat that cruises up and down. The best thing is the boats are dog and panda friendly"
207,"Good service, great staff",What can I say. We hired a boat for the whole day and we found the river overcrowded with boats with drunk people. After our day we stayed in wroxham for a meal and the place was full of drunk people with some of them fighting in the street. Around every corner there were empty beer bottles with some smashed. I would never return to wroxham itself as it has lost its charm. However the broads are beautiful and made up for our bad experience. I honestly think if they continue to rent boats to drunk people then I can see some people losing their lives.
208,Wroxham River tour by the broads authority ,"Hired a day cruiser, such a very pretty place. A few pubs along the way but the place is filled with lovely views. Highly recommend a visit and hiring a boat."
209,"Glorious afternoon sailing on a 2 hour tour of the Norfolk Broads, wonderful scenery and wildlife","I'm not sure that any review can do justice to this beautiful part of the country. Broad (inland lake) after Broad each one with its own characteristics. Some can be reached by walking, others only by boat. Several boatyards hire out boats either by the day or for longer holidays. A leisurely way to enjoy the beauty of East Anglia"
210,Heaven in East Anglia,We have just finished our holiday with Richardson's at stalham on spring horizon 2 boat. Despite the weather we have to say that we couldn't fault the staff at Richardson's. They want above and beyond to make sure we were safe and warm. Even the engineers were great. All service was provided with a smile anf we will definitely return again and again. Fantastic boatyard fantastic staff. Amazing customer service from all
211,4 night trip,Wroxham was recommended to us and was busy even in the winter.  The boats were many but not exactly as we expecting more canal type  vessels.  Maybe the wrong place for that.
212,Fascinating places,Very peaceful on the water lots of birds and fresh airPerfect treat from work and worriesHired a boat the staff couldn’t be more patient and helpful
213,Take a boat and take your time,"We spent three days on the Broads in a delightful barge called Silver Gem. Our accommodation was great, and the Broads are (on the whole) tranquil and relaxing. We were given a detailed map and our 'Captain' was given a brief lesson on how to handle the driving. The Broads are well sign posted, and with an average speed limit of around 4-5 mph, you can't go wrong. My only complaint is that a LOT of the mooring is private and on our second evening, we struggled to find anywhere to tie up, eventually finding a spot that charged £10 for the night. I hate to imagine what happens in summer."
214,Such a great day,"Had a great time in the broads in early August, two families sharing a Herbert Woods cruiser, Jewel of Light 3.  This boat was a bit battered and past its prime but everything worked as it should, could have done with been cleaned better as we found old food, socks and even an old pound coin when moving the beds around, bissgest issue was having to run the engine for at least 3 hours per day to keep the fridge running, there was no electric hookup on this model, though only a few moorings had hookups anyway.We went from Potter Heigham to Acle Bridge the first night and got moored up without issue and ate in Pedros, nice food and you get the mooring fee back in the restaurant.Then onto Great Yarmouth yacht station were again we had no problem mooring, we had contacted the yacht station in advance to find the best times to turn up but we didn't see anyone get turned away the two nights we were there, though they were double mooring some boats.  We were entertained by some boaters trying to park their fancy cruiser with bow thrusters against the outgoing tide, top tip, bow thrusters aren't as powerful as the outgoing tide raging down a river, so listen to the yacht station attendants and always go into the tide to moor up, makes life a lot easier and doesn't make you look like a muppet.We then went up the River Yare and stayed the night in Loddon, we went right to the end of the navigation and waited a few minutes for people to leave and we managed to get a rare spot right next to the entrance to the village.  We had tried to time it so we would be getting there just as the days boats would be leaving to get back to where they were hired from and it worked out for us.From Loddon we went to Norwich and moored up at the Yacht Station for 2 nights, I'd recommend going towards the end of the moorings as near the beginning you are very close to the pub and it is noisy until late.The broads past Great Yarmouth seemed much quieter than around Potter Heigham, I'd happily go back but probably choose a nicer boat this time."
215,You don’t want to visit here,"Just finished a family holiday in the area, some days on a boat going from Wroxham to Hickling and then in Filby with friends. Weather was mainly dry which no doubt makes a big difference on this type of holiday. Not a cheap holiday when boat hire, fuel, food, etc all taken into account but floating down the rive at 5mph just watching the world go by and wildlife is so relaxing. Breakfast and lunch we did ourselves but ate in pubs at night. Other than the first place they were generally very good, a few issues in some but nothing that would stop us going back to any of them. Obviously lovely to see friends, lucky them, really great places to eat in the vicinity. Even rediscovered a great transport cafe on the way home. Would recommend the holiday and area to all. Marie."
216,Adventurous,"very polite and helpful young man who dealt with us made everything easy to understand .had a picnic boat for a full day and loved it ,on our return the young man was stood waiting to help us moor up which made it so much easier very polite will certainly be using jb boat hire again so much more polite than the guy at Barnes brink craft who we used last year he went home and left us to moor up on our own bit dawniting on your very first boat trip in a yard full of boats"
217,Can't fault it,"we have been away on Richardsons Boating holidays , Stalham for a number of years now , and I cannot rate them highly enough. their staff are very knowledgeable and friendly , nothing is too much.We will be back with them this year , and the best part of it all is the pace ,  this is a holiday where you want to slow down , so if your life is really busy , this is the ideal break for you ."
218,Water Water everywhere,"Fantastic, do it.  Last used richardsons 20 years ago and this time took my children for their first experience and they loved it.  We hired a boat for 4 days and the the whole proecess from check-in, boat familiarisation and hand back was seamless. Everyone on the team there was happy and pleased to see you.  There is so much to do and just switching off and watching the wildlife slowly pass you by was great.  The kids can get involved too with steering the boat and helping to tie up and they loved mooring up on the side of the riverbank on our own with just the birds for company overnight.  A great adventure. Like anything you can hire, you get what you pay for so do your homework on what kind of boat meets your needs as It can be as cheap or as expensive as you want it to be. Kids want to know when we are going next."
219,A Great place for a staycation!,We were lucky because there was an open day at the Norfolk Broads Yacht Club.  The person operating the yacht was 78 and very experienced and fit.It was great fun and beautiful.
220,Silver Mystique and a lovely week,A triumph of human ingenuity allowing the use of low lying land for farming. We visited Horsey Windpump which is currently being renovated and had a walk around the Mere.
221,Sue at Summercraft Boats ruined a lovely holiday for me and my family.,Broads excellent done this many timesStaying on Carousel boat from Richardsons this is a lovely boat 3rd time now but it isn’t as good as it was the first time we used it . Although it’s very nice it need to be improved in the bathrooms no glass ( l had to make one to store tooth brush etc out of a old pop bottle) also no where in rear bathroom to store toiletries it really need a cupboard or a shelf or something as the only shelf is on the flor at the side of the toilet 🤬!! So my advice is to bring a plastic glass and maybe a stick on holder although you should not have to for the price of the boat other than that bedding towels etc are all nice and clean .See pics for toothbrush holder made from a plastic bottle note the space where a cupboard can go .
222,Easter Holidays,I had originally planned to walk all the way from Norwich to Great Yarmouth along as much of the waters as I could. However after walking for 5.5 hours on the Saturday with scenery that was not particularly inspiring - largely because it was a dull day with a thick low cloud cover - I decided to go back to Norwich. I walked a short distance inland and caught a bus from Rockland St Marys. On the Sunday I caught a bus to Loddon and followed the signs for around 5 miles through little country lanes and fields to Reedham ferry. This walk is very well signposted and quite pretty. After walking through Reedham you walk right next to the water all the way to Great Yarmouth. The walkway is raised a few metres and therefore you can see for miles ... vast expanses of blue and green. (tho perhaps the blue would be more grey on a cloudy day) This walk is 9.5 miles and was absolutely stunning. I had a few hours all to myself in vast expanses of pure nature with only the windmills and a couple of houses next to the walkway to remind me of any form of human civilization.
223,A real gem hidden away. ,"Having visited Wroxham many times decided to do about trip. First did the larger and longer trips that are easy to find but  we found a better trip. This boat ride is not easy to find but worth it, preferred this to the lager boats. The large boat companies go one way but a short walk the opposite side of Wroxham bridge, hidden amongst the trees is the Broads Authority tour. It is a smaller boat, only carrying 12 people but goes in opposite direction to the bigger boats. Very tranquil, see lots of wildlife on the way, friendly and informative skipper. For OAPonly £6, lasts approximately 50 minutes. Very enjoyable"
224,Holiday on broadway,"Just got back from the broads and had a lovely week on a lovely boat, we were on Far Horizon H, this boat is a lovely and comftable boat, staff very helpful with any questions would highly recommend, look forward to going back later in the year, no complaints thanks to richardsons for making a smooth holiday, and a bonus was there was hardly any other boats around and weather was fine."
225,Relaxing Family Holiday,"This is a really friendly company with helpful staff and good customer service. Nice boat, clean, and helpful advice as to free moorings at local pubs and timings.  Lovely part of the world. ."
226,Magestic gem Richardson’s Stalham,"Found huge free car park behind station with easy walk to village centre, booked 2 hour boat trip on river. Plenty of places for coffee,snacks etc near or on riverside.Boat trip informative, we saw a Kingfisher, Heron, Swans, ducks etc good commentary onboard."
227,Absolutely stunning,"We were five adults hiring the above boat. The boat was ultra clean and the towels and bedding beautifully laundered. We had a lovely welcome pack full off goodies and there were even complimentary shampoos, etc in the bathrooms. We took the boat from Wroxham down to Acle and had a wonderful meal in Pedro's. The fishing was good everywhere and we had great fun with our fishing competition. On our last night we moored at the New Inn and had a nice meal there. Thank you yet again Gus for helping us moor!Two tips. Tie your dinghy on with only one rope. The Broads Direct staff used two and we had to bail the dingy out within 30 mins of leaving Wroxham. Other tip - leave your loo roll outside when showering if you don't want to end up with a soggy mess! Perhaps Broads Direct could fit a plastic cover somehow?"
228,Beautiful norfolk,Only saw part of Broads by Needam Ferry as we were avoiding large traffic queues into Great Yarmouth but parts that we saw were tranquil with lovely views and hope to revisit another time.
229,Relaxing,I own a small motor cruiser which I moor in Brundall.  Went through Gt Yarmouth to the Northern Broads for a 6 night holiday with a friend.   Northern rivers are much busier than the Southern ones but enjoyed revisiting most of the area.
230,L Burges,"Whether you are an angler, a walker, a sailor, a birdwatcher, an artist or photographer then the Broads will surely impress you. Many excellent pubs and restaurants, especially on the Rivers Waveney and Yare. Not always ideal for people with limited mobility though but as an outside adventure location it takes some beating. Please come, it's an area of some really outstanding natural beauty but don't think that you are visiting a national park, that is just a misleading branding. The Broads is the Broads, home to some outstanding wildlife."
231,Beautiful rivers and views,We have just got back from a lovely long weekend on the Broads.  We hired an 8 berth cruiser from Richardsons (Serenade 2).  We picked it up in Wroxham and had a leisurely couple of days.  The boat was roomy (8 of us) and clean.  We were lucky with the weather and had 2 gloriously sunny days - only the Sunday into Monday were wet.  We didn't mind that though.
232,I’m lucky enough to live here,"We hired a day boat and had a very enjoyable day, not really suitable for 2 but as there was 4 of us it made the mooring process easier, even if we did make onlookers laugh! Very relaxing saw lots of wildlife herons, swans."
233,Norfolk Broads,"We were a party of 4 adults and booked a super 3 bedroomed  boat from Richardsonof Stalham.They were extremely professional and well organised,all the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.We spent 4 days touring both north and south broads and found plenty   of pubs along the way with moorings.We were travelling the 1st week in September so would imagine the mooring situation is not so easy during peak season.I believe you can pre-book mooring places if you plot out your route first.The sceneryand houses along the broads is amazing !! Would definitely recommend if you want a relaxing break away from it all.If you like nature this will be for you , we were lucky enough to see Otters,Curlew,Heron,Kingfishers to name but a few."
234,Lovely places to visit from a boat,Richards at horning are the frendliest and helpful boat hire company I have booked with. 4th time Ive been to the norfolk broads they are the best yet. Will book with them again.
235,so beautful,"Our first experience of staying on a boat was great.  We chose the Broads as we are a family of 3 and no locks seemed sensible.  We set off from Roy's wroxham, that was pretty much as I remembered.   The Broads are calm and friendly, most people wave as they pass.  The restaurants are great and plentiful.  My only gripe is the moorings.  Over the 4 nights we only got one mooring with electricity.  Everywhere was very busy, but we found somewhere to moor each night with water.  Some of the moorings charge but this seemed to be very hit and miss as there wasn't a person to pay.  I know the pay machine at one of the mooring has been ridiculed, but it does make sense.  For the ones without pay facilities it would make sense if you could pay by card or on the web etc.  I personally would have appreciated this as I found it hard to relax expecting a stranger to knock on the door asking for a fee.All in all a great holiday and a great experience.  The wildlife is amazing and very friendly."
236,Take a boat ride on the Broads of Norfolk county.,"Apart from finding the lanes confusing,  and towns like Wroxham too bustling, we had a lot of super tranquil moments watching waterbirds, deer and all kinds of other birds. Pubs handy too!"
237,The African Queen,"Such a great holiday.  So much easier to manoeuvre a smallish boat on the Broads than narrow boats on canals. Everywhere we have stopped people have been so friendly - tourists and locals alike. Yes it has rained, and on occasion it has been cold, but the boat is perfectly comfortable and warm. It is idyllic moored up close to reed beds watching the amazing variety of bird life."
238,Wonderful relaxing area,"First time out into the broads. Went and did a lot of walking, among the fens, marshlands and walkways. Saw lots of bird wildlife but no Marsh Harriers. Saw Great CrestedGrebe chicks. Also went Otter spotting but to no avail although at one lake shown photos of their local Otter. Lovely area, lots more to see and do and lot of eating places around."
239,Fantastic way to see Norfolk,"We had a lovely week and thought the Richardson's staff were both extremely friendly and professional. We certainly don't have any complaints! Our boat was from their classic fleet, so in all honesty we weren't expecting it to be quite as nice and as well equipped as it was. It was perfect for us and we would highly recommend it.  There does seem to be a bit of a lack of free moorings along the Broads and some evenings we struggled to find somewhere before dark, but always got somewhere in the end. I can't imagine it would be much fun finding a decent mooring in the height of summer though! All the pubs and shops we visited along the Broads were fab and surprisingly all open, despite it being out of season. We did stock up on groceries before we set off at the Tesco's in Stalham and we always managed to find somewhere to top up with essentials like bread and milk. We also stopped off at Great Yarmouth to visit a supermarket which was only a short walk away from our mooring. Highly recommend the King's Head in Ludham for a decent meal and drink - didn't think so much of The Dog at Ludham Bridge - despite its recommendations - food below average for price and staff not particularly friendly. The Ferry Inn in Stokesby was another lovely pub - not the cheapest but really yummy food and large portions, a great view and free moorings - staff are very friendly too. The scenery on the Broads is truly beautiful, no matter what the weather. I can't imagine how anyone can not give this place 5*s. The Broads are one of the most beautiful places in Britain. A really peaceful and relaxing holiday and we cannot wait to return in 2020."
240,Special day out!,These man made broads result from peat diggings and cover much of the area between Norfolk and Suffolk.During school summer holidays they can be very busy and the pubs crowded. If you can go in a quieter period thesecbroads provide a great way to relax. Unlike canal holidaysthere are no locks to deal with.
241,Excellent Service,"We regularly hire a boat for anything from 3 to 10 nights. We have done so for about ten years, taking up to three breaks a year. There are many boatyards and we have used four of them. *Richardsons, was our least favourite in terms of quality, service and value for money. We would not use them again and would not recommend them. *Ferry Marina are better in all aspects but are relatively expensive. *Herbert Woods tick all the boxes. They are very friendly and helpful. Their boats are of good quality, and extensive research and experience has shown them to be the best overall value, without hidden charges and the universally accepted discount card makes eating cheaper too. *Martham Boats have wonderful old wooden boats (less luxurious, though) that are a delight and will take you to parts of the broads that no others will. A lovely yard and unique.There are things to do to suit everybody and you are free to please yourself. A truly wonderful holiday that will delight you."
242,Boat 🚤 ,"We hired a boat for 5 days from  faurcraft loynes. The boat was ideal for two and small enough to handle as we’re both novices. Becky gave us an excellent tuition and we received a lovely starter pack of tea, coffee, milk, biscuits, crisps and (my favourite) a bottle of Prosecco. The views and places to visit are wonderful. Especially mooring up at the new inn in Horning"
243,Avoid peak season if you can,"Just returned from a weeks on the Norfolk Broads on a Richardson’s Boating holiday on board Broadsman 6.The boat was a touch cramped for 7 people, but otherwise an excellent break.The boat was ready for our arrival.The staff are friendly, helpful and the chap who introduced us to our boat gave us a few tips we found helpful during our week away.We book each year in October half term and find these breaks to be the most relaxing of the entire year year.Richardson’s are a good company to deal with, prices are very reasonable and the Broadsman is a great class of boat. Thank you guys for helping make our break a great one and we'll be back next to year."
244,Not everyone has 6 fingers,Absolutely shocking place! Called 4 days in advance and was told we couldn’t book any boats and to turn up at half 8 for first come first serve. Was in the line for 45 minutes and had around 6 people in front of us to be told we have no boats until 2:45pm!! Walked away for another family around 4 people behind us to get a boat! I will never use these again! There customer service is shocking and it was a complete waste of time!!
245,you must visit sharingham,Hired a small boat for the day. Good value for money. Took a picnic and wine.  Bought ice cream off a boat passing by. Had a lovely family day lots of laughs plus a good place to nose at the fab houses and try out pubs along the way.  Great way to meet people when you Moor to stretch the legs. Our birdwatcher loved seeing the diverse array of our flying friends and at times could hardly contain THIER excitement.
246,Boating adventure playground,"Had a boat out last weekend, boat was Capri.  Richardson’s staff brilliant, so helpful.  Boat was a bit small but fine, loved the broads so relaxing.  First time on a boat, apsolutely  loved it.  Will definitely be going again, maybe not in August.  So many insects coming in through the windows at night.  Great time."
247,The UAE Broads in Norwich,"Just returned from a two week holiday on the broads with Richardsons. The first week we had a few minor problems but the team at Richardsons were never more than an hour away and  had our problems sorted in a matter of minutes. Fantastic service. The four of us are getting on a bit and found our boat a little cramped. After the first week we returned to the stalham marina. We met with the manager Chris and without going into to much detail, this very kind and understanding  man, along with his team sorted our second week with no fuss. I cannot  say how much the team made our holiday  so amazing. The broads are a beautiful place to visit and almost every port of call had staff who are helpful.  Having never boated before i would highly recommend you try it. Try it with Richardsons, everything is made so easy. Thanks to all of you for a fantastic two weeks. Look forward to seeing you all  again."
248,Forth bridge 2.,"My hubby and I hired a boat today. We had a lovely sunny morning then the weather was unkind as the afternoon was just rain, rain, rain. But it did not dampen our day. We had the Lady B boat, toilet on board, with hand washing facilities. The boat was lovely and very clean. We had a great day. Thankyou JB boat hire. We will definitely be back to hire again on our next visit here. Best wishes from Mr and Mrs Fletcher."
249,Amazing history,"I have owned properties and have worked on the Norfolk Broads for many years. Although I have moved away from the area a number of years ago, I still visit frequently. The Northern Broads are the best to visit for a quick boating holiday starting at Wroxham. Ferry Marina in Horning provide excellent quality boats and are quite reasonable. Enjoy"
250,A must when visiting Norwich,"Don't go through life without taking a vacation renting a cruiser or sailing yacht (if you have sailing as a skillset) There a miles of waterways, places of interest to visit, Norwich, Great Yarmouth and the picturesque broads in the North around Wroxham & Horning.Choose a yard in the Wroxham Horning area initially then strike down the Bure, stay overnight moored at a pub, or just sling the mudweight over the side in one of the Broads self cater and cook on board or eat ashore at one of the many riverside restaurants and pubs.It's an excellent break with stuff to do all the time."
251,"Lovely dawns, vast skies and wonderful sunsets","I came to the broads on a hire boat almost every year as a child and now I live here. If you want a holiday where the pace of life is relaxed, the wildlife amazing and the scenery breathtaking, come and visit."
252,Unique waterways,We were both knocked out by the beauty before us on our 2 hour afternoon tour from Wroxham. Tom our guide was excellent pointing out wildlife on the riverbank and reeds. The sun was shining and the unspoilt atmosphere were delightful. English countryside at its best!
253,Tranquility in abundance,Hiring the boat was very easy. On arrival we were quickly shown the main controls for driving the boat and were on our way within 15 min of arrival. Spent 7 hours exploring the network of the broads and found that the time went very quickly. We went with friends and have suggested that we should do this again
254,First visit to Broads ,"My wife and I have lived on our sailing boat for the past 12 years, cruising the Atlantic and Caribbean. Our week aboard San Suzanne was a different experience for us. We had a wonderful time, with the help of Richardson's superb organization and great staff. It was a totally relaxing and tranquil holiday, very enjoyable to see the wildlife and countryside. San Suzanne was one of the less expensive boats of their fleet but had everything we needed, WiFi, TV,4 ring gas cooker oven and grill. Would have liked a microwave, but no big deal. It was a 12 volt boat, but we are accustomed to being economic with power. The facilities and moorings on the rivers and broads were excellent, couldn't fault any of it. Can't wait to come again and cruise the areas we missed."
255,Richardson’s Boating Holiday,sharngham is a very nice sea side town they also have a steam trains running also.there are lots of places were you can get food.
256,Fantastic slow-paced and relaxing boating holiday,"As a group of 8 friends, we have just returned from a long weekend on one of the boats.  Not only was the boat fantastic, the service fro Richardson’s was exceptional.  Richard in particular was so helpful, but all the staff and service was above and beyond what you would expect, thanks very much for helping mak3 a weekend perfect."
257,Lovely and Relaxing,Returned again to this lovely part of the country sailed all over ate in various places some really good but seen various birds caught loads of fish all the family enjoyed it
258,Beautiful area to visit,hired a boat on the broads from richardsons boats  the boat was very old tottaly out of date should be scraped  it was at lest 40 years old broken toilet seat broken tap water leaking trough windows in bed roome boat not fit for use  a disgrace in this day and age
259,October on the broads,"Pamela my wife and twenty five or so other ladies all attended aHen Party firstly on the Broads, and then after most stayed in a nearby Travelodge Hotel and all had a Dinner in the City of Norwich"
260,Umpteenth holiday here,"We had a fab day on a family boat!  I had an amateurish turn at the helm, and it went very well when I wasn't shoving reed banks with the bow.We had a delicious picnic on board and we enjoyed the quiet and lovely views.The holiday homes were very quaint and were located in peaceful spots.We would love to discover more;"
261,Bridgecraft Boatyard Acle,"This was my 1st time out cruising in the winter, and as all the other seasons the Norfolk Broads doesn't disappoint. I was boating, and it was lovely to have the rivers to ourselves and to be able to get a mooring anywhere. Getting water was a bit more challenging as some hoses were off but other than that it was lovely. Waking up afloat on a cosy boat on those cold crisp mornings was a joy. The wildlife is still out in full swing, at this time of year and the fishing is still good. If you're considering a winter break here I couldn't reccomened it enough. Check out the Wroxham Hotel or Maltesers pub for a roaring fire."
262,Faircraft Loynes are the Best. ,"We have sadly just sold our motor boat purely because for the time spent on her and the cost to just keep her on the Broads, the cost has now outweighed the benefits for us. We are so lucky to have this beautiful area but very little investment over time has resulted in less to do whilst on the Southern Broads. The Northern Broads are still very busy and well maintained. As a first time holiday destination, the Norfolk Broads still has masses of appeal and is a great thing to do but as a regular user, the same trips become less value for money in my opinion."
263,Great relaxation,"My first trip to the Broads lived up to my expectations and I couldn't possibly cover everything I hoped in just a short week. We were on a hire boat and managed to navigate the Bure, the Ant and the Thurne rivers with a different place for each overnight stop. Birdlife was plentiful and varied, the windmills and windpumps were as iconic and photogenic as I hoped.Definitely a place we will return to in the near future."
264,peace,"We hired a boat at Wroxham, £80 for 4 hours. Anyone can drive. Moored had way round for lunch. A great way to spend an afternoon."
265,Beautifull part of the country but....,"We took a boat out late August, early September on the southern broads, we were aged between 6 and 63. A great time had by all. The residents of the broads were friendly, helpful and enhanced our stay. The boat big enough to relax and play. Wildlife to view and good food to enjoy."
266,This visit is a given,"We hired a luxury craft from Broom in Brundal and pottered around the southern Broads for the duration. The weather was fabulous and this time of year there wasn't too many other folk on holiday, apart from the weekend. Sticking to the South was key to the plan to chill and wind down and as we know the Broads well and have travelled the entire area many times, we knew where to go. Recommended moorings for peace and quiet are: Rockland Short Dyke, Worlingham Staithe, Brundall Church Fen and Aldeby Hall. There are lovely walks from all of these. Rockland Dyke into Rockland St Mary to visit the village shop is a good fun trek but best of all is Brundall Church Fen into the village which takes you over the marsh on a boardwalk. Very very pretty. But be careful crossing the railway.Wildlife and nature and big skies abound. This visit we actually saw Adders. Wow! Reed Warblers, Cuckoos, Marsh Harriers are everywhere as are various geese and ducks. The long days and big skies conspire to produce a place of haunting beauty and calm and I just love it!"
267,Jb boat hire horning Norfolk,"Booked a Broom Captain Boat for two adults and two children. We were given Captain 3 boat. Old tired and very uncomfortable pull out bed. Biscuit thin mattress with metal bars sticking into you.  Disgusting tiny smelly shower area, small poorly fitted kitchen. Took nearly three hours to contact out of hours emergency. What a waste of time that was as not a bit interested in assisting. A rude, inconsiderate man who had no customer skills whatsoever. I could go on for ages about the disaster with the lack service we received from the moment we arrived. What’s the point they are not interested in providing a service. Clearly a failing organisation who won’t be around much longer unless they improve their boats, stop penny pinching and employ properly trained staff."
268,Holiday in area,"just come back from the broads hired a boat merrymore 3 from barnsbrinkstaff nice boat but nothing on it would work only the tv, toilets would not let you pump water in before you used it on both toilets microwave kept shutting down windows would not open properly only one bedroom where you could get changed the other 2 bedrooms where only big enough for small children first time we opened canopy the plastic fell offwe only got the boat at 4 o clock after driving by car  six hours only yo ber told it was not ready, when we finished our holiday we took the boat to the boatyard the night before as we had to hand the boat back by nine in the morning  we asked was this ok and they said yes thats fine only to be told on the saterday morning we could have not have money refunded for fuel there and then because we brought boat back the night before so waiting to see if they refund us for the fuel wich we had to leave our bank details BUT WHEN WE GOT OF THE BOAT THERE WHERE BOAT CLEANERS WAITING  BUY THE BOAT AS WE WHERE GETTING OUR STUFF TO LOAD THE CAR WHY THEN DID WE ONLY GET BOAT AT 4 IN THE EVENING WONT BE GOING WITH THEM AGAIN"
269,Third time lucky ,this has been our 13 year  on th broads  life at a slow pace good food peace or party time the chioice is yours
270,Trip not to be Missed,"The Norfolk Broads was always the location of our yearly family vacation when i was a kid growing up. Now that I'm older and have my own partner I have taken my family and friends on a holiday to share my love of the area.The waterways are truly beautiful, the many quaint villages are lovely to visit and generally there is a peaceful atmosphere. Every time I have visited the Norfolk Broads I have done so by means of a boating holiday either from the Stalham area or Wroxham. The holidays can be expensive in comparison to cheap Spanish package deals etc but I feel its worth the money."
271,Great day out (be weary of weather!),"Barnes Brinkcraft Boating Holiday – 05.08.2017 to 12.08.2017Boat -  Romany 1 Day 1 – Sat 05.08.2017 – Raining quite heavily when we arrived I got saturated by the rain, it did not help any that it took 3 attempts to find Romany 1 boat. Boat was leaking in every  cabin and seating area. Drawers were smelling when we came to put our clothes in them. We all used toilets at pub we stoped at to have a meal.Day 2 – Sun -06.08.2017 – when we had settled in we became aware of the terrible smell through out the boat. The toilets were inadequate – deplorable –  Toilet seat too small to do your business on – Sanitation was unhealthy. Boat appeared it had not been cleaned before we got it. Rain started again at night time.Day 3 – Mon – 07.08.2017 – rained all day adding to our problems. For a boat it leaked every where, [thought boats were supposed to be water proof]. [Stupid me].Day 4 – Tues – 08.08.2017 – Raining again Front Cabin getting worst + the Smell.Day 5 – Wed – 09.08.2017 – One of the kids birthday today, we were planning all kinds for his special day but every one was to wet and cold to get in the swing of it.Someone told us about Waverley camp site, so we went there and had a great time [nice and dry]. The family in the front cabin hired a YURT Tent for a £100 for the night just to have somewhere dry.Day 6 – Thur – 10.08.2017 – Stopped raining [am], we all decided to go home a day early  because of conditions. Day 7 – Fri – 11.08.2017 – Mini Bus coming 2pm to take us home. Barnes Brinkcraft kept saying SORRY – SORRY – SORRY. This holiday was a get together of our family who we dont see very often which was destroyed by the boat we hired for a week. My sister and her husband plus his family were on Romany 2, they had the same problems as us. My Son and  his wife had same problems - MoorhenTHESE 3 BOATS SHOULD NOT BE FOR HIRE TO ANYONE. Barnes Brinkcraft should hang there HEADS IN SHAME. The Broads are wonderful shame about the boats. My experience is based on the boat not the broads which I loved.Terrible-Horrid"
272,Boat trip on the Vintage rivervboat,Lovely part of the country -never been before and were well impressed.  Roads can be busy in high season but not too bad in mid-September.  Some lovely villages/pubs/bars/restaurants etc - just makes you want to explore.  We'll be back!
273,Lovely day,"Drive the m25 five days a week in a petrol tanker (not saying who for ) but very stressful so my purchase of a brooms 30 was possibly the best thing i have ever brought, and i've had some lovely things in my life....from one extreme to another and would not swap it for the world ....any one now know me"
274,Peaceful cruise,"We are in the middle of a week on the Norfolk Broads.We live only 40mins away but have never done it till now.It is absolutely stunning!Boat is comfortable and everything we need.The first couple of moor ups were a little fraught but we are now used to it.Best to get moored up mid afternoon as spaces become limited especially the free moorings.We moored at Acle overnight and had a meal in Pedros Mexican restaurant, we paid £10 for overnight mooring and then £10 was taken off of our food bill.We hired our boat via hoseasons from Richardson’s in Stalham.We would definitely do it again,We are now off to spend the rest of our week exploring!"
275,Freezing cold-heaters don't work when engines not on!,"Ross is a knowledgeable and passionate guy who makes the trip. At this time of the year not much to seem hot weather, etc.Everyone enjoyed it, my only negative point was why charge for dogs (£1 each), they don't take up room, or enjoy trip, or anything, seems a bit greedy."
276,A lovely couple of hours,"Last went 40 years ago,wish we hadn't left it so long.5 days of complete relaxation on little cabin cruiser from Richardsons. Mooring up beside lovely pubs and walking into villages like England used to be and ought to be,and just living simply without all the stuff we surround ourselves with was perfect."
277,Norfolk Broads boating holiday.,"Perhaps I expected too much but I found the whole ""Broads"" experience a little underwhelming ....the area is quite spread out so I guess it depends where you are exactly - there were some quite nice pubs and villages, plus seaside to access, but inland other than the occasional boat mast, and windmill not much to look at ...."
278,Wonderful Norwich,"This was our second year hiring a cruiser for a week on the North Norfolk Broads, our first time through Norfolk Broads Direct, we had the Fair Commissioner. The whole week was excellent from pick up to drop off. We arrived early to pick up our boat, we parked up and let them know we were ready as soon as they were, and they did get our boat ready a couple of hours ahead of the official collection time. They gave us a lovely hamper on arrival, with a bottle of Cava, milk, tea bags, biscuits, crisps etc which was very thoughtful and appreciated. We didn’t have an itinerary this time, we just tried to go to places we hadn’t gone to last year, plus a couple of our favourite places from last time. So first night was St Benet’s Abbey. Day 2 to Neatishead,  lovely mooring, quiet with a short walk to the White Horse pub. Day 3 Stokesby outside the Ferry Inn, its £5 to moor there. Day 3 we went down to Stracey Arms Windpump. Then on to Fleet Dyke where we moored up for the night. Walked into South Walsham village which is over a mile walk. Day 4 up to Potter Heigham for the night. Here we rang for an Indian Take Away which was delicious. Day 5 to Sutton Staithe. Then we wild moored at a nice spot on The Ant between Barton Broad and How Hill. Day 6 Ranworth, nice Staithe with a shop, café & pub. Day 7 was early start back to Wroxham for 9am to return the boat. Excellent holiday. We managed to get £90 back for fuel even though I felt we had travelled a fair amount throughout the week."
279,Day trip tp Wroxham,This is it. I don’t want to go home while I am here. The Broads are awesome with fantastic little communities dotted around the waterways. I needed time to relax and get myself back up and motoring. It was a boating break that did it for me. When can I go again?
280,RANWORTH BROADS A NATURAL BEAUTY,Have visited several times now a must if you have never been you won’t be disappointed plenty to see plenty to do Wonderful wild life all around don’t be in a hurry take it slow  then you will definitely seePlenty
281,Nice day out at Wroxham,"The Magestic Gem is an older boat but it has plenty of room and comfortable. She handles well but would not trust going to the lower broads past Yarmouth as the engine would not cope with the tidal waters. A bit drafty and the heating could use an overhaul, the galley had everything we needed and the oven worked well, but other than that we had a great time with the family of 7. I would recommend the boat but will give it 8 out of 10, only due to her age. Richardson’s did us proud again and would use them again. A*"
282,Great holiday.....,"Don’t make the mistake of thinking The Broads are just about being on the water in a boat.  Wandering the roads, even where they end up as a dead end against a stretch of water, is just as rewarding.  Walking is the prime means of seeing this unique countryside and landscape (though it’s a bit on the flat side for the photographers amongst you - what a surprise).  Nature is everywhere - a paradise for bird-watchers and botanists.  History is everywhere.  The ruins of St Benet's Abbey near Horning are a prime example; The Church and the Abbey have a unique history that is worth outlining.  The Rector of St Benedict’s Horning is the Prior of St Benet's Abbey.  The Bishop of Norwich is the Abbot.  The Abbey was the only one in England not to be dissolved by Henry VIII.  In 1915 St Benet's Abbey became one of the first Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Britain. The Norfolk Archaeological Trust, which looks after several of the most important historic sites around the county, bought the monastic precinct in 2002 and the gatehouse and mill in 2004. The church ruins are still owned by the Diocese of Norwich and are still a consecrated site; there is a service there every year in the open countryside beside the water. That’s just for tasters!  Go on the web and plot all those wonderful sites just waiting for you to discover them.  There are fine pubs and B&Bs everywhere you look.  My family came from this area and lived there up until the 1880s when, like people the country over, they were forced off the land and into the rapidly-growing industrial cities of the Victorian age.  I've been visiting this area all my life and never tire of it, and I never fail to find something I've not seen before."
283,annual family holiday,"I've always gone to the Broads every year, usually during the summer, but this summer we didn't get around to doing it so we decided to go today. Obviously the weather wasn't up to scratch, however it was sunny for the most part which still made our trip extremely relaxing and lovely. Check the weather before you choose the date you'll go on the Broads! I'm so glad I did because we were originally going to go on Saturday, which was thunderstorms and torrential rain. Sunday was a lot nicer and the weather held up nicely."
284,Nice but touristy,"when all is said about how man is changing our landscape for the worse, heres something to think about. Did you know the broads was formed by man made inlets to aid farming?! now its one of the most beautiful areas in the country"
285,Cruising on the Norfolk Broads,"Rented our boat from Bridgecraft - really nice little boat yard, friendly staff, and boat, while not the most luxurious of the fleet, was perfect for us.  Beautiful scenery, amazing sunsets, and a different local every night.  If you feel the need for a busy but utterly chilled week, can't recommend it enough."
286,My home county.,"We hired ""Forth Bridge 2"" from Bridgecraft at Acle in July 2018. Our experience was excellent.The welcome from the staff was lovely. Good safety briefing and some useful local knowledge to help us enjoy our holiday.We called back at the boatyard mid-week to take on water and to get a ""pump-out."" This was carried out quickly and efficiently by the staff and we were on our way again.The boat was well-maintained and very comfortable. We intend to return."
287,So peaceful,"Hired a cruiser from Richardsons Boatyard in Stalham and headed for Great Yarmouth. As we werent in a rush we took 2 lazy days to get there. Once there, we stayed 2 nights and then an even lazier 3 day trip back. We found that morning cruising and mid afternoon mooring, meant no panic stations looking for overnight mooring before dark. Plenty of afternoon walking and al fresco evenings chillin' on deck. Mooring at South Walsham and Instead meant an hour walk to the pub for dinner and a pint (or 4) and an hour back. Also mooring here is free, although there are no facilities to take on water or pump out!! Be aware that the shopp in South Walsham has now closed for good so the arrow pointing to it is out of date.Both ourselves and our daughter, son in law and 4 year old grandson had a fantastic week just relaxing in the quiet surroundings and would recommend this type of hoiliday to be tried at least once.Get your cruiser from Richardsons at Stalham. Staff and facilities are second to none. Polite friendly and helpful and really get your holiday off to a good start."
288,amazing place to be................,"Picked up the San Fernando from Richardson's of Stalham for a one week cruise of the Broads. Staff at Richardson's superb with plenty of tips and advice as well as giving us novices a 20min tour of the boat and 'road test' under an expert's watchful eye then the boat was all ours. Mooring where we wanted wasn't always possible unless you arrive early: private moorings tend to charge £5/night. Other boat owners really helpful and lots of advise, especially when mooring in a tight space or picking our 'next port of call'. Tied up at Wroxham and took the train into Norwich (approx 20mins). Open top tour was superb and very informative. Nice market with many different take-aways to tempt you at lunchtime. Nice walk back to the train station and back to the boat. Travelled on to Stokesby and took a taxi into Great Yarmouth (19mins and £18) instead of spending 3hrs to sail in and having issues with tides and mooring: another great day. Pottered back (usual Broads speed limit is 4mph) to Stalham via various stops , ending with a lovely Indian meal in the town. All in all, a superb week with everyone really enjoying themselves. Would do it again!"
289,Boating on the broads,"We took a narrow gauge steam train to Wroxham from Aylesham, which was a 10 minute walk away from the boat. We then spent two hours going up an down the broads. It would have perhaps been better to have hired our own boat for a longer period, but it was a good taster and left us wanting more. Beautiful scenery and well worth doing."
290,Brilliant broads,"Love Norfolk, love the Broads, on my 25th Norfolk holiday, will definitely be coming again. Come rain or shine the place is wonderful."
291,Another fabulous holiday,"Not the same as 20years ago, no Norfolk accent. Boring, not suitable for children, limited food on board, not worth expensive of ticket and parking."
292,"No Mooring, Private Mooring","Four of us adults rented Magic Gem 4 from Richardsons for a week,frankly because it was cheap.Myself and my companion ended up in the aft ""en suite cabin"".Access to the bed was a space18"" wide squeezed alongside the shower and toilet,and for a week proved virtually impossible to get in and out of.To call it en suite,stretches credulity to the limit.Within the shower/toilet compartment was just room for a small toilet,ideal for kids up to - say 8 years old - who would have been happy using it.As a shower it was never used and was useless.The ""space"" running along the entire length of the kitchen was nowhere wider than 20"" so only one person could move along the gap without displacing another person.This rendered all movement fore and aft impossible.The WiFi which we never managed to connect satisfactorily to managed to drain to zero three of our mobile phone,s batteries.There was no water meter telling you how much water there was in the tank,no fuel gauge,no reverse parking sensors,the boat having been called a danger to life by a boatman in Wroxham who helped us moor.I know these things are not normally on a boat of this age,but WHY NOT ? If Richardsons spent some modest sums of money upgrading these boats instead of bleeding the profit dry from the punters I wouldn't complain but they don't. Having not had a shower for 4 days,upon our return I went to the shower block for...wait for it... a shower.I needed a token it said,(!!!!) so off I went to reception to get one,who promptly told me that trying to have one was a waste of time as there was no water pressure.I give up."
293,Beautiful lakes and waterways,"The area is a bit blend (in terms of low population density and being mainly flat) but at the same time its different to many other parts of the UK. The landscape is quite similar to that of Netherlands with rivers, canals, boats and Windmills.We didnt do the ship tour because the timings didn't fit well and it was a bit too expensive (for what it is) but then most things in the UK are going in that direction. Note: there are cheaper and smaller boat tours available if you search a bit beyond the big companies on the broad. All in all worth a visit if you are in the area."
294,Romany 1 - Romany 2 - Moorhen Boats. Barnes Brinkcraft,The third time we've used Richardsons and wasn't disappointed either these guys do a great job of seeing you get the best out of you holiday. Little disappointing they shut there boatyard at acle as it was a great halfway point for water or free pump out. Fishing was excellent we'd been lucky weather wise past twice this year was a little bit wet at times but these boats have superb heaters.
295,shocking boat richardsons,"We set out from Horning travelling along the River Bure towards Wroxham at a steady 4mph on a beautiful Autumn morning, sunny,  warm and virtually no wind. There were Marsh Harriers circling above seeking a thermal to let them get away to hunt. First diversion was into Hoveton Little Broad - quiet and idyllic, grebes diving, here and there ducks. Back onto the river past a beautiful wooden yacht using a motor to get along. Overhead a large Heron flew slowly past looking for a place to land and fish. A quick turn into Decoy broad then back on to the Bure, a flotilla of Swans with a couple of cygnets were heading in our direction - graceful and apparent ease of movement. Next stop was Hoveton Great Broad, we moored up with a mud anchor for lunch - there again was plenty of water fowl around plus overhead a Marsh Harriet clubbing and as quickly as seen it disappeared into the heavens. We went onto Salhouse Broad then to Wroxham Broad. Enroute there were several day hire boats from wroxham heading along the Bure for a few hours exploration of the Broads. Outside the Hotel Wroxham there were over a dozen graceful swans swimming along,2 large tour boats full of visitors edged out into the river, whilst two canoes headed under the bridge making for Belaugh and Coktishall. Soon it was time to turn round and head back to our mooring at Horning. A beautful day and we had only explored a small section of the wonderful Broads National Park."
296,the broads,"Overall, Richardsons have the family-run feel that they are so famous for.That being said, Me and the other half hired Magic Gem 5 last and what a shock!The steering was awful, you had to have Superman muscles to keep the damn thing straight. The throttle lever was very stiff and we also had a recurring issue with the bank of 3 leisure batteries on this boat. They were eventually replaced with brand new batteries, but we did lose a full day of travel as a result. When I called to ask if we could extend by a day, we were advised that technical issues are no reason to ask for an extension, even though this was the responsibility of the boating center to check prior to hiring.I would book again, but I would most definitely book a slightly more expensive boat, as to guarantee the quality of the boat, as our itinerary is quite tightly packed in.Overall 4 stars as the service on arrival and return is beyond exemplary. Also helps that they ask for a fuel deposit upfront when booking and if you don't use the full amount of fuel in the deposit, they refund the difference in cash there and then, which helps with the cost of petrol getting back home after the holiday.About to book a week holiday after being in hospital for a month, so hopefully should be a great way to rest, recuperate and relax."
297,Paradise on water,"The Broads are a series of rivers and man-made lakes in eastern Norfolk and northern Suffolk.  These waterways were formed when the peat cuttings (the natural material being used for fuel in Medieval Norwich) flooded over time.  They cover an area is 303 square kilometres, and have over 200 kilometres of navigable waterway.This area is amazing, and the calm of it all with waterfowl, slow moving boats, and mile after mile of reed beds, clean water, and thatched waterside houses is really something to see.We have visited on bout tours, and as car tourists taking in the area from various surrounding villages.  Many people also hire boats to make the exploring their own."
298,Day boat hire Norfolk boat hire,"Firstly, Richardson's was an excellent company. Friendly and helpful, particularly in reception (sorry no names) and Chris who did our intro and trial run.Our week long holiday was enjoyable and good fun. Our boat - Broadland Saturn- was, however, disappointing. Although rightly advertised as small (very compact), it was shabby, somewhat dirty and with several unexpected faults. The water pump was very noisy. The water tank makes 'gluppy' sounds at night when the pump is turned off. The fresh water tap leaks badly and makes all surface around the hob very wet. The shower is absolute rubbish, meaning you have to pay for showering in boatyard (if a mooring is available).Whilst I would recommend Richardson's, I would strongly advise not to book the Broadland Saturn."
299,My favourite location in the UK,"Boats are very dated and not very clean,  handover was spoilt by the fact that diesel tank had not been filled. Overall we enjoyed the experience of the holiday . But the interior of the boat was let down by the fact it's very old and tired. Windows didn't shut properly and we had weeds and moss growing out of the side of the boat.  We are currently in dispute with hoseasons who are not prepared to listen or acknowledge our concerns.. Will never use them again and never recommend them to anyone else. Feel thoroughly let down by this company."
