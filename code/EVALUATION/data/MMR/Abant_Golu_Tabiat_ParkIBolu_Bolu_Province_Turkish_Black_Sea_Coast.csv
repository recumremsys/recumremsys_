0,Magnificent lake with beautiful landscape,Magnificent lake with a beautiful landscape. The walking trail around the lake takes about 2 hours (7 km) of a nice walk with three or four restaurants and cafes. You can take a horse ride around the lake.
1,Splendid lake,Lake Abant is a very beautiful lake located in the forests.  Its perimeter is around 7 km. Highly recommended especially in spring and autumn. It would be good to have less people around to enjoy the tranquility. Best time for visit is weekdays.
2,worth every moment,"This is a beautiful unspoilt lake set amongst mountains covered in forest. There is both a road and walking path around the lake. You can walk, drive, take a horse drawn carriage or ride a horse around the lake(5km). There are 2 five-star hotels at the lake and one restaurant which makes a lovely lunch stop after the walk or you can have a picnic at one of the numerous picnic spots, some with barbecues already set up. 18km from the lake is the beautiful, traditional little town of Mudurnu, set in a narrow valley between two high hills. Accomodation at Mudurnu is much more affordable than at the lake and there are taxis that will take you to the lake if you don't have a car."
3,Very beautiful place,"One of the best recreational lakes about 2.5 hours from Ankara. Fall is the best season to visit this natural site. I am currently (October/November) vacationing in Ankara and was just recently able to do an excursion to the location. I highly recommend a day trip and enjoy a lakeside coffee and/or lunch break, as well as a long walk around the lake, if you can walk that far. I had my cup of tea and was able to walk just a fraction of the distance, much to my taste, still enjoying the tapestry of colors and people from Turkey and abroad."
4,Nothing so special,The Lake is huge and in the middle of the mountain. Very beautiful scenery and have many picnic areas and many cafes and restaurants. I think it has some motels but not sure.
5,Piece of Peace on Earth,Its just for relaxation in front of this amazing Lake. you can ride a bicycle or a cabriolet for a tour around the lake. The weather is amazing its little bit cold. I went in MAY and the weather were amazing you don't need heavy clothes you need only Spring clothes. The only thing that I didn't like is the way to ABANT. its so far from Istanbul and Bursa and the there is no airport there or in Bolu but believe me it deserve to visit.
6,Beautiful,"This a a haven for nature lovers like myself. The lake is set amidst scenic surroundings and the road around the lake and other walkways built by the lake authorities are truly beautiful.The hotels inside the Lake boundaries are expensive. Spend a night at the many 'Pensions' (home stays) situated just outside the park boundaries. We stayed at Abant Pasa Pansiyon, which had a stream flowing in it backyard and out hosts were one of the most hospitable people that we have met in our lives. Walk around the lake and spend some time there to tune your senses to the sights and sounds of Mother Nature."
7,Always nice but it is something in winter,"You can reach this place easily by map directions using car , It is a Natural beautiful lake with clean water and fresh air, you can walk beside it or rent a bike or have a barbecue in specific places prepared for this purpose.At the mid of August the temperature at nearby city is 30 while at the lake it was 20 only , very nice whether in summer.The wood surrounding it with very nice trees and grass , each car must pay 15T.L for entrance (less than 3$).Restaurants there are expensive and don’t worth to try , individual barbecue is an excellent choice .The road is about 37km from Bolu city , nice and attractive road . Many farmers at the way offering fresh fruits and fish, they may also grilled it for you directly, residents are on the way to lake with suitable price (150-200T.L per room per night ) while near the lake it is very expensive (reaches 3000T.L) ."
8,Snow in Abant Lake,"The lake is beautiful and well preserved. Yet, in weekends too much traffic around the lake. You may spend a romantic and quiet weekend there."
9,A Beautiful National Park in Bolu,The lake is situated in park that you pay for entrance. Has all the facilities of comfort. Public toilets and benches.Greater view amd whether.There are a couple of hotels if wish.Must visit if you are in the area.Along the way from Bolu to the lake there are lots of great restaurants and locals selling their own home grown goodies.
10,Abant of Fall Season,"This is a lovely lake in Turkey surrounded by pine forests and steep hills. Its very popular with tourists, especially domestic tourists, as it often snows here in winter. The lake itself is pretty with picnic areas and grassy spots surrounding it. There are several hotels within the park which are quite expensive. You can stay outside of the park for much less, a great option being Abant Gokdere Kartal Yuvasi Hotel."
11,Abant Lake,"The place is stunning, the road to the lake is well maintained, good place to spend a day out, bbq places are available, there are many local restaurants on the road, some view activites like ride a hourse or a hourse  carrige to show around the lake. Such a nice spot to relax and meditation!  Come early to find you best spot to set. Bring some warm cloth, even in summer the rain or cold breeze nay surprise you. The restaurants on the lake has nice view. , bit pricy but some of the staff speak English and accept credit cards for payments."
12,Pretty lake,it is a nice place for a day trip from ankara or nearby cities. the lake is soothing and you can barbecu there as well.
13,Turkey,"We stop by this nature park along our way to Bolu town.Lake is located high above a mountain and the weather is very cold, but very refreshing.It is a good park for family outing and many facilities are provided.The scenery is fantastic, calming and surrounded by lush greenery. We took a horse carriage ride around the lake and visit a small museum which showcase all animals that can be found in this park.Many vendors selling dried fruits,spices sweets and other local products.It is a wonderful place to spent time with one family."
14,Virgin Nature ,This is a big and nice lake and around the lake there is about only 4 hotels and near the lake there is a train that take a tour around all the lake and many husbands and wifes before or after there wedding they go and walk there and take pirctures its amazing and exciting
15,Little piece of paradise,This lake is one of best in Turkey. You can spend a calm and peaceful time with your family and children can play around while you are preparing the barbecue party. You can also see the cows and horses passing nearby.
16,Absolutely beautiful ,"We chose to walk around the lake (it seems to be about 6 kilometers) on a crisp bright day with no snow. A bit muddy in places but the path is well maintained. There is a road for cars to circumnavigate the lake which often runs beside the pedestrian path - a bit of a downer on crowded days. That said, a good way to enjoy winter sunshine with lovely vistas."
17,Nature Trip to Golu...,"Abant is a pretty lake surronded by lush hills/mountains. The views are very nice, and the place is not covered in plastic garbage as many other places in Turkey. If you're looking for the wilderness, however, this might not be the place. Abant is a fairly small lake, but it still has several hotels and restaurants along the way. Cars are allowed to drive around the lake, which makes it more accessible, but also takes away quite alot of the serenity. It could also get quite busy during the weekends. This is a very nice place for a weekend getaway from Istanbul and Ankara, but keep your expectations realistic."
18,Not To Be Missed,Excelent place for picnik or two hours round the lake trip.It is must to stop for a tea on your way to the lake. For the long hike expirience you got long trails in the National Park.Highly recomended to visit in Mudurnu.
19,Amazing lake on the mountain,"The lake is beautiful, but needs a lot of restoration and clean up work, to ensure continuity and attraction of people, animals , and birds."
20,Not for the people like calmness and silence.,One day trip to the lake. Weather was not perfect but we enjoyed the trip. Lake is beautiful and has several BB areas and facilities.  During the summer time the color of the water is much better and there are water lilies
21,5 stars facility with amazing views,"Peaceful lake, you remember the God , the creator when you see it.Big with huge space for picnic, horse riding, cycling, walking."
22,Koray,"Its a very relaxing place on the shoulders of mountains, greenery and lake views are just amazing. You can have your own barbecue near the lake, get tour around it on horses and enjoy the nature in it's best way."
23,Nature at its BEST,Excellent place to visit. So beautiful and  natural view. There are few good hotels ( 5 Star ) and boutiques hotels. As well as camping area for campers. Good food.
24,Serdar,"The nature is excellent at the Abant Lake. A small lake in the middle of forests.Air quality is perfect. On the other hand, traditional pedestrian pathways around the lake need serious reconstruction/improvement. It is really a shame that an important part of the lake is covered by reeds and seemingly the Ministry of Forestry does not care to clean the lake.Likewise permission by Authorities to ugly housing developments even at some remote parts around the lake is another shame."
25,Spectacular view,A lake from dreams in the middle of forest. Amazing views. Has a few good hotels around. Cold weather in the hottest days of summer.
26,Good for a walk through crowded on Sunday,"It’s quite a joy for nature lovers to be able to enjoy such large lake. What define Abant are the services & facilities all around. When you reach the lake edge by car you can BBQ, enjoy a horse ride (10 minutes for 10 TL) or even breathe clean air. We know it was hot that day but everybody else in the northern hemisphere was complaining about a heat wave. We spent 2 hours before the sunset staring at the serenity nature provides. As a photographer; I advise everybody to visit right after sunrise or before sunset.If you got only one chance to visit a lake in Bolu go to Golcuk. Abant is about 25Km from Bolu center while Golcuk is just outside the city center. Both lakes have about 8 KM well maintained roads. On your way back you can stop by the road side villagers selling some of their produce of Honey & Jam. Some also sell village butter, eggs & bread. You are taking your chances with these sellers because of the nature of their goods. Pass by several before buying & you will be able to tell what’s what."
27,Beautiful,"One of the most amazing place in Turkey. You can enjoy the lake or mountains around it which is full of green trees. All services available. You can find restaurants, hotel and shops."
28,Relax and walk a bit,"Very beautiful and fascinating scene over there 😍 it’s good for people who love to enjoy nature .However, it gets a little cold at night.. so take care. Enjoy 😉"
29,Pretty lake,"Perfectly situated between Istanbul and Ankara this is a perfect retreat to enjoy natural environments. Located in a reserved forest, the lake is circled with many picnic areas, walk/bicycle paths, hotels, restaurants and horse rides. Great for families and this on a budget as well, for either a day trip or overnight."
30,Enjoy some quiet time ,"Bolu lake or Abant bolu is very beautiful lake that I have ever seen. Tourist can spend with view of the lake and the natural beauty of its surroundings, which are covered with dense forests, and easy access by car"
31,Green and relaxing,It is one of the most beautiful forest sightseeing places in the world.. I wish they could not build hotels and houses around.. Just walk and breathe the forest air..
32,Allah Akbar,Abant lake is a small lake surrounded by a forest between tall mountains. The air is fresh and the forest is thick. There are a few very close hotels nearby but they suit the enviroment. Also a camp site where you can spend the night.You can rent bicycles or walk around the lake since its around 8 kms. You can rest or make a picnic near the lake too. Also make sure to take some pictures on autumn when you can find all the colours on trees.P.s. No swimming allowed :)
33,Walk Along The Lakeside,A stunning place to visit. We enjoyed a horse drawn carriage ride around the lake which was a very fun and a unique experience! Picnic sitting areas are available. A gorgeous natural place to relax surrounded by the backdrop of mountains and trees.
34,Great destination,Abant lake is different from sapanca lake as it look more nature friendly such as no restaurant just nature you can bring barbecue or your food and enjoy walking trail along the lake you can rent a bike for 15tr an hour or ride a horse with 20tr long circle or a horse carriage for families entrance to the lake park is 25 for a car
35,"Nice, clean, green","It has a beautiful landscape, fresh air and parks. It is near the city centre. You can eat in there traditional foods. It is suitable for family members"
36,Beautiful Nature,The Lake's altitude is about 1300 m which cases it to freeze at winter. Some people step on it but it's generally forbidden to step on it. you can find some hotels that have a beautiful view of the lake but these hotels are more expensive compared to the other ones on the way
37,MUST SEE,"Nice atmosphere, frozen lake, walking or taking horse pulling car amazing. The food in Abant hotel with lake view is perfect"
38,nice place for a day trip,"Excellent hotels around the lake, food was good, declaring the lake as natural park did not do much good as it atracted rural crowds  who have nothing better than going around the lake and polluting the air. An excellent escape from the wet and hot summer days of the cities. Cool breeze lots of trees and oxygen and all that. But suferers of high blood pressure should take caution as the altitude of 1300 meters tend to give diturbances."
39,Wonderful place!!,"This is the nicest place in the area , a very nice Lake surrounded by tall tress  .Very clean air , a view tables and rest area .A very good restaurant with tasty food and a Great Lake view ."
40,Lovely lake - great place to see autumn colors,"The Lake Abant with its scenic view is located in between Bolu and Ankara Highway. It is not a big lake that you can make an easy walk around it for about an hour (app 8-9km). It is in the middle of nice forest area of pine trees. It is a national park and have a small visitors shop to explain the area. There are a few 5 star hotels around the lake in case you wish to spend some days -especially a weekend-. In both summer and winter seasons, it is worth to visit. However, the summer season is the busiest time. If you wish to make a trekking in the forest area, you might be the beneficiary of wild life. In my last trekking, I saw some footprints of bears;-) In addition to its natural beauties of the lake, you can have a chance to buy some authentic food at the bazaar nearby the lake (honey, homemade pasta, traditional soup powder/tarhana, etc.)"
41,A paradise if the altitude dors not hurt you,It is very popular in weekends. If you would like go prefer week days. It has lots of clean and wide green areas for picnic. You can park your car side of the road. There are lots of good and nice hotels for accommodation.
42,Good for families,Excellent scenery. Nice walks around the lake. Not much else to do though! Nearby town of Mudurnu is well worth a visit.
43,Very nice indeed,"Although it is not a big one, it is very suitable for people who look for relaxation in a quiet environment. Nice restaurants are overlooking the lake which adds more taste to the meals."
44,lake needs restoration,"A very nice and big nature park. There are plenty of nice cafes and places to have some really nice kebab (I was craving some kuzu şiş that day and left very pleased). Beware though, they can be kind of pricy (especially by Turkish standards).There are a lot of picnic areas if you want to cook your own meat. You can also go horseback riding in the open fields (though I did not try these myself). There is a nice farmer's market and also a little cottage that sells more officially packaged food. I bought some great cheese here!A nice choice if you want to take a walk (or bike) around the lake or drink some tea while looking at some nice scenery."
45,Beautiful natural spot,"It was a good sunny day and everywhere was surrounded by green and blue view...There were couple of rides available like cycling,horse riding etc,cycling was great fun .The sound of birds ,the sound of water and winds made the environment so soothing.Spent almost 3 hours peacefully in this place."
46,Wonderful,We visited the lake and its hills on winter when it was frozen. It was great as we could rent bobsled and even horses. Some great local food around too.
47,Great also in Winter,"We enjoyed a walk all together (humans + dog)  around the lake - green, peaceful and clean air.Beware of the people doing barbecues when the weather is better though!"
48,Spectacularly beautiful,After you park your car at the designated area and start walking around the lake you wish you had your professional camera with you. The view is spectacular. If you like hiking or walking this isn’t the place to miss. When you look around you see scenes from postcards or movies and you feel like you’re in one of them. There is a local market. You can stop by at one of the hotels for a hot chocolate or coffee to warm up. We plan to come here doing spring or fall again.
49,Abant lake Trip ,"When you go to Ankara from Istanbul, you can stop and stay one night in Abant. There is a very nice lake surrounded by forest. You will feel and live in nature. I strongly recommend a full lake tour with phaeton."
50,Nice for a little walk,We loved it so much that we visited it twice the seanry is lovely even wondering around the lake is even better.
51,Perfect weekend retreat,"The hotel’s location is excellent, where as the service is more than satisfiying with lots of amenities to use and enjoy, food was great and plenty.The only disadvantage is for the triple room they use an extra bed, therefore the room will get too crowded and very tight !"
52,It's one of the best,"Highly recommended for those seeking peace and harmony. 2-3 days at this place will clear your mind and energize your soul for city life. Nature, amazing views, clean, fresh air is all you need to cheer up."
53,Peaceful lakeside,Winter brings the cold but you better get dressed well and have your camera in your hand to go for walk and also have room in your tummy to enjoy delicious food in the restaurants by the lakeWinter is a different season for lake AbantYou need to go there in winter if your are interested in photography
54,Most wonderful place i had ever seen ,We stayed at Buyuk Abant Hotel which is located by the lake and have enjoyed our time there. The best time to visit the lake is in summer when the weather is mild.
55,Unique natural beauty,The lake was frozen when I went there and it was amazing with the snow around the lake although we were cold as hell! 😁 You can walk around the lake and enjoy the view if you’re a nature lover. You could also do horse riding back then but I am not sure if they still offer this activity. There is a hotel by the lake if you want to be accommodated nearby. Definitely worth a visit.
56,magic!!!,"there are few resturants on the lake side , find a table ,, ask for a cup of hot drink , relax , relax , relax , and listen to the sound of nature ."
57,One day Trip,"Lake Abant,which is located in Bolu,a city in the northern Turkey,is a very good attraction for nature lovers to see in every season.If you come to Turkey,remember visiting this place,walking or cycling by the lake and buying the natural products that the villagers produce and sell.You can also take a coach or ride a horse on demand.There are two hotels by the lake.If you want a cheaper accomodation option,you can consider staying in one in the centre of Bolu or districts nearby.There are frequent shuttles.I like Abant because it's close to Istanbul where I'm living and I also feel great because of being away from the city life but totally becoming whole with nature.All in all, I guess you won't regret your trip there."
58,Narnia of Turkey,"wonderful view and naturemust see the placein the middle of Ankara and Istanbulgreat viewgreat time in the middle of nature , forests surrounding and the lake of course is nice"
59,Amazing Place,I am a private team leader I find the place one of the best I take group of visitor from Kuwait and Saudia they love the place .  Khaled Almahini +96599619998
60,Pleasure,It's below zero degree and this lake is covered with snow. There were not many people here during our tour group visit in the late afternoon. We enjoyed walking round this peaceful place and took many scenic photographs.
61,A place to relax,We have been there with our friend's family. Great place for kids also. Rent a bike or ride a horse around the lake to see the beauty of mother nature. This place is also great in winter times under snow. There are good hotels to stay in. You  can see every color in autumn during leaf fall.
62,Natural escape,"just amazing, great for photo shooting, excellent for families or friends, can spend hours there. but we did not try the cafe"
63,Lake abant is...,Was the most popular and visited places in the country. Now it turned out that Arabic people and migrants now fulled the place. Not attractive for the travellers who have forestry in own-land but for Treeless country travellers.
64,Very relaxing wonderful nature ,"We went in early October and it was beautiful weather and also all the colors were showing. There are plenty of things to do around the lake,  horse riding , horse carriage rides , bike rentals and many beautiful picnic spots around the lakes. The kids had a good time collecting leaves and looking at many beautiful wild flowers along the lake. Would recommend a relaxing weekend stay. We stayed at the hotel Abant palace which was right opposite to the lake, the rooms are clean but basic and much expensive than what it would cost in other parts of the world. But the location is unbeatable."
65,Lake Abant ,"I know that Abant was very beatiful Naturel park at all to spend a time at region or hotels located around the lake.  Last visite of park hotel was 2006 and 2008 and i enjoyed to walk around the lake in wild nature at snow time no car, no loud and dirt or human garbage. It is suprized to me to see road around lake and so many people driving car around the lake no walking area left behinde and crowd trying to make barbeque at picnic area, no snow and so many garbage at west area.  Abant ocuupancy by people crowd who doesnot love nature was terrible bad.  The place is lost to uggly creatures. :( I am sorry for next generation."
66,Well maintained lake,Visited after 20 years. Dissapointed. Nothing is like in my memory. Golcuk Lake was much more better and natural even its artificial. Full of arabic tourists may explain why prices are so high.
67,Lake with Wonderful Nature,Magic place!!!.....best season there for me is winter..lake and whole area covered with snow ...like a fairytale!!! never saw in my life so much beauty in a place!!!
68,Haven for Nature Lovers,Lake Abant is pretty and there are a few restaurants to eat at but nothing that is overwhelming about this place. An hours walk around the lake or perhaps a carriage ride and one may move on unless you want a quiet couple of days doing nothing. You are required to pay 12 lire to enter the park.
69,Lovely natural lake and environment,Make sure to hike in the forest and discover the nearby highlands. Look for the watch point sign that will take you to a beautiful highland place.
70,Exciting lake,"If you want to relax and meditate , this place is perfect to find peace , and nourish your energy , i spent 2 days in Taksim International Hotel ( Abant Palace ) , walking around the lake , eating perfect breakfast with best service ( One of them is Celal Mutluay  ) , riding horses , and eating best Namnam in upper of  hills , and best Abant Kabab in Abant Gol Restaurant , The hotel without air condition , if you feel hot open windows and breath fresh air , the only problem with dogs in area , they were barking all the night . I found best destination to relax , specially in the morning when you can walk and ride horse , i rode ıngıe horse and Mr Omar Faroq take us to wonderful places where the wild horses eats the grass , Really I Love Everything in this place ."
71,Just an ordinary lake,"our trip to Abant from Istanbul took around 3hrs.. when we got there.. we were amazed by the beautiful forests, the cleanliness, the crystal clear lake and the weather. u can take a tour around the like via a car, a carriage or by riding a horse.. and riding a horse i did.. went rushing through the forests.. i was joyed.. took a walk with my family around the lake and through the forest.. for lunch.. we stopped by ""albalik et mangal"" in Abant Park.. the view is amazing.. u can seat right next to the river amidst the forest.. the food was super amazing and in good portions.. the vegs were so fresh they never went to the supermarket.. same goes to the yogurt.. bread.. and meat.. the water they served was fresh from the river.. and for dessert i had a konafa.. which was very delicious.. the price tag? cheapest so far during my stay in turkey.. payed 163 turkish liras for 7 people.. very cheap.. forgot to mention.. the resteraunt is being run by a family.."
72,Beautiful Lake in Bolu,"I think in my opinion that lake abant needs more events and services, not just horse riding and photography.The lake is too big and needs  public bathrooms and more  seats places , and the restrant are expensive although the food is fantastic.I would recommend this lake but don't expect too match from it."
73,Amazing Natural Park,"My fiancé, mother in law and I went there last weekend, we took a day tour from Istanbul to Lake Abant, it took us about 2 hrs to arrive, I was so excited to see this place and of course it was perfect!!!  The place was all snowy, the lake was frozen!! We took a 2 and a half hour walk all around the lake which is about 7-8 km walk, it definitely worth it! We had such an amazing views from every since angle, everything was like a little piece taken from heaven, while u are walking u can see people around using their grills and cooking something and having hot drinks to warm up, it was very cold but with the walk everything was fine, just make sure to use gloves, scarf, big puffy jackets, water proof shoes/boots/sneakers to keep yourself warm enough.As well, you can practice some ski in this area.I cannot wait longer for summer to go back to this area and see its beauty in a different shape.This place is very photographed in many websites of Turkey, so in every season you can enjoy this stunning place and relax yourself surrounded only by nature."
74,Amazing!,"Simply beautiful... we will definitely be coming back here with our son. We spent 2 afternoons here and had plenty of activities and sightseeings to do with not enough time unfortunately. There is everything you need inside, starting from restaurants to Wc, drinking water fountains, a shop, horses and bicycle rentals which i strongly advise!  The place is well maintained and clean. we paid 15 TL at the entrance, some of the reviews complained about the entrance fee, i say to them that this is a huge place that overflows with visitors year round, it requires cleaning and maintenance, hence the entrance fee which in my opinion is very cheap. ( thats 15 TL per car by the way!)"
75,Relaxation in one of the most beautiful places in the world,Loved the horse ride around the lake (although the horses smelt baaaaaaaad!) There was plenty to do around the lake including tobogganing! There are two lovely hotels on the lakeside.
76,Great for a day trip,"This place was suggested to me by my travel agent and he booked a 4 night stay!!! I am not at all happy with this place, there are too many dogs outside so you cannot even go out gor a walk at night. The entire place smells like of horses dunk. Nothing much to do here, if you are in turkey for quite a lot of number of days tgen just come here for a day tour or maximum for one night!!!just a waste of money, no restaurants to eat out at, i am eating at my hotels restsurant!!And you can easily get a bus (prefereably metro)from istanbul to bolu, and then from bolu to abant a taxi would cost 70 Tl.In short i wouldnt really suggest anyone to come here and waste their time by staying inside the hotel, go to a place where there are activities!!!"
77,Wonderful place,"In simple words ... I love this place! Whilst it tends to get very busy at weekends, with families spilling over themselves in the various well-equipped picnic areas around the lake, I prefer to go on the quieter weekdays when it's more peaceful and tranquil.The lake and its surrounds are beautifully unspoilt; it's a great opportunity to walk and blow off the cobwebs whist enjoying the scenery and nature; there are areas to play and to explore; or take a ride in a horse-drawn carriage, ride on a rental-bicycle, eat at one of the waterside cafes and restaurants, or head directly to the selection of local craft and souvenir shops. There's endless possibilities to enjoy a magical day out in nature, and I shall return again and again."
78,wonderful view and nature,"Liked : All areas are very clean, preserved, natural and kept well. Disliked : Dogs should be taken under control. Horse droppings smells worse."
79,breath taking,"We went to visit Lake Abant for a few hours on a somewhat cloudy day in June. We drove up from Bolu along a nicely-kept road and were pleased to find that everything was well-signed. The entrance fee for our automobile was 12 TL (about $4.50 USD). We got there fairly early so the place was rather empty. It was gorgeous with trees rich in color and lovely sunshine. There is a road that circles the lake, though we were only able to travel a little over half-way around, as the park services were doing some repairs and had closed it off. On the way back we stopped in a very nice park where our kids could play. The one downside was that people from the local village graze their cattle at near the lake and had them pass through the park, leaving cow paddies around, which made it important to be careful where you stepped. The little pavilions and picnic tables were in nice repair and the restroom facilities, though a little old, were very clean.At the entrance to the park horse-carriage rides were offered for 60 TL (approximately $23 USD). The rides normally went all the way around the lake, but due to the road closure went about half-way out and then back. There is also horse-back riding available for 20 TL (approximately $7.50 USD), where they lead you around a little loop. It's very nice for children.All-in-all we enjoyed ourselves, though it did turn quite chilly when the sun went behind the clouds. It is a nice, quiet place to go and relax and fun for having a picnic dinner. There are also several hotels or lodges around for those who wish to stay the night, though the only thing I can say about them is that they looked very posh."
80,Fantastic views,"If you are tired of the big city, an escape to Abant will be life saving, reminding you to breathe again."
81,Gomu Tour is First Class,On our way to Göreme we stopped at Abant lake to take a little travel break. What a great idea it was! You can take a nice walk by the lakeside and enjoy a tea or coffee in one of the restaurants there. It is not very touristy which I really enjoyed. Lots of locals come here to spend the day by the lake and enjoy a picnic with their family. It is a very quiet and relaxing place and very well worth a visit.
82,Trekking in the nature,"It was January, which was winter in Turkey. Cold! Cold morning!The road leading to Lake Abant was covered with white snow. Beautiful calm lake surrounded by mountains. There's little people wandering around. Really quiet and peaceful on this little countryside town of Bolu.Seen some children playing with snow. All the beauty of this Lake Abant absorbed into my eyes so quickly. Spectacular!Enjoyed. Should visit if happened to stopover Bolu."
83,Shame about the litter,"I went to this lake a couple of times with my girl friend. It was in September and January. Both months the lake was so nice. We walked all around the lake, it lasted about an hour. The lake was completely frozen in winter, people were having fun on the frozen lake and the stray dogs were running on it."
84,magical for loving couples .,"Abant Lake was just great.Searching a place for a photo for instagram? That’s the right place.Also there is a  bike rental really near to the lake. You can ride a bike near the lake ,it’d be fun. Also even if we went there in October ‘18 the weather was great! Hope you like the place! ;)"
85,Nature and Peace-It's Abant,"Actually,beautiful,but unfortuately people are leaving their picic rubbish behind ad its a real shame."
86,Christmas card scene,"First of all, i'd like to said Gomu Tur and their staff was very versed and they do their job perfectly. Abant Lake and the other lakes near of this lake was very impressive but note that ambagious. You dont forget to take your camera. Foods are also delicious and impressive. We enjoyed so much."
87,Nice Place to Relax,"Snowy everywhere, just like the movie Narnia! Sorel snow boots from Amazon.com helped me a lot . The paths were slippery so be careful. I met some street dogs but I'm in love with them, they were right outside a restaurant. They accepted me as a friend, we played fetch game... I miss them. I just hope to go there some time to see them plus enjoy my beautiful Narnia."
