22,Amazing,"We spent entire day at South Beach. It has clean blue water and white sand. It has a very vibrant vibe. Ocean drive is right across with many options for food available! It is family friendly, however it is not a relaxing beach, a lot of tourist stay at south beach which makes it crowded."

34,Espanola way ,"South Beach itself was awesome, the beach and water were wonderful. BUT there are so many people on the beach, it is hard to feel comfortable. Then there is always a chance you will get kicked out of your spot by groups that sell cabanas, umbrellas, and chairs for the day... ugh."
35,Huge beach,"South Beach is just a fun place to be at. There is so much to do there, the beach itself is amazing, the water is warm and the atmosphere is fantastic.Whether you go as a family, a couple, a group of friends or like I did and went alone, you can have a great time here.If you come to Miami then this place is a must."
36,Iconic Beach is better than expected ,"you can do so much there, so many nice bars and restaurant, BUT it is clearly overpriced. the beach CAN BE beautiful, unfortunately when i was there in summer 2019 there was a lot of dirt and allgeys.. anyway it is alwaysa great experience !"

45,The beauty of South Beach,"Loved the beach - there is free suncream available, there is no where around really to buy food and drink so I would recommend packing a cool bag"
46,Favorite Beach in the US!,This is a long white sand beach. Clean and just steps from downtown South Beach. You can walk for hours if you go both ways. We did not swim but people were doing so. Lots of chairs and cabanas available to rent.
47,Nice but busy beach,Wow! Amazing ambiance and marvelous Colombian food.  5-Star service!  We even bought a souvenir shirt from Bolivar! Thanks... We'll be back!

Lifeguards everywhere if needed. Very safe and exotic place, toilets nearby. Quite crowded in the day but that's the place. Nice to be there!"
51,Big beach,"Lots has already been said about this beach. One of the popular spots in the world known for white sand, warm waters, great beach side restaurants, beach walk way etc etc. Efforts taken to keep the place safe, secure and clean are worth appreciation. You can spend hours amidst the serenity of this beach, soaking up some sun or just watch people strolling, working out, dancing and enjoying themselves.Great getaway during chilly winters - just pack your beach wear and a pair of shades and you are all set.Advisable to not drive a car to this place because parking is painful and expensive. Uber/Lyft is the right choice."
52,Lots to see,"Long, sandy beach to see and to be seen.Plenty of bars and restaurants in Ocean Drive, friendly people.Take some time to visit the Art Deco district."
53,Stunning beach,The best part of the beach was the lifeguard stations. They were absolutely beautiful. The beach itself is similar to any other Beach. There did seem to be somewhat of a steep drop off when you got next to the shore.the walking path next to the beach was something we utlized more than actual Beach
54,Relaxing day in South Beach!,"i love ocean drive, the restaurants, people watching, and the cuban girls dancing salsas,, a must see"
55,Sunny South Beach ,South Beach was great. North Beach is also as nice. Love the color of the water. Clean Beach that was patrolled   Life guards on duty.
56,Amazing beach and nice water!,"It is amazing that with all the visitors, this beach stays so clean.  Thanks to all the guys and gals that rent the umbrellas and chairs who keep the place clean,  The water is shallow and warm most of the yeaar.  You can rent a chair and umbrella or bring your own.  There is a well-kept waliking trail aong the neach and a ccouple of kiosk's that sell cold drinks."
57,Beautiful beach,"great area to people watch there's always something going on and the sand is beautiful and white , you wont be disappointed"
58,It‚Äôs for the younger crowd,"We loved south beach and the water was clear and beautiful! There are, however, two times of day to visit for what you‚Äôre looking to get out of your trip. We arrived on Thursday night and decided to wake up early Friday and head there. There was hardly anyone there at around 9 am and we had a wonderful relaxing morning at the beach and left around 11. Saturday we woke up even earlier to watch the sunrise and there were also few people there. We left around 11 again and decided to go back later evening. At 5 pm there were a ton of people there and many smoking weed. Not judging if that‚Äôs your thing but the smell is just everywhere. So, if you‚Äôre looking to relax with few people around definitely go in the am. If you‚Äôre looking for the party vibe then go in the evening!"
59,Serene Waters,"south beach has magic. It is one of the most beautiful beaches in Miami and in our country. I have known many beaches (I like beaches in general) but it is worth visiting. also, I recommend returning as many times as possible."
60,What has happened here??,"Had a great time, the strip is awesome. Fat Tuesday is a good place to go for drinks, music & games."
61,Nice sunny beach with a big reputation,South Beach is always and interesting place to visit and people watch. I prefer to watch the sunsets on the Gulf coast though.
62,Iconic beach,"When in Miami, check out Miami Beach and see the sand and the waves.  Must do!  It was pretty windy the day we were there but it was a great visit."
63,"beautiful, relaxing",The beach is wide and clea! White fine sand! Amazing water! Lifeguards everywhere! Safe place! Lots of fun there!
64,Love it!,"Great place to walk around and see everything.  So much to do from the east, west, mid beach/bayshore and south."
65,Plenty of room for all to enjoy. ,We had a fabulous day at the beach and the people watching was equally as fun as the water sports. So many pink dogs on scooters...only in South Beach.
66,Paradise,Lot's of restaurants and bars and the atmosphere is unbelievable but eating here costs almost twice a smuch as anywhere alse.
67,"Stayed at Stanton Marriott  Hotel provided with towels and water. cabana extra charges 

The water is beautiful","Nice and clean beach generally but there is a lot of construction going on at the beach, which ruins the scenery."
68,Know that it will be Crowded!,Great spot to take pictures to eat to go shopping. The Miami Beach clock is right in front of the art deco historical museum.Hard to find parking they do have parking garages around.
69,"Wide, clean beaches","This is nice place to visit, especially for adults, more of a sun bathing beach. we did see a small shark on this visit, little cool in January"
70,Beach was long and OK at best.,"A short strip nestled between beach hotels is a lively beach with restaurants, bars, and hotels across the way. Far north are huge hotels, far south offers the same, while streets off the beach just get better and better with nightclubs, hotels, and huge entertainment. Travelers from all over the world find this place so don't go out to early because the nightlife kicks in abourt 11:30 PM and virtually never ends."
71,Loved South Beach at night,"Good time, great Miami vibe. Great 2 days with my adult girls. The boardwalk and beach were awesome. Lifeguard stands quintessential South Beach."
72,Best beach in the world ,The beach at Miami Beach. It can be crowded at times but it is big enough for everyone. If you want more space you can walk north to mid beach
73,"Iconic beach, but too commercial",Good place to explore Lots of shops and restaurants Easy access good parking option Walking distance from or to the beach Must check it out
74,Spring break 2020,"The beach is long, nice and with the scyscrapers view, really nice to explore. Yet, it is way too commercial with even service / police cars riding it ...We enjoyed most the walk on the promenade."
75,An unforgettable day,"Clean sand, blue water and a quite place to relax is all we wanted and we got it! We will go back. Thank you"
76,Winter escape ,Lots of room to spread out.  Biggest beach I've ever been to.  Life guards are patrolling the area.  Great atmosphere.  Clear water
77,Far better than expected,"South beach offers beautiful, soft, sandy beaches with a long paved beach walk parallel to the ocean for walking, running, biking and skating."
78,Use the bus to get around,The beach was located across from our hotel was very nice with a lifeguard and very wide. Our hotel provided chairs which made our beach time even better.
79,Day out,"Given its fame, it‚Äôs rather ordinary just like any other beach with sand, ocean and people. No specific character to it. If one is looking to just relax, sunbathe and swim it serves the purpose."
80,Stunning Sunrise,Love this beach! Lots of wind but still a good time for us! Love the vibs! We Will be coming back for sure!
81,Very impressed !,"We went there the week before christmas, before all the crowds. Lovely beach. So clean. Easy to walk on.  Fun restaurants nearby. Water was warm and calm."
82,South Beach still shines,"A must to see, and just a hop from the city, here there are Art Deco buildings, beach side bars and eating places everywhere."
83,Absolutely disturbing and disgusting,"Not only is the water warm and refreshing but the color is so relaxing to see from the sand or the hotel if you happen to have ocean view. The best part in my opinion is that it offers a 3 plus miles stretch of dedicated paved running path as well as roller skating or riding a bicycle. It is an uninterrupted stretch along the beach and beautiful landscaping that just encourages you to run walk or ride even if you never did before. Amenities along the path include: water fountains, monkey bars and free weights if you just want to get a full workout in for the day without having to be inside the gym."
84,nice day,"A lovely beach, pristine and blissful. Take the family there to enjoy the sun sand and sea or rock solo and enjoy it yourself. I visited in Jan 2020 and the place was cold as well as the ocean."
85,Great place for a relaxing walk especially after dinner/dark.,Spend a great day at South Beach. Enjoyed the water and the waves. Good size waves but not overpowering. The beach is very long so we enjoyed a nice long walk.
86,Fun all night long,"The best part of Miami is the beach. Rent a cabana, bring snacks, beverages and sunscreen. A year-round destination. Club all night, sunbathe and dry out by day. Breezy, relaxed and barely-dressed. South beach is easy-going glam. There was a concert stage setting up for Rhianna when I was there. Very cool! Jet ski is also a must."
87,Busy today,"The trendy, but beautiful beach to be seen at. Packed on a hot day. Silver sand, warm waters. Life guards. Beautiful people. Music. Shouldn‚Äôt be missed!"
88,"Relaxed with a complimentary chair and towel provided by my hotel, Gale South Beach.","Clean, beautiful sands and a terrific boardwalk. Just yards from hotels, bars and eateries.We were at the very southernmost end and it was quiet whilst not deserted. Easy to park there too."
89,Great beach with lots of space,"What an experience to relax on South Beach Miami. We rented bikes and cycled all the way by the beach, it was super cool! $6 for an hr."
90,stunning,"i would say this is one of the most beautiful beached in the untied states, the ocean views, the people watching, the architecture, the food !"
91,Excellent but expensive,"Beautiful white sands. Nice, wide, long, and relatively clean compared to other beaches we frequented in Florida last month.  Plenty of restaurants, bars, palm trees lighted up like Christmas all year long. Whatever you do, you must stop for lunch or dinner at Larios on the Beach!!!"
92,we are in Miami south beach.,"A must-visit when in FL. Beautiful water and sands, several bathrooms are conveniently located along Ocean Dr. Muscle Beach is just a short walk from the Art Deco. Lots to see, lots to photograph, and lots to enjoy!"
93,Expansive clean beach,It was a nice walk and a calm day.  Went to the pier and took photos.  The beach was busy and inviting.
94,Clear water and white sand....,Wow! What a beautiful beach!! I was pleasantly surprised by the beach although the sign for chair and umbrella rental suggested an outrageous price!! The sea around the beach offers lots for you to see and do!
95,Beautiful Beach ,"Love this expanse of the beach.  Very clean, nice people.  Walkways easy to navigate if you didn't want to walk in the sand."
96,I have a wonderful night out with my friends before we return to our town. Dinner was great and good portions.,"If you want a fabulous break from the winter blues...go to Miami!  The modern white buildings, beautiful beach, GREAT restaurants, music, museums, shopping...and it's open late into the night.  Visit Collins Ave, the historic art deco buildings, and end the day with delicious cocktails!  YUM!"
97,Great long stretch of beach with plenty of room for many tourists,Beaches are free and friendly.  Concessions are readily available to rent chairs and umbrellas and to sell snacks.  Ocean is lovely.
98,Large white sand beach,"It‚Äôs south beach, it‚Äôs what you want. Your hotel should have a place to get chairs and towels on the beach. Public Restrooms about every 4 streets. And don‚Äôt forget to check out all the color beach towers"
99,beautiful sandy beaches,"Just a short walk over from Ocean Drive to the Beach, see the miles long white sandy beach that Miami Beach offers. And be sure to check out the Art Deco designed and brightly painted life guard stations standing guard over the beach. They are quite colorful and make great photo opportunities!"
100,Sand sea sun,every place we stopped was an amazing experience and all the people were so friendly.  one of the most relaxing trips ever
101,White sand beach for long walks and sunbathing or swimmimg,There‚Äôs no place like So Beach. Everyone is here for a good time and there‚Äôs something. For everyone.
102,"YES, please visit for the love of blue and green waters.",Lifeguards every few hundred feet.  Lots of hotels and businesses provide umbrellas and chairs.  Tons of restaurants nearby for lunch.
103,An Icon,"Fab place, close to beach and Lincoln mall not to say ocean drive ! Great location from national hotel to all hotel places for dining and night life..Enjoy this gem and area.,,"
104,Bice Cucina,Miami Beach is like the Gold Coast in Australia on steroids. Is clean iconic and surrounding cafes make for a interesting stay
105,Beautiful,"My first time visiting this beach and was not disappointed at all. This beach goes on for kilometers, and is probably 400 meters wide. No wonder this is one of those spring break destinations, as I dont think you could run out of room. Additionally, the beach has a good vibe that is both family friendly and adult friendly. While I dont think this is a clothing optional beach, there were many women topless on the beach. As for the sand, it is fine, and not rocky at all, and their is no garbage whatsoever.The water is clear and clean and great for swimming. I can see why this is a must visit place while in miami"
106,South beach,Fun weekend in Miami.  Cultural walk thursday evening and art deco weekend.  We loved the sites and the sunshine!
107,"Lively area, nice beach",A very special place with its own style of architecture and despite the rain was still very colourful and full of activity and entertainment.
108,Why would anybody go to the Islands?,Beautiful weather and location! There is a lot to do at every hour of the day! Prices are a little on the high side but that is to be expected at a location like South Beach! Bring your wallet and sunscreen!
109,The wow beach of Miami. Beautiful people & beach. ,Beautiful clean public beach.  Lifeguards during the day which is needed because when I arrived the winds were so strong it was surfer weather not for weak swimmers or children.   Hotels took a large portion with private chairs/umbrellas and cabanas.  Lots of cans for trash and recyclables.  Free sunscreen offered.
110,Quick getaway,Lovely clean stretch of sand that goes on and on. Only question is where are the toilets. Very photogenic. Lots of sections marked out for hotels but plenty of space for public access.
111,Awesome!,"Nice beach, as described. Busy on a hot day. Beach is kept clean of litter. Can get drinks from the various little stands. Sadly no toilets on the beach?"
112,VERY nice beach,"Great place to chill, and enjoy the day. The sand it very white , and clean, the water blue and clear. It‚Äôs a lovely beach, and very close to all the shops and restaurants if you should need anything."
113,Beautiful beach! ,"Long, long beach with lots of chairs.  When we were there it was totally clean and well kept.  I‚Äôve heard other things about this beach but I have to speak as I find, and we didn‚Äôt have a problem at all."
114,Beautiful ... but an unexpected eyeful,Well worth a visit. A lot of restaurants to choose from but a bit expensive. Hire A bike it‚Äôs cheap and great fun!
115,Colourful,"This must be one of the 3 most famous beaches in the world and it does not disappoint.It is clean, safe, spacious, flat and close to all of the facilities.There is nothing to dislike."
116,South beach- crowded beach,First time visit with my hubby for our 10 year and it was fabulous. Love the city and beaches. Clean and warm waters
117,"A lot of Fun, but overpriced","You can take picts besides or in the front of these scenic beach houses/observation towers, some do it to post on social cal media. Best time early in the morning or late afternoon. Be careful of the strong sun, protection required. The beach is clean and ordinary, public authorities (Security and cleaning services) are present. One day on the beach during your holidays here is a must."
118,South beach visit with my 20 something girls,Beautiful beach! Little crazy and chaotic due to the fact Ocean Drive is closed down and lack of police presence. Local government needs to make there presence more to maintain order.
119,Is this all?,"I went here to see ‚ÄúSouth Beach‚Äù and enjoyed seeing the beautiful Art Deco buildings, the restaurants lining the streets and lovely hotels."
120,"Beautiful area to relax, stroll, eat, drink, or soak up the sun.",The beach was very clean and beautiful. The sun was not shining that day but it was still fun to walk the soft sand.
121,Fun and Relaxing Time,"Pristine beach, cristal clear water and the finest sand I ever touched make of the South Beach in Miami Beach, a place to visit. We enjoyed an unforgettable day there that leaves on us great memories"
122,Outstanding Experience,The beach was extremely busy on Sunday afternoon. There are rental chairs etc available but my biggest problem is the sand - it is very coarse.
123,Great walking beach,"You can just walk along the boardwalk for miles....which we did! Great to get some exercise and no cyclist allowed, so safe, too!"
124,Winter Excursion ,"great beach for sunning, bathing and walking.  A little breezy during the first two days but the surfers were enjoying every wave."
125,A rare visit to the beach üèñ ,"Maybe the greatest beach we personally have visited... We loved everything about it.. The turquoise water, the clean sand, the calmness and closeness to Miami Art Deco..."
126,Beautiful!,What ever you do don‚Äôt miss south beach . This is what Miami is all about.Fun vibrant exciting and energetic.An Absolute must
127,Afternoon at South Beach,This is a beautiful beach. We couldn't fully enjoy due to poor weather but we spent some time at the pier and sitting in the sand watching the surf come in. Also had a wild iguana siting. Hope we can come back some day.
128,Great for walks and people watching,very nice beach - little rocky ocean floor - but beautiful beach and people - the skyline and activity level is nice - and you can spend the whole day here:)
129,Great for a Morning Walk,South Beech is a lovely and beautiful beech.  The sand is lovely which provides an excellent opportunity for games or sunbathing.  It is really a nice beech.
130,The boardwalk....,Max and Adam are incredible. Will return only because of their amazing service! The 1 Hotel is a great vibe.
131,Best place for sun bathing and taking picts,"So much to see and do here, highly recommend a trip. There were police everywhere so we felt very safe. The food was amazing!"
132,A great place to wander or just relax,"The beach is beautiful and you will have an amazing day. However, don't try to rent a chair and some shadow, they will charge $60.00 for it, crazy! A bottle of water$6.00. Be prepare to spend money if you're prepared."
133,Vacation,"beautiful large sandy expanse (thank the army corps of engineers!) but crowded and expensive to rent chairs, umbrellas or lounges"
134,Nice beach ,The best part of South Beach is the beach itself.  The restaurants are overpriced and for the quality of food  NOT WORTH IT!  The drinks are insanely expensive.  The service on Ocean Drive does not warrant a return trip.
135,wonderful beach,This is a lovely long beach of white sand.  A bit crowded at times (go early in the morning for the best experience) but there really is plenty of space.  We loved the colourful lifeguard huts.
136,Such a fun time!,"So beautiful, clean and quiet.  Having an umbrella and a chair was very helpful. Not too crowded everyone kept social distance and that was very important. Can‚Äôt wait to go back."
137,Beautiful Beach,The beach was really nice the chairs and umbrellas are $20 which I thought was a little expensive but over all it was nice.
138,A huge margaritas ,"Not only is the beach huge, but the surrounding area has anything a person could want. There is a reason it is so popular."
139,Love it in South Beach!,"Clean, picturesque, and a highlight of our stay in Miami.  Just beautiful, with warm waters and stunning sunsets."
140,A Miami must,Exactly what you would think of in a Beach.  Lots of sand and beautiful water.  The water was too cold for us.. but even in December there were swimmers out in it.  The beach was not very crowded when we were there.
141,Great area,Enjoyed going to the beach in January. The sand wasn't as soft as other beaches. The seagulls were relentless when I pulled out my lunch. But the water was clean. Waves were calm.
142,As beautiful as ever,"Clean, nice walktrails, warm water and big!Space for eberybody. Everything Is well maintained. Not to forget the nice people and the Bars and Restaurants very close."
143,South Beach so much fun,I love South Beach.  Where else can you see the entire world in one day.Parking on the beach is hit or miss and mostly missTake the walk from the garages and then bask in the lily glory and behold things that may make you blush but mostly make you smile.
144,Lovely place ,I wish a waiter would come by and take our drink orders but beach is nice. Great for a stroll and drinks are allowed on the beach.
145,"Nice, popular beach.",Beautiful beach.. Im glad i came on weekdays as its less people and you can enjoy the beach side without being crowded
146,Beautiful and Clean ,"Beach is beautiful. Especially, there are many colorful small houses for the life guards. Walking on the beach is relax. In the morning, yoga or meditation is nice. But, the sand quality could be better."
147,A Dream,"The south beach is a very large beach, very beautiful and very large but the afternoon it was very hot, luckily we spent the afternoon swimming, the water was transparent"
148,As expected,"We only came once because we preferred the private beach of our hotel,it was a beautiful and large beach with supervised swimming areas, the sand was very hot on the feet"
149,Lifeguard stations are a must see,"This place offers two totally different sight-seeing experiences.During the day time, the close proximity of the beach makes this place a destination for sun-tanning, water dipping and just plain relaxation.After dark transformed the place into a busy place with gorgeous, light-up Art-Deco buildings and Christmas like board walk!Lots of restaurant occupying the entire Ocean Drive stretch. Fun to grab a patio table and do some classic and muscle cars watching."
150,on a clear day just sit and watch the people go by that is a attraction in its self.,We toured the area and got some great history on Miami South Beach and Ocean drive. It was a great experience.
151,Day on the beach.,"I came to spend 2 hours between 2 professional meetings, I really enjoyed this large beach, the water is turquoise, there were a lot of very beautiful girls"
152,Florida's most famous beach,"The beaches were beautiful and not over-crowded. The seaweed was quite bothersome, but that is expected at times. Rented a beach chair/umbrella at the beach and had a great time."
153,very pretty!,"If you travel to Miami and area, make sure to stop at South Beach!  It is a fabulous time, from people watching, just walking and exploring, having drinks and enjoying the water.  You won't be disappointed.  But take in mind, it's not cheap!"
154,A beautiful beach ,"South Beach Miami is one of the main beaches of Miami, Florida. It is a long and wide beach with gorgeous clean white sand. The waves are not surf waves and the sea can be choppy. There is a long walking path next to the beach that makes moving from one part to another easy. The beach is often very crowded and there is a lot of activity, volleyball etc. Along the beach are areas where you can hire a deck chair and an umbrella. I loved watching the afternoon fleet of cruise ships leave the harbour from the south end of the beach - starts about 5pm."
155,Iconic beach,"Great beach, enjoyed bathing and swimmIng in exciting waves and natural sand safe in the knowledge that the excellent lifeguards are on hand in the event of need. First class,"
156,Fun area,"If you have kids under the age of 5, there are several beautiful parks to visit in south beach, particularly south of 15th to 1st street beach! üëçüèΩ"
157,Running,"This mix of beach, shopping, drinking, walking and dining is a total win.  There is always a party in South Beach somewhere.  Music, smiles and joy are everywhere.  It is a great place to be, no matter what occasion.  Beautiful ocean and good vibes!"
158,beautiful beach,"We spotted out door gym by the Miami Beach on our morning walk. This is really a lively gym where people work out in natural atmosphere. Clean and fresh out door activities, we loved it.The Miami Beach area is so nice and wonderfully landscapes excited us and will definitely visit again and stay longer."
159,Very happening !,I have been their twice. I love the beach and it is so nice it covers the multiple sins of the problems.
160,you don't see this in New England,Very clean and well organized. Life guards are present. So are the police. Very safe environment so that we could just soak in the sun and enjoy!
161,Awesome Food spectacular service. ,We really didn‚Äôt have that much fun on South Beach. The hype was definitely there. We had lots of people tell us to go. But in reality for us it was just a walk on the beach. Not much there. We had a much better time at Hollywood Beach.
162,Amazing beach! A great way to get some sun in the winter months!,"Went here daily while I was in South Beach, an ideal place to just relax while in Miami : highly recommended (not sure about the possibility of shark attacks though üòÇ)"
163,Nice beach,"Walked around at the tail end of a major Arts show - there were still sand sculptures on the beach which were pretty cool.  There is a section dedicated for people to work out and exercise at - one of the busier places just off the beach.  Easy access from the main drag with lotsa families, couple and singles walking around."
164,gorgeous beach but crowded,Love the vibe! The beach is amazing although was a little busy on Saturday but to be expected on the weekend in 80 degree heat. However very expensive to hire beds ($30 each) and umbrellas ($20 each). Also a small bottle of water is $5 so best to bring your own !!!
165,"Beautiful, clean beaches ",South Beach is miles of activity from the quiet Northern side to the Art Deco district. There is always something going on and there is plenty of access. Nice pathway to run or bile all along the stretch of beach as well. Love the iconic Lifeguard huts.
166,Wow! What a fantastic Beach,Bring your credit card and try not to gawk. No cheap eats here and the scenery is awesome. Go inside some of these beautifully restored restaurants/bars/hotels. Quite the scene.
167,Great Beach !,No doubt a must visit while in Miami!!! Beautiful sea colours and wonderful beach shacks!!! Highly recommended!!!
168,Nice beach,"I always had good references about south beach, despite the current situation I was able to enjoy the beach."
169,Lots of activity for the day before superbowl,"Perfect place to go to beach, walking around the promenade, have a drink in different hotel bar, time has stop, just perfect"
170,"Mid January, beautiful",Beach was very clean and well maintained sand was very clean ocean water was clean and warm very relaxing
171,timeles Miami,"It was rainy and gloomy all day, steps from the hotel was the beach. Tourists frequent by 10 am...solitude and waves are best enjoyed before 10!"
172,the sun was shining too,You just need to see it. The kids enjoyed playing in the sand and on the playground next to the beach.
173,Beautiful Beach,"Try and visit the beach and sunrise, take a walk along the shore. You won't be disappointed, the view is beautiful."
174,Anniversary Trip After Cruise,We went there on a Monday afternoon. It wasn't crowded and the sand strip is wide and clean. The water was on the cooler side.
175,It's a Beach,It's a sh1tty place full of pretenders and with high prices...with less than 50% money I can go to a better beach and with 3 or 4 times better food and prices in South America...worst place ever
176,Beautiful!,"Very busy over the holidays, beds are closely packed together. Good beach staff with a can do attitude, if your looking to party it‚Äôs fine and there are also lots of families."
177,The Sea,I love this place . South beach is a place that everyone should come. Its the second time that Im here .. I will come back againüî•üî•
178,"Beautiful, fantastic Art Deco and the place to people watch","A must for any traveler, something for all the senses. Excellent restaurants, all the shopping you could want from the super high end shops to Target. Clean beach, and very safe. Ocean Drive is hopping with great night life, beautiful Art Deco hotels and great restaurants."
179,iconic lifeguard huts,"Clean, white sand pretty beach!Was cool and gloomy yet the beach ever calls!Recommend a stroll on the sand!Nice rinse stations when exiting."
180,‚Äú Lovely beach ‚Äú ,"This is no doubt a beautiful beach.  And if you are in the area, you should certainly go and take a look (but see caution below). Awesome white sand against unbelievable blue water ... and the lifeguard huts are a nice colorful touch.  The beach is clean and well maintained.   But as other reviewers have mentioned, it is crowded.  While there is plenty of room to lay on the beach and hit the surf, this is not a place to lounge and relax.  And a caution -- there were many people wearing next to nothing, skimpy swimsuits, thongs, and some were even topless.  This can certainly be an unexpected eyeful, especially if you are not accustomed to seeing this on a beach."
181,Very nice beach,There is a lot of space at the beach so you don't have people sitting right next to you. Very clean beach.
182,"Great place to party, relax, eat and shop.","A great beach.  No toilets, you have to return to your hotel if you require one.  We stayed at a hotel close by where we were given a voucher for two beach lounges on the beach but had to pay twenty dollars for a sun umbrella.  You can by drinks and food on the beach after 11.00am.  Miami is one of the most expensive places I have ever been to.  Eating out is nuts!"
183,wonderful walk and art deco weekend celebration,Beach good hot water but very full of seaweedBut for children it is worth knowing.Be careful of living water.
184,"Beautiful area by restaurants, beach and shopping.",Gorgeous sandy beach that stretches for miles on end. Really big. Not super busy but maybe it‚Äôs because we went in low season. Felt really safe. Lots of sun beds on offer. Gorgeous beach to top up your sun tan.
185,Just like seen in the movies!!!,I say it is never quiet around South Beach so if you are looking for a party this is the place to be. Nightlife in abundance for every taste you could think of
186,Bolivar... Wow! ,It's a must to walk the beach if you're staying here. The pastel-coloured lifeguard huts are truly photogenic.
187,Nice beach in January. Warm enough to get in the water.,Beautiful even on a cloudy day and perfect to walk down the beach while having your feet in the water.
188,Check out the life guard stations!,"Juan Chipoco took his culinary art to a new level.The food is amazing. The decor reminds me Miami Beach of the 50's. Elegant, formal, and cozy."
189,Nice beach,"Clean and blue water, so warm too (I am more used to sea in the UK!) a place to walk, run and cycle as well to relax in the sun - it is a must see on a visit to Miami."
190,A beach with a City Vibe,Not one for beach life but was pleasantly surprised with how good our day in the beach was. Great beach attendant service and offer. Beautiful climate (February) lovely breeze and another good day in Miami.
191,Just an ordinary beach,We as a family enjoyed our day out. We really enjoyed the walking and Sightseeing. Of course we also found some really great small stores and restaurants. Enjoy
192,LOVE YOU MIAMI,Always exciting to come back to this city . the right mix of American and Latin . A good place to start to visit Florida even though this is the most unAmerican city . Central for West coast gulf and Keys which is a must .
193,Interesting area ,"Iconic location, well policed, safe and great fun! Lifeguards attentive, and seems like it's raked each morning too. Perfect"
194,Busy beach,"Another please i spent so much time at during my trip to Miami, beautiful beach, people and excellent places to chill"
195,Lovely,"Walking to watch the sun rise from the southern point has become a favorite with us when we visit Miami Beach. Great for ambiance, great light for photography and great for people watching. Finishing the walk with a breakfast on Ocean Drive makes this a perfect way to start your day."
196,Surprisingly great beach and very happening vibe,We went to some greazt restaurants and walked all over Souith Beach.  I would definitely go again.  It an easy ride to and from the airport.
197,Beautiful Beach ,"I did not swim but, but took a board walk along South Beach which is very pleasant, but you need to watch out for joggers and people on their bikes."
198,The Art Deco district IS unique,Last minute family vacation. Lots to do and great place to do nothing if you choose  also.   If you want to sit quietly and just listen to the waves you may be out of luck since music seems to piped in from everywhere.
199,South Beach Paradise Strip,Favorite beach in the US! Clean and pristine. I would just avoid during spring break. You won't be disappointed.
200,wish we could have gone in!,"Times have changed here.  Last time I was here was 2018 and it was fun, hopping, energy, good looking people, nice cars, what one would expect from South Beach.  Not anymore!  Not many people, very low class feeling, did not feel safe, most people wearing masks, restaurants have downgraded their use of real plates and silverware, at many places, but still charge very high prices, always including the 18% service charge.  If you like less people and beautiful beaches, this is the time to go, if you desire what Miami, VIP, etc etc, this is not for you!  FYI-$50 fine for not wearing a mask....even in 95 degrees, except at the beach, no one was wearing them."
201,Our favorite morning walk.,Visited south beach for my birthday after the 4th of July. The beach was nice and socially distanced. I really enjoyed it!
202,love ocean drive,"While we didn't stay in South Beach, I highly recommend a tour. The art deco architecture has been well preserved and if you're a history buff, you'll really enjoy it."
203,"Lively place, very user friendly",I had a blast in Miami South Beach Florida üèñ I bought all Souvenir & a baby shark ü¶à to take home !
204,Nice beach,"Nice beach. But we travelled during December, was windy and cold. Probably would surely be a good visit in Summer months."
205,Great Beach,"After going to siesta Beach by Sarasota, this just doesn't compare to the number one beach, it does have a beautiful view a nice sky line behind you, but there are definitely nicer beaches and the sand was not very good for building castles.  Add on the dozen cigarette butts within sight of where I sat, and.. you make up your own mind if it sounds like a place you want to go???"
206,Great beach,Went for Art Deco festival. The architecture is phenomenal. The streets were blocked off for the festival which was very fun. We felt safe. A lot of police presence. Beach clean. Water too cold to swim.
207,Fun to see,The water was so blue and beautiful . Where I am from which is New York the water is no where close to this beauty
208,nice clean beach,"How can yu not love quirky South Beach, always sometihing for the eyes...fun place any time of the year!"
209,"Sand, Sun and Art Deco","I have been to South Beach a half dozen trips for various reasons and enjoy it presents an opportunity for a nice, long, unobstructed walk while being close to plenty of restaurants and shops.  Don't expect serene ocean sounds in the evenings, rather it is that mixed with music from nearby establishments and cars along Ocean Drive."
210,Must visit,"The movies and music videos don‚Äôt really do the area any justice. It goes on for miles, people are everywhere, doing everything."
211,Fun place,South Beach Miami. If you are thinking of staying in South Beach prior to a cruise forget it. The whole place is a rip off. From 2 sandwiches and 2 coffees costing you $65 to dinner 1 course and wine at $165 if we had 4 courses it would have been $300. They have a mandatory 20% tip included plus tax of 7% so you really feel at every turn you are being had over.  Our hotel was $250 a night and the breakfast is another rip off. Plus a resort fee added after you have prepaid of $40 a night and some hotels are up to $ 80 a night. The whole area seems run down with 25% of shops empty it feels like a ghetto so if you are cruise passengers avoid this whole area. Stay downtown or by the port...avoid South Beach at all costs otherwise you will be fleeced at every point and you cannot avoid it. Be warned! Shipmates this place is not for you.
212,one of the most beautiful beaches,So enjoyed my first poke bowl!! Poke Bowl Heaven here!! Great atmosphere too! Lovely owner ü§©Support this place!!! I ate it all!!!
213,It was Lit,"to be somewhere to escape from to glorious South Beach! Compact, spacious, fast, slow and oh, the buildings, the food, the drinks, the action, and the folks. It's hard to imagine human nor beast that doesn't LOVE SoBe..."
214,Great Beach,"My husband and I planned to extend our trip and celebrate our anniversary in South Beach.  We love the action, architecture, beach and variety of hotel and food options in South Beach.  This visit did not disappointed, as it was just as beautiful and active as we had remembered. To our surprise we were present the Sunday before the Super Bowl.  All the big sports channels had set up along the ocean front to broadcast live.  Every visit we have been surprised by various events happening along the waterfront, great place to sit and watch the world walk by.  If you are looking for quiet South Beach is not for you, we are in our 50‚Äôs and love to see action, watch young people be young and feel the pulse and energy of a hot spot.  The noise of music and traffic come with that and we love it on Ocean Ave.  Stayed at the lovely restored Victory hotel with a balcony to take advantage of the action.  If you are not like us and want quiet, you might want to consider Collins Ave., but you will need to walk further to beach and action.  I highly recommend this fantastic, fun, vibrant vacation destination! Great for couples but we saw families and we have brought our kids in their 20‚Äôs and they  think it is the place to be. Highly Recommend!"
215,Gorgeous beaches ,I think because of the Super Bowl weekend they closed quite a few roads leading to the beach so it was hard to access at first but once there it was something to just experience in Miami
216,Great music and great ambience,"Funky place, I loved it, cool underground music and saxophone live player and awesome huge margaritas and one more for free. I‚Äôll keep going that place"
217,Fun Stop off Ocean Dr,"Why would anybody go to the Islands?I could not ever understand, Miami Beach has all and everything that island have but U R home in USA do not to have to go to ctrage places and eat nobody knows what.This place is a paradise full of first class restaurants shops and great looking people"
218,WOWEE,I took a jogging lap around 6.30 am what a beautiful day and pictures the breeze was amazing to inhale
219,Relaxing under the worm Sun.....,"South Beach is for adults only but my wife and I love it!. If you're a young adult there is nightlife. There is beach for all ages. We love it, except for some weekends that get overcrowded (Memorial Day, etc.)."
220,Why Winter Exists...,"We all know the image -- buff bodies sunning on a tropical shore.  But South Beach is more than a great place to admire well-developed muscles.  It's a comfortable, wide beach, and a great place for an ocean dip, even if you're not a body beautiful."
221,The BEACH,1.The beach was packed with people on the Christmas day and looked very full. It felt like there was no space and lots going on. None the less beautiful beach!2.The water was blue/green and clear at the shore.3.I would not suggest this beach if you are seeking privacy or to relax(unless you come early morning).   4.Life Guards on duty and were very attentive for the safety of several swimmers that get into the water.5.Parking is not easy and public parking is not cheap even if you find parking garages that are located  far away from the beach.Have fun!
222,Great...1st Visit,excellent walking/people watching whether or not it's a beach day. Bring a camera and head from muscle area all the way down to the Lincoln Rd area before
223,Sunrise,"Came here for a few days and loved south beach. If you‚Äôre not wanting to spend a fortune on the beach I would recommend bringing a towel with you and not hiring a sun lounger as they‚Äôre 20‚Ç¨ per bed then 20$ for an umbrella. So it would of cost us 60$ for 2 beds and an umbrella. When we‚Äôd arrived there was 2 baby sharks feeding on a large group of fish which was cool to see, but the life guards preserved everyone out of the water until they‚Äôd cleared. It was cool."
224,Great views,"it was my first beach in the united states, I was really surprised not only by the size, the organization but also by the cleanliness, the beach is open to everyone, Old and young, sporty and lazy . The best 10 days of the year feb-mar 2020"
225,Great Beach,Just took my family here. We stayed at a hotel at mid beach which is several miles north of South Beach. We took the free shuttle from mid Beach area and walked on Lincoln Street and then ocean drive which is across from South Beach. It was a nice walk... There are several nice tourist gift shops ... We stopped and purchased small momentos to remember our trip. South Beach is nice but I would say go there just for the beach and go during the day.
226,Non stop action,1st time to miami south beach love the atmosphere will go again. Stood 4 blocks away from the beach loved the walking distance everyday
227,Miami beach,"Not to be missed, sit sipping a Margarita long enough and note you will see everything!Art Deco hotels to be seen both with blue sky‚Äôs and neon lights. Beautiful park and walk then there is the beach and clear waterIn the evening find a front line restaurant and watch all manner of vehicles being paraded. On the side walk all sorts of dress is appropriate and on display. Atmosphere is electric with salsa music all around even from the dudes on their Harley‚Äôs cruising Ocean DriveThe area is expensive but worth staying a few nights."
228,Great beach!,"we were in miami only for a day. it was windy, water choppy and saw many portugese man of war jellyfish on the beach. didn't take the chance to go in... seems to be a nice and clean beach."
229,Amazing Experience,The beaches are dirty and the ocean water always has bacterial issues ( Fecal ..matterLoud offensive music in the Art Deco district Homeless all over the beach urinating in public
230,"Long, sandy beach",Beautiful sand. Water lapping my feet. Definitely a place to go to spend a few hours getting things back in perspective.
231,Fabulous deep white sand beach!,"Everything it was made out to be. Glitz, glamour, beautiful women, and supercars. People dont eat dinner until 10, and many clubs don't open until midnight or 2AM... and they stay open until 5AM. On the flip side, brunch goes until 4PM! Bring your smallest bathing suit and you'll fit right in! We saw Pitbull at American Airlines. The show started at 8, he didnt come on until 11:30... just typical Miami!!"
232,Fun impromptu family vacation,"I love South Beach and wish I have allotted more time to stay.  I stayed here for 4 nights and simply enjoyed this.  I strolled along the beach, visited the Art Deco area, enjoyed the abundant restaurants and drinks along the beach and simply had a great time."
233,Plenty of sights and sounds!,"Such a shame that a specific type of people have ruined this once exotic, safe, fun strip of bars, restaurants,  and hotels ...all previously with that awesome Latin flare!   Sadly, now, its ghetto."
234,Great beach if you stay on the beach,We arrived by 6:30 to avoid traffic & get a parking spot.  There was a police presence & lots of fiscal under achievers.  Clean & safe restrooms.  Lots of people taking photos & looking for metal.
235,Nice beach,I take time for A walk on the Oceandrive as a good tourist and my friends suggest to me I was on the beach to see the amazing  Sand‚ÄôCars as a virtual traffic jam on the 66. The installation for the event Art Basel was a terrific surprise!
236,Busy beach,"Great place to visit, buzzing at night time, been before but only during the day. Fell in love with South Beach this time. Will definitely go back"
237,Worth a visit,"Walking and driving along Ocean Avenue was quite the experience of a lifetime. My parents were here in the 1950‚Äôs. While times have changed, the eclectic buildings of yesteryear remain the same. Most of the hotels including the Clevelander had the old fashioned wall lamps, multicolored terrazzo flooring, stainless steel fixtures that reminded you of past life for the rich and famous. During the upcoming Super Bowl, prices for accommodations can reach several thousands of dollars per night. Driving during the evening hours provided us with light menagerie of beauty as the light glimmer and lite the building facades. This truly was a wonderful experience."
238,"South Beach, Miami","The beach is a great photo option.    I like space between people.   This was not the beach for it.    It is so crowded.    There is parasails, jet skis, and paddle boards for rent but honestly to many people to enjoy."
239,Great for people watching,"Lots of young (college age) people (more than middle beach), many blacks of walkway, some grassy fields, benches.  Close to public transit."
240,Pitbull in Miami,"We came here on cheap plane tickets amid the COVID19 crisis, and have had a great time! A lot of stuff was shut down because of the virus but it was still a great time! Beaches were beautiful, food was incredible, and the people were warm and welcoming!"
241,Great location ,"I love spending time in south beach everytime i go to Miami, but this time was not the same due to covid."
242,Awesome beach when not crowded,"clean white sand beech, we went in Jan so it was not too too crowded, how ever the restaurants in that area are pricy"
243,Art Deco Preserved in the Modern Era,"Here for superbowl.  Obviously very busy with lots happening in the area . Was clean and tidy . Surprised how quite the beach was , everyone must've been away at events . Felt very safe . Plenty restaurants and hotels . All in all nice place to go for a stroll"
244,Fun,"It is SO worth setting your alarm on vacation and dragging yourself with coffee in hand to watch the sunrise along South Beach. The lifeguard stations make for some beautiful visual interest in your sunrise photos, or just sit and relax  and  breathe as the sun peeks up over the ocean-just beautiful..."
245,Gotta see this,"Miami is a unique and amazing place oozing with culture,  South beach is one of the finest examples of that."
246,Beach Days,"I lived in Rio for 20 years, so I know beaches. Don't know if we hit exceptional weather, but the water was delightful: almost warm, gentle waters, nice sandy bottom. In certain spots, it's shallow for many yards out. Clean beach. Went on a Monday, so there were no crowds."
247,Setai,We expected more but beach is average. Beach is clean and life guards all are alert. After beach bath there is some fresh water sowers are there but too much of rush. Climate is super.
248,Beautiful ... despite the weather,Excellent in every way. Staff made us feel so welcomed. Recognized our celebrations with champagne and cake. We felt indulged and special. Pricey but worth it.
249,Early Morning Walk On The Beach,"We decided to leave the rain and cool temperatures in Atlanta and basked in the warm sunshine of South Beach. A great decision.  We stayed at the Marriott Stanton. A nice place right on the beach. The only draw back to this hotel is it‚Äôs pool bar. It is not a tiki bar and should be. The wait staff at the pool bar is just okay. We ate at Monty‚Äôs, Joe‚Äôs Stone Crab, Pink Pig and a few other places along South Beach. Monty‚Äôs was disappointing but the rest were good. Especially Joe‚Äôs, that was fantastic. We will be going back to South Beach again next February."
250,Always a nice time,"4th Visit to South Beach never disappoints.  We visit in November, great weather  and not too busy.  Friendly people something for everyone."
251,Nice beach,"We haven‚Äôt been to Miami Beach in several years and were really looking forward to our visit.  After this trip, we will NEVER be back. The entire South Beach area has been taken over by thuggish 20-somethings openly smoking dope on the streets, barely clothed, and screaming obscene language in public, both day and night.  We frequently ran into large groups that blocked building entrances where they gathered, yelling to be heard over their stereos and one another.  They made no effort to share the sidewalks and store aisles, or to respect other visitors.  The screeching, roaring Bentley‚Äôs and Ferrari‚Äôs raced up the main streets with rap music blasting until 3:30 or 4:00 am. each night, waking us repeatedly in our 5th-floor hotel room.  We are so glad that our children were not here with us because there were a lot of offensive images and terrible behaviors.  It‚Äôs sad to see this significant decline in South Beach. The City needs to get a serious handle on this problem."
252,Without question a top 10 Beach in the world!,The beach was not as clean as I remembered.  Got up early to watch the sunrise.  While watching the sun rise we picked up so much plastic.  Kind of sad.
253,Awesome! ,"Visit Cervecer√≠a del Barrio n Lincoln Rd. Especially the bar, extremely friendly staff (Jose and Alejandro) ask for them!!"
254,Everything it's cracked up to be.,We just got off the cruise and was hopeful to have an enjoyable sunny day in south beach but Mother Nature had other plans. Very cool place and plenty of great people watching going on. The beach and the ocean drive are great to explore.Sad our day was windy and cloudy but still great experience for us.
255,Stay away cruise shipmates,The reputation is that the clientele on the beach all have perfect 10 bodies. Somewhere that went off-track. I guess those with a lesser score make you appreciate the ones that truly belong there.
256,It goes without saying!,"I love the music great salsa selection need some improvement on the bathrooms dough, other than that I recommend this restaurant"
257,Just amazing ,Great price I would recommend anyone looking for a great and deal and feel at home property to check out Sunbright Apts
258,Art Basel and SoBe an amazing day,We had an excellent meal and great drinks with Matteo. He was very professional behind the bar with great customer service. Highly recommend a visit to Bice Cucina on Ocean Drive!
259,Awesome ,"South Beach, Miami is like no other place during Super Bowl week,,,, the place is teaming with excitement, all day and into the night.  Best place to be during those long winter nights in the north east."
260,Best fun place anywhere,"South Beach streches along the southern end of the Miami Beach island facing the ocean. It's parallel to the iconic Ocean Dr. and is probably Florida's most famous beach.It's very long and pretty wide, free for everyone to enjoy warm waters. Very picturesque and vivid color painted lifeguard's houses. Been there 3 times over years, never gets crowded.This time we celebrated New Year 2020 on it with hundreds of others."
261,Beautiful beach all year round,"We stayed 3 nights in South Beach. It was full of live at any time of the day, which we really liked- we were close to a lot of happenings even with a small toddler. It is not the typical child friendly place, as full w parties- but still quite enjoyable. Loads of good restaurants around."
262,Clean but there is a lot of construction ,"Loud screaming late at night, smell of weed is a constant, large groups of people blocking the the sidewalk and traffic being held up until people in the car purchased their weed. Those arev some of things you will have to deal with if you come to South Beach.  We had to move 3 times while at the beach to get away from the strong skunky smell of weed and the constant din of gangster rap music. I can't believe how things have changed in South Beach. I used to love coming here but not anymore.  Be very careful if you're traveling a long way to get here because it is not worth it."
263,One of my favourite holiday destinations,"It is in the neighborhood of Miami Beach. We parked at Nikki Beach parking lot (10$/24hr) on 1st St. and spent the whole day on the beach. Waves were rough today but water was green, clear and nice breeze. You can walk a bit further to South Point Pier and have a good view of the city."
264,BEWARE:   South Beach is Ghetto,"VERY crowded along with people who are offensive. Don't bring young children here. Many are top less and more use offensive, loud language and could care less how their activities offend others. Then, the constant advertising from planes and barges. DO I really need to see a condom ad every ten minutes? Like I said, don't bring young kids. No one behaves. Drugs are rampant with the smell of dope wafting down the beach. And people... please don't show your naked body if you are not fit, it is disgusting."
265,Nice long beach close to food and shops,A perfect time to walk on the beach is first thing in the morning before the midday heat and whilst it‚Äôs not crowded.You can walk for miles !!!
266,Amazing beach!,Thank you for reopening in time for our visit Post Pandemic The water is incredible and we felt really safe despite all the party crowds
267,one of the best beaches in Florida,"get up early to collect shells and pick out a space for the day, remember the water undercurrent is very strong."
268,Swimming and bathing,"My 83 year-old mom came to visit and we spent the day walking around South Beach. We strolled the shop and restaurant lined streets then we went to the beach where we rented a couple of lounge chairs and an umbrella.   We had drink and food service and all was excellent!  Yes, excellent!  Hey Californian‚Äôs can you imagine a gorgeous beach where adults are allowed to order a glass of wine and sit under an umbrella watching the waves while engaging in pleasant conversation?  Well that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôll find in South Beach where responsible adults are treated accordingly. Amazing scenery CHECK. Great food CHECK. Gorgeous beach CHECK. Good for all ages and budgets CHECK.  The best looking lifeguard towers of any beach in the world CHECK."
269,Beach,Expensive to hire chairs and umbrellas. But bring your own towel and find a spot behind a hut away from the wind
270,Miami Beach ,"We walked along the beach road,Espinosa Way, Lincoln Road pedestrian shop area and Collins Avenue. The numerous restaurants we ate at were all excellent. Just an easy fun getaway."
271,Lovely beach,"With it's blue, green waters; jet skis roaring; seagulls flying and screaming overhead, South Beach has to be one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I may never leaveü§ó"
272,"Aggressive seagulls, homeless people and seaweed, not a great beach","amazing vibes any time you like to comw down at have a funntime, came every weekend. Go to kansas in lincoln rd is a must"
273,something for everyone,"We spent three days in South Beach en-route to see family in the Dominican Republic. There was a street festival of some sort going on the Saturday we were there.  Lots of food tents and tchotcke vendors, and maybe 100 antique cars on display.The buildings are pretty cool. Makes one wonder what it was like here in the 30's.Temperature was in the 70's...lively breeze made a windbreaker nice. A bit cool to get into the water, but there were some brave souls swimming."
274,absolutely loved the boardwalk....,"Things to know, there is a free trolly system that goes up and down Washington (North / South)It makes getting around much easier and less exhausting. If your coming in from the train station take the 42 bus to the airport. From the airport take the 150 bus to south beach. It‚Äôs $2.25 each a far cheaper fair than a cab or Uber. It takes almost the same amount of time. The buses make good time due to size alone. The 150 is an express so there are limited stops."
275,South Beach is special,Lives up to its reputation. Northern end the best. (Where Collins Ave meets Ocean Drive) went with my 19 year old for a mother-daughter spring break trip. Had a blast!
276,Best mornings,"My 1st visit to South Beach was because of an Eagles game but my next visit will be to take in the whole South Beach experience.  We stayed by the airport but had the opportunity to visit for a day and the mini-trip was Spectacular!!  For example,The Clevelander South Beach was great for crowd watching...the Venice Island-like promenade was a neat walking trip...the weightlifting set up on the beach was interesting to see...the crowds, the food smells, the noise...all of it was Cool!!  We ended up at the beach in front of the Fontainebleau and were treated to waiter service with our feet in the ocean...Incredible!!  And, we weren't even there for the nightlife...:)  Alright looking forward to the next trip to South Beach to do it all."
277,Love It,If you haven‚Äôt gotten up before work to see the sunrise on south beach then you‚Äôre missing something
278,Amazing!,"With all the covid regulations at 10th and south beach,these young men were awesome Great staffing DeAndre AsburyLeo GonzalezKenny G Tyreek Eccleston"
279,Miami beach,"Lovely area, that has tried to retain it's old charm. Architecturally, wonderful old art deco design, as it was in the 40's and 50's mixed with some new hotels. Great people watching."
280,Beach,I had a brief break from a busy work schedule and wanted to recharge with some sun and saltwater.  I hadn‚Äôt been to Miami since I was a wee lad circa 1972.  It‚Äôs changed... about 30 times!  We had perfect weather which always helps. The beach and the ocean were just what I hoped for and more.  I still can‚Äôt get over how respectful and mindful so many people were. It was everything I hoped it would be... and more!  Thanks
281,Mini Getaway,"Beautiful women  from all over the world.  Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, France, Germany. And of course the all Americans. Lol the beach is lively the water is warm. Come on in ."
282,Miami outdoor gym,"I want to thank Michelle from Guest services front desk at Stiles hotel for her excellent customer service. She made our vacation so perfect. She took care of us & no matter how busy the hotel was, she multi-tasked & made everyone feel at home. She inspires me to continue giving great customer service at my job back home. Positive genuine vibes are rare these days & I really appreciate people like Michelle."
283,great place,I have a wonderful night out with my friends before we return to our town. Dinner was great and good portions.
284,Gotta do it at some point in your life,It was my first trip to Miami.  We stayed on South Beach and would not do it again.  Most of the things we did were in Miami. Also did not find the attire or crowds alluring.
285,Great place to experience the best Cviche in Miami,"If you just want to hang out and work on your tan, this is the place. In the mood for a workout?  The top part of the beach is flat hard packed sand. You can walk/run for miles. Don't forget to visit South Point Park, the most southern portion of the beach. Watch the boats, take your kids to the playground, or just enjoy the many wonderful views."
286,Lively.,"Like much of Florida, this beach falls between the Atlantic and a brief nature buffer designed to protect the over-developed waterfront.  The area between the strand and the nature buffer was relatively narrow compared to many other beaches we've been on; winter storms remove much of the sand, and Miami Beach has struggled with beach replenishment.  Umbrellas and lounges are available, but the cost is excessive.  There is a boardwalk (covered in a separate review), but it does not have view of nor is it within view of the beach.  Access to this beach is via the beachfront hotel you are staying in, or via foot at passthroughs from A1A.  Street parking here is very limited and very expensive, so access to this beach is defacto limited to those who stay in the local hotels.  If your primary interest is surf and sand, there are much better beaches to visit.  I will say it was clean, although there were no trash cans in evidence."
287,From sunrise to sunset a wonderful place to be,not as busy or quite as i imagined - probably cos it is the winter season. Worth a visit though. Not as awesome as i had expected though
288,Ya gotta love South Beach,Great food. Thanks Vince. I had veal piccata. Had pasta with butter and cheese on the side. Amazing!!  Ceasar salad was really nice too. Fantastic wine list
289,Beautiful south beach,"South beach at its finest. Despite their being a current pandemic, south beach was packed as usual. We only went to the beach thankfully and ordered take out as restaurants were very busy and not giving the proper space."
290,The MOST beautiful thing...,"My husband surprised me with a weekend in Miami Beach for my upcoming 50th birthday. Even if the weather didn't cooperate, it was a lovely beach. Every few blocks it seemed like a different beach. Enjoyed 2 days renting chairs and just hanging out. Surf was rough and water was cold to me, but think that was due to the weather."
291,Warm getaway vacation,"I was staying on south beach working at Mt Sinai hospital during the COVID crisis as a RN in the ICU, not impressed with the area due to the high homelessness and expensive restaurant available"
292,Shopping & dinning ,"I had heard this area was a bit dodgy and as we were there for a couple of days before our cruise I wasn‚Äôt particularly bothered about it however it blew us away with how vibrant and clean the whole area was. The beach was great  with fantastic lively restaurants along ocean drive. Miami on the whole was very cool, we felt safe and will definitely be back."
293,Beautiful beach,"I live in the Mexican Caribbean so I was not really impressed however, if you are in the area yes come here and bathe in the waters why not."
294,Trendy beach ,"Only had time for a short visit but found it to be exactly as I expected. Lifeguard stations, pelicans, great sand etc.There is a nice walkway at the edge of the beach with bars and restaurants"
295,Delightful beach,"Another day in paradise.. If you don't go you won't know.. No place like it. Food ,fun , the most beautiful people in the world, the beach, the weather, South beach Miami is paradise"
296,great beach!,"Wasn't sure what our first experience was going to be considering we are in our early 60's and South Beach has the reputation of being for young partiers.  Absolutely not true.  We had such a great time; met many others our age, and everybody was friendly.  Weather was great, food was fantastic, and the boardwalk was just what we wanted since we like to excercise.  Great architecture and everything for the most part is within walking distance.  We never rented a car.  Took a Lyft from FLL and back.  Stayed 6 nights.  Can't wait to go back!"
297,"South Beach, Miami ","My stay was during weekdays and the weekend and wasn't that crowed, we rented some chairs an umbrella. Our experience was Great!"
298,"Narrow beach with very limited parking, difficult to access","I live in New York when at this time of the year, we are already wearing coats and layers. Yet, there in Miami South Beach, swimsuit and shorts. Ohlalaa...clear water and clean beach. LOOVEE"
299,Beach Days,"My husband and I visited South Beach Wednesday afternoon, a couple of days prior to Valentines Day. Our hotel (Stardust) provided chairs & an umbrella to use; however, we didn‚Äôt find them adequate so we rented the facilities equipment.  It cost $60 to rent three items, which I thought was very costly. Besides the cost, the customer service was great!!  King went out of his way to ensure our umbrella and chairs were properly set; he even tried to assist putting up the equipment that we brought to the beach. I witnessed him engaging with other guests and his customer service was phenomenal!!  The only downfall is my husband and I were not aware that Mr. King worked off tips and could have missed the opportunity to reward him for a job well done.  Great job King, keep up the good work!!!!   I would have given it a 5 star rating, if it wasn‚Äôt for the cost of renting the equipment and snack selections."
