0,Mystical magic,Viewing the Taj Mahal at sunset from across the river provides a different sensation than viewing it from the actual site. There is a mystical sense of peace and majesty- and quiet... This definitely gives you a full circle experience of the Taj Mahal - don’t miss it!
1,To view of Taj Mahal and the Yamuna wildlife ,It is wonderful feeling to saw the Taj Mahal from some distance at sunset across the yamuna river. We take some pictures of Taj. It is best &  less crowded place to click some beautiful pictures of Taj.
2,A different angle!,"This is the place to see the Taj Mahal at sunset. It was interesting to see this amazing building from across the river, framed by the trees of the garden. There weren't too many people there, so it was easy to get a good viewing place."
3,An ideal place to view the Taj Mahal at sunset.,Sunrise in summer will be ideal to take photos of the Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna River. It’s a really nice place to just sit and watch the sunset and the Taj Mahal. Really romantic. There is an entrance fee but as we hold an OCI card we paid local rates of Rupees 25 vs Rupees 300 for foreign tourists. It opens at sunrise and closes at sunset.
4,Peaceful place,"After experiencing the Taj Mahal at sunrise, you want to see at sunset.You will be driven to the opposite bank of Yamouna river and you will experience the Taj Mahal from the back with the sunrise changing its colour.They are currently building an impressive garden to improve the Customers experience. It will cost you as a foreigner 300 Rs. which I could say it is well spent money.Another must-see to say goodbye to Agra."
5,Magical evening at Mehtab Bagh,I loved seeing the Taj Mahal from the river side during the day.  It was beautiful to be able to see the Taj and be in the garden and enjoy nature at the same time and be able to grasp just how magical Agra is...
6,We arrived here in the evening before the sun set.  View Taj Mahal across this garden  So imprinted,Seeing the Taj Mahal from here was so amazing as you can see the truth symmetry. Parts of the garden are maintained but the original site is kept as is.  Very peaceful.
7,You can get the better view for free,To see the Taj Mahal from this side is simple amazing. It feels special like the Taj Mahal is yours for a moment. Only yours and no-one else around.
8,Only reason to visit for views of the Taj--else just an empty park,Most people flock to this place at sunset-time to watch the Taj Mahal change color in the golden light. The view from here is stunning.
9,Relaxing tranquil view of the Taj,Really great to see the Taj Mahal from the other side of the river. Somehow more 'intimate' and the site of the never completed 'Black Taj Mahal' which was to be his mausoleum. What a site that would have been!
10,Fab view of Taj Mahal,This wonderful garden in a peaceful location is an excellent place to see the Taj Mahal from the back across the Yamuna river.  You get great views of the Taj but there is now way to get to the river to get any reflections ... unfortunately.
11,Pictures of the Taj without people,Well worth visiting to get a different view of the Taj Mahal in a more relaxed atmosphere. Recommend going for sunrise or sunset.
12,A hidden gem,"By itself, this garden is not worth the entrance fee. However, for a view of the Taj Mahal and a place to sit and relax while enjoying the majesty of the place it was worth it for me.You can see the view of the Taj from outside the garden but it is not the same and it can get crowded plus there is no where to sit and relax. We went at sunset and it was very peaceful. It also made us happy that we went to see the Taj Mahal in the morning as the que in the afternoon was absolutely ridiculous. It seemed to be moving quickly though.One thing to note about this garden is that you cannot take any food inside. Not even a mint as they are afraid that you will litter."
13,Got to see the sunset view,A lesser known spot to quietly contemplate the majestic site of the Taj Mahal. Follow the road past the fort and find a haven of peace away from the trippers and hustlers.It is almost the extended gardens but across the other side of the river which depending on the season can give a different perspective.
14,Unfinished Taj,"We came here at sunset to see the other side of the Taj Mahal, from across the river. The gardens are just ok but the sight more than makes up for them. Well worth a visit."
15,Taj View - Mehtab Bagh,"Away from the heavily crwded Taj and Fort, this provides an alternate Taj viewing location from across the river"
16,The garden is ,Great photo of the Taj Mahal at sunset. One can get a panoramic view from the great gate to the mosque. Great side view of the Taj Mahal too especially at sunset.
17,Skip this place if you came to see the Taj,Metab Bagh is the perfect location to see the Taj Mahal at sunset on a Friday (when the Taj is closed). I didn’t know about this location until my guide brought me and I’m so glad I trusted him! It was great to see the Taj from afar and prepare myself to really see it and take it all in the following morning.
18,"Just use the view point next to the garden, its cheaper and same view","The view point, from where you can see Taj Mahal on a straight axe, is closed due to restoration. The wall from where you can get to that axe as well is closed with the fence (which makes nonsense, as you can walk from both sides of the fence on the same wall. No announcement is given."
19,Good view of Tajmahal in evening ,This just provided a view of the Taj from across the river Yamuna.There is really nothing else here apart from the view.
20,Garden view of back of Taj,"If you’d love the best view to watch Taj Mahal during sunset, this is the place. From my hotel (Atulyaa Taj Hotel) I had to take auto around INR40. The journey was about 15-20 mins because it is located at the opposite of Taj separated by Yamuna river. It depends on the traffic as well. The view was magnificent. Taj Mahal is a magical artifact. The building gets bigger when you are farer from it and it gets smaller when you are nearer to it. This cannot be captured by your camera. You have to witness it with your eyes. At least this is what I saw."
21,What could have been....,Beautiful gardens provide an incredible view - stunning first full-on view of the Taj Mahal.  So peaceful despite throngs of people.
22,Great place to photograph the Taj,"Translating to moonlight garden, Mehtab Bagh is the perfect spot for admiring the beauty of the Taj Mahal. Built by Babur, it is a square garden that was once resplendent with pools, fountains and trees. Today, it makes for a recreational tourist spot. A Mughal garden, it is perfectly aligned with the Taj Mahal along the Yamuna River and was described by Shah Jahan as the ideal spot for viewing the Taj Mahal.Due to frequent floods and extraction of building material by the villagers, the garden lay in ruins by the ‘90s. However, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) intervened and started work to restore the garden to its original state. They even made sure that the plants used in Mehtab Bagh were ones that were originally a part of Mughal gardens. These included guava, Ashoka, jamun, neem, hibiscus, etc. There were four sandstone towers too in the garden at its four corners, however, only one remains now. During the restoration, other structures were added to Mehtab Bagh that were not originally a part of it. Some of these include a statue of BR Ambedkar holding the constitution of India, a temple and nurseries. Visit Mehtab Bagh between 6 am to 7 pm, it is open on all days of the week."
23,Mehtab Bagh Taj View Point is Nice,"This garden provides a view of the back of the Taj Mahal. Nothing fancy, just another normal garden. Can be given a miss.Entry Fees-30 Rs.(Indian)"
24,Too Big and not maintained,This place is a must visit for some perfect photography with Taj Mahal.The view is simply spectacular.
25,Historical monument moon garden,This garden lies behind the Taj Mahal and even though there is a reasonable view of the Taj from the back side the garden itself is unimpressive.  The only interesting thing to see here is the foundations for the making of the Black Taj that never eventuated.
26,Agonizing and mesmerizing,Great views on a clear day of the Taj Mahal.Peaceful to visit - just what you need in Agra.  No hassle just a couple of kids outside asking you to buy something or take a camel ride. Entrance fee currently 200 IRP for foreigners.
27,Not worth too long,A nice quiet place to come and get a different view of the Taj Mahal from over the river. Would recommend getting here a bit before sunset to get a better view as it got busier later.
28,offers a view of Taj Mahal much better than Taj Mahal visit itself!,"That’s no other place in the city with better view of Taj Mahal than from the Mehtab Bagh garden, on the other side of the river, in the sunset, you can see the Taj all orange and get some different perspectives for photography! Amazing place, even you can find some indian ladies gardening with the Taj Mahal in the back!"
29,A different perspective,"is an alternative place to enjoy the beauty of the Taj Mahal from the other side. We can enjoy the beauty of the Taj Mahal from the edge of the Yamuna river. although the river is not drained, the bird's activities provide an amazing view especially when the sun sets. Entrance tickets are also subject to cameras and camera tripods are prohibited"
30,I like to see the Taj from Mehtab Bagh.,Just a lovely alternative place to see Taj Mahal especially at sunset.  Really nice to see both sides
31,Gardens on other side of river from Taj Mahal,It's a nicely done garden where you can wait to have the evening view of the Taj Mahal... Its mesmerizing to see the Taj from the riverside... You can wait in the garden and enjoy nature and scenery while waiting for the sunset.. .Though you would like to reach here a bit early and grab a place to sit as it gets very crowded in the evening...
32,Taj view point,From here you can only see the Taj Mahal and the river. Nothing else to be seen here as the things from the bases of the new tomb for the emperor don't say much.250 INR is just too much just to visit a piece of grass!
33,A place where one can get a wonderful view of the Taj Mahal,"Since we arrived in Agra on Friday, we headed here to get views of the Taj Mahal from across the river. I felt the entrance fee at 300R entrance fee for foreigners was a bit steep. It’s a shame the gardens haven’t been better kept as the original intent was to be a continuation of the Taj Mahal. I would recommend visiting in the morning. We went for sunset and the smog/fog was so thick from building throughout the day that our pictures didn’t really turn out."
34,Lovely views,Just visit the Taj Mahal. There is no added value to see the Taj Mahal from this park.. I am surprised that there are so many positive reviews...
35,Another view of Taj,You have to go and see the sunset view of the Taj Mahal.  Great photo spot and not that many people compared to the crowds at the Taj itself.
36,Mneh.,"Sunset at these gardens are the best place to view The Taj Mahal from.  Reasonably good value at Rupees 300, and if you pay by credit card then it's only Rupees 250.  Yes I agree with a number of other reviewers that the guards are very officious in insisting you leave promptly at sunset.  Actually it felt they were demanding we leave earlier.  Surely they could allow say 15-20 mins after sunset to enjoy the changing light?  Notably the guards did not seem to hurry the visitors out if The Taj itself on the other bank."
37,A different view from across Yamuna,The only reason to visit this location is for the spectacular view of the Taj across the river. Be prepared to climb a small stone wall to get the best pictures.
38,Taj from another angle...,mehtab bagh is the best place if you are keen to capture the best picture of Taj Mahal.the view is very clear from mehtab bagh
39,Watch Taj Mahal from the other side of the river,The view of the Taj Mahal from here is absolutely breath-taking. The lush greenery adds to the beauty of the TAJ! a must see and visit
40,Sadddd,"This park offers a  ""across the river"" view of the Taj that provides some perspective. It's also the only opportunity to see the ruins of the never-completed mausoleum that Shah Jahan had planned for himself."
41,Best view of Taj but cant watch full sunset,Try visiting this beautiful place. This is near to the Taj Mahal and gives you complete view of the monument without getting into the crowd.  Also if the monument is officially closed you can get to see it from here
42,Worth seeing if your staying overnight in Agra,The gardens are peaceful and relaxing and make a great backdrop to the Taj Mahal. But the visit would clearly come into its own with the river up and the classic reflection shot available. We shall return!
43,"3 for the place, 5 for the view","The gardens are nothing to remember but the view on the Taj from this side of the river  is worth the small detour, especially if you have your own mean of transportation as you can’t really go there easily. Given that they ask for an entrance fee, they could finish the small platform over the river....  but this is apparently not condidered a priority. Strange. In summary, not essential but nice to do if you have the time"
44,Nothing Special,"If it's Friday and Taj Mahal is closed, this garden offers a great view of the Taj. People come here to take photos during sunset. We came during summer."
45,Mehtab View to Salute Taj...,"A place from where one can see the beauty of Taj , specifically the Sun Set. If one interested in phography, this is the place for clicking Taj. Also can see old foundation for proposed Black Taj."
46,Don't bother,"You can take some excellent creative photos of the Taj from here as its much quieter, and you have space and time to do your thing. The actual gardens, however, aren't much."
47,Mahtab bag,These are gardens from where you can look across the river to the Taj Mahal. They are not crowded and offer an unrestricted vista from the other side from where people usually see the Taj.
48,Peaceful and rest place,This is an ok garden but the views of the Taj across the river are brilliant.  We arrived late afternoon and waited for the sunset which many other visited also did.  You need to get there early enough to get a good position as it gets crowded but definitely worth the wait.
49,Great views of the Taj,"This back side view of Taj Mahal is very very peaceful , full of greenery and a broader view across Yamuna."
50,Surprising,"We visited here after seeing the Taj Mahal and Amber Fort. We did get great views of the Taj Mahal from the river side, but it’s not totally necessary to visit here, as the views from the Taj Mahal site are much better. However, it was a nice way to finish our trip. You don’t need to spend a long time here."
51,Four sections of the garden & view of Taj,"Although the garden itself is nothing special, it is pleasant and peaceful in the late afternoon and presents a lovely view of the Taj from across the Yamuna River. We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and the families also relaxing in the garden which provides a large open space with trees and birds in a crowded city."
52,Perfect for sunset ,Visited here on our trip to Agra after already visiting the Taj Mahal in the early morning.   Set across the river from the Taj it gives you an alternative view of the building and without the massive crowds.  The garden itself was really quiet and peaceful when we visited and we enjoyed uninterrupted views of the rear of the Taj.  I think that the normal entrance fee for foreigners is about 400 rupees but as we visited on World Heritage Day it was free to get in.  I would have happily have paid tho.
53,Good to see a different view,"Great view of the Taj from the rear, and of the river and wildlife. Good preparation for the dawn visit the day after."
54,Even at this public place they try to rip you off.,No doubt it's a beautiful place to watch Taj Mahal in sunset.. but that's the only thing is great about it.
55,More hyped ,We had visited the Taj Mahal on thursday but then wanted to come here on Friday to see the outline of it and alternative view and it is worth doing. It is a lovely garden too and peaceful as well.
56,Great view of the north side of the Taj,Experience the Taj from across the Yamuna for some stunning views of the Taj - we visited between 2-4 pm in February.
57,Beautiful sunset ,Other than the view of the Taj there's no good reason to visit this place.  Most people come an hour before sunset to watch the Taj and its translucent marble bathe in the golden light.It's a phenomenal view and if you're fortunate enough to be in Agra during monsoon and the water level in the river is high you will be treated to a full on reflection of the Taj in the river as the architects planned.
58,Another view of the Taj Mahal,"This place is situated opposite the Taj Mahal, across the river. It offers a stunning view of the Taj Mahal and is less crowded so you can enjoy the views more. You would need to get a driver to take you and you have to pay 200 rps entrance but is well worth the view."
59,Great place to hang with your friends and family.,Have to pay 300 rupis to see the same of what you see in the view point just next to the garden for 200 rupis. In the moment of sunset the security man came to tell us to leave the garden...
60,Disappointing visit ,"To get the sunset with the Taj Mahal, the Mehtab Bagh is not the ideal place, as it does close before the sunset.Beside the park there is also some place, but the get easy yelled at by park rangers, as they don't like that you get the view for free. But the view is breath taking from Mehtab Bagh."
61,Not worth a visit,This is the perfect place to visit to see the Taj Mahal in all its beauty!  Great place to take pjotos
62,Best view of the Taj Mahal,This is what you do at sunset on day before you visit the Taj. See it from across the river. Well recommended. Get there around 4.30-5pm. It costs 200 rupees to enter. Great views of Taj Mahal
63,Great way to experience Taj Mahal,"This is the rear view of the taj garden is across the river yamuna , some excavation sites along with a garden with lovely flowers . If you want to take pictures without having people walking into your frame it is advisable to come at dusk or dawn to get some mesmerizing views of the Taj Mahal with reflected sunlight splitting into the visual spectrum. This was the place where Yanni's music concert was held with the Taj lit in the backdrop during the night. Definitely worth a visit as this place makes you realize the massiveness and beauty of this monument remains flawless and unchanged from every angle. Mind you all these pics have been taken from an iphone 7 only not any professional or DSLR camera"
64,Small but worth visiting nevertheless,Went here to just see the backside of the Taj Mahal.  If you like to take pictures this is a great place as the view of the Taj is stunning.  Would recommend to just see the backside of the Taj Mahal.
65,Mehtab Bagh,"Our guide took us to the garden to get views across the river to the Taj Maha. As the sun was going down, it became increasingly misty so we decided not to bother staying for sunset.The other issue was the biting insects as you were close to the river so make sure you put on insect repellent."
66,Overpriced for just a view on the Taj Mahal,"Mehtab Bagh has its own ambiance of visiting the place. You sit down at the shore and watch Taj from the bank. In night, if you visit the place, you will see a huge shadow of Taj, which has its own beauty."
67,Simply amazing views of the Taj Mahal in relaxing gardens,"Moon Garden is the best place to spend the evening time behind the Taj Mahal. You can use your professional camera to take some exotic pictures of the setting sun in the evening time. It has enough space for the various kind of photographs that you want to take of the Taj Mahal. Specially when the river is flowing with full of water ,it  just increases the beauty of the enchanting Taj Mahal which looks as if there are some sprinkles of love in the water flowing behind the Taj MahalSitting around the corner of the Mehtab Bagh and enjoying the Taj Mahal is just another way of life.It is a must recommended place if you have enough time in the evening to spend other than monuments feel.Thanks"
68,Da Vinci Code Of India...!!! Lost Glory to undo the secret behind the construction of Taj Mahal!!!,Not that good. Can visit to see the real front view of the Taj from the other side of river Yamuna. It's very far and isolated.
69,It's alright,"If Taj Mahal is closed (Friday) this park is the best spot to still get the closest picture of this wonder.Despite this point and some gardens, there is no much to be seen.Black Taj Mahal's remains are in bad shape: few circles of stones facing the White Taj Mahal on the other side of the river bank."
70,Great views of The Taj from across the river,At sunset Taj Mahal seems a dream from the Yamuna river and the gardens. So peaceful despite many people we did not feel it crowdy as it was a large area
71,Mehtab Bagh,Most people miss out on this as its very far away from the Taj Mahal. It's on the opposite side of the river Yamuna and was built as a part of the Taj Mahal to complete the paradisical complex It has a fantastic view of the Taj Mahal and probably that is what it was used for. Most of its buildings have been destroyed over the years ND a garden has been planted in its place.If you love photography don't miss it.
72,"Rip off danger, unpleasant guards, Nice garden",This is a popular garden to view the Taj Mahal at sunset. You can get great pictures however the park closes at sunset and so you are likely to be ushered out before the pink glow of the sunset strikes the Taj
73,One of the best views of Taj Mahal,"First sights of Taj around sunset are spell-binding, especially if you are seeing the Taj for the first time.To catch the sun and the Taj for photos, i found it better to head to the left side once near the river bank."
74,Amazing Garden 🤗,"Of course one need to visit Taj Mahal and check out its incredible stonework and inlays. However, once you are done with it and want to get away from the massive crowds that get into every photo of Taj Mahal you take, I would highly recommend to go across the river to the Mehtab Bagh garden. It provides a great viewing point of Taj Mahal with beautiful flowers, trees and manicured lawns in the foreground. A short walk will take you to the brick wall at the back of the garden where you can enjoy unobstructed views of the entireTaj Mahal complex including the mosque and the guest house."
75,Well worth a visit,"From what the guide told me, someday the government will build a viewing platform for the Taj here.  When they do, this will be a must-see stop.  However, until then it's really nothing more than a grove of trees with a decent view.  Don't get your hopes up.  Supposedly this is where they were going to build Shah Jahan's tomb--an equal to the Taj across the river.  However that never happened.  Instead it's a park area and not nearly as well tended as the gardens of the Taj or Agra Fort."
76,Nice place to view Sunset at Taj,"We went here to view the Taj Mahal as soon as we arrived in Agra, in the late afternoon. It was a beautiful spot to view the Taj Mahal from a distance, and a lovely first viewing of it. The place has an interesting history as well"
77,Hors D'oeuvres Taj - sunset view,This is an earlier building whose design later inspire the Taj Mahal. Whilst smaller the artwork is just as good and the gardens a delight. Each side is a gate but one that goes nowhere.
78,Mehtab Bagh,It is such a wonderful and beautiful place to see the Taj Mahal. This is just on the other side of the river. It is just very peaceful and the best time is to go at the time of sunsets.
79,Another part of Taj Mahal,"The gardens are a great viewing spot for the Taj, and is a very tranquil setting to spend a couple of hours in. It does start to get busier around sunset, but the views of the Taj are great whatever time of day you go. Well worth a trip."
80,Best for views,We visited the Mehtab Bagh for a preview of the Taj Mahal (which we had scheduled for the following day). We had a good view of the Taj from a distance.
81,Not What I'd Hoped For,"A scenic view of the Taj. No crowd. Just the river Yamuna flowing. Early morning visit is a beautiful experience ! Since I had already visited Taj several times, I decided to skip it this time and catch a glimpse of Taj elsewhere. Mehtab Bagh was definitely a smart choice !"
82,Great place to view the Taj,We went there in the evening and got a nice view of the Taj at sunset. Nice history behind the place too and take a guide along to explain it to you.
83,A place to visit in evening,"After seeing the Taj at sunrise, i wouldn’t waste time here. Although it’s lovely to see the Taj always, this is not a unique viewpoint...you will have much better photos from you visit to the Taj itself and it’s not worth the time or extra rupees although cheap. I do not recommend this. There’s so many rooftops in Agra to watch sunset from and this garden is not even a garden."
84,Not quite sunset,"Another relatively unfrequented place that provides a magical vantage point from which to view the Taj. We ended up going there twice - once on the first day before we saw the Taj, and once on the last before we left Agra, to solidify our memory."
85,Golden triangle tour - Agra,Perhaps not that great of a view unless the river is in its full glory and you must take a photo from the other side of the Yamuna river.
86,Beautiful view of Taj Mahal,Overpriced. For just a view on the Taj Mahal over the river you have to pay an entryfee of Inr 300 per person. The so called garden is 't worth the money. People only visite this garden for a distant glance at the famous tombe.
87,Good views,"Just an unremarkable park but directly opposite the Taj Mahal and just over the river. The day after visiting the Taj Mahal at dawn I came to Mehtab Bagh to watch the sun rise.A little perturbed by the 'security' at the gate as I was alone but I wasn't bothered by anyone and could sit and watch, and photograph sunrise in peace.Park is free to enter and I couldn't believe there weren't more people there (a half dozen at most), it does require an effort to get there but well worth it also need to consider the weather as most on the river can obstruct view of Taj Mahal but this only adds to the atmosphere."
88,Not as Good as Expected,"very disappointing.All this has is a view across the river at the Taj.  The gardens are well kept but very sparse, and they water by flooding - so expect to get wet!At 200 rupee's it's a rip off.Spend your money on going to the baby Taj instead, way better"
89,We Actually Wanted to Watch Sunset from Here,Try to go during sunset. The photos you will take of Taj Mahal would by magnificent. 200 INR for the entrance. Nothing to see or do except the view.
90,Mehtab... to No’tab ,"This garden is a bit under reconstruction, which aims to mirror Taj Mahal across the river, as it used to do in ancient times. We walked through the yards here and took some marvellous pictures of the flowers and the Taj itself. Nice place to unwind."
91,Great place in lovely area,This is a wonderful place to visit in the evening. Go at about 4pm to view the Black mausoleum and see the Taj Mahal at sunset when it changes to a pink hue. The gardens are great with an orchard and well worth looking about. There is a long wall where you sit and view the Taj Mahal. You can also view the remains of the early mausoleum. Good bird life and see bullocks being led to the river Yamon. Pretty expensive for what it is as a foreigner. Cheap for Indians.
92,An alternative place to enjoy Taj Mahal,"We probably loved this place more than the Taj Mahal itself, mainly because when we were there, there’s no one else, we had the whole grounds to ourselves. The environment was very relaxed, we took our time taking pictures, walked between the rows of trees and flowers."
93,Only worthwhile if you can see the Taj,You get nice views of the Taj Mahal but it’s a joke that the westerners get charged 10x more than the locals for entry
94,Uncrowded garden with views of the Taj Mahal,"According to our guide, this was the site where the Emperor planned to build a matching black Taj as his own tomb, complementing the white Taj built for is wife.  He never got to build it.  The site is a garden area (not very ornate by Western standards), just across the river from the Taj Mahal.  Worth a visit but you will not need to stay long unless you simply want to relax in the gardens."
95,See the Taj from across the Yamuna River,"Go for the garden, stay for the view. This is the spot where Shah Jahan wanted to build a Black Taj Mahal, as his own mausoleum. Now it has been converted to a garden with a low priced ticket, go just before the sunset to get stunning views of the Taj."
96,Overpriced!,"Unfortunately, you can no longer go on boats at sunrise/sunset to see the Taj but this park does have a great view of the Taj from across the river. Most of the property is now fenced off, so you can't walk along the river... Still worth a visit though."
97,Shame turned into all about $$,Not really worth paying the entrance. Unless you have not yet seen the Taj Mahal and then you are able to see it from a distance.
98,If you don’t have time don’t bother!,"We were told there were beautiful gardens and you got fantastic sunset views of the Taj Mahal. The gardens were mainly rose gardens that were without a single flower. There were a few flower beds with flowers but most were empty. Unfortunately it was overcast and we didn't even get a sunset! You do get some beautiful views of the backside of the Taj Mahal. Perhaps in a different season, with roses blooming, and on a clear day, this would be a far better experience. I would not consider this a must see if I had only limited time."
99,Great for photos of Taj Mahal without all the people,It is a good place to take nice pics with Taj in the background.  It can be well maintained but didn't do it properly.
100,Taj Viewpoint,"These are lovely gardens which provide a view across the Yamuna river to the Taj Mahal. It's especially popular as sunset approaches and the superb marble becomes almost translucent as the low sun glows on it. If it's a clear day, which it was for us, it's a wonderful sight. The gardens themselves are enjoyable to walk around as well and are very popular for wedding photos."
101,Great spot for taking photos of the Taj from a distance,"First visit, the Taj Mahal was invisible due to dense fog which took about ½ an hour to clear to the point where we could see an outline. Fog stayed with us for 2 solid days - be aware this can happen... On the way there, from town, there are some sports fields, loads of groups practising mainly cricket. Nice to stop there for some great views of the Taj Mahal as well..."
102,Taj from across the Yamuna,This is the place to go for the best view of the Taj Mahal.  It is not crowded either and is much cheaper.  However you cant actually get to the main building from here to appreciate it close up.
103,OK but so many better things to do in and around Agra,"This dirty, run down park/garden has a nice view of the ""back"" side of the Taj but the hype about sunset is silly. They herded us out of there before the sun actually set, and anyway it was April, the sun was NOT setting anywhere near the building."
104,Taj view justified ,"The gardens themselves are nothing special but 100% worth it for the amazing view of the Taj. Now costs 300 rupees for foreigners (250 if you get online ticket). Make sure you arrive in plenty of time for sunset (around 4pm) to get a front row seat on the wall and the best photos. You can’t watch the full sunset as the gardens close at 5pm and the guards come round and kick you out, but still worth it nonetheless."
105,Meh,"Went here the night before we went to see the Taj Mahal just to get our fist glimpses of it. What views we got and really whetted our appetite for going the next day.The gardens themselves were pretty spectacular and all in all can highly recommend an hour or so here prior to visiting the Taj Mahal, if you have time..."
106,Kind of expensive just to see the views ,"We visited these rose gardens late in the afternoon to view the Taj and maybe to enjoy a sunset. I was very disappointed that the official ticket booth tried to steal from me, giving me incorrect change from 2000 rupees. I’ve come to expect tuk tuk drivers all trying it on, but not an official booth! Luckily I noticed, stood my ground until the man begrudgingly gave me the rest of my change. There were quite a few people taking photos, but not crowded. As soon as the sun got low, 2 security guards armed with sticks began waving the sticks and telling everyone to leave. One guard also remonstrated with a western lad because he saw a tripod in the bag and for some reason they have a no tripod rule. In summary some nice views but the unpleasantness of the staff left a sour taste. Underwhelming."
107,Lovely end to the day,"Worth a visit any time of day for the spectacular views of the Taj Mahal as well as a quiet walk in calm gardens with very few people to bother you. Described as the ""Backsid"" of the Taj Mahal, the gardens are said to contain the foundations of the planned Black Taj Mahal Intended to be the mausoleum for Shah Jahan, creator of the white Taj Mahal for his wife, the black Taj Mahal never made it much past the foundation state it is in now due to Shah Jahan being overthrown and imprisoned by his evil son Aurangzeb. We went on a grey but warm day with occasional flurries of rain but it filled us with wonder again after spending yesterday on the other side of the river at the white Taj Mahal. If you want to visit but hate crowds go to the ""Backside"" of the Taj Mahal! If you get there early morning or late afternoon for sunrise or sunset it is said to be even more spectacular."
108,Good view of Taj but just scrubland of a garden,"Offers good views of the Taj Mahal, but there isn’t much to do here. Recommend going here in the evening. Tip - sale of tickets stops 30 minutes before sunset. And this varies based on whether it’s summer or winters so be careful of the timings."
109,Just a garden,"Spent 1.5 hrs for the sunset.  It's very relaxing and a great viewpoint for the Taj Mahal.  This is a location where supposedly the ""black"" Taj Mahal twin be built, but it was never done."
110,OK gardens - but with a pretty good view!,This was going to be another Taj Mahal for the King to look across the river to his wife. However they only got as far as the grounds and foundations. Great view of the Taj Mahal and the river. Nice grounds and a walk.  Worth a visit.
111,Great At Sunset,It's a garden to see the sunsentvview of tajmahal from the opposite bank of jamuna river. The entry charge is 25 that is not at all worth. The staff of the ticket counter is very rude. And the garden is needed maintenance.
112,Can’t take tripod can’t take drone ,Fantastic view of the Taj. Reaching here is slightly a challenge. Normally this a place to be visited during sun set. That gives a good orange colour shade of sun on the Taj. Take a cab on return basis or book the cab (Ola)  immediately after sun set as very few cabs in this area.
113,Escape exorbitant taj Mahal entry fees,"This park on the bank of Yamuna facing the Taj Mahal is a great place to get full view of Taj Mahal and it’s adjoining Jama Masjid and Royal guest house. Park has a view point , a bench for sitting and getting a picture of Tajmahal in back drop. River Yamuna separates the two places and it’s best to visit this place in evening to get sunset pictures. Park entry fee is 25 ₹ only"
114,Black Taj,This was the perfect place to end a perfect day and wait for the sun to go down.  The Taj Mahal is seen in varying shades of light and this enhances its beauty.
115,See the Taj without the crowds,My first time here - worth driving to the other side of the river to see Taj - by sunset. However repair works going on and hence the gardens are not in their full glory. Possibly Spring ( in a month or two) will be better.
116,Great views of the Taj Mahal,These gardens/park are located on the opposite bank to the Taj Mahal and apparently where a similar tomb to the Taj was to be built for Shah Jahan himself. The ruins/foundations to this structure still remain. This is a popular place to view the Taj Mahal during sunset as the white structure should turn a pink hue. Unfortunately when we visited it was too cloudy and dusty so a bit of a non event. This did not however detract from viewing the impressive Taj Mahal. Worth a visit and cheap to gain entry. Can get busy and parking can be an issue so best to arrive early.
117,A mini Taj,Interesting discovering what happened to the black Taj.  Beautiful site with lovely gardens.Also offers another opportunity to view the Taj
118,Great place to view the Taj,It is the ausome place♥️♥️the place from where to see clearly Taj Mahal 🕌🕌 if you want to take photo with Taj Mahal then when to this place because it's the best place to take photo with Taj Mahal 🕌 🕌
119,Great...,"This is where Shah Jahan intended to build his own mausoleum, a black version, right opposite that of his beloved wife Mumtaz, the Taj Mahal. The jury's out if he ever began work because his son locked him up for the rest of his 44 years to stop him spending so much money. Also, he's said to have blinded and removed the hands of the Taj workmen so they might never make anything so beautiful again. The gardens were part of a far larger number around Agra and had fallen into disrepair, the fine sand blowing across the Yamuna wasn't doing the Taj any favours, so it's been replanted and although it's not what a European would call a garden, it is a nice green space."
120,Taj peek window,I am happy that this venue is now open to the public.It offers one of the most brilliant view of the Taj esp during the sunset.The gardens are good but they need to be improved further.It is not at all crowded .
121,Another chance to see the Taj Mahal,Nice garden with one of the best views of the Taj Mahal. This is where the mysterious Black Taj Mahal should have been built.
122,beautifull,These gardens are the place to be to see the Taj in evening. The Taj across the river seems to become the setting sunlight and people flock here as the sun goes down the number of people here go up. You have to pay to get in but it is worth it. There were some ladies working in the gardens who let me take their picture once we had agreed on the price. It is quite a delightful place to be come an evening in Agra. The light is magical as you can see from an unfiltered photo
123,Nice views of Taj from here ,The place offers a great view of the  taj mahal... I love the place ... Several flowers of different species
124,Great to see the Taj from across the river,"These gardens mark the area where - had it been built - another Taj would have been sited, but in black marble. This did not happen of course, but the gardens do provide the opportunity to view the Taj Mahal from across the river. Best time to visit is for sunset, when you might get the opportunity to to see the Taj bathed in colour. Unfortunately, when we visited we were unlucky as the weather prevented a real sunset, however it was pleasant enough and gave us a chance to photograph the river-scape. Also got some good photos of the Taj from a different angle to the standard ones usually seen.As others have commented, this monument like many we visited in India, is not well maintained with a lot of rubbish strewn about and it closes too early to be able to get full benefit of the sunset, it is still worth a visit though."
125,Family and friends ,"It is pretty far from the city.Happened to have a sandstorm that day, and view of taj mahal was blur.Attraction itself has limited offering, except for the taj mahal view"
126,Taj Mahal from another perspective,It's a quaint place built into a park with a nominal fee and an excellent view of the Taj Mahal from across the River Yamuna. Would suggest going here very early in the morning so that you can see the first rays of the sun fall on the Taj.
127,Stunning Views of the Taj Mahal,"This is a Garden in the other side of the river of Taj Mahal.The view of the Taj Mahal is beautiful and it's not busy, so good for photos."
128,Photo with Taj Mahal,"Our guide took us here the day after visiting the Taj Mahal proper. It was a Friday so the Taj Mahal was closed, good photos without all the people!"
129,Ms Monica feldman,"The quintessential quip about the Taj Mahal - it dons different hues through the day - made me get up early in the morning and trudge off with my camera to take some good pics of this wonder of world. Earlier couple of visits to the Taj were quite memorable, but at that time, we could not get the opportunity of going across the Yamuna and take pictures of the Taj. So this trip, it being a Friday (entry to the Taj being closed) - I decided to use it to make a trip to Mehtab Bagh.The trip was an average one - 3 stars only. But given that it is the Taj - I am still tempted to give one more and therefore the very good rating. The early November morning fog and smog should not be something that clouds my rating, although it did cloud visibility very drastically."
130,See Taj from another angle which is equally interesting,Visited this garden which has great views of the Taj from across the river. I interesting as well to see the foundations of the unfinished Black Taj. Well worth the trip.
131,Garden\Park with views across the Yamuna to the Taj Mahal - the money shot is from the fountain.,The garden was not very well kept. But yes the backdrop of Taj was fabulous. The best part it is not crowded so you can get good pictures without the crowd
132,Loved it....,"Great views of back of Taj Mahal from black mahal which was going to be built as counterpoint. Park, not very exciting but hood opportunity to ser birds in river & an alternative view of Taj"
133,Scenic place,Lovely to visit prior to getting up close to the Taj in the morning. Gardens are lovely and its so nice to see the sunset in the relative quiet (although busy with tourists). Well worth a visit.
134,Closed view point,"During our holidays in Agra, we had visited this beautiful well maintained Mughal garden located on the banks of river Yamuna with the grand Taj Mahal located across the river. We had visited Taj Mahal in the morning and came here before sunset to admire the beauty of Taj from the opposite side. The garden has lots of trees and criss crossed by walkways and canals. We sat in the garden for more than an hour and enjoyed the mesmerizing view of the wonder called Taj Mahal. This garden is open from 6 am to 6 pm and Entrance tickets are priced at 25 Rupees for Indians and 300 Rupees for foreigners."
135,Must Visit Place - Best View of Taj across the river,"Nice distant views of Taj Mahal . Great photo opportunities. However must visit Taj mahal . We visited in summer , so it was very hot. Best time to travel would be in Dec . It was raining and the gardens were flooded."
136,A late in the day visit is rewarding,The day before visiting the Taj at dawn we went to the Mehtab Bagh.  The view across the river is stunning and the setting sun really shows off the Taj at its best.  Lots of bird life to be seen on the river and in the gardens.
137,A view of Taj from across the Yamuna.,"The only place where you can see the whole Taj, take pictures and have nobody in your way. A quiet place with nice birds, some squirrels and trees and flowers but the main attraction is of course the best view of the Taj you can have."
138,Big garden middle of agra,"Average garden with steep entry fee. Great view of Taj from across the river. Can really appreciate the symmetry from her. Can get busy. Would only be an add on, not a main attraction."
139,Just go for the view of the Taj,The great place to c the Raj and admire it's beauty is this baag . I enjoyed spending a lot of time here
140,So beautiful,"After going to the Taj Mahal for sunrise I came here to see it at sunset, alas there was some cloud cover so I never got to see it lit up red by the sunset. But it was still a really nice view of it without the crowds.The gardens are quite pleasant but not amazing. They were nice and peaceful escaping the noise of India and its car horns was nice. Until the hundreds of birds there started singing, but that was quite beautiful.I got to it from Agra and back via tuk-tuk, which isn't for the faint-hearted - a bit like being in a computer game but quite fun. This cost about 500 rupees (£5) including getting the driver to wait for 1h for me there."
141,Taj view,"If you go to Mehtab Bagh which is also known as the Moonlight Gardens, you will get a view of the Taj Mahal from a different angle without the huge crowds.   The gardens also have an interesting history.   Well worth the visit."
142,Lovely view of the Taj,"Located on the opposite side of the river, Mehtab Bagh or Moonight Garden is an ideal place to see the sunset at the Taj Mahal. There are also architectural ruins of a building originally designed to complement the Taj Mahal, but was never completed. The gardens themselves aren’t especially interesting."
143,Great view - scruffy park.,This place is great to see the Taj at Sunset. Be aware to check the time of Sunset because the entrance closes about 1h prior to. It is not crowded and does offer great views. Best time to go is after the rainy season as the Taj then reflect into the river along with the sunset. Obviously we went during the dry season ie grass instead of reflection
144,A photographers paradise for taking pictures of Taj Mahal,"It is simply superb. With Taj in background,it looks magnificent- nicely maintained, kept clean, it steals the hearts of visitors."
145,View of Taj,Gives a nice view of Taj mahal from other side. Picturesque. Prominent for Sun set and Moonlight views. There was also a story that Shahjahan tried to build Black Taj Mahal after completion of the Taj and was over thrown by his son Aurangzeb. The remains of the structures can be seen in the moon garden. This site needs maintenance and bit of security.
146,Mehtab bagh,These are situated by the side of the Yamuna river opposite the Taj Mahal. The gardens are (alleged to be ?) where the Black Taj Mahal would have been built. They are a place to view the Taj Mahal from another angle and at another time of day ( in our case sunset ). You will be pestered by young men wanting to be your guide - we succumbed and for a tip got some good (and trick) photos taken of us. The entry fee is 300 rupees per person. Like the Taj Mahal they do not allow you take battery chargers in. It was another lovely view of the Taj Mahal and a pleasant place to walk for a while.
147,Views of the Taj Mahal,"There are many people who have gone to the Taj Mahal but do not know about Mehtab, so I want to tell you what Mehtab Bagh is.  Mehtab Bagh, the lush green area before the Taj Mahal, where many trees stand, is called the entire place.  A different view of the Taj Mahal is seen from Mehtab Bagh.  Sadly, Mehtab Bagh is not as beautiful as before but still retains its beauty."
148,Taj Mahal at sunset!,"Attractive parkland with interesting trees, foundations of a never built palace and great views across the river to the Taj Mahal"
149,Visit to Mehtab Bagh,Upon arrival in Agra our tour guide took us on a precursor tour to the beautiful Mehtab Bagh for a view of the Taj Mahal at sunset across the river. Mehtab Bagh lies north of the Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort on the opposite side of the Yamuna River. The beautiful garden complex is perfectly aligned with the Taj Mahal on the opposite bank of the river. A stunning place for photos.
150,Great place to get a good alternative view of the Taj Mahal,The mehtab bagh is a 25 acre garden that is located in front of the Taj Mahal.The ticket price is $200 ruppes which is around 3 usd the place is small but you can see a different view of the Taj Mahal a non crowded place. It is said that this place was build before the Taj Mahal but it was never finished.Definitely it is a very good tourist spot if you have enough time while in Agra it's a good place to see the Taj Mahal.
151,Excellent view point to see Taj at Sunset,A quite place just behind The Taj Mahal. This place is full of trees and flowers making it more beautiful.One can see back side of The Taj from here. But the view is very good.A must visit.
152,Best & serene place to have that first view of the Taj!,"Far from the crowd, amazing view of the Taj. I would say even better than the other side and definitely more peaceful... If you need to take one picture take it there"
153,Some very good views but weather dependent,"The Garden is not maintained at all, the only reson to visit this place would be to view the Taj Mahal from another side across the river from the garden.there is nothing much to explore in the gardenthe garden gets closed by 6 pm"
154,Not worth to go there,"If you wana have a look of the beautiful taj in not a crowded area, visit this place in the moderate winters. It feel like visiting a hill station with a beautiful view of taj"
155,"An interesting ""tease"" before visiting the Taj Mahal","Not to be missed at all. Make sure you visit Mehtab Bagh at sunrise to have that serene view of the Taj. Especially the first time you come in direct line of sight with massive monument, its so surreal! No crowd here, so you'll have that silent morning taking in the view of the Taj, with river Yamuna at the forefront."
156,Peaceful place for alternative view of Taj Mahal ,The only nice thing about this place is a hazy picture across the Taj. The price is 300 IR for foreigners. Security at the gate are very rude. They wouldn't let us bring in a cold drink that we bought at the gate. But they let Indians carry in water bottles and they just throw the bottles in the garden. When we left we picked up 10 empty bottles and left them with security. The policy seems to be take the foreigners for as much money as possible. They have no respect for us and little respect for their own country. Don't waste your money here!
157,Romanticism and the allure of the Taj,This was a peaceful walk in the park amongst the trees just before sunset. Saw women balancing and carrying bowls of hand mixed cement on their heads for restoration work in the area. Saw ladies with baskets on their heads who had just finished weeding the park in their colourful sari's. Children and families were enjoying picnics in the park. It was nice to enjoy the serenity of the park rather than the streets of Agra.
158,Stunning Free View of Taj Mahal at Dawn,"It's a very good place to see the Taj Mahal but you have to pay 300Rs. Would be better if they take care of it. Apparently, was an amazing garden until some Indian people start to take part of the ruins to build other things. Looks like now they have started to plant new trees. Hopefully in a few years will look beutiful"
159,Nice views,"This is a garden area to the north of the Taj on the far banks of the Yamuna. It costs 300 INR to get in (kids free; 50 INR cheaper if you pay by card vice cash) and a couple of mins stroll takes you to the perimeter walls where you get great views (and photos) across the river to the Taj. We went toward the end of the day, saw sunset there, spent about 1.5 hours there and really enjoyed it. Plenty of stalls for drinks and hawkers for souvenirs outside."
160,Breathtaking,"Just a 20min tuk tuk ride from the city centre and you get to enjoy this stunning view of the taj mahal. The entrance fee to the gardens is 300 rupee. The garden itself is alright but the view over the river towards taj mahal is unbeatable, even the locals say that the taj mahal looks even better from distance.. must do when in agra for an incredible sunset view."
161,Taj from a different angle,A good place to view Taj from. Has a lot of good locations to click  your pics. Had visited Agra many times but view from this Garden is something different and for  sure is one to be cherished
162,Very nice,I visited this place in the month of August 2018 and its worth to visit As one can get beautiful pics of Taj  southern part near the bank of yamuna. Though solo women traveller must be careful as this place have less security guards around the park . This place is mostly recommended to young couples n photographers.Entry fee for Indian@20
163,Visit to Mehtab Bag,Beautiful garden. And does give you the view of the Taj as promised. There's some pieces of bricks ruining the view but easy to get over. Some benches around and good spots for picnicking.
164,Don't waste your money!!!,"Another view of the Taj, other than that very average, no real garden. I wouldn’t bother going if you don’t have a driver to get you there without much trouble or bargaining required!"
165,"Great view, soak up the sun","You can’t miss being in Mehtab bagh once you are inside Taj campus to visit Taj Mahal . I will place its parallel to how a perfectly shaped nose define beauty of a damsel , Mehtab bagh defines that beauty for Taj . Bagh looks much more beautiful with its splendid fountains"
166,Go only for the view of the Taj Mahal,"I hired a photographer during my trip to the Taj Mahal.  His name is Harsh with Harsh Agarwal photography based out of Agra. He informed me and my fiancée about Mehtab Bagh but he also knew of a few hidden spots that really captured the beauty of this place.  At first glance, it may not be a garden that satisfies the typical traveler BUT if you go with the right guide that really knows the area you can capture some extraordinary views.  I highly recommend visiting this garden but only with a very thorough guide or photographer!"
167,"נהדר ,יפה מאד Great, very beautiful","We went to see the Taj from over the river, as it was friday  and it was closed for prayers. The view was very good, and we were able to sit  by the river wall for photos with Taj behind us. The gardens were nice too, but not sure why you have to pay as there is nothing to see except the view. Lots of people there and  parking was difficult, so another day when Taj was open for visitors might reduce the crowds here."
168,Good view from across the river. Afternoon is good,Very dusty when we visited but another good viewpoint for Taj photos. Late afternoon was quiet for a wander through the gardens.
169,The Garden with the View ,"Reminded us of the gardens surrounding the Summer palace in St. Petersburg, but not quite as well groomed.The Taj Mahal makes a beautiful picture from this location on the opposite bank of the river."
170,Great views,"Great spot for viewing the Taj Mahal. Does not cost anything which is great on the pocket. Nice little park area with plenty of grass to picnic on. Heavy security presence so you feel secure. No bathrooms, so go before you get there.  Very busy at sunset. Highly recommend! We visited the evening before our Taj Mahal tour."
171,around June 2018,Very nice early morning walks in Mehtab Bagh - great place with awesome views of Taj Mahal - loved visting this Park and wonder what all it has seen in past few centuries!
172,bagh ,"The Mehtab Bagh is a hidden treasure. Located next to the Yamuna, it gives you a great view of the Taj without the crowds."
173,Excellent views of Taj Mahal from here,"This is a ""garden"" on the opposite side of the river from the Taj. It is not really a garden yet, as nothing is rally established yet. There is a fee of IR300 to enter, which is a rip-off.Although it was raining when we were there we had a very good view of the Taj. It is also the site of the so-called black Taj, which seems to be a bit of a myth."
174,Amazing ,"You should visit this place in evening, it was a beautiful view... It's worth visiting this area for a nice walk and to see the Taj Mahal from a different angle."
175,Nice place,We visited this area on the day the Taj was closed. It supposedly has the ruins of another Taj they where going to build on the otherside of the river. A very peaceful place to relax
176,Beautiful view of Taj at sunset,"The Bagh (garden) is unexciting and the only reason for visiting this place is the view of the Taj Mahal it offers from the other side of the Yamuna. However, the river is more like a putrid drain here and so the view of the Taj is very disappointing. Only if the river is full of water so that the Taj is reflected in the still waters of the river can a visit to this garden be worth the effort and journey."
177,Beautiful moonlight Garden ! ,"We took a Tuktuk to go from Taj Resort Hotel to go there. It is quite a long ride (20+ km) , because you have to cross the bridge. The ride was quite an adventure, if one likes the Indian traffic. A nice game is to estimate, how many people fit into one Tuktuk. The place itself is boring, dusty and if you’re lucky you see the Taj Mahal through the mist. The entrance fee of 300 per person is ridiculous."
178,Garden in the other side of the river.,"Mehtab Bagh literally means the moon garden . Situated on the opposite bank of the Taj Mahal , the classic Mughal “Char Bagh” garden was designed by Shah Jahan as a pleasure garden.... As a place from where to view the Taj Mahal on a full moon night  with the white monument reflecting on the clear waters of the river Yamuna , the smell of Jasmine and Kamini wafting through the air and the water channels and the marble fountains sprinkling rose water . That was the idea - a garden fit for the Gods in terms of aesthetics.  As of now the ASI and the world heritage monuments are trying to restore it . The gardens are pretty but much still needs to be done . What has not changed is the stunning view of the Taj Mahal from the “Moon Garden” . It still makes the jaw drop."
179,Sunset point to see tajmahal,Nice place for shooting as it's at the backside of Taj Mahal and shooting in Taj in not allowed. So overall it's simply nice.
180,Interesting view of the Taj Mahal,"The site where Shahjahan started his own masauleom - the black Taj.Bang opposite the Taj Mahal, this is the place from where the emperor used to view his creation.With some beautiful gardens, trees and set amongst nature, this place houses a lot of migratory birds in winters.The magical feel at sunrise and sunset transport you into another era."
181,Nice view of Taj,The garden itself was not very remarkable but looked to be being revamped. Good for bird watching. This is well worth the cost of entry for some pictures of Taj Mahal without the crowds.
182,Sunset visit,"The park itself was absolutely not worth visiting. The gardens are neither beautiful nor well maintained. There is a little wall near the riverbanks where people can sit and watch the sunset. However, the park closes at sunset which means, that the security asks you to leave already during dusk. There is also an entrance fee. In the end we realized, that there was even a public viewpoint with benches even closer to the river and right in front of the wall. You can find it, if you are staying in front of the entrance (facing it) and going along the park on the right side towards the river. You can find the path on Google Maps or Maps.me."
183,visit at sunset,Very nice to watch the sunset but come early around 4:30 to get a good spot.The ticket is a bit expensive just to watch a sunset (200 roupies).We found out after that it is possible to access the garden for free using another entrance.
184,Best place for photography of Taj during sunset and in rainy days,"Built with a pond to reflect the Taj, unfortunately the park is now just somewhat neglected and there appears to be a token effort to rebuild the pond.However, you can get directly opposite the Taj and have lovely views across the river. Great for photos."
185,Magnificent ,This is again a must visit place. Visit there either sunrise or sunset time. Generally Sunset view is more popular among visitors. The view is amazing across the river.This park is open from sunrise to sunset.
186,Oh My God! ,Less explored place in Agra. Must visit place in pleasant weather or early mornings. You can relax in parks. Taj in the backdrop of all your pictures. You will love it.
187,Good view of the taj,Located between the taj Mahal and the fort. Nice garden with lots of trees and flowers and a fountain at the center. Well maintained by the authority. Nice place to click photo with friends or family member. A uplifted area at the center in the middle of the fountain where you can click photo with taj Mahal or fort as the background. Benches are also there if you want to rest. Straight to the garden is the taj Mahal and back is the fort.
188,The garden of heaven,"Difficult to get to. Alot of traffic, but the gardens are nice. People go here to view the Taj at evening time, if they visited the Taj for sunrise, or during the day."
189,Serenity,"Chances are you will not be taken here by your tour guide which is a real shame. This is a garden on the opposite bank of the river across from the Taj Mahal. Make time and visit even for half and hour. You will see the Taj Mahal in a different perspective. The garden has walkways, pools with fountains and shaded pavilions nestled within trees, fragrant flowers and native bushes. If you plan your visit at the end of the day, then you can marvel at the sight as night falls. Magical."
190,Go !!!,These gardens have been let go over the years but are now being worked on.Wonderful view of the Taj anytime of day.
191,For a taj view ,"The weather wasn’t the best for us, but this is a nice garden to wander and sit in while watching the sun go down. Plenty of photo ops here! Felt semi safe, plenty of kids around looking for money."
192,Your solace if Taj is closed,This is also an attraction in Agra. This is ordinary garden. Garden is on back side of Taj Mahal. Garden is well maintained. You can also avoid this place.
193,It does close to soon in the evening - But great view,"Situated on the opposite side of Taj Mahal, Mehtab Bagh holds an ancient history in Agra. It was build during mughals and was a magnificent veiw point to look at Taj Mahal and witness it's beauty on a full moon light. The garden is largely spread across acres and is a good place to go with family and friends. The garden usually shuts by 5pm and thus it is advisable to go before hand and witness the sunset from here."
194,AVOID; Filled with local boys who create a ruckus,Offers romantic views of taj Mahal..... And that too without much for the entrance fee..... Beautiful park with beautiful views
195,Perfect view of the Taj Mahal,This big garden is situated just opposite of Taj and along the yamuna river. Visit this in Feb to April for flowers. Maintanence work is going on currently. This garden is not so beautiful comparing to other Mughal gardens.
196,Friday sunset,"Nice quiet place, great alternative view of the Taj. If it's true that a black Taj was visioned then imagine what could have been."
197,Hidden Gem,"Yes it's a nice garden, if lucky a clear day good view of Taj Mahal,  with there high fenced in area,  now blocked off free river walk as well no boats alowed or walking along the river far side.  Hevan for bid we see the Taj Mahal with out paying a fee but also 28x higher fee for non national. Met many young poor budget travler who needed to chose to break there budget or go see it,  shame world coming all over high fences so we can't see historical things what next build wall around the Coliseum of Rome the Golden Gate Bridge. Sad world were become..!  Lucky for me came years ago it was free & not so much around..!  Now just another tourist trap that's over rated..!  So many other nice Temple, Tumb & Mosque  here India..  Even the park next to Taj Now has a fee..?"
198,Total rip off,Part of our pre-booked tour. Not horrible but be sure you have enough time to spend in Fort Agra and the Taj Mahal. In January the gardens were kind of dead and the views of the Taj Mahal were just OK nothing great. Even our excellent guide kind to just left us wander around a little while - he really had nothing much to add to the experience. If and only if you have extra time otherwise find better things to do in Agra.
199,The “Moon Garden “ ,"If you are coming to visit Tajmahal and you want a beautiful view  of Taj  only this place is to give you a memorable view of Taj. If ypu come agra without visit mehtab bagh never complete your journey. They hive you a beautiful nature,  flowers and lots of this. Must visit this place Specialy for Taj View"
200,Mesmerising view of The Taj,The place is just behind Taj where Shah Jahan's black Taj was supposed to be built but it never was. It will take you 20 minutes by car because you have to travel to the other side of the river.I recommend to avoid because it isn't grandiose and filled with local boys who generally come here to tease women.
201,Beautiful views of the taj mahal,"If you want to see the Taj Mahal but it's Monday (so it's closed), you can still go to Mehtab Bagh on the other side of the river but symmetrically aligned to the Taj, like a backyard, so to say. Although this is a much more humble place and the gardens are not as magnificent, is very less crowded and you still have a great view of the Taj."
202,First trip to the Mehtab Bagh,Reaching at Mehtab Bagh can be difficult but must visit to see Taj from across River. Please take care of opening and closing hrs.
203,Truly an amazing view of the Taj,"Mehtab Bagh is a place of Greenery in Agra. It lies north of the Taj Mahal complex and the Agra Fort on the opposite side of the Yamuna River, in the flood plains. The garden complex, square in shape, measures about 300 by 300 metres and is perfectly aligned with the Taj Mahal on the opposite bank"
204,Nice Bagh,They charge INR300 for a garden full of trash and a view of the barbed wire between the garden and the actual Taj viewing place which is located down the street and costs only INR200. If you came looking for the Taj Viewpoint this is not the place. They're charging 12 times more than they charge locals and will tell you that is the Viewpoint. Just keep walking down the street and you'll see another ticket office where you can buy those 200 ones. Not worth it!
205,Good garden,This needs to be viewed before the Taj. It is very pretty and intricate and the carvin* is absolutely stunning. It’s a miracle it was preserved . The gardens around it were nice
206,Beautiful Place,One has to pay 300 roepies to walk in a poorly kept 'park' with barely a few flowers and fences everywhere (around archeological? works) that make it difficult to reach the only reason to come here: the magnificent view of the Taj Mahal.
207,For Sunrise & Sunset,"The tuktuk driver said that there are no more boat operating on Yamuna River so we can watch the sunset on this garden. I think Mehtab Bagh was a field before without the admission fee. But when we came, we were asked to pay Rs 300 just because the place got a nice view of Taj Mahal. Also, it was still undeveloped yet so it was so dusty. We can see the Taj Mahal alright, and even took some pictures. But, I think it was too overpriced."
208,The Moonlit Garden,Very nice Taj Mahal view lovely sun sunset  very nice view from mehtab Bagh i I recommend for everyone very beautiful area
209,this is another angle to see the taj malha.,If you are planning your visit to taj mahal mehtab bagh is another must visit destination. Last of the mughal gardens Though not much to talk about the beautiful peaceful garden but it’s very close to Taj mahal.
210,best view of taaj mahal,"Mehtab Bagh is an excellent place to have great view of Taj. Situated right across the banks of river Jumana, you get excellent views of Taj. Moreover one avoids all the crowd and rush. The best views are in the evening at dusk. Make sure to reach there at least 1hour before the sunset."
211,Backside Garden of TajMahal,The other side of Taj story Look beautiful just step out and see the world of Taj from this side @bhartiya
212,Other world,"Use the road that conrinues past the ticket office:it's free,no crowds and a better view at sunset of the Taj Mahal"
213,Spectacular view of Taj Mahal,"Its the backside garden of Tajmahal and it has some stunning views of Tajmahal.If you wish to see Tajmahal without any crowd, then taking pictures from mehtab bagh is advisable.Although the gardens can be well maintained, its the back side view of Tajmahal, tourists are interested.Local Photographers take their customers here and explore great angles.Best place to take pictures with Tajmahal at the background."
214,Perfect spot... if Taj Mahal is closed!,"Lots of tourists here to see the sunset.However, due to the pollution, you don’t get a proper sunset....it just sinks into the brown murkiness.However, still a really good spot to see a different perspective of the Taj. Nice photos."
215,Nice garden,"Strongly recommend visiting this place either in winter, summers, autumn.Every season it has its own charm.Beautiful view of tan mahal mesmerises you completely.For photographers, it's a lovely place to capture the moments."
216,Good view of Taj,It was the fist time to visit the metab bagh with my family and friends it was amazing visit to see the taj mahal from back side across the river
217,Best view from the Taj,"My wife and I visited the Taj early in the morning, the Agra Fort in the afternoon, and came to Mehtab Bagh for sunset. I highly recommend that order of seeing these sights. The view of the Taj from Mehtab Bagh is really nice at sunset!Easy to get there and back via an auto/tuk tuk driver."
218,Better than Taj,This is another beautiful place to see while you visit Agra. This is one of the very good memory during our trip.
219,Moon Garden,"It’s open until 7 and a ticket for an Indian is Rs. 50. Mehtab bagh closes at 5:30pm. This is by far the most convenient place to take sunset pics of the Taj without people in your viewfinder. It’s across the river, chirping birds, pleasant breeze and the Taj in all its glory in front of you."
220,Historical Garden,"This place defined my own interpretation of peace, the people lives in this area maintains the cleanliness and the beauty of the garden but what I do not like is only some locals mostly kids were forcing you to buy their products on your way out and some of them offers a free tour and does not simply understand the word no. But overall this has been one of my favorites in Agra."
221,Reconstructed garden,A return tuk tuk to the east gate cost us 300 rupees. It is a few km to get to the garden as it winds through Agra. The gardens were relaxing compared to the chaos of the city. Tripods of any kind are not allowed.
222,View of Taj Mahal ,Over hyped garden ( sort of garden). Tickets cost 15 rs per head. Mehtab bagh presents a view of the Taj Mahal from the other side of Yamuna river. But other than the view there is nothing else to do. Absolutely nothing else. The trees are newly planted and would take atleast few more years to provide shade. During hot summer days the garden becomes a oven and you can easily get heat stroke while walking in the shade less patch of land. If the view of Taj is only thing you seek and can dare the mid day sun then you can visit it or else avoid.
223,Amazing view on Taj Mahal especially at the sunset,The gardens are quite limited so we camped out here as we were told it was a great place for sunset photos of the Taj Mahal. I think that is and a couple of hundred others were disappointed. Good views but sunset didn't reveal anything different.
224,Other view of Taj,"Visited Mehtab Bagh in the morning and found it pleasant and peaceful. It is not very large so I do agree that the admission ticket is rather overpriced. Nevertheless, it's still worth a visit for a different perspective of the Taj Mahal."
225,Taj ,"We were taken to these gardens by our guide immediately on arrival in Agra in the late afternoon to find that there were lots of other visitors there already. It soon became clear as you get amazing views of the Taj Mahal ahead of any planned visit. The gardens are not that impressive, although it’s not the best time of year for it."
226,Nice peaceful area to enjoy Taj Mahal.,"Please Agra - make this site worthy of a tourist attraction.Rather messy and a bit scruffy - was expecting it to be a much grander garden.View of Taj different, wasn't much water in the river, so night reflections would not have been good."
227,A Garden with a beautiful view,"This garden is quite well maintained. I found it a bit far from the centre, but it is worth going over there. Make sure you visit this place before 4.30 PM as they tend to close the gate very soon."
228,Great views,"It is a garden with flowers and one can view Tajmahal from backside. It is just opposite to Tajmahal on other side of Yamuna river. SahaJahan planned to built a black marble Taj in this place for him, but was house arrested by his son Aurangzeb. So nothing to visit."
229,A view of Taj Mahal from across the river,"Of course, no-one tells you that the Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays! Duh. That would have been nice to know! Thankfully, we were able to visit before we left to fly home the following day. The silver lining in this particular cloud was finding ourselves at Mehtab Bagh on the Thursday afternoon - the only place where you can get a decent view when the Taj is closed. It's a lovely garden with a beautiful view of the Taj Mahal across the river. There are also some great photos to be had if you visit late in the day, and it's worth clambering up onto the wall on the river bank to get them. However, the garden could do with some more maintenance to restore it to its former glory."
230,Taj Mahal's back view,"God Almighty planted the garden of paradise. It is a garden of leisure. River on outskirts induces tranquillity,even indolence. There's a kind of melancholy in its decrepitude. The senses are soothed by the cool restfulness of the landscape and heightened by subtle displays of natural and historical beauty."
231,Great view but not necessary,"This time of the year is a great period to soak the sun at the Mehtab Bagh, while enjoying beautiful views of the Taj. There are numerous areas where you can click gorgeous pictures- do try out different angles if you are a professional photographer. The entrance fee is not much, and a restaurant very close to the garden serves delightful vegetarian snacks, especially in the evening. So if you don't feel like standing in the queue for the Taj, this is definitely the best place to be"
232,Beautiful garden,"If u want to the taj from 360 degrees and on toast -u have to come here and sunsets the time. Re- hassle at the site + cost : The disparate entrance fee attracting seemebly people just there to hassle foreign tourists- happens at all the tourist sites in the golden triangle that we saw- so you need to trade that off if you want to see Taj from Across the river or if not -don't go. We went before the close-up Taj and at sunset it was an awe inspiring view  but the the garden and way its run  needs TLC. A driver from our hotel took us on the top 3 Agra sites -fort, baby taj alongside this and it was great hors d'oeuvres to the Real Taj."
233,Hope restoration done and corrupt parking ticket,"This park does not have much attraction.  But rather charming  Many people do not sit on the edge of the park, facing the Taj Mahal.  We really enjoyed the photography and atmosphere at that time."
234,It’s like beautiful nose of Taj Mahal ,"This is on the opposite side of the Yamuna River. Previously it was derelict land and it could be entered free of charge - how things have changed. The area offers spectacular views of the Taj Mahal and of the wildlife that congregates at the Yamuna. Admission is small but well worth it. Parrots, Indian mynah birds and pelicans dot the area and chipmunks run about you without cares.Great area for sunset. Don’t forget your telephoto lens for the wildlife. Beware the location on TA is absolutely nowhere where it should be, and is so far out it is on the wrong side of the Yamuna. Look at your map / GPS and it is easy to find."
235,Great view of the Taj,"This Bagh is on the other side of River Yamuna where Taj Mahal is located . Some renovation work was going when we visited . Yet, we had all the time to gaze at Taj Mahal without being disturbed by crowds and you can take pictures at your pace . I strongly recommend to any visito to come here and watch Taj Mahal without getting disturbed .Governor Amolak Rattan Kohli"
236,Hyped and avoid during summer.,The Mehtab Bagh is just awesome you can't miss this place at all definitely visit this garden if you are visiting Taj Mahal
237,Really Cool Taj Photos,"Beautiful garden created by Babar / Humayun but selected by emperor SHAHJAHAN to build another TAJMAHAL with black rocks for himself, which could not go beyond foundation. One get the best view of TAJMAHAL on the opposite bank of river Jamuna. Best time to visit this place is during sunset to get surreal view of TAJMAHAL"
238,Alternate view of Taj,It is poorly maintained now. It is located at the back of yamuna river. One can view the Taj Mahal from here. This garden is from the Mughal era times.
239,Beautiful lawns,"It takes a little time to get to the gardens. We took an Auto and were advised by the driver to look out for touts or scammers. The gardens themselves looked to be in a transition of growth, so not so vibrant at this time of the year. What you are given though is a great view of the rear of the Taj Mahal, with all four towers or minars visible. Unfortunately for us there was a lot of mist which had obscured most of the Taj. So you could only see the outline."
240,Must visit place for a different view of Taj,"Since we went during the summer time, most of the flowers are not fully blown yet. The soil was dry and dusty. A slight haze obscured the Taj Mahal from a good photo shoot. I recommend to check the local weather and avoid summer and dry season. Don't forget that the Taj Mahal is close on every Friday."
241,mesmerizing view....,Its one of the best place to see Taj mahal at sunset. Recommend to all. Connectivity is also very good. Nice road to reach there.
242,Should be a must visit for a different view of Taj,"Since I went in December when the river has less water and there aren't any barriers to look at the Taj from the other side, this was the only way to do so. Go during sunrise or sunset and you will love the Taj against the blaming winter sun and the skies changing hues. Check the picture."
243,Peaceful,As a garden it may have been wonderful and the backstory is interesting  but there is not much now.You can see the Taj Mahal and it is supposed to be especially good at sunset but they closed the garden before that so we could tell.There was a reflecting pond showing the Taj but it is not there now.
244,Great,"It should be in a must visit list for people visiting Taj. It is well maintained, is peaceful, green and provides a splendid view of Taj.On a good day it is a pretty sight seeing the sunset over it.It is a good place for photographers, lot of pre-wedding shoots happen here.One can spend half and hour or an hour clicking pictures and admiring the beauty that should be enough"
245,View of the Taj Mahal,"This was the grand reveal to us of the Taj Mahal and it hit all three of us in the same way.Best view we found was to sit on the wall with TM off to your right. There was no sun shimmering off the marble, probably because of the airborne pollution.Gardens themselves were pleasant and the noise from the birds was unbelievable but fun. There are public toilets in the gardens near the entrance.Fairly stringent bag searches took place, so only take what you need."
246,Great for sunset,"We arrived at the garden around 16:30, took a look around and we were the fist to sat on the wall in the end of the gardens before the river. It was good to be the first one as we had Taj Mahal positioned in the centre! The sun set was around 6:15pm on the right of Taj Mahal side, it was good to see Taj empty and with a nice light from the sun! As soon the sun set happen the guard came and closed the gardens. It's worth a visit!"
247,Alternate view point for the Taj Mahal.,at just Rs 15/- for indians its really a worth visiting this place. it looks lovely in sunset. you can click so many pics at leisure without so much of disturbance from crowds.. go there by 4.30pm relax in the lushful gardens and click photos with taj background.. but i think it will look much better during july-december. anyways to click shots at sunset with tan background do go there
248,Excellent place to view  Taj,"This place is bit isolated and less crowded than the rest of Agra. Half an hour drive from the center of the city.If you love photography, or want to spend some peaceful time away from the crowd, I would highly recommend this one. You can click some beautiful pictures in the garden with the TajMahal in backdrop. Early morning or sunset hours are the best times to visit. You might even spot some beautiful birds around.A 2-hour stroll is more than enough to take a round of the bagh."
249,Go see the Taj at Sunset,Initially we had thought to skip this site but our guide insisted.  So glad he did.  We thoroughly enjoyed walking through the ´baby Taj ´.
250,Perfect for a good sunset view of Taj Mahal,"DON’T PAY.If you only want to see the Taj from a distance don’t pay. There’s two entrances in to this... one is 300INR P/P the other is FREE! If you continue to go straight you’ll see the same thing. The only difference with the entry fee in you’ll get a direct picture of the Taj. And there will be crowds upon crowds trying to get that “perfect” selfie. The other way, you don’t pay you still get an amazing shot and with nobody else around. But bare in mind there is lots of kids around who will ask you to buy from them and even show you the free pathway down to see the Taj 😊 they’re harmless and actually speak really good English.I was going to the Taj the following day so I found it pointless paying in to grounds to get a distant photo! It just didn’t make sense to me! So the pathway I went 🕌🙌🏼 Also the camel in the photo is also on the grounds used for human entertainment if anyone wanted to ride it around 👊🏼"
251,A park with a view!!,"There really isn’t much to this garden. However, it wasn’t crowded at all when we were there and had nice views of the Taj Mahal across the river. The pollution was terrible, so the views were very hazy. Still, probably worth the small admission fee to be able to see it with few people in your way."
252,Interesting backside view of Taj Mahal from gardens,The Mehtab Bagh is really beautiful and the place is quite well kept. Its interesting to hear about how this garden was planned.
253,Beautiful place,"Mehtab Bagh is a historic park built by Mughals. It is situated on the bank of Yamuna river other than that of the Taj Mahal. Mehtab Bagh is often visited to have a sunset view of the Taj or to have a view of Taj on the days it is closed, such as Fridays.Mehtab Bagh can be easily navigated to with help of Google Maps. Free parking on roadside is available. A very minimal fee is charged for entry. Do carry your own water in the summers.Please BEWARE of touts or guides overcharging for your visit to Mehtab Bagh. In Fact, there is no need to hire a guide."
254,click photos at sunset,"its a garden basically. but famous due the view u can see of taaj from here. best view is at morning or afternoon. entry fee is not less. to se the taj view, u dont need to enter inside, just follow the road going the side of it till the river. cross the fence and enter it and see it. dont be ashamed of crossing the fence, its not the garden property and u find many are doing the same."
255,Great different view,"I afmire the historical story of this place. A planned Black Tajmahal but failed. We see the abandoned foundation and scenary of Tajmahal from this spot.But..... looking at the surrounding of this garden, sad to see it's full of rubbish and dirt!"
256,But do it after the rains!,"Dont bother with this paddock passed off as a garden....if the view is what you came for continue straight past the gate, ingnore the barricades rhat have been kinda put there, then follow the path down to the river bank and save yourself the 300 per person fee....even if you've got money to burn; find a better bonfire... so to speak"
257,Best view of Taj!,"This Bagh is on the ear side of the Taj across river Yamuna. The place is well maintained however due to security restrictions, you cannot go closer to Taj or river bank, this takes away a lot of joy of viewing Taj. Getting a Public transport after sunset can be an issue"
258,See Taj from behind and on the waters,Didnt even know this place existed- the benefit of a guide I guess. Fab views but can get a bit crowded. No facilities to speak of but that view will do it every time!
259,A Great Way to End the Day,"Since it's a bit of an effort to get to this park, it's not very crowded at all (at least not on a weekday). Quiet and largely empty, we sat under the shade of a tree and spent about an hour just chatting and gazing at the splendor of the Taj Mahal."
260,View the Taj Mahal at sunset,"This garden is 7 km from Taj Mahal. I wanted to go there because a couple of my friends who were born and brought up in Agra, swear by this place. So after getting disappointed with the super crowded Taj Mahal, I taken an auto for 100 INR and headed straight towards Mehtab bagh. It is situated in quite an isolated place amidst village and so the crowd isnt decent at all there. Also, No tourists go there because this place is known mostly to localites. But the kind of view that it offered was above and beyond my expectations. Even Taj Mahal at 06:00 a.m. visit wouldnt offer this kind of amazing view that we happen to see from Mehtab bagh.Taj alongwith East and West gates can be seen from this bagh and the best part is - it isnt crowded at all and ticket comes half the price. Tickets for Mehtab bagh strolling is for just 25 INR. the only thing is that there isn't much to do in this bagh, 30 minutes visit will be good enough. I spent an hour though. Also, after viewing this bagh, one can choose to visit Red Fort which is around 3 km from garden. I chose to skip Agra fort because I am not much into visiting mainstream places."
261,Sunset at Mehtab!,Mehtab baug is a place from where Taj can be seen from back side . On the bank of Yamuna river it's more a garden .A dream of emperor Shahjahan of making black Tajmahal never came true.
262,Beautiful and relaxing,Mehtab Bagh is just behind Taj Mahal. By road it is 10 kms away from Taj. One can get a view of Taj.
263,Beautiful setting,"It should be one of the must visit places list for people visiting Taj. It is well maintained, is peaceful, greenery and provides a beautiful view of Taj. You can spend half an hour to an hour for sight seeing, clicking pictures and admiring the beauty that should be enough."
264,Enchanting view of the Taj...,"Yet again, one from my Agra diaries(I still have a lot of places to write about). This place is just across the Taj, in fact this place gives a good vantage point for amateur photographers to get some good long shots of the Taj especially during the sunrise and the sunset, it would be great"
265,Enchanting evening stroll,"If you would come to Agra want to visit the Taj mahal, I woul recommend this place to called mehtaab bagh which is far from the Taj Mahal, but you will get the better view of Taj from mehtaab bagh...Agra is a major tourist destination because of its many Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur"
266,Just another Garden..,Must visit this place at evening want to see beautifull view with river so this is the place lovely garden
267,"OK, but missable if you're short on time.","It’s not so well maintained garden, wish they can do a better job, it’s on the banks of Jamuna River opposite to Taj Mahal, the morning silhouette of The Taj Mahal is worth a look from this garden"
268,Nice view,"A must see. We went for the evening sunset and was a magical evening.....it was not crowded, just few of us had a direct view of the Taj from across the Yamuna and the sunset/sunrise provides the opportunity to see the magic of the Taj changing colors in the natural reflection of sunrays during sunrise/sunset."
269,Brilliant views of the Taj Mahal at sunset,"After tired visit of Akbar's tomb,Marium's tomb and baby taj we came here and found very relaxing. Taj from bank of yamuna is marvelous. sunset scene is very memorial. Must visit."
270,Great view of Taj Mahal,It is one of those places tht are of utmost importance but less reverred abd visited..! Visiting these beautiful garden can change your perception of Taj Mahal in White marble as these gardens were supposed to have a Taj Mahal in blck marble which couldnt take place because of lack of resources in mughal treasury as commonly believed byt truth is Aurangzebs religious fanaticism... That eventually lead to scism and rupture into Hindus and Muslims relationships and later ended the mughal era in India...A must visit to see story behind the Taj Mahal...!!!
271,Taj mahal taster,The place is having historical importance. The place is having a beautiful Garden on the other side of Taj across Yamuna.  It is believed that there was a plan to build another Black Taj Mahal at this site.
272,Favorite view of the Taj Mahal!  ,"I had not intended to visit Mehtab Bagh as Im going to Taj Mahal for sun rise but we were driving past at sunset so decided to make a stop, entrance is only 300 rupees so well worth it."
273,Good views of Taj in the morning,We came here at the end of a long day visiting various places in Agra. We got here just before sunset. The park is very serene and a lovely quiet place to visit. The view of the Taj is excellent from across the river and gives a great view of it as the sun sets. The colours on the Taj were amazing and well worth the trip to the park. It wasn't too busy either which was a plus. I'd definitely recommend visiting here.
274,Alternate spot that provides view of the Taj across the river,Mehtab bagh is located across river yamuna just opposite to Tajmahal and has a breathtaking view of Tajmahal from the back on the banks of river yamunaIt is well maintained park with no hustle bustle a serene attractive place for tourists
275,not worth the tuk tuk ride or the 200 rupee entry,Came here in the evening to see the sunset. (Didn't happen and also there is smog so how often you get to see the sun setting I am not sure). The coach parked a way off and we were mobbed by people trying to sell you things (keep your head down and avoid any eye contact) on the way there and back.  The gardens were scrubland with litter and not at all conducive to the view of the Taj although it has to be said that standing on the wall you did get a good view of the Taj.  With time so limited to view things in India not sure this would be on my list.
276,Best place to see sunset over the Taj,"Sunset visit to see the Taj, but too much smog...its a problem here. But rewarded with a beautiful vista nontheless."
277,Great spot to see the Taj on dusk,"This is basically a dilapidated park that charges a hefty 200 rupees for nothing (15 for Indians), except the view of the Taj. FYI, the Taj view in the morning from inside the complex is 100 times better. Totally disappointing and not worth the trip."
278,Overpriced and underwhelming,"Once u enter in garden will feel that it's just a normal garden but, another side walk beautiful flat view of Taj just 300 meters far from garden wall"
279,Worth the small detour,"Yamuna river separates taj and this bagh, but Yamuna is mostly dry and you won't see any water in it.Either go early morning or around evening as its large open area and can be pretty hot during summers.There is unofficial road side parking available before the entrance. Tickets can be bought online on asi website.If you are looking for calm area to enjoy Tajmahal, this is the place to go.Garden area is huge with lots of different types of trees; and one can also go for small picnic too."
280,What a view!,very good place in agra and very beautiful view.Me and friends enjoy here .if you have free time you come here enjoy beautiful place
281,Another view of the Taj Mahal,"Mehtab Bagh is back of taj to speak as Taj looks same from all sides.yamuna lies between Taj and Mehtab,its told that its the site where Shahjahan wished to build Black Taj Mahal.U can get the beautiful view of Taj and if u are lucky there may be water flowing along the Yamuna which will give u a memorable view of Taj U should visit but sadly its closed by 5.00 clock that's the hitch.or u may enjoy Taj in nights which is a Blessing of god"
282,Just another garden,"I wasn't quite sure whether to go to the place because I just had some negative reviews by some of our family members (they visited the place two years ago or so) before going over there.We went to Agra on a Thursday evening and wasn't really satisfied with the time we got to enjoy the beauty of Taj Mahal. Fridays... Taj Mahal is closed for the visitors. Hence, Mehtab Bagh, was the only option left for us to view Taj properly on Friday.After visiting Agra Fort and baby Taj we went in there in the late afternoon, fiveish .. And we just adored the place..Almost a 200 mt walk through the garden took us to the closest point where we were standing beside a small brick wall (one can jolly well walk on the top of it, in fact, my 70 year old mom-in-law climbed and sat on the top of the wall at ease). And wala... What a majestic grandeur!! Wah Taj!! .... Even better from the back side .. with Yamuna (river) flowing in the front and the white grass barrier of wild sugarcane (Saccharum spontaneum) edged the landscape and made it look like a painting... Trust me.. no one would have to edit the digital images.. They were at their bests automatically.We went there on 28th October 2018 and it was not a full moon.. Still it looked so heavenly and caught all of us drawn towards it with the mystic yet mesmerizing beauty.. I wonder how the full moonlit Taj Mahal would look like from Mehtab bagh!Highly recommended place... I am going to visit it again.. for sure 😊"
283,OMG Best place to capture perfect wallpaper click and some incredible pictures of Taj Mahal,"This place is defo worth a visit. It costs to get in & it gets abit crowded but it is a nice place to walk around - the gardens are beautiful, and of course the view to the Taj Mahal. We combined this along with the baby Taj Mahal in a couple of hours. Hired a tuc tuc from our Homestay."
284,Nice view but far,"Got up early and went to the Taj Mahal in the morning then later in the day we went to see the sunset at Mehtab Bagh.  Well worth the visit, nice view over the river and you see the Taj Mahal in the changing light."
285,Nice view from the other side of Taj Mahal,"Mehtab Bagh and Mehtab Bagh Taj View Point are separate. I visited only Taj View Point and avoided going to garden itself, as garden closes at 5:30 PM and I reached there little later than 5:30 PM. But I enjoyed at the view point. Not a must go but if you have time, you can give it a try!"
286,A different view of the Taj Mahal! ,"My husband visited here a few years ago when the building was inlay of real semi - precious stones and gold ceilings. Now it appears to have been looted and wish restoration done on inside more. When leaving I believe a police officer guarding the facility tipped some random person to give our uber driver who had JUST arrived to pick us up a parking ticket. They stood in front of our car, argued at the window. Are we supposed to cross a busy street to get a cab? Obviously a set up so beware."
287,Very beautiful to watch the sunset ,"Quite annoying entrance. Entrance fee by card is 250, by cash 300. Off course card payment is not possible when you ask for. Paying with 2.000 cash results in receiving 1.500 back. If you say that it's not correct you get your additional 200, which the guy is already holding back. The constant ripping of tourists becomes so annoying that it leaves a bad taste about sightseeing in India. Why not threat tourists honest? They maybe come back or speak positive about the country...The park is oké for a quick stop, the view on Taj Mahal is indeed good. But not a real must-visit if you already visited Taj Mahal."
288,The perfect perspective,It is at back of taj Mahal on bank of Yamuna river having good collection of flowers nice to se it in morning so enjoy it
289,Behind Taj Mahal ,"If you have time and you have a driver it's worth going there at sunset, it's not only a nice quiet park with very few people, it also has a breathtaking view on Taj Mahal."
290,Great way to quietly admire the Taj Mahal,At the time of our visit there was some maintenance work going on and hence looked in disarray . Needs some real renovation/ attention and could be a great garden. Amazing views of the Taj across the river from here
291,mehtab bagh,"DO NOT BRING A CAMERA TRIPOD here, you are not allowed in with it...we were not expecting this here.  We went in the afternoon, the view was pretty good.  If you have time I recommend it but this is not a must see site."
292,A delightful place beautifull6 constructed,its on ban of river yamuna having good garden with beautiful collection of flowers enjoy with friends and have fun
293,Mehtab Bagh,"small park, a lot of bird, with river in front, avoid the picture of full of other visitors. Nice to visit during evening for sunset. close around 6pm before sunset."
294,Ideal to see sunset at the Taj Mahal,Its a nice big garden meaning Moonlight Garden its name. Its really to the opposite bank of Yamuna River  behind Taj Mahal You can have unrestricted views of the monument but as it will follow your visit to Taj Mahal it must be another hour of the day for other colors of the light The garden closes at 7 in the afternoonIf you dont have time in Agra dont go
295,Mehtab bagh,Wouldn’t let me take tripod nor my drone and I was not gonna leave my $1500 drone with the front office so we didn’t bothered checking it out. Judging by outside of this park grass looked dead and there were typical hundreds of Indian men standing and staring.
296,Lovely,"Must Visit Place of you are in Agra, Especially in the evening time the best, you can see the reflection of entire taj on the waters of Yamuna River."
297,Peaceful atmosphere and good view of Taj,it is a hood gardem it has many flowers it has rose and tulip and lily amd what not it has water also
298,The Garden with A story,"It’s been a couple of years since I’ve been here and the first visit it felt like a secret gem that made it quite a special experience. Now there are coaches of tourists and lots of hawkers and it was more expensive.No food or drink allowed, only water and no smoking. Bags checked on entry.The garden is lovely and the view of the Taj is breathtaking.It’s gets busy as sunset but not so that you can’t have space to sit on the wall and take in the view.Would highly recommend visit for the fabulous photo opportunities.There’s a cheaper place up the road which has benches and cuts in front of the garden but here for 100 rupees extra (300 entry fee for foreigners) you get the garden and I noticed those visiting the other place didn’t stay for long.Rounds off a stay in Agra perfectly."
299,Must visit for different view of Taj,"אחד משבעת פלאי עולם . יפיפה. להכנס בפעם הראשונה ולספוג את הנמראה הנפלא ולנצור אותו לעד  Great, very beautifulOne of the Seven Wonders of the World. Beautiful. To enter for the first time and soak up the wonderful comfort and keep it forever"
