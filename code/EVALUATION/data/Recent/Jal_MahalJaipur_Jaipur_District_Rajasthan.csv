Just a view; but it is stunning despite floating garbage ,You can‚Äôt visit the palace on the water but the view from the lake something like you never seen before.   Unfortunately the lake is dirty needs to be cleaned so don‚Äôt be fooled by pristine photos where all the floating garbage has been photoshopped out. 
Jal Mahal Is A Beauty,"Jal Mahal Jaipur Is Reopen And Best palace To Explore In Rainy Season   builduing that made in the centre of a lake , u can easily watch one side of this builduing on the way to amber fort , ek behtreen namuna.."
Beautiful to photograph at different times of the day.,"Beautiful to photograph from down next to the lake or see Jaipur come alight from sunset through to when it lights up from the road to Jaigarh Fort.  The Jal Mahal is beautifully lit. and the lake reflection makes it especially lovely at night.  There is work underway to clean up the lake and restore the palace. which is five storeys, but only the top storey is visible above the lake.  There is a market along the road there, we didn't find any problems with the hawkers. We were there in early March 2020 They just have to make a living, must be tough this year if they are around at all now.‚Ä¶"
sthapatya art ,"A builduing that made in the centre of a lake , u can easily watch one side of this builduing on the way to amber fort , ek behtreen namuna art ka that too made and stand from years "
"Seriously, don't step out of your car!","Jal Mahal looks good in pictures and from far away. Of all Jaipur attractions, this was the worst. You can get down from the car, only to be confronted by hawkers, touts & crowds. It is dirty & as you near the water, the most disgusting smell assaults your senses! Unfortunately, I am saddened to say that the people around have little civic sense either. And it isn't worth getting down, for even a few pictures, because once you breathe in that disgusting smell, it stays with you! Admire the place from far, is my advice to you!‚Ä¶"
I m still confused,"Just like my last visit in 2017, I am still confused why this structure was built. This time I had an even worse experience with a foul smell in the waters when we tried to get some pictures from the road. The hawkers on the street makes the things a bit more clumsy. This place‚Ä¶"
Summer & Water Palace,"Title according to our guide so could be a furphy ?? But obvious that it would be a cooler location during the heat of Summer with cool water breezes. What is known is that it was built in 1799 AD and is only viewed from the roadside. A hundred hawkers on site , so it is a well‚Ä¶"
Okay for a photograph,The still waters give a perfect reflection and so this is good for a photograph.  You can only view this from the road and cannot go into it.  It was a former hunting palace and is presently being converted. There is a market in the area by the place that gives the best views. ‚Ä¶
Worth a photograph!,"Known as the Water Palace, this former hunting lodge is in the process of being converted into a restaurant.  It can be viewed from the road that runs alongside the lake."
A break in your coach trip,"Not as spectacular as mooted. A palace in the middle of a lake, can be viewed from the lake side walk 150-200m away.  The many hawkers and street vendors detract from the possible beauty and allure of this palace. The hazy atmosphere also diminished the view, making photography‚Ä¶"
Palace on Waters,"It is now known as Taj Lake Palace. It is located right in the midst of Lake Pichola. Standing tall and beautiful in the middle of Lake, Taj Lake Palace is an 18th-century historic stay in the City of Lakes offering an ethereal experience of the era of kings and queens"
Just drive past and view this from the viewpoint,"This Palace probably looks more picturesque in the evening (I hope), because it is very average to see by daytime. We were told by our driver that you cannot actually go across the water to the Jal mahal, not sure if this is true or not. If so, its a very average drive by‚Ä¶"
Water Palace,Amazing place to visit either in day time or in evening in middle ot Man sagar lake in Jaipur.  Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh constructed Jal Mahal in 1799 to serve as a hunting lodge during his duck shooting trips.
Jalmahal,Nicely  developed with vision of water conservation  and tourism.  Feel vibrant when you are on top of jalmahal viewing  nature  and  clean water. Beautifully decorated  museum  to display  historic  past od palace.good experience.  Can be visited with family  friends  and kids‚Ä¶
Jal magn,Jal mahal is jaipurs one of the historic place and its wow moment for me amazing place in between water its palace here and i loved it
Nice,"We visited here n looked outside only.You cann see from the banks of the lake.but we enjoyed the shopping here.Rajastani duppatta s,chappals,dresses.we bought them."
Untouchable! ,"What an impressive view from the shore of the lake. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs inaccessible and no visits allowed. Our Guide informed us it was being renovated and will be open end of 2021 as a floating hotel. Watch this space!"
A romantic view from the shore,I loved this palaceIt ignited my imagination and I took a pic I love.My guide a young auto driver was happy to take me from site to site.We went to Amber Fort... don‚Äôt miss it!
"Impressive, but not possible to visit.",Imagine that you want to duck hunt ... so just build a small cottage in the middle of field and make a lake around it! Wow!I hope that the plans to organise guided visits will be made reality - in that case I'll go back.
A guided tour is not allowed,"One is not allowed to be close to Jal Mahal, and internal tour, or guided tour is out of the question. You can take a view from distance, and it is fasciniting. It will be great, if they will allow a boat tour closer to the palace."
A neglected palace,"It may be a palace but not accessible by tourists, you can not go there, you can‚Äôt  see it from inside, you can‚Äôt have a close look. Not properly maintained  by the authorities. You can just enjoy the lake and hills around. I have visited this place a number of times but could‚Ä¶"
Memorable one,Place is very good for see its situated in the centre of the River area was very fantastic for the visitors
Good at night ü§©,Visit it at night u will find many streets shopping at and some food to canmel ride also available but I didn‚Äôt take it because animals get hurted buy us only
An old palace in the middle of the pond ,This palace was built for the use of the royal family of Jaipur and is surrounded by an artificial pond . Can be reached only by boat . Is used by the royal family only twice a year . Is not open for visits of the public . 
Golden Triangle,"You can get dropped off along the side of the lake where there are viewing points to take photos of the Palace on the lake. There are many crafts being sold along here who want to sell you something so be ready to haggle. Don't miss the wildlife statues here of an elephant,‚Ä¶"
Palace inside Water,Its just Amazing to visit Jal Mahal. Name of this Site says PALACE on WATER. You will find picturesque view & nice heritage  site
Seen from afar,"One can not see this palace very closely, unless you stay at the hotel there. Very disappointing as the gardens looked nice. There are lots of street vendors and beggars who made the visit there unpleasant."
Not a tourist attraction,"This does not qualify a tourist attraction. It does not offer anything to stop by, and spend time. You can only watch it from the shore and cant get close to it. You can very well watch it on a drive to or from Amer fort. The only reason why you might want to stop there is the road side shopping option available in from the front of the Jal Mahal. But you have a lot of other places to do road side shopping in Jaipur! This should be your first place to skip if you are on a tight schedule in Jaipur"
What a place!,I‚Äôve been going to Jaipur my whole life but only this once did I visit the Jal Mahal! Unfortunately one can‚Äôt go too close but it‚Äôs still a site to savour !
Unfortunately smelly,"Just a single picture worth, this attraction offers nothing but disappointment. Tourists can click pictures of Jal mahal from the promenade. The area surrounding the promenade is very smelly. The roadside hawkers sitting on the promenade have nothing new to offer as well. This attraction can be avoided big time."
Smelly ,Just a palace immersed in water. We stopped just for the picture. Place smells horrible and it‚Äôs full of people selling you stuff. Don‚Äôt think that is worth seeing.
Do not visit during daytime,The light show at night is the only good thing about the monument. If you during the day you can do a lot of shopping for tiny things.
‚ÄúWater Palace‚Äù,We had to stop roadside to view the Jal Mahal which is located in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. It was built as theatre. It is a beautiful site from a distance on a foggy day. There were plenty of traditional handicrafts venders and sellers along the roadside.  SEE photos.
Roadside Stop and Viewing,A palace in the centre of a lake in Jaipur. You cannot visit and are constantly pestered by beggars and touts. Very pretty but nothing special.
Beautiful. ,"So lovely, you can‚Äôt go on the the island, you just stop for a few mins by the road and look from the road. It‚Äôs a shame the government don‚Äôt allow you to go on the island.  It‚Äôs gorgeous. "
Pretty cool,I guess the only reason I like this place is because it was poking up out of the water like a floating Hotel. I guess the royalty in the area found it nice in the summer time because the water cooled the entire building. I thought that was very interesting. I don't know if you can actually go to it when you can see it from the road way and one of the Street Markets along the way. It's worth a glimpse
Worth the stop!,"This is worth a stop along the road as this is one of a kind, even if you‚Äôve been to Venice!  You‚Äôll fight for space along the hockers and the mopeds but the juxtaposition of water and palace is odd to say the least."
Relaxation in Night,In jaipur jal mahal is famous there are 7 floor but u can only see 2 floors near by nargarh fort and in night this place is very peaceful
A visit means you look across the water from the road!,"As with  a few ""attractions"" and historic buildings in India, this is a view from the road only place.  Looks great but why do these things get listed as attractions?"
Another must see while in Jaipur,This is yet another must see in Jaipur. It's a quick stop for a photo and you can be on your way. This is a good area to see and/or ride camel's. I didn't ride a camel but the camel owners let me pat the camels and take photos
Drive by,It's interesting to drive by and see. Didn't go out to it but the history of how it was made is interesting.....look it up yourselves. 
Stinky,"Poorly maintained, but fort was good , just on the way on the road so doesn't waste much time  Not clean"
Don't waste your time here,You can see it from far distance from the dhore of the lake. It would have been great experience to visit here if the entry is allowed. 
On the way stop to the Amer Fort complex,Nothing much to write about here. No boating or visit to the Mahal allowed. It's just a photo op on the way to the Jaipur forts  Ask the auto guy to stop for few minutes in way to the forts and this place is checked off the list
Photo Stop,"This place can't be accessed but you can have a good photos at the time of sunset and sunrise. Went during Kite festival, this sky around this place is filled with kites. It is a really enjoyable moment but too crowded."
Unique structure,A unique structure in water. Cannot go inside. Can admire it from distance. Surrounding water body is not clean. There are local street sale on the sides. Can visit on passing by to Amer fort
Visit to Jaipur,Jal Mahal is another tourist place to visit in jaipur. Though it is not open for public. It adds to the beauty if scenic Jaipur.
Super Place,Awesome Place to visit with family and friends. Best location for all ages in every season. Recommended.
Floating palace better in pictures,Although this is definitely something unique the pictures online make it look much more spectacular than it really is. Very dirty near it and a fence obscures any good views.
Pretty but not accessible,"A pretty summer palace in the middle of a lake, which is great for a photo backdrop, but, as it's not accessible, that's about it. Stalls and and attractions along the lakeside where you take photos from make it more entertaining."
Light up the Night,"If you have the opportunity, save the trip to Jal Mahal for night time.  Although it is equally impressive during the day, the reflection of the palace on the dark water at night really accentuates this place.  Plus, it is MUCH less busy."
Don't expect too much,Try to go at evening to see the light work.I went for sunrise view but it's been little foggy and it will take less than hour to enjoy the area.
Passing through visit,"There are whole lot of hawkers all around Jal Mahal promenade, making it lose out its charm.A short visit (10 mins),whilst passing thru is sufficient."
Interesting site with locals ,"Mostly Indians hanging out here, interesting view. You can buy and eat street food, stroll along the street.However not much to do as a tourist."
Picturesque view,"Though the palace is not accessible to tourist anymore, one can see it from the street. The water levels are at the palace floor levels giving it a floating feel. Can be utilised as a refreshment break while appreciating the view. Should be visited during the day. Light show is also available in the evening but not much worth."
Only a possible view from the lakeshore ,You must have seen this installation in many movies.We can only move from the lakeshore. There are no boating available now.
Nice,"It was nice to visit . It is in the middle of lake , boats helped us to reach there . There is no entry fee you have to only pay boat charges ."
Lovely park to chill and shop,A good stop after the amber fort. A lovely place to walk around and relax. There are small stalls to buy souvenirs and one can take pictures in ethnic clothes.
Picturesque view,"Jal Mahal (meaning ""Water Palace"") is a palace in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur. Basis the information shared by guide, the palace was used by the royal family, especially during the summers. However, a tourist can only watch the palace from side of the roads. One is not allowed to visit the palace by any means. However, the palalce has picturesque view from the road."
Not Much To See,"We visited Jal Mahal on our way back to Jaipur from the Amber Fort. While the palace itself is picturesque enough, you can‚Äôt get to it and so have to look from the viewing area which tends to attract a large number of vendors. We visited mid morning and so perhaps visiting in the evening when it is lit up would provide a better view and photo opportunity."
 Stop-click-go  !!,The view is splendid if u can ignore the noise around. Difficult to find a serene spot for a photograph before the hawkers literally mob u with their stuff. 
Just OK,"Area around Lake is like dumping site, lots of rats around. The building looks very nice, but better on the picture."
A serene get away,We were on a trip to Agartala and local friends took us to the Neer Mahal built by the local Maharaja in 1930. To reach there you have to fo by a motor boat which operates with a minimum  of 20 tourists or you can hire a small rowing boat for Rs. 300. The palace is a white‚Ä¶
Jal Mahal - stunning architecture,"One of the beautiful architectural marvel in heart of Jaipur , Rajasthan ,India.Maharaj Madho Singh -1 constructed the Jal Mahal in 1750. It is in the middle of man sagar lake. Jal Mahal , seems floating in lake and from the bank it appears as a single story building , but as‚Ä¶"
Masterpiece ,A must visit  Even the road side shops offer cheap n good products  Bar gain is needed - whatever they say just divide by 2 or 3 
‚ô°,"Beautiful, wish i could take a boat out to explore closer. 10 min stop for admiring from a distance. Worth it!"
It‚Äôs so picturesque,"Jal Mahal is a palace in Jaipur and located in the middle of a lake which is why the name of the palace translates into Water Palace in English. The palace is reachable by boat only, but well worth a detour because it‚Äôs so picturesque."
Truly exotic and romantic ,Jalmahal is a genius gem in udaipur... a must visit... an amalgamation of rajkot n mogul cultures. The lovely well.maintained gardens... the boat ride ferry to and fro from the main palace to jalmahal are lovely.The restaurant and the walkways in jalmahal are relaxing with romantic ambience.A must see if in udaipur.
Photo booth of Jaipur.,As you can recognize by word Jal Mahal. Its between the water one of the best place in the Jaipur. For photography for peace for walks too. There are local photographers too who clicks photos around jal mahal in rajasthani dresses and props. there are morning fairs also in which you can buy dresses and other products too. There are  birds swans which make it more serene. One should definitely visit this place in Jaipur.
A Palace in the Center of Lake.. Jal(Water) & Mahal(House),"One can not visit inside the Mahal like others but a place of peace. Ducks, Swans and Other Birds on the onset of Lake. Jal Mahal is the masterpiece of own time. One must visit the place and see this masterpiece.. !! ‚úåÔ∏è"
Photo point,The beautiful Jal Mahal is not accessible but just to be viewed from a distance. You can click photos here. There are photographers who rent Rajasthani costumes to wear and click pictures in it. It's located on the way to Amer fort so one can stop by for a quick photo. The water palace looks even more beautiful at night with all the lightings. The Mahal is made of sandstone and looks as if it is floating on water but actually it's 3 floors are submerged in water. The architecture seems superb. Hope they allow visitors soon.
Just a photo stop.,"It‚Äôs such a shame that you can‚Äôt visit the Jal Mahal, it‚Äôs not derelict, it‚Äôs actually been  semi restored by an Indian businessman, whose intentions were to open it as a majestic restaurant, but build a hotel on the lake shore to stay, the manager at our hotel, The Trident was telling us the story, as it‚Äôs a beautiful view from the hotel looking at the Jal Mahal, but the government won‚Äôt give permission for the hotel, so the floating palace stands empty and forlorn.The photo shots are just from the road, such a wasted opportunity for the city."
Beautiful Jal Mahal,Jal Mahal palace is an architectural wonder of the Rajputana. The building is in the middle of the lake and looks as if its floating in the water .The palace is built with red sandstone and is a five storied building. Four floors remain underwater when the lake is full and the top floor is seen.this place looks beautiful surrounded by hills. It can be visited while going to Amer Forth as it is on the way.The place was very crowded as it was peak season and a lot of garbage was thrown near lake sides which looked terrible. People should be more aware of taking care of our rich cultural heritage.
Attraction in Jaipur,"We stopped by on our way back from Amer fort to take a glimpse of the Jal Mahal. It is viewed only from a distance. There are many vendors on the road-side selling handicrafts, where you can shop for your home. Children will find entertainment in the bike rides and camel rides."
Palace in the water - to be seen from distance,"Don't understand what other travellers find anything great here. It is building/palace standing in a lake where 3 stories are below water but you can't go anywhere close to it. You can only see it from 300m or so from the road. You need a great zoom camera to get close up of the building, if you are lucky to have ""clear "" day. (we were not, as it was hazy even at 2pm ) So it can't be considered an ""attraction"" as per me."
photo stop,"It is just a photo stop, pretty but not an attraction.  Lake bank is  filled with hawker,  rubbish and rats"
Can only see on the banks of lake,"You can only take photos from the banks of the lake. Not reachable. Also, there are many mouse holes at the banks."
Jal Mahal,"Just v can take fotos, i think a boating to palace will be good for the travellers, its on d way to America Fort"
Beautiful ,"We went there, walked, took some photos and we left. The Palace, the view it's beautiful but heaps of rubbish around and in the lake.To many people trying to sell you anything - it's overwhelming and tiring."
Attractive photo stop,"Attractive views from a promenade area - however it is not possible to visit this palace, and from what we understand that is unlikely to change in the short term."
Average,"Jal Mahal is just a palace half submerged in water. You can just take photographs, no entry inside. So plan your itinerary accordingly."
No access to Jal Mahal (Water Palace) but worth a visit to view,"Get to Jal Mahal early and you will see the mist on the water. Very serene, but right by a main road. It was built in the mid 18th century by Madho Singh I. Plenty of birds flock here."
Little disappointed,"I must say, I was little disappointed when I visited Jal Mahal. I pictured that I'll get a tour in it, but."
No access,"Very pretty to look at but unfortunately you cannot get to Jal Mahal or Water Palace. Apparently there are 5 storeys, 4 of them being located under water. There are plenty of birds there and looks like otters in the water. It is a beautiful piece of architecture. There are lots of market stalls there and if you are happy to haggle you can get some bargains. Tuk tuk rides are a bargain, again haggle!"
Nice place,"The place is loo king si so amazing and beautiful,the place of nature is loocking so good,mahal is looks si nice."
Nice view over the lake to Jal Mahal,"Jal Mahal, the water palace is now closed to visitors but one can stop by the road and view the scene. There are lots of birds on the lake such as spot billed pelicans, egrets and cormorants. We didn‚Äôt stay too long due to the usual beggars and hawkers that inevitably are‚Ä¶"
Stunning palace from afar ,"You cannot access this at all It‚Äôs a view across the lake on the way to Amber fort Nice spot to rest, take in the view on the way too or from Amber fort"
Photo opportunity in Rajasthani dress,"On your way to Amer Fort, you can visit Jal Mahal. You can not enter Jal Mahal but it is a photo opportunity.  A lot of vendors give traditional Rajasthani dress on hire and click a photo with Jal Mahal in backdrop. A nice memory."
Traditional rajasthani attire for rent,Palace is surrounded by water. Great place to take ethnic pictures in traditional jaipuri attire. Cost of photo starts from 50 and rentals for attire from 50. 
Disappointed ,Really disappointed with this site. It's very dirty. Rats are running along the water edge its so polluted. We stopped for a couple of mins for a quick pic and straight back in the car. 
Wouldn't make a special trip to see it.,It was very underwhelming. When we were there it was very hazy/smoggy - it may be better at other times but it definitely looks better in the pictures.
Jal mahal review,When i going to jal mahal than their are smell of water is very irritating but the view at lake is very good for spend only 1-2 hours
Good photo opportuniyy,Worth a 15 minute stop on the way to Amber palace. It is inaccessible but makes a good photo. It is about 15 minutes outside Jaipur centre.
Pretty view with mountains behind,"While you're not allowed to go inside, you should certainly stop for a photo. Pretty palace on the water with a mountain backdrop for your photos."
Jal Mahal,You cant actually go to see it up close I believe therefor worth stopping on your way back from Amer Fort! That‚Äôs what we did and it is still nice to see it from the viewing point 
Great place.,One of the major tourist attractions here in Jaipur. You‚Äôre not allowed to go inside so you can only look from outside. The water is very dirty tho! 
water palace,great to see from a distance as not allowed inside... looks neglected when seen during the day . authorities should do more to preserve such historic sites .. absolutely amazing architecture and structure which was built so long ago in water ...amazing ...
Lake Palace !,Jal Mahal is a palace in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur constructed around the 18th century. The palace provides a picturesque view from the land around and  The red sandstone Palace is a five storied structure. We were told by the guide that visitors were not‚Ä¶
nice site,"We went twice, the first time we were on a tour of many sites so we did not get time to have a look at the stalls selling many tourist objects, so we decided to get a rickshaw back so we could buy some bits & pieces to take home, you must be prepared to haggle hard. lovely place‚Ä¶"
Jal mahal,"Such a beautiful and glorifying place to visit. Jal mahal, as the name suggests, is a fort situated in the lake. The illuminting jal mahal at night is a must place to visit."
Beautiful view,"Jal Mahal a beautiful palace in the middle of Man Sagar lake at Jaipur. While crossing the palace, the whole view looks very charming that it attracts people of all ages. Visitors are not allowed to enter the Palace. But you can enjoy the view of the palace by boating in the lake."
Just a place to click photo,Jal Mahal is enroute Amer fort. We can stop here and click couple of photos. There are many street shops out here. Jal Mahal as name suggests it's built in middle of a lake. It's best to visit at night to witness the actual beauty.
Jaipur trip,Nice view of the palace at mid of the lake. Not much to do nor we can visit there. Just a photo place and nice view.
Worth stopping for a photo,This is located on the road to the Amer Fort just outside the city. Would not go out of my way to visit it otherwise. We did visit during the day and prehaps might be better in the evening if it is lit up.
"Inaccessible, dirty lake but worth visit",The lake water is smelly and has garbage. People dont care and throw bottles plastic in it. many food stalls are available nereby. Migratory birds can be seen flying arond including ducks etc.
Beautiful site,The jal Mahal is a beautiful palace in the middle of a lake in north Jaipur. You can go onsite but you can take in the view just off the main north/south road in Jaipur. Just gave your taxi or tuktuk pull over for ten minutes. It‚Äôs very lovely and worth your time. Plus it‚Äôs on‚Ä¶
A quick photo stop,"Also known as the Water Palace it sits in the middle of Man Sagar Lake, many years ago it was supposed to be a duck hunting lodge for the Maharaja built in the 18th century.  It has 5 floors, 4 of them underwater and it is earmarked to become an exclusive restaurant.   Only can‚Ä¶"
Beautiful piece of Architecture and Traditions,"Built in 1745, the Jai Mahal Palace is a stunning piece of Rajasthan‚Äôs heritage, a great example of Indo-Saracenic architecture set amidst 18 acres of landscaped Mughal gardens. Jai Mahal Palace has been the residence of three Prime Ministers of the princely state of Jaipur.‚Ä¶"
Something different,A monument built on a lake. Kudos to the builders though for such a wonderful effort.   You cannot reach the monument or get inside. Only view it from the shores of the lake.
Photo op from the shore ....,"Seems that there is not the opportunity to go out to the palace, but only to photograph it apparently floating on the lake. Pretty enough, but a shame one can't get a closer look."
Beautiful Palace on the Water,"Another attraction that is only for seeing, enjoying and photographing. The Jal Mahal is a place of beauty that cannot be visited. At night it is illumunated, and even more spectacular"
"Nice photo, but lake is kind of gross","It's okay if passing for a quick photo.  The lake (especially where you stand for the photos (by the shore), is kind of gross. Litter etc. Doesnt seem like you can get out there to look at the actual building. So it's really a photo of a palace in the middle of a lake. It's‚Ä¶"
Jal Mahal,"The floating palace in Jaipur - a beautiful building which appears to be floating on the middle of Man Sagar lake. You can only see it from the pavement/roadside - there are also some souvenir stalls along here too. Something free to see, and it‚Äôs definitely worth stopping and‚Ä¶"
Pleasant during the evening,"Good for a visit in the evening. The palace is located in the centre of a lake, no boat ride available to visit it. Can be observed from the pathway constructed around the lake. Beware of hawkers harassing you during your visit. Not a must visit, but you can stop for a few‚Ä¶"
Palace surrounded with Water,"A top class beautiful palace, as their are many in the Rajasthan, but it is unique as it is built in a lake surrounded with water.  Inside visits aren't allowed, but walk on the side path are their for you to feel the monument. The special time to visit this place is to during‚Ä¶"
Fascinating view,"Enjoyed the lovely weather and picturesque view...Only problem , and a big one too, were the few rowdies disturbing the scene...Came to know it is a regular phenomenon here at jalmahal"
Water Palace ,Jal Mahal looks beautiful early in the morning during the sunrise as well as at night with the lights on. You can not go to see inside the Jal Mahal but you can see it from the sidewalk.
Jal Mahal,It's very beautiful palace inside water. I took some great photos with family. best for photography.
Mesmerising view,Just wow.... a visit is a must if you are in Jaipur.  A palace in the middle of a lake....breathtaking.  Nearby camel ride...i love it
Jal mahal market ,"So along the promenade you will find many stalls selling all kinds of souvenir to tourists, many of the see foreigners and triple the price and try to get as much out of u as possible!! But...I came across one lady who was polite and not pushy at all(unlike the other stall holders) she sells the same stuff as the other stalls but her prices are not inflated like the other sellers and she didn‚Äôt see us foreigners as cash cows. I saw something I liked in another stall showed her a photo of the item she went off and within half an hour she came back with the item I wanted and 50% cheaper than the other guys. Seek for out if you don‚Äôt want to be ripped off."
Photojournalist,Europe Palace and sharing best scene at twilight difficult to get to and the unique enough to make a separate trip
Nothing special,It is just a photo station.  U can't go inside..  u have watch it from road. Click few pictures if u are interested else u can skin this.  U can watch this from taxi also..  No need to get down
The View Is What Should Not be Missed,"Visit this place for some open breeze! A nice view, a little street side food, a couple of pictures here and there!! Best time to visit is during evening! "
A palace in water ,"A palace in water. That's the only thing I can tell about this place. You can not visit the inside, but it's pretty beautiful from the street nearby. A place to take some pictures of and leave after 3min."
Floating Palace to the front tourist bazaar behind,"I have read many articles on Jaipur and sites like Jal Mahal, but did not expect how much fun this area would be. The floating palace is lovely and the locals and tourists feeding the ducks and cows, selling their local goods and hanging out was a lot of fun. "
Very nice place for sunrise view,Go here in early morning to get a spectacular view of the Sunrise. Can spend good time in Eve. Get clicked in Rajasthan traditional clothes.
LACK OF CLEANNESS,"It is a good place but not well maintained. the surrounding is very good and quite, good place to chill for some time."
Beautiful palace in the middle of a lake,"The Jal Mahal is a beautiful palace in the middle of the Mansagar lake. It is only a view stoppage as people are no longer allowed to visit the palace since the construction has become weak over the years. Never the less, a good spot for some pictures."
Taj Mahal,"This place was amazing. If you got try to hook up with Rashid, Agra tours on Facebook as the guy is amazing!?"
Shaanti,"Peaceful fort in a jheel , around 15 minutes from my hotel , if you don't go there , there isn't much thay you would miss."
Time wasting place,"Place is just for time wasting, jal mahal is situated in the lake, where it's not allowed to go, only people can see it from the parking area built on lake shore.kids can enjoy rides, buy balloons, people can dress up in traditional attire and can get themselves clicked.its like a road with all road side eating joints."
Beautiful,"It is beautiful, but you can not go inside, but still worth to see. They told us there are some boats that you can use to go around the Jal Mahal main building, but unfortunately we did not find them as our tour leader drop of us in wrong side:(The worst part of our trip was our ""Leader"" from ""Go India"". He wasted our time:("
iconic from a distance,unusual and iconic. lots of street vendors and people asking for money. or to be photographed for money.
Jah Mahal - The Water Palace,Truly remarkable Palace set in the middle of a small lake. I stopped on the main road and got some great photos whilst walking down.  The area was bustling with vendors selling street food and trinkets. I was able to link this into visiting some other key attractions with ease. I definitely recommend checking this place out.
Beautiful,I visited this place in evening and the fort was lit up and was looking really nice in the middle of lake.
Amazing experience,It was amazing visiting Jal Mahal in Rainy season. Everyone must visit in Rainy season. It's highly recommend for newly Wed couple.
VISIT JALMAHAL IN JAIPUR,"Jal means water and Mahal means a palace. So, as the name suggests, JALMAHAL is a lake within which a beautiful palace is built.

Short visit,"It was a rather short visit rather to take a click from the road. Its not allowed to enter inside so we decided not to even take the boat ride rather take a shot from the water body. A nice experience, overall."
Nice view - long,It looks great from a  distance ...the surrondings has a great scope for improvement which can give it a awesome look.
Beautiful fort amidst Beautiful Lake ,"One of the beautiful fort you will witness in Jaipur. But you can see it from the roadside only. Lush of greenery, beautiful lake view around this fort makes it worth to halt for some time here on your Jaipur trip. "
Lovely sight nestled in the water,Saw the Jal Mahal in passing on our way to Amer fort. Nestled in the lake it is a sight to behold. Crowds of tourists and vendors selling their wares and food throng the surrounding area. Looks very pretty.
Good for one click,Do a image search on google for Jal mahal. That's the only view you will see in actual. Boating is prohibited and you can't visit inside. Take a mandatory click from road side and tick mark this place from your bucket list!
Very Beautiful,"I was saw intrigued to see the Jal Mahal (Water Palace). Especially if you go early in the morning or late afternoon- it looks so pristine. Such a beautiful architecture done in the middle of the lake and surprisingly Jal Mahal has a roof top garden- isn't that so interesting.On the side of the road, there are many people selling rajasthani stuffs which is very cheap. I loved shopping out there. Also, they have rajasthani costumes which you can put it on and have the picture taken with Jal Mahal in the background. Just loved the overall atmosphere there."
"Fantastic monument, average enviroment","A must see in Jaipur, but as always let down by the high amounts of pollution and dirt in the surrounding area. Either way, worth a visit!Ps bring your own bread to feed to the wildlife or buy from the vendors on site"
Just one sight seeing,"Old fort in centre of lake, Jal Mahal meaning palace in water. Good view with parking facility and must visit early morning to avoid street sellers or evening to have a different view. It will not take much time to see around. Area surrounding is very dirty and tourism department is not at all active nor the visitors are disciplined."
"Not much to see, simple building in a lake","We drove past here on out way to Amber Fort. not much to see, neither is it a spectacular fort. Taking a photo from the car is enough. They have many opportunities to stop and dress up in traditional attire and take a pic. Bargain for this."
Holiday in india,What a beautiful palace in the center of a lake. I have never seen such beauty. It brings back romantic emotions from long ago and is amazing to see
Jal mahal pink city jaipur,Very nice and excellent place . Like peace of mind . Many Crow in. Evening time but place is good. There are a lake name man Sagar which bulid by Maharaja swai man singh. Veri nice view form here you take photo or selfy here there no charge for that.
Palace in water,It is a beautiful palace built right inside water. It depicts great old heritage of india that how our ancestors or old kings use to live lavish lifestyle. Usually shown from outside to tourists. Must visit if in jaipur.
Beautiful Night time tourism spot,"We were at Trident ( just opposite to Jal Mahal) and staying at a lake view room. So we got to see this monument at different times [Sunrise, early morning while it rained and during night under lights]. - My favorite was in the early morning, under overcast conditions with low rain bearing  clouds covering the mountains overlooking Jal Mahal. - Go there just after dusk. - The monument takes on a different perspective under lightsTraveller Tip- There is nothing much to spend time at this place. You can neither take a boat ride nor go to Jal Mahal. -  Visit this place on your way to Amber fort. If you are going for the sound and light show at Amber fort, drop by Jal Mahal to see it under lights."
So Nice,Lake full of water is so pleasant to watch with this nice piece of architecture in middle and mountain behind. 
Jal Mahal,Jal Mahal  Jal Mahal a palace surrounded by water .palace is in centre of the water body  The view of Lake palace  attracts tourists and it's beauty asks them to visit again.
Scenic place.... Poor upkeep,One of the very few palaces in a lake ... But the place is poorly kept ... The Lake is super  dirty... However the only good things is the scenic view of the palace .... And the history attached to it.. I dont think there is a way to enter the palace via the kake route ...
Unique palace on artificial lake,I stayed at Regenta hotel Jal Mahal opposite the lake. Excellent view from my window. Lovely hotel with rooftop pool and restaurant and polite staff
Bad,The place is dirty not maintained well. govt need to take the urgent action on it.nothing write if you have time visit some fort don't waste time here 
A scenic beauty loosing it's charm,"As the name suggests the Mahal is located in water, with brilliant architecture and scenic beauty. The lake gives the palace the much needed look, but it's the same lake (on the edges/banks) which ruins the show (thanks to all of us, who have not nurtured the beauty, the place is not well kept). With cleaning of the surroundings and a bit of infrastructural developments this place would be great to visit. The rating is purely for the architectural brilliance and picturesque palace."
Another lost opportunity.,"Enroute to amberfort this structure in the middle of lake is an impressive picture.....But that is all......Only worth having a look from the road and clicking photos from the distance ....Because u are not allowed to go there ,water around the palace is not clean,The area around is dirty and poorly managed. Disappointed that a place which has so much of potential is being neglected like this."
Beautiful palace but everything around palace very dirty..,"We had visit to see Jal Mahal -palace. It looks beautiful, but area where we were looking palace was very dirty. Also too many irritating sellers ruins that area.."
Not much to see,It's a palace in the middle of the water body which isn't accessible to the public. One can walk around the promenade and see the Mahal. There are camel and horse rides outside. It's on the way to the amer fort so one can stop for a short visit.
Worth Stopping by,A palace in the middle of the lake - worth stopping for 10 minutes en-route to the Amber Fort. We visited in high summer and the water level was low.
Just to view from far away,Nothing great. Not allowed to go inside. A good view after dark when it it lit. Street shopping can be done here. Watch it on the way after returning back from Amer garh sound and light show
The Water Palace,"On the way to Amber Palace you'll see the Water Palace on your right. Have a stop and look when you return. You only need 10 minutes, but definitely worth it.The man made lake houses this spectacular Palace which was only used for parties and gatherings."
Palace on Water,"Once you visit Amer/Jaigarh fort, when you come back, you can see this palace on water on the left. There is no parking available, so better you have your vehicle parked at the pertol pump and you can watch the palace peacefully. There are lot of hawkers and when it rains, the place is dirty to cross to go near the bridge to take photos. Hence my 3 stars."
Beautiful view,"It is ONE of the important spot TO be visited .good to see nature, children playing around and lots of birds."
Magical Tours of India is truely Magical,"In March, my husband and I visited India for two weeks with Magic Tours of India. We visited Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Udaipur, Ranakpur and one day in Narlai. We had custom designed our tour and it covered all of the things we wanted to see and more because we kept adding things throughout the tour. Magic Tours were able to change our tour if we were told about something that we shouldn‚Äôt miss. Our driver for the whole 2 weeks was Sanjay and he couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. He took us on some back roads so that we could see small villages and people plowing fields with cows and a hand plow. He always knew the best places to stop to eat too. Our tour guide in Jaipur was Nidhi Mishra and she was also magical. She gave us so much cultural history and information and even took us to an Ayurvedic tea shop for a tasting and informative talk. She gave us insights into the religions and customs of various ones and the astrology customs and just so much more. Our tour was seamlessly organized and very professional, with an excellent driver, exceptional guides and accommodation in smaller local B&B type venues. Our whole trip couldn‚Äôt have been more ‚Äúmagical‚Äù!"
Beautiful area to see and take pictures paying nothing,"We liked very much the area where Water Place is located. There is a large boardwalk to take a ride by foot, many artigians selling souvenirs and you can see the Water Palace faraway inside the lake and take pictures only from outside."
Pretty  Beautiful ,Great place to take a photo  Makes you think how the other half lived hundreds of years ago  Very impressive 
Nice but can be more cleaner at the banks,It is incredibly beautiful but the sitting area at the bank stinks. Apart from this it is a nice place to spend some time.
Pretty but . . .,You can only take photos. You can‚Äôt go out to the palace or in the lake. Would love to be able to out to it and inside. Worth seeing for sure. Just disappointed I couldn‚Äôt actually visit. 
Beautiful view only for pics,Jalmahal has beautiful view just for photo clicking. It's four floors r deeped in sea. Night amazing view with evng footpath stalls to purchase at low rates. Cannot go by water till Jalmahal as govt as stopped.
Travel with my sweet love on sweet place.,This trip was really very good.  My love was really very happy. This place choice was my wife. It's nice place.
Worth a view,Another amazing structure of Jaipur built in the middle of a lake. The place can be accessed only by boat but currently not allowed to reach there. Hence you have to see from the edge of the lake only. However its a nice treat  the eyes.
wonderfull,just be there by evening to get fresh air breeze. Amazing place between water. There is small chowpati & camel cart
Worth a quick stop at Jal Mahal ,Jal Mahal sits out in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. Nice place to stop over for a few minutes if you are visiting the amber fort. Entry is not allowed inside the mahal. Worth a quick stop.
Good for a photo stop,Good for a photo stop on your way to or from the Ajmer fort. Not really more to add here. Watch out for locals wanting to earn some rupees for a picture with them.
Weekend Place,A nice place to visit JAL MAHAL or water fort. It is also one of the main tourist spots close to Hawa Mahal and Amber Fort. You can get camel rides here for the kids.
Jal Mahal ,It seems to be an important tourist attraction in Jaipur. But all you can see is- a mahal from the shore. Not opened to public but a mahal in the middle of the lake. No parking or entry fee. 15 minutes is sufficient to witness!
Water fort,Lovely palace between water. There is having a boardwalk to see the palace. Although boats are there to see it. But dont know how to book.
Serene environment,"Beautiful place to hang out , we went in the evening weather was just perfect, we walked for hours around the palace, amazing view. Tips : Bring comfortable shoe, umbrella, water, scarf etc. There are lots of street shops to buy food and other gifts from. Camel ride available."
Beautiful,Thoughthere was less water at the water place but it has so much of peace and tranquility It is on the way to Am er form and u can wear the typical Rajasthani dresses and get clicked 
The Birthday Celebration,Hello everyone.       So if you are planning to visit jaipur as a couple you guys must have to visit jal mahal and the mansagar lake(behind jal mahal) in rainny season beacuse at this time you will get the actual beauty of jal mahal and the peace with rain. For me that was one of the best place from jaipur. The way to mansagar lake is like a heaven. The peace and the beauty attract you to spend the more time over there. In the end go visit as a couple and have fun. You will get the satisfaction on an Extreme level.
Great late afternoon photos ,"As far as I could tell, all you can do is look at the Jal Mahal from the lakeside. So it really is just a view and a place for photos.Go in the late afternoon when the golden sun falls onto it making the facade shine a bright yellow. Honestly, if you go in the morning you'll wonder what all the fuss was about!"
Beautiful to look at but can't touch it.,Palace on the lake. This is worth the brief and convenient stop to take in the view. I was told by my guide that it is closed to the public and only accessible by boat for private and important functions. Reminds me of the palace on the lake in Octopussy but this is not the same one
Jaipur Trip with my son,"This is a beautiful palace in the lake, it‚Äôs such a shame you can‚Äôt go in it or at least get a boat trip around it to get better photos. But you can from the side of the lake"
Nice,Jal Mahal Jaipur is Jaipur one of the best Mahal it's around in Lake and lots of water and what a feeling it was lovely
good to see,its was middle point to go amer. water was very spoil there. fish was also there we feed them. good spot cor taking photographs.
Worth a stop in Jaipur,"The water palace as the name and pictures suggest is located in the middle of a lake.  You can't go in, only view it from the shore but it is worth a stop to wander along the shore and marvel at it.  You can also see it from the road at the top of the hill on the way to Nahargah Fort where you get some excellent scenic views looking down on it"
Jal Mahal,Jal Mahal is located in Jaipur and it is in water. People can stand on the banks of the lake and can watch this famous Mahal but no one has permission to enter the place.
Mahal in Lake...,It was located in front of our Hotel... You can't go in but just see it from a distance.. looks beautiful at night with lights on...
Beautiful to look at..,Palace on the lake. Unfortunately there is no way in or on this palace / temple you can only look from the side line really. But was really nice to see. It‚Äôs a pity they don‚Äôt put work in to this as I think it could be a huge tourist attraction!
Can only be seen from a distance,"The Water Palace can only be seen from a distance as it is not open to visitors. Our guide told us tho that there are plans to transform it into a hotel with a rooftop restaurant. It's near Amber Fort, so it's worth it to stop for a few minutes and take some pictures."
Water palace that can be seen from far distance,This place can be seen from a far distance as you are not allowed to go nearby. Nice place to stop over for a few minutes if you are visiting the amber fort
Water Palace,It is a beautiful palace in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Pinkcity. This palace is not open to visitors but still a popular tourist destination and the view in evening is mesmerizing.
Awesome place,It's very beautiful especially in the evening. The view is mesmerizing.The vibes are energetic. Totally romantic aura around.
Beautiful location,Great building on the lake in Jaipur with nice photo opportunity as one can't get to the site. Worth a quick stop.
Stinky and Smelly,Way to stinky and dirty that it used to be few years back. You cannot go anywhere near Lake. Erickshaw can bring this place to stand still at any time.
Beautiful can‚Äôt wit for restaurant to open ,"We did not realise that you can only view from across the water and cannot visit , believe that a lot of money is being pumped in by UNESCO to Jaipur and a restaurant will be developed so you can actually visit ! "
Entry is prohibited inside the JAL Mahal,"This place was on my to do list in Jaipur, however was sorely disappointed by the fact that entry is prohibited inside the JAL Mahal. The palace is surrounded by water from all sides so whatever you see from the lake shore is what you get."
Loved this,"It was a really stunning setting, just so magnificent with the lake and sunset a real treasure , I would recommend"
Evening stroll ,"The majority of locals seem to go here later in the afternoon/evening. You'll get the usual hawkers & street vendors, but also an opportunity to chat to curious locals & maybe even have a hit of cricket. "
Jaipur's Royal Wonder!,"On our trip to jaipur we stopped at Jal Mahal on our way back from amber mahal. The Jal Mahal Palace is built in the middle of a lake, and is now left to itself for such a long time that trees have grown over them. The lake‚Äôs water is somewaht polluted, but nevertheless home to a few wading Black Winged Stilts and a large number of pigeons. We spent the evening near the lake waiting for the sun to go down and the warm day turn into a cold dusk, before heading back to the city."
Summer palace of the king!!,"Its a shame that you can go upto or inside the mahal, but it makes for some great photos from the promenade or even when you are climbing upto Jaigarh or Nahargarh forts."
Nice place to visit ,Now a days Jal Mahal is becoming tourists attraction place but in summer days one should avoid to go in day time when temperature is high
Makes a great photo,Jal Mahal sits out in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. It was a maharajah hunting lodge. At present you can't reach it from the shore. There is talk of developing it as a restaurant or hotel. We were happy to view it and take a lovely photo
Good,Good place to visit during summers.. there are very few places of water in jaipur.. as its rajasthan and its dessert area so there is very few places and jal mahal is one.. there is mahal which is built middle of the water .. and its closed now we can't go to that palace .. but its nice place to sit with your buddies and chit chat & for having fun Also this place is loved by many photolovers people üòÄ
Jal Mahal...Just few minutes stop by,"To visit ghe Jal Mahal is very easy. Just take the 3 wheels taxi there. It's really cheap no more than 200INR. from Holiday Inn Hotel, jaipur. But, You can take photos just beside the lake only. It's good to stop by and take a photo. Then, jump in the car and go to another place. üïçüå∏üöñ"
Water palace ,"We stopped here on the way back from amber fort for a couple of minutes to take photos, it is a beautiful scenery."
Nothing special,I went with an expectation to see something very unique abd beautiful.1st you cant enter jal mahal and no boats in that lake to see2nd it is just a building in filthy water3rd the smell is terrible at that area4th you can plan to see if you are willing to see the fort
Palace on water!!,"It's a beautiful palace located at Chowpatty of Jaipur. It looks stunning, thought it looks better when the water in the lake is full. Entry is not allowed so you can click photos from outside which doesn't fails to give a loving view."
No entry to Jal Mahal,"There is no entry to Jal Mahal. No Boating. Only you can roam around the lake and spend money on photography. Since visit to Jal Mahal is not allowed, it should not be shown as a place of visit for tourists."
Beautiful from the distance,"A real shame there is no boats on the lake, that would definitely be popular with all the tourist. Still nice for a photo stop especially if the birds are in and around the lake."
Nice place,"Jal mahal (fort) is a mahal covered with water from all side, it's a beautiful architecture, toursist are not permitted to inside but can enjoy from out side, must see place in Jaipur"
Awesome view post sunset and moon lit night with lake and hill in the back drop,The view in moonlit night and the evening stoll in the pavement beside the lake is awesome. The mahal is lit up with lights and it appears as a crown inside the lake. It sould had been great if there had been a provision for the boat ride.
A delicious restaurant ,"Our driver dropped us there for lunch during the way back from Amber Fort. We saw there have some good comments on food on a website. That‚Äôs why we gave a try. I forgot to take the pictures of food because I was so hungry and the food was delicious, haha. The price is inexpensive. Recommend it üëçüèº"
Can only see from the road,"A palace surrounded by water. It looks so great and the visitors are not allowed to the palace, so you can only view from the road. If you have good binoculars or camera lense, you can see some of the detail of the fort. Worth a 15 minute stop and see."
Breath taking view,Lake Palace sits beautifully in the middle of the lake on the road leading to Amer Fort. While you cannot visit the palace you can soak it's beauty while walking on the broad promenade built by the side of the lake.As sun sets the whole palace is lit up and this is a stunning‚Ä¶
Busy,I wouldn‚Äôt say this place is a must but do visit it. However be prepared of people trying to sell you something every second. Very busy place and a lot hustle and bustle. 
Terrible!,"The water was suuuper dirty with dead bird and i'm not even talking about the smell! Full of people trying to sell you things, the temple is super far and you see absolutly nothing. I've stay 2 min and go back. Super far from everythings too. Not worth it. "
Great Buiding,Another worthwhile building to see in the kaleidoscope of what India is. Their monuments from the Mogul Empire live on to the present day. O! Please make sure to keep your fluid intake up while traveling India. Mike Singapore*****
Great Place to Experience,"Jal Mahal is a place where, people can't say they are in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Which is known for it's desert and hot weather conditions. But it's totally different, having a lake and cold winds were blowing, So had a great time there. Most recommended Place to visit in Jaipur.‚Ä¶"
Palace in Water- Jal Mahal ,This is a wonder for foreigners and Indians. Those who haven‚Äôt visited yet. I recommend to visit in your next trip to Jaipur.
Pretty scenery,"It looks like a beautiful palace from land. It‚Äôs definitely worth stopping to take a picture because it is so unique. Unfortunately, as other reviews said, you cannot see inside. "
Very pretty, I only wish we could look closer than the car park where the touts lay in wait. No I don‚Äôt want to buy .... I just want a photo. I understand this is still private property but no less photogenic if you manage to bypass the colour of India for a few seconds. 
Holiday,"Fantastic tour just let down by the hotel. The Royal Orchid, it is a budget hotel not a 5 star , The palace is lovely but needs money spending on it"
Disappointing,Our driver stopped to show us this palace which was in the distance and in the middle of a lake. Before the viewing I thought it was similar to the Golden Palace where you could go inside which begs the question is this monument in good condition inside or is it being left to‚Ä¶
A good view from distance,"We stopped by this monument while going from Amer to Jaipur city.it is a beautiful yellow color building inside a large water body. Unfortunately you can not see it inside. It is also reported to be sinking and under poor maintenance, yet a place to stop by and have a look."
Water palace,"Pretty sight and scenery, wish we could see the palace inside. Nevertheless, view of the location is still nice but a little dirty due to garbage people throw into the man made lake."
How is this even a place to visit???,"This is just a kothi in middle of the lake. One has to see it from the shore. You can't even say you visited it since you can take only photos from the lake shore. It is definitely ok to miss ""attraction""."
Beautiful and abandoned!,You can only see this lovely floating palace from the bank as the building was taken over by the Indian government which means it is now abandoned and neglected.  The construction is amazing as the water around and underneath the building is used to cool the air inside in summer‚Ä¶
Beautiful ,"It‚Äôs beautiful and looks the best in evenings since it is lit up, also on the side there a nice market to shop for knick knacks."
"Photo stop, not visit",This is a photo-opportunity place as the palace appears to be inaccessible / not open for visits.It looks great out on the water.Lots of pelicans added to the interest
Great photo op - but no access,We actually had a better than expected stop here. Great photo op of the palace in the middle of the lake. No access so just a photo op. When we were there it was kite festival time and we had a great time wandering around watching cultural dancing and listening to live music. With out that however this is just a quick stop.
Ideal for a brief stopover,"Jal Mahal provides an almost perfect stopover on the main Amer road and has large number of ethnic toys, jewelry and coconut water vendors. The view to Jal Mahal is not that impressive though as the edges of the lake as laced with garbage, with cows patrolling the lake borders for food."
Worth a photo stop,It appears this building has been partially restored and is now subject to a dispute over the changes made.   Viewed from the edge of the lake it still looks impressive but there is no access available. We stopped to take pictures and were soon on our way again.
Marvel,An amazing and beautiful construction in a small pond which houses a garden with full grown trees on the rooftop
Amazing Sight,You can view the Jal Mahal from the road as well as from the Amber Fort. Built in red stand stone it is almost completely surrounded by water and looks wonderful in the reflection in the water. The towers on the corners and the covered wind room look magical in the evening too.‚Ä¶
Trip,"Good place, can enjoy.. It was breezy during evening tym, otherwise not much to see, u can see from ur respective vehiclwle"
beatufil,"this place is has amazing view. at the centre of the lake, admist the mountains, beautiful sunset, flocking birds- it give amazing view to the eyes. you can also relax here and feed fish. its on the way to amber fort"
I liked around here because of the open place and view,"sometimes, you need to be with people and see what admires them to be here. good surroundings, amazing architecture, and water the love of my life."
Beautiful evening,"Located admist hill and at centre of the lake , the place looks beautiful during the sun set. Its on the way to Amer. You can enjoy evening local brich here while relaxing feeing to lake fish."
amazing veiw,"the historic site is on the way to amber fort and its really beatiful to look at in the sun setting view. you cam realx here, feed fish in the lake and enjoy the serenity there."
You only see the top floor of five!,Fascinating building that has survived for so long despite being mainly under water. Restoration work is ongoing so can't be visited at present.
look pretty beautiful,"its on the way to amber fort. one does not need to take another route. the place looks beautiful during evening where you can watch sunset, flocks of birds flying. sit and enjoy while feed the fish of the lake"
view is mesmerizing,"Jal mahal is surrounded by water it looks stunning from out side. entry is not allowed inside the mahal. there are many food stalls at the road side.it is situated near by kanak ghati, on the way of amber fort.evening time is perfect to visit."
Only viewable from the side of the lake,This is nice to see on your way past but don't expect much. You can't go across to it and apparently it is empty.
Nice view,Nice view and close by the city. Can easily be reached by tuk tuk. Recommend to see on the way to or from amber fort
You can not go inside,It's like Hawa mahal. Better view is from outside only. Just want to chill and relax you can go there.
Nice place amidst lake ,Nice and picturestique place . Lake is also beautiful with lots of migratory birds . Good for photography .Also can get local Rajasthani dress to wear and take photos at 100 or 150 rupees per photo .
Picturesque view during full moon night,"Jal Mahal provides a picturesque view during full moon evening, The place is not accessible since it is in the middle of the water."
"Nice palace to see, but not accessible","The Jal Mahal or the Palace on Water is among the most popular attractions in the city of Jaipur. The palace lies on a lake known as the Man Sagar Lake and is surrounded by the Aravalli hills on 3 sides. Located in close proximity to the Amber and Jaigarh Forts, the Jal Mahal should be combined with a visit to these places.The government has built a mini-promenade on the shore of the lake, from where one can see the palace. Entry to the promenade is free. Unfortunately, the palace itself is not accessible to visitors, as there is no boating facility available. Hopefully, once it is renovated, visiting the palace could become a reality,"
Cool to see quickly,"This is a great place to see quickly. There are a lot of vendors trying to get to buy everything under the sun, so it's pretty annoying to spend time there as a foreigner. The palace looks really pretty, seeming to float there in the water, and I love how there are trees growing‚Ä¶"
Lake full of rubbish,"We stopped to take a photo on the way back from Amber fort. In the photo it looks beautiful, but when actually there, all we could notice was the incredible amount of rubbish littering the lakeshore. It was so disgusting that we wished we hadn't bothered to stop."
Family trip to jaipur,This palace does not have public entry but one can see it forma distance. The palace is drinking slowly inside the lake.
A monument of glory wasted by our pathetic attitude of littering,This place is a classic example of people and government doing their best to make a garbage pile out of a historical monument. We do not deserve this piece of history.
Iconic Palace in the Lake,An iconic Palace in the lake of Jaipur with a mesmerising look in night with lights and glow a must visit place in Jaipur
"Lovely to see, but unfortunately can‚Äôt access it",We visited Jal Mahal on a lovely sunny day. The palace looked beautiful from the viewing points.  Unfortunately it is no longer in use and has not been maintained.  It has been left to the elements and is no longer safe to enter. Such a shame.
Government owned & closed,"This is a cock up.Closed, inaccessible and bought by the government which now has to pay to maintain it.Privatised, it will be a success. As it is, photogenic at a distance but we wonder what dilapidation lies behind those handsome facades?"
Viewing area dilapidated,Jal mahal previously a duck hunting lodge for the king lies on an island in a large lake. It is inaccessible but can be viewed from the shoreline. Stinking discoloured water flows into the lake and food is for sale to feed  the birds and ducks around the area. Many pavement sellers offering the usual souvenirs regularly moved on by police. I thought the trip a waste of time. The government needs to clean this area to avoid it being ruined forever.
Mal Mahal,this is about 6 km from Jaipur in the Amber road. One can plan the visit on the way to Amber fort. This is actually a Mahal in a lake. As the entry to the Mahal is not allowed. The benders in the vicinity offers a great display of fashionable items. there are a lot of birds. There are fishes in the lake. People do offer food to the fishes in the lake.
good for evening walk and shopping,"good for evening walk and shopping, food stalls available here for evening snacks, cheap shopping, quality okie.. visit all stalls before buying finally, one neckless we buy at 180 after bargaining, same was available after 10 stalls for 150 without bargain"
Mrs Poulton,"Excellent restaurant service from all of the wonderful staff; exquisite food and a wonderful attention to customer care. Thank you to Kalyan, Sana and Sabina, especially. Magnificent rooms and a true sense of harmony and peace in every corner of this gloriously restful hotel."
Awesome,Unbelievable monument. Just fantastic. Thinking that how people built this structure in olden days. Wow
Bad experience good place ,Even though the food is good but the service doesn‚Äôt match. The non veg is just not good but veg food is fab. Only come here after making sure that u have enough time. Since it takes ours.
Exam day,The place came  at the end of jaipur city .Its the best place to see the heritage monument.Jal mahal one of the best place to visit.Crowd is very high at any time people visiting Jaipur always come here .The place don t need any tickets or anything else .one can have snacks and can do shopping there.
Exotic,This palace viewed from the road seems to float  in the lake. Sadly it is not open to the public due to a court case over ownership.
Beautiful from distance,We only got to see this from mile away.We were told corporate is in process of acquiring property and making it a hotel. Congrats to them  Corporate greed
Awesome,What a lovely view of the Mahal built in the center of the lake. I was disappointed a bit as there was no boating there. But on the whole it is awesome
JAL MAHAL,closed for public entrance.You can have a distant view of this partly submerged architecture from a distance.
Beautiful,Beautiful summer palace of queen. You cannot visit inside only view from banks of lake. Great promenade along wuth street vendors. Also lit up at night
this has become the Hotel now and very prohibitive cost. Just a visual from a distance would do,"We actually had a visual from outside and did not make time to go inside as it has become a hotel.  But the Beauty of the Architecture needs to be seen and enjoyed.  Very serene place, being surrounded by water."
Mahal Having water on all side,Jal mahal is called jal because it is having water in hindi jal on all side and mahal is at center of the water beautiful view to see
Jal Mahal,"Jal Mahel is not a big place to visit. just a mahal made in between water. but the architecture of this mahel is good. on the bank of this jal mahel there is so many things to purchase like clothes, jewellery etc with low budget price. you have to do little bar genning for little more less price. best time to visit this place is evening time."
"Nice to look at, but does not have much to offer","While my family and I were touring in Jaipur, I learnt the story of the Jal Mahal and how the king built it for his wife. Hearing about it got me excited to see it, but after stopping our car, and seeing it from afar, I was kind of disappointed. It looks okay from the road, but there is no way to actually go to it. In my opinion the Jal Mahal's history is much more interesting than the structure itself."
Impressive from the roadside,"This the ""Water Palace"" is within a lake and cannot be accessed for viewing, which is a pity.  So the closest you can get is by the roadside, shared with a large number of hawkers pushing their standard tourist tat.  However, it's good for a 10 minute stop on the way back from Amber Fort."
amazing,We were captivated by the this amazing historic site. Will recommend this place to anyone to visit. It is indeed a magical and impressive view.
Nice Scenic Palace,"The Palace is not open for general public to visit, one can only stand in front of it and enjoy its view, lately its not been well kept by the authorities, the water is full of weed and there is nothing special about the place, except the view it offers."
Jaipur trip jal mahal,"Jal Mahal was built during the 18th century in the middle of Mansarovar Lake. This is one of the biggest artificial lakes in Jaipur, which was constructed using red sandstone. It is a five-storey structure built in Mughal and Rajasthani architectural styles. The Jal Mahal was‚Ä¶"
Palace in the water...,The palace which is located in the middle of the lake....üïå‚õ≤üïç‚õ™... ... ..... Nice place for sunset point with loved one... You can buy local items near this palace. This place is more attractive if it allowed boating around the palace. ...
Nice place to take a photo,Looks like it would be an impressive location to visit if it was possible .  Visit in the afternoon when the smog of india dissipates if you want a nice photo.  
Stunning,"Stopped off for some photos of Jal Mahal and the wildlife, great architecture. Make sure you keep away from the part where the water/drains flow into the lake. Great views of the Pelicans. Well worth a stop."
One of a kind,The Jal Mahal was made by one of the kings as a recreational place. Many other kings would be invited for a stay. Artisans have soulfully worked around every aspect of this masterpiece. A must visit for those who love history.
A great piece of Architechture with b'ful looks,"A great piece of architechture that builds inside the water... Great sense of peace and beautiful location for photography...footpath shops at Jal Mahal gives you variety of material like decoration, jaipuri designer suits and kurtis for shopping.. one can also taste variety of eatables there."
Visit if you like water bodies !!,Nice place in Jaipur to spend a quiet evening if you are fond of water bodies. It is enroute to the Amber Fort. This place sees maximum visitors in the evening. There are number of street vendors selling ice cream etc.
Very cool,"Very neat palace in the middle of a lake. We were told it used to be open to the public, but it is now closed. They said it was haunted, not sure how much of that is true. It was beautiful to see. I would have loved to see the inside though. There was also a large food and trinkets market here."
Amazing sight,This is just a quick stop on the way to or from the Amber Fort. The palace is in the middle of the lake and looks like it is flooded. The palace is not open to the public and the view is free.The view is amazing as the lake is also surrounded by mountains.
Go only in Evening to enjoy,"The Palace itself is inaccessible, but the street itself has great view. Specially when lights in evening are turned on. The small chowpati sort of feeling, with good bargain stalls to buy traditional stuff."
Jalmahal,It's a historical place in Jaipur. It's nice to see in sun set time.  In night time it looks so beautiful 
Excellent Attraction For Your Family,"This was an excellent place to chill out and enjoy the beauty of JalMahal. It gives you a feeling of how old emperor used to enjoy life the fullest as a tyrant.  There are many options for street food, pictures and chai on the Vista point. You can also take a picture by renting‚Ä¶"
"Like a Moon. ""Can see, Can't Reach""","This Palace is situated right in the Centre of Man Sagar Lake, on the outskirt of Jaipur City. You may visit this place on your way to Amer Fort or Jaigarh Fort. You can see this Palace from distant only, you can't reach here. All photo shoot from lake side only. For Sightseeing‚Ä¶"
So nice palace,You can just watch it from a far. But there is nice view to palace with big lake. So many waterfowl. But we did not like the rush of people. 
In the midst of the lake,"Jail Mahal, literally meaning Water Palace, is stunted I the midst of the Man Sagar lake. The palace appeared to be single storied, but we understand that four floors of the palace are under water. It is a beautiful example of Rajputi architecture, visible all over Rajasthan. On‚Ä¶"
Nice for photos from afar ,Not a place you can actually visit so focus on the pictures you can take from afar.  once you‚Äôve taken the pictures you can enjoy a nice walk through the market vendors that are set up along the strip.  A good place to buy souvenirs and make sure to hustle on the prices.  
On the way to Amber Fort,"Good that it is located on the way to or from the Amber fort. It‚Äôs a nice area, quite touristic but worth a stop. Scenic pictures possible. The lake with the water castle canalso be seen from top of Nahargarh fort, great views. Afterdark it is lit up. The coconut water we had‚Ä¶"
Nice food,"It was best experience ever, niodoubt all chef are magician of food, I would recomond this place to my friends, it was valuable visit"
Nothing wow,Went to see the place and there was nothing wow... There was no way of getting in there but instead just take photos from a distance... The market in front of it was okay... 
Beautiful from afar!,"This is a beautiful and fascinating building, we visited in December when three storeys of it was underwater so we viewed it from across the water. You can't enter it during the winter as it's surrounded by water but I believe you can walk to it in the summer. Amazing!"
Located in middle of the lake ,"Well it's located in the middle of a lake, you can take a look and shots from your camera from the shore which is just beside the main road. Nothing great about it ."
Nice view ,"Nice view, but nothing more than that. You can't visit, so it's just a building in the water. Nothing more"
Another Photo Opt!!,Jal Mahal located in the middle of the city and a photo opportunity wont be missed. Currently closed for public visits but can be viewed from the main street sea wall. Stop over for quick photo session for this place gets busy.
Holiday,Great place to Visit and loved a lot the moments with my frend I really loved the view and things so beautifulüòçüòç
