Turquoise water on black rock,"This waterfall stood out for me among many I saw in Iceland. It was big and powerful, but main thing for me were colours and contrast between them. Turquoise water on black rock. Almost passed it but I'm glad I stopped there."
Just Go!! ,"Upon approach to the waterfall, I did not know what to expect at all but when you walk over to get waterfall it is just breath taking! We spent around 45 minutes walking around the waterfall and it was just spectacular and words cannot describe just how beautiful it is. Unbeknown to me my partner proposed to me on the eastern side of the waterfall and I couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful and picturesque location to start this new chapter together. If you are in are in the area you must visit and witness this wonder yourself."
Great views,"Great views, but other falls are better. We went in the evening, and you can get great photos with the sunset."
"Beautiful, photo tip","Stopped as part of our Iceland tour. While not as huge and powerful as the Gullfoss, this waterfall is beautiful with its horseshoe shape.As you go up the left side, keep a look out on the right of the path for some steps which take you down to the water level. It's rocky down there but you can take photos from a different angle. Just beware the sun will be behind the falls so perhaps not so good on a Summer afternoon.If you found my review helpful I would appreciate your vote."
Beautiful waterfall ,The waterfall is stunning Green water.Easy to access from the road.Excellent for photos.Definitely worth visiting.
"Beatufull, but remember a hat","Even though we were there in late july it was very cold. The scenarie is fantastic, but wear good and warm clothes. The chilren were anxious to get back to the heated car."
Amazing spot,Very nice! To be visited !Wonderful landscape... an easy visit for family with kids.Don't hesitate to have a look
Impressive waterfall even in winter,The waterfall was great even in winter. the water flow is so massive and the walk is safe. You can have a clear view of the waterfall and it is on your way while doing the ring.
nice place,"Nice place. The waterfall was mostlly frozen. I recommend the use of crampons to get there, its a windy place and with ice on the floor it can get dangerous"
Pretty waterfall,"Another pretty Icelandic waterfall. This one is right next to the ring road between Myvatn and Akureyri. Not as big as Dettifoss or Skogafoss, but still worth the visit. Has a large (souvenir) store."
"Beautiful, and a pleasant walk","We enjoyed the walk to and around the falls, though of course you're sharing the view with countless other people. The nice thing is that you can go down some stairs and get right next to the water for interesting photos. There's a shop on premises with souvenirs and snacks, and they even have bathrooms! Really just a lovely stop on our journey."
Spectacular.,"In Iceland, anything worth seeing, equires a walk..... but always worth the effort.Not a large waterfall, but one with a lot of character."
Awesomely beautiful,"Incredible waterfall. Like the name says, the waterfall of the gods.  You can walk along both sides of the waterfall and get great pictures. Magnificent view . One minute from the ring road, you can find the parking spot and with a five minute walk you can be in the viewpoint of this extreme beauty place.A rugged, majestic and beautiful place.  Breathtaking waterfall, not to be missed."
Fantastic sight,Visited here in March 2020 complete with ice and snow. Amazing sight and views.  Safe view points and guard rails. Beautiful
Magical,absolutely beautiful.  It was super cold and cutting wind but was worth every second.  Simply Breathtaking
Waterfall trip,"Amazing view on the largest waterfall of Europe.If you arrive early not many tourists, after 09.30am it becomes crowds. Very impressed about these forces of nature!"
Fabulous waterfall,No bus loads of tourists when I went there yesterday. Not like the crowds on the golden circle waterfalls.
Frozen in time,"Wow what a breathtaking place. Definitely a highlight of my trip. We were here in winter and the falls were partially frozen, amazing to see. The water is aqua and clear."
"Beautiful, and not too many tourists","One of my favourite waterfalls in Iceland! Not too many tourists visit (at least, compared to down south), so it is easy to take photos without people in them. The falls remind me of Niagara Falls in Canada. I've visited in both summer and winter. In the summer, you can go down a set of stairs to experience the waterfall up close. In the winter, the staircase is closed, but I think the falls look more impressive, as part of it freezes into stunning icicles."
Must See in Northern Iceland,"We were little disappointed that both roads to Dettifoss were closed...However, Godafoss is conveniently located right off the main highway.  And in February, there were only few folks taking pictures.  Big difference from the South Coast waterfalls.  It is bit smaller than I imagined, but still impressive."
Amazing waterfalls,Frozen Niagara...amazing sight but it is cold..Wrap up warm the wind chill is biting.Lots of people wearing inappropriate clothing for the conditions.Best things ever...invest in walking grips for your shoes. We bought them in the UK for under £20.You can walk without fear ...cant recommend enough
Amazing ,All I can say is it was amazing!! Definitely worth going on a trip to see this place. You don't stay long but there's definitely a reason why it's called waterfall of the gods.
Fab ,Great to see the falls from both sides of the river. We were pleased we did venture to both sides as the falls looked different from both angles.Easy to follow paths.This afternoon one side was very snowy and the path not fully accessible but nevertheless it was possible to see some of it
Truly Magical Waterfall,I am lucky enough to live 45 minutes from this amazing waterfall but I never tire of visiting it.  Usually accessible all year around but spiked overshoes are a must on icy days.  If possible view from both sides but beware that the West side car park is sometimes closed by snow in Winter.  A must-see if you are in the North of Iceland.
Beautiful,A short walk and you are at this waterfall. It was beautiful even in winter when us was partially frozen over.
Gushing with emotions ,We visited on a cold day when my nose was running as much as the water fall. The winter back drop made this natural beauty ‘pop’. Absolutely gorgeous and worth a visit.
Oozing with appeal. ,"It's a grand, wild and crazy good time. It's really easy to get there and it's just wonderful. How can you say anything bad about a waterfall? You can't!"
Majestic,"This was the first of many waterfalls I saw in Iceland, and it sets the bar very high. It's a majestic sight and apparently even features in Game of Thrones but I can't place it."
"Godafoss, the waterfall of the gods","This is an impressive waterfall with a semi circular shape about a 100 feet wide, one of the biggest in Iceland. Water falls from about 40 feet down."
Godafoss Waterfalls Where you feel the greatness of nature o(^-^o),"The place where I wanted to go since I knew the name of ""God’s Falls"".I felt the great presence and enormous energy of the waterfall.I saw many waterfalls in Iceland, but I like this one best."
Amazing view,this is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Iceland; you can park on either sides and walk along the pathways to enjoy stunning views. you won't stop taking pictures!
One of Iceland's many BEAUTIFUL waterfalls!,"A short walk from either of the parking areas on each side of the Falls.  Usually the left side, across the bridge, is less crowded.  It was well below freezing so the the ice buildup around the falls made it that much more beautiful.  One of the easiest to get to in this part of Iceland!"
Stunning,This was an absolutely stunning sight to see. Absolutely make the trip if you're up north! We only had about 30 minutes but would have love hours here.
Scenic Stop,"Godafoss is a beautiful stop. You can spend as much time as you desire, from less than 30 minutes to a few hours. The paths around the waterfall are an easy walk, mostlly paved or groomed. Another plus is that there is a great gift shop across the highway. One of the best highway gift shops we stopped in. It also has refreshments."
Beautiful,"We arrived at 3am during the midnight sun, there was noone there but us. Absolutely breathtaking and feel truly blessed to have experienced it without hundreds of tourists. Must see!"
One of Iceland's natural wonders,This is not the most spectacular but worth a stop. It is just off the main road with ample free parking. It only takes a few minutes to get to the best views. It is not particularly high but very broad.
Godafoss first waterfall,"We cruised in to Akureyri and this was our first tour of Iceland. The scenery on the way to the falls is stunning, vast. The falls themselves were really nice. great location, easy to walk to, you can choose either side, upper path or lower path. great pics too"
Goðafoss is famous and magnificent.,"We were advised to see it from both sides. In my opinion the east side has better view of the falls. We also followed a short hiking trail down to the river level to view the falls from its base and then went to a bluff to see the falls from its top. It's a must stop, but don't miss a spectacular (and significantly less crowded) Aldeyjarfoss with its beautiful bent basalt columns, which is only 45 minutes away."
Magnificent; don't miss it.  Be sure to view Godafoss from both sides.s.,Truly a gift to mankind.  Simply beautiful.  You walk along the river downstream to approach the falls.  Be sure to take time to experience Godafoss from both sides of the river.
One of the greats of nature,"We visited whilst touring from Akureyri.  The falls are an easy walk (about 1/3rd of a mile) from the car park, the path is well maintained with a slight incline.  You can walk to both sides of the falls as there is bridge by the visitor centre.  If you have the time it's good to see the falls from each aspect.  Definitely worth a visit.  The gift shop at the visitor centre is quite good for souvenirs and coffee and cake if you are a little peckish."
Don't miss it,"Godafoss is very easy to get to. It’s right by the Ring Road 30 minutes from Akureyri. It’s very accessible from the parking lot. The paths to the viewing platforms are well paved that can accommodate wheelchairs and strollers. There are two parking lots which take you to either the east side or west side of the falls with different views. The two sides are connected by a foot bridge, or you can move your car from one parking to another. I suggest visiting both sides for complete views of the falls. If you’re on a tight time schedule, then go for the east side which is the 2nd parking lot if coming from Akureyri. This is the bigger parking lot with bus parking; and there’s a coffee shop, accommodation and washroom facilities. The platform on the east side gives you a full perspective of the falls from the top. Also from the east side, you can walk down a slope to the rocky beach close to the bottom of the falls for a different view.While Godafoss can’t compare with the powerful Dettifoss and Gullfoss, it’s beautiful in its own way. I found it much less crowded than Gullfoss, and way easier to get to than Dettifoss, so don’t miss it when you’re in Akureyri/Lake Myvatn area.There were heavy rains the days before we visited, so the water looked very muddy. It would have been even more spectacular if the water was clearer."
impressive waterfall,"We visited here smack in the middle of a snow storm which took a bit of the excitement away from the experience.  It was positively freezing when we arrived but we still couldn't help but notice the beauty of the falls... especially during the sunrise.  I'd like to visit again during more friendly weather conditions so we're not so rushed to take our photos and split.  For now, this rates as an average TA review and experience for us."
Awesome sight,This Godafoss is breathtaking.  The volume of water coming over the falls is unbeiieveable.  It is a must see when in Iceland.
One of many spectacular waterfalls viewed in Iceland,Godafoss was the first of many spectacular waterfalls that we viewed on our trip to Iceland.  There was a nice easy trail to walk from the parking lot to the best viewing of the falls.
Stunning,"Godafoss is a must see in Iceland, a majestic landscape.It is very easy to reach via car.  September was a good time to visit as it wasn't too busy and the weather was mild."
Unmissable,"Very impressive falls, skip the cafe. Easy walk except trail down to area in front of the 'horseshoe falls' is uneven/rocky in places. Abour an hour to see the whole area from both sides of the river. Cafe very expensive and crowded. Falls highly recommended."
Viking History! Beautiful geology!,"So this is where the Vikings dumped their “idols” when they had a change in their religious and belief system. They didn’t mess around and had no intention of being able to retrieve them again. Water: clear and blueGeology: columnar jointing, the water has eaten through the basalt and exposed som awesome and possible collapsed entries into lava tubes or just lava formations caused by gas bubbles downstream if you observe the past rock formations.Best view: I would take the first parking lot for godafoss. You get a front view of the falls. Otherwise you get a side view and actually can’t see it as well."
Big and Powerful,"We stopped here even though it was raining, cold and windy.  We bundled up and took the walk to the falls and tried to get some clear pictures."
Stunning,"It was absolutely Baltic and taking photos was a test of avoiding frostbite, but it was worth seeing this fabulous place. Get there before 10am to avoid the crowds. The visitor centre/shop/cafe is a good place to heat up and worth a stop off. More choice of nice walks in summer, but dazzling metaphorically and literally in winter."
Magnificent and beautiful,It is a life-changing experience to stand by big and beautiful waterfalls. Godafoss is one of those waterfalls. Of course Dettifoss and Skogarfoss are bigger but few waterfalls are as beautiful as Godafoss. Don´t miss it!
Great waterfall on Ring Road Trip ,"It is like Niagara Fall in USA & Canada but smaller. It is a must visit when you come by ring road trip. There is a cafe, souvenir shop and gas station here. You can have lunch, drink or use toilet here."
"Large easily accessible Falls, attracts larger crowds however","Wonderful fall, dramatic and large.  There are paved walking trails to approach the falls and is located right off of route 1 so it is a favorite of tour buses and the masses, you do not need to be in shape or hike to view Godafoss.  The is also a gift shop with facilities located right there which made it feel more touristy than most attractions in Iceland, however I must admit the hot chocolate was the best I ever had!"
Arguably best waterfall in Iceland ,This tied with Svartifoss and Dynjandi for the best waterfall in all of Iceland. You can still climb down a very very steep path of rocks to go to the bottom of the waterfall. Most others like Detifoss have had the path down closed. We watched the waterfall for a very long time. It was so big and so magnificent. There’s multiple things to see at Godafoss. You should walk around too. There are some nice views of the river and this cool old school bridge.
So beautiful,You need to see this! it's is do beautiful. We took so many pictures here because of the sheer beauty.
It's a big waterfall.,"The title says it all. It's a big waterfall. That doesn't elicit much excitement about it, and it's not supposed to. If you prefer large waterfalls with nice viewing areas, this is for you. I, however, tended to prefer the smaller waterfalls in the area that have more character. The power this waterfall has is amazing. You can feel how powerful the water is by how loud it is and just seeing how much water falls through it is incredible. The parking is free to stop by so it's worth stopping, but if you prefer smaller more intimate waterfalls where you can get up close, don't plan to spend much time here."
Beautiful falls!,The falls are beautiful. You can view the falls from both sides. There is a walking bridge that connects the two parking lots / walking paths. There are numerous viewing platforms both high and low. Make sure to stop at a few of the low viewing spots. The visitor center has some snacks and WCs. Friendly staff. Great stop.
A Must See! ,"Rated one of the top 10 waterfalls in the region, a well deserved accolade!  Beautiful views from both sides, connected by a pedestrian bridge. There is also a gift shop and cafe with restrooms."
Terrific,Despite the wind this is an aweinspiring sight! The shop and cafe are good as well.A wonderful waterfall.
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!,This is probably one of my favorite waterfalls - probably because I was able to visit in both the morning and afternoon and see it from different perspectives and in different lighting. It was a great (and easy) walk around both sides of the falls.
Stunning,Beautiful waterfalls - complete with rainbows! A must see when visiting Iceland and not too far to walk plus free entry / parking
Best part of our day in the region,Truly stunning and powerful waterfall.  Accessible viewing points from above and below the waterfall.  Very nice layout and truly stunning nature.
Impressive and accessible,"Another fine waterfalls site in Iceland, with good parking, groomed trails on both sides of the falls. Very well worth the quick jaunt to see it."
Smaller Niagara - Impressive,"Know as waterfall of the gods, it reminds me of a smaller version of the Niagara falls, the horseshoe falls. You can get close to the bottom of the falls if you are willing to take a risk on the steps down to the rocks and it can be a bit risky, however the view is worth the effort. My only complaint is the fact that the visitor centre charges for toilet access. The cafe is slow service but very nice drinks."
Wonderful,You have to go here if you visit Iceland. The waterfall is wonderful and massive. be prepared to do a lot of walking.
Interesting,"...and interesting visit but mind your footing. It can be quite dangerous in wet, icy and or snowy conditions. We managed to get all three."
Spectacular!!!,This is one of the magnificent waterfalls in Iceland. Each one is unique and special. A must see during your visit.
Nice waterfall,A lovely waterfall to stop off and admire whilst exploring the north.  Not too crowded.  There are steps to get a closer view of the falls.
"Awesome waterfalls, easy to reach on the Ring Road ","One of Iceland’s largest falls, Godafoss has an important role in the country’s history... the trails and parking areas have been newly constructed, and access is easy (right off the Ring Road east of Akureyri) which makes it very popular with visitors.  There’s a convenience store/gas station plus restaurant nearby too.  Enjoy!"
Amazing,"In a country with waterfalls around every corner, Godafoss is an exceptional waterfall. It is also right by the ring road, making it an easy and beautiful stop."
Another spectacular watrerfall,"A short hike to a close up view of this beautiful waterfall is so worth it that we decided to do it again the following day on the other side. It was so beautiful, so powerful, such an amazing sight to behold."
MESMERIZING ICELAND - gODAFOSS,"Take a walking tour of Akureyri- the Capital of NorthernIceland first established as a trading centre in 1602. Travel past mountains, waterfalls, and green coastal regions.Goðafoss waterfall -Goðafoss is in located in river Skjálfandafljót which runs through Bárðardalur and Kinn in Northeast Iceland, and is just off main ring road 1 by the farm Fosshóll. It is among Iceland’s larger waterfalls and also very beautiful. Later you can visit  hot spring area of Namaskard (Hverarond), and Krafla Geothermal Power Station. The nearby Crater Lake Viti is a good place to stop and take a few photos, it is also very nice to see the colourful sulfurous slopes of Namaskard and Krafla volcanic area.A little further away, we visit an impressive waterfall, which is Dettifoss, the most powerful waterfall in Europe. But wherever you go, take time to enjoy the lake itself. With gnarled lava fields on the one side, and lush pastures on the other, it’s a beautiful area to spend time, with a wide range of places to explore."
Wonderful waterfall,"Beautiful and impressive waterfall, visited as part of Golder Circle tour. Amazing place and nice restaurant/shop also. Lovely story attached. A must-do in Iceland"
Lovely waterfalls ,"A visit to these falls was included as part of a tour. We had an hour here and could have spent longer as there are great photo opportunities. You can walk along both sides of the falls. Lots of parking. Gift shop, cafe and toilets."
Quite impressive - popular because of ease of access,"Don’t get me wrong, this is an impressive waterfall, but the main point about the hype is the fact that it’s situated right next to the ring road. Therefore it is always swarmed with busses. Still worth a visit though...."
Yet another beautiful waterfall,"Iceland is so blessed with nature.  We planned to see several waterfalls, but this was not planned.  Thank god we passed by and noticed it.  It is a beautiful waterfall, unspoiled, similar to most waterfalls, and not commercialized.  You can just walk around this beautiful waterfall, enjoy the huge amounts of water rushing through and taking pictures."
Waterfall of the gods,Hiking trails line both sides of the waterway and there are trails down to the lower part of the falls as well. This reminds me of Niagra Falls in the US. Roaring water. Amazing vistas.
Wonderful waterfall.,"It's a great place to visit.It's free and close to the road, with a big parking.You can see the waterfall from both sides of the river."
Wonderful waterfall,Visited as part of Goldern Circle bus trip. Well worth the visit. Nice shop and restaurant attached and wondeful scenery. Good stories
Gorgeous,"Easy to find... Easy parking, easy walk. Wheelchair accessible. picnic tables available - great view from each parking area"
Beautiful falls with several viewing areas,We went to the left side where the visitor center is. Easy walk out to the falls. There are several spots where you can view the falls from different angles. Very beautiful. We got there around 9am and it wasn't too crowded. Definitely recommend a visit.
Must visit site in North Iceland!,"We visit Godafoss every year with the groups we take through One Yoga Global and love it every time!  There are 2 sides you can visit from ... on the left, there is a rocky path down to the base of the waterfall which is really powerful and recommended.  Take some time to breathe it all in!"
The waterfall of the Gods,Yet another impressive waterfall. This is where a 10th Century who championed the introduction of Christianity to Iceland disposed of the sautés off pagan Norse gods in 1000. The associated river is the longest in Iceland.
Added bonus of kayakers going over falls!,The falls are beautiful! We happened to be there when a group of 3 kayakers were going over. They did this several times and it was fun to watch.
A Sight!,Powerful waterfall. Tourist can access from both sides with ample parking. It is possible to walk down to the waterfall. A must see if you are in the north.
Fall of the gods,"The beautiful Goðafoss falls in Iceland - local belief has it that in the year 1000 AD, local chieftain Þorgeir Ljósvetningagoði decided that Icelanders should adopt Christianity as their official religion. He threw all his pagan god statues into a waterfall near his home and the waterfall was appropriately named Goðafoss, which translates to “Waterfall of the gods”."
Beautiful Godafoss,Beautiful waterfall and easily accessible. Can see falls from the top and then take path to bottom as well.
volumes of water,This was well worth a detour to see the extensive volumes of water coming over the falls . The spray was exhilarating and the paths alongside were breathtaking if not cognizant  of Occupational Health and Safety
Beautiful and powerful raging water and falls,"Just a quick stop to witness this incredible natural phenomenon  Lots of tourists in july, but not overcrowded, easy parking and walk to viewing area."
Beautiful,Lots to see and do here. There is a path that goes all the way around for your viewing pleasure. There is a gift shop with lots to choose from. You do have to pay to use the restrooms cause it's in a national park.
Impressive waterfall,"On a trip filled with waterfalls at every turn, this rates among the top.  There are paths going down the left and right sides of the river to the falls.  We were encouraged to use the path on the right side to avoid the crowds coming off the buses."
Reminds of Niagara Falls,"Paved walkway to main observation, You can get closer and better pictures by following the gravel paths.  Very popular and busy, try to get in between buses,"
Easy Access - Great Views,"Godafoss waterfall provides easy access via a paved walkway to the main observation area at the top of the falls ... perhaps a 5 minute walk from the parking areas, and fairly flat walk (but there are some ups/downs).  From this area you get the views most shown by others in the…"
Impressive,Bring a waterproof if you intend to walk close to the falls onto the closest viewing area. There are plenty of places to take great photos though whilst staying dry.
Beautiful,"Part of a bus tour from Akureyri and well worth the trip.  There is a paved walkway from the visitor center to the falls, easy walk to a beautiful waterfalls"
Stunning.,"Not the most powerful waterfall we saw on our trip, but the most beautiful.  Vantage point above the fall wheelchair accessible but a couple hundred metres from typical parking spots."
Crazy,"One of the biggest waterfalls in Iceland from our full island tour. Absolutely massive water drop, bring a waterproof jacket if you wish to survive it!"
One of the Largest Waterfalls in Northern Iceland,"We just loved our stop here and got lots of great photos since the weather was good.  There is a gift shop and eatery close by with restrooms.  If you are in the area, please stop by."
Its a waterfall,If you are in the area chances are you will have to visit Godafoss. Good parking and an easy walk to the falls themselves. Avoid days/times when the cruise ship busses arrive en masse and perhaps the falls will be more pleasant. Not mutch else to see here. there is aCafe/shop with free toilets on the car park.
Very nice easy to visit waterfall,"The parking place for this waterfall is directly on the mainroad to Akureyri. Actually there are two parking places, but the one with the shops seems to offer the easiest access. It is only a short walk to get a good frontal view of this large, wide waterfall. Pleany of places to make nice photo's."
Another famous waterfall,Iceland is full of waterfall It is a big one and very niceVery easy to access from main road on the way to or from Akureyri. Worth the stop
Wonder of Nature,This wonder is located very close to highway 1 and is accessible to all kind of people and requires little to no walking or any other physic activity. The waterfall is enormous and just beautiful to watch!
Awesome and Powerful example of Nature,Located in the Northeastern region of the Barardalur district of Iceland lies this awe inspiring waterfall.  The water falls almost 40 feet and is nearly 100 feet wide.  Its curved shape somewhat reminds me of a smaller version of Horseshoe falls in Niagara New York.  The water moved very swiftly and was beautiful and soothing to watch.  Its definitely worth a visit.
A A must see.,Not only is the waterfall well worth a trip to but the surrounding countrysude is beautiful. The falls look like a small Niagara. Recommended.
Nice waterfall!,"It is a nice atraction and good to reach by car, so even less mobile visitors can have this experience."
Beautiful and Powerful Waterfall,"Godafoss is definitely worth a visit.  It's very easy to get to, just off of Highway 1.  There's a parking lot on either side of the falls and a pedestrian bridge connects the two sides so you can see the view from both sides no matter where you park.  It's a very short hike to the falls (<5mins) they are really right there off the road.  We hiked both sides and took lots of pictures and spent at most an hour there."
Powerful and pretty,"This historically important waterfall is reached by driving across the relatively flat uplands so it appears suddenly and surprisingly.  You can walk out to viewpoints on either side of the river rushing through its gorge, from a pedestrian bridge or from the bottom if you climb down a rock staircase with a rope handrail.  Not a huge waterfall but impressive, noisy, and significant in the conversion of Iceland to Christianity in 1000 CE.  We were glad to see it and the surrounding countryside on a windy, cold, and wet day."
Avoid the cafe at all costs!,"At the entrance os Godafoss there is a Cafe/souvenir shop. We just left. It is quite a cold day and the kids were hungry and cold so we went in and ordered pizza and drinks. Frozen pizza, French fries with hot spices and 20 minutes wait time and extremely rude cashier at the cafe... total: 60€. Iceland is expensive but this was a fraud. It speaks badly of Iceland!!!!"
Awesome!,An absolute must see. It was a bit grey when we went but it didn’t dull the majesty of this waterfall. I didn’t want to leave!
Don't miss Godafoss,"A fabulous sight, easy to get to, easy to walk trails, the waterfall is more than 30 metres wide,there are several ways of walking down the cliff side to get closer to the falls, some quite steep, if you can avoid the multiple people taking selfies there are great photo opportunities"
Don't Miss This Falls,"We have been to many falls: Victoria in Africa; Iguazu in South America; Niagra in North America; plus more.  This is one of the best we have seen.  There is no admission cost. There are nice facilities at the property.  It is well done and maintained.  Getting there is the only problem but there are tours, rent cars, etc. The roads there are good. We went by tour bus and enjoyed the drive and tour of the countryside. Do not miss this."
One of my favorite waterfalls,"A very impressive and easy to find waterfall which is so big, that you won't have any trouble with crowds.  Looks like a smaller version of Niagra Falls.  But with cool trails that you do.  There are parking lots and trails on each side of the falls.  It is located on the north side of Iceland."
"Interesting history of the name, a most impressive waterfall","Godafoss - the Waterfall of the Gods is right next to the N1, turn off and park and its only a short walk to it.  The name comes form the story that a Viking leader converted to Christianity and that all his pagan statutes were thrown into the river to give it the deity name.  The falls are not the highest, nor biggest etc. but they are still impressive.  We saw kayakers getting out of the water at the top of the falls, it would be pretty hairy if they missed the getting out spot, because they would go over. We watched them and they all got out OK."
Easy access & nice falls,Very easy access to both sides of the falls with plenty of parking on both sides. Great views with very little walking required.
One of the most popular waterfalls in iceland,"Beautifull . some tourists no respect for regulations , they passed safetyline. You can view it from 2angles and you can go at the top or at the bottom. Lots of parking space. Toilet close."
Easy hit and run,"There is no reason not to visit Godafoss. If its on your way, which it probably is because you drive Road One. The parking is right next to the road and the waterfall is 1 minute from the parking. You can use it as a quick - stretch your legs and go stop. There is a gasstation just next door. The waterfall itself is pretty, but nothing special compared with others on Iceland. If you are in a hurry (on vacation?), just skip it. If you have 10 minutes, just do it!"
Worth it,Very nice site for an easy walk. Full service. The fall is wonderful. Make sure to spend time on both sides of the fall / river. 1 hour is ok. It's a must in Iceland
Wonderful trip,Well recommended if on a cruise or in Iceland a must. Certainly best waterfall in Iceland. Easy to get to walk.
Add some water and reach greatness,"Oh yeah, after 30 km of extremely bad road, seeing the greatness of this place blew us away. What an impressive force to get to see so close. Amazing"
A Nice Walk to a Really Great Waterfall!,"Our coach group of 22 unloaded at the parking lot and could see the falls (er, ""foss"") in the distance.  It was a relatively easy walk on the gravel path over to get a great view of Goddafoss.BTW... In the gift shop the restrooms are on an honor-pay (I paid it!) basis; i.e. two 100 krónur coins (about $ 1.60), or, two US $ 1 bills.  I suppose if you buy something in the shop, the fee would be waived."
Stunning,"Well worth a visit, we seen many waterfalls in Iceland and this was just as epic. If you like a good view it's worth checking out"
One of the Jewels of the North,Wonderful waterfall which you should not miss.Visited as part of various sites in this northern area of Iceland.Large numbers of visitors but that didn’t distract from the beauty of this place.
Incredible experience,If you visit in the Summer you can get there even late in the evening. Try to take advantage of this because it is less crowded. We spent almost two hours because they have different viewing areas and we went through all. We didn't want to leave. It is that beautiful!!!
Beautiful,One of the must see attraction of Iceland. This time the water was a bit muddy. Normally it is really cristal clear.
Must see!,"This powerful and beautiful waterfall is a must see.  Godafoss means golden waterfall and is thought to be why it's named ""the Golden circle"" when you do that tour.   Park in the lower parking lot, you don't need to see it from the top lot."
Another amazing water fall,Took the tour when we arrived in Akureyri on the cruise ship. We had nothing planned that day so the company called Iceland Guided tours were waiting just outside of the entrance. Was half the price of the ships similar tour and excellent. We were in a small group mini bus.  Our Guide was excellent took us to many places and 7 hours in all.  The water fall was a short walk to the main falls and a good spot to take photos.
Looks like a small version of Niagra Falls,It’s a nice little stop.   Hike 5 min up to the falls.  You can also take some steps and a small trail to the base of the falls.  At the parking center is a nice gift shop.  Bathrooms.  And cafe.   They know how to get you in and out quickly.  We enjoyed the stopHave fun.   Follow us. @nickellfamilytravel
It’s a beautiful fall.,It is just few minutes off the main highway. No restrooms. But there is a cafe and will charge you ~200 kr (honor system).
Astounding waterfalls right on the Ring Road,This is a must see attraction on the Ring Road between Lake Myvatn and  Akureyi. It is clearly visible on the ring road and has decent parking. Can be busy at times as pretty much everybody will be stopping to see the falls. The viewing platforms provide great views of the falls and by crossing a bridge you can see both sides of the falls
Photos don’t really tell the tale,"Standing there in the face of the falls, you can feel the power of the water. Take a video — please — but understand that it is impossible to capture the experience. We were there on a day when the weather ranged from sun to sleet. Layers are key to comfort. Watch for the correct entrance to the parking area, off to the right as you come from Akureyri."
Breath taking,Come right up close to one of nature's beauties. The is a must see while in Iceland. You can walk around and see it from every angle. Really an amazing experience!
A Must Visit,This is a must visit waterfall for sure! You can walk on either side of the falls on defined paths. It is named waterfall of the gods for a reason! Plenty of parking and has facilities located on site. Easy to get on and off the Ring Road.
One of the most incredible places ,We arrived at 01am and the midnight sun was still up. What a lunar escape and what a beautiful surprise you have as soon as you’re finishing the walking path!
One of my favourite waterfalls in Iceland!!,Less busy than other waterfalls but just as beautiful! Cool how you can see the waterfall from all angles and walk down below and really be enveloped in the beauty.
Exhilarating!,"From the parking lot, it is a paved path, easy to reach, and gorgeous views of the falls.  You can view the falls from several angles and if you really want additional views, just move your car to the other parking lot."
Waterfall of the Gods,"The Godfoss waterfall was the most beautiful stop during an excursion from our cruise ship, which docked in Akureyri.  After a short walk from the parking lot, we had sufficient time to see the waterfall from different angles, and to admire the Skjálfandafljót River that leads to the waterfall.  Waterfall of the Gods was named after the legend of a Norse priest who threw idols in the waterfall and proclaimed Christianity the official religion in 1000 AD."
Beautiful Falls - Must see stop,"Godafoss is a perfect viewing area of the breathtaking falls.   Just of Route 1.  Parking is on both sides of the falls.  Paths to see the fall are well groom and in great shape plus they are making additional improvements during our July 2019 visit.  Either side gives you great view.  There is a small store with a souvenir shop, cafe and bathroom (small charge for use)"
Great waterfall - view it from both sides ,Stopped off at Godafoss and parked in the new car park (opposite side of the river from the cafe) and walked to the viewing area above the waterfall. To reach the other side you have to walk back and cross a foot bridge by the cafe and then walk up the other side of the river. From this side you can descend to the river level below the waterfall and experience the noise and power of the walls. Worth viewing from both sides. Short walk from the car park to the viewing area.
Difficult to access if you have mobility issues.,If you have mobility problems  this place could be a problem as you are dropped off about a quarter of mile away and then the coach goes further away again.
Lovely setting ,"Came here part of a tour 200 m walk from coach park, not the biggest but quite noisy, the milky water has came from a glacier, small cafe/ gift shop here."
WOW!  Absolutely beautiful,"A nice walk along paths to this beautiful waterfall.  There is a bridge from one parking lot on the West side of the falls to the Shops and Parking lot on the East side of the falls.  Hiking on both sides.  Do be careful however - this is truly wild nature, and although it looks tamed (paths and bridges are well-maintained) it can still be dangerous."
Waterfall of the Gods,"We were here on a trip from our cruise ship, very busy. The story behind these falls is fascinating and I can see why it’s also known as The Waterfalls of the Gods. Short walk from the car park on flat even ground to see the falls. There is a footbridge that takes you over to the information/ shop on the other side, toilets are chargeable. Well worth the stop. Recommended."
Awesome Waterfall,"Despite the rain and coldness in summer season, nothing could stop us from walking a short distance from the car park to this awesome and gorgeous waterfall.  This is another wonder for us.Nicely done up boardwalk with railings.This waterfall is very near to Akureyri, around 35 km away."
"Amazing sight, a must see in Iceland ",Went to visit as part of an excursion from a cruise docked in Akureyri. Arrived at about 9pm and only our bus tour there so plenty of photo opportunities and could spend time just taking in the magnificence of the waterfall. Amazing sight and with the bright evening sun and stunning scenery around made it even more magical. Would recommend on a trip to Iceland.
Icelandic version of Niagara falls,"This is very impressive waterfall and absolutely one you should check while in Iceland. This is not the tallest fall, but this is wide and the amount of water in this stream is amazing, also the sound of it. This waterfall is also easy and quick to access, so no reason not to go here."
One of the best,"An absolutely stunning waterfall that, in my opinion, outdid some of the more famous ones. You will see it from a far distance if you come from the east of Iceland. Once there you can access it from both sides. There are parking lots on both sides and good paths to walk on. On the left side (facing it) of the fall, you can also walk down to the river and walk all the way up to the fall. This last part has no track so you will be climbing around on a flat, rocky beach to get there. From the right side, you can't come close unless you jump the protective barriers which a surprising amount of people do! For photography, this place faces the sun most parts of the day. An early morning should provide the best light. Since it is directed towards NE, the afternoon/evening it will be in shadows. Surprisingly, there are no drone restrictions put to place here - just the common drone rules. Petrolstation with a cafe, a souvenir shop and the usual expensive toilets in Iceland (200 ISK)."
Best Waterfalls ,"One thing I learned on my trip is that Iceland has the BEST waterfalls. Oh my goodness, the views at Godafoss are amazing. Definitely check it out! Plan to spend about an hour of your trip here."
Beautiful!,Really wide and powerful waterfall that is a don’t miss between Akureyri and Myvatn. You can park on either side of the bridge and get a great view of the falls.
Easy walk and worth the view!,"Wasn't overrun with tourists. Beautiful and peaceful. Restaurant and gas station here, clean restrooms."
The waterfall of gods,"When you travel from Akureyri to Egilstadir, in one koment, from right side you hear first strong voices of water and little later you see a wonderfull waterfall.There is one story-when Icelanders at about year 1000 accepted cristianity, they put all statues of old nordic gods in river....so Godafoss was born...You stop the car and go to nice walk..."
Divine,"A beautiful place. Lovely views. Very powerful waterfall, so be careful. Nice place to sit and unwind."
Goddafoss,Very beautiful waterfall. Worth seeing. Easy drive by car with no pay parking in 2 seperate areas. Good access to viewing areas with great photo opportunities.
Beautiful waterfall,A beautiful waterfall that you can view from multiple areas depending on your walking abilities. One of my favourite things I saw in Akureyri.
Stunning,Another amazing nature spot in Iceland. Plenty of parking. Good sized crowds but worth the drive.Small cafe located at the site.
Wow!!,"Amazing waterfall!It was easy to get to the waterfall, close to the road.It's a stunning experience.."
Amazing waterfall ,This is most beautiful waterfall I visited in Iceland though it’s no the largest. It’s a nice walk down to the closest end of waterfall and also the upstream origin. There’s facilities nearby and parking is easy. It’s also right on the way from myvatn lake to Akureyri.
WOW!,"What a place! Incredible scenery, the roar of the falls and a decent cafe on hand.The paths are well maintained and easy going (there are more adventurous options too).Icelanders are really friendly and very happy to point out the best spots for a photo - of which there are many."
Big and beautiful,"You can see it from the Ring Road. Park in the large lot or by the restaurant on the other side. You can walk from one side to the other. It will be crowded because it's right on the road, and truly spectacular."
Stunning ,"Absolutely beautiful and easy walking distance from the car park. Huge tourist attraction and lots of people feeling the need to do yoga poses in front of it pushing their way to the ‘right spot’ which was sad and embarrassing. Most wonderful place on earth, shame about some of the cretins that visit it though."
One of the most beautiful waterfalls I have ever seen,Everyone says you have to go to Godafoss.  They are not wrong.  We were lucky enough that it was a beautiful sunny day.  So we got some wonderful pictures.  Don't miss this sight.
Awesome waterfall yet again!,"As you know, Iceland is filled with waterfalls in any direction you turn. This one is pretty good, with a lovely split waterfall (falls in three large chunks split by land masses). It makes for some pretty pictures! You can also walk right next to the top of the falls."
Overwhelmingly Beautiful,"Another huge, beautiful waterfall in Iceland. This is one I could stare at for a long time. Not as many tourists as the falls in western and southern Iceland as this isn't one of the heavier tourist areas.  There is a walkover bridge and you can walk either side of the falls and river. Gasoline here. Cafe with food, coffee and drinks. We didn't eat however the coffee and cappucinos are good although expensive like other Iceland cafes. The cafe also has a souvenir shop with different levels of souvenirs from nice to junky. Bathrooms here for a fee/donation.  This is a great stop If doing the Ring Road. Right off Hwy 1."
Cool,"Have to see this! Try to avoid the big groups and make it out with a local guide, worth the effort! Explore the north!"
Amazing site,"Pretty cool given how flat the area appears to be to find such a large waterfall and gorge. Good facilities, though interesting to note bathrooms in gift shop building are free if you can’t find change (or apparently get change machine to accept Icelandic bill). Watch your step even on the walkways."
Our vacation to Iceland,"An interesting place to visit, lots of people around and the walking trails were fairly easy to negotiate."
lovely waterfall,its the waterfall of the gods..its on the way to Akureyri and a beautiful waterfall..one must stop here to get clicked !!
Worth seeing,The waterfall was beautiful.  I thought I had seen enough waterfalls by the time we stopped there but it was one of the most spectacular sights of our trip.  It is worth the short walk from the parking lot to see.
A must see outing,"Doing a day trip from Akureyri, the waterfall is a must see. A great opportunity for good photos. There is a restaurant as well. It is a good place to stretch the legs before exploring the other gems the North has to offer."
EveryOne’s Favorite ,"All of Iceland’s Waterfalls are beautiful and distinct, interesting and with great stories to tell but this one is everyone’s favorite."
Amazing fall ,"The fall is right off the main road, very easy access. There is a shop to use restroom (need pay). We choose to arrive early to avoid crowd. There are two sides of view spots of fall. We did not cross bridge to other side, but we walked down to bottom of fall. Beautiful!"
Favorite of all falls!,"We've seen nearly every major waterfall in Iceland and this one, by far, was everyone's favorite. There are two sides for viewing, both with dirt paths (no hiking poles needed) and viewing spots. Park at one and use the foot bridge to cross over the raging river that flows from Godafoss down to Geitafoss (you'll see both) for different perspectives. The walk from the parking lot takes about 5-10 minutes out to the path's end but you'll see the falls right as you pull in the lot.Easy to get to after visiting Husavik for whale watching, there is plenty of parking and a picnic table. There's also an N1 gas station here, and a gift shop. The WC requires 200kr to use."
A Must-See,"These waterfalls are located right off the highway with ample parking. No facilities here although there is small cafe & store nearby. There are paved walkways all around the river & falls. If you want to go near the river the footing is more uneven. It's a popular stop, so expect lots of folks!"
Beautiful Waterfall,"It's a very beautiful Waterfall and pretty easy to reach, close to a a main road. There are  better Waterfalls in Iceland."
Beautiful but busy,"Located right on the Ring Road, this big, beautiful waterfall  is very accessible, and so very popular. We opted to hike up to the back of the falls, along newly constructed pathways - leading to gravel - leading to corded-off areas - leading to a simple ""BEWARE"" sign. Once we reached the falls, it was free exploration around the rock pools, trying not to get our feet wet, staying clear of the edge of the water. Down below, at the lower viewpoint, we watched crowds of people unload from buses in the main parking lot, and fill the pathways. We had clearly chosen the path less traveled, and thankfully so. Godafoss was beautiful and worth the stop regardless of the people, but for those searching for all the services and ease of access, you'll find that too, in the main parking lot. This is the waterfall for everyone."
Awesome,Well worth the stop.  Fortunate that we were advised of this by other guests at the Baegisa Guesthouse where we stayed the night before
Majestic Niagara of Iceland!,"This falls is quite easily accessible from the carpark. A stairway near the top observation platform on the West of the falls leads down to the falls where one can experience a close up majestic view of the tremendous plunge of the crystal clear blue glacier waters over the cliff into the basin below!From the observation platform, the falls was just as magnificent!"
Godafoss,"Amazing waterfall.  The whole river is so scenic.  Must walk on various sides to enjoy to the fullest.  Indeed, this is a true gift from God to Iceland."
One of the most famous waterfalls in Iceland.,"My friends and I went to this waterfall as part of a tour that included a city city sightseeing last May 11, 2019.The water of the river Skjálfandafljót falls from a height of 12 meters over a width of 30 meters wide of 30 meter and a huge amount of water that is falling, it is one of the most spectacular waterfalls. It's means fall of the gods. Is situated in the North of Iceland, near Myvatn. Views are stunning!When the cruise ship arrived at the port it was snowing a bit and so it went all the way to the fallls.It was incredible cold that day, eventhough we have a heavy parka and gloves.Be prepared!"
"Even on a cloudy, worth a visit!",Unfortunately the day we visited it was cloudy and drizzly but these falls didn’t disappoint...amazing...so powerful!
Beautiful waterfall,Put this on your ‘must see’ list when in Iceland. Majestically beautiful. New car park and walking tracks make this an easy area to get around and view the falls from different angles. Cafe and gift shop with toilets make this an ideal destination.
Spectacular waterfalls,Beautiful stop on the ring road. Well sign posted for Iceland! Has a cafe as well although we didn’t have time to stop there.
Well worth a visit,"This is an amazing waterfall, or rather a collection of waterfalls, especially if you’re interested in photography. There’s endless opportunities for great shots. But just to enjoy the power of the water, the peace, the nature, the great nearby coffee shop, it’s a great day trip"
Beautiful ,Amazing views...absolutely a must see. We wish we would have had our rain pants on to hike below as you will be soaked if not!!
Like another world!,It was Cold and snowy but certainly well worth. Try to go early to avoid the crowds! Be careful driving!
Cold but worth the ride out there.   ,Nice drive. Not far from Husavik.  Beautiful waterfalls.   I would comment to anyone to take the short drive.
The Power of Mother Nature,A must see if you ever find yourself in Akureyri Iceland.  I only hope that tourism will not ruin this natural beauty.
Beautiful Falls on a beautiful day!,We visited Godafoss on a nice and sunny day. We had rainbows and contrasts that begged to have their pictures taken. Very memorable.
Beautiful falls ,Access is very easy as it is only a few meters off highway 1.Plenty of parking and good walkways along the river. Lots of photo opportunities.
Beautiful sight!,If you are going around Iceland on the ring road you will be hard pressed to miss this sight. Located on the ring road just outside Akureyri.
Who knew that these Falls were so spectacular.,"Yes, a must visit place,Easy walking for most, But I did see one lady with floppy { thongs} And she wished she had worn proper foot wear, Groan, when will the ""NEW WORLD TOURISTS"" learn.but on the good side she had a hundred fellow countrymen to assist her. [Wink]. If you drive yourself DO""NOT park in the upper lot,because there is one at almost the same level of the falls. WATCH your footing as the rocks are slippery and irregular.ALSO, if you go to the top parking [with all the @#$%& buses] be prepared to pay 200 Krona to use the bathroom. I had no small bills/coins so I paid by visa..... $ 2.00 later ."
Spectacular but not the most stunning in Iceland,These beautiful falls are easy to access from route 1 about 35km from Akureyri. The access from the car park is along is tarred path suitable for all. There are other walking paths as well.They are currently creating another car park on the other side of the river. There is a small shop/cafe.These are definitely worth seeing if you are in the area but not as stunning as Dynjandi in the western fjords.
Wow,"Beautiful, spectacular, safe & easy walking from car parking lot to wonderful views of the falls! Every angle offered up a colorful rainbow to add to the beauty of Goðafoss. A new gift shop and coffee shop was a short walk across the parking lot."
Sensational Waterfall. Must see!,We loved this place!  We spent most of the day here. Interesting view points from both sides of the fall as well as up top and down at the waters edge / river level. Must see waterfall.
Crystal Blue Water,"Beautiful waterfall in Akureryi, Iceland. Scenic drive through the mountainous roads to get to this pretty waterfall from glacier runoff. Trails to walk and souvenir/food/restrooms available. Tour guide told us about the countryside and legend of the falls. Dress warmly in May and expect snow."
Most Powerful Waterfall in Iceland,"The views are varied and dramatic at Godafoss.  The trail along the edge is not always enough to keep you from falling so be careful walking, especially with small children."
Another stunning Icelandic waterfall,"Possibly one of the top 5 waterfalls in Iceland.  You can see it from highway 1, so obviously worth a stop when driving between Akureyri and Myvatn.  Gorgeous and powerful."
Breathtaking,"We made a stop at Godafoss during a recent drive in Iceland, and it was extraordinarily beautiful.  Try to allow time to walk down to the bottom of the falls.  But, even if you stay at the top, the views are spectacular from many vantage points, with a unique chance to witness the amazing power of the water."
"Beautiful, less crowded waterfalls",These waterfalls are far more beautiful because you don't have to navigate the larger crowds at the falls in the Golden Circle (or perhaps that's because we visited Gofafoss at 18:00 so it was naturally less crowded due to the time). Definitely worth seeing them!
Incredible ,What a magnificent place of nature’s power and beauty. Not an easy walk but well worth it once you’re there. Take your time and if you can go as far down as possible for views.
Unforgettable!,Great views and memories. We were lucky to have visited on a sunny day and see a rainbow over the waterfall.
"Beautiful waterfall, chilling winds","Place where Icelanders threw their idols away when Iceland converted from paganism to Christianity in 1000 AD. Very beautiful scenery, but cold because of windchill and moisure in the air."
Most beautiful waterfall I have ever seen,We travelled all of Iceland on the ring road. Saw a total of 6 of the most famous waterfall. This one was SPECTACULAR! Did not want to leave. Would have loved to have sat there for hours and enjoyed lunch. Would highly recommend stopping there.
Amazing Waterfall,This was a stop on our day tour from Akureyri. It was amazing to see this waterfall. It was windy and cold out but the scenery was incredible. You only need less than an hour there to enjoy the views and the gift shop.
Iceland with Intrepid,A must visit it was not crowded when we visited as we were very early in the season. Make sure you have good shoes
Powerful waterfall,"This is one of those must see spots in Iceland, and the best thing is, you don't even have to drive away from the Ring Road. Other tourists like it too, so you will always meet someone when visiting this place. You won't be alone."
Spectacular and BreathTaking,"This was an amazing stop. We were treated to a gorgeous drive through the mountain pass during a snow storm and then emerging to the falls. It was gorgeous and serene. The water is so blue. Of course, it is brisk and windy, but who cares, the scenery makes up for up. We spent about 45 mins there and that was more than enough time to enjoy, walk around, and tour the gift shop."
My favourite waterfall,Of all the waterfalls that I had a chance to see while in Iceland this is my favourite one. Beautiful colour of the water. Definitely worth seeing
One of the best waterfalls,"We saw over ten and this was one of my favorites from our trip. Definitely worth a visit, it will put others to shame!"
Beautiful waterfall,"We visited the Godafoss (Falls of the Gods) on a day trip from Akureyri (about 40 minutes away). There's plenty of free parking, next to a small cafe/souvenir shop, and the Falls are a 5 minute walk away and can be viewed from a number of angles. Wherever you look from, the Falls are wonderful, whether from the top of the relatively flat path, or a scramble down some steep stone steps to river level. They're not massive, but the sights and the noise of the falls and the raging river are great."
Wonders of nature ,"Waterfall showing off.  There is nothing there except wonderful nature for you to look at. It is not the most powerful waterfall in Iceland and not the highest but it is special, kind a like Lego version of Niagara. In one of those glacier rivers streaming from the highlands of Iceland. It might be crowded when the buses get there with the big cruise ships passengers but there is plenty of space."
Stunningly beautiful waterfall,This is a beautifully formed waterfall which can be easily viewed from a number of vantage points so even in high season you will be able to get great views and photographs. It is definitely worth taking the path across the bridge to the opposite side as there are equally spectacular but different views from both aspects.
Behold the power of water!,This natural spot in Þingeyjarsveit is a great side-trip from a visit to Akureyri. The falls are really something to behold and most visitors will be left inspired by the power there.Just be sure to dress appropriately for the season!
"A SIGHT TO BEHOLD, AN EXPERIENCE TO LIVE","Like so many other waterfalls on Iceland, Godafoss is worth a visit.  Its position and the built paths make it very easy to see, it is even accessible from various points of view and each view is breathtaking."
Worth a stop,You have to tick this off the list if you’re in the north if Iceland. It’s incredibly quick and easy to get to. There are two viewing points on either side which you can either walk or drive between. The falls are not the the most impressive you will see but they are very beautiful so worth passing by if you’re in the vicinity.
Beautiful.,This was a lovely part of our land of fire and ice tour of Northern Ireland. Very pretty falls and worth seeing.
A must in northern Iceland,"We were really impressed by the falls, and their beauty. Such energy. The access was well organised, and one could even descend to the lower level to see the falls from that perspective. Warmly recommended, and easily combined with a visit to the awesome Myvatn region."
A must see,We paid for the Golden Circle Tour to see all the sights and stopped here.  We had lunch and took some fabulous pictures.  Definitely worth the drive.
Breathtaking - don't miss,"Beautiful spot, dont miss when in Iceland - it is truly breathtaking and worth the drive. Also good to reach."
Amazing,"Quite easy to get to. Once at the site it is easy to walk to the viewing places. You can walk down to the bottom of the falls, take care on the steps if snowy or icy. Very beautiful falls, blue crystal water falling over black rocks. Wide and quite high. Mesmerising. You must visit."
Easy stop,"This is a beautiful waterfall, and very easy to get to.  Do yourself a huge favor and get there by 0830.  We had one couple there when we arrived, and were able to enjoy this site without people everywhere.  We also visited during the week, so maybe that helped as well.  Enjoy!"
How far north,"Good, good, Gods and trolls- what more is needed? Book onto a small town. Stop a plenty. Watch your footing; slippery as is wet."
Waterfall in winter is still beautiful..,"Cold, snowy and slippery grounds but it was still worth the trip to visit Godafoss..personally I find black n white also has its own beauty.."
Amazing waterfall!,This waterfall is the most beautiful in Iceland. The water is turquoise and and crystal clear. This is my favorite waterfall though all of them are amazing. This wonder is a must see!
Definitely a must see,Im so glad we stopped to see this waterfall. It was right on the side of Route 1 so definitely not out of the way. There is a short walk up to the falls from the parking lot but its worth the trek. It was partially frozen over and looked great in the snow when we went. 
The Power of Nature,Godafoss reminded me of Niagra Falls - the power and immense nature of the water was remarkable to witness.  The spray is COLD so be prepared when the wind changes direction.  
"Beautiful, epic waterfall","I would recommend coming here on a clear day for an enjoyable experience. We came the day after a big snow blizzard and the sky was beautiful and clear (that's Iceland for you!).  The waterfall is amazing, be careful in March that the path might be icy and slippery.  I could…"
Beautiful waterfall. We were lucky the weather was so cooperative! ,"Easy to view. It’s free! Right off the Ring Road, Route 1. Walkable in March. We were lucky the weather was so cooperative!"
Just beautiful ,We put this on our to visit list in Iceland. It was a beautiful sight to see and also appreciating the historical significance of Godafoss. Plenty of parking there and also a visitors centre to have refreshments and a comfort stop. Also chance to buy some souvenirs of Iceland if you choose.
Another gorgeous waterfall!,"This was a powerful, gorgeous waterfall, on the way to Myvatn.  Had to stay wrapped up as the winds picked up in this place!"
Beautiful!,"Stunning view. Easy access to take complete pictures of the waterfall. Short walk, maybe 5 mins in ice and snow. Free parking"
Very nice,What a beautiful place. Iceland really is stunning. We came here on a golden circle tour with saga travel and it was really nice.
Godafoss Waterfalls,"Visited as part of a tour to Myvatn, worthwhile stop for photographs of the area and falls. Shop is expensive compared to UK prices but fairly in line with similar shops across Iceland."
Amazing waterfall scenery,The waterfall is amazing - really wide and impressive with a fast flowing spectacular river (depends on season!) Also a nice cafe & gift shop on site with several loos!
Stunning,"We travelled in February and walked from the car park in fresh snow. If you stepped off the path it was knee deep. It is an amazing place on a  wonderful winter day. Wrap up though, it was bitterly cold, about -13 degrees, and although I was lovely and warm with all my layers, I had to put on sunglasses, because the cold and wind made my eyes hurt. I wouldn't have missed it and the journey there from Akureyri as the sun came up was spectacular.  Thoroughly recommend it, and then a hot chocolate in the cafe afterwards."
Beautiful ,I arrived here on an arranged tour as part of the holiday. It's well worth the trip. There are lots of different viewpoints.  There is also a cafe/gift shop there
Lovely,The falls are amazing. Keep wrapped up . It was  ‐22 when we went but its  definitely worth the short walk. Little shop next to the falls but need to pay to use the loos.
Beautiful!,I stopped by here on my way to and from the geothermal baths. Even when we were there in the afternoon it wasn't super busy. The waterfall is so beautiful and a must see on your way to the baths. We were here in the winter so it was very cold and our time spent looking at the falls was fairly short.
Quite nice,"Have seen lots of waterfalls. This was another one. It was a stunning, cold snowy day, so it looked quite nice, and was quiet too, so easy to see and get photos.The tourist cafe / shop nearby was full of vastly overpriced tacky souvenirs. Save your money, buy elsewhere"
Part of break tour,Just a joy to see and hear the waterfall Guide so informative easy to listen to .Wear layers and boots  Great getting taken by bus there and back
Gorgeous sight to your eyes!,To me it looked like the Mini Niagara Falls. One of the most beautiful sights I have seen in Iceland.
Beautiful waterfall,These falls are an hour or so away from Akueyri and are fantastic as you can get up close to them. Whilst there the afternoon sun lit up a rainbow in the spray which was justr magical. They make a good place for a break if you're heading to Lake Myvatn as there is a cafe here too. There is a tarmac path along the river bank so I would say it's suitable for buggies and wheelchairs too.
Beautiful snowy day,"Stopped by to see the waterfall. It was quite nice, not particularly spectacular, good walking paths around about in the snow. Cafe, and shop selling heaps of made in China tacky but very expensive souvenirs. Worth a stop, but doesn't take long!"
A must visit!,"Speculator views and a great walk through the snow, you are in the middle of nowhere! Small cafe and toilet facilities on site too."
"Good, but worth all that fuss?","The Godafoss waterfall is spectacular, winter or summer.  But it is a bit of a honey trap, and in winter, the path down to the lower ledges, close to the falls is steep, slippery and with little to hold onto other than a rope, staked at intervals but not that easy to manipulate.  Certainly a challenge for small children, the elderly or those with poor mobility.  I would recommend that you stay at the upper viewing level if you want a safe but still fantastic views of the falls.  Photographers who are keen may have to queue to get to the front of the line for the close up shots."
"cool, but -","My husband and I were lucky enough to be able to roadtrip across Iceland. Godafoss was one of our last stops and it was very cool, but we saw much pretty waterfalls throughout Iceland. I found Godafoss too crowded to totally enjoy it, and it just wasn't my favorite Iceland site."
Stunning place,"An amazing place to visit... stunning scenery, and wonderful legends surrounding Godafoss. Yet another gem in the crown of Iceland."
Worth a visit,This waterfall provides you with breath taking views! So glad I have ticked this off my bucket list. It's around a 8 minute walk to the waterfall from the car park and does not have much of a climb to it.
Excursion ,An outstanding experience - it was  cold and had snowed recently but we were supplied with crampons to ensure safe walking
amazing and cold,"beautiful waterfall and my favourit part loves everything about it was so romintic , be carefull on the ice"
Amazing,Glad we wrapped up well and had crampons on our boots. Not too far to walk from bus drop off point. Well worth the effort
No words to describe it,"Amazing place to visit and just look at this majestic waterfall!! You can go to both side of the waterfall. At the left side, you can actually go down to the waterfall and see it from below"
Winter Wonderland!,Superb location and most spectacular view of the waterfall and surrounding snow capped scenery. We needed the ice spike overshoes provided by the coach guide. Slippery uner foot!
Size matters lol,All the pictures make this place look like Niagara - think lego version - its compact and bejou!!  Nice falls but really not that noteable
Incredible by moonlight,By the light of the full moon in winter this was an incredible sight.  Easy walk to get there and the atmosphere was terrific.
spectacular waterfall,"Simply put, this is a must see if you're in the area.  It's just a couple hundred yards off the Ring Road, and a short walk to an amazing viewpoint.  We went in winter when it is even more amazing.  There is a good gift shop and small cafe.  Access is free."
amazing waterfall,very cold minus 12 but so beautiful paths good as packed snow but if icy crampons might be good idea.
Breathtaking ,"I didn't know what to expect, but I certainly didn't expect what I found. Absolutely stunning views, the magnitude of the waterfalls was just incredible, I was speechless for a good 10 minutes, just admiring the beauty. Its definitely worth a trip"
Magnificent View,"If there is one thing you will learn in Iceland, it is the transformative power of water.  Godafoss is one of the waterfalls you don’t want to miss.  It is conveniently located on the Ring Road, so you won’t have to go out of your way to see it, either."
Waterfall visit,"Beautiful and stark landscape in the winter, a bit icy, be careful, would suggest investing in a pair of ice grips for your shoes, the sell them at fuel stops"
What a view,"Close to the road, so fairly easy access.  Simple cafe nearby to supply coffee and snacks. Toilet is available."
Stunning,"Amazing waterfalls, just a short walk from the car park. we saw them in winter with all the frozen ice & they are amazing."
Breathtakingly beautiful and rugged ,"Loved this. Really worth a visit not far from akureyri where we were staying, about a 40 minute drive. Thick snow but walkable and well worth the walk!"
amazing place during winter,"Easy to access, only afew meters from Route 1.The path is well maintained even in winter.The blue colour of water is amazing among the ice."
Beautiful waterfall,"I have seen some beautiful waterfalls in my time, but this one tops my list.It’s the colour of the aqua-marine water, with the back drop of snow, that sets it apart from all other waterfalls. A short walk from the car park, through deep snow, is well worth the effort."
Beautiful,"Very pretty the ice had frozen some of it and made it stunning, it had snowed but the path had been cleared"
It's the King of the North!,We visited Godafoss in June with Arctic Fox Travel. It is truly a awe inspiring to see and feel the beauty and the power of these falls.  Add to it the history and setting in the North of Iceland it makes you realize how we are just a breath in the dawn of the world.
Great Trip,"Lovely day out with Superbreaks tour company, beautiful sight and sound, was freezing cold so didn't hang around too long but don't miss it, plenty stops on the way and wonderful lunch stop."
Wow,"It was spectacular but never felt so cold. It's a must visit. This included other sites around the area Myvitan lake, Cow cafe and volcanic area, all in deep snow, fab"
WOW!,"This place took my breath away.  Being someone with a fascination for waterfalls, this is definitely the best i've seen. The power of the water, the colours and the fact parts of it are frozen, just incredible!  I'd love to return in the summer and see it again!"
Frosty Godafoss ,"It was bloody freezing cold minus 9 degrees Celsius, and the wind chill must have added easily another minus 10. The short trek up, battling the cross wind a snow was worth it. Taking gloves off hands to use cellphone quickly numbs from the frosty winds. Nonetheless, worth the…"
Godafoss on a very cold day.,"Spent time at Godafoss waterfall, even though it was a bracing minus 16 it was well worth visiting. The nearby gift centre and café were very welcome after the very cold weather."
The best Icelandic meat soup!,Excellent soup and the best hot chocolate athough the service was totally chaotic and disorganised. The views make up for it!
Godafoss waterfall north Iceland,"Goðafoss waterfall is aprox 50 km east of Akureyri. It is a wonderful sight and the landscape is fantastic. Goðafoss is half way to fantastic Myvatn area, which is about 80 - 90 km from Akureyri. Myvatn area is must see place in Iceland and in my opinion one of the most beautiful places in Iceland. Daytrip to Myvatn and stop over at Goðafoss is so much worth looking into."
Stunning,Absolutely breathtaking. Well worth the trip. You will not regret it. Just 45 mins from the town. Stunning
Well worth the trek,"Fabulous waterfall, well worth the trek in the snow. It was truly beautiful and photos don't do it justice."
Waterfall of the Gods,"In deep snow with a slight disability, I found the walk to the falls a little challenging, but I was determined to do it, & it was just so beautiful when I got there. It was snowing heavily too, but you just have to embrace these challenges & I had a great day."
Spectacular natural wonder,"One waterfall after another each impressing more than the last. The spray from Godafoss can be seen long before you reach the falls. It’s hard to believe that these natural wonders are free to visit and, apparently, not ‘managed’ in a touristy way. Very refreshing."
stunning place but very cold,great visit here but vvery cold so wrap up warm. ground very icy so make sure you have good footwear. slipped a few times but no real injury. but all is forgiven for the experience.
Lovely falls in the middle of an incredible natural setting,"We saw the falls in the early winter morning.  The sun was just peeking out so the falls were bathed in blue light.  There is a little walk to get to the viewing sight which makes it fun because the falls ""reveal"" themselves at the end."
Amazing,Awe inspiring especially in winter! Make sure you are well wrapped up and prepare to be dazzled! A treat for the eyes.
Beautiful..,"The view is simply stunning, but the view also depends on the time of the year. I was lucky to see some colours here whereas my friend who had visited this in Feb told me it was almost frozen (GOT way)."
Beautiful Falls,"This grouping of falls is very beautiful.  With two main falls and a third little one as well it was very beautiful from numerous angles.  You can also easily visit from both sides, so definitely take the little bit of extra time to do so.  The paths are well maintained and there was plenty of parking when we visited.  There were plenty of people as well, but it wasn't too difficult to get some decent pictures of just us either; just required a little patience.  There were some ongoing renovations/improvements being worked on when we visited, but it really didn't hamper us at all.  The views all around were gorgeous; don't forget to turn around and see the beautiful river scene from the water flowing away from the falls as well.  The souvenir shop/cafe nearby was nice and had restrooms (pay).  There is a foot bridge across the river as well which makes it easy to access both sides while parked on either."
Beauty at its best,"Cold but we'll worth a visit. This was partly frozen in first visit, but fast flowing in second. Beautiful scenery. Also  good souvenir shop with some beautiful crafted items."
Fabulous place,"A real flavour of the islandWalked by this, luv the power of the water,of the movin bits, and the ice all round it, the hushed people in awe of our trip out there, the peace of it all apart from the water sound was amazing. Brilliant guide who was so passionate about his island and the wildlife within it, the farming communities, the luvly staff at the cafe/gift shop."
Icelands famous falls,Very interesting place to visit  in Akureyi Iceland but go with someone who knows the area and history so much to learn
Breathtaking,Nature at its best. Wonderful. There is a cafe/gift shop at this location. WC facilities but they ask  200isk to use although this is paid into an honesty box.
Another great waterfall in Iceland ,"We nice waterfall even in bad weather, easy to get to and great for photos, certainly one of the best waterfalls to visit on Iceland."
Absolutely amazing place,Saw amazing Godafoss waterfalls. Fantastic place. Our tour guide took us walking around the area and there is a coffee shop here too for welcome warmth from the cold!
So beautiful!,In my opinion the waterfall is the most beautiful and amazing when it’s snowing! It’s best to find a time to go there when there are the least of tourists trips going there so you can enjoy the natural without having people running around everywhere.
Magicla landscape - with giant waterfall,We visited early morning in December so it was dark when we arrived and stayed until there was enough light to see huge waterfall .  Everything we expected and more
Stunning place,Visited here just after Xmas and what a breathtaking place. You can walk quite close to the waterfall. The colour of the water is amazing. This is a must see if you in this part of northern Iceland.
Stunning and Majestic Place.,"The Waterfall of the Gods is truly a “must-see” for visitors to North Iceland. It is magnificent.The walks from the car park to the viewing points are relatively easy, the surrounding landscape is otherworldly. There is a small café and gift shop but Godafoss is wonderfully unexploited. It, and the icy wind, took my breath away."
Very Popular,Very beautiful and therefor popular attraction. Part of our self-guided driving tour. Parking was easy and plentiful.
Beautifull ,"Beautifull waterfall, not far from Akureyri.Deserves a stop.We really enjoyed going there first time of Day light, nobody else was there and thé colors are amazing"
Beautiful ,On tour from the cruise ship they took us to this waterfall and we can only say it was beautiful. It shows Gods mighty creation through his power and it was good to hear that is where Christianity began in IcelandThe scenery around the whole area is wonderful and certainly worth visiting
Unfortunate History... but beautiful,"This was (unfortunately) where Iceland's ""Lawspeaker"" made Christianity the official religion of the country. But I won't fault the waterfall for that. ;) It was early enough in the day to have easy parking and few other tourists, so it was very pleasant. The sun had just risen, so it all looked incredibly beautiful. I would recommend it!"
One of the most beautiful waterfalls in Iceland,"This is my second favourite waterfall after Skogafoss in Iceland. It is beautiful and powerful. You can view it both sides which is very nice. In october the water was more blue than grey, which made it even more beautiful."
Hermosa! ,Easy to get in ! Few minutes from the parking and very good pictures of it :) no so much people during winter.
although iceland getting many waterfall but this one is beautiful enough,"although iceland getting many waterfall but this one is beautiful enough. less people than Gullfoss. the view & the shape also prettier. when i walk inside the main stream, the view of way along also beautiful. love it"
Must See after Dettifoss,"The Godafoss was one of my favourite falls in Iceland. Located after Dettifoss and before Akuyuri, it’s a good pit stop to rest and take in the falls. You can get some great pictures of the falls and good drone shots here as well"
Nice waterfall,Nice waterfall to 50 meters from the ring road. Easy to walk. I suggest to see it from both side. Stop ann enjoy
a great natural site. I would go again,This is a must-see if you go to Akureyri. Take a bus trip and see this and other sites. It took us 7 hours to see everything but it was well worth it.
Breathtaking!,One of God’s greatest creation!Went to see this amazing falls in winter time and eventhough it was frozen it was still beautiful and made me cry yet again and just so grateful to see it’s beauty.The place is so slippery so it’s better to use proper footwear.Enjoy!
This was another Amazing Waterfall.,We stopped at Godafoss Waterfall on our way to Akureyri.  It is a walk over rocks to really get close to the Waterfall. It is quite wide and very impressive.  When we walked back to the car you can see the raging river that is from the Waterfall.  A Must See. This does not have a fee.
My favourite,We saw a lot of waterfalls on our Golden Circle trip but this one was the most beautiful in my opinion. Not only because it‘s so wide but also due to the dramatic setting. On top of this it comes with a story about how people here abandoned their old gods. I took nice pictures on both sides of the falls.
Wonderful,"Loved this waterfall. So powerfully beautiful, like all waterfalls there is always a hike to get to them but so worth it."
Impressive waterfall,Great waterfalls located near the main road and easy to reach. Multiple viewing points and photographic opportunities available.
Instagram photo spot,Do not compare Icelandic waterfalls and if you won't then you will love it. There are standing spots on both sides and you can use both parkings to take multiple photos. Must to do spot.
Amazing ,"As expected, it did not disappoint. Beautiful landscape and awesome waterfalls to be seen. I highly recommend."
Beautiful  Godafoss,Godafoss waterfall is another beautiful waterfall in Iceland. So many vantage points to view from and get great pictures and videos.
Beautiful falls easy access,It’s an easy walk from a parking area to View this beautiful waterfall. Reminds me of a mini Niagara falls with the US and Canadian shaped water falls.
"Beautiful, despite the weather",Raining on and off when we visited although it was still worth a visit.  There are quite a lot of waterfalls in Iceland and this was one of my faves to visit.  Easy to walk around the perimeter and not too far a walk for those with walking difficulties.  Plenty of car parking spaces too.
Worth the Stop! ,Beautiful waterfall with very close parking. I’m told it is one of the most “powerful” in Europe. No bathrooms.
One of the very best Icelandic waterfalls,"One of the many 5-star Icelandic attractions. A 12-meter horseshoe-shaped waterfall with two main streams and a smaller one between. Extensive well-maintained paths make it easy to see the falls from a variety of angles. They face east, so morning is the best time to photograph them in full light. You can get atmospheric photos in the evening as the sun sinks behind the falls (depends on the time of year obviously). Restaurant, cafe and souvenir shop with a good selection of Icelandic pullovers."
One of my favorite waterfalls!,"This place is so serene. The waterfall is beautiful, but so is the view in the opposite direction of the water flowing down. There is a little bridge that goes over the water on the other side, which has almost as beautiful of a view as the actual waterfall :)"
"Ice, water, rainbows, and lots of photographers...","The pathways are easily accessible, wide, and full of people. This is a pretty big tourist area. I would recommend small crampons because even in early October, ice was already forming everywhere.Unlike most falls in Iceland that are up in the mountains, this set of waterfalls is actually on the plateau floor, so when approaching from a car, the mist off the waterfall almost looks like many of the other geothermal pools in Iceland.There was construction being performed on one side of the falls, so they had areas closed off, and while we saw signs for a restroom, we never found one. There were some shops nearby, but thy were closed when we visited. Plan on an hour to visit this waterfall, as you'll want to see it from both sides which will involve moving the car from one side to another and taking a walk. The walk is similar to that at Gulfoss, nothing major, but a small hike none-the-less.I would also recommend visiting early or late to be there when not as many people are there, as there were many when we visited, and it was fairly difficult to take pictures without people in them.Overall, we loved the beauty, size, and power of this waterfall. It produced rainbows, and was a great stop on our adventure."
Spectacular ,The falls in Godafoss takes your breath away. It is a beautiful sight not to be missed.  You will treasure your pictures forever. Everyone on our cruise ship loved that they chose this excursion. Not only are the waterfalls beautiful but then the water passes under a lovely bridge. You must go to Godafoss Falls!
"Far walk from road and icy, snowy path","This waterfall is very far from the parking lot.  The icy conditions of the pathway forced us to walk instead on the snow-laden shoulder which was not slippery.The waterfall itself is not that spectacular compared to some of the others.  At this point in the Iceland tour, seeing a major waterfall is becoming commonplace.  Little did I realize that Iceland is the place to view the beauties of nature.  In Norway we saw a few minor ones and in Denmark we saw none.One of the prime reasons to visit Iceland is to see the waterfalls."
The largest and most beautiful falls in Iceland.,"These falls are on the way, between Akureyri and Eggilstadr, in the northwest plateau region of Iceland.  They are just off the main ""ring road"" that encircles the country.  Easy access to either side of the falls, since it's only 100 meters from the road.  The sounds and sites are memory-making, since you can literally walk to the edge of these falls, and if stupid enough, you could walk across."
Powerful,"Powerful falls, but not the most interesting or beautiful of Iceland’s many waterfalls. Quite off the road as well if you’re in a rush. Take the western route to get there, not the road along the east coast."
One of the most beautiful,For me it is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Iceland. It is not that tall but is wide. It is worth to do the trail on both sides since it provide two different perspectives of the waterfall. Loved the color of the water
Beautifol wiev,there is a very beautiful waterfall. Those who like taking pictures can enjoy themselves in this place.
Great view,It was nice to see the falls. Need to make sure there is no rain. Check weather forecast. Good to visit.
So cool!!,This was SICK! See it! One of the best site seeing destinations in Iceland! It’s one of those where you don’t have to hike a million miles to see the waterfall. There are views from multiple areas. We went early in hopes that not a lot of other tourists would be there!
This place is beautiful!,"Be prepared for a HUGE waterfall... and bring your rain gear, just in case of winds, as you'll get a bath in certain areas."
Beautiful Falls Close to Akureyi,Took a tour from Akureyri to Godafoss using Midnight Sun Travel which has offices in Akureyri and Reykjavik.  Smaller tour operator that was near our ship's dock.  Price was reasonable for the 2-2.5 hour trip out to the falls ($60 US cash or $70 on a credit card).  Nice drive to the falls which are spectacular.  Lots of people go there but on our visit the number wasn't too bad.  Beautiful pictures.  There is a large gift shop and coffee/sandwich shop.  You could easily rent a car and drive there.  Smaller bus made the trip much nicer.
Easy access to magnificent waterfalls,My husband and I saw these falls as part of  a 6 day bus trip of Iceland in September.  While it was very cold the easy walk on the path to see these falls was well worth weathering the weather.  They are wonderful.  There was also a very reasonably priced and well stocked gift room. Unfortunately our bus time table only allowed minimal time to shop here as it was very hard to leave the beautiful falls.
Too crowded,"although this waterfall is beautiful, it’s in my opinion way too crowded.. you can barely walk around and there is no chance of getting a good picture."
Beautiful waterfall!,"This waterfall is gorgeous, definitely worth a visit. It can be crowded at times, even in mid October."
"easily accessible, beautiful",Right off the ring road - walk from either side (one to the west or one from the gas station).  Impressive views - not to be missed.
Very stunning,"It's right off the ring road and therefore easy to get to. Not as large as Dettifoss, but quite stunning nevertheless."
Now this is what you call a Waterfall,"Iceland has more than 36,000 named waterfalls and this is is one of the best of them- it is a a bit of hike form the car park across a valley but well worth the effort - HUGE and  so MUCH water - it won't disappoint youWell worth a visit if you are in the area"
Must See,Stunning location wonderful photo opportunities. We went with a tour group but saw many people on self-guided tours which I would do next time
Be careful not to fall in,One of Icelands great waterfalls with muddy waters. Really have to take good care of your steps as you easily get traumatised if glaring into the water for long.
Amazing waterfall,Lovely waterfall near the road without too much climbing with a beautiful view from either side. Should not be missed.
Possibly my favorite view of Iceland,"The falls and the aqua blue river flowing past the walking bridge - incredible.  Natural beauty with great walking area. Dress warmly - we were there in September and it was quite windy, we were well bundled and needed to be. Has a little gift shop with snacks and restrooms."
Top 5 Waterfall!,For me this is a top 5 waterfall. It’s huge. It’s horseshoe shaped. It has a side fall. Work on the walkway gave up close exposure to those brave enough to walk the uneven surface to the top of the falls. There are 2 points on each side of the river to view the falls. See it from both sides. Also we were staying in the area so in the evening it was raining but by the next morning the side rain had stopped. It’s better without the sideway rain. Plan time to walk and see.
Breathtaking!,This had to be the most breathtaking waterfall in all of Iceland. We saw many waterfalls but this was the one we spent the most around of time at. There is a parking area on each side of the falls but this one actually has a small walking bridge slightly downstream that will allow you to access both sides of the falls without moving your vehicle. We explored the entire area including the top of the falls and even going down to the rocks and touching the water at the base of the falls. There are so many good picture opportunities here. Definitely plan to spend at least 1 hour at this location. Some walking will be necessary to have a full unobstructed view of the falls.
Beautiful waterfall in the north,"If you are travelling in the north Iceland you should definitely stop at Goðafoss, you can take a look at this beautiful waterfall from 2 sides which both are soo nice :)"
Awe inspiring,Absolutely wonderful. Go early as possible to avoid the crowds.The waterfall was amazing and among the top ones from all of Iceland.
My second waterfall in Iceland..,"We were there about 5pm, it is a windy and cold evening even though it is summer in Iceland. This beautiful waterfall really really wide, so there is 2 parking one left one right while the waterfall in the middle. So you can went both and took photos from different angle."
So beautiful,"Unexpected beauty way up north in ICELAND , was so impressed with the courtesy extended by the locals, just loved everything there, the Christmas shop was the frosting on the cak"
Stunning!,This waterfall was stunning and beautiful.  We were there on a windy and cold morning but it still took your breath away to see it!
Beautiful!,Must see! Nice place to spend a couple of hours--gift shop nearby with restrooms and cafeteria. There's also an inn with a restaurant. Impressive waterfall!
Another of Iceland's beautiful waterfalls!,We stopped to see this waterfall while on our trip around the ring road.  We also filled our water bottles as we did regularly on our trip..
Incredible ,"The views overlooking Godafoss are spectacular and the scenery to get there is astounding. We passed snow capped mountains, grassy valleys and stunning streams. The story behind Godafoss is an Icelandic Saga that must be known before you visit. The waterfall takes on a whole new level of interest when you understand the saga. You can walk all around Godafoss and if you are very careful you can even get down to water level. There is a cafe nearby serving quite delicious food. You can warm up with a delicious hot chocolate while taking in the beautiful scenery."
Great waterfall ,"Godafoss waterfall is between Myvatn and Aukureyri on Highway 1 in Iceland. There are two sides to approach the waterfall from. Personally we preferred the side where the restaurant and gift shop is, there is a footbridge that connects the two sides. The waterfall is very impressive and one of the must sees in Iceland."
beautiful,Well worth seeing.  Unfortunately weather could have been better.  We were here 2 years ago and it could not have rained any harder.  This time it was just drizzling.  Must be phenomenal in good weather.
Another side of the road waterfall,"Iceland is absolutely stunning and so much of it is easily accessible right on the side of the main road.  Of course, there are many other sites that require some hiking, but for anyone that want to do a quick stop once in a while, this is one of those stops!"
One of the best,"Don’t drive past this spectacular complex of waterfalls. Simply awesome, but suggest you walk both sides to obtain the best perspective and also photographs. Highly recommended"
Stunningly Beautiful Waterfall,I was shocked at the beauty of this waterfall. Iceland has so many waterfalls that are truly amazing but I think this was the most beautiful of the many I saw. It is easy to access and well worth the effort. The way the two rivers converge and how it divides in the middle is just so beautiful. I don't feel that the pictures do it justice. It has so much more impact in person.A storm had recently gone through the north when we went and it was still easy to get to a decent viewing spot. I think it should be worth the effort any season.
Amazingly beautiful waterfall!,"This is a must-see waterfall; the weather was rainy and windy, but it was great to photograph. There is a paved walkway on either side of the river and the falls are close to a gas station where snacks may be purchased. The waterfall, from afar, reminded me of Niagara Falls in New York but you could get closer. A major plus is that I got to photograph the ptarmigans. I have not seen one and they were starting to get their winter plumage. Great fun to see! Highly recommended."
Beautiful natural wonder,This Waterfall is close to Akureyri and should be a must see even in inclimate weather. There is a walk from the parking are to the falls. You can enter from both sides. It is really a site To see. Expect to see a number of people here. There is also a coffee shop and gift shop located close by.
Stunning,"Only about 45 minutes from Akureyri and absolutely worth the trip.  We went in September and there were plenty of people, but not totally overrun.  We were able to get lots of photos without anyone in them.  We parked on one side, checked out the waterfall and then walked over the bridge to view from the other side as well.  We like to hike, so it was nice to incorporate a bit of a walk while enjoying the stunning view.  We thought Godafoss was one of the prettiest waterfalls.  But there are so many great ones!"
lovely and accessible,"Godafoss is just off Highway 1, and close enough to the parking area that the possible 40 mph winds should not be a deterrent. some locals prefer it to the massive (by comparison) Dettifoss, for its shape. we enjoyed the convenience, given tough weather. note: second half September can be very cold and windy."
Stunning even in snow,"There’s actually two sets of falls here but the second set is much closer to the road.  Godafoss is stunning to see, even in lousy weather!"
Great,We drive the ring road and we’re able to stop and see this amazing waterfall.  Short walk from the parking area. Not too many tourists   Gem of Northeast Iceland
The terminus of our tour from Akureyri,The falls were the turn around point for our tour from the port of Akureyri. The waterfall was OK but by itself it was not worth the effort. The whole tour was very good as our guide provided excellent commentary and we were able to a sense of life in rural Iceland.  There is…
Magnificent Falls,One very nice advantage about Godafoss is that it is close to the access road.  You can see it as you approach on the roadand it is within easy walking distance if walking happens to be difficult for you.  It is a beautiful wide falls.  With some short walks you can see this…
Just beautiful!,"We really enjoyed these falls! You can view both sides of the falls and walk to the bottom on the one side. As others have said, there is construction for what looks like viewing platforms. People are able to get to the edge of the falls now.  The falls are gorgeous from both…"
Giant Falls; walk both sides,One of THE falls you come to see in Iceland. We went with a tour van like almost everyone else because everything in Iceland is 2 hours from anything else.  The positive is that it’s an amazing sight and you should be on your own schedule to spend as much time as you want here. …
Bigger than Niagra Falls!,This is an amazing waterfall. So worth the stop. You can get close and there seems to be rainbows every now and then. Spectacular waterfall.
A Great Sight to see,"These falls, whilst not the greatest in the world, are interesting and very scenic in this wide open landscape. Easily approached from car parks by paths which are being improved along both sides of the Skalfandafljot river you come to the falls in about 10 minutes. Many viewing places to stand and can approach to very sides of the falls which tumble in two main sections. We saw fall jumpers preparing and also kayaking.Great to stand and marvel at the power of the water and then walk back along the fast flowing river to Café and Shop.."
"Befitting title: ""Waterfall of the Gods""!","If you're in the Akureyri area in Iceland, this is a must visit.  The path to see the whole waterfall is easily walkable where there are photo opts along the way.  The walk takes about 10-15 minutes and at the end, you will see the whole majestic waterfall as it is meant to be seen.  Definitely a worthwhile excursion to come here.  A word of caution:  When we went, the flys were so numerous we did not dare to talk as any small opening in the mouth would result in a fly entering.  If you have a mosquito headgear netting, this would be a good place to use it..."
Stunning!,"You can walk all around these falls, some were going so near the edge, but they seem to be in the process af building viewing areas with barriers to stop the public from approaching too close. I can understand why, because there were so many people near the edge! At the moment you can go all around the falls including down to the waters edge, the steps are a little precarious and sturdy footwear is necessary. The general pathway on the top is a very easy walk though. There is also a cafe which is clean and the facilities are good. Allow a couple of hours to enjoy this lovely site."
Wish we had more time.,"We were on a tour and only had one hour to explore the Falls.  The area is expansive and the view is different from each vantage point (the bridge, the left of the falls, the right of the falls, upper rail, lower trail, etc).Lots of parking.  Large gift shop and cafeteria with ample restrooms."
Beautiful Foss,This area has the beautiful Godafoss waterfall and more. The falls are impressive and a beautiful blue color. There is a smaller fall downstream near the bridge. Another waterfall is approximately 40 minutes away. We lucked out and got to watch kayakers going over Godafoss. The site has a good cafe and souvenir shop.
Gorgeous,Its a place to just reflect and think about life.  it was a great spot to really just disconnect. stop here its a must.
Wonderful!!,"This waterfall is breathtaking! We’ve been lucky to also have rainbows at 3 waterfalls, including this one! I love them for the refreshing smell and  sound."
Stunning,"Really beautiful, a bit of a walk but my 83 year old mother managed with no problem. Well worth it. The views are spectacular, quite a breathtaking place."
Beautiful ,"Really impressive series of waterfalls, lovely clear and blue rivers! Free to park, not too far to walk to. Nice area to explore and great gift shop."
unbelievably beautiful waterfall - easy walk from the parking lot to the waterfall,"Godafoss is truly magnificent - maybe one of our favorites of our entire trip around the Ring Road.  Godafoss means ""waterfall of the Gods.""  It is 39 feet high and 98 feet wide.  There was a LOT of construction going on when we were there - appears they are building a restaurant or information center or something.  Legend says that in the year 999 or 1,000, that Porgeir Ljosvetningagoor made Christianity the official religion of Iceland, and that after returning from Alpingi, he threw his beloved statues of the Norse gods into the waterfall, hence the name Godafoss."
Easy to get to and beautiful,Well developed for tourist traffic and it looks like they're adding some additional gift-shop/ information center building.  Beautiful falls.
Awesome waterfalls,"Amazing waterfall. You are able to get up close to this beautiful, thunderous waterfall. A must see while visiting Iceland!"
Most colorful falls in Iceland,"We almost missed this spectacular place until we saw the cars. What a mistake that would've been! Truly my favorite waterfall in all of Iceland...so blue, with rainbows and gorgeous views at every turn. Can walk to either side. DO NOT MISS THIS!"
Godafoss by local bus,The very friendly and informative staff at the information and visitor's center suggested we could easily go by local bus to visit Godafoss.  So we enjoyed an afternoon ride out to the falls where we had plenty of time to walk and marvel at these amazing falls before the bus came back to pick us up.
Waterfall of the Gods,"Our first official planned stop was Goðafoss waterfall, which translates to the waterfall of the gods. It is closely linked to the conversion to Christianity in Icelandic history."
Beautiful waterfalls!,"Godafoss was our first look at a big Iceland waterfall.  We saw many more, but this was an impressive one, with lots of good rocks to climb on.  It was nice that it was so close to the road."
Fantastic falls easily accessible,The falls are very close to the car park and the walk to them is short and not onerous although not sure wheelchairs could gain close access. The volume of water over the falls is impressive.
Mesmerizing,"This is a waterfall you don’t want to miss when in Iceland. It truly is the Waterfall of the Gods. It is very touristy but we were able to hike a small ways to the bottom of the falls where only a handful of tourists were, which is something I recommend over the token rock picture most seem to want to take. The hike is easy for small children and the pictures turn out amazing with less people in them. We were also able to experience the grandeur of Godafoss without the danger of falling off the rock. It was mesmerizing."
Easy access and beautiful,"Godass was the first big waterfall that I have seen in Iceland, and I think it is really beautiful. We had some sun when we visited it, and the colors of the water were super blue. You definitely should stop there!"
Always take the weather with you,Sunny day is not obvious for Iceland this summer. But we were optimists and enjoyed every moment. It was  a beautiful weather that day when we've arrived Godafoss. It is one of so many that you must to see. Highly recommend!
Magnificent Scenery..,"We stopped as part of a day tour from Akureyri. It was the first stop, and as far I’m concerned the highlight of the tour. Although the tour was really great, nothing could compare the raw power of nature at these falls. You are free to wander pretty much as far as you wanted in the time available, or you can just stand mesmerised looking at the falls. It only took a few minute to walk a bit upstream and take loads of pics without people in the shot.Note : There are Free Toilets next to the main building."
Loved it!,We really enjoyed hiking around and exploring this beautiful waterfall.  It was magnificent and easy to access. Highly recommend!
Beautiful Waterfall,This is a must see waterfall in Iceland.  It's not too far from the parking lot and there are various viewpoints.
Waterfall of the gods,"Lovely place. You don't have to walk too much to see the waterfall. The spectacle is very atmospheric,  even if other waterfalls are higher and bigger this one has something that we loved."
Nothing special,Right off Route1.  Easy walk from parking lot.  Not very big falls.  I wouldn’t make a special trip. About 30 minutes from Akureyri and Myvatyn.
Favourite waterfall in Iceland ,"This was our favourite waterfall in Iceland. Easy to access from car park with a bridge that linked both sides of the waterfall. As we reached about 8 am, the area was not crowded with tour groups and we were able to take our time to enjoy views from both sides, including a rainbow. Do visit early in the morning."
Truely the best in Iceland,"This is not as large as Dettifoss but very beautiful water falls. We were coming from the east side on our way to Akureyri. It was windy and cold, and raining, but we went every spot to see this majestic falls. Lots of visitors so parking can be difficult. Must visit"
Our favorite waterfall ,"Lovely. Right next to Route 1, simple to get to, restaurant on site, easy to see falls from both sides of canyon via a bridge, highly recommend."
Majestic and Easy To See,We did a tour with Wild Westfjords that included Godafoss Falls. The falls can be seen from the road and the pathways closer to the falls are easy to walk. Not as large as Niagara but powerful. Interesting rock formations are in the river just past the bridge.
Another magnificent waterfall in Iceland - easy to walk around,"You see so many waterfalls in Iceland that there is a danger you will become rather blase. Thankfully each of them is unique and therefore offers a different experience. There is good free parking here on both sides of the river and good paths lead to the falls. When we visited they were building a new viewing platform which I am sure will further enhance the experience. The building work did not negatively impact on our visit as it is low key and small scale. Walking down river from the spectacular falls leads to a further fall and a lovely pedestrian bridge over the river which provides good views of the river and lower falls - you also get a glimpse of Godafoss. At this end there is also a petrol station and cafe where there are pay for toilets. If you go upstream from the falls there are beautiful views of the river and its tributaries. Despite other people being there, it felt very peaceful. We would recommend stopping here."
one of the big fall,"very exiting to hear it and to look at huge water fall; very easy to reach, parking is not very far; the only problem - if the weather would be good"
Iconic Icelandic Waterfall ... Must SEE!,This waterfall is incredibly beautiful.  It is like a mini-Niagara Falls.  There are paths leading to the falls area.  Easy walk from parking.
It's worth a stop if you're in the North,"It was a lovely waterfall to see. Good for social media picture taking :pThere isn't much to hike, so this is a good spot if you have younger kids or older travelers who can't walk a lot to see a waterfall.The drive to Godafoss is nice and scenic, but the falls were overly spectacular. I'm from Toronto, so Niagara Falls is kind of in my backyard, so I am a bit biased!"
Very picturesque!,"Beautiful waterfalls with great photo points. Easily accessible, not much walk required to get the views."
Cool but not remarkable,"One of many waterfalls in Iceland, near to the Ring Road, light blue color of water, many tourits paths all around, easy opportunity to take some cool pictures. Free parking. Time to spend: 30 min"
God's waterfall,"This place is stunning, a great tip is to go to the left (when facing the waterfall) and down for some impotent photos. Its may be gauzy crowded, this year on one of our visits 15 buses where parked there, if possible go early or late to avoid crazy crowds."
"The ""Waterfalls of the Gods"" were beautiful.","The waterfalls and surrounding areas will take your breath away, and there are lots of spots to take memorable photos."
1 of our 3 highlights on an Iceland tour,"There are so many beautiful and mighty waterfalls in Iceland; I believe more than in Hawaii. The Godafoss waterfall we liked best. It is unique, it actually consists of 3 individual waterfalls. Left and right one big each, in the middle a small waterfall."
Stunning,Well worth the trip! It gets better and better with each step . Looks for smaller ones hidden among rocks at the bottom!
One of several must see waterfalls,"Stunning not just in terms of the actual falls but also the walk around the river, which features many smaller streams and flowers.  A must see."
Wow wow wow,"We almost missed these falls? We arrived by cruise liner at Akureyri and all the tours were were booked out.We went to the Hof at Akureyri the lovely young lady there said that there was possibly the chance of a tour to the waterfall the next morning and she was waiting to hear from the tour company, Midnight Sun Tours.We waited for word until she got sick of us asking and called the tour company, yes the tour would go ahead we paid $75.00 USD and the next morning at ten o’clock we arrived at the bus, a reasonably new and well appointed bus not a huge coach nice and easy to hear the excellent commentary in English by Akri the Icelander tour guide and driver.The trip to the falls was as informative, scenic and interesting as the falls itself, about a one hour trip through farmland, snow capped mountains and lakes.On arrival we were dropped off at the path to the falls, what a fantastic spectacle the glacier melt water is always so clean and looks blue, the water coming from the falls, was beautiful, the path meanders along the river until you see the spectacular falls, much the same shape but a bit smaller than Niagara, the rainbows thrown up on the sunny day were spectacular and the falls mesmerising.A great day, interesting and informative, so glad we did it, if it’s a short tour of about 2.5 hours you want? Do this you will love it."
Worth the distance travelled,Caught some awesome moments at Godafoss (waterfall of the Gods)just off the Ring Road between Myvatn and Akureyri in the north.
Great place,Came here as part of an excursion from our cruise. Very scenic!  Would definitely recommend if you come here.
Washed away,Some much water and a roar. The sides of the gorge had interesting rock formations some looked like shapes.
