Good cheap shopping ,"Old bazar offers variety products from handbags, shoes, clothing to spices in very attractive prices. Unfortunately do to covid19 restrictions not many tourists shopping around- shopkeepers are desperate for business."
Nice location ,Very nice location and great for shopping and restaurants.Lots of shops selling usual tourist stuff and nice marina.
Very Pretty,Lovely harbour to have a stroll there were people swimming also next to the old town both worth a visit.
nice place with history,"the area has good food, good bars, full of holidaymakers, breathtaking views, has every thing needed. sea food amazing"
Beautiful and peaceful escape from the main city centre,Beautiful and Tranquil setting with cheap car parking right now to the harbour (which we found by accident) - some nice restaurants looking over the bay
Surprisingly good ,"I must say, I am very impressed with Kaleici. I am here for 5 nights before heading towards Kas, probably stopping off at Adrasan on route. I thought 5 nights in Kaleici might be to many nights, I thought we might run out of things to see and do, but the place is a labyrinth of bars, restaurants, shops, bazaars, it is absolutely fantastic. Bars for young and old, classy and local food eateries, I am well impressed.  You can stay in the old town, book a pension or small hotel, and wander around for hours. Go outside the gates (Hadrian) and discover further afield on the excellent Tram/Bus systems"
Beautiful place,A must visit when visiting Antalya. We had no idea that even this city had so much history attached to it.
Old town,"Ancient history hand to hand with modern city. People are very open, helpful. More than 100 small hotels. You can choose based on your interests. If you prefer to be closer to bars, restaurants- closer to Hadrian Gates."
kaleci old town,got public bus from lara to visit kaleci. pretty old town to spend half day looking round. there is a lift from here down to the harbour. due to the pandemic not many places open but still worth going to look round all the old streets very interesting.
Walk through the old town.🌹,"Start your journey from the embankment and get to the very center of the old city Kaleichi. After passing the mosque, turn left and you will get to the observation deck from which you can see the old port.  Take a picture, then after the gazebo there will be a staircase, go along it boldly and you will find yourself in the old port.  You need to go everywhere and if your stomach allows you, be sure to take pomegranate juice along the way👌.  I liked it right after descending the stairs in front of the stairs leading to the port.  By the way, free toilets (W/S)  are located there.  Enjoy your vacation, if you have any questions, your contributor will help you😘"
Stunning and a must,"It's hard to believe you're in Turkey when walking around. The old town is just stunning.  We likened it to being in Italy or similar. The streets are small and intermit with many loverly shops, cafes, bars and restaurants. There are a few dodgy 'knock off' shops that try the hard sell but other than that, which is expected in Turkey, it's a beautiful place."
Beautiful ,It’s definitely worth visit. I suggest walking around to absorb atmosphere and enjoy food. There are plenty of shops to buy souvenirs and drink the long evenings dry.
Sweet sweet old town,What I loved there most was a possibility to wander there for hours. Those narrow streets of the old town with coloured houses are really nice. There is a restaurant or a cafe at every corner. As I love history I appreciated a chance to see some artefacts of Roman and Turkish culture. There are green parks next to the sea. And so many cats everywhere! :)
Nice place,hi easily to get to from late beach  in 40 minutes lots of instructing  small streets ro wander through however can get lost easy . No one pester us could easily look in shops no hassle found some instructing things to look at
 Beautiful ,The old town is simply beautiful So much to see and doThe restaurants are top quality So pleased we stayed here and not in an all inclusive hotel
Nice hamlet,Lovely place to sit and enjoy a cold beer looking out onto the small harbour and blue sea. Lots of tourist type shops with bars and restaurants on the water front. Definitely worth a visit.
Lovely little town worth a visit,We visited the Kaleci from Lara beach which was a long bus ride. The marina was lovely and the cobbled streets were lovely. Lots of little shops and stalls and restaurants to choose from. Defo worth a visit if in Antalya.
Afternoon out ,Spent a nice afternoon with drinks on the harbour and a little shopping. What more can I say it a must see and will replace any market trip.
Hearth Of The World,Is there any better place in the world?This place is in the centre of the city wher emodern buildings are welcoming you right after this historical town!Never could find better :)
Excellent Harbour and Old Town,"The Antalya Harbour and Old Town is beautiful. You have nice sea food restaurants on the Harbour and beautiful winding streets with souvenir/gift shops, carpet shops and replica bag. Everyone is willing to deal and you can bargain to your hearts content. There are some historical places such as the old mescit, clock town and Hadrian's Gate. The market opens into the Tophane Park which has nice cafes and the main city bazaar which has nice restaurants and shops. Loved it."
Gorgeous!!,"Walking through old town reminds me a little bit of walking the mazes of Venice. It's perfect to browse and get lost among the many streets. There's a marina with restaurants, a bustling area with bars and restaurants and also an area full of shops selling everything from teas to jewellery and clothing.You cannot visit Antalya without going to Kaleici!"
Old town ,Nice calm place any time of the day Old town good vibes. Must see for some hours  very much to explore around here
Best and cheep,"No problem, we have arrived Antalya 5 days ago. No covid restrictions anywhere. You can find all on our YouTube channel. Hot Chili busters"
Lovely place to visit,"A beautiful little place to visit with cobble streets,great views, interesting little shops and lots of places to eat and drink. We had a lovely Turkish ice cream by the park looking down on the Harbour. Cafes in the park sell delicious fresh fruit juice. Locals are pleasant and not too pushy. So sad to see shops and streets so empty. Let's hope the holiday industry picks up soon for Turkey"
Best place in Antalya,"Right in the heart of Antalya. So much to do with a great mix of restaurants, tourist sites and activities. Throughly enjoyed this family trip. We hired a car and it is something I would recommend although driving can be a little tough due to narrow streets."
A walk through coziness ,"Fantastic place in Antalya. Romantic, cozy, great views and a glance at old times. A multitude of places to chose from going from street food, nice hipster hostels/pubs, traditional Turkish meals to healthy juice bars. Great hidden places where you can dream away of ancient times, walks between the ancient city walls and terraces with views you only see in postcards. Worth visiting"
Nice charming sea town.,Really loved this area in Antalya. Had a different charm and felt like the town had a soul. Especially liked the little local shops near the sea. Streets were very pleasant to walk in and very charming. Reminded me a little bit of Italy. You can get nice photos from the cliff which overlooks the ocean. Lots of pretty cats also in the area.
Authentic turkey,"I love this town, its what us brits call ""oldie worldie"" narrow cobbled streets. Lovely quaint shops and restaurants,with views. You just have to go to see for yourself and l assure you, you wil just love it!"
Amazing old city!,"It’s very nice place!!! Enjoy magnificent view to the sea. The old town with its narrow streets, cafes, and shops is a real paradise for tourists who look for romantics."
Lovely...,"It's not too expensive to get there from any hotel. Bus or Taxi. We went on a warm Feb day and it was so funny to see Turks in their full clobber with their big coats on when it was so warm for us. Lovely views, We had a Horse and cart/carriage ride which you can haggle the price. They pull over half way and take your photos by the sea for you with your own camera then he takes you back. Lots of little stalls and millions of shops. Visited Hadrian's Wall so don't forget that bit. Only went there to see the sights and brought back some lovely souvenirs. They will try and encourage you to buy from their stalls in the markets but that's to be expected."
A Jewel in the Antalya Bay,"What a place !!! Just wonderful, little streets of yesteryear winding from the ""Hadrian's Gate"" down to the waterside marina with Ottoman and Byzantine buildings lovingly restored to gaze at in awe.Numerous Cafes, Restaurants and boutique hotels where one is welcomed with typical Turkish generosity.The view point at the ""Toplani"" cafe is where this picture is taken from which allows you to see how much the Romans achieved of which a lot remains to view.Within the old city walls the narrow streets are adorned with numerous colourful Bougainvillea plants which are just stunning in flower.Finally if your after those quaint Boutique hotels for a night or two on a city break this is the place ! Everything on your doorstep with Sunshine too, most have their own pools if you prefer to the sea.My favourites were The White Garden an Ottoman merchants mansion just superb, or the Dogan both of which are surrounded by great bars and restaurants."
Beautiful old town,"Great and charmful old town with a mix of tourists and locals. Great scenery, shops selling a variety of items where haggling a must. Nice beautiful paths down to the marina and great place to pass the time. On way back there is a lift that takes you back up and into the main throngs of the city centre of Antalya. Great settings for pictures as well."
Old town charm ,"Definitely one of the best old towns to visit. We got surprisingly great weather for April. It was warm and sunny! Perfect day to browse around the old town, take in the sites and have ice cream!"
Fabulous,"Exploring the many little lanes and alleyways to discovering fantastic restaurants, boutique hotels, vistas, the harbour and more. Reminiscent of Rhodes Town but definitely not, Kaleici delights and in winter is much quieter allowing you to explore without the crowds. Delightful!"
Old Town stroll,"The clock tower is the entrance to the old town  which can be a little difficult to find, especially if you arrive by bus from the tourist areas. Try to avoid the self-appointed tourist guides there to rip you off.Once within the old town it is relatively peaceful with limited hassle from the street sellers.  Be careful what you buy as we bought a bag and the zip didn't last 24 hours!  Streets are steep but manageable.The new town above the old town is not really geared towards tourists and we found it difficult to navigate to find the returning bus stop."
Absolutely Beautiful,"The center of Antalya with pretty much all attractions around there. 1. You can dine in the Old town, there is a huge varieties of food to choose. 2. If you are into shopping, you can buy replicas, t shirt and souvenirs over there. Things are a little bit overpriced but cheaper than the things in Istanbul. 3. The Hadrian Castle Gate is somewhere near, make sure to check it out. 4. In case you want to visit mosque, go to the Yivliminare Mosque. 5. Enjoy :)"
Comfprtable and trustworthy service provider - Moonstar Tour,"I visited Istanbul and Antalya from 1 Jan to 5 Jan 2020 with my family.I booked my entire trip including pickup from Airport to city tour with Moonstar Tour. I spoke with Selina, Sales Manager. All travel & transfers were extremely comfortable. I really appreciate her efforts and commitment to serve guest to the best. We did not face payment related issue because of her trust on us, usually payment has to be made before the trip starts but due to some technical problem she did not bother us for prior payment, instead encouraged us to be comfortable first in trip then pay when ever get the network. Moonstar Tour is loyal to their guest. I highly recommend them as your trip partner in Turkey. Well done and thanks a ton for making our tour happy and successful. :"
Well worth several visits,"Lots of picturesque streets surrounding a very pretty harbour. Restaurants galore, boat trips if you so desire ( the sea looked a bit choppy for me to try in January!) The glass elevator down to the harbour is even free! Great to visit many tones."
"A mixture of Greek and Roman, Arabic and Balkanian culture of sailing","The air smells of pirates and piracy, adventure and risk, calm waves and open horizon, the light that never seems to collapse ... The pier stretches and closes the excellent bay and pictures that just wait for you to do ... of course the big temptation remains a cruise either it is a short one of only a few hours or an entire day one."
Kaleici,"Antalya best place is central location and the best food is always fish. Turkish Yeni Raki, marina, Mousk"
Nice place for seafood and a stroll,"We stayed in a hotel located in the heart of Kaleici. This place is famous for its seafood, bars and shops selling touristy stuff. We enjoyed the panoramic views in the area during sunset."
Atmospheric Kaleici,"The old town, Kaleici, is well worth a visit. The narrow streets and interesting shops create a wonderful atmosphere. Found shop-owners to generally be friendly and ready to offer directions. The Old Marina was great, as was Hadrian's Gate for taking photos. Plenty of places to shop and buy souvenirs. Restaurants and variety of food options available. Would highly recommend a half-day amble through this very historic and most interesting part of Antalya."
Magic little city,Love this majestic little town. Friendly people and great sights. Lots of history lies here and it feels like you've been transported back in time.
Unique!!,"Fantastic neighborhood of the Old Town, over the old port, around the clock tower. Interesting architecture of the low buildings, made mostly of stone and wood, usually ottomal style. Very vivid area even in winter, full of little shops, bars  and restaurants. Nature is present in all colours over the garden stone-walls, at the sides of the narrow, paved sokaks. Antalya golf is shining at the background..!"
Ancient heart of the city; great for walking and exploring,"Kaleiçi is the historic port and walled old town of Antalya.  Its name means ""Inside the Kale"" (Kale is a castle or fortress).  It started as the ancient city of Attalia, founded during the Hellenistic period, later becoming an important port in the Roman Empire.  Kaleiçi has a mix of historic buildings: Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk, Ottoman and modern Turkish republican, but most buildings date to the late 18th and 19th centuries.  Some of the traditional Turkish homes are still occupied by residents, and many have been converted into boutique hotels, restaurants, cafes, and shops selling handicrafts and folk arts.  It is a great place to explore cobbled streets, garden parks, historic mosques, traditional Turkish homes (wood with overhanging second-floor balconies), the harbor, and other historic sites.  A good place to start is Kale Kapısı, the main square, with the Saat Kulesi (clock tower), built during the reign of Ottoman Sultan Abdül Hamid II.  Look for the statue of King Attalus II of Pergamon, who founded the city of Attalia around 150 BC. From there, you can enter the old town by walking into Uzun Çarşı Sokak, located opposite the clock tower.  Kaleiçi is accessible at all times with no entry fee."
Mesmerizing Blues,"Breathtaking views of the Mediterranean from Antalya! Kaleici in Antalya refers to the old town area and the historical center of the city. It’s abundant with hotels, restaurants and shopping areas. If you are planning a visit, it’s ideal to stay in this area and plan a self guided walking tour to all the nearby attractions along with the Antalya Museum."
Kaleiçi,"a historical place where you can have fun with its old houses, cafes and shops around the clock. Have fun."
Antalya Old City,"When I first entered the gate, I was welcomed by debris of the building. But as I walked far more, I was met with a unique design of small houses. These small houses are the local's house, boutique hotels, restaurants, cafes, and souvenir shops. I also encountered Ottoman ornaments in this area. As I dug deeper into the end of this old city, I have found the hidden gem, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The locals were friendly. Even more, when they know I can speak a little Turkish. I would recommend this place 10/10"
Scenic place to visit ,"Kaleci otherwise known as the Old town, in my opinion is a multi-faceted part of Turkey. The No7 (Dec 2019) bus from Lara drops you off in the streets of Kaleci and then you can walk around the old streets. If you do need toilet you will need to pay €1.50 however if you pop to a global fast food outlet you can use it for free.The other part of Kaleci is the rocky sea front. To get to it there is a long and winding tiled road packed full of shops with vendors offering ‘nice price/good price’😂The ‘bus station’ is a actually not a covered building it is it a big bus stop with a couple of benches out in the open. This would have been helpful to know when we were looking for it and walking right past it."
😍,"What can i say for this place Kaleiçi, just go and see it, take you holiday the best ever. I was there only but and with my friends, it's not problem if you go only, you can feel really great about this. If you go in September is the best time because dont have so much tourist, have more free place in restaurant around there."
Antalya Old Town,"A perfect place to stay for a few days. Bars, restaurants, sights, all are closeby. Would have no hesitation in recommending a stay here."
Old Town Rocks!,Old Town is definitely the place to stay in Antalya... Lots of choices for stay and specifically food... Experience living by the side of marina and enjoy good music in evening as there are plenty options around... Love the streets...
Lovely old town,Cobbled streets and wonderful buildings are found throughout Kaleici along with many fabulous seafood restaurants. A great place to spend s few days exploring
Stayed in the old town.,I spent a week staying in the old town so had all the sights on my doorstep. The whole area is very safe with regular tourist police doing patrols by motorbike or electric car. The atmosphere is so good as there is history but it is combined with the current locals selling all sorts of goods. Would highly recommend.
Boat Tour was enjoyable,"Took a boat tour from the marina. Very nice scenery, worth the money. We were out for about an hour and enjoyed every minute."
Magical,Fantastic shopping eating drinking and chilling out like a trip back in time always something new to see
Must see in old town Antalya,I recommend having a meal at one of the authentic fish restaurants placed in the old port of Antalya.
Nice little streets with so much history,The streets of Kaleici are like a web of winding streets and buildings which hold so much character. Can easily get lost in these streets but its not large enough to be much of a problem. Anyone who visits Antalya must visit Kaleici. Filled with plenty of souvenir shops with lots of antiques and turkish/greek culture.
Stay in Kaleici!,We used Kaleici as our base to see Perge and Aspendos as well as explore surrounding areas.  Getting into Kaleici was difficult as we were driving and the app we used kept misdirecting us the first time. A helpful cab driver escorted us to our hotel. It was no problem once we saw the way.It is easy to use Kaleici for day trips  from Antalya and returning to Kaleici for dinner was a delight with the many restaurants to tempt us and fewer cars.
Fabulous ,We love going to the old town. Always something to do during the day. And it comes alive at night. Lots a very good restaurants and bars. Also a lot of bars have a singer or live entertainment.
Fun and scenic old town and harbor - with a swimming beach,"Old buildings, winding old streets, a place to get lost - but not large enough to be a problem. Borders a modern part of town on 2 sides away from the ocean. Lots of shops, boutique hotels, restaurants of all types, etc. lively at night in certain spots, quiet at other."
Amazing Kaleici,"The heart of Antalya! Wonderful place to visit both day and night. The old charming winding streets take you through the beautiful old area with charming ottoman houses, restaurants and small shops. The Marina is probably one of the most charming places I know."
Oldcity,Kaleiçi is one of the oldest district of Antalya. The region has its architecture. There are nice hotels and cafes.
Beautiful,All I can say is beautiful. The culture is so rich every person is so friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere is so calming and beautiful
Full of character and tourist shops,The old city that still has the old style buildings thought of modernisation is taking place. Walking thought he narrow roads you will find nice cafes and small restaurants plus the shops selling all sorts souvenirs.
Amazing ,"Lots to do for children including parks and lots of cafes and places to eat!We loved it, it wasn’t too busy and the people are lovely"
Back in time.,An impressively preserved city. Along with the Adrian Gate and the fortress are preserved ancient romantic houses. You can have a cup of coffee in the courtyards of the houses.
Great day out ...,"On holiday in Lara Beach we decided to visit Kaleici, Antalya Old Town.We used a taxi return trip and the driver waited several hours until we decided to return. Fee was 200TL. I believe you can pay a little less if you use a taxi on the meter but our way suited us.There is a lovely marina which offers boat rides around the bay and the views are pleasing to the eye.There are many shopping areas, each offering the many fake goods, tops, shoes, leather, bags..they may not be originals but the quality is very good.I love the banter to negotiate a price and the Turkish people love it too...all amiable, no hassle.During or after a shopping spree the area offers plenty of choices for a nice bite to eat or just a cold drink. A warm welcome is always available.A good few hours away from the surroundings of the resort."
Kaleici Best place,"The best place that you must visited every day in your trip , love it , The Kaleiçi area is located in the centre-eastern portion of the city along the mediterranean coast fronted by the yacht harbour that dates to the Roman era.The name Kaleiçi means ""Inside the Kale"" or ""Inner Kale"" (Kale itself"
Great experience,"Antalya is one of the best cities to visit especially for couples and family as a tourist.But should be very careful, we were 5 persons and rented a boat for an hour, it was a fantastic trip, boat crew was two persons. We trusted on them, left our hand bags at the end of bottom on tables and went to dock. After 1 day when my wife went to her hand bag to take money, noted some amount lost!!! While only place she left her bag when we were on boat.But in total Antalya is a very nice place to visit several times.Next trip will pay more attention."
Holiday ,Quaint old city plenty of souvineer shops and clothes shops to browse through well worth a visit using public transport with very cheap fare
The old port area,"My favorite area of Antalya city is the old port area. So historic, and beautiful with many shops, restaurants as well as historic sites."
Fantastic location,"Cobblestone streets, tons of restaurants and small shops, Marina, huge park. Kaleici means inside the walls of the castle so everything is walkable and very pretty. There's a small beach beside the marina with many stairs down, with loungers and umbrellas."
Good for authentic old city vibes. Just don't buy anything from the shops,"It's like a proper old city. You get authentic vibes of walking through some game of thrones like setting when you walk down to marina in the congested streets of Kaleici. The old stone houses and random towers, all add to the vibes. Plus, thousands of shops selling eatables to souvenirs to Turkish delights to even rugs and handmade paintings. And hundreds of cafes with people sitting outside sipping on tea or coffee and laughing their heart out. Graffiti on the walls. And the noise of mediterranean water bumping on the shore. It was an amazing experience. You will never get bored walking down these streets.Just be cautious while buying anything eatable from the shops though. Especially from the shops selling Turkish delights or Turkish tea at dirt cheap prices. I got a box of Turkish delights for 6 Lira from the old city as I thought it was so so cheap. I already had reservations about the authenticity of the sweets though so as soon as I bought the packet, I opened it up and tried it. And it was pathetic. So don't buy anything eatable from small shops unless they allow you to try it first.Also, Kaleici is very famous for its night life. This is the only place in Turkey where we saw everything light up as soon as the sun went down, Many pubs/bars and restaurants with live music and tourists dressed up for partying. If you like Thailand and Cambodia like partying, this place is certainly for you.Overall you can easily spend many hours here. Either roaming around the streets or in one of the cafes or restaurants by the road."
Stunning,Took some stunning pictures here and there are some lovely restaurants around the edge with great views of the boats. Try both daytime and night time if you like taking pictures.
"Nice, pretty, laid back! ",Loved the vibe of the whole place. All major attractions are close by. Also very well connected to other parts
Always a good spot for an evening walk ,"The old town and harbour is always a good place for an evening visit. Lots of little side street shops , bars and restaurants. I have never stayed there but there seems to be some nice little hotels and a lot of history."
Only saw the area around Hadrian's gate,Nothing old in the stuff around the gate except the repurposed parts of the old castle. Lots a restaurants and boutiques.
Lovely,We enjoyed walking through the old city and had a nice traditional seafood meal thereHighly recommend visiting it.
The heart of antalya,"Every year i come back to this place again and again,never bored,good sea view,good security,clean,good food, good bars,must visit personally i love this place"
Great,It is really a great beauty. All the beautiful city walls and cliffs together. One of the best to enjoy the view.
Antalya old town,"Kaleici (Antalya old town ) is full of narrow streets, tourist shops and restaurantsIn my opinion the best part is between Hadrians Gate and Hidirlic tower, if your there in the evening, take a stroll along the seaward edge of Karaalioglu park for great views and sunsets across the bay"
Old Town Antalya,"well worth a visit lovely old town with some nice quirky lanes to walk around and visit the shops there that then takes you down to the harbour which is lvly to see the boats thats in there, some nice food outlets to sit and have a drink etc."
Beautiful place,Very nice place for walking around. A lot of nice restaurant and hotels and nice veiw.You can enjoy a lot in this place specially in the evenings.
Fun to walk around,"Fun to walk around and see the port. Many ships, excursions can be purchased there, great photos can be taken from there, gift shops with good prices, and transport travels right to there and the old town"
Historic old part of town,"Lots of picturesque narrow streets with some beautiful renovated buildings as well as buildings awaiting renovation.Lots of ways of entering this old town but obviously the one with the most impact is via Hadrians Gate.Full of bars, restaurants all leading down to the sea front"
Back in time,I would recommend Kaleiçi as a magical experience lots to see wonderful people it was our second visit but we found it even more wonderful than our first holiday.I recommend a visit to the museum down by the beach really interesting and shows how the area was and how people lived considering it’s free it’s really a wonderful.
Beautiful old town,Wander round the winding streets for restaurants bars and shops or head down to the park on the cliff tops for an amazing view
Wonderful but abit crowdy ,"I used to visit it 2 times in my stay I liked to swim as waving isn't night..best time for me early morning or late evening , staff  cool ,entry ticket  is fine ,and good view,service good,,but so many peoepl"
My favourite town! ,"We stayed in Boutique Hotel 1207 in Kaleici (Old town) and loved it! The old town has character, it is very lively and we enjoyed walking around as most of the popular areas are walking distance. Mermeli beach is also in old town so is the clock tower and the fun cafes like Luna Garden. I would recommend to stay in a small hotel (1207 is great) to stay in Kaleici area."
Anniversary Holiday,"Amazing anniversary holiday. Kaleici is the Old Town and it is full of character. I would definitely stay here again. Lovely beach in walking distance and restaurants, bars are too many to choose from but all worth a visit."
Wonderfully relaxing old town,"Wandering around the little streets of Kaleici is very relaxing. There are plenty of bars and restaurants in lovely courtyard settings, where you can sit in the shade surrounded by greenery."
Beautiful,This was a beautiful place to see and just relax. I would definitely come back to this place.Its not very crowed however very steep.
Excellent town,Visited this town recently and the views are amazing n and well worth visiting . Lots of shops and restaurants in the vicinity and you can also get boat trips from the marina.
Beautiful old town,"Kaleici is a really scenic part of Antalya city, only minutes away from the main shops and tramway stretch. The view from the top is breathtaking, view of the Mediterranean sea and the Taurus mountains in the distance. Must see when you are in Antalya city."
"Beautiful views, quite touristy","We love this old town with its charming alleyways. Views from the harbour across to the mountains are absolutely fantastic. Generally quite a touristy area with lots of bars and restaurants as well as stalls trying to sell things to tourists (spices, Turkish delight etc)"
Stunning,The place is beautiful. Peaceful and cozy. I went here and had a drink of çay at the upper deck to see the view of this place. Worth to visit.
Recommended beach,"To all the beach lovers, it's a good place for swimming, clean and very safe, you can find also food and beverage with affordable prices"
Beautiful,"Went here lunch on a tour, it is incredible - the views leave nothing to be desired.  Fabulous place."
Rest and unwind ,Arrived here after a hectic trip to Jordan and Jerusalem including Petra Have really enjoyed the excellent hospitality and welcome we have received
Beautiful city,"I would highly recommend for about a week only lovely area with loads to see, the harbour is awesome and there also a air conned loft to take you down to the Marina"
Beautiful cobbled old towb,"A beautiful old town with numerous side streets, lovely mosque and ancient buildings. There is also a lovely harbour where you can book many boat trips and grab a drink in one of the harbour restaurants.  There are lots and lots of shops and bizarres here, but be prepared to haggle with prices and be hassled. Definitely worth a visit ❤️"
Must experience ,Great section of town. This is the old section of the city. Good restaurants good views. The beach is good too
Very nice place,Initially planned to stay here for 3 days but extended my stay up to 5 days. Nice crystal clear waters.
Lovely place,"Really enjoyed walking round Kaleici ... so many little streets to explore.  Lovely walk down from Hadrian’s Gate to the seafront ..  the view with the mountains across the bay is amazing, they still had snow on in March but the weather in Antalya was glorious."
Beautifull Antalya,"One can feel the ancient history energy, while walking among the old houses along the “ sokaks”. Must take pictures below the Hadrian gate"
Nice Marina,The beautiful old city of Antalya facing a nice marina with amazing view of the sea and greenish mountains around...
One of the best spots,"Lovely old town, with all those small streets and restaurants, views from up are amazing, many things to do there and prepare your camera if you like taking pictures"
very nice,"they have shops in a walking street ,no cars and the old bazaar. very nice view and lots of restaurants"
Old town place,"Our hotel stay was in kaleici old town. Nice area only pedestrian, narrow streets with many hotels, pubs and restaurants overlooking the old marina and amazing sea view. Always crowded day and night. Many gift shops. Close to a big park and minarat place also Hadrian Gate (historic place)"
Quirky & Historic great for those who enjoy walks.,"Great area, full of character and great people. The port is well worth a visit at both day and during the evening. It could benefit from a sandy beach to finish the area off."
Check the Marina!,"Nice walks, lovely restaurants, close to the old marina harbor, historical hammam, lot of shops, good for day and night."
Untold stories,"Kaleici stole my heart! Its in the heart of history, so many hidden stories left unsaid. You can see it all by taking one look at the doors and the walls, they all tell stories.I spent most of my time chatting to local vendors, sipping on Turkish tea and hearing about their existence, the economy and the hidden gems in their home town. I met so many kind hearted people, its one of the happiest memories I have. A true treasure actually. Walk the streets, eat the food, talk to locals and live through their stories. This was the highlight of my trip, the people!"
Beautiful!,We stayed here for ten days in a lovely hotel (aspen) the old town is beautiful especially in the evening.  Lovely food and people.  Well worth a visit!
Fantastic and lovely ,"Nice ambience, delicious food, friendly people.. Old Town is really gorgeous and nice to live in it and enjoy its landmarks and old Antalya portside.. Beautiful antique small boutique houses.. Delicious Turkish recipes.. Generally awesome"
Always good at the marina,"Fun for a few hours in the marina, especially if you have a boat trip (there is an hour / two or 6 hours)recommended"
"Pretty little old town, should visit in the evening ","We followed the guidance provided by the culture trip blog. Visited the main square, old clock tower and then walked down from Hadrian gate through the street full of restaurants and through the old harbour and lift back to the main square.We ate at Meyhanet restaurant, the food and ambience was great, would have loved to try terrace restaurant and watch sunset."
Nice ,"It is very nice place. You can ask the locals for directions because they are very friendly, especially if you learn a few words in their language. You can see the old housese, a mosque, the marina. I spent there 4-5 hours."
Kaleici old town and marina,I find it hard with words and pictures just how gorgeous this place is. It has everything you could ever want in a town and is so picturesque with its great views and boutique hotels and restaurants. A great place to relax and eat and drink with plenty of places to choose from. We had to visit many times to explore and experience all areas but sure we still missed some.
You Must Experience a Boat Trip,"Relevant cheap and very good value for money. Do not accept the first or second process and by all means insist on paying in Turkish Lira.....Once that is all done, sit back and enjoy the beautiful  views that Antalya has to offer."
Beautiful Old Town,"We loved walking through the cobbled and winding streets of the Kaleici.  Some areas, near reastaurants are filled with music and entertainment, other avenues are quiet and relaxed.The streets are difficut and very narrow to navigate in a big car."
Nice,"Nice place to go shopping, but not as big as other cities like Side and Marmaris. The shopkeepers didnt want to hassle as much as in other cities. The bazaars are generally cheaper than the kaleici shops."
Amazing sunset on Mediterranean!,I do not remember how many photos I have taken of the Sunset. We stayed in a boutique hotel in Kaleci. We took 1h sailing in a private yacht. Ah...a great experience. That evening in Antalya was the best evening of my life so far. The restaurants are also good. Do forget to try fish in your dinner.
How CLEAN!!!,"We all have been to historic places that are beautiful and worthy of our attention and our learning the history of a place. But how many are CLEAN???  This place had no trash on the ground whatsoever. In fact, neither did the whole of our route to and from our hotel, airport, the old town and environs by taxi, shuttle and walking.  I went out of my way looking for fallen trash and found none.  I wish the whole Middle East were like this.  The only other place I saw so clean was Tehran, Iran.  How do they get their citizenry to take care???  If there is any trash around, I don't believe it would be its citizens, but the tourists, those who are used to throwing trash out of car windows and onto the roads without a care."
Heart of Antalya,"Kaleici is the heart of Antalya. We were there at 19.00 and from the begining we were all excited. Nice atmosphere. A great variety of bars, restaurants and shops. We had a child with us, he really enjoyed the place they shelter cats. A happy place specially at night when you can enjoy street music performances. The only things that let us down were the high prices for tourists. The icecream which is maximum 5 lira for locals they charged us 20 per person!!! Or at the restaurant they charged us more than the menu saying you ordered big dish although no one asked us about the  size.Rule number one in Antalya: Ask the price firstRule number two: Ask about the details. Size and stuff. Make sure you will get exactly what you want. Not more not less"

"Busy, loud but l love it","Get yourself ready for nice,long walk, good shooping and some nice place to eat. Old town have special spirit and its MUST  to visit."
Must visit!,"Had a wonderful afternoon and an equally wonderful evening in Kaleici, walking around the marina, and the cobbled streets, taking in the beautiful and eclectic sights and sounds. Best place for buying souvenirs and stopping for a drink and meal overlooking the marina."
Old town antalya,"The old town is well worth a visit, outstanding views, beautiful scenery, lovely places to eat and drink. Marina also lovely. Ice creams were amazing."
Lovely place ,Perfect place lovely food and ambiance with music and great location.Parking is little bit a problem but could be managed.You’ve to choose your food your self and don’t accept waiters recommendations and best choice is fresh fish with basic way of cooking like grilled of basic frying.Salads are lovely.
Great shopping.,"Definitely worth the visit! Lots of culture, food and souvenirs.  The view from the marina is epic and most certainly worth the walk. There are an array of things to do and a  budget to suit all. Try the seafood!"
Lovely town ,"Must see this lovely old town. I adore walking at this old town , you have everything there .The marina next by where you can sit and enjoy the lovely view ."
Lovely Evening Atmospher,"We stayed in the old town which a pedestrian only area other than for access. It’s beautiful  and has a great atmosphere in the evening with lots of friendly bars and restaurants to choose from - many offering live music. Lots of boutique hotels too. There are a couple of  beach clubs nearby but in August we found the main one so busy, with sun-beds rammed up against each other, that it was not a nice experience. In August the heat and humidity can be murderous; it took me several days to begin to acclimatise. If I came again I’d want a beachside hotel but would regularly visit the old town in the evening. It is a great place."
Lovely scenic place,"Loved Kaleici old town. We spent 8 days here, but to be honest, 5 days is more than enough. Last two days, we spent sitting at the park near the sea reading. Kaleici  is full of bazaars but all fakes, which i hated. I cant think of anything worse than seeing hundreds of identical stalls selling designer fakes. The fake bags were shabby and woe betide you if you said they were fakes to the stall owner. Mostly pleasant but you got the odd miserable idiot who wanted you to buy without even browsing. Overall, everything is very expensive. Everyone dealt in euros which made the whole holiday very costly. Liras were accepted but beware when asking prices as they say the first ridiculous high price that pops into their heads. Haggle and bargain or walk away. Dont let them rip you off. Kaleici has beautiful old ruins, stunning mosques, and a gorgeous marina. All within walking distance. There is even a huge five floor shopping mall called Markantalya Mall, nearby. Food generally is cheap, but all that seems to be available us donner kebabs. Theres only so much greasy donner i could bear. There is pizza available too but its a bit more pricey. There is Mcdonalds and Burger Kings and Starbucks there too.The cobbled streets to the marina were so stunning with overhanging pink flowers everywhere. Be careful when buying Zultenite jewellery as im not sure if it was genuine. Overall a lovely scenic part of Turkey"
Walk through the Old Town,We went walking through the old town and narrow streets. Very quiet and some good sea views. If you have time then please visit.
Old town,"Such a beautiful place with so much history. The views alone are breathtaking. It’s very easy to get tours to go to different places in Antalya. I did a few tours and really enjoyed myself. It’s a very relaxed place with little stalls and shops everywhere! If you want to do shopping for souvenirs I’d suggest going out of the old town towards the square where you will find the same things much cheaper. Locals are friendly and helpful. It’s extremely hot at summer time so make sure to bring sunscreen and a hat, because it’s a seaside town, pack you swimsuits, it’s a real treat to go for a swim now and again. I stayed at castle hotel, a beautiful hotel. Altogether, this place is a must to visit when in Antalya."
Good walk,Beautiful blue/green water and interesting pirate boast along the dock. Easy and pleasant to walk around with many historic buildings all around.
Must see,Must take time to walk around the narrow streets. Cool the shaded alleys. Shop keepers not too pushy. Tip..wear long trousers if you want to visit the mosque.  Lots of cafes bars and restaurants around the harbour. We found kaleici marina boutique hotel overlooking the harbour.  Beach looked over crowded.
Great historical area,Beautiful updated homes in the old town with great places to stop and have dinner. Overall a very pleasant walk to the harbour
Old town,"Great visite and Old bazar,vert safe . À lot of traditionnal restaurant and shops .typical architecture."
Old City Charm,"We stayed in this part of the Old City for 5 nights at Villa Tulipan. We really enjoyed the vibe and buzz of the city, with many restaurants and bars, plus the harbor and historic buildings, and shops. The streets are mainly walkways with a real mix of interesting old buildings, hotels and pubs. Only Taxi's and residents have special permission to drive the narrow streets. (a nightmare if you have a hire car)"
Very walkable and lots to see,"This is a very interesting old town - full of attractions (museums/mosques), shops, restaurants, and bars. The streets are maze-like but after the first day, things began to look familiar. It was all very walkable. We were surprised that they allow vehicles to drive in the narrow streets. Most of the restaurants/bars have bi-lingual menus (Turkish/English), and the waiters commonly spoke some English."
Nice medieval old town,"The Old Town in Antalya is great! Lots of fun bars, great restaurants and shops all set in a maze of medieval streets. There is a marina at the bottom of the town which hosts lots of restaurants and It is definitely an area worth visiting if you are in Anatalya."
Kaleici (Old town),Lovely vibey area to walk around and we felt so safe - still bustling at 11:30 pm. Fun to bargain a bit in the market and enjoyed a delicious supper at one of the little cafe's followed by desert of Lokma - all with a beautiful view.
Historic authentic plus you can shop there ,"Love this place I went to Antalya once before but it is now my first time to KaleiciThis place is a hidden gem Located on backside of mark antalya mall long street like Taksim at Istanbul with contemporary shops and department stores like LC Defacto Kotton and other turkish known brands many cafe on the road serving Kahve and turkish delights on the road worth to take rest at Then at the end of the street you will be surprised with the sight of an old castle and Hadrian gate that's where the old city would start: bazaar, old fashioned houses with orange bricks, suddenly while you walk down the hell you will be surprised by the glimpse of the see view from behind the houses, two old mosques one at the end of the bazaar it called Yivliminare Mosque it has this structure underneath it and covered with glass it supposed it was the first backbone to the mosque I took pic of it after that you can continue your walk to the see"
Walking ,"Luckily, we chose a hotel right in the middle of Old Town so every evening was spent wandering around. Shops, restaurants and mosques. Excellent atmosphere."
Buying stuff ,"I loved kaleici, we found so many nice stuff, my teenage girl bought couple of bags and jewellery and I bought some presents for my friends"
Authentic historic ,"Unfortunately I discovered this place on my trip's last day, combine shopping with sightseeing and historyPondering around the place from the back of  mark antalya mall and  down the road You will see multiple clothing food and accessory shops, department stores as kotton mango LC were there two at the beginning of the market you will fond the contemporary stores but afterward you will see the old town, turkish bazaar an old castle, two old mosques one of them is by the see, the hadrian gate is there too The view on the Mediterranean worth it to tolerate the hate  I  recommend to visit this place"
Love this place,Keleici old town in Antalya is a must if you are in the area. Lots of eat and drink places. Plenty bazaar type shops and small hotels. The marina is beautiful. We went on the 45 minute boat trip - centrally controlled so a standard price of 50 Turkish Lira. Longer trips available if you prefer. Really enjoyed it. Drinks/snacks and souvenir photos all available but they don't pester if you're not interested. Music played throughout - Turkish pop but local people on the boat were up dancing which added to the fun. No frills but a nice way to see the coast. Would recommend.
Old Town,"If you like to walk in the old places, so kaleici is the choice.Many restaurant, coffee, bazar, everything is there"
Love this place,"Spent an amazing week in the old town, loved every minute of it. Cheap bars restaurants where we had some great meals. It can be a bit hilly in places and not suitable if you have a car. Going back next year!"
"It’s okay, but just restaurants, bars, and small shops ","I went at midday and it was dead. Everything was open but no people around, which might be good for some people. Some of it looks pretty, but there’s not much to do apart from eat or drink and look in your regular tourist shops."
I left my heart at Kaleici ,"Great little old town, authentic feel,many great bars, restaurants and food places with live music. The Marina is beautiful. Many parks nearby to walk about and a great bazaar, as well as historical sights.However i mostly enjoyed walking in those cozy, little beautiful streets of Kaleici."
Relaxing walk surrounded by great views,"A relaxing walk while being surrounded by great views, old traditional buildings, cozy restaurants with very tasty food, souvenirs shops and friendly people. The whole way from Hadrian’s Gate to the old harbor district is a delight, with plenty spots where to stop for photos.A must see of Antalya, don’t miss it. Get ‘lost’ on the streets and enjoy every corner."
very nice and natural ,"The beautiful and historical streets of Turkey, which brings the eyes of each viewer, and at the end of the beautiful boat pier and the trans that enjoy their vision. In my opinion, those who travel to Antalya are sure to visit this point of the city."
Worthy excursion ,Worth a visit. Quaint little area with many great eating places. Wonderful views especially of the harbor.
Amazing view,Nice street .Rabbits there to take pictures.lots of place to eat and so near other attractions.coconut water fresh amazing.
The best part of Antalya,"We love Kaleici! All its authentic buildings, narrow streets, cafes and restaurants... It is such an original place to be! You can feel the real Antalya vibes there, scrolling down towards the marina and enjoying a cup op coffee in the morning or a nice glass of wine among the ancient ruins. You see several centruies' architecture and cultural heritage- a fantastic spot right in the heart of Antalya."
Lovely area,Extremely lovely area where you can pass few days with your loved ones.It has pubs restaurants beaches. Very authentic place and no much cars and no disturbance. Excellent for relaxing.
Good,"We walk around,  nice water fall, nice park,  and the beautiful deep blue sea.It's a nice place to visit."
A place must go,"Kalaeici (Old City), this is a place in Antalya must visit if you like historic places with modern restraunts.You can spend whole day there and time will just pass by like anything. Beach side restraunt have sun beds for 20 TL each and can enjoy sun and beer.There are ample of restraunts with pool side tables, which is amazing."
Delightful ,Thorough enjoyed wandering around this picturesque old town. People were very friendly and helpful. Hadrians Gate was definitely worth going to see. We found some lovely restaurants. However if you wanted more the busy city of Antalya was just a few minutes walk away.
Getting lost is great but get a map till you work the hotel and restaurants to your hotel,"We found it a lovely place to walk an so many nice restaurants to eat at also the views from the cliff top restaurant is stunning also try a trip in the glass lift from the harbour lots off old ottoman buildings as you walk round,even if you are not staying in the old town kaleici is a must visit,"
Definitely recommend to visit!,"Such a beautiful place, with so many lovely shops and restaurants. The area is so nice for a day out as there is many shops you can visit you can also go near the sea and catch a view of the mountains."
Trying to find the way in in our hire car was difficult.,"When we found our hotel (Monopy Mansions) we parked our car in the owner garden and spend 8 great days relaxing in this amazing village. We only when out in the car 3 times to see some of the historic sites. There are some excellent bars and superior restaurants in walking distance,"
Old city charm,"This place has so much charm, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. There’s a great vibe and so much to do, you will not get bored. If you stay here, everything is in walking distance. My favorite part of Turkey!"
Kaleici,"Old city is nice, many shops and restraunts. We spend around 2 hours and then went to the main shopping centre."
Wonders of Antalya,"Wonderful place. Stayed there for 7 days and everyday we used to discover a new path, a new street that leads to extraordinary traditional charming house. A must."
Just beautiful,This is our 2nd visit to the old town. It is just as peaceful and stunning as we remember. Soo much history within this town and lots of original features still remain with a little restoration. Friendly folk everywhere. Nice places to eat and drink and maybe a spot of shopping. All stray animals are fed and watered and offered shade spots to laze in. It really is like paradise.
Lovely area,The old town is a great place to visit at any time of year. Plenty of bars and eateries and some specialist shops.Lovely walk down to the harbour.
Good place!,"A nice old town. Clean and well maintained. Near to lot of restaurants and harbour. If you are looking for shopping, good restaurants, and a night life near the harbour in antalya i recommend you to stay here in old town kaleici."
Charming Old Town,"A taste of real Turkey with narrow streets, some chic bars, good food, locals promenading at night, small harbour + much of the old town wall intact. Also very good value. Large beer 10TL in one bar, others mainly 15-20. You do not think your in a big city at all."
A must visit when in Antalya,"A beautiful walk through the old city is a must when in Antalya... it’s a really pleasant walk with the availability of cafe’s, restaurants and shops. Some interesting and unusual places found as you walk along... really enjoyed my afternoon here"
Beautiful neighborhood,"The historical district of Antalya is beautiful with squares and housesAnd walking on that Annas returned to centuriesCafes, restaurants and boutiques There are many beautiful hotels in this areaUsually you arrive from Hadrian's Gate and after about an hour you walk in beautiful alleys and take pictures of skulls of recreational boats and glass elevators.It was a pleasure for meIf you go to Antalya, I recommend you visit this area."
At least once,"Old place that have varieties of shops and restaurants, also have a nice view on the sea. You can visit the Masjid (mosque) that have been built 700 year ago during the Saljoki sultan Alaa Deen Kekobat period. Of course on the same day you have to visit the marine part and take a boat trip (they have three types of trips). N.B. The weather as expected was very hot during June."
Nice place!,"The old city of Kaleici offers many pubs, cafes, and just areas to hangout with friends and family. You can visit Hadrian’s gate built in the 1st century. The old town is very unique as you feel like you have back in time. There are many souvenirs shops, but you must bargain. It’s good to know your numbers in Turkish before you go. This is definitely worth your time to visit."
Awesome authentic Turkish old town,"Fabulous little shops selling amazing Turkish tea, picturesque restaurants, Efes draught beer, cobbled roads , can’t think of a prettier place for a chilled and fun night out in Antalya with friends!"
Very quaint & laidback ,"We have just spent three weeks in Kaleiçi and the time flew !  Morning walks after breakfast round the area and as it’s beside the City there’s plenty to see.  Travelled on the tram and very reasonably priced taxis to different parts.  Afternoons spent on the little beach by the marina, fantastic views of the mountains opposite, then a few beers in a lovely bar with knitting round the indoor trees !  I’ll let you find it !  Love Kaleiçi and the people, no hassle and very laidback."
Kaleici ,Like stepping back in time the harbour area is a must see experience for anyone visiting Antalya or nearby
A Must-Visit,"Though it is not a very long route and walk to pass Kaleici (old city), but you can find beautiful corners in this site which are really worth visiting. When you're above the harbor, the landscape is very nice and you can take great photos."
Brilliant weekend away,"Kaleici, or old town in Antalya is always well worth a visit. This was my third time in Antalya and Kaleici was again the highlight of my trip.It’s a very deceptive place; you wander the narrow streets lined with bars, restaurants and shops and it all seems very small, but pop into a restaurant and you will find that often they are huge with big courtyards in which you can enjoy quality food in the sun or shade. The people are friendly and helpful in giving directions, the place is like a rabbit warren and easy to lose your sense of direction. Restaurants I would recommend are Vanilla, Gazetta and of course Sereser of which I have reviewed before.Do go if you get the chance, you’ll have a great time."
Always worth a visit. ,"We have been travelling to Antalya every year for the past 20 years and a place that has changed a lot is Kaleici.Take an evening stroll in the old Town, have a glass of wine, a beer or a cup of Turkish tea in one of the many bars, cafes of restaurants in this vibrant part of the city.A lot of the houses have gone through very nice renovations and this part looks better for every year we visit the city"
Beautiful town ,"Loved Kaleici, such a pretty place. Harbour side is so beautiful, boat trips available for long or short trips. Lots to see and do within walking distance, but also public transport is good. Taxis are reasonable for trips further afield. Duden waterfalls, a must. Shopping is fantastic, shoes, clothes etc.. we had lots of pampering with hair cuts/wash and blow drys/ colouring/nails etc.. very reasonable. Plenty of bars and restaurants with good cheap food. People are very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely go again."
Great place!!!!!!,"It’s nice place good, nice historic place but try avoid buying stuff from there, you get better price on the market across from Kaleiçi, other then that great place!!!!"
Nice area,Great historical area with narrow streets and several shops and restaurants. It is safe. You can park your car at Mark Antalya mall and walk in commercial street toward old town.
Cheap holiday,"Kalechi has a bit of everything, the market place is buzzing all day, and if you can’t buy it here you won’t get it anywhere. Cheap restaurants if you want and pricey ones too.  Small beach, which is really rows and rows of sun beds no sand as such.  Lots of side streets with quaint restaurants. Not really suitable for wheelchair users, some of the streets are steep. Taxi/bus/or tram ride to Lara beach. Short taxi ride from the airport £10 or 15 euros. Lots of boutique hotels and lots of bed and breakfast hotels."
Cute historical city,"When I come to Antalya, I always love to stay this old city. There are many cute boutique hotels, cafe, restaurants and gift shops.Ocean is walking distance. It is very fun to take a walk in this area. I get lost sometimes and find something new."
Delightful stroll in the old town ,We spent around three hours walking around the old town. Antalya was one of the few places we had not visited in Turkey and we had always wanted to do so. We chose this part of Antalya from reviews in tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. The quaint streets and the renovation works to the historical area was more than just interesting. We came across many guided tours during our time here and this may be the way to go to appreciate the full history. We had lunch at the Edinburgh which is subject to a separate  review (excellent). A fabulous view of the harbour area can be found at the top of the old town that adjoins a large park area. Many shops and restaurants in the area that come alive at night. Rob and Jan
Wonderful ..,"it was very wonderful trip to antalya .& one of Top attraction was Kaleici City which was centrally located in antalya ..full of cafes ,restaurants ,shops on every next feet.Highly recommend to choose Hotel in Kaleici City or City Centre to enjoy Nightlife"
Full of surprises,Fantastic to walk about both during the day and on an evening. Felt very safe. Loads to see and explore. Lovely bars and restaurants to choose from. Historic sites around every corner.
Beautiful,"This part of Antalya is a must see it’s so beautiful. There are some amazing restaurants and bars in this area with views of the ocean. Hadrians Gate , clock tower, marina  are all worth a look. The shops are full of tourist souvenirs, carpets with numerous counterfeit clothing and handbag stores. There are also numerous guys in this area who hit on women for sex and once you’ve been sucked in try and extort money from you so if you’re female be careful. This happened to a close friend who is very intelligent and I would have thought she would be wiser but as they say love is blind."
Lovely fish restaurant with views across the harbour. Very clean and very friendly staff,Iskele fish and steak restaurant lovely harbour side position overlooking all the small boats and pleasure boats
Must see piece of history,Beautiful place place to walk and see. Plenty of good bars restaurants and lounges with live music. Must see place in Antalya
A favourite place,"We are fortunate enough to have travelled worldwide for fifty years. Antalya old town is up there with our favourite places. Perfect for a long weekend, city break, honeymoon, lots of small pensions and boutique hotels for all price ranges. Same for the many assorted restaurants. Great atmosphere, stunning scenery, Roman ruins. Easy reach of transportation to the airport via metro. Other destinations by bus. Don’t hesitate."
Charming & Historical Town!,"Kaleiçi is one of the popular centers in Antalya. Visiting Kaleiçi is at the top of the do things lists in Antalya. Well-restored, filled with arts, good restaurants and quiet peaceful areas. Also, tram is only 5 minutes away from here. You will love this place!"
Nice old town but very steep down and uphill.,"Nice walk in the old town of Antalya, it is a must for anyone visiting Antlaya. It does not have anything special, only regular market with regular stores and people trying to sell you stuff. The end of the old town at the bottom you reach the marina. A very nice view with the ships and some restaurants nearby, yet very expensive. Regular market, must visit if you have the time."
Bargain hunting ,"A great place to eat, drink and shop but don’t forget to haggle.There are plenty of shops and bazaars to spend your cash, everything is priced in Euro so watch out for the conversion rate used."
Interesting,"Venture beyond Hadrian's Gate and you will find the busy shopping streets which lack the charm of Kaleici but still offer amazing bargains. Many tours are available if you wish to explore further afield - but for a relaxing, stress free week's break ,Kaleici could be just what you are looking for."
Cozy comfortable place ,So clam and amazingly rythemed place... not so many ppl heard about it but you should come for at least one drink
Visiting,"Lovely little walks around here, plenty to see and lots of restaurants and cafes to choose from. Food is cheap but very tasty. Lots to see, awesome views too. If you’re tired from the walk down to the marina, there is an elevator which takes you back up to the top, which is free to use."
Amazing,"Really beautiful old town! Lovely views, nice shops and nice sellers. Definitely worth a visit and walk through!"
An interesting experience ,"You can’t go to Antalya without visiting Kaleici and the Marina. The place is full of shops, where you can find, souvenirs, clothes, spices , unique teas and many other things. The vendors are all very nice, when u enter their shop , straight away they offer you water, Turkish tea or coffee. Bargain for the price. There are different historical sights around. It’s a pleasure to stroll in the small streets of Kaleici. The view from the top over the marina is very nice. I had a wonderful time."
Beautifuk,Worth a visit for a walk and look around and a little bit of shopping for souvenirs. Not too far from Lara beach strip via bus to taxi. Why not visit
Beautiful harbor ,This old town was very beautiful It had amazing landscape and nice cafes for drinks and sheesha. We had amazing time
Well worth a visit!,"Visited Kaleici as part of a city tour of Antalya. Absolutely stunning old town, which snakes down to the harbour. Full of character buildings, steeped in history."
Interesting,"Liked the labyrinth of shops, restaurants  bars and sights.  Most shops sold designer copies but you can bag a bargin on tour prices in the streets and jewellery."
Wonderful ,"I had a layover in Antalya and after some thought, I’ve decided to spend it in Kaleiçi. The old town didn’t fail to disappoint! We ended up walking around the marine area, shopped around and took some great photos. There is countless cafes and restaurants to wind down and relax."
Tourist heaven vs tourist trap,"Kaleici is a delight... a maze of tiny streets with every turn offering another snapshot worthy of Instagram... beautiful old architecture, creepers and vines, pretty flower baskets together with over-priced themed restaurants and over-priced tourist tat, amidst an ever-present pong of dirty drains. However, Kaleici delivers its charm in bucket loads, just do your tourist shopping on Ataturk Caddesi where the prices will be much more reasonable."
Staying in Old town,Beautiful and euthantic. Fantastic nightlife. Great food. Gives you a feel of how it used to be like back in the day
Beautiful & Cozy Oldtown. Recommended!,"It's nice place ant totally different from Antalya region. When you get from turistic places where everybody wants you to sell you everything from ""turkish delight"" to fake Balenciaga sneakers. When you pass the Hardian's gate it's like you travel to small city of which feels like you came to Italy or Greece.It's nice, cozy and everybody is friendly. You can find here any type of cafes or restaurants. From Hipster style cafe to fine dining restarants. Most of the shops are of handcrafts. The views and palces are beautiful.We were staying in All Inclusive hotel (in Lara) 20km away from old town. We came here by public bus and back with taxi, the price was 15€ one way.But I would recommend to everyone to visit this beautiful place."
A must to visit,There is only one word to describe this place - CRAZY (in a very good way). The harbour is beautiful and market & shops are so vibrant. You will need the whole day if you want to enjoy Kaleici. Will visit again when I go back to Antalya
Lovely old town ,"What a place buzzing with activities. We spent a whole day shopping in kaleici with many restaurants, cafes, pubs. There are many boutique hotels here and the location is perfect to explore the old town and the marina nearby."
You should visit this place when you travel to Antalya,"I used to think that Antalya is a new city which has no long history. After visiting Kaleici, I totally changed my mind. Antakya is a historic city which has so many stories from the past centuries. This place is very clean and nice. You can walk through the narrow streets and make many photos. Also there are so many cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops you can enjoy. It ends to the beautiful scenery of Mediterranean sea.Don't miss it!"
Great to explore and find all the hidden gems,"Allow a good 2 or 3 hours minimum to do this ancient city and harbour justice with your visit. Explore the narrow streets with their bustling shops, bar and restaurants and don’t be afraid to venture through the many wooden doorways that lead into inviting courtyard businesses. Take in some refreshments at one of the many harbour hostelries - a great area to watch the sun set."
Beautiful area to stay or dine,There are so many small but clean boutique hotels in the area. There are so many good restaurants around. Definitely must go and walk around and dine.
The area to live in Antalya,"Super buzzing streets, it’s by the shore so beautiful view. You can just grab a drink and sandwich, and make a small picnic there. All the shopping, the best restaurants on tripadvisor, bars, cafes...everything is there. We lived in one of the all inclusive hotels 20mins away but if you can find a good boutique hotel in that area then must definitely be there."
The best place to stay in Antalya ,We stayed in Kaleci which meant everything was walking distance for us. Thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are visiting Antalya I would say stay in Kaleci.
Charming old town,"I was positively surprised by the old town in Antalya. Buildings nicely renovated and not so many tourists, if you go before the season. It is a nice place to stay."
Romantic & lively,"A must stay place in a hotel like Aspen. Fantastic location with reasonable tasty food and shops , lively bars available and so near the marina. Just perfect !!"
Beautiful ,This historic place is very beautiful. Having a walk in Kaleici is like walking through history. Then we would always end up by the sea.
Another world.,"When we walked through Hadrian's Gate, we were transported into another world. Wandering through the narrow streets was like being taken back in time, everything so relaxed and charming. We visited a lot during our time in Antalya."
very nice place,"very nice place.. cafe, bar and restaurants.. shops..👍🏼👍🏼 evening walks are just amazing.. amazing views.. highly recommended !!!"
Beautiful ,"Aaah I could roam around here all day and still not be bored. Lots of interesting parts to the old town to see, quaint streets and an array of shops to browse in."
Charming,"A charming old town, lots of quaint narrow streets, it does have access via a lift as is quiet an uphill walk back to the new town.. A quaint little harbor to with cafe's.."
Quirky ,"Kaleiçi was pretty cool, Hadrian’s gate was photo worthy and the narrow streets past the gate was beautiful. There was a bazaar nearby and the marina wasn’t too far either. Good place for exploring and shopping. Only downer is that there’s a one way bus service."
Great place to party,This was built around 150 AD and is like a fort which now houses various Hotels and night clubs and a market place. It's part of the old town of Antalya. This place is a must visit if you are in Antalya. You could also stay in one of the hotels located within the fort
"Old city,  Kaleiçi","Amazing place on the evening you have too much restaurants and bars where you can take a drink or eat something.  Old harbor is nice and boattrip fameus,...  Take your time!!!"
FABULOUS ,"We went from Lara Beach area by return taxi, amazing service. Kaleici itself is lovely, I could have spent the whole day just wandering. We stopped for coffee where bought some tea & menthol crystals, it was brought to your table to try then encouraged to purchase😉We unfortunately stopped for lunch at a ‘bad apple’ BE AWARE there was 4 in our party we ordered 3 juices & 1 beer,  then we chose 4 doner meat plates, 1 salad & chips to share, our Bill was 515 TL..... we queried the bill as their was nothing on the menu higher than 30TL, unfortunately we were told this was the price! The guy who encouraged us in ( just had a hair transplant) was obviously well out the way when we were leaving, left a sour taste in my mouth for sure! Can’t remember the name of the restaurant, it was on a corner precinct area, just along a little & opposite their is a cat sanctuary place where their is lots cat box’s and the man who runs the sanctuary has a big dog, he has a stall where he sells items to help with the upkeep."
A week away,"First time in antalya and happened to pick kaleici without knowing too much about the place. What a Jem of a place this place is, very old and very historical. Lots of beutice hotels with picturesque narrow streets. Very romantic, wish I came with my wife and not on my own. Hotels or b&bs are very cheap this time of year in March so it's a bargain."
Beautiful place worth a visit,"This place and the whole area around is beautiful and the architecture is second to none. Its worth visiting and admire the beautiful Bazaar, shops etc"
Historic old town,"A must for anyone visiting Antalya as it gives a real feel for Turkish lifestyle. Hundreds are cake and coffee shops, clothing shops including wedding dress shops. Easy to use bus service. Lovely harbour to visit and beautiful views"
Well worth a look,"Beautiful place, glass lift down to the marina if the walk is too much , we did it the wrong way round, went down in the lift and walked back up !!"
"Beautiful area, beautiful buildings.",This very quaint and pretty area is best visited early in the day before it gets too crowded if you want a chance to view the buildings.  Stunning location with a small free museum that is well worth visiting.  I personally didn't enjoy the shops as I felt most of them carried mass market items designed for tourists. Still it is very worth a visit.
Very Interesting Old Town,"Was fun finding your way around the ever winding narrow streets.  We had a hire car, which had been hired from the owner of the Bacchus hotel, and first of all trying to find our way in and out ( one way system) was quite hairy at first.  It became quite a fun ride."
Nice old town,"Nice old buildings, great harbour views and mountain scenery. annoying street vendors. nice shops. Regular public transport."
Interesting,Walk around!Fill the old streets!Think that you are in a place that the life runs for more than 2000 years is unique!
Definitely a must-see in Antalya,"The Old town of Antalya. If you have one place in Antalya to visit, this should be your first choice. There are some historical buildings, mosques and if you go far enough, you will reach the marina. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants, plus a lot of handcraft shops, carpenters etc. Definitely wirtg visiting for several hours."
Nicely restored town with great old architecture.,"I visited Antalya in August (to hot for me) and again October (nice weather) and stayed in the Town, rather than the resort. Kaleici is a very nice place to visit and stroll around. Also offering some shade from the sunshine by trees and surrounding buildings. The are plenty of lodging options including dorms, b&b and boutique Hotels. I found it relatively quiet in the daytime, but in the evening busy with plenty of bars, a few clubs and plenty of places to eat. It is quite tidy with most of the buildings restored, and some in need of TLC. There is a nice place overlooking the harbour offering Chai, Coffee, snacks and ice cream during the day, and restaurant by night. Where Kaleici meets main shopping area of Antalya there is the traditional tram system that goes through Antalya, along the coast to the beach resort area and Antalya Museum. Certainly if visiting Antalya it is well worth the visit."
Old but gold,"This is historical place surrounded by old houses and walls. Mostly you can see pubs, restaurants, clubs and meyhane (turkish style bar with live turkish traditional music). For this place was one of the most interesting places especially in summer at sight times. You can find almost all social youth there. This place has it is own, special, zest. There is restaurant near the port which is 15-20 metres high from the sea level with very nice view. I would highly recommend to everybody visit Kaleici for adding flower in your vocation. Enjoy 😉😊"
Antalya old town ,Beautiful city good transport networks Elevator down to harbour for those with walking difficulties or in wheelchair
Beautiful,Very beautiful location tui hang out.  In day or night.  Though it is busier at night. Many good places to dine and have delicious meals
group (1 day ) visit,"The 'OLD TOWN' as it's also known as - lots of History and plenty of Souvenir shops and Cafe's /Restaurants. Not recommended for people with walking difficulties a it is all downhill to the Harbour, where various Boat trips are available, the most popular being to the Lower Duden Falls (haggle for best price). To see the best of the Duden Falls it is best to go to the UPPER DUDEN FALLS north of Antalya via a Trip from your Hotel.  Whilst at OLD TOWN don't miss walking along the Main Road to see 'HADRIANS GATE' for more Photo opportunities. Very busy during Main season and weekends."
The magic of ancient Antalya,"A view over the beautiful bay of Antalya, stunning restaurants, blue seas and vibrant activity.  Visiting Antalya equals a visit to the old city! But be careful - my experience is that everything is twice the price there...!"
"Culture, history, good food, clubs, teraces.","At least one day for visiting this place. Very nice, peaceful, good atmosphere, tasty food and nice ambiance."
Old City Antalya,Its the Old City of Antalya with a lot of historical importance. It has a clock tower and a port. There are fixed price shops and flea market where you get a lot of handicrafts. Must visit for exploring the place and shopping.
Review,Historic city centre.  All tourists have to visit this must see place in Antalya.  Its quaint locations is very easy to find. Very nice shop's and you can buy good quality materials for good bargain.  Most of shops have fixed rates but you can bargain in some
Good for Walking and shopping ,"Good clubs, restaurant, history, city access.Not advisable if your on a wheelchair.Good place to spend for lunch and dinner with good views. Must visit if in the city"
Beautiful Old Town,"Filled with shops, cafes & restaurants and boutique hotels, Antalya's Old Town is a 'must visit' place. You can easily spend a whole day walking around or just chill by the historic harbor."
old town and marina,"old town and marina well worth a visit, the park at the eastern side of the old town has amazing views of the bay of antalya"
Okayish,"Kaleici is a fine place, there are resturants and bars there in the streets but the place is more attractive in pictures compared to the original"
Restaurant,If you find yourself in the middle of the old town in Antalya you really must visit the  Vanilla Restaurant.  5 star food.  Well worth a visit really nice for a special occasion.
very interesting can spend a whole day just wandering,our hotel Tuvana was right in the heart of the old town with plenty around old harbour makets etc .along old streets there is something for eveyone from great places to eat tradional turkish meals to just sitting in many coffee shops and enjoying watching the world go round.There you can buy all hand made goods and carpets ect
Tranquil Mediterranean,"Mediterranean version of Brighton's ""the laines"" on a larger sunny more exotic stage setting atmosphere!Perfect strolling environ descending to the simmering crisp riviera marina."
A lovely old place,Really easy to get to. Plenty of cheap places to eat and buy gifts. It's a nice old place to walk around and enjoy.
Outstanding,"Wonderful, charming, historical, warm and very very friendly. Looking forward to returning next year"
Busy and very local - loved it,It was a very good street with some great shops - we went there in December so there were mostly local - Antalya is generally cheaper than Istanbul so you can get some great deals here.
old city near harbour,"Old Houses but some of them restored, old architect, old town and old town castle wall, Hadrian Gate; All of them in the old city. You will find other historical places."
An enjoyable outdoor activity ,"If you are visiting Antalya (especially in autumn or winter) this activity is a must. We enjoyed the walk around, with many hidden gems, local cafes, cats and beautiful architecture."
What a great place ,Such good place very historical place definitly if you are in antalya you must go to kaleici  😘😘😍😍
Charming,"Walking amidst the cobbled ,narrow roads gives you a glimpse into the past.Quaint shops,traditional ware and restaurants add to the overall ambience.Beautiful and charming Old Town experience. We went for a ferry ride but this is an anti climax after traversing the mighty Bosphorus.Good seafood available at the marina,but beware of automatic 10 % surcharge as well as salads brought to the table,without ordering,but later being added to your tab!"
Nice old town,The Old Town of Antalya is definitely worth visiting.Nice small old streets with lots of little shops and quirky restaurants and cafe's.
Lovely area ,"Visited the old town on a day trip from Lara beach resort, 75 lira in a taxi . This place is gorgeous,  lovely old town with harbour and nice eating places overlooking harbour.  Long walk down to harbour but if u walk along there is a lift that will take u up and down   also taxis for a few lira.  Well worth a visit"
Walk around,"Many good stops around the city, it feels a little bit fake since it’s so tidy and perfect but maybe it’s just the tourism money, downtown is small and easily doable in 2 hours."
Beautiful old town,"If you're in for an adventure Kaleici is a must visit when in Antalya. For foregners barganing for a price in the carsi will be very interesting. Colourful alleys, few museums the tower clock, the port is very interesting to see. If you can you can take a ride by the coastline with a boat, I would recommend to go visit Duden waterfalls by sea."
Mesmerizing old city,"I'm fortunate to be able to spend 4 nights in this part of Antalya. It's a lovely old town with much to see and admire, must have been hundreds of years as seen by some of the ruins and the stone houses. Most of the dwellings has been turned into a boutique hotel or a small family run restaurant. Though life starts late and it gets pretty lively at night. A good blend of tourist from all over the world. Many restaurant serves good food and most of them are friendly and smily, though you get some bad apples. I find that most of the restaurant serves good food and affordable. Pilav rice with chicken, add some pickles, tastes is so good and it cost only 7tl. Average cost of a dish arounf 20tl. Fruits juices stalls at every corner and freshly pressed pomegranate at 8tl and orange juice at 5tl.Taxis are easily available too.Must spend some time here if you are not staying at Kaleici. An old town you can't miss."
Cosy Old Town,Very clean streets and excellent turkish food available.  Plenty of shopping to be done here too. You can walk around the old town and visit the numerous bars and restaurants along the way...
Lovely old town,"It is a lovely old town in the city , lanes ,by lanes all are beautiful. It is a must do in Antalya. The streets of town are beautiful and I loved to get lost in streets. All houses are converted into guest houses and cafe s . Small shops and cafeterias were good."
Beautiful Streets,Its an amazing old town with beautiful narrow streets and lined with numerous shops and restaurants. You can keep walking for hours and still don't get tired. This place comes to life at night with all musicians performing live on streets and restaurants.
Great place to stroll,"If you visit antalya this is a must do. It's an older part of the city with a great vibe. Lots of cute shops, picturesque alleys, and great food and drink stops."
Good coffe 👌🏻,"Kaleici is the old town of Antalya , where you can admire the mixture of roman and ottoman architecture. I suggest you to go there at night."
Antalya Cultural Spot,"The narrow road, old buildings, pavement walkway, glooming flowers in locals garden, are what make this place really beautiful. Many shops, restaurants (mostly seafood and western menu), and local travel agencies here. What makes this place really beautiful is the seaport at the very south of Kaleici."
Walk back in time ,I love Kaleiçi fantastic shops lovely people and had a lovely meal in the harbour front well worth a vist
Nice place,We hadn't time to walk there enouth because of heavy rain. But at least 40 minutes we were walking and enjoing.
Nice walk,"Very clean and friendly place, nice restaurants. If you stay close, worth to visit for a few hours walk."
Worth to walk for hours,"Old town has lots of hidden gems around the streets. Just start walking-i would prefer afternoon or dinner times as earliest- and you will find great restaurants, surprising views and small shops."
Beautiful,"This place is beautiful and makes some great pictures, however, do take some caution when it is raining as it can become very slippery. You will see many stray dogs and cats throughout the town usually lying in doorways so do be careful however they won't usually come near you."
Pretty area with great bars & restaurants,Great place to spend a day/night if you’re in Antalya.  Lots of good restaurants and places to stop for coffee or cocktails.  Very pretty winding streets which wind down towards the harbour and a spectacular view of the sea and the Taurus mountains on the horizon.
Colorful place! ,"One day walk saw so many amazing places: cozy and stylish cafes, oriental music, beautiful streets, and of course the old harbor is pleasing to the eye. I would like to come here again."
"Charming old town to Marina, albeit a bit too touristic!","Nice stroll among old alley ways and restaurants and shops in the old town of  Antalya, if you have an hour to spare, apart from shopping!  Just walk through the Hadian’s gate! Also a cup of freshly pressed promanegranate costs only 3 Turkish Lyra from the street vender, dirt cheap!"
Another world,"We took a visit to the old town from Lara beach. As you walk through Hadrian’s gate it’s like stepping into another world.It’s full of old buildings, nice little souvenir shops. We walked down to the harbour and found a lovely restaurant where you can sit and eat on the cliff edge with amazing views down to the harbour and out to sea.The old town was so beautiful we actually went back twice during a weeks stay.Definitely worth a trip."
Wonderful Experience,"Forget all expectations This part of Turkey is full of wonderful sights, smells, tastes and most of all people. If you want 5 star hotels and long white beaches go south of Kaleici. If you want to be enchanted at every turn go to Kaleici....I truly love this place and will be back."
Nice walk in old Antalya,"Get lost during a nice walk among the narrow streets in old Antalya. In every corner you will find a remain of the ancient city, old Roman walls acting being part of current houses."
In One Word- Amazing,"A historic neighbourhood by the sea that is the place to be. You’ll find little reason to go elsewhere.Shopping, eating, drinking, live music, stalls, cafes, shops, you name it... they got it.Make sure to compare prices. While most will stick to the same price tag for each item, some do try to be opportunistic. You can walk away from those and haggle the prices with others for the fun of it. Haggling here is less likely to take you lower on price but it’s fun to see how the sellers react to an exaggerated low price :-)Would do it again."
Old city not so much,My wife and I had visited here for one day its hard to see the old parts as they were not many signs to show the way we got to Hadrians gate and the marina but that's about it loads of shops and cafés good amount of transport public and private. If you like a good walk about this is OK.
Kaleici,"Wonderful narrow streets to wonder through.  Hadrian's gate, bistros, cafes, jazz bars... photographer's delight!"
Well worth a visit!,"Well worth a visit.   We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here, and it was very interesting walking through the old cobbled streets, visiting the harbour, going up the viewing platform in the lift, and  haggling in the shops for a bargain!"
Day trip from Side ,"Hotel information we need take local small bus / taxi to Manavgat ,than Manavgat bus to Antalya every 15mins ( 1.5hrs journey ) ,arrive outside the town take taxi to old town / centre! Wow ! Big mission . Finally we found a local travel agent ,asking price €20 ( final paid €30 for two ) .Hotel pick up around 9am , drop off at Antalya centra with map FIVE hours free time . Pick up than to a park to see a small waterfall ( 7tl /€2 )extra . More easy way safe times n money . The Keleici old town really not much interesting like other east Europe country . Walking around spendvyour free times ,fresh fruits drink ” shopping “ ... than few spot for photo .  Don’t expect too many you can get ,just relax ."
Family day out. ,This is one side of Anatalya’s old town. Very good see view of the the weather is right. Not much activities for young children’s and teenagers
Different and amusing ,Kaleici is the old center of antlya. The architecture is really different and special. The roads are clean and green. There is a harbour also in the old town and a lot of restaurants and pubs.I really recommend u stay in kaleici or at least spend some time walkig the hidden gems. Love it!!
relaxing wolking,"this place is full of small streets folowing them you can find yourself in different places each time. shops, restourants and travel agencies are everywhere. easy place to find some original suvenier."
"Old town, ancient architecture, marina and lots of restaurants!","Nice walks and sights to see. Plenary of places to sit, enjoy a drink and see the world go by. Easy to get to by public transport."
Ancient City Treat,"Wonderful historic city full of vibrant activity both day and night. Wander through the myriad small streets and alleyways full of restaurants bars and shops. This is a fully functional working city not just for tourists, so you gain a real insight in to local life and culture. Allow at least 1 full day to fully appreciate this remarkable place and to absorb the sights, smells and sounds of a truly remarkable Turkish gem. If you're wondering where to eat amongst all the fabulous restaurants I'd highly recommend Vanilla. If you're looking for Jewellery then I'd recommend Excalibur and if you're looking for a place to stay then Delight Deluxe Boutique Hotel is perfect for a short stay."
Narrow historical ,Many many shops narrow street life goes on and on and on never stop during the night so colourful and nice live music so much think to do we really love to go there again
Nice for a wander round,We visited here during the day and it is a pleasant old town to wander round. We saw Hadrian's gate but the other sights of interest in the old town we couldn't find using the directions and one of the minarets was covered in scaffolding. We rode past on the bus one evening and it looked lovely lit up and had lots of restaurants so may be that's a better time to visit.
Old Town tourist attraction,"The old town of Antalya, the Kaleici, is well worth a visit. Just ambling your way from Hadrians gate to the Marina is a relaxing way to spend some time. It s down hill to the water front and then there is a elevator to return to the upper level. If you have the time a cruise on a Gulet ,which range from 1 to 6 hours is interesting and enjoyable."
"Nice, for about two days.","The old town is lovely in terms of views and things to see. Very historic in nature. Wear comfortable shoes as its very rocky and you will constantly be going up and down steep roads, extremely tiring after a while. It took me about two days to explore the whole old town but a day is enough to get get a feel and experience what it's all about.Plenty of places to eat and dine. There are loads of market stalls going down tot he marina and bazaars around the area. be sure to haggle as the prices they throw at you are ridiculous I paid 20 Lira for two bracelets, walked down the road to a proper shop and they were priced at 3 lira for one or 4 for 10.  There are loads of fake clothes and bags, they are not real, even if the shop keeper guarantees the authenticity. if you would still like to buy some I would advice going out of the city centre into more loca bazaars where they are a lot cheaper! I bought a little designer coin purse for 5 lira, though it took extreme negotiation skills. Dont be afraid to walk away as they often call you back at the price you want. You can walk down to the marina which is nice. You can pay around 90lira or 10 euros or so to go on a little boat trip. Nice trip, though you dont really see the caves or anything close up, thats what the excursions are for.They have quite alot of bars there too. The people are really friendly and service is good."
Fantastic,"Part of old town with harbour and city walls, historic buildings cobbled streets a must if visiting area harbou or adjoining beach could be good for snorkelling"
Happy visit ,"It's an excellent place to visit. It contains very old and beautiful buildings,some beautiful bazaar,s for shopping and a little downstairs you can enjoy traveling on boats."
Superb excerience,"During our stay in Antalya, we decided to take a break from hotel and to visit popular neighbourhood - Kaleici. And we didn’t regret it. It has preserved its old, authentic look. Walking through small ,,kaldrma” streets is unique experience. Streets are full of cafes and places to buy clothes and souvenires. Definitely a must in Antalya"
Old Town,Very nice beautiful old buildings around there.You can find plenty of bazar and markets for the tourists people.It has a pathway what takes you down to the harbour where you can have amazing food and go for boat ride.
