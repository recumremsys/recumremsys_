Imambara,"Imambara is a very beautiful page in the history of Lucknow, in which artists have presented their artistry in a very beautiful way."
स्वच्छ भारत अभियान,Wonderful view Amazing amazing example of architecture bhul bhulaiya is really fabulous you can enjoy the sunset over there on the rooftop. Garden is also beautifulBut only thing you need to keep that in mind you will be allowed only to go up without shoes or slippersAttaching my some of Fabulous click
Impressive architecture,"The Bara Imambara is an impressive building.  Even more so as it was built to create work for about 20,000 people during the great famine in the late 1700's'.  An imambara is a tomb for a Muslim holy man.  Although we did not see visitors being given scarves or similar clothes you should dress appropriately for this religious site. Inside the entrance gate is a large formal garden leading to the main building.  The gardens are attractive and well maintained.  The architecture of the main building is beautiful.  There are three storeys that house many grand rooms but we did not go inside..There is a step well that we did not go to as we had previously visited Abhaneri (the home of one of the steepest step wells in India).  To the right of the main building is the Asifi Masjid where only Muslims are allowed.Our visit was part of a city highlights tour with our guide.  It is a fascinating building and well worth taking the time to visit."
"MY VISIT TO BADA IMAMBARA (ASAFI IMAMBARA), LUCKNOW","Lucknow was ruled by AwadhNawabs for nearly sixteen decades. Here we still find the glorious tradition and heritage of Nawabs in the form of great mansions, palaces, mosques and gardens. BadaImambara is the star attraction and most popular historic monument in Lucknow. Every day nearly three thousand people visit this beautiful mansion with spacious courtyards, carvings and massive arches. The word Imambara means the residence of Imam or a Muslim priest who leads prayers in a mosque. So it is a prayer hall where religious congregations are held through the month of Muharram and on other important occasions by Shia Muslims. In cities like Cairo, Aleppo and Baghdad this type of prayer hall is seen as an annexe to the main Mosque.  In 1722 the Mughal emperor Muhummad Shah made Mohd. Amin Masawi or Sadat Ali Khan I as Governor of Awadh. Sadat was the grandson of a rich trader from Khorasan in Iran who migrated to India. Thus the rule of AwadhNawabs (a native Governor appointed by Mughal emperors) began. In 1775 the fourth NawabAsaf-ud-Daula ascended the throne. He shifted the capital from Faizabad to Lucknow. During his rule there was a severe famine almost for one decade. To provide employment to starving people Asaf-ud-Daula undertook the construction of this Imambara which was started in 1784 and completed in 1798. Nearly twenty thousand people were employed to complete this huge mansion. The Nawab spent nearly one crore rupees for this construction. Every year he spent four to five lakhs to beautify and maintain this building. He selected an architect from Delhi, Kifayitullah, who used his talent and skills to construct this building in ornamental Mughal style. The western entrance called “Roomi Gate or Turkish Gate” is the west-facing 59 feet high entrance gate with three arches done with lavish decorations.  The  arches have the royal insignia of dual fish carved on them. It was built in ancient Awadhi style and resembles the gateway at Istanbule, Turkey, once the capital of the Roman Byzantine Empire. The word “Roomi” is the changed version of the word “Rome”. On the top of the three-storied Darwaja, a small octagonal place called “Chattri or Umbrella” is seen looking over both sides of the gate. A staircase leads up to it. This place was used for vigilance or for ligting up the gate. Four minarets are seen at four corners.  The 67-foot tall Husainabad clock tower adjacent to Roomi gate was constructed by Nawab Nasir-ud-Din Haider in 1881 to mark the arrival of Sir George Couper, the first Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces of Awadh. The eastern entrance gate was destroyed by the British in 1858 when this building was converted to a military fort.The roof of Imambara was made from rice husk and the roof has been put together with interlocking bricks without any beam or girder. No wood or metal has been used in this building. This is a unique building with arched entrances without having any pillars for support. Unlike the Mughals who used red stone, the Nawabs of Lucknow used limestone which is delicate and can be carved with designs of creepers, various flowers and intricate designs. This building has three halls—China hall with decorative domes, Persian hall with the graves of Nawab’s family and Tazias (replicas of the tombs) of Imam Hussain and Hasan who sacrificed their lives at Karbala in 680 A.D. and the Kharbooza Hall the domed ceiling of which is shaped like a watermelon.  The Persian Hall is the most spacious hall measuring 170x55x15 feet without any supporting columns. In the center of large vaulted Persian hall the graves of Asf-Ud-Daula, his wife and the architect, Khifayoitullah are seen. Just above the central hall one can see eight chambers with different heights permitting the space above to be re-constructed as a labyrinth or maze (called BhulBhulaiya) with interconnected one thousand passage ways through 489 identical doorways. This maze supports the weight of the building. Our guide told us that the royal ladies used to come through secret underground passage to attend the prayers conducted in the central hall. People say that there are many secret passages leading to Gomti River and even up to Agra and Allahabad. It would be better to enter the maze with the help of a guide as there is a risk of losing one’s way in the labyrinth with so many passages and doors.  On the left side of this building there is a step well of Pre-Nawabi Era with five stories called ‘ShahiBaoli” built in Indo-Islamic style. It is a water reservoir used for supplying water to people. This reservoir is connected to Gomti River. Only the topmost two stories of the step well are seen and the three stories are under water. On the right side of the building there is Asifi Masjid where only Muslims are permitted. This monument is open from 6.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. One should go in decent dress to visit this sacred religious place. The entry fee is rs.50/- per person and Rs.500/- for NRIs. It would be better to take the help of a guide. We bought a ticket from U.P. Tourism office at 400/- per person. They will provide the vehicle along with the guide. We need not pay the entrance and parking fee. Of course only historic monuments are included in the schedule and not temples or parks. This monument is really a worth seeing construction with many unique features and is a typical specimen of the Indo-Mughal architecture."
It's okay - didn't think it was amazing.,This is obviously a very important piece of Lucknow history but as a tourist it wasn't amazing to go around.  I must add that we had a tour guide for the first part which I believe everyone probably gets - he was amazing and by far the best part of the experience.
Amusing visit,"I went to Imambara with my family. It was truly amazing to explore it. The guide we hired explained us stories and beliefs behind the architecture and artefacts present in the Imambara. It had a hallway where one can hear whisperings so loud and clear regardless of the long distance present in between the source of sound and the listener. The labyrinth present was cool to explore and without a guide one can surely get lost. It also had a stepping well and one can see the person's reflection in the well, who is standing outside of the gate from inside. Overall its a nice place to explore on a fine day. Also the monument is aesthetically pleasing as the architecture is remarkable."
Excellent place to visit and get a glimpse of the past glory of India in full splendor,Enjoyed every moment of our stay. Will need at least 6 days stay at Lucknow if you have to do justice to your trip to Lucknow.
Wonderful history,The architecture is stunning and the preservation of this site has been very good.  You can opt for a guide but I didn't need one. Reading the history of why this was built was very interesting - you need to go there to find out!
A good historical bulding,"This place is a good attraction in Lucknow.Entry fee is 50 rs.It's premises is vast and many other buildings are inside it.Beware of guides they can cheat you.They forced to hire them with min. 125 rs.With it's entry ticket, you can see Chhota Imambara also for free."
gud place,wonderful city great people by the language and neuter special about food that awadhi food is awesome i really enjoyed and like it very much.....
Imambara,"A staircase from outside leads to a series of labyrinths known as Bhool-Bhulaiyan, which is a complicated entanglement of zig-zag passages. Visitors are advised to visit only with authorised guides."
Iconic,Lucknow's Iconic landmark that should not be given a miss .You need to buy one ticket that holds good for also Chotta Imambara too.One can take pictures all through of great architecture  as well as religious objects inside  .
Beautiful architecture ,"Excellent Awadhi architectural style with grand complex consisting of Imambara, masjid, a beautiful Baoli and labyrinth going up to the top floor of the Imambara. The view from the top was stunning. A must visit place."
City of Nawabs,Mesmerizing architecture and beautiful landscape.  Bhool Bhulaiya - A must visit place in Lucknow apart from other places in the city.  One can also go to Chowk which is at stone throw distance and enjoy authentic lucknowi cuisine
Beautiful buildings and gardens,"Very interesting and well preserved buildings and beautifully maintained gardens. A very impressive vaulted (""unsupported"") ceiling in the grand hall and interesting exhibits in some of the alcoves. Well worth the visit."
Grand Heritage,"A great structure of all time. If story of Asaf Ud Daula, nawab who built this grand building, as told during visit is true then he was also a great ruler. There was saying in his period ""jiske na da maula usko de Asaf Ud Daula"" meaning "" even if God is not taking care of anyone then Asaf Us Daula takes care of him""."
Historic site,Historic site. Easy access from KD Singh metro station. Ample parking available. Unique construction. Must visit
definitely worth visiting,Spent a really nice morning here. Guide was excellent. very interesting place. Shame it never stopped raining!
Bara imambara ,"There is actually 4 things main is Bara Imambara, Bhul Bhulaiya, Asifi Masjid and Baowli it's all build by awad 4th Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula it's made by Iran's architecture it's completed in 11 years.It's really beautiful when ever you went Lucknow must visit here❤️❤️❤️"
Nice plc,Heart of lucknow ....iam veey happy feel the nawabi touch in this city...........bara imambara is nice plc  for feel good..
Must Visit Place,"There are three things to see in bada imambada - baoli, bhul bhulaiya and imambada. Hiring a guide is must to enter bhul bhuliya. The rate of guide is fixed and depends on number of persons. Photography is allowed everywhere."
Awesome place ,"I was not very keen to visit this place, however I am glad I did visit. It’s superbly but and one can see the architecture which has imprints Of Moghuals. A must see if you are in Lucknow."
A most visit place,I visited here with my husband and kids . Architecture is beautiful . Bhulbhulaya was fun . We also took a guide who helped us to explore this place ...
Interesting buildings,"The buildings in this complex are interesting in design. The great assembly hall is a large hall unsupported by any pillars. Take the steps up and explore the labyrinth and see how this architectural feat was achieved. The surrounding area is also very interesting with lovely buildings and gateways. It's a very pretty area.Entrance was 500rupees and you must have a guide.Shoes off to explore. The mosque was only open for pryaers, not visitors."
Much better than expected,"We stopped off to have a quick visit and I am very glad we did. At first it didnt feel very nice. Lots of beggars, needed cash for tickets which we didnt have, didnt see any women at first and the men were staring. When we decided to leave the guide came up and started showing us the labyrinth and the history and it became really interesting and felt safe. I normally dont use guides but in this case I really recommend to understand the history of the place and to get out of the labyrinth!"
Bhool Bhulaiya,"A visit to Lucknow without visiting Bara Imambara famous for its Bhool Bhulaiya, is incomplete. A monument with fantastic architecture and history. Advisable to take a guided tour."
Worth a visit when you are at Lucknow,"We arrived at the Bara Imambara. There are 3 main sections - Baoli well, Labyrinth and Asafi Mosque. You will need to take a guide here - the good thing is the guide prices are fixed, however, each section has a different guide and price. We enjoyed the architecture of the Baoli well. In the Labyrinth(Bhool-Bhulaiya), do take the guide as it is well worth it. They will also leave you to find your way out (don't worry, they will be around ;) ). It's a good experience overall and gets completed in around 1 hour."
Worth seeing historical place,Bada imamabara is one of the top recommendation to visit. It is very nice and worth visiting it. It was neat and clean.
An architectural marvel,The most popular tourist destination of Lucknow n rightfully so. Very beautiful and well maintained. The kids would love the place specially the Bhool Bhulaiyaan but it's advisable to take a guide to get a complete experience.
Overwhelming ,The place is huge.  The architecture is magnificent and fairly well preserved.  This must have been quite spectacular in era that the rulers were here.  It is well worth visiting if you are in Lucknow.
Good to visit once...,"Dress decently and modestly. On entering it gives a very grand view but not so well maintained. Taking a guide is a chaos. Also a much hyped ""bhul bhulaiyya"" is so much overcrowded that one loses the feel of it. Avoid fridays as it is quite crowded."
Imposing presence,"The bada imambara is well worth a visit, it has an imposing presence and gives a great feeling of its historical significance. Very conveniently located it can be visited very easily.Avoid the Bhool Bhulaiyan, it was a very bad experience. The entire bhoolbhulaiyan is really narrow and claustrophbic but the worst part is it stinks of sweat and grime and make it impossible to stay there but once youre in youre trapped till the guide takes you out. Not worth getting in, Enjoy the Imambara and its features like the Jal Mahal which is beautiful if tall and a no of steps."
Amazing,"We never expected this unbelievable architecture in Lucknow. It was expansive, interesting, unique, fascinating. NOT to be missed!"
Are h,"The Bara Imambara of Lucknow is one of the most famous monuments of the city. Also known as Asfi Imambara, after the name ofafter the name of the Nawab of Lucknow who got it constructed, important place of worship for the Muslims The Imambara is primarily known for its incredible maze, known as Bhul Bhulaiya locally, which is located on the upper floor of the monument. It is said that there are 1024 ways to get inside.very good architecture design."
Impressive,"Such an impressive sight and place to explore. We didn't take or felt we needed a guide. You have to hand your shoes at the outdoor counter before you go in. Often closed on holidays, so check ahead of your visit, well worth it."
Wow,Bara imambara is lucknow s one of the bestest monument built by mughal emperor.This is UNESCO s one of the best building and I love the weather there and such a huge feeling there
Great place,Nice historic place..beautifully made and designed architecture..A must visit if you visit Lucknow..
The main attraction of Lucknow…,I visited Bara Imambara on my visit to Lucknow during the evening. As it was near closing time we had to go in a guided group tour of the place. Also couples need to mandatorily take a guide here. The place has good architecture with the Baoli and Bhul Bhulaiya being the main attractions. The place also has a mosque in its compound along with the famous Rumi Darwaza. Also you need to take off your shoes when visiting the place.
Awesome place,Visited this place after a long time with some friends and we enjoyed a lot. A must visit destination in lucknow. You can actually feel the old nawabi style. The Grandness of the hall and exhibits are good. What a feeling to be at Bara imambara( bhool bhualiya).
Memorable Place ,"We visited and enjoyed a lot in this place. Historical memory has captured in mind, it's very nice. Good to see.."
Ancient architecture.,"If you are looking for an archaeological site her you should come. Making of this site is completely different from any other space in India, you can feel the vibes of vintage Lucknow"
"Expensive, but interesting! ","The Bara Imambara is one of Lucknow's most well known buildings, and is worth a visit.It costs 500r to enter as a foreigner (much steeper than the 50r for Indian's), but it's easy to spend a few hours exploring, and is ultimately worth the money.I particularly enjoyed the Labyrinth on the top floor of the maze, great fun to find your way around!"
A must visit place in Lucknow,"one of the most famous monuments of Lucknow is Bara Imambara. Bara Imambara is very famous for its incredible maze, known by the name “Bhul Bhulaiya “ and is located on the first floor of this monument. Bhul Bhulaiya has around 1024 ways to get inside but only two ways to come out. People can also view the grave of Nawab Asaf-Ud-Dowlah and his crown, kept in the middle of the hall. This Monument is famous for its religious as well as architectural importance. Bara Imambara is the largest Civil structure that is made without the use of wood or metal and is still standing without the support of beams. It is considered an an outstanding specimen of engineering and the best example of the Mughal Architecture.It is a worth seeing place of Lucknow."
WORTH VISITING,"Bara Imambara, Asifi Mosque, Bhul Bhulaiya, Baoli are all very interesting monuments.A guided tour is recommended, requires atleast 2 hrs to cover the place."
good historical place to visit,Try to make an inclusive visit to all places that are around. An Auto will take you around for a nominal charge. A horse cart is also an option.
Wonderful building,One can only be impressed by the skill of the builders who construct and design these building. I think you need a guide but it will be worth it. Try not to rush and enjoy the scale of the building and decorations around you.
Khoobsurat-e-lucknow,All can visit this place . This place is the AAN BAN n Shaan of lucknow . ❤This place is the heart of lucknow. ❤
Day out with friends,We went over there to see bhul bhulaiyaa.It is said that there are numerous ways to enter the monument but you will get mingled and can't comeback on same track..so it's compulsory to take guide over there.Must visit place in old Lucknow
Tourist,Visit to Bhool Bhoolayya above Bara Imam highly recommended with authorised guide available at Rs100/
Disappointing...,"I visited this place some time ago and really enjoyed my visit.. However, this time around I was disappointed to learn that the admission price was ~£5 per person. Furthermore, you could no longer take a camera into the main hall or visit the labyrinth/rooftop above the hall.Came away felling robbed this time around!"
Huge mosque and gate,The grounds here are extensive and include an impressive massive ornamental gate called the Rumi Darwaza. We were told no photos but noticed all the other visitors were taking pictures with their cameras without incident. You are not able to bring in an actual camera but they don’t prevent phones (with cameras). Head covering was not required for us here. There is a really cool labyrinth to explore but be sure to have someone with you.
One time visit,Bhool bhulaiya is good and must visit. Architecture wise nice to see but getting worn off. Go atleast once if you have time in Lucknow. I dont think so you will remember any history but a guide is a must
Beautiful architecture.,"Loved the place. Would have preferred if they had audio guide available too to get more details on the history of the place. However, I guess you will need a person as a guide in the Bhool Bhulaiya so that you do not get lost."
Best place in Lucknow ,"The best place in lucknow. This imambara has three portions with separate entry tickets. 1.Bauli 2.Imambara 3. Bhool Bhoolaiya. The bhool bhoolaiya is amazing. You can easily lose your way out inside. So better to take a guide. It will take atleast 2.5hrs to cover the Bara Imambara. You can buy a combined ticket of Rs 50 which also  include entry to chota imambara, Picture gallery just within 1km of Bara Imambara. Beware of fake guides and e rickshaw drivers posing as guide as they don't have the permission to enter the monuments. official guide is available inside the monument."
Historical visit,"If you love historical places and architecture, this is a must visit place. The architectural beauty is amazing. The place is truly rich in culture. And the history behind the place is interesting too. Suggestion: Hire a guide especially when visiting the labyrinth, it will be much more fun and exciting"
Nice Place,Must VisitLucknow Ki Famous Place Nice PlaceMust GoLucknow Ka Famous Place Beautiful Structure#LUCKNOWKAZAYAKA- DRANIMESHVERMA
"Mesmerizing piece of history, terribly disappointing tour","I visited Bada Imambara to revisit the place I had been to, more than 25 years ago and was expecting a similarly exciting tour of Bhul Bhulaiya along with the baoli.The buildings are legendary, the architecture impeccable and the history associated with it is remarkable.But the overall tour was disappointing. May be I was unlucky to get a terrible guide. But the tour was very short compared to what I had see all those years ago. In fact lot of details I remembered, I had to ask the guide and he did not know off. he finally told us that government has shortened the tours. Visit the place for the fascinating monuments but don't bank too much on the tour guides."
History revisited ,This is one of the famous places in Lucknow. One must visit it to know the history & heritage of the city and ancient times. Good architecture and sufficient place to roam around and see the whole area. I should say it’s must visit place.
Bara Imambara,Nice place. If you are in Lucknow then a good place to visit. No trouble from the tour guides. Friendly place. Tour guides are available at reasonable rates.
Lucknow ki shaan,Excellent place to explore... i like this place... awesome location. also good for photography. thnks
Historic,It is a lovely historic place. Decently maintained. Takes you back in time. It is of religious importance to many. One of the few monuments to see in Lucknow.
Awesome,"It is an awesome place. Even the gatehouse is a fantastic thing, so you are impressed well before you get to the main building. That is just astonishing. I was not expecting the so-called labyrinth to be up to much, but it really is a labyrinth, but on that is upstairs and three-dimensional, spreading over several floors. Superb views once you get to the top and well worth the effort. The only annoyance about this place is that they don't allow taking of photos with real cameras, but allow any kind of photo with a phone."
Historical Lucknow ki Shaan,"Excellent place to watch...Worth going there to roam around Imambara and Bhul Bhulaiyya..A monument to know some history of Nawabs of Awadh... and the best thing is Roomi Gate adjacent to it, by which Lucknow is known."
Amazing Architecture!,"This monument, built to provide employment to people at a time of famine is an architectural marvel. Do hire a guide and try to find your way through the maze. Highly recommended."
Bara imambara heritage history of Persian engineering and architecture. T,"he most interesting thing is, it has no pillars and the halls are huge and huge! There are said to be 1024 secret paths! Make sure you hire a guide to get that enquisite juices! Attaching some marvellous Persian architecture engineering!"
Amazing building ,An Amazing building structure with mazes like tunnels. The building dates back to before 1800. It contains a mosque and a hall for shia Muslim
"Beautiful, Majestically nostalgic",Do visit. The views are amazing. I would recommend going at dusk. Birds arise and flock and the stone takes on magical colours.
Bara Imambara,"It was a little cloudy the day I visited, which was a good thing else it can get very hot. The monument has a ticket system and for the Boali inside and the Bhul Bhulaiya you can get local guides inside at a fixed price. I loved the monument and the masjid, baoli and the Bhul Bhulaiya, however it can be a little more clean."
Excellent historic place,"It bespeaks of the rich architectural heritage of India. The concept, design & execution of this architectural wonder is commendable. Bara imambara complex has Bhul bhulaiya, Baoli, Maqbara & Mosque to see in addition to to the grand imambara. Taking a guide is very good idea. From the rooftop one can see several other monuments of this great city. A must-see. There're toiletes (not very clean), water as well as a small outlet selling cold drinks etc inside the complex."
Bara Imambara,Bara Imambara is a historical monument located in Lucknow city of India. People visiting Lucknow should visit this place.
The Bara Imambara is a stunning point of view to visit in Lucknow...,"The Bara Imambara is a part of the heritage walk in Lucknow. And Its central hall is said to be the largest vaulted chamber in the world. I visited the place in July. November or December is a pleasant time to visit in Lucknow Uttar Pradesh. Winter is the best season to explore the heritage walk of the city. Definitely visit the Chhota Imambada and chowk nearby. Having a guide will help since the Imamabada is famous for its labyrinth. The monument is huge with a large number of staircases, so it would be a good idea to carry water and some wipes with you."
Heritage love,"For a heritage lover, there doesn't have to be reasons to like our heritage buildings. Nonetheless, the Bara Imambara scores on the maintenance of its premises, & the easy & fair availability of authorised guides who explain the history behind the monument.The building was constructed in 1785 to provide employment, when a famine hit Awadh. The architecture is worth a mention, specially of echoing walls, & hidden cloisters. Its central hall is the largest vaulted chamber in the world.To enjoy the monument fully, do take a guide. Apart from the main structure, the Bhool Bhulaiya, the Asafi Mosque, & the Shahi Baoli are other attractions within the premises."
Loved the History and Guided Tour ,"Grab yourself guide and take in the architecture and history of this landmark... oh and also get lost in the Labyrinth... lots of stairs and tunnels leading around the building. Blown away how they could see through reflections people coming to the gate or even the mirrors that reflect light into the interior, and not forgetting the wall you could whisper and hear from one side to another..."
Interesting piece of history,I find there's so much history in this place and that its so under-marketed...Take a local guide so that you know what's going on
"Amazing experience, amazing architecture","Its a monument of an era where the generosity of rulers was tangible and real. The birthplace of biryani, its the ultimate solution to the conspiracies of royal courts!"
Heritage place of Lucknow ,"Mushkuraiye janab aap Lucknow m hai. Quite often I saw the crowd of old Lucknow saying this. That amazed me, the thrill of narrow lanes of bhool bhulaiya. Once it was suffocated because, two lines were crossing between the narrow lane. Which was like nightmare. Rest the beauty of this place will always attract the tourists ❤"
Super,Its very beautiful disining we visit many time in lucknow but I have never seen .in this time I get chance by my friend will highly recommend to my friends
Rich heritage But it should be maintained.,"Good Place to explore. But people should understand the value and stop writing on the walls. Strict measures to be taken on the same. For us, it was a nice trip with the family."
Extraordinary history to this site! ,Got a chance to visit this historical monument recently which has a great story behind it's architecture! Try not to go in afternoon! They have a compulsion of Guides for Couples and is in cash so no receipt for that! Which is a bad point! Other than that it's a really photographic place hence definitely a must visit in Lucknow
Most disappointing ,"Another highly mismanaged monument, very dirty and over crowded, on top up that highly mismanaged. Guides take money and runaway. It seems they are doing great favors on tourist by guiding them. Looks like ASI deliberately left such a good architect to ruin by local management. Ticket price should immediately be raised to ensure crowd management is proper and monuments can generate some revenue to take of itself. Visiting famous Bhool Bulaiya and Bauli was another disappointing experience. Won’t recommend to visit with family and in the evening. Beware of cheated guides."
Witness of Lucknow's glamorous history,"Bada Imambara is what India Gate is to New Delhi, as far as tourism is concerned. Every visitor to Lucknow visits Bara Imambara. It is a grand example of the glamorous Nawabi history of Lucknow. The complex has a big mosque which is called Aasifi Mazjid. The main attraction is Bhool Bhulaiya, which has approx 1000 gates and windows to pass through and one cannot remember which door was used to enter and the passage passed through. It has marvellous architecture and build quality which cannot be built in the current developed world. There is also one Baoli, step well, in the complex with running ground water source in it. The complex is very big and an example of India's rich cultural and architectural heritage. One should hire a Guide to understand its history properly. Guides are available in the complex on pre-fixed charges."
The labyrinth is fun,"Quite a lot to explore here, from the huge palace to the gardens. Rooms in palace form a maze and easy to lose bearings. Lots of very dark and narrow corridors.  Won't be to everyone's liking."
Great place new rules,This is absolutely stunning place and a must visit when in Lucknow. However now there are strict rules about dress codes and people are expected to dress conservatively. Also a few portions have been closed down that were earlier accessible.
Very Good Place To Visit.,Gud pLace To visit in November Or December. Nice Mounment. Do Take a guide to Know Exactly about this Place.
imambaras for the Shias,A very interesting structure of that bygone era of the Shias.hated by the Sunnis after Aurangzeb ruled. Worst of the Sunni Nawabs left for Pakistan like the Liaqat bros. they don't like tourist going to the beautiful Imambaras big and small
Gud place to visit,Gud place to visit. Its crowded and be safe.. Lot of locals approach for guidance.... You will get lot of battery autos to visiting in and around that place...
Imambara history and laybrynth ,Scintillating architectural marvel. Super structure is having bhul bhulaiya(laybrynth) inside the walls. It's really wonder how such big domes are standing on these walls without pillar support in centres. Really a marvel. This place is must visit. May take a guide if u really want to know about the history of the place.
A Hurried Trip,Being the evening time it was pretty crowded . But it is worth a visit nevertheless . It houses the Bhul Bhulaiya for the adventure seekers . The garden in front is well maintained . It is a large complex and houses other structures too .
Must visit for vulvulaia,Take a guide for vulvulaia. It's a historical place and you will be wondering about the structure and architechture
Architectural marvel ,This place is absolutely magnificent. The architecture of this monument is amazing. Take a government approved guide to show you around this place. I the labyrinth is definitely a place to try. The place is clean and we'll maintained by the authorities. It's so peaceful and one should definitely visit this place
Bara Imambara Bhool Bhuliya,"Visited the architectural marvel along with both kids and better half on 16th fm 08:00 hrs to 11:00 hrs . Its indeed a building which signifies best of architectural design and beauty , but the way it's being managed by the board/ management (if there is any) it's far below standard . Few DOs : carry ur own water steel bottle , as the plastic bottle sold is local made and drinking water cooler is neither clean not marked in which year it was . Juices and snacks prices are jacked up , if hungry carry own snacks - it's permissible . Carry good pixel - dslr (nominal fee) / mobile (permitted) and no other visible restriction . Local guide is required if you intend to know the history of the building , can be negotiated at rs.30-35 per person , for 4 persons we paid rs.125 Handicapped person cannot visit due to no supportive infrastructure .Wear thick cotton socks as walking without shoes only is permitted in labyrinth (bhool bhuliya) , prefer October to March cooler months . During summer months the building roof galleries and terraces are  not covered with carpet (dari) , causing severe sun burns on ur feet (socks++)  - which are best locations to take snaps thru telephoto lenses or high mm lenses , with entire old Lucknow as background . While purchasing ticket , purchase combined ticket for seeing five buildings , it's nominal as low as rs.50 per person ( kids above 3/5 it's considered adult , tentatively). The local guide for ""bouli"" charges rs.25-30 for group of 4 persons - pl hire to understand the significance of the building.The sacred masjid is not permitted for visit as it's a worship place . Shoes are kept in open (no shade / locker room) with tokens issued @ nominal rs.2 a pair - carry small denomination equivalent coins. Hiring local guide for seeing for all monuments thru combined ticket - roomi darwaja + clock tower + picture gallery + chikan factory (it's no factory but cluster of private owned shops charging exhorbitant ) , along with visits in e-rickshaw costs rs.100 , but there is NO guide per se , rather e-rick guy speaks and we believe :) - no other option . The picture gallery guy (no picture taking permitted) starts moving along and expects to be paid rs.100 or 50 or whatever comfortable . In case of crowd inside the labyrinth , walking in 2.5 ft corridor becomes difficult and smell of substantially old carpet in the pathway is bad - carry handkerchief (with perfume) /masks /ginger water  and stamina to wait to get passage , rather feeling pukey.Overall entire cluster of beautifully made buildings require : professional management by an agency which is monitored , uniform clothes , helpline numbers (aren't any , neither displayed - so called tourist police A4 size mobile number displayed on white page at enterance and two stationary sleuths sitting at main gate ) . Proper shoe cabinet rack availability , Que management , automatic room freshners , fire extinguishers  , infirmary , digital display boards in the respective languages giving authentic information of the respective buildings and knowledgeable recognised (government board approved)  , educated local guides .To know the significance of old Lucknow and its rich history , visit must be made ."
Amazing place ,M loving it... historical place in Lucknow.. amazing m big fan of Lucknow city.... Jane shower park.... hearts of Lucknow... nawabs @@@@..loves
Good experience,Very good experience in this place.. its good for knowing history about our Lucknow... Still in this monument many fact are alive which can realise us the older people were also had used very good technologies in this architecture. Very awesome place for one day tour
Heritage of Lucknow ,"Very nice crafted and built , you can say your lucknow trip can't complete without sèeing Bara Imambara. There is most attractive things is horse ride , they will take you picture gallery as well as Chota Imambara."
"A historical place, need lot of improvement for visitors","Visited this historical place. Place is worth seeing, however lot of improvement is needed on  1. Guide. Outside guide can not take you inside . Inside guides though show you written rates but charge in excess. 2. In full sun, the carpets are staggered here n there and one need to walk bare foot. 3. Lot of trash , hardly any dustbin."
Historical treasure and architectural masterpiece,you must go to the place to see how advanced the nawabs were back then...its an architectural beauty while at te same time the history it contains is mind blowingDont forget to see the advanced scientific phenomenas here
Keshab Chakraborty,"Excellent 👍 Lovely place to enjoy.Real history, reflects, from every corner.Visiting the place, I feel, a great honour ."
Beautiful view from the roof,"It was a long and arduous climb to the roof of the Asfi mosque in the Bara Imambara complex, through the numerous labyrinthine passages and uneven stairs of the Bhulbhulaiya."
A Must Visit place in Lucknow !!,"I had heard a lot of it and was eager to visit it. It did not disappoint. When you buy the ticket of INR 50/- you get to visit 4 places. At each of these places you will be assigned a Guid who will give you the local history. Please take the guide along they give very interesting insights. They will ask for a health tip but i guess it is worth it. In the complex I visited Bouli, the main Hall and the Maze. The place is rich in history !!"
For knowledge of history of Nawabs of Awadh.,"It is good place to see the architecture of the building built by Nawabs of Awadh and bountifulness of airways, hiding place and waterways connected to it."
Bara Imambara,It is great monument built by Nadal asifuddaula. It has the world's tallest roof without pillars or steel.
Its a historical building and a model for architectural structure,"Imambara is a historical building constructed by  Asaf-ud-Daula, Nawab of Awadh in 1784. The building also includes the large Asfi mosque, the Bhul-bhulaiya (the labyrinth), and Bowli, a step well with running water. Two imposing gateways lead to the main hall. It is said that there are 1024 ways to reach the terrace but only one to come back. It is an accidental architecture."
Impressive building,"Unfortunately I visited on a very rainy monsoon day so did not have the best experience.  Too crowded and floors were slippery due to the rain.  I recommend that if you go, wear a cheap pair of flip flops that you can leave outside as you cannot enter wearing shoes."
Historical place,"If you are in Lucknow you have to visit Bara Imambara, a historical beautiful building with great history behind the multiple buildings on the ground.  Must visit."
Mughal Legacy,A huge complex built in  Moghul times to provide meeting and teaching facilities. and a large mosque. Impressive.
Excellent architecture,"Design of building is magnificient .All interior doors coincide with the view to outside , it was designed in such a way that Nawabs soldiers could attack the british troops.There was pool of water in between the path downstairs , it was used as mirror image to see enemies entering from behind .Guides are available there to brief on payment basis.Lots of beggers are there in the surroundings.Difficult to see in intense scorching heat of sun , evening times should be preffered."
Excellent day out,Spent an afternoon at the Bara Imambara. Make sure you get a guide who will take you through the entire complex. The labyrinth is not to be missed and definitely requires guidance to ensure you don’t get lost! The architecture is gorgeous and sunsets are a perfect time for that insta-worthy picture.
Huge place to see historical thigs.,"Imambara is the symbol of fame of nawabs.must be visited in winter.we went roomi darwaza,clock tower.if you visit lucknow may explore this place"
Family,"It's good historical place, but authorities have to keep a check on all discarded food packets being thrown around"
Amazing place ,Superb plc in Lucknow the city of nawabs.... It's the hearts of uttar Pradesh... It's highly recommend..
Attraction Lucknow,Bada Imambada is the main attractionof Lucknow. It is a historical building. The elegance of the building is visible no sooner you enter this area. The Imambada comprises of mainly four buildings or main attractions. On the right side after entrance there is a mosque. On the left side there is famous Bouli. In the main building there is a dargah; and above it is famous Bhool bhulaiya. People visit this place mainly to see Bhool bhulaiya and the bouwli.
Bara Imambara,"Bara Imambara, also known as Asafi Imambara is an imambara complex in Lucknow, India built by Asaf-ud-Daula, Nawab of Awadh in 1784. Bara means big.The building also includes the large Asfi mosque, the Bhul-bhulaiya (the labyrinth), and Bowli, a step well with running water. Two imposing gateways lead to the main hall.

Architectural marvel,It's a architectural marvel with so huge structure created without using any columns or beamsIt also has spots from where you can see the main entry from far off within the imambara but nobody can spot you from outsideThere is one bawari (small pond) where in you can see the reflection of person coming insideA must visit for any tourist visiting Lucknow
lucknow's biggest tourist attraction,the place is steeped in history. It s said that due to famine the then nawab of lucknow asif ud daula got this place built during the day and got it broken during the night so that the dignity of labour would be maintained and the populace kept their heads high. It has a labyrinth of corridors where you will get lost and one can talk thru the walls.All in all an awesome experience
A monument worth visiting to understand Lucknow,Lucknow in known for its Nawabi culture. though there have been many Nawab in Lucknow but Nawab Asifuddaula is the most popular who has given this Bara Imambara to Lucknow. It is a protected monument of ASI and its being maintained. Tickets and guide are not very costly and if you are visiting this place for the first time you must hire a guide so as to enjoy Bhul-Bhulaiya. you can negotiate with guide.
Family Visit,I visited Imambara with my family in Dec 2018. I love this place specially Bhul - Bhulaiya. Guide was perfect
Impressive Shi'a Moslem Mughal architecture.,"Without knowing much of the history of this number one Lucknow site, we enjoyed experiencing the vastness of the entire area and appreciating the architectural beauty. The intense heat, (above 40 C), and humidity mid afternoon at this time of the year made our visit almost unbearable."
historical monument,a fine piece of mughal architecture shows us how rich was their architecture at that time things done at that time does not look possible in present scenario . a must visit
Awe inspiring and huge-a must visit in Lucknow,"The Bara Imambara is spread over a very huge area right in the heart of town. It is a place you must visit and admire the gorgeous Moughal architecture.Large spread out lawns welcome you in, and you can sit around and picnic there.Extremely crowded in the evenings, weekends and holidays.The Bhul Bhuliya is very fascinating and I am told is worth seeing, though I did not venture in.You can spend hours there looking around and picnicking."
My favourite place in Lucknow,The place exudes a nawabi feel to every visitor. You can easily be overwhelmed by the grace and elegance of its architecture.
Superb quality experience,Guide Jaffer Bahadur Shah was excellent. Visitors like Subnam and her family were supportive. Bhulbhulliya was exciting experience.
Could be incredible,"The monument it's self is wonderful but the reason I give a poor rating is the cleanliness of the place. They charge foreigners 500inr to go in but I'm not sure where there money is going other than some official or Mughals back pocket. The place is covered in pan masala stains and rubbish that has been created by the locals, maybe they must charge foreigners 10x more so they have the funds to clean up after the locals? Also there isn't a surface in reach left without graffiti, I even saw discarded tipex pens, wonder what they were used for? They have fake tours but they're easy to shake, just give them a bit of the classic Indian attitude and they'll clear off. You should see but don't expect cleanliness and niceness like you get at the Recidency. Also, if the trust fund cannot look after this place and insists on letting rot it should be handed to ASI for safe keeping."
Highlight of Lucknow,The Bara Imambara is a highlight of Lucknow. Give yourself plenty of time to explore and don’t miss the labyrinth on the roof
The attraction of city 😍,"Most visited place in lucknow. Mostly family members visited here on sundays. At the entrance there are jewellery shops. The loveable shops for gals, like there are jhumkas, sunglasses, etc. The best season to visit here is winter. But if you want to visit here in summer make sure you are carring water bottles with you. Overall it's well and good. 👍"
A Magnificent Mosque,A strikingly impressive display of architectural genius and building prowess considering when it was buitl.
lucknow times,"the complex was built in 1784 and has a asfi mosque , bhul bhulia and bowli . its an historical place made by nawabs . lucknow visits is incomplete till the time you dont explore the imambara"
A must visit heritage site,"The Imambara of Lucknow, or the 'Bada Imambara', as it is popularly referred to by the locals, is a heritage trip and the amazing architecture, the glorious history attached with the edifice and the magnificent journey right into 'Nawabi Awadh' should not be missed by travelers. It was a wonderful experience, with the guide( do hire a guide) filling in us details of the rich history associated with the place, the 'Bhool Bhulaiya' (four paths that cross each other, one leads to the gardens, the others to the roof) and the overall experience made it a delightful visit. Also, since you ARE visiting this place, take the help of some ever so kind locals to explore Chowk and fill yourself to the brim with some delectable  Lakhnawi dishes... Thank you:)"
Historical place - worth visiting once,"Historical place. Come here to appreciate the age old architecture. Not recommended for a hot weather day. Preferably, take a guide here someone who can explain to you the story behind this construction."
A beautiful building with an interesting back-story,"A massive pile made more impressive because the ""architect"" who built it (according to the story) had no training. The large central hall is covered by an unsupported vaulted roof, somewhat unsettling today but it's still standing. You will need a guide to tour the building. Shoes off, you should certainly climb the maze of stairways leading to some great rooftop views. Note the steps are steep and (approximately) a 12 inch rise. The halls are narrow, and the ceilings would make it tight for anyone over 6'3 or so but (on a sunny day) it's not all that claustrophobic. The views, again, are very good. The passageways are the stuff of legend; some of have been walled up because people disappeared. We made it out safely."
Architectural marvel,"Huge, beautiful complex with architecture that was ahead of its time, you can easily spend a couple of hours walking around."
Crew day,Very nice place to see and visit  next time igo Lucknow zoo always there is such a beautiful to see in india
Nice place to visit ,"Bada Imambada is a historic monument one must visit when in Lucknow.Nicely maintained.One must hire a guide if want to explore.Bouli,Bhul Bhulaiya,Aasifi Masjid and nearby monuments to be also explored."
Must see,"It's really a beautiful place. A place of living faith, please remember that on Fridays, it is open only after 3pm after prayers.The history, the architecture and the beautiful gardens maintained alongside on the inside is beautiful. Definitely, a must see."
Don’t miss this place if you visit the city,"Certainly it is a amazing place in the city, don’t miss the chance to visit there if you reach the city"
one must visit,"one must visit for its architecture, beautiful structures surrounding its cost 50 rupees entry fee, with the tkt you can visit chota imamwada free"
Attraction Lucknow Continued,Many would call it a different place but I would say that it is the package attraction that comes with Rumi darwaza. While the place has additional religious importance it also has the heritage appeal too.
Historical Building,"Excellent Mughal Architecture. If one visits Lucknow and has not been here then he has not seen Lucknow. The Choota Imambara , Clock Tower and Picture Gallery are also just walking distance from Bara Imambara. Must see Places in Lucknow to know the traditional Awadh and Nawabi buildings."
BARA IMAMBARA - Pride of Lucknow,"If any monument sums up the Lucknow Andaaz then it has to be Bara Imambara, It has magnificent Awadhi architecture , it was built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula in 1784. It has beautiful gardens and also it's very famous maze 'Bhool bhulaiya'. In all its a must place to visit in Lucknow. Hence do visit."
Nice outing,Bada Imambara is a must visit when in Lucknow. Dont miss the Bhul bhulaiyya and Baoli inside the complex. Do take a guide for bhul bhulaiyya. Rates are mentioned there so dont fall for traps. Might get very crowded so better visit early or on a weekday
Best historical structure in lucknow,"Bara imambara is built as part of drought relief measure , it is a imposing structure which has several secrets inside it . It has Bhul-bhulaiya which would confuse us , if not with a guide .it is built with out use of any iron or doesn’t have any European influence ."
Awesome,Well all of us love to visit old places and bada imambada is perfect. Love the place. Hire a guide and enjoy the whole place. Also dont belive in all the things they say. Some of the things are fake. Overall the place is wonderful.
A good place to visit,"The place is excellent, though it require some good care of government. If taken proper care of this can turn to be one of the most popular tourist attractions of Lucknow. The place has a big huge hall, a maze like place called bhool bhilai where you get lost and a huge well called Bawri. Like everywhere in India, here too they have different entry rates for foreigners. You are immediately surrounded by guides. There is really no fixed rates for guides. Overall an excellent place marred by poor management."
BHOOL BHULAIYYA,Bara imambara is popularly known as BHOOL BHULAIYYA.It is a good architect work built by asaf ud daulla in 1784.Building is so built that even a very slow sound can be heard in opposite side.There is a big hall in the middle.A bouli is also very near to Bara imambara.Gardening is very good.
Architecture marvel,The whole complex of buildings are architectural marvels.. First visit it's good to have a guide so that you could understand the complex architecture.. Avoid holidays and weekends as it can get too crowded and suffocating.. Bhul bhulaiya is gud if less crowded..
Take your shoes off and indulge!!,"This place has a terrific atmosphere and belies all the nastiness you hear about the islam faith. People were lovely, the building is truly special with amazing acoustics, and the labrynth...OK, find out for yourself but allow plenty of time. Enjoy"
Impressive,Don’t miss. It’s set in beautiful gardens and is a striking  edifice. Take your time wandering round and you’ll be rewarded. Every inch tells  story.
Gud tourist place.,"Awesome place but please don't pay the tourist guides for being showing you the place. they only took money and just make you walk,. Just go by yourself enjoy yourself or with your co-partners and family. But it's really great experience here."
An Architectural Marvel.,"Enter the Imambara via an impressive gate. A circular lawn & flowers then comes which is well maintained & colourful. Then the approach to the main building with the massively impressive Asif Mosque to your right ( no entry to non- muslim's but you can walk across the front.)  Shoes have to be left outside the Imambara in care of the shoe wallah's.    The great hall is constructed without pillar's- a technological wonder. High & wide & painted a rather bilious green colour.   Plenty of avaricious guides to hand- don't bother. You can read all about it before or after your visit. Climb up to the labyrinth ( bhoolbulayia ) a warren of similar passages, apertures & doorways. There is only one way in & one way out but people mill about in the semi gloom for a while making whooping noises. You can emerge on the roof for wonderful views over the complex & away to the city.  500r entry fee for foreigner's but hang on to your ticket because it will get you in the Chota Imambara, too."
History stays here,"Baraimambara is an example of not only art but its proof of scientific application in construction. Same looking lanes does not only keep you indulged in understanding the building plan, but also keep you amused with its vastness. All stairs goes towards the rooftop, so in case, you feel like trying to explore the place alone and lose the track, strt going upstairs. Lucknow looks great from the roof."
A Mosque in Lucknow Built Without Iron!,"Bara Imambara, also known as Asafi Imambara is an imambara complex in Lucknow, India built by Asaf-ud-Daula, Nawab of Awadh in 1784. Bara means big. The architecture of the complex reflects the maturation of ornamented Mughal design, namely the Badshahi Mosque - it is one of the last major projects not incorporating any European elements or the use of iron. The main imambara consists of a large vaulted central chamber containing the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula."
The real beauty of Lucknow ,"Visiting Bada Imambara was a delightful experience. We got to witness the beautiful architecture created by The Nawab of Lucknow back then in time. There are many small small aspects present under one premises. First is bada imambada(the place where the imaams or religious gurus offer teachings), second is baoli(water storage place) and the third one is bhoolbhulaiya(the maze). All the sights are a must see once in your life."
Bars imambara,An enlightening place this must be included on things to see in Lucknow . Allow a lot of time to visit this is a place that to be appreciated you must not hurry your visit
Not worth,There is nothing much to see out there. The entry to the main hall has been denied and entry to  many significant areas has been prohibited.
Simply amazing!,The architecture of this city is breathtaking and the beauty of the monuments just amazing. It does not take a lot of imagination to ‘see’ the place when there is a religious festival going on. Not to be missed.
My visit to bada imambara,"What a beautiful day spent at the Bata imambara, appreciate the engineering used. Today's generation says that the old people don't know anything but I am sure they are very intelligent after seeing the construction."
Amazing Architecture,This is according to me one of the best and original scientific structure ever made.... It has all the forces of science used architecturally to design every building requiment ....considering how many years ago it was conceptualized
Marvelous architecture ,"Interesting experience especially the architecture as there is much to see and learn. A rip off as it cost us 500rps each whilst Indians get in for just 50. Then the so called guides harass you for money and the shoe keeper wants cash for minding shoes. Then there's lots of beggars, did they pay to get in? Nice walk around for an  hour or so but not worth 500. So I'd give it a miss."
Nice architecture,"Well the main hall of this structure doesn't have any coloumn, that makes it quite amazing. Bhul-Bhulaiya and Bowali are also amazing places just not to be missed."
Visit with a Guide and you'll be amazed,"I have visited this place several times along with friends and family. And being an Architect myself, I end up noticing some new fascinating detail everytime I am there. Famous worldwide for the column-free hall and for the Bhool-Bhulaiya (the labyrinth) on the upper floors, this building has a back-story that must be known to each citizen of the Oudh region. It fills your heart with praise for the fact that a good ruler (like Nawab Asif-ud-Daula) can really make a difference. Highly recommended for any visitor to the city and even to the lakhnavi people."
Good place in Lucknow,This is a must visit in Lucknow. Go early on a holiday as it gets crowded during the latter half.Bhul bhulaia and baoli are key not to be missed attractions.
Exquisite building!,"It was a pleasure to walk around this heritage site. It was a a Sunday ,so very crowded but the premises could be cleaner . It is a specimen of the Avadh architecture and definitely worth a visit ."
Interesting,Interesting experience altogether as there is much to see and learn. Guides are thugs though and bluff you into parting with your money making false promises.Nice walk around for a couple of hours
Historical place,"I visited Bara Imambara alongwith my friends who had come all the way from Kerala to meet me and visit Lucknow.The Asafi Imambara, also known as the large Imambara or Bara Imambara is a mosque complex  built by Asaf ud Daula, in 1784.The building also includes the large Asfi mosque the bhul-bhulaiya and Boweli.Two imposing gateways lead to the main hall. It is said that there are 1024 ways to reach the terrace but only one to come back.The main imambara consists of a large and huge hall containing the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. At 50 by 16 meters and over 15 meters tall, it has no beams supporting the ceiling and is one of the largest such arched constructions in the world.what a experience we had ....no words to express."
Nice Experience,It was a great day to rome around Bada Imambara. The view was very nice.it was a great place for hangout.
A nice pleant experience,This is a massive place. Just overwhelming in its size. Well organised too with systematic system of keeping shoes etc. before entering the main mausoleum. Interesting decor inside particularly the roofs. Need a guide to show you around. Camera is handy.The bhoolbulaiya or maize is through narrow staircase not for the fainthearted though.
Big Structure,Huge building complex situated in the heart of Lucknow town. Huge courtyards with beautiful gardens add glory. The main building houses the tomb of Nawab Asaf ud Dullah and his Begum. There is a huge mosque and a Deep Well called Baoli which used to be the Royal treasure. But the structure needs immediate renovation at least water proofing and painting.
Visit to an historic site,"This is the leader amongst the 5 sites in the area. It necessitates a guided tour, no individual adventure is permitted. The reason being the labyrinth or bhulbhulayya. The intricate passages will challenge any newcomer and one will get lost in narrow, dark passages.The gallery on the top gives a beautiful view of the surrounds.Worth a visit, but poorly maintained by the trust."
Special Religious Place with the Architecure of typical Mughal Style,"Bara Imambara is a special religious place. It is also known as Asif Imambara because it was built in 1783 by the Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula of Lucknow. Imambara is one of the most outstanding buildings in Lucknow. There is also a Shrine, a bhul bhulaiya - ie a bhawarjal, a bawdi or stairwell well and a tomb of a compound which is furnished with a festoon shape. The architecture of Imambara displays the typical Mughal style, which is very similar to that of Pakistan's governor's mosque in Pakistan and is considered the world's fifth largest mosque. The main feature of the design of this building is that there is no use of iron anywhere and no European style architecture has been included. The main hall of this building is 50x16x15 meters, where no support has been made on the roof. The big Imambara is known for its bhul bhulaiya where there are many misleading paths which are connected to each other and there are a total of 489 doors in it. It is believed that there was also a long way that went towards the river Gomti, which is currently closed."
Beautiful monument,Its a beautiful monument but if you are two people or more try to take your personal guide otherwise you could get confused between all that crowd. You have to walk barefoot to see the inside of the bhool bhulaiya (labyrinth) so carry socks if you can. But overall its a nice place you get to see the city view from the top as well.
Interesting ceilings,"This was a revisit, and the interiors of the ground floor are picturesque.  One needs a guide to go to the upper floors, and ours was good.  The maze is not for the claustrophobic.  From the roof, one gets a pretty good view of the gate and adjacent mosque."
Awesome visit ,It's a must to visit place for all if you are in Lucknow. This is place which gives you feel of Nawabs aura.
Magnificent Monument,"The Asafi Imambara, also known as the Bara Imambara is a complex in lucknow built by Asaf-ud-daula, Nawab ofAwadh. Its a magnificent structure. A must visit."
Awesome place...,Beautiful place to visit. Enjoyed a lot in searching the way out . Really a Bhull bhulaiya 😂. Also found the place where late Sridevi shoot the Mom movie . 😊
Must visit,We visited this place in the month of november and it was just superb place. A very well maintained bhool bhulaiya ( maze) dont forget to take guide with you . We enjoyed alot and dont forget to cover all historic places near it
must see,ensure that you climb through the maze and to the top.. this is indeed the best part of this structure.. and so is the magnanimous story around Asaf ud Daula who built this
Fascinating!,"Do spend a lot of time here, definitely a place for history lovers.  The bhul bhulaiya does get crowded, but definitely worth it."
Very crowded on holidays and weekends,"The ticket queues were very long. So I got tickets from inside the Imambara (where you’d go to discuss with guides). Since I was there on a holiday, the guides were few. We had to join a big group. Inside the labyrinth walls it had become very crowded (not suffocating). If you are claustrophobic, it is going to be a challenge. The place was dirty. One needs to take off shoes before entering the Imambara. My advice:1. Go during a working day (but I guess Monday the place is closed). 2. Carry an extra pair of socks. 3. Have the local photographer take the pictures - looks like they clean the photographs 😊4. Travel in a taxi.5. Get tickets - see if you can get tickets from inside the Imambara; it is less crowded. Do visit the bhoolabhulaiya. The bawli is ordinary but doesn’t take long to visit."
Nawabs Land,Historical Monument with Unique Roof . Unique Sound Effects in the Monument. Well maintained . Nice Light Effects in the Night
"A wonderful monument, must see in Lucknow","The Bada Imambada is an imposing structure with very elegantly designed walls and ceilings, built in the typical Mughal style of architecture.Fairly well maintained but the structure itself could do with some more care and renovation.You need to remove your shoes when entering the Imambada proper and even socks are not allowed. The services of a Guide is highly recommended, especially for the Bhool-Bhulaiya. The steps leading up to the upper balcony and the terrace are quite steep and hence the seniors may find climbing a little tough.The Shahi Bauli or the Royal Well is also an interesting place located within the premises. There is a baggage counter at the entrance and hence you need not worry about carrying your bags around the place."
History Of Nawab's Lucknow,We have visited Lucknow for it rich historical culture and to experience amazing hospitality. We took a visit to Bars Imambara with the curiosity of bhool bhulaiya inside but now most of the parts this monument is closed due to weekend structure over the period of time. But I must say this is an amazing peice of architecture. A must visit if you are in Lucknow. I will not recommend to take guide for this because there is only one path which is open and anyone can follow the crowd and take a nice look of the Imambara. There is no entry fees but for camera you have to pay Rs.25/- which is decent enough.A guide will charge up to Rs.200/- for taking you all around but I will recommend not to take guide. Reaching early morning or late evening will be beneficial for photography and Lucknow looks from the top of the Imambara.
Bhool Bhulaiya,Bhool Bhulaiya is the best part of the the property but remember that a guide with you nice architecture
Pit Stop visit,Good place to visit with family and pick into our heritage. Winter should be the most suitable time as you need to walk bare feet inside the wonderful architecture
Imambaras and the games played along the walls and the staircases and hideaways,"The stairs are steep, the mosques are beautiful, the view from above cannot be explained in words unless you watch it around  sometime before the moon lights up the night skies or the touch of pink and gold over the gathering clouds during early monsoon showers. The kings and the queens played hide and seek amidst the labyriths ....The history is passionate and something to watch out for"
Beautiful historical architecture...,This place is a must visit as the architecture is simply beautiful. Worth getting a guide to understand the history behind the build and visiting early in the day is beneficial as there are less tourists around. The grounds and surrounding areas could be better maintained as buildings are crumbling.
Iconic Landmark! Deserves Better Maintenence!,"Bada Imambara has an impressive architectural style built by the erstwhile Nawabs. The main entrance leads to the open area with great views of the main structure and the adjoining mosque. You are required to remove your shoes before you enter and there is a paid shoe keeping counter outside in the courtyard. Although the charges are Rs 2 per pair as per the ticket issued, we were charged Rs 10. Also, the monument deserves better upkeep. You can not let your history rot like this guys!"
Heritage site ,Extremely crowded place especially on Fridays. Could be definitely better maintained. The building was made by Nawab Asafudullah in the 18th century as a relief project during a famine.Has a large pillarless hall. The walls are architecturally hollow and give an impression of a maze. A separate ticket is needed to enter it.A large mosque is built adjoining itThere is an attractive sttepwell on the side. The toilets are dirtyThe Rumi Darwaza is worth seeing. It looks three storyed from one side and one storyed from the other side.
Marvellous architecture,I visited this place at 7:30 in the morning and I think thats the best time to go as there will be very few people.it was very peaceful and chilly. I had the read the history before visiting this place so it was like time travel experience for me. Bhoolbhulayya is an awesome place. it is the underground maze with amazing acoustics. I recommend to always go with a guide or you will not be able to find your way out.
Great story and Architecture,You would hardly see such magnificent piece of history and architecture in such good condition. Apart from aesthetics what’s truly interesting is the story behind the Bara Imambara - benevolent Nawab really caring for its subjects.
Many steps,This is part of a large Islamic site in Lucknow.  An example of Mughal architecture it is amazing that in the late 1700's they were able to construct the large hall without any pillars.
Very nice monument,"we went there with the car+driver+guide and did ""Heritage corrider"" tour and saw the monument. We took lots of photos and there were many  people there."
A must visit in Lucknow,"It's an architectural master piece. A huge building constructed by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula in 1784. It houses one of the largest pillar less hall in the world.The acoustic engineering is absolutely ingenious. One can experience ""Deewaron ke bhi kaan hote hai"" (the walls have ears) and paper crumbled from 160 feet.Bhoolbhulaiya and Bauli are a must visit with a guide."
Tedious,it is built in vast area. moghal architecture. inside you have BULBULAIYA. climbing the steps is difficult if you are aged. lot of steps at every place. you tend to forget the way out. old well doez not have water but you could see your shadow from top. marvellous architecture though if is of no use today.Nearby you have Rumi Gate. from one side it looks moghul architecture and from the reverse it is indian. good to look around.
Awesome experience,Bara Imambara is one of the best tourist attractions in Lucknow. My experience in Bhoolbhulaiya was awesome. Guide is mandatory if you want to visit Bhoolbhulaiya.
Great architecture,A great architecture and class thing. Great thinking of then Nawabs n Kings who made it where any one can get lost easily if we are not accompanied by a guide. Lovely to see place from where kings mens could watch d enemies and enemies could not see them. Lovely work of architecture. Must visit for anyone visiting Lucknow.
Worth a visit,This is definitely worth a visit.  The rooms were really lovely and our guide gave us interesting details about it.
Must see if you're in Lucknow ,A must visit heritage place in Lucknow. Well maintained . You will remember this huge establishment  forever.
Visit for the Labyrinth,"Its a huge structure, not advisable for week knees, old citizens.One can always choose to just relax in the gardens.But The adventurous kinds must attempt to climb up and walk through the bhool bhulaiyya( a maze of walkways)"
It’s a very rich historical,It’s a very rich historical place but drawback is that you have to take your shoes off and go but it’s not all that clean.They need to maintain the building and the cleanliness a lot of scope for improvement especially with the historical information too should be provided on boards as well so that it’s not only that one has to go via a guide and just his knowledge
A must when in Lucknow,You can easily spend half a day here as the artichectur and thr sheer size is phenomenal. Get combined ticket that enables you t entre all three venues.
Heritage not so well preserved...,"Wonderful place...Right from its size, Architecture,layout..This place is so well planned and exudes history with each breath..U get to spend some time and experience the expertise of the architects of the bygone era.. but the property could have been and should have been even better preserved than it is now.. Nevertheless it's a must visit.. spend some time in the bhool bhulaiya and lose yourself in its labyrinthine passages.. or experience the amazing physics of the bawli..Or just sit in the shadows of the robust mosque.. the place is preserved by the ASI and guide is a must in case of bhool bhulaiya..Prices are pretty reasonable and you can purchase a single ticket for all the monuments like Chhota Imambara, residency.etc."
The first thing to see in Lucknow,"The first thing to see in Lucknow!Stunning gardens, labyrinth halls and mosques inside. Take a guided tour as the stories behind this are wonderful.500 Rupees to enter and you should leave your feedback in the book as you exit.A must see and just next to Roomi gate."
Worth a visit,"The grandest of grand! An impressive compound that highlights the power of the Nawabs of the time. The beautiful gateway ushers you in to an open space where there is gardens and then to the left a gorgeous masjid. We didn't pay for the tour inside the labrynth, was turned off by the crowd, however we were here on a public holiday. Go later in the day to see the colours of the orange brick change for some wonderful photos.If you're a Westerner though be prepared to be asked, unfortunately often rudely, for loads of photos of you."
great place,this is the main attraction of lucknow. this place is very well maintained.the famous bhul bhulaiya is inside this bara imambara. it is better to take guide to enjoy this place. guide will charge around 100 to 150 rs per head.
Nice Place,"In a place otherwise, benefit of attraction the Bra Imambara, is a worth a visit. Large and roomy it has aspects of interest like the Bhool-Bhullayya."
"A piece history - that ""mazes' you!",Bhool Bhulaiya is a must do - both for its architectural splendor and to get a feel of the slice of history that it represents. The Baoli next door is also worth a visit.
Explore the Gradeur,"For every traveler may it be business or may it be leisure, they should not miss this grand edifice in Lucknow which houses a Grand Mosque, Labyrinth, Hamam (Royal Bath) along with the Grave of the Nabab of Lucknow."
What an engineering delight,This place is what a Lucknow visit is all about. Very well maintained property and what an engineering marvel. With architects from Iran built in those days can beat modern engineering any day . Bhul bhulaiya is another gem in the place.
Famous architect by Nawab Asaf-Ud-Daula!,"The city of Nawabs, Asaf-ud- Daula and Wazid Ali Shah left us mesmerised by the history created in their trail in the form of Rumi Gate, Chhota Imam Bara, Bara Imambara. The central building in the Bara Imambara complex is an architectural wonder with its High ceilings looming large on the long halls without any support of pillars and iron rods.....and that have given birth to the famous labyrinth we all loving know as bhulbhulaiya. To lessen the weight of the building the side walls had to be hollowed so that the building didn't collapse and thus the labyrinth was born This was conceived of by an architect by the name of Kifayatullah . While we toured the narrow pathways of the labyrinth , which sometimes make you travel up the stairs leading to a way out downstairs!!! In the labyrinth the air seemed to be whispering stories from history, centuries back."
Architectural beauties,"Visit to Chhota Imambara and Bada Imambara is must in a trip to Lucknow. Architectural beauties. Both were built without using any steel or cement. Bada Imambara also houses Bhul Bualaiya having a number of stair cases, each one set of 4 stair cases, only one being right."
It's a good place,It worth invest some time to go there as it is beautiful and historical site. Lot of people surrounding the place but you can do it with no problem at all.
Bara Imambara - private guided tour,We hired a private guide. He was well informed and knew his way around. I’m glad we did this because we learned a lot of really interesting facts about the architecture and history of the site.
stunning view,It's one of the prides of Lucknow....a beautiful work of art by the Mughals. Goes with the tradition and culture of the city of nawabs and kebabs....it deserves more publicity than it gets....in fact all the old structure of lucknow need to be publicized to highlight the city's uniqueness.
Fascinating,"This one is an architectural wonder. A must visit. Friday it is closed. One must have guides. Couples have to take guides. However, they are govt approved and they don't swindle money from you. Keep at least two hours to enjoy every nook and corner of it. Keep sunset time here."
Visit to Bara imambara.,Basically it is a tomb.actually visited on 29th of October. It reflects navabi old culture. Is is 1+ 2 story structure. Ground floor has rooms of three jihadee members of then navab.then there is bhulbhulaiya where we really lost our way. View from 2nd floor was lovely.we could see sky line of Lucknow from there. Sanctity of the place is well mai trained It is kept very clean.
Reflection of Rich culture amd heritage,Its a reflection of rich culture and heritage of lucknow... Vast gardens and architectural beauty.... You will love this place............
History going to waste,"The place has so much history but is going to ruin. The bauli is a deep step well, the labyrinth has such history, but the guides know basic facts and dont elaborate"
Wonderful architecture,The BARA IMAMBARA (big place where priest reside) was built on the bank of Gomtinagar in Lucknow by the Oudh king Asaf ud daulaThe local Nawab was famous for his charity and as per old saying this big Imambara was constructed in around 1784 to help the citizens in period of famine.The construction is unique and the big hall has been constucted without any pillar and made up of LAKHAURI bricks .The BHULBHULIYA above the halls is beautiful .The guide challenge that you can not find your way once you are lost in it.The windows in Bhulbhuliya gives a panromic view of the entire entrances and were also used for security.A big mosque and an old BAOLI(water collection system) is another attraction.The place has nominal entrance and always visit the IMAMBARA with a local guide. The guide are using very sweet language and talks in a enjoyable style.An unforgettable place.
Very nice historical place ,I have visited ti imam bada its wonderful. Haired one guide he explained about each and everything ..
Nice and historic place,I am visited many time in every month when I am free with my friends. It is one of the best place in lucknow.
Lucknow - City of Tehzeeb,A great place to get an insight to rich cultural heritage of LucknowOne should not miss out on Bhool-bhulaiya (whispering gallery)
Memrable n historical place,This is great place of lucknow to know about our nawabs and great arckitecture of old time .this is very unblieable how they made without any machineries in those days .such a nice place to enjoy with family
Most popular site in Lucknow,This place is one of the most popular sites of Lucknow and is quite crowded. You will be accosted by several so called guides but avoid going for shopping with them. It always better to be there around dusk time as after sunset this place is closed and is beautifully illuminated.
Must see Heritage Building,Very impressive Heritage building Amazing enormous hall constructed without steel and cement Bhul Bhulaiyan is a must see and unique construction Need a good guide to experience the facets of this remarkable building
A must visit if you are first time in Lucknow ,"As the history demands, special attractions are to be visited specially. Bara imambara is all about nawabi aesthetics and the labyrinth popularly known as bhulbhulaiya.It's takes about 2 hrs to complete sight seeing including bauli and masjid.The place is well maintained and you need to have a professional guide once inside."
Excellent place that should visit in Lucknow...!,Here you can enjoy Bhul Bhulaiya and Bawri. Maintenance is not done regularly by concerned department.
Great place ,The place was superb most go with friend and click photo when I was visit the place have many historical arnomant this is the great moment see it go with friends and share photos the place have many things to see must visit
Past Glory,"If thid spot us given facelift, this can become one of the best tourist spot un Lucknow, UP & India. Good no of heritage building in good condition. Very happy to see.Similar spot is there in KL, Malaysia."
Lucknow’s major Attractions ,"Bara Imambara happens to be the most obvious 1st choice but only amongst domestic tourists. I hardly saw any foreign tourist there. It Campuses famous Bhul Bhulaiya (Labrynth).Full of Guides who will charge more and insist to provide services only in large groups while charging amounts equal to the group size of each small family / friends groups. Couples for discipline purposes as a rule are required to hire Guides, compulsorily.Entering Bhul Bhulaiya was no more a fun as Guides will only take through the right path (1 out of 124) and take you out in 15-20 minutes with some insights and explaining the acoustics of the main sacred hall (Imambara) .... eg. sound of igniting match sticks can be clearly heard from any corner inside the main sacred hall. Other attractions inside include the Sacred Bawli (Well). Other tourists places close to this are Rumi Darwaza and Chota Imambara."
Wonderful,This place is so beautiful.we went there with family and enjoyed a lot.very big place to visit.this is old historical site . government have to look after this place.highly recommend
Must see,This is splendid....must hire guide service's ...the local rickshaws driver's ..will take u there . .Buy one ticket.. covers all the heritage spots.  Chota imabara... picture gallery..Do click  a photo..by the photographers outside.  Will take two hours to see the place.  Wear comfy shoes...caps and carry water ....very hot ...lots of stairs...to climb....
Poor maintenance,No signage or history briefs which can make it  a better DIY rather they make you totally depend on local guides
Historical place,"Very nice place must visitHere u found bhool bhoolaiyaa, baawdi and beautiful masjid.It very beautiful place"
Historic place,As it is a historic place so you must go there the environment here is good . It is one of the famous monuments in lucknow
"""Great Historic Monument""","It's definitely one of the highlights of our visit to Lucknow.. Even though it was raining, we still enjoyed walking through the monument. It's clean and maintained well. The guide was useful and gave us enough information to make it interesting. There's lot of walking up and down the steps. Some parts are narrow and dark so might be little challenging for kid's and elderly. But definitely a must visit.."
Mughal period,"Every thing is fine here. But the thing that irritate me is when you visit the mosque on the right side of imambara you see a poster where it is written ""the non NAMAZI are not allowed in the the mosque"". Indirectly they means to say that only MUSLIMS are allowed here.      If you visit temple, church etc you will never find this type of poster like only hindu's or Christian's are allowed here. IS THIS EQUALITY THAT WE ARE TALKING EVERY DAY?"
One of the site you must visit,"It would be a really good idea to take the guides on tour here, since the stories that they narrate makes the visit worth it."
Journey to nawabi era ,Revisit the nawabi era of Lucknow by visiting the place. Good place to go along with your family. Bhul bhulaiya inside the building is an interesting thing to visit
Worthwhile with a good guide,"A Shia mausoleum which is also architecturally very interesting. Highly recommend that you are choosy about your guide. Promise the guide a few extra Rs. to ensure that extra attention to detail. Don’t miss the match-stick trick at the top of the tomb. The bhool bhulaiyya will keep the kids engaged. Not very sure if the “deewaron ke bhi kaan hote hain” originates here, but you definitely can hear the whispers and follow them. A lovely view from the top of the tomb, even though older people may find it a bit of a climb. The Baoli has some interesting facets to it, especially the reflection of the entrance from the very interior. Be ready to spend at least an hour and a half to a couple of hours here."
Historical place,Nice architectural building in old Lucknow. Its a beautiful place and a remembrance of the Awadh culture of the city. I had taken the services of the guide who explained the history very well.
Good place,It was so beautiful which makes me to stay there for a lot of time and having great to be part of it and have great views there
A marvel piece of architecture,Its an awesome piece of architecture in Lucknow. Its made in such a way based on the concept of reflection that from inside you can see whats there outside but from outside the inside preview is not visible. It was made during Nawab period with a view that it will be used during wars with britishers
A morning walk at Imambara,"We went to bara Imambara on one Sunday morning, so that there will be no rush and will be able to enjoy the grand monument. It was indeed very good."
Historical,well if you have spare time in lucknow i suggest you visit the bada imambara for your dose of history...take a guided tour and you wont be disappointed...when i visited it was not very crowded hence we enjoyed this visit a lot...it is a beauty of mughal architecture...
Another Temple ,"Hot, dirty and in a sad state of disrepair. The main temple is closed to tourist's  and unfortunately what could be a great tourist attraction offers little to the visitor"
Very good cultural heritage structure,One cannot leave Lucknow without visiting this heritage structure. Wonderful construction. Every bit of it is interesting and need lot of energy to go around.
A must visit in Lucknow,"A must visit place in Lucknow.A wonderful place. Take a guided tour of bhool bhulaiha.The weather was awesome when we were there yesterday.Thanks,Ravi"
Bara imambara,Beautiful structures and complex.ezcellent construction and craftsmanship.The labyrinth is really tricky and adventurous.The top of bara imambara offers excellent view of the city.
Great Creation,This is the one place for which Lucknow is famous. you will see a great creation in lucknow. It is also known for bhul-bhulaiya. must go and visit this place.
Historical Monument showcasing the Shia Islamic Culture,Prior to travelling to Lucknow were were only guessing what Bada Imamara will be aboutOur visit to Bada Imamara opened us to the Shia culture in the city. The guide was excellent and we had a fun filled time navigating the Bhool Bhulaiya
Historical place of Lucknow,This is one of the must see places of the city Lucknow. very attractive for its built and location. Large nos of tourist comes here for its names.
Historically Important Monument,Baradhan Imambara also known as Asafi Imambara. Very prominent land mark in the city. Built by Awadh Nawab Asafud Doulah in 1784. It has WORLD’S LARGEST ARCHED HALL WITHOUT PILLARS. One of the architectural wonders of that time. It has got the mysterious maze called Bhul Bhulaiya on the top floor which creates a puzzle with an array of interconnected passages and balconies. Visitors MUST venture inside only with authorised guides.
Love this place,"I am from Lucknow and this place is really close to my heart. Whenever I want peace I always end up here sitting on the roof top alone or sometimes just like to get lost in the bhool bhulaiya.This place us Must visit if you are someone who love heritage, art and culture or just someone like me looking for some ""me"" time."
CITY OF NAWABS ,This place is awesome and architecture is very inovative..Very beautiful place must visit but the staff is not very good these peoples are too rude but believe me this place is historic and we can go back in history....
Land of Nawabs,Visited Bara Imambara after a long long time.....govt has done well to maintain this historic monument but public has left no stones unturned to litter the place and scratch their love stories in stones all over. Bhool Bulaiyan is a must visit but with a guide.
A must visit place of Lucknow,"Bara Imambara is a must visit place for any visitor of Lucknow, the seat of Nawabs. It is a huge area with mosques and other constructions. The place is full of artistic motifs and architectural splendor. It attracts thousands of visitors every day."
Artistic - best place to visit in Lucknow,"Bara means big, and Imambara is a sacred hall. The building includes a mosque - Asfi mosque, the labyrinth - known as bhul-bhulaiya, and bowli, a step well with running water. Two grand gateways welcome the visitors and it leads us to the main building. It is said that there are 1024 ways to reach the terrace but only one to come back. Construction of Bara Imambara was made during famine, and one of the objectives in performing this activity was to provide employment for people in the region. The main complex has a roof has no beams supporting the ceiling and is one of the largest such arched constructions in the world. This part of the building, and often the whole complex, may be referred to as the Bhulbhulaya. The place has 2 people buried inside - the one of the sponsor and the other that of the architect of the building. Our car driver doubled up as guide as well for this place. We spent around 1 hour inside. It was too hot and sultry inside. Entry fee was Rs.25 per person for the main building. Combined ticket for all entries for Labyrinth, Bowli is Rs.50."
Tourist scam,Nice place to visit. Though the scam being run by tourist guide is deplorable. Visit only if you have nothing else to do. Instead enjoy the food at various places. Place would be much better if there were no tour guides and they just had info written on boards!
Must visit place in Lucknow for the history lovers,This place is a Must visit place in Lucknow for the history lovers. The parking is not a problem. The architecture is beautiful. The shooting of Gadar movie also an attraction here.
Pride of Lucknow,This iconic place know as Bada Imamabada is pride of Lucknow.One is compelled to soak into the scientific details in which this amazing place is built . So much of histroy and mystery behind it makes it a must visit place in Lucknow.
Must visit in Lucknow,This is not just a building but this place is  proud for Lucknow as concerned to architecture and history. One can find many wow factors when visiting to this place. Bhul Bhulaiya and bouli is a must to see.
For History Buffs,"This place is huge! And a treasure trove for those with a fascination for historical places and a love to explore. There are tunnels rumoured to reach Delhi, and Agra, which are closed now (for obvious reasons). We see original examples of lucknawi craftsmanship, and there are interesting architectural features, especially in the attached bowli."
One must visit,"HiOne must visit this place If you visit to Lucknow than one must visit this place and guide was very good to explain in details about the place and told about its history and how this was built.In this one area is bhul buleya which is something special. In that whenever you want to go out than there are four ways and three are wrong and one is correct. If you go in wrong place than you move there only and cant come out from this place.Further once you see from inside window you can see more than 100 meter outside which vehicle or person is moving on road, which they used to know about if any person is coming from there and outside person will not know whether any onr is seeing him. And on the same line if you lighting the match stick it can been heard other side. Hindi me kahavat he ""Deewaro ke bhi kaan hote he""Good place and when you go to Bawri and you go almost 50 stair case down and from the water level you can see who is on road. Beautiful artitech and place is also neat and clean.Overall good experiance to us."
Good location ,Imambara very good and i am very enjoy this place I love Lucknow and food is a very good and all I will come to next time
Another historic place,"Another historic building in Lucknow ,Not very well managed by staff.Approach is not very good ....."
A place design with intelligence and grace,"If you are in Lucknow for a day or so, make sure that you visit this palace- Imambara. It is not that huge but if you hire a guide, he will make sure that you get interested in those broken walls and amazing architecture in one go. Try not to go on a weekend as this place will look like a mess to you, people are so much in a hurry that they forget to listen to the stories and in order to see the place with peace become impossible. You have to form lines to watch the creative work and enjoy the palace, so try to visit this place on a weekday. Do not forget to hire a guide there and ask him as many questions you can ask. There is a beautiful story behind every wall that is building and the intelligence behind building these walls are so great. Enjoy the stories and make sure you DO NOT LITTER around this place. Keep it clean and beautiful."
Nice place,It has a Bhool Bhulaiya it has a ground and flowers and trees for the photoshoot tickets prices so high
"Being Tourist Channel Review - Labyrinth ""Bhool Bhulaya"" a must visit place","Fantastic architecture of Imambara. I have shared the history of this imambada in my video ""Being Tourist channel "".The first floor of Imambada is Labyrinth which unique in India and many would need guide to have tour of it. It will take 1-2 hour to have complete tour of it. There is small bauli close to imambada which one should visit."
Historical place treat for Mughal architecture lovers,"Was backpacking Lucknow for a week and this was one of the places that people asked me to visit , it has traits of great history and tradition and would be a great destination to visit while you are in lucknow."
Stunning,This really is a must see attraction. Spent an hour here on a hot June afternoon. The architecture and the gardens are stunning.  Wonderful views.
Lucknawi culture and heritage at it's best!,"The most beautiful testament to Lucknow's rich culture and heritage, Bara Imambara is a huge complex encompassing three major segments. Each of them has their own beauty and charm and is worth a visit for sure. So it is recommended that you take the combined ticket that costs Rs. 50 per person for Indians and includes Bhul bhulaiya, Baoli, Shahi Mosque and Picture Gallery (located a little far and outside the complex)Bhool bhulaiya: One of the best mazes I've ever come across, this is the highlight of the Bara Imambara complex. The journey is best enjoyed with a guide here. They'll lead you across the entire complex deftly and then when you come to a resting point, they'll leave you to come out by yourself. The adventure that ensues is simply amazing and totally worth a try for sure.Aasifi Mosque: Historical monument built in the 18th century stands as a testimony to the Awadh rule here and is a breathtaking place of prayer. The Friday namaz here is definitely worth a visit. Beautiful architecture and craftsmanship indeed.Baoli: Not as impressive as other Baolis in India like Agrasen ki Baoli (Delhi) or Adalaj ni Vav (Ahmedabad). But very clean and well maintained. CCTV camera surveillance over the entire area, drinking water spout and small shop to buy eatables and cold drinks. Worth one visit for sure when you're already in the Bara Imambara."
Awe inspiring maze,What is more famous about this architecture if the Bhul Bhulaiya or LABRYRINTH (maze) above the Imambara. It would require a sharp observing brain to understand the pattern of how it has been built and come out of the maze.
CCTV of a bygone era,It is a massive structure with a architecture that allures and mystique that can only be experienced
Enigmatic,"All the structures in the premises are grand.The main building is full of mysterious architectures.There is a big hall about 100 meter long with no supporting pillars in between. The maze, the secret of 'Bouli' building and lot more. Explore yourself to get the excitement."
Marvellous,The Bara Imambara (or the big Imambara) is a must visit place for tourists in Lucknow. The design and the architecture is gorgeous.
One of the best experience for the explorers ones and adults too.,An old monument in lucknow resembling its history and culture.Here are basically 3 gates at every end and only one will lead you to destiny while wrong ones would make you let go lost inside it.BEWARE OF TRAFFIC JAM DURING RUSH HOURS(evening time)
Beautiful place with heritage style mosque kind of a thing,been to Bara Imambara twice very picturesque place when ever we visit lucknow always prefer to go there
Lucknow's pride,"I have visited many historical sights in the nation. This place is grand and beautiful. It showcases the entire architecture pattern of that era. It must be visited along with Roomi Darwaza, chota imamabada and other historical.monuments nearby. It was a Sunday and whole lucknow poured in inspite of hot humid weather. The place is very il organised, needs renovation and restoration at many places. I request visitors not to spoil the walls and litter in the gardens. There is a requirement of water arrangements in the complex. The water bottles are sold with higher prices. If you are going with very small children avoid going to Bhool bhulaiya (Lybrenth) avoid it. It's humid and too small. Must Carry water with you. Guide system is corrupted and needs supervision."
Ancient heritage losing its charm in time,"This imambara is a proud heritage of Lucknow city and one of the important places visited by tourists throughout the year.However, this majestic monument finds itself in despair with the walls spoilt by ignorant people scratching their names and other bad stuff on it. There are couple of places where you can see the stones and mud breaking and falling especially on top of this monument. Renovation and/or maintenance is of urgent priority and the tourists visiting there must need to understand the importance of this heritage and help protect it. There are lots of guides available for services ranging from Rs. 100-200 which would be useful especially if you are visiting for the first time. One should surely visit and know the history and architecture of this grand heritage when visiting Lucknow."
Decent place ,Not so much of history behind it but its fun to visit once. Couple needs a guide. Else other can go get lost in this bhool bhuliyaa😂😂
Imambara,"Bara Imambara is one of the most architecturally beautiful, ancient monument in Lucknow. If you are coming to Lucknow then you should definitely visit this beauty."
Nicely built,"I consider Bara Imambara to be the main attraction of Lucknow. Hiring guide here is must, otherwise you will not enjoy the beauty of this monument. Bhul Bhuliya is a wonderful place to visit in it."
complex of multiple buildings to enjoy,"This is the main attraction of Lucknow and there are multiple buildings to tour alongwith enjoying lassi at chowk and chikan garments making/selling. The Bara imambara itself is a maze of attractions, having the giant halls (3), Baoli (stepwell) complex and the bhool bhulaiya (maze), each of them a masterpiece in itself. the central hall is 50mx16m and without any pillar support, unique in the world.Baoli was dry when we went, but still architecturally there are so many things to see esp. the water mirror from inside which gives a person view of the gate without the person at gate realizing that he can be watched without getting seen. just try to avoid the hot summers, else wont be able to enjoy. Better take a guide to understand the nuances of architecture, else there is no fun in visiting - the guides have standard rates and are available at the main building entrance.Outside of this complex is the Rumi darwaza, ghantaghar and some other structures, which you can take a electric auto and the driver will explain.."
City's heritage,Bara imambara is the monumental structure in the city with an amazing history. It is located towards the old city and must visit for the tourists.
Lovely architecture,Must visit place for Lucknowites and people falling for this city of nawabs ! What a pleasure it was to see this historical piece of work.
Bhulbhuliya  Main Attraction,"Main Attraction of Lucknow having historical relevance .Better to have a guide , otherwise could be confused .Bhulbhulaiya  is interesting to go"
Picnic ,It is good place for celebration of enjoyment. We have come here for enjoyinf family picnic with friends.Here all the food and refreshments are available at resonable price
Very old historical buildings ,Entrance is very huge. If you love to visit historical monument must visit but not in summer. You need to walk long.
Awesome Heritage Place,"If you are in Lucknow, you have to cover Bara Imambara in your itinerary. Hire a guide to help you understand the importance of this monument."
Tourist attraction,It is a tourist attraction and very famous in Lucknow. The structure is of Mughal Empire and looks very magnificent even after so many years.
Must visit in the city of nawabs,"This is a must see place in lucknow. Historic monument with great architecture. It has one of india's largest labrynth, which is open to public though some its entry points have been closed. You can also hire a guide who can tell you a bit more about this place."
Massive,"What's goodIt's so gigantic, it should be called Bahut Bada Imambara, the crown jewel being the bhoolbhulaiya.What's not goodNot very organized, the steep stairs are dangerous.What to doTake a guide with you to the bhoolbhulaiya. Step well is also awesome."
a royal heritage,"do go tot the place if you are interested to visit ancient places, you will find peace as soon as you enter the place, so relaxing it is. I would love to visit this place when I go back to the city."
Bara Imamb,"It is a place of historical, royal and cultural values. I always wanted to visit this place. Luckily, it happened because of my brother wedding and so a short trip of wedding cum tour executed.I would like to share some of the historical places to visit in Lucknow.1)Bara Imambara Bara Imambara is in the centre of the city and a Lucknow visit is incomplete without this place."
"Holy place for ""Shiya Muslim""","This building is mainly for Muslims. Mainly shiya Muslims to visit this place where a Muslim saint to narrate the famous ""Karbala Tragedy"". They often visit this place during day time as this place also have a mosque. It also has a labyrinth. This building has no column support in between where as it has a huge hall for people to sit and pray."
A must see place ,"I was on a one night two day trip to Lucknow for a conference and a must to this place was a absolute mustInspite of conflicting information regarding the time it opened (varying from 9-10am) I trusted my instincts and set off early morning to reach by 8am and I am so glad as I managed to enter early (amongst the first ) got a guide and was able to see the whole complex and the labyrinth and Baoli in a relaxed manner without jostling of crowds and avoiding the heatThe place is enormous and has beautiful landscapes areas The three halls (central ,Chinese and Indian ones)are huge with structures reminding one of Istanbul’s Sofia Haque and blue mosqueThe ceilings are unique and centrally unsupported by columns making it a engineering marvel ( The walls and the labyrinthine above play a role)The acoustics are phenomenal and the slightest sound(even of a match being lit) can be heard across the hallThe halls are engineered in such a way that from above passages of the labyrinthine one can see right across to the entrance unseen from thereOne has to remove shows /footwear before enteringThe guides are friendly and charge around 150-200 The key especially in summer is try to reach early The common ticket of 50/- includes labyrinthine,Bouli,and Museum and Chota Imambara which is at a distance One needs around 1-2 hours for this place"
Very good place,A very good historical place to visit. Do a guide and then enter. It will be very good. A bawli was also there.
Worth Visiting.,It is a clean good place to visit. there is an entry ticket to the place. It would be better to take guide and dont pay him beyond Rs. 200/- They will tell the tales which you would definitely enjoy. The place has a well maintained Garden.

Best,It's a great place to visit when visiting the capital of Awadh. It showcases the history of Lucknow.
Wonderful Monument,"Regal place with very thoughtful, well designed architecture. Its advisable to have a guide, who can tell you subtle nuances of architecture. Well organized and repository of many appreciable artifacts. Grand and unique architecture is hallmark in Lucknow.  Must visit!!"
Lucknow’s royal legacy ,"Just recently I got a chance to visit the most unique and breathtaking Lucknow’s historic landmark known as Bara Imambara, which means big holy place where people gather to pray and share their religion. Bara Imambara is not only a prayer place for may people but now also one of the most visited architecture in Lucknow, it also has the only labyrinth(Bhul Bhulaiya) in the country. The construction of both the monuments are just remarkable and very well thought, they have made it so strategically that the light and wind passes through the whole Imambara perfectly and you need no other source of light or wind. They have maintained it really well, you’ll get all sorts of facilities over there like water snacks and where to take off your footwear. They have carpets all around to make it easier for people to walk even if it’s hot, I would highly recommend taking a guide from there itself as they tell you the whole history of the place and main stories behind the monument and what exactly was the purpose of everything it consists of. I would recommend going to this place either early morning or during the sunset to enjoy the best views and less crowd. Do cover the whole of the monument from the terrace to the ground and inside area and if you have time do cover the small Imambara as well. You should really visit this place when in Lucknow, highly recommended in winters."
