Amazing place!! ,"The place was just beyond my expectations. Amazing aquarium, really awesome. Insane roller-coaster and the lights and fireworks show at the end is great. Food buffets are good."
Loads of Fun,"Met my match here - a terrifying roller coaster that has kept me on terra firma ever since. The kids couldn’t get enough of it though! Very impressive aquarium. Though we went during a holiday, we never felt that we were waiting too long for anything. Bring your own snacks!"
Better than HK Ocean Park and HK Disney combined!!,"We were quite surprised how big this place is...and how many sea animals it has!! Penguins, whale sharks, polar bears, wolves, seals, etc.The seal show was just ok but the dolphin show is a must see!!The rides are quite mixed for young and older kids....although ur child should at least be 1m high for him/her to be able to ride most of the rides...There are a lot of restaurants to choose from inside with a lot of food selection.Last thing, wait for the outdoor finale fireworks show at night...ITS A MUST SEE. You can also get english maps at their customer service area....They have a rental stroller service...toilets are clean and have international toilet bowls..All in all, kids will definitely enjoy there...we got the 2 day ticket to be able to finish everything...we suggest that!"
Great place for family,It was a shame that we only had a very limited time to visit this park. It was huge with lots of things and I wish that we could stay a whole day. It's a great place to visit for family and kids.
'Wonderful Day Outing',"Very entertaining amusement theme park, rare marine animals, lots of thrilling rides and spectacular shows.  Go early to avoid the hot sun and not during school holidays time to avoid the queue."
Quite a good park,"We went for my son’s 7th birthday, on a regular week day, which is the key for an enjoyable experience. Holiday and weekend would be a nightmare with the amount of people visiting. On a Wednesday, the most we had to wait at any ride was 5 minutes, with most rides less than 2 minutes. One day was enough, with a good ending at 8pm as they do their spectacle light-fire-air-water show over the main lake area. I was impressed with the quality! Also we were lucky as it was the first day of their Halloween festival so that was a bonus. Only down side is some of the animals seem like they should be taken care of better. Other than that, my family enjoyed the visit a lot."
Theme park and circus,A simple theme park with not much attraction. Do not compare it with Disneyland. However it is stil ok for my kids to have fun. Tried the motorcycle speed racing which is fun. There is no queue when I visit this theme park probably due to outside holiday season. Enjoy the circus in the evening right beside the theme park which is fun and entertaining
"Overpriced - admission, hotel. Not worthwhile at all.","There has been so much hype about the place. Went there to check out. Firstly weather yesterday was super hot. Admission fee also expensive CNY 450 per adult for ocean kingdom and CNY 550 for theatre. This is excluding hotel accommodation which is easily CNY 2000 and above. A day + night stay there with family will easily cost close to CNY 10K including food and transport, if you are to cover both ocean kingdom, theatre and lions gate! Not many can afford and I don’t think it’s worth the money."
Horrible,"After hearing so much about Chimelong we decided to go and check it out. There were many many problems. 1. The amount of people. We had to wait in line for hours just to go on a ride (regardless if it was small or big) and also for the animal exhibits. 2. The poor, poor animals. Those animals were living in concrete painted to look like its habitat rooms. No ice/snow for the arctic animals. All the animals were going crazy walking back and forth because their enclosures were tiny. Their nails were over grown and because of the concrete floors they had trouble walking. All animals looked malnourished. Just disgusting treatment for the beautiful creatures. 3. The park isn’t big. There aren’t a lot of rides for a price similar to a bigger amusement park like Ocean Park or Disney Land. If you want to have fun and not feel bad about the animals go to Hong Kong’s Disney Land or Ocean park. Worth the money and time. Chimelong is generating so much money, they just choose to not take care of their animals."
Chimelong Ocean Kingdom,"Beluga shows, dolphin shows, main aquariums, fireworks, etc. It's too much to watch all day.I think I can afford to watch it for two days.I think food is a bit expensive in amusement parks."
Reasonably Priced. Good attractions. Long Journey.,"Cheap food and souveniours comparing to other international theme park standards (which is a plus). Rides, attractions and performances are pretty ok. Customer service is good. However, recommended to go during colder seasons. In summer; too hot. There are a lot of people as well! Also getting to the place is not straight forward for a foreigner."
Happy time in Chimelong Ocean Kingdom ,"If you have this opportunity definitely should visit this park! Our family did not visit different attractions in park , because we are not interested, so I will not say anything about it. With you can take only water. Don't bring food. Inside very beautiful, a big pleasure to see all this  different and such amazing animals! All day we just walk around , enjoy big aquarium couples of times , performance, big parade. Of course it is a lot of people,but it's ok. In the end of the day a huge performance on the water with lightshow and fireworks. So do not go away early )"
Great Place one must Visit,It is amazing experience to see the Ocen Kingom and the rides are very exciting and the water ride was among the best. Of course the parrot ride is the most exciting heart holding and it challenging. l
Beautiful park for a day,"After a tip from my Chinese colleague I decided to go for a day trip to this park. A day trip because it is rather expensive (380RMB submission ticket). Although, it is a beautiful place with nice shows and a lot of different animals."
They have the largest aquarium in the world,"The Chimelong group is trying to build the area to be the “ Orlando of the East”.  The facilities are newly build and big.  The aquarium is very attractive.  The performances are also well designed.  The problem is the management is not as good as the one in the other countries, including the services staff they do need lots of training. Besides, Road signs are not sufficient, you can easily lost your way."
A small combined version of HK Disney and Ocean Park ,"Mostly Hong Kong and mainland Chinese tourists. It has a few elements of both HK Disneyland and Ocean Park: the Iconic seals, dolphins and white whale show, birds park, cartoon village, thrill rides for different ages... But the water flying man show and the night parade are the best. Ticket is a bit expensive and audience needs to purchase separate tickets for night circus."
Great for families,"Chimelong Ocean Kingdom has many attractions ranging from aquariums to performances to rollercoasters, which suit a wide variety of ages, making it an ideal destination for a family trip.The performances attract large crowds, so be sure to arrive around 10 minutes in advance if you want to grab good seats. The staff will let you in if you are a few minutes late, but you will likely have to stand.Food and beverage inside the park is priced reasonably for a theme park, and the disparity between pricing inside the park and outside the park is considerably smaller than that in other theme parks (Disneyland, Universal Studios etc).Overall the park is clean and hygienic."
Ocean Kingdom - Chimelong,"Chimelong has a great brand for Chinese Theme Park, and this ocean kingdom bring the company into a new level. Anything is a great here, and i have a great lunch restaurant with direct view to see the whales, I have heard there are one in okinawa and here has four, i guess that are smaller but still impressive. Imagine, you are eating fish and chip and seeing the whale looking at you. The location is also very near Macau and you shall consider reserve a day hear if you are visiting Macau"
Had a great time ,"Being from Hong Kong, this park to me was a crossover between the Hong Kong Ocean Park and the Disney Land. There were lovely sea animals and big musical parades that the young kids loved, and there were also some pretty freaky rides for the grown ups. I liked how the place is spacious and all the line ups weren’t very long (by Chinese standards anyway) (we visited a week before the Easter weekend)."
Poor living conditions for the animals,"Despite the large variety of animals and the top-notch performances, certain animals definitely deserve a better living condition. In partucular, the penguin exhibit is way too overcrowded! I don’t think the penguin actually have enough space to swim. Arctic foxes are kept in a small and bright room with barely any space to hide. The polar bears are clearly distressed and pace back and forth in agony. Besides that, many of the other tanks and aquariums are also overcrowded. Yet, the park does a great effort advocating animal conservation and provide useful information in educating the public. The animal collection is definitely amazing but their standard of living should be improved."
Family Visit,"Ticket pricing is very light on wallet  comparing to the likes of other team park (Disney or Universal Studio). Toilets are clean, amenities are new. We did not try all rides as it will take more than a day trip. Park with plenty of shows, whale, peguins or sea lion. Spectacular huge aquarium and very informative with plenty of fishes or marine life species. Kids age ranging 8-12 will enjoy it emmensely. Food pricing are expected on par with the rest of the teampark. But not bad with lots of choices. No water dispenser for public but vending or stall are easily around however WeChat pay is widely used. You may have hiccup if you use cash but non speaking Mandarin or Chinese. Crew are generally non English speaking.You can spend a whole day if you wish to unravel the park intensively. They also have night program unfortunately we lacking of time. Suggest to spend a night at the theme park hotel to fully enjoy the park."
good for family,"beautiful lobby, beautiful room and the buffet breakfast was good.fast check in and express check out"
too expensive,"qa good place, however no one can speak my language, I go therte alone, big and will spend you a whole day there, anyway, it is a good place"
"Well maintained, good mix of attractions, a taste of real China",The park is well maintained and is very good for young children (although teenagers and adults will enjoy it too). There is a good mix of attractions and things to see and do. The park is clearly geared towards domestic visitors but otherwise signage in English is very good (better than Narita airport...) so getting things done is not an issue. The aquarium is fantastic although the path inside it is designed to move a lot of people fast through it. There are animal shows and ones at display and their condition is generally good. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Southern China.
Came here to see the whale sharks,"As we wanted to see the whale sharks, we had a short trip to the Chimelong Ocean Park. We took a taxi from our hotel and arrived there in less than an hour. The park is smaller than the Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou which we visited on a previous trip. However, the whale sharks were amazing and the tank with thousands of jelly fish looked out of this world. There were also a few rides but we did not tried them all. We also enjoyed the artic section as we could see the arctic wolves and foxes so close but the polar bears did not looked very happy. The dolphin show was also one of the best we have seen as there were about eight dolphins. We could also see the rare pink dolphin which lives in the southern Chinese sea."
Fun for all ages,I cannot rave enough about how amazing this experience was. I really did not know what to expect. The rides are very fun. There’s a number to wet rides so they sell those plastic rain coats for 15 rmb each. This plastic rain coat was actually of decent quality compared to other parks I’ve been to in China including shanghai Disneyland where they rip after one use. This one we kept and used repeatedly on rides and for the 2nd day.Fast pass. So we ended up paying for the fast pass. This was a mistake. I’m sure lines can get long in the summer but at the time we went lines were almost always 5-10 minutes. At most maybe 30 minutes. Animals. The shear number of marine animals they had was amazing. I’ve never seen a penguin display quite was large as this. The beluga whale show was just simply mesmerizing- because this was my first time seeing a beluga and then there was maybe 7 of them at the same time! Most of the rides we went on also seemed to bring us right by an animal exhibit. I think my only complaints was that it was hard finding a warm drink when the days we visited was very cold. And my daughter who just measures under 120 cm had to miss out on some of the more fun rides.
Perfect For Families,"Located in Zhuhai, China which is a modern and fast developing area next to Macau and Hong Kong. This theme park is within an integrated holiday compex that has several excellent hotels (we stayed at the Penguin hotel).This theme park provides both great fun and play for the entire family as well as valuable enriching learning and knowledge for the young ones through their exotic animals exhibits (Whale Sharks, Chinese Giant Salamanders, Chinese Pink Dolphins, Manatee, etc.)"
Our 8 year old daughter loved it!,"Once you arrive at Chimelong park you realise how big the place really is...t's most definitely a whole day as it is huge! Once you are in the gates, where they check your bags for food etc...there are an assortment of things to do and places to visit. Everything is worth seeing and doing, especially the many rides, animal shows, whale shark aquarium, animal enclosures, night parades and circus afterwards. We all loved the water rides, especially our daughter who went on them a few times. Do not forget to go to the circus afterwards, it is definitely worth seeing. Also, recommend going during the week and taking your own snacks, but remember to hide your snacks really well. Hope this helps."
Must do!!,"A massive, awesome ocean park!! Lots and lots of animals, very well kept enclosures, some rare species too. Would highly recommend spending a day here!!"
Worth the Visit!,"The whale shark tank is absolutely breathtaking! Several Guinness World Records can be attributed to the park, which make it a must see for any ocean enthusiast!"
Not for small ones,The park is big and has many thing to do but it’s crowded during pus visit and 85% of attractions are not suitable for baby below 90cm. And for the reste of them both the volume and light effects are just too violent for kids. But it’s indeed cheaper than Disneyland.Nevertheless 5 stars for the big aquarium.
I ENJOYED ,I enjoyed everything I saw in the Theme park.I like the Ocean kingdome where therevis a big dolphine statue.It's a beautiful place.
Compares to Sea World,"I’ve been to Sea World in Orlando and San Antonio multiple times each, and Chimelong is almost equal to Orlando Sea World, (which says a lot).  The only slight shortcoming I found is that the shows at Chimelong are not as good as Sea World shows.  But do go to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom – it is better cost-wise than Sea World.  We purposely went on a week day during mid-October and the crowd size was perfect.  I hear and expect it would be like ""Disney World in summer"" size crowded, (unbearable), during non-school days.  You will be worn out before you see everything, if it is even possible to see everything there in one day."
Very entertaining and relaxing ,"We went to the Ocean Kingdom on the working day in order to avoid long queue. Its a well organised theme park, every shows went so smoothly and on time. The highlights were dolphin show and 8pm firework show. The theme park was holding a special  Halloween shows and activities at night during our visit. It was way too realistic and scary for young children. Good fun for adults.It’s definitely one of the best theme parks in south China."
Exceeded my expectations,"So much to see and do here. Wonder why the park is not as well known as Ocean Park or Disneyland in Hong Kong - it is on par if not better than these parks. If you are in Macau, it is less than an hour ride from the Cotai Strip. There is a bus service from Studio City (HK$70 return) that takes you across the border via Lotus Port."
"Great Place , for Kids , Adults , Parents ,","Its impossible to write in just 1 review about this place , but i will try my best I visited the place with my wife  and couple of Chinese friends , we reached as early as 9 am  (its around 2 hours drive from Tianhe district Guangzhou) We planned 2 day trip  (with stay in penguin hotel) now let me share  pros and cons PROS  !!!1)  awesome penguin hotel ,   lovely theme , 2) only problem , i faced was  No indian food in the hotel ,  that disappoint me 2) we put our luggage in the rooms ,  then we head towards the park , 3)  awesome architect , well designed ,  at entrance we saw worlds biggest LED screen ,  that amazed us , 4)  best show was 5D movie , (or 7D  not sure) ,  that was really awesome , it last 15 to 20 mins , but boy that was great 5)  Beluga show ,  polar bears  etc , all amazing shows ,  many rides ,   especially 2 water roller coasters , really really amazing 6) educational rooms  ,  how to treat the baby animals  etc , 7)  some restaurants ,  but mostly chinese food ,  8) then the parade around 4pm , 9)  then we came back to hotel ,  did rest and then  we watched the international circus at night ,  which was awesome , 10)  let me tell u ,  near entrance there is a food court ,  with 1 indian restaurant but all close as early as 8pm , 11)   penguin hotel breakfast was great . lots of food ,   with real penguins inside the glass doors ,  next to the breakfast hall , which really amaze kids , 12)  then we enjoyed 2nd day again at park ,  CONS : 1)  Food is a big problem , 2)  staff speak little or no english ,"
Best aquarium ever !!,"This ocean theme park is highly recommended to families of all ages with superb facilities such as the highly thrill seeking parrot coaster and polar explorer, it also has rides suitable for families with young children such as bumber cars and underwater explorer that lets u view the whale sharks up close, there were also a great variety of animals such as polar bears, penguins, otters, seals, dolphins etc but the most outstanding must visit attraction is the whale shark aquarium💖, performences were also well planned and exciting to watch with the best performance in my opinion being the dolphin performance and the closing performance called guardians of the sea that incoporates drones, jetskis, hydro jetpackers, fireworks, pyrotechnics, sound effects on a scale that is comparable to those of disney and universal studios  great job definitely be back again🤗🤩🤩🤩"
Allocate the whole day here!,This is for all theme park lovers out there. I would suggest to spend the whole day here. Most rides requires a min height of 1.2m. There are a few rides for kids below the height limit. Best time to visit is in November. September is scorching hot and you might not enjoy the heat.
Spectacular,"Great place for aquariums with dolphins, whales and a plethora of sea creatures. The jellyfish is a crowd pleaser. Bears and polar bears! Rides for young and old. Dolphin show is a must see especially the parrots after the main show."
Amazing Sealife...Thrilling Rides!,"This place is just amazing! It's hard to know where to begin. The shows are great fun. We saw the Dolphin show, the Beluga whale show and the Sea lion show, all good, probably in that order. The Aquarium is the biggest in the World with Whale sharks etc. Fantastic!The water rides are large,fun and wet! The star of the show for me is the Parrot Coaster, I believe the longest wing coaster in the world, Brilliant fast fun and smooth!The show on the lake is great, best at night with the fireworks and light shows.The Parade is fun, a big illuminated carnival parade.All in all a great place. We bought fast track wrist bands, which if you are only there for one day I highly recommend. They put you to the front of the ride queues and give you fast entry to all the shows, and as there is so much to see you really don't want to waste precious time queuing(especially in the heat) as the day will end too fast anyway!"
Go to this park for sure!!! Amazing experience!,"We loved this park even more than our visit to any other park in the country. Disneyland was a flop next to this park!The rides + exhibits and the shows on and off were the perfect mix! Plus no queues, friendly staff and great rides.Best part which was evryones favourite was the fireworks show at the end which was absolutely mind blowing. The largest aquarium is used marvellously around so many parts of the park!Take food from out as the options inside are limited.Loved it, definitely a must visit."
entertaining and educational,"Part aquarium and part theme park, one could spend a full day, or more, exploring this location. While I dislike trained animal performances, there is enough fun and educational material apart from that to keep the kids entertained for the day.  There are seven different themed areas such as Arctic, Amazon, Dolphins, etc. each with their own wildlife, rides, and greatly overpriced restaurant locatiohns. Can't bring in your own food, though.  The twilight parade is colorful and glittery. Expect it  to be crowded like all such parks in China. Plan on spending the entire day to see everything."
A very huge Theme Park,"Wow just a wow! Never seen a theme park/aquarium this big! Super duper nice here. We also had fun watching the spectacular night show, the closing salvo of the theme park. We were glad to have stayed until its closing time. lights and water shows were very very amazing. what an attraction!"
"Take Sea World (American one), add some strong Themed Rollercoasters and increase the overall care for the park","Ocean Kingdom is a unique place. The ""sea"" theme is strong with top level sea animal shows (Beluga whales, Dolphins, more), and numerous animal exhibits (Penguin one was poor and needed an overhaul, seemed older than others, and the Polar bear and Brown bear exhibits do not meet ethical treatment of animal standard: they were sad).  They have some delightful top rate rollercoasters and other attractions (Parrot Coaster is the biggie). Excellent staff with clearly strong management skills being deployed - it's clear they have learned a LOT about park operations and are working at a high level.  Lots of areas for kids to do added activities that had educational value.  The 5D theater was fun, with a high quality film...but the characters in the story are their own and have modest appeal. Not on the level of a Mickey or any Disney character.   The float parade was quite nice, but we left before the grand finale fireworks - due to rain. All said, it's a day well spent - lots to do, well maintained, well organized. Treat yourself and stay at the Hengqin Bay Palace hotel...and you'll have a great one-two day outing.  The resort pools will keep you occupied for a second day."
2 Days at Chimelong Ocean Kingdom!!!,"Ppl in HK can pls take all their Parks, The Disneylands, The Ocean Parks etc. mix it up in cocktail shaker and serve it in a 4 to 5 times bigger container n there you have it, CHIMELONG OCEAN KINGDOM (CLOK).. Where do I even start? The huge LED Screen at the entrance which plays all the attractions inside. Amazing Exhibits of these wonderful species which include, Walrus, Sealions, Penguins, Bear, Polar Bear, Arctic Wolf, Beluga Fish, Dolphins and their shows to go with it. The world record holding Aquarium that holds 5 whales and biggest acrylic glass sheet. Amazing Rides like rollercoaster, Water splash rides and so on. The 2 Parades in Afternoon & Evening. The awe inspiring closing ceremony.. How can i forget, The 5D show, where in you wear your 3D glasses and sit in, but your chair moves as the drama on the screen unfolds, splash of water or blow of air as per the scenes on the screen. It was all so mind blowing.. Superb facilities for kids, wheelchair access to every place, there is something for everyone here..Highly recommended place for people of all ages!!!"
Family with seniors,"My wife and myself brought along my parents to this place. It was a big theme park with good facilities, rides (parrot coaster looks good), restaurants and shows.We have seen the Beluga whale show - the whales are simply adorable! Great performance. Although I have not much time for the rides, It is a place for family with children even to seniors. We have rented wheelchair for my mum who has walking issue. The staff have good service bit generally not as cheerful as other theme parks (e.g. Everland Seoul).Hopefully this theme park can install the needed soft skills in the future."
Fun place,The only negative side is that staff doesn’t speak English. Everything else is excellent. Many attractions to visit and play. The aquarium with whale sharks is amazing and huge. Felt bad for bears living in a hot place. Games are fun. Tried Polar Express and Parrot roller coaster - exciting. Several restaurants to eat. Highly recommend to visit.
Amazing Day,"I visited the theme park with my family, and had an amazing time viewing the animals and enjoying the roller coasters!"
Restaurants not good,A big complex with rides and shows. It is said it should take about 2 days to go around the complex. I think one day is enough. Plenty of things for kids to do. U can hire a buggy for 100rmb for the day leaving 200rmb deposit. Travelling during the week is less crowded. Big disappointment were the restaurants just mainly canteen dishes with high prices. Nothing special. There is no western style dish like Shrimp with fries I was hoping for. After Zhuhai being a port I thought they would have more variety of different Sea food dishes.
1 night stay,"This hotel is meant to be a 5 Star. After a standing check in process, we need to walk to another end to buy admission ticket. The toiletries and beverage is limited. Besides the scenery to see dolphins (got a sea view), found the standing bathroom dirty. My child who use the bath tub ended up making floor wet as there is no shower screen. Breakfast is good. However, other choices like Japanese and western restaurant were expensive. At least us100/- for 2 mains and 2 drinks. Like the rare sight to see dolphins in the hotel. Will visit once only."
Amazing  Display of Rare Species of Sea,"A complete day out in Zhuhai Chimelong Ocean Kingdom.Taxi fare from Gongbei District/Port/Zhuhai High Speed Railway Station will cost 100 RMB .Citybus number K10  and K11 from gongbei Bus terminal or Railway Station  will take 2 or 4 RMB only directly to the spot upto night 2130 hrs.Highspeed train from Guangzhou costs only 70 RMB and takes one hour and available every twenty minutes intervals from morning to midnight.at Ocean Kingdom Adult ticket price is 350 RMB, tickets for two days are available also.Due to Chinese spring festival holidays there were huge rush and all the shows and rides were lined up for pretty long time. If someone can afford , they may avail the Priority pass option to avoid waiting in the line. I enjoyed Parrot Coaster ride and Polar explorer ride specially apart from the 5D cinema .There are different shows of Penguin, Dolphin et cetera which are very enjoyable too especially for small kids .There are food courts available inside the park.My suggestions for Splurge travellers to stay in Penguin hotel or Chimelong resort beside the park and enjoy for two days.Budget travellers may Stay at Gongbei or visit from Guangzhou .There is festival parade daily and a paid circus show at evening. Must not miss the fastest wing roller coaster and largest whale tank of the world."
"Decent park, but perhaps some mixed feelings about some of the animals in captivity","On a trip to China late last year, one of the final things we did was a trip out to Zhuhai and Ocean Kingdom.We stayed at one of their hotels nearby (that'll be covered in a different review) with regular shuttle busses to and from the park.Lets be clear from the offset, this is no Disney World, heck, it's no Disney Land, but it does have a certain charm about it. It wasn't particularly busy when we arrived, it never got that busy during the rest of the day, but that was fine, it meant queues were minimal, and you could freely walk around. One of the first things to hit you appears right at the very entrance, Ocean Avenue, a vast overhead LED canopy, showing images of various sea life such as fish, dolphins, and penguins. Once through, you can't help but notice the GIANT whale shark statue in the background which, if memory serves, is where the aquarium is.As well as being a theme park with rides (the majority of which are for the young amongst us), there are various animal exhibits, including the aforementioned aquarium , which is one of the biggest in the world, and houses whale sharks and mantas.Now, depending on how you feel, Ocean Kingdom also houses such intelligent animals as dolphins and beluga whales, who also take part in some shows where they do tricks. Should such beautiful and intelligent creatures be kept in captivity or made to perform for the masses? I'll leave that for you to decide. However, I saw no signs off outward distress amongst any of the animals, (I'm an ex-zoologist/animal behaviourist), save for some of the bears who exhibited the ""rocking"" behaviour.As well as animal shows (dolphins, whales, sea lions, walruses, etc.) there were human shows such as the parade (think Disney parade but on a much lesser scale), and stunt shows on the water featuring jet skies and water jets.Elsewhere, there is a 5D cinema, it's mostly in Mandarin, but the story is aimed at kids, so you'll be able to follow no problem. There's also various rides dotted around. What was a bit rubbish was how many stalls were shut, perhaps it was the time of year we went (it was, after all, not that busy for the two days we visited), but it did give the park an air of ""this is shutting down soon"".Food wise, it isn't great, and slightly pricey for the quality of the food, but you will find things like burgers (sort of) and chips, so maybe bring a packed lunch...Overall, it was a nice place to visit and walk around; the aquarium is absolutely amazing and giant; staff at some of the animal exhibits were knowledgeable about the animals; the rides are geared towards children, but there's a few reasonable ones for adults too; but, depending on your stance on animal welfare, you could end up with mixed feelings."
Good park - except for the Polar Bears,"Heads up- if you don’t want to feel utterly depressed, don’t go and see the polar bears. They are amazing creatures but to see them like that, in a tiny space, is simply sad. One was laying down looking depressed, and the other was very old and thin looking, walking from side to side against the glass, looking very distressed. It was truely heartbreaking. Other than that it was a good day- the Parrot Coaster is a must do. The food was very average and over priced, so I would suggest bringing some snacks."
Really nice park,"Really nice park, the aquarium is HUGE, and has 2 beluga whales in captivity and many other animals. Overall a really nice place to visit especially with small children who will find it fascinating. I recommend staying in any of the hotels close to the parks. Also if you can stay until about 6/7pm for the show."
Great for groups and family ,Amazing if you are interested in these parks good shows and cool architecture not cheap and should spend one day to make the ticket worth dont go  in weekend waiting lines  too long
Boat and market very nice,"we vist to bangkok from 1st jan for stay 2 night , for the day time we went to the khaosan road market take the child for shopping and for the every we went to the asiatique ferris wheel , also we take the boat in river , the night veiw very becautiful and cooler."
EXCELLENT!,"This is an excellent theme park. It's like an aquarium, zoo, and theme park in one! We started with the 5D experience (which is quite good, but might be a little scary for little kids). Then we went counter clockwise across the park. If you are into rides, i suggest you buy or bring a rain jacket from the beginning. You will be needing it many times in different rides. Their dolphin show is quite nice, way way better than the one in Ocean Park HK. Don't miss the great Whale Shark Aquarium, the biggest one in the world. They not only have 1, but 4-5 whale sharks swimming in the same huge aquarium. It's really amazing!! Not to miss are the bears, the walruses (they are SOOOO big and heavy), and if you'e not yet tired of the penguins, go see those as well.  Everything in this park is really nice and well laid out. The animals seemed to be well-fed and healthy. Overall, two thumbs up for this park! The fireworks at night are really great too! Very different from the usual fireworks as it combines fountains, acrobats, lights and fireworks in the show."
Horrendous catering standard ,"The Chimelong Safari, operated by the same company Chimelong, enjoys a great reputation. So we had high expectations when we planned a visit to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom. We traveled from the Macau side and the hotel transfer was underwhelming,  with no clear directions and the shuttle bus from the immigration runs on an infrequent hourly basis. We chose the Penguin Hotel. The rooms are big enough but the deco was quite tacky. The staff were professional enough, but the service was rather cold.The theme park itself was very well run and quite enjoyable. The collection of marine animals was impressive. Although I have visited many Oceanariums all over the world - like in U.S., Japan and Hong Kong, Chimelong really aced them in terms of sheer numbers - whale sharks, belugas, dolphins, penguins, polar bear, walruses,  sea lions, you name it. The performances are also tightly packed so there was no shortage of entertainment. The rides are also plentiful and quite exciting.Our biggest shock and disappointment was the extremely low quality of the catering standards. At a themepark or a resort hotel,  no one expects fine dining or gourmet experience.  Very often, hearty buffets and wholesome food will pass. But the food served at the Chimelong, particularly the Penguin Hotel,  was simply atrocious. Noodles, barbeques, dim sums, sweet and sour pork, nothing was done right!  For someone who grew up in Southern China,  I couldn't accept a big tourism and hotel group cannot even find a decent group of chefs to serve in one of its most important resorts.  This was a big let down. The breakfast was so bad we decided to skip our 2nd visit to the theme park in the morning and crossed the border back to Macau.I think the poor catering standards do not do justice to the quality of the theme park,  nor to Chimelong' s reputation.Until the food improves, I would recommend anyone interested in ocean life should visit the park early in the morning and avoid staying at the hotel. Pack your own food if you can! If Chimelong wants this resort to supplement the product offering in Macau and build its reputation as China's leading tourism group, it really should get its act together."
Chimelong Ocean Kingdom,"A great family or even solo day out, loads of rides, activities & educational postings inside the attractions.Interactive activities if you are lucky enough to get picked by 'camera lottery' Dolphin show is a must see as well as the Manatee & Wallruss/Sealion shows. Best to visit over 2 days as there is that much to do. Better visited out of peak season but busy even then"
love from animals,"this is the best theampark i have visited no queue ,hassle free ticket ,wold class environment with lush green mountain surrounding,amazing show of sea animal,you cannot believe on you eyes,rollercoster amazing,visit ones you love it definitely,very convenient transportation from zuhai gogai port and zuhai jiwan airport via bus"
Awesome place to visit,I went there with my friends from macau. It’s one of the place that should be visited if you are in Zhuhai. Ticket price is also affordable that is Rmb 230 per person. Just suggest that need to visit this place when it’s less crowded.
A great day activity,I am quite surprised with the Theme Park. It is a great park for attractions as well as rides.  The theater shows are done very well.  Circus was also there but in the evening.  Would be better in the early afternoon. The parades are also very colorful.  Restaurants were diverse for every palates.
A Must  see if  you are in Zhuhai,first I was not  sure if I want  to  go  to this place because it  was far from my  hotel. then I checked and  find the  easiest and cheapest way.  public bus No. K10 for  only 2 RMB. I spend 5 hours in this huge theme park. paid 350 for  ticket and visited all sites and shows for free. Shark & Dolphins show the best part.
Hidden Gem in Zhuhai,The first Amusement park that we visited in China. It has an amazing variety of waterlife in display. Biggest aquarium. There is a 5D movie screen as well. Have visited the place thrice and enjoyed it each time. Very well maintained. It has a few adventure rides aa well if you are upto it. There are good restaurants as well if you are a non-vegetarian. We normally take a car from Guangzhou and return by night. But there is a water park and some other attractions nearby along with a resort too. So you can easily spend two days here. Trains are available from Guangzhou to Zhuhai and from there you can take a bus to Ocean Kingdom
Turn down the volume!!!,"The trip to Ocean Kingdom was quite decent - although a large section of the park was closed off to young children due to Haloween (scary) attractions ideal for teenagers. However the Dolphin show was frankly ridiculous. In a small enclosed auditorium,  they had a 3 array speaker system (larger than is installed at the 100,000 capacity M.C.G in Australia - cranked to full volume and the host literally SHOUTED into the microphone. I am a semi-professional DJ - my hearing is my job - I know that distortion (not volume) kills your hearing; this was both. We covered my own, and my childrens ears for a time - and eventually ran away.  That was one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life. A literal assualt on my hearing.I registered here in the hope Ocean Kingdom can do something about it. I.E turn it down and teach your presenter to use a microphone."
Fun park but take some drinks and snacks,"If you are going there early, don’t. Nothing opens before 10:30 in the park. Also bring a rain coat for several of the rides require rain coats or you will be very wet. They sell a disposable rain coat for 15 rmb. Bring your own drinks if you want to save money. A bottle of water is 10 rmb. Plan to stay for the night show. It is really spectacular. If you are driving there and not staying at a hotel stop well in advance of the park because there are no stores within 20 minutes of the park."
"Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, Zhuhai South China","This theme park is just 3 years old so every thing is still spick and span.  From the name, you can guess its themed around water.  Its a big place, plan a full day to appreciate the place and not feel rushed.  Don't miss the Ocean Aquarium; it has the world's largest viewing gallery.  You will see sting rays, whale sharks (yes Whale sharks!), jelly fish, box fish and some I dont even know the name of.There is a roller coaster that will scare the **** out of you.  Its a very tall one with a big drop, a corkscrew and the usual assortment of sharp turns.  My advice?  Ride it! Its huge fun.  But eat after, not before! ; pThe place puts on a parade at 03:00pm and there's fireworks at 08:00pm.  Then there the dolphin show, the performing seals, the musical water fountain and a 3D animation.  Not as good as what Hollywood produces, but still, its a nice break out of the hot sun if you go on a sunny day.If you have pre-teen kids, this is certainly a destination they will enjoy.Oh...while I was there, there was a circus show.  Its not part of the Theme Park package so you have to pay extra (RMB300-500, depending on seat location)."
Fantatsic,The Chimelong Ocean Kingdom is one of the best presented and well maintained parks I have been to. This is a theme park offering the best aquarium and fantastic themed rides and zoo all at one location. I suggest you go early if you want to try and see it all. It is suitable for all ages. If you are game try the unbelievable roller coaster - just over 1km long in under 2 minutes. Try in during the day then again after dark WOW.Be assured it will take you all day to enjoy and appreciate this park and if time permits stay for the fireworks and show at 8.30 pm.As I said just fantastic.
Good place for outing,Enjoyable fun rides. Adventure rides. Aquarium. Easily can spend lot of comfortable time with family. Adult price approx 800 RMB and kids RMB 385.Much fun here
New Attraction near to Macau,This is a drive of an hour or less from Macau... but it comes in China so Immigration clearance takes time... so when at this Ocean Park. it's a good place to visit for adventure activities and to see aquarium
World class theme park,This is my second visit to the park and our family thoroughly enjoyed it. The rides are fairly tame and easily handled by all members of the family. The gigantic acrylic underwater viewing wall is truly a technological marvel when you consider the enormous amounts of pressure it has to withhold. The surrounding areas have undergone amazing developments since my last visit in 2015.
A place where the kids will enjoy.........,This is 1 of the place where the kids will enjoy most. The place is clean and the structure and interior is really impressive. We book via tour and went from Dongguan which takes about 3 hrs by coach. Lucky it's not that pack when we were there and we manage to see most of the attractions without much issue.The aquarium is huge and their shows are quite interesting and the dolphins and whales are very well train.
A day in a magic kingdom,"An amusement park dedicated to sea life, very well prepared, the penguins, the wahales were a very refreshing experience. All in all a beautiful day in a very well prepared environment. very instructional and amusing."
Amusement park and aquarium,"Amusement park in an aquarium is not an entirely new idea but this park did it right. We spent two full days in the park and everyone loved it especially the little ones. Things I liked - Fast passes (in hindsight, a full-day trip with fast passes would suffice to enjoy all of the rides and activities)- The main aquarium with whales shark is very impressive and imformative- The staff were very helpful and friendly to kids- The park is well laid out (not so big or small) and easy to navigate- Rides are friendly to preschoolers"
"If you visit the aquarium here, all other aquariums would be felt like small fishbowls.","I've visited this theme park three times in total. I am a frequent visitor of many different aquariums in different countries, and the aquariums here are one of the best in the world. Animals look healthy and well taken care of. The theme park also provides a weird yet interesting combination of a ride and animal observation. Its interpretation programs are also nice if you can understand Chinese. Shows are quite unique in terms of a variety of animals, aside from animal right issues. The theme park and epecially the aquarium and the observation area are designed very well--it's quite easy to observe sea creatures from different angles. It's biggest aquarium is one of the best I've ever visited. All other aquariums suddenly became too small after I saw this particular aquarium."
Ocean Creatures Everywhere,"I was quite reluctant to go but I sure am glad that I went. I did not think that I would like it as much as I did. There are all kinds of lands with different kinds of animals everywhere. With dolphin world, sea otter world, bear world, manatee world and all kinds of other animals. The one location that everyone should see when they come is the whale shark exhibit. This attraction has the world's thickest viewing glass but does not seem like it. The whale shark and the manatee were my favorite attractions. There are a lot of attractions that anyone can see. There is also a firework show that is shown every night. My family and I spent the whole day at Chimelong Ocean Park and we loved it. I can't wait until I can visit again!"
A fun and enriching getaway!,Great theme park very much similar to the Ocean Park in Hong Kong but much better. It is extremely organized and clean with an entertaining concept. Good for all ages and families. The best thing is that it is not overpriced and good value for money. A must go if you are in Zhuhai.
Not as good as I expected,"Don't get me wrong, the whale shark aquarium was amazing, but the overall park  was far below my expectations. Many recommended this to me and I saw the number one rank on TripAdvisor, but it's really not that good. First of all, the shows were clearly trying to copy Sea World. It's not a coincidence they also put diving, macaws, and dolphins together. The shows were incoherent, especially the dolphin show. They were pretty impressive, especially the beluga whale one, but incomparable to those of Sea World. The extreme air-conditioning of every animal exhibit indoors compared to the heat of outside was topped off with bursts of heavy rain when I went. It was impossible not to get a cold. They need milder air-conditioning or they can provide us with jackets we won't think to bring in 90 degree weather. The rides were good but made you pay 15 rmb for a raincoat to go on some of them. This is NOT a water park. Also, the rides are far and few. The 5D theater is worth a visit. However, there are better Changlong parks in Guangzhou where it all started. I was also greatly disappointed on the lack of emphasis placed on saving marine life. There was some on being friends with them but nothing on helping them or how chimelong helped them. It's nowhere as good as Sea World. Also, the whale shark basketball game was a major disappointment and not worth your time."
Excellent Place for Family,"The Chimelong Ocean Kingdom is better than I thought.  The size of this property is bigger than the Sea World in San Antonio.  It presents more ocean lives than the Sea World and has more facilities, especially more places to eat than Sea World.  The firework show every night is excellent.  The hotels and other attractions nearby make this a perfect place for family vacations."
Great Fun for the old and young,"Excellent day trip from Macau . the rides , attractions were all great , esp the huge aquarium that features 4-5 whale sharks . The sight of these majestic sea creatures is worth the attraction fees alone . Do stay to the end, there's a 15 mins fireworks show , quite good and well chronograph ."
marvellous day out at the ocean kingdom,"We stayed esp at the Hengqin bay hotel to have a fantastic day outing at the ocean kindgdom. It was worth the day spent at the place..couple of good rides , some fantastic 4d shows at the theatres, and lots of sea animal and creatures and some were coupled with rides to give you a feeling you are a part of them.."
Surprising high quality for a Mainland theme park!,First Class experience equal to Seaworld and Universal Studios.  The arctic displays and animals were a surprise!  Nice parade in the afternoon with entertainment.  The thrill rides were great.  Be certain to obtain the plastic covers for your clothes.  You will get extremely wet!  A great place to spend an entire day.  Good value for money.
Brilliant day out!,"If your looking for a great day out this is the place.  Totally makes sea world on the Gold Coast look shabby and embarrassing in my opinion. So many amazing things to see and do, well done to this place for being blue to keep children, adults and grandparents thoroughly entertained!"
Fantastic Aquarium ,"I visited the place because I want to see the largest aquarium in the whole world. It's nice and fantastic, so crowded though. I didn't visited the whole area of the place. I am looking forward to visit again the place."
A bit of pricey ,"We bought the set tickets which includes hotel and ticket to the park! The park itself was fine, better for family with children or teenagers. But the hotel is very nice and comfortable! Especially the buffet! The longest buffet line I have ever seen!"
Great place for families,"You can easily spend a day here, particularly if you are travelling with Kids how are interested in fish and maritime live. Ocean kingdom has the biggest Aquarium of the world (holds 5 Guiness Book records) and it is really breathtaking!"
super fun and exciting ,we spent 2days for this adventure and absolutely awesome. we enjoyed most of the rides here.their 5D show was amazing seems you're in reality. we watched their major parade around 3pm with floats and dancers in fancy costumes.
"Combination of theme park, aquarium and zoo","We went during the Easter holiday (which does not exist in Mainland China) so we get to leisurely enjoy the park, which would otherwise be much more crowded, without much queuing at all.They exhibit a wide range of sea and land animals and include some fabulous performances too with the dolphins, beluga and seals. Note that some animals kept in captivity do not look very happy and it could make you cringe. Not that they are abused (at least not on the surface level) but they just seem sad. There are arctic fox, wolves, polar bears, bears, the most famous whale shark and much more to see.You could book tickets online but make sure you bring your confirmation code and credit card to the park to redeem the tickets. If you visit the park on a sunny day, bring a hat."
Better than expected ,"Tips: Get the family package which is better value if you have at least two adults and one childThe toilets near the whale shark aquarium is the cleanest, if your back is facing the whale shark aquarium entrance than the toilets are on your left. Beluga show was really good. Parrot roller coaster is a myst if you are brave enough."
Many of the animals suffered,"I was supposed to give 4 stars to Ocean Kingdom, until I saw the brown bears, polar bears and the polars foxes who were all suffering and looked very sad, they seems having anxiety disorder or emotional disease that didn't have enough space to move and expose to the public. I have checked on the internet that one of the polar bear had walked from and to a 4meters route for a few years many hours a day. It was pretty sad that they don't even have anything to play. I still feel regret travelling there tho the trip finished a dew days ago."
nice,"very nice place to spend the day with family or partner, amazing shows and attractions, the whale shark tank is just umbeliaveable"
Amazing park in South China!,"This park really is a gem in South China. It is a definite must-see place if you are travelling around here. The kids will love this place. Huge park with dolphins, belugas, polar bears and so on. Their shows are very nice too. They also have a 5D theater which was very cool. The rides are very scary but worth trying once to pump up the adrenaline. We went on a saturday and we were lucky not to see too big of a crowd so we could enjoy each and every part of the park."
AMAZING ,Took two days for us to see the whole park and it was absolutely awesome!! Favourite ride was the Parrot Coaster for the adults and my daughter (6) loved the spinning pirate ship my son (3) lived the walrus boat ride. Alot of the rides are water related and u get pretty wet - rain coats available for 15 yuan.Fireworks extravaganza at new night was pretty good and there is a parade at 3pm each day.No expense has been spared on all facilities and has only gripe is some of the food prices.Animal shows and exhibits are all of top standard and all worth a look.Highlight for me was the whaleshark aquarium and the dolphin show.5D theatre a little pleasant surprise also and definetly worth the time.
1st day is raining and 2nd day is excellence,"heaven for kids.. they have playground and have many parade.if i don't get wrong,around 4kind.from the welcoming parade,costume parade at 4,skydive parade and at night the closing ceremony. need to have 2 days 1 night to visit and enjoy all the things here"
A great day out,"Traveled by ferry from HK and then taxi to the park. It was a grey day with a little rain. Maybe that stopped crowds of people going because we never had to line up for any attraction and there were no crowds of people to fight your way through.All the animal displays were excellent, the animals looked healthy and well care for. The grounds and facilities were clean. Lots of food for sale catering for most tastes. The park is well laid out and very attractive. Not a lot of English spoken but all signs are clear and there is an English map available that we followed. WE didnt watch the parade and we didnt stay for the firework display. But next time we definitely will.There are hotels close to the park too if you want to stay over. It was one of the best days out I have ever had."
Off Season visit March 2017,"No crowds. Great. Easy to get into shows. No queue. Saw Walrus Splash show and Beluga Dolphin show. Park was well designed. Pleasantly surprised. Stayed at Hengqin Bay hotel also was a great choice, more upmarket."
chimelong ocean park no place for polar bears,took a one day trip form macau. holiday inn cotai has a shuttle bus to the bordergate from there you pass immigration from there take a city bus to the chinese immigration station upon exit there is a free shuttle bus to ocean kingdom total time about one hour. the park was large and well maintained plenty of rides and shows for all ages my only complaint is the polar bear exhibit and artic dogs exhibit they are kept in doors basically a large air condition room never to see daylight or fresh air again very sad! the weather there is to hot for this type of animal i could never go back there again till this is fixed
Dont waste time,Travelled 2 hours from Guangzhou by car. Not worth the time. Surely not for someone who doesn't understand Chinese.
great for families with kids,"this place is great for families with kids, although quite far from city center, there is direct city bus service that can take you there and it only cost 2 yuan"
Great park. Avoid holiday season or weekend,"Made a big big mistake by visiting the park during Chinese New Year holiday.The park was extremely crowded and it ruined our experiences.It is actually a great park, with great attraction as well. But the queue was unbearably long at that moment.And in china, they simply don't know how to queue. They will push you and without hesitate cut your line. On some occasion, my son was being pushed so hard until he almost felt down, and I have to yell at them to stop pushing.It was kinda dangerous as well, when people keep on pushing during queuing.If you fall down, you might be difficult to stand back and others might step on you.I saw one lady felt down, people behind her don't bother to help her up, but keep on pushing. After two unpleasant and dangerous long queue, we gave up entering other exhibition and just strolling around the park."
Fantastic!,"Great day out for all ages. We visited close to Halloween and it was amazing. All the staff were in costume and great face paint. They also offered face painting for visitors, although the lines were quite long. They had a haunted area set up with lots of fog and monsters wandered through it, and a few different haunted houses too. Within the aquarium itself, there's an excellent variety of animals to see. I really loved watching the colourful jellyfish, it was quite relaxing. The water stunts, lights and fireworks show is 100% worth seeing, it was fantastic. Kids and adults alike can really enjoy this place."
Awesome adventure!!!!,"Wow such an awesome entertained and adventurous place for all people. Had lots of fun.""FUNULTIMATE"" I MUST SAY. Even though our trip was very short but we went and play all the games,n saw all those birds, animals. Specially enjoyed playing those 3 roller costers. Wish to visit again. And lastly want to thank the security guard who helped us to get taxi. Thanks a lot to them."
Great!,"Visited this place on 2015, Zhuhai Chimelong is a place that is TOTALLY WORTH A VISIT. So many cute animals there! Great water performances, still the food tastes like... I do not wanna talk about it."
Overjoyed at Chimelong Ocean Kingdom,"We enjoyed the 5D Theatre, the performance of the Belugas (white whale sharks or dolphins) and the spectacular Fireworks Shine Hengqin Sea Show which features the trapeze skills of seven flying men dressed in multi-colored equipment, awesome fireworks display, mesmerizing laser shows and heart-pounding lighting and sound effects."
Very interesting sights,Lots of events going on and lots to do and see. Great for young children and families. I would recommend this for all families
Not Really that Cool....,"onsidering today's technology....this visit was truly disappointing.  My kid's really wanted to see a Circus type of thing....and me growing up, had been taken by my parents many times in many places, some truly great memories....but this place, overcrowded, overpriced and truly a let down in what was promoted....my friends and I could put on a better show than this....very sad for a country generally all about performance to the rest of the world..."
Great for kids. Shows very enjoyable for all ,"The maritime park of Zhuhai is a major tourist destination with apparently the largest aquarium in the world. It's quite drive from central Zhuhai and close to the Heng Qin border with Macau. It is huge - a sort of Chinese Disneyland but mainly for sea animals and fish, but with exhibits of Polar bears and brown bears too. There is also a major parade at 3 pm with floats, and dancers in fancy dress. We went with seniors, adults and children of 4, 8, and 11. Everybody enjoyed the day thoroughly. We arrived about 11 am and saw the dolphin show, 5D theatre, béluga whale show, waterboard jet show, as well as the huge aquarium (big enough to hold several whale sharks).  The shows were very enjoyable with up to 12 dolphins at a time performing, and up to 10 beluga whales in their show. Architecture was a little (a lot) eclectic as was that of the nearby penguin hotel!The food outlets were not to our taste but otherwise a great place to spend a day."
very nice,the tickets are a bit steep but worth visit two days are required to see the place fully wonderful aquarium and very good rides and shows beluga show is the best
Fantastic Visit,"Booked a combined ticket with the Hengqin hotel and Ocean Kingdom. We had two days in the park which was a little bit long, but it's hard to cover this place in one day too. The rides are good, the layout is easy and signs are everywhere. The restaurants have some good deals so no need to prepare too much - the food is reasonable and not super expensive. The staff are amazing there - very friendly, happy and willing to help. Even with crowds it was easy enough to navigate and get around. Highly recommend a trip here! They also seem to be doing a lot of work to make further improvements and add new attractions"
From Macau to Chimelong Zhuhai (STEP by STEP),"Going to Chimelong Zhuhai (an option I tried this December 2016)1. go to THE BEVERLY PLAZA Hotel located at Macau City proper (very near GRAND LISBOA)2. inside Beverly go to the CHINA TRAVEL SERVICE counter stall First Floor3. buy your ONE WAY ticket to Chimelong Hengqin (30 MOP), select your desired time4. board the bus in front of Hotel Beverly5. bus ride towards Lotus Border Gate will take approx 20 minutes including STOPOVER at Taipa Ferry Terminal.6. alight the bus at Lotus Border Gate for Macau Departure documentations7. ride again that same bus waiting at the other side of Border Gate after you EXIT Macau8. bus will bring you to HengQin Port for China Arrival documentations9. ride again that same bus waiting at the other side of HengQin Port after your China entry10. bus ride approximately 27 minutes to HengQin Bay HotelYOU HAVE ARRIVED at ChimeLong Complex...use the different free shuttles to navigate through the 3 hotels:HengQin Bay Hotel(Dolphin), Circus Hotel(Clowns) near CIRCUS TENT, Penguin Hotel (nearest to the CHIMELONG PARK)"
One of the better themed park in China,"A mid size themed park in my experience. Show not as good as disney. Young children may find it more interesting then the teenage. Well organized in term of safety, protection to children and well featured food and beverage offerings with mark-up pricing where most are prepared to pay. should the day of visit not at peak then you should finsih most feature from 10am-9pm. The aquarium is a must to watch. The grand finale will be the fire work at 8.30pm. (the Circle show near can be missed if you have seen it elsewhere)"
Super fun and exciting!,"great great fun in this place. Must really go to here, I recomend. my two baby and wife also enjoy. Everyone in different age will really really enjoy. food is good. Games and shows is the best. The animals is so cute and nice. Very fun to watch them. We all really like come again all the time."
All Substance Theme park ,"The largest theme park that I have been to, feels about the size of SeaWorld and movieworld in Gold Coast put together and without the flash. The rides were quite ok, but the range of marine life especially the beluga to the whale shark were quite amazing. The large tank to hold the 4 whale sharks were really quite something. The theatres to hold the sea creatures performance were huge with seating capacity of 1000-2000 easy. There is a day parade, night parade and it is top of with a fireworks and laser show at the end."
Chimelong Ocean Kingdom,Great place if you have kids. Be prepared for a lot of walking. Amazes me the number of whale sharks and polar bears they keep.
A great theme park to visit with kids,"Lot's of entertainment, animal shows- dolphins, sea lions, etc.Circus parade is fun too. Avoid 5D theater with small kids- under 6-7 years old-(can get scared easily) or elderly with heart problems. Food options a little limited, but it's OK for one day."
Very educational for kids,"It is not cheap going to the Ocean Kingdom for RMB 350. Check with travel agents in Hong Kong for package dealsYou have to walk quite a bit to catch the shows at different timings and different locations. Most of the shows are very good and they are all in Mandarin. You also get to see a lot of animals like dolphins, whales, penguins, bears, etc. In the afternoon 3pm, they have parades and at night they have fireworks like Disney Land. You'll definitely need a full day or more to  see everything! For those with children, I would even suggest staying there 1 night at one of the near by Hotels which is just right at the Ocean Kingdom.It could be very hot and unbearable in the summer because of the humidity.  The best time to go there is between October and April."
ITS LIKE A COLORFULL MOVIE....!!!,"ZHuhai Ocean Kingdom. The name says it all. A perfect Family / Couple place to Visit. i have visited many theme park around the globe but Ocean Kingdom is totally different of them all. This park makes us connect with the animal kingdom which we usually watch on TV. but seeing them face to face is like out of the world. In Indian i would say Chimelong Ocean Kingdom is like Rohit Shetty Movie "" COLORFUL with ACTION""Rides, Shows, parades, Adventures Shows, Animal Exhibits and many more.....The Best thing is LIVE atmosphere. you can feel the joy.Once to Visit in Life time..... CHIMELONG OCEAN KINGDOM"
Well being of Pizza,"Please do not send Pizza back to that horrible mall where he suffers in the tiny enclosure !  Please keep Pizza at Chimelong Ocean Kingdom,"
Well being of Pizza,"Please don't send Pizza back, please don't leave him isolated and confined, please, thank you, Stacy Pegram"
nice trip!,"I went with the University of the PSP group, when is in the winter of 2015.Firstly, we play in accordance with the direction of the park, from left to right side. which is the Motor-driven games  ,whose design of the device are exciting and interesting. Secondly, we went to the huge 5D cinema. Thirdly, we travel to the beluga whales's performance hall. In addition, there are many marine creatures in the large aquarium. My deepest impression is Penguin Museum with the whale shark Museum, with the tunnel-style design, you can see the penguins swim away above your head . Another exciting thing is the parade with the fireworks show. However, I really don't like the arrangement of the park. that is check your backpack to confirm us not bring the food and drinking water into the park, to make sure you have to consume in the park. And food is poor, expensive and unpalatable. Overall, we have a nice trip!"
Zhuhai Chimelong,"Zhuhai Chimelong is near to Macau, and I have ever been there with my boyfriend. It is because of near to Macau, we can start in Macau directly. I think it is very convenient for us, so it attracts me to go. However, we arrived there at 10 a.m. Before we went out, we bought the tickets and booked the hotel near the Chimelong. We are very expected. The first thing we did is that checked in, and bought the express ticket in order not to queue. After we finished all preparation, we enjoyed the Chimelong. We saw lots of animals such as penguins, polar bears, and sharks. I like to see animals very much. It is very amazing. I am impressive of those animals. Except to see animals, we also played games. However, I argue that games are not attracted for me. Finally, I suggest you must bring hand towel and heat dissipation if you go there in August."
for all ages,It was the summer holiday after my graduation from high school and that i went there with my classmate in the middle school. The Ocean Kingdom offer the graduate a discount so that we went there for fun at the beginning of the three-month summer holiday. We haven't get together for a long time since we went to different high school and we miss each other very much. We rid the praised roller coaster together and all of us get wet. Really exciting. Damp but happy to be get wet together. We also went to see all kinds of aquatic creatures like jellyfish. Penguin in the Ocean Kingdom is so cute that we stand outside the glass and forgot to leave. It is really a good place for all ages.
fantastic,"The first time to chimelong ocean kingdom,the first look is the very large area and like a  fairy kingdom,I visited in summer holiday, the drawback must be too many people, i see many people whenever where I was, but it can not cover the advantage. In first time, I play the roller coaster, it is better and faster than the old chimenlong, and the worker would careful check the safety measures and remind something I should pay attention, then, I go to aquarium, it is the selling point of Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, because it is different will other aquarium, i can cross the glass tunnel under the water to watch the shark, it is like walking underwater. At 8.00 p.m. they will be firework every night, it is impressive and fantastic, i can not forget this even at present. However, the park not allow to bring the food and water make me unhappy, and the food in park is not good enough. I was suggest that play in here at least 2 days."
Fantastic fun filled day with kids...,Ocean Kingdom is a place worth visiting if you are spending 1 full day here. The park is dividend into different zones and each zone has themed rides / attractions. Suggest that you plan your day in advance by getting a copy of the park map in advance and reach at the starting time. The Beluga show is their main show which is amazing. Besides this they have other shows.The night parade and the fireworks are awesome and worth the time. Don't miss it. Lots of opportunities to click photos with characters as well. My kids enjoyed this park better than HK Disneyland which we visited few days before.
Halloween activities of Chimelong,"Here is Chime Long Ocean Kingdom in Zhuhai. It is a very huge amusement park. I visited there in Halloween this year. All of the backdrops are related with Halloween. I went to there on the afternoon of Halloween. All activities about Halloween are held in the evening so I visited all aquariums and played all games facilities until the evening. If you want to go there, you must play all games facilities and visited all aquariums on daytime because they will be closed at night. All activities of Halloween were so exciting. You will see many “ghosts and monsters” walk around and scare you. I was so scared but I couldn't help to stay there. The most impressive is the Haunted House. I cannot remember what I saw because I was closing my eyes whole the process. At 8:00 p.m., Chime Long amusement park will be fireworks every night. It is a pity that I miss the fireworks so I suggested that taking the time of 8 p.m. to see the fireworks."
Amazing,"Amazing and hugeBeautiful large variety of ocean creatures.Well organized,multiple live shows and huge fish tank mentioned in world records.A must-see....a full day activities"
Leisure Day Trip,"We stayed in Macau and made a day trip to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom by taking the free hotel casino bus to Lotus Bridge customs. From there, you pay for a shuttle bus (either RMB or Macau dollar) that brings us across the bridge to Zhuhai customs. Right out from the customs there's a free shuttle bus to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom 长隆海洋王国。It was very convenient and fuss free!Entrance fee to the Ocean Kingdom is RMB 350. The entrance is very captivating and lively. I immediately had a liking for the place and the place is huge! You have to walk some distance to catch the shows at different timings and different locations. The shows are impressive although it's all in Mandarin. There're also quite a lot of animals like dolphins, whales, penguins, bears, etc. In the afternoon 3pm, they have parades and at night they have fireworks. You'll definitely need a full day to slowly see everything! For those with children, I would even suggest staying there 1 night at Penguin Hotel which is just right at the Ocean Kingdom, making it very convenient for parents and children to rest and go back again next day. For the price of the entrance fee, I think it's very worth it!"
Some really amazing sights,The park feels enormous at first but then you realize you can easily get through everything in a day.  The parrot coaster was my favorite.  The whale shark aquarium is pretty impressive as well.  Skip the night lagoon show in my opinion.  It's just a bunch of flashing lights fireworks and fountains with no particular choreography or purpose other than to look cool.  Instead get a ticket for the circus which occurs at the same time.  The circus is WORLD CLASS and I can't recommend it highly enough.
A small and neat theme park,"A theme park in Hengqin, Zhuhai in southern China. It opened in 2014, after 4 years of construction. Small and clean; bathrooms are kept neat with tissues and a/c. I enjoyed for what it's - not a Disney, not even close. Un-overwhelming, which is a good thing from time to time.I particularly enjoyed the whale shark aquarium and the lunch next door - Ocean Beauty Restaurant. After the busy lunch hour, I've the restaurant to myself, the only noise's light music mixed with ocean waves. The diver in the Whale Shark Aquarium has time to stop by a few times."
Visit the ocean kingdom with my family,"In a Saturday morning, my family and I went to the Ocean Kingdom in Zhuhai. Firstly, we visited  the manatees hall according to the recommendation of the map. The size of manatees hall is very big, so that we spent a lot of time to find the entrance.  When we entered the hall, there are so many manatees in the beach. Most of them were lazily lying on the water. And then we determined to play the Parrot Roller Coaster which beside the hall. This game is my favorite because it is the most exciting game in the Ocean Kingdom. The roller coaster driving slowly at the beginning, and then suddenly from the air to the ground, 360-degree rotation. Most of the player were shrieking and shouting when the roller coaster going down. How amazing game it is!Next is the Penguin Museum. When we walked into the museum, I feel the wind blowing over my cheeks. Suddenly, a few dull penguins appeared. They seems very cute and clumsy. I think my sister has fallen in love with them.In the evening, the volcano in the center of the lake emitted a flame. And then is the fireworks have been emitted into the sky one by one. They dyed the dark night sky into colorful. Besides, there were some water trapeze performances. They also used their superb technology to show a beautiful gesture. To sum up, Ocean Kingdom is the place that you can play the mobile game, see the animals and watch the show. It is a very wonderful place. You must have a see."
Amazing in May 2013,I visited this amazing park in May 2013.  There is so many things to see and do within the park. When you first walk in there is a ginormous screen overhead projecting sea animals swimming above you.  It was raining when I was there but that didn't stop me exploring the entire park.  You must take your family when you visit China!
great theme park getaway from Macau,"If you are staying or live in Macau this is the perfect day out!! comparable or i would even say better to ocean park in hong kong. It is scenic, clean and well organised. i like how the show times and ride wait times are well displayed. The night show is a must and the parrott coaster. The food is very well priced for theme parks but not amazing! its 2 buses from the lotus boarder gate of macau but overall a great day and well worth it!"
A Full Day of Fun!,"I can see why and how this Chimelong Ocean Kingdom has won and been crowned so many accolades and awards.  It is not just about it's size, but the variety of experiences and attractions and shows.My favourites are the Whale Shark and the White Beluga displays.  The flume rides were also fantastic... be prepared to get wet!I also appreciate that the food was homey and affordable - 4 of us had lunch and the total bill was RMB297 - we were filled with a spread of soup, vegetables, meat, gyoza and rice!TIP:  Bring a hat to provide some shade, go early before 11am and spend at least 5-6 hours to catch everything!  12noon's musical water fountain show in the middle of the park is delightful."
Good day out from Macau (with a bit of effort),"Whilst staying at Cotai I walked to the Lotus Bridge border crossing (just behind Studio City).  There were no queues, so I waked straight through the Macau side and caught the shuttle bus across the bridge (Rmb5 to the driver with no change given).  Through the Chinese border point (clearly with a visa) and there is a free shuttle bus to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom outside.  The bus only goes once an hour on the half hour though so you don't want to miss it.  This stops at a couple of hotels before you get to the Penguin Hotel (total time maybe 15-20 minutes)  Go into the hotel and you can buy tickets to the park on the right (adults Rmb380 for weekends).  Walk 100m from there and you're at the park gate.  The park has a number of shows in huge auditoria and 3 main rides.  It also has what it claims to be the world's largest aquarium.  The latter was the best I've seen with whale sharks, multiple rays, Chinese sturgeon and numerous other weird and wonderful fish.  There are also various types of penguins in a chilled environment and some bears which was the saddest part of the day; they didn't look thrilled to be there.  There were no queues for any of the rides, unlike every other park I've been to, so one could easily stroll in.  Within one afternoon I saw a sea lion show, a 5D cinematic experience (with air and water blown into your face as the seats move with the movie), a beluga whale show and rode two rides (definitely too scary for small children).  The Walrus Splash which is fast and wet and the Parrot Coaster which is fast and upside down in parts.  Both were pretty impressive but not appropriate for small kids either.  There are loads of restaurants and gift shops in the park and prices weren't outrageous.  Leaving the park after 5 hours I easily caught a bus to Zhuhai railway station which took 45 minutes and cost Rmb20.  From there I walked through the border gate at Gongbei and into Macau where the free casino buses were waiting to take me back to Cotai.  I took the long route but I wanted to see how easy it was to travel around Hengquin.  It was a breeze and for your information I sadly don't speak any Mandarin.."
Biggest aquarium in the world,"We reached at 1.30pm and it was really hot.Luckily, it was the Halloween special tickets and the park hours were extended til 11pm, if not we won't be able to complete the whole park.We only managed to see all the 4 shows + 5D ride by late evening only.The park had many animals that were not common. (Note Artic animals: Wolves, emperor penguins etc) It was a little worrying for one of the polar bears though.You could tell the Chinese had a large budget in maintaining the aquariums, educating public on the many interesting animals and also the fireworks at night was around 10mins long.We didnt have enough time to take the rides but it looked really amazing.Queue time was only less than 5mins. The longest queue time was only 20mins. (which is really short if you compare it to other theme parks in the world)Food was meh though. Although such quality was already anticipated but really, it was worse than expected.I would recommend going early in the morning and staying in one of their hotels so that you can have a fun & enjoyable day trip without rushing to catch any bus/taxi back.We stayed in Macau came here as a day trip. If you do the same, DO NOT book the coach bus from studio city hotel. The chinese driver scolded our family because we were foreigners and our passport took way longer to get across the customs as compared to hk passports.Also, on the way back, the same coach driver left us stranded at the Zhuhai customs. We had to take the public bus back from zhuhai custom back to macau customs instead. (The coach service was a nightmare). But should you still visit Ocean Kingdom? Definitely!"
Comparable,"Comparable to Disneyland theme park and other popular internatonal theme parks, Ocean Kingdom is a pleasant surprise for our group of 20 family & friends visiting from Oct 28 to 30.  Their rides: Polar Coaster, Walrus Splash were just spectacular!  Their horror compound was very authentic. Many types of animales, different varieities particularly polar bears, penguins, sea animals made the theme park authentic.  Their Beluga, Dophin, Sea Lion shows are world-class!  For me personally, the only drawback is that the China people, or Natives (to term them accurately) are lacking in good manners.  Maybe that is part of their culture?  They push and push without minding courtesy in queuing. They do not follow the rule of NO SMOKING anywhere, although ""SMOKING"" areas are clearly noted in some corners.  They smoke anywhere and everywhere, while walking, while queuing, etc.  Another thing these natives cannot control is SPITTING ANYWHERE they like.  These two MAJOR, MAJOR drawbacks is what keep foreign tourists from considering any of the theme parks in China. But I guess they don't really need foreign tourists because just their own local tourists can already fill up their theme parks."
Great place to go with family BUT..,A good place to visit with your family (elderly and child-friendly).This place is a combination of a theme park and sea aquarium. Id say its more of a sea aquarium as there are not many cool rides although the animal exhibits are pretty cool.One thing that filled me with disgust is the polar bear exhibit. The polar bears repeatedly pace up-and-down the same path. By repeatedly -- I literally mean that they take the same steps and turn around at the exact same points. You can easily guess when they'd turn around and where theyd walk to. Heartbreaking to see the polar bears going mad from being locked up in a tiny enclosure. Made me wanted to leave the place immediately
Great family getaway,Went to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom during the golden week for a family getaway during the mid-term break. To our surprise it was not crowded and we had easy access to all the rides. The kids loved the rides and also the shows and it was also an educational experience where they could see the animals. Enjoyment for the whole family and we will definitely be back
"Lots to see and do, but with moral drawbacks","Ok so there are some great rides, two of which will leave you very wet. Still they're a lot of fun, and great for the kids, and the more daring adults (yes I am one of those). There is also a lot of wildlife in captivity, which is great for people who wish to see a variety of animals from around the world. This though is where morality kicks in, for me at least. The polar bears are each in separated enclosures and with such limited space they spend their time anxiously pacing up and down. Around the corner are the arctic wolves. The pups were separated from the adults, and again the wolves has a horribly limited space which is ill suited to an animal that can walk for endless miles. The beluga whales seemed happy enough being part of a show, though it is a wonder when they will say 'So long and thanks for all the fish'. Many visitors spend their time poking at the rays and trying to catch fish in their hands. If they were stingrays it could have proven to be more of a fair deal, but all in all I felt for the majority of animals held in such a limited space, whist much more space has been allocated to house several hotels, rides, and pretty poor fast food restaurants. As a theme park this would be good, and certainly is, but the animals just seem a little less than pleased to be cramped between rides, and I cannot blame them for that."
Chonglong are my favourite place,I guess it's kind of hard to explain my love for roller coasters.  Roller Coaster of Chonglong  It's too exciting! I couldn't help praising it. There were kinds of fish and Seals.
Adorable but exciting experience to visit Hengqin Chimelong Ocean Kingdom,It is a wonderful place to visit many kinds of animals underwater and experience various activities as well as fabulous performances. It really was a must-see attraction when pay a visit to Zhuhai.
Best Theme Park,"Chimelong Ocean Kingdom is a nice theme park in Zhuhai. A different ride makes a day. One full day is a good for Ocean Kingdom. Every Day Parade, Jet Board, make your day in night before closing fire show give you wow feeling."
"""A good place to visit"" ",Last May 27 we went to China. May 28 we took a visit to chime long ocean kingdom because it was a 5 minute walk from the penguin hotel. It was a very nice place with many rides and attractions good for kids and adults alike. We got there as soon as the park opened and made it to the first 4D show. It was very nice and was appropriate for children. Next we went on a few rides and experienced long and short lines. Throughout the lines there are fans which help keep you cool. Next we had lunch in an air conditioned cafe and had the pizza. It was a Hawaiian pizza. I usually don't get Hawaiian pizza but this one looked so good I wanted to try it. I wasn't disappointed by the taste. Next we watched the parade and sadly we had to leave since our tour only allowed us to stay until 3:00pm.
Pleasant Surprise! ,"Visited in May.  We all had a great time with the kids, and I can't fault the place.  If you have been to Ocean Park in Hong Kong, then this is kind of similar but  it is newer, more modern and technologically advanced.  We were pretty surprised as it was very clean and well managed. Staff are friendly enough and efficient. The park is large but easy to navigate and show times were displayed well.  Must see the Beluga and Dolphin Shows where there is lovely air conditioning!  (It was so hot when we were there).  Actually, every show we saw was worth going to, like the afternoon water-show where the jet skis did a fab job with people doing all sorts like Iron Man! I'm glad we made an effort to see the firework display/show in the evening- spectacular!  Don't miss it! The kids fed the bears (you have to pay extra for cups of veggies but it was reasonable).  However, I felt sorry for the polar bears and the wolves/dogs because the spaces they are kept in are so contained.  I feel this needs to be reviewed by management and having them behind glass for viewing didn't add any value to our visit.   The Aquarium was amazing and a must see.  We didn't get around to seeing everything.  The prices for food and souvenirs are in line with other theme parks and cheaper than Disneyland, I think.  The rides that we did go on were fun and it has a good enough mix to entertain kids.  We would visit again as part of a package deal with hotel. A good weekend break!"
Not Cheap and amazing well organised amazement park,"Ocean Kingdom entry definitely can't consider as cheap, if compare to the rest of amazement park in China that is petty expensive.  We came to the park on Saturday Summer so it is full of people, may really suggest to come in weekday if visit next time.  The park is not as big as my thought, of course it is bigger than Hong Kong Disneyland but smaller than Ocean Park in Hong Kong.  The rest faculty is well organised and all leaflet print with English, too bad not the shows.  It position itself as a amazement park very similar to Ocean Park in Hong Kong.  In many way it has done a very good job with tons of fish and animal related to the ocean.  One thing I don't like is the place build and decorate for animal are not really for them, the decorate mostly are fake which only decorate for the audience.  Like the fake ice mountain and snow all build by plastic, cement and chemical printing."
Great theme park in South China,"We went there for 2 consecutive days at a weekend before most kids were on summer holidays to avoid the expectable crowds.  It worked but the crowds of visitors from Mainland China itself were more than expected anyway.  This is not a huge theme park when compared with most Disney Land parks and the Ocean Park of Hong Kong, but within this place I would suggest careful time management to maximise your enjoyment if you stay a night around for 1 night only.   Its world-record breaking Whale Shark Aquarium for whales, sharks and other sea creatures is a must-see, but we missed the chance to get into the restaurant there as a result of a wrong decision with respect to the arrival time at Hengqin about noon.  The polar bears, arctic foxes and wolves were good to see though some visitors may complain of inhumane enclosure of such animals.  However, that does appear to be the only kind of venue for viewing them safely without visiting their natural homes for a huge traveling cost.   Emperor penguins (not king penguins which are found in the Falklands and sub-Antartica) which will normally cost us over US$65,000 to see near the South Pole and other smaller penguin species were all in front of us in a well designed building with good air-conditioning for visitors on hot summer days.  There were also other features like roller-coaster, pirate ship ride, boat ride, evening fireworks display and scheduled animal and performer shows and other animals like walruses which are attractions to customers.  This theme park is not huge but it is clean and the number of restaurants inside are adequate for visitors with supplemental eateries right outside it and in the 3 neighboring hotels.   As it will be quite time-consuming to travel back and forth between any hotel other than those three and Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, I would recommend paying a little more for one fo those three hotels in exchange for the convenience especially if you only stay there for one but not two nights.  Overall, this is a well managed park and much much larger than the two parks with the ocean and polar themes in Dalian.   I was impressed with the concept of construction of three hotels with different themes which are all linked to visitors' plan to visit this theme park for two or three consecutive days."
Poor animals in small enclosures,Could have done without seeing the polar bears and wolves. Such a sad life they are leading adequate enclosures for other animals. Good diversity of exhibits.
Even better than Disney Land!!,"This is by far my favourite theme park in the world and I've done a lot of them! Chimelong Ocean Kingdom caters for everyone, there are fantastic shows and great rides- a must for anyone visiting Zhuhai. My two teenage daughters favourite ride is by far the battle of the pirates where you are having a water fight with those on the ride with you. Would recommend staying at one of the hotels on site and going there for 2 days in order to cover all of the attractions- my favourite hotels are the Henquin Bay Hotel and the Penguin Hotel."
Great Ocean & Adventure park,"In many ways, this unique Ocean and Adventure Park sets a new standard for the Greater South China area. Aquariums are huge and feature a very large diversity of fish including different rays and sharks. Yes it is not cheap but we felt it provides value for money. Even though we visited during a weekend the majority of the queues were not very long, despite the fact that the Park appeared to be quite busy. There are a number of quality rides available for all ages plus a twice-daily parade with large floats and international entertainers and dancers. It's all about the ocean theme so expect to see shows with different sea creatures and mammals. Great place for families and kids of all ages, very clean and friendly and smiling staff all about. Lots to do and see to fill an entire day's itinerary, great learning experience for the young ones on how to protect the environment and take care of our oceans."
Good but pricey,Went on a Sunday and wasn't too crowded. Waited around 10 minutes for the roller coaster and log flume which were both really good. The aquarium is impressive. The shows I saw were a bit slow but worth catching. I thought CNY380 per adult was a bit too much though. Once you're in the food is bad and expensive (CNY 60-80 for a bit of fast food). If you can get a better deal on tickets it's worth a go.
Somewhere unique,"We went there last year and enjoyed all shows and exhibits, especially the firework at night.  We stayed in their Oceanic themed Hengqin Bay hotel and spent few hours in the waterpark.  It is definiately a wonderful place for all ages, especially for family with kids.  My daughter just love it and surely will come again as it is just 30 mins from Macau by bus."
Very nice ocean park!! ,"Amazing and big ocean kingdom! Lots to do and see, and very very spacious too! My family and I went when there were not so many people, but the park had a lot of space to walk around. The park was also very clean and the toilets were very nice! Souvenir shops were also very tempting! Would definitely recommend for a day trip with family and friends!"
nice,My kids loved the theme park rides. Just make sure you wear comfy shoes bec it's quite big. Take note of the show schedules so you can watch most if not all of them. Make the most out of it ride everything. Price kinda high for me though. Oh they're strict with kid's height just a bit over 150cm is adult price already.
Seaworld on Steroids,"Chimelong Ocean Kingdom is the best aquarium or ocean themed amusement park I have ever been to. The park is laid out in a manner in which you can visit all the areas without having to double back.  I was slightly concerned that we may not see some of the animals due to the size of their enclosures. Though not ocean themed, I really liked the Wolf and Polar bear enclosures."
Well organized theme park,"Having never been to a Disney theme, this is what I would hope they would be similar to. Compared to the size of typical theme parks in the USA, I would consider Ocean Kingdom to be mid-sized park, but offers a great variety of shows and activities that make it well worth the money. Offering everything from the very impressive aquarium, aquatic shows, wildlife displays, parades, kids and adult amusement rides, plan on spending the entire day at the park. At park closing each day there is a very impressive, beautifully choreographed fireworks, laser, light, fire and water acrobat show - be sure not to miss it."
animals looked really unhappy,"I felt sorry for the animals , polar bears in a small cage pacing backwards and forwards bored stiff with no real snow and windows allll around them so they couldn't escape the crowd , same with all the other animals, the brown bears outside also looked distressed ,I just walked passed it all couldn't stand there starring at the poor animals , also the large whales in that small tank there were far too many large whales for a tank that size  , just left feeling rather sad really"
"Awesome fun, watch out Disney!","This is simply one of the best theme parks ever. You'll be driven crazy by screaming children (and I do mean screaming!), but the rides are fun and the water shows amazing. If in southern China or Macau make sure you spend at least a day there."
Big place with lots of things to see....,Went with my wife n 3 years old daughter. My daughter liked the polar bears n penguins exhibition. We were hugely entertained by the beluga show. Unfortunately the shows are only conducted in Chinese as 99% of its visitors are locals. Food is expensive inside n they check your bags at the entrance for any food. We had our dinner at the restaurant with the view of whale shark aquarium. The good taste good but the price is very steep. Although it compensate back with the wonderful view of the aquarium. All the fishes n whale sharks swimming by as you are chewing down your food. Sad to say we didn't managed to catch the Dolphins show. But the fireworks at night was greatly entertaining with aerobatic water jets n fireworks going off from the jet skis. It is a huge place with lots of things to see for all ages. They have those thrill rides too which we didn't take.
Amazing Aquarium,"The title says it all! The aquarium is spectacular. I'm not sure what was better, seeing it for the first time after walking into the room, or getting up close and personal...The queues for the rides were pretty short, which made life much easier. However, the shows were not as frequent as I would have liked. We found it was impossible to do everything in one day without rushing around."
First class theme park,"This is a beautiful theme park with a number of amazing features. The giant manta and video aquarium on the ceiling of the entrance pavillion are stunning. The flume ride glides past real bears. The giant whale shark flying into the air is only bested by the enormously humongous aquarium that has something like five real whale sharks swimming inside. Parrot Coaster is a great B&M wing rider. Some of the theming is fantastic. Not a ton of rides, but some decent ones, and there are lots of interesting animal exhibits. Get there while it's new, before they let it rot (as is the fate of a lot of other Chinese theme parks)."
Huge park,Huge park and at least need to there for 1 day. with the show in the later afternoon. this is the place worth go to.
Impressively Big and well-managed,"Transportation- I stayed at the Chimelong HengQin Bay Hotel and hence, they provide shuttle bus services to the Ocean Kingdom which is like 5-8 mins away. Pricing- Competitively priced with the Disney/Universal Studios...Time of travel- 21st to 25th April - wet. It rained everyday with occassional showers throughout the day. Bring raincoat, though they have many restaurants inside to provide shelter.Staff in Park- Most of them cannot speak English. I can understand that as mostly are local people making up the customers- Most of them are polite and friendlyCleanliness- Very clean. Same goes to the washroomsRecommended sites within the park:- Whaleshark aquarium: Super impressive with 4 whale sharks swimming freely inside. World's largest tank aquarium as of now.- Beluga whale show: Well orchestrated show and I love these intelligent mammals. The only part which I didn't like is for the trainers to stand on the them.Food- variety and quality was okay.Others- Was impressed that they enforced sanitization of hands for feeding the animals- Big in conservation programs"
Fantastic place for all ages,"We bought a ticket which allows two consecutive days access to the Ocean Kingdom. We could take our time to see each sections of the park, saw all the awesome shows, saw the animals during feeding times, all very interesting. Some rides are great fun if you like exciting rides. The meals in the park were not good, better to eat outside the park where there is a food street or go to one of the eateries in a hotel, better quality and value for money!"
Aquarium in  zhuhai,"Aquarium usually tour must arrive at the place, but I suggest go with your family or friends. And I highly recommend everyone must go to visit the aquarium. Is said to be the world's largest aquarium marine animals, the aquarium aquarium particularly large, raising some tropical fish variety, visit the descending road, look at the fish in the upper reaches of the water, and then look at the fish in the water, surface point of view, you can see colorful fish, the water watching to see when the fish swim fast swing tail, I told his son: power forward of the fish in the fish tail. The most surprised us is here to see a huge devil fish, we have seen the movie ""Finding Nemo"" clownfish Nemo movie Devil Rays is sitting back to class, a huge bird devil fish tail is particularly long my son said: Stingray perhaps by the length of the tail to calculate the age of it. As sharks living in the deepest places, we have been here to see colorful tropical fish, all those gray not slip marsh looks weird fish."
Amazing Aquarium - well worth the trip,"The Chimelong group has plenty of experience with amazing theme parks and does this one exceedingly well. It has been open 2 years and has been built on farmland just opposite Macau on the Chinese mainland.  They have 5 Guiness World Records for the one enclosure which has 8 whale sharks in it.  The tank is absolutely huge, the viewing windows and domed tunnels through it are also huge and the ability to see the wide variety of marine life is very good.  Whale sharks grow to a massive size, so I wonder how this will be in years to come as clearly these ones are babies, but it is fascinating to see them, but I did wonder about the efficacy of having them in a tank.There are lots of other marine animals - polar bears, penguins, beluga whales, seals, dolphins and numerous shows in purpose built aquatic theatres that seat 1500 people at a time.  Additionally there are several rides here - most of them feature you getting wet!  Avoid the weekend and any golden week and you will manage to see the park in a day, though at peak times you would need two days because of the queues involved.  There is a discounted ticket for the second day available."
Fantastic Ocean Travel,"Chang Long amusement park is a theme  park which combine the animal park and amusement facility together. This weekend I went to here with my friends, Chang Long don not let us down and brought us a fantasy experience in our holiday. We departed at Macau and got through to Zhuhai at Heng Qin, Chang Long also located at Heng Qin. The ticket was a little bit high for students. When we got in the theme park, we could see a huge hook face screen beyond us show the ocean scenery, which emphasize its theme—Ocean.  The animal who living in this park seemed very happy because their living environment was extreme well. Two polar bears had a area covered with snow and a big pool which was filled with sea water. They enjoyed their home happily and visitors could observed them below the pool which wall was built with thick glass, that made you feel like you were staying within the sea. Then we played the roller coaster which is called Green Parrot, it was so exciting that my friends and I all screamed for the whole period.:). It was really like a flying parrot, upwards and downwards. We also touched some sea animals in the Touch Pool gently, they were all feel smooth and lovely."
Best Ocean Park,The aquarium here is massive and houses 4 whale sharks.  Also a good selection of other animals in interesting habitats.  It just blows away anything else out there.  The 5D movie was also amazing.  Recommend going in the middle of the week to avoid crowds also worth staying for the firework show.
Great place to visit,"Nice place, a little on the expensive side, but a definite place to go when visiting Zhuhai.  Many things to do and lots of food variety to chose from throughout the day."
Better than I expected,"First of all, make sure you temper your expectations.  It's an aquarium.  That said, it's an aquarium with a few additional amusements, such as carnival rides, and a couple of roller coasters.  The whale sharks are absolutely amazing, and my kids loved the giant overhead screen when you first walk in.  Food was decent, but you absolutely must have lunch/dinner at the Ocean Beauty restaurant right under the giant whale shark.  The restaurant is actually built out from the aquarium with big viewing windows along one side of the restaurant.  The whale sharks and other marine life swim by constantly while you're eating, and it's a beautiful sight.  It's not the most diverse aquarium I've ever been to.  The tank is certainly large, but the marine life isn't the most diverse I've ever seen.  The whale sharks do a lot to compensate for that though.  The beauty of Ocean Kingdom is that there's a lot to do for almost everyone.  From rides to coasters to shows, aquarium and animal exhibits, it's quite a full day, or even two!  Like I said, temper your expectations.  You're going to an aquarium that just happens to have extras!  Not the most amazing aquarium I've ever been to, but certainly the most entertaining!Heght restrictions are STRICTLY enforced, kids under 1 meter gets in free although they can't ride much."
Love the place,"Arrived by bus from Shenzen. Ocean Kingdom is like a bigger Ocean Park sans the rollercoasters and cable cars. If you like marine life - this is the place to go! They even have a separate area for brown bears and polar bears. The humongous whale shark tank is a site to behold. Kids will love it, plus there's a play/ fun area for smaller kids, Whole day affair.   And they are very strict with the height requirement."
Guinness record holding tanks with 4 - 5 whale sharks,"This park is definitely worth a trip to Zhuhai. It is easy to get there from either Macau or Hong Kong. It took me about 1.5 hours to get from Macau to the Penguin hotel that is next to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom.There are many different themes within the park, dolphin, penguin, polar bears, etc. This design helps to spread the crowds and most of the sights are not too crowded. The only time when I really felt the crowd was at the 4D movie but I would say this is due to poor planning.I was there on a Saturday and there was a parade and firework display in the evening.My only complaint is the occasional people who cut queue."
"Great time, ocean animals & many attractions","Great park, many animals both interesting & spectacular, many rides & attractions, great scenic landscaping, lots of visual interest, helpful staff.Cons: food middling & costly."
Refreshing experience,"I have been to Gz chime long...This is the first time went to Zhuhai Chimelong.Amazing experience...Place is just at the border of Macau,One can actually sea some of casinos of Macau from the road...Lot of this to entertain un self ...if you just want to relax and do nothing...I liked the food here...They have three different hotels in same place take your pick...I stayed in the most expensive Ocean hotel..looks like a casino from inside...so Lavish it is.Must say,worth visiting the place"
It's a WOW!,Great theme park experience. Very huge indeed to walk around. Amazing and very impressive aquarium. Enjoyed all the shows especially the Beluga show and the 5D Theater experience. The whole theme park was found to be very exciting. You need two days to enjoy the whole area.
Full day event.,We visited Nov 2014. Overcrowded but worth it to see.  Biggest aqarium around.  I didn't go on any of the roller coaster rides.  For us we went to see the animals.
"Terrible service, Empty Park but interesting animals","Lovely aquarium and animals on display. However this park was eerily empty even during holiday season - with most of their customers coming from tour groups. Unfortunately our visit was soured by the exceptionally rude staffs at the entrance. Having purchased our tickets at their Chimelong hotel we stayed at, the entrance staff had initially refused us entry as we had apparently breached their park rules - by purchasing the wrong tickets and demanded to know where we had bought it! They're not very inviting to foreign customers. Be very wary if you wish to go..."
Tourism,Nice little zoo and interesting walk. We enjoyed our day here. My wife had never had an opportunity to see most of the animals before and really enjoyed the experience.
Recommended for a day full of adventure and excitement,"Having visited Ocean park in Hong Kong, wasn't sure of the place initially but really happy with the decision now.  All Animal exhibits are neat and well designed with good viewing angles providing both surface and under water experience simultaneously.  All of the theatres are huge in size with exciting shows esp. the beluga whale Show. Although the shows are conducted in chinese still understanding the context isn't difficult. Huge screens are also put up in the theatres adding to the viewing experience. Night fireworks are the icing on the cake. Haven't  seen anything like that ever before. It is a must watch and is the highlight of the park.There are only 2 rides in the park which is a little setback but with plenty of other options to offer it doesn't disappoint at the end of day. Finally enamored with the entrance of the park,  designed with a huge overhead screen, feels like a truly wonderland."
"Just want to say something, maybe helpful if you are heading here.","1) Avoid weekend or special promotion days 2) There are 4 whale sharks now, more than just opened 3) Food and drinks are expensive, they will search your bags and throw away your food stuff 4) new Buluga show is nice 5) buy a disposable poncho outside as its cheaper if you want to do the rides 6) if you are not with your group and interested in the finale show, forget about the shuttle back to Zhuhai, just queue for the public bus, around 3 to 4 services with many buses that head straight to the under ground shopping centre at Gongbei crossing. That's all folks. One last thing, if you are an animal rights supporter, don't even go to the park. They will never listen."
Animals should be in the wild not In a shopping mall,Polar bears have no natural light and are bored to death they have no stimulation and appear bored out their mindsThe wolves the Same. These animals should be in the wild not looked up In a glass prison for people to take photos
"Well organised,clean and stroller/handicapped accessible theme park ","As with most of the places of interest in China, the one thing thrat always worries me is the cleanliness of the bathroom. That was not the case here. All areas are very clean and the theme park was well organised. The theme park is smaller than sea world, have some rides and plenty of shows (hence, suitable for kids and adults). The shows were a tad lacklustre but since this is a new theme park, I am confident it will improve with times. I do enjoy the circus show and the fireworks show. A must see if you go there. As far as food and beverage goes, there is a huge buffet on the 1st floor and street food (ground floor) at the hotel next to the theme park( didn't know the name of the hotel  but it has penguins theme all over) besides the usual theme park junk food. There is a wheelchair and stroller rental at the entrance after they scanned your ticket. The park is handicapped accessible. Another big plus as it is a rarity in China. There are seats in front for wheelchair bound visitors so they don't have to climb the stairs to the stadium seating for all the shows.There are three hotels inside the resort. If it is fully booked, the Sheraton Zhuhai offered free shuttle service to the theme park for their hotel guest (about 20 mins drive).A great place to visit for all ages."
Great!! theme park (World Class) A great day here.,"Recommended to visit this theme park. One of the world’s largest aquariums with Polar bear, Beluga, penguins.. etc.แนะนำให้ลองไป แปลกใหม่ มีมาตรฐานสากล มีทั้งสวนน้ำ สวนสนุก เครื่องเล่นต่างๆ มีอควาเลียม และสัตว์เมืองหนาวให้ชม"
"great animals, aweful park management.","Pros: Truly, the animal experience was exceptional. The shark whale, the beluga, the turtle and the polar bear exhibits were outstanding. Aquariums were all clean and despite looking small for some animals, the animals looked in good conditions. The park opens late but closes very late too ! (9:30am-9pm)Cons: it's half an amusement park, with very little scientific information on the animals and stores to sell you souvenirs or food every 30 meters. Speakers were extremely loud in 75% of the park, definitely not healthy ( I got headache in the first hour after arriving). And it's a park for children ! Price was prohibitive: entrance 400 RMB and the food inside is way overpriced (but good!). Outside food is not allowed in the park.Be careful that the park is very far from downtown (100 RMB taxi min.) and don't come on Chinese new year like we did!  it was overcrowded in some exhibits and for the animal shows. And Chinese tourists can be... you know.Mixed feelings overall."
Exciting place,In park restaurant and foods is suck. Expensive and not tasteful. The game arrangement is good even in peak season we won't need spend too much time on line up.
Great place for a day of fun,Great selection of rides and animals/fish. The main aquarium is impressive. Try to be there to see when they feed the big whale sharks.
Chimelong Ocean Kingdom,Great Performances and Largest Acquarium.  Good for families and especially kids.  The rides and games are also exciting
Impressive theme park,"Nice place to stay for full day with your family. Be sure you will have a comfortable shoes because you will walk more than 10km. There is plenty of restaurants but mostly kind of ""chinese"" food and definitely overpriced for the quality. Spend a few minutes with a park's map to make a ""plan"" what you want to see. During warm days there is an opportunity to swim with dolphins and for kids is a life experience."
Amazing day at Chimelong Ocean Kingdom,"Located at Chimelong International Ocean Resort in Hengqin, Zhuhai, Chimelong Ocean Kingdom features one of the world's largest aquariums, allowing guests to view the rare whale shark, beluga whales, polar bears, and other adorable animals up close! This Theme Park is world-class and should not be missed if you are at Macau or Zhuhai.We are a group of 14 people with family and friends visited this theme park during Christmas holidays and the place is similar in size as HK Disneyland.  The place was not crowded as compared to HK Disneyland or HK Ocean Park. Overall the staff was friendly and the place is clean.  Christmas music was playing all the time which created a good Christmas spirit for everyone there.We only watched the beluga show which was really good.  There were 8 belugas which were extremely talented and the show was very entertaining. We visited the Whale Shark Aquarium which was very impressive and huge with 4 whale sharks.  We also saw the polar bear and penguin exhibits which were nice. We tried the Deep Sea Odyssey ride which was fun for the whole family and the ride will travel inside the Whale Shark Aquarium.Food like any other theme park which was very expensive costing over RMB $80/meal.  They do inspect your bags for food before entering the park so bringing food is not allowed.We did not go on to the rides as most rides need to wait about 30-60min depending on the popularity.Chimelong had spent lots of money and wanted to have a world class theme park and I think they have done it.  We had an amazing time and definitely will come back again."
A World Class Theme Park - Definitely Worth A Visit!,"The place we probably thoroughly enjoyed in Zhu Hai and where you would want to spend at least one full day is the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom. Comparable to and newer than Singapore’s Universal Studios and way better than Hong Kong’s tired Ocean Park, the Ocean Kingdom has all the song and dance of a Disneyland entourage of performances, parades and shows plus roller coaster fun and water rides. Connected to this attraction are 3 hotels that also sell packages for entry and within the same compound of hotel and theme park, is another attraction called the Chimelong International Circus City which has an award winning circus act. We had no time to explore this one but will definitely save it for a next visit.The park features one of the world’s largest aquariums with whale sharks, beluga whales, polar bears, penguins and arctic wolves and has been pegged as a world class destination that I would say rivals most of Asia’s theme parks (including the one we have in Singapore)There are 8 themed zones within the park – Ocean Avenue, Dolphin Cove, Amazing Amazon,  Ocean Beauty, Polar Horizon, Fun Zone, Mount Walrus and the Hengqin Ocean. With each there are theatrical performances, animal performances and rides. Also food and souvenir stores. Basic tickets start at RMB350. Download the park map here.Must do ride – try the Amazing Amazon that features one of the world’s longest roller coasters with a 1,300-metre track reaching as high as 20 storeys, the roller coaster is really a thrill seeker’s dream especially if you enjoy being looped in and out upside down! For more to do and see in Zhu Hai - just google ""3 Great Places To Visit With Kids In Zhu Hai China"" or ""Simply Fabulicious"""
World Class!,"You won't know how amazing it is until you pay a visit!  After I went to the Aquarium in Singapore, I thought there's no need to visit others.  By now, I know I was wrong.It's so much fun here, a theme park plus aquarium.  We 4 stayed in the Penguin Hotel next to it and only entered into this ""Chimelong Ocean Kingdom"" at 4pm.  No queues everywhere.  What welcomes you at the entrance is the long and big ceiling LED screen.  I saw it only in Les Vegas USA!  There are so many things to see and games to play and we could only try about 40% of the facilities before we rushed back to the hotel for buffet dinner as we were all exhausted.The entrance ticket allows you to visit the place for 2 consecutive days.  So, in the next morning, we went back to the park but this time, huge groups of people and afterall we had only visited 60% of the place before we had to catch the 2pm bus to Macau.  WE WILL BE BACK!!!"
Amazing 😍 But some comments 😁,"I was really really impressed by the architecture of this hotel and everything and yes. It's an amazing hotel. I would have give it a 5 star rate, but I saw two things which are disappointing and I would like to point them out. First of all, there is this beautiful but very small dolphin pool near the hotel. There are 3 dolphins, sharing the pool with so many turtles in the same pool. I would like to point out, do they swap the dolphins? do they give them more space to swim than THAT small pool? moving on to the other question, so the aquarium educates school students about loving animals, taking care of our environment etc., but the hotel is serving shark fin soup? Uh what? Please. Seriously, the management should do something about this. THIS is very serious. You're telling little kids and even teenagers like me to take care of the environment but you're still letting your hotels serve shark fin? Please consider this. On a lighter note, I loved the hotel and I loved the park. It was picture perfect for me, sorry if I was directing the issue too harshly, I just couldn't bear to see the waiters serving literally 10 trays of shark fin soups walking past me. It's wrong. But overall, this is the ideal destination for you and your family 😁 very great, but there's room for improvements! 4 stars from me, 1 star lost because of the issues. But sending much love, I love this place, and would be back soon. I'd have to give credit also to the characters walking around in the hotel restaurant, they were amazing with people and kids. They said hi to everyone whom walked past and continued to greet people even some of them didn't bother to say it back. One character took it to the extend that he took a child to get some candies and drinks, and I couldn't help but smile to. What a way to make our night!! And Kiki played hide a seek with a girl while Kaka peeked through a window to wave hi to a teenager. Respect because they have so much passion and love for the visitors!!"
Amazing as far as aquariums go,"You can´t go any better when it comes to an Aquarium. The rollercoaster is a treat as well. Access is great, they have regular buses from the frontier with Macau and also the train station. However, I did find it a bit expensive and crowded. Went there on a hot day and besides the crowd, everyone was using an umbrella which made it hard to walk about without getting poked in the eye. The food choice was a bit lacking, but otherwise, a great day out in Zhuhai."
"Chimelong is world class, it is better than expected","I have heard some very good reviews about Chimelong and decided to come with my wife for my birthday. We bought a package with a HK travel agent that includes two day park entry tickets, Penguin Hotel stay, buffet dinner for two and Cotai Jet return tickets for two.Rather significantly, we did not have the Cotai ferry terminal transfer to Chimelong and when we asked CTS about it they said they had no places for us until two hours later. Thinking back we should have made the trip ourselves but we waited instead. So when you buy your package, make sure either you have tickets for this connection or be prepared to travel there on your own.The trip from Macau to Chimelong took about an hour including all the customs clearing. We arrived at Penguin Hotel about 3:15pm. We checked in at the Penguin Hotel and got our park tickets. Good thing about Penguin Hotel is that it is within walking distance of the park entrance. We entered the park at about 4pm. We got the park guides (English guides are available, Entertainment schedule are in both English and Chinese). The first thing we did was the Dolphin show. The show is in a big stadium and the decoration of the stage looks rather impressive. But the show was not great with only a few dolphins on show. The stage was more impressive than the show.We did the Deep Sea Odyssey ride which was fun. It actually traveled inside the Whale Shark Aquarium and our vehicle moved along at the same time as a large grouper. We liked this ride and rode it again the next day.Whale Shark Aquarium is super impressive in terms of size. It proudly displays the five Guinness World Records at its entrance. The aquarium is big and it houses FOUR whale sharks. I know both Ocean Park in Hong Kong and SEA Aquarium in Singapore wanted these sharks but neither can get hold of any.There is also the beluga exhibit and these whales are really cute. Sadly the beluga show is full so we have to come back the next day. It was also raining slightly at this time, so we went back to the hotel for the buffet dinner at about 6:45pm.We returned the next day and went to Castle 5D Theatre for Kaka's Great Adventure. This is a 3D film with movable chairs, water spray and smoke effects. But they have not yet learnt the art of subtlety and the show is full on vibrating, water spraying and smoke ALL THE TIME. There is also no humour in this show. It is a full on attack on the senses.We did the sea lion show and the beluga show afterwards which are much better than the dolphin show. The beluga show is particularly good with eight belugas on show. Even the pre-show of the beluga show with dolphins was better than the actual dolphin show.We had lunch outside the beluga show. I had chicken chop rice (RMB48) while my wife had chicken chop burger (RMB25), we ordered a coffee (RMB15) as well. The food was okay and the coffee came already with milk and sugar, Chinese style. I think the park can really do with a proper Starbucks style cafe.We then saw the polar bear and penguin exhibits. Afterwards we saw the Chimelong Ocean Parade, the manatee exhibit and the Sky board spectacular. All of them are interesting and well created. We left the park at about 4:30pm because we need to get back to HK early.It is clear that Chimelong has thrown a lot of money at this park. It aimed for Disney/Universal standards and it is almost there. Customer service is surprisingly good and cleanliness is quite good for a Chinese park. My wife complained that one bathroom was smelly but that was just the one. It is really worth a visit if you are not an animal welfare activist."
Great variety of sea animals,"This is a great theme park, not as big nor as crowded like the Chimelong safari in Panyu. The whale sharks and the white whales are impressive but the place is not easy to navigate. The catering facilities are also overpriced and lacked variety. Would recommend eating out in one of the three surrounding hotel restaurants."
Nice & Clean Amusement Park!,"This park is an amazing place to visit and there are many rides and attractions especially for the kids. Before entering the park, please make sure to pick up the time schedule for all the shows and animal feeding times of the day at the entrance.The 3 shows (Sea Lions, Dolphins and Beluga Whales) were impressive and well organized. Shouldn't miss another 5D show at 5D Theater too.The Whale shark Aquarium was another place definitely worth visiting. It is the largest aquarium window in the world certified by the Guinness World of Records!The ""Dance of the Starry Night"", the spectacular fireworks, fountain and the jet ski & fly board stunts performance at night before the closing time is definitely worth seeing."
Theme park that is a little confused about what it is,"My wife and I visited in December as part of a tour of southern china.  Here are the pluses:    - Good Quality Animal Shows (Sea Lions, Dolphins and Beluga Whales )  The animals seem well treated and the set up of the theater (stadium really) is such that the whole show doesn't have to rely on the animals.     - The Parrot Coaster looks like an Awesome inverted twisting coaster if you're into that kind of thing (we are not so didn't try it)  -  The screen under the Giant Manta ray is cool.    - The Light, fireworks, fountain, water hover board show at closing time is really worth seeing.==    The Negatives... First and foremost no food and drinks are allowed to be brought into the park... Not surprising for a theme park... HOWEVER what is surprising is that there are NO DRINKING fountains at all in the park and the water in the sinks is listed as being not potable.  This means lots of money spent on buying liquid.      We went on a Non Holiday Monday...  It was very crowded.. Very crowded.. I am Caucasian my wife a Filipina... Other than some apparently Russian performers and some of the trainers literally everyone else in the park appeared to be Chinese.     This was not a problem but you should be prepared.  My wife the ONLY Filipina... for her not a problem since everyone just assumed she was Chinese.     The crowds were not really a problem either,  they have designed the park well so the shows are in huge purpose built stadiums that can handle the crowds.   - The Bears --- We rode the polar explorer ride and on that got a glimpse of the bears... THAT was quite enough.  It was pretty clear that the bears were not happy and it was kind of sad.. I'd say skip that.  - TRANSPORTATION:   We took the K10 but to get there from the Holiday Inn Zhuhai... Took about 1.5 hours but is was easy, not overly crowded on the bus and it cost only 3 RMB.   We took K10 back as well and there were lots of buses and they limited the number of people on them so again comfortable and only 3RMB but... the buses only ran as far as the Macau, Zhuhai Gobei port station so we had to taxi the rest of the way.  Again not a problem."
Unclear way-finding,"Way-finding is chaotic.  Arrangement of shows not beneficial to viewing one after another, as shows happen here and there without coordination"
Much Better than Expected,"Take a piece of Disneyworld, mix in a bit of Universal, add a whole lot of Seaworld, and then supersize the entire thing - that, in a nutshell, is Chimelong Ocean Kingdom.  This park is far superior to any other theme park in China and far exceeded my expectations.  The highlights for me were the 5D theater (you can feel scarabs running up your legs!) and the ginormous shark acquarium.  The penguin enclosure is pretty cool too. Being from Hong Kong, a lot of people have asked me if Chimelong is like Ocean Park - no - this place is much better than Ocean Park - it's in a different league altogether.That being said, anyone who expects Disney quality bathrooms or cast members will be dissappointed.  This is still China.  However, it is a vast improvement over Chinese entertainment facilities of the past, and they are really trying to create an American theme park experience - all the way down to the ubquitous gift shops at the exit of every attraction. There are already a lot of reviews on the park, so I won't bore you by repeating a lot of the things that others have already said.  However, here are a few thoughts:1) At 9:45 am, about 15 minutes before the park opens, all of the furry mascots (there are a bunch of them - a turtle, shark, boy tiger, girl tiger, etc) all gather just outside of the park entrance for you to take photos with them.2) I stayed at the Hequin Bay Hotel - there are very few food choices there, especially before 11 am.  If you are staying there and don't want to pay for the buffet breakfast, head to the outside of the Penguin Hotel (about a 10 minute walk and next to the entrance of the Park). There are a number of fast food type outlets there that serve ok tasting and quite clean food at reasonable prices starting at about 8 am.3) getting to the park is no picnic, but it's not as complicated as it sounds. From Hong Kong, I took the Cotai jet, then transferred to the Sands Cotai Central free shuttle at the Cotai ferry terminal.  Once at the Sands, I transferred to the free Sands shuttle to the Lotus Port.  At the Lotus Port, pay 3 RMB to take the public bus across the bridge to the Zhuhai side of the border.  Clear immigration, and then either take a short taxi ride (should be less than 30 RMB) or public bus (2 RMB) that stops in front of the Chimelong Hotel.  This sounds awfully complicated - but I did it with an 80 year old and a 79 year old in tow and we were all in agreement that it was actually quite easy.  The key is that none of the shuttle/bus rides last more than a few minutes.  Door to door, the entire trip from the HK Ferry terminal to the Hequin Bay Hotel/Ocean Kingdom should take between 90 to 120 minutes. (I went on a Monday in November and there were very few people - I would imagine that on weekends and public holidays, the crowds could be quite nasty).4) There is very little to no English spoken.  All of the shows are conducted in Mandarin.  I don't speak Mandarin, but could still figure out what was going on most of the time.  I did not find that the language barrier detracted from my enjoyment of the park.5) If you are sensitive about animal rights and welfare, you might want to give this park a miss.  The conditions are not horrible - more like Sea World in the 80's.  Again, by China standards, the conditions are super humane. However, if you think that all creatures should roam free in nature, you will not be happy with what you see.If you are staying in or around Hong Kong and have a day and a half to spare, the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom is not a bad option. I am glad that I went and really found it to be a pleasant surprise."
Big empty park,Very spacious park for people to walk about. Not much room for the animals to swim around. Sympathise the animals living in the enclosure. Not much fun rides. Did not realise brown bears and honey bears is related to the ocean and how it correlates to the ocean park theme. I wonder?
great place with a lot of animals however...,"man these animals were stuffed into the pools.   Compared to other places they pack double to triple the amount of animals into the exhibits.  I felt sorry for the grizzlie bears that basically looked like brown bears.Otherwise the whale shark exhibit was awesome, so cool seeing 4 of them, the viewing area is epic.My sons enjoyed the tv at the top the most..go figure"
Wonderful,"My husband and I visited this wonderful park, had a very nice day. Theres not much of people in there probably off season but still lots of entertainers ( mascots & face characters) parade is entertaining, all rides  were working some restaurants are closed, prices are reasonable, staff are very friendly. The only negative in there is the cab driver trying to gouged us. Ps. If your coming from macau using lotus bridge ride the bus no. K10 back and forth for 5rmb."
Excellent place to spend an entire day.  ,"Be aware of the timings of the shows.  Don't miss to pick up the timing chart for all the shows of the day at the entrance.  It will help you to plan properly which shows you can watch.  Be careful in planning because depending on the day you visit you have to plan some buffer time for each show to travel inside the big park as well as to stand in queue.  For example : if you plan a Beluga show at 3:30pm which lasts for 45min. You cannot plan a Dolphin show at 4:30pm since you have to walk in the park for 15min as well as consider the waiting time of queue. For me the best shows were dolphin show and the 5d show. Don't miss them. Sea walares and Beluga shows look little similar.  Prefer Beluga show.  If you are visiting  the park on weekends, do not try to go for rides.  You will miss a lot of shows and other exhibits in park.  Some rides like the walares ride will take almost 1hr to 2hrs.If you go with kids or elders ,  please take a trolley/wheelchair.  Carrying kids on your tummy or shoulders will be painful. Trolley facility is available there but we have taken our own."
So much fun for the family,"This is China, when they want to impress you, they make sure they go all out and then go all out a second time over!!It is an amazing place to visit and so many rides and attractions for the kids. My son enjoyed his 2 days here thoroughly to the point that he was exhausted haha.Unfortunately we were there in the summer which is stifling hot. Many of the attractions are outdoor so be prepared and carry loads of water.Maybe prioritise by doing more of the water rides which helps to cool down too.The aquarium is by far their best attraction, it is the largest in the word and brings a very obvious sense of amazement to every person that walks in and sees that almost never ending glass frontage.Advice on food - avoid eating at ""normal"" eating times as there is a massive rush of people in every food place which isnt the nicest buzz to be around if with kids :) also make sure you avoid dinner at any buffet places because you will miss a spectacular fireworks and water show which was our favourite part of the entire stay. Fireworks went on for ages and really was so big and immense that it could put some countries to shame for New Years celebrations haha.The circus is most definitely worth the visit, really fun and spectacular things going on, it does run a little late for kids - so be ready if your little ones are getting tired towards the end.Also, the circus is a LONG walk from Hengqin Bay hotel (where we stayed) so factor in a 20 minute walk at the least.We spent our 2 nights at Ocean Kingdom Hengqin Bay and had a themed room of the ocean, it was a very beautiful room but quite small in size. Kids bunk bed was shaped/themed as a ship which was cool :)"
Great Place,I found the 5D theatre a great treat. The other exhibits are also a great way we can learnt about the habitats of many sea and land animals.
A unique theme park.,"Do not book dinner buffet since you will miss some evening program of this theme park. You should not miss the feeding session of the white whale and polar bear especially the polar bear, you should try to watch it in lowest level of the building. The two program leaflets should be brought along with you.  Friendly staff in the tourist centre. He even help me to give phone call to my tourist guide to make a meeting point with me.  Interesting huge LED screen for selfie at the entrance which I enjoy much.  The parade is basic.  5D film show is very good, take a rear seat is good. Two days entrance just fit."
Good place to bring your kids,"As part of hotel room package you can have an earlier entry into ocean Kingdom at 9.30am. We entered after 10am and found there were no shows until 11.30am and they were all mainly in the afternoon. Good thing was there wasn't much of a crowd. The whale shark aquarium was definitely worth visiting. However, some of the other enclosures were too small for the amount of animals they had eg. Wolves, small sharks. One polar bear just kept walking back and forth in the same area. .. There were some rides and area for kids to play. Overall if you haven't been then it's good to go once."
Exaggeration ... Nah! this is the real thing,"When we first heard about this place, our thoughts were ... China ... hmmm sceptical about their standards as we had been to another Chimelong theme park near Punyi, Guangzhou. We read they had the World largest aquarium ... hmmm but boy were we proved wrong. Yeah, you heard right, they have the largest aquarium in the world and certified by Guiness World of Records. What more, they have four gigantic whale sharks in the tank. FOUR!!! imagine that. There you have it the highlight of the theme park. What else you may ask, ... beluga whales, penguins (and they have practically all the species), polar bears, plus everything else Sea World, San Diego (Well maybe they do not have the Killer Whale). Check out the photos if you think I was exaggerating."
Ocean Kingdom,We went on Tuesday and Wednesday which was a working week. The park was not crowded and could get to all the rides and shows without waiting for over ten minutes.The beluga show was impressive and well coordinated. Another not to miss is the evening fireworks and light show which is later in the evening. This was one of the most impressive shows we ever saw. The park itself is quite big so can easily spend two full days here. There are also some amusement attractions for larger kids like the two roller coasters. For smaller kids over 100cm there are some things as well which was quite nice.The whale shark aquarium was also gigantic. You can see all sorts of fish and manta rays. Well worth the price.
Amazing Aquarium and Water Show,"Near Macau is a huge family entertainment complex run by the Chimelong company. The centerpiece is the Ocean Kingdom aquarium. When you are first  enter you are welcomed by a majestic whale statue then a huge canopy with animated video of ocean scenes overhead. There are many excellent displays of exotic animals like manatee, beluga whales, whale shark, penguins, and polar bears. Of course there is an aquarium with the largest aquarium window in the world according to the Guinness World Records, a single acrylic panel measuring just under 130 ft. There is also an Aquarium ride, where you can look at the sea creatures close up while you ride in a conveyance. In addition there are thrill rides like Giant Flume, Bumper Cars and roller coaster type rides, we didn't ride those. We did ride a pirate ship water ride where the ship bobs around the water while riders shoot water guns at each other and onlookers shoot water at them; very fun and nice on a hot day. The newest attraction was a 5D movie on one of the largest curved screens in the world. It used three 3D projectors to display an animated film on a deeply curved screen with even some additional in theater effects. The story concerns some anthropomorphic animals saving a friend from danger, the finale is pretty cool.  There is also a colorful themed Parade; a fly board show (water jets attached to a performer's boots which shoots them up in the air over water, where they do flips and dives). And the finale of the night a spectacular show featuring fireworks, projections, lasers, jet ski and fly board stunts. Al kl in all extremely cool."
Ocean Theme Park,"Nice park, clean, with nice games and attractions! Very nice place to bring family and children. Loved the roller coaster, the Parrot Ride is simply too scary and very very exciting! Not a lot of food inside, advice to make a very good breakfast and bring some fruits. You will be too busy running around looking at things to eat!The hotels around are amazingly big and massive with rich buffets and good food.Nice place to go if you are nearby, strongly advice."
Impresive,Very nice place for team building activities. Very clean and well organized park. The food selection is not great. Wish to have better food choices.
Aquarium and amusement park,"This is a great place to bring children of all ages. The aquarium is awesome and the many animal themed areas are worth seeing. My favorite was the arctic wolves! You will need at least 4 hours (we were there when it wasn't too crowded) to see the whole park and that is not counting riding amusements like their superman-style (feet dangling) roller-coaster. But you could easily spend a couple days as they have the Penguin Hotel within walking distance. We also only saw one show (sea lion) which was pretty good although a little stuffy in the open-air theater. Most of the walking is outdoors so bring umbrella/sunscreen. Also, you may want to bring a light sweater as a couple of indoor venues like the penguin zone are quite cool."
Nice Theme Park,"Maybe it's a new park, the park is quite clean and easy access.  You will be able to see lots of sea creatures.  Kids will love this place.  But if you do not understand Mandarin it might be an issue as the shows are all in Mandarin.  Even the 5D show, it's all in Mandarin.Some disappointment after watching the 2nd show as the performance are quite similar.  Moving from Sea Lion to Dolphin to Whales, all performance are quite similar.  But it's really amazing watching the performance by the sea creatures."
Having a big whale of a time,"From Gongbei Undergound Plaza, near to the taxi stand, we waited for Public Bus No: K10 which reportedly would take us to Chimelong Sea Kingdom.  The bus fare is the standard CNY 3 and the journey takes about an hour.  Not a bad trip as we could sit in air-conditioned comfort looking out at the ever-changing landscape of Zhuhai. As soon as we arrived at Chimelong area, we could feel the fresh air and beautiful scenery.  On the left, is the beautiful Chimelong Hengqin Bay hotel which made the skyline looks much like a picture from story book.  On the right, which was where we walked to, is a rounded-shape dome - the Chimelong Circus Arena.  As we walked we marveled at the vast area this place of interest has.  A man-made canal winds from Chimelong Hotel to the Sea World.  Occasionally, we could see happy tourists on boats passing by....To cut the review shorter, the first impression was great.  We entered the entrance which looks like the mouth of a stink ray.  It was very picturesque as the ceiling of the entrance is a big screen, like the big screen in Beijing's ""The Place"". showing fishes, corals and colourful sea world. Below, they have their little tiger mascots posing with guests for pictures free of charge.  We were impressed by the huge blue whale sculpture and the pink Octopus, sitting on the roof of a building.  Big, big, big, everything was big.  The big sea world aquarium where many kinds of fishes swim around appears to be modeled after Singapore's Sea Aquarium in Sentosa.  However, the art works of the whole complex are more refreshing and beautiful.  The downside of this place is no place to sit and admire the fishes swimming around.  But they have an afternoon parade like those we saw at Disneyland in Hongkong...Beautiful.There are also a number of shows to catch up  such as Dolphins, sea lions and seals. But we had an unforgetable exciting experience with the 5D show.  Try it and you will agree with me."
Big theme park and easily can spend the whole day there,"Place is accessible by public transport. Many different bus services will reach the place. Big park. Purchase your tickets at the ticketing counter. There are people who came to us to sell tickets but as it looks dubious, we just went ahead to purchase at the official ticketing counter. Look at for the timing for parade and get a good spot for photo taking. Suitable rides for younger kids too. Prepare your own poncho if you don't want to get wet for some water rides. Very big underwater world aquarium. Be sure to queue and take the ride to go through the aquarium. There are many animal shows performances so be sure to be on time to get good seats. Enclosure for polar bears seems to be smaller and the polar bears seems to have restricted movement due to the space. Be there early as you can easily spend the whole day there."
Amazing aquarium and theme park!,"$10 billion buys a pretty nice park.  Very clean and full of amazing animals and architecture. Admission is 350 if you are >1.5m and 285 if you are <1.5m. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the captive bears, who are clearly not happy or healthy.  Do not go and see them."
Nice,"The facilities are relatively new and well maintained, don't expect the place is huge, since we picked a weekday to go there and there is no queue for game and it only take us half day to finished all games and show. The whale sharks aquarium is know as the biggest in the world for some Guinness record breaker which worth to take a look.For there is not bad with fair price which is good."
Enjoy the day there,Very big and nice theme park. The aquarium is very beautiful with large variety of marine creatures can be seen. The show of whales are fabulous.
The worst place on earth,Unspeakably awful dump with the worst hotels in the world. Only saving grace is the circus. The service is unfriendly when it exists at all. The restaurants do not stock anything on the menu!
Ocean Kingdom,"Chimelong Ocean Kingdom has the largest aquarium in Asia, you can view the whale shark, beluga whales, polar bears. Rides also allowance you to play with, like roller coaster, beluga whales. to watch the 5D film is a must."
"Great park, just avoid holidays and weekends","Chimelong ocean kingdom is a big big park featuring an aquarium / polar bears / beluga / penguin / dolphins and many rides just to name a few. Situated in Zhuhai it is easily accessible from Macau or Hong Kong.Everything is huge here. The aquarium was excellent and had 4 whale sharks there on our visit. Other exhibits were also very good. We did not try the rides as there were too many people and queues were very long. At the entrance there is a huge ceiling tv (not sure what to call it) which is stunning.Food is rather expensive, we had 4 burgers that totaled about $30. Also forget about coming here on holidays or weekends as it is packed with people and queues for everything is very long."
Got combination between playpark and aquarium/animal show,"It's a good park that combine about aquarium/animal show and playpark. And the park is clean, i impressed the staff is very quick to took the rubbish on the lane of aquarium. The animal look good seems well feed. See several thrilling attractions but unfortunately no have enough time to try it, I think need a full day to have all.I went on july, the weather so hot almost no wind. Don't forget to bring a hat, sunglasses, mini fan, and some change clothes (there's attraction could make wet and the hot weather)"
My kids loved it!,"My kids enjoyed the stay and had fun with the animal exhibits especially the 5d experience. The aquarium is a must see with its variety of species and its highlight which is the whale sharks. Not a lot of rides for the kids though since there is a height limit allowed for each ride. We only tried the walrus mountain which was really fun. The fireworks at night is also a nice feature of the park to watch since it shows a different kind of effects, it was just a bit of a disappointment since we didnt get to see the whole show coz it rained. I would recommend the park but not the hotel...."
nice,"we availed the family package which include a two day visit into the park and a night stay at their hotel and an entry at the circus. the theme park itself is fascinating, with the exhibits and shows worth watching...the whaleshark aquarium is superb!though they have limited rides, we only tried the walrus splash (water coaster), even my lil 7yr old enjoyed! we bought the raincoats for 15RMB each.the 5D show is a must try, it is located near the dolphin island. the 1.5hr circus is scheduled at 17:00 and 19:30, we had ours at the earlier show in order to watch the fireworks display at 20:30. the circus acts were just fine but not as spectacular as it may seem.food were not great throughout the two days, except for one - which was the ocean beauty restaurant just adjacent to the whale shark exbihit.. giving u direct visual to the aquarium as u dine (the tea however is a compulsary drink for 20RMB per head, rather than a complimentary).i suggest that each person brings his own water as each bottled h20 cost at RMB10 to RMB15 inside the park. what to expect:-huge crowd-long queues-heat during summer-toilets at 6/10 -limited rides-costly drinks/food and retails.. u may disagree with the polar bear exhibits as the animals are in small enclosures... sea animals... plenty to see ( whale sharks, belugas, manta rays, stingrays, penguins, walrus etc) ... found no orcas (subject due to criticism) nor piranha."
Similar park in HK,"THe park is very new, the environment is okay. However it seem like a mix with Ocean park and disneyland in HK. Like a copy theme park. But if you have time, you can go take a look in there."
Impressive! Animals in the shows seemed well contented,"We stayed in one of the resort hotels and had a two day pass to Ocean Kingdom as part of the package. My child was under 2, but really enjoyed seeing all the exhibits and shows. There isn't a lot of rides that the very little kids can go on, but this did not spoil our visit. The animal shows are not considered politically correct in the West anymore, but I find them fascinating and I closely observed the trainers with the younger animals at the edge of the line ups in the Beluga, Dolphin and Sealion shows who would sometimes do the tricks and sometimes decline and just watch the older animals in the centre of the line up do the trick. The trainers never admonished the non-performing animals, they only waited for their fish until the performers were fed first after each jump etc. All the animals seemed to have enough room and be well cared for except the bears who were quite obviously suffering from zoochosis in moderate or severe states. The bears seemed mostly fully grown and the park had just opened, so they must have adopted these bears from elsewhere, although really I think in this case those animals need to be put down as their suffering is clearly apparent. It is sadly the only, but very large black mark I have to put on Ocean Kingdom's scorecard.The smaller and main aquariums are impressive beyond belief. One has a 'glass' acrylic panel bigger than several tennis courts (A Guinness world record apparently). At one point you will have basking sharks and giant manta rays swimming over your head in a huge dome.Penguins exihibit is also fantastic, not only other worldly in terms of the underwater tunnels, but absolutely freezing cold and actually this is a welcome relief as Zhuhai is situated in the subtropics and quite hot even in February.If you pay a few bucks you can feed the walruses sardines from a bridge after sterilising your hands for their protection. Cuteness overload the way they look like they are hugging each other as they wait for a fish, especially considering they are fat, hairy, tusked behemoths.Make sure you hang around to see one of the evening parades on the lake (repeated twice each evening when I was there). Music, fountains, fireworks shooting off the back of jet-skis. The acrobats levitating and spinning 20m in the air using water jet boots were a highlight.When my kid is a bit older we will visit again, but as a package deal with one of the resort hotels as this represents the best value. If you pay the day tripper price the park is actually quite expensive, albeit the park is absolutely massive so you do get to see a lot. We definitely needed two days as our kid and his grandmother are slow walkers."
Awesome -- Prepare for Hot Weather,"We visited the Park with 6 children ranging in age from 18 to 6 years old.  Everyone enjoyed themselves and found that there were a good variety of rides and exhibits for them to explore.  The aquarium is the largest in the world and is so amazing.  The acrylic panels are huge and make the viewing experience so special.  We easily spent over an hour just in the aquarium alone.The food in the restaurant adjacent to the aquarium was the best in the park. The portion size is large and can easily be shared.   Be aware that they will charge your party 20 yuan for tea.  The tea is very good, it is a required purchase.  Other family members tried some of the other restaurants and did not find the food to be very good.Beware if its a sunny day, the park has little shade and the sun is quite strong.  The exhibits are a great and serve as a respite from the heat. Be sure to put on enough sunscreen, wear a hat (or use an umbrella) and carry bottled water.  Each person is allowed to bring in 1 bottle of water into the park.  No food can be brought in.We had an enjoyable day, we took the map and planned out our day."
Over hyped.,"After visiting, the first impression I had is that the venue is over hyped.. The venue is small when compared to other amusement parks and have limited number of rides. They don't allow to carry outside food and drinks and everything inside in over-priced. Being vegetarians, we hardly could find anything to eat. Chimelong safari in Guangzhou is much better. The saving grace was that  although we went there on weekend, the waiting time was less than 15 mins for most of the rides. The 5D theater was also good. The light/sound/fire cracker show at the end of the day did lift up our spirits after a tiring day..."
Wicked Theme Park,Like1. Beluga Whale show2. Whale shark exhibit3. Soaring eagle roller coaster4. Parade5. Polar Express Water CoasterDislike1. No enough shade2. Retail was not interesting
Okay- enclosures are small,"Compared to the other Chimelong theme park this is average. It does have the world's biggest aquarium but limited outside of that- some rides. Are good but the lingering vision of attic wolves running around a room smaller than my lounge room is disturbing, with the brown bears kept outside in the macau humidity extremely sad.There is slot of animals but generally they crammed into smaller areas was not good..  Okay but not must do- crowds when we visited on a Saturday were okay. Limited queueibg"
Fantastic top notch park,"This park is world class. Everything is clean and of high standard. Shows, rides and animals are all worth a visit. Can easily spend a whole day here! Great for families with children."
"Huge queues... Need a lot of patience, but huge range of animals!","Went on a sunny hot summer's day... From Hong Kong, we took a ferry to Macau, then took their designated coach to the Ocean Kingdom. First thing you will realise, when you finally arrive, is that there are huge queues! Crowds are common in China aren't they?Anyhow, there is a huge range of activities that you can do in the park! We just went to see the animals, and ditched the rides, but some of the rides looked rather crazy! There are unusal animals such as the beluga whales, whale sharks, polar bears etc... In fact, the area isn't that large, so you can in fact pretty much visit everything in one day, if you arrive early and leave when they close... There is also an option of seeing the circus, but we didn't stay for that.A tip would be to bring lots of water, or a big bottle, and a fan for you to cool down when you are in the queue!"
Avoid during Summer time,If you REALLY have to go.... do it in November-Feb when its coolerWe had a just Ok so-so time there and stayed at the theme park hotel... warning bring LOTS of your own snacks and beer because there is NOTHING outside the hotel ... not even a convenience storeThe toilets............. thinking about it makes me want to throw upThe animals looked sad and idiots were throwing junk food at the bears .... it just looks a total messIf you are into rubbing shoulders with sweaty screaming locals and 30min to hour long queues.... this place is ideal for you and your familythe only saving grace was the aquarium which was niceApart from that we enjoyed the older Ocean Park in HK alot better .... reasonable queing times
Biggest Aquarium in the World,"As of today's date, this park has the biggest aquarium in the world.  Besides that aquarium, there are many other aquariums in the park that are also really good. The biggest aquarium has three whale sharks and hundreds of other fish in it. There is a huge viewing room that hundreds of people can stand in, then you walk to the back of the aquarium and you go into a tunnel under the aquarium, looking up into the aquarium as the creatures swim over top of you. It kind of feels like you are standing on the floor of the ocean, except you can obviously breathe oxygen. The Beluga whales are very fun to watch, and swim right up to the window, and look at you, and do tricks ,They love spinning around and are very agile. The penguin exhibit is pretty good. I went to a dolphin show in the dolphin amphitheater and I highly recommend seeing the show. You do not have to pay any extra to see it, and I think it happens 3 or 4 times per day. The only exhibits I did not like were the exhibits for the bears and the artic wolves. The enclosure is WAY to small and depressing for the animals and they are quite literally going insane. The bears just rock back and forth shaking their heads, and the artic wolves run in a constant circle around their small enclosure. Those exhibits were sad to see. Chimelong should concentrate on doing the OCEAN animals for this park, because they do not have the facilities for land mammals. The only other negative was how rude the crowds were. When I say crowd, I mean crowds the way you think of them being in China, except people just very rudely pushing you... constantly. There is no regard for manners in trying to view the animals. It would not be a place for somebody with a short temper to visit... I took my brother and one of his friends there and they really enjoyed it overall."
"Needs work, overall ok.","I visited on a somewhat rainy day which helped keep crowds in check and temperatures in the moderate zone. I echo the comments of there reviews in that the signage needs to be improved, the food choices and locations should be expanded and that the lines (even with the rain) for some events were very long. I, too, was disappointed to see some of the animals displaying behavior that suggested they had been in captivity for too long. This was especially apparent in the polar bear den where one bear just continually swayed and another swam in circles repeatedly.  This needs to be corrected immediately."
Animal Abuse.,"I visited this ""Ocean Kingdom"" last summer and it was awfully disappointing. By the end of the trip I had lost faith in the human race and it absolutely disgusts me to see how highly rated this establishment is rated on Trip Advisor. As I mentioned before, I went during summer. It was a sweltering, unbelievably humid, 30 degree Celsius day. The polar bear ""habitat"" was nothing but rooms with what looked like plastic fake snow. The animals were understandably, and unsurprisingly, laid out and lifeless. Chimelong's widely boasted about ""largest glass aquarium""? An absolute farce. The coral is made out of cement. There was actually a scuba diver scrubbing fish excrement off the fake, dull, grey corals. The fish in the tank were no better. It was pretty much your typical Chinese restaurant fish tank, only supersized with a few baby whale sharks thrown in. If you're hoping to learn anything about the captive animals you've seen; bad luck. Apart from a signs with large, childish fonts with general knowledge like ""Jellyfish are made up of 95% water!"", there are no English descriptions. And the Chinese signage fairs no better. The most aggravating part of the trip was the outdoor brown bear torture enclosure. Adapted to icy, cool climates, these bears were left out in the humid ZhuHai summer with no means of cooling themselves. Not even an ice block. The poor animals were even showing signs of decaying mental health and stereotypy. A man passing by laughed at one of the bear's repetitive head-shaking and told his young daughter in chinese ""Ha ha, that bear keeps saying no!"". It seemed to me only the uneducated could enjoy this ""kingdom"". Not to mention this place is advertised as an ocean themed park, the Brown Bears are absolutely unnecessary to this theme, and there wasn't even adequate facilities to house these creatures.We spent the whole day at Chimelong, and only went on one of the rides due to the outrageous lines. We spent 30 min in line for a rocking boat ride. Although Chimelong may be big, and have six Guinness world records, it all means nothing when the establishment itself lacks care, passion, and genuine interest towards to animals that they exhibit. And unfortunately, Chimelong lacks just that. They treat their animals like inanimate money magnets. It works, but it also shows."
Wonderful place to spend your time,"It's a very interesting to spend your whole day moving from one attraction/show to another. Even as you enter the place you can see how magnificently the Chinese have created this place not only for the young but for the seniors too. A parade awaits the arrivals at a certain time and you can see so many entertaining shows featuring the belugas, walruses etc.You can enjoy a ride through the huge aquarium. Toilet facilities are good. Food is a bit expensive though. At night there was a firework display where the huge man-made whale changes colours. So cool and exciting."
chinese makes everything extra huge,"Yes, extra huge, because extra large still does not do it justice. The aquarium is the biggest in the world, with 6 guinness world records. How in the heck did they catch 3, albeit small, whale sharks and put them in the aquarium? In a yahoo article less than a year ago, chinese fishermen caught a whale shark and when the fisheries department intercepted them, the 15-16 foot juvenile already weighed 2 metric tons. I have swam with whale sharks several times in the philippines, and they are huge with the biggest one I saw estimated at 30 feet. The ones at this aquarium looks like they are 15ft or bigger.The place has several underwater tunnels a lot bigger than those ocean parks i have gone to. I was lucky to witness several feeding times while in those tunnels and the best one was during the manatees feeding time.They also had several rides, scary and exciting roller coasters though the ones at chimelong paradise takes the cake in thrilling coasters."
Good Family Outing,"I went there recently with family and friends on a week day, so it was not too crowded. The park itself is great, there are rides for all types of thrills, good shows and there is a variety of food and snacks.There are 2 water rides which provide waterproof coats for 15 RMB each and they certainly did the job. The aquarium was amazing. If you go on a more quiet day it is very relaxing as they play very calming music in the background as you admire the whale sharks.The only criticism is about the bear enclosures. The brown bears are in an open enclosure where guests can purchase vegetables to throw at them, for them to eat. Personally, I found this to be quite cruel, especially when the food fell into the ditch which is between the guests and bears.The worst part was the polar bear enclosure. There were two areas with the polar bears with a glass wall in between. In one there were two bears who looked very depressed. One of them just sat and stared at the floor without moving for the entire time we were in there. In the other area was a polar bear on its own pacing up and down, stopping and turning in the exact same places, which for us at the time looked as if the poor bear was going or had gone crazy. Apparently this is 'Stereotypic Behaviour', which often occurs in animals in zoos, due to boredom and lack of exercise that is contributed by lack of appropriate normal stimuli. It was very upsetting to see and the enclosure itself is not big enough for such a bear. From what we also saw was their urine all over the place, so they were living in their own filth. So if you are an animal lover i would suggest staying away. It definitely put a downer on our day."
50%-50%,"Over the last holidays ( ChinMing/Easter)I went with couple of friends to visit for the 1st time Chimelong Ocean Kingdom where we stayed at Circus Hotel. As expected there were lots of people but since the place is so large you do not feel the crowd. I found the facilities attractive and the huge aquariums are fantastic with so many different types of fish on display, that is the good part but when it comes to food it is a disaster : very simple and limited number of dishes being offered at very expensive prices, a small local mineral water is sold at RMB10, a bowl of noodles :RMB 45, tiny piece of cake : RMB:18 and so on..My suggestion go visit the place if you have the opportunity but take along : water and other drinks as for food you would need to go to down town Zhuhai where you can find many restaurants serving good food at reasonable prices."
Great ocean animal theme park!,"This is a great theme park with perhaps the most varieties of ocean and arctic animals. Dolphins, polar bears, polar foxes, and polar wolfs are some of my favorites. However, if you are looking for many amusement rides, this place offers limited amusement rides but  the roller coaster is exciting enough to make it memorable. Their aquarium is ranked in the Guinness as the ""largest aquarium"" and with the ""widest sightseeing window"" in the world. My favorite about their aquarium was the submarine ride. (""Don't be silly, you won't need to wear a life jacket from the ride!"") This mini-submarine will take you to the bottom of the aquarium. Your seat will be laid down and the sea world will become your sky as if you were in a submarine! They have different show playing by the hour at different exhibit hall and featuring different animals. If you are not into amusement rides, you can spend your day just by watching all the shows. The firework and lake performance at night was truly amazing. The firework was much more than an amusement park standard, it is more like a firework on National day. They have a firework shooting base in the center of the lake and at least 6 other shooting base outside of the lake that surrounds the audience. So the audience is covered with firework from the front, the side and the back. The lake performance was a combination of jet ski, fire, and flyboard. The flyboard was extremely cool!Recommendation: - Improvement in food varieties in restaurants; - more snacks & drinks varieties at food carts; - more rides to complete a two day visit;- more games center at different location to win toys"
Great for all ages!,This place is fun for everyone!  We love all the animal shows and rides available for the different ages of our kids.  There are so many benches to sit down on along the way--food and beverages everywhere too.  This is a wonderful amusement park!
Expected Fun,"I'm well pass the age for theme park but since the two of us had a day to spare in Zhuhai, we decided to venture out to the park on a Sunday. After a 50-min comfortable bus ride from Jiuzhou Port, we arrived at the Disney-styled Ocean themed park. The entrance was quite impressive with a huge LCD-paneled ceiling lined with souvenir shops. The park was clean and very well maintained. We caught all the 3 main ride with the Parrot coaster being the most fun and thrilling, comparable to any good rides in Six-Flag. They have the largest aquarium according to Guinness World Record, holding manta ray and whale sharks among others. The viewing area was large and comfortable. We enjoyed other animals as well, including polar bears, beluga, manatee, walrus, to name a few. Not sure because it's winter or the park being relatively new, the whole park was relatively empty. the overcrowding is so common and can be such a spoiler in a lot of tourist attractions in China. We didn't have to wait to any ride or turned away from any shows. The fast food quality could be better. We ended up spending 5 hours there. All in all, very fun."
"Brand new, but fully formed","Unlike many other brand new theme parks around the world, this has opened with a full compliment of rides and attractions. Whilst there are still attractions under construction, don't worry, there's still more than enough to do for a whole day. The animal exhibits are plentiful and well designed. The main thing that sets this apart from other zoos/aquariums I've visited is the sheer number of animals that they have. There's a huge range of species, and many of each one. The Whale shark aquarium, with all of its world record breaking features, is fantastic. Well designed, and well staffed, its a pleasant environment to view such amazing creatures. The Parrot coaster is fantastic, and is definitely one of the better examples of its type. Whilst the other rides may not be anything unusual, they're beautifully themed and have fantastic spots where they travel ""through"" the animal enclosures. Whilst this is definitely not a cheap day out, I did feel like I'd got my money's worth."
Amazing!,"When you walk into the entrance there is a massive tall tunnel that you walk through that is like walking under the sea - shells, plants and rocky ledges on either side with a super huge screen high above that changes with different fish and creatures swimming above you - it is something like I had never seen.  This was an wonderful trip with young kids who along with the adults were totally amazed with all of Ocean Kingdom!  They are begging to go back!First of all the park is brand new, sparkling clean, friendly and knowledgeable staff and a delight to the senses with all the really cool shows, exhibits, rides and beautiful landscaping around the lagoon.The beluga whale, dolphin and sea lion shows were all very good.  Most impressive were the number of dolphins, whales and sea lions in each show - not just a few each but up to a dozen at the same time.  They all seemed to interact with their trainers well and were very intelligent - amazing everyone with everything they did.Don't miss the penguins, polar bears and brown bear - close up views both inside and out.The rides were fun for all ages with different ones for smaller kids (really cool fish and polar bear carousel with a huge pink octopus on top) up to the really crazy coaster and water rides. Wish there had been a few more food choices but we tried the roasted chicken and rice and it was really good and not too expensive.  We were able to bring in one water bottle per person and they do check bags and no outside food is allowed but I sure saw lots of people eating it!  We did manage to bring a few snacks for the kids in jacket pockets.The aquariums are absolutely amazing - the record breading size is immense and the whale sharks swim right in front of you along with hundreds of other fish, stingrays etc. Take time to really enjoy this!Around 3:30 pm (ask someone) there is a really cool parade through the park with beautiful floats, characters and acrobats.  Also, hourly there are water fountain shows along the lagoon area and at night a beautiful fireworks spectacular.  Check for times and plan accordingly.We visited on a Thursday in December and there were no crowds at all!  No lines!  And perfect weather.  After seeing the massive gates (and reading some horror story reviews) at the entrance and the long queue lines throughout the park for shows and rides I cannot imagine coming here on a holiday, weekend or during the sweltering summer and not being able to enjoy this beautiful park - again plan accordingly!"
Nice place- and it's still growing,"Just got back from there a few days ago. While it's the Asian version of Disney, there's some unique things that make it an interesting visit for the day. While a little pricey, seeing the whale shark exhibit was worth the price of admission alone. It was a spectacle to behold and only rivaled by the aquarium in Monterey, California. Seeing these gentle giants swimming about was breathtaking. They also had some other scattered animal exhibits throughout but none as good as the aquarium. The bear exhibit even seemed tiny, cramped and little outdated by some better western standards.I'm also used to seeing animals as educational exhibits and not so much as trained performers so if you're a little squeamish about that, be forewarned. There are seal, dolphin, and beluga shows daily that seem a little forced and staged.Also be forewarned that one can't bring in outside food and it's mighty pricey to dine inside the park. They only allow one bottle of water as well, so be prepared to spend a little on at least that. We opted for the noodles (+36 rmb though!) which felt a little more substantial as well as hydrating us. Also for budget minded families there are gift shops everywhere so if you've got little kids that have to have it all- you can drop a small mint here. Almost all of the exhibits will empty you into a nearby gift shop and there is a myriad of friendly staffers demonstrating the products in freestanding kiosks as well.The place is still expanding so who knows what it'll turn into in a few months or years."
Whale Shark Aquarium is a must-see place,"If you visit Macau, why don't you be here as well? Don't miss the show at 8:30pm around the lake, from my point of view, the best place to see this show is the place what you can see right front of the giant whale (“Whale Shark Aquarium”) clearly.  During the Christmas, I could also see a night parade from 7:45 to 8pm in the space next to Whale Shark Aquarium, I don't know that it's a regular programme or not, please check with staff nearby (I was kept informed by the staff this event at night).   As a regulation, visitors should not bring any food inside (but okay to bring drinks).  Bag check at the entrance is needed.  Whale Shark Aquarium is a must-see place, let visit the aquarium during feeding,  keeping all fishes close together during feeding is an interesting scene.  If you don’t like sea creatures and target for games, please bring a water proof jacket because you may get wet for some games."
Great family spot,"Attractions after attractions! New and fancy spot, lot's of fun but quite costly. Disney world feeling"
Not bad for half a day.,Visited the park on a weekday (less people and waiting time for rides were less than 5min). Rides are rather well-maintained. The aquariums are really eye-opening and the shows are really interesting! Nightlife here is also very interesting as there is a closing show (with fireworks) at 8.30pm.
Worth a Visit,"This is a new park, opened in Jan 2014 by the same people as run (and not the be confused with) Chimelong Paradise in Guangzhou (which is a lot bigger & better and contains a Water Park/Amusement Park and Safari Park all in the same complex)We visited just before Christmas as a short break via Macau. We crossed from Macau Cotai at the Lotus Port crossing and it's a short bus/taxi from there. You could rush it through as a day-trip, or better get a package including a stay at the Chimelong Hengqin Bay Hotel, which is part of the complex, and a 10-min walk or shuttle bus ride away.Ocean Kingdom mixes some amusement park activities with a Marine Park that includes a large aquarium (similar to Ocean Park in Hong Kong but with Whale Sharks as their main attraction) and various shows - Dolphins, Belugas etc. Don't expect a large number of amusement rides - there is one large rollercoaster and two water rides; all of these are good, but pick your visit to avoid weekends and China holidays else you will spend the day queuing. There are some more fairground type rounds - carousels. bumper cars and the like. The time we went we had a lot of the rides to ourselves which was great.The standards were all generally ok, but as others have stated the bears and penguins in particular are not in the best of confinements, but certainly you would see worse elsewhere in China, not that this makes this any better. Food is the typical amusement park fare and quality, but the prices are fairly reasonable. The 15 min evening closing spectacle is worth a watch and occurs on the main central lake including jet-skis, fountains, fireworks, lasers and the like - a good 15 mins spectacle. Running at the same time, there is an evening Circus on the complex (close to the hotel) and the 1hr 20min show is definitely worth seeing, especially if you get it as part of the hotel package. You will need two nights to see both, but skip the park show and go to the circus if you don't have the time or indeed the need to do 2 days here.There is a smallish water park/large pool. but these are part of the hotel and not the amusement park. The park continues to grow, there are two new hotels are opening in 2015, as is a new 5D theatre.Levels of service and English were probably the best I've experienced at such a venue in China and impressed me - you could just get by without Chinese here and in the hotel.To comment on some of the other reviewers - ""5 times larger than Ocean Park"", that's probably only true if you include the huge lake, but whatever the case, there are less rides here. ""Huge numbers of marine animals'' - there is one large aquarium tank, plus the shows I mentioned.Overall, it's worth a visit if you are looking for new options in the area, but given the choice Ocean Park in Hong Kong, Disneyland or the other Chimelong park in Guangzhou are all slightly better choices if you haven't tried before."
Nice theme park,Very big theme parks with lots of marine animals. Went there on a Monday afternoon wasn't that crowed but many rides were not opened. You can also feed the brown bears and seals at 20RMB. I would recommend you all to go when the park is fully renovated.
Well-designed theme park,"We bought the 4pm ticket which was cheaper, at 280 yuan instead of 350 yuan. We planned to stay till closing so it was 5 hours of  enjoyment till 9pm. There were several shows but we only managed to catch the dolphins show. These sea mammals are magnificent and clever and it was just great to see how they interact with their trainers.Would recommend the parrot coaster for its thrills and heart-stopping drops and twists. Freaked me out the first round but it became addictive after the second time. Besides, there was no queue at the late hour.The shark aquarium was impressive because of its collection of  not 1 but 3 whale sharks!! Of course the huge fish tank had won  records for its dimensions. Still, I think the SEA Aquarium in Singapore is just as spectacular and more colourful. The mantra ray looks bigger too.The theme park did not disappoint as we enjoyed the fireworks combined with the lasers, fire at the lake, musical fountains at the closing. The first time seeing these 'supersonic hedgehog' looking guys skillfully hovering over the waters in jet boots, I was really impressed!Will visit again as we did not get to see other attractions like the Beluga whale show and the manatees and penguins. However, be prepared to pay the high prices for the food in there as no outside food was allowed. They checked our bags at the entrance. I think the organisation should not have such an unfair policy as people may have certain dietary requirements and the food they offer aren't that great in variety, taste and price."
Innovative entertainment park with lots of gift shops!,"This park is five times bigger than Hong Kong Ocean Park! There are a lot of ticket counters so the waiting time is ok. It is advisable to bring some dry food there. Because all the restaurants are fully packed with people. So if you have small children, it is better to bring some snack. At the entrance gate, there is a giant projection screen on the ceiling. It is projecting the ocean scene animation. Way too cool!!  The mascots are creative and funny, not copycat items. They are all over the park. The kids are very happy and excited. The entertainment rides are also very exciting! the prirate boat can do U-turn. hahaha. Line up for the shows early, because cut-off time is early too. Aquarium has long queue.......There are many many gift shops. The gifts are very creative and innovative. It is advisable to stay there for one night to watch the circus also. The hotel is also beautifully built. cheers!"
Fabulous ocean park,Superb experience at this wonderful and awesome park filled with so many sea & land creatures.  We were there on a weekday and there were no crowds to spoil the fun. Up close with marine animals & the shows were good too. Entrance a bit pricey but to be expected since maintenance must cost a bomb. Will definitely go again.
AMAZING & EXCELLENCE PARK,"Is hard to compare with their sister theme park in Panyu, Guangzhou. This 5x Guinness World Record (Largest Aquarium, Largest Underwater viewing dome, Largest Aquarium Tank, Largest Aquarium Window & Largest Acrylic Panel)~AmazingBeside the sealife, you can have a chance to ride on their roller coaster, log slides & etc. It also suitable for kids. To cover the whole theme park, you need to spend at least 1 full dayI will definite return for longer stay"
Three Star Whale Sharks,It was fun to see the three rare whale sharks in the huge aquarium. Make sure you have comfortable shoes on and avoid the summer hot season.
A pleasant mixture of rides and sealife,we went on thursday and no ques which added to the good vibe...the parrot roller coaster doesn't describe what a terrifying ride this really is...and as there wasn't any ques we we're allowed to disembark and ride again without queuing. the whale sharks aquarium is unbelievable...a must see for any age!
Blows your mind,"To set the scene, I have many to many aquariums over the world, I like my fish. This place was amazing, the feeling of being there, the quality of your surroundings, the Guinness world record breaking tanks, the staff... everything was excellent.The place is huge but you can just about do every attraction in a day. I would like to mention the amount of different animals was vast and not only that, each exhibit (especially the penguins) had a multitude of viewing angles. It wasn't just one window looking in, you could see from under the water, you could watch them dive in etc etc.The rides were really good fun but I think the emphasis was on the shows and the animals. The rides would pass by the animals directly, it was brilliant.The shows were fantastic, the animals would do amazing tricks and you really could tell there was a connection between the instructor and animal and the animals were happy.The only let down for us was that there wasn't enough food choice, being westerners we would prefer at least a few more choices. But the place is in a less touristy area of China.The fireworks show at the end was like a New Years Eve celebration.I can't express much more, you have to see it to believe it. Its epic."
Best aquarium in Asia,"We join a tour to visit the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom and spend 5 hours there. The belouga performance was amazing and you can get really close to those animals inside. The aquarium is incredible, one of the largest aquarium in Asia. However, you may have to wait for quite long for taking a ride on the roller coaster. The worst part of the park is the brown bear area. They were intentionally starving those brown bears in order to make them keep “performing” in front of visitors and they charged RMB20 for 4 small pieces of carrots if you want to feed them. It was outrageous!!! Other than that, the park was overall worth-visiting."
This place really is superb,Stayed here with my wife in jan 14. It is absolutely brilliant and whilst still quite new I am sure that it will continue to expand making it an even better experience.  The shows were first class.  A little hard to get to but certainly worth the effort.
worth going,"It is new and clean. friendly staff. toilet hypiene acceptable. there are shows every hour. the aquarium is really big . Free wifi. Not many machinery games at present, Enviroment nicely decorated. The flower car show at 3pm is quite good. Traffic is convenient ."
worth the trip - a class on its own,"i got lots to write but it will just make things confusing.. i did a lot of prep work, spoke nor read no chinese.. in short.. this place is a must go place.. the thing is transportation to this place sucks.. either u take a car, a tour or a few public buses.. i doubt taxis are going to be a two way option or its going to be cheap.. the location is kinda remote and tucked in a quiet area. my wife, my 4yr daugther and myself used the public bus and it was not that difficult as long u do your homework.. there are a few ways to go from hongkong, macau and china.. we came from guangzhou, using the highspeed intercity railway, we stopped at the last stop, zhuhai station. Zhuhai station is also beside the gongbei port which leads to macau.Infront of gongbei port towards china, there is an underground port plaza which has an underground bus stop. We took the K10 bus and headed towards the last stop, changlong bus station. The correct direction is when u ask the bus driver. Just say Chang Long. The other opposite wrong direction is Ji Da as its last stop. ChimeLong Ocean Kingdom is a.k.a ChangLong Ocean Kingdom.The last stop stops exactly inside the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom. No need to walk far. We went during off peak season because I read the bus can get crazy loaded with people. The next tip is to go early and leave early to avoid huge crowd. Go early to get the early shows as well, dolphin show and beluga shows are good. We cant bring water/food in, but try to avoid the restaurants, we tried them, the food are not that great and they are really expensive. I would suggest to get the chicken burgers selling from the stalls all around the place. Avoid the ice cones as they are too sweet. Water bottles are not expensive from the stalls, you can also get ice creams and soft drinks. You will need to walk alot. Bring a hat/cap if you fear the heat or a tan. Wear light. Be prepared for tour groups rushing around. We got really tired and skipped the last exhibit. We took the bus back around 4.30 and got a seating seat. Its about an hour back as well to the gongbei port.There were polar bears, walruses, dolphin, brown bears, belugas, whale sharks, rays.. etc.. all well kept clean and happy.good luckgan"
Just another theme park,"Visited Ocean Kingdom for one day, and found it to be pretty much just another theme park similar to Seaworld. Rides, aquariums, shows etc. Food overpriced, once over the initial wow factor then it makes you think weather really worth going. Best thing is the light and firework show in the evening when the park closes, definitely worth staying for and as you leave you walk under a massive screen depicting pictures of under sea life. I"
An entertainment park with possibly the largest aquarium in the world...,"I should confess I am not a big fan of entertainment park... I even find Disneyworld boring... But my children love those attractions. This is how we ended going to Chimelong Zhuhai. And I must say I am totally under the spell: would even love to go back! It is articulated around animals (polar animals) and sea creatures has also offers attractions such as log slides, roller coaster... The entrance is so impressive with the largest LED screen I have ever seen, topping an immense hall. I enjoyed most the aquarium. I have visited the one in Sydney, Singapore... But this one is simply fascinating. Not only is it beautifully populated but its size was truly amazing. Most probably the largest aquarium in the world! We will definitely go back!"
International Standards,"This newly built ocean kingdom is a visual treat and built like a 'Sea world meet Disneyland'.We got the flyer of the show timings at the entrance and planned our visit around that.We saw dolphin , sea lion and the beluga whale show which were all great. We saw the polar enclosure for polar bears and penguins and the beautiful whale shark aquarium( largest in the world). The rides were good , especially the nemo one. The parade is beautiful , please don't miss it! Also saw the musical fountains spectacular which was enthralling!! Loved my visit and would say matches up to any international park!"
"Worth going there, Autumn best!",This is only the phase one of the overall project.  Not huge in space but packed by visitors (99% Mainlanders).  Aquariums are all cool.  The only shame was not trying the terrific parrot rollercoaster (generally the remarks are cool).
"Excellent park facilities, Awful transportation!","We went to the Ocean Kingdom by taxi. The park was amazing and we enjoyed. However, the nightmare was coming when we left. After the firework at 8:30, we walked with the thousands crowds for an hour before we reached the bus stop. When the bus came, hundreds of people rushed to stop the bus before it reached the bus stop. The mob squeezed into the bus, pushed each other, screamed.... one even climbed through the window. The bus was overloaded, the door was blocked but people did not get off..... We waited... but we were afraid that we were left in that remote area, therefore we took a deep breath and followed the mob to squeezed into the bus. Our bodies were pressed and we could not  breath. The bus took 1.5 hour to reach the city centre as there were so many cars on the road. We arrived the hotel after 12:00. Felt like a survior of a disaster. Goodness me! The joy was covered with the nightmare.Tips: Either join the tour or drive your car. Don't wish a luck for catching a taxi or a bus. Or you may come to Hong Kong Ocean Park instead. It's smaller but the transportation is good."
Super cool!,I have never been Sea World but Ocean Kingdom is probably WAY Cooler! I mean Really they have a Whale Shark TANK!!!!
Amazing aquarium is worth the trip.,"Chimelong Ocean Kingdom hasn't been around for long, despite the multi year expectations for its opening.  There are signs that the operator cut some corners to get it open on time.  (paint peeling in all the riverboat lagoons and cracked sidewalk.) However, looking beyond that, it is a spectacular installation. The hotel is impressive in its own right, but the massive (worlds largest) aquarium makes a visit worthwhile.  Now, I will admit that Chinese zoos are not known for their humane handling of animals, so if your used to the San Diego zoo, you will find the wild animal areas at this zoo somewhat disturbing."
great park for the whole family,"Went on a Thursday afternoon. 10 min wait tops for all the roller coasters.  Overall facility was big, clean, and entertaining."
Surprisingly Well Done,"The up and coming Chimelong group is doing a good job at this site to provide quality entertainment. The decor and surrounding area aren't quite Disney, but aren't bad at all. My personal opinion about keeping exotic animals outside their own environment aside, they do a decent job at entertaining their clientele. Their whale shark exhibit is the largest saltwater tank in the world and the theming is spot on. The park is accompanied with a huge and beautiful hotel complex. Their are big expansion plans in their near future."
Not a place if you love animals,The entrance of the park is impressive with a huge screen overhead.  However once you keep on walking through the park its less impressive.  The stingray space was tiny.  The largest glass aquarium was impressive but then you see the bears which is awful.  The brown bears had a tiny space right in front of the polar bears behind glass.  As said not to go if you love animals
Ocean Kingdom - a Very Good Experience,"Went to Ocean Kingdom July4. While not quite as large as Ocean Park in Hong Kong, which we've also been to, the Ocean Kingdom experience for us was better. The park is well laid out with individual 'theaters"" for each type of show (Beluga Whale, Sea Lion, and Dolphin) and next to each theater were exhibits of the animals in the show. The shows were spaced out with an hour in between. The shows were all performed excellently and very enjoyable, lasting between about 20 to 30 minutes each. In addition to the show exhibits there were many other animal exhibits throughout the park and plenty of rides and attractions for kids and adults both. The crowds there were much smaller than what we had experienced at Ocean Park. We arrived a little after 10am on a Friday and there were virtually no crowds. While some of the park's areas do not open until 11am or 11:30am, there was still much to do until then, so arriving early seems to be a good idea. Even in the afternoon after many more people had arrived, the crowds were very manageable. The other thing that stood out was that the restrooms were sparkling clean and the availability of Western toilets good! Which is not always the case in China. While the day we went was very hot, the enclosed venues were all well air conditioned so it wasn't too hard to keep cool.  The reason I gave only 4 stars was that the main Whale Shark aquarium itself was not up to par with other acquarims I've been to, including the one at Ocean Park and due to some maintenance, not all of it was open. We took a taxi to get there from our hotel next to the Gongbei Port. Travel time was about 40 minutes and it cost 58 yuan. On the way back we took a direct to Gongbei bus with a 10 yuan fare per person."
this place was so awesome l did go to there with my honey.in spite of  so expensive but no regret after entried.,this place was so awesome.i did go to there with my lover and spend good time for all day long.i wanna going to again if my familly come to me.
Chimelong Ocean Kingdom--loved it!!,"I was very impressed with this aquarium/water park.  We spent the entire afternoon there, and I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the park and all it offered.  The animal shows seemed a bit short, but their arenas were beautiful!  The animals all looked very healthy (which isn't the case often in China).  There was only one poor horseshoe crab that was perpetually stuck in his bubble cage so we could see his underside.  The roller coaster looked smaller than what I was used to in America, but it still packed a punch!!  My husband and I both really liked it!  On many of the rides, though, it took a long time for the staff to get the previous riders off and load new ones on.  I'm not sure how efficient this will be when the park is crowded.We stayed at the Chimelong Hotel and got a package deal with the tickets.  We did not make it to the circus, though I would have loved to go!  I'm not sure where else you would stay if you wanted to stay overnight, as Ocean Kingdom seems to be out in the middle of nowhere.  :)  Plus, because we stayed at the hotel, we got a wristband that allowed us a certain amount of cuts to the front of the line for some of the rides.If at all possible, try to go when it's NOT a Chinese holiday.  We went on a Monday when school was still in session, and we only waited in lines for just a few minutes.  In the late afternoon, it rained, and the park was basically just ours!!  I can't imagine that place with the typical Chinese holiday crowd.  I enjoyed this place SO much more than HK Disneyland.  If I had to choose one to go back to visit, I would choose Ocean Kingdom!"
I stayed there for 8 hours and did not want to leave,"It is quite far from the city center. You can go to Jida bus terminal or Gongbei border bus station and take a bus K10, 3 yuan. The road is more than 40 minutes. Get off at the last stop. The ticket is 350 yuan or about 58 US dollars. But it is worth it. When you enter the park you see a huge Led roof screen with the videos of the marine life. A nice cafe on the right. A Walrus splash is on the left. You can have an exciting ride. There is a schedule of the shows. I visited the sea lion show at 12 p.m. It is quite good especially when the biggest sea lion comes out)) after the show one can see rays and sharks in the aquarium, and then proceed to the white bears. These is a roller-coaster over there too. The dolphin show starts at 2 p.m. I watched beluga show at 1 p.m. and then stayed at the biggest aquarium for too long so I missed the dolphin show. I have never seen belugas in my life. They are huge. The whale shark is gorgeous. The aquarium is superb! After the aquarium I had some dessert at the cafe in front. It is kind of pricey to buy drinking water there. The third roller coaster is just to the left of the huge aquarium whale shark statue. It is for brave people. At the area of the roller coaster you can see rare fish an sea animals. At 3 p.m. they start a parade around the park with the singing fountains later on. The place is new and beautiful. I stayed there till 6 p.m. and watched a dolphin show. The Chinese were shouting at the aquariums which was annoying. But I was happy to visit this place!"
Good place to go with children,It is a very clean park and well maintained. We particularly liked the polar mountain with many polar bears. Could do with more children's ride though. We stayed in the park for around 3 hours and pretty much finished most things.
Great Hotel/Great Aquarium,"Overall, I love the hotel - so much better than Chimelong Hotel in Panyu.  It's new, it's grand and just splendid.  The water park is unfinished but when it's done, I'm sure it will be one of the best destinations in Asia.  The Aquarium earned several Guiness World Record.  When we were there, it just opened.  Though many were operational, the Whaleshark Aquarium didn't have whalesharks yet so that was a disappointment but then again, our tickets were on promo price.  It was also a holiday in China so there were just too many people but sans the crowd, it was really a great place to go with family."
