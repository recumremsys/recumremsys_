The mosque is awe inspirig to say ther least.
Nice Cami ,I like it cuz it has different design than istanbul Mousqes It’s very nice I do recommend visiting it
Expensive day trip - Damp Squib!!,"After seeing the magnificent mosques in Istanbul coming all the way here to see this mosque was a bit deflating. Not sure about the history, but if known,  I wouldn't spend a lot of money coming all the way here on a day trip."
Ulu Jami Mosque Bursa,"The great Cathedral mosque of Bursa is a 13th-century architectural monument in the classic Ottoman style. The mosque is located in the historical center of the city near the old Kozakhan market, a Park, a covered silk market, many cafes and mosques. You can wash your face again and again with local mountain water for ablution. The decoration inside the mosque is really great. Entrance to the mosque is free."
Ulucamii in the centre of the Old Town,"Please remember this place is vast, and sits in the heart of the old city. From here you can visit the Grans Bazaar (KAPALI CARSI), then go to have coffee in the last stop of the silk road being KOZAHAN or IPEK HAN (where silk was marketed from - a stock exchange for silk).  You can also visit PIRINC HAN (where rice stocks were marketed from - a stock exchange for rice). Also the nearby EMIR HAN. Along with all the restaurants and market space available,"
Visit,Visited for the first time and was astonished by the architecture and design. The lighting and colours magnificent. You get free scarf to wear to show respect of other religious places of worship.Upon your visit holy water was given to sip but choice is yours to partake or not. Enjoyed visit to the mosque. Thanks to our tour guide and coach driver.
A must see when visiting Bursa,"One of the most important mosques in Turkey. With its beautiful design, a pool and a fountain inside the mosque, beautiful examples of Islamic calligraphy with some of them are huge in size."

World heritage,On of the best mosque built by early Ottoman’s. It s a must see place in Bursa. It has got 20 domes and precious calligraphic verses of holy Quran.
Mosque with a fountain,"Went here with a tour, the guide told us that this is the first mosque in Bursa. It is built with a fountain inside, and it is beautiful. Calligraphies were well-maintained, and it was very clean."
Magnificent calligraphy,"We cannot get enough of the islamic calligraphy in this mosque! After doing our prayers there, we spent a long time inside, contemplating the inspiring mastery of calligraphy. The Grand Bazaar and Koza Han (Silk Bazaar) is close by so you can easily spend the whole day in this area and come back for repeated visits to the mosque to witness how the changes in natural lighting affects the calligraphy ❤️"
Feels modern!,The entrance and nearby surroundings are lovely but I was disappointed by the inside. It's monochrome which is interesting and different in itself. There was a feeling of ordinariness about it - a bit noisy and over relaxed. But worth a quick look.
Bursa Iconic Mosque,"Where you can find people relaxing and reading Quran after prayers, while looking at great work of islamic calligraphy and water fountain. A peaceful and soothing experi nce. A must visit if you are in Bursa."
Spectacular ,Interesting history and architecture. Fortunate to have a local friend who was a fascinating guide on the history of the place
Historial Mosque,"We get here by using ""Dolmus"" local tranport by paying 2 L per person. Then we were taking Ashar praying to this mosque. To use the rest room/toilet we need to pay 1,5 L. This place have a beautiful view for taking picture. Many souvenir seller around the mosque. Right in the middle of mosque their is water fountain that give nice sound of water inside."
Great!!!,A must see! Stunning inside and out... would definitely like to visit again in future.. was really amazing
Large central mosque with beautiful and peaceful interior,"The Great Mosque (a.k.a. Ulu Cami) is on the main street (where  the Atatürk Cd. becomes Cemal Nadir Cd.) and is the largest mosque in Bursa, showcasing Seljuk-style architecture. Many consider it the fifth most important mosque in Islam (after those in Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, and Damascus), and is included in Bursa’s 2014 UNESCO World Heritage Site description.  The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Bayezid I, and designed and built by architect Ali Neccar in 1396–1399. The large square building has twenty domes arranged in four rows of five, supported by twelve columns. According to legend,  twenty domes were built instead of the twenty separate mosques which the Sultan had promised after winning the Battle of Nicopolis over an allied crusader army in 1396. The mosque's two cylindrical minarets are prominent landmarks if you wander around central Bursa.  The interior of the mosque is spacious, filled with light, and has graceful calligraphy and floral motifs adorning the walls and columns.  At the center is a şadırvan (fountain) where worshipers can perform ritual ablutions before prayer.  The dome over the şadırvan is capped by a skylight which highlights the fountain's softly cascading water.  The mihrab (prayer niche oriented towards Mecca) is particularly fine, bordered by intricate decorative tiles and  bands of graceful calligraphy.  Throughout the interior are graceful inscriptions on the walls and columns written by famous Ottoman calligraphers of the period, one of the finest examples of Islamic calligraphy in the world. The interior is shielded from street noise and invites contemplation, encouraged by a reader softly reciting passages from the Koran.  The mosque is open during normal hours with no entrance fee (although a donation is gratefully appreciated).  Modest attire and removing one's shoes shows respect for this active place of worship."
The most beautiful of Mosques,"This mosque, which was built nearly 250 years prior to Istanbul’s Blue Mosque, is architecturally magnificent with the most wonderful calligraphy gracing the walls. A must visit, particularly just after Friday prayer when worshippers and Bursa citizens throng outside in the square."
Grosse Moschee,Not so impressive (I would much more recommend visiting the Green Mosque)But feel free to visit it as well if you have plenty of time
Beautiful mosque,One of the UNESCO heritage sites preserved dating from the 13th century. It consists of a conbonation of 20 domes with beautiful infrastructure within and also around the mosque.  The fountain looks even beautiful at night. A must visit while in Bursa

the great Mosque ,"very beautiful mosqud and it is not the same as the other mosques in Turkey..  i think when in Bursa, you should visit it"
Turkish mosque ,One of the most interesting mosque in Bursa. It was built in 1399. The calligraphy in the mosque is breathtaking! I particularly like the fountain in the center of the mosque. The spirituality in there is so peaceful! A must visit!
One of the most beautiful mosques in all world,The great mosque in Bursa is the most amazing thing to visit in Bursa and the most important mosque in all turkey!! It is 700 years old mosque but with very well refurbishment.
"Magnificent mosque, especially the interior ","Built by Sultan Beyazit 1 in 1399 after the crusaders left, this grand mosque with 20 cupolas and a fountain inside is not to be missed. We visited this magnificent mosque during the holy month of Ramadan and it was a living place, full of men and women, sitting as if they were at home, talking, praying and children, playing. It was unlike any mosque I have ever seen in Istanbul or anywhere else. It was like a meeting place for the people. The beautiful writings on the walls are explained in a screen in the mosque."
Don't miss this,"The ablutions area is inside the mosque rather than outside, and the fountain is restricted to men.  Don't know what women do.  The best part of this mosque is the calligraphy on the walls.  It is very beautiful."

Amazed,"This mosque totally amazed me, with a traditional fountain ablution (wudhu) area within the mosque, with an old Hizab cloth of the Turkish Kishwa."
Impressive One of the oldest Mosque ,"Impressive historical Mosque, shows alot about Ottoman style architecture art. It's in the centre of Bursa. It's a must-see place in Bursa. Would definitely recommend it."
Amazing Invaluable Ambiance,An honour to be here. Very refreshing atmosphere. There is a lovely fountain at the centre. Stay longer after prayers to cherish the calligraphy and great history.One must visit nearby surrounding shops that offer varieties of low price quality items. Much cheaper than in Istanbul.
Stunning architecture and beautiful Islamic calligraphy,Came here early in the day out of prayer times so the mosque was quiet. Theres a separate entrance for ladies but you can still meet up inside during visiting hours. There were so many examples of Islamic Calligraphy and i believe our guide said the mosque had like 12 domes. Really beautiful and good that its now a Unesco World Heritage Site.
Early example of Ottoman mosques,"Since Bursa was the first capital of Ottoman empire, this mosque is one of the earliest examples of grand mosques. There are 20 small domes instead of a big one since it was impossible in that period. For architecture buffs, you need to follow the success of Ottoman architecture in the 2nd capital Edirne and then finish in the last capital Istanbul."
Must see in Bursa.,"We were told there are a Great Mosque in every city, and we were very lucky to visited the one in Bursa. When you walked into the Mosque it gives you a sense of peace. We were very lucky to be blessed by the in charge of the Mosque, his voice is so beautiful. Although we did not understand his prayer, but it was very touching moment. After the ceremony he came to talk and bless each of us, it made our trip so much more special."
Must be,This very unique mosque is built in 1399 but artitech is not certain.Maybe one of the best in Turkey.Not only a mosque but also is a museum of caligrafy
Stunning!,"The Grand Mosque of Bursa is an Islamic masterclass in architecture, beauty and refinement. The mosque was finished in 1399 and is truly eye opening and a sight to behold.   In the centre of the mosque (inside the mosque) there is a fountain where water pours from and Wudu can be performed.Wudu can also be done outside the mosque, however, it seemed nice to be able to perform ablution in the prayer hall itself.The mosque is busy and it might pay to attend early if you are going to pray."
It's a Must ,"When you come to Bursa, you must visit it. It's a Must.  It is in the city center. While you are visiting you should listen the details about it from a guide. Every corner, every piece has a meaning or story. If you are Muslim you should join a prayer early in the morning and on Friday prayers.. it's gorgeous."
Big Historical  Mosque in Bursa,This grand historical  Masjid which  they call it  Ulu Cami is the   beautiful and big mosque in Bursa. surrounded with shopping area   .here you can buy different goods such as fruits . towels bedding sets   any also there is many different restaurants
A Working Mosque but Happy they Accept Visitors,"This is a great mosque.  Big and spacious with 50 domes as ceiling and great history.  Have to remove shoes but it is carpeted or wear socks if you prefer.  Great they allow pictures to be taken even if people do go there to pray.  As such, this is a great way to enjoy a mosque visit where you can see the day to day activity of people and their faith."
"Güzel, büyük, kalabalık","Beautiful building, simple, grand and fascinating.The Cami is full of people: praying, taking pictures, talking, laughing, children playing. It has a welcoming atmosphere to it. I went with my Muslim friend (him to pray, me for the sightseeing), and in some strange way this goes well together in this mosque. This is the number one thing to see in Bursa."
Ancient great mosque,I had an oppurtunity to pray tarawih (night prayer ' in this mosque.It was full house because it was the last night before eid.It reminds me of the Holy City Makkah and Madinah
Early example of a mosque ,Earlier example than Blue Mosque with 20 domes because they were still learning dome construction. In much better condition because it doesn’t have hordes of tourists visiting.
"Wonderful, great history of the area in central Bursa",I came here to see this sort of thing so it is amazing to be here and enjoy Turkish history. Safe area with lots to do and eat.
Great Mosque but bad amenities!,"Whenever you visit a mosque in Turkey, Jerusalem, Abu Dhabi, or wherever, you must be wearing a decent clothes, in this one, it's chaos and disrespectful! Men in shorts and funky Tshirts and women in shorts or open dresses! The smell of the carpets inside is horrible, really disgusting smell of shoes and sweat! It's a great mosque, with 20 domes, but you can't see these 20 domes from anyplace nearby. Moreover, no English signs for tourists.Anyway, I recommend to have a toast sandwich with Turkish Tea (Cay) from the place in front of it (nearby the fountain)"
Awesome mosque from 14.century ,"This is fantastic mosque built in 1399, means 610 years ago. It is still in service and the largest temple in the town. There is a fountain inside."

Good but restoration is sub standard,"The Mosque has been restored and painted with stickers or some sort of printed material. The Architecture is awesome but this restoration work has ruined it. There is nothing original you can see thereI went there for Juma Prayer and around one hour before masjid was full and there was no place for more comers. I think this is not the case all times. only Juma time was crowdedalso at that time despite too high roofs, there it was difficult to breathe due to congestion. There are no Air conditioners type thing because of Bursa wonderful cold weather I think"
A great architectural and calligraphic piece,"If you have visited Blue mosque or Sulemaniye camii you would have found them similar in structure. I can assure this Camii worth to visit as it is way different from those and quite interesting and different structure which make it unique. It has very magnificent calligraphic writing and art work  on walls/ If you are into calligraphy then you should visit this place and highly recommend it.

serenity,"A visit to Bursa cannot be completed without entering this mosque. Visit in the morning, take off your shoes enter the mosque find a place to sit and enjoy the inner piece. Do not be silly to wear leggings, shorts etc."
Multi-Domed Early Ottoman Mosque,"After the Turks conquered Byzantium (now Istanbul), they learned the art of building huge soaring domes from Hagia Sofia. This early Ottoman mosque was built in 1399, before the conquest of Byzantium in 1453, so it uses a radically different design. Rather than one huge dime, it has many small ones. This means the interior is cluttered with numerous support columns. This makes it seem less open and airy. The solemn stone walls and columns do have their own austere beauty however and some sections are decorated with paintings, which softens the overall effect. There is also a cooling fountain inside the mosque.The Ulu Mosque is very centrally located so huge crowds of pious locals pour in here all day. This is not a museum but a living mosque, so non-Muslims can visit but need to be sensitive and discreet. There will be many people praying during your visit."
too renovated.,"Though historic, interior is painted-- so no interesting tiles or other features.  The Koran inscriptions are spectacular though-- along with the scale of the place.  Check the fountain (cesme) outside."
Historic mosque,Everything in this mosque has a history of more than 400 years. The wooden structures.. the ablution fountain inside.. the tiles are simply amazing.
Feel the history,Ulu Cami is one of the oldest mosques of Bursa and located in the central position of the city. Inside atmosphere is amazing and outside is also has a good view. You can feel the hsitroy when you cam in Ulu Cami...
Water Fountain!!!,The sound of the fountain on a very cold day really doesn't help warmed me. But the masjeed is beautiful nonetheless. The layout is quite different than the other masjeeds I've seen. Soothing and calming
Tranquility,A super atmosphere with great historical value. This mosque is in the old historical centre. It is surrounded with a lot of small shops which are located in the old and historical (but restored ) buildings.
Impressive,"I'm sometimes find churches and mosques a bit sterile, but this Cami had a really nice and warm welcoming atmosphere. The building is very impressive and the water fountain is beautiful. The walk from Kent meydani to the mosque adds to the trip, so many back street markets! Would definitely recommend it."
Wonderful,"Ulucami is the last mosque built in the form of a ""grand mosque"" in Turkish Seljuk architecture. There are 20 domes (4*5) and 2 minarets. There is a fountain (şadırvan) under the middle dome which is unique for the mosques. You will be amazed by the caligraphy on the walls and columns, it is actually considered as the biggest calligraphy museum of the world since you can find some of the best and largest works of Ottoman calligraphy in the mosque. The ""minber"" of the mosque is considered as one of the finest pieces of Turkish wood carving art, you can see the solar system if you look closely, the biggest semisphere symbolises the sun and you can see the other planets around while the background is formed in the shape of Turkish stars. I am sure you will enjoy this great mosque and its surroundings."
A lovely mosque,"This is a large and interesting mosque which is well worth visiting. It predates the Turks capturing Constantinople and is quite different to those I'd seen in Istanbul. We felt welcome and able to look around. It is well worth a visit but do see the Green Mosque afterwards as that is the highlight of Bursa.Count the domes - there is a story that the conqueror of Bursa had promised to build 20 mosques if he captured the city but that an advisor suggested he could fulfill his vow through a mosque with 20 domes. (From Jane Taylor's excellent ""Imperial Istanbul"" guide.)"
must-see,Ottoman Masterpiece ; real must-see place with a great bazaaar around the area. perfect picturing place
Simple Elegance,"I decided to take a day trip from Istanbul across the Sea of Marmara. The Great Mosque was befitting a trek over land and sea. The mosque had many displays of antiquities and relics; however, it had some hints of modern and technical newness. I only wish I had a tour guide to teach me of the significance and meaning of every aspect of the mosque. It was a moving experience in Bursa!"
Best at Fajr Prayers,"Ulu Camii is best understood by Fajr Prayers. You should arrive early and attend to the prayer in the small section allocated for prayers behind the mihrab. You should definitely read a guide before visiting. If you cannot find a proper one, i suggest Bursa Ulu Cami Rehberi prepared by Mustafa Guleryuz. There are many important things to see in the mosque. However i think the most interesting one is Minber which proves the world as round by some 230 years before Galileo. In summary you should spend time to explore and best is to attend a tour with a licensed guide. This is a world heritage place, does not matter whether Unesco recognizes or not. You would like to go there again and again."
First time in Bursa,Entering the Mosque was the greatest moment i ever had. Beautiful architecture and cozy environment. Being there almost zohor prayer time. Some of the people are there for talk by the imam while waiting for the prayer time.
Must Visit,"One of the must visit places in Bursa, Turkey. This mosque is very unique and it feels amazing to pray in here."
Another Pilgrimage Place,"This is the most famous mosque in Bursa. They said the oldest one too. These Mosque has a magnificent and beautiful structure, quiet atmosphere inside and outside building. You can enjoy take photo inside and outside."
Magnificent,"The grand mosque is an enormous building with 20 domes supported on a minimum number of columns. For engineers this is something to see. The decorations on the inside are largely caligraphy, ranging from large signs praising Allah down to small plaques all be different caligraphers."
A place to see,It is beautiful as far as mosques go. Hand writings on the wall and overall architecture are amazing . It is open to all. Women and men can enter just to visit. It is customary for women to wear a head scarf when visiting. Do not enter with shoes.
Great calligraphy,The great mosque is a must see in Bursa.  Particularly the calligraphic writings that show a fantastic variety and beauty are worth to spend some time.
Almost seven hundred old Mosque,It s a magnificent building. There is history every stone. It's symbol of Bursa. Ulu Cami in city centre
Great Place,"Great place for prayer with peaceful feelings, the hotel location is in the heart of the local market"
Love it,The Ulu Camii is a beautiful place and the architecture is very different to the mosques in Istanbul. We really enjoyed visiting this mosque.
Calm and Welcoming ,"I find it hard to review a place of worship. The site is always more than just a building and will mean very different things to different people.As a non Moslem it found the experience very informative and helpful in developing an understanding of a different faith.The building is impressive, the sense of family and shared ideals by those worshipping was evident wherever you looked.Whatever your religion, keep an open mind it pays to look and understand other perspectives. Bigotry can only exist in a closed off space."
if you didn't see mosques before get it,"if you didn't see mosques before get it, we stopped by there in our way to the telefrek trip the mosque is nice and quite lovely but not for people seen many mosques before"
Very nice historical place,Very nice mosque.Recommend you to visit this place during your visit to Bless city.Place is very clean and nice area.
Great mosque,This is A wonderful mosque and highly recommended for a visit because it is early Ottoman architectural style and different from Istanbul mosques which contain mostly tiles on walls. And in this mosque the fountain in the middle makes you feel relaxed . Sit just for a few minutes by the fountain and feel the divine power
Beautiful place ,"What makes this mosque very beautiful is the water fountain in the middle. It is also beneficial to have it as people can wash up using it (it leads to individual taps so it is clean) without having to go the washrooms to wash up. Also, after washing, you are give a clean cotton towel to dry off.Definitely worth checking out!"
Majestic view ,"A Great mosque with Islamic tradition architecture, amazing huge building draws attention from outside as well inside with its unique majestic view. Landmark of Bursa worth the visit."
It seems great ,"Well large mosque,  lovely from in side,  great art work on the walls written art in arabic very nice. Unique Fontaine with skylight."
A peace of art must be seen,"It took us around 30 minutes to finish my second visit to this very old mosque. We took photos inside and you can notice that no change took place for its decoration at all, same fixtures, lights and the place for ablution is still in the middle of the mosque. The mosque is located in a very popular area where u can walk around easily. We tried a restaurant called ""Omar"" opposite to the mosque side entrance but the experience was horrible."
Beautiful and Peaceful,A stunning mosque which has a beautiful interior and exterior. Easy to find and look around. It has a relaxing and peaceful feel when wandering about. The history of the mosque is very interesting especially when you discover its historic significance to Islam. A real delight to see.
Spiritual power,"This is something great. This place has magical spiritual and special power. I have heard a legend about Ulu Camii mosque states that before an earthquake happened in Bursa in 1999 the souls of all previous Rulers (padishah) of the Ottoman period raised and prayed, and the security of the Mosque were the evidents of that...Entering the Mosque you feel peace of mind and wonder. At the enter a kerchief for women is provided. I recommend to visit this place notwithstand of your age, religion, nationality..."
I living here,"I ask all people to visit this mousqe and feel happy with powerfull , this mousqe have the Sultan,s room where he was setting and make meetting with people"
Beauty and Nobility,"It is one of my favourite mosques now. It is an absolute must see at the heart of the city. It is also taken into the Unesco World Heritage Sites in Turkey. It was build by the fourth Ottoman sultan Beyazıt I, the Thunderbolt in 1399. It has 20 domes! It is the largest mosque in Turkey."
Feel the difference!,"Amazing! ❤️ A must see, just feel the spirituality as you enter the world of hope, forgiveness and peace! One of the great; must sees in the beautiful Bursa!"
The most beautiful wall paints,"beautiful wall paints all around the mosque, charming fountain in the middle, big very big , give a great experience of ottoman mosques culture, must visit in Bursa"
Historically satisfying.,Place to be for historical and architectural fanatics who will have the chance to mix both under one destination. Arm yourself with adequate gadgets for fulfilling scenario.
Mezmerising,"There are several amazing things about this mosque that makes it unique:- The mystical minbar (pulpit) which is composed of 6666 pieces put in a lego-like way together without a nail, pin, glue nor adhesive- Beautiful calligraphy all over the mosque- Fountain for ablution inside the mosque (which is quite unusual) getting its light from above opening (which is also unusual of a typical mosque)- The old cover of Kaaba (the holy temple in Macca)- The bazaar surrounding the area where the mosque is situated- And many other fine details which is worth a visit to this beautiful place.P.S: There are several good places around to taste the locally famous food, especially a type of sliced meat with special sauce called ""iskender""."
Amazing work of calligraphers,"Its one of the amazing mosque of the Turkey. Its famous for its domes, wall inscriptions, fountain, minbar (made without using nails)..  You will spend most of your time for reading the monumental wall inscriptions which were written by the famous calligraphers of that period. As the mosque is just next to the Koza Hani, you might make a short visit to see the silks obtained from cocoons"
A welcome step into the past,My wife and I visited this mosque and we were made to feel very welcome.  Appropriate dress was provided to my wife and we were able to explore the beauty of the building in comfort.  This mosque is said to be the fifth most important in the Islamic world having been built in the 1390s.  One of the many items on display is a carpet dating back to 1517.  The history is fascinating but it was the warmth of the people that impressed me the most.  There were no tourist there when we visited (Friday at 11 a.m.).  Highly recommended
No one realized - Hidden science founding still here and see yourself.,Selcuj style and feeling of Ottoman. The architecture amazing and most spectacular is their paintings. Every site have a story to tell. The main entrance might look nothing but interior full of beautiful calligraphic and incredible meaning. U may find its peaceful to be here. Some Muslim may pray here and there so please pay respect by not to walk across them while they are praying. Walk to the oldest mimbar (the wooden tower) and then u will see the hidden science founding there. See yourself its truly amazing.
Great architecture,I went here a few times when Im in Bursa. This place is very lively as the Muslims and tourist keep on coming to the mosque.I was lucky to have a local explaining to me about the design of this Ottoman mosque. Every structure have its own significance. I like the sound of the waterfall as it have the calming effect. Worth the visit.
"Ulu Camii ,","i visited the mousqe and i really like the old islamic historical places as well , even i advice all ppl even non muslim to visit it :)"
A Striking building to see and visit,Very good architecture for the late 13th Century building. It has to be a place to visit when you visit BURSA. Its right in the Town centre just by Kozahan and the Bazaar (KapaliCarsi) along with a massive selection of places to eat nearby.
Great ,"Mosque is beautiful. Architecture is amazing and mostly ottoman original style. Inside the mosque you can see amazing calligraphy, as well as the fountain. Definitely must see when you're in Bursa."
Big mosque,"This mosque is huge, with 20 domes but the inside is pretty dull especially next to the green mosque."
Real gem of Ottoman Empire,"The Great Mosque is situated right in the city center, so there's no choice to miss it. Very interesting example of Ottoman architectural style. Must see."
The oldest Mosque in Burse,The mosque was built in 1399 has 20 domes and 2 minaretAnd very spacious .it is one of the great ottoman architecture .one of the best mosques I ever seen
Ulu Camii,"This is one of the most beautiful masjid I've been. It is also ranked as 5th masjid per importance. So nice calligraphy, one picture is amazing, picture of Kaaba, when you walk and look at the picture it seems that Kaaba door moving as well."
Master of Art,"It looks small and usual when you are outside. When you go inside, you see how high and large the ceiling is. Women can only enter when they cover their heads. The most offers scarves for free. You have to take off your shoes and leave them inside on the shelves at the entrance. If it is winter time, you will feel the cold floor even it is covered with nice carpet."
Breath taking architect and spirituality,One gets a very nice and calming feeling when they are inside this mosque that they want to stay inside !
A must visit ,The walkway through the bazaar ending up to the great Ulu Camii definitely something to savour. The mosque itself has amazing architecture and history behind it is fascinating. Surrounded by great shopping and restaurants this is a must visit. The interior is stunning as well. If lost it is a great point to use as navigation as all taksi and bus will be able to guide you to Ulu Camii.
Pretty on the inside,"Pretty, but similar to almost every other mosque in Turkey.  Once you've seen one, you've seen almost all of them"
Must see in Bursa,"The mosque has 20 domes, according to the local guide, this feat of 20 domes was a compromise for not building 20 separate mosques by the Sultan as a promise upon winning the battle of Nicopolis in 1396.  Whether its true or not, the wonder that is this mosque is incredible to see."
Relaxing atmosphere,"At the city center, next to all the historical places. The interior is nice.We went there as part of our Bursa tour on December 18th ."
What a amazing place,"This mosque is something you must see.It's huge, but very ''warm''.It's very old also.Probably one of most amazing buildings I've seen in my life."
inspiring place,this is a very special mosque and praying there makes you feel very relaxed. one has to visit here to see how inspiring this mosque is.
Bursa ,Really nicely done in the heart of Bursa..in Walking distance to city center Great history of ottoman empire..capital city of the time....
13 days around Turkey,"Bursa is our 1st stopped in Turkey. From airport, we take a bus directly to Bursa and cross by ferry from Kabatas. Stay one night in nice hostel, Onuncukoy which only 5' by walk to Ulu Cami and 15' to Uludag."
wonderful mosque,I have been here last year in Bursa and loved this mosque because of its decoration and pattern. huge simple mosque made it very special.
amazing arcitecture,How can the human built something like that.? It was amazing. If only it smells good .. had best do to deodorize the carpet scent.
Savas,Most beautiful and amaizing  building l have seen with a history to suit it strongly suggest for anyone who loves history or architecture will enjoy there time
Lovely,"A truly lovely mosque. Be sure to get there outside of prayer times to see it. Very heavily used, and in a lovely setting."
Plenty of Domes.....,"Great Mosque with a large rectangular structure with twenty domes, and Ulu Camii is the largest mosque in the city of Bursa."
Istanbul visit incomplete without it,"A must visit, along side the Hagia Sophia museum and the Topkapi Palace.  Spanning the centuries, buildings dedicated to God."
Thank you for welcoming visitors,This mosque was very busy both with visitors and worshippers. Would recommend having a guide to get the most out of this experience.
Good history but nothing more,It's a mosque with a great history behind it but that's it. The attraction is on the story behind the building of the mosque but the mosque itself. I don't find any great design or architecture behind it.
Beautiful Mosque!,"Beautiful, serene place filled with history and Islamic art, and Arabic calligraphy. The souk/shops around the mosque are definitely worth walking through and exploring! So cheap compared to where I live, and you can negotiate with the sellers."
Worth it for the Islamic art alone,This beautiful multi-domed rectangular mosque encapsulates the best of Ottoman architecture.  Of particular interest is the large 'bath' in the middle of the building in which worshippers can wash themselves before prayer.It's quiet place and provides rest and relaxation as well as a wealth of magnificent calligraphy.
Visit the mosque on any day but Friday.,"Bursa is a beautiful city. If you are visiting, you must visit the Ulu Cami, it is a beautiful building.  Visitors are welcome, however Friday's are very busy with the Friday prayers."
Beatiful islamic art,"mosque with beautiful old painting / islamic art and special ""Mehrab"" and ""Menbar""The fountains in the middle of the mosque is something creative and the glass dome in the top of it.you can read the history of the mosque on the description beside door"
Big Mosque in Bursa,Most Visiting historical building in Bursa (m.h. 1399). Ulucami is early architecture Ottoman Mosque like Selcuki architect.This Mosque contain twenty dome and two minaret. The mihrab decorated with astronomical figures are very famous. 9 planets in the solar system is depicted here.
Magic at the end of the silk road,"A visit to the old town in Bursa is a step into the markets and architecture of the silk road.  Many beautiful suks have been renovated and are in everyday use.  A little too much plastic furniture, but the buzz and atmosphere is great.   The area is overlooked by the fabulous Ulu Camii - unusual for having an indoor fountain.   Stand in the doorway and look in to the Islamic artefacts and out over the entire city."
Must visit place,"gorgeous design and wonderful lessons of islam glory , all bursa visitor should visit this place , read about this place before visiting for non turkish"
A nice place to visit. ,"We visited the mosque in the morning. It is big, full of natural light in its middle. It is simply decorated, not too busy for the eye. If you can spare the time - go and visit!"
Very unique and beautiful mosque ,Looks very plain from outside but beautiful inside. Can be very busy during prayer time. Worth a visit. Pay attention to the calligraphy on  the wall.
Must visit,The place has great history but the security and people were very rude. Transport is very close and the bazzar is next door
Holy place,"As its name calls, it is giant.. Still active for praying... Scarf is needed for ladies.  Surrounding is big bazaar where you can find local foods and souvenirs.."
Tranquille,One of the classical Imperial Ottoman Mosques that is a must for any visitor to Bursa. The cool airy interior is a pleasant refuge from the hot summer sun and the tea garden offers a peaceful haven for a quiet respite.
Ulu Camii ,"Built in 1396, the Grand Mosque or Ulu Camii has 20 domes and 2 Minarets. It is recognized amongst the the Holy places within Islam as to be the 5th place after Makkah, Madinah, Jerusalem, Damascus"
Great Emotions...,The ottoman's first downtown Bursa's best historical and islamic place... Visit here just on to dayborn... This is the best feeling abot the religional emotions and it helps your relax... Great...
Pleasant historic site,"Sparingly decorated inside, this cavernous place is fairly pleasant to walk around, though I found the voice of the preacher on duty detracted from the feeling of peace and holiness.  I enjoyed seeing the fine wood carving in the pulpit. Some of the calligraphy is interestingly worked."
Great experinace,"The mosque are great and amazing structure, we were on hurry but we enter and enjoy the sight scene. I would love to add more information for the history of this mosque but I do not have other than it is very beautiful experience walking around inside."
Beautiful magnificent,"If you enjoy architecture, it is great! If you want to feel spiritual then it is that! it is a historical sight enjoy it while you are there."
A must,It is the biggest mosque of anatolia. Just close to the koza khan. It is a must if you come to bursa. There is a picture of the holy kabe and you can see the door is watching you to every direction you go.
"Great mosque, best place in Bursa","Amazing, beautiful, artistic, marvelous, wonderful i am infact out of objectives to describe this beautiful mosque. A must to do once you are in Bursa. I felt it as marvelous as blue mosque or Sulemaniya mosque in Istanbul."
A UNESCO site,"The mosque was quite empty when I visited. This is the second mosque I have been to, after the Blue Mosque in Istanbul. It certainly does not have the 'wow' factor as in the Blue Mosque. I came here mainly because it is a UNESCO site."
artistic inside,"One of the great mosque I ever visited. interior design is very Turkish with water fountain in the center that used to be for ablution before praying and also can make cool place when in summer. the lamps also amazing, very Turkish architecture...."
"Great mosque, unique a must to visit","The architecture is unique! Wonderful calligraphy on the walls, There is a beautiful fountain in the middle of the mosque! Really worth the visit"
Family ,Had been there with my wife and two grown up sons on our family holiday to Turkey and visited Bursa.As a lover of Islamic Architecture The Grand Mosque fascinated me as the calligraphy there in the mosque and on the walls was awesome and amazing.It was a very soul satisfying and sublime experience.Dr.Javed Rasheed
Best Mosque in Bursa,"At its peak, this was the fifth most holy sites in Islam. This 20 domed mosque has its walls covered with calligraphy and a fountain in the center. Here you will find many people studying and praying throughout the day. In addition, on one of the walls hangs an old Kaaba covering. This is the best mosque in Bursa so if you are short on time, come here. It's also next to a large market complex."
Old architecture,"A very interesting mosque, with huge calligraphy on its interior wall. There's a fountain, for the ablution right in the middle of the mosque. Take a close look at the mimbar/pulpit, there's a carving on the solar system."
Should see,One of the biggest mosques in Bursa. Great decorations. Interesting to learn mysteries of every place in the mosque.
Must do list in Bursa,"This is the big one in Bursa, it's historic, it's big (Ulu means mighty), it's so serene and peaceful."
Absolutely amazing mosque,I loved this mosque because of unique decoration and style. I am amazed how people could have done this  and praying room was great/
The kindness extended to us is typical of Islam,"It was pouring with rain,my shoes were saturated and the rest of me wasn't faring much better but I doggedly pushed on. It was prayer time when visitors are not allowed in Mosques. Fair enough. After some wheedling by our guide the sentries at the door took pity on the pathetic dripping wet petitioners and allowed us 5 minutes. It was rather special being in a mosque at prayer time. The men and women worshipped together but not sideby side. Thank-you for your kindness."
Ulu Camii,"This is the fifth most revered mosque in Islam and has a very open and inviting atmosphere. Women are not separated off from the men, children are allowed to run around and it feels very relaxed.  The openness of the architecture encourages this freedom."
A positive Experience,Truly something to see when visiting Turkey to gain insight and appreciation for another culture.   Experienced a feeling of good from the people and the atmosphere of the space.   Beautiful workmanship and detail
Understated Beauty,The light shining through the large central dome onto a fountain and small pool give this mosque an etherial quality. I didn't see an area screened off for women; instead I noticed women and men in open areas along the outer wall of the mosque praying alone.
beautiful mosque,loved the architecture and interiors of the mosque so beautiful! location is in the heart of bursa next to the bursa bazar.
A Knowledgeable and Enlightening Spiritual Experience,This is mosques that requires a guide to explain the significance of the various Qur'anic calligraphy. It's a mosque that was built from 1396 to 1399. This mosque should be visited to experience it's  dynamic ambience and spirituality.
Stunning!,"Very unique and different from other mosques I've visited. I especially loved the Arabic caligraphy, which is throughout the mosque."
Number 1 must visit in Bursa!,"Bursa is naturally very beautiful especially with the Uludag (the great big mountain).  Bursa is also the hometown of Turkish silk, iskender kebap and car manufacturing.  But what is more important is that Bursa is the first capital of the Ottoman empire and at the center of it is the Ulu cami or the Grand Mosque ..... a marvelous piece of history.  Unlike any other mosque in the world, it is significant for having all these amazing calligraphic pieces of Art .... nothing like this in the world.After visiting the mosque, one can go and walk and shop around in the historical bazaar .. then end his or her trip with a nice meal of Iskender Kebap."
looks like nothing but,I haven't visited a million of them but this one was the first one I saw with a fountain right in the middle of it for the beleivers to go and wash before prayer... quite amazing to withness.
A mosque on a grand scale,very large and impressive mosque. Beautiful calligraphy and very welcoming. Surroundings are great too and give a good view of the interesting domes for a roof.
The 5th Holy Mosque of  Muslim World,"Ulu cami, the Grand Mosque in Bursa, is one of the oldest & holiest  worship center of Turkey which was built in  between 1396-1399 by Bayezid I during the enlargement of Ottoman state. According to  one of the folk legends, Ottoman sultan Bayezid I  prayed for  Allah and promised Him  that Sultan would  build 20 mosques if he was the winner of battle of Nicopolis against to Crusaders in 1396. After the victory, he wanted to build 20 mosques first as he promised but Emir sultan, the great sufi of its time and son-in-law of the sultan, recommended him to build a grand mosque with three gates and 20 domes so Ulu cami was built for this advice. It contains 3 gates, 20 domes, 2 minarets and a fountain in the middle for ablution. The mosque has an excellent apperance, architectural form and location in down downt to reach easily. As soon as someone enters  the mosque from a gate, he/she come across with a holy atmosphere which makes a great  impact as having peace and glory. The eyes catches the calligraphic wall inscriptions in Arabic making a mystic shade and cannot stop looking at the beauties. The mosque has 193 calligraphic wall decorartions written  41 famous calligraphers in 14 different handwritten forms. The inner part of the mosque covers an area of 2215 square meters divided into five main sections. The fountain in the middele of the inner court is the fisr foundation  build in the state and it has been serving to the prayers to clean  their bodies before they devote them to Allah.  Ulu cami is consiredered the 5th holy mosque in Islamic world after Mesjidi-Haram in Mecca, Mesjidi Nabavi in Medina- Mesjidi Aksa in Jaruseelam and Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Emil Sultan offered to sultan to be built,  Somuncu baba was the first imam and the first calling prayer inviting the people was Suleiman Chalabi. It is believed that Hazrat Khidr-ghost prophet-  has a spirutal office on the right side of   vav calligraphy next to the altar. It is "" must "" to visit in Bursa trip and I hope no one will  miss this holy place."
Beautiful,An ancient mosque with beautifully exceptional decorations that went centuries back. It is a must visit for muslim travellers. The prophet Khidir was said to have performed prayers in this mosque.
A very serene mosque,"A bright and quiet mosque. After visiting the Sulthan Ahmet mosque (Blue Mosque) in Istanbul this mosque feels more peaceful, partly since the Sulthan Ahmet mosque is now a big tourist attraction with the great stream of people coming for its fame."
Different from other Mosques,"This Mosque is different from the others. Instead of ceramics and majolicas it has painted walls decorated with arabic inscriptions. There is also a large fountain for ablution in the middle. A screen translates arabic into latin characters (only turkish tough, or at least I couldn't find any English)"
Beautiful calligraphy,The Great Mosque is a must see in Bursa. The interior is decorated with large inscriptions written by famous Ottoman calligraphers. A serene place with no other tourists when we visited.
"Beautiful, serene mosque",The mosque has a beautiful interior architecture. The fountains inside the mosque create a serene environment. Worth visiting for people who loves to see beautiful designed wall tiles which Turkey is famous for.
Local Mosque,"A typical and beautiful mosque frequented by locals, peaceful and not touristic like others! You must visit it when visiting Bursa"
SubhanAllah,"This mosque is beautiful! The place is not only for show but is functioning too. Real people pray there. And to me, that is a plus as the camii is not there to show only architectural wonder but also the religion under it. The fountain was amazing and seems to be people's favorite. Many took pictures there. Very nice place. This is a must visit place when you come to Bursa, Turkey."
nice,"Go have a look .1399 building,and bazaar just beside .Look for Metro restaurant in osmangazi for the best kebab in bursa"
Fantastic place,"It's fantastic mosque specially the interior fountain, the dome of the glass and the cover of the Kaaba.Very peasefull place and I advice the visit it."
A peaceful place in the centre of Bursa,"Beautiful interior. Just go there and relaxing atmosphere. Of course the wooden works are very impressive, but there are also other hidden gems."
Ulu Camii - nice mosque,"When you visit Bursa you certainly have to visit the Great mosque. I liked this mosque because of the nice kalligrafi, the drawing of 'the planets'. The prayer area for men is nice, that for women is very small."
great interior,"i like this mosque, unique with wudhu pool inside the mosque. there's a wall full of kaligrafi of Allah< Muhammad, ect"
historical,"love the prayer area inside the mosque, but the ablution for woman is placed outside while man's is inside"
Ulu Great mosque [ must see in Bursa],"i like this mosque, what a place !!in bursa center near all attractions, near hotelssince 1399 عاصمة العثمانين الأولى بعد الاستقلال عن السلاجقة الاتراك"
Magnificent interior,"This is a very unique mosque with the pictures, frames and decorated interior within the mosque. It's open to the public to allow them to appreciate the mosque as a masterpiece. The water fountain in the centre is also pleasant. Definitely needs to be visited."
Amazing interior,The fountain in the middle of the mosque is something quite unusual in this mosque. It has an amazing interior crafted with various khat writings. Impressed!
Beautiful mosque,We visited the mosque after visiting the market next to the mosque. It is a very unusual mosque that we liked very much
Open and Active,Gives a great view of an active Mosque. Ornate and well kept as expected. Right in heart of downtown Bursa.
Grand Mosque and Pool,"There is a big pool in the mosque. Do know why?The mosque was built 14. century. Before the mosque there was a large house there. House's owner was a woman. Sultan wanted her house and said that a big mosque will be built there.  She answered ""if you let the fountain stay there I can sell to you my house"". Sultan promised and a big pool was built onside of the fountain."
A classical place to visit,"A must-see place in Bursa, if you are interested in cultural background. It's just in the center, a smal walk from the Koza Han"
Beautiful and unique,One of my favourite mosques whilst visiting Bursa and Istanbul. The centre fountain was just stunning! The architecture and layout is so different from the large mosques in Istanbul (sultan ahmet etc) it was nice to have a contrast.
The Great Mosque of all times,It's so big it's so great but when you enter from the doors it does not feel that massive at all. So peaceful so calm. The building is fabulous.
very nice mosque,"I prayed in there ! very historical and different ! anybody Who has chance to go to Bursa  needs to see it,"
the great mosque,that´s beautiful place like the people there very nice  ready go for to small shopping nice go to dinner go to gym play tennis go to walk
Historical but not so beautiful,It's nice to visit because of the historical sigificance but it's not one of the most beautiful mosques I've visited.
Worth to visit!,"When I entered this mosque, I felt really peaceful. The area was so big and very calming. I still can listen people reciting Quran slowly in the mosque.Also, I can see one beautiful fountain in the middle of the mosque for the prayer taking wuduk. The wall was painted beautifully by the greatest calligraphers during the Ottoman Empire . Everything just simply amazing. This mosque is a combination of rich and beautiful  Islamic calligraphy art and also the intellectual Ottoman Architecture design.Visited April 2012"
Special Mosque,"I was told this was a special mosque, especially because there is a fountain in the middle of the mosque. The interior looks nice and worth a visit. I believe it is the first mosque I have been in in my life. Good thing: it is free!"
Beautiful,Handsome building with wonderful caligraphy on the walls.  A highlight of our visit.  There are fine wood carvings inside as well.
superb interiors,Even if you're tired of seeing mosques you should go inside this one. It's very ottoman and with impressive calligraphy designs on the walls.
Unique Mosque in a unique city,"Bursa is an amazing city, it was a pity it was our last stop and we could not really enjoy it. The city respects its history and is one of the most important ottoman's place to understand the empire and its importance. Ulu Mosque is unique, the fountain right in the middle makes it a surprise. I really like mosques because they are very peaceful places, but this mosque seems even more special, the lighting and the fountain gives you the feeling that you are outside, very interesting. Being beside the bazaars it is very refreshing to enter and have some peace while all is so busy outside."
A mosque with a difference,"This is the must-see attraction in Bursa. Having already visited mosques in Istanbul, I was expecting this to be similar, but I was cetainly wrong. There was a fountain for ablutions in the middle of the mosque, and the light shone on it from the domed roof above. You had to look closely to see that above the fountain there was actually a hole in the roof. No part of the moque floor was closed to tourists, so you had to be careful to respect those who were praying, but the whole mosque seemed to have a more laid back atmosphere, with children running about, for example. I really enjoyed the vibe and we were able to sit in the mosque and watch what was going on."
Peaceful place,This mosque is just beside shopping area. After our shopping we visited the place for prying and refreshment.Like other Turkish mosques it is having a historical touch.
Amazing construction,"While visiting the Bazaar and centre of Bursa city,you come close to this magnificent Mosque which has still the largest area for praying among all mosques in Turkey.Very nice architecture and ambiance as the flow of water through the fountains inside the mosque gives another exciting athmosphere for the visitors.Due to its very central location it is always crowded.Strongly recommended."
Getting Ready for Ramadan,"I visited this mosque on the day before Ramadan began, and the mosque staff was in full mode cleaning the place, including using carpet cleaners and spraying of fragrant mist.  The mosque is unique in that the center has a fountain for ablutions. The story I was told that when the Sultan undertook to build the camii, he had to buy up land from the owners on whose land the building was to sit.  One lady, a non-Muslim, did not want to sell, but finally agreed if her land was not to be used for religious purposes. Hence, the fountain,which much adds to the beauty and majesty of the building.  Lots of wonder Arabic calligraphy and beautiful woodwork.  Well worth a visit."
A mosque,"If you are not a great fan of mosques, this one does not offer much difference from the others. The mosque is at the city center, next to nearly all of the historical places."
Impressive,This is highlight all in town. Great mosque with very peaceful atmosphere inside. Caligrafies are impressive and gorgeous. Interesting with a pool in the middle.
A very good mosque but Language problem,It was really a good and ancient mosque ! And I was just imaging that how Sultans and their wives and all walk on same floor on which now we r walking ......A was were tourists so we in need of a guide so it will be more knowledgeable about this mosque as it is ancient .. But every guide has a big problem in speaking English ......Otherwise loved the tour and placesIf u'll try to go please ask ur travel agents to arrange a guide because without guide u can seek the depth of that thing
Great architecture...,One of the grreatest and most historical place that you HAVE to visit in Bursa..!!The feeling of that time is immense...
Large old mosque,"I'm afraid that I found this many-domed and ancient mosque a bit of a bore inside, dominated as it is by huge calligraphic plaques.  The mosque was often impressive from the outside, and from above!"
Not so big but interesting,"Our guide told us about how the Sultan had built a mosque with 20 domes instead of building 20 mosques. The fountain and so much natural lighting in the centre made it special and different from other mosques. The carved pulpit and calligraphy were beautiful too. Being a proper mosque, shoes need to be taken off and ladies' hair covered."
An old mosque with a very interesting  interior,"As this mosque was built in 1399, I was very surprise to see all things inside are still well maintained and how beautiful and modern the inside interior of the mosque."
Calligraphy,The beauty of the mosque is the Islamic Calligraphy. It has multiple domes and grand inside. It is situated in the center of town.
Masha ALLAH,"Turkey has many many beautiful mosques. After visiting this, I added another count to my visit of these beautiful mosques. Ulu Camii is bit different than others. First because of its beautiful paintings of ALLAH beautiful names & Ayat of Quran Karim. Secondly the facinating fountain for performing Ablution. Its one of the most beautiful mosques I ever seen. Its must visit while visiting the beautiful city of Bursa."
feel the mıstısm,"The great mosque ,probably ıs the famous mosque.Very  bıg and ınfluence all publıc.ıt ıs located center of the cıty and so close to close bazaar.Evereybody came to Bursa have to see there."
Disappointing after Istanbul,"We had been in Istanbul before and after that, this mosque was disappointing. There is a fountain inside which makes it feel less sacred in a way and the mosque is split into many parts by columns which also substracts from the impressiveness."
"The great mosque, Bursa","Much nicer than the blue mosque in Istanbul. Has a lovely fountain in the middle, interesting designs on the walls, a sense of real spiritual community."
Very nice mosque,Very nice mosque used by worshippers when we visited. We saw a couple praying/contemplating together.
Beautiful,"One of my favorite mosques in Turkey and one of the most beautiful mosques I've ever visited. The calligraphy is amazing, and I always find something new and interesting on each visit."
a museum of calligraphy,"one of the oldest mosque in turkey and with over 40 domes, the great mosque has simple architecture yet inside is where its beauty lies. there are over 100 calligraphy from over 40 masters. beautiful and no calligraphy is the same. u can spend hours just looking at each calligraphy. in my opinion the most unique of all the interior design of  mosques i have seen in my travels. a must see in bursa. with light showering in the centre of the mosque on the fountain, visually its like a garden of art and calligraphy"
great architechture,"It an amazing feeling when inside this Ulu Camii.  The architecture, workmanship, crafts and arts is just awesome. Able to find my own sweet moment to have the Turkish coffee just few metres away. It was a wonderful morning then."
Amazing,beatiful monument! The mosque has a foundation in the middle and spesicial caligraphy on the walls. You feel surprized to see how big it is.
Some Tips,"1. If the weather permits, just wear slipper. It will save you the hustle of open your shoes as there is no proper chair/bench to sit. It will get uglier if the crowd coming out from the mosque.2. There is beautiful fountain inside where prayer can do the ablution but unfortunately it is just for men."
Great Mosque in Bursa,"Visit this mosque if you're in Bursa.  It's beautiful.  Outside the mosque is a silk market you can go / visit and maybe buy some.  Otherwise, have a Turkish chai (tea) and enjoy people watching. Lots of local people go to this place for tea and chat."
One of the nicest Mosque,This was one of the nicest mosques we have visited (not including Istanbul).  There is a fountain in the centre of the mosque and is built in Ottoman style.  It is well worth a visit.
Large and impressive,"A great mosque in the middle of Bursa, alongside the bazaar, sporting one, large minaret.Very spacious inside, with some beautiful features."
Impressive,"My husband & I visited this mosque just before visiting the Silk Market as they're conveniently near each other. Ladies need to cover their heads, as well as dress modestly & everyone has to wear provided footwear protection.The Arabic calligraphy is beautiful, the 3D artwork is clever & the centre piece of the fountain is wonderful. It’s spacious & light inside & we were lucky that it wasn’t too busy during our visit. Prayers & worship was ongoing but visitors could walk around quietly, without being intrusive."
Beautiful,Amazing interior with the fountain inside. Nice to have a look around.Completely different from the mosques we had seen in Istanbul.
The Great Mosque..The Great Architecture..,"When you visit Bursa, Turkey, you must visit this mosque. This mosque is the biggest one in Bursa and a landmark of early Ottoman architecture. this mosque was designed and build by architect Ali Neccar in 1396-1399. It is a rectangular building with twenty domes arranged in four rows of five that are supported by twelve columns. I love to see the fountain inside/in the middle of this mosque. This fountain for worshipers so they can perform ritual ablutions before prayer (taking wudhu before prayer). The dome over the fountain is capped by a skylight which creates a soft light below. Its really beautiful here. The interior of the mosque is amazing with a lot of beautiful Quran calligraphy. There're are many shops, restaurants surrounding this mosque. This mosque is also close to Bursa Bazaar/Market too. Put your shoes in to plastic bag that provided in the entrance of the mosque (free) before entering this mosque. Remain quite inside because this mosque is an active mosque and many people are praying here during the praying time."
Ulu Camii,The mosque in Bursa is the bigest one and the best Arabic calligraphy you can find in this Mosque. It's in the center of old town in bursa and close to all bazaars. The interior of the mosque is amazing specially the Quran calligraphy all around the internal walls.
Beautiful,"A must see mosque for Muslims, especially muslims from turkey.Inside The mosque there is a Aldo a large spring."
A masterpieces of Ottoman architecture,"Great Mosque is one of the important masterpieces of Ottoman architecture among the five most important sanctuaries of the Islamic world and is also the most attractive building in the city, Bursa-Turkey"
Beautiful,"A must see mosque for Muslims, especially Muslims with Turkish origin.The mosque is located in the city center and is near the tombs of Osman and Orhan gazi."
The architecture of beauty and peace,"'The Ulu Camii'= The Great Mosque is a must visit when you spend a few days in Turkey. The beautiful architecture, mind blowing callegraphy all around the mosque's walls, and the beautiful small water fountain in the center (originally created for Muslims' ablution before praying) give the place a great atmosphere and brings a sense of deep imitation. As a sign of respect to this sacred place, non-Muslim women must were decent clothing which includes long dress or pants and a scarf (both are provided at the entrance if you forgot yours). I personally visited the Ulu camii twice but still longing for another visit :)"
Interesting Mosque to Tour,We very much enjoyed The Great Mosque.  Our tour guide went into great detail to tell us about all parts of the mosque and about the architecture of the building.  It is situated in a lovely old part of the city which was just grand for exploring.
Calligraphy,This is one of Turkey's most beautiful mosques!  The calligraphy is truly a work of art.  Be sure to have a guide or a someone to point out the highlights of the Mosque!
Amazing,I just love Seljuk style with its pale red coloured bricks.Its one of the finest places in Bursa and a must see place.
The Great Mosque,"This mosque has a great Architachural design from the inside, 10 Doms with great decorations, has a water fountain in the middle of the prayer area (for ablution). It has an old legend behind building it. It is located in the middle of Bursa town with a nice public park behind it."
