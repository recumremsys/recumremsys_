Great replica of Peter the Great's ship,It is possible to visit the ship only on a guided tour.  So I joined one of the groups that leaves every hour.  The tour is quite good.  HIghly recommended!
Pirates in real life,The ship is an amazing work of art. I loved the tour. Considering the time it was built this is a piece of equipment ahead of its time. The canon display is magnificent and the public circle is very clean. Nice place to visit when in Voronezh
Great place to visit,Great place to visit. Especially in the morning when no one there. The ship is very beautiful and unusual
Great Tour of Replica of Peter The Great Ship,"Guided tours, only. Apparently scheduled on the hour.  Excellent tour throughout the three stories of the completely equipped and furnished ship. Knowledgeable Russian speaking guide. Photos, including flash, permitted from time to time. No restrooms available. Rather long, hilly walk from most hotels; do not attempt this in winter. Taxis are economical, but pick up at the ship may be difficult even for Russian speakers, unless sure of the address. Ask cashier for assistance."
weekend - not open ?,"We went there on a saturday, but museum was closed... Usually museums are open to the public on weekends, especially in september. From outside, nothing special."
It's a pirate ship!,"Well it looks like a pirate ship but for now, only floats in the river that goes through Voronezh.  I enjoyed walking on it and having my girl friend tell be about it, in English, after she looked up everything in Russian. I've been on other sailing ships and this one is a good as mos. It was just better being in another city and sharing the experiance with some one I cared for.  I enjoyed the ship because at one time, I helped build and sail boat and know what it takes."
Must to be visited in Voronezh!,"Very real looking replica of ancient warship, of Imperator Peter's the Great times. Interesting story about the beginning of Russian fleet as such. I would never imagine that it begun in Voronezh not St.Pete. Advice: get somebody who will translate you the story from Russian :) Otherwise you'll take only visual impression, though it is also not bad"
The ship maker -Peter the Great,"Peter the Great was a keen sailor and came to Deptford UK to learn how to build ships. He returned home and constructed this ship with around 23 different types of wood.The interior is a fascinating insight to life on board at that time and peeping out of a window at the back of the ship you may be able to see the outdoor loo, if you are tall enough."
Visit to Ship-Museum Goto Predestinatsia,This visit was little disappointing as the place was out of bounds the day I visited. This is a replica of the ship that made the Russians proud as this was the first ship built without help from foreign experts. I feel that the tourism authorities should put up a stall near by so that people like me can buy some mementos for keeping the memory of the visit.
