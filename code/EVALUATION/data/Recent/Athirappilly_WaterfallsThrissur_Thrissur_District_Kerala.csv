A scenic and Mesmerizing View,"We visited through car from thrissur, with a family of 4.Place can be easily located through maps and the way to reach the uphill is slightly hilly. May be little tough for new drivers, while experience can handle with ease. Though it is hot day, the view is superb and one can witness the chill breeze over their face. There is entry fee for vehicles and people including childrens. No major food at hills , you can have some drinks near falls, but one can find many hotels on the way. There is one petrol bunk on half-way mark to falls, just-in case if you lack fuel for vehicle.Cons: No proper parking for vehicles, all were forced to park on either side of the road."

My visit in May (summer) was quite untimely as the waterfall was very narrow and the…
Nice view only,Not worth taking the trip as the place is poorly maintained & the paths are slippery. Not for older folks & children. No warning signages to warn of steep inclines & descents. It's a shame to Kerala tourism. 
Nature's beauty,Went there to see the water falls but we could see only  narrow falls since there was no rain for a week . Better time to go there is August to November.There is a rock layed passage to river and downside of the falls.Way to downside of the falls is steepy but looking very…

Not The Best Time To Visit,"Didn't see this place at its most impressive because I went just before the monsoon, so water levels were very low.  At the top of the ""falls"", most of the rocks & channels were exposed. The cararact was just a small stream falling over the edge into the valley below. You can…"
Nice place,"After having seen many waterfalls all over the world, this pales into insignificance.  However, this is place is good and well developed by the Forest department ( it is plastic free).  If you carry a plastic water bottle, they put a sticker on it and ask you to deposit Rs.10. …"
Great place,"Its beautiful and its beautiful during rains, must see this for people in kerala.. The place gets very crowded then"
The largest waterfall in Kerala,"Athirappilly, located in the western ghats is greenish through out the way is just 17 km from Chalakudy town in Thrissur. This attracts a large number of tourists whole the year. An eco-friendly location and the road leads to the famous hill station called Malakkapara."
Tour,One of the best waterfalls in kerala. I visited so many times. Last one was on March 2019. Best place for family get together and family trips.
Locals vs Waterfalls,I found it more interesting to watch how the locals spend their day with their loved ones in the river than to watch the waterfalls. Do remember not to tempt the monkeys. The whole hike to and fro will take you an hour. You should not be spending more than 1.5hrs there. You might enjoy taking a walk to see all the small stalls lined up outside the entrance gate. Have fun!
Amazingly close to nature,A mesmerizing feel of mother nature. The nature's way of keeping the earth cool. You will never forget this feel if you visit once to this beautiful place. The roads are amazing kept well and you'll love the nature on the way. There is a pine forest on top of the falls where you can sit and enjoy the beautiful view of the water falls.

Watterfall of fun and joy,A nice place for family that is enjoyed most by children with water related fun games and this place is enrute to tourist destination Munar
The biggest and best waterfall in God's Own Country !,"This is by far the biggest and best water fall across India ! If you are planning a vacation in Munnar, include this water fall in you itinerary !  You can either visit it briefly on the way to Munnar from Kochi Airport or plan to stay overnight as good hotels are availavble nearby. Just stay by the water fall and enjoy the scenic view and beauty of the fall ! it takes about an hour and half to reach from Kochi Airport. If you are adventurous best time to visit is during monsoon, or just after the that. If you are on liesure trip with family, November to January is the best time of the year for the visit !!"
Place of Joy,This place is always special to visit as we can enjoy the fresh water bathing. Visit early hours to escape from the hot sun. The heat waves from the rocks are too much.
Disappointed and worst tourist location in Kerala,"From Chennai we have been to Valparai via Pollachi. While coming back, our boys wants to visit Athirappilly water falls thus we have changed our route via Chalakudy that was the costly and unforgettable decision we made and resulted the following annoyance and crap experience.  …"
It’s a hidden treasure,"It’s a hidden treasure. If you are expecting a Niagra falls, not the right place but the falls are huge and beautiful. "
Nice day trip from Fort Kochi,"A pleasant drive from Fort Kochi with undulating hills and rural/forest scenery. The walk down and back up to the falls was easy for someone of average fitness.

Mighty Falls,"Beautiful WaterFalls, Visit during monsoon season, when the falls are at the peak. Try to get the view from Rainforest resort ,truly amazing"
the biggest water falls in the region,"you need to walk a bit longer than u think to reach the location as it is very far from the place we buy the ticket,also dont feed the monkeys it is very dangerous specially if u r with thye childrens, a treat for the eyes and ears best view is below the water falls"
Family tour,"This Water fall is awesome, you can see three falls at one glacealso can have nice small trekking from top to bottom. However lots of monkey's near this water fall,  just need to take proper precautions if you have any carry bag otherwise monkey's may snatch it."
Beautiful place,The falls located about 30 km from Chalakudy town of Kerala state. Plenty of road transport available for the 1hour trip.This falls of Chalakudy river is in Athirapally village. The road lies along the banks of the river with water keeps flowing silently and incessantly.Thanks to the good infrastructure built by the authorities. Nobody is allowed to enter the area near the falls as water falls from about 100 feet height.Really a nice place to get recharged physically and spiritually.
Falls are good though closed at some points ,"The beautiful falls can be seen only from a distance.  The river leading to the falls is closed for access since the guards say that there are many glass pieces in the water due to the recent floods. You can go to the foot of the falls. However, if you have difficulty walking or have any type of bone/joint issues,  please avoid going to the foot of the falls as both the ascend and descend are very slippery and dangerous. As far as possible, wear only sports shoes or flat footwear with good grip. Avoid heels at any cost. Carry sunglasses and hat also. Entrance fee is Rs.50. Absolutely no plastic allowed. However you can carry water in tupperware bottles. There are a few snack stalls near the falls. Use public transport like bus to reach the Waterfalls if you don't have your own vehicle.  There are a lot of shops on the main road near the entrance to the Waterfalls where you get curios, toys and other snacks.  There are a few good restaurants also.  Police aid post and first aid post are available for emergency."

Bahubali falls,We were here last month to take a sneak peek at the famous waterfall scene from bahubali and it did not disappoint. It takes a bit of hike to visit this place. Make sure to carry a waterbottle as the hike can make you tired and thirsty.
Amazing,Amazing natural water fall .We enjoyed a lot. Should be very carefull if children are with u because the way to water fall is little slippery. Also obey the instructions of forest guards and life guards.
A sight to behold,True wonder of nature. A very serene and soothing surrounding near the falls. Accessibility is not an issues as it is on main road. A decent ticket amount of 30 per head and some vehicle charges. The view is just astounding. The entrance to falls takes you to top of the falls.…
Water power,"The pounding power of water can be experienced here, a short day trip from Thrissur city. Along with Chappa Falls, a little further away, Athirappily waterfalls ensure that water power stays in memory, indelibly."
Magnificent waterfalls,"I hadn’t heard of these waterfalls before (though I had actually seen it onscreen—some of the most dramatic moments of the recent blockbuster Baahubali were shot here). However, visiting a friend in Thrissur, I was taken off by her to see the falls, which are located up in the…"

Watet works,Awesome place.flim location. Now due to full rain the water fall is looking awesome.nice place to visit with family. Road conditions are good but drivers kindly avoid high beam .nice place
Exhilarating experience!!,"Well I had an amazing time....the experience of looking at the water roaring down with such force is indeed exhilarating. Athirapallly is the largest waterfall in Kerala, which stands tall at 80 feet. I visited this place mid July, due to heavy rains we were not allowed to go down but to stand above.... the waters kept roaring like a monster ☺. The best part is this place is plastic free!! The walk from the gate to the falls is steep and it will take you a moment to come face to face with the huge roaring falls. Just loved it, must visit!!! Definitely coming back next year..."
Best of monsoon,Athirappilly is about 60 km from Thrissur town in Kerala State. This place can be reached by Chalakkudi Valparai Road. State Transport and Private buses are available from Chalakkudi. Entry to the waterfalls is managed by Forest department. Entry fee for adults is RS.30/- . Ticket window is few meters before the parking. The ticket includes entry fee for Vazhachal waterfalls which is about 3km from Athirappilly. In monsoon the falls was in full swing. Probably this is in competition with jog falls and Dudh Sagar  for the no.1 slot in India. The best time to visit is just at the end of monsoon.
Athirappilly review,Athirappilly waterfalls is the best place to be in at the onset of monsoon especially in the month of june
Nature at its best.,"This place, rich with its flaura n fauna has its wilderness preserved since ages. Attractive but dangerous water falls are mesmerising. Best visit is in monsoon. "
Great relief from the heat,This place was spectacular got down to where the locals were and was cooled down by the misty spat of these water falls
Waterfalls,One of the best waterfalls in Kerala.Its been featured in many Indian movies including Bahubali .Its really a visual treat with the beauty of forest.  
Refreshing Monsoon ,"Nothing more to explain,a must watch spot in Thrissur. Every facilities are provided there by govt.Try to visit in monsoon to explore the beauty"
Athirapalli water falls,"We drove from Coimbatore to athirampilly today morning. The drive was beautiful. As we approached Kerala border, the greenery and the view of the mountain ranges welcomed us to god's own country. The driving along vadakachery stretch was slow due to heavy traffic. But so much of…"
Simply Outstanding creation of Nature,One of the widest Water falls in south India.  Must visit the place during the monsoon period in kerala
Athirampilly Waterfalls,"Athirapally Waterfalls, one of the most visited waterfalls in Kerala, Located on the way to Sholayar from Angamaly. "
Niagara Falls of South India,"Its a very attractive waterfalls mostly all times except summer. It have been the used as set for most films of Malayalam, Tamil, kanada, Telugu and even Bollywood."
Athirappally,This is a waterfall with very good scenic beauty. During Summer there is provision for sale bathing. One can enjoy Trekking and scenic beauty alongwith a good natural bathing. During Monsoon the fall will be so ferocious with its wild beauty.
Nature's gift,Good place to visit with family. I will come with my family and must stay here for a week to relax from my worldly worries.
Amazing Thrilling,We visited Attirapally Waterfalls yesterday afternoon on our way back from Malakkappara.  Beautiful waterfalls needless to say and entry price is very low.  However unlike in the past they are not allowing people to step into the lake side which might be safety reason.  We…
Amazing Venue,"Incredibly beautiful waterfalls with something for everyone. Many shallow pools for bathing, or a somewhat arduous walk down to the base of the falls if you want more solitude. Not easy finding parking as it's a highly sought out venue with lots of visitors. Entry tickets are…"
Beautiful Falls but ...,The actual waterfalls are beautiful and worth seeing. The path down to the falls and the climb back are quite ok for the young but taxing on senior citizens. On holidays and weekends the place is absolutely crowded and noisy. One cannot enjoy the forest or get any peace and…
Raw and Mighty,"Location: Mapped well to reach. Take your own car/cab for ease of moving about.  Ticket: Entry ticket needs to be purchased, carry change Food: Carry water with you and some light snacks Tips: To get to the bottom of the falls, there is a bit of trek needed, wear comfortable…"

Nice food on the way that you stop and have.  Beware of the wild monkeys, they will attack you if you have food in your…"
Beautiful waterfalls,"One of the most beautiful and unforgettable experience of my life. Unforgettable because of two reasons:1. Because of the lovely waterfalls. Never seen the nature so close and beautiful.2. Because of the tiring, energy draining, exhausting trek to reach the waterfalls and worse even come back. But once u reach there, u don't want to come back. Though the waterfalls were not filled with water at this time of the year but during monsoons, it is. With small kids, it's very difficult. No no for elderly. My mom couldn't even reach upto the point where the river was visible. The trek down to waterfalls is rocky and uneven. Wearing shoes is highly recommended. Please carry water with u because there is not a thing available inside. But once u reach the waterfalls, you forget everything.  The ticket charges are too low and not required as well since they are not providing any service and maintenance. I feel that they should ideally be providing a trolley service to reach there so that everyone can have the opportunity to see the waterfalls. It's not to be missed kind of an experience but many have to miss it because they can't reach there."
wonderful place,I have visited this waterfalls several times it is kind of awesome place to reclaim our energy... you can enjoy the pleasant forest...
A perfect holiday getaway!,A must visit tourist destination in Kerala. It is  located 1000 feet above sea level at the Chalakudy River and one of the largest water fall in Kerala. Recommended !
Just too beautiful,This is the best Waterfall of Kerala.  It is also known as Indian Nigara Fall.  Superb location and scenic surroundings.
Beauty of nature,"Awesome, wide and great waterfall of the region.  Must visit. Parking for vehicles is 1/2 Km away from the the site."
Awesome shooting location,"Athirappilly Waterfalls is located near Sholayar Forest Ranges, Thrissur, India.It is a famous shooting location.It appears in different movies."
Beautiful ,"Visited early morning and walked not only at the top but also down to the bottom of the falls. Very popular place with newly weds as they have their photos taken with the falls as a backdrop. Cost to enter was 100 rupees for foreigners and 30 rupees for locals. If you struggle to get up or down paths then I’d suggest not going down to the bottom of the falls. Although there are seats to rest along the way, in heat, with steep slopes and not a particularly good path, you will struggle. That said it’s worth the trip. Downside - the locals appear not to appreciate the area, as it is strewn with old clothes as they swim in the water and used nappies which brings the area down - shame as it is a beautiful natural tourist attraction."
Awsome and wide Fall ,We visited the fall in the month of December Few things about is fall areWater is very pure and natural coolHas very safe access parking available But aware about monkeys the can snatch each and every thing which is colourful like plastic bottles drinking water bottels and ladies purse etc.Nice to have bath under fall

Great experience ,Recently I spent some time in Athirapalli . It is amazing that the water falls flow . This is the place where the Filim !Bahubali part first shoot happened
Most beautiful waterfalls in India,"Last year, With my family, I visited this beautiful place and we availed family tour packages from one of the well-known travel agency in Kaloor named Gogeo Holidays. The place is a small heaven for nature lovers, bird watchers and adventure seekers.We got a chance to do trekking, hiking, mountain climbing, surfing, and camping. The place is home to a number of migratory birds which makes the place a literal heaven for bird watchers. A stay near the falls gives a marvellous moment in my life. We got beautiful memories and I would like to recommend you to take Gogeo Holidays which gives tranquil experience in your life."
Great must see place,"Enjoyed every second at this wonderful location. Brilliant atmosphere, brilliant scenery.So many people enjoying this special place."

Niagra of India ,Must visit place in Kerala those who love nature and it’s wild beauty.. athirappilly water falls is one of the best water fall I have ever seen.. the place is developed and GOVT. Check post and security feel give you secured feeling for a get away with family.
Awesome waterfall if you can manage the hike ,"There are 3 waterfalls at Athirapilly. At the top of the falls, there are calm ponds of water which many people bath in. There are no shower facilities. Locals warn us against bathing in pond as there are no alarm systems to warn bathers about release of water from the dam. We were told that people have been washed away when the dam is released. Even though locals said that water flow was low, it still presented a magnificent view. However, to reach the viewing area, you have to hike down a stony path which can be quite steep. At the bottom, there’s no viewing platform but boulders and stones which you have to climb on to get a good pic or good view. Not for the very young or old."
Tiring,"The view was nice but visiting in december is not a good idea. Since it’s dry season, the stream of the waterfall wasn’t big.Need to walk about 1km with rough steps and a lot of monkeys.End of the day, it is very tiring.Not a good idea to travel with kids."
So Big and good to visit,Awesome waterfalls and it was actually not there in our Travel plan. But our Driver forced us to visit this falls and it was really worth. Main advantage is one can see the beauty of this big falls from both top and bottom.
The free flowing falls from 80 feet height gonna make you feel crazy...,"The trail towards the falls is awesome..one can easily reach the upper view point..from where you van see the free fall of the Chalakudy River,but the main attraction is a stone paved trail towards the foothill of the falls, a but tiring, but when you reach the foothill of the falls and the water-mists make you wet , you can feel something special about it. ,"
Average,Tourism has picked up here which makes it a little crowded. Lots of vendors on the streets. Visit only as a checkpoint on your list
good to visit after monsoons,"a quck getaway from cochin , a short walk from the main road to see this amazing sight . do walk down to the base of the falls there is a slippery marked trail , best avoided by people not in shape . the view from there is fabulous & you get drenched . also take time to drive down further to cherpu falls bang on the main road"
Refreshing Place,The waterfall is as beautiful as Nigeria waterfall also known as Nigeria waterfall of Kerala. The view was truly amazing and thrilling. Is one of the best waterfall from India.Truly refreshing place to visit.
With My family,"After my explanation, my wife was interested to visit Athirappilly Waterfalls. So we set a drive from Calicut to Athirappilly. my wife and daughter enjoyed the Waterfalls and trucking as well as they can."
Worth all the Hype - truly India's Nigara,I have visited thrissur multiple times but never bothered to go to Athirappilly waterfalls. I got to know about this breathtaking falls from famous movie Bhubhali. This falls is approximately 60 kms from Cochin Airport... Off thirsur road. It is worth all the hype .. it is truly India's Nigara. Must visit tourist place in kerala.  Love this place
Awesome Nature,One of the most visited waterfall of Kerala.  The location and the climate was so nice and thrilling one. We can see the waterfall from top end as well as from bottom end.
Truly - India's Nigara Falls,Such a beautiful location.  Truly it is said that this waterfall is known as India's Nigara Falls.  One can see this waterfall from upper as well as from lower level.  It's nice & adventurous experience to walk down through sleepery hills and watch the water falls from height. …
Heavenly,I always loved this place. Its a marvellous creation by God. Best time to visit is during the monsoon.
Bahubali Falls!,It is said that the movie Bahubali was shot here and the you can visit the falls from both top most part and at the bottom most part as well. Excellent place and must see place.
Niagra of kerala,"Its an amazing waterfalls near Kochi and a must visit water falls . Its very Dangerous during rains , but very present to watch the milky waterfalls."
Spectacular and very scenic,Visited the Athirapilly waterfalls whilst travelling back from Guruvayur to Cochin / Kochi. Waterfalls are quite spectacular - especially from the bottom of the falls. The path down to the lower falls is quite strenuous (especially coming back up !) but the winding path feels…
Beautiful and reachable,You can Visit both Top and Bottom side of this falls.. 2-3 hours you can spend here plan rest plan accordingly.
Big and White,Waterfalls are very beautiful to see from far and upclose. Good part is it's run by government and entrance has tickets. This helps maintain the area around waterfalls. In rains it looks completely awesome.
Nice place to relax,"It's known as the Indian Niagara falls, good to go if you are in thrissur,we should be careful while walking through the water especially if you have kids along with you,the main water fall is quite an attraction there are nearby hotels as well.In my opinion we should not miss…"
Nice place,In spite of crowds had a wonderful time. Nature at its best .  A trip with family would be a pleasure.  
"Given by Nature, spoilt by Man !","This is one of the finest waterfalls in India among great greenary and palm oil trees, hills, rubber plantations etc. That's it. But spoilt by Man ( Indians) by throwing all sorts of garbage around, peeing anywhere giving urine smell on the way, bad infrastructure, bad hazardous…"
A must visit in Kerala,"It is natural gem, a beautiful ride towards the fall thorugh green surroundings. A luxurious treat to the eyes!"
Athirapally Falls- Pride of India! (In Monsoon),"If one is fascinated with Niagara falls, but Athirapally, during monsoon is no less than a Niagara! But beware that to experience the real feel, one needs to climb down a steep one kilometer path which takes you to the bed of the falls. It was a thrilling experience - to see the huge splash of water and the sprinkles of droplets raising as clouds all over. There are three rainbows formed just before us and it was mesmerizing. Beware of parking - during season, there would be so many vehicles and it would be diffuclt to park."
Athirapally water: one of the best waterfall in have seen,"Well this is one the spot you shouldn't miss while in keral. It's almost 70 km from main Kochi and takes almost two hours to reach from Kochi.I along with my friends travelled in big traveller. Well I 'll advise to take a private cab. I am not sure about the public transport.When you reach there, beware of the monkey's all around. They won't hesitate to jump on anything that you have which they feed upon. It advisable not to give any attention to them. Just keep walking with your belonging intact. While you take a walk for a while, you will find that there are two paths for the hi fall and each path leads to different side of the fall. Easy path is  simple one and will lead straight to the fall. You can see the catchment. You can the see the water falling from you level of your feet. You will observe the stream from the fall, making its way through the jungle and green jungle mountains and sky in the horizon. If the sky is cloudy, it would be mesmerising. I had one same view. In the catchment at back, you can find people bathing in fresh water. Well don't hesitate to join them. But beware of the flow of water and don't go in deep. While my friends had been in bathing, I rather chose to sit around, clicking pictures for them. Other way leads is kinda trail that will lead you to the foot of fall. Once you reach the foot of falls , just climb on the small rocks towards the fall(be very careful), and just feel the tiny droplets of water splashing against you. Trust me. Forget about your camera pictures and phone. Just forget for a while and sit and enjoy the fall. Well , the feeling when the splashed water droplets falls on you, is something I still carry with me today. And without that feeling , this trip would be vain. Ps: the trail is bit tiring especially when it comes to trekking back to upside but it's not something impossible. One must just do  it. And be cautious.All the best guys. Enjoy."
THE LOVELY NIAGRA OF KERALA,"Whenever I am Getting Time,I Will Visit Here.So Many Time I Enjoyed Here.Her(Athirappilly Water Falls) Lovely Falling,Oh My God,No Words For That.So Many Superhit Films Took Here,Great Movie Bahubali Also.I am Fond of "" Her ""."

WOW,just took a deviation to Athirapalli enroute to Coimbatore from Kochi and it was worth the visit. As flow of water was heavy I was not allowed to go near the water body.Nature was as its best and the view was just awesome.   I will strongly recommend the visit.
Great to watch!!!,Good to visit just after rainy season. Ticket cost is cheap compared to other tourist locations. Nice drive by car. But may not find good restaurants nearby. 
Nature at its best,The water fall is just breath taking.  You will have to hike down to see the water fall from bottom.  There are no steps it's little bit slippery. It's advisable to take spare clothes or raincoat as one will get wet from most due to the falling water. 
Magnificient,"Exceptionally beautiful and ofcourse bewildering. Visited long back.Visit the  falls after a period of good rains in Kerala. During Onam holidays, one should expect lot of crowd. There are resorts available around. vazhachal which is nearby is also is very beautiful. Both are…"

Nature's Gift - Athirapally Waterfalls,About two hours from Kochi (in between Kochi and Thrissur) is this beautiful waterfall.

Worth a visit,Awesome place to hang out except for the stone pathway down to get there.. visited this place last Monday and I would say it was indeed a good place to visit. Usually crowded on the weekends or public holidays but yeah waterfalls was just breath taking 
I heard bahubali sgooting was done here..visit in monsoon,"this is very beautiful waterfall and I took shower in the mist from the fall, saw many rainbows. It was mesmerizing to be there. Just looking at the fall with a force water drops from top to botton was very interesting"
Scenic waterfalls ,"An ideal place for a nature's retreat. The view from below the falls is breathtaking. The 360 degree view is awesome with the river course, forests and hills. "

Beautiful Falls,"This was my second visit to the falls with family. The water In the falls was around 40-50% of what I saw last time,maybe due to less rainfall,but still it was tremendous flow.all the three falls,Main Falls,Cherpa and Vazachal are worth to visit. Some new attraction has also…"
Awesome day trip from Kochi using local transport!,"My friend and I took 3 local buses to get to the waterfalls, starting from Fort Kochi. I'd highly recommend doing this.

Natural Bliss ..,"Athirappilly falls are around 80km from Ernakulum, out of which 30km road if from the local villages and jungle which is beautiful. This place is bit isolated but nature has really blessed this place. If you travel on weekends you will get a large crowd but on weekdays one can have peace there. On weekends car parking can be an issue due to small roads. There are two waterfalls nearby on the same river.  To get the actual view of main waterfall, one need to get down from the mountain for about 100 meters, walkway is already there. People are not allowed to enter inside the waterfall by local authorities due to past fatal accidents. For food, many small hotels are there where one can get a decent food to eat. Overall it’s a very good place to spend a day to relax."
The Niagara of India??,The beauty of this 80ft falls is captured in many movies. Athirappilly waterfalls and the nearby Vazhachal Falls along with the thick lush green forest area of the region is a major tourist attraction even during the Monsoon .One can reach the top of the waterfall through a paved path that goes through thick bamboo clusters. This is a no-plastic zone. A steep narrow path  leads to the bottom of the falls. The rocks are slippery there so its better to stand on the side and enjoy the panoramic view.
Amazing view,"We went in July and the waterfall was full of water. Top view was majestic but the front view totally blew our mind. We just stood there silently admiring the beauty of the waterfall. Water droplets were coming after hitting the rocks as if it is raining.To reach the top view of the waterfall, you need to go down ~400 m and another ~200 m for the front view, but it was all worth it. Don't forget to take umbrella if you are going down for the front view."
Fantastic falls!!!,We went to this temple in this Middle of the Month. The falls is very beautiful and the atmosphere is very pleasant.
"Grand and mesmerizing, truly its Gods own country!","I went to Athirapally falls in the month of January this year. While it was the end of winters, the falls were still pretty wide and wild. After reaching the Falls, we had to walk quite a lot downhill and none us were wearing walking shoes. So it was an arduous walk. My advise, please do take walking shoes which dont hurt your toes when you climb down.The view point opposite to the falls is rocky and there is a chance you may slip. Be very careful.Photograph the falls as much as you want. They are worth the effort down.There is a wire barricade at the viewpoint of falls. Many people cross this inspite of repeated warnings from the authorities there. Do not risk your life just for some silly selfies. Its not worth it.Suggested time of going to these falls is monsoons when they are in full glory."
Weekend at the falls ,"Athirappilly became famous with lot of movies were shot at the falls. You should visit the falls after the monsoon starts in Kerala. Mid July to August thru Sept, Oct is the best time as the water gush would be an awesome sight to watch. Also you can go further upstream and see…"

Amazed by the grandeur of this waterfall,"Not only is the waterfall beautiful, but the valley in which it is falling is amazing.

Waterfall in the midst of forest,"Naturally Beautiful wild waterfall. Famous for the location of the blockbuster movie bahubali. Located in the midst of jungle but easily accessible by road. (Chalakkudi- valparai rout) entrance fee is INR 20 or 30 per person (can't remember correctly) The top of the waterfall is walkable distance from main road. But to reach the bottom of the waterfall is a bit risky way. The authorities placed the board ""the breath taking view of the waterfall will take your breath away"". So be careful and do not enter in to the water. The walkway to the bottom of waterfall is too steep and slippery, which is not appropriate for people with heart disease."

Nice,The water fall view from the bottom is nice. The water scattered in the air as tiny droplets when passed through our body is very cool.

A lifetime Experience,"Awesome Waterfall, one of the best in India. I would suggest to have a rope-way for elderly people, as it is a tedious job to climb back up after getting the view of the waterfall, but it is worth a view."

Beautiful waterfalls,Location is good .Waterfalls is too beautiful and can also have spray bath at the down side of waterfalls .
Beautiful though not much water this time of year! ,Visited Athirapilly twice - once in April and the second time in October. The latter was far better! Due to the season in April there was hardly any water at all - just a little trickle. But in October it was amazing! It's clear why it's often referred to as the Niagara of India. There's also a lot of dragonflies which is nice!
Watching from the car!,"We drove by this place, but was too crowded to get down. We drove almost 2 KM to get a parking place, but only to return immediately. Lesson learned: Never travel to this on Sunday evening!"
a Wet experience,"Waterfalls are always a pleasure, its all the more fun if you can go under it and get wet all over and make some amazing memories! the force of the waterfall is not too much which makes this possible"
Stunning water falls,"What an experience. A must visit place, the nature en route as so refreshing. There are some hidden place where you can jump into and have a beautiful but challenging swim."

Waterfall s,"Great natural falls. Good for kids, family and any aged visitors. Not far from highways. Greenery and high , wild animals, good resorts.. What's else needed for a pleasure trip. Irrespective of language or country"
Magnificent view,Such a beautiful view. Was divine. But was a long walk to the bottom of the waterfall. Was worth all the effort. Just a kind note. Don't wear a saree and go hiking. 😊
The Niagra Falls of India,"We were based at Cherai beach and Athirappilly water falls was located nearly 2.5 hours from our resort, but the trip was worth it. I believe Bahubali shooting was done here. It is worth trekking at the base and experiencing the jet spray of the waterfall. We were completely drenched, so it is advisable to take a change of clothes along with you. brilliant experience."

Don't Miss Athirappilly in Monsoon,I went with my wife in July and it was such a marvellous experience. As it was monsoon season the waterfall was such a heavy and it was really atreat for my wife and me...
Chasing waterfalls,"A great day trip destination to visit, very lovely area to see waterfalls. When I went it wasn't too crowded and saw people swimming further up from the waterfalls  The place is well maintained and was great to be immersed in nature.   I would recommend having decent footwear…"
Adipoli vellachhattam!!,Visited the falls with my baby and she liked der very much. Please note there are many monkeys so keep the food and juices very safe. After January the water was on shallow level so V could enjoy well without much crowd. The drive was awesome.

Great water falls ,It's a very nice place and very neatly maintained.but it's too crowded you won't be able to completely enjoy the beauty because of that.better to plan your trip accordingly 
Magnificent and Magical:One of the best waterfalls in India-Niagara during rainy..,"Its one of the best waterfalls in India and during rainy season, several parallel streams offers a great scenic beauty and resembles Niagara.. It has a height of 80 feet and this is one of the most preferred spot for movie makers. The best to name is ""Bahubali"", apart from Dil…"
Great day out,"We had a great day out visiting these falls. Wear decent shoes for the hike down the stairs and over the rocks to the full view of the falls.  We also had a swim upstream with many others enjoying the beautiful spot.  Watch out for the monkeys on the walk in, they seemed to be…"
awesome waterfall,"a must visit place for nature lovers,I think there is another route to access this waterfall without trekking down and i dont know why the government has banned that route,any way nice experience to view the falls."
"Awesome experience, even in January when water is less otherwise","Good experience visiting Athirapally waterfalls. This takes some effort to come from parking but is easily doable. As it is steep down, going back is rather difficult. All depends on the fitness.  Also, you can't enter the water, and probably that's the thing due to which it is…"
Good place to vist,We were fortunate as there was water for the water fall However there is a long down hill walk to the viewing place Elderly persons with walking difficulty should avoid  Best visited at about 4 in the afternoon
great view from bottom,heavy water falls was on day which i visited. A must visit place for family to entertain their kids. Nice place to make some memorable selfies.
Very good waterfall,"Very good waterfall and specially in monsoon a lot of water is running. You can take good pictures over here but a lot of crowded place. The nearby market area is very good and selling quite a cheap products. You can get some handmade wooden items, umbrellas and also some nice…"
Beautiful scenery,"Went for a day trip to Athirappilly.  it was a great experience.  The crowd was too much but somehow there is still space for picture taking.  They close early at around 430PM.  All in all, it was great."
Beautiful waterfalls even during the dry season,"Beautiful waterfalls even during the dry season. The drive from the National Highway to Athirappilly is scenic and dotted with designer bungalows. Entry charge is per person. Charges for still and video cameras are applicable.Walk to the foot of the waterfall to see the grandeur. Walk is reasonably easy both ways and even children as young as 5 can make it. Take enough care while taking bath from the viewpoint at the top of the waterfall. There are manned security at the top and bottom of waterfalls. There is a rest area, toilet, drinks shop on the walk to the foot of the waterfalls.Beware of the many monkeys harassing for food/drinks. It is a very hot place with very high humidity. Ensure to stay hydrated at all times. One can easily spend a good 3-4 hours at this site."
I see why so many movies were shot here,"Athirapally is often called the Niagara falls of India. We visited in January, following a failed monsoon, so the water was scarce, but it still looked impressive. I see why so many movies were shot there. You'll need to get tickets at the office about half a kilometer from the entrance. You'll need to walk up the hill for 5-10 minutes to see the falls and for about a kilometer down if you want to get to the foot of the falls. There is a snack bar up there, but beware of the monkeys. Also, check the coffee shop near the gates for a scenic view."
Good falls with water,Waterfalls are good.Government charges money to view this as they are maintaining this waterfall park.Location goodTrecking heavy so only sport shoes shall help you to reach waterfalls from near view.Best season can be rainy season to watch more water.Bahubali shooting point.
Worth a visit,I visited as a day trip from Kochi and it was worth a visit.  The falls were not at their most impressive but the are was full of locals that all wanted their photo taken with the foreigners.
Vazhachal water falls,"This is a very good location situated about 35 Kms away from Thrissur, for a days out and spend time with family, the place is well maintained and clean. The falls are nothing less than various internationally acclaimed waterfalls. There is good out door place for activities, we even played cricket for some time , there is aboard displayed by the forest /touristdepartment mentioning  how many people died there so far and you should not be the next one. People who venture into its depths may meet such a fate but the place is generally safe. One local shopkeeper vtold me that he takes bath there daily, but those under the influence of intoxiucants meet with problems. But it is better to exercise caution"
"Pleasing for the eyes, but poor monsoons spoilt some of the fun for us","Athirappilly Waterfalls are worth visiting if there has been sufficient rains. Having seen pictures and videos of these Falls immediately after a good monsoon season, we were a bit underwhelmed during our own visit as it was during a rather dry spell. The Falls didn't seem as majestic or beautiful.  However, the climb down to see the Falls and the climb back up is a good physical excercise in itself for anyone who doesn't mind a bit of physical activity.  My suggestion: get a feel of how the rains have been in Trichur and the vicinity before heading to visit these Falls. If the region has enjoyed a good monsoon, it is a must visit; else, it could be given a miss."
Worth the long walk,I visited the falls in January . They are about 70km from Kochi and would take around 2 hours to reach. We went to see the bottom view. The walk is very steep and my parents managed to walk but still faced a few problems. If you can walk about 2km the walk is worth it . The falls are amazing. It's a must see.
Mesmerising,"I had been to this water falls on winter season. This water falls is really amazing. It is situated in a forest. But some localities suggested me that to visit this place on Rainy season. In rainy season time it will be full of water and more good. So I'm plannig to go again in July month..(""hopefully"")And aslo you can continue your journey through the forest and get Chapra, Vazhachal water falls, which not that far from this falls."
Couples,"For couples it's really fantastic place .. and value for money............Athirappilly Falls is situated in Athirappilly panchayath, Chalakudy Taluk in of Thrissur district, Kerala on the southwest coast of India."
Majestic Falls,Athirapally Falls is located 60kms from Thrissur. There are Govt buses from Chalakudy. But better to hire a Cab so that can visit nearby Attractions. Entry Ticket is 20Rs per person. And we need to walk a lot to reach the top of the Falls. We Visited in Dec so water was very scarce. People can get into Water in the Top of the falls but its risky. There were warning signs that Dam may open anytime. Changing rooms and Washrooms were available. We need to Descend 400m to see full view of the falls. It can be avoided by elderly people. It was a Breathtaking View. Try to visit before 10am since it gets too hot and humid in daytime.Do carry a pair of clothes if you are planning to get into water. This place has lot of monkeys they snatch any eatable u carry in hand so Beware.Small shops and Eatouts are available.
Mesmerising falls,Must visit during Kerala journey. Frequent busses are available from chalakudy municipal bus stand. can be reach in one hour.  nominal entrance fees before 500mts from entrance you can get ticket.  From entrance can go to the top of waterfalls by 5 minutes.  from top can go to bottom of water falls by steps can reach by 10 minutes.  worth visit just after rain season. Surrounding nature is also superb.  little bit difficult with kids and old age.
It is a beautiful place amidst lush greenery,"We went during off season, hence it had less water. We took a walk downhill to get a full view of the falls and it was very steep and long. It was truly worth the efforts, as we get a complete feel of the waterfall from beneath."
The water fall of Kerala,The best waterfall of Kerala is Athirappilly water falls. You should visit this place any day other than rainy days.
Not much water during Dec end,"Visited on Christmas day, water flow wasn't great and couldn't feel what we have seen as in Bahubali..spent time hopping around the rocks.."

its the place for family ,Athirapally water fall is neares to thrissur as per main location . it is amazing . pls check the season before u travel . because some time water is not suffient ...
Must see location - You will love it..,"Athirappilly Falls is situated in Athirappilly panchayath, Chalakudy Taluk in Thrissur district, Kerala. Athirapally Waterfalls are one of the best waterfalls in India. This waterfall drops from a height of 80 feet through several parallel streams offering a great scenic beauty. This is the biggest waterfalls in Kerala and well known for its scenic beauty.  About 10-15 minutes (may be more for older people) trek down from top of the falls will take you to bottom of the falls where the greatest beauty of the waterfalls can be experienced. Athirapally falls never dries out and can be visited anytime during the year. Though the waterfall appears in its full glory during monsoons, but heavy rains can cause great inconvenience, especially for treking down and then climb back. So, the best time to visit is from September to January. It usually takes 2-3 hours to explore Athirappally falls.Those who have more time can enjoy the beauty of the nature and the cool atmosphere. Lot of monkeys around which will be an attraction to Children. The entry ticket costs Rs.30 per person."
Visit during Monsoon,The ideal time to visit will be monsoon season.You can walk down through the forest to reach the bottom of waterfalls.
A Very Beautiful Place,One of the beautiful place in Kerala. A visit really worth. The waterfall is very refreshing to the mind and the most beautiful in India.
Wonderful place !!!,"A place where u should definitely go in south India, guys believe me it's an awesome place, u could go solo or with friends or as couples, u would definitely enjoy it "
The Best Waterfall in Kerala,"For better view it is best time to visit in the monsoon season. Full of greenery around, 80ft waterfall.  "
See you in Summers,Though we missed the fun to play beneath waterfall but still the view was impeccable. We will definitely plan our next visit in summers.
Excellent place to visit in summer,Excellent beautiful place to visit to enjoy summer vacation. Located at chalakkudi-sholayar-valpara route. a must see location
not so attractive,"Went to see waterfalls in december. Locals say that water has dried up over the years. Did not find much of water, there was a scenic small waterfall for pictures."
enjoyed it,"We went during november last week, falls is not dense and enjoyed bathing in the upper waterfall. Climbing down to lower waterfall is risky, elder people may avoid. We climbed down with my 5 year kid and bit exhausted."
gorgeous waterfalls,a gorgeous waterfall in the wild. a feast to the eye.a nice hangout place easily accessible for family and adventure  seekers.
Wow,The weather was nice and the waterfall is mind blowing with clean water flowing down at high speeds it's a memorable place and mesmerizing the nature at its best and its a must visit place.
A natural waterfall,This waterfall was a really nice place to visit. Even though you need to trek down a little bit through the reserve forest and the way down to the waterfall is pretty hard to go it was a nice place worth seeing. Those who would like to see the natural waterfall would love this and the sound of waterfall.
Not to be missed !,"Athirapally warerfalls is approx 60 kms from Kochi. After our tour of Munnar, Thekkady, Alleppey we visited Athirapally before taking our flight back home. The drive is lovely as you approach close to the falls as you are surrounded by forests. From the entrance to the falls the walk is quite strenuous so you may skip it if you have aged people along with you. It wasn't monsoon when we visited still the flow of water was huge which is much much more during monsoons. Beautiful falls, not to be missed during your Kerala trip :)"
Magnificent falls!!!,"Located 60 kms from Thrissur town, this is the most spectacular waterfalls in Kerala due to its height and width. A 15 min trek through the forest trail takes you to this stunning waterfall which is surrounded by dense vegetation and the Sholayar hills.  Overall, a must- visit place in Thrissur."
Tallest waterfall in south India,excellent view. Thick forests. Crowded and poor parking facility.Few eateries and more roadside vendors.
Must Visit,"Athirapally water falls is situated near the Tamilnadu Kerala border in the Kerala state .We went from Vaalpaarai through the forest of Kerala and reached Athirapally falls .The route itself is a journey to be remembered. It travels through the dense forest of Kerala and if you are lucky you will come across wild animals .Regarding the falls , it is a place not to be missed . You have to have stanina to visit the falls  because there is a lot of trekking to  e done . Once you reach the falls , the view itself is breathtaking and this falls has featured in a couple of movies like Baahubali, Raavan , and a song in a Tamil movie with Sarath and Namitha , Arjuna Arjuna song . We are not allowed to go near the falls as there is water current and it is barricaded . But you can click photo from a distance of 50 M but do not forget to carry some water to drink . A lot of walking has to be done . Once you have seen the waterfalls you have to walk again to the top And come to the other side where the water flows and you can bath there . The water is flowing and don't venture too deep . It is a must visit place in you visit Kerala . Thirussur is 60 KM from there . Coimbatore is 4 hours journey from there . While traveling from Vaalpaarai, you are not allowed through the forest Area from 6 PM till 6 AM as the roads are closed due to wild life . So plan accordingly .If some more facilities are done in this falls for the public , it will be a wonderful place .But don't miss it ."
beautiful place,"Do no miss this when you are around Trissur  & Guruvayoor. It is very beautiful nature.  one must visit this, if you have aged people or people cannot walk, then avoid going with them,"
Worth a visit ,Beautiful waterfalls approx 40km away from kochi airport. We spotted deers and many rare birds on our way to the falls. The infrastructure is not well developed and you need to trek for 30min to reach there. But the view is well worth the efforts!
