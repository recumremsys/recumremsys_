"""Amazing view""",Nice and Beautiful experience with Coaker's Walk. Coaker's Walk is one of the most popular attraction in Kodaikanal. A good place to have a relaxed and peaceful walk with family..It is also one of the main attraction in Kodaikanal. The entry is Rs 10 and camera fee is Rs 20 and Amazing place to see kodaikanal from the top.
Breathtakingly Beautiful Sight !,"Holidays in Kodaikanal are incomplete without a visit to the Coaker's Walk, a beautiful man-made one km long walking plaza built on the mountains in the mesmerizing city of Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu. The lovely path of Coakers Walk that curves by the edge of the gorgeous mountain have been constructed mainly for visitors to get a glimpse of Paradise on Earth. It is a preferred location for morning and evening walks to admire natures beauty.The Coakers Walk is named after by Lt Coaker, who constructed it on the steep slope of the mountains. in mid eighteenth century & is about half a km away from the Kodaikanal Lake. The pathway is fenced by the edge of the mountain for the safety of the visitors.It's a favorite location for activities like walking, cycling, sightseeing & photography. A walk here is a unique experience to capture the wonderful lush green valleys and the hills of Kodaikanal and make you feel like walking amongst the clouds.Breathtakingly beautiful sight indeed !"
Excellent mountain views while walking,The view of mountains while walking is mesmerizing. It feels like walking through the clouds.The place is beautiful and worth visit.
Enjoy a Scenic View of the Valley,"You need to walk some distance through the well-paved walkway. During Dec - Feb you can enjoy the mist. Also, a breathtaking view of the valley can also be enjoyed."
A walk to cherish,Coaker's walk is a must visit if you are in kodai. You will enjoy clicking off if you love sceneries with breath taking views on one side as you  walk. We were lucky as there was no mist and we could see the valleys clearly. Entry fee Rs.35 per person is a bit high.One entrance opens at 9am while the other  opens at 7:30 am.Loved the lemon tea we bought from street vendor in the walk.
A nice walk!!!,"Provides great views and makes for a pleasant walk. There are small shops who deal with handmade goods and articles. There is also a provision for an observatory, but, this was hardly of any use due to the poor visibility in December."
Coakers Walk,"The best place to visit in Kodaikanal, this place is close to the heavens and you can have a spectacular view of mist within the mountains."
A walk on the slope of the mountain,A 1km long man made walk on the slope of the mountain.  Take a walk around while getting mesmerized at  beautiful valley  & mountains.
A walk through clouds,We went on a weekend to Kodaikanal in February and decided to explore the area. The whole place was filled with clouds and we captured some really cool pics. We also had some hot tea to go with the weather.
Good View from Coakers Walk,Good View from Coakers Walk. Its a nice km long walking track. Can be done once during your stay in Kodai. Has an entry charge of Rs 30/person.
Great experience,"It’s an awesome place, just that you need to visit at the right time (during sunrise and sunset). A 15 minutes walk of this place would give you long lasting refreshments"
Unique Walking Track,I think this is a first for me to see such walking track combined with beautiful views on one side.  Cool weather with warm sun light on clear days makes it an amazing experience
Interesting and beautiful but pick your month,"This is a 1km walk alone a cliff overlooking Kodaikanal park and leading to the lake, after a further distance. The views are fabulous if the day is clear but the valley easily fills with mist in Jan-Feb. So go later in the day when the mist has lifted - say after 3pm. There are many small stalls selling souvenirs and artistic stuff, nibbles and some hot food.  The safety fence had collapsed in some places so be careful with your kids - bikes not allowed anyway. At the end of the Walk, it is possible to access downhill to Kodai Lake with all its amenities and the ornamental park. I imagine it gets very crowded May-Oct, but we walked with no difficulty.  A nice way to spend an hour or so."
Cant foget the visit,It's in the midle of the Kodaikanal. It is actually a walking place. You will find rhr valleys one side and beautiful flowers on the other side. There is a view point towers with telescopes too. Before going inside this coakers walk don't forget to buy carrots. So you will not miss the fresh tasty watery carrots in the walk. Overall its a great place for walking and enjoy the nature.
a cool place to walk around to view valley,The place was clean.Cool weather.. nice valley view. too much of fog and mist in the morning. View would be much more better at after 11am as been told by locals.
Coakers Walk Review,"Excellent view of the valley from this point. You need to walk a lot to enjoy. Initially I felt tired, but after the view, got the energy back. Best time will be the morning time visit as you will be able to view it property,I bet you will like the ice-cream in chill winter time as well, boiled corn etc.  Spend a quality time with your family and kid."
Nice view,It is really just view point and not hiking walk. Short path with view. I recommend to check the visibilty before heading to the coacker walk becuase in days of low visibility there's not much to see up there.
Nice place,Its a 1km walk and you will have a nice time and good view of the hills. The place is full of mist and we enjyed a ot
A walk with the clouds ,"Coakers Walk has the most beautiful views of the valley, mountains, clouds and greenery around. It's has a very scenic and photographic views. One must go in the morning for clear views and in the evening for the view of the city lights."
Serene,"very nice and calming , relax walk with excellent view especially on clear day, we were here at sunset time and it was like no crowd and very nice to have a walk in cool weather."
Wonderful views.,Hard to believe that you are in South India. Mist and fog all over. Very scenic and the best spot of Kodaikanal trip.
Good views,Excellant walk with lovely views you have be lucky when you visit as a clear sunny sky would help in viewing the valley

a good walk,"it's better than average, less than ""very good"".  but, a nice 10, 15 minute walk from La Saleth back towards town, with magnificient views (if the mist stays away) of the valley, far mountains."
Fantastic view,"Coakers walk is just close to the Kodaikanal city and bus station. It is a beautiful walking place. One can enjoy the valley on clear sky conditions. As it is in a walking distance from the city, one can take a stroll in this place. There is an entrance fee which is very low to…"
A surreal walk with a great view,"It is a pathway overlooking the valley with great views, when visited on a misty evening offers surreal experience while walking. It has two entrances and view points. A 30 mins - 45 mins leisurely walk to cover to and fro. Lots of shops selling eatables and woolen items along…"
Nice views from a clean walkway,"The Coakers walk is a nice respite from the chaotic and dirty city of kodaikanal. The walkway is quite clean, uncrowded and offers excellent views of the valley and hillside. When we visited, we saw the clouds floating in over the valley. It was surreal.   There are some shops…"
Great view of Kodaikanal from Coakers walk,One must visit this place if one is in Kodaikanal. On a sunny day one can have full view of Kodaikanal hill station. On a cloudy day also one can have great experience. Small road side shops great attraction for visiting tourists. 
Icon of Kodaikanal,"A very beautiful place to walk on. Road paved with bricks, protective grills on one side, and many small tents selling t-shirts, small snacks, wool etc. Maximum one hour. If weather is fine you can have distant views"
Awesome View of the Valley,One of the must visit destination in Kodaikanal. The walk has the best view of the valley and sky and most of the time you get the view of beautiful clouds in the sky as well as the fog. Highly recommended for an evening walk and beautiful for the photography. 
Stay with Oxygen in Coakers,A neat & clean as also beautiful walk in the big area with full of oxygen. There are lot of shops inside but very systematically. Also a very good place of pairs. Can enjoy the beautiful Kodaikanal either by walking or by sitting a place benchmark in the area. Bargain before buy…
Nice quaint walk along the hill side.,This is one of the most visited attractions in Kodaikanal. It is a 1 km stretch of road build on the hill with curves for tourists to get a glimpse of the valley. There is almost no slope / climb during the walk and you can enjoy the beauty of the place without any sweat. My…
Good viewpoint,Its a very good view point and the entrance fees is reasonable. Enjoy the walk and the pics :) it is at walkable distance from the kodai lake and the main center
Average,"Coakers  walk, beautiful place to walk with friends, but not so clean and beat for couples , just spend few minutes here and enjoy"
Awestruck view,Awesome place near Kodaikanal bustand you can go here and then also you can go for the Bryant park which is opposite to the coakers walk...! Awesome views from coakers walk. Must visit place
Very nice place ,"Its located near buststop it took hardly 5 min. By walk. It's a nice place were u can see green valley, villages in the valley, and of course u need bit of luck with respect to fog."
Good spot,"Very nice place, good scenary we can see falls, far place through telescope we have to buy tickets to get in"
Great view !,You can walk and see the clouds touching the hill peaks ! The view from here is beautiful. You can shop from the local vendors while you walk.
Just a footpath,A walk around kodaikanal lake can be done via this walk. Nothing fancy about it. Small flea market around for some shopping
Nice view from the top,This is nice view from the top.can nicely walk and see the kodaikanal view...most of the time mist is covered.side all small vendor available....
Awesome place to visit,Very nice and awesome place to visit in morning hours. Natural beauty is very nice. You feel like foggy weather during walk.
Breath taking view,We had visited Coakers walk just after a rain shower. The view was breathtaking !! However there are vendors along the entire stretch. Also the entrance and camera fee that they are charging is not worth. The place can use some maintenance. The washrooms were very dirty.
Felt like walking in between clouds,"I would recommend this is must visit place in kodaikanal view. Our driver dropped us one side gate and was waiting in the other side where we complete the walk. We all mesmerised by the scenic view through all our walk. We bought fresh carrots and that was our snack during our walk 😛One should try those baby carrots - they were fresh and juicy, even the kids liked it a lot."
Nice walk,Good view nice walk. Nice view of the valley. Nothing too exciting but good time pass at anytime of the day.
DO NOT MISS IT,"next to the CHURCH , opposit to Bryant""s park. find a safe place to park your car. walk from end to end . enjoy the view through telescope. beautiful nature all around . , God has given . Prayse Him .  wish you a safe , pleasant, comfortable  stay at Kodai"
Walk ,Beautiful Walk if done early Morning Or late evening .. One condition that sky should be clear to enjoy the view 
Nice view,This place gives the view of the city surrounded with mountains covered with clouds. You have to buy a ticket  for entry. It is nearly a 2km stretch where while walking under the open sky you can enjoy the view.
1.5km walk on top of valley,We can see valley View with walk around 1.5 km.. If you in the evening can see mist. It will open around morning 7 and evening till 7 pm
Walking around the valley,"It is must see place in kodaikanal,actually you can see the total valley arround the mountain, while walking, a very beautiful place for evening or morning walk"
Nice view from here,"Well..the place is slightly commercialized with some shops inside the premises, otherwise the walk through here offers a great view of the valley. Its not a very big walk."
Beautiful walk in Sky in Clouds,This 1 km walk through sky is meant to be experienced. On a clear day beautiful view of Kodai valleys on cloudy day with some rain heaven when clouds almost pass you by. One of the best attractions in main city. See the gentle rolling hills. I was lucky to see a green snake in…
Best tourist place in Kodaikanal,"It is a paved winding pathway on the side of the hill, which gives a bird's eye view of the village below. The pathway is quiet wide and outer edge is protected by railings. There are benches provided along the walk for short rest. Along the walk, there are vendors, selling…"
Very good view,This is a very nice place to walk in the early morning hours. You can see almost every place around it from this view. There is a telescope machine as well but beware they charge a lot and you may end up spending a lot of money for just a 5 second view of a place you may have…
Nice place,One of the touristy spots of Kodaikanal. You'll get nice views along this mini walk and have a cup of tea.
The route of an Englishman to walk,"Croaker’s walk is the walk path routinely treaded by an Englishman, it goes around the lake and Bryant Park. Long winding route which was a small path, now Stone paves for 3-5 people to walk as a small group. No vehicles allowed and small shops along the long winding walk cater…"
Scenic walk,"A great scenic walk right in centre of Kodaikanal. No vehicles are allowed here. Entry and exit points are different. It offers scenic views. There are small vendors on the path, you can get food items and do street shopping. The entry ticket is ₹ 35. Telescopes are there giving great views. But go only on bright and clear , sunny day to enjoy the views."
Best walk ever ,"The entrance charge is RS. 35 per person , since it was opposite to our resort we went for an early morning walk. This opens at 6 30 am and closes at 6 pmBeautiful view of mountains and city..must visit"
Good,Very nice & Peaceful place...Very pleasant place...Feelings of fresh air...We can enjoy lot there with friends & family...
"An evening In Coakers walk, a walk to remember","Relaxing,beautiful, no chaos, serene, lovely, do yoga, play your sport, relieve your stress, enjoy to the fullest, calm and quite, great for family,friends,couple, please ensure to keep this beauty beautiful, mess free, clean and tidy"
Breath taking view from Croaker walk,Its a less than a km walk with good walking track and boundary. You can get a full ground view from top of the hill from this point. Its a nice point to take some amazing photo. Most of the time it is surrounded by cloud which adds beauty to this place.
Walk With Splendid Views,We visited this just before leaving Kodaikanal. Surprisingly there was very less crowd so we walked quite peacefully enjoying the view and munching onto some snacks. The Coakers Walk overlooks the foothills so you can get good views of small hills and the plains with the mist working on its magic. Also there is a small observatory which has a telescope which would give you good views of the town for just Rs 10....I think it might be a good option for your kids. Also try to go there early morning or towards the evening to enjoy the views to the fullest.
Panoramic views......,"Close to the Kodai Bus Stand and few meters away from Kodai Lake and Bryant Park, is this heavenly walkway named after Lt. Coaker, way back in 1872. It is fantastic 1km (3300 feet) well paved and fenced pedestrian pathway (entry paid, 10 rupees per person and 20 rupees for camera) that provides awesome panoramic views of the Kodai town. Edged on a deep slope it is a photographer must visit destination which provides mesmerizing play of clouds floating around and giving a unique landscape below. On a clear day, you can view as far as the town of Periyakulam and even the city of Madurai. As the mist gets deposited, a pre noon visit is recommended however, on a clear day any time is fantastic for its very soothing and spectacular view."
Walking in the pathway by the side of valleys was awesome,It was an awesome experience as it was a nice walk for a kilometre or two. And at the same time we enjoyed the beautiful Kodaikanal valleys while walking. It was an amazing experience. There is a govt paid binoculars are also available to view the valley more clear. So enjoy the beauty with your loved ones.
Good walk,"Good to visit once. Went during the day so missed the mist. Best to visit early mornings. It looked like a wonderful place when I visited in my childhood with parents, now looks like an ordinary place. ."
Early mornings or just after sunset,A good walk early in the morning or right after sunset. The view is really good but do it only during good weather. We did it around 7 pm when the place was almost empty but still liked it. I am sure it would be a good place for sunrise view!
Nice walk with views,Is a nice place to relax and drink a cup of coffee while you see the amazing views of the mountain. very beautiful to see
Just a short walkway around a hillside,"Good to spend about an hour or so. Opposite the ""botanical garden"". Gives you a good view to the valley. When we went there, the clouds were just rolling in so it was amazing. There's a small observation room where you can view through telescopes. It gets over very soon though and you need to purchase tickets to enter."
Must visit ,Any day best view in town. Mist or cloudy it is a very nice place to visit for a walk with a view of valley
Must see place! ,It’s an amazing 0.5 Km walk with Spectacular view. It’s just a hill top view with multiple points (difficult to figure out though)!
hill view,nice corridor to walk seeing the valley below. kept clean . must see to have a good look from the top. there are vendors on the side walk offering several things.
Coaker's walk,"They charge atrociously for the persons and for the cell phone carried. You can look down at the valley , but nothing great . It's a waste of time and money"
Nice views. Good place to relax,This is a nice place to take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the heart of kodaikanal in walk-able distance to lake and bryant park. Mesmerizing sky and views. Beautiful clouds before the sunset. You also should go there in the night to see the view of lights in the city. Its amazing. We went twice once in the evening and once in the night. We missed to go for a morning walk to the same place :)
Very nice scenic views. Must visit,Very nice along the edge of valley. Very scenic views. Must visit. Very quite and peaceful. Lots of shopping options and eateries throughout the walk. Kids also enjoy the views and mist in the valley
Nice morning walk,"Beautiful place for morning walk, close proximity to the lake and small time shops, get down from the walk and one can try the street side breakfast"
Good place for an hour ,Good place for an evening. Too crowded. Too many hawkers. Beware of fake products. Good bargaining skills required......
Beautiful walk,"Stunning walk, views are magic in fact will be imprinted in your mind forever. Small payment and worth it. Not a difficult walk at all."
For a great walk,"Nice place, good for a walk, scenic. A little crowded - of course Kodai is very crowded however you will get your privacy somehow."
When we visited there was no great view,Usually clouds pass by and embrace the tourists.  This was not the case when we visited on June 1st.  Probably this time it was very hot climate in Kodai.  One should visit in August to have full fun of kodaikanal.
Vacation at Kodai,Go there early in the morning and you will have breath taking view of the valley and different flowers. Crowded after 9 am
Walkers paradise,Great place to go for a walk. Will be great to have such a place inside my Apartment ;-).Scenic beauty to see on 1 side while walking with cool breeze wiping off your sweat and making u fresh again.Theres small scale vendors selling some local ornaments.
Prashant,"Most overrated because of hawkers selling there wares,would have loved if they were not there,otherwise the views are fantastic,some cleanliness would have for wonders"
Enjoyed the walk!!!,It is very pleasant to spend time walking on Coaker's walk . Most of the famous view points can also been seen while walking .
awsome photo locations,the best place to shoot portraits and pictures with familyalso best place to take a small jogs when you feel like being fit!
Disappointed with place,Place is neat and clean which promises to give you valley view from top but to my sheer disappointment the view which we saw was not at all worth. Weather was also not cold. There is one glass house in middle of coakers walk which  is having telescope which gives you opportunity to see 108 year old church from top at Rs 10. Entry free to coakers walk is Rs 30. Lot of local shops makes this place a bit crowded.
Opt place for calm walk and watching the long valley,"Start from one end and have a walk till the other. You can enjoy a great view of the kodaikanal city, valley and the towns at the downhill"
Beautiful and over-commericialised,"the online pictures make it look like a quiet nature's abode. It is indeed, except that its not quiet. The whole walk is full of vendors and a huge tourist crowd in summer."
Decent but slightly commercial.,"Go here but don't make this your choice destination. If you are lucky and the fog and mist is less, you will get a good view."
A relaxing walk,The Coakers walk gives a good view of valley. It is a short walk of about ten minutes. It is good to be there in the morning
Best place I found in entire trip,Lovely views Not soooo crowded Very well maintained They should reduce number of hawkers to a specific zone as it adds to garbage
Good walk with good View,Definitely a miss not spot in Kodai. One could take a nice stroll with family and friends enjoying the fine view and the kind breeze.
coaker's walk,Nice little walk. Be sure to check out the views from the binoculars else you might end up getting from the second gate. We reached here in the morning when there were hardly any visitors. Even the stalls were just being set up so I guess it might be getting more crowded during…
Coaker's walk. Nice walk,It's nicely maintained place. Beautiful scenic view points are in between. Entry tickets are required. Clean washrooms are at one end. No vehicles are there so peaceful place.
Good views..,Good views from coakers walk. Little bit foggy. One view point is there which was closed due to foggy weather.
A walk worth your time,"This is one of the good places to go in Kodai. You can eat, sit, relax, enjoy the beauty of nature and what not. The entry ticket is little costly like Rs 90 for a couple + camera, but otherwise its worth."
Good for early mornings,Nice walk preferably before 7am. Calm. Pristine. Good for couples to just take a romantic stroll with views of the valley. Walkable distance from the lake.
Amazing pathway in the clouds,"Coakers Walk is approx a km long  walking pathway overlooking city and valley view in the city of Kodaikanal.  Approx 500 m from Kodai lake ,it is a preferred location for the a romantic/evening /early morning walk . One can have the pleasure of viewing valleys and range of mountains with cloud cover especially in the evenings. Opp famous Bryant park,this pathway has small stalls selling boiled groundnut and roasted corn. You can also have a view of fogs and water falls from here from telescope viewing point priced additionally for Rs10/-.A person can be at leisure to enjoy this serene location."
walking with the clouds,"one of the must place to visit in kodaikanal.you can walk freely and enjoy the beauty of the nature..in the evening because of the fog you can have a feeling like walking with the clouds..if you want to enjoy the sceneries go before fog comes.there is a telescope in the middle of the walk..lot of spots are there for taking photos..at the  end of walk you can see a cake and choclate shop,cake from the shop was realy tasty.."
"Good, but then, its the crowd","Decent walk... nice view, terrible rush... go late and stay till closure to get some peace and calm... avoid peak tourist time..."
Good place to walk and relax,"Enjoyed here, Good view on the mountains, located center in kodaikanal, eatables allowed and snacks/fruits available inside. Kids will enjoy the walk and play in the pathways."
Great and beautiful view from Coaker walk,"We stayed in Kodai resort and Coakers walk is less than 5 min. walk from there. To go early morning, it opens at 7.30 am so if you reach there this time then it is best time to see the look at the view. Total time can be spent is max. 1 hour, clean and well maintained. Can take great pictures from there. Must visit place in Kodaikanal."
Surreal view,Amazing weather and one of the best picturesque points. A must visit place for some nice clicks and a walk amongst the clouds
Best view point in Kodaikanal,"This place is quite near by to kodai market..nice walk around the valley..like the views of kodai from here, scenic and beautiful photo shoot location..one must visit in the morning for clear views. Better sight seeing then other view points in kodai. Nearest attractions are…"
Pleasant Walk on Coakers Walk,Coakers Walk is a one-kilometre-long walking plaza in the city of Kodaikanal.  It is a preferred location for the Tourists for morning and evening walks. We can have the pleasure of viewing valleys and range of mountains from this Walk Path. You can also have a bicycle ride on…
Beautiful views of the Greenery,This is a walkplace from where you can see the beautiful views of the western ghats. One of the best places recommend for photography.
Must visit ,This place is ideal to see the entire Valley and range of mountains. It's too foggy in the morning in spite of summer Sunday. It's a one km stretch you can walk and take lot of photos. The view from the place is just outstanding. 
PLEASENT STAY,Amazing property with easy check in & check out. Food was excellent & spread was very good. Rooms & bathroom was clean. Activity area was great with vadivelu being a extraordinary host entertaining children & adults to the best. We had breakfast & dinner buffet package costing…
Family visit,This is a nice place to walk around with beautiful view of surrounding hills and valleys. an enjoyable visit
walking on the clouds,Want to walk on the clouds and experience it all around you then this is the apt place for it I would say. 
It was a fantastic walk,We went to coakers walk in the morning and it was for a half kilometer walk. On the way you will enjoy seeing valleys and landscapes and small small houses. It is opened at 7:30 am. There is a telescope 🔭 tower also. You can take ticket for this and see the valley and houses…
decent walk enjoying the city view,"we really enjoyed this place, as the climate is cool, less congestion, varieties of activities like Binoculors, Shooting, shopping etc along roadside will  keep you busy. "
Had a good view ,Entrance fee was reasonable. Had a good view . Had a good view from telescope . It’s very old view point . We all had a good time . There shops inside . Toilets is also there.
Croakers walk,"Walk and view on croakers walk was good and scenik...but wish they could open it early morning...they open only at 7,30.. I would hane enyoed the walk viewing the sun rise"
Coakers Walk - Nice experience,It was nice experience walking on Coakers walk.We can see the valley properly and enjoy natural beauty.
Kodaikanal - A place where you should walk :),"We visited Kodai in mid April. This is the season to visit Kodai is what they say, though i would heavily disagree. So after a lot of digging of websites i finalized on the best places to see in our 2 day trip, but not all were true to their charm.Time needed - 2 Days . Travel - We took overnight bus from chennai. But you can take a train  to kodai city and then take a bus/car/bike to KodaikanalGood to have - A vehicle(Bike/Car). Taxis have their monopoly here. 1 KM travel starts from 150 INRBike for Rent - No. There is a strict ban on it, so you will get it in the Kodai city, but you will need to drive up to the Kodai hill station( 80 KM). Hotel - We stayed in Altuis Nest, its a decent stay, but we overpaid since we booked at last moment. If you get early booking, try for Greens Youth Hostel (Please note - this is only hearsay - Not promoting either)Attractions:1. Coakers Walk - Its a very nice walking arena. Peaceful and neat. The views from here are really good. You can just walk/sit around and relax. Entry Fee- 20 Rs. And honestly Kodai is only  about its mountain landscaping.2. Vattakanal falls/ Bear Shola falls, are supposedly famous waterfalls, but they are dried up and are very dirty to add to. The local tour guide said, its only in rainy when these falls have water, else they are mostly dry.3. Bryant Park - Entry Fee - 30. Its a huge park with a variety of plants, trees, succulents, flowers, but not a very big attraction for the price being charged.4. Lake - The lake is the first attraction you will see which is free to watch but boating is chargeable. They are flea markets around it, so its definitely worth to take a walk around and you even get bicycles for rent to ride around it.5. Dolphin's Nose - The longest downhill and uphill walk so far for me has been my journey to Dolphin's nose. I am not a very jumpy trekker but if you want to go here, you have to trek. There are no roads, steps but just a bunch of stones, pebbles unevenly scattered. Its worth going since the view is really good, but yet again i would not advise if you are not used to walking a lot.Specific Dos - Please carry a thin jacket or sweater, since it is cold in mornings and evenings. Do try as much walking as possible and save up on the Taxi fares. Carry kets, shoes if you plan to see these places around.Specific Don'ts- Do not sign up for these day packages by cars as they are the fastest way to scam you. They are charge from anywhere between 1200 to 2500 for showing you to 10-12 places, but all the places are in vicinity and half the places are not worth seeing. Kodai is beautiful for its pleasant weather, view points, and i would like to inspire you all to walk. If you are travelling with parents, then please take cabs around but choose places you want the driver to take, they will accommodate.Places to eat - Astoria Veg (Meals are very yummy),  A momo places near the Tibetian shops around the lake, Hilton Cafe.Shopping -  I found the street markets to be expensive and the shop keepers not very keen on bargaining since that's possibly their only source of income and they are able to sell it at high prices. Places i wish i could see - Pine forests."
Ok ok place,It’s an ok ok place . Has nothing to do much . Views are not so clear . We spent only 10 min there .
Just for a walk way about 5 .M long .,Rs20 entry fee is too high. Properly paved walkway. There is good view of the valley. There are benches where you can sit and enjoy the view
Beautiful,"I went to Coakers Walk. The Coakers Walk was constructed in 1872, by Lieutenant Coaker. It is about half a kilometre away from the Kodaikanal Lake and is constructed on the steep slope of the mountains. It is great place to go."
Family trip,Fantastic walk way. Tamilnadu Govt has taken all the initiative to keep this place neat and clean. Friendly locals and nice street food.
Must visit place.,One of the best places to get the city and Hills view. Nice Half a km walk with benches On the way   to sit and relax.
Wonderful view,You can get a view of Kodaikanal from here. The place has however become commercial with stalls along the way. Losing its charm
Money loot....,"this wqas one good attraction earl;ier, but now pure money loot..  added some space for shopkeepers ... now view through telescope is again charged, and one nonsense sitting in between also with telescope and charging for telescope viewing, trhat too of spot which he decides..…"
Nice walk-way,Clean walking path with nice view. Lot of small shops in the path. Enjoyed brief walk in the area with good valley view
Lovely Views,Don't like doing this kind of tourist stuff but it's a lovely view and realistically it's only 50p per person.
Nice place,This is one of the best places in Kodaikanal to enjoy with family. Safe area for children also. Enjoyable weather. Good barricading in almost all areas.
Great Views and Walk,This place has some really great views of the mountains and the valley! If clear sky you will be able to have a very long clear view of the valley. Morning and Evening walks are preferable not during Mid Day 
A breeze walk enjoying the nature at Coalkers Walk,This is a must see place when you're in Kodaikanal. Get indulge in the great view and atmosphere in this Hill Station.
coakers walk review,Very good for morning walk. secure. Meant for walking only. In the heart of the town. Feel very refreshed while walking on this walking stretch in Air conditioned atmosphere.  You can a good view of kodai also from this walking stretch.
Nice walk with a view,This place is good for a lovely walk either with your partner or friends. We have a nice view of valleys and mountains. Unfortunately for me when we went it was very misty and beacuase of fog we were not able to get much of a view. There are few shops selling trinkets and eatables on the way. Its worth going once.
One of the best attractions in Kodaikanal. ,This is one of the best place to be when you are in kodaikanal. The view from here is just awesome. One of the best views in kodaikanal. It is just a walkway of around 2kms with great views. Couples can enjoy a romantic walk here. Kids can play around and have fun.
Awesome experience! Must visit,Awesome experience! Must visit. You can see the whole valley from this high viewpoint. Perfect for panoramic shots.
Nice and small walk,We went there in the morning. It was a nice small walk. We in fact were lucky to have seen the clouds in the valley. There is a telescopic view point and in my view that's a waste.
Very nice place to spent 30 minutes of time,The inside hawkers may irritate you. Too much overcrowded. NICE VIEW. They could make the  ticket price a bit les.. but overall a must visit place to go 
A walk to remember,Beautiful view from the top as you keep walking  you can see the scenic view of kodai and in February we found fog everywhere and it made the place more romantic
Foggy walk,"If your hotel in town itself, you can just walk by and visit. Super chill and super view. Should not miss to spend at least 1 hour there :)"
Relaxing,Also very relaxing thing to do in addition to walking around the lake which is not far from each other... It is a bit of an uphill stretch but hey we are surrounded by mountains so it is expected... It's a nice long walk way with stalls and top down view of the town and valley…
Walking around Coakers walk,Enjoyed our slow walk around Coakers walk.  Air was simply fresh with beautiful sceneries. Shopping was very reasonable.
Refreshing experience in Coakers walk,"It will take roughly 30 - 45 mins to cover the Coakers walk stretch. The view of the mountains around,the serpentine roads crossing through the mountains  is really a scene to behold. Overall an enjoyable walk with good sight scene"
A misty walk,The Walk is not very long. The view we missed because of the fog but on a clear day you should be able to take in the breathtaking scenery.
Coakers Walk,Envision having a tranquil stroll through the mists and looking at the magnificence of the slopes surrounding you!
"Noisy, overpriced","Felt like a shoddy town from up above. Too many settlements, dirty outlook. Needs better care. Weirdly enough, doesn't seem like a hill station with lack of greenery"
Scenic place,This place we have to go in early morning.walk in this place refresh us a lot since side view of huge mountains are breathtaking
A serene and beautiful stretch of hillside walk (only if you escape the crowded days/time),A well maintained stretch of walkway created on the mountain side giving a beautiful view of the valley. I was there with my family and friends and it was nice peaceful place. It was peak winter so the view wasn't that great but the mist and fog was awesome. There are vendors in…
"Mesmerizing Coaker's Walk, ( Pathway)","Coaker's Walk, this located about 1 to 2 kms from Kodai Lake. It is a picture perfect  location.

Vanakkam Kodaikanal Coaker's Walk,"Perfect for a hour stroll with a mesmerizing view above valley and clouds.

Super Scenic!,"Croakers walk is a man-made walkway built on the mountains, offering some super scenic views of the valley. We enjoyed our short walk despite the weather being misty on that day.  A must visit an attraction, an added bonus if it's not misty. It costs about Rs 20 to enter the…"
An average kilometer long walk providing valley views,"It starts near Van Allen hospital and is approximately 1 Km long. If mist is not there, one can have a good of view valley. There is a telescope house here for watching certain scenic spots. Coakers walk as well as Telescope has charges."
First class,For 20 rupees you get a wonderful panoramic view of the Blue Mountains and surrounding countryside. Well maintained path  about 200 metres in length. Few stalls. No hassle.
Ggood valley view,"Coakers Walk is a beautiful  one-kilometre-long man-made walking area built on the mountains in Kodaikanal from where we can have a good view of Kodai valley.It is a good location for morning and evening walks. For visitors safety, the pathway is fenced by the edge of the mountain. It's a favourite location for sightseeing and photography .There is a telescope house to explore the surrounding there. Also few souvenier shops on way. If you wish to breathe clean fresh air and experience to the lush greenery, enjoy a leisure walk on this walkway."
Good place but gets crowded,"Good place but gets crowded, go early to enjoy the serenity. As the day progress the crowd gathers and its impossible to enjoy."
Lovely walking,Our family with two kids had a good time in this place with good view and mist. Kids enjoyed a lot in Coakers Walk.
Nice walk early morning,This is really a good walk offering good view of the hills. We went here early morning and everything was misty. Along the walk there are people selling small items. Due to mist we couldn't see things which were far clearly. On one end of the walk you have telescope. We looked through the telescope but couldn't see much due to mist. So on a misty day it's better to avoid the telescope.
Offers good views,"Offers a good view of the town below and distant hills. Mist added a veil to our view. But nothing remarkable. If it is mist-free, you should try using the pay-to-use telescopes."
A nice walk with valley view ,"As you walk this stretch, you can view the valley and town on one side. On the other side, there are shops where you can buy fresh carrots, hot groundnuts and also buy souvenirs."
Awesome view,Felt like walking amidst the clouds and enjoyed beautiful scenery. Shops are also very good. Enjoyed very much.
Very nice place to spend.,Beautiful place to walk alone or with our sweetheart. The beauty of nature is like an artist's canvas.
Not much of a walk,A very short path with wonderful mountain/valley view if not shrouded in mist. Lots of trinket stalls along the Walk.
Good walkway of 7-8 minutes but dont understand why they should charge 70 rupees,a nice good walkway but it was very misty on 24.12.2018 and thus unable to see view far below. There are many hawkers with shops which becomes annoying.
A stroll with breathtaking view,"As you walk you satiate your eyes with valley view and clouds floating ...30/- fees per person , ticket for 3+ yrs person"
Great view,The walk is a must do when you are in kodaikonal. Excellent view of kodai over beautiful mist. Couldnot have asked for more.
Nice walking trail,"Nice walking trail with scenic beauty, small shops along the walking track create nuisance.  Entry fee can be avoided."
Good park,Lxcalities and tourists should be proud of such greenery with walking space. Also we can see kurinji flower which blooms 1 time every 12 yrs.
A good point to view the Kodak skyline.,Although the place is the best point to view the scenery and skyline of Kodaikanal we missed due to the heavy overcast of clouds which may be frequent during winter.
"Amazing visit point, view point is mind refreshing","Take pictures and pictures and pictures along with the walk trail , amazing point in Kodailkanal, Must visit, enjoy eating Bhel on the way, we cherised the same !!!!"
Consultant ,Good views of mountains and valleys.Need to purchase entery ticket for camera as well.Not ideal for elderly people because walking there is strain.
Hill Side Walk,"Coakers Walk is around a half a km walk on the cliff.Fenceing is there for protection.Small vendors sell local fruits,cloths etc.There is a entry ticket.Do not go there in the afternoon.Best time would be evening.It is just a place to see valley any have pleasure of chilly winds."
Beautiful place for morning walks,Beautiful place for morning walks with cool breeze. Views are breathtaking. Hide and seek of clouds made it interesting.
Good for a late afternoon stroll,The place offers fantastic view of the valley and if you stay till perhaps you should experience the jewel box view of the town far away. 
Beautiful place,"It is one of the beautiful place in kodai. Bt taking a tickect which cost Rs 15- 20  you can enter the coakers walk. There is nothing else to do, just walk. Its almost 1, 1.5kms. It will be a good experience. You can see the whole kodai from there. It is very near to the kodai…"
Excellent view of the Valley,Early morning or late evening visit would be ideal for Clicks. The entry fee per person is Rs. 20/- Additional fees would be collected for Cameras.

Good place to take a walk,"This place is clean, good place to take photographs, you have some activities to do, the place has monkeys who are looking for a free meal, Fruits like passion fruit are available here, Child friendly place, senior citizens can sit and relax at different points."
Walk on the Mountain,"The entry ticket is priced at 35 INR. It is a narrow but paved pedestrian path that was constructed by Lt Croaker in the year 1872. The path offers scintillating views of the valleys and in rarest occasions can also give a glimpse of the rainbow cutting across the clouds. The path is one kilometre long and has market lined at the side. Items sold are very expensive and thus, it is advisable to either bargain or buy from the market near the lake."
Nice experience ,Coakers walk is a 15 minute walk which can give you a chance to experience the Kodaikanal weather and the beautiful views. One can see different varieties of birds at this walkway. The squirrels and monkeys will be running around. One need to pay 20/- for entry and an another 30 for mobile camera. Parking is a real problem at this place.
View of kodai from coaker,"Need to walk for while approximate 1.5km/half an hour walk in the walker path.You can view a nice scenery from there,and you found small side shops for purchasing and snacks."
Amazing View,"Coakers Walk is neat and very well maintained path way. With a very nominal entry fee (20/-) you get to see a breath taking view of mountain chains with clouds rolling over them. This place is very well within the city, walk-able from Bus Stand. If you are a nature lover, you will surely enjoy walking on this lane. Vehicles are not allowed here. there are some vendors selling petty things and eatables. Do visit the Telescope center at the end of this pathway (fee 6/- per person)."
It is just a an ordinary spot nothing special. But we could see some Neelakurinji flowers.,A tourist spot created just to attract outside tourists. Not worth visiting it. Staff behavior is unfriendly. Those who never visited any high altitude area can only find so e interest here.
Beautiful,A beautiful facility wherein the civic society is not paying attention towards cleanliness discipline.
Must visit place in Kodaikanal,You can have a 30 or 45 mints fine walk there with fantastic view especially in morning and late evenings. timings are from 7:30 am to 7:30 pm.
Walk through the clouds,"It was very overcast on the day we went so couldn't see anything except the clouds. But on a clear day, it would be a good place to visit. But it was nice to walk through the clouds and feel the droplets on the skin."
Clean beautiful place to walk with loved once,"Clean Place, Nice View, Photography must to do, if u are lucky that u are available with your loved once u will sure enjoy the time here just sit and relax :) best time to see is morning or evening or in case whole day cloudy"
Amazing Valley View,Don't miss taking a pleasant walk witnessing the panoramic view of Kodaikanal Town. The breathtaking valley view is something you can't get over it. The Sunset time is more crowded. It closes by 6.45 PM and the entry fee per person is 20 bucks.This place is just a 10 minutes walk from the bus stand as well as from the Kodai lake.
Coakers walk,Nice walk on the high ground around the hill with xcellent view points of the town and neighboring villages and town. Lot of whops on the way selling variety of local hand made items at bargain prices.
Enjoy 1hr of great walk,This place is near to kodai lake. One can enjoy a 1 hr of nature's walk here. Ticket for 2 adults along with mobile phone is 70 rupees.
manmade place to see heaven,Its the best attraction of Kodaikanal. The manmade walkway gives you a glimpse of the valley and the clouds.
A walk to remember,"Went here during sunset and God is this place beautiful! The veiw from here is breathtaking. The clouds would take over the whole way and once it gets cleared the whole city looks divine! As it starts getting darker , the lights looks prettier. However, this place does get closed after 7pm. So the ideal time is to get in around 5pm. Spend some time till the sun sets and then go ahead with your day ."
Walk amidst the clouds,"This is a great experience to just walk through the clouds and good views when it’s sunny & clear.One can enter the Coakers walk after paying a nominal entry fee. There are various shops selling tea, ice cream, snacks and other wares along the pathway. There are few telescope view points where one could try spotting places on the opposite side  but it seemed to be closed when we had gone.All in all an enjoyable place to visit when in Kodaikanal"
Beautiful Views,"Located not very far from Bryant Park, Kodai lake and Market. This pavement gives you a good view of the valley. Must visit while in Kodai. Your tour operator will include it in Valley view package."

very cool and pleasent walk,though the view was fully blocked by fog we still enjoyed the walk throught the Coakers walk. the place is nicely maintained
Exceptional view ,The entry fee is 30. It is close to park or lake.Paid Telescopic view available. Shops are available on both the sides.
Love this place,"Just taking a walk here is so relaxing and soothing. Be sure to walk here during 3-4 PM, that's when it gets misty and you feel like walking through the clouds. The aroma of Kurunji flower makes this walk a delightful experience."
Nice walk,This is a good place to have a slow walk and enjoy nature. We were lucky to see Kurinji flowers in bloom.
Awesome view,We went at around 5 PM and the view was awesome. It is a place where we should go in the morning or evening. We will be in the fog and the view is amazing.
Beautiful views,Your vehicle cannot reach here. You have to walk in this place. But the walk is totally worth it. You can see the beautiful forest views. It's an unusual place. No noisy tourists. Good vibes. Very peaceful and calming.
"Lovely view for ""walk the talk""",Nothing like walking here on a sunny day. Amazing valley views. Picturesque place to take snaps as a backdrop.
"Nice ""","I went there with my best friend sahi honestly speaking I think there is nothing spcl to c but that is a special time with some one special na we can enjoy lot """
Nice viewpoints,"Do'nt miss this place. It offers multiple views of valley. Though you can visit any time, the best time to visit in morning."
cool walk,"Very enjoyable place to visit and we can go a nice valley view walk almost 1 km. Better to see the place when there is no mist , hence you can have clear view of the valley."
Good for a nice walk,"A beautiful place to have nice walk and enjoy the landscape of kodaikanal..If you visit the place during early morning or evening, it'll be perfect.. This opens at around 7.30 in the morning. It's the perfect place to have a morning walk, as there will be less crowd and shops around will not be open then.."
Nice viewpoint,A must-visit viewpoint. Walking in the premises itself gives you pleasure. Aged persons may feel some difficulty to walk.
Kurunji season - over,"The kurinji blossoms in kodaikanal is over. At kurinji garden in coakers walk,the kurinji plants are becoming dull and one or two flowers only are there."
Awesome,"It's a lovely place for a lovely walk! Do visit this place.. Not to be missed. Not very expensive, and few light shops in the sidewalk help cheering the environment along with Beautiful view."
A View to Watch,"Beautiful View of the Kodai from top of the hill. You can feel the clouds passing by, pictures, good for a memorable romantic walk :)There is a fee for entry, not good for children as they get bored walking. Worth for some good picture."
Mesmerizing view from the top of the hill,"The view of the surrounding hills, valleys and the habitation was indeed breath taking; we would have stayed for some more time had it not started raining. Must visit this place in liesure"
Great Walking pathway,"This is a nice walking path on the Kodai hillside with scenic views of the valley and surrounding hills.One can access the place by walking a short distanceFrom Bryant Park gate. The entry fee is not too high and there are shops selling tea, bhutta, boiled peanuts and ice creams along the path.The walk is amazing as one could walk through the mist and clouds. When weather is good, one can also enjoy scenic views of the valley and surrounding hills"
Nice relaxing walk but scenic view depends on mist and fog cover,This place is close to the Kodai lake and spreads over may be a half KM that over looks the valley and hillsThe views are usually blocked by dense mist (happened to us) but mist experience is also funLot of small shops for buying gifts and snacks will make it fun for all.
Awsome view,"The place is stretched for 1 km. It is located near to Kodaikanal Lake and next to Bryant park. The place is one of the famous tourist spots in kodaikanal and I surely not going to disappoint you. The view from this place is breath taking. When we went there, it was completely taken over by fog and the valley below was not viewable from the top. But still, we loved the place.There are few shops inside from where you can do shopping. While you walk and enjoy the view, don’t forget to eat sweet corn, you get best corns in kodaikanal. There is an entrance fee of Rs. 10 per head and for camera additional 50 Rs. There is also a viewing room from through telescope you can see distant places and for that you need to pay 20 rupees. It is indeed a must watch place if you visit kodaikanal, the princess of hills."
Walking 🚶‍♀️ ,Pay entry fee and start walking here you can see four points 1) City view 2) Kurinji garden 3) Vaigai dam view 4) Dolphin nose view 
Most beautiful view of kodaikanal,"One of the beautiful experience in kodaikanal. Walking peacefully looking at the clouds, the fog, the mountains, the valley, the flowers and the houses built on the hill. Entry fee of Rs. 30PP is higher. Good experience of walking along the mountain path."
The walk can be done by any age,The walk has been graded in such a way that it can be done by people from almost all ages. On one side the view of the valley and on the rising slope on the other side interesting trees and plants. View of the valley with binoculars is interesting. Valley has a different look at…
Best place for an evening walk,I always make it a point to be there whenever I visit Kodaikanal ! It is a serene place to walk and the valley view is truly breathtaking. I also end up munching some hot peanuts that are sold there . 
pleasant walk with good views,I reached here at 7.30 am when the shops were closed and there were 5-6 more people besides me on the walk. Its just a 15 min walk from one gate to the other. You can ask your driver to wait at the other gate or you can walk back to the first gate. I enjoyed the drifting clouds…
Mountain view,Excellent view subjected to the weather. You will feel the cloud hitting on you. Highly recommended to visit.
good,"Nice walk but all the time misty so only get to see fog and the valley remained invisible . Many stalls so Good place to shop for decorative items, hand made earrings .Eat fresh carrots, raw mango. My son enjoyed shooting balloons."
Walking in the clouds and great views,The whole experience was that of walking in the clouds. The place also offers killer views of the valley.
A nice walk and view,"We did Coakers Walk after Bryant Park. The walk is clean and well maintained with sufficient dustbins. I was able to spot the longtailed shrike, Nilgiris fly catcher and a spotted dove. I only ish there was a restroom at both entrance / exit, more people friendly and not as smelly. Otherwise a nice place to walk around."
Feels like Walking in the Sky,"Great and must visit experienceFeels like walking in the skyMermerising views, tranquility at its best"
Excellent scenic views from Coakers walk,"Coakers walk is good place for walking. through out the walk one can have scenic views of the valley and mountains, the walk is half km. you can sit down and relax."
Coakers walk,Nice long walk. Clean and well maintained.  It has very nice views  all through  the walk. The entry fee is a bit high
Short walk in clear day,This place is inside city so no need to do additional planning to visit here. if weather if clear and if there will no cloud then you may have good view of valley other wise only thing is cloud. this is around 500 m in length. you can cover this place along with your city visit or lake view.
Quest of neelakurinji ,Neelakurinji can be spotted midway through the Coakers walk however they have begun to fall in kodaikanal ending mid sept Walk is scenic with panoramic views of the hills n mountains
one of the iconic  spots of Kodai,"Many decades ago,  when Kodaikanal was  rustic and not crowded, we used to take walks on the coaker's walk daily. Then ther was no admission fees to enter , the walk was narrow , unspoilt, and rustic  full of tall flowering plants and many varieties of birds -it used to be the favourite haunt for early risers, the mist slowly enveloping you , the birds chirping from all directions.--it was paradise. Now , the walk has been widened, paved with stones, ugly steel grill alongthe edges, the trees having been cut away, no more bird songs to hear.  On both ends, gates have been fixed ad a fee collected for entering the walk! .nolonger the paradise it used to be."
Explored Neelakurinji flowers...,"Nice place with greenery, hills, flowers, pleasant climate in month of August.... in this place a lady sells handmade jewellery ... earrings, and set of earrings + neck piece at cheap price.... beautifully designed .."
We could see the rare Neelakurinji here,"We could see the rare Neelakurinji flowers which blooms every 12 years here. These may be seen till Oct - Nov this year. Next it will be seen only in 2030.This is about 1 km long walkway by the side of a hill in the heart of the city. You can enjoy the valley views while you walk and click photos. When we went some construction was going on, so that ppl can click better pictures with the Neelakurinji."
Great view,the view is really breathtaking it is a walk for about 1/2 km there are  some titbits to eat and some stall to shop from though the washrooms are not good when u reach the other end there are some shops which claim handmade chocolates but i suggest not to buy from there rather i saw a shop where it was machine made that is a legit place to buy chocolate
Good view of the valley from Coaker's Walk,"Coaker's walk is very close to Bryant's Park.There is an entrance fee; money is collected and no tickets are issued.You can walk along a fenced road and enjoy the beauty of the valley below.If you are lucky, clouds might pass through you.There is a view point house with telescope. Kids might find it enjoyable.The sad part is: it looks like it is used as a store room by the person-in-charge and vendors nearby.In order to make it easier for tourists to see kurinji flowers when it blooms, kurinji plants have been planted close to the path on the other side of the safety fence.We were lucky to see a number of plants with flowers that bloom once in 12 years.It is sad to note that not many tourists showed interest in seeing the once-in-12-years phenomenon. To keep the pathway clean, there are a number of dust bins hung on to the fence. For every 20 feet, there is dust bin. Even with so many bins, I noted with deep sorrow and anguish that even educated persons are not using these bins and are throwing trash and fruit peels on the path way and into the plants in the slopes.As is the case with every tourist attraction/temple, there is this vendor menace as an eye sore along the pathway. They spoil the beauty and serenity."
Excellent View of mountains,"With friends and family its a must visit place where you walk around with excellent view of the mountains and snow across kodaikanal.Its a good view and with pleasant climate, you will enjoy a lot.It has a ticket to enter, and its a must visit in Kodaikanal."
Exclusive walk by the side of great view,"Nice place to spend time with friends and relatives. Especially if you want to recall your childhood memories with close friends, it is an ideal place."
The search for Neel Kurunji,"This is a well laid out walk along the ridge of the mountain, in downtown Kodaikanal. An easy walk with lovely valley views all along. A great way for the city dweller to wander among the clouds and the mist that rises from the valley. We went there specially to get a closer…"
Nice place to have a stroll on misty mornings!!!,Nice view to enjoy and have a stroll or to spend some time in misty mornings!!! Very relaxing place and should visit when in kodai...
Iconic of Kodaikanal,"You cannot miss this place if you are in Kodaikanal.It a nearly a km stroll through pavement from where you can see amazing sceneries of mountains surrounding you and villages lying at the bottom of that.Dont be in hurry,spend atleast an hour here,it's really worth it."
Good view n nice place for a walk,Coakers walk is 500m from bus stand n Bryant park. Ticket charges 20 per person n cam/video charges extra. Famous for sunrise n sunset view (if mist is not covered-which is usually covered). They have few telescopes where u can pay n enjoy the view if it's clear. 
Like a mini Bazaar,"The walk is nice - if you look at the Valley ( swirling clouds and Fog ) and the beautiful plants . BUT , also there are Hawkers selling their wares every 25 feet - not sure why the Kodai authorities are allowing so many hawkers to spread themselves wherever they want . Due to…"
Serene,"The mist can spoil the view, but when it is clear, the view is amazing. There are a lot of beautiful places I have been to, but this place is in top 5."
Great! Walk the Talk,The path along you will walk you will find peaceful and as if you are walking in sync with the clouds 
A Must when you're in Kodai,Its a great experience to walk on the edges of the mountain with breathtaking views of the valley. A Must when you're in Kodai.
One of best places to take morning stroll,"What a view!!!  One could spend entire morning looking at the spectacular view along entire stretch.   There is telescope at the end, just try to view through scope.   There are some shops along the way providing local novelties. Do not miss this view. One of the best places for…"
Beautiful scenic valley view,"A popular tourist spot, you walk the stretch overlooking the beautiful hills & valleys. The stretch is donned with small stalls & vendors selling eatables & artifacts."
Good,It's a good place. Not much to say about it. I'm just filling up the space now. Sorry for the inconvenience
A real  pollution free walk path.,"One can walk along this stretch enjoying the scenic beauty of valley.Now being the season of Blooming Kurinji flowers(which blooms once in 12 years) we can see that plants recently planted there.If there is no mist one can view through telescope on payment of minimal charges the places like vaigai dam,Periyakulam.The entry fee is minimal for this place.The photo of Kurinji plantation is attached."
Coackers walk,"This week we visited Coackers walk. The scenaries were good. The maintenance of the location was poor. This time we were able to see Kurinji flowers.When comparing other tourist spots, we need to improve our house keeping and maintain the ecosystem clean to attract more visitors."
Excellent walking track with good views,It is a must visit place in Kodai kanal. This is a good walking track with good views. You can spend good time here.
Exclusive walking track with valley view,Coakers walk is an exclusively designed track for walking with a lovely view of the valleys. The walking track is tiled with seatings at intervals. However the entire track is poorly maintained particularly the chains are rusted and dilapidated. Vendors have put up stalls inside. There is no proper resting place and toilet facilities for tourists. It is sad to see such a lovely tourist place neglected. The best part is the plan to develop Kurinji flower park here. Hopefully things will improve in future.
Kodai Visit,Beautiful View point to enjoy and for photography. One of the best places to visit in kodaikenal.You can enjoy the brayant park and kodai lake which are very near to it.
Walk in natures lap,"...with each step you see a new view...enjoy the dance of mist, clouds and Sun...various bird and squirrels...we we're lucky enough to see a flower that blossoms every 12 years (2006, 2018 and next will be 2030)"
"A walk : beautiful,clean and refreshing.","This one was a marvel. We discovered this because it was next to our hotel. The tickets are price 20 RS with camera 50 RS. You get to walk around 1 km with some magnificent view of valley and Kodaikanal city. There are binocular available and many small eat out. The place was clean, maintained and safely pebbled. I love to come here for morning run but we were told it opens after 7:30 am. We found a very nice gentleman selling wooden masterpiece with paintings done on wood. Jus look him put a great piece of work."
Mast view of valley,This place is very beautiful one in kodai .Must go there.superb view of valley. Great place for hangout.
A walk to remember ,Though the place is open from morning to evening 7:30 I would personally recommend to visit coakers around 6 PM . This way you would be able to enjoy the view in light and darkness both plus this place is rarely crowded by this time . It is perfect for a romantic walk . You get a really great view of valley and city from coakers . Even after tiring dolphin nose trek I enjoyed walking around this place very much . The walk is not too long and is pleasant .
Breathtaking!,This is a must visit place for sight seeing in Kodaikanal. It gives you a brilliant view of the town as well as distant hills and villages. Visit before 2 pm as it tends to get foggy after that. I went there two times in my small trip of 5 days.
Peaceful walk above the deep Valleys!,The scenary and the beauty of this place can never ever be described with words. You can only feel the greatness when you go in person and visit the site. Amazing place for a long romantic walk!
nice place to view landscapes,Excellent place to view amazing city landscapes. It is approx 1/2 km walk and it is memorable to take pictures with the background.
Super views and walk with clouds,Super views and walk with clouds. Beware on ticket counter they are not paying back the change correctly.
Good view at right time,A place for walking fans. View is good if clouds are about to cover you. Greenery view otherwise. Normal view point.
Walk your way over clouds,It was a wonderful experience walking on the pathway amidst mist. A long walk indeed but we didnt feel tired at all. There are shops along the path so you could pick some souvenirs for your loved ones.
Lovely views,The place offers magnificent views with the moving clouds and high valley drop in the background. I would suggest you come early as there is less fog and great visibilty of the valley and also you have less people.
"A small, nice walk!","If you wish to enjoy some scenic valley views, go to Coaker's walk. When I went it was totally covered with clouds."
Evening walks in the clouds,We stayed at Kodai Resorts during our recent visit to Kodai. Coakers walk is just a 2 minute walk from the resort. It is a must see attraction and the misty clouds n skies give you an awesome feeling of being in the clouds.
Amazing views,"The place offers amazing views of the city, mountains and the plains. A must visit when you are in Kodaikanal."
excellent views !!,"scenic views of the valley and of the village, good point to have a nice picture and a memory of the kodai tour"
Beautiful sights to walk along,It is a clean and nice walk with beautiful sights. There are vendors along the walk that sell interesting snacks.We went during the off season so did not have to deal with large crowds. Recommend go in the morning as in the evening the mist covers the views.
Rejuvenating your body and relaxed walk,"A narrow pedestrian path of one kilometer mountain road which runs along the edge of steep slopes on the southern side of Kodai road which is 1/2km away from Kodai. The walk winding around mt. Nebo starts near van Allen hospital and joins the main road above St. Peter's Church provides a wide-angle spectacular view of the plains. On a cloudless, clear day one can have interesting sights, such as.... Dolphin's nose in south, valley of the pambar river in South East, birds eye view of Periyakulam and even city of Madurai."
Worth a walk ..... but,"One thing I am convinced about is to avoid the hills or anywhere for that matter during the holiday weekends. Everybody who is anybody turns up in every mode of conveyance possible and clogs up everything. If you hoped for quiet and peaceful walks ,forget it.Not going to happen. Coakers walk is no exception. You first need to park your vehicle somewhere. Then there is a queue to buy tickets. Then you weave your way through selfie wielding tourists and vendors and  everybody else. What joy is there in that ?? As an attraction , I really hope some attention is paid to the upkeep of the walkway- add flower beds so you bring in some colour , decent toilets please and remove vendors from the walk. If you must take care of their livelihood , do it elsewhere .Allow for uninterrupted  views of the distant valleys etc , which is why you ventured here in the first place."
weekend trip to kodai,entry tickets to coakers walk is 10rs for adults and camera 50 rupees. Entry and exit is from both sides. There are telescopes installed to watch the valley deep down. The view of the valley from coakers walk is just beautiful. Couples can go for a good romantic walk.
Amazing,"The best time to visit Coaker's Walk is before 2 pm for as the day nears dusk, the valley covers itself in a veil of beautiful mist hampering distant views."
Walk in Heaven..,It was so beautiful to walk in the Coakers Walk arena. The clouds you can see floating around you.The scenic beauty is at its peak. You can feel it is so fresh and the beauty of mountains and flora is at bounty. The temperature drops down by the evening so be careful to carry out some extra stitched cloths ;)
Good outing with family,"Ideal place for a walk along with family and kids. One can also get to taste local fruits such as passion fruit. On the right side, you have all the same shops and on the left, you get to see the great views!!"
 specially for nature lovers ,Hi....to all readers.. Proud to write a review about coakers walk... My native is Kodaikanal. I used to go daily to this place. I am a travel agent.. Not only for this I used to visit to fulfill my mind by watching a pleasent view which makes me fresh... Nice view of Theni and lower part of Kodaikanal with greenish scenery makes you feel perfect.. Believe me worth place... I feel happy to spend my time here... Enjoy your trip to coakers walk 🚶....
A Walk down the misty trail,This is exactly what you need aftr a tiring day of roaming around the Kodaikanal tourist spots which all lie in the same route which causes the traffic all along. This is a sweet spot. It's right next to the bus stand area. It's got a small entrance. But as you get into path you will realize it's beauty. It's a walk trail along the city which gives a great view.
Leisure walk,"A must for first timers to Kodaikanal, wonderful view, have some snacks while walking on this strip. This is for all ages to enjoy."
Hide-n-seek with clouds,"Super scenic view, especially if you going around monsoon season. Beautiful view as far as eyes can see, which is frequently blocked by clouds & yet you enjoy all the hide-n-seek...You can either choose to walk all along or just sit down on one of the benches & soak in mist & feel... Truly heavenly experience !Flip - Entry ticket contractor is a swindler"
Beautiful View,The Coakers Walk gives a beautiful view of the valley and the surrounding mountains and passing clouds.
Pleasant walk with a view!,Coakers walk is very scenic as you walk along the beautiful hills on one side. It is one of the best attraction of kodaikanal. Although there should be some activity apart from telescope views.
Heavenly Pleasure during Walk in the Cloud,"This place is unique, where you can find cloud invading whole of the Coakers Walk. Loved the flora and fauna throughout the  path when you progress from one end to another. You can see the deep slope in one side of the path. The stroll starts close to Van Allen Hospital and intersects the main road above St. Peter's Church. The entry fee is just Rs. 10 for all. Camera fee is Rs. 30 only."
nice walk with good views,"The place is good to have a walk around the hills with serene valley views, plains and clouds moving around."
Heaven on Earth,100% must see place on your visit to Kodaikinal. Just pray that it is not cloudy when you visit otherwise you will only see clouds and mist and not the beautiful view of the hills and the slopes downside. Avoid the weekend to go on a weekday when the rush has settled down. take a binocular with you with out fail and enroute in the walk taste the amazing fruits the vendors sell there.
nothing special just one view of coluds and seenery,dont go special this is on the way of other  so try to visit for 1 hour  enty was there for 20/- each person and even they collect the 30-/ for mobile phone. simple they are collecting the money
Fantastic Place,"Coakers walk is one of the attractions in Kodaikanal town. It is walkable distance from the bus stand. It is situated behind the lake and is of high altitude. There is a nominal entrance fee. They also charge for cameras. We had a very pleasant walk on this stretch. Very nice view to see around. One should not miss this place. Especially, the nature lovers. Very bad part is toilets are not properly maintained for the visitors."
Was a nice experience with full of fog,"Was a nice experience with full of fog. Lots of shops as usual. They charge hefty entrance fees. It has two entrances, its prefereable to choose the back side entrance as it will less traffic there."
Kodaikanal Coakers walk,Coakers walk is one of the attractions in Kodaikanal town. It is situated behind the lake and is of high altitude. We can have a pleasant walking with mist surrounding us. Nice view.
Wonderful ,"Any visitor to Kodaikanal should never miss this place. Especially, the nature lovers. The place is simply a walking space and no vehicles allowed. Nominal Entrance fee is collected for the upkeep of the beautiful spot. The tract runs about 1 km and located hardly 700 metres from Bus stand. During the walk, one can have mind refreshing views of the green mountains, blue skylines with white clouds floating along. Plenty of flowering plants and emerald forests down the valley and pleasant chirping sounds of birds can be experienced. The suddenly changing weather is another suprise during the walk.Fortunate to see the flowers of Kurinji plant that blossoms once in 12 years."
Nice View of the city....,Although the Telescope they have are substandard or not managed well as an experience...dont waste your money on it.
Very serene,"Spend an entire evening here. Walk, take pictures and you can also shop for unique glass earrings/ pooja articles from here. The valley view is breathtaking."
Average with average views,This is a pleasant but average walking experience. The views during the walk are also nothing much to write home about. Also you need to purchase tickets for this walk.
Excellent Climate,Enjoyed the walk with family and there was mist almost all over the view point. Excellent Climate - Must go
Excellent view,"Offers a eagle eye view of the place , well maintained. Though too commercial but the view is awesome. When it is raining it appears as you are walking in the clouds.NOTE to travellers - Climate keeps changing hence be ready for some unexpected showers, don't let the rain spoil all the fun. The telescope room is closed when it rains as it gets cloudy and nothing is visible."
A View Point near the Town,One of the major tourist attractions in Kodai. Provides some fabulous views. Visited earlier here. It was good at that time but It's not at all in good shape now. The Maintenance seems to be poor.
Nice view but poor maintenance,The coaker's walk offers a stunning view of the Misty hills. But the walkway is poorly maintained and was full of garbage. In the receipt I couldn't see the charged INR 25 per head. They charge for children and INR 10 for mobile as well. You need to pay separately for the telescope as well. Not worth the money.
Amazing view,This walk is a must if you are visit Kodaikanal. Enjoy the cloud as they rush near your face. Enjoy tea/coffee while viewing the scenic beauty from this place.
"Average maintenance, charged for kids as well","Municipality has fixed rates for kids as well, while maintenance is average...it's a place to walk not sure why it's paid..."
Nice view,Nice picture perfect view one cane get to see! Do wake up early in the morning just after the sunshine and when clouds come down on this cokkers walk track to exeperience amazing natural beauty!Charges : 35 inr (actually it should be free of cost since its hardly maintained)
Beautiful View but very congested in summer,The nearly 1 KM walk offers an excellent view of the valley. It is lined with many bric-a-brac shops and gets to be very crowded in the summer rush.
Good place for Kodaikanal standards,"Honestly, visiting Kodaikanal is a waste of money and efforts for those who travel over 400 kms. Especially for Bangalore crowd, they can go to nearby places like ooty, Nandi hills, yercaud, etcHowever, if you go to Kodai, then Coakers Walk is a must place to visit. Go in the evening hours and you can relax here. Very cramped roads leading to this place."
Breathtaking view of the hills and the valley,Coakers walk is literally built as a pathway on the edge of a cliff. It allows a 15 minute walk from entry till exit with some refreshment vendors on the sidelines. It gives open view of the entire valley and mesmerizing glance of the mountains.Very good place to visit
30 bucks for a decent stroll with views.. ,"Nothing has changed here! Same concrete footpath, kiosks selling everything from curios, food, wollens etc.. Ignore the right hand side and focus instead on the left, where the hill ranges beyond are perpetually cloudy and misty. Good for a one time visit"
Nice view on mist free days,A Nice place to have  a relaxed walk with nice beautiful scenery on one side. All the shops on the other side make it very congested and make it loose its charm.
Excellent View Point,We had a good view of the valley from Coakers Walk. The eateries along the walk also made us to crave for the snacks. Having an icecream is a must
Man made,It's an another man made creation of around 1 km walking plaza with the mountains around the path. Bicycle riding made me more exiting. It was a unique experience.
