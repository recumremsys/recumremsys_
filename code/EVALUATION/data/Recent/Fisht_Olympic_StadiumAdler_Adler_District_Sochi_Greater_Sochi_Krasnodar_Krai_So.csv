Its a football ground,Good facilities and transport links .Not really too much more I can say . It is what it is  you go to watch  a game
Soccer World Cup German vs Sweden,Had a fantastic weekend in Sochi watching the world cup soccer game of Germany vs Sweden. The stadium is first class within great hotels nearby
Beautiful Stadium - Especially if you get to watch CR7 score a hatrick at the World Cup,"This stadium is just as pretty as the city. Fisht is rightfully Sochi's centerstage for football. We saw Portugal take on Spain in the World Cup '18. What an atmosphere, what a pitch, what a location."
new and modern and well built,Good new building with good stadumvery modern and well builtThere was about 45 thousands people watching Australia Peru in this stadium
lovely setting,this stadium looks like a spacecraft. the arrangements are wonderful. there are electric buggies from station or bus stop. broad ramps to access seats and upper floors. big service areas and toilets
Spectacular Stadium,We went to Russia for Soccer World Cup 2018....My son played for Peru...so Sochi was a must...Peru vs Australia...The Stadium is Spectacular...View is excellent from all seats..Very well organized the logistics...Always somebody to help you find your way...It has food and drinks really reasonable prices..Location is in the Olympic Village..Adler...Train from downtown Sochi is the best way to go og you are not staying in Adler...It is also accessible by bus.
Futuristic shape of the stadium,I like the shape of the stadium in the context of all the olimpic park. The stadium is a turned whale...View from each seat of the stadium is perfect and access to the stadium too
Great Mudinal game!,Watched the 1/8 (Portugal vs Uruguay) and 1/4 finals (Russia vs Croatia). Great facility and location
Croatia vs Russia,an amazing stadium and lovely access to the venue saw one of the best matches when Croatia beat Russia in the penalties in this stadium.The stadium is next to a beach and has a host of eating joints
Amazing,"An amazing modern venue, great viewing of the field, easy to get a drink, exudes atmosphere. Was functional to enter arena and the service was very good when dealing with ticket issues. Worth a visit"
Impressive,It was built for the Winter Olympic Games 2014 in Sochi. It's located in the Olympic Park in Adler.I was there with my family for Uruguay vs Portugal World Cup match. Great infrastructure. Very well organised. Great experience. Hoping to catch some more games there some time!
Sochi big stadium,The Olympic Stadium of Sochi is a wonderful architecture it was established before the winter olympic games in Sochi 2014. I was lucky to attend the first match in round 16 in the 2018 worldcup. Beside the stadium you can find the park and the big skiing court in Sochi. The good thing that they are near the airport but a bit far from Sochi center.
The best experience ever!!!,Germany vs. Sweden World Cup 2018 Game!!! AMAZING. Everything around the stadium and in the stadium was perfect. The stadium from afar looks amazing day and night. It is impressive and breathtaking.
Excellent,"Very nice stadium. Saw Spain vs Portugal there and boy, did we get our money's worth! As it is smaller, you can see the match properly. And of course, Ronaldo made every second worth it!"
Amazing watching game at Fisht Olympic Stadium,Fisht Olympic Stadium is located along the sea and view from stadium is also great. Excellent facilities and we really enjoyed watching  FIFA world cup game in a great atmosphere here.
Good for football,Watched World Cup football match and stadium was great for this purpose. Approximately a 15 minute walk from the station.
Beautiful stadium,"Thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful stadium during the Panama- Belgium World Cup game.  The entraces are clearly marked. They have good sport event food and decently priced, even though the World Cup was going on.  The stadium is located right across from a beach of the beautiful Black Sea."
Modern Stadium,"Here for the WC for aust vs peru. Modern stadium, great pitch and perfect views of the play from anywhere on the ground. Only down sight is the long walk from the buses."
Its big,Went to the World Cup game between Australia and Peru at this stadium. It is very large and new. The precinct has lots of other sporting venues.
Wonderful piece of art,"Watched Portugel - Spain here. I was a great experience, great organization and incredible well located"
Very good venue perfect organization ,"We went there for a world championship football match. The bowl is tight so the visitors are sitting quite near to the pitch. We had good sight from the sixth level on the opposite stand. Restrooms, food & beverage booths are located throughout the different levels which is very convenient. The venue is equipped with a powerful WiFi. We were excited about the smooth entrance procedure although the stadium was almost sold out.It was a very enjoyable experience."
Amazing ,Came here for World Cup Germany v Sweden What a amazing stadium  has all great facilities food and drinks all reasonably priced I come from Melbourne were the mcg is the best ground in the world but this is right up there The seating was great. Could be any were and you would see everything The pitch was also amazing  And yes what a match
World cup,Came here to see football during World Cup and I've nothing bad to say about the arena. Good atmosphere during the game and there is a roof over you head as long as you don't sit behind the goals on each side. Definitely worth a visit for any bigger arrangement
Great modern stadium,"Visited during the World Cup 2018. Very modern stadium, easy to find your way around. Great atmosphere when full (and seeing the right game !)"
New and beatiful,"We visited a match in this stadium. Stadium is easily accesible thanks to personnel and number of gates, you can enter the stadium with minimum waiting time in the que. 5min max if all tickets to the stadium is sold"
Nice,The Olympic Park is really amazing.. You can visit it for few hours with friends or kids.. It offers lots of indoor and outdoor activities
"good match, terrible stadium","It was 2017 Cup of Russia Finals.  I don't discuss Soviet style game organisation here. Very good game, but stadium, despite new, looks destroyed and not finished in the same time. Broken floors, extremely expensive catering, dirty and uncomfortable seats that may cause damage to your clothes or skin, dirty toilets, long fences around, transportation only by buses. To experience only the game, not the stadium."
Very nice stadium,Very nice stadium. The confederations cup will be great here in June. I think the guys will do a great job.
if you are in Stchi...,"we visited the onlympic installation, it was very quiet in June, not many people great installation but nothing happenning there, problem to get there by car only one road and it takes 4 hours at least to drive the last 200km"
Great architecture,"First Olympic Stadium, Sochi’s biggest new sporting venue designed by sports architecture firm Populous. The building, named after a nearby mountain, features a latticed facade design based on faberge eggs and has a retractable roof."
Enormous stadium,"Огромный стадион, который сейчас на реконструкции к чемпионату мира по футболу 2018 и, к сожалению, внутрь пройти нельзя. Можно осмотреть только снаружи.This huge stadium is under reconstruction now to prepare it for the Football World Cup 2018, so you can go inside. Just a walk around."
"Beautiful stadium, shocking construction.",I worked here for 9 months for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics so I can't say I'm much of a fan of this place !
huge and nice structure,huge and nice structure in a complex that include formula 1 road and some indoor winter sports nearby Olympic station and Azimut hotel.
Evening Walk,"This is just to say you were there and if you do the walk in the evening the dancing fountain show is quite good. It is a good place to ride bicycles, rollers, etc although from Sochi to Adler and Rosa Khutor there are many places to do this."
Rebuilding for legacy,The stadium was closed when i visited. Presumably they're getting ready for the World Cup. You can get a good view from the Olympic Park all around which is impressive in itself
The 2014 Olympic Stadium,"Great atmosphere! I was there for both the opening and the closing of the Paralympic Games and they were one of the greatest shows I've seen. The stadium had rails on top, so lots of performers and items were flying by. I don't know if it's still used as a stadium, but if it is it's worth a visit."
Will be better when finished,"Stadium is incomplete. Outstanding works were well hidden during the Sochi 2014 Games but will need to be finished to a much higher standard before the 2018 Football World Cup. Open manholes, raw sewage, emergency exits into dead-ends, dangerous steps, incorrect signage, the list is endless. The design is superb, the execution is diabolical."
Fantastic opening ceremony !,Had a great time watching the Olympics opening. Great technology - amazing projections of videos and pictures. Very well organized to find your place and to get out again.
