"Exciting nature, too many tourists","The place is simpy unique, the best geyser all over Iceland.The tourist impact is heavy, although the space is large enough to allw you watching the geyser sprout, which happens at 3'-5' intervals, quite regularly."
Underwhelming ,A good experience for half an hour but not as dramatic as you would expect.  Good thing to do if you are on your way somewhere.
Miraculous earth activity!,You wait just a little and pouuuf! you see a wander! It is just amazing how the earth functions and it is something not to miss!
A must if you go to Iceland. Impressive!,"Iceland is beautiful, everywhere. A unique experience. This is one of its places you cannot miss, the only place in Europe with these geysers. If you want to see something similar, you need to go to America... Take your time to walk around and enjoy the spectacular nature. The weather is very often cloudy and rainy, except some exceptions with lovely weather. Be ready with good clothing , be patient and make a full immersion in this environment, you will be satisfied. Iceland offers people a chance to see the earth the way it was."
"Nice, but cafe is the star!","The geyser area is cool, but gets pretty crowded.  The main geyser goes off about every 5 minutes, so as long as you're patient you will get a glimpse of it.  The smaller pools around it seemed dormant.  We ate at the cafe which was great!  Hot and cold sandwiches were also available.  I had the meat soup which was a hearty soup with lamb, potatoes, carrots and tasty broth. It came with bread and butter, and was just what I needed on a cold day!  Washrooms and free parking available. Nice gift shop as well."
Not Super Impressed,"The geyser area was good but I donâ€™t think great. It was a bit crowded when we arrived. The geyser does go off frequently and we saw it about three times. The day was cold and pretty clear in March. I have been to a Yellowstone a few times and unfortunately this one is nice, but small."
Beautiful and Entertaining!,"The geyser area is well-roped off and labeled, as there are many smaller heated pool areas to look at as well that are fun to watch. The main geyser seems to go off every few minutes, so you will definitely see a show! I got it on camera! So awesome!"
Fabulous!,What an amazing natural spectacle!Lovely shop too although as usual in Iceland everything is expensive!
Big one,"Visiting this geothermal field is very convenient.It is literary next to the main road.There is couple of geysers but two of them are the biggest .There is no clear pattern how often the water is pumped out in the air but between 6-10 min usually .There is no really much of time once the water start to boil so keep your camera ready all the time.Put the video on the slow motion mode and you will have a great video...especially second before the water is splashed out (color of the water is wonderful).If you are going to visit this place during the winter,have you crampons(ice cleats) ready...just in case that there is a ice around!"
Great at sunset,Because of the sunny weather (next day they expected snow) we did visit the geyser at sunset and it was amazing. It errupts every 5 minutes (approximately) so you can stay and watch it multiple times. It was around 17.30 when we arrived so there were hardly any people left.
Blowing it's top!,"The Strokur geyser blows it's top every 6-7 minutes but we were lucky to see two eruptions of the same size one after the other. I'm not sure why this happened but it takes everyone by surprise.Waiting for Strokur to blow you can see the water level bulge upwards into a large blue bubble a split second before it releases it's steam. Surrounding the geyser are a couple of smaller pits where the water is on constant boil showing just how much heat there is in the ground, yet, ironically, there is snow and ice everywhere."
Impressive,Strange to see the geysers heat and power surrounded by ice and snow. Would recommend a visit we did it as part of the golden tour.
Stunning,"Waiting for the geyser is exciting and when it goes off it is a genuinely wow! It is well worth the drive up from Reykjavik and a great combination to see with Gulfloss nearby too. The hot springs are well populated but the site is well managed, so it doesn't feel crowded. There is a decent shop with loos at the site, food there is expensive but no more than the rest of Iceland."
Big Blow-off,"A must see site which is worth the wait, each time. See if you can see the dome of water just before the spout. Deliciously eggy smell."
Wow,"The Geyser was better than we expected. We went to visit it at the end of February and surprisingly it wasn't busy. The geyser goes off every 5-10 min which it gives you the opportunity to see more that once. There weren't any fees to pay, which was a nice bonus.There's a large free parking area which also had many amenities such as many gift shops, toilets and restaurants."
Impressive,"This was our second big stop on our self-guided tour of the Golden Circle. The entrance is free, there is a big information center with WCs, restaurant and shops. The hot springs of different shapes and sizes are amazing, the Strokkur geysir was erupting every 4 minutes, the weather was nice and sunny. A lot of tourists, but we still enjoyed it a lot."
Natural Wonder,"Part of the 'Golden Circle' tour.  the Churn geyser errupts at some 5 minute frequency.  However, the force of erruption can be quite variable from a small spurt to a large fountain.  It is worth waiting for the spectacle of a large blow, particularly if you want to capture an impressive photograph.  The nearby Geysir Centre offers lots of opportunities for sounenirs and a wide variety of refreshment."
Great but so busy!,"The coaches upon coaches of tourists sort of ruin this place. The car park is heaving with huge buses blocking roads. The paths through the area are so crowded however it is kind of expected for this location. I recommend trying to go as early as possible in the day to avoid the groups. There is a visitor centre you can visit if you wanted to grab something to eat however we avoided due to prices! Parking is free which is good. There is one large Geysir that erupts very frequently, a sight to see for sure!"
Worth the trip!!,"My first Geyser!!Great area, great suspense and great restaurant and gift shop....well worth the trip!!"
Day trip,"We did our own golden circle tour self drive which was excellent,  this was one of the stops, takes about 30min to walk around and there is a retail outlet there with restaurants and toilets, well worth being one of your stops."
Interesting nature,"Pay a visit to this natural beauty - the geysir that splashes hot water every 4 to 8 minutes. The water is literraly boilling. Although it was -12 C,there was no ice or snow in the little area near the geysir."
Must see place,This place is a must see and do but do it on a tour package with other stops But sill worth your time
Wow!,"Well never experienced this before! The water bubbling away and then exploding infront of your eyes. Every 10 minutes or so the Geyser erupts so plenty of opportunity to witness nature at it's best. Slight smell of sulphur but not too overwhelming and onsite restaurants, shops and facilities excellent."
Leave more time to explore,"The Circle tour is fabulous.  However, it demands more than one day to complete it.  I wished I had planned for more time at the Selfoss Geyser, because there was so much to see.  With more time, I would have hiked up the hillside and staged better photos of the geyser in action."
Disappointing,"The geyser is not impressive, it's nothing like Old Faithful in the US - it's kind of like a ""little fart"" as my kids called it. We went in winter, very cold and windy and waiting to see a small little bubble of a geyser. Maybe it's better in spring/summer."
