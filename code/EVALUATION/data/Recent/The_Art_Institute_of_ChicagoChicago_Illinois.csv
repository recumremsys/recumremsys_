A must museum,We wanted to see the Monet exhibit and paid for the skip the line ticket along with it and it was worth it. The wait when we went was an hour. When you’re there for a few days you want to get the most out of your time so it was worth it because the exhibit was pretty amazing. The museum itself is pretty impressive! It’s a must when visiting Chicago I would say.
Wonderful visit with some old friends....,"We visited some “old friends” in the Monet Exhibit, which was very well done.  They had a quick multimedia space in the exhibit that was very educational and pointed out key features of the paintings of the haystacks, Westminster Bridge, and Monet’s garden in Giverny.  A few other old friends were Wood, Matisse, Seurat, Van Gogh, O’Keefe, Stieglitz, Tiffany, Sargent, Copley, Stickley,  Wright, Lee, Warhol, Pollack, Mondrian, Magritte, Renoir, Hopper, Chagall, Cassatt, Degas, Manet, Picasso, Dali, Lautrec, Calder, Man Ray, Cezanne, and many others.  We didn’t come close to seeing them all.We used the Chicago City Pass for entrance, and the Monet exhibit was and additional $7 each.  The Art Institute practiced excellent social distancing, and had timed entrances for Monet, lots of museum guides, signage, and reminders about masks throughout.  Wonderful experience, and I could spend our whole trip here."
A Must Do When in Chicago ,"We live a few hours away, and neither my boyfriend or I have been in at least 10 years. So to celebrate our anniversary, we decided to take the trip up. The staff were very friendly. The museum has many beautiful pieces. We can’t wait to come back see everything we missed! We spent about 3 1/2 hours and covered maybe half of the museum. We’ll definitely be back as soon as we’re able!"
The number 1 reason to visit Chicago – The IMPRESSIVE Art Institute of Chicago!!!,"If you only have time to visit one attraction in Chicago then head on over to Michigan Ave and visit the Art Institute of Chicago. With such a large and well-rounded collection of masterpieces from ancient to contemporary time there is plenty for everyone to enjoy. On top of that, the “El Greco: Ambition and Defiance,” and “Monet and Chicago” exhibitions were stunning, well curated, and representative of each master’s portfolio. Bravo!! Getting tickets on-line in advance is a must, especially for the Monet exhibit. I realized I would need plenty of time to thoroughly enjoy everything on display and so I scheduled two afternoons to allow sufficient time to see it all. I only wish I could share more photos with you of this excellent collection. Truly one of the US’s greatest art museums and Chicago’s greatest asset."
"A Chicago must ... if you're down for art, that is. :)",Amazing collection of work and beautiful museum to get lost in. The museum was operating at 25% capacity due to the pandemic. It was a blessing and a curse. A curse because not as many people can enjoy the museum on any given day but a blessing because you have a lot of room to move around in.
Awesome Art,Something for every taste. All employees were nice and helpful.  We spent almost 5 hours there. Truly enjoyed our time there.  I wish the cafe had been open - we could have used a break with coffee or wine.
Beautiful Artwork,"The museum had an amazing collection. We spent 5 hours here and possibly could have stayed there longer. The only reason why we left was for food and our legs were tired of walking . Next time I visit Chicago, I will be coming back here."
Beautiful and unbelievable!,The regular and special exhibits are amazing. The gift shop has great gifts for friends and family. Have not been since Covid
Solo,Great adaptation to new normal.  The museum kept visitors distant but also let us see the incredible works.  Making reservations online was ok.
Wait Time,"The wait was long, the institute was very good but the staff was not friendly and seemed people kept taking their masks off."
World Class Art Museum!,We very much enjoyed our visit to the art institute. The exhibits are world class in every respect. We particularly enjoyed the Monet exhibition. We took advantage of their self-guided tour that you could download onto your phone.  Our only regret was that we did not have more time to spend.
So worth the admission,"For the size of the museum and the quality of the art pieces that they have, the admission price is definitely worth it.  Had a great time.  Was surprised (and pleased) that the museum allows non-flash photography of all their artwork.. even the highly famous pieces.  Very much liked that."
Still #1 in Chicago!,"So much to see and do, get there early and stay all day, if you can afford to stay in Chicago come back the next day to see more or to visit the Planetarium or the Aquarium!"
World Class art museum,"Cafes are good, don't miss the Chagall windows, impressionist wing, airwalk over to the park.Nothing else to say!"
Fantastic!,"With museums back open, I recommend that you consider going to the Art Institute. It’s incredibly safe and sterile, and there were very few people at the museum, which made the art viewing experience unprecedented. In many cases, we were the only people in individual galleries. All of the work on display is fantastic, and I highly recommend that you take 15 or 20 minutes to go see the miniature exhibition from the 1930s, which has wonderful scale models of early American and European interior design and architecture. The collection of contemporary art is world class."
Amazing place to spend the day!,I can get lost in this place it's so big and so fun!  We have been coming here for 30 years and never stop finding new things to look at and enjoy!
Culturally fun!!,"I am an Art Admirer. When I walked in the museum, the Staff are very cordial. I can always go there and there are so much to see from the art to sculptors, etc.  Before the Covid-19, I went often and stayed longer in the museum. In addition, I liked the different exhibits. The cafe have delicious food where one can sit and enjoyed the scenery, but that was before the Covid-19 pandemic."
The Greek Conquers ,"Went to the El Greco show.  It belongs in the “must see” category.  Beautifully presented.  Enough verbiage to provide good context, but the show was the art not the text.  Main focus was religious art - as it should be, but a smattering of other works also presented.  Color!  Emotion!  What a master!"
Wonderful variety of pieces,"We arrived the 2nd day they opened after being closed due to COVID. We were able to see the art easily and would wait a minute or two then had an unobstructed view. We could observe the art and take pictures without jostling elbows.We got turned around a couple times looking for signature pieces and the docents were kind to get us on the right path. All wore face masks inside. We were happy with everything we saw. A couple sections were closed, the paper weights and another one. We regret we did not come right at opening hour as we would have spent all our time there, we were a bit rushed in the evening to see all the artwork and still missed some. We did see the Thorne Miniatures on the lower level and I recommended it highly.We used the free app to hear recordings about some pieces. Not all the art has a number but those that do have 2-3 minute extra content. It adds to the experience of seeing the art and knowing more. I would come again and recommend it to others."
Amazing collections in a wonderful building: a must for any Chicago tourist,"The Art Institute of Chicago is for sure one of the best museums in the world. The building is modern and travelling around different historical areas and collections is super smooth. On top the incredible art you can see in this museum, its location in the heart of Chicago and in the park area is perfect. Recommend to use the app audio guides to follow the descriptions for free."
DO NOT GO UNTIL THERE IS A VACCINE!,"Sadly, while the museum’s holdings are wonderful, the planning that went into reopening was terrible.  There are timed ticket reservations required, and per the museum staff I spoke with, they’ve capped the tickets at 25% of normal capacity....but these reservations are NOT timed:  so, the museum has no control over WHEN the 25% shows up.  Other museums (for example the Cleveland Museum of Art) have timed entry to the museum so they can control the flow of visitors.Now imagine a large bulk of the daily Art Institute visitors showing up in the same 2-3 hours, and all wanting to see the museum’s blockbuster holdings.   When everyone want to see Surat or Nighthawks or American Gothic, that is a huge problem.Then handling of the el Greco special exhibit was equally thoughtless in terms of entry:  the only way to get in is to arrive at the top of the second floor landing entrance to the exhibit and look on a display sign with a phone number to text to join a virtual waiting room....only to find out the waiting time before you can go in.  Why would the museum require visitors go to one particular spot in order to sign up on a list to get in later?  Every special exhibit that I’ve ever been to has a timed ticket entry, so why not this el Greco exhibit?  It’s easier to control social distancing and spacing if you time entry for 5-6 people at a time (on a reservation basis) every 15 minutes!  That would give those 5-6 people time to move on one or two rooms before the next group and space people out.  This is not difficult to figure out, except perhaps, sadly, if you’re the Art Institute.I waited 40 minutes in the “virtual waiting room” looking at other parts of the museum (which was lovely) and then entered the el Greco special exhibit.  Note to staff - don’t just stand around milling near the entry.  Instead, one of you should open the door for visitors once they’re told it’s their turn to enter in order to cut down on the door becoming a high touch service - I say this because you have to go through a door that must be pulled, there is no hand sanitizer in sight, and the handicapped auto door opener was broken!  Once I entered, I spent about 10 minutes in the special exhibit space:  the exhibit rooms were too small and poorly ventilated for the number of people in them.  The staff let way too many people in because visitors (a) had not moved on yet to the next room; or (b) were spending longer looking at the art than the staff anticipated.  Perhaps the staff was feeling the pressure of getting people in prior to the museum closing for the day?  Whatever the reason, there was zero social distancing - it wasn’t possible with the number of people.  A small detail (but the small details MATTER!):  the write-ups about each art piece is white lettering on grey paper - difficult to read unless up close (which also does not help with social distancing).On a positive note, every single person I saw during my visit wore a face mask....if you don’t want to wear one, do not visit!"
must visit,everyone should visit this place whether you are a long time resident of Chicago or visiting for the weekend
Van Gogh room was mesmerizing,"World-class museum. Only spent a couple of hours there on a ""scavenger hunt"" with a 10 year-old. Would like to return to spend more time. Great diversity and depth."
Amazing collection,"An excellent collection and I also enjoyed the Andy Warhol exhibition. Everything from impressionists to modern art, from ancient Roman sculptures to Chagall's America windows, it is hard to list all what this museum has on offer."
Some of the world's great art,"Van Gogh, Renoir, Seurat ... great impressionist collection and the godfather of all pointillism painting. Beautiful museum, great, well-known art - too many to name, so just go check it out!"
Outstanding Art Collection!,It has amazing collection art; and you may want to allow yourself couple of hours here. I like the fact that there are guides who are very helpful to assist in case you get lost and need more info.Very well organized.
Gallant Gallery,"I went with a friend to spend an afternoon here on a snowy day. This is an ideal thing to do, if the sky is cloudy and the observation decks would be pointless to visit. Of course, if you are a lover of art, you shouldn't miss this: So many masterpieces, and yet we managed to visit only a fraction of the galleries."
Did not disappoint!,"The gallery welcomes you as you arrive downtown Chicago. My friends and I wanted to sightsee somewhere close from where we met up. The art gallery was perfect for a half-day --- or whole day tour. They have a lot of exhibits from different cultures, eras and mediums. When we were there, we also saw some artists re-creating paintings. Pretty neat to stop and watch if you're tired from walking around. Make sure to avail the student discount if you can."
Awestruck,"What an amazing collection and experience.  I wish I'd had time to go back to take in what I'd missed.  Lovely, lovely visit."
The temple of arts,"Great, amazing museum amassing various interesting works of arts from many periods. Ancient Rome and Far East, european classics, modern-day american arts are just few examples. Museum is well-organized, I’ve spent all day there but wasn’t exhausted or bored. There is also a nice cafe. And don’t forget about a discount for online tickets purchase."
Review for Thorne Miniature Rooms and Gift Store ONLY,"I specifically went here to see the Thorne Miniature Rooms.  I arrived almost 2 hours til closing, so I knew I did not have much time to stop and stare.  There were 68 rooms total located in the basement of the museum.  What a treat!  For miniature and dollhouse enthusiasts, this is an exhibit to see!  The detail of each room from the furniture to the ""exteriors"" was amazing.  Each room told a story with gardens, landscapes and even the Eiffel tower peeking through the various windows, doors and balconies.  There was even a true to scale cathedral (the first room as you enter).  I could have stayed longer, but the museum was closing.  My only gripe would be the ""not so friendly, clearly hates his job"" security guard at the entrance who liked yelling if you got too close or took pics/videos.  Besides that, I would be more than happy to pay the $25 entrance fee to see this exhibit again.  It's a window to history.  Lastly, I did visit the gift shop as it was open an additional 30 minutes after the museum.  The ladies there were extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  The staff in the museum from the entrances to the check points to the gift shop were all super friendly (besides that one guard downstairs).  Overall, I had a lovely experience and sure you will as well."
Great visit,Our second visit to the Art Institute.  What an amazing place! Many famous works of art - we loved the impressionist paintings.
This place is amazing... coming from a non-art fan,"Even though I'm not a big fan of art, I have to say this place is quite amazing.  It seems to go on forever.  Even for the non-art fan like myself, there are things that did stand out.  My favorite was the miniature rooms.  Overall, I think you could easily spend 3-4 hours here."
Amazing must-see! ,This place was WAY too big for us. We saw many exhibits (including one on paperweights for some reason) and just got tired of walking so we left before we could see many of the paintings upstairs. They should have more places to sit but it's an exceptional place and was glad to be able to check it off the bucket list.
Wonderful and diverse museum,"This museum is absolutely amazing. You can find modern art, classical art, and some jewels: don't miss the chinese, japanese, buddhist and indian expositions. Those are absolutely amazing. Also, the impressionist pavilion is breathtaking."
The recent extension really enhances the gallery experience,"This is an excellent world class museum with an important collection of American and European art. The temporary exhibitions at the time of our visit were well chosen and curated and we enjoyed the outstanding permanent collection including significant works by the Impressionists, Gaugin and others. We also particularly valued the opportunity to see Hopper's ""Nighthawks"" and Wood's ""American Gothic"". There is a lot to see in this excellent museum so allow plenty of time."
World Renown Works of Art,"This is a great place to nourish your soul and take in amazing works of art (and to laugh at some items that are classified as works of art, LOL)."
Great collection and well presented,"Popped into the Art Institute having been on my bucketlist for a while. It is definitely worth looking in. Since I'm from the UK where the museums are free, this is definitely slightly more expensive than I thought for my money's worth. But the collections are definitely well presented and everything is well spaced out. I spent about 2 hours throughout the whole museum (at a leisurely pace). There are few van Gogh, Renoir, Rubens, John Miller pieces along with some very exotic unknown paintings so make sure you do explore each section of the museum. I didn't use the audiobooks - however, since there is wifi throughout the museum, just a google read can provide you with good insight about the portraits. I also popped into the El Greco collection, which was okay, but you won't miss much if you don't go to that part of the museum!"
Overwhelming large,"So much amazing art!  The new El Greco exhibit was spectacular. But be ready to get all your steps in for the day/week.  There's lots and lots of walking between the floors and exhibits.  The layout of the museum was confusing, but every guide was so helpful in getting us to where we wanted to go."
OMGoodness - Who Knew????,"Outstanding collection, well presented all without pretense.  I was delightfully shocked.  A truly world class art museum.  One day is not engough."
Amazing collection and facility,"One of the largest art museums in the world, and there is so much fascinating history behind the collection(s).  Purchasing the tickets ahead of time (e-ticket) is a great time-saver!"
Captivating,"A great place for homeschooling families to enter into the world of art. Also, a place to grab a sketch pad and some pens or pencils and copy the great artists throughout history. The gift shop offers prints and other trinkets for take-home a piece of artist memories."
Is it being unfaithful to say that this is as good as the V&A....I feel disloyal...but,Lordy lordy. Just go. I could have spent days here. Super space. Great collection. Helpful staff.... Cant wait to go back.
Too much for one day,"So many wonderful artifacts to see in one day!The El Greco exhibit (extra $7) had just opened, so we were very lucky!  Some of his paintings had never before left Spain!  The rest of the Museum was excellent.  There are plenty of guides to answer any questions.  Whatever art suits your fancy, you will find it here.  They do offer a Military Discount with ID.  We will be back someday!"
El Greco,Wonderful museum! We especially enjoyed the “El Greco” exhibit. This museum is so vast that you could spend an entire day here. We picked the impressionist artists and El Greco for today’s visit.Ps use the valet to park for $28.00
Amazing!!!,"I recently spent an afternoon here. The sheer amount of art is incredible, and they have quite a few famous pieces. The only negative is that the museum is difficult to navigate and even the map is confusing. A wonderful employee showed us how to read the map to figure out where things were."
Too much for one day trip,"I was in Chicago, (actually Rosemont) for the fourth annual trip to the RV show. This time, I stayed over an additional day for the specific purpose of visiting the Art Institute. I was not disappointed. The collections are fantastic and representational of the periods, and genres. I was impressed by the quantity and variety of the ancient collections and really enjoyed being able to walk up to and closely examine the works. There are plenty of docents and guards around to keep enquiring fingers from spoiling these priceless works. My ONLY regret is that I don't have a photographic memory, and that my feet wore out before getting to the Asian and early American exhibits."
Great place to spend a few hours and nourish your mind ,"Place was great. Lots of different exhibits for everyone, and even better with the audio tour. I don’t know much about art, but anyone can appreciate the collections at this museum. Wonderful time!! Highly recommend."
"Superb museum, excellent experience","One of the world's great art museums, a must-see for the cultural traveller, with wonderful art, courteous staff and excellent visitor facilities, all at a reasonable price (by today's standards)."
Lovely art,"One could spend an entire day at this museum. They had several classic pieces, a nice gift shop and a wonderful restaurant."
World class,"A top tip is to go to the Willis Tower first thing before the crowds. You then benefit from getting the savings from a combination ticket with the museum (USD 49). After giving yourself the vertigo-induced willies from jumping around on a piece of glass 1000 feet up, you can then mosey over to the museum for its opening around 10.30 am. Voted the best museum worldwide for just about the last half decade. It really does have an outstanding, extraordinary permanent collection. It has the full set of iconic paintings made familiar from numerous reproductions. Endowed with the best collection of impressionist art outside France, we spent two hours here before de-sensefication set-in. We hardly scratched the surface of this amazing place."
Go for the Seurat alone!,"The impressionist wing and the contemporary pieces alone are worth the visit. Monet, Manet, and all the French boys are here as are Warhol and Liechtenstein and the creative cauldrons of the 50s and 60s. Kiss your love in front of the Chagall windows, just like Ferris Bueller once did."
Great exhibits wonderful people terrific location.,"This museum is a MUST when visiting Chicago.  It never disappointing!  Picasso, Dali, Caldar.... The museum is stunning!"
So much to see,So many beautiful types of art work that 1 day does not seem like enough time to see it all! My membership is worth it!
One of USA's best,If I only stop in one place in Chicago it would be the Art Institute. The impressionist rooms are infamous for the breadth and quality of their holdings but the entire museum (and its expansions) contains wonders.  Don't miss the Chagall windows.
Andy Warhol Exhibit,"Amazing work.  It makes you struggle with what is modern art.    When Warhol created his works, many people did not get them.   Probably true for Van Gogh too.  Today we have many graffiti artists who work with a spray can. 40 years from now their work will be worth a fortune, much like Warhol's."
Great Chamber Music Program,"Went to a CSO Chamber Music at the Art Institute program. Totally enjoyed it. Before the string quartet played (and they were fabulous), we received a lecture on the connection between the music and some of the paintings. After the concert, we were offered a thirty minute tour of the museum. My favorite exhibit is The Thorne Room of model houses and rooms."
The annual pass is worth it!,"This is the first year we got an annual pass. You get a members tote and can get free coffee in the members lounge. The museum is so large that it took us a day per floor! With the pass you do not have to pay extra for special exhibits, you can skip the ticket lines and you get free coat check. We will definitely get another one next year."
Wonderful experience!,This was on our list but with the coupon booklet we purchased at the aquarium we passed the line and entered quickly. Many things to see and acquire knowledge.
Diverse collection. Definitely worth it.,"It was an impromptu visit so we had to line up to get tickets. Thankfully, the line wasn't long at all.First, I want to point out that the building itself is quite beautiful and it is located near the Millennium Park, which is convenient for those who want to visit that as part of their Chicago travel list.The place is quite huge though and it will be difficult to see everything in 1 day (without rushing). So best to get a map and choose which collection you want to see and plan accordingly.What I love about this place is that it has a diverse collection. Yes, there are the Monet, Van Gogh, and other well known paintings by these artists but there are also other types of collections displayed. I was able to visit the floor where they had these Byzantine artefacts, another dedicated to medieval armour, and a photography exhibit. Be prepared to walk a lot. Also, there are eating places inside but they are quite small and don't serve a lot of variety in terms of food. For lunch, I ended up having the last can of rose and a muffin since that's all they had.Overall though, if you like art and history, The Art Institute is worth visiting."
Well Worth It,"The Art Institute of Chicago is fantastic. There is something for everyone. Also it is part of the City Pass which adds to its value. Of course, the iconic Impressionism exhibit is amazing! The modern art section is equally expansive. There are helpful docents positioned through the institute. They are knowledgeable and very pleasant; yet they do not hover or act condescending. We were only able to spend a couple hours viewing the great art. Beware if you are not an Illinois resident the ""Free Admission Day"" does not apply to you. This is a lovely amenity for residents. As an out of state visitor, you will need to pay admission. The good thing about the City Pass is that you go to the front of the line and receive the audio component."
Andy Warhol,The Andy Warhol exhibit was amazing!  Warhol was a very talented artist that used many vibrant colors to express his ideology of art.  I hope the Art Institute brings the exhibit back in the future.
What a beautiful experience ,Entering this place it’s like you are accessing history and art. I’m a lover of art and this place was huge. There is so many things to see. I am a little sad because I had to run to the airport so I couldn’t see 100% of it. If you are going make sure you spend at least 2/2.5h inside! It is worth to go!
Amazing Art Museum,"There is so much to see at this museum. Their impressionist collection is awesome!  Well laid out Museum, with so many beautiful paintings, sculptures, and other works of art."
Art Institute,Great place to visit. There is so much to see one can ever get enough of it. It is a must stop for anyone visiting Chicago.
JAM (Jobs at Art Museums).  💝Who Knew There was Special Attention Given to Students?👌,"High School and College Students, both undergrad and grad, are given a phenomenal experience to get the ""insider track"" on jobs and Internships, mostly volunteer.  On Saturday, February 15, 2020, top brass from the Institute and many employees contributed to a fun, fantastic, and informative day.  I quote ""Today is your opportunity to attend student-led gallery talks, enjoy and participate in a panel discussion with museum professionals, learn strategies for applying to positions at the Art Institute, and connect with museum staff and fellow students."" End of quote.  AI delivered what it promised.  I was moved almost to tears as one very young man described the healthchallenges that he would have to overcome in order to have a career.  Some of the participating University Partners were:  Columbia College of Chicago, DePaul University,   Lake Forest College, Malcolm X College, Northwestern University, and the University of   Chicago.  What an amazing and massive place.  I also learned that the Art Institute was rated one of the world's best museums in 2017, 2018, and 2019.  Last, but, not least I really like the print I purchased of George Seurat's, ""A Sunday on La Grande Jatte--1884."""
Must go,"What can I say other than YOU MUST GO TO THIS GALLERIE. Book on line and save the queing, & enjoy the show."
"So Much to See, So Little Time ","A fantastic museum to visit if you like the meandering kind of museum. Which I do. It is massive though, so definitely plan on spending a lot of time here, or plan on making more than one visit. My group was there for almost 4 hours, and we still didn’t get to see everything. And oh my the wonderful things you’ll see. My personal favorite was the statuary."
Not to be Missed,"I've lived here for many years, but just recently revisited the AI.  I had forgotten just how great it is.  What a treasure, even if you are not an art aficionado.  There's something for everyone.  And the building itself is a work of art.  If you see nothing else in Chicago, see this."
Sunday at the museum,Always a joy to visit and go on the guided tour..I managed to buy some lovely jewellery in the shop for friends
Iconic Museum,"The Art Institute of Chicago is one of the country's iconic art museums. Over the years, they have placed many of their most famous paintings in media, so they are familiar to a wide audience. The museum is too large to see completely in a day, so be ready for multiple trips to see it all!"
Great Museum,"I always wanted to go and glad I finally got it.  Saw so much more than I even intended to. Staff was helpful, exhibits where amazingly crafted and just an overall fun experience."
Top 10 must visit in Chicago,"The Art Institute is a fantastic way to spend a day (or two). If you think you might go more than once, it is definitely worth investing in a membership. We wanted to see Warhol and learned the lines were long, so we did a bit of research and decided we could come out almost even if we purchased a membership because tickets to the social exhibition were included. The museum staff are friendly and knowledgeable."
From Van Gogh to Pollock,In my opinion the Art Institute is one of the best Museums  in this country . Even  if you are a causal  art lover this is a must visit
One of the best in the world,Still one of my favourite museums in the world. Great collections and interiors. Will definitely come back next time I'm Chicago.
Another wonderful visit with old friends,I have been visiting this museum for more than 55 years and continue to excited by every visit.  Work is relocated from time to time creating exciting new adjacencies. The two rooms of 20th Century Arts and Crafts continues to be a favorite retreat from the busy impressionist galleries. Pause from time to time and simply sit on a bench contemplating a favorite.
Could have spent all day here,Some nice surprises of famous works that I didn’t know were here.  The guide section that highlights the “must sees” was very helpful
Rich experience ,So much to see. Worth the queues so check your coat and spend a good few hours to explore. Many famous treats and unknowns to find
Such a perfect selection of art,My favorite was the impressionist.  I did see one Picasso I have never see published before.  It was amazing.  Salvador Dali was breathtaking.
Superb collection,"One of the world's great museums. Particularly strong Impressionism, Post Impressionism, Modern, and Pre-Columbian collections."
Loved it!!!,Amazing! I have to go back. I wish I had the time to spend 3 days admiring all the art in one of the most important museums in the US. A place you can go back everytime you are in Chicago and never get tired.
One of the finest art museums in the world,"Great collection, and the exhibits are always interesting.  The Monets are some of his best paintings. Hard to see it all in 1 day though."
A Great Art Museum with With Some of the most Reproduced and Parodied Paintings in the World,"This is a big big museum. Like the Louvre or other great museums, it is impossible to really explore and enjoy the whole collection in one day. My approach is to make 3 decisions before I go. First, I check out what the traveling shows are and decide if I want ti see any of them or wait for the next featured shows to arrive. If my decision is to go, I pick a few periods in art history that I am most interested in seeing and, perhaps, even do a little research, Finally I make a mental list of my favorite artworks from past visits or from what I know about the institute. With this plan, I can make my visit fruitful, enjoyable, and not totally exhausting. Even with a plan, expect to spend a little time lost. because the museum has so many wings and isolated sections of floors, it is easy to get confused even with the map that the museum provides, Fortunately the guards are very helpful, do not be afraid to ask directions. Flash photos are not allowed and, especially with the traveling shows, some paintings will be marked with a camera and the familiar red circle with the line through it indicating that you cannot photograph. Carefully checking for these warning signs prior to taking a photo will help you to avoid a lot of embarrassment. In my view, the paintings that are the most popular are American Gothic by Grant Wood,  A Sunday on La Grande Jatte  by Georges Seurat, and The Night Hawks by Edward Hopper, and the Thorne Miniature Rooms. The whole impressionism and post impressionism collections are amazing thanks to Mary Cassatt and her encouraging the  museum to acquire works of Impressionist artists while their popularity in France was still at a low point. Even though I live 120 miles from the museum and only visit it once or twice a year, I have a membership. This allows me free and almost instant admission. Just avoiding the long line to enter and having the ""Member's Lounge"" for a quiet break is well worth the extra cost of being a member to me. It is possible to join on line. I recall once spending  about an hour in the museum to see just one show and, when leaving, noticed that a person who was at the end of the general admissions line, when I went in, was just getting up to the entry door (he was dressed in an odd bright red parka). I should add that there are food services in the museum. they do close shortly after lunch time so do not wait too long to eat if you intend to stay for the whole day."
Impression,Amazing collection od Impressionist artAlso visited the Bauhaus exhibit.  Beautiful building.  Wish I had more time
Experience Chicago's #1 Cultural Experience - The Art Institute,"Among one of the richest cultural experiences the United States has to offer. One of the very reasons Chicago is in the category of a world-class city. A must see for all ages, something for everyone."
Amazing Place,"Always a great escape to ancient, contemporary, and imagined worlds. Here, everyone will find some art that speaks to them."
Free in February,ILLINOIS residences enter for free during the month of February. Stop by and see some amazing miniature replicas of rooms from days gone by. Also a fantastic paperweight collection.
Free IL Resident Wednesday Night Visit,"Oh where to begin! The paperweight room was interesting, the miniature rooms are remarkable small scale works of art, the Andy Warhol exhibit was an extra fee-but worth the price of admission. Already looking forward to a return trip."
World Class Museum,"This is such a gigantic museum that a single day is hardly enough to see what you want to see - much less ""everything"" which would not be possible. Highlights of our visit were the Warhol traveling exhibit; the Thorne Miniature Rooms; Nighthawks by Edward Hopper; and so many more. Staff was professional and courteous"
Very interesting for Art lovers and looking Historic values,"One of must go places in Chicago and is great for art lovers,seeking historical importance. The three levels of the institute depicts art and sculptures from medieval to modern period, across major civilisations across the globe.The best thing for us though was the grand stairs followed by visit to the Fullerton Hall. Fullerton Hall - Held the world’s parliament of religions, 1893. Earlier know as the Hall of Columbus. It is generally closed, but they security allowed us in. Speech still could be felt when inside the hall.This was the most amazing and must go to for every Indian. $25 for general admission is probably worth it, by looking the grand stairs and Fullerton hall."
Must See for Art Enthusiasts!,"I am an art-museum nerd.  If you are too, don’t go through life without spending a day here...a full day.  And be well rested.  This place is enormous and covers 4 levels.   Go early in the day.  Only a few people in line at 11 am on a Saturday.  70+ in line when I left around 2.  If you’ve been to the Vatican or The Hermitage, skip the medieval wings.  Do NOT skip the modern art or, believe it or not, the armory.  My feet are killing me, but it was well worth it."
Windy city must visit place ,"Great museum! Incredible collection. Favorite place to visit. The old building is a Chicago landmark and the new wing is a great addition to it. Spacious and airy. A few unfortunate changes were made though, like: Mark Chagall's American Windows were moved and now are hiding in the back.. (but you must find and see!.). ""simian monkey"" disappeared.. but regardless,  the collection is just great ! And I think that everyone will be able to find something  to fall in love with!"
Outstanding collection,"Our two favorite art pieces in the world are here. A marvelous collection, beautifully displayed. But you can get lost in the galleries. Good that there are lots of helpful guards and info desks!"
Day at the Field Museum,I am from London so I am used to excellent museums but I must say I was very impressed with the Field Musuem. Fantastic dinosaur exhibit.
Don't miss the Art Institute!,There is so much to see here for all ages.  The newer modern wing is really interesting and the space is beautiful.  The special exhibits are outstanding- most recently they had the Warhol exhibit.  They have a dollhouse in the basement that is cool for younger kids.  So much art of all kinds from Monet to Asian treasures thousands of years old
Andy Warhol,Love the Art Institute. I manage to find something new every time I go there. We went to see the Andy Warhol exhibit and it was wonderful. Since we had my 4 yr old granddaughter with us we visited the Ryan Learning Center and she got to make her own art!
Great convenience,"Excellent experience,No waiting no lines  very efficient way to visit the local museum and to have a great time"
Fantastic museum,I visited the museum some time ago and was so impressed! Six hours went like seconds while browsing through the amazing collection. Would love to go back.
There’s a reason it’s world renowned...,Fantastic museum-gallery-institute.  Amazing exhibits that rotate.  Lines for tickets move quickly.   Nice happy staff.  Yes yes yes
Glad We Visited,"We visited The Art Institute toward the end of the Andy Warhol exhibit, so the crowds were insane.  Personally, we were not interested in that particular exhibit, so we did Skip the Line tickets to get in quickly and then meandered around at our own pace.  Was neat to see the few well-known pieces, as well as other lesser-known but equally beautiful pieces.I enjoyed it, except for two major disappointments:  1) the Prints and Drawings section was completely closed.  I assume this is where I could have seen some work by Old Masters; and 2) we felt lost most of the time, and we are typically good at reading maps.  Just found this museum to be very difficult to navigate, and brochure didn’t help much!  We ate lunch down in the basement cafe.  Food selection was good and we sat at the coffee bar and I had a latte with my lunch.  I recommend going just a little before the lunch rush to avoid the long line just to get into the cafeteria.  We got right in, but when we left, the line was all the way down the hallway.  Would certainly go back, especially if the Special Exhibit was of interest to me."
Visited twice to see it all....,We are art freaks so this was one of the highlights of our first trip to Chicago.  We went back and ended our trip here also.  We wanted to have this as our last day memory.  There is something for everyone here and a chance to see some original classics in person.  We also were there to see the Andy Warhol exhibit - interesting.  There is no way to pick out a few highlights because it was all amazing - including the building itself.  We had lunch here too which was a little touch of gourmet and delicious.This is a much visit for a day or two or three.....
One of the world's best art museums,"No matter what you're looking for, the Art Institute is likely to have a well-curated exhibit for you.  The modern wing is great, with an outstanding permanent collection and fine, interesting new work as well.  The current Bauhaus exhibit in the Modern Wing is very informative and an impressive collection.  The Impressionist collection is as good as in Paris.  The Thorne Rooms are a family treasure and should not be missed if you have children with you.  There's lots more.  Any scheduled tour or lecture you can catch is bound to enhance your experience.  The audio tours are well organized and very worthwhile.  There's even good food to be found in the cafeteria in the basement and in the coffee shop in the modern wing (snacks) and also an excellent restaurant on premises.  The gift shop is also top notch."
"Like the Norman Rockwell exhibit, don't miss the Gray exhibit","My sister is a suburbanite who dreads Chicago traffic and makes rare trips to downtown Chicago, usually by train. But she makes exceptions for the Art Institute of Chicago. She loves to visit each and every exhibition. So much so that, when she found herself frustrated by a long line at a recent exhibit, she bought a membership that allows for easy access. Good thing. She already is planning to visit the Art Institute to see the much ballyhooed Gray exhibit, which opened January 25 and runs to May 10. Richard and Mary Gray gave 56 drawings to the museum and promised to give 36 more, including works of some of the most celebrated artists of the past seven centuries--Peter Paul Rubens, Edgar Degas, Paul Cezanne, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock. Located at 111 South Michigan Avenue, at Monroe Street, the Art Institute is one of the great art museums of the world, a Chicago treasure. Buy a membership, take advantage of valet parking, take a lunch break in the restaurant, relax in the lounge, don't miss a thing. Among the highlights of the Gray exhibit: Picasso's 1933 ""The Artist and Model,"" a watercolor and pen and black ink; van Gogh's 1884 ""Avenue of Pollard Birches and Poplars,"" Wassily Kandinsky's 1914 ""Untitled,"" a semi-abstract watercolor, Francois Boucher's 1759-1761 ""Study of a Draped Woman Leaning on a Pedestal,"" white and black chalk, and Auguste Rodin's 1898-1900 ""Nude Woman Standing, Seen from the Back with Her Hands on Her Hips,"" a rare Rodin drawing in graphite with watercolor and pen and black ink with a light blue wash. There hasn't been so much excitement over an art collection since the Norman Rockwell exhibit. Don't miss it."
Stunning art collection!,"The Art Institute of Chicago is a world treasure.  What an amazing place and collection.  One could spend days exploring, tho if you take time to choose your galleries, I prefer going in depth at a few galleries per visit.  It is expensive, and parking can be awful.  But if you have a great local art museum, it may have reciprocal memberships available.  Try for good street parking in off hours.  Or the underground.  The modern wing and the American are breathtaking. Stunning sculptures.  Impressionism.  Shops.  The ancient greeks and asian galleries.  It is a lifetime experience!   Take a good bite every time you are near Chicago."
"Buy a membership! Sit in their lounge, then enjoy the exhibits and the restaurant...","A friend and I wanted to see the Warhol exhibit before it left, but were worried about the lines and the standing because I have bad knees. So I bought a membership, which got both of us in for ""free"" with no extra exhibit fee, and no fee for hanging up our coats, which is a great plus in Chicago. I entered through the Modern Wing, since I couldn't do the old entrance stairs, since there are Soooo many. Then I got to relax in the members lounge, and was delighted by the attitude of the staff there... Very friendly and welcoming. We ate at Terzo Piano, which was also charming with off-beat dishes to please the jaded palate, before heading to see Warhol. Should probably have gone to the exhibit first, as it was pretty full when we got there, but by hunt and peck I was able to see everything I wanted to see without having to follow the crowd. Lots of great items, and a wonderful overview of his long and varied career. Wish the gift shop had had more items... like a copy of the Marilyn they were actually exhibiting. Ah well. However, my phone was unable to produce a narrative as we went along, even though the app did load well. Just couldn't hear it. Would have loved a little brochure to walk around with... but I'm old and old school, so that's just me. Haven't been to the museum in decades, but will be back to see the Thorne rooms and the Armor exhibit when my knees are better. I would recommend not trying to see everything, but just cherry-pick and enjoy yourself. New feature of valet parking... which I like, but didn't open until 10:30, and by then, I had already parked."
Miniature Room Display is Amazing!,"My 17 year old son and I made a visit to the Chicago Institute of Art over MLK weekend. I didn’t have a particular goal in mind other than to introduce both of us to the world of art. We bought something like a Fast Pass on my phone when we got there and saw the line to get tickets was long. In 90 seconds I had a bar code in hand and we beat the line (it wasn’t much more than regular tickets-at least not for just two of us). With no particular goal in mind, we wandered downstairs from the main level to see a photography display, which was good. (I’ll save my comments about the miniature rooms on this same floor for later.) We went upstairs and on our way to check other things out, saw the unbelievably long line for the Andy Warhol exhibit-very glad neither of us felt compelled to see THAT! We saw a copy of his Marilyn Monroe on a building on Michigan Avenue across from the Starbucks Roastery, so that would have to suffice! We went upstairs and saw American Gothic, which I had only seen previously on commercials (I believe they may have talked on those 😄); Nighthawks; and a wide variety of other paintings and objects. I’m no expert, but I found their collection of household things which included chairs, a mosaic mantle, and beautiful silver pieces to be lovely and varied. Now, about the miniature room displays... these are like fantastical rooms you’d find in dollhouses of your dreams. A wealthy woman oversaw the creation of them using skilled craftsmen. They are SO realistic and beautiful. What we loved most was what you’d see when you looked through the doors or windows to the outside-so beautiful!(It doesn’t photograph well with a phone camera, unfortunately.) I loved seeing a very beefy guy with tattoos looking in one closely and then looking at his girlfriend with a look of awe. These aren’t just for women-anyone can appreciate them! The Art Institute is quite a gem. I highly recommend it, even if you’re not an “artsy” person."
Awesome,"Went for the Warhol Exhibit, which was exceptional.  I’ve been here a couple of times because their collection is extensive.No matter how your taste runs you should be able to find something that interests you and some things that may make you scratch your head ( I’m looking at you cubism)."
Spectacular.,I’m lucky enough to be able to say I’ve been to many of the best museums and art galleries in the world and this is up there with the best. Expect to give over two to three hours of your time to exploring this deceptively cavernous space filled with some of the world’s best art and antiquities. Make a day of it; you’ll not regret it. This has to be top of everyone’s list visiting the city: it’s everything.
The finest collection of art in the Midwest!,The Art Institute of Chicago is a MUST visit for literally anyone! You will be amazed at the amount of extremely famous paintings in their collection. And they have all types of art. From Renaissance to Modern to indigenous to full coats of armour! And there is a restaurant onsite and a lovely gift shop and a great view of Lake Michigan! Everyone should visit this place at least once!
Such a feast.,We spent two whole days viewing the art. It is a great place but not cheap to enter. The staff were very helpful and the café was also good.
Crowded but it should be,One of the best museums in the world.  Crowded on Saturdays.  Do yourself a favor and buy your tickets online or risk wasting 40 minutes in line.  Regular collections are amazing.  Staff is well trained and sharp.  Take your time.
Warhol exhibit,Saw the Warhol exhibit with family from Belgium. It was AMAZING. I forgot how much I enjoy gooing to the AI. Also had a coffee and snack at the little cafe. Prices reasonable and snack was delish. I will be back to see other exhibits. Such a great place to visit in Chicago!!
World Class,"In my opinion, this is the best art museum in the world, and I've visited many.  It's huge, so allow yourself plenty of time to visit and take it all in.  We were there for almost 3 hours, and it wasn't long enough.  And this is 3 hours with 3 teenagers!"
"Maybe the best Musuem in Chicago, and that says a lot","A trip to Chicago would not be complete without a visit to a pizza joint, chop house and the Art Institute of Chicago.  This place goes beyond ""world class"".  It is in a class of its own.  The name was poorly chosen as it indicates that this is solely an institute and not a museum.  What can you do now?  The depth and variety of exhibits is stunning.  There are original works of art you have seen in history book here as well as things you would never expect to seen in person.  There are some modern art pieces that I hope were donated.  They area not worth the cost of materials.  Only complaint.  See picture provided and have a talk with whomever procured it.  It's a absolute don't miss."
WORLD CLASS ART MUSEUM,"This collection of beautIful art draws visitors from all over the world for good reasons.  Collections feature items as diverse as American painting, Monet, Asian objects, renaissance armor."
Impresive!,"You can find art from Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh... it is huge and can take you a day but totally worth it"
Glorious art collections!,"The Art Institute is one of my favorite places to stop.  The collections are stunning, and the shop is fun too.   Good little coffee shop and a cafe downstairs.  The asian and Impressionist and modern collections are not to be missed.   The American and the fiber arts collections are really excellent  tho a tiny bit further from the central galleries.   There are shops at two ends of the buildings.   I have been pretty lucky finding street parking by going at slightly off hours.  And tho both the parking and the museum are expensive, the quality is worth it anyway.   If you buy a membership here or have an art membership with your home museum you will find you have made a great investment.  Look also for the miniature rooms, frank lloyd wright furniture, and Marc Chagall American windows."
Had to go back one more time...,"We went on a Saturday when we arrived and despite being packed we still enjoyed the Impressionist and Medieval collections greatly. The City Pass was a necessity to skip the very long line for tickets.I stayed in Chicago the entire week for week and planned another visit Wednesday night because there was still so much I wanted to see. Paying the additional admission was worth it. Got there just before 5pm and when I left at 7pm the line was out the door. Tips: The modern wing entrance seemed less busy. Plan your route, it is a huge place and hard to get to some areas so take a moment to have a plan. Coat check is nice but requires more waiting in line. So if possible try and travel light for your museum visit."
I need an entire day to myself...,I had never been here and went for the Warhol exhibit. I am considering flying back for the weekend to just quietly wander through every exhibit without interruption. That would be a dream.
Plan ahead for your visit to this world-class art museum,"Plan your visit! This world-class art museum is huge! With so many galleries, you could spend days here, so it's best to prioritize what to see.  On our recent visit, we saw the Andy Warhol special exhibition before visiting the American Art, emphasis on Georgia O'Keeffe (12 works on display in a single gallery!) followed by the Impressionism galleries (this museum has one of the best Impressionism collections in the country!). That took up the bulk of our 6 hours at the museum! On our last visit, we saw the Chagall windows and the reconstructed Chicago Stock Exchange Trading Room as well as their architecture and sculpture courts.  Who knows what we will focus on when we next visit! Be sure to take a map so that you know where you are going within the building. Also, re-entry to the building is allowed so you can go out for lunch or a take a break outdoors."
Visited Andy Warhol exhibition,"Huge institute you would need to spend a few days visiting here. Friendly staff, good selection of exhibits."
A modern art paradise,"This museum is defintelly one of the best in the world in terms of modern Europan art, I'd compare it to the Guggenheim or NYC Met.It is absolutelly a must for art lovers, worth at least a half day visit."
"Superb Building, fantastic glass copulas","Worth having a wander around, lots to see and do and a very nice Building. This is where you meet your Chicago greeter. It is opposite Millennium Park"
GREAT EXHIBITS / COMPLICATED TO NAVIGATE INTERNALLY,"HIGHLIGHTS:- We went for the Andy Warhol Exhibit, which is really well executed- Try buying your tickets online to avoid ques and lines (We failed to do this, and had to make a 15 min lane to but the tickets at the entrance)- The Museum has plenty of galleries, and is quite easy to get lost- Maps given to you (Only if you request them) are not user-friendly, and is easy to get lost in the Museum- I saw several people trying to understand where they were in the museum, and how to get to where they wanted to go- If you have limited time, it is super important that you identify in your map how to get to the exhibits you want to get to, otherwise you will spend a lot of time trying to find where those exhibits are, as mentioned the maps are quite complicated- Security is tight, which is really good in a museum of this level"
We Visited Two Days in a Row!,"While staying downtown and visiting family over the New Years holiday, we decided to stop by the Art Institute.  Because there were 6 of us and the Wharhol Exhibit was going on, we decided it was a good value to join the museum.  So glad we did!  My group consisted of myself and 5 young adults.  We split up and hit different parts of the museum.  We couldn't even begin to cover it in a couple of hours so we went back the next day for another couple of hours.  I loved everything about the Modern Wing and of course, the Impressionist Collection did not disappoint!.  We were able to hit the American Wing and the Warhol Exhibit as well.  Both amazing!  Over the holiday season, they display the Neapolitan Creche.  It's tucked away, but well worth seeking out.  The Thorne Miniature Rooms are delightful as well.  So much more to see, we can't wait to return.  Absolutely something for everyone!"
"10:30-5 daily, til 8 pm Thur/Fri","The building itself is stunning...then there's the art collection. So much to see here, buy a membership and see everything a bit at a time (plus get a discount in the giftshop). Free for children < 14, and Wed evenings for IL residents."
Art Institute amoung Best in world,The creations of many famous artists and sculptors is on display and the latest exhibit of Andy Warhol was quite illuminating.  There are so many fabulous works of art from across the centuries that one could spend an entire week there and still not see it all in depth.
Membership rocks!,"The membership was definitely worth the money.  It was great to ""fast pass"" the lines for the special exhibit. Be sure to go down stairs for the model house, paper weight and photography exhibits.  Unfortunately -- the coat check lines were super long at both entrances."
Fantastic.,You must visit this Chicago staple. They have been able to combine classic artists' work with modern art from America and around the world. Could easily spend all day there. Competent and courteous staff to help you if and when needed. Good times.
Nice,"There is always a line outside for admission so if you buy tickets online or you have a citypass it will be much faster to get in. The place is big, you can spend the whole day here. We arrived around 10:30 and left until it closed and still had some exhibits to see."
Fabulous as always ,Fabulous as always. We have been long standing members and we never cease to be amazed. The Warhol Exhibition was spectacular. If you have not seen it it will be around for a couple of more weeks and totally worth it. Get the app and hear the descriptions from the curators!
Strange things.....,"…have been going on here over the past few years, in that more decorative arts have been included in the European paintings galleries and the decorative arts galleries have been re-organised, and not necessarily in a good way. There is both far less to see and there is no depth in anything, no comparatives and far few pieces of minor arts, ceramics in particular. The Art Institute has impressively deep holdings of, for example, French 18thC porcelain, - St Cloud, Mennecy, Chantilly and above at Vincennes and Sèvres – hardly any of which is now on display. Their European metalwork as well is poorly represented, but do go back to the European paintings galleries to see some highlights. If this is the case with European arts, which used to be so well covered, what of the rest? Why are there no netsuke in the Japanese galleries? Where is the jewellery? So much time, energy and space is now devolted to contemporary objects – hardly art in any known way, things that are both inherantly ridiculous and ridiculously large that only daft museum directors would ever thing of having them, that ordinary, aspirational art lovers and collectors are completely frozen out of any idea of empathetic understanding. Note to director: show things that people understand and want to see."
A world class collection of art,"To do this place justice you need time, plenty of time. Not only is it a large area to cover, a large number of art styles, periods and histories to consider, but it also has some good cafes!  The primary focus of the visit this time was the Warhol exhibition which was superbly curated and very interestingly displayed. Be warned - you do need ot get tickets in advance and plan when to visit as it is extremely popular - they have boards saying from here it will will take 60 minutes, 30 minutes etc. before you get to the exhibition itself!  But it will be worth it.  I like some of Warhol's output but mainly i think he was a person who judged the moment and the business of the times perfectly and used his significant deign, art and business skills to maximum effect.  His popularity is well deserved.  However, I can spend far longer looking at the rooms nearby - Singer-Sargeant, Whistler and of course the masterful Hopper or the wonderful portrait entitled Americans Gothic.  they are truly inspirational and great.  I had seen the Impressionist collection on a previous visit and had wanted to see again but Warhol was clearly good enough to take up more of my time than I expected. Next time I am in Chicago I will revisit as it is a world class gallery. Highly recommended."
Always fabulous ,"The Art Institute is possible my favourite art museum I have visited.  I go every time I am in Chicago.  There is a huge amount there, not just paintings and sculpture.Despite its size and scope, it does not feel intimidating. The staff are friendly and informed.There are many greatest hits here, and you cannot miss the impressionist and American art collections on any visit.  The Chagall windows are a must too.It is a little expensive, especially when compared to the UK for their leading art gallery admission rates but it is worth it."
MM Good - the Andy Warhol Exhibit,The Art Institute of Chicago is a world class cultural treasure.  In addition to its marvelous permanent collection it is currently hosting The Andy Warhol Exhibit. The exhibit traces Warhol’s development from a commercial graphic illustrator to the countercultural iconoclast.  It points out the seemingly contradictory influences of what he saw as the unfair treatment of homosexuals and a strong Byzantine Catholic belief system handed down by his Slovenian parents.There were long lines but the museum staff did a good job in matching entries with people leaving the exhibit area.  The volunteers were exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable in giving directions and recommendations.
Totally worth it! ,"One of the best museums I've ever visited. The impressionist collection was my favorite: Van Gogh, Monet, Gauguin, Cezanne,... Also nice works from Picasso, Dali or Mondrian. The downside is that it's a bit expensive ($25) and if you want to visit the big exposition la you've to pay 7$ more.But I'd pay that again, totally worth it."
one of the worlds great art museums,"The Art Institute Chicago is one of the worlds greatest museums. Its collections cover centuries of art produced from around the world. It’s a big complex of old and newer galleries, learning center and cafes. Be prepared to walk a lot. Be sure to get a map at the information desk near main entrance. You will be lost without it.  Whatever your interest you are likely to find ample examples to view. Trying to see the entire museum would be exhausting. Its wise to preview the museum on line and pick the art you want to see. Then follow the map. My picks were the Impressionism galleries which house Seurat’s “La Grande Jatte” and they line up seven of Monet’s ‘Stacks of Wheat’ paintings. The Contemporary Gallery has a cubism section where you can see the differences between Picasso, Braque and others. At this gallery entrance is a magnificent Matisse ‘Bathers by a River”. If you go to see Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” expect a crowd. A hidden gem is the paperweight gallery on the lower level. You will be pleasantly surprised at the beauty of this largely unknown art form. They have valet parking at the modern wing entrance and nearest garage is underground at Lakeside and Millennium Park Garages"
Connection with history ,"Hard to explain ... the place is overwhelming, especially for one visit. However it is neat to view pieces that are so old and famous in person. If you are not an art person like me you would still enjoy it. Really a good value for the admission. Great that it’s free for kids under 14."
One of the best collections.  Must see it.,One of the best collections of impressionist. Strongly recommend to see these master pieces. Definitely worth of the money you pay for tickets.
impressionism and modern art bonanza,"monet, cezzane, van gogh .... impressive !chagall, picasso, dali - challenging and provocative the hall of artists goes on and on.warhol -- we got a free ticket and it still was not worth it, especially the glorfication of one of the greatest murderers of the 20th century (Mao)"
Fantastic visit to the museum (always great) and the Warhol exhibit!  Fantastic...,"Took our young adult sons to see the Institute for the first time, caught most all of the classics as well as the the Warhol special exhibit as well.  Great experience!"
A special place,I have been here before and always enjoyed it. this time we went for the Andy Warhol exhibit and it was very very good.
Amazing,"On a cold windy Chicago day there nothing better than spending a few hours here.The Warhol exhibition is a must.Some amazing stuff to see.Children under 14 are free for everything.Go early, it gets crowded later in the day.An absolute must!!!"
The Andy Warhol exhibit.,"Once again, we marvel about how our membership just makes any visit to the AIseamless. Going to the exhibit on New Years Eve was a good idea. There were no lines, and if you have the interactive app then you can just listen to the curators tell you about the best parts of the exhibition while using your own phone, which eliminates the need to rent anything.As always, the personal pride that we have in realizing that this fabulous museum is in our own city is sometimes a little overwhelming. How lucky we are😊"
Plan a day or several days,"The AIC has many famous pieces and customized tours to see the highlights through the app. The highlight for me is Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks, which has been in the collection since it’s first exhibit. I have visited twice and have only seen a fraction of what is exhibited. There’s a gift shop and a nice cafe in the modern art/architecture wing. It’s worth it to get a membership if you’re planning to visit more than once."
One of the best art museum in the US,"If you are interested in art then this is a must visit location while you are in Chicago.  There are 10 must see paintings which includes American Gothic, Nighthawks, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte and more.  I strongly recommend buying your tickets online to avoid the line to purchase tickets at the door.  They can be very busy on the weekend so I also recommend getting there when it opens.  You can get though much of the museum in about 3 hours, but it will take closer to 5 hours to truly see the entire place."
"An ""Essential Chicago"" site!",Seeing any featured exhibit here is like a journey into another world where timeless works of art are part of the landscape.We always come for a special showing but then linger to see our favorites like the Impressionists and the amazing miniatures in the lower level.The food / wine choices here are also very good which makes it a very special place to spend part of a day!
Evidently LOTS of people love art,"The place was crammed packed with a line out the door waiting to buy tickets, so do yourself a favor and buy online ahead of time. The line for the entrance from the park side was 10 people deep as opposed to the other entrance. The collection is amazing and the Andy Warhol exhibit was exceptional with over 400 pieces from sketches to MAO. Again, the place was packed. But worth it."
Art lovers delight,"Loved this museum. We were lucky that the Andy Warhol’s exhibit was there and we were able to see it. I believe it’s like $7 extra. It was amazing well worth it. Do get there early there was a 60 min. Wait when we where leaving! What a delightful place. A big collection of Monet, Van Gogh and even works by Picasso! There was so much to see that I will be back."
Amazing!!!,"I loved this place!! So many beautiful paintings and sculptures of extraordinary artists!! I could spend many days relaxing just sitting down in front of a Monet, a Kandinsky or a Rodin. I recommend to go prepare to spend the entire day, but even then it won´t be enough. So many marvellous art pieces to see, contemplate and admire."
Well worth visiting. ,"Make time to visit here when visiting Chicago, simple. Modern and Classic Art plus stuff you wouldn't expect like a paperweight collection."
Arms and Armor worth a visit,"I was so pleased to see the arms and armor collection at AIC finally reinstalled and delighting many young ones with the result, which is bright and beautiful. I was so happy with the storage/display cases, which really afford a close examination of the objects. A really nice addition to an already exceptional experience."
Warhol exhibit,"Great collection of Warhol art. Besides viewing popular Warhol pieces we saw some rarely seen videos, home movies, written correspondence, sketches & more. He was talented & conflicted. Shout out to all the employees & volunteers that helped us to locate different exhibits within the museum such as the  Neapolitan Crèche.  It’s a large building—wear comfortable shoes."
Chicago Must See,"If you like art, make sure you get to the Art Institute. Amazing collection ranging from modern to impressionist to textiles and furniture. Some of the most famous art pieces (mostly paintings) are here and at a minimum those are fun to see."
"Great collections, but you have to be rude to get a job here!","This museum has great collections of art, in particular Impressionist paintings and Art Nouveau/Arts & Crafts decorative arts pieces salvaged from Chicago buildings.  BUT, we were snapped at right away by a ticket seller who had a real attitude and should not be dealing with the public.  We also saw security guards yelling at people who got a little too close to art inadvertently (NOT us), and tour guides who were very rude to other museum goers.  We joked to ourselves that you need to be rude to get a job here.  We did briefly see two curators who seemed decent but who went past too close with a cart of priceless porcelain figurines.  I flattened myself against the wall in the hallway we were in as they didn’t give us a chance to step into another room and out of the way.  They seemed to be very rushed.  It really makes me wonder about the institutional culture....Little advertised is the arms collection.  There is a wonderful display of bladed weapons that traces the evolution of the fencing rapier from its earliest origins.  There are also significant pieces of armor that were very interesting.The building pieces were very interesting.  Located in a bright and airy stairwell area, there were large grills and windows with a brief history of where they were from.There is decorative art, including quite a bit of early American furniture and decorative porcelain pieces.  There is an entire room devoted to paperweights in the lower level.The paintings are the best known, with several Monets, some Renoir, several Degas, and Gauguin and Van Gogh.  There are lithographs in a long hall, and many other artists you’ve probably never heard of before.Prepare yourself for a somewhat unpleasant visit that is still quite worth the effort for the art."
Best Museum in the City,"So much fun, always something new to discover, excellent curated exhibits, and fantastic new features always coming. Highly recommend!"
Fantastic museum!,Loved our visit to this museum. We got a family pass so we can come back. Too much to see in one visit!
Very worth it!,"This place is huge and has some incredible pieces. The Thorne miniatures and Impressionists are must sees. You might consider a membership. The line to get in is a lot shorter and if there are two of you, it will more than pay for itself in just 2 visits. Since we were staying only 2 blocks away, we visited for short periods over multiple days. Much less overwhelming."
Ferris Bueller,The Art Institute is one of the best in the world. We went for the Andy Warhol exhibition and to see the picture that Cameron stares at in the film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. And there is so muc mhore here to see! Lots of great American art collections through out the years and also some great Impressionists. If you ever go to an Art Museum in North America... This should be it!
A No-Brainer,"The Art Institute doesn't need a review. Just go. It has one of the best art collections in the United States and, in particular, the greatest collection of French impressionists outside of France."
CIA is always fulfilling!,My mom and I go there at least once a year. I like to hang out in the room of Monet waterlilies & haystacks. The current Andy Warhol exhibit is excellent!
Always worth a visit,"The museum is huge and navigating it takes some time and patience. My recommendation is to develop a plan of what you want to see and take some time to map it out in the lobby before actually starting to walk the museum. If you have time for an extended visit or multiple visits then by all means wander around aimlessly being surprised by what you find. On our most recent visit we were able to enjoy the special Warhol exhibit. I'm not necessarily a big fan of his work, but you are able to see some of his most iconic works."
Best museum I’ve visited,"I often feel out of place at museums. Unless I’m interested in the subject matter I have a small attention span. However this place is huge, there is so much to see and the art is actually familiar. You’re not looking at it thinking it’s out of your depth; they have paintings which you will know. It was great and I could have spent hours there."
Always finding something new to see,I try to get to the Art Institute in every visit to Chicago. It is one of my favorite places in the world. One of the things I love most is I’m always finding something new to enjoy. This time it was the American Folk Art collection. I also have to visit the museum store for a few gifts.
Better than ever.,"I have been to this venerable institution several times but not in the past twenty years or so. My time was limited to a couple of hours but I could have taken a couple of days to see all of the exhibits. I was impressed by two paintings by an African-American artist (and Chicago native) upstairs in the same area as the famous Hopper ""Nighthawks"" painting. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name, but you will be struck by the vivid colors and vitality of the works and will know what I am talking about once you see them. There is something at this museum for everyone."
Excellent American Art,"Went on a Saturday near Christmas, busy but not packed. From the ticket/coat check at the beginning to every guard and guide throughout our three hour tour, everybody was friendly, hospitable, and informative. Sometimes hard to navigate between the two buildings (over the bridge over the railroad tracks), but the employees got us everywhere, one time by leading us there. Loved the early 20th Century French, American paintings. Good combination of furniture and art together."
Visit,We went 2 days in a row.  We spent 2 1/2-3 hours each day.  IMO opinion the only way to visit a museum.  If you spend 6 hours there you don't remember what you saw when you started your tour. This is a MUST when visiting Chicago.
Stunning Art. Good to get away from hustle and bustle of  Downtown Chicago,"I spent my adult work life in science but now that I am retired I try to expose myself to art (visual, musical, theatrical) and the Art Institute of Chicago really hit the spot.  The Warhol special exhibit was wonderful and walking through the main exhibits allowed me to experience different worlds of art up close and personal!  I visited the museums in NYC and Paris recently and this one compares well to the best in those cities."
Enjoyable visit,We visited the museum to see the Andy Warhol exhibition but the museum has a wide range of art particularly Impressionism
Wow!,"Iconic works of art. My whole family loved seeing the collection, particularly the Impressionist section which is amazing!  It sounds funny, but we also enjoyed the gift shop - it has an impressive variety of items that depict some of the more famous pieces from the museum. Overall, the Museum is a must see if visiting Chicago."
Andy Warhol,"Of course the Institute of Art is amazing.Go see Andy A to B and back while you can, it’s so detailed and even I who’ve met him was excited by all the information and selection.Bravo to the staff and administration that put it too"
Most amazing art museum ever!,My girlfriend Terri brought me to the art museum! I did not want to leave! We spent the entire day. It was epic! There was so much to see! So much history in the art! It was a dream come true. I will be returning!
Warhol!,"Skip the line!   The online system works well.  Don’t spend 30 minutes waiting for tickets.  Walk right in and enjoy a compelling Warhol exhibit.  It presents his range very well - advertising, portraiture, exploration of violence, eroticism, and his many skills in film, silk screen, painting.  For those of us of a certain age, much was as pointed reminder of the times that he engaged - Jackie, Mao, Elvis, etc.  The final major work on the Last Supper is worth contemplation.  Is it summative of a life?While you are there don’t miss some of the iconic works - Picasso’s Old Guitarist is one for me."
Don't Miss the Current Warhol Exhibit,"Much of Warhol's work seems driven by an obsession - a reverence, almost, for larger-than-life personae, whose fame is the primary qualifier for his attention. And to be the subject of a Warhol work is, of course, to cement one's place among the ranks of the forever famous. As we view his art, we become more aware of the ways in which commercialism informs modern life and, in the process, we gain insight into the forces of attraction and repulsion churning in our subconscious and shaping our response to the barrage of stimuli we face each day."
An Artist’s Heaven,We’ve been members off and on for some time. This place if you are an art major has many renowned pieces that you would have studied in art school. All of the classics are here along with many contemporary artist. The current exhibit is Warhol which is not our favorite but it’s a good display of his works. The best value for a family is to get a membership. It’s worth it if you’re local and it’s a tax write off as well. Take advantage of the members lounge and an extra 10% off anything in the shop. It really is my favorite art gallery next to the Louvre.
Good Museum of Art,"Excellent service and big museum with a lot of things from America, Asia and Europe. Cafeteria and Shop with good service"
Impress,"The museum is a must. Don’t miss the miniatures downstairs. The “skip the line” cost, to me, is worth it because it eliminates any possible delay."
Good variety.,"The miniature inside house displays in the basement were fun...and made me double check what I knew about those various historical eras. We enjoyed the paperweights...such amazing art work.  My favorite place was art from the Americas and Africa. The artifacts were well cared for and well researched  . I was sad to see them put so far away in a small galley, as if they had less importance that the Oriental displays. Eventually we will discover the importance of this artwork and have more understanding of its uniqueness."
Great museum ,We visited this as part of our city pass package. It was great as we got to skip the line at the entrance. We arrived at 10:15 (it opens at 10:30) and their vast collection is astonishing will definitely come back to explore more as 4 hours is not enough. But had a good time overall
Worth the Purchase,Defintely reccommend esp. on a busy day.  The line was very long as there was a popular exhibit at the museum.
LOVED IT! - Even with kids ages 7 and 10!,"We visited the Art Institute of Chicago as a family.  Our kids, ages 7 and 10, really enjoyed the following items: The Thorn Miniature Rooms, the knights in armor, A Sunday on La Grand Jate, The Bedroom by Ban Gough, Monet's wheat series, etc.  We gain entrance to the museum using the Chicago CityPass.  This allowed us to have free audio tours as well, which were SO much better than wondering on your own.  Checked bags are a dollar per bag - so worth it!  Loved our visit!"
As Good as It Gets,This is an exceptional museum on every level (although it is not that easy to navigate!).  We were particularly impressed by the American Art Collection.  The Chagall windows are not to be missed.  And the miniatures collection was quite fun.  We did NOT leave ourselves enough time – I would suggest 4 hours minimum – and did not attempt to do the Warhol exhibit (having seen plenty of Warhol in other museums).  Parking tip:  Downtown Chicago is incredibly pricey but we purchased an advance reservation through Best Parking at the Grant Parking Garage that was quite reasonable.
Select evenings free for Illinois residents.,I spent most of my time on the Impressionism collection.  I walked quickly through the Islamic collection.  I also looked at the Tapestries.
World class museum,"Hopper's ""Nighthawks"", Wood's ""American Gothic"", Seurat's ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"", Rembrandt, Picasso, Monet, Manet, Renoir, Lichtenstein, El Greco, Delacroix, Degas, Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gaugin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Homer, Modigliani, and, as a bonus, Albright's 1945 painting of the Picture of Dorian Gray. What's not to like?"
On our To Do List,"Spent a wonderful afternoon at the Art Institute with my sister.  We are both lovers of the Impressionist artists.  The paintings available at the Institute are varied and many I have not seen before.  Monet is my favorite but I also love Renoir, Cezanne, Van Gogh and others.  So delighted to be able to wander through the galleries and see such treasures.  Love the gift shop.  Lots of variety and price points.  Was able to pick up a few Christmas gifts.  Fresh evergreen garlands on the stairs provided an amazing scent as you walked through.  So happy we made the time to visit."
Gift Shop,I like the Architecture Used to be a member. Have been coming here since 1990 since my Friend took me here and Marshall Field's
Museum Visit,"As first time visitors, the staff was great at making sure we got the most out of our visit.  A large variety of exhibits and some of the great classics were there to view.  Highly recommended stop in Chicago."
Weekday Visit,We walked up without advance tickets at opening time on a weekday. There was a line but it moved fast. The exhibits were inspiring. The layout can be confusing but that's minor. This was our first visit and we were blown away.
Andy Warhol Exhibit,"Excellent!  Don't pass it up.  Awesome museum in a great part of the city.  Great place to spend the better part of a day.  Can walk from Water Tower Place in about 25 mins.  Very well organized. Be sure to get tickets on mobile device with fast pass, especially on weekends."
One of the best Museums in the World.,This is the second visit for my husband and myself. We never get tired of seeing some of the best collections in the world.I also highly recommend taking one of the free tours offered by the Art Institute of Chicago. The docents are so knowledgeable and really make the visit special.
One of the main reasons we came to Chicago,Did not disappoint.  Amazing art that I have wanted to see in person for such a long time.  The best part was that it not overwhelming.
Top notch museum,"This was my third visit to the museum and I had forgotten how much I loved it. So many incredible works of art all in one building. Definitely get a map, that's the only way to find your way around. I also recommend going early because the lines seem less earlier in the day. I did not purchase the skip the line tickets because I didn't think it warranted a $10 upcharge so if you arrive early you should be fine."
Saturated With Recognizable Art,"It’s impossible to digest the massive concentration of famous pieces in this huge collection. Rather than speed through half the galleries in three hours, next time I’ll pick just a few and enjoy them at leisure. Absolutely worth the $25 admission."
"Great collection, wonderful staff","We visited the day after Thanksgiving and the place was packed.  We waited quite a while to get in, and I observed the staff at Admissions smiling at everyone, despite some small bits of visitor impatience.  The Art Institute has a wonderful collection, and it is quite accessible.  The guards and guides are very helpful."
Spend the day... beyond worthwhile ,"Warhol, American Gothic, Chagall, Picasso, Impressionists. Must must must go see the Thorne Miniature Rooms... spectacular. Make a reservation for lunch at the museum. Must visit while in Chicago!"
One of my favorite art museums in the US,"Great collection and some amazing works of art. There is so much to see, that you will need to visit several times to get a fully satisfying experience. None the less, even short visits are memorable and well worth the price of admission"
"Busy, Beautiful Art","We loved the current Warhol exhibit!  Seeing it was a great way of getting out of the weather and seeing wonderful classic Warhol paintings. After our early tour of the Warhol special exhibit, we toured the remainder of the museum for a great comparison of art through the ages."
A required trip,Every time I go to the Art Institute I feed my soul.  I have a route I almost always take.  The Impressionism galleries are remarkable; only the London Museum equals it in my experience.  It’s well planned and the one museum I would choose this one if forced to only do one of the museums.
Very nice stop in Chicago,"We went to the art institute after already visiting a couple of other museums. It was very nice, however laid out a little strangely. Would recommend."
Andy Warhol,I have been there for the Andy Warhol exhibition which was really nice. Together with the phone app and audioguide it was a great experience. The rest of the museum is also worth a visit.
"Fantastic, Big Museum with lots of Gorgeous Art","The museum is very big so I would suggest at least spending a full day here if you want to get your money's worth and see all of the beautiful pieces on display. There is also a cafe inside and two big retail shops where you can buy souvenirs, books etc. If there is a special exhibition going on (I saw ""30 Years of Warhol"") go for it, these are well put together and enjoyable."
Must-go @ Chicago,"It’s a wonderful place. If you have time, just go there and see. The exhibition is great and the architecture itself is also amazing."
One of the best art museums in the country,"Plan on spending lots of time here. With multiple levels and lots of special exhibits, this museum does not disappoint. And, if you get there in time to see the special Warhol exhibit, pay the extra $ and go. It is excellent!"
"Interesting, Clean, Not awesome if you don't appreicate art","Myself and a group of my friends went on fall break and I liked that they held your stuff for $1 per item, however I'm not that into art so it wasn't all that fun for me. It goes on for ages and you could honestly get lost, the mini rooms in the basement were the coolest thing to me, oh and the paperweight section!"
Loved the Andy Warhol exhibit,"The Art Institute has floors and floors of fabulous paintings and pottery, furniture, jewelry, you name it, they have it. Th bonus feature for us was the Andy Warhol exhibit. Thank you for housing such treasures."
Art Institute of Chicago,Best art museum in the world.  Go see it.  Really good modern art section as well as a good section of impressionist paintings.  Entry through the modern side usually has less lines for entry.  GO.
Mother/Daughter trip,Our entire family loves coming to the Art Institute.  There is so much to see for everyone; from the miniatures to modern art. Each of my adult children have artists  or genres that are favorites and we always get to them all. This trip was for my daughter and myself and we had so much fun seeing new exhibitions as well as our favorites.
Wow!,"Recently visited this extraordinary facility which was hosting an Andy Warhol exhibition. While this in itself was worth the entrance fee, the selection of paintings by Monet, Picasso, Renoir amongst others was a bonus to put it mildly. We spent a few hours there but in reality only viewed a fraction of the exhibits. There appears to be something for everybody. Superbly located near Millennium Park. A must visit !"
One of the great art galleries of the world,"Second time I've been here. It's a wonderful place, stunning range of art works in a beautiful building. And wasn't too busy on a mid-week morning, but that may be due to the cost of entry - USD 25 plus another USD 2 for the cloakroom! Our great museums/art galleries here in the UK are free but I realise that's unusual these days. Just wish it opened earlier - lots of people milling around on a freezing November morning waiting for it to open at 10:30.But highly recommended."
Great Accessible Museum,We enjoyed an afternoon meandering through this eclectic but world-class museum.  It's set conveniently in the center of downtown and offers a variety of exhibits.   Well worth a visit.
World Class in Chicago ,The art institute is a joy every time we walk through this sacred institution.There is no greater education and stimulation than a three hour visit with the masters and lovely lunch on the third floor.
Andy Warhol! Wow!,"I didn't have a great appreciation of the work of Andy Warhol prior to my visit to the exhibition at the Art Institute but I felt like I had a much better understanding of his art through the thoughtful presentation at  the Institute. We also toured the Bauhaus exhibit which was interesting, perhaps more so for engineers and architects. For anyone interested in impressionists - it's always a treat to visit that gallery."
A Must-Visit When We're In Chicago,"We made a trek to see the Andy Warhol exhibit it on Nov. 26, 2019.  I love this place so much; it's a two or three day event for me to cover it thoroughly.  Exhibit is great!"
IF YOU ARE INTO ART MUST SEE!!,"This is one the best art museums I have ever visited!  Download the Audio app (it's free) to get a sort of tour experience. If you are Active Duty, you are free. If you bring your family members or they come solo they are paying full price, unless between Memorial Day and Labor Day.Not best place for kids under 10, unless they are quiet and like to just look at stuff. This is is typical Art Museum (look, no touch). I will say that this is good for couples, even if other person is not artsy, the variety of exhibits is amazing!Coat check is also $1. There was a separate special exhibit (Andy Warhol for $8). Parking is EXPENSIVE, I should have looked online and reserved instead of just using Google Maps. I heard people even found Groupon deals?!?If you get a chance swing by 3rd floor, AWESOME VIEW OF CHICAGO SKYLINE! The museum is large and there are quite a few exhibits. I had a hard time orienting myself with map, the map on phone app was way better (pictures).  The gift shop is okay, but it has great book selection in back and a bunch of the postcard booklets. They also have nice T-Shirts ($25) and jewelry."
Amazing Collection ,I have to admit that collection is huge and amazing! You can spend whole day in this Museum... Extremely high recommended!
Impressive,Excellent gallery with a lot to see.  We did free tour of the highlights though I'm not sure I’d have selected the same highlights.  Lots to see and you need more than one visit unless you’re particularly fit.
Super Art Gallery,"This is the best art exhibition in Chicago. They have a wide collection of art from the past to the present. It takes the entire day to be here, so be prepared. Staffs are everywhere to help guests find specific a collection. Price is above average but definitely worth the money for art lovers and fans."
Excellent museum and collection ,"I spent a lovely day at the art institute yesterday, and was very impressed with the variety of their collections, if one display doesn't appeal then another surely will. As with a previous visit to New York's Frick museum, I was amazed to be standing before such beautiful works by artists I'd heard of long before I could view their works.Very comprehensive bookshop/giftshop, once again you're very hard to please if unable to find the perfect item for you, family or friends.Highly recommended."
Fantastic!,Must visit when you go to Chicago. May not be interesting for kids below 8. Fabulous collection of art and well laid out. Also loved the Andy Warhol exhibit which was on in November 2019.
Andy Warhol,This was a great visit and even our teenagers enjoyed it. Walking distance to so many other things. What a great resource to have in the Midwest
Amazing,I’m not an art buff but this was outstanding. Very informative and enlightening. You can easily stay for 3-5 hours.
Spend a day at Chicago’s Art Institute,"There is so much to see in the many rooms of this historic gallery. Art is well spaced and there is much variety. We were fortunate to be there for the Andy Warhol exhibit, which ends in January 2020. The Institute is easily walkable from downtown hotels."
Excellent! (even if you're not into Art),I fell in love with Art after visiting this museum. I loved every minute! We spent 2 hours at the Art Museum and it was still not enough time.
Amazing!,"This museum was absolutely awesome. Especially, the exhibition about Andy Warhol was very interesting. But also in general, the museum is definitely worth a visit!"
One of the great American museums ,"The Art Institute of Chicago is one of the must-see places to visit when in Chicago. In addition to some amazing exhibits, consider having lunch at one of the three cafes."
One of the best art museums in the world,"Great, great Impressionistic paintings.  Museum was started when they were inexpensive.  Modern art is just as good.  I’m not a fan of the Old Masters, but they are well represented.  Do not miss the Chagall wall.You cannot do the Museum in one day, so be selective.Best time to visit, Sunday afternoon - when the tourists fly home."
Magnificent ,We had a fabulous day here. The day Just vanished; we lost ourselves in the beauty. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.
Nice way to spend an afternoon,"I had some time to kill before heading to the airport so I went to the institute.  They had Andy Warhol exhibit going on which was very interesting.  However, the special exhibits they have are additional charge on top of the $25 adult entrance fee.So much to see, all the great masters and modern pieces.  They also have a lot of artifacts, furniture, sculptures and other period pieces."
exhibit,"The building is phenomenal as are the cafe, gift shop and members coffee shop.  I could spend a month going thru the different exhibits and still not see everything.  Great - Great - Great!!"
Make your eyes happy!,"I go to Chicago fairly regularly and never leave without a visit to the Art Institute. The space is gorgeous, the permanent collection is stunning and the changing exhibitions are always interesting and well-curated."
One of the best in the world!,"We like visiting art galleries, and have been to many, around the world. The Chicago Institute of Art is one of the very best. It’s collection is enormous, both in number and in variety.  If you like art, give yourself plenty of time to see as much as you can. Beautiful light and airy building, paintings well presented and an excellent restaurant (Piano Renoir’s)."
1 of the best.,Wow!  World renown artworks galore in the original building and the Renzo Piano designed new modern wing.  You can enjoy this and Millennium Park at the same time.  See 2 of the treasures.
Escape from the cold.,"Having walked from our hotel, down to Millennium Park in November, it was a wonderful escape from the cold for the warmth of the museum.Vast, yet not cold and great exhibition of  European artists, some whom we’ve not seen in the UK and European museums. Great American artists, especially the American Gothic, lovely art from Mexico, photography section and exceptional separate exhibition of Andy Warhol.Great experience."
Fascinating,I used my city pass bought in advance which I would highly recommend as I believe the waiting can be long at times. I could spend hours in this place and thoroughly enjoyed my time
Something for everyone in a beautiful space.,"The Art Instute of Chicago is a vast, intriguing, provocative museum that has something for everyone.  They have art from all eras, ranging from Impressionism to contemporary to  African art.  There is a neat medieval renaissance exhibit tucked in a back corner with horses, armor, and weapons. . There was a gorgeous collection of Middle Eastern and Muslim fabrics, jewels, and artifacts on display while we were there.  There are also sculptures, Greek art, oriental art, Indian art.  There is something for everyone.  There are also really good audio tours.  This is part of the Chicago City Pass, which is a great value:  the art museum, Hancock and Willis tower, The science museum, the planetarium, etc.  This museum is a must do."
Excellent cultural option in Chicago,"Very comprehensive museum, artworks from all over the world and diverse periods. You will see from a Van Gogh to African art. If you like museums, plan a whole day. Spent 4 hours and could not see half of it."
Wonderful,A must do!  Such a beautiful collection.  Love this place.  The only draw back is the line but get there early to avoid the crowds.
Great way to spend the day,Fast pass was super convenient.  So much to see with a fairly broad sampling of styles.   We didn’t utilize the audio tour and still enjoyed it very much Bear in mind that the cafes are small and crowded on the weekends and during peak times so plan accordingly.
"Impressionism, Warhol, and historical art period of war.","I grew up in Chicago and studies art history so the Art Institute was my playground. The museum offers many art forms: paintings, statues, sculptures, photographs, and other media. Having seen a special Monet exhibit in Denver, Colorado made me want to revisit the Impressionism gallery in Chicago. Surprisingly, there is a limited Andy Warhol exhibition show there. Such a great opportunity to visit a world class museum, and the Art Institute is a gem!"
art overload,Amazing! Andy Warhol exhibit was a must see! Would go back if I could. More to see than you can in one day
So Much to See,"Plan a full day here, this place is massive. I'm not an art museum guy, but the Andy Warhol exhibit made me cave in to my wife's wish to visit, and I was really impressed with that, as well as the rest of the gallery. I don't even know if it would be possible to see it all in one day, we certainly didn't, you have to pick your spots, I particularly liked the impressionists and the early European, worth a visit."
Incredible pieces,"The Art Institute is a vast museum, with a lot of rooms to visit, but everything is worth it. The collection of impressionist paintings is simply incredible."
"Through Jan. 26, 2020, the Andy Warhol exhibit is reason to visit (again)","The Andy Warhol exhibit ""From A to B and Back Again"" is one of the best special exhibitions I've seen in some time at the Art Institute. It is large enough to feel important, but not so large as to take up an entire visit. The exhibit costs an additional $7 over the price of admission. Go before lunch during the week to enjoy the lightest crowdsThe audio guide is also highly recommended. You can rent a device onsite or download the latest (turquoise) app and listen on your phone with earbuds for free. The descriptions by curators and fellows provide helpful and fascinating context. Even if you think you know Andy Warhol and his iconic works, I think you will come away with new insights and a deeper understanding. The phone app also works for some artwork outside of the exhibit. There is a fine dining restaurant in the Modern Wing with views of Millennium Park, but I prefer the multi-station cafe in the basement where there is something for everyone in a pleasant well-designed space overlooking the courtyard. The AIC has two gift shops that are different enough to warrant spending a few minutes in each."
Definitely worth a visit!,"We loved the Art Institute of Chicago.  I am not a huge art lover or expert, but the collection contained so many works from well-known artists that it was quite exciting to be there and see them in person.  We were there for three hours, and we had a top 10 list of pieces that we wanted to see.  It's best to go with a plan rather than go in there and wander around.  It's a huge exhibition and you need to plan to use your time wisely otherwise your feet may give out before you have seen all that you want to see."
Great museum with lots to see,The art was wonderful and our lunch in the 3rd floor sit down restaurant was wonderful! The miniature rooms would be fun for all ages!!
Must Visit in Chicago,"Having been to art museums all over the world, Chicago certainly hold its own. Small enough to visit in a day, but gig enough to offer something for everyone."
A privilege and pleasure,Please allow sufficient time to see everything. We were there for just an afternoon and had to select the displays and exhibits to see. 3 floors.  Several cafes through out for food and relaxing. Probably should watch what time of day you arrive. Look at their guide for peak times. Open late on Thursday.
Not since 1966,"My first time, I visited the Institute in 1966 on a junior high field trip. Decades later, it did not disappoint. We went on a Saturday, and so it was very crowded. There are helpful people who approach you in the special exhibit line and explain that if you want to be members, you can apply your ticket purchases to the membership and skip standing for an hour. My two guests can drive to Chicago from their home, so we did that. There is a LOT to see, and I couldn't manage it all in one day. I was especially glad that Degas' The Little Dancer bronze was there under a lucite/glass cube. I had never seen her up close and personal. There were several impressionists' works, and the special exhibit was Warhol's--quite a variety of his works: film, drawing, the Marilyn and Troy Donahue diptych, the assembly of Brillo boxes. Some graphic nudity (if you are taking little ones, be prepared...) In the lower level we saw the Depression Era photography and the wooden floor squeaked and squeaked constantly. There are drummers outside in the freezing cold and I felt their rhythm all the way into my bones--very loud. I'm sure that it helped them keep warm!"
"We had only about an hour, but decided to visit the Art Instit","We had only about an hour, but decided to visit the Art Institute anyway, amd I am glad we did. The museum is expansive, with a wide range if bright spacious galleries that easily handle large crowds. The impressionist gallery has a significant collection of Monet - the largest I have seen outside of Paris. We walked though the special exhibit of Andy Warhol. Although not my favorite genre, the exhibit was well done. Art enthusiasts should definitely visit this museum."
Always worthwhile.,A trip to Chicago is not complete without a stop at one of America’s finest art collections. Just the large Surat is worth the admission.
Great experience.  This Art museum has more significant works than I expected.,This was a good experience and was impressed with the expansiveness of it.  Good exhibits.  Liked the variety.  Good set of Picasso and Monet.
A must,"One of the US best museum. A great collection of different eras, great masterpieces and amazing temporal exhibits. Plan for at least three hours to see the highlights. Plan ahead the rooms you are more interested in visiting. Tip: download the app and get comments on the most important pieces."
Chagall's windows are a MUST,"Quite complete and well presented museum, some unique items like Chagall'sMy tips: 1) save money do not buy neither the pocket guide (my wife bought it because is the only guide in foreign languages) nor the audio guide. If you want a nice guide to refreshen your visit back home, the ""essencial guide"" is ok, not cheap but worthy 2) while queuing download the free app, it has all you need and FREE. the only but is that it's ""GPS"" is somehow clumsy in order to properly guide you around but there are plenty of help desks with people that will easily route you3) Back packs are not allowed and each item you store will cost 1 usd, raincoat and backpack = 2 usd (must be paid with the entrance)"
One of the best museums in Chicago,The art institute has so much to see. The miniature rooms and impressionist paintings are my favorite things to see when I visit. Chicago residents can get discounts which is great. Last time I was there we saw the Andy Warhol exhibit which was cool and interesting to learn about him as an artist.
Wonderful museum,We didn't have enough time to really enjoy this beautiful museum - but the fast pass Admission we purchased earlier really helped - we got there just as busloads of school kids pulled up. I'd love to back to the museum and spend many many hours.
The Impressionists ,"Well worth the stop when visiting Chicago. The building itself is a point of interest with an excellent collection of impressionist paintings. Make the time to peruse the full collection, especially with the help of an audio guide."
Always a delight.,Picturesque surroundings and an impeccable permanent collection. The special exhibitions never disappoint either. Truly a gem in the city's cultural crown.
This needs a review? Seriously?,Come on people if you don't know The Art Institute of Chicago is on of the world's finest museums of art you must be living under a rock. If you do no more than stand in front of Pablo Picasso's Blue Guitarist and feel the chill run up your spine you have gotten your moneys worth. But not to worry there are always special exhibits in addition to the world class regular collections.
Worth the flight,"I hate to fly, but didn't want to drive to my hotel in downtown Chicago, so I took the plunge and flew and Ubered  to my hotel.  I did this just to go to the Art Institute, and it was worth the anxiety!  The museum has so many wonderful collections that I didn't get through them all in one trip.  I plan a spring visit (with flying) that will include another full day at the museum--it's world class."
Wonderful but crowded,A world class collection but crowded and relatively expensive.  Go early to avoid crowds?  The neighborhood is full of interesting places to explore too.
Incredible experience,"What an incredible experience exploring one of the top art institutions in America. I had the opportunity to take my family to visit The Art Institue of Chicago, and what an experience it was. The amount of art and history curated and displayed is immense but awe-inspiring, and definitely worth visiting. If you are in the Chicago area, even for a weekend, you need to take a trip to the institute and spend a couple of hours exploring all the displays."
Absolutely a Must Do!!,"Absolutely stunning and a world class experience. If you are going to Chicago for a number of days, buy a membership and go for a few hours the first day and then go back a few days later for everything you missed the first time. You can’t possibly see all that you want or should in just a few hours. Everywhere you look is yet another masterpiece!!"
Beautiful in all ways,Great collections from Dutch masters to modern. This museums was great when I visited as an adolescent but even better today especially with the new modern wing. Budget two hours and that is not nearly enough time.
A Chicago Must See,"One of my favorite places in Chicago,  the history and artistic beauty is overwhelming.   From Egypt to Americans to European classics and masters.Also some strange things, like snow globe and Norwegian tea set collections.  So much to see here.Don’t miss it,  park in Grant Park South Garage and you will come up to street level across the street (about a block away)"
Amazing,"We spent about three hours here and only saw about 20% of the museum. It is huge! We attended the Andy Warhol exhibit, then used the museum brochure to hit the highlights. World class!"
The Best museum,"The Best museum of Chicago, with great exhibits, even if you aren't fan of the art, you're gone love it. Came whith time because the lines are big. General admission $25 usd"
Come for the Masterpieces Stay for the Special Exhibits,"Certainly one of the top art museums in the world.  It is truly fabulous with easy access to many of world's masterpieces.  Be sure to wear your walking shoes.  The museum is huge and probably not the best place to show off those fancy new Jimmy Choo's (though he might even have a place here some day).We have been members here on and off for years.  It really pays if there is just one of the special exhibits you want to see.  There have been many for us over the years.  Most recently we went to see the Warhol exhibit.  If you have a chance it is really terrific.  Even if you are not a fan it is worthwhile.  I learned so much from the exhibit.  But here lies my little beef.  Now, you can listen to the audio guide through the app (no extra charge).  Unfortunately I don't think they have the kinks worked out of it yet. Four of us went and we all tried to use it.  Three gave up. I persevered and finally got the hang of it about half way through.  Even then it wasn't perfect.  It was difficult to navigate through the audio in order and also listen to the special numbered exhibits which required you get out of order on the audio map.  Software needs some work."
Art Institute,"While a small museum, it has an amazing collection and should not be missed on any trip to Chicago.  It is also centrally located and so can be part of a great day out.  Buy your tickets before you come as the ticket lines are long and poorly managed."
November 2019,What a fabulous place to visit. We were fortunate to see the Andy Warhol exhibit. Learned so much   Developed more respect for his numerous talents
Great temple of art,"Magnificent collection of paintings. Hopper's  Nighthawks, Woods' American Gothic, Seurat's Grande Jatte... and some teenage memories of Ferris."
Warhol Exhibit,We went to the Art Institute specifically to see the Special Warhol Exhibit which was quite large and interesting.  Loaded with political commentary and famous Warhol images.We also took in The Impressionist Wing which is extensive and a highlight of the trip to Chicago.
SICK AND TIRED OF EXHIBITS ON IMPRESSIONISTS,"In order to make money, the Art Institute organizes at least one exhibit on an impressionist per year. This year we'll get two, one on Manet and the second on Monet. This happens every single year. They count on selling t-shirts, umbrellas, etc. The Art Institute shows a very provincial and narrow-minded attitude toward art history. There would be so much to show, and instead we get these phony exhibits."
Stunning art museum.,"We went to see Edward Hoppers works, but there is so much more. You need a day. At least. And now the Warhol exhibition is on! Go now!"
andywarhol,it was a real fun exhibit and it was really enjoyable. after visiting the warhol exhibit went on to see the great paintings.  there is always something interesting to everyone and you can not get bored.
Andy Warhol Retrospective is Spectacular,"Compared to the first Warhol retrospective mounted 30 years ago by the AI, this show dives deep into the enormous creative talent of the “King of Pop.” Although there is no room filled with his Mylar pillows to play in this time around, there is plenty to enjoy in this massive retrospective that includes many of the artist’s lesser known works in charcoal and erotica."
World Class,World class art and exhibits.  Well worth multiple visits.  Be sure to see Chagall windows and stock exchange room in-addition to the more well-know sites.
New exciting installations since last visit,"One of the highlights of this great city is the ART INSTITUTE. Having Once lived in the suburbs we had visited often.  Our hosts were anxious for us to see the permanent installation of medieval art, knights armor, weaponry etc. it did not disappoint. The centerpiece of men astride their horses and posed for battle was awesome. The technology that can be manipulated describes the contracting of the armor from queen's permissions to commission ,to mining of ore ,to blacksmith to finished garments.  Most complete exhibition I’ve seen. The rooftop restaurant (inside) was . Superb...French wines included.  The new outside installation of a unfinished world was thoughtful, and the view of new buildings from the outside rooftop inspiring."
First class taking in of Art of every description.,"A must see in Chicago.  Take the time to wander through all the exhibitions to be enchanted and inspired, and then pass by the gift shop for a delightful souvenir of your visit and/or the city.(Lunch at the top also excellent. . )"
Wonderful collection,"Some of the finest works of art in the world. Picasso, Grant Wood, Stained Glass, etc. You will recognize many of the works from books, prints, calendars."
Fantastic museum,"Very pleasantly surprised by the Art Institute of Chicago. Collection is one of the best I’ve seen stateside. Relatively easy to navigate, which also puts it in my top fav museums I’ve visited worldwide. Warhol exhibit is worth a visit. Many “famous” works to enjoy throughout the museum. We spent 2.5 hours, which flew by. Wish we had had more time but museum was closing. More than one area to grab something to eat or drink. Love that they encourage picture taking here. Could have easily spent the day. Don’t recommend purchasing the pocket guide...didn’t find it helpful. Will definitely return and highly recommend."
Good impressions!,This art gallery has the best series of collections of Impressionist art outside France - amazing. Lots of other key pieces notably American Gothic (the weird couple with the pitchfork). One afternoon did not do it justice as the building is huge.  Millennium Park and the Cloud Gate (silver bean) is a short walk away.
Great place to go with the tour guide,Visited the art institute again but this time I went with the tour guide.Awesome experience with the help of the guide... I never knew the details of the paintings without the guide.I would strongly recommend to have the guide with you if you want to understand more about the paintings and artists!
Artistic,"One of the finest art museums in the world.  It has an exceptionally large collection of impressionist art, along with large collections spanning pre-renaisance to modern."
History in Spades,"I was on a business trip and had half a day to spare. We decided to go to the Art Institude which in my opinion is incorrectly named. It should be called the History Museum of Chicago as it was so good. If you are into history you will enjoy immensely. Artifact that were centuries old were everywhere, many BC. If I had the time I could have spent the entire day there. Well worth the visit, you won't be disappointed."
A Truly Amazing Art Museum,The Art Institute is a beautiful and enchanting museum. I have been a number of times and always enjoy my visit. There are always new and interesting exhibits.
Best Kept Secret: Thorne Miniature Rooms & Children/Family Rooms,"Avid explorers will know about this secret, but if you are the occasional tourist, this is one exhibit to see.  You can look into historical furniture styles from across the globe: Asia, America and Europe.  It's cool to see so much in such a short time, and relaxing as well.  Ask the front for directions right when they open for the best experience.   Other great options are the exhibits in the modern wing, and also the children/family space on the first floor (near the group entrance area).  You can do your own drawing, and take it with you, and the kids can get a passport prize for fulfilling their own museum tour.  How cool is that?"
Andy Warhol,We saw the exhibit on Sunday. Really enjoyed seeing the familiar as well as unfamiliar works. We were amazed at how many works Warhol completed in his lifetime and his tough times in the late 60s.
Excellent,"This museum its a must, it has precious artwork and lots of nice an awesome permanent exhibitions. you could spend a whole day and not get bored  at all."
Excellent museum,One of the best museums ive been too. Lucky alao that their was a special exhibition of Andy Warhols works. Had a great time enjoying the magnificent masterpieces especially George Deurat painying.
Andy Warhol exhibit.,Great exhibit. A huge collection of his works from the mid 40’s to the late 70’s. The iconic Campbell soup cans and His Marilyn Monroe works.  The history and reasoning behind most of his work was fascinating!  We recommend the audio recordings moving from room to room.  It’s about $7 more. Highly recommended. Don’t miss it.
World class collection for a world class city,"Those paintings you saw in your high school and college textbooks? They're here. And so are a lot of other unusual pieces. While not as strong on modern art as MOMA, The Art Institute has a significant collection. Don't miss the decorative arts, and whatever special shows they have."
Amazing artworks,"We started our Route 66 trip in Chicago and when I found out that both Nighthawks and American Gothic were on display here we had to visit.  We weren’t disappointed - seeing these two particular paintings up close gave me goosebumps - I’ve loved Nighthawks for a long time.The museum was clearly laid out, had directions in each gallery to the next and has some amazing art throughout.  You could easily spend a whole day here and not see everything."
large museum,"Went specifically to see ""A Sunday on La Grande Jatte"" by Seurat and ""American Gothic"" but saw so many more gorgeous paintings, sculptures, and furniture. We were not able to see the Andy Warhol exhibit as it was still being installed. May have to return to see more."
Once is not enough!,"This was our second visit to the AI this year. This time we were there for the Warhol exhibit. We thoroughly enjoy the time spent here. Now after reading some of the other reviews, I noticed I missed seeing several other great works. I will be back!"
"When you come to Chicago, see this first!","There is something for everyone here, from 5 to 95 -- from collections of medieval armor, stunning displays of early Chinese pottery, beautiful paperweights, to the deservedly world-famous collection of Impressionist masters.   You can spend all day here and not see all of the collections, but try to get to the antiquarian Greek and Roman sculptures and the brilliant Thorne room miniatures.   Truth in reporting -- I'm a 30-year Chicago resident whose office is around the corner from this amazing resource, and I go every time I have an hour to spare."
A Gem!,"Take your time to enjoy and don’t miss this treasure! The current Warhol exhibit had just opened and it is an extensive collection of the artist’s work and career including videos and some of the advertisements he created. The museum treasures range from “American Gothic” and a collection of Georgia O’Keefe paintings to the Impressionists with several outstanding Monet’s. Don’t miss the breathtaking Chagal stained glass windows, created as a gift to the United State!"
Wonderfull Art Gallery,I have been to Chicago about 5 times and have spent 5 to 8 hrs enjoying there wonderful collection .
Above and Beyond,"Even though we allotted more than half a day for our visit to this museum, it was not nearly enough.  The collection is phenomenal, and I truly do not think that three full days would be enough to do it justice.  What a treasure trove it beautifully houses!"
Wow - this has to be on your ‘must do’ list for Chicago ,"I’ve visited Chicago on many occasions and have seen just about everything the city has to offer but the art institute was the one thing I hadn’t done, and it was certainly one of the best.This place is phenomenal. I spent just over 4 hours here and would have spent longer if I’d had time. There is so much to see, and the variety is staggering. Picasso, Cezanne, Renoir, Monet are just some of the famous names whose work is on display. Aside from the odd school party (mainly excitedly looking at the Thorne miniatures in the basement), it felt so peaceful and wasn’t crowded at all on the Thursday afternoon I visited.There are so many highlights but a few of my favourites were:The Thorne miniatures - room scenes recreated at 1 inch to 1 foot scale of English, French and US period homes. The details were amazing. The most incredible ‘dolls house’ interiors you’ll ever seeChagall’s Windows - beautiful stained glass windows. The blues are mesmerising. If you’re a fan of the 1980s classic film Ferris Bueller’s Day Off you’ll remember them from the movieAndy Warhol exhibition - this was an additional cost but was a fascinating insight into the mind and talent of Warhol. Impressionist gallery - Monet, Renoir, Cezanne to name just a few. Some of the most famous artists in history have work displayed here and it’s mind-blowing seeing piece after piece adorning the wallsIf you visit Chicago, put a visit here near the top of your list. Alongside The Bean, Hancock and Willis Towers and the architecture boat tour, this is a highlight!"
Warhol Exhibit,"We spent three hours here and the museum is fabulous! The collection is amazing. We didn’t see all there was to see, the next visit, I suppose! The Warhol exhibit was incredible! 🙌🏼"
