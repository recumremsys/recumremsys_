Clean & Neet,"Neet and clean Beach,  a must Beach to visit in your Goa trip,  good clean surrounding, Clean sand,  clear clean water"
Enjoy real beach with no disturbance,"Calm quite and awesome ,Never imagine such beach in Goa.Very clean and zero disturbanceNo street vendor disturb you.Clean water Most important isSafe for families"
Best secluded white sand beach in Goa,"The reason I say best is coz in my numerous trips to Goa beaches right from Baga, Calagute, Candolim, Mandrem , Vagator, Morjim in North Goa to Canacona, Agonda, Palolem beaches in South, Varca turns out to be the best clean and free of public. And there is a simple reason for it...it just doesn't have enough hotels and shacks !I am not quite sure whether it's due to low awareness , popularity of dearth of budget hotels but maybe because if these reasons it's a place to be..The sands white, the beach quite broad for u to play, run, chill , sleep etc.. few shacks (must say most are not that good in food taste but it's the beach for which you go there ) and it's a long one.So if you wanna really rejuvenate, dont wanna see many faces and be by yourself then go to Varca..Best part about this beach is it's just 45 mins from the airport unlike other South Goa beaches. So you don't waste too much time traveling like in the case of far north (Mandrem,Morjim, Arambol) or far south ( Canacona, Agonda, Palolem)TIP : if you want a good meal (lunch/dinner) and don't wanna compromise on taste or quality then you can walk across to a hotel called Sterling Varca. That's the best in food and absolute bliss. It's just 500 mtrs from the entrance of Varca beach or just behind Zuri white Sands hotel."
good,in south goa Varca is a 12 km stretch of marvelous white sandy beaches in South Goa enjoy sunset here
Beautiful and Uncrowded beach in South Goa,"We stayed at Club Mahindra, which is bang on the Varca Beach only. You have to walk just 300 meters from your resort and you are on the beach!The sand on the beach is powder and very soft. The beach is very clean and only a few tourists or locals you can see playing or walking.It is dotted only by one or two shacks who provide the bench, ☂️ and the food, of you need.Water is very clean and temperature is good to take a swim in the sea and enjoy!Overall, it's exotic experience."
Best Beach in Goa,"Soft Golden sand, clean water, no shells and plants from sea, shallow water. What else you need?Stay in Sterling Varca or Mahindra, eat in Garden Cafe restaurant."
If only the stray dogs were not there,"The best beach of Goa, if only the stray dogs were not there. The administration is doing nothing to contain their numbers, they are a menace on this beach. My son was chased badly and it was a nightmare of an experience on the otherwise beautiful beach."
Varca beach,This area is part of a massive stretch of sand the area called Varca is lovely only one shack and maybe a dozen sunbeds you can walk for miles either way well worth finding
Clean and Serene,"Beautiful beach. Though you would not see alot of people post 8pm whih is a dampener to the Goa spirits and people here would say "" We are not like North Goa, where beaches are open but its risky"". I was like guys 20 mins up in South Goa, Colva beach is open at night and safe and nice. A culture issue mostly"
Best Beach in Goa - Clean n Wild Sand.,"Varca beach is one of the less crowded one even compared with Colva beach which is only about 10 km from Varca. You can hire beach-chairs which are mostly placed under beach-umbrellas and charged at hourly rates by the beach side restaurants/shacks. They also serve you cold Beer, drinks, food & snacks."
Varca the best beach to visit ,Great place to be there.  Calm and less crowded than noth Goa beaches and some in south.   You can just relax or take a morning walk on the beach...
"Quiet, clean, enjoyable","My family loved this beach. We stayed in Varca for a week and really enjoyed the beach. It is very clean, and not busy at all. There aren’t as many beach chairs and food shacks as other, busier beaches, but enough to get by. We mostly just set up in the sand and enjoyed the waves for hours."
Good Beach,Another spectacular beach in Goa. Neatly maintained and good to visit. Crowd is less while compare to other beaches.
Varca beach Goa -- a less-crowded beach with a relaxing ambience!,"Goa is surrounded by some of the most beautiful beaches, not only in India but perhaps the World. Some of these beaches are very crowded and some are not (especially during the peak/tourist season).Varca beach is one of the less crowded one even compared with Colva beach which is only about 10 km from Varca. If you are looking for a quiet beach with nice ambience to relax in Goa, then Varca beach is one of them. There is less activity here like Jet skiing, Para sailing etc. which is more evident in neighbouring Colva beach and other beaches, so there are less number of tourists/visitors here. For this reason perhaps there are less number of beach-side-food/drinks shacks & restaurants here too (compared to Colva and other beaches). You can hire beach-chairs which are mostly placed under beach-umbrellas and charged at hourly rates by the beach side restaurants/shacks. They also serve you cold Beer, drinks, food & snacks. (Some will offer you better rates/deal if you agree to also buy food, drinks from them -- it's negotiable).  Varca town itself which is about 3 km from the beach (and about 28 km from Dabolim international Airport) is quite a relaxed place to stay in Goa. It has many multi-cuisine restaurants/eateries, convenience stores, Souvenirs shops etc. From Varca you can organise day trips to many places of interest in Goa.Malay AdhikariMelbourne, Australia)"
Beautiful,I stayed at a resort right on the beach.  The water was extremely clean and so was the sand itself.  It had some waves but nothing to rough
Clean and wild sand and spectacular sunset,"Very clean beach  keep perpect maintened by the cleaners from the village , excellent  send. Eating sea food to Pereira during sunset was lovely."
"Great beach,","A nice, relaxing and quiet beach. You can 'rent' a sunbed if you just buy a drink at one of the cafes and use it for the day. Nice water too and the beach is clean."
Awesome beach,"This beach is clean and reasonably shallow so that we can bath there safely. Conpared to other beaches the crowd is less and this makes it more attractive.Do try some fish delicacies from the nearby shacks However the costs of these shacks seems to on the higher side.There are activities like paragliding, jet skiing etc."
Nice white sand beach,"The beach is clean and nice and the shore gradient is gentle, so it is safe even for non-swimmers to wade in. Water sports like Jet Ski and Para-sailing available. A few beach shacks are also available to enjoy food and drinks, but do not expect high quality of food preparation. Stray dogs are a bit of nuisance."
"A Quality resort in India, Goa","I am a member for last 9 years at Varca Beach resort, Clubmahindra. A place in India for cleanness with miles of beach.  They have 3 restaurants to cover world wide food. Staff are pleasant and it has 2 swimming pool , Spa and a small grocery shop. I come here from Scotland to have holiday nealy every year."

Best stay so far at the Zuri,"this was the fourth time I visited this hotel and I must say overall this was the best time every. The staff and the food were absolutely great. The standards in the room are in my meaning not like a 5 star room should be, especially not the bathrooms. There are dirth in the corners here and there but it is India. For me its too cold in side the bar and restaurants because of the aircondition. The staff and management are very nice and friendly and and wanna say a speciall thanks to my friends Ubhay Singh,  Pun Magar Chet Ram and Alroy. And of course all the guys and girls at the Zuri. Last but not least, my dear friend - Beach Guard!"
Stunning beach,This is a great beach on soft white sand that stretches for miles. Its relatively clean and there's loads of empty space. Restaurants are strategically placed along the beach for those wanting to enjoy some seafood.
peacefull beach,South goa  is peacefull. Verca  beach is  so beautyfull . . This  beach  is  very  neat & clean.  Family can enjoy  water games  at this  beach. Reastaurents at this  beach  is very  economical.

Clean and quiet!,"The south part of the Indian coast is not so populated with tourists. It is cleaned every day, there are shakes (cafes) on the beach to eat. As a minus I consider the currents along the beach."
Lovelt,"Nice sand and really quiet , five or six shacks serving excellent food and drinks.  Not had any problems in all my years of visiting."
"Loved the beach, shack, weather.. Perfect South Goa Beach","If you reach this beach via Club Mahindra Resort, you will be amazed to see the calmness, cleanliness and chilling vibe. Take a shack, grab a beer and go for a swim. The water is shallow, so can go deep.Absolutely amazing chill vibe, spent whole afternoon and half evening chilling here. Highly recommended for those who are looking for calm beach and would want to spend time with themselves."
Vergin Beach ... Really nice beach...,"It is really nice beach more like a private beach, neat, clean with less public.It had direct entry from club Mahindra verca beach resort."

Beach holiday,"Varca beach absolutely beautiful, one of the best hotels is carevela beach resort here amazing staff and clean hotel"
beautiful & quite beach,"beautiful, quite and clean beach. But there was only one restaurant . we do not have much options for cafe or something else..."
Tranquil Beach with Beautiful Sunsets,"We did visit in the shoulder season, after an extended monsoon. The beach is beautiful, clean and not too crowded. At this time only a couple of beach shacks were operational. But we did get our share of sun beds and sea food. Unlike other beaches in Goa, this seemed to be devoid of hawkers, masseurs and their ilk. Water sports are limited. There are a few non-menacing stray dogs, and a cattle shed with the accompanying poop. Life guards are on duty.  Breakfast on the beach was beautiful, sunset was sublime. Perhaps peak season will interfere with the tranquility. But I will visit again in Novembers"
A quiet place to enjoy with family,The beach is clean and free of crowds.. You can enjoy with your family and loved ones..A few shack restaurants are also there to cater to your needs..
Clean and peaceful Varca Beach,Great beach for relaxing and long walks. Clean and safe and not crowded like the North Goa beaches. Water was lovely and warm. Beautiful white sand.

It is an extension of the resort and so adds to  food points.It is overall well maintained beach and definitely a must visit one."
Beautifull sererne beaches,"The Varca beach is one of the beaches in the southern part of the state, away from the hustle and bustle of the beaches of the north. This is the place to go if you want to enjoy a peacefull walk in the sands with your partner, catch a breathtaking sunset, and build sand castles with your kids without being afraid that the crowd will crush it even before it is built.There are multiple resorts along the stretch mostly having their private entrance."

Very clean beach with very less crowd as most of the expensive resorts are on this beach like caravella resort, zuri resort etc.Less and decent crowd also gives an advantage to the women and kids to swim and enjoy near the beach.

Clean beach ,One of the cleanest beaches in South Goa . A must visit for couples n family . It has various access points so choose wisely. I took the route from club Mahindra hotel . Also has life guards around . Would not recommend going in the night after sundown .

Aditya,"I visited Goa in mid of February and stayed in Sterling Goa Varca with my friends and their family. The stay was really comfortable and relaxing. The cleanliness was up to the mark. They have very good staff. Mr. Suvenkar was really helpful to us. Even the other staff members were taking care of our comfortable stay. They entertained our kids, became our cameraman when we were in swimming pool, took care of our food preferences in dining area. We  enjoyed their holiday activities like Dance, Family Games, magic show and many more. They have good indoor and outdoor games where our children were engaged.  They have kids play area, indoor games as well as outdoor games. The ladies preferred going to their spa. It was also nice. The food was amazingly delicious. It was less spicy yet tasty. One can customize the spice level as per their taste. The resort surrounding was beautiful. There were coconut trees all around. The Varca beach was very nearby. It was clean and isolated that gives you the feeling of private beach. Although I also have a suggestion for the owners. There is a need of washbasin near dining area. The existing one is quite far away. The stay in Sterling Goa Varca was amazing and memorable."
Clean beautiful quiet beach,"Had wonderful experiences with Sunset yoga, Sunrise yoga and riding a bike with the Sunset, walks..."
GREAT BREAK FROM NORTH WINTERS,"My family stay at  Club Mahindra Varca Beach Goa from 02 to 04 Feb was a great experience. The resort has its own beach and plethora of Adventure Activities. It ha two swimming pools to cater for its guests in 250 odd rooms. The hospitality, catering and housekeeping are all flawless."
Awesome,Great and only beach in goa which is peaceful. We went for a morning bath and enjoyed to the core. I would suggest this to all especially for family.
Swim from Varca to Benaulim along shore line,I did a swim 200 meters from the shore from Varca to Benaulim on 10th Feb 2019 starting at 3.30pm to 5:10pm. It was simply awesome 3.4 km swim. The water is a little salty so if you guys are into long swims you do get a little dehydrated. But the experience is very good.
Clean Beach,"Varca beach is clean and tidy beach with lots of water sports in place,this beach has lots of security and people here are friendly."
No need to go to foreign for clear beachs,"Very beautiful beach, surrounded by all  5 star properties , water is crystal clear and will surely give foreign feel"
Leasure trip to Goa.,"Stayed at sterling varka. Visited varka beach. Comparatively Clean, clean water.no haukers, no noise pollution.well must visit beach in Goa."
clean,One of the best beaches in goa..less crowded and the cool white sands just hugs your feet.there are also water sports available and a few shacks for food and drinks.
Very clean beach ,"Of all the beaches we have been in Goa, this is one of the cleanest. Was less crowded and we have very peaceful walks."
"excellent, clean beach","great white sand,  no sellers, hawkers...just very nice, less crowded amazing beach...we entered the beach from the road which is next to the Zuri white sands compound wall...make right, just before Zuri's gate...."
Amazing beach,This is the beach if you enjoy being almost(!) by yourself and also if you love beautiful sunsets either in gold or peach! No filter needed here!
A BEACH TO REMEMBER,"Being very close to where we stayed, we would often walk down the distance, at least, twice everyday. My very first encounter with the beach ensured its place in my list of favourites. The white sands creating a strange creaking sound under the feet deserve mention together with the never-ending stretch of the beach which tempts one for long walks. The beach, rather surprisingly, is never very crowded and therefore, make sea-bathing a great fun.By the way, presence of lifeguards at strategic points is quite reassuring."
Avoid on weekends,"We were staying in a nearby property, we went to spend time there on a Sunday evening but were surprised to see that many buses were parked there beach was full of people and they were eating food on the beach side and littering all over the place. very disappointing"
Clean white sands,"Every day an army of cleaners clear this beautiful beach of rubbish - and there's often quite a bit. The sand is white and the beaches long. There are a number of shacks offering food, drink and amenities such as water sport equipment etc. Watching the tide come in or the sun setting on the horizon is a magical experience."
Clean & Pristine,Kids used to spend major part of the day here without caring to eat or rest. Could gaze at all beautiful phases of the sea & the sky.
Great relax in beach,"The long stretch of beach out side the caravella never gets crowded, it has life guards on duty and is the perfect place to relax."
Beautiful and quite,Quiter than surrounding beaches. Beautiful it is. Morning run was fantastic on the beach. No hawkers I saw ..I think for couples it's best to stay near varca
Excellent Holiday Resort ,"This is a most wonderful location where the accommodation is excellent,  the food great and the staff could not be more accommodating. The only criticism is that WiFi is only available in the lobby and not across the whole site which,  in this day and age,  should be so."
Pristine Beach ,One of the finest beach ever seen in Goa which is well manned and has lots of activities to count On.
Silver sand beach,"Best beach in Goa. Neat and clean. Absolutely stunning silver soft sand. Beautiful sunset, water sports and nice shaks. All great."
Beast beach ever,"Clean peaceful and wonderful ,what more can I say , beautiful stretch of beach with great beach shacks to stop at for a well deserved drink"
One of the best beach in south goa,The beach is not crowded. Its a quiet beach with few shacks. Best time would be to come in early morning and evening for sunset. Few water sport options are also available.
"Beautiful, quiet beach!",So glad I came here - so different from the commercial North Goa. If you want hustle and bustle this is NOT the place for you - but if you want long quiet walks on an almost deserted beach - this is heaven!!
Holiday spoiled,"Very bad experience, resort has permitted activity of Nissan kicks and there was a flow of 300- 400 people allowed in the common area, very unprofessional."
Fabulous ,"This beach just goes on for miles and miles. It is the perfect holiday beach,  just sand, sand and more sand. It's perfect for walking,  jogging and just sunbathing. There are various beach shacks all along where you can get wonderful local food and refreshments and most provide sunbeds too. If you are up early enough you can watch the local fishermen land their boats with the daily catch. The perfect end to the day is being on the beach to watch the most glorious sunset."
Beautiful beach,"Beautiful clean beach,  few shacks that serve refreshments and local food, The young waiters will approach you to use the loungers, we did use the loungers, they are happy if you order some snack or refreshments, but don't make you feel harassed."
"Fab, clean beach","Varca BeachVarcaFab, clean beach644344500The beach at Varca was very beautiful, clean and quiet. The beach restaurants all offered great food and service and you must stop at Evisha's and have a sundowner. The beaches are similar up and down this stretch of coast and we cycled north to Benaulim and south to Cavelossim and all the beaches were pretty much the same, some more crowded than others but all had clean, white sand and plenty of restaurants and bars. One downside is that it is quite difficult to swim if there is a swell, but the Lifeguards will always advise if asked. There are lots of dogs on Varca beach and I can assure you they are harmless. An English lady called Sandra runs a charity which serves to get all the dogs vaccinated and sterilised to ensure they remain healthy and numbers are controlled. Her charity is ensures all dogs are vaccinated against mange, parasites, worms and rabies. The dogs are also sterilised in order to control the population and the charity feeds them 365 days a year. 100% of your donation goes to this great cause if you choose to give."
Beautiful Beach,Clean and Private Beach. Beautiful place to enjoy a cold beer and watch the sunset. Safe for swimming and lifeguards present
Peaceful Beautiful Beach ,"Spent 5 days here with friends. White sandy long beach, which is very clean. Good food and service from Evisha Shack which looks fabulous at night with beautiful lights and flowing drapes. The beach is quiet compared to Colva Beach which can be chaotic. Wish our stay was longer. Best sunset in Goa"
Personal family visit,Wonderful stay ...everything was just perfect... Beach at a walking distance.... Rooms extremely well maintained... Linen clean.... Kitchen with ample cooking facility.... Automatic washing machine.... Lovely morning sunshine..... Clean swimming pool
"Beach walk into serenity - soul, body and mind","Goa, a relaxed place, offering plenty of natural habitat to relax. The best being a sea beach.There are plenty of beaches in Goa and one of the popular one's being Varca Beach. It's popularity is mainly due to central location, closeness to railway station and connectivity to South Goa. Mention of South Goa is required primarily as family vacationers like us visit South Goa for a relaxing seaside vacation and with Club Mahindra offering more than one options in South Goa vicinity, the mention is all the more required.Also, the relaxing and family traveler primarily prefers South Goa. Looking to be away from normal city hustle bustle, the serenity offered by South Goa is the primary attraction of a Goa visit.Varca beach, offers easy on pocket eating places at or near the beach. The beach itself spread across about 1000-1500 meters or probably more, is clean at fringes with central (near to shops and main entry) area requires more upkeep and cleanliness, even in off-season. The situation can be compelling in season - after October.A walk with alone, with your better half or kid can be very relaxing, the sound of waves throwing music to ears and collection of shells, a joyous experience.Suggested visit to the beach to enjoy an ice-cream (sold way over the MRP) is a treat in itself.Preferred suggested time to visit is - early morning - around sun-rise or late evening - around sun-set.Enjoy the sea , a tad away from central beach to enjoy the loneliness and feel nature."
A calm and quiet less crowded beach,South Goas has beaches which are less crowded and this one is one among them. The beach is good for a morning stroll or evening walk. There arent much water sports but you still can have a good time. There are small rocks a little into the sea which one must be careful about.
Beautiful Beach ,"Well maintained beach which was well connected to our resort, lots of sports and fun activities,caravela staff clean up the beach on daily basis."
Pristine beauty in the heart of South Goa,"Having had trysts with North Goan beaches during most past visits, choosing South Goa this time was purposeful, and are we glad we did! Varca beach is a sight to behold... white, soft sands leading to a relatively calm see that allows you to swim into the moderately sized waves, and lined with just enough number of shaded beach-beds, you can spend hours here without a thought. The Caravela resort offers two shacks providing interesting cocktails and fresh sea-food, which adds to the charm. Water-sport options are available - although without the hassle of people forcing you to go parasailing or jet-skiing. You are free from the nagging tattoo makers, masseurs and hawkers trying to see you anklets & beads - multiple beaches will offer you these, in case you were interested - but Varca isn't one of them. If you're looking to simply chill out, and while-away your time while watching the sea and sipping on exotic cocktails, Varca is the place to be!"
Peaceful Beach,Varca beach is one of the more peaceful beaches in Goa. This beach in South Goa has soft white sand and is perfect for a long morning or evening walk.
Amazingly clean beach,Amazingly clean beach to unwind and relax. Especially if you are accessing it as part of a beach resort. Beach is mostly quiet with not many crowds.
Varca Beach,What a beach 29 k of golden sand shared with other resorts.Spotlessly clean and the sea was so warmQuite a few restaurants on beach with good food and great serviceGreat place to chill out
Great stay,"Great stay good hospitality. Staff was good, amenities we're good and satisfying.Sohail in the house keeping was outstanding.Liked my stay overall"
More or less personal beach,This is a beach with white clean sand and Mishas shack to serve you food and drinks. Very few people are here so you can spend a quiet beach to yourself day or days here.
Amazing sand quality and not crowded ,Amazing sand quality and not crowded too. Good water sports activities. Great for kids to play. Early mornings are awesome and sunsets are unbelievable.
Very Good Beach,"White Sands, endless beach, good water sports options to choose from, Access to beach is easy with a bar close by."
Isolated beach,"Varca beach is not very populated. It is mostly visited by Club Mahindra guests who have an almost private entrance to the beach. Due to low strength of tourists, the beach does not have much to offer, unlike other goan beaches. Just one shack,that too underutilised/occupied. Beach per say is alright but no facilities for entertainment. Ok , if you are staying at Club Mahindra because there isn't much choice, otherwise not worth a visit."
Excellent Beach in South Goa,It is an excellent beach in South Goa which is clean and beautiful with white sand. It is not crowded but does have some water sports facilities. The slope is gentle which makes it very enjoyable for non - swimmers and children.There are few shacks which serve good and tasty food.
Big Beautiful Broad Beach,"Varca beach is a Big Beautiful and Broad Beach with white powdery sand. It is not overcrowded like some other south Goa beaches because of limited accessibility. One of the access points is the road abutting Zuri White Sands Beach Resort.  Be aware that you have to climb a small sandy hillock to gain access to this beach from here. Not advisable for people with limited mobility. Once on the beach, it is a haven for sunbathers. Very few spots with any shade. However there are the usual shacks with umbrellas and beach chairs for hire."
plz dont follow google map,We had followed google map and reached at the back gate of club mahindra resort  which they wont open for outsiders . Im not sure whtr there is any other route to reach the beach .
 Beautifule,It’s clean beach without rush and lots of people and activities. Water is clean and clear.. yes but not so many shags and sheds to cover the heat..
Very beautiful and very clean and safe beach,"I visited with my family and spent almost entire day here. Till now this is the best beach for us in Goa. Kindly avoid the beach shack at Varca beach, named Pereira's Sweet Hut. They cheat customers and food taste is not good."
Beautiful Serene white sand beach,"If you want to spend some time enjoying nature...do visit varca beach...it’s neat, quiet and serene...no disturbance and looks like a private beach. Enjoy the sunrise and sunset both and you will not regret"
Varca Beach Review.,The beach us very clean. We went for boating. There is a restaurant with variety of items in the menu. We went for boating. We paid Rs 600 each for 30 mins drive. This is very costly. The boat person gave us ride only for 20 mins. A good place to spend and enjoy especially…
Calm n cool,"Varca beach is in south Goa, most of the crowd here is from the resorts located near this beach.  You will fine less Indian crowd here and most of people on this beach are foreigners. I visited this beach in month of November and one interesting thing I noticed about this beach…"
Simple beach with only 1 shack and no activities,"The beach is good if u crave for silence, otherwise varca is a tepid beach with a single shack that has horrible tea and worser food. It suit us best as there was solitude and no disturbance. Otherwise the famous goa spirit is not felt here,better opt for other beaches"
Neat and Clean,"Very nice , neat and clean White sand beach. Not heavily crowded. Has water sports activities. Only few number of Restaurants and Bars."
Nice beach ,Adjoining club mahindra this beach is nice IIT is season now so you have a shack and water sports The beach is clean and very convenient for those staying in club mahindra it also has marsh land which attracts birds
Lovely and Clean beach,A really lovely beach with white sand. Clean and less crowded. Must a visit if you are in south Goa.
Beautiful beach,My first time here. Not as busy as the north area around Candolim or Baga. Sea calmer too. Lifeguards patrol the beach and warning flags are posted too. The beach very clean but quite a few stray dogs though. Decent amount of shacks and sun beds.
Quite location ,Excellent  beach away  from the crowded location. Beach guards are available  and they ask you to come out of water after sunset.
"Beaches..Beaches..Beaches, They take your heart away","Nice clean, golden sand beach. Something that we people from big cities don't get elsewhere. Go Goa!"
Pristine bwach,The best and cleanest beach in Goa.  Loved the vast flat expanse. The crystal clear water.  The beach sports and the extremely alert expert life guards.  We even saw them rescue a tired swimmer. The water is so clear that you can see the hermit crabs and star fishes clearly. No trash on this beach. In other words it's the best.
Long and peaceful,"Not to much people, and not to much salesmen. Great waves, but strong streams... it’s neccesary to know howe to swim."
Beautiful Serene beach,"As a beach Varca is similar to Utorda and also has a distant hill on its southern side, which looks picturesque. To me it’s the cleanest beach after Utorda, with soft white sand. The uniqueness about Varca is its casurina trees along the shoreline, instead of the usual coconut trees, which gives varca a distinct look. Lot of high end hotels with direct beach access is present in Varca, so another ideal place for peace loving tourists. The locality around Varca is extremely picturesque with picture perfect bungalows situated amidst huge courtyards. This November I visited South Goa beaches from Arossim to Palolem. For the trip report search google with ramblersnaps + South Goa"
Wonderful Beach,"You will feel you are in the heaven. Nice, neat and clean beach with white sand and clean water. You will feel like a private beach. Will visit again."
Finest 🌇Sunset It was 👌👌👌👌,"Varca Beach is the one of the Cleanest beach in the South Goa. Clean and Crystal Clear water. Always enjoy my visit to Varca Beach visited many time but witnessed the sun set this time and it was beautiful. Radish Colour of the Sea and Clouds during sunset was the real beauty. Lots of Visitors from the hotels like Caravel Beach Resort, Zuri White Sand and Taj Exotica. During peak season there will be water activities like Water Boat Ride,  Hot Balloon Ride and lot more activities. Do visit to enjoy the Beauty and those all activities."
Neat and clean,"One of the cleanest beach of South Goa. We accessed this beach via Caravela beach resort where we stayed in South Goa. Sports activities like parasailing, jet skiing happens here"
Very clean ,"Very clean and peaceful beach. Not much crowd. Clear water. We collected many shells. It’s was a 15 minute walk from club Mahindra, so visited every day. We enjoyed it more than the other crowded beaches."
Ideal for the introspective morning walk...),Varca is one of the cleanest beach I have found in South Goa. The beach is big and you can have a really good introspective morning walk here if you have your head full of thoughts and want to think through...it’s so quiet and peaceful....as you walk along the beach you can reach Zuri resort and the Mahindra club which also have a good beach front but the stretch at Varca has less crowd so that’s the spot you should spend in the morning. Try to go a bit and early since the sun comes up early and it can be quite hot even in the morning. There are some beach sports which you can find on the beach stretch towards Colva
Less crowded beach,"As we were very near to the beach, we could enjoy the beach, the sunset, the waves and meditation on the beach. All this was possible because of the beach not being so crowded. It is better to have more water sports here as the couple of them are too expensive as compared to Colva and other beaches."
Clean & Peaceful Beach,I have visited this place after my 3rd trip to Goa. I found this beach most clean & most silent over all other beached in Goa. If U think about destination Event than No Other Than Hotel Caravella Beach Resort has the best view of this beach.The best part is Lifeguard Checkpost are very active & are in plenty.Beach sand is silk smooth & water is not too deep.
Varca Beach !! ,One of the best beaches in Goa  and it’s located in the Southern Part of Goa close to Benaulim.Lots of beach resorts are nearby and its really awesome if you are a couple or going with family Hardly any shacks or food available here Take a 2 wheeler and snacks with you Keep the beach clean as it is Overall - 5 stars
Clean and beautiful,This beach is very clean. The sand is silky soft. You can walk along the beach for quite a while. There are a lot of hawkers trying to sell you memberships which is the only downside.
Nice and Calm beach,It is a very nice and clam beach with very less crowd where you can spend a good morning or evening time with your family and kids.
Family time at the sea,"We had a wonderful opportunity to enjoy private beach facilities at Varca Beach as part of our stay @Majestic Beach Comfort. It was quiet and serene and we, a family of four adults and three children, could peacefully bathe in the sea while playing, swimming and enjoying all along. The silver sand was soothing to the eyes and the ambience was one to create a permanent impression on the mind!"
Conference,Only for couple or family who would like to spent good time sitting in a beach without any noise and disturbance..
Nice shallow beach,"A good, clean shallow beach in south Goa. Has guards who keeps warning people who venture out far into the seas. This is a simple beach and does not have any restaurant attached to it. So pl carry food and water if you intend to spend a lot of time. There are also few sales agents distributing coupons of a neighbouring resort (it’s not Club Mahindra-it’s a different one and can’t remember the name). Pl do not participate in the event as there are stories of harassment."
Clean and peaceful beach,"Very clean and calm beach. As there is no public entry for the beach, it's really clean. Also, we can easily go quite a bit into the sea as it's shallow. Safety wise really good as there are guards stationed through out the day."
"Very clean, calm and shallow beach",Beach is very clean. One can easily go quite inside the sea and still water will we knee deep. Water sports are available on beach. Not very crowded. Have multiple life guard posts.
Holidays,We were travelling to Goa on a family vacation and visited Varca beach which was close to the hotel we were put up . This beach is neat and not crowded.... Good for visitors not having a busy iteneary and definitely this place not part of a defined tick check activity. The water is also not deep and good for people and children who want to have a swim in the ocean or get their feet wet. No shacks or sporting activity available currently on this beach however has a great potential to become yet another good Goan beach . Good for visit during daytime and avoid night time as not much of lighting or people around.
Overall the place is serene.,"Once again, I took a break and went with family to Club Mahindra Varca Resort from 7th to 11th October, 18.  I'm very regular with this property- Club Mahindra Varca and the way they attend through their staff is incredible. Exceptional service of the staff is its greatest USP. They were quite adept at discharging their duties.Indeed great to observe and feel, despite having large occupancies thought out the year, this property is “Well Maintained”. Presence of Good Housekeeping and Engineering Services reflect in Guest areas and can feel during the stay. Despite so many years of operations, ‘Factor of Fatigue’ is Not Visible. The rooms/suites are well equipped and tastefully adorned also with all basic necessities good decor and peaceful views from all rooms/suites, surrounded by greenery and water bodies. The property is expansive with a fairly large space allocated to Pools and spa. Activities were engaging and we felt that there is sufficient to feel absorbed during the day. Food is Good,.. Local Food is TOO Good. Local food as also a part of their menu in the Restaurant - is a great idea….Overall the place is serene. This Resort is a great place of vacation, rather it serves as a destination for family and friends to stay and enjoy together."
"We visited several beaches in GOA. This the CLEAN, COOL, NO CROWDY BEACH.","Club Mahindra, Palm Emerlad to VERCA beach is 800 mtrs. In the morning and evening short distance to walk to beach. Delfinetly enjoy the people related to other beaches."
Absolute clean beach,"This beach was connected to our resort and beach is well maintained with life guards on duty, security are polite and willing to help you always."
Clean and away from crowd,This is cleanest beach I have ever seen in Goa with no nonsense guys like in north Goa.Can be enjoyed like you own it... A must visit in south Goa
No Way to enter the public beach,We stayed at the Sterling Resorts Varca hoping to use this beach for our recreation. There was a very narrow entrance to the public beach which was completely flooded with drain water.
"Clean, white sands","Less than a KM away from the Resort.Empty road leading to the beach. Hardly any traffic. Very very hot, we went to the beach about 11.00 am. Profusely sweating. No trees to give shade. Nice plants (wild) along the way. Saw a huge green cactus plant, a few lotus floating, The beach was empty naturally we were there at a wrong time. Too hot,"
Good beach for privacy,The beach has very less crowd and hence can be enjoyed with family. No market nearby just one supermarket. A few restaurants are available.A very clean beach to enjoy sunset.
Nice place to spend evening,It's a clean beach which is not crowded. You can actually have a me time here. Water is clean for a quick bath. Life Guard is attentive too.
Great beach but difficult to approach,Such a lovely beach with white sands and miles and miles of flat surface to walk. Early morning walk is a bliss. But approach to the beach from sterling resort is a difficult one. Though the road till where the beach area begins is a lovely one you have to cross puddle of water and walk through a wooden bridge to get into the beach. This area is unmaintained and dirty. Thankfully early in the morning due to high tides previous night this was clean but again in the evening when we went we just could not cross over to the beach.
Calm and serene!,The varca beach is one of the calm and serene beaches in goa! Has an amazing view and is very peaceful! A must visit!
Clean beach with white sand and transparent water,"It's a good beach for a swim, not as calm as Palolem and not as aggressive as Agonda. I saw a couple of dead jellyfish at the shore, but did not find any issue during any of my swims.Also make sure you go there after November, becuase before that they have red flags everyone and lifeguards who would interrupt whenever you go beyond your knees inside water."
Lovely memories,White sand !!! High tides and low tides Clean beach . During low tide the water recedes far into the sea and give you feeling of walking into flat land with a thin layer of foamy water on your feet. Amazing calmness
"Serene, Clean and Mesmerizing","Varca Beach is one of the best kept beaches in South Goa. We stayed at Club Mahindra that has a private area in Varca Beach - it is clean, with hardly any crowd and you can spend hours on the beachside !"
Leisure trip with senior citizens. Calm and quiet. But if you want a happening place then North Goa is the best.,Good property with entertainment activity for kids . Good food with lot of variety and well managed. Thanks to Arup and Abhijeet
The best beach in India,I have been to a number of beaches in India and abroad however this has to be the best i have seen till date. I stayed in the Zuri White Sands and this was our private beach. The best part was that there was not a single garbage on the beach. It was super clean which added to the beauty.
Relaxing beach,Our property was on this beach and we thoroughly enjoyed walking on the white sands. Very calm with very few people visiting it.
Club Mahindra,The resort is amazing. The food is fabulous.The beach is fantasticThe pool is goodThe stay was comfortableHappy Hub is great. Chandni In the Happy Hub is nice we met In the Happy Hub
Calm and Serene,Amazing  beach - authors delight - calm and serene - majestic white and mystic waters are awesome - minimal commercial disruption make it highly relaxing
Cleanest White Sand Beach In Goa. Loved it!,"We were staying in Margao and it was our first time together in Goa. I was looking at the goa beaches online. We had already been to Palolem and then we were advised by the hotel staff that we should go to Varca beach. We went there and it was an amazing experience. We could have never imagined that we would find a stretch of marvelous white sand covering seashore and the glittering blue waves hugging the coast all to ourselves. The feeling was magical, we really enjoyed a lazy beach day there. There are only  2-3 shacks on the beach and is not crowded. We saw no more than 20 people on the beach. The beach is not commercialized so it’s a perfect place to enjoy each others company. We headed back right after sunset and not sure if shacks are open at night. There are many good accommodations around verca beach i.e. Club Mahindra Varca Beach Resort, Bissmark hotel, Zuri white sands etc. Benaulim Beach, Fatrade Beach, Margaon city and Colva Beach are some of its popular attractions nearby. At night Tangerine, sunset bar, sol bar, and blue lagoon are some of the places where you can enjoy a dance, music and great food."
Serene and calm,"Clean , peaceful and still not that crowded . The village is also very beautiful which leads to the beach making it even more fun journey"
Very nice and serene beach,"Serene , peaceful beach - clean and very little crowd. Very good for  people who wants to enjoy serene beach and no hustle bustle."
Verca Beach,Very clean water. But very unmanaged. Nearby area is scary. Please avoid going there in evening time
Excellent ,"Enjoyed our stay at Varca beach - club Mahindra resorts,  Goa. Enjoyed our vacation, just in the resorts.  Will visit again.  A nice resort to get away from our city life and routine."
A cool shot with cool water,I really loved that beautiful beach journey and a cool shot with our crazy groupmate I would like to experience such beautiful rides again and also recommend it
"Clean , serene ..","I went at verca beach in the night at around 7:30 pm and then the next morning at 11 am . Beach is beautifully, there were no shacks but it was a beaury. One of the best beaches in Goa .!!"
Excellent ,We enjoyed with family. Nice relaxing mood the view is good and the approach is great. It is just walking distance from our room.
White sand beach,"It's one of the cleanest beaches with white sand and a good beach, kind of a secluded beach not really crowded. Have 1 or 2 shacks ok types. Nearby located is Sterling, Zuri White Sands and Club Mahindra resorts."
hppy to be here,Also wanna visit Richard for a beautoful stay we had atthe reosrt.♥️Amazing Amazing Amazing!!! I have updated the frst revoew this one as well as it really slipped from my mind to add his name here.An important part of our few days journey and an amazing time😘😍
Untouched Beach,"I have never seen such a well maintained beach in entire Goa, with well appointed lifeguards to security guards posted on the beach,"
nature at its best,A early morning or a late evening jog ( in the monsoon season) at the Varca beach is what I enjoyed best. You will have the beach to yourself if you go very early in the morning for a run and take in the fresh air.  The white sandy beach is very clean and views will take your breath away. The experience will stay with you for a lifetime.
Varca beach,A remarkably clean beach away from the bustling crowdsExtremely beautiful n cleanA must visit to avoid the crowd @ Colva if u r in South Goa
Peaceful Beach,"It's a private beach, very clean.Only the resort guests are allowed so you will feel safe as no outsider can roam there."
Clean and well manned beach,"This beach was connected to our resort and was always cleaned by the resort staff,there are life guards on the beach and security of the resort keep an eye on the guest entering the water so it is safe."
Extremely clean and private beach,I was surprised to see such a clean beach. My wife and I were staying in Zuri and had access to this beach. Since we visited in monsoon there were no shacks open. But still was good to walk there.
Good,Good beach near Zuri.I visited the same during my last trip to Goa and enjoyed there in free time.It was awesome in the morning.
"Calm, Clean and Quiet",The beach has breath taking views and remains clean unlike other beaches here. The surroundings are serene and the beach lies nearby to resort. A must visit for someone looking to spend some quiet time alone.
My views,A clean serene beach with white sand and utmost privacy. An ideal sea shore with water sports and the beach is lined with various resorts and shacks and is safe and secure for tourists.
Nice clean beach,"We had a great time at the beach at it was adjacent to our resort. Being the rainy season, the seas were a bit rough but the breeze and the lack of crowds made it a serene experience."
Pretty beach with white sands..,Loved the beach .. full of White sands.. you can keep walking and enjoy it's beauty throughout.. also one of the cleanest beaches..  a must visit place if you love nature & beauty..
Quiet and Enjoyable Beach,"My trip to Varca was an enjoyable one.  This beach is quiet, neat and pleasant.  There are good eateries around which offer variety of food with low prices.  You can enjoy spending a lot of time at the water or take a sunbath.  If you want a peaceful beach where focus on family is the priority, this beach is the place.  Most of the other beaches in Goa are very much crowded."
Clean beach ,"White sand, super clean beach with very less crowd. I loved this beach because - you can spend hours here without any distraction. One of the best beach in Sourh Goa"
One of the best beaches of South Goa,"Varca beach is very clean compared to other South / North Goa Beaches and the white sand adds charm to the fun. We visited during Monsoon, so bathing in the sea was not allowed but we still managed to enjoy our visit to Varca Beach. The beach was approximately 900 meters from our resort, so we just walked to the beach and enjoyed Sunset there."
One of the most cleaner beaches,The sand is very clean ( Almost white). Beach is less crowded and amazing place for small children to play
familiy vacation,"Neat, clean and beautiful. Enjoyed one evening with family, my husband, son and daughter.  beautiful beach with white sand."
Fabulous beach,"Most amazing beach ,clean sea as well .plenty of beach cafes all clean ,no toilets though but lovely"
Club Mahindra Beach,Beach at Club Mahindra Varca beach is a mesmerizing atmospheres during these rainy days.Sound of heavy sea waves associated with wind just keep you nailed for hours.Best part the Beach is so clean and with limited crowd adds up touch of class.Life guards keeping watch on activity keep check on going overboard. Walking on the stretch of white sand a great exercise in morning and evening so you can enjoy Fish Beef Pork dishes without any guilt.
Great beach,It's a lovely clean beach. The waves are relentless so it's a lot of fun to be in the water. Just don't venture in a lot cause the undercurrent is really strong. Can't say if there are any shacks around here cause I went during the monsoons when shacks are closed at most beaches.
Vacation,"Clean and neat beach ,minimum crowd ,with a lovely beach restaurant ,great place to hang around ,rejuvenating experience"
Varca Beach,"Beach is beautiful, not crowded. Water is really warm. The evenings are better since the tide is higher. The mornings are a good time to do beach combing  - can find star fish, anemones etc washed out.  Some of the water sports activities are also available here."
Beautiful,"Even in this rainy season where the weather disturbances are at its peak, this beach is serene and beautiful. Definitely worth a visit with outdoor gaming etc. avoid slightly deeper seas as per weather for can never ever take a chance with Mother Nature."

Beautiful Beach,It’s a very clean and beautiful beach with white sands. If you are staying in South goa Varca beach is a good option to enjoy the white sands.
CLEAN BEACH,"nice and a clean beach in south Goa, very good for viewing sunset. there are lots of resorts, hotels, shacks along the beach. Evening or morning is the best time to go."
"Same as other beaches in Goa but kind of Private, hence best rating","Goa and Konkan area are full of beaches and hence in this sense there is nothing unique about this beach.But I was staying in Club Mahindra Varca and which makes this kind of a private beach! Hardly 15/20 people would be there on the beach and most of them are the people staying in the resort.This gives you all the peace, calm and space you crave for when you to any beach. Hence loved the beach experience here!"
