Very spiritual experience ,We have been to the Meenakshi Amman many times. This time we took in the night ceremony. It was great to participate in this ancient custom when the deity is put to sleep. The security is a bit stifling. Necessary I suppose. In the olden days we could take a camera inside. Now…
magnificent temple,Sri Meenakshy amman temple is a huge and magnificent temple with beautiful architectural marvel.With innumerable idols and a huge temple pond the temple is the central place of attraction at Madurai.

Meenakshi Amman an architectural marvel to see.   What an effort and skill is needed to come up with this marvellous tem,"Those of interest in ancient architecture apart from the temple visit have to see this temple and spend time to see every bit of the marvellous, painstaking carvings of the pillars and structure.   Really a way beyond imagination of how they managed to lift the granite stones,…"
Awesome,"What a structure ,hard to imagine how they built it.We visited in the evening,and there was no waiting to go in, there are guides in there and we had one show us around and explain things we would never have understood otherwise, we saw the evening ritual of taking their God Shiva to Meenakshi for the night,but non Hindus are not allowed into the inner sanctum.No cameras or phones allowed inside."
"Magnificent, Magnificent!",This temple is magnificent. It has four entrances and covers a large area in the center of Madurai. The buildings are very interesting. There are areas that are only for people who are Hindu. This temple is the main reason to go to Madurai. Woman must have their legs covered so I had to buy leggings from a shop across from the entrance before I was allowed to enter..
General,Madurai meenakshi temple is one of famous Hindu temple is on bank of river vaigai. The temple is dedicated to meenakshi i.e Parvathi and sundareshan shive. It big Dravidian style of temple  very wonderful temple worth to see
Stunning,totally mesmorised by the temples - spent an evening and morning there - wow - just stunning never seen anything like it - very interesting - colourful and still in use amazing - was worth the trip
Madurai,We had been there..it is beautiful and well architecture ..very old temple by more than 3000 years...very large...four gates..there after you have to go through big queue for darshan for Goddess Meenakshi...one has to see our Hindu culture ...if it is maintained properly then it is more beautiful then Taj Mahal... there is always heavy rush of public..hence you need more time to see the mandir as a whole.You must have time for 4-5 hours to see the temple.
No wonders of the world can match Meenakshi Amman temple architecture,"I visited this magnificient and puranic temple built thousands of years back.  Meenakshi amman is so blessing and divine. Main deity Lord Siva sannadhi is so blessing. Meenakshi amman temple has gigantic gopurams, perhaps the maximum in any temple in the world. Well maintained…"
Amasing,"This Big hindutempel has 12 Towers decoratet wit thousinds of coulered stone figurs, so beautiful absolutely worth seeing. A shame thoug, that the Lake with the Big lotusflower in the middle is sorrounded by an ugly metalfence, and that there are two ugly watercanons spreading…"
Stunningly beautiful,This is an enormous temple and we were pleased to have an excellent guide who was very informative.  To view the temple completely be prepared to spend at least two hours.
Beautiful Architecture,It is defintely worth a visit.The architecture is excellent which shows great worksmanship.Must see places atleast once in a lifetime
Really fabulous temple.,"This Meenakshi Sundareshwara Temple Complex is a massive affair. Getting in is a real effort probably easier getting into Fort Knox! No shoes, no large bags, no knees on show, no coloured sarongs, no watches, calculators, cancers, phones, videos - in fact nothing electrical! You…"
Great Temple but its carvings in ruins,"This is a great Indian heritage treasure, but unfortunately its surrounding temple properties especially the beautiful Mandarin is 100 % encroached by hawker shops, Its beautiful carvings are being destroyed inch by inch and the treasure of the carvings is being stolen or syphoned off overseas. The local authorities are ignorant about This great Indian Heritage that should be preserved and passed on from generations to generations but the Local are ROWDY people destroying it brick by brick."
Beautiful temple.,It is one of the most beautiful temples I have visited so far. Its work on stine is of very high class.
Must visit temple,"Wonder full design , must take 3 to 5 hrs at least to spend in this temple . Beautiful carvings & pilers . Most importantly worshiping  the divine mother  gives a blessed feeling & clam mind ."
Temple Darshan,"Wanted to visit this temple for the last 10 years and could finally only make it now. Darshan is available for all but money makes access to the deity closer and faster. Hire a guide thus temple has history.We went around 7:30 am the crowd was normal. The temples, pillar and carvings are beautiful.  I would even call them spectacular.  Notice the carvings of the God and goddesses, the details of muscles, fingers and jewelry. Be sure to visit the 1000 pillar museum. The temple has several accesses. We went through the east door and left our footwear in the car."
Meenakshi Amman Kovil in Madurai sublime masterpiece,"Meenakshi Amman Kovil in Madurai is a world famous Hindu temple. The main deity is Meenakshi Amman, an avatar of Parvati. The temple perhaps is 1,400 years old.The temple occupies a huge area of 14 acres. High walls surround the premises. Four massive gopurams or towers act as gateways to Meenakshi Amman Temple. The South Tower is the tallest, at 170 feet. The gopurams showcase a large number of Dravidian sculptures which depict mythological stories.Fourteen more gopurams are inside the temple walls. Each of them is a multi-storey structure. Sculptures cover the exteriors. The smaller gopuams serve as gateways to several shrines. The main two shrines are dedicated to Meenakshi and Sundareswarar. Other shrines house several deities including Ganesha and Murugan.The temple includes a number of large halls or mandapams. Many kings built the halls over time and they serve as resting places for devotees.Largest of the mandapams is the Hall of Thousand Pillars (Ayiramkal Mandapam). The hall has 985 pillars and was built in 1569. Beautiful sculptures adorn the pillars and walls. The five musical pillars just outside the Ayiramkal Mandapam are worth seeing.Daily pooja schedules are from 5:00 to 11:15 am and 4:30 to 10:00 pm. Palliarai Pooja is from 9:30 to 10:00 pm. In this special pooja, an idol of Sundareshwarar is carried on a palanquin to the shrine of Meenakshi. The idol is then brought back the next day morning.The temple strictly prohibits use of mobile phones and cameras inside the temple. Half pants, sleeveless tops and torch are taboo. Devotees have to leave them behind in lockers for a nominal fee."
"A must see ..busy, calm, spiritual with beautiful architecture.","This is one of the worships places that you must pay a visit, it gives u a clam and spiritual feeling to be there, it can be busy at times but patience needs to be followed. If you pay a little extra donation you are able to visit through a fast queue. Foreigners are allowed to…"
Amazing place!,Meenakshi is definitely a must of you visit Madurai. it is not because it is a UNESCO listed place but the beauty of the temple. Unfortunately no camera is allowed (due to terrorism threat) and you are not allowed to enter the main temple if you are not a Hinduist.
Evening Puja Visit Plus daytime return,"This is a huge temple complex with 4 main gates, we initially visited in the evening for the Puja (carrying Shiva to spend the night with Meenakshi).  No photos inside so cannot show what it was like.  No shoes or mobile phones - all have to be left in security boxes at…"
"There's a reason Meenakshi Amman is called ""The Taj Mahal of South India""","While this temple attracts a lot of tourists, I recommend going very early--6 am. or so--both because it's cooler and because you are there with ""devotees"" (worshippers) more than with tourists, so the ambiance is different.  Be aware of the strict access controls:  no bags, no…"
Not to be missed Madurai temple,"Huge temple with 4 ""gateways"" (north, south, east and west) to the huge temple with a large outdoor water pond courtyard and walkways about 150 yards in length. "
Poorly maintained rich monument!,Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple is one of the World Heritage Centres of UNESCO. But unfortunately it is not kept well. They ask you to remove the shoes. But the temple is very dirty. They can give some kind of use and throw socks as they do in the Taj Mahal. They have removed…
Divine Experience,No words to describe. Architectural Marvel from outside and inside. Truly divine from Inside. Four huge entry points however  has one entry point into the main temple. I visited temple on 29th Feb 2020 and even after three days my eyes are still exploring the temple.
Wonderful place for peace,"Hit the road at 6am ,back by 8:20am. No people and little traffic. A wonderful temple complex. Walking around it the previous evening we could not see the size of it. But that morning, mo electronics, phone camera etc are accepted, so no pictures, unfortunately. The complex is…"
Interesting ,"This was all very new to me. We had to take off shoes and store our cell phones and bags (you have to pay for storage) before entering the temple. It was beautiful though, and large enough to walk around for a while. No photos allowed. I think I would recommend a tour. We did…"
Meenakshi Amman Temple,It's a awesome temple.. so many things to see it.. nice one. Every statue looks different and beautiful.
Outstanding Temple,If you only had to visit a temple in India this would have to be the choice. It is breathtakingly beautiful!
"Absolutely magnificent, truly awe inspiring ","We had left plenty of time for this visit, which was just as well! From the moment you see the magnificent gopals you are entranced. The site is enormous but walking around is easy.  We saw this after visiting temple across Tamil Nadu,  but this was the icing on the cake! Our…"
ANOTHER AMAZING TEMPLE,"No cameras or phones are allowed within this temple complex and police are at all entries, they even objected to photos from outside but our guide soon pointed out that this was allowed. It was still very interesting and our guide took us to the roof top of a shop opposite to…"
Excellent structure,Stay away from local temple people as they keep asking for money by many means. Also temple priests are greedy for money (at least ones we faced to). Asking to donate compulsory in their hands for cracking coconut for which we had already paid the fees officially.
Temple Bliss ,A huge monolithic temple built in stone. A very well maintained with almost nil littering. The staff have kept the place neat. A very large temple complex housing temple of almost all Gods. Systematic queues with no rush. Temple is surrounded by shops. 
Wonderful divine experience,Wonderful and divine. Both the temples inside the complex- Amman and Swami were very beautiful. It is a must visit temple 
No photos allowed,"Total waste of time.  OK - this was the 12th temple we'd visited in 8 days .. so maybe we were templed out, but there was no mention prior to attending that you can NOT take phones, cameras, i-watches or any ""battery"" included device - a fire from a cell phone battery a couple…"
Shree Meenakshi Temple,"What a breath-taking place! A huge temple complex, built in the !7th century.There are 2 huge shrines, all brightly coloured.

Minakshi Temple,"The mighty Minakshi Temple. The gates of the temple rise to a height of 53 m, adorned with thousands of statues depicting figures from Indian mythology. At 9:00 pm, the gods' laying-pots are held. A special ceremony."
The Temple itself is very grandeous.,You have to check in your shoes and mobile and cameras outside as it is not permitted to take them inside. Have to ware long pants and shirt. Female is required to cover themselves as no sleeve less tops. Once paid for VIP line the Brahmins insist on doing pooja and request more…
Frantic and Fantastic!,"Strictly no photos are allowed of the inside, and some areas are off limits to non Hindus - otherwise, this is a truly awesome place to visit. The sheer size and quality of the Temple is stunning, and the numbers and friendliness of the visitors is wonderful. If you are anywhere…"
Amazing Temple with Idiotic Security rules ,Visited the temple with family. Had a 5 year old and a 1.5 yr old along. The temple looks amazing from outside. I did not enter the temple because of the Idiotic security. They do not allow and mobile or electronic accessory inside which makes sense as they don't want people to…
House of peace,"The temple has 4 main gates (gopuras) and another 8 inner towers. Some of them are more than 50m tall. The towers are fully decorated with figures of the life of Gods from bottom to top. It is hard to figure out how was built hundred years ago. Cameras not allowed, sit down for…"
Excellent,"A good place to see the architecture of old time, very well made. Camera & mobile are not allowed inside but facility is there to store in locker before entering. "
Temple,"Hi Madurai Menakshi Temple is one of the Tamil Nadu, India. ITS very beautiful temple and blessing people."
Most beautiful temple,We had a very amazing experience in visiting this temple.  We had a very good darshan of the presiding deity and being there spiritually most satisfying for us.
worth 2 visits ,"Very nice around sunset as the light is beautiful! Don't miss the museum in the 1000 pillars room... magnificent... even if all the added parts (vitrines, lightning...) are ruining the beauty of this place.  The sculptures are sumptuous. "
This is one of Indias finest temples well worth a visit.,This is quite spectacular and grand. Visit as early as you can as very busy and before too hot. Strict code of dress and you will be examined by police for check.Were busy cleaning when we visited in preparation for big celebration and you are not allowed in some areas.Granite work remarkable and some sexy intimate ones if you look closely.Suggest a guide to help you understand or visit at night to see the closing ceremony where Shiva icon is carried to Goddess Parvat's chamber for night to celebrate their celestial Union.
"Needs no introduction, Identity of madurai","You can not miss this temple if in maduraiA must must go placeAfter darshan, take some time out & relax"
First VIsit,The temple is so awesome. The place is so cooling that you will enjoy all the awesome structures.It was indeed a great experience for me .
Great expirence,This must be the main attraction of Madurai. The temple is huge and there's a lot to explore.Don't miss the huge market around the temple (start from the market in front the east tower). This is by far the biggest market i have ever seen.
Love to be here. ,One of my favorite place in madurai. Feel like heaven when we are inside the temple. The pool itself give u peaceful meditation.
Tremendous Temple Tour,"A visit to this famous temple is certainly worthwhile, although you need to be prepared to adhere to strict rules if you wish to gain entry. We took the advice to walk around the external walls of the complex first to admire the 4 towers. We then left all our belongings in safe storage to tour inside. The temple is still in use today, so it is important to dress respectfully, covering shoulders and legs to be permit entry. You will be searched upon entry. Photography inside is strictly forbidden, and whilst you can take you mobile inside, if you’re caught taking photos your phone will be confiscated, never to be returned.Still in use today, the temple is a sight to behold with lamp lit corridors leading to shrines, the hall of 1000 pillars and a central water feature. It’s highly recommended you engage the services of a guide, so you understand what you’re looking at."
Wonderful site and experience,"One of several staggering beautiful temple sites in Tamil Nadu - certainly the biggest.  We were there during the Pongal harvest festival and there were flocks of exquisite saris moving around to add to the beauty.  We had a guide and I think it adds so much to the experience.  Yes, visually it is awesome and you can see that, but a little interpretation fills out the experience so much more - and will help with getting you around to good positions to take in the beauty.  We returned for the night ceremony - definitely get a guide to get you in good positions at the three key locations and to minimise impacting on the views of the devotees for whom the ceremony means more than for non-hindus.  You will have to remove your shoes - no cameras - you will be searched.  If you go without local knowledge - plan for plenty of travel time - very busy on the roads and if you are in a car - some of the narrow streets an auto can go to shorten travel time, your car won't be able to negotiate. Auto not essential, but helps.  Wondrous place."
Well organized Darshan,"Crowds, but organized and no melee or jostling. It took us two hours moving in the queue. A fleeting darshan is allowed though. And public conveniences need to be better organized."
wonderful temple,it is great place to visit ...at least once in life time we should go there to experience richness of ancient  architecture. check the time of temple closure or else u have to wait for more than 40 min.
marvelous architecture,"marvelous architecture, govt should spend some money and get the some infrastructure developed (roads / carpark)"
Get a good guide,Enjoyed the visit to this amazing place. A good Gide really helps to understand the site and its meaning. We found one inside who spoke good English and was very knowledgeable - and it really added to the experience.
Putting Shiva to bed ceremony,This temple has to be experienced in many ways. First - it is an architectural wonder. Second - it is a chaotic and disorganised experience. Third - it has an amazing ceremony of putting Shiva to bed at the end of the day. This is one place where you need to prepare in advance…
Devotional Environment,This temple is very well known for its well crafted entrances. There are four entry points in the temple. Still no dress code imposed on devotees......If you pay more money you will get chance to get your number early......ticket counters are there for the same.......We went…
Absolutely Amazing,"This place was incredible, so busy but so interesting with people from all over India coming to make their devotions. Our guide was very good and introduced us to people there for special purposes like the upcoming birth of a baby and another family following a wedding. Quite a…"
Large complex with plenty to see,"The thousand pillar hall was well worth a visit as it had some amazing sculptures and statues, but some of the museum exhibits were not too well maintained"
Epic song of Indian Craftsmanship.,A great place to be visit at least once in a lifetime in India. The temple has four different entries to be inn. Myself personally advice to purchase a ticket for the darshan as the queues are very long. Every corner of the temple is full of  Dravidian architecture which keeps…
Superb temple,"Stone carved temple. It's truly a magnificent work of art. You have to go to feel it. But you must have guide to understand the complex.  We didn't get a guide. Too much of security, absolutely no control of arrogant and greedy priests. I witnessed a priest refused to accept Rs…"
Even by normal Indian Styandards this is an impressive religious site,"Unfortunately, you can't take cameras inside, but I can totally see why. Very, very impressive Hindi temple architecture etc. Some areas only open to Hindus, the whole place is bare feet, no shorts, no short skirts, covered shoulders (though nobody seems to enforce the latter…"
Typical Chaotic Indian Temple,India excels in making its iconic temples as chaotic and dirty and mismanaged as ever thanks to the pandas in these temples who are like the mafia. THis is one of the biggest tragedies in this country. And of course the desis who flock here in blind faith do not care or bother.…
Divine ,This was my second visit with my family and friends..  Had a lovely darshan of goddess parvati and lord Shiva...  Very nicely managed shrine
Pride of India,Madurai Meenakshi amman temple stands as a historical marvel of Pandya kings who ruled Madurai . This temple was slated to be one of the wonders of the world. A must visit place in life time
Peace & Beauty,"Jai Maa Meenakshi 🙏🏽  Visited in January with Family and Kids (less than 5). We reached temple west gate by 8:15 PM and took entry after depositing footwear , mobiles and Smart watch. There was good rush , especially of ayyapa followers but it was systematically managed by the…"
Stunning,The size and scale of the temple has to be seen to be believed - quite overwhelming. The sheer number and complexity of the thousands of carvings both inside and out is incredible. It is busy and crowded but an absolute must see.
Religous and historical,"A large temple that dates back several centuries and according to some a few thousand years old. Get there in the morning as the crowds are less, keep congnisant of the hours when it is open. A strict security check does not allow visitors to carry anything in, including wallets…"
"Huge, crowded temple","This is a gargantuan complex - more like a fort than a temple with 4 huge entrances that encapsulate acres of temple area inside. The structure along with its wall carvings, statues etc. is well restored. The main sanctum ( as it is with most popular hindu temples ) houses a…"
Wonderful architecture,Must visit even if you are non Hindu or an atheist. At least to experience richness of ancient Indian architecture.
Had an excellent visit. ,"We spent over 2 and a half hours. It is a complex that deserves that kids of time. It is truly a bhavya temple. Don't miss the thousand pillars monument as well. If you come to Tamil Nadu, do not miss this. Can enter on any of the 4 sides, depending on the day and where you are. "
Divine place,Madurai can be combined with visit to Kodaikanal or Munnar. Meenakshi temple visit is worth for both architecture and religious reason. If you are a devotee plan at least 2-3 hrs. Regular day 5-10 k visitors are expected. During holidays this can be 20-25k++. Parking near the…
Overshadowed by draconian policies,"Of all the temples I have visited in India, this temple comes out as the most troublesome to visit. They have ridiculously strict policies on what you can bring and can't. Bring the smallest bag you can, forget even tote bags. They do not allow bigger bags, mobile phones or any…"
Excellent ,"V v good temple.larger than life.what an architecture, must must watch in your lifetime..highly recommend "
Dharsan at 10:30 PM!,We went to this temple on 25th Dec 2019 night at 8:15 PM as we got late at Thiruparankundram and the next day the temple is closed for Solar eclipse. There was a big queue at that time itself. But we went stand in a free dharsan queue. Normally the temple would be closed by 9:30…
Beautiful and marvelous,I have never ever seen this kind of beautiful temple and its structure in my life. Its so beautiful and wonderful
Meenakshi Amman Temple,"We went around evening time. You have to deposit mobile phone, ladies bag etc. at the gate. There is nominal charge, but best not to carry them as you save time in formalities of depositing and retrieving. There is always a big queue. Special darshan ticket is Rs.100, but that…"
Wide,History and information and culture   People was friendly in special culture  Quite ariea food around you and cheap
Beautiful Temple Complex !!,Our visit to the Meenakshi Amman Sundershwarar Temple at Madurai was beautiful.

The guide also…
The Meenakshi Temple,"Meenakshi Temple is a historic Hindu temple located on the southern bank of the Vaigai River.

Meenakshi sundareswarar darshan,Long wait during school holiday season. Arrangements for darshan was well organised. Plan to go early in the morning to avoid long waits
Zero maintenance,The temple earns crores of rupees every day but no effort has been dedicated to the comfort of the devotees. The tickets aren't available online so there's a long queue and chaotic crowding at the South gate. There is at least a 3-5 hour line to finally get the darshan. The…
Stunning! ,A must see if you're in the area and our main reason to visit Madurai. Photos just don't do it justice! 
Temple visit,"Temple is so big with four dwaras. Temple can he attributed to a one full village. Well architect designed, a great temple. In my opinion it is impossible in one day to complete the seeing of temple."
A very pleasant experience,"Meenakshi Amman temple needs no introduction. It is one of the greatest temples in our country. We visited there recently and had a very good darshan of the Goddess and the Lord.The temple opens at 5:00 AM. While it is advised to reach there as early as possible after it opens, there always is a long winding queue. Especially during festivals and on Fridays (Friday is considered auspicious for the goddess). We landed up on a Friday, a day after the temple had been closed due to a solar eclipse. One can imagine the crowd. Here I must compliment the temple management for the logistics and crowd management. Overall the temple was quite clean and well organised. No wonder it has won many accolades.Note: There are two types of darshan, free and paid. The paid darshan costs 50 ₹ for Goddess alone and 100 ₹ for both Meenakshi and Sundareswarar. Though the paid darshan is called ""Fast"" it is likely to take 2-3 hours, so be prepared. The other places include pottramarai tank and 1000 pillar Mandapam. Note cellphones and other recording devices are not allowed. There are shops that open early and allow pilgrims to leave their in their premises. Of course they also try to sell their products on collection of footwear. These shops are mostly government run shops like khadi and are not aggressive or pushy if one says no.As with any temple beware of touts."
Spectacular Weekend @Madurai,"The plan to visit Meenakshi temple was perfectly executed through a busy weekend trip to Madurai. It was a Sunday, so we had to be early in the morning to be near to the temple premises. You have to deposit mobile phones, shoes and all baggages in the temple cloak room before proceeding to enter the temple. Upon entering through the gate, one will be spellbound seeing the finest architecture of ancient India. There are 2 possibilities for getting a glimpse of Goddess Meenakshi, 1. Free Entry 2. Paid ticket of Rs. 100. The overall atmosphere inside the temple arena becomes heavenly, pacified by the peacefulness and charming rays emanating from the various deities and the recitation of ancient verses. There are lots to know about the background behind each god/Goddess being worshipped inside the various corners of the temple. For us, it took 4-5 hours for getting into such details to experience the beauty of temple design. Food in the form of prasadam is also available inside the temple. But no toilets...Afternoon, you can visit nearby areas to shop, as you wish. A lot of trains connect Madurai to Chennai in the evening and night which travellers can plan accordingly. Overall, a mesmerising place to be in, The Meenakshi Temple,Madurai...."
my visit to meenakshi amman temple,It is wonderful temple to visit and see the sculptures and also to experience the divinity.In around temple was built  during King Pandiyan and built by tirumalai naicker.Avoid the month december and January or be prepared to stand in queue like tirupathi. it would take 2-3 hours to have the darshan since the people who are going to sabarimala and Adi para sakthi devotees are visiting this temple during these two months.
Architecture at its best,We always amazed the way temple was built which is centuries old. Great architecture and history behind. Famous for Lord Shiva and Meenakshi Amman. Spend atleast half a day to look around the temple and interiors of temple. Usually crowded specially with local worshippers visit in huge numbers. Just divine and peace inside. Lots of shops outside surrounding the temple. Must to do while in Madurai.
Mixed feelings ,"No mobiles, leather belt or stuff allowed . Only cash allowed inside.Two type or basically 3 type of darshan are there..normal if you could stand in long queue.. VIP.. 100rs ticket... smaller line but waiting and 3rd is vip ticket+ directly pay to pandits so you can get the best…"
Temple trip thats Peaceful ,"Without mobile phones, visit takes you back ages and ensures you see and enjoy the experience without busy taking pictures.

Architectural marvel,Such a stunning temple of Lord Meenakshi and Lord shiva with so many wonders. Can't even imagine how they built it and the brilliance in architecture those days. The paintings in aayiramkal mandabam ( have 1000pillars) shows the story of kings and their war and celebrations (…
Famous Temple In Madurai - Every Should Visit,Madurai Annamalai Travels provides devotional packages. Our first temple will be Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple. We will explain the culture and history of meenakshi temple 
Excellent Historical place Full of Beauty,one of the most auspicious place in Madurai.  I had visited temple in early morning still it had  queue. This temple is excellent example of how architecture to be made. It has idols of every Hindu God
"Beautiful architecture, divine sculptures and Meenakshi's grace","visited this temple few times, latest visit on 6th December that too on a Friday morning, during the return trip from sabharimala yatra. First thing you should note is Mobiles are not allowed inside and hence it it better if you keep it your hotel rooms. Next one is that if you really want to see the temple architecture, you must at least spend two hours apart from the waiting time for darshan of Meenakshi and Chokkanathar. Presiding diety is Meenakshi, as the name of the temple goes.While entering please note the direction of the entrance otherwise if you exit through another gate finding the way to your place of stay will be difficult. Darshan waiting time depends on the particular day rush and you may decide either to buy special darshan tickets or go by free darshan. You must not miss seeing 1000 pillar mandapam, where they have exhibited statues of various historical periods and also somewhat about the history of the temple. If you are having infants, temple authorities will serve hot milk for infants, as a very special and unique service to children. the trouble of touts/agents is minimal in this temple but if you want you can use the service of a guide for Rs.100/- upwards. After darshan take rest by doing at least meditation of 10 minutes in the temple, you will find real inner peace."
An Amazing Place,"A Beautiful Temple with Splendid Architecture and History.. The Place is known for Tamil Literature. Madurai Meenakshi , Kasi Visalakshi and Kanchi Kamatch i are revered Godesses in Hindu Tradition. The Temple is always crowded and it is advisable to get special Entry Tickets.But the Darshan is well organised. Take your time to visit all the Sannadhis and aslo enjoy the magnificent sculptures. It is advised to visit in the mornings."

Fine South Indian Temple,"The Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple is one of the most significant Hindu temples there is and links the 3 major traditions of Hinduism, being Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism. This temple is an architectural wonder. Although it’s fairly typical of South Indian Hindu temples,…"

Mobiles, Electronic Gadgets and bags are not allowed inside the temple for that they have proper counter to submit and get the token to collect it back.Getting a speed up line by paying Rs 100/50 is better. Note that both Rs 100 and Rs 50 fast line are the same but 100 Rs for 2 temple entry and 50 for just 1."
Place worth a visit,Fortunate to be in the temple.Full of positive vibes. Must visit for every hindus to have Indian culture & tradition. Music sound on stone at Thousand pillar statue is owesone.
Very nice,Interesting temple. Very lively with a lot of people inside the temple. Ceremony in the evening was amazing.
Menakshi temple.,Madurai is incomplete without visiting this temple.Its huge pillars with encricate art work is mind blowing. The goddess Menakshi is ever glowing and powerful.
Lovely Architecture,Excellent architecture. Beware of lot of taut's that are trying to sell fake artefacts outside the temple. Please get a guide to explain you the temple. Foreign tourists and non hindus are not allowed within the temple. Getting a speed up line by paying Rs 100/50 is better. Note that both Rs 100 and Rs 50 fast line are the same.
Don’t take guide,"This place is not a tourist place - it’s hindu temple for warship. Guides charge too much and all photos (even with mobile) are forbidden - so, it’s a place for worship not for tourist visits."
Divine,"Madurai's Icon.You can feel the vibration of divinity almost everywhere in this temple. A must visit. Cameras, phones, lighters, ciggies, Bluetooth headset, and any electronic devices are not allowed inside the temple due to the recent burning at one of its Gopurams."
Great architecture but now a money making Machine,Went with the family for Darshan of goddess meenakshi and lord shiva. The architecture is imposing and the temple had some seriously amazing paintings and artwork. However good things end there.The temple is under the control of greedy priests. They will charge for everything from darshan to aarti. Better to go early morning as evening sees huge rush and the wait time for Darshan can be close to 4 hours. No amenities for young kids. You can't even feed little kids.
Tour ,"Very nice place and temple, near by hotel jc residency this temple was traditionally hotel is centrally located fairly close to airport and station"
Amazing temple,"This is one of the few Hindu temples we've seen that's in perfect condition.  Apparently that's because it's also one of the most recent - being only a few hundred years old.The detail in the carvings the extensive color restoration, and the overwhelming number of columns and carvings make this a stand out among temples.  Well worth a visit.  You cannot wear shoes here and both men and women must dress with their legs and shoulders covered."
One day trip to madurai and rameswaram temple,"It was really an awesome experience to have a trip to madurai meenakshi and rameswaram temple. Was a pilgrimage, but it was really amazing because of the historical places and those temples architectural sculptures. We cannot even think about the marvelous sculptures in big rocks.Rameswaram was famous for its beautiful sea and it's beaches. Religiously very famous. Rama sethu is an another miracle which was made centuries ago. A lot of religiously and historically famous places in rameswaram and in madurai.Old markets will warmly welcome you."
A man made marvel,"It is situated at madurai, you can simply amazed by the ambiance and size of the temple, lord shiva and mata parvati together worshiped here..."
WOW Not just another temple,As soon as this place becomes visible the WOW factors comes into play. A large site but leave your electronics elsewhere as scanning is the go if you wish to enter the site. On a side note check out the Meenakshi emporium just west of the northern tower. You may be pleasantly surprised.

Huge temple with Beautiful Architecture,"Visited this temple after 3 years, Approach road allround the temple is being relaid and renovated.Looks better, more space for walking. It is a huge temple with 4 entrances with Rajagopuram. Nice architecture and place is kept neat and clean.Had  special darshan within one hour waiting."
Holistic place,"The temple itself is self explanatory...well known and ancient and famous...parking is not available in the vicinity so need to walk after parking at suitable place ...there are ques most of the time so general waiting is there but good arrangements,if happen visit in late evening hours may get a chance to see the there night ceremony"
Very popular temple,Anyone visiting Madurai will want to visit this temple. The town is known for this temple. It's huge and a historical marvel. One thing that put me off is the fuss around restrictions on carrying mobile phone and things like that and they make a very bad experience of visiting the temple.There's ticket that you need to buy if you don't want to walk through a serpentine queue setup even when there is not much of crowd!! I find that deplorable that they differentiate people in a place of worship by your economic capability.
Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple,Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple is a very famous temple in Madurai. It is located in Madurai City of TamilNadu.
A must visit,Madurai is synonymous with this temple and so one has to visit this holy place... Mobile is not permitted but they provide good locker facilities... overall good arrangements
