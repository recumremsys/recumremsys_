Vacation trip,It was a enjoyable ride after quite a longtime. Really enjoyed. Elephants were well maintained and neat.
Most Enjoyable,Very nice tourist attraction spot in elephant junction. Elephant Savari with bath and shower. Excellent ride. Nice place. Overall best tourism place.
Horrible experience with sad Elephants.,"So we thought we were visiting an elephant sanctuary. When we got to this place we saw just two sad looking elephants that had chains around their legs and were providing entertainment to the tourists by giving them rides and laying in really dirty water so tourists could bathe them. If you really care for animals then stay away from this place. I asked the guides how they were caring for the elephants and they said they get plenty of food and water. That's really not the point. These places should be banned, elephants are not there to provide entertainment. I've made a complaint to the tour company as I specifically said at the time of booking that I do not want to go to a place that exploits animals.‚Ä¶"
Favalou,It was like dream come true. We did 30 minutes Elephant ride which were unbelievable experience for both of us.. üòäüòé
Chained wild animals. ,"I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable knowing that these majestic animals are chained up overnight. Also: The weight of carrying tourists and a trainer on an elephant's back is grueling - and can cause severe damage to an elephant's spine. ""Instead of smooth, round spinal disks, elephants have sharp bony protrusions that extend upwards from their spine,"" Carol Buckley, president of Elephant Aid International, said.    I couldn‚Äôt get out fast enough. ‚Ä¶"
Amazing creatures,"Several centres allow elephant related activities like safaris, feeding, bathing with elephants, etc.The activities are really wonderful.Children specially enjoy them a lot.A must do activity in Thekkady."
Wonderful Elephants ,"Our visit to the elephant sanctuary was a magical experience. My wife had a ride on a 28 year old elephant called Meenakshi and I was able to take some fantastic photos. We were also allowed to feed the elephant with bananas, which was also lovely."
Elephant ride ,We stay at the elephant court and mr Kamal from elephant court suggests us to try elephant ride it will be good experience for you so We had done elephant ride at elephant junction It was like dream come to ...thank you
Good experience,"The place is nice and well maintained. The elephant ride was amazing, my year old baby too had fun. I was impressed by the photography skill of Mahut. He clicked nice pictures and a video. Although it was very crowded they were managing well and giving the elephants too breaks as needed. The elephants were well maintained."
Joyful Elephant ride ,"After discussing our driver ,Went to elephant junction with 2 kids in morning around 9 ..Kids below 5 years are free for elephant ride .It costs 400/- rs for abt 15 minutes elephant ride . Elephant bath was also available ,but that time it was bit cold in morning ,so avoided that . Overall a must visit place , specially if u hv kids with u ."
Highlight of my holiday,"Fantastic experience, riding, feeding and washing an elephant. There are only a few elephants in this sanctuary, and all seem very well looked after by the handlers."
Good rides ,Elephant ride is a good attraction but the price is too high it is 400rs per person for elephant ride for 10-15 minutes and if you want elephant bath it will cost 1000rs per person you can also visit other attractions there like kathakally but martial art performance is a must‚Ä¶
Average,Okiesh....they charged me for one and half hour programme however.....completed in about one hour. On asking they said some issue...
Loving Experiance,"We go with Elephant Ride which was amazing experience but due to lack of time we did not experience about elephant bath and other activities , ride was around 20 min but was very expensive ..     Elephant ride experience are really enjoyable"
Excellent morning here - so good we returned again,"This is an excellent venue - 4 elephants are here.  All animals are well cared for and are not mistreated, the men working here all talk to the animals and they in turn carry out their instructions My grandson loved it - we returned 3 times so he could ride the elephants, wash‚Ä¶"
Loving expereince,"Took 3 elephants for the kids to go with their mothers, a well enjoying ride for close to 30 minutes. the seats are strong enough to hold the weight and a mahout is there for support"
Poor experience ,"Very expensive for what it was and didn‚Äôt feel 100% comfortable or confident the elephants were being looked after well. Paid for a 2 hour ‚Äúexperience‚Äù ride lasted no more than 5mins and it was all over in 1 hour. They say their having ‚Äúproblems‚Äù with the forest department and should have walked then and got a refund but they convinced us to stay, definitely regret this decision"
Not value for money ,They offer different packages starting from Random 400 for elephant safari for half an hour. But the safari is only for 10 minutes and for a very short distance.
Great Experience,Took an elephant ride with two toddlers. It was very comfortable and safe. The elephants are well trained.
Must visit,"Must visit, it's fun having elephant shower, waiting is more, suggested to book on reaching and come back to enjoy. It's really fun for kids."
Visit to Elephant Junction ,"Very pathetic experience. They promise an elephant ride of 20 mins and they literally have 2 mins.. After waiting for over an hour you get a 2 min ride!! Over and above that they were asking us for more money in the name of ‚Äúdakshina‚Äù, a Hindu religious thing which you can‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
Enjoyed thoroughly,"Kids will thoroughly enjoy this place.starting from elephant ride ,bathing ,shower from elephant trunk,feeding and photo session everything is perfect .must visit if you have kids."
Enjoying a splendid moment with the elephants,"In the middle of the forest, this is an unique moment to get closer with the elephants. You can feed them or take a shower with them. Or walk into the jungle. The elephants are very loved by the people and very well protected. Once rescued from the jungle as babies, they grow‚Ä¶"
Awful place.  To be avoided even if on a tour like me. I'd give it a zero rating if I could,"In todays changing world and with the beter awareness of how we,as humans are supposed to treat animals I was shocked and saddened to see how the elephants here are treated and also that so many people seemed to think that it was OK When  they are not being  continuously ridden‚Ä¶"
Great Place....,I visited here with my family of 8 persons. Its a nice and clean place. We took 2 hours package and they gave us all the things as promised. The main attraction is Elephant Bath a must thing to do. They have kept seperate clean water tank for Elephant Bath. After elephant bath‚Ä¶
Well-loved elephants,"I was reluctant to visit an elephant place where they were chained up but my friend convinced me to ""just connect with them"" which I did and it was a wonderful experience.  We fed them pineapples and to connect with these magnificent mammals and to see the genuine care & love of‚Ä¶"
OK,"Can watch elephants moving around available for a ride for a shower & moving around taking trees & eating leaves,but all activities are at a cost"
Nothing great,"Elephant Junction is located near kumily near thekkady. There are three female elephants there named laila, meena and meenakshi. We visited it on 01 Dec 2019. That time elephant ride was stopped by state authorities. I fully support the authorities as it will definitely reduce‚Ä¶"
A good joint for children and adults ,Our guide took us to this place where elephants were being nurtured. When we reached they were being bathed.  Two big elephants were brought out for us to ride.  The children were thrilled to ride along with their parents. It cost Rs 300 per adult for half an hour. 
bucket list ticked,this was my one of the best experience...we booked the ticket a day before as its a peak season so easier in terms of rush time....thn we reach activity area at 11:00 a.m.  Their we change clothes and thn got a elephant bath first. Its one of the most overwhelmed thing I have‚Ä¶
Absolutely disgusting place,"Please please please avoid this place at all costs!!! I was recently in India for a friends wedding, there was 20 of us on this trip. After the wedding we all did some site seeing and were told to head to this ‚Äúelephant sanctuary‚Äù well what we witnessed at this so called ‚Äúsanctuary‚Äù was nothing short of absolutely cruelty!! It was horrific and actually brought me to tears! There were 3 elephants I saw all with chains, being ridden with at least 3 people on them! Also being beaten with sticks! The sadness in their eyes was just horrific. It was absolutely sickening to know these beautiful animals were being treated in this way. I will also be contacting WWF regarding this terrible act of cruelty to animals..."
Sadness beyond belief ,"I was deeply saddened by what I saw the day I visited this place.  The elephant waiting for families to ride approached the platform only after being struck with a stick by one on the handlers. The elephants looked ill, one elephant was chained by its front and back leg on a concrete platform rocking back and forth repetitively.  I could see and feel the sadness here most of my friends became visually upset and had returned to the bus. It‚Äôs truly an upsetting place and you leave feeling very angry that this business seem to find this acceptable to treat animals this way for others entertainment/enjoyment. I was with several other professionals who will be reporting what they saw this is not acceptable these poor elephants.  Please please please do not attend and avoid at all costs if you love animals you will be upset by what you see and feel."
Good experience,It was a good experience  .charges were 400 per person .children less then 5 were free. They take you for a short ride on elephant so if you or your kids have never sat on an elephant then you can try otherwise you don't see any views.
Excellent elephant shower,Very good for children. Should get swimming costume along. Most fun is getting a shower with elephants and riding an elephant.
Elephant ride on ,"Took a 30 mins ride, but felt pity for the elephants. Not suitable for animal lovers. Ride is also expensive"
Very exciting for children as well as adults,Visited elephant junction during our stay in thekkedy Kerala. It was our first experience for elephant ride. Though it was short but very exciting. The charges for ride are 400 per person. They also provide 1 hour jungle safari and bath with elephant services.
Enjoyed more than expected,"We initially regreted to go there. But, we enjoyed a lot.Everyone should enjoy this and worth visiting and shows like kathakali, martial arts and 12d show is wonderful"
Enjoyed feeding Elephants,Elephants are trained and our kiddo enjoyed feeding elephants.. Must visit with kids..  but a little expensive.. per head 200 for feeding and clicking pics..
A sad sight,"I couldn't help but feel for the elephants, I went there only because of uninformed family members. The elephants look miserable, the people who work there hit them with sticks/whips don't know what that was, they are all in chains. Forced to carry 4-5 people on their backs all day. This place needs to get shut down."
One of a kind experience,Experience speaks more than words. Though the time spent with elephant seemed to be less but each moment spent was worth every penny.
Wonderful Experience,We had the opportunity to feed the elephant and take pictures with her. This experience was truly amazing and worth spending. We could take ride and shower with elephant as due to rains it was closed. May be next time surely we will visit and do it.
enjoyed Elephant ride,"had fun while taking an Elephant ride, we clicked photos  & videos.it was very memorable, one should take a elephant ride here if not experienced earlier"
Lakshmi: The Female Elephant,"This is my 1st Elephant ride in my life. We visited the Elephant camp as a main attraction in Thekkady. The ride was for 20 mints into the forest.  Mr. Prabhath was my guide of the day and sweet Lakshmi, the female elephant was calm and beautiful. This attraction is great for families. You can take photos with elephants and trainers. SEE photos."
"Amazing trip with wonderful people, great experience with elephants!","The atmosphere at Elephant Junction was great and excellent place for families.The all day package was great and the program was well organized with activities.People are nice at Elephant Junction, very friendly like family.The trip with the Elephant and having pictures taken with Traditional dress was nice.I would recommend for the all day package, bring camera to capture the unforgettable moments."
Elephant ride was good,"Since it was off-season when we visited, there was hardly any wait time. They have more than 6 elephants, all looking healthy and well maintained. We took just the half hour ride. The walk through the plantation in that area was good. The mahout and one other guy accompany the elephant, and they also take pictures for us. It looks like a family owned business, and I guess they treat their elephants well."
Kerala trip ,Two people can take a ride at the cost of Rs400/-pp. Sometimes three on one elephant. Although it's fun but we should also see how the elephant is being treated
Enjoyable ride,Enjoyable ride through the awesome cardamom plantation. Elephants are really friendly and we're so kind to possible with us for pic. A life time experience.
Horrible conditions for animals!!!,"HORRIBLE AND DISCUSTING place! We were a group of people from Norway, Hol√∏and, Spain, Ukraine and Argentina and we all, every single one of us, were shocked by how were animals treated there. We asked for our money back after very first activity after we saw the elephant with a chain on his neck and feets walking around people with a tree in his mouth like in the circus.The elefant rider used a chains on elephants foot and his metal stick with a hook to climb the elefant and ride it and give comands. It was a discusting show made by the owners of the Elefant junction. We were shocked!I couldnt believe that the human can make that kind of circus show just for making money. On the way back we saw other elephants locked in cages that were barely same size as the elefants  with a mount of plastic trash behind them. Tha man who sold tuckets and explained us the program was walking with us as a guide  was ingorint all our questions about chains on elephans necks and feet and riders who punch them and give comands in an agressive way! That place should be closed permanently and the owner should be punished for teating elephants this way! Never again! Not recommended for any person who has respect for animals!"
Elephant ride,"We had a different experience @ elephant junction, we booked package activity here,  includes ride,  showerbating, etc. Recommended"
Elephant Ride.,My Kids loved the Ride.It was their First Ride on an Elephant.The were so excited..it was a fantastic Experience.
incredible to see the elephant,"At the elephant experience you can watch them hurl trees, feed them bananas, and give them a bath.  30 minute and 10 minute rides are available, including having the trainers take photos of you with the animals.  Worth doing!"
A worth experience,This is a must place to visit if you would like to have a good elephant ride. Per person is about 350 INR and kids below 5 are free. They are very friendly and are very happy to explain to you about them in detail. But beware of private tours guys wandering there. Please don't fall into their words. All the places you can go by yourself.
Must try if you are going with kids ,"If are going with kids , this is a must try . I went with my 2 year old son. He enjoyed the ride . They have change rooms . You can enjoy the elephant bath if you have a spare dress."
Good,Some unique experience. 15-20 minutes of ride.They have 2-3 options .one is simple elephant ride another one is ride + bath .They charge for simple ride RS 500
Short ride,The elephant ride is a short twenty min ride inside a compound..good for a short ride but could have been outside in jungle
Elephant ride,Must try the elephant rides..it's lot of fun..esp for children...they would let you take pics along with the elephant. 
Elephant rides ,"Good experience,need to provide safety gear to tourist riding elephants...need to provide proper washroom & changing  facilities ."
One time activity of Elephant ride,"Looks like very simple to do elephant ride. But, it is really painful, every step taken by giant is like travelling in auto especially on pot holes road. You can do this activity once to get the real feel of travelling on animals. Next, is you should stretch your legs almost 170‚Ä¶"
Good experience,"If you are interested in Elephant ride this is one of the best options in Thekkady. The location is suitable , has a lot of tress and passes through cardamom plantation. They have other activities like bathing elephant, feeding elephant etc."
A different experience ,"Elephants are a inseparable of Indian life and cloture , in Kerala you can enjoy a elephant riding with a guide who explains you a lot of surprising matters about elephants . "
Avoid it,Pet elephants. You would feel bad for them. For me it did not make any sense to feed or ride or bathe the elephant. People seemed to enjoy photography. 
"Feed the elephants, avoid the rides","The Elephant Junction is located in a semi-scenic place in Thekkady. The staffs at the reception are friendly.   You have different options here - 1. Take an elephant ride for 25 minutes (Rs 400 per head), 2. Allow elephants to splash water on you and 3. Feed the elephant (Rs‚Ä¶"
super time with gentle gaints,"loved the time spent with the elephant named Meenakshi, 17 year old elephant. an obedient and friendly elephant, she loved her bath and scrubbing."
Good place ,They have 4 elephants and is less crowded with tourists than tusker trail on the main road. Staff is friendly . For ‚Çπ1500 you can bathe and elephant and take rides 
Good place,This is a very good place to visit with children. Go for the one hour ride it is better. Very clean place
Getting a shower from an elephant is a great experince,If you can park your scepticism about captive and trained elephants being used for touristy purposes then this is worth a visit.  The animals appear to be well cared for and the staff seem to be considerate with them. We had not seen any elephants up close in our visit to the‚Ä¶
Paisa wasool!,The ride was so amazing just the thing that locals were skipping the que by taking advantage of the their language. Rest the elephants and ride are too worth. 
This isn‚Äôt a sanctuary,"I would really discourage others from visiting here. If you have a quick google of ethical elephant sanctuaries, you‚Äôll see you should never ride them, (they train them by ‚Äòbreaking the spirit‚Äô of the babies to break them in). Hourly bathing with humans is also a stressful‚Ä¶"
Good place to visit.,Nice elephant ride ampng spice garden and jungle. The place is full of big jackfruit trees. It's a good experience to ride an elephant. 
Kumily,Good place for Elephant ride and elephant shower.Charges are expensive.Good place with spices garden.
Elephants treated badly,"The place is ok, slightly messed up when it comes to arrangement. The staff was mix of friendly and rude. The guys who handle elephants were rude mainly. Using sticks to hit the elephants. The guy handling our elephant was drunk. Paid 1500 per person but left within half an hour seeing bad behaviour towards animals. Kids may enjoy this so go for basic Rs. 400 ride. Don‚Äôt waste money on other higher priced options."
Good for kids,"Thekkady is known for üêò. This place offers elephant ride,magical shows, kalari fights, musical fountain, kathkkali dance, Gavi escapes, jungle safari. They are charging RS.400 for 20 minute ride for an adult abive 6 years of age."
Nice Ride and Elephant Bath,"My husband and I took my mother here when she came to visit and we had a great experience. We got to feed the elephants mango's, go for a nice ride, and our favorite part was giving the elephant a bath! We also got to sit on the elephant and get sprayed from his trunk. They have cold showers to bath and change after. Friendly staff."
Well maintained and properly managed ,"The facility was good,  the rates were reasonable too.  The elephants were in good numbers and seems they are well fed and maintained.  Safe and enjoyable for the whole family.  This is one major activity in Thekkady  without this your trip will be incomplete,  and of course  don't forget to take the blessings after the completion of the trip"
Too expansive,"Paying 800 for two persons elephant ride  for 20 mints at a almost baryon land in the mid of a slum is not a perfect idea, they should have done a good plantation in the area, with some landscape and feel of a jungle, it would have became a better place, there is no place for sitting of visitor, the toilets are pathetic, without a wash basin"
Must try experience.,"The elephant experience is a must try. Elephants are so well trained, ride is good. Magnificent creatures tamed for your ride!"
Elephant Ride,Nice ride with resonable price. They make you ride for 20 minutes. During that ride you could get photographs clicked by that mahawat.
Wonderful experience,We were a little unsure about elephant experience as we had seen evidence of them being mistreated on our 3 week tour. We spoke with the guide and had a look around before satisfying our concerns and paying our money. Some of our party rode bareback and others with a seat.It was‚Ä¶
Too costly ,"We went but did not get on elephant riding because they said per person it Costs 400 Rs. As we are from the place, we think they are quoting way too much"
Turned up and left,Our guide misunderstood us when we said that we wanted to see ‚Äòwild elephants‚Äô which are available to see at the nearby park!   We arrived to elephant junction to see staff smaking the elephants with large sticks. There were over 10 elephants all tied up on incomprehensibly‚Ä¶
Good experience. ,The experience is good. There are different options available for different activities with elephants which may include an elephant bath and feeding the elephants alongwith an elephant ride. The animals are treated very badly with the trainer trashing the elephant with a metal spike and with a wooden stick on its legs. This is really bad to see and sickens me how these animals are exploited to their core.
okey,"They have a small path where they take u for a round & just to make it longer, they stop unnecessarily for photo ops when there are none. My daughter also did the elephant washing thing where u wash him first while he lies down & then he washes u while u sit on his back!!"
"""had a great time with elephants""","Through the spice gardens the ride is really exciting and the elephants are well tamed, even kids can enjoy the ride. Though some prohibition was there in using elephants forride, it seems they have lifted it now. The mahouts treat the elephants like kids and take care of them properly, the elephants are very calm and we can take photographs with them. We have been to two other places in Kerala where they allow elephant rides and here also it is very interesting."
enjoyed our time,"We enjoyed our time with the elephants.  We though felt a little rushed, and not as interactive as I would have liked (we did this in Jaipur and it was a must better experience).The ride was nice, more into the 'jungle' experience.The shower at the end was a wonderful time, hubby really enjoyed it.  Bring along something to change into as you will get wet...very wet.Feeding them was nice, and they will take pictures of you with you camera, riding them, feeding them, and bathing them, which is nice."
Poorly treated animals - would not recommend,"My husband and I visited elephant junction after being told it was an elephant ‚Äòsanctuary‚Äô sadly after we bought our tickets it was clear it is far from a sanctuary, the animals were looked poorly treated and were chained up or being beaten by sticks to give elephants rides and to pose with tourists. Would not recommend visiting and funding the mistreatment of these beautiful animals for the sake of a few pictures."
A memorable afternoon it was !,We reached there around 3pm and did 30 mins elephant ride. Our elephant named Rane was too cute. I loved spending time with those beautiful creatures over there. The ride was very exciting also. They will take you through the spice plantations and you  will enjoy every bit of‚Ä¶
A real WOW experience!!,Had a super afternoon here! A slow amble on the back of an elephant through a jungle pathway. The mahout pointed out various spices and fruits to us along the way and taking lots of photos on our camera which was really good to look back on. Bathing the elephant was such a‚Ä¶
What a fun place to visit!,"Of course at least one elephant ride is necessary when you visit India.  This park is in the hills and has nice views of the surrounding mountains.  Elephants seem well treated and happy and let you pet their trunks (their flapping ears may swipe your head, but no worries!)."
Elephant's Park,Good to go roaming on elephant for photoshoot. Elephant shows in the evening. You get original Elephant's ring
Ticked One off the List for kids,We were on two elephants - 'Meenaxi and KunjLaxmi' who were playful and we enjoyed the fun ride through the cardamom hills. The steps to enter and the seats were safe. We only done the ride as had to fit in other things.
Good place for an elephant ride,"We have booked a 30min ride for us for 400rs. They also had other packages, where the elephants were made to pick up big logs and you even get to bath them in one of their package. The terrain was hilly and the path was good. So overall the ride was fun."
Please don't go here!,"Please don't fund this awful treatment of elephants!  We went in and paid for the ride and bath. Upon seeing the elephant, me and my friend both felt very uneasy, it looked so sad but we went on the ride thinking it was just in our heads. The entire ride, I felt awful, the‚Ä¶"
"Elephant Junction, where they are made to work","This place turns out to be at some remote area, without google maps, will be difficult to reach here. Cost is like 400/person for 30 min elephant ride, 1000-2000 for other activities like elephant bathing and making elephants pick wooden logs to entertain you, i find no‚Ä¶"
Fun to do,"On our visit to kerala we did elephant ride, surprisingly it was fun experience. The ride was a short one within the premise."
Saddest elephants I've seen,"This was the second time I've visited such a place so I have ""some experience"" and I can easily see thst this is horrible what happens there. This is a bloody circus. Elephants are forced to carry heavy pieces of wood, they even puke while doing that (she kind of coughed with‚Ä¶"
Great time with elephants!!,"There are so many places in thekkady offering elephant rides, but we visited Elephant junction based on reviews in TripAdvisor. It is located 2 km interior off the thekkady munnar road. They offered so many packages which includes elephant safari, elephant bathing, elephant feeding, timber breaking etc. We selected a package for Rs 1250/head which includes 40 minutes safari, bathing & feeding and photoshoot with elephants. Safari was through the spices plantation and we enjoyed it a lot. And kids enjoyed the elephant bathing & feeding activities. Elephants are treated nicely there. Overall it  was a great experience with elephants and would recommend others."
Excellent,Wonderful opportunity to get close up to the elephants.  Elephant rides available and watching the elephants getting a wash
Mr,Entertaining. Enjoyed a lot. Elephant ride is a very wonderful experience of my life.Must go place.
Elephant Ride was nice ,It was a good short ride It was inside the compound only....Elephant bath was also kinda different experience....Overall goid
Must Visit,Children Will l enjoy a lotEnsure you see the kerela martial artsElephant ride is must. Try out elephant bathing. Pictures will be for a lifetime
Elephant ride,This place is very good . We can enjoy very much with family .  Kids also enjoy very much . elephant are very nice
Good Experience ,During our Kerala visit we visited this place. It was a good experience. Must visit place. We took elephant ride.It was a unique experience. Elephant ride way is between lots of green trees. After that we take bath with elephant. It was good.water was chilled. We cleaned and‚Ä¶
Not worth it,"We went there expecting to see how the elephants are cared for, but found them being used just to entertain the tourists. We just payed to do the bathing but it seemed so forced when we got there. The elephants were lovely and they took verbal orders, but I can't imagine how‚Ä¶"
Not worth spending time.,"We were quite excited to visit this place. However, it turned out to be a really bad experience. Bad roads, exorbitant charges and poor management was all it was about. Would definitely recommend to skip it unless your children are too excited to spend time with the gigantic‚Ä¶"
Good place,But costly if u go with 10-15family member....it was 400 per person just for elephant safari for 15-20mins so it was costly for us.... It was near by spice garden... They provide the photo session t shirt printing with different prices
Fun ,"Must visit, as there are a-lot of entrainment close by. Elephant rides are 400 each for adults for 20 mins. Chocolate shop.. lights show, martial arts, cultural dance, all close by."
Amazing,"We did the full day tour, we were picked up from our accommodation in a Jeep and taken to the village. On our arrival we were given umberalla‚Äôs and then went for a ride on ‚ÄúLakshmi‚Äù up a mountain to the owners house, where we were served a traditional home cooked breakfast, which was beautiful.We were then dressed in traditional Keralan saris and had photos taken with Lakshmi.We then walked through a small spice plantation before going on an amazing Jeep safari seeing some incredible sites and places before returning to a home cooked lunch at the owners house.Lakshmi then took us back down the mountain to elephant junction where we saw an elephant moving some logs as they would in traditional villages before bathing their elephant and then having the opportunity for them to spray us.We then had the chance to feed them some fresh pumpkin.It is an experience I would recommend to anyone to do. The elephants appeared to be very well treated and not shackled or scared. The mahouts did carry a stick but never once used it, they only used verbal commands.What a fantastic experience.Thank you Elephant Junction"
It was amazing ,"I have strong feelings about animals in captivity and their treatment so was unsure whether to visit and support this attraction.I have read other reviews who claim there is cruel treatment and whilst I cannot say how they initially trained, the elephants seemed well treated, well fed and not distressed.  We did the full package which starts with a short ride.  There was good padding under the seat so it wouldn‚Äôt be hard on the elephant.  You sit on top of the elephant, rather than in seats on the side so it‚Äôs much better and you get a feel for their easy pace.  Then we fed her bananas and gave her some money for a photo with her trunk on our heads.  We watched a short display of logging and the log was lightweight so didn‚Äôt cause any problem to lift and move.Lastly we washed the elephant.  She seemed to enjoy it after which we sat directly on her one at a time so she could soak us.  It was an amazing experience and I would recommend it.  The mahouts do all carry a stick but I never saw any elephant being hit or badly treated.  None were swaying as animals often do if they are distressed so I felt happy with the attraction and welfare."
Elephant ride,"It was a nice little place where we had a wonderful experience with Elephants. We took the INR 1250 package which includes elephant ride, bathing with elephant and feeding them. The elephant ride and the way the elephant throws water on you when sitting on its back is an awesome experience."
Good,Don't ever return from thekkady without visiting this place. Should have a trial to sit in top of the elephant and experience the ride  Those who walk along with the elephant are also very helpful guide. Any way visit and enjoy
Kids love elephants,Kids enjoyed this elephant ride. Elephants are well trained for ride & photo shoot as well. Never miss this fun
Disappointing ,I went this place but came back without taking a ride or bath. It was difficult to do so after looking at the plight of the poor animal. One should not encourage such things.
Elephant experience,Nice hospitable and friendly staff. They claim that they are the first to start elephant safari there in Kumili years back. It is located inside a cardamom plantation with 3 or 4 elephants which are very friendly and poses close to you to click pictures. The roads to reach there‚Ä¶

Would not do it again,"The ride was nothing special: 10 minutes through the cardamom plantage and 10 minutes through some sort of parking lot with view on the muddy shelter for the ""resting"" elephants.

Horrifying. Please do not pay these people to continue mistreating the elephants.,"If I could give negative stars I would. I went to bathe and ride the elephants, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it when I saw how these magestic creatures were being treated. Chained in place, shackled on the right front and right back legs to the point where their legs were stretched apart. They kept swaying and lifting their legs up trying to get some slack, but there is none at all. They cannot move or even lay down. I saw them loading people onto their backs to walk around the pathway, shackle forever connected to their rear leg, constantly being prodded with a giant metal hook by the workers walking alongside them. It‚Äôs obvious the elephants know the course and do not stop, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, they are hooked regardless. If you love animals, this is not the place for an encounter. By paying these people you are only allowing them to continue mistreating them."
Lovely place for kids,"We had a short halt in Thekkady and went to elephant junction with four kids and two senior citizens...It was a good decision and we loved it...the elephant takes a leisurely stroll around a forested path with tall trees and then poses with you at the end for photographs.The kids really enjoyed seeing an elephant so close and the photo op...This place also has kalari and other shows going on, so a one stop destination and was centrally located...Price is a bit steep but everybody did enjoy a lot..."
Ok ride; nothing special,Our tour included a 30 minute ride on an elephant. We went up a road outside the spice farm for 10 minutes and then back to the starting point. Our elephant was in no mood to walk and was yelled at by her mahout. He did not hit her just raised his voice. It was amazing to see an elephant listen to his commands. This is not something we would have sought out on our own. We have been on wildlife safaris on elephants and those rides were more comfortable and enjoyable.
Small but Sweet Ride,Must Enjoy Elephant Ride when visiting Munnar / Thekkady. Safe and Good. Walk is in Nature.Small and Enjoyable.
Family Tour,"Awesome experience of elephant ride which we had missed in Munnar due to heavy rain on previous day and political strike on next day we missed the opportunity of ride hence we grab the opportunity of elephant ride in thekkady. This was a amazing experience, please have this experience whenever you visit Kerala. In elephant junction you can have elephant ride, you can give bath to elephants,  also you can feed fruits to elephant. We really enjoyed doing all of this. Kids will also enjoy.."
One off experience to ride Elephant like King,"I missed to take elephant ride In Munnar as it was very cold, raining and getting dark. So in my next day stay at Thekkaddy I didn't missed the opportunity to ride elephant with my 8 Y Son. Awesome experience. At Thekkaddy it is bit cheaper Rs400 per person compared to Rs500 /person in Munnar. Good thing is Mahut (Elephant trainer)  will take plenty of your pictures in different poses, during one small but joyful round. Initially you may find it Scarry to ride elephant but believe me it will be a lot of fun.Sachin"
Nice Adventure here,"Only Riding on Elephant is not so cool. If one really want to enjoy with elephant then one should go with Elephant Bath. In this we get elephant to get bath, elephant showers water through his trunk, we get to feed elephant, and lastly, ride on it."
Elephants seem fairly well treated,"... but would have liked the option to just feed and wash them without the need to have a ride too, however the pricing structure doesn't allow for that option and frankly felt designed to extract as much money from non-Indian tourists as possible. Elephant population seems to be recovering in southern India and hopefully the future is one in which seeing them in the wild is the preferred option."
Average experience,Took 30 minutes elephant ride through plantation. Actually the rider was around 20 min. Overall experience was average and overpriced though children mat enjoy this activity.
Troubled,"I urge you not to have this experience.  I adore elephants and was so looking forward to meeting them. But on arrival, I noticed the chains around their legs, indeed one elephant was walking with both back legs chained together. Our beautiful elephant that my friend decided to ride had only submission registering in her eyes, even when being washed and we were only allowed to wash her back while she laid on her side and told to go nowhere near her legs. It was not the beautiful experience I was wishing for and for purely personal ethical reasons I felt I had to write this review."
Enjoyable,"We enjoyed our strict hour and a half here with an elephant. It started with the ride. One of the handlers took my camera and took absolutely loads of pictures of us, the elephant, the surrounding area including flowers, trees etc. Good job it wasn't an old style film camera! OH - and he also pictured the other handler relieving himself while we looked forward thinking he was taking yet another picture of us!After a demonstration of how elephants are used to move lumber we moved on to the bathing pool. Although we scrubbed our elephant down we declined an invite to join her in the pool while she showered herself. But don't be put off doing this, they have showers and changing facilities. We did of course get well splashed during this activity.Always good to get really up close to elephants. We finished by feeding her and posing for photos. Staff and handlers fiendly."
Elephant ride,Good friendly staff. Well trained elephants.Took a 30 minute ride uphill and in the plantation area which was super fun. Good activity for adults ans especially kids.
Elephant Junction,The whole trip was awesome. Right from the full half an hour ride of the jumbo up and down from the hill in between the forest to the ending part of bathing the jumbo. This was great since involves water being sprayed bt the elephant itself. Most memorable for my small kid.Very good and must visit place.
Elephant bathing is amazing activity,"We took a elephant ride and elephant bathing activity here. If you ever visit here than recommended elephant bathing and its one of the most beautiful experience you will have ever in your life. The local staff there was very helpful and gave us best memories with elephants. The elephant ride was too small and priced a little high is what we felt. But nonetheless, must try this activity if in Thekkady."
Overpriced but lovely activity,There are multiple places in Thekkady  for elephant ride and elephant bath/shower.Every where they show you a chart with rates of 1200 for this activity. But don't get fooled. Bargain as much as you can .We did this activity for 600 per person instead of 1200 per pax. In kerala they say that rates are fixed and people don't bargain here but this is totally wrong. You must have the capacity to bargain or else you get cheated.Elephant shower is  more thrilling than elephant ride.
Mixed Feelings...,I absolutely LOVED my experience at Elephant Junction!  The elephants were so gentle and friendly and it appeared that they were being treated decently given the situation.  They were chained until they gave us a ride though...Live chocolate shop on site was an unexpected bonus‚Ä¶
Difficult experience - beautiful creatures but locked away,"It is amazing to be able to stand next to and look into the eyes of these incredible animals, but they are ridden far too much and locked up with a 'psychological chain' to remind them to not run away."
Elephant Ride,It is a very interesting and somewhat panic experience because when we get big elephants we get to accomadate properly while moving
elephant ride,enjoy the elephant ride and good to see the elephant nearly and enjoy small  elephant ride tour at this place.
Great,Great place to enjoy tusker trails. It was lot of fun to have a ride on the giant elephant. The enclosure is well maintained.
Elephant Safari Best Experience Ever! ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Elephant Safari was way too amazing sitting on the back of elephants and walking through the narrow lanes of coconut trees. Very beautiful experience, love the way how elephant in Kerala understand Malyalam. They only follow voice commands, there is no need of a stick to make‚Ä¶"
Great Experience to ride on Elephant ,"Great Experience to ride on Elephant,  it is costly but good to experience it,  below 5 years children no fees,  water is cool,  they have bathrooms for change "
Exciting experience,"It was indeed very exciting experience to ride ""laxmi"" excellent and safe elephant ride. All elephants are well trained and attendants are very cooperative"
Like a xmas present for my wife,We dropped in on a Tuesday morning and had the place to ourselves. My wife has done a few rdies on elephants but found this the best of all. The elephants looked well cared for and staff were delighted for you to interact with them. There are changing facilities available with‚Ä¶
Enquire before get on the Jumbos,You need to go via broker. I payed Rs. 300. The same was charged 600 1 hour back from other person. You can check with some auto drivers. 
Do not contribute to this cruelty,There‚Äôs a difference in bathing ‚Äúwith‚Äù elephants to them being forced to bathe with you. These poor creatures showed signs of distress which made for an uncomfortable visit. Don‚Äôt be the reason they are kept here.... just not worth the visit
Wonderful - As far as I know...,"I found this experience an amazing break and a vital part of endorsing yourself in the full culture of Kerala. Both the elephant ride and spray were definitive crowd pleasers in my family, equal to the feeding and washing too. We had a truly wonderful time and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in culture a bit of fun and elephants. (It was myself (currently 12), my sister (currently 15), my mother and my grandmother)Although Recently I have been researching around asian elephant cruelty (for a school project) and found that particularly in Kerala there is known to be an immense amount of hard training (using in humane techniques), torture and cruelty. I was wondering if anyone knew whether any of these is associated with this particular place, Im just trying to find out whether or not my family mistakenly played a funding role in this.Thank you for taking the time to read this and please get back to me on @nina.cca.albert@gmail.com if you happen to have any information."
Must Do activity,Its a must do activity in thekkady. the elephant ride is enjoying but make it for a shorter duration. the best is elephant shower. really enjoyed with family.
"Rain or Shine, a must do activity!","Our tour included the full package (ride, logging, bath & shower, feeding plus a hot cuppa ‚Äòlocal‚Äô tea). It was raining and we were very hesitant to go. Considering we were in anyway going to get wet from the ‚Äòshower‚Äô activity we proceeded. The kids (7 & 9yrs) thoroughly enjoyed! I must say, the rain made the experience (and views) more breathtaking. Remember to pack an extra set of clothing. After all is done, there is decent and clean shower facilities."
Must have experience! ,"Another site called periyar ecotourism tried to cheat us with higher cost for the elephant ride, wash and shower.To our luck, we came across guide named Jiju, who got us a further discount and we did not have to wait much as well.Our daughter thoroughly enjoyed the ride. We had good fun with the elephant in the wash as well. Shower water was clean and cold, they had changing area with bathing facilities and clean towels. Among all other such facilities for elephant ride, we believe this one is the best.Point to mention - they are all skilled photographers and you can safely hand them your phones or SLR cameras for amazing shots!"
Funny and exciting and a little scary,"The place can be smelt from a 100 m distance. They have packages according to your time limit. We took the least one, 400 per person for only a ride. 3 people can be seated on one elephant. The climbing part is the easiest but when the elephant moves, the dance starts. We‚Ä¶"
A unique and exhilarating experience!!!,"This is a ride one must not miss on a visit to Kumily. We had booked a day earlier to avoid the rush during day time. The whole experience of watching the elephant being fitted with the saddles, the way they obey the mahouts and their swaying walk was fantastic. The kids enjoyed‚Ä¶"
A good place for an elephant ride,Good place for experiencing a ride on an elephant. You also get to give a wash to the elephant of you feel like. Also this place can be visited on your own vehicle. You don't need a taxi or a Jeep for it. It is well within the town limit. The Mahout are very co-operative. They‚Ä¶
Memorable Interaction with Pachiderms,"This place is a must visit just to comprehend how caring elephants can be. We went as a family of 4 pax (2 adults and 2 children). We were initially apprehensive due to the heavy rains and not so sure about the whole deal.  The elephants may look slow and easy to ride, but the‚Ä¶"
Elephant rides,A must visit place for families with children who love elephants. Safe and clean. Kids can feed the elephants and have a shower with them.
AWESOME ELEPHANT RIDE,Mind blowing experience to ride on Elephant at Elephant Junction.Kids are enjoying lot.Most memorable elephant ride.Better to book in advance to avoid waiting.best time is evening for enjoying natural weather.
A fun thing to do,"Very good and unique experience. Positives* You can interact closely with elephants.* The place is situated in natural surroundings.* Elephants seem to be well-treated.Negatives* Though well-treated, the elephants¬†are still in captivity; hence the place might not be¬†suitable for hard-core animal lovers.The staff all seem very respectful and clearly spend a lot of time with the elephants. Recommended."
Great,It was superb experience. Totally enjoyed the trip with my familyThanks to lekshmi....Strongly recommend
Awesome Ride,The experience of sitting on the elephant and roaming around was good with rain showers. Lovely place...
It was good ,"We were recommended to this place by our taxi driver . Ticket was 400 for adult and nothing for less than 5 year . Elephant looks old and upon enquiringly the age came to know , it‚Äôs 50 for our elephant . It was short 15-20 min ride , loved the entire experience especially our Mahaavat was damn good and have been taking our picture through colourful devices"
Superb ,Really enjoyed the ride with my children...  Thank you all for the nice s ervice....  üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç...  Wonderful experience
Egypt -cairo,It was  very good half a hour on a cute elephant you have  to try  And enjoy and take. A photos  Very nice  
Great ,It was an awseom  exp.   We really  enjoyed  the ride with elephant..   The staff are very  nice and heplful  Area also neat and clean
Avoid at all costs,"If you have a shred of compassion, avoid this place where the elephant are not fed properly for a first (they have a lot of depigmentation). And they are stuck under a roof where it is really warm when they are not working !"
Elephant ride .....,Sure everyone should go a ride without fail  Ppl seriously treat us in a good manner  5 elephants well trained  I and my family enjoyed well  We booked the online and ppl response was good 
Get the Elephant Shower!,"I was a little scared of coming here. I didn't really know what to expect during my stay, and was a little terrified of the thought of bathing an elephant. It was so worth it though. Especially when it was time to get showered by the elephant. And I didn't have to wait too long like some of the other people have complained about."
Great Experience,The wait times are horrible and this is a rather expensive activity but its an experience none the less and it was average. Makes for some good photographs
fully enjoy,200 per person.there was a ride roam round garden.the photo session done under well trained Mahavat.
Nice experience @ Elephant Junction,"The Elephant Junction is located amidst lush green tea and spice plantations. There are different rides that one can choose from depending on your interests, budget and time availability. Since we were traveling with our 4 month old daughter we choose the 30 minute elephant safari. The safari was short but enjoyable. We rode on the elephant back through the spice plantations. We clicked a lot of photographs with the elephants as well. There is a hand sketch artist at the booking counter. She sketched a beautiful pic of our daughter for INR 100."
Royal feeling,"Feel like king riding on elephant. The mahuts are friendly people. Took my camera and clicked many pictures while making the elephant pose with trunk raised. Bought some bananas from nearby stall and fed the elephant. There are stalls selling bananas for elephant feeding. The kids were thrilled to ride and feed the elephant.  There is also provision for elephant shower where the elephant will shower with water over you which costs around Rs 1000 extra. Bathrooms are available for after shower clean up. (Do check whether the seat is tightly buckled up. While getting down from the elephant, found that we has slid off a little)"
Feeling like a King for those 30 minutes... ,"Very good place... Watching the elephants activities, specially bathing is awesome.... The elichi plantation and elephant ride in the kachcha road through it.... The mahut was friendly and made the elephant giving various posture for taking photography.... Cafeteria is there but we haven't tried anything there.... Clean toilet are there..."
Nice elephant safari ,"First time I am riding on an elephant. In fact, my family too. Our homestay owner recommended and guided to this place. We, a family of 4, able to ride on elephant with 3 tickets. Nice staffs. The area is surrounded with coffee, cardamom and spice plantations. We took the 30 minute ride. Per person INR400 only. Initially we were scared to climb up on an elephant. But after the elephant started to move, it was a pleasure full trip. Children were overjoyed. The elephant driver is professional and friendly. The elephant took us to a height filled with a lot of trees and plants then came down to the initial place which took 30 minutes travel. Overall a good experience.. try this atleast once in a life time."
Well maintained elephant farm,"We availed the full package cost 1250 which included elephant ride, bath and feeding. My 4 yr kid was supper excited and enjoyed a lot. they have clean bathrooms with hot water to have shower aftr elephant bath. Nice experience. Kids will love it :)"
Great show,"This junction provides not only the elephant rides but also have other shows including magical, musical fountain, kalakari marshal art, Kathakali etc. when we reached the time for elephant ride was over and we had to settle with the show of Kerala marshal art. That was an awesome show, which is not like a scripted demonstration of fight, but they look so real that we couldn‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs a demo."
"Elephant Junction, Thekkady",Very good and unique experience.  Elephant ride is for half an hour and thereafter you can bathe the elephant and in turn get drenched by them.  Awesome experience.  You may have to wait anywhere between 45 minutes to one and half hour.  Minimum two people are required in a family to book the ride.
A feel Good way to Learn about Elephants,"I respect the elephant‚Äôs intelligence, size and strength and I also have a healthy curiosity to get to know them. The elephant park offered me the opportunity to touch his body and head while he laid on his side in a small pool. Later, feeling comfortable, I was helped to climb‚Ä¶"
Unforgettable memories,My driver take my family it's rainy day we enjoy lot good ride with two children and there were face artists who drow my daughter paint in just five minutes what an art
Bribe eating staff at elephant junction Tekkady,This morning we were at the elephant junction Tekkady and we bought tickets for the elephant ride for 5 people . They mentioned that we need to wait for abt 45 min for our turn which we were ok with . After waiting for 1 hour we tried to check what number is riding the manager‚Ä¶
Ok for one time experience,This was a very ok kind of experience. You can take a short ride on elephant and also feed them.  They charges are a bit high. We just went to feed elephants as I personally don't like riding an elephant. May be small kids would enjoy here. 
Nice experience ,Must do .... at least once !!  The pachyderms... seems to be in good hands and are taken care of. Good staff. 
Good but expensive,Spent 3 hours there. Elephant ride through the cardamom plantation is excellent. My boy enjoyed bathing with the elephant. May be charges are bit expensive compared to other places but guess the location makes the difference. Highly recommended if you go with kids.
Great visit ,We did the elephant ride and shower Kids had a super time The elephants were so beautiful  We will definitely return during a next visit 
Excellent  place for Elephant  Ride,"Superb place  to visit,  really  my children and my family  enjoyed  a lot. Thank you lekshmi for the nice ride with us.... "
Great fun ,"We did the elephant bath, feeding and a relaxing ride round the neighbourhood (bare back was fine for 2 adults) with a gentle and patient elephant. The place is open with plenty of space for the animals and there was no sign of ill treatment, the elephant needed no prompting and‚Ä¶"
Probably not politically correct these days.,"Although we had mixed feelings about keeping animals for the pleasure of tourists, it was really fun to sit on the elephant's back and having a high powered shower from her trunk. However we were sure that she enjoyed the slices of pumpkin that we fed her."
A great experience of elephant ride,"This place offers a lot of package comprising of elephant ride, photo shoot, feeding the elephant, elephant bath and shower, timber dragging and all.

Up close and personal with nature's greatest masterpiece...,We love elephants and this place was just perfect for us to get close with these amazingly beautiful and graceful pachyderms!!

Excellent ,Excellent fantastic good mind blowing what a great day excellent wow good  i love it. Good experience . Don't miss 
Must visit - especially with children ,"Must visit place, especially with children. We went for a good 30 mins ride with our toddler, who sat right in front. Very safe and lovely experience. "
Superb,"Pls take elephant shower , ride is okk. But shower from elephant is unique loved to take once again.. Take rides from hotel, rates are same so no botheration"
Elephant Junction - a must visit while in Kumily/Thekkady,"After seeing elephants in the wild in East Africa I was not sure about seeing them in what might seem a 'tame' setting. However, I enjoyed the whole experience of being very close to these magnificent creatures, including a chance to bathe an elephant and then being sprayed with water by the same elephant. Depending on what you choose to do, you can feed the elephants and also get a slow 30 minute ride on a elephant through the wooded area surrounding the facilities. The staff are all very respectful and clearly spend a lot of time with the elephants. This was a once in a lifetime experience which I would highly recommend."
Lovely Experience!!!,While the approach road to Elephant Junction might appear crampy and narrow but its surely worth a visit if in Thekkady / Kumily. There are 6 elephants currently and the ride is enjoyable. Better part - The elephants are taken well care off...The staff is highly courteous and goes and extra mile to delight the visitors by obliging them to take a couple of snaps with the pachyderms. The staff is keen to answer every query one might have and have good Hindi / English Language command. The plantation majorly consists of Cardamom Trees and Black Pepper Climbers. Indeed worth a visit if in Thekkady / Kumily.
Enjoyable,This place is really enjoyable for children. You will be taken for a ride on the back of elephant. The whole ride would be for 10-15mins and would cover an enclosed planted area in between the city.
Very enjoyable,Really good. Did a half day which included a sari dressing and talk on cardamon preparation in addition to the elephant walk and bathing. Elephants are rescue animals.Recommended
Nice ride and good staff,It was very nice riding an elephant around a small garden. The place has a small pond with fully blossomed pink lotus/Lily. It also has a traditional eat out where we were served refreshing filter coffee with cookies. The activity of feeding the elephant with our own hands was‚Ä¶
Memories from the past,"If you haven't experienced an elephant ride, this is a must - I last experienced one 59 years ago.  The animals are beautifully trained and respond to the guides who speak to them in the local language.  They are sure footed, and graceful: the seats are a little wide but‚Ä¶"
Elephant time! ,We had a great time at this place. The elephant ride was fun as was helping with cleaning Jamba in her bath.  We also had chance to feed her with large pieces of melon.  However what made it really memorable was shower time. Sitting on Jamba‚Äôa back and repeatedly getting blasted‚Ä¶
Definitely worth the visit,"Went with some trepidation, but enjoyed every moment of it.  Wonderful to know that this was a sanctuary for rescued elephants, and the elephants seemed to enjoy the bath as much as people enjoyed bathing them!

Must go place if you have kids,If you have kids then this is the place to go. Lifetime expereince of riding on jumbo elephants through the garden which is approx 15 mins ride.

Elephant washing experience,Great visit. Booked for 1.5 hr experience. Be warned you will get wet. Luckily we had change if clothing with us! Fab elephant ride - though a bit daunting as this was bare back & told to hang on!!! Great fun.
Good experience,We were really in two minds about going here but we left with a generally favourable view.  The animals look well cared for and we did not witness any signs of cruelty while there. All control was by voice and heel pressure and no prods were used.The elephants obviously loved‚Ä¶
Don't Miss this,"Elephant junction should not be missed at any cost as you will rarely have this experiance in other part of India.  We took 1.5 hr package (1250 Rs Per person, in case of advance booking you get 10% discount on top of this), which include  1. 45min elephant ride( they take you‚Ä¶"
Good experience ,Nice experience with elephants enjoy alot with bath as well and don't be scared trained people are always there
Lovely morning with the elephants,Although I don't generally like seeing animals in captivity the elephants at this park seemed to be well cared for and looked after. Washing the elephant and getting up close was just fabulous as she was wonderful. 
Lovely to get up close to an elephant,Contrary to some of the reviews on this site we did not witness any ill treatment of the elephants. We went early in the day and had a good 30 min ride and then enjoyed washing and being sprayed and feeding. The elephant seemed to enjoy too.
Do yourself a favor and visit them in the wild,"2 hours 30 minute wait for a 25min ride on a abused elephant with chains. Everything was arranged (and paid) weeks before, so a very disappointing experience. The animals are beautiful though, but I would never visit such a place again. Going to look for a glimpse off them in the wild! There are wild elephants very close by this place, do yourself and the animals a favor and go there!"
Awesome trip,Nice ride enjoyed elephant ride of 25 minutes good memorable trip with family no matter it is old people or a teenager or a kid everyone enjoys it
Paradise for bird lovers,"If you are a bird watcher or interested in bird photography, this is the place. I wanted to book a safari for Periyar tiger reserve however I was more interested in bird photography and met a guy named Jiju who informed me about this place. He showed me lot of bird species like Malabar parakeet, Rufus treepie, spotted owlet, barbet, bulbul, greater racket tailed drongo and so many more.He can communicate in English as well as in Hindi.Jiju- 9497503177"
Excellent experience ,Nice elephant ride with a gud gide whome d elephant obey vr nicely .even d elephant poses for pics also .my kids like d ride
Not worth it,I went to this place and was willing to pay anything just to spent some time with the elephant (as I‚Äôm against the riding). So the only was I could do that is by paying for the 1/2 hour tour that includes 10 minutes at the view point - which was OK - and elephant ride... bummer obviously the elephants are abused and the ride is no longer than 10 minutes and you HAVE to tip everyone
Very Expensive,Nice to have good experience in Kerala.But I felt bit expensive.You will love to sit on the top of elephant and take ride
Such a shame tourists still find this acceptable.,I went to this thinking it was an Elephant orphanage and we were going to walk around and see elephants and perhaps help feed and bath them. The reality of this is an elephant that looks tired and bored chained by his leg and prodded with a metal hook before being ridden and asked to perform tricks. I refused to pay for this and the situation moved me to tears. These animals did not hold the special bond with their mahout as I was lead to believe. Please avoid these elephants are not here for your entertainment they are living beautiful animals that should be given a chance of freedom.
"Terrible, don't patronise this type of tourist attraction.","The first thing we saw on arrival was an elephant chained by two legs, it could barely move a few inches.  No water that we could see, just a few wilted bamboo canes.  The poor thing was pulling at the chains.  People were queuing for elephant rides and when they arrived they look exhausted and wore leg chains.  This is definitely not responsible tourism.  Please do not go."
Enjoyable ,It was fun to ride an elephant.. Elephant Bath was a very enjoyable activity. The female elephants are nicely trained do its safe to visit and ride them. Enjoyed this activity a lot

Don't visit for the elephant's sake,"I was unsure about going due to the wellbeing of the elephant.

Not a jungle experience but still worthwhile,"After reading about this place in Lonely Planet and at our drivers encouragement we ventured here instead of taking a chance on safari.  The camp was considerably smaller than i had imagined.  It is home to 11 elephants currently that are not native to area (given they are trained). We purchased a package of short ride, feeding, photo shoot and shower. At around 1200 INR ea it was reasonable value, especially given the shower/bath highlight.  We were given ample time at the shower/bath station and captured some great photos.  I would like to see this facility promote wildlife education and conservation."
Great unforgettable experience ,"If you enjoy being close to animals - go there! I just observed but my friend who loves animals got the chance to ride the elephant, wash it, pet it, feed it and by the end he was sitting on the elephant while getting a shower from elephant:-) really lovely :-)"
Not a great experience ,We visited this place because our children wanted to ride an elephant in the jungle. The elephant ride was not great. The staff and the place were not friendly and didn‚Äôt seem very kind to the elephants.The elephant ride involved a 100m litter strewn circuit. We have had an elephant ride up to the palace in Jaipur which was much better than this experience. We left the place feeling rather sad for the elephants.
A Must must Visit ,"We visited when we were in thedakky to Elephant camp. This is near Elephant route Hotel. We took Elephant ride and Elephant bath package it was 1000 per head , but believe me its worth it. It starts with Elephant ride and a photo shoot with Elephant. Later they shall take to another Elephant whose lying in the pond . Later we were asked to Brush Elephant. My kid was first afraid to touch him but later he was enjoying bathing Elephant. Next part was awesome ..now it‚Äôs Elephant turn.. here the excitement started.. we asked to sit on Elephant and he started showering is with Trunk... !!! Until we said stop stop .. It ends with Photo session with him...Go there and have fun. Don‚Äôt just read."
Safety standards ?,I went here with my mum. We went on a half hour Elephant ride. I think it was luck rather than judgement that we got back in one piece. They take you around a pretty steep track. Its not particularly comfortable but then Elephants werent meant to be a mode of transport. They didnt appear to be treated badly. Would rather see them out in the wild. Free to do what they want.
"Good experience, but i am not believer of animal ride",I visited this place with my family. The place has 12 elephants which will give you ride in their coffee plantations. The ride is scary for me as I was holding the back of elephant but it is bit scary. I don't like elephants like wild animals doing activity for food. But overall‚Ä¶
Elephant masti ,"Superb experience  For Indian ride don‚Äôt matter a lot , but giving bath to elephant and taking elephant shower must do experience   It‚Äôs cost us ‚Çπ 700 per person for elephant bath , shower and elephant feeding.

Worth but very unorganised ,"It‚Äôs a worth spending Rs 400 for elephant ride but don‚Äôt believe anyone on the counter selling tickets on time commitment, you have to stand in line for hours, we bought tickets at 11 am and we got the ride at 4 pm, crowded small area to stand & very unorganised. "
Wonderful family time with elephants :) ,Made the bookings from Chitrashala homestay ... Enjoyed the elephant rides thru the jungle...shower with the elephant was just too good.! Gave a scrub to ‚ÄòMeera‚Äô..also Fed the elephant.. Had coffee and biscuits at the small canteen .. chill out time .. very relaxing‚Ä¶
Elephant experience too little. ,"Elephants being one of the strongest yet cuttest animal for me. I love to watch them, with same excitement we went and what we saw and experienced was something that shall not happen to any animal. They are doing a elephant slave, against the will of them they force and if they‚Ä¶"
The best experience,It was one of the best experiences of our kerela trip. The place isnt very famous and doesnt get much visitors so its not crowded and u get ample time to spend with the elephant. The 45 mins ride was worth it and the mahaut was good at clicking pics. After the ride we were told about elephants which we and our 5 year old enjoyed thoroughly. They also showed us the log dragging and picking part. Feeding pumpkin to the elephant was the best part and the elephant was very gentle and careful while taking the pumpkin. The elephant was in no hurry to snatch it. Our 5 year old was initially scared to feed the elephant but the elephant was so gentle and careful in taking it from her hand that she loved that experience. Then came the best part which was bathing the elephant and being bathed by an elephant üòÉ. Nothing can beat this experience. Dont forget:1) To wear comfortable pants as the ride strains ur hip bones2) Carry ur towels and extra set of clothes if u wanna bathe with the friendly mighty elephant.The shower rooms are very very clean with warm/cold water and so are the towels provided by the staff.
Overhyped commercial venture ,Minimum Rs 400 Per person for an elephant ride for half an hour .not worth . It‚Äôs better you give it a miss. The local guides get 50% cut of what ever you pay here.
Animals are mistreated here - avoid this place!,"We went to Elephant junction as we thought it will be a nice place to see animals. However, elephants are not treated well here - staff keeps beating elephants with the stick, shouting on them. I believe responsible tourists should not spend money here."
A nice surprise in disguise,When we were in Thekkady our driver suggested that we do this activity. Initially we were hesitant to spend moneys on elephant thingy but he insisted that we do it and so we took the package of 1k per person. We reached the junction at 8:30 in the morning. First they took us on elephant ride to a height through the green alleys. The picturesque view of lush green area was amazing from there. Then they allowed us to bathe the elephants which was a different experience altogether. The package also included photography and elephant feeding sessions. BUT the highlight of the activity is the Elephant Shower. It was indeed the most amazing experience we had. One must try it. You sit on elephant's back and she will shower fresh water on you (4-5 times) through her trunk. Do not feel disgusted with this thought as you're going to enjoy every bit of it.
Great experience with the kids ,"We did a fantastic half day experience with the elephants. The ride is a bit long, but the washing and feeding experience is excellent! Be there early to avoid the crowds"
Elephant riding,This is the place where you can enjoy company with elephants. There is different packages available. I and my family ride on elephants.
Unique up close experience with elephants,"We did two hour program. Included 1 hour ride (no chains on elephants legs), work demonstration, an informational briefing on elephants (anna) and best of all getting to wash, scrub, pet, hug and get showered by Mira. We didn‚Äôt know to bring change of clothing but they provided towels!!"
Nice experience with kalaripattu and elephant ride but disappointed by kathakali,Nice experience with kalaripattu and elephant ride but disappointed by kathakaliElephant ride was awesome.. it tools us from the path in spice garden having more spices than any other paid spice garden we have visited .Kalaripattu martial art was breathtaking.. each stunt was amazing and good enough to give salute to the trained professionals.Kathakali was little boring and disappointed .. not even near to what we have seen in Delhi auditorium
Exciting for young kids,"We reached Elephant junction at 3:30 pm took an 90 mins package which includes, elephant ride, elephant bath, elephant shower, feeding and tea or coffee at the end. My daughter was super excited to see elephant with such a distance. We had a ride of 60 mins and then make the elephant bath. Then we had elephant shower and at last we feed the elephant with the bananas provided by the person incharge there. The elephants are so trained that the instructor just say few words from a distance and the obey the orders. It's was fun for kids and new learning about the animal and as read in few of the reviews the elephants were not torchured at all."
A MOST excellent visit,"I didn‚Äôt know in the morning that by dinner time I‚Äôd have had such an amazing close up experience with an elephant. Not only did we ride an elephant, I opted for bathing an elephant and showering courtesy of an elephant!  The most crazy experience. It cost 1250 rupees (about ¬£15) for a 40 minute ride and then the rest of the elephant experience. The handlers were very kind and smiley and they took loads of photos for us. Completely a must do experience but take a change of clothes. And they have a shower room with hot water to change afterwards. All great."
Out of this world experience with an elephant,"What an amazing experience to get up close and personal with an elephant. We choose the two hour package (ride, feed, wash and shower with the elephant) for 1500 rupees, which was excellent.Our elephant was called Rhumba. We had a ride up the track and back again. The trainer/guide appeared to have an excellent relationship with the elephant.  On the way back Rhumba was given water as it was very humid. The guide/trainer also took lots of photos for us.We then saw Rhumba pick up a log and drag it a very short distance. We also fed Rhumba. The last part of the package was to wash Rhumba in the small pool and then be given a shower by her. I can only say that this was the most amazing experience, absolutely wonderful. A must visit if you‚Äôre in the area, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. A once in a lifetime opportunity to get close to such a wonderful animal, truly outstanding."
A Wonderful experience ,"We booked a package consisting of 45 minute ride able to watch the elephant lifting the logs, a elephant bath and shower finished with a drink of your choice. The elephants seem to be well looked after- they have a handler and 1 other looking after the animal. We did not see any illtreatment of the animals in fact the elephant loved her bath. I would recommend this, I think children would love the bath and shower."
A fun thing to do!,"There are all kinds of activities to do here with the elephants - watching logging, washing an elephant or just going for a ride on one. You can go for half an hour or an hour. We chose half an hour which was adequate as it is not the most comfortable way to travel but fun. The Mahoot will take your camera and takes copies photographs for you - some very inventive!The great thing about this - all the elephants look cared for and are not overworked - taken for a rest after your ride."
Nic experience,It's not being done inside the forest or something...They have a private space and u will be getting a round through the plantation in Elephant.It provides you the feel to be in an elephant for half an hour...A casual elephant slow ride
A time pass place !,"If you have kids then must visit this place it is also call elephant safari (for 20 min.cost 400 per person) you can also play,feed to elephant, take bath with elephant but with different package. Kids likes this very much."
Hathi ki Savari,"Wow.........!  Its wonderful to ride on Elephant!Just seat and watch Mahavat directions..Watch the view of spices around the ride, Photo suit......"
A good experience,Its a unique experience to go for elephant safari. If u r animal lover u will feel strange and astonishing about the wild strength of this animal. So sitting on the elephant won't make u feel guilty.Definitely must for 1st timers.
Atv ride was great,Very much enjoyed the ATV ride.... recommend it to all...the riders follow u and capture your videosThrilling experienceElephant's ride was good...though waiting was there...but enjoyed the ride.
"#1, Must Do Activity (Infact only interesting activity) in Thekkady","Went to Elephant Junction with my family (4 yr old kid). There are many other Elephant parks but this is no doubt better than others. Also if you are doing Munnar and Thekkady both, dont go to the elephant park in Munnar but go here instead.Rs 400 for 20-25 minute ride --> completely safe and worth itRs 1250 package --> 1.5 hours, Elephant ride, bath, shower (u can sit on top of elephant and elephant will shower with clean water), elephant feeding and photo session with elephantsElephant shower is the best part... not to be missedSPECIAL NOTE:* Try to go in 1st half. it rains a lot in 2nd half and you might get stuck with a ride in rain or  shower cancelled due to rain* If you have kids (any age above 3 yrs), DO NOT MISS THIS* Completely safe and comfortable"
Elephant tour,Elephant ride priced at Rs. 400 per person. Mentioned 20 minutes ride. But ride gets over in 7 minutes.  But enjoyable . The time duration is excusable considering the continuous rides that these animals are made to provide. Also their food expenses are high. God bless them.But worth the experience especially if going with kids 6-7 years and above.
Regal jungle experience,The safari is well packaged though a trifle expensive. The getting on-&-off the elephant is very comfortable and the 'howdah' is replaced with a more comfortable sitting arrangement. The 20 minute experience takes you through a thick plantation giving one a good feel of the‚Ä¶
The Elephant Safari,It was an experience that me and mom will always cherish. Fantastic. Elephants are well trained and the entire tour is safe and well managed.
The highlight of my tour,"The round with the elephants was nice I loved it but bath with them was just so much more. I wished though it was in a lake rather than an empty swimming pool but still it was just ama,."
Worth a visit. ,"It will be an experience for the kids to touch , feel, bathe and feed the elephants. The elephant will shower water on you and I should admit it was quite an experience. Please make sure you have dresses to change , the elephants will shower more than a full bucket of water on‚Ä¶"
Elephant experience,We went on a wonderful elephant ride and shared a bath today with Mira.Fantastic experience thankyou
Wonderful experience,"I know there are always going to mixed views on elephant attractions, but we just felt so lucky to be able to get so close to these incredible animals! The place was clean, well kept and I saw no signs of the elephants being anything but well cared for. We did the ride and experience package, choosing the timber dragging option rather than the shower - and this turned out to be a bonus not a disappointment as we were able to feed the elephant and really get up close. The staff were great at taking photos for you, and the talk during the timber dragging was informative. The centre was about 10mins by tuk tuk from the main street in Thekkady. Definitely worth it."
A must have at Thekkady,"The Elephant Junction had about 8 elephants when we visited the place. They offer different packages with elephant ride ,  showering the elephants & showering by the elephant,  timber picking, feeding the elephant and other activities.You can design your own package according to your wish. The package cost varies from Rs. 800 to Rs. 1500 per person for different rides. Showering by the Elephants was the best experience ever after scrubbing the elephant, you sit on top and the elephant showers you with water from his trunk. They also provide you with towels and changing room. Complementary Tea/ Coffee is also available after taking ride."
Experienced something GREAT.,"Very much ideal place for Elephant ride. Worth experiencing. One have tor each to the location early and buy ticket for the ride to avoid rush. The tour is great one. The rider of the elephant is experienced one. Besides handling elephant, rider help tourist to take photographs/Video etc. The place is neat and nicely managed. The Elephants are healthy and perfectly maintained."
Must Visit place if you have kids,"i visited this place when i visit kumily. memorable place. this is runned by a private people. neatly maintained. there are different type of packages, i took 90mins package. they charged about Rs. 1250/- for adults. free for kids. 1st we took elephant ride. its may be about 30to 45mins. lot of fun to ride in an elephant, my kids enjoyed lot. beware for hip pains if you select more ride time. After the ride is over we have been guided to elephant shower area. there is a rest room & shower room available there to change our dresses if you want, before you go to have shower with the elephants. maintenance is good in that place. better you have some spare dresses. we can brush an elephant, then we can have a shower from that elephant. after that we can have feeding section. a sliced fruit is given to us, which we can feed the elephants. a instructor will be there. he will clarify any droughts we have about elephants. fun place to visit."
Good Elephant Ride.,We were here for Elephant ride. Enjoyed a lot. The man handling the elephants took our lot of good pictures. Totally worth it.
Elephant ride was fun,There will be long queue for your turn. Elephant was healthy and well trained and we got some good photos on elephant.
Fun Ride,This is the best elephant ride i have ever gone. The elephants are tamed very well and it listens to each and every word of the care taker. Don't ever think of missing this.
Fantastic elephant encounter ,"We had an amazing experience here riding, bathing Kimba.  Totally memorable, safe and humane.  Highly recommended!"
Elephant ride,"The place is clean..there are many activities that can be chosen including giving the elephants food,giving the elephant shower and food.the ride is of adequate time but we felt the animal was abused abit by the ride itself,elephant was sad during the ride and maybe a little bit of elephant facts would be helpful..all else appreciated"
Elephant üêò ride is awesome üëèüèª experience also do elephant üêò bath,Elephant ride is memorable experience also take elephant üêò shower after elephant safari it recharges you fully
"If you want to be with elephants, this is the place","As simple as the title. You‚Äôll find lot of places in India to pay for time with the elephants. Of course, they are not free and wild, but in this case they are rescued elephants, and they have a lot of space for them and they open just a few hours per day, they are really well‚Ä¶"
Joy ride,It was our first elephant ride. Initially it was scary but gradually we liked it. It was a great ride inside the greens. Three persons can ride at a time. Must try adventure. 
Elephant ride- a different experience,An awesome experience at Thekkady- not to be missed. We arranged our trip through our hotel. Amazing elephant ride for 30 minutes inside spice plantation. The whole place is built inside spice plantation so one can have leisure of experiencing both. You can handover your Camera‚Ä¶
The best place to experience the pachyderm up close,"Go there early morning to avoid lines. Can get busy and have long wait at times after 10am. Pricing is very reasonable,  and you can pick and choose what activities you want to do. The Elephants seems to be well taken care off as well."
Nice ride,Nice ride.A small circuit up and down the mountain.Nice experience.They have the full day elephant tour too.Nice experience.
Jungle safari by jeep,"Worst experience, couldn't see a single animal, very rough road & drive. They promise big things in the begining & say hard luck in the end."
Elephants are abused!,While the idea sounds great of taking an elephant ride in the forest or having an elephant bath; the elephants are abused and we saw tears in one elephant 's eyes.  They make people scrub elephants with a hard wired brush - which happens all day long. During our visit to kerala‚Ä¶
Fun place,This a awesome place where u can have a ride as well as shower and bath of elephants.It has different packages according to ur will and wish.There are certain discount if u go throw agents.
Average Experience!,Again... long queue and over priced. 400/- for a 20 minute ride. Not sure if it's worth the wait and distance travelled when the same can be done at Munnar as well.
New Experience,Its new experience..fresh..you can ride elephnt..bath them.. photography..however its costly..not so well organised in terms of pics shown on magzines n boards..give it try if elephant rides r new to you.. Children will enjoy for sure
Fantastic experience for all the family,We chose the 45 minute elephant ride with bathing the elephant afterwards. We were a little concerned about bathing the elephants as had heard mention of leeches. We did wear long trousers with socks as a precaution but feel we needn't have been worried. The bathing area was‚Ä¶
Awesome ride,Best experience in life you should do once in life.Elephant are well trained neat n great ride.All should do once.
100% kids enjoyment,"if you have your own transportation,it is difficult to find the place without google maps,as it is located deep inside after passing through narrow country roads.they have about 5 elephants and the minimum package for adults here is rs.400(rs.200 for kids) for a 30 minute ride‚Ä¶"
VENUE FOR ELEPHANT ABUSE!!!,I went to this place with my family and we were shocked at to see elephants being abused openly. They beat the elephants with sticks that has sharp metal hooked tip. We watched in horror as the elephants were beaten until they succumbed to the demands of the caretaker. The most‚Ä¶
Horrible treatment of elephants,"It was apparent after visiting the Elephant Junction that the animals were mistreated. First off, they are put in an unnatural setting that is not healthy for them. The most distressing thing I witnessed however, was  the obvious beating of an elephant. To get the elephant to‚Ä¶"
Elephant ride,It is a jumbo ride for 20 minutes inside a private players. At least five people are offering jumbo experience. This one is on the city and offers discount if you go through an agent
A clear change from normal life,"The green surrounding and the beautiful elephant are just breath taking and yes they do have a lot of good knowledgable people. The elephant we went on was jayalakshmi and we along with our kid enjoyed thoroughly. We thought it may be tough for elders but they enjoyed too.. a half an hour ride on elephant viewing the pepper, beetle leaf and elaichi plantation is lovely. The elephant keepers try to make money for elephant hairs, be careful... But as a whole a great ride and lovely experience üëç"
Best activity!,"This should be in your to-do list if you are visiting Kerela! A must go place and a must do activity.It offers you options like elephant ride,elephant bathing, feeding along with few more. Full of fun and joy. Price is little over higher side, but these guys spend a lot on elephants so its ok!Each penny paid is worth the fun!"
An awesome outdoor activity that kids and grown ups will just enjoy!!!,It was truly a memorable experience and we will always cherish the moments that we spent with and on the elephant. The kids had an absolutely wonderful time and though we didn't do the elephant bath due to various reasons we really did feel like we missed much. I am sure there will be some who would not agree to that but basically that's how much we all enjoyed.If you visit thekkady this is like a must do...
It was awsomely entertaining,"It was our first ride with elephant. My little kiddo throughly enjoyed. The elephants were quite disciplined, maybe they were taught well. Nice experience"
Awesome Experience!! ,Kids thoroughly enjoyed the ride.. The elephants are well trained and the ride so smooth that my 2 year old dozed off while riding the elephant.. Mother nature has her sweet lullaby indeed.. 
Wonderful experience,Had a wonderful experience at üêò junction... Kids enjoyed bathing elephant and elephant shower... If going in Holiday season...please pre-book the ride
Memorable Experience,We get a various variety of rides and every ride is a good value for money. The Elephants are very friendly and be rest assured that you will have a memorable experience. Only thing you need to be careful about is that get a clear assurance as to when would your ride be and what‚Ä¶
Wonderful experience,There are many types of ride and we chose an one and half hour tour I think it was 1250/person. And its worth of money. We had an elephant bath too in it that was an memorable experience. We wait around 35 minutes for the ride. But they take care of us . awesome and caring‚Ä¶
Wonderfull,"It was so fun and wonderful experience, our kids was so happy and they enjoy feeding the elephants , riding elephants and give an elephant shower and take one. The staff are so friendly too"
Really So Good!,"We liked it so much! we also paid a little extra to feed the elephant after the ride. the only thing I would love to see change in is the number of rides a day. I think it carries way to many people in one day. But still, a beautiful experience"
Kerala tour,The elephant junction was fabulous.We enjoyed elephant baithing with family.The elephant was well trained and was throwing water on us while we were sitting on the elephant.
''WHAT AN EXPERIENCE'',Incredible experience!!!!Though we waited for one and a half hour for the elephant ride and but it was worth.We took a 45 mins ride it was great.The bath was an overall a different and a great experience.Its was so much fun can't express.
Must for young children ,It was a wonderful experience especially for my young daughter. She was scared initially but then loved it. Well advised by trip advisor and we could reach the site without any help from locals just used the google map. Tavel advisor rocks....üëç
Fun junction,"Elephant junction no its fun junction  The experience was incredible. When we enter into the gate with my Family Shriraj  Welcome us in royal way. He is very funny, informative, fluency in language, attractive, magic to attract people.  As per his suggestions we decided to go‚Ä¶"
Awesome Experience ,Though there is a long queue for the Elephant ride but it worth it.. That experience is wonderful when you sit on an Elephant and he moves.. That excitement while riding is very different.. They took a small round but the way Elephant moves when we are riding is awesome.. 
Elephant safari,The elephant bath is full paisa vasool... even the elephant ride is very good.... but the management of ticketing and queuing needs to improve... the time span for rides that they commit while selling tickets is overhyped but still the experience is amazing a must to do on ur‚Ä¶
"Everyone love elephants, We were literally became children again","Enjoyed alot, we did elephant ride, elephant bath, elephant shower, elephant feeding, elephant photo session, coffee tea session. We bought elephant hair for rings!   We were literally like kids, enjoyed alot with our 3 year old son. Amazing Experience. We were Grip of 5 adults‚Ä¶"
Fun elephant ride. ,"Young kids will love this. The gentle giants walk along a kilometer within a plantation of coffee, cardamom, coconut etc. Great opportunities to take some pics with the elephants "
Kids will enjoy,We had the ride of elephants with my kids . The enjoyed a lot . 1 hour waiting for our turn to come . The ride was just if 15 minutes. But for kide u should must do.
Elephant ride,If any person wants a elephant ride then it is a good option. 3-4 KM from city and easily accessible from road
Couples opt for a photographer ,At the elephant ride.. Try to go for the professional photographer to capture your special moment.. Our photos came awesome and we were very happy..they took such amazing photos of us.. And the ride is also enjoyable
Awesome place for elephant ride ,The elephant ride was too good. Kids wanted to bathe and take a shower with elephant for which we took a package and it was really good. Everything was perfectly arranged and well executed.
Fun for children's ,"Elephant junction is a good place for children's to experience the daily life of elephants be it feeding, bathing the elephants and offcourse riding.Overall, a good place."
Give a try !,"When I decided to visit Thekkady with my family, I earmarked for Elephant Junction based on TripAdvisor reviews. We were welcomed by elephants carrying visitors. There are various packages and we opted for Elephant Ride + Giving Bath to Elephant + Elephant gives Bath + Feeding + Photo Session + Tea/Coffee. The elephant takes you to tea plantation and brings you back. Bath and Feeding happen behind the reception. All of us loved the entire experience. Please ask for Sreeraj to coordinate your package. He will explain things and answer your queries in English and more importantly, take beautiful pictures. To locate the reception, you would have to walk a little from the parking and go past the raised platform to climb aboard the elephant. Don't miss it if you go to Thekkady with young children."
