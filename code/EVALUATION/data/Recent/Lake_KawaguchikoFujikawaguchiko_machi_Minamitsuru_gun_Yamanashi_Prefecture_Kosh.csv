views 🤩,Went to check out this place since I missed booking a tour of Mount Fuji. I hopped on a train from Tokyo and did a self guided tour. Lake’s pretty with great view of Mt. Fuji.
Nice get away ,"Great walking area, hiking , bike ride and places to eat.No need to stay at expensive hotels there rooms from 5000 yen up is all you need as the beauty of the surrounding will keep you outside.Can’t wait to go again."
beautiful,the lake is very beautiful. you need to explore this area for at least a day full. try hot springs is a must
you wish to stay there longer,the lake and its surrounding is amazing you feel the nature beauty and the air going inside your lungs to give you health.amazing place
Best View of Mt. Fuji,"A multitude of attractions provide one with an opportunity to have a glimpse of Mt. Fuji; however, Lake Kawaguchiko gives one a beautiful panoramic view of Mt. Fuji, accented by the serenity of the lake and the clear skies above it. There's no need to linger too long in the area (especially as it can get a bit crowded after some time since it's a highly popular tourist spot). If you're looking for an excellent private tour operator, do consider Joey's Van and Chauffeur, +81 90-1778-3759(Viber/Line)"
Must Visit!,"Lake Kawaguchiko is one the the Mt Fuji 5 Lakes. It's very convenient to travel from Tokyo by train, highly suggested to get a Tokyo pass and reserve the seat.Also, it's highly recommended to rent a bike, the best way to travel around the Lake. There are many nice cafes and restaurant around the Lake area."
Mt Fuji panorama,Worth every penny. Great for all ages and breathtaking.The view of the mountain made for some spectacular photos.
Mt. Fuji view,"Lake Kawaguchi is one of the most famous lakes in the Mt. Fuji area. When the weather is crystal clear, you will find the amazing view of Mt. Fuji. It's worth a visit even if it's only to take picture from the side of the lake."
Worth a visit ,Incredible and magnificent lake Kawaguchi view with Fuji mountain. It’s not easy to get there taking about 2-2.5 hours from Tokyo to Kawaguchi but it’s totally worth the time.
Gorgeous Views,"An inexpensive, 20 minute boat ride takes you out onto the lake and gives you some of the best views imaginable when it comes to Mt Fuji. The day I went was perfect for it, so every yen spent was absolutely worth it. If you’re heading to the lake, it’s really something you can’t afford to miss."
Great views ,We had a lovely boat ride on the lake. It came as a package ticket with our Mt fuji ticket. Very pleasant and great views.
Nice view,"nice view nice weather, you guys should come here at least one in your life. just take taxi from kawaguchiko st org walk to this lake."
Nice views but ... horrible city,"If you like to see a wonderful region from a bus or a train it’s perfect. If you come during the summer season and like to hike the Fuji, too.But during the winter season, it’s risky, as it was for us. Hard to find trails along the lakes. And impossible to climb the mountain. And the city has absolutely no charm, many restaurants, but a feeling to be in a lost suberb of a small American town.So choose very well when you come to visit"
Very picturesque,"We stayed in this area in an Airbnb. Very easy access to the station which had trains and buses. The bus routes give you the opportunity to eat a two day unlimited usage pass for 1500 and use the red, green and blue lines.  We used to travel around lake to hop on and off to have a meal and then head to ropeway. Was a beautiful area to enjoy the peace and quiet and just relax and take in the sights.  Lots of restaurants and shops. If you want to see Mt Fuji would definitely recommend basing yourself here at the lake."
Beautiful place,We absolutely loved this place! We hired bikes and rode around the lake one afternoon and it was just gorgeous. Will definitely be back!
"Relaxing place, good gettaway, a few hours from Tokyo",Nice to rent a car drive away from Tokyo for a night or two.  Scenery is nice with a large outlet near by.  There's this fantastic tempura place there I usually visit.  Hotel was pricy but worth it (with private onsen in the room).   Good view of Mt Fuji on a clear day.
Beautiful peaceful lake,"Quiet, peaceful and beautiful lake. Strolling along the lakeside for picture taking. There are a few restaurants, souvenir shops in the area. Also can take the Ropeway to have a better view of the lake and Mt. Fuji."
peacefully place to visit,"i went there in Dec 2019, lucky the sky were clear and i can see Mt.Fuji. it is a place to visit for relaxing, just sit and see the nature around, lets the busy life behind"
Breath taking views,My son and myself decided to take a walk around Lake Kawaguchi and we loved it. It had snowed the night before so we were in heaven. So many great views of Mt Fuji and she was STUNNING. Highly recommend coming here in winter.
One of the best spot to view Mt.Fuji,"In my opinion, one of the best spot to view mt.Fuji on a clear day. And especially good to watch the sunrise and set. From Kawaguchiko station you can take the redline bus and get off around stop 16-17. Also if you are here in the winter, your chances of seeing Mt.Fuji is higher than other season."
Best views,"Simply walk around the lake for some of the best views of Mt Fuji In winter time the afternoon sun plays havoc, my best photos were taken early morning before the sun became to glarey We were staying in a hotel overlooking the Lake and Mt Fuji, felt very spoilt"
Picturesque view ,"Best spot for photo taking as you stroll down the lake side. Recommend to ride on Red Line bus and stop at bus stop number 16, the best spot as you see most Mt Fuji shots are taken. Picnicking can be a good option to spend time here."
Great views on a clear day of Mount Fuji,Great place to stop for lunch as part of a Mount Fuji tour. Stunning scenic views including on a clear day (which I was lucky to have) views back to the Mount Fuji peak.
Lake Kawaguchiko,If you are lucky enough to get a hotel with a view an upper floor is a fantastic place to see the lake. There is a road you can walk around the lake or there are local buses. Some place have bicycle rentals also. It was cloudy so we went up the ropeway to see the beautiful view of the lake.
Beautiful lake,"Mt Fuji is surrounded by 5 different lakes. Lake Kawaguchiko is one of them, close to Fujikawaguchiko-machi, the largest town, where you have the train and bus stops. The lake is cristal clear and calm and several water activities can be done. If you're lucky you will see Mt. Fuji from there."
A full day trip from Tokyo,This is a very pretty area and I wished we had left Tokyo a few hours earlier as it was a bit of a rush after traveling via several trains to this spot. Loved the snow there and had a wonderful lunch in the village area.
Great views of mt Fuji ,Loved the quaint atmosphere and the unbeatable views of mt fuji. We spent a night here on a clear day and it's been unforgettable.
Convenient vista point for Mt Fuji,"One of the best vista point to see Mt Fuji.There are many spots along the north side of the lake that has clear view of Mt Fuji. Adequate parking , bathroom and eateries at the stops."
Nice View from the hotel room; too cold when we visited,Nice location and view point from our hotel room at the Kukuna hotel; unfortunately way too cold to experience the lake in itself.
20km bike tour for the Amazing view.,Rent a bike and tour this lake for 20km. You will visit some amazing place with awesome view that other people didn't see.
Very Beautiful Nature,"As a nature lover, it was very fulfilling to feel the atmosphere of this lake while enjoying the view of both the lake and Mt. Fuji. Highly recommended for nature lovers."
Great View if you Want to see Fuji-San,"We love the area. Peaceful, clean, and serene. My husband and I enjoyed  strolling  around the area. You can see  the the Mt. Fuji anywhere you go. We visited early December and the sky was very clear, we had the vivid view of Mt. Fuji. Please be familiar with the bus system so you can enjoy going around the area."
Beautiful ,"For unobstructed views of Mt Fuji, this is one of the spots for breathtaking photos. Hop on the red line bus service at the train station and pay ¥390 as you get down"
Day trip from Tokyo doable! ,"For those with limited time, a day trip from Tokyo is totally doable - and worth it provided that Mount Fuji is visible that day. Would recommend checking the live cams before you head to the bus station. Also, plan on getting there a little early - you may have to wait in line to get tickets (some vending machines do not work with foreign credit cards, but not an issue if you have cash on hand). Once you're there, you can get around the lake area by bus - the two-day ticket  (no one-day pass at the time of my visit) is a decent option and will allow you to hop on hop off as needed."
"January 2, 2020 Visit/ sightseeing.","We took bus from Tokyo to the Lake.Beautiful lake, stunning view of Mount Fuji.Japanese tour bus guide Yuki (UK) was very courteous, helpful & considerate without compromising tour or travel rules especially for group of around 40 persons.Fuji san wa Kirai desu.Arigato ghozaimas."
Absolutely stunning lake,"This lake is absolutely stunning.  It reminds me of Lake Wakatipu in Queenstown NZ. Serene, calm and very easy to walk around. Great views of Mt Fuji and surrounding mountains. Very peaceful."
Nice drive around ,Very nice and scenic drive around the lake. Small little cafes and shops are found along the route.Plenty of photo opportunities to capture Mt Fuji (weather permitting).
Lake kawaguchiko,Beautiful lake in cold winter. We walked a slow stroll from Kawaguchiko train station around 20minutes. There are signboards in English along the way. Dont bother taking the red bus and waste precious money.
Beautiful lake,"One of Mt Fuji's five lakes. Many activities all year round including boat trip, fishing, and trail walking. Summer and winter might be the best time to visit."
Many nice sights of Mt. Fuji,"My favorite sight for Mt. Fuji is when you cross the bridge and turn right, there is a small tunnel and right after the tunnel you will have a beautiful view of Mt. Fuji. When you go the other away there are many other beautiful sights too (like Kawaguchi Natural Living Center, this is also a bus stop)."
Beautiful,"Breathtaking, beautiful view of Mt Fuji.The view is what picture postcards are made of.... But postards can't beat being there yourself."
World iconic scenic location,"Mt Fuji, one of the world iconic defining scenic view. Can be view in many other locations in Japan BUT this location likely to offer plentiful of sites not only to view, also to be close to nature while enjoying the views. lakes, trails, mountains, etc. Plenty of lodgings and onsen to put up a few nights. Finally a not widely known fact is that this location host the biggest area for Japanese wines."
Beautiful lake ,"Impressed by the beauty of this lake. Mount Fuji's reflection and clear view of Mount Fuji is the best....but not impressed with the general service standard in this town. From hotel staffs, to bus drivers, information centre staffs and sales staffs...unfriendly n unhelpful...no warmth in service. People were super nice when I move to Nagano."
Beautiful lake view,Self drive to Kawaguchiko Lake. The view at the lake was so beautiful. Unfortunately we are not able to see Mt Fuji due to cloudy weather.
Mt. Fuji is a gem,"If there is one thing that you should not miss in Japan, it would be seeing Mt. Fuji. I was fortunate enough to see the magnificence of Mt. Fuji from Lake Kawaguchiko on a beautiful sunny day. The lake itself has a lot to offer. There are even selfie stands at ideal vantage points in the area."
Top Trip,Great View of an Excellent Mountain and the Wonderful Energy. (and this last words are just to fill in nothing)
Just like a picture,Was so beautiful to walk around the lake and have the view of Mt Fugi at your side the whole time. Was very easy to walk as nice and flat. I noticed some paddle boats that were shaped like swans in the distance. From a distance they looked like real.
Breathtaking view,I went to Kawaguchiko Lake by taking Bus from Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal as it took approximately 1 hour 45 minutes journey with price 2000 Yen for 1 way. The atmosphere at the lake was so soothing and calm. Found 1 halal restaurant just apposite with the Lawson at the lake area.
Lovely lovely lake,Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here. We are already planning to visit here again. We walked around the perimeter of the lake and the view was breathtaking. One of the five lakes near Mt Fuji.
Amazing scenic view of Mount Fuji,"We took the Highland bus from Shinjuku Bus Terminal to Lake Kawaguchiko station and arrived at about 9.30 am. Journey is about 2 hours. Currently ropeway is closed for a week more or so. So we bought red line bus tickets and took to stop 9 to hike up Mount Tenjo. The start of the hike is next to Fujiyama Cookie leading to a resort. It is not a difficult hike but it has many steps. About close to an hour hike. It is rewarding as you get to see it from a higher view. Thankful we came on a day that it was clear skies.We then hiked down and took bus at stop 9 again to stop 20 (last stop). There will be many people alighting there too to view Mount Fuji from the lake. Very beautiful and it's breathtaking. There is a cafe there too if you want a drink or ice cream. The blueberry and vanilla ice cream was delicious.We then took the bus to stop 15 for the Forest Music Museum. However, upon realising that the entrance ticket is about 1800 yen, we aborted the plan to visit and started taking a stroll down. We chanced upon a walking trail along the lake and started walking. Very relaxing. About 45 mins trail. We ended up at stop 9 again for a cuppa coffee and matcha before taking the bus back to main station (stop 1). We had booked our bus back to Shinjuku which departed at 4.40pm. We waited for the red line bus at stop 9 at 4.11pm but the buses were full and did not stop for us to board. We ended up missing our bus. However, we went to the ticket counter to explain our situation and they were very kind to allow us to take 5.10pm bus instead. We were back in Shinjuku by about 7pm. It is a must-go place to view Mount Fuji. Really love the view."
Beautiful,"A quiet and peaceful lake. You will get to view Mount Fuji from different angles, from ropeway or from the boat."
Lake Kawaguchiko and Shibasakura Pink Floss Festival,"After several visits to Tokyo over the years and getting our fill of the city sights. and even the outlying areas like Hakone, Yokohama and Kamakura, we timed our latest trip in time for the Shibazakura pink floss festival in early May 2019.  We booked our bus tickets to Kawaguchiko (Jpy 2,000/OW) on line and boarded early at the Expressway Bus Terminal across the Shinjuku Station south exit.  The ride took around two hours with a few stops along the way.  We got off at the Kawaguchiko Station and the first sight that greeted us was a partial view of Mt. Fuji. Beautiful!   I guess we were early and lucky since Mt. Fuji is shy in spring and usually covered by clouds most of the day.  We bought our round trip bus tickets at a booth right beside and off we went to the Shibasakura pink floss fields.  In one word, the sight that greeted us was AWESOME!  We saw a vast field of flowers in various shades of pink, mostly in dark pink.  They even had a miniature Mt Fuji with the real Mt Fuji in the far distance.  We circled the fields with a long photo stop at the viewing deck and a food stop at the far end.  Roasted corn, local food stuff and even skewered wagyu beef cubes.  Then back to Kaguchiko station by bus for a late lunch of the local specialty hoto fudo, a large bowl of hot udon and veggies soup for only around JPY 1,000 and enough for two persons.  Then we rode the sightseeing bus red line around the eastern shore of Lake Kawaguchiko, planning to ride the Kachi kachi rope way.  But there was a thunderstorm alert so the ropeway was closed.  We just satisfied ourselves with photos of the tranquil lake and the beautiful scenery.  Then back to the station to catch our ride back to Shinjuku.  We found out that the best unobstructed view of Mt, Fuji is along the Station fence on the right side.  Finally, back to Shinjuku and dinner.  Definitely worth the day trip!"
"Scenic Lake, Great Mt Fuji View,","Took the Red Line Bus from Kawaguchi Station to #9 stop where we took a boat ride on Lake Kawaguchi. On a clear day in autumn there's lots to see - lakeside accommodations, colorful trees, mountain ranges, and most of all, a splendid view of Mt Fuji. You can also buy a combined ticket that offers both the boat ride and the panoramic ropeway located just across the street from the pier."
Beautiful lake,This lake is in the middle of some mountains and it has beautiful view of Mount Fuji. You can take a boat ride too
Wonderful view of Mount Fuji,"Went there from Tokyo in mid of November 2019. We could see the mount Fuji clearly, all day long ! We were so lucky, because the next day, we couldn't see the Fuji from our Shinkansen train on the way to Osaka, because it was a cloudy day and the cloud obstructed the view to the mountain. I suggest to check the live streaming Fuji view before going to the Kawaguchi lake to see the mountain.There was an autumn festival and the sightseeing bus (red line) run slow due to heavy traffic. Please get the tourist map, there are some bus stop to visit interesting places around the lake also good spot to view Fuji.I recommend to have IC card for taking the bus.There was a park next to the lake, where maple trees with colorful leaves during autumn season make this place good spot for taking pictures and picnic."
Lake Kawaguchiko and Mt Fuji View in Autumn -- WOW,"The online Japan Guide said that Kawaguchiko was at ""peak"" and yes it was!  Instead of taking horrible buses, my son and I walked from the train station to the lake and walked by spectacular fall foliage and got a few incredible shots of ourselves, maple leaves and Mt Fuji. We did go up the ropeway, but the clouds and fog had rolled in, so Fuji-san was not visible, but the view from there was awesome. The maples along the lake were must nicer than the momiji area and much less crowded. Wear good shoes."
Great for seeing Mt Fuji. ,"We took the lift up from te lake to the viewing point, and were Lucky there were hardly any clouds. The mountain looks brilliant, but a lot of the times it hides among the clouds, so take notice of that. Aroun the lake there are some great scenic spots. We took the loop bus to visit the lava and the ice cave, which weren't really special."
Outstanding View to Enjoy Fuji Mountain,"Love fuji view from this spot, in Spring you can also enjoy triple view of sakura bloom, fuji and lake at once."
Amazing lakes and view of mountain,We will come back for 2020 for fujisan marathon very nice except for bus drivers eho are really rudes and not speaking english
"The boat ride, must do.","We bought the boat and rope way ride set-ticket around $15 for an adult. The boat ride station is just a minute walk across from the rope way. It was beautiful with good weather, highly recommend."
Perfect Lakeside Getaway!,"Katsuitei Ohya Hotel on the lake was amazing. Cute little town away from the busy city.  Lots to explore on bike, bus or walking.  Sake Store and Tour.  Boat Cruise on the lake very relaxing, the short gondola ride to the top of the mountain...all just a 5 minute walk nearby hotel. We had an awesome stay in this little town and we would love to return and stay longer someday."
Lake Kawaguchiko,Arrived evening and saw portions of Mt Fuji peaking thru clouds all day. Next morning from 8am allDay was magnificent view.
Big Lake,It’s a big lake with gorgeous views. Bike rental is available or get a daily bus pass. Fujisan is in clear view from the south side. Plenty of food and accommodation options around.
Great Area,"We stayed here for two nights. We could have stayed longer. Having nice weather makes this place, we have a beautiful day to cycle around the lake & stop to look at the many sights. There are plenty of accommodation options from budget to luxe. Getting to the lake was made a little difficult from the recent Typhoon, however usually there are plenty of options with trains."
Scenic lake,Very beautiful lake with some swan shaped paddle boats. There's a variety of attractions around the lake and very good public transport to get around.
Very nice lake with Fuji mountain view,I've been to Lake Kawaguchiko many times. It's a nice lake with a beautiful Fuji mountain view. The food around the lake is nice.
Past Its Best,"The lake and surrounding mountains and forest are incredibly beautiful but the lake precinct seems to be suffering from a bit of neglect - damaged pathways, sunken boats and jetties and litter. All quite unusual for Japan. Walking and riding around the lake is a great way to spend a few hours and boat (including fishing) trips are available. Still well worth a visit though."
Gorgeous Lake system of five,"Beautiful lake. View of Mt. Fuji, weather permitting. The on off red line bus is a good way to explore. For fishing folks, it turns out to be one of the best bass waters in Japan. Many bass boats!"
"Shinny Fujisan smile at us , soooo lucky ","We stayed 3 nights near the station . During our stay, it’s too cloudy and we’re not able to view Mt Fuji. On last day 23rd Oct , before we left kawaguchiko  ... we manage to view a bright and shinny Mt Fuji..... we’re impressed , it’s in front of us ..."
Beautiful Lake ,"My wife and I walked around the lake on the 24/10/2019. We would have preferred to ride a bike but the ground was too wet and it would have been dangerous.We underestimated the time this would take. It took us 4.5 hours to go around the lake, it's about 20km and only 80 percent is track and the rest is road. Wear some good foot wear if you're going to walk. We were exhausted by the finishing line. Lol. It's definitely worth seeing."
Boat trip on the lake,We took a boat trip out on the lake. It was nice and relaxing. The main purpose of the boat trip is to get a better view on Mt Fuji. Unfortunately for us it was cloudy and we could not see the mountain.
Great view of Mt Fuji,"Very relaxing city , full of surprises! Great view of Mt Fuji! Good for family, couples and Adventurous person ❤️❤️❤️"
Stunning on a clear day,We were lucky to have perfect weather to view Mount Fuji across the Lake. We enjoyed coffee & pastries in a lakeside garden and then drove to other lakes around the mountain. Wonderful day.
In the rain ,Came here and it rained!! Comjnf from ireland I did not want to see rain but it rained!!!! Nice spot if its not raining
"Mt Fuji, breathtaking","What a wonderful place, so relaxing, we stayed in a lovely hotel overlooking the lake which was close to the cable car and boat cruise, what an ideal location."
Nice place to enjoy scenery of the lake and the mountain,"Stay in Kawaguchiko to enjoy the town, the lake and the view of Fujisan.  Take the train to see the surrounding town and walk by the lake to watch the locals and their daily lives."
4/5,"Came here for my morning runs pass the place, it’s quite a sight, just that there are probably more scenic lakes around the area.Ambience: 4/5Cleanliness: 4.5/5Fun: 3.5/5Physical Ease: 5/5Value for Money: 5/5Would recommend a walk around the area, or maybe an evening or morning jog. Quite like this place, strongly recommend for nature lovers."
The Majestic Mount Fuji and a Day in the Lakeside of Lake Kawaguchiko,"After our cultural trip at the Itchiku Kubota Art Museum, our party of four decided to enjoy Oishi Park on the north shore of Kawaguchiko.  It was a perfect afternoon, with sunny skies and a nice breeze.  We seated ourselves in the park table and ordered snacks.  Ambiance was very restful, there were rows of various flower blooms, yellow roses, daisies, hyrangeas and weeping willows all around.  There is a walking promenade along the lakeside.  There were many tourists both Japanese and foreigners, families with toddlers, and dog lovers with their pets in tow.   Mt. Fuji can be seen on the far horizon and for a short 20 minutes, the skies cleared and we were able to take good photos.  I even tasted salted grilled salmon on a stick and some native rice cakes.  The Kawaguchiko Living Center served to provide food, Japanese souvenirs and clean rest rooms for the tourists."
Stunning Lake!,"The lake is very beautiful and could very well be in the Swiss Alps. We walked around the lake and stopped in at all the sites along the way, it’s a fantastic day out!For those not up for walking )it’s about 19 km), I would recommend hiring bikes or a car for the day, it’s worth it!"
Very peaceful,Walked around the lake. Bikes can be hired if you like. Lots of places for meals and drinks or icecream. Can also hire boats
Beautiful! With or without Fuji.,"A beautiful lake surrounded by lush, green mountains including the ever so shy Mount Fuji, who only appears occasionally! Plenty of accommodation and dining options. Frequent local  tourist buses in the area, only 150 yen per trip."
Serene Lake with view of Mount Fuji,You can get a better view of the lake if you take the Yurasen or Kachi Kachi Ropeway. It is about a few stops away from Kawaguchiko Station by the Red Line Sightseeing Bus. There is also the boat ride pier in across the ropeway entrance.The lake is blue and beautiful and you can see the iconic Mount Fuji towering over it. It is recommended to come before noon since there will be a lot of clouds past morning.
Great Lake,"We really enjoyed the lake. With the fantastic views of Mount Fuji on our boat ride. There are many options to go out on the lake (swan boat, tour boat)"
Unlucky,We were unlucky and didn't see the Mount Fuji because of the clouds so there was nothing to see. And it was very difficult to find a taxi afterwards.
"Check the weather forecast to enjoy the view: Spring, Fall and Winter are much better",If you check the weather forecast and stay there for a long enough time you can take pictures like this.
Outdated,We are staying in Kawaguchiko for a couple of days to see Mt Fuji and also went to see Lake Kawaguchiko with a combined ticket for the Mt. Fuji Panorama Ropeway and Lake boattrip. But both the Ropeway and Boat are in need of some modernization to say the least. For viewing Mt. Fuji from the Ropeway and the boat you are depended on the weather of course. Ropeway was very crowded both to top and down. And without a clear view on Mt. Fuji you won't spend much time on the top.Boattrip takes around 20-30 mins. While there I would recommend doing both or one but we expected a bit more to be honest.
You take your chances,"Even if you don't see Mount Fuji, as shown from my photos, it is still picturesque site. I do recommend that you spend the ¥14000 to book up for the whole day's bus tour."
Lovely scenic spot,Really nice area with plenty of walks and hikes and on a clear day a great view of Mt Fuji.Waters are really clear and some really nice mountain walks for the more active.
Beautiful view of Mt.Fuji with the lake in the foreground ,"This was the last stop of the day long trip to Mt.Fuji from Tokyo, by Japan Panoramic Tours. It is a beautiful spot with the crystal clear water of the lake forming the foreground to the spectacular view of the snow clad Mt.Fuji.   There are some eateries by the lake side. Don't forget to try the blueberry ice cream."
Absolutely worth a day to visit this place,"It will be a total waste if you don’t visit lake kawaguchiko when you are in Tokyo. This place is so scenic and you can see Mount Fuji from here if the weather is good and not cloudy. If you have extra cash, maybe you can consider to take a boat ride and i am sure that will worth every penny ;) You can take train or bus from Tokyo to Lake Kwaguchiko. If you are not familiar with the Tokyo train systems, i would highly recommend you to take bus to save your time. I bought bus ticket from highway buses online before my trip. Make sure you buy return bus ticket in advance as the seats are selling fast."
Great intro to one of the most scenic lakes of Fujisan,"I will warn. You must watch the weather like a hawk if you visit because both times I went the clouds have prevented me from a good view of Mt Fuji. My best view was on the Shinkansen. However, even if you can’t see Fuji, the walk, the views, and general vibe of the area around Kawaguchiko are fantastic. I really can’t emphasize how the walk is great and scenic in and of itself."
Great Views of Mt Fuji,As we were leaving the area by car with our private guide heading back to Tokyo we stopped for some views of the mountain with the lake in the foreground. It was on the road out of town so definitely worth stopping for some final photo opps!
Great way to view Mt Fuji,We took the speedboat to view the lake and Mt Fuji.  Great way to see it all in 20 minutes.  Beautiful lake and views of the mountains.  Great pics and photo ops.  Can’t go wrong being on the lake.
What a view!,This is almost the perfect spot to view the majestic Mount Fuji and it looks fantastic on a clear day.
The long lake,"Lake kawaguchiko is the utmost attraction for the toursist. You can see the mighty mountain Fuji all around the lake. This lake is always swarming with people and various activities are going on. You can do fishing, explore the area by cable car from above and by duck boat in lake. There are resturants,"
Beautful lake,this is a lovely lake with the reflection of Mt Fuji is just incredible. Beautiful to just stroll around the lake as it does have a path around some of it
Beautiful lake,"It is a nice quiet and beautiful lake. Wish there are more things to do there, other than the swan boat and gondola."
Beautiful ,"Very beautiful, good place to take picture . Good place to have a walk with family. Less commercials compare to lake ashi ."
Beautiful walk,We got up very early and walked all around the lake. We got amazing views The Whole time of Mount Fuji!
Beautiful ,What a lovely place to visit for the day. The lake is quite large and they rent boats to paddle around in. It is easily walkable from the train station area.
Beautiful ,Stayed in this area of Kawaguchiko for 2 nights to walk Mt Fuji. This lake was a beautiful scenic location to stay with many local restaurants and bars nestled along side the lake . Just below the magnificent Mt Fuji which reflected in the still waters. We can highly recommend this as a great location to launch yourself up the mountain. Easy train ride from Tokyo to Otsuki onto Kawaguchiko . Then the local shuttle bus up to station 5 . Only $aud32 round trip. From station 5 you can view the valley of 5 lakes including this one .
A beautiful lake with easy access from the train and bus station,We rode around this lake on local hired bikes. The views around the lake was gorgeous and there were some interesting places to stop off and look at. Access is signposted from the station and it’s downhill all the way.
Beautiful Lake,"Important: Mt Fuji is often overcast, it’s rare to see without clouds. Still, worth the visit though!I recommend going to one of the Mt Fuji lakes while in Japan. This is a good one to go to, but Hakone has a more enjoyable rope way (if it’s open). We went in May 2019, sat and enjoyed the lake, viewed the lake from the rope way, and went to the Sake brewery for a tour and tasting. This was an excellent mid-day/afternoon."
Shades of blue...,Myriad shades of blue mark the lake that is nestled amongst the majestic mountains. One can enjoy boating too 🛶 or just sit by the placid lake and relish the picture perfect setting!
Pleasant but nothing special ,The place was nice with a rather nice view of Mt. Fuji but there’s really nothing spectacular about it. Just alright.
Great view on mount fuji,So glad we decided to go to Kawaguchiko. There is obviously no guarantee with regard to the weather. But when mount fuji makes an appearance it sure is magical
A large lake,It was alright depending on how cloudy it is. If the sky is clear then u can see mount Fuji - then it will be amazing.
Beautiful ,SadY our stay was full of rain and clouds but you can see why this is a great place to visit. The lake is beautiful even under stormy skies.
The water and Fuji make the frame,"We went to Kawaguchko by bus from Tokyo, as we were told that seeing Fuji in its glory was a sure shot from here rather than from Hakone which depends on the fog. We were delighted by the entire experience through the day, The ropeway took us to a point from where Fuji was absolutely magnificent. Then we took a bus to a further point, from which we walked back around the lake with the views of Fujisan continuously accompanying us across the expanse of water."
Walking around the lake,This is a great location to walk and spend the day. There is a breath taking view of Mt Fuji and the area around has many gardens.
"For me, this place offered one of the best view of Mt. Fuji","This place is absolutely breathtaking! There are no words to describe seeing the ""Sakasa Fuji"" when you get up just before sunrise. The stillness of the volcano, amidst a clear purple sky is an emotional experience."
Great views,Mount Fuji changes by the minute. Recommend you spend some time at the ボートハウス・ハワイ boat rental service near Komaya Ryokan.  It has stunning views and basic drinks.
Great views of Mount Fuji,"Spectacular up close views of Mount Fuji, the cherry blossoms around the lake are also pretty. There are lots of small museums,  a monkey show?, etc. nearby"
When the sun came out....,It had been a wet and overcast day but as the sun came out one could begin to see the pretty lake as well as the emerging base of Mt Fuji
A relaxing way to enjoy the lake,The spectacular lake sparkles in the sunshine and twinkles in the moonlight. It is lovely to be there as the cherry blossoms bloom on the lake edge and the visitors come and take in the sights.
The perfect day,"I highly recommend checking the weather before coming.We stayed one night because we wanted to take it slowly, but it can also be done in half day. We booked a hotel 2-3 months in advance even though Kawaguchi-ko is not touristic as we were expecting. I would recommend to check the weather first and then, eventually, book something last minute, because the chances of having very bad weather and not seeing Fuji are very high. And it would be a pity not to see it.We were lucky that the day we arrived (25.04.2019.) we had a beautiful and warm day. As activity we rented 2 bikes for 2 hours and had a little trip around the lake, the bike rental is not expensive and there are several in the city.If you can find a sunny day during your vistit to Japan, make sure to stop at Kawaguchi-ko."
Lake tour by bike ,"Do not miss the chance to tour around this lake and see all the beautiful landscapes that it offers. It's less touristic to do the full tour than to go only on the northen shore. Our advice is to bike it all, it's 20km and also you have nice places to eat around the lake very authentic and not touristic."
Powerful and serene ,The Torii of peace at the shrine on the banks of the Lake Kawaguchiko  is a picture perfect spot. We had to line up for the spot and I normally would not have thought that it was worth the time. However the pictures were great and the spot below the the Torii is supposed to bring you peace. Beautifully delicate Sakura line the roads and dot the mountains. The climb up the steps to the Shrine of the fox apparently brings luck in business and the power point is said to gift you with extra abilities. I will absolutely recommend the trip.
Beautiful scenic... 1 day trip,"This place is picturesque and no words are good enough to describe it. So after reaching Kawaguchiko station, we took the red line to go around the area. Sakura trees are still blooming too."
Small Charming Resort,"A stopping off point for many travellers due to the station being close to Fuji. Get away from crowds with a stroll by the lake, particularly the North side (walk anti-clockwise round shore)."
Saw Fuji-San but otherwise disappointing,"As the title of the review says, we did see Mt Fuji very clearly and it is a beautiful sight from across the lake - so you do need to get the bus around the lake to get the view. Thought the bus was very expensive for a one day pass - almost three times the cost of Nikko for example - and for that price you still have to stand with the crowds, as it was packed every time we got on, even in mid March when the whole place looked quite dry and barren. I'm sure it would be prettier in summer but I can't even imagine what the crowds would be like. Thought the whole place was just 'touristy' and characterless and not worth the effort of getting there"
Beautiful place for photography,One of the best places to view mount Fuji and practice photography skills. A great place to walk or to hire a bicycle and ride around.
Good view and perfect weather ,Liked the walk around the lake.. Perfect clear sky.. Worth the visit.. Walked around lake worth.. Also nearby Mt fuji Ropeway was although crowded was worth the visit.. Did not tried boat tour on Lake probably next time
Mt Fuji At Last,"If you are in Tokyo for more than a few days try to get here. This is one of the best spots to view Mt Fuji, if you are lucky enough to have good weather and clear skies.There is a train that will get you down and back easily and is more comfortable than the coaches that go down every day from Shinjuku. The trains are always on time whereas the coaches have to put up with Tokyo traffic on the return journey.We walked around the lake to admire the views from different locations, even having time to stop off at a wonderful doll museum.On the day we went it was overcast so no Mt Fuji in the morning but at midday the skies cleared and we had beautiful views."
Beauty below the mountain,"The lake itself has a sightseeing ferry that is well worth it, the combo deal with the nearby Ropeway was what we took and we were not disappointed. Both have good views, even when Fuji itself is hiding."
Out of the world!,We had an amazing experience The Sakura were blooming and there was snow on the day we reached there but we had clear and amazing views of Mount Fuji the next morning
beautiful place ever!,"good view, good atmosphere, I'm so exciting when I saw the fuji mountain with clearly. you should ride a bicycle and jogging around this place."
Mount Fuji lake areas ,"Probably one of the best and closest place to view Mount Fuji Best - spend a night or two and visit different spots and enjoy different fun around. There is a west and east lakes. Ride the train from Tokyo or shinjuku station. It’s very easy and no hassle. When reaxh lake kawaguchi station, ride on the round trip buses (depends on which route you want to go), you can purchase a 2 days bus Ticket or just use the per trip ticket if you are visiting just for a short day trip.Weather is the key consideration. You should make your research on weather before u head down to this place. Some seasons or some part of the days u may not be able to see the mountain at all due to the bad weather or seasonal issues. I’ve tried a one day trip and 2 days trip. One day trip will need a bit of advance planning and hit and go approach. For eg you May take the bus and stop at 2 stops and u may need to head back to city before it it getting dark.For Sakura season, do stop by at the Arakura Sengen Shrine, you will not regret the view from the top of the mountain... but be prepared to walk up a 400 steps staircase."
Heaven on Earth!!,"My family and I took the bus from Shinjuku Station to Kawaguchiko for a day trip and I am so glad we did. We were lucky enough to be there on a very pleasant and sunny day. We saw Mount Fuji in all its glory! We rented bikes and cycled around the lake (approximately 20 kilometers). Along the way, we came across tons of delicious street food, beautiful shrines, and, quite possibly, the most scenic spots."
Glorious views,Lake kawaguchiko offers fabulous views of the mountains near mount Fuji as well as views of the Fuji itself.We took a ferry boat tour to allow full viewing of the whole lake.The boardwalks around the lake are wide and clean.
Amazing view ,"Wow, you would really be shocked of seeing how beautiful this lake is. You could see the great Fuji mountain if the weather is good, clear of clouds, exactly like the day we went here. Fuji mountain is really a must see place whenever you visit Japan."
Great one day trip around Lake and View of Mt. Fuji,"Took a day trip from Tokyo and purchased a loop tour on the Red Line. One of the major attractions was riding the cable car uphills for a view of Mount Fuji with lots of photo taking opportunities. Unfortunately the day we got there was quite foggy and we didn't get such a great view of Mt. Fuji but had a great time exploring the small town and surrounding attractions, such as the Museum of Music History, which was part of the red line bus tour. It is advisable for anyone who really wants to have a thorough view of Lake Kawaguichiko to start early, arriving no later than 9-10 am. We took the highway bus which was a nice 1.5-2 hr trip from Shinjuku but there are also alternative routes such as the train. If you really want the full experience such as spending time in the Onsen might be best to spend at least one night."
Speed boat ride & Panoramic view,"Beautiful panoramic view. Speed boat, paddle boats and a steamer is available for 15 to 20 minute ride.We were a family of 5 adults and 2 children and hired a speed boat for ¥10000. We enjoyed the 15 minute ride thoroughly."
Lake with amazing view of mt Fuji,We stayed at a cabin on the far side of the lake over the bridge. From there we a a beautiful view of the lake and if you are lucky with an amazing view of mount Fuji. We stayed there for two nights. At first it was cloudy and miste. We drove to the 5th station were we parket the car and walked the Ochuda trail. Higly recomanandable! The second day we visited two small museum and the weather got better in the afternoon. Than we had a wonderful of the mountain. Really nice area to stay.
Just before cherry blossom,"We went to  Kawaguchiko after three days in Tokyo. First time visit. We found it easy to navigate as Americans. Hop on/hop off bus tickets purchased at train station. We got lucky and went on a Friday. The lines were not bad to get tickets. When we left on a Sunday morning the line was enormous. But it is the height of Sakura season.   We stayed in a traditional Japanese Ryokan hotel and the experience was amazing. The view of the lake spectacular.  We spent a day touring around the lake. Views of Mt Fuji from many spots are breathtaking.  Only negative, the town it self appears a bit run down. Buildings look old and not well kept. Many buildings were closed and shuttered. But odd considering number of tourists who visit the area. But we were very safe and enjoyed ourselves immensely.Can’t miss Mt.Fuji and a nice contrast after Tokyo."
"Touristy, not much to do outside peak season","We visited end of March/early April and while they eere preparing for the sakura festival, mostly everything was closed or had modified hours. There is enough to do to kill 4 to 5 hours but no more then that."
nice lake,"lake is nice, at the foot and with view of Mt Fuji. It is a small lake. boating is available and enjoyable."
Good views and day trip,"The lake is clean, the people is nice and the mountain is nearby, all good for a stroll around and enjoy the views."
Best Place to See Fuji,"The lake with Mt. Fuji in the background is just breathtaking, aside from seeing Mt. Fuji, there are a lot of things to do and see in the Kawaguchiko Area."
Lovely place ,"Is a great place to spend the day with kids. Has a lot of food places, kids activities like duck peddling boats, fishing rentals , cable car, speed boats etc"
Lake Kawaguchiko,"Kawaguchiko Lake is not far from Kawaguchiko Station. Can rent a bicycle or can buy retro bus to sign 5, there is a cruise point, watch the lake and take a basket, but the wind is very cold"
Kawaguchiko,The lake Kawaguchiko is one of the best places to see in Japan. There are several stunning landscapes here and Fujisan looks pretty cool from Kawaguchiko. There are several restaurants around the lake and it is possible to visit other lakes in the region by bus tours.
Superb view of Mount Fuji ,We as a group of photographers went there to see and photograph this beautiful lake which has fantastic views of Mount Fuji. We stopped by at the Oishi Park that is next to it. The view is incredible on a clear day. There is walking traxks on some parts of the lake.
"Love the place, very romantic","Amazing views around the lake, you can walk along distances near the lake and pass towns if you are for a long walk, the towns are very traditional, the same as the food."
Rent an E bike!,"Definitely worth a visit during Sakura season.We rented an E bike and also rode around the lake and also to Lake Biwa, for a round trip of around 30km.There is also a Fuji museum that has photo exhibits and a very quaint cafe."
Easy trip by bus snd well worth it,"Check the weather before you go. Winter is the best time to go, but there can still be cloud cover. In winter the mt. is covered in snow and really stands out. The shops and restaurants around the lake are fun to explore. They have a hop on hopnoff shuttle"
Beautiful place,"A beautiful lake with magnificent view of Mount Fuji. Was here a bit late, Mount Fuji was covered by thick clouds. Hope to going back there again with good weather!!"
Serene and beautiful ,Heart of Fuji! The lake is quaint and beautiful and clean. You can see the shy Mt. Fuji wake up in its glory for sunrise. Easily accessible and not very crowded.
Stunning area,"We visited this area mainly get views of Mt Fuji.However due to the cloud cover this was not possible.We did however spend a day around the lake arera using the shuttle, visited the viewpoint via the ropeway and went on the pleasure cruiser boat. We also enjoyed a lovely dinner here.The day was a very enjoyable one and this is one of the top spots in Japan to visit."
Best view of Mount Fuji,"This is my second time visiting Mount Fuji but this time from a far, we arrived at the area just in time and luckily we saw  view of Mt. Fuji very clearly and from 2nd time  still gives me chill seeing it even from afar. We also got the chance to took pictures of other areas of the lake. Visiting this area i the morning is the best idea as we noticed that before 12nn the mountain has been cover with clouds already.  Worth the visit!"
Nice View of Mt. Fuji,"We visited Oishi Park, where we could see magnificent view of Mt.Fuji. Fuji Oishi Hanaterrace is nearby with many nice little shops of sweets and made-in-Yamanishi souvenirs as well as many comfortable  cafes. You can enjoy the view of Mt.Fuji while sipping a cup of coffee."
Beautiful spot,This is a lovely spot - even in winter. The loop bus is cheap 1500 yen for two days which offers a hop on and hop off around all the attractions. Very nice town with friendly people.
Lake Kawaguchiko in Autumn,We visited Lake Kawaguchiko in autumn and it was one of the most picturesque places we went to in Japan.  I would recommend to stay overnight there to be able to see the surrounding communities.  We only spent a day there and we had to rush back to Tokyo late in the afternoon.  We took the bus from the Shinjuku bus terminal in Tokyo.  Mount Fuji was so majestic in the morning but partly hid in the afternoon.
Good photo opportunity!,"Good place to stop by for a photo of Mt Fuji and a stroll around the lake whilst taking in the stunning majesty of the landscape. Not much else to do though in winter... If coming from Tokyo, just bear in mind that the temperature is quite a bit cooler in this area so come prepared especially if you don't take the cold very well (e.g., scarf and gloves wouldn't be a bad idea)."
Great view of the lake and Mt. Fuji,"Relaxing, with a small park /garden near the shop(cafe and souvenirs). Can take great pictures of the surrounding lake and the Mt. fuji as a background. Postcard perfect."
Great views of Mt. Fuji,"Small touisty town on the edge of Lake Kawagucjiko with great views of Mt. Fuji. Can be very busy during the day, especially on week-ends & holidays."
Beautiful in all angles!,"With a clear sky, Mount Fuji can be seen easily. Take the ferry tour to see the awesome view of the lake and mountain."
"Awesome place, different season  with different view","A must to make some photo stop around Kawaguchi lake. Stay one night if possible so you will have a chance to stroll along the lake and take some great photo. You can make your stop at several stop place. They have toilet and some stalls to sell Japanese ""yummy food"""
beautiful!,"Such a great place to see Mt Fuji, its very rural and lovely on that side of town! I recommend checking out the wacky Music Museum as well!"
Beautiful clear view!,"Signed up for a day tour and lucky us to have a clear view Fuji san! The tour guide has mention that Fuji-san is always shy to meet people. Guess we are one of the lucky lots.Enjoying the blueberry ice-cream with the view of Fuji san just makes the trip so much more memorable.Seems like nothing much to do here, except to appreciate the beauty of peacefulness here."
One of The Better Places to See Mt Fuji,Our second stop in our Mt Fuji tour was Lake Kawaguchi were you could photograph Mt Fuji in its full glory if you are lucky enough to have clear skies on your visit. During our stop there were low lying clouds which covered the tip and most of the parts of Mt Fuji but we enjoyed the calm lake and the serene beauty of the area.
Nice walk,We walked from the station to lake kawaguchiko and it was a nice walk due to the weather.A good experience even enough we didn't get a good glimpse of MT Fuji was it was cloudy that day. But it wasn't an issue as we could do the same at our hotel the day before and after.
Fuji san view from boat,"A must try activity when you visit lake Kawaguchiko, viewing Fuji san mountain from roof top of boat."
Nice Walk along the lakeside,"We took the local sight seeing bus from the train station to whereever you want to stop. You get up on the bus from the rear door and take a ticket. Then as you come down  the bus at the front, you pay the driver into the counter..with coins only. We just got down as soon as the bus turned into the lake side. We took a walk to the Ropeway that was 20 minutes away. It was a pleasant walk along the lakeside with a far view of the land on the other side of the lake. Yellow and red maple leaves decorated the streets along the lakeside. They were beautiful. We stayed until dusk and the sky slowly turns dark against the sunset. If we were to come here again, we need to spend 2 days to explore the country around the lakes of Kawaguchiko. Then you can really relax and feel that you are on holiday!! And not chasing trains."
Serene Lake with a picturesque view,"One of the 5 renowned lakes surrounding Mt. Fuji , this place is so beautiful and serene. It serves as a picturesque backdrop to the famous volcano as well . Good for photo shoots, it is nice to have it during winter time as well . The day when we visit was favourable for our group. We were able to admire the snow capped Mt Fuji without the clouds blocking our view. There is a souvenir shop and snack bar for that last minute buy or food as you want it."
Pretty lake ...,"I did not quite attempt to go around the lake. I only approached its shores and it was really pretty. From where I was, the lake was in front and Mount Fuji behind me. From the opposite shore, some lovely shots of the lake with Mount Fuji in the backdrop could be had."
At strategic positions to capture idyllic views of snow-capped Fujisan and its reflections,"Kawaguchiko (Lake Kawaguchi) is one of the Fuji Five Lakes in Fujisan regions. Although it is the second largest lake among the five lakes, it is the most visited location due to its strategic position associated with views and convenient access to the sacred Fuji Mountain and national parks. It was included in UNESCO Mt. Fuji Culture Heritage assets in 2013. It also has a well-established tourist system that aims to promoting the natural and cultural environment of Yamanashi Prefecture. Sightseeing around Lake Kawaguchi is easy by taking Kawaguchiko’s sightseeing buses which are available all year round. There are three color coded lines that go around the area of Five Lakes. The most popular line is Red Line which mainly serving attraction sites around Lake Kawaguchi and Fuji Mountain, Japan’s most sacred mountain and an iconic symbol of Japan. Many hotels, tourist establishments, amusement parks and entertainment facilities were built up round the edge of the Lake to serve increasing demands of tourism from around the world. Many tour buses, private or JR trains are in high demands during Spring to Fall, but winter can be very cold to visit since attractions in the area are involved with outdoor activities. A day-trip visit is possible but if weather is bad then your plans to see Mt. Fuji or walk around the Lake can be a waste of your time since it takes approx. 2.5 to 3 hrs. travel time by bus or trains from Tokyo area. Hotel’s location around the Lake and views from hotel properties reflect price of lodging. Hotels where you can have non-obstructed views of Mt. Fuji from your hotel/rooms are priced higher than others where views of Fujisan are partial or blocked. Nevertheless, the sightseeing Red Line buses run around the Lake, so you can do hop on and hop off when you arrive at the location where views of Mt. Fuji are at its best. I found Red Line bus stop between #14 Kukuna Hotel and # 15 Kozantei Ubuya is the best location to see Mt. Fuji at the center point. You can also ride the Red Line bus to the last stop #22 Kawaguchiko Nature Living Center, however, you will encounter a lot of tourists at this final stop. I highly recommend that visitors take the morning walks around the Lake especially when weather is nice, and sky is clear. The morning time is the best time to see Mt. Fuji’s symmetrical reflection projecting onto the surface of lake water; except when fisherman’s boats passing through and stir the waves.  The serene settings of snow-capped Fuji Mountain combined with aqua blue lake water make the most desirable nature backdrop for the photographers all throughout the four seasons. Spring’s cherry blossom and Autumn’s vibrant red and orange colors of foliage change are two most popular seasons to visit and prices of lodging go up accordingly. JR trains only run from Tokyo to Otsuki; from there you connect private rail Fujikyu to arrive at Kawaguchiko. Once you exit the station you will find sightseeing buses and other long-distance highway buses stops in front of station. If you plan to stay longer than a day-trip then I suggest that you buy Kawaguchiko Sightseeing Bus Pass and your choice of unlimited rides for one or two days. The bus ticket booth is located just outside of the Station. Staff, with ability to speak English(or may be other language such as Chinese or Korean) helps guiding the passenger's waiting area and keep queue line in order as well. Some hotels provide shuttle pick-up at the hotel’s shuttle pick up stop, on the right side of the station when you walk out; however, you must call the hotels when you arrive and get pick up at stop #10. Kawaguchiko is the most visited site in Mt. Fuji area and tourism services are excellent but pricey."
A piece of heaven,"so this is my favourite place around Japan so far. with its beautiful scenery, with Fuji Mountain on the background, you'll make the best instagram-worthy picture for sure.If you looking for a more calm and relaxed atmosphere, then visit Kawaguchiko is a must.From Tokyo, we prefer to use a bus instead of train (JR Line). You can book the bus via online.And for transportation around Kawaguchiko itself, just purchase the Kawaguchiko 2 day pass ticket which you can use for a bus ride around Kawaguchiko and its surrounding. You can buy the pass at Kawaguchiko Station.Believe me, 1 day visit is not enough to go to Kawaguchiko, you will need at least 2 days to enjoy the Kawaguchiko for its best!"
good place to see Mt Fuji,"It could be a day trip for you to see the popular sightseeing spot of JPN, Mt Fuji, there are many little shops and restaurant, museum and such, so a day trip in here is just wonderful and excellent"
Nice lake with mount Fuji in the background,One of the famous lake around mount Fuji. Lake Kawaguchiko is clear and is very nice because excellent view of mount Fuji. Blueberry ice cream at the gift shop is very tasty
Beautiful lake surrounded by mountains,"Our hotel had a view of the lake and it's very calming, a nice change of pace after busy Tokyo. There are some activities on the lake - you may ride a boat or water bicycle."
Relaxing and Beautiful,"Everybody goes to Hakone, so we decided to go to a lesser known spot in Kawaguchiko. We have since been back 3 times.This place is excellent for romantic walks around the lake, as well as excellent views of mt.fuji. It has also less tourist as compared to Hakone.Give it a shot."
Meeting Fujisan,"Get in a bus e.g. from Tokyo station and go visit this small town and see great Fujisan. Walk around the eastern part of the lake or hire a bike and tour the whole lake in a few hours. Visit a wonderful Ichiku Kubota Art Museum and see awesome kimonos. You'll get the best photos of Fuji on the road there. Please notice that if you are going to come back to Tokyo around 4-5 pm, buses might be full."
Great location to explore Mt Fuji area,"Very picturesque lake with great views and amenities in the vicinity. Total walk around the lake is ~6hours but well worth it, in autumn with the leaves changing colour the walk is quite nice. The south side of the lake is more commercial, the north is a little less spoilt."
Beautiful lake breathtaking mount fuji view,I stayed in  cottage 3 min from the lake. It is so beautiful. I wish i can have more time to rent a bike and cycle around the lake.Would visit this place again
Must see in Japan,"Kawaguchiko was one of the highlights of Japan for us. The view of the imposing and beautiful Mt Fuji across the lake was breath-taking. The scenery in Autumn was fantastic and I highly recommend going in this season as the fall leaves are unlike anything I've ever seen. Must see the maple corridor and Oishi park for great Fuji views, but i wouldn't recommend the music forest museum. However if you go in autumn/fall it will be very very busy with other tourists and the local bus that navigates the lake will be packed, so just keep that in mind."
Nice relaxing view,"Nice relaxing view unfortunately too foggy to see the mountains, many onsen hotels around to choose from"
The wonderful moment at Kawaguchiko,"The wonderful moment at Kawaguchiko , After visiting Kawaguchiko from our perspective this place is one of the best place in Japan that provide many activities and sightseeing for outdoor recreation for example pedal boat, cycling, cable car and many activities among the good environment including sightseeing. People who come to this place will not regret because of this place is very cleanliness there are not have any trash on the ground and it easy and convenient to come  because of the transportation is easy to access for instance train and  bus. Moreover you can touch with the nature’s atmosphere that make you feel relax and there are shuttle bus that took you to each sightseeing, you can drop every sightseeing that you want to spend time with.It also have the buss pass for 2 day that you can use and there are  3 color of the shuttle bus which are the red one for sightseeing around the lake , blue one is for Motosuko lake and the last one is green one for Saiko lake. If people who want to spend time more not only one day there are a hotel provide for the tourist and it is comfortable. If there are some people who don’t want to take shuttle bus you can rent the bicycle  or bring their own if you want for cycling or you can walk along the road if the stop point is not far too much and you can touch with the surrounded and atmosphere around there. In addition , you can buy a souvenirs from the shop and enjoy your lunch or dinner at the restaurant it is very delicious. For a little bit bad point of this place that we would like to suggest to improve  are about less of garbage bin in that place. We think that there are some drink machine provide to the tourist and also have a shop that sell food or snack they should provide more for the tourist in every stop point and also near the toilet too. For the next factor we think it is about less of english signages for the foreigner because there are many stop point and there are many bus line or symbol alone the road they should provide it with english language or international language that popular to make sure that they will not miss understanding and they understand. Because when we ask about some thing japanese people don’t understand us in sometimes it can make we miss communicate.  So, if  you are looking for one of the wonderful place to go and spend your leisure time why don’t you try to go to kawaguchiko,Japan that you can see the Fuji mountain and have activities there. We highly recommend this place to go once time in your life and you will get a good memories and fell in love with this place."
Beautiful on a sunny day,We stayed here in a Ryokan facing the lake which is the best way to enjoy this area to the full. There is a bus which takes you to the other side of the lake in around 20-25 minutes from the starting point. At the last stop there are some recently developed gardens with views of Mount Fuji and a 20-30 minute walk further on you reach the maple corridor which in mid November was at its peak. From here there are great views of Mount Fuji. Half way round at stop 11 on the bus is the Mount Fuji ropeway viewpoint and entry point for pleasure cruises on the lake.All very peaceful and serene.
Third time lucky,"It is such a beautiful place, which makes me return to the same place for the third time. Different views during spring and autumn, evening and day, for each time I was there. The only downside is over the years, the small lake town gets more crowded and touristy. Recalled it used to be quieter and more peaceful when I first been there years ago. If possible, do stay a night at one of the ryokans facing the lake. Otherwise a day-trip is good enough too. For autumn trip, take the town bus all the way to the maple festival area, and have a good stroll along the lake, stopping mid way for some local food such as hoto noodles, then stroll all the way to the bus terminal. By doing so, you can avoid the tourist crowd who usually will take the town bus."
"gorgeouse view, cleanliness but hard to find the garbage can","Well organize of cleanliness, gorgeous view easy to travel,and also keep their cultural whitin civilization as wellbut very hard to find garbage can i public area, so we have to keep the garbage with us until the end of the day and here is one of the most popular attraction for everyone who came visit japan, so it is feel a little bit cramped during this trip."
Pretty in November,"It's busy in momiji ( autumn colour) season. If you stay overnight, chose a hotel with a view of the lake and mt.fuji. Upside down mt.fuji (mt. Fuji's reflection in the lake) is one of the attractions at lake kawaguchi."
A delightful cruise on the lake,The lake was just in front of our hotel so we couldn’t resist taking a trip on it. The views were lovely and the autumn colours were at their best when we visited the lake. Our ticket entitled us to a trip on the cable car as well.
Nice place to get a view of Mt.Fuji,Big lake with many possibilities to hike around. Offers some perfect spots to view Mt.Fuji and has some other activities to do too. Lovely nature and city.
The beautiful Kawaguchiko lake,"The Kawaguchiko lake is a beautiful lake at the feet of the Mount Fuji.To go, we took the bus at Shinjuku station in Tokyo to stop at Kawaguchiko station.The lake was around five minutes from the station.When we arrived, we rents bikes to do a lake tour.There is a bike rent when you arrive at the lake on the left, you just have to continue the road and you will see it.I recommend to do a lake tour, we did it and it was beautiful, we saw neatly the Mount  Fuji because the weather was very nice."
Stunning,"My partner and I stayed a 10min walk from the lake on Oct the 26th for 3 nights. We hired some bikes and rode around for a day, went to the music museum, perfect weather. We went on the 26th of Oct '18,. Koyo (autumn leaves) everywhere and there were stunning sunsets over the lake. There is a little pathway leading just out over the lake to a clump of rocks on the side of the lake closest to fujiyoshida, we got the best pictures from here at sunset. I'd quite happily return here during autumn, very pretty."
Mt. Fuji being covered up,We have visited Kawaguchiko on 2nd and 3rd November but unluckily Mt. Fuji was totally covered up because of the inclement weather.  Anyway it was still nice to tour around the lake and took photos on the scenic spots. Lake Kawaguchiko was more photogenic in the morning hours.
Autumn Leaves Festival,It was amazing to walk along the Maples Leaves Corridor near the Art Museum.  The colours during the day were different when the night lights were turned on.  I was blown away by the beauty of this place.
Peaceful ,"We had a great time exploring Lake Kawaguchiko via the sightseeing bus. Just a day you should be able to cover the major attractions. If you want to see most of the lake, I recommend you take the pleasure cruiser or if you’re up for some exercise, rent the paddle boat located near the pleasure cruiser (the swan and panda boats) Beautiful lake!"
Beautiful Lake ,Colorful during autumn! There is a sightseeing bus that takes people from Kawaguchiko train station to the maple corridor (and interesting stops in between) and back. There is a 20-30 minute boat ride at stop number 11 (red bus line). Souvenir shops are located along the main road.
Morning time from 5am to 11am is the best time to visit,I suggested you to buy 2 day bus ticket (1500 JPY)then you can use unlimited bus for all 3 lines. First bus will depart at 9:05 amGo to red lin first and direct to cable car to prevent long queues.
Lake cruise,Very pleasant but short trip on the lake. Beautiful views of Mount Fuji. Trip could have been longer.
Do the Boat Ride! ,Such a peaceful and clean place! We did the boat ride for ¥1000 I think and man the views were amazing! It was a shame that it was a cloudy day so didn’t get to see much of Mt Fuji but it was still awesome!
This a lovely area of Japan.,Could have stayed in this area for a longer period due the great lake and all the lovely spots around this area.
the mirror,"from here you can see the great view of mount fuji, and the shadow of mount fuji on the lakethe good time for see the fuji is early morning"
Magnificient view ,Magnificient view of the lake. We took the hiking path panorama dai to look for mount fuji it was about an hour to the top.
Great views,"We hired bikes from the outdoor place across the road from the station. The bikes were in great condition.  1000 yen for 3 hours, which was plenty of time to ride around the lake. We were there at dusk, and there was a beautiful view around every corner. Mt Fuji was covered by cloud. Mornings may be better."
Great To Cycle Around,We had a great day cycling around the lake. Lots to see and do along the way. The weather was kind which made it even better.
Winter trip,Kawaguchiko lake is beautiful even in winter. Because we can't climb mt. Fuji in winter so the best way to see is from this lake.
Beautiful even the bad weather,"We spent nearly the whole day at Kawaguchiko for waiting to see just the stand of Mt. Fuji but no lucky on us, However this lake still very satisfied us in the many ways like the beautiful local people way of life, local food and the relaxing vibes.The transportation system was friendly for the visitors and cleared explanation on map, just stand to the right side and place, you can access almost areas of this place.We just found out by accidentally that from you can walk from the lake and reach to  the bus station within 10 mins (or below, but look at the sign board and direction carefully)"
Enjoy,"Enjoy the scenery, prepare your camera and ensure battery is fully charged! The Mt Fuji view is depends on your luck. So when you are able to view, must grab the chance to snap photos, don't wait till the next day or you may not be so lucky that can see it again... we were lucky enough the first day get to see the Mt Fuji, the second day was full with fog....Bit, i just love this place."
Beautiful lake - worth cycling around ,Rent a bike and go for it. Likely to take a couple of hours and probably worth stopping along the way but a must do when visiting!
Beautiful place,"Blessed with good weather and clear sky early October, lake is beautiful especially with surrounding trees enabling lovely photos with foreground lake and magnificent My Fuji in the background. This is the place to visit for good view of Fujisan."
stunning scenic .. with BIG crowd from around the world,"We took a bus from Tokyo to Kawaguichiko so that we didn't have to change train but it was a long weekend and the traffic is so bad that caused us 1:30 hrs more on the road each way .. so it was a bad decision. Once we got there, we took an advice to buy a sightseeing bus ticket (red and green lines), which was kind of convenient. But the bad thing is that everybody did the same thing and the bus was so crowded and the line was really long. Sometimes if you tried to get on the bus at a station in between the route, the bus was packed (especially the red line) so you couldn't get on and you had to wait for another 15 mins for the next bus to come. The green line runs every 30 minutes, you should plan your trip carefully. Try to pick the hotel near the city center or around the Lake if you go during weekend/ long weekend. Because, to me, bicycle seems to be the most convenient way to commute during the busy period."
Beautiful to cycle around and take photos of Mount Fuji,"We got the JR express train to Otsuki from Shinjuku, then changed to the Fujiyama line to Kawaguchiko. Once at Kawaguchiko we checked out the maps at the info Centre and decided to hire bikes instead of going on the tourist bus. What a great decision! An easy 5 Min ride down to the lake and it was fairly flat all the way around. Lots to see and do. Boats, museums, parks and plenty of pretty scenery and viewpoints. We had the bikes for 3 hours and rode around half the lake and across the bridge, stopping for lunch at the museum and to take photos. Unfortunately Mount Fuji was hiding beneath the clouds, but the overall lake and mountain scenery and the ride itself made for an interesting afternoon. Wished we had stayed overnight. Didn’t have time for the ropeway or to go up to Mount Fuji 5th Station. I think late October would be nicer with autumn colors. This area is a must see if you want lots of photo ops of Mount Fuji. After we dropped the bikes off we had dinner at the Mount Fuji View Restaurant right opposite the station and what do you know, Mount Fuji popped out from beneath the clouds for us. Spend at least a day here if you can or even overnight. This is an iconic and stunning place."
A break from tokyo,We came up from Tokyo to see Mount Fuji but unfortunately it was very overcast. The lakes were very pretty although kawaguchiko is quite over developed. The town has a local feel to it and we enjoyed ourselves wandering around savouring the slower pace of life. Many tourist come up to try and see the mountain and leave within a day but it is worth staying the extra night to allow some local sightseeing.
Beautiful place,I really wanted to visit Fuji Yama and I stayed near the lake area cuz was very beautiful. You can find many shops and restaurants around the lake. It’s very nice to have a walk around the area or just seat to look at this beautiful lake.
Stunning View,"I always wanted to visit here, the view is just stunning, I would love to build a house just stunning here and looking at the lake with the mountain background. Totally awesome!"
Nice contrast to the hustle and bustle of Tokyo,"I recommend Kawaguchiko as a nice balance to Tokyo for your trip to Japan.  It's about a 90 minute train ride with one transfer which takes you through some nice scenery of the country. There is no bullet train option to my knowledge. Kawaguchiko is a nice resort area with multiple hot springs (onsen).  We stayed in a Ryokan (Japanese style inn) that really embodies the Japanese experience with excellent traditional food, in room hot tub, and easy access to the lake as well as Mt. Fuji for those inclined to climb it.  I asked my kids if they preferred the first half of the trip spent in the hustle and bustle of Tokyo to the serenity of Kawaguchiko and they definitely preferred the latter."
Its a MUST,"Like any other lake, its beautiful lake... but with Mount Fuji as a background, its extraordinary.The windy weather makes the scenes more hardly to forget. The best time to go there is before noon.Bring jacket."
The best place to see Mount Fuji they said,"Too bad that I came after typhoon so there's only thick cloud, I can't see Mount Fuji at all. And the lake looks unfriendly too, wavy and the color was so dark. I hope someday I can go back and see the beautiful side of this lake with Mount Fuji as it's background."
Beautiful Lake with Mt Fuji in Background,"Definitely a place not to be missed. Do stay at this location for 1 night as the day and night view is amazing. Although there is nothing much to do in the area, it would be a great place to relax and enjoy the scenery. Go for a morning jog and you'll definitely enjoy the view around the lake."
A beautiful place away from Tokyo,A place not to be missed for those who wanted to travel to Tokyo as it's just about 2 hours bus ride from Tokyo.  You will be able to admire the magnificent view of Mt Fuji from the lake if the weather permits.  Locals enjoy fishing there.  A place which can provide you with calm mind and you will feel rejuvenate again!
What a Beautiful Lake,Our Family LOVED spending time at the Lake.  We had rather do lake activities than visit the Shrines.  Had a blast and hope to visit again.
a place with too many things to do.,"this lake offers a lot. the easiest way to get around here is by join the tour bus in the center. along the route, there are pit stop and we can get off the bus. from the nice view to restaurant and mini museum. it needs two days to cover the lake. there are some point that we can get the best view of mt fuji. one of the must visit place is iyashi no sato nemba, a place like a small museum and dont forget to try the matcha ice cream. is has a strong matcha flavor and not the same that can be found in the family mart. if u are brave enough, then can stop at the suicide forest, aokigahara. the also a ropeway in the lake. too many things to list. a must try visit place. i also send a postcard from the center. there is also a tourism center that provide some info with english speaking volunteer to assist you."
Amazing scenery,"The second largest of the 5 lakes, after Lake Yamanaka. We took the Red line bus and alighted at designated spots to visit museums, gardens, onsens and view Mt Fuji by taking the ropeway.  We took a cruise on the lake by taking the sightseeing boat Ensoleille. Scenic view as we cruised along. The high point was when we saw Mt Fuji but it was covered with clouds."
A short ride on the lake,We did the lake-ropeway combo. It was okay. It’s only a 20 minute ride. If there are no clouds I bet there’s a majestic view of the mountain but we did’t have that luck that day. Fuji-san was covered in clouds.
Just so beautiful ,It’s so so beautiful. You can hire paddle boats and go for jet rides. You also can go up the Kawaguchiko ropeway which has awesome views
great scenery,"this place is very scenic, and at the same time very peaceful. however there arent much options to eat around here."
Beautiful views of the volcano from the lake,Boating trips are available on the lake but they are quite expensive. Take the longer trip C for gentle views of the mountain and surroundings.
Breathtaking.....,Both views of Lake and Mt Fuji from far was perfect at this point and it gives breathtaking panoramic to everyone upon arrival here. Scenery from Morning sunrise and sunset to adore at different angle gives you another perspective about this place. Great nature to appreciate while lake excursion can be improve with other language for better understanding info given.
Wonderful view ,"A very classic type of lakes in Japan, with very calm water, simple facilities, lots of onsens in its surrounding areas! The view of Mt Fuji together with the Lake is simply brilliant!"
Fuji-san,One of more famous spot for Japanese peoples is the beautiful lake on the bottom of Fuji mountain and if you go to check there you will totally agree!!
Beautiful view,Beautiful lake with a view of mount fuji (on a clear day). But not much to do here except enjoying the view. Maybe u can try fishing or ride the duck-boat.
Destroyed by mankind,This lake together with Mt Fuji would be a great sight if it weren’t for the settlement of Kamaguchiko which is an ugly assembly of concrete and tarmac rotting at the banks of the lake. It’s been really disappointing.
Nice stroll at lake,"All the books say the best view of Mount Fuji is from the lake, but we found the view to be only ""very good"".  I mean, it's Mount Fuji, so it's not getting a rating of anything less than very good!  However, we found the best view to be from the top of the Panoramic Ropeway.  The short trip to the lake was very nice, where we strolled the flat gardens (plants and flowers, not the traditional Japanese Garden garden) and got a really nice lakeside view of Fuji San.  The souvenir shop was actually very good.  We found a few things that fit our more serious taste, such as a crystal cube with Mt. Fuji engraving.  I'd recommend this venue if you're going to be spending the day in the area."
a lovely lake with interesting attractions,"Staying at a hotel on the lake it was easy to take pleasant and scenic walks to the Itchihi Kobota museum, across the bridge and to the town and the ropeway (without taking the buses).  There were great spots to photograph Mt Fuji too."
Beautiful Lake of Kawaguchiko,"I found it very touristy but the lake is beautiful with Mount Fuji as a background even the snow-caped peak was covered by cloud, still majestic.  Went there end of March. Lots of tourists, it's very hard to get in the retro bus, so had to walk a long way to go back to my homestay. But the view paid off. Nice walk tho."
"Must stay over one night, do a short walk by the lake at night","very peaceful sceneries, if there is such a word.  Lake is beautiful, with so  much activity going on.  Shops and foodie places. Book a place where you can see Mt Fuji in the background, its so amazing."
relaxing place,"if you want a relaxing and slow life, kawaguchiko should be in your list.feel the japanese ryokan, watch the fuji mountain clearly on a fine day. there are some ropeway nearby. and you can take a bus trip package to visiting some tourism spot nearby, many different lake nearby and many japanese traditional things nearby too. i love this place <3"
Relaxing Scenery,"The view was very relaxing since it was very peaceful. There was a small garden near my stay. Some people were fishing there or offered tourists boats, probably to sail around the lake. Of course you can see Mount Fuji far away from here (if clouds don’t block the view)."
Beautiful,"Very scenic and pleasant. Lots of places for nice views. Folks out enjoying themselves. Well worth the time to stop and take this in. Maybe not a destination in itself, still nice."
Serene view of Mt Fuji,Travel off the beaten path by foot around Lake Kawaguchiko for an un-interupted view of Mt Fuji at your own pace.
what a beautiful view!,"it was cloudy when i visit, i cannot see Fuji but i quite enjoyed the lake! even i can’t see Fuji but i got there with disappointment . worth a visit"
What a beautiful lake to walk around!!!,"Such amazing views of Fujisan!!!! And little outcroppings of shops and restaurants around the bends. We even found batting cages!!! Enjoy, fish, boat, or just chill."
Nice,"I biked around the lake, which took around 1 hour for half of it. Many hotels are around the lake. there is also a bus. Not very spectacular to be honest but worth a visit if you are there anyway. Not as many restaurants around as you may expect."
You got to go there,Nice areas. Purchase one day or two rout bus ticket so u can hop on and  off unlimited Take a troll around the beautiful lake or bike around the lake.So much to see there
Beautiful scenic lake,Many touristy stops along the red line bus which takes you around the lake but still very quaint and scenic. We were saying that it gives Milford Sound a run for its money and is heaps lovelier than Lake Geneva.
Lake Kawaguchiko,"Lake Kawaguciko is very beautiful, I love to visit to Japan for visiting the Lake again in the next opportunity and my family are live in Tokyo too"
Breathtakingly great,"I love the place, clean, quiet, relaxing and very organized. Plus you have the Mt. Fuji in the background. Would recommend this place."
AMAZING MUST DO,"Was my favourite place of my trip. Lake Kawaguchiko has stunning views of mount fuji I stayed at fuji view hotel and it was amazing. We hired bikes for 2 hours and road around the whole lake, it is stunning.! A must do. Its super easy to get to as well! Just get to Kawaguchiko Station and its super close from there!"
Beautiful lake with nice views of Mt Fuji - but depends on your luck!,"Top Tip: Drive, cycle, take the bus...whatever mode you use, try to move around the lake to get different views of Fuji-san!!The Lake Kawaguchiko area is a scenic and picturesque location with great photo-taking opportunities of Mt Fuji - in particular, one of the many views of the famous ""diamond"" photo. A great place to visit in every season. However, please note that a lot of this depends on the weather as the view may be lacking if Mt Fuji ends up being covered by the clouds.I have read that it is a great place to do some outdoor/water activity but as I have only visited in periods where it was too cold to do any of such things, I have not tried this personally and cannot comment.There are also many sight-seeing sites located around the lake. Some of these can be worth a visit (I have visited the musical forest museum and found it to be quite pleasant).I would suggest staying in one of the many Ryokans here to relax in the onsen while enjoying the view of Mt Fuji. Konansou is highly recommended (check out my review of it - link below)All in all, worth spending some time here just to relax, chill and enjoy the view.https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g1165976-d1169199-Reviews-Konansou-Fujikawaguchiko_machi_Minamitsuru_gun_Yamanashi_Prefecture_Koshin_etsu_Chubu.html"
 Some decent shots of mount Fuji if she's not hiding.,View of Fuji.  Not the best shots though.... the best for me is still the one with the Chureito pagoda and one on top of the cable car ride.
Awesome view of Mount Fuji,"We got on the Red Line Sight Seeing Bus from Kawaguchiko Station and got off at the 14th Stop. We didn't see Fuji mirrored on the lake but the view was magnificent anyway. There was no crowd when we went, which suited me fine. There's something relaxing and soothing, just gazing at Fuji-san from there."
A beautiful lake with an amazing museum,"If you get to the Five Lakes region of central Honshu, you must drive around this lake (the only of the 5 which is developed) and visit the Itchikue Kubota Art Museum. A Japanese textile artist who dedicated his life to mastering the lost technique of tsujigahana (a painstakingly complex dye technique for silk), Kubota built this museum on Lake Kawaguchiko near the base of his muse, Mt Fuji. The museum's Gaudi-inspired exterior gives no indication of the lofty pyramid-shaped gallery within. Enormous and breathtaking textured silk kimonos hang below massive 1,000 year old beams as part of his unfinished masterpiece, “Symphony of Light,” a series of 80 kimonos which together express the moods and seasons of Mount Fuji."
Amazing lake,lake Kawaguchiko near the Fuji mountain. It’s a good place for taking magnificent pictures. There are many place to go around the lake
Paradise,"We spent two nights at the lake, both in traditional ryokan accomodation, and were simply blown away by the beauty. One had a view of the lake, the other a view of Fuji. We did the chair lift and the cruise and took in the most magnificent views of Fuji. It simply is a glorious place."
Visit Japan,"A fascinating place and wealthy natural, good for relaxing and rest with family. Traveling is not complicated and there are facilities around including delicious restaurants."
The beauty of Mt Fuji,You can find many places in kawaguchiko to enjoy the beauty of Mt Fuji. i can find momiji in autumn season here. The view was amazing.
Cycling at Lake Kawaguchiko,"One of the best ways to enjoy the refreshing nature of the Fuji Lake is to get on two wheels, take advantage of the biking trails that surround part of the Kawaguchiko lake, and enjoy the lakeside and mountainous views along the way."
Peaceful in the morning!,Stayed overnight in one of the hotels around this lake. Took a morning walk and it was beautiful and serene... before the day tourists pours in. You will not tire of taking pictures here. Lots of great views and photo opportunities.
Beautiful lake with a view of Fuji,"We walked around the lake and saw many nice shops, restaurants and resorts. Wonderful view of Mt. Fuji from south side on a clear day."
Nice Lake ,"One of 5 lakes around Fuji.  Probably the biggest.  Provides many great views of Fuji.  You can paddle, ride a speed boat or take a lake cruise to enjoy this place.  A walk around the lake is enjoyable with cool n sunny weather.  Many eateries and small souvenir shop surround the route.   You can find people fishing too."
Great view of Fuji,"We went there in April, a bit cold. renter a water-bicycle (the swan), half hour is enough for beautiful pictures."
Beautiful Lake,We can take a walk from the Kawaguchiko Station to this place. The view is great with some boats that we can ride.
Great,Would Recommend anyone to visit this placeThere are many ways for you to enjoy this By boat by land or from mountain
A must return,Breathtaking view of lake with fantastic stay at Kawaguchiko Uban Villa resort plus fulfilling dreams of visiting Shibazakura Flower Festival.. would be the best part of my Japan spring visit this year❤️
Best view of Mount Fuji,"Stopped off here on our way to Matsumoto its called the five lakes district we stopped by the side of Lake Kawaguchiko at a very nice gift shop which had loverly gardens full of lavender it was a sunny day but alas the cloud cover on mount Fuji made it impossible to see the iconic view which is on all the postcards like most mountains around the world it has to be the right place at the right time, so unfortunately it was a postcard for us don't miss it though you may be lucky"
Enjoy a relaxing afternoon by the lake,one of the largest lake of the 5 famous lakes of Fuji. a good place just to relax and enjoy the view of Mt. Fuji. The are shows around making it a good place to shop for souvenirs and snacks. there are a lot of hotels as well around the lake. easily accessible by any means of transport.
Must see if you come to Japan,Very beautiful nature. Rent a bike and cycle around the lake to see more of it. We came to see the mt fuji view but due to bad weather couldn’t see that. But still happy to have come here to discover the beautiful small town.
Lake,"It's a lake, it's big and it's wet and it's quite scenic I believe you can go on a boat ride but we didn't do this."
Kawaguchiko ,The most beautiful lake ......it’s so beautiful!!!iI like going out for nature walks along the. Lake. It’s so peaceful and calm
Extraordinary beautiful,"For uninterrupted views of Mt Fuji, need to get there early and walk along the lake until you get to the place under the bridge. It's a hidden spot, away from tourists and you can sit by the lake watching the view."
Beautiful Lake,"Very beautiful big lake, good sighting of cherry blossom.  Good place do picnic at the bank of the lake."
Lovely day trip,Came down here for the day to view the lake and Mt Fuji. You can jump aboard a ferry which takes you on a trip for 20 mins and can bundle it with many other options.Also renting a bicycle is a popular way of getting around.
Stunning view of Mt. Fuji !,"Well worth a visit ! Exploring Mt. Fuji and taking a stroll around the beautiful Lake Kawaguchiko, so impressive. Appreciating the beauty of nature and the ultimate panoramic view superb !!! I highly recommend this place if you’re a Nature lover !!!"
Peaceful and great view,"Will be good to rent a bicycle and go around to take pictures. There are a few places to eat before entering the lake, but ensure it's Japanese lunch time and dinner time."
Iconic Fuji View from Lake Kawaguchiko,"The hint is: One of the most iconic Fuji View is taken outside the Hotel Kukuna, beside the two Sakura trees.We arrived on Apr 10 and the cherry blossom is still on. You need walk quite far from there, so that book a bicycle."
Nice place with good views of Mount Fuji,The area is very beautiful and the air feels fresh. The town is quite small and we stayed in a place right next to the lake. The cable car is only a short walk away and we would recommend it. The only negative was when we took a walk along the foreshore of the lake there was quite a lot of scrapped boats and even a mini scrap heap of old boat engine parts. The footpaths along the foreshore are also in need of some maintenance.
"Lovely area, pretty touristy but that's not all bad.","Firstly the positives - the views are wonderful (although when Fuji gets covered in cloud it's not that you can't see it well, someone appears to have stolen it). The lake is peaceful, everything is clean, transport is pretty easy, plenty of loos, places to drink and eat, things to do. This is 90% of my review, I was therefore for a bit less than a week and loved it.It is a bit touristy; some of the restaurants are aimed at tourists and one at least was pretty poor. It's not cheap (neither is any part of Japan), and surprisingly it shuts down quite early. But these are small things; I loved it. You don't need to speak Japanese to be there, English is fine."
Ride a Kawasaki to Kawaguchiko ,"One of the most serene bases to explore Mt Fuji. Convenient to reach, with lots of direct buses from Tokyo (even Narita airport). Several theme parks nearby for young children to enjoy. If you stay on the north shore, on clear days, you can see both Fuji-san and the lake."
Frame for Mount Fuji,This area is in the Hakone National Park and the lake makes a great reflective foreground to your photo
Japanese Bliss,"Perhaps the best Oasis away from the busy city of Tokyo to view both Mt Fuji and experience the Cherry Blossoms during the season.Do yourself a favour and hire a bike and explore this beautiful, quaint little town that serves up all things Japanese. The best part to stay I believe is the strip of hotels that include Hotel FujiGinkei. Once arriving at the station, grab a cheap cab ride to your hotel if you have luggage. There is a great restaurant nearby.The onsen will overlook Mt Fuji in this hotel precint which provide a great stroll amongst the lake. Spend two full days here and the best part is, it is only a 2 hour bus ride away from Tokyo for about $30 AUD. It is simply serene."
Sakura along the lake,We missed the Cherry Blossoms in Tokyo and caught them in full bloom in Kawaguchiko. It was an awesome sight and made up for the early blossoms in Tokyo and other places.Beautiful and serene
Beautiful view. But don't use Google maps to reach there. ,It takes you to a place without view. Select kawaguchico nature living centre which is best view for Fuji.
Strange experience!,Sadly The mountain was not visible to us but we walked around the lake . The first time in japan that we saw rubbish and it was untidy and dirty . So many coaches and bossy traffic wardens waving glow sticks at us . I guess if the weather is good and you see the mountains it’s well worth it .
Family holidays,"Reccomend to visit in April.  Overcast weather, cant see much, but the scenery, the little town is great to be here"
Fun boat ride ,"Spent the day around Mt Fuji, unfortunately could it because of cloud cover . So our guide took us to lake Kawaguchiko jumped in speed boat and got the wind in out hair. My daughter loved . Afterwards we rented a pink duck paddle boat , that was fun and exercise. I could imagine we would have had a very unique view of mount Fuji from the lake. Definitely do it again"
Lake Kawaguchiko - Fuji-san & Sakura,"Our first view of Mount Fuji was with clear blue skies, perfect view of the lake with sakura in shot as well. The lake was an excellent to base our trip to visit Fuji-san and we loved the area. Spent 5 days touring around and was a great experience. Highly recommended."
Best place for photos ,In addition a good place for a base to get to mt Fuji if you are looking to trek/climb/hike.  Breathtaking views of Fuji all over town provided you have clear skies.  Does get a bit chilly in spring so make sure you are dressed warm and comfortable!
"Easy access to a beautiful lake filled with activities, parks, and restaurants/hotels","Our visit to Lake Kawaguchiko was combined with a visit to the Chureito Pagoda, on a long day trip from Tokyo by train.  We started with a late lunch lake-side, then walked around the lake towards the park.  The walk from Kawaguchiko Station through town was 10 minutes or so.On a clear blue sky day, Mt Fuji was in full view, simply beautiful.  We spent some time souvenir shopping as well, the shops were full of unique items.  They also have a lot of food sampling.  We found mochi really good in this region.  Other items are pretty reasonable as well.Because it was cherry blossoms season, the trip back to Tokyo had the direct express train that did not require a transfer in Otsuki Station, that made the trip much shorter and easier.We are very glad we made the trip.  In the future, we will definitely spend some nights here.  The area is beautiful."
Onsen trip ,Enjoy the relaxing of Kawaguchiko Town and love the onsen in Yurari. Day trip is good enough if you stay in Tokyo. Take the earliest bus from Tokyo Station or Shinjuku is can to have the best view of Mt. Fuji.
Nice Fuji mountain view,I love this place. Lake & mountain view with full of Sakura trees. Nice weather and good for walking around the lake areas.
A great lake to walk around,"Because we didn't want to wait for the bus we walked from Oishi Park to Kawaguchiko Station, which took about 2 1/2 hours. And it was beautiful! Lovely footpaths with cherry blossoms, beautiful photographic view points of Mount Fuji. Some parts of the walk were more oriented to maintaining the natural charm of the lake, other parts are developed to cater to tourists. All in all a very nice walk."
Just amazing,"A trip to Kawaguchiko is a must, not only for the lake and the marvellous views of mount Fuji that you can get, but also for the variety of attractions existing around it. it took me a whole day with a rigorous plan to see as many places as possible but it was not enough.Of course, it is necessary to get the one day bus pass in order to be able to move freely around the lake. it is a great saving of your transportation budget."
Nice enough,"Nice enough lake to visit, enhanced if they clouds let you have a view of Fuji.Shops around are somewhat touristy.Lots of parking, free when we went in mid April but who knows in high season"
Amazing!,"In spring and fall, it's a must do! Mount Fuji is ust amazing! But check the weather before going...a cloudy day may ruin all your expectations!"
Cherry Blossom ,This is a most beautiful area during cherry blossom season with Mt Fuji as a backdrop...quite breathtaking!
"Wonderful views, hiking trails and less tourists","Easy access from Tokyo, this is the less promoted area for international tourism than Hakone, and some of the services for foreigners are a little lacking though this does add to the charm of the area.  Take the tourist bus and get up to the mountains for hiking, the trails are well marked.  We walked 20 minutes and encountered only 3 other small groups and it was holiday and cherry blossom season!  But the lakeside was bustling with local and mainly SE Asian tourists."
Beautiful views,"Very serene with a great view of Fuji-San...the area has many traditional hotels, and sites. Get a hotel with a view of Fuji-san from a private Onsen and relax"
Beautiful views of Fuji and Sakura in bloom,We were lucky enough to visit on a beautiful sunny day while Sakura were in bloom. Must try the blueberry ice cream it’s delicious
Fuji lakes,"Magic place, worth visiting around lakes and mount Fiji. We are a family of four visiting from Italy"
Cycling around Lake Kawaguchiko,A lovely way to spend a couple of hours.Easy cycling on flat terrain with lots to see and Mt Fuji to view. The mountain was a little hazy on the day we went but still spectacular. However don't stop for coffee at the cafe restaurant (large white house) playing jazz music on the lake's edge with a very enticing garden setting. Major ripoff 750 yen for coffee. We wondered why we were the only customers and now we know!
Loooooove it! ,"The scenery is peaceful and pretty. You can see Fuji mountain from afar. You can visit small shops and buy some good biscuits as souvenirs, or have a cup of coffee while enjoy some great cheese cakes. You can also enjoy the walk around the lake. They have a 2-day bus if you want to reach the destinations faster (red line, green line and blue line)- you get to pick the route you want based on its color. Really recommend to visit!"
Lovely lake with great Mount Fuji views,"Only visited this lake of the Fuji Five Lakes, very enjoyable and peaceful. Other than taking in the Mt Fuji view, not much else to do other than wander about or hire a bike, which is still all good, or take a pedalo out on the lake.A walk around the lake is 20km, hiring bikes from Kawaguchiko town for the day is around £10-£12 each, making a circuit of the lake very doable this way instead (the path comes and goes so you will interact with cars). Also by hiring bikes you can get to the Chureito Pagoda, which is about 5km away from Kawaguchiko train station - a mix of on-road and wiggles through quiet little villages all while in view of Mt Fuji. Would definitely recommend for competent bike riders and map readers to do!"
Gorgeous view of Mount Fuji,Highly recommended for family with children. Can enjoy a boat ride or a Swan boat on the lake with a wonderful view of the Mount Fuji.
Beautiful lake with scenic ferry rides,"This lake has some beautiful views, lake side walks and ferries that take you on the lake to Hakone. It's worth a visit if you would like a relaxing day around a scenic lake."
Beautiful lake and walk,"The lake next to Fuji is beautiful and is surrounded by gorgeous forests. We decided to walk all around the lakes perimeter (which I read to be ~20kms somewhere)  in about 5-6 hours at a very causal stroll. Other than the length of the walk it is a low impact one being very flat and the ground continuously sturdy. Endless beautiful vantage points scattered along the track and gave us the opportunity of avoid the big crowds that seemed to appear throughout from the bus tours. We went at the end of March and honestly felt like it was a nicely secluded walk, with bike riders passing occasionally and road traffic not to busy. In some sections we did have to walk along a narrow section at the side of the road but had no dramas with cars. Beautiful way to spend a perfect spring day around Mt Fuji, was the highlight of my whole trip. Obviously nice weather played a big part in the enjoyment of the day so definitely check before you commit to the walk and allow yourself time to do before dark as in some parts the direction you need to go isn’t always obvious!"
Stunning view and enjoy walking or cycling,It is the good place to walk around the lake or cycling with friend and breath the clean air.Not much car and traffic hear. Good to take a rest and enjoy your life.
excellent place for pictures of mt fuji !,beautiful place. Check the weather before going. The predictions are very accurate. The lake was partially frozen in Jan
