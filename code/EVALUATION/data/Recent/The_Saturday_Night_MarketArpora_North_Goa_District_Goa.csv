Shadow of it's former self,"It's still worth visiting but as CEO says it really has downsized by about two thirds- what a shame.It used to be a fun night out- tourists would come from South Goa to attend.We did hear some extraordinary music from Iraq. The drinks are over-priced.Like a lot of things in Goa- there has been a lot of envy of successful businesses so people who can, take advantage & double the rent or they influence the granting of a licence .Goa is a state run by Mafia- see what they did to Club Cubana & Thallassa- shameful.Instead of competing they control. Nasty people."
Dissapointing,In years gone by this eas a well worth visit...not anymore..drinks are double the cost of any cafe bar food stalls average ..music bands only one. years ago it was 3 times bigger drinks were on par for cost and it was buzzing
Great Saturday night out,"We had a good night out here looking at the stalls, listening to the music and visiting the food stalls."
Great flea market on a Saturday Night,"Very good and organised flea market in Arpora. Parking easy available , vibe of the market is great with lots of local eateries and dealers and live music as well, must attend."
What a Place!!!!,An awesome place..firstly ample parking.. anytime you go..lots of colourful variety shops..a truly goan place with lively music.. people enjoying..and shopping offcourse..A must visit
Well worth the time to visit on Saturday night but bargain hard!!!!,"We visited Clive‚Äôs Saturday night market whilst staying at our nearby hotel (The Park Regis, Arpora) and it proved to be a good shopping experience. Locals told us that it only gets going after dark (7pm onwards) and if walking you may well need a torch, we certainly did.It‚Äôs very busy and covers around a quarter of a mile square with every sort of stall selling most things anyone might want. There is a large street food section with food from all over the world as well as many local dishes, whilst we didn‚Äôt eat we saw lots of others tucking into take away style dishes.There is a small stage area with music from quite a few different bands throughout the evening and a massive separate scooter/car park area. Top tip is to be very aware of scooters around this area as lots of the riders are tourists who have no ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù road sense, you can easily get run over if you‚Äôre not paying attention.All the stall holders are happy to haggle and if you are persistent there are some real bargains, I would make sure you have lots of different denomination notes so you can pay the exact price you have negotiated.There is another market up in Anjuna on a Wednesday daytime but this one seemed better maybe because of all the magical lights and general bustle, so happy shopping folks!"
Superb!,This a far cry from the crowded Friday night market (which is also fun in its madness).The music is great. Really good bands. The stores are all boutique types. I bought some beautiful outfits. But these are not cheap like Friday night market. But yet really great. Almost every single store was owned by a European designer. No Indians.
best night market in India,totally unexpected experience. very crowded but a lot of crafts. very good deals. very good food .nice jewellery.
Vibrant Saturday Night Market,"It‚Äôs amazing to see multi culture all on 1 platform. Good market to buy from. Good food, good music. There‚Äôs no question of getting bored because there‚Äôs so much to see.Have been going to this market year after year when me and my husband visit Goa. It‚Äôs happening and consistent. I thank each one for making it so alive and vibrant ü§©"
A good market to go to ,Worth trying this market out. I got some great bargains but dont go in flip flops. The ground is uneven and there is lots of red soil/sand/dust about
Worth spending time on a Saturday night !!,"The Saturday Night Market at Arpora is a must visit. There are many shopping options ranging from clothing, accessories, antique or boutique jewelry, handicrafts, etc. The eating options are also good with flavors from all across India  not limited to Goan food. It is close to the gokarting arean  hence we clubbed these 2 places back to back."
Bazar,Its nice bazar to purchase something but its just opened on Saturday and also at night party is there and good things are there
Was better 7 years ago,"We were in Palolem and drove the 3 hours to come to this market because 7 years ago we were here and remembered how amazing it was. To start there are now 2 night markets and our driver brought us to the other one first, we walked around quickly and realized this was not the one we had been to before. Once we arrived at This one we realized we were at the same place except it was considerably smaller. We talked to a few vendors who explained that most of the foreign vendors have left and now do a bimonthly night market on Fridays. We were disappointed because we had remembered all the unique items we could buy. There are still some of these vendors there and we did buy some unique items, just not as much as we wanted. The food area was great and there was a live band that was decent. Plenty of Indian vendors so a good place to pick up last minute souvenirs, out of the 2 markets this one is more manageable and less crowded."
"A spectacle worth visiting, even if you don't intend to make any purchases","This is a very large market selling a lot of the tourist tat you see near or on the beaches, but also a very more unusual items. Expect to spend around 1.5-2 hours here if you want to walk down every lane, more if you want to stop and listen to the (excellent) live music. I visited on my own as a solo female traveller and felt safe. If you can arrange a return taxi do, but there are plenty available outside. My taxi cost 1400 rupees return to the Lemon Tree, my driver waited outside for me. Be careful on the prices. For most items expect to haggle on everything to between 20-50% of the price initially stated. The 'walk away' tactic works well, although I was pursued for a good 5 minutes down one lane by a disappointed trader who kept slashing his prices in the hope of getting a sale.Entry is free. Worth a visit for the spectacle and experience, if nothing else."
"Food, Music and Shopping","Loved hanging out there with friends , great place for nice live music and variety of food options. . One can pic cool handicraft items as well.."
Fantastic Saturday night out,"Visit here each time we go to Goa, great stalls selling everything; clothing, jewellery, blankets etc.  Also street food stalls, biryani and doughnuts are a must and usually a great band to dance to night away!"
Nice,"Lively place with live music. Lots of stuff to buy, but mostly knick knacks, and clothes. Nice food stalls with variety of foods."
crazy but an experience you wouldn't want to miss,"The first time we when to night market couldn't believe you had to cross a road of bikes to get into the market even thou it was on a car park. The car park was full of red dust. There was someone with a whistle ordering people where to park it was weird but crazy to see this and experience but also glad I went to this to experience it.There is begger here as well,but you can get a bargain here but it might be due to lack of people they was all wanted a sale so you could get a bargain here."
Great ambience and amazing vibe,"This market is a must visit. It offers amazing music, food and shopping options. Had a great time with family. If you want to experience the amazing vibe of this place, must include a Saturday in your calendar while visiting Goa."
Night party,"Beautiful gathering ,party and music is good,young and energetic crowd,No parking around, thus better to hire a taxi"
Not good,"Too big, too busy, nothing special to buy, terrible entertainment and no atmosphere. Much preferred the Hilltop Friday night Market in Vagator. Way more friendly, fun, smaller, completely different vibe and proper live music followed by a Goa trance night"
Bazar of Far East ,"Very interesting, you might have to stop moving when the decide to play the national anthem ?!? Not clean and very crowded. Good place to buy souvenirs for very cheap."
"Great visit, great food and great music.  Worth a trip.  Gets busier after 9.00 pm and goes on late. ","Good for food, live music and everything you may want to buy from a market stall.  Gets busier later evening and goes on until the early hours I think.  Opposite the doubletree Hilton. Plenty of parking."
Must Visit,The market is a very good place to shop almost everything from small souvenir s to clothes to big sho items. It also has food stalls and joy rides. Another important thing is about plenty of parking place. Overall a very well managed event. Please visit if your itinerary has a Saturday.
"Fun, Food, Shopping, and Music","Walk around, talk around, shop around, eat around, and chat around!!! Just enjoy the atmosphere and spend little money."
Worth experiencing,We went to the market by chance and therefore had no expectations and I have to say we enjoyed it. We spent just over an hour there and bought some great souvenirs from our trip in Goa.Be prepared to bargain for everything and I would say the items we did buy we got at a fifth of the initally quoted price.As a previous reviewer mentioned it does become repetitive with the stalls selling the same sort of stuff however this is part of the experience of getting a whole host of prices for the same thing and getting it at the best rate. Some small rides for kids which we paid 100 rupees per ride per child.Items you can expect there are:ClothesJewelleryStatuesSilk coversFood spices and herbsToysSouvenirsShoesBagsEtc
Poor quality ,Poor quality market most stalls selling the same old tac you need to barter here and firmly as you will probably find the same item a stall or two down and half the price it‚Äôs just to much of the same thing if you want clothing a bed spread cushion covers costume jewelry or spices then this is the market for you however there is a much better craft market just a little further up the road so my advice is to head there
Hot and humid,Visited and was not disappointed. Lots of local goods for sale. All the traditional fare.There was also a food section selling hot international foods.Worth a visit.
Very boring market!,There is nothing different here that you can't find anywhere else in goa. I don't know why some people took 2 hours to roam in this market. We finished it in about 40 mins. The food didn't look hygienic enough to try. If you decide to skip this place.. You won't miss anything
Bakwass,"Not worth at all, very cheap quality stuff nothing good, they are only interested in fooling don't go for indians"
Nice place to visit,"Food, music and shopping all at one place, a must visit place if you are there on Saturday, go eat enjoy live band or I say varieties of performances like Sufi, rock, etc."
Crowded and huge,"The market is big and lot of shops to buy clothes, gift items, accessories, etc.. There are many shops selling same items and hence one may feel bored... The shops quote exorbitant prices and negotiate too much if one can... Not a lot of food and entertainment options though."
party,this is so beautiful place this is market I love this market so much and I won't come back I love this place so much
A must for any visitor!,"My favourite place by night, the Saturday Night Market - NOT the Saturday Night Bazaar (not so good) is a colourful market full of pretty much anything you can imagine - clothes, bags, shoes, artifacts, handmade creations, food, ornaments, art and a stage for up and coming artists to display their jazz, reggae, pop songs to the masses"
Bustling buzzing activity,"Gone are the days when the night market was a laid back affair where one could go to while around and have a good time. The night market now is crowded to capacity, where jostling crowds of tourists and fun seekers vie for space along with stall owners and food joints. Parking is a nightmare. I have been there once and Im not going back. The cheap trinkets are available at the Tibetan stores which are like any Delhi street market, the actual good stalls are over priced. The food is non descript and slightly suspect. For a first timer it may be one to cross off the list. I dont think anyone would want to go back."
fun shopping,Came here once during our stay.It is a very well organised market and was busy.  Thoroughly enjoyed the market. Great choice of food stalls. Fire eaters and good music while we sat and enjoyed a drink or two.
Superb market. ,"I went here with few friends and we shopped a bunch of items, the market has almost everything ranging from fashionable clothes to accessories that are beautiful. It also has live music session going on in centre of market. really great vibes of place."
Similar stuff to what you find on the streets,Not a great place to visit IMO similar stuff can be found all along the beach streets stall holders polite but persistent Great if you like that sort of stuff but nothing out of the ordinary
Superb!,"One of the must visit place, Never miss it, lovely atmosphere, different experience for Tourist.We will be back again."
Must visit,If u r in Goa on Saturday it's a must visit place ..good food good music .. different culture..and the best part is shopping but bargain as much as possible
An amazing place to spend saturday night,We spend out saturday night here and did not regret a bit. They have booze and good live music. The shopping here is great and vintage. The spices sold are amazing. I picked some amazing flavoured green tea from here.
to hot,It's so warm and stuffy at the night time when it's being really been hot because it's crowded out with people and it's all much the same stuff stall after school but you can get a good bargain
Good music and food,The the later you go the better the bargin. Good range of items but mostly repeats. Some good food and a band performing in the middle.
Apora Night Market - Goa,"On my recent visit to Goa last weekend, got an opportunity ti visit the famous Apora Night Market.Its operational from November till April end, everyday from 8pm till 4am (Wednesday's closed).The attraction of this place is its amazing variety, from the spices to vintage items, unique craftsmanship, jewellery, flavoured tea and much more..One surely needs to bargain tough to get great deals!"
Best market ,In Goa Saturday market is so nice. There was variety of different goan clothes and also western clothes and also cosmetic products so I liked this market. With shopping there are also food stalls where so many different types you can taste which are so nice.
Good for an experience,"The market comes to life only on Saturdays and stays open from 7 pm till about 2 am. We took a taxi from Candolim to Arpora night market. Costed us 1400 for a late night return trip with an hour long waiting.   The flea market is huge with certainly around 200+ shops selling stuff. There are plenty of food stalls in case you decide to have dinner there. Wood fired pizzas are a favourite here. I personally was a bit dissapointed with the shops as they lacked variety. The shops are selling either Tshirts and dresses (typical Goa style), artificial metal jewellery, rajasthani stone works. These 3-4 types are repeated across these 200 shops and its gets repetitive very soon as you start walking around. For example its the same T shirt at every second shop. We didn't spend much time there and decided to return back. But those deciding to stay back and shop must bargain to best possible limits."
Cool vibe.,"Nice place to visit when in town,  the stalls all sell the same stuff but it's cool, and you can bargain them down to better prices for some clothes and other stuff, food stalls and alcohol available inside, nice enjoyable evening would return here again."
another market!,same old stuff however females be careful you may see gentlemen using  toilet behind a see through  mesh just next to where they have an entertainment stage. Amazing placement.
Last market of the season,"Had read mixed reviews about this market. Have to say it was fine, just what you would expect from a tourist market, everything you don‚Äôt need but think you wantPrices were good today with bargains to be had if you haggled. Don‚Äôt take their first price and if there is a price you want to pay tell them it‚Äôs your final offer, if they can‚Äôt accept they won‚Äôt."
LOVE!!!,"the vibe, the shopping, the diversity, the exquisite food all add to a wonderful evening out at this fantastic market. Opens nov-march, sadly no website, insta or twitter though..."
Dont be fooled,"We picked up these 2 solid wooden figures at the arpora night market. When we arrived home they had shattered in the mail.  They were not wood at all, but a cheap plastic wax mold. There were rocks implanted into the base to add weight and make them more realistic.   Dont waste‚Ä¶"
Fantastic a must ,Great market we went at around 7pm and found it a good time to go as not as busy and could get some food and a table to eat it on! The music & atmosphere is great and the shopping experience just make sure you barter down on price and you get some great gifts at brilliant prices.
Very Interesting To See. Markets In Goa ,"Lots and lots of fruits and vegetables and also really nicely presented as well.  Fish and meat department.  Also up above, and down below are stalls they sell everything, socks, runners, T-shirt‚Äôs, tops, cloths, jewelry you name it. And they don‚Äôt hassle you one bit or try call‚Ä¶"
Great atmosphere ,"Amazing place to spend a Saturday evening, great choice and bargains. Live music, drinks food and shopping what more could you want"
Sharpen Your Bargaining Skills.,"This is an open-air market held every Saturday night at Arpora. There is a live band playing but you have to wait till after nightfall for it to get swinging. There are a lot of stalls where you can buy knick-knacks, art items, electronic stuff, curios, artifacts, cigarettes,‚Ä¶"
Arpora market,Typical market tourist stuff on sale food iffy.lots of clothing and bags watches etc.Need to barter to get good price
Night outing ,Rummage for handcrafted clothes & curios or snack at global food stalls at Arpora's Saturday market.
Night bazar with lots of attraction,This place is full with lots of unique and niche shops wich is run by by foreigners and Indians. Its feel like you are not India and in somewhere in foreign market. Also lots of acts happened like fire dance and music show
Waste of Time and Money,dubbed as a Saturday flea market its nothing but a regular outdoor shopping center with food and drink.The stalls are run professionally and the prices outrageous and quality bad.A must avoid at any cost
Very well organised,It is a very nice market- lots of shopping & entertainment. The food is a bit questionable even though lots of places have outlets but the quality is poor.Perhaps the best & freshest is the Pizza.The was a nice Canadian Jazz singer & band. Sometimes a fire eater.Toilets are still stinky!There is a lot of fake stuff being sold bbut some nice things too.
"Quite a surprise, a must experience in Goa","Went there unplanned. Stayed for hours. There were so many stalls in this lively market. I bargained for all the gifts items to take home, thought I got a pretty good deal (probably not).  The live music acts were a treat. Great live performances. Also circled the food stalls..  they have everything from authentic Tibetan momos to hotdogs, to Indian Street food."
Nice,"Big market with food corner, some handmade shops and lot of clothes. Good life music and definitely worth a visit"
One visit not enough!,We travelled approx 1.5 hours to visit the market and was not disappointed   It was HUGE! the live music and variety of food was a real bonus.Being disabled I was worried if my mobility scooter would cope with the rough terrain but it was fine.  there were places i couldn't get to because of steps but all in all it was a really good evening out.  Plenty to see and buy.
MUST SEE while in Goa,"I loved this market! There were dancers, live music, and plenty of entertainment. Great shops and a cultural mashup. Definitely something to see! I can't wait to go back!"
"Had a nice barbequed fish , tried not to feed the dog","Nice vibe, usual things to buy , Russian lady guitarist , or Indian Bollywood for choice of music on our visit.Nice experience to while away an hour or two"
Feel lively,"You have come Goa and you decide to ignore this market, this will be a huge mistake. This market opens only on Saturday. This is not only market, but live music and band goes on every saryrday. Without spending any penny, you can enjoy Goa's nightlife in full."
Great Market,"Great market well worth a visit, very busy go early if you want to make a purchase.Again bargain for a good pricce."
Same stuff,"This market has the same stuff that all the flea markets beside the beaches have.I hoped the prices would be less, but surprisingly the prices were higher than the normal markets and though they were ready to negotiate."
Good tourist stop. Enjoyable visit,"Good market to visit with lots of touristy things to buy. Plenty of side stalls selling European and Asia foods. I love momos. Beer and other drinks at the rear, essential stop. The market is very colourful. The toilets are to be avoided at all costs. I know I had the use them, an experience I hope I will not enjoy again. You must barter or you will be taken to the cleaners. Taxi drivers will usually wait for 2 hours on their quoted fee."
Great variety,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Saturday Night Market in Arpora. There was a varied selection of goods on sale, some of which was pretty cheap and tacky but there were some lovely items too. The stall holders were all really friendly and there was lots of banter during price negotiations. The spice stalls were amazing with their wonderful smells and beautiful colours. There was a great selection of jewellery at reasonable prices and beautiful fabrics. I wished I had left more room in my luggage. My favourite buy was an ink drawing of a family of elephants on banana leaves - magnificent! The atmosphere was lively with lots of people and, of course, a few cows roaming around checking out the wares and the food stalls. All round, it was an interesting and enjoyable experience."
Same old,We went with highish expectations but overall the market generally sells the same tat as the local shops. We did however have a lovely pork & stuffing batch. After ‚Äòshopping‚Äô eating & having a beer we were ready to leave after 45 minutes.  There is a poor excuse for a fair with deafening rave music blaring out. This is a place ticked off the list but definitely won‚Äôt be revisiting.
Some gems but you need to seek them out,We were staying at the Hilton across the road from the Saturday night market so it was a bit of a no brainer to visit this. We had already visited the Friday market at Mapusa and probably should have just left it at that. The Mapusa market is a locals market and is far superior that the tat generally on offer at this one. That said the food is great and there are some absolute gems which make a visit worth while.
A great vibe,Loved this place.Yes as other reviewers have written you maybe able to buy from shops at similar prices but this market is more than that . It‚Äôs a party vibe with live bands and a bar and lots of food stalls. This place is a vibrant fun place to have a drink and people watch. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it once just for the atmosphere.
Nice place to chill out!,"Good cheap shopping, great music and of course, beers to go along. Just to be around so many different characters itself is fun!!"
DIFERENT EXPERIENCE,U can spend 3 to 4 hours easily on a saturday evening if u r with ur family.a very different concept alltogether of having a sat nite market.
OKAY,"Plenty of stalls selling a variety of Indian products, nice vibe in the market, just be very aware what you eat at this night market I had chicken Shawarma from the kebab stall  and got very ill through food poisoning and had to be treated by doctor."
What a happy place to be in,"Awesome happy experience..Great food stalls,super shopping,awesome music -among a huge well behaved global crowd--everyone seemed happy and enjoying"
Got a bargain,It is always amazing to see the amount of stuff each stallholder has and to wonder how long it takes to set up and take down everything. I managed to get a bargain very early on with the help of my sister-in- law who is more familiar with the process of haggling than I am so it was a good start. There is so much to see and lots of 'alleyways' to explore that after a while it becomes numbing as everyone wants your trade/rupees!  There was live music provided and seating arranged to take it all in. The spectacle of the market is brilliant and it gets busier as the night goes on. The array of lights make it quite special but after about an hour and a half we were ready to leave and do battle with the amazingly busy and noisy street outside. Worth seeing for the spectacle itself.
"Bit of a let down, terrible tourist trap and the organisers beat the animals with sticks! ","We were looking forward to the night Market to be honest as we thought it would be a great opportunity to buy proper local goods and produce. It turned out the opposite as all we found was the same tat that had been on sale all over our tour of India. The same souvenirs, same ornaments, same clothes and same fake jewellery. Tourist trap written all over it. Scams all over the place and luckily we were wise to them already. The place is massive however it's just the same 6 stalls replicated around the place. There's not much choice to be honest. Food was quite good and the people watching is brilliant as was the cheesy euro techno music. The night turned sour however when we witnessed the organisers going around the market literally beating the dogs and cows with sticks until they left the area cowering in corners. It was horrible to see and we confronted one guy who all of a sudden couldn't speak English. We then saw him running around a disused area chasing and beating cows. India has a serious problem with stray animals and animal cruelty and not to mention the horrendous litter situation. They have no care for theirs or anyone elses environment. It's a shame as it left a sour taste on an otherwise great holiday."
great atmosphere,"Visited the same stalls outside of the market at their base stores, and the prices were much more cheaper than what they sell their stuff for at the tourist market.  However, still worth the stop and atmosphere and always good to support the markets, no matter their price!"
Great Goan experience,"There are different night markets in Arpora, this review is for the smaller one. Great ambience to experience the Goan atmosphere, good food, drink and entertainment. The Italian pizza and coffee and cake stall was very good and genuine. Drinks fairly priced, makes for a great fun night out. Note to the organisers......please change the group who comes after ‚ÄòGilbert‚Äô as they were terrible and in Goa you are spoilt for choice for live bandsüòÄ"
Shopping,Very busy with entertainment and food stalls not to pushy. Full variety of stalls and bater fo lower prices
Same Type of Stuff that you get everywhere in GOA,Over hyped Saturday Night Market as it has same stuff and things that you get everywhere in GOA that too very expensive than usual rates which we get in our nearby surroundings. Open Food Court with liquor too and live band was performing.
"A big, bustling market, but only clothese, trinkets, souvenirs, no produce","Quite a fun market, food stalls to eat at, live music, but basically dozens of stalls with the same products - tourist clothing, hats, trinkets, spices, souvenirs etc.  No produce for sale, no great interest or novel things for sale.  Marred also by the many beggars surrounding it as you enter or exit."
An Interesting night shopping experience,"Every time I go to Goa people used to talk about this Saturday night market, so i had decided to go there during this visit and hence I chose to stay at Calangute( Arpora) so that I can walk back in the night to my Hotel. This is a very big market area created in a big ground with excellent lightings and enclosures for various stalls which sell A to Z. There are several make shift  food stalls and chat stalls all around. There is also a separate stage for music lovers. At the corner there is also a open place for you dance for disco music, after taking the liquor being sold by Titos shop.I could see many foreigners in groups and families visiting this place. Locals also come here in addition to the tourists. one important caution is that you have to bargain to buy anything and also to take care of your wallet all the time. There are many shops being repeated with the same items such as bags, antiques, ladies jewelleries,masks, hats,a collection of spices, colourful hammocks of sizes, shoes and ladies footwares, etc., etc..The shops are opened until upto 1-00 am and transport is available  till then."
Good experience ,"Very interesting place to visit, plenty  going on, music, stalls and more, but be very careful with your belongings."
Saturday Night exclusive Market,"If you happen to do shopping in Goa and you are staying on a weekend , then this is a good place for shopping ..Dresses , ladies accessories , antiques , home decorative items etc ...Also plenty of unique food counters ..One can finish your dinner here itself."
"Lively Market,Live Music,Best place of girls","This is a weekly market which opens only on Saturday night and is 2 kms away from Baga beach, This market has lot of shopping options like handicrafts, western dresses, toys, accessories etc,Girls will simply love it, It opens till 3-4 am in the night and has live music along with food stalls."
Very busy... watch your wallet,We visited this market and were taken by our taxi driver.  He parked up to wait for us and warned us to be aware of theft.  We left after an hour as it was mad busy and not much fun
Nice night shopping,"Its very nice and unique to see night market. It has its own style. One can enjoy shopping clothes, pottery, articles in typical goa style"
Biggest one,I heard there are three  in Goa the big one and this one in arpora is the biggest one .This is only on Saturday so guys just remember .They have too much bargain happening so u can get a good deal.Bad part is every body sells their articles like everybody is foreign tourist which is not the case and they cheat on prices .From food to shopping to serving alcohol to have dance karaoke  u can find this at one place . We visited during peak night time which is what it is supposed to be best .They do have huge and ample parking as well
Changing night markets in Goa,This night market has a vibrant atmosphere...lively music.  Food stalls could offer more variety and  although many vendors...mainly trinket  items!
Drench in the Goan feel,"The Saturday Night Market is an experience that is enigmatic and engaging. If you are an hoarder for exotic things, this place is a must visit. Good food, amazing live music and the truly Goan vibes make the trip here an impressive visit."
Nothing great anymore,"A few years ago I would have said that this is one place that is as Goa as it gets - great live music, mix of cultures, great stalls selling unique trinkets, handicrafts, and great food. It was a truly Goan experience. Now - bollywood music, okish food (who wants to eat an ok Domino's in Goa), stalls are tourist traps with things you can get at any other place. Give this place a pass. It's a hassle to get in and park and just to see ok things.If you are around, head to Anjuna for some great digs instead."
Gr8 place to embibe Goan vibe,"Be it shopping, live music, local marketing...all in one at Arapora night market. Reminded me of the ingot night market. Must go if in Goa on Saturday night."
An experience you need to have,We visited the market around 8pm on Saturday and were impressed at the security checkpoint before you entered- bags were being searched. The sellers can be particularly aggresive at times but just walk away and they'll halve or take a third off the price they were asking for! There's a lot to look at and also eat. Toilets are for the braver individual as they are open air with no privacy!
Interesting place with live music and DJ,"Its interesting to see all the flea market stuff in one place with live music, food and DJThe crowd dancing in DJ...umm...mixedLive music...amazingFood and drinks...amazingShopping experience...amazing"
Intresting way to spend Saturday night,So many things on display...a wonderful colourful market... Somewhat like the khadi mela we have from different states...keep your bargaining skills handy.
"Night full of business, food, music and light!","There is not so many places in Goa where you can go in the evening having different kind of fun, food and music til late night. Night Market is one of the ""must to visi"" places in Goa. It is only by Saturdays. You can find many things in the market what you can find also in the other markets but in the same time the evning atmosphere is diferent. Even many local people visit nightmarket for dinner and music"
Awful,"A typical tourist trap and a complete waste of time.  Incredibly, it was crowded with hardly any place to move around.  All the stalls sold the usual rubbish, the food stalls were crap; I cannot understand what the hype about this place was all about."
Nice place...shouldn‚Äôt be missed,"On dec 1st 2018 we visited the market with our girl gang and we really enjoyed at lot. It‚Äôs a huge market with lots of small small shops. They have huge and lively collections of beach wear, long dresses with back less, funky t shirts, Musk collections, stone pendants, junk jewelleries, bed linens and many more. If you are shopping freak then you should not miss this market which is near to Baga Beach. It happens on every Saturday. It opens from 7pm and lasts till 2pm. Very safe to visit with friends, teenagers,kids. But one should be very careful as there is a high chance of getting lost.This market is full of very good collections but one must bargain before every purchase. All shopkeepers can speak Hindi, English, Russian and French. I was very much impressed. There is a big food joint where all kind of foods are very much available. Pure Veg and Non Veg foods are there. One may find foreigners are cooking and serving foods to the customers at Italian, Mexican and custard‚Äôs counter. It‚Äôs really worth to try. Some places you will find ber-be-que  items with sea foods. There are good musicians who were playing good musics to match that ambiance. P.s. one must have a pre hired car before planning for this visit."
Something for Everyone ,"Most popular flea market.Everything you need get here.No fix price ,it's defending on your bargaining power except foods.Very busy market .Easily spent 2 to 3 hours at night."
Buzzing night market.,"Excellent atmosphere and well worth a visit. Live music, a bar, ""Street food"" and lots of stalls. Also a ""Wall of Death"" motorbike show. Show was pretty short, but for 100 rupees is a must see! (I'm assuming they are there every week.)Many of the stalls are selling the same things, and don't forget to bargain, but we wouldn't have missed it for the world."
Night market ,Arrived at around 830 pm.Very very busy car parking was the usual Indian free for all but our taxi driver was very good.An amazing wander around aisle upon aisle of colourful stalls. A bit of everything except fresh produce. Was fun all types of people selling and buying.Some live music /entertainment wish we had of spent more time sitting down but only planned to stay for two hours.Should of arrived earlier and stayed later.Did manage to haggle some in our eyes bargains. Food in the market a little underwhelming maybe eat before there are plenty of restaurants outside.Missed the motorbikes riding a not to safe looking wooden wall thing.That I'm sure would of been fun. Drinks available  and seating could easily make a whole night of it.Something for everyone well worth a visit.
Unique handicrafts and antiques but very high price,"Saturday night market is a place for shopping for handicrafts, artificial jewellery, live music band. But prices are way above normal. It attracts tourists from all countries."
Worthwhile a visit !,"lots of stalls with a variety of merchandise. a good number of food stalls offering different food. There is live music too. It is a great ambience and vibe. Quite a few vendors were still setting up their stalls at 6pm.. so don't come too early, but the later you reach the more traffic (traffic jam)."
Crazy marker ,Full hand crafted things is available. Awesome place to visit there if you are in Goa.. Near some food stall. It's really good.
Shot Throughout night,This market remains open throughout night but it is seasonal. It takes place in October to December. If you're there post Christmas chances are less to see this.
A must go place,The Saturday Night Market is one of the biggest ‚Äúpop up‚Äù show I have seen. And it is very well organized right from parking to ground layout and security. Stalls run by locals and foreigners offer a lot of variety and reasonable prices. There‚Äôs lots to eat and a live band pelts our popular numbers. If you are in Goa on a Saturday then this is a must go.
Total waste,Hello we have been there on 17 June but it was closed due to rains. So we have wasted a night and we drove for 1.30 hours to get there and we got nothing.
Must visit,"It‚Äôs a huge place where u can get lost! When something catches your eye, then BUY it! Because u will not find it again if you come back later searching. There is live music and dance which is very entertaining. There is a big food court and benches for sitting. EVERYTHING is negotiable...so best of luck !"
Shoping,Saturday night market sham 6 bje se full night chalta h  yha aap full enjoy le sakte h jse music dance shoping fast food etccc bole to mst h
Best Night Market,"Saturday night market has always been my very favourite market. As I hear from Goa this has been always my favourite Saturday night place. One can show eat drink dance listen to music and much more. This is the largest Market in India and people from all around the world sell their products. You will find every sort of product that you need from your kitchen to Hall dressing to food. You will find people selling from India and from places like Romania Russia UK US Australia Germany New Zealand and almost all over the world. So you'll not only find the local products but you find from the Overseas as well and these are just not factory made, these are homemade as well and well handcrafted. Once you visit this market you are definitely going to like it and make you feel come more often."
MidNight shopping till 3am,Busy place..Lots of stuffs as gifts/ souvenirs for friends/relativesTraditional stuff as well as modern art too which reflects Goan / Indian culture
Nice Variety,"If you want to shop at different places around the world, this is the right place for you. Never miss it if you are there on any Saturday at Goa."
Amazing!!!,"It was really amazing place for crazy people,, we stayed next to that in double tree !! So we spent our time in this place..even the food is I liked..crazy place for shopping!!"
A unique night life experience of Goa,It was a fair filled with shops of various products of the local taste and manufacture and also handi craft from various other places. Live music bands and also food stalls added to the flavour of the evening. A must experience for Goa travellers.
"Women folks rejoice, men toe along","A shoppers paradise for the ladies with 90% of the space dedicated to clothes, accessories and the like; there is a fair bit of Goa in the wares, but there is also a lot of what you can find in any flea market (Fashion Street for Mumbai). The balance 10% is for food, entertainment and a couple of deserted shops dedicated to men.Bargain hard, there is no fixed price of anything except the food (did not try to bargain that).Until we left at 11:30 PM, everything was still open, was told that shops start winding down post midnight."
a faire!,"le meilleur Marche de Goa! if u need to choose 1 go there!super ambiance, musique dance food... bones affaires a fairebetter than Anjuna or Mapusa"
flea market,"there is a night market at arpora which is a great place to buy clothes, shoes, sovenirs at a good bargain."
busy busy busy,loved it here experinced local marketing at its best .. enjoyed the live music and the atmosphere  deffo a must.
What can you not buy here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This market is on until 3 am and gets very very busy. We called in for a couple of hours from around 6 pm. On leaving the place was so so busy.We all had a good shopping experience.
Brilliant atmosphere,"This is one of the highlights of my Goa experience. We went by taxi from Calangute 500 rps . We arrived around 8 pm and it was in full swing. Loads of stalls from bags, spices, clothing, jewellery, pashminas, throws and lots more.   In the centre there is a stage with music playing and fire eaters. Plenty if seating. There is a big section selling wonderful food. . Be prepared to barter for lots of bargains . We were still there at midnight and there was still plenty of action."
Knick Knacks To Take Back Home For Friends,"Losts of traditional stuff.....and also moderns ""I luv Goa"" stuffs.... good food from authentic Italian pizza to Hyderabadi biryani .... hang around - bargain - shop the 'take back home gifts' to your heatrs content"
Must do when in Goa,"Try to go early as it gets very busy-7pmish.Organised, clean (except for the toilets), lively (live music, fire shows, catwalk etc) & good bars around.The food is also supplied by some of the well known restaurants but I am a little concerned about how they store it in the heat? Stick to vegetarian pizza!Many different stalls, most selling tat but some are good- avoid the spices (get the Organic stuff from the shops) & a lot of the woollens are not!All kind s of people- a very friendly safe atmosphere.Good car park."
popular,Its very popular with tourists hence the crowd. Lots of odds and end being sold here - from spices to clothes and trinkets to handicrafts - some of them by expats who are based in goa - there is also food and music - and it goes on till late in the night. If you have nothing else to do and like shopping you should definitely visit
Night market,"This market sells everything from clothes, shoes, bags, food, scarves, jewelry, Indian crafts, hammocks and Even real fur jackets. Only open on a Saturday night when Goa comes alive with locals and tourists. Our taxi driver collected us in Calangute and collected us again for 1200 rupees"
Nice experience ,"This market is popular for the fact that here you can see foreigners selling items. You can find mostly stalls of clothing, fancy items, jewellery and food. You can also see dancing or singing performances in the stage."
Great experience ,A real cultural experience with wide variety of things on offer.  The street food is really good so would advise eating there as well. There is live entertainment making it a great evening
An excellent night out ,"Lots of stalls selling various different bits from clothing to Buddha heads. There are also many food stalls to grab something to eat, my friend and I were a bit sceptical on eating the food as we‚Äôve heard mixed reviews, but was actually really tasty and it didn‚Äôt make us ill! You can see the food being cooked in front of you so you should be ok.Also a live band and various bars which created a great atmosphere. Most definitely worth the visit, even if you aren‚Äôt interested in buying anything!"
Saturday night market ,A must if u are in GOAIt‚Äôs a buzzing market with live shows And lots of food and barsLots of thing to buysAnd souvenirs for familyA great night out
"Lots of shops, music","Lot's of shops are here, along with Live music and lots of eateries. That's the best way to describe this market.Lots of locals and foreigners will try selling you different things but need to be watchful, and dont forget to bargain.Live music was there, and a food court setup was there as well. Overall a good place to visit."
Hippie market...,"I went there because a friend was playing music there, but I must say I didn't really like the place or found anything to buy. There were some musicians who seems to have been frozen in time as if it was still the 60's (why not after all, but then not my favourite...), mixed with spots full of hardcore electro music and in the middle many market stall, half ""owned"" by foreigners. I had never imagined foreigners selling stuffs on a market in India and I must admit it was a very strange view. But then again why not... Some jewelry shops did have some nice pieces but that's all, the rest looked quite cheap and unappealing... but if you like hippie ambiances and goods, then you will probably find stuffs."
Good,Good to see local market. Though full of crowd but you will like it if you love the crowd. It has its own uniqueness.
Shopaholic mania,"If anyone likes shopping this place is a total paradise with great collection from foods to fashion,handicrafts,painting and even household products.Its a weekend wow.Exclusive collections of clothes specially for ladies, rare collection of shoes like ninja shoes etc.So enjoy your shopping."
Holiday,Great place to go on a Saturday night so much to see great food on the stalls and it‚Äôs a must to try . Music in middle was great and everyone was friendly üëçüëçüëç
Crazy ,Visited the night market and kinda wished I hadn‚Äôt bothered.  I really enjoyed the food stalls and the music was great but the stall holders are non stop badgering you. I get it they have to sell to you before you move on to next stall but it‚Äôs so off putting. Highly exaggerated prices so you have to haggle and it gets tiring. If they would just put a price up and let you get on with it they would sell so much more. The atmosphere was good around the music area and I tasted some food I had never had before. So that was a bonus.
A complete goan experience minus the beaches.,"Saturday night market of Goa is world famous for its vibrant offerings.If you are staying in Goa over a weekend make sure you visit either of the 2 Saturday night markets ( yes there are 2, both are near to each other )Come here for fun,shopping , music and food..there are live band performances , variety of stalls selling all kinds of things, from spices to teas, clothes to magic trick games and what not... All of goa's street shopping put in one place.Best of the food stalls & best of the booze in a single food court. Shop around , pick a nice spot at the garden to eat ,  bring your food orders - listen to the music and njoi...Bring children as well, they'll have a good time as well.PS : if you don't know the art of Bargain, bring someone who does."
Vibrant market ,"We happended to drop by the flea market recently and it was a good venture. Lots happening with lots of nice looking people from various countries. Interesting stuff on sale with live music. Ample parking with no hassle. Note: There are 2 such markets located within 1km distance in Arpora, Goa. One is on a huge scale and the other one is on a humbler scale. The humbler one we liked it better!"
You have to see to experience it,"The market has so many stalls selling different kinds of stuffs. You will see foriegners sitting behind stalls nd selling things. You would get to see different cultures, people , one of a kind of items here."
Best evening in goa,"During any Saturday if u r in Goa...Nd u had not visited this place...Ur trip was not worthy...Free entryFree parking facilitiesMany shops selling every aspects ..clothes, food masalas, bags , wallets belts , (u must master bargaining) tattoos, jewelers Nd others.  Food stalls (veg + nonveg)BarsDJ night.. must to enjoy..Live band music(for band lover)For friends Nd couples..must to visit....even u can plan for Goa when Saturday is there in Ur staying days...enjoy..."
Colorful and variety,"Come Saturday evening, and it seems the whole of Goa has come to visit the flea market. I was impressed with the way the organizers manage the traffic and thousands of cars for parking. The market has so many stalls, more than 1000, I think. However, it‚Äôs only called a flea market, the prices of some of the apparels and stuff are higher than some of the international brands. But it‚Äôs not just the apparels u get there, the market has lot of other stuff to shops from, spices, teas, jewellery, bags, crockery, home decor, etc etc. It has lot of food stalls and bars as well of different cuisine and live band performances too! Makes for a very colourful evening/ night!"
good night,"great night out with good food at a good price,good music and a mini rave up at the top,even the toilets are fine"
Really enjoyed it,"The Saturday Night Market has everything you want to buy. The atmosphere is also amazing and you can enjoy if you want to shop and dont mind walking. Lot of bargaining but its fun place to be at for local shopping. Its start as early as 6 PM, and goes on till late in night. Think you can do better bargain if you go early and you also have less crowd."
Atmosphere,Went to the Saturday night market was good nice things there a lot is over priced a gentleman wanted 6500rs for a small wooden box with elephants on I got him down to 1500rs be prepared to haggle or walk away Music is good. A lot of none Indian sellers aswell
I loved it ...,Had a brilliant time here yesterday. It was packed but everything was good-natured. Shopping was really good and better than Anjuna.  The food area had something for every taste but with a Goan twist.  Music was loud enough to hear throughout the market and heavy rock. Get a taxi or tuk tuk to get there and have a ball.  Enjoy!
Must Visit,"The Saturday Night Market has everything. Excellent food, Great entertainment, Brilliant shopping. Our biggest dissapointment is its only on, on a Saturday. We left tipsy and with bags stuffed full of bargains."
A must see,"A must see. A great night out. Food, clothes, beer... and a fantastic atmosphere. We all loved it and went twice. If inwas still in Goa on a saturday night... I'd do it again!"
Big and brash ,A quick visit to the Saturday night market and we found you could buy just about any kind of tat that you require. There seems to be a lot of repeat stalls and we found the same items quite a bit cheaper with local stalls and shops. Overall worth a visit.
Worth a visit,"Well worth a visit to say you've been but don't expect to get a taxi as could take you a long time to get there as the traffic is horrendous. Loads of stalls, food stalls, bar at one end with the band's playing on a stage. If you like hustle and bustle and noise then go for it"
Amusing Crowd for People Watching,"The Saturday Night Market is a large market. Some stalls are staffed by locals with mass produced Indian crafts. Others are staffed by westerners -- mostly hippy-like stuff though we also saw some unusual things such as t-shirts with electronics on them. There was nothing we wanted to buy. There was Indian fast food. Also places to get drinks. So not the best place to eat. The live band was fun. The best part was people watching. I think everyone was a tourist. This is not a place where locals would come to shop. Some tourists are Indian; some western. Lots of the western ones were old hippies, others were there for the scene. If you really like to shop in a crowded place with lots of souvenirs and you are okay with fast food, then this is good for you. If you prefer a quieter scene, probably not for you. You can get better food and more authentic crafts elsewhere."
Not as Good as I Thought,"A lot of the products are same as we had seen at Anjuna but if you are looking for something and somewhere to go Saturday evening then you can spend a few hours here, looking at the stalls, have food and drink and listen to music."
SuperrrrrCoOOoL,What an amazing place to make your weekend even better .. everything at one place food music drinks everything you need that make your Saturday Complete ...Must Visit Place !!!! Don't miss !!!!!!
Nice market,It's √† lovely place with nice people And different stalls of indian craft but also international designers are here.Good food also From diff√©rent countries And good music.√Ä nice relaxing moment with friends.I've really enjoyed it.
"Great music, food and drinks","Awesome place. It has got something for everybody. Shops by both Indian and foreigners, food, drinks and awesome bands perform as well."
Flea Market at Apora,"A place where foreigners generally buy and sell clothes, trinkets, food of their country, and listen to live music. A place where parking is organised, and good security is in place. However, it is a disappointment with regards to quality and price of the items sold.  Can be avoided"
super cool,"very nice experience a lot to experience ,food,dance drinks,shoppe, very much crowded colorful.very goo to experience ."
Seafood lover,"Local food is something no one should miss out here,that says you are in actual saturated and at actual location üòÄü¶êüêöü¶Äüêü"
Great fun ! Good atmosphere ,"Something that you must do once!! Did we buy much? No , are a lot of the stands the same ? Yes. However my husband bought a great pair of vintage sunglasses that he loves and I bought some fun costume jewellery . We had a few beers some great street food and listened to all the music and people watched for 2 hours! Would def reccommend! Take the mosquito spray though!!"
Awesome,"A must visit place. Visited it during night and was almost there for 3 hours. From Indian items to jewellery to some vintage things, one can find everything here. If not for shopping you should at least visit it to have a look at it. There was a place playing dj and it was great. There are a lot of food stalls here so it was an amazing experience in all."
Mind blowing ,"Although suggested by friend, but it is never miss activity in Goa. One should definitely give try to this. Awesome and great."
Was ok ,Much you see in the market you have already seen in local shops. Worth a look around but we didn't buy anything. The music is good and atmosphere is good.
Worth a visit,At first it looked like only a flea market with somebody djying and playing some songs where everyone was dancing like crazy. We weren‚Äôt really keen at joining them. However as we kept walking we saw food stalls ran by Germans selling a lot delicious stuff. There was also stage close to the stalls where some guy (foreigners ) band was playing jazz. The fun part was they were playing jazz to Bollywood tunes. All in all a good to place hang out and do something different on a Saturday night!!
A very lively market place,"The Saturday night market by about 7 in the evening and closes by 2 AM. There are a lot of eateries inside, mostly junk food. Better to avoid them.Live bands would be playing all the time. They were good.The market mostly has clothes, plastic and stone jewelery, and show piece items. Can spend a couple of hours there. Ladies might be able to spend more time. ;)"
Good place for shopping and hangout,"Great range of items for shopping. If you have good bargaining skills, you get your items at very cheap price. There is also bar and live band performances plus food market. Must visit once if you are at Goa on saturday."
Nothing great,Typical indian road side market built in a small area. Shops offer cloths.. bags.. Hammocks.. Spices.. Then other side there are food stalls mostly operated by non indians.. Food was ok. But market is not that great.  One can visit for 5 minutes and grab quick bite and go.
Something for everyone ,"There is something here for everyone. Street food, live performances, a bar and lots and lots of shopping.Trinkets, antiques, handicrafts and wide variety of items are sold here at bargain prices"
Good night out,"We have been coming here for years and I always look forward to a night out at the Saturday night market. Food, drink live music and shopping. Love the hippie stuff"
Saturday markets have a great atmosphere ,In the week we spent in Baga we attended the markets twice. Some great music and food. Big selection of stalls. Wonderful experience and looking forward to returning.
Amazing experience,It's a one time but amazing experience. Club is located in isolated area but an amazing experience..
A must see,"The Saturday Night Market is a must visit, the fantastic atmosphere, the varying stalls selling unique wares, the food vendors and the whole vibe. I'm not a great shopper so was thrilled that I could just sip a beer and sit and watch and listen to the really good live singers and artists. It was also much cheaper to get a taxi home from one of the many drivers, remember to negotiate the price. Highly recommended as part of your Goa experience."
Aweful ,Dirty crowded poor quality and nothing you would want to buy typical Indian market nothing to go out of your way for
Brilliant!,"We went both Saturdays!Food is brilliant and and such a good time walking round! Make sure you visit. The food is safe and so worth having dinner there.Full of live music and shows. Try and get there early as it does get really busy later in the night,"
TOURISTIC AS HELL,"Unless you like iper-touristic markets, there is no reason to go there. Everything sold is very commercial and overpriced and the only people you will see around (also many stall owners!) are western ones, so we didn‚Äôt like it at all."
Local market with live music and food ,The Saturday night market is famous. It has the local products for shopping as well as the local delicacies.There was a live jazz music going on.
Wow - a totally different level of experience,This place offers lot of shopping options - albeit a bit costly. There is a LIVE music show which is the main attraction. You get to hear music from various world cultures - the night I went there it was a Turkish band playing their local songs.Food and beverage (including alcohol) options are available - though costly.Don't forget to bargain hard during shopping :)
Fun and worth a visit,"No entrance fee, need to haggle, at least get them to drop the price by 50 percent, lots of food stalls, henna, only down side is repeated stalls."
Great market and live music,"A great market with lots of stalls, food, drink and live music.  A great way to spend an evening get those souvenirs, sample some street food and enjoy the live band with a drink.  Be prepared to haggle if you want to buy anything.  Highly recommend a visit."
For Ladies,Though found some items for men too but as all markets are for ladies this one is no different. But worth a visit for girls.
Saturday night market,"If you are in the area you have to go and experience this market, hundreds of stalls selling arts crafts clothes and stuff, there was live bands playing on a stage and a huge food area with various stalls selling a range of food, the market is on a hill and works it‚Äôs way upwards, at the top you will find an open air night club banging out house music, this is a real hippy market and a party atmosphere, don‚Äôt bother getting there till 10pm as the market goes on until 4am as it‚Äôs more like a party with a spot of shopping, it‚Äôs very difficult getting out and meeting cabs it‚Äôs manic in fact but worth going for the experience"
Tourist must do,"Good place to visit for tourist items. Really good selection of food stalls, international cuisine. You need to bargin hard to get a good deal. We paid approximately ¬£10 for the taxi from Candolim and the driver waited 2 hours."
same stuff as anywhere in Goa,It was an experience but didnt stay longer than 1h. Same shopping as on the beach. Some see this as some kind of festival event with drinks and fast food. Worth a visit but I was a bit dissapointed
"Awesome place, shop, eat and dance ","Fun place, must visit if you are in north goa. Dont forget to negotiate. You can find lot of antiques and leather items."
good shopping place.,"i would recommend the wednesday anjuna market over the saturday market as it is is much larger and has a lot more variety. here again do not be afraid to bargain, you bargain as hard as 50% of the quoted price."
One best thing ! Just can't miss,"One of the best place we have visited. So vibrant, exclusive collection of stores, amazing food with drinks. What else one want being in Goa."
Full fun and night out ,Very vibrant and must visit place. Lots of fun. Excellent music. Lots of shopping but bargain hard. Food  drinks all are good. We had a full night out.
Place of Bazaars!!!,"A must visit place if you are on a trip to Goa. This market is filled with shops for cloths, local made handicrafts, accessories like leather jackets & belts, coolers, goa specialized hats and wearables. Other part of this place is food - almost all varieties of cuisine. Dance performances and also a bar in the market - amazing."
A perfect Saturday night,"A beautiful and colourful place with everything available under the big brand name ""Saturday night market"". Food and drinks and clothes and shoes and accessories and artifacts, it's a delight to the shoppers. The performances of the night were entertaining enough to hold on the attention of audiences. Also the crowd is so amazing and cheerful, it is such a fantastic experience."
Very large scale bazaar,Its a very large bazaar. With variety ranging from handicrafts to clothes to spices to leather etc. Had good choices of food as well
Unique mix of global cultures - Must visit,"A lively place and must visit place in Goa on Saturdays. People across the world come here and make this place one of the best cultural fusion experience in India. Eat, Drink and be happy.. enjoy live bands performing all kinds of music. awesome display of fire stunts..Test your haggling skills in the shops having merchandise from all over India and Russia in particular. U may be lucky like me to find exquisite souvenirs at a decent price.. good place to buy gifts for friends and relatives at home..Being a foodie, enjoyed global cuisine to my heart's content.. Then once you are feeling tired head to cafe cubana to refresh your soul till early morning.."
Mini Glastonbury,"This is a must for anyone travelling to Goa. The Saturday night market is the place to be whether you want to shop, drink, eat of just people watch. Traffic is very busy travelling to the night market so i'd suggest taking a Tuk Tuk or cab. On arrival you are greeted with many stalls with Goans awaiting you to barter with them for their produce. At then side of the venue there are many food outlets and all are very popular offering a wide range of food covering everything from traditional Goan/Indian to Italian to Nachos. In the middle of the venue is 1 bar which must make an absolute mint selling alcoholic products. Just to the side of this is the band stand area which has a range of live music and dancing. It's different every Saturday. It's great to just find a seat and take in the views and people watch. Further to the side again is what I can only describe as 'a Russian trance disco'. This took me back to my youth with trance/house music playing loudly with lots of lazer lights. There is a other bar here and it's mainly Indian visitors with other continents many of which looked like they'd travelled to Goa on a gap year and never returned home. I always felt safe here and returned every Saturday as the atmosphere was amazing. I picked up a few bargains too by haggling and i'm glad I did as I got my gifts at a fraction of the price. Don't be afraid to be cheeky. They love the banter!A must if you are visiting North Goa. Over Christmas and New Year there was a festival held in the neighbouring fields with many international DJ's. The venue was electric. Slightly devastated I didn't have tickets but realised i'm not 21 again!"
Must Visit,"Awesome colorful place to enjoy,loved it very much lots of food,handicraft, beers stalls,friendly staff,must visit to this lively place"
Carnival ,"Good place to haggle and have a walk at the end of a Saturday evening may be before you hit a nightclub. Handicrafts, fashion jewellery, clothes and street food is all about the place."
not to miss things in Goa,"This place is very lively and must visit place in Goa. People around the world come here and make this place one of the best experiencing place in India. You will find live bands performing all kinds of music. lively markets having merchandise from all over India. Outstanding food from around the world.Now a days many other similar markets have opened in Goa, but this place is the best. You can find ""Saturday nite Bazar"" also but that is different. This place is 1 kms from there ask any auto driver or shop owner. You can easily reach there by Bike or Car. Its open till 2 am in morning."
Colorful!,"It's a really nice culturally rich place where you can check out various kinds of handicrafts and accessories, taste various sorts of food and listen to live artists performing at the stage area. A must visit!!!"
Amazing night life,Goa's own featured night bazar which is original then other bazar night life hear is colorful and amazing a must visit place when in goa
Something Different ,"Was in Goa for couple of days and decided to visit the Saturday Night Market. Arrived early and enjoyed the more quite time at the stalls as it gets very busy from around 8pm. Good food and entertainment, and some unique items for sale. Be on the lookout as you can overpay for some items if you not firm with sellers. A must visit when in Goa"
worth a visit,Try the food. you will get hassled by the stall holders but just be firm. Full of local colour. get a tuktuk back to hotel.
Very busy but good experience ,Busy but good experience mainly for clothes.  Barter away and try your skills. Loads of stalls of clothing spices and jewellery in the main.
Fun night out,Great night out for all the family.Music shopping eating & drinking - lots to do. Traffic can be s problem so go early.
Night market with good music,As name suggest this market opens only on Saturday. Market has some local handicraft offerings  ( costly) with some live music and lip smacking food stall. on Calangute-Baga-Anjuna-Vegator road near club cabana ( before )
Full of energy!!,"During my short visit to Goa, we visited a few places close to Saligao and this was one of them. Could spend about 30 minutes there but was impressed with the way the market was organised in terms of parking and people movement.Lots of interesting stalls, will visit again and spend more time."
Happening! Full of Energy,"First few minutes I was lost with the scale of the market. Loved the vibe, the rich colors all around and people. There was live music, performances, DJ, great food stalls. Vendors here start pricing higher compared to rest of the markets I saw in Goa. Must visit. Tiring since you would not want to leave early with the number of stalls available. No entrance fee. Starts around 6 PM."
Lovely bustling market,The market is held every Saturday night. Lots of stalls selling goods. There was live music and stalls selling all kinds of street food. We had a great night.
Nice ,Worth visiting atleast once.. They have nice stalls for food... Also you will find some good collection of clothes.. Jewellery and antiques over here.. It's all lighted up.
market market,"A good place for buying local handicrafts, spices, jewellery, pashminas, bags, shoes etc and souvenirs....There is so much choice of food, live music and lots of bars at reasonable prices.Located just over the road from our hotel the Hilton. Rarely people come here to shop as been told to me by one of the Indian shopkeeper"
Worth a visit. ,The market is a reasonable size however most of the stores sell the same things. There is food drink and entertainment available. You could easily spend up to 2 hours there.
MUst visit if you like antique pieces,"If you love to spend money on shopping then this place is only for you , market is open on every saturday from 7pm to 4am , nice shopping area , little coslty , if you want to buy antique piece for your house must visit this place with enough money"
Good place for street shopping ,Visited the Saturday market in my last trip to goa. This place is quite an attraction and is packed with a lot of people. It is advisable to take a cab or walk down to this place. The roads around this area are generally jammed. The market offers a lot of street goodies to choose from. One needs to bargain as the products are over priced. There are multiple options to eat.
"Food, Music, Great Environment","Arpora market is a beautiful mix of food counters from all over the world - be it Mexican, Chinese, Indian, Korean and all sorts of Indian and other food. You can eat and drink under the sky while the live music vibrates. It starts at 6 PM and goes till midnight.There are other stalls like any other market for everything in the world - like clothes, decorative items,  tea, traditional craft, ornaments and spices. Exercise your bargaining skillsAlways recommended !"
tourist loving flea market,Every tourist person would love to visit this place ..... so many shops ... well organised... lots of attraction... live music performance... variety of food counters... love to bargain
AMAZING,"Is amazing market. I love it. Be carful though. There is. Now 3 Saturday night markets. When I tried to go last week, the taxi drive took me to a new one called the Saturday night bazaar, it was very busy, but was horrible, was so dusty and cheap stalls. He told me the original one was closed. Whilst there a someone told me the original one was open. So I tried to get a taxi there but none would take me. In the end I Got one. At last. It is opposite the Double tree by Hilton Hotel. Anyhow once I got there it was amazing, the food and music and atmosphere was great. Lots of good bars, same ones as last year though, but still just love this place. Makes me feel like I‚ÄômBack in Goa again for real when I come here. Food is really nice too."
A different market...at Night,Heard a lot about this market and it was all true..visited on the first saturday night market of the season and it was worth it..all the items are different and unique..live gig performing...you can eat n drink in .open air ....great crowd and place to buy different things...like it very much n recommend people to must visit if  its open as it open in season only..
Just good to see but not for shopping...,"I have heard about this Saturday Night Market in Goa. Luckily I was in Goa on Saturday, so visited this market. The lots of shops were there and the shopkeepers did not have any limit for prices of things. I found it was just to go and see. there is no any point in shopping as no scope for bargaining. :)"
Wow üòÆ ,What can I say about the Saturday night market other than wow what an experience. The first market I have been to that has a rave going on!! Loads of stalls and great food and drink. A must try when in Goa.
Nice place to bargain,Nice market works in the night. You have to bargain and get things 1/4thof price. Then you can say you are good purchaser
Fun enjoyed shopping,Great market to visit if you have less money and getting bored sitting alone.. also have good options to eat at the market itself.
Amazing place,"Amazing place to enjoy good food, good music, the crowd is great and so is the safety...when Women were dancing and having fun men were not allowed to dance and the kind of people they bring in for entertainment is great....must not miss this place...great food stalls as well...amazing food served...just needs a lil more benches for people to sit..."
"New Place, New fun","This time, they have shifted the night place to a new place, more closer to baga & Calangute, easy to access, good facilities all around. Music,lights, foods and shopping always makes this place more and more excitement."
Shopping eating drinking,"Can spend a very good fun evening here with friends, they have food stalls, a bar, music and shopping all around. Difficult to bargain hard though unlike Anjuna Market."
Amazing place,"Amazing place for foodies and music lover. This is the ultimate place to be in a Saturday night with your friends or Bae. Amazing collection of cuisine and all of them are super delicious.Goan localites sell traditional craft, ornaments and spices here on Saturday nights.They had few music bands playing simultaneously in different spots. It's an amazing experience to be there."
Shop dine and dance but be aware of jam,Shopping unlimited from clothes to handloom to accessories to spices do bargain as much as you can live dj big food court serving all cuisines but go there by a two wheeler as the road will be Mam packed
Shopping all the way,"The market is bustling with shops and food carts. You can shop till you drop and get excellent bargains too. The shops offer anything from clothes to gift items to home decor stuff. With more than 100's of outlets, you are sure not wanting to miss it. The food stalls have ample seating spaces too outdoors during evenings making it a pleasant experience. Located well in the city area makes it easier for everyone. But make sure to bargain big time...."
Over priced,The place is good if you have a very good at negotiating the price. The price quoted by shopkeepers will be random and if you have no idea of the product you are buying  you will end up paying double or triple the price. I bought products in 150 and 200 when the shopkeeper quoted 800 and 750 respectively.
This market has not started yet,"I went based on the previous reviews in October and paid a taxi to take me. The market has not even started yet its to early in the season. We also passed a market called Mickeys this has not started either. I took a scooter the following day to make sure the taxi driver took me to the right place and it was just empty derelict stall. The Saturday night market was not on Saturday 28th October the taxi driver that took me to the airport said it was to early yet for this market to start its should start in a few weeks or longer,  however he did say there have a day flee market on a Wednesday in Aprora during the day.So I cant understand the previous posts regarding the above market."
Didn't find anything interesting. ,After too much hype visited Saturday night bazaar in my 10th or 11th visit to Goa but found it to be simple with more of traditional items and some good music around. May be it's because is these kinda fair and items are common in our place. Too much crowded and even price of items are set keeping foreigners in mind.
you must go...,"One should visit one of the markets Goa is famous for, and make it either for the Anjuna flea market or the night market, as time and date permits.  it‚Äôs a must visit, especially first timers to Goa. Its fun, food is good, entertainment can be great. Opposite the Hilton, the market is a fun way to pass several hours. There's food, cocktails, and drinks available. The market has a lot of stalls selling similar goods, so shop around for the best prices; be prepared to haggle for a good deal. The place is full of 'hippies' and the live music on stage reflects that atmosphere. It starts at 4 pm and continues until 3 am. The feel of the place is very different and worth a short visit even if not for shopping. There is always live music, found foreigners selling their jewelry a bit rude and left their stall, but others are good to bargain and window shop. Indian might find it little expensive."
Must visit in Goa,"One can have a great time here. There are food stalls, music, accessories stalls etc. The energy is amazing."
Must visit if in Goa on a weekend,"Superb crowd, a feeling of European culture, live music, food and loads and loads of shops to shop from."
Wow,The place is so vibrant and rejuvenating... Its a open flee market with numerous stalls and food counters.. There are different types of food joints.. And there is band performing as well.. The crowd is crazy and funny and charming.. You get a great lively feel.. The prices of the stuff is quite costly though.. But great place to hang out and definitely a must visit...
Wishes galore,U ask and you get ... leather products... bling... goan artefacts...traditional stuff... whatever yiu wish for ..flea typesFor keeps or giftingPresently under renovation and down due to rains...Another saturday market is near crabfish restaurant and is live since dec
Amazing assault on the senses!,"I spent a few hours at the Arpora Night Market and was blown away, the beautifully lit and laid out stalls, the live traditional music that was weaving its way through the alleyways between stalls and the incredible smells of incense and freshly cooked foods. I didn't buy very much as I had been to Anjuna Market a few days earlier but I absolutely loved it.I had various things to eat from the vendors who was freshly preparing dishes right before your eyes, I had some pakoras and bhajis with freshly brewed chai, I had sweetcorn on the cob that had been cooked in hot coals and I was in love with some puris that we covered in various sauces.Amazing experience, I'll definitely be going back :-)"
A Great Indian Shopping Experience,"A Vibrant Atmosphere, Colourful, Crowded, Noisy and Hectic... A Great Indian Shopping Experience...A good place for buying local handicrafts, spices, jewellery, pashminas, bags, shoes etc and souvenirs...... Don't ever take the first price as bartering is part of the experience. Not just a market but also a good evening out..... Live Music on the centre stage.... Professional Fire Eater shows very entertaining. Also a lot of international fast food stalls serving all kinds of delicious dishes (Italian...Arabian...Mexican...Goan Currys...Doughnuts ) to name a few ....... Beer Bars and Cocktail bars .... all situated around a large seating area.  The Kingfisher beer is a must..A cosmopolitan crowd, a good mix of tourist, both Indian and European, Hippies and a lot of Russians.Starts about 6pm finishes approx 5am (seasonal)Highly Recommended ...."
"Visit this place for awesome food, shopping is expensive","The saturday market is a great place to be for the mouth watering and multi cuisine food. The food is just awesome and one can see all the varities from indian, continental, mexican, arabian etc etc. Shopping here is an expensive affair and one should try to visit other markets for a fair deal.Apart from food and shopping live performances keep on going and are really good."
Saterday night market,Very stressful place with too many people around. Nothing interesting to buy but very funny to see that part of Goa and all the hipsters around. A smell of cannabis all over! Maybe because we were there when there was no alcohol allowed in Goa. Nice to say that you have been there.
"Must visit place, Shopping is expensive",It is a good place to visit and spend some time in the evening. Having beer and watching their live show is worthy. A lot of foreigners thats why items which are for sale are expensive.
Is the location correct?,I tried locating this but in can (based on the location suggested by tripadvisor). I couldn't just locate it. And I was there on a Saturday night.
Good market ,Located near to calangute this is a famous market in north Goa... you will find some great souvenir for family and friends apart from the necessary clothing... highly recommend this place for street shopping
Overhyped,"The place is like any other flea market anywhere in India. Nothing Local about it. Food is from all over, stuff available there is available in all local shops near Calangute beach. If you have limited time in Goa, this place can be totally missed. if you do plan to visit, schedule for evening when the temperatures are down and the music has started."
Typical flea market,"Its a typical flea market - lots of cheap stuff to buy...you can bargain to your hearts content. Some music and live performances also available (average quality). Good for a 1-2 hour trip to just browse, have some chilled beer and enjoy the performances."
Saturday market,"Nice place to do some shopping, hanging out with friends, experience the Goan cuisine and music. Must visit place if you are looking to do some local street shopping."
Aaasummm experience ,"First thing if you are shopohorlic , wanted to do lots and lots shopping in Goa then yes you are at right place...  This market is only setup on Saturday .Before going there do enhance  your bargaining skills coz  that's is the only thing which help you to shop .Trust me as soon as u enter that market u will see lots of shops .This market is for everyone & every thing . From cloths to home decor you will get everything .This is the place under one roof u will get shopping, fun, music ,food everything Yes you   can do shopping, eating, alcohol, fun , music every thing.Do visit there it's really good. But your bargaining skills should be very strong."
All in one place for a saturday!!!,"1.  This is a must visit place in goa2.  Lots of options for shopping, handicrafts,jewelry, carpets, etc...3.  Free entry4.  Live orchestra, right from rock,jazz, to indian classical played till late night.5.  Can spend about 3hrs or more6.  Music, drinks, shopping all under one roof.8.  Most of the stuff is quite expensive.9.  Food and drinks are affordable.10. all in all cool place for a saturday night."
A must visit flee market..!!,There are 2 might flee markets in GOA.. on happens every Wednessday (in Anjuna) and this one happens every Saturday (in Arpora)We visited the Saturday one & had a great experience.. it was open till 3:00am.. !!Since its a great tourist attraction.. most of the items are overpriced... u got to bargain hard.. & get the stuff...
Average shopping experince,This is on the main road and easy to find place with ample free parking . When we visited there were limited shops and most of them having similar products . You got to have good bargaining skills to shop or else you will be looted
Surprisingly good time to spend the saturday night,"This market is located in Arpora and transpires every Saturday evening from 6pm until late night. Here, one may find everything from regular Indian stalls selling spices, teas, Kashmiri carpets and silver jewellery to international designers who convene from all over the word to sell their unique creations, many of which may be found only here. This market also houses food stalls featuring cuisines from across the globe, and the centre stage that hosts live concerts featuring Rock to Indian Classical. Further up the hill, is ""The Boutique House Bar"" that serves delightful cocktails while DJs play late into the night. Overall, a good place to hang out when you are in a group."
Just a Rip Off ,"I love markets ! This one has a great vibe , great beer ! And great food stalls ... the market is expensive ! Tired and uninteresting ... call me jaded just been living in India long enough to know a rip off ... it is a must see cause the entertainment is cool ! Wendell Rodrigues , Sacha's , are just some of my fav shops vs the market ... ps even the main city market is more fun !"
As good as it used be.,"It is full of hustking and bustling when you visit Arpora Saturday market. It still has the same old charm.Though it is a costly affair to do shopping here,but the overall expereience is much more exciting than shopping around.The open stalls with all possible cuisines ,drinks to be  enjoyed.Open air live orchestra band .It feels good to be part of this market rush. one can easily spend 2-3 hours in this market.Not to be missed  if you happen to be in Goa on Saturday evening."
Must visit,"You can't just miss the Saturday Night market at Arpora if you are at Goa on a Saturday. The sheer scale, size and variety is just overwhelming. You can get almost everything from clothes, spices, handicraft, metal ware, food, music, collectibles and what not. There are some fixed price shops, and some others where you can get some good discount if you persist. However, these aren't the best prices in Goa even after a lot of bargaining - the only advantage being the wide variety available at one place. The entrance and parking are free."
It's fun to be here!,"I am rating this average just because of the highly priced products sold in here! Otherwise it's really fun to visit the market. Colorful, vibrant and cool place. An open air stage with some good performances makes it worth visiting. Open bars in the market play some good music too.I would advice not to buy anything in the market as they are all overly priced. The spices sold are expensive and the same thing can be bought at a very reasonable rate in Mapusa market which is open everyday! However, it is fun to walk around in the market and appreciate the products sold in here. Leather jackets to gowns, hats to boots, handicrafts to paintings, lanterns to candles etc.The bar counters are pretty reasonable. The food court is nice and i suggest one has to try it. There is so much variety in there one can't stop drooling at some of the counters.The market, which is highly priced in my view, is nonetheless worth a visit!"
Mr Yunus Yusufali ,The market was full of youngsters and hippies. It was full of Indian cultural design clothes and artistic works.
Sat Night market,"It's one of the popular location amongst tourists from India as well as other countries. This market operates at night, soft music üé∂, good food, shopping üõí it all here at one place."
Excellent Market,"Came here once during our two week stay in Candolim. It is a very well organised market and was busy, although we came towards the end of the season I can imagine that during the high season it would be absolutely packed and a struggle to walk around.It was a big market, with all the usual items on sale. My wife bought some clothes and I got some spices which all seemed very cheap. There was also plenty of stalls in one area selling a variety of food and a bar in the middle of this area selling soft and alcoholic drinks, all at good prices. There was a also a stage and a band playing both Western rock music as well as seemingly well known Indian music (as all the locals were singing along). It was such a good atmosphere, really good fun.We got there about 8.00pm and left around midnight and it was still going strong. It cost us 1000 rupees for a return trip in a taxi, although we travelled as a group and others left early in the taxi and we got a taxi from outside the market (600 rupees), of which were were plenty coming and going as well as tuc tucs. Well worth a visit."
Expected more...,"We got here around 5.30pm as part of a group, was booked through Thomson. Journey wasn't the best and transport was poor for a Thomson brand, driver needs to stop breaking so hard. Markets were just starting to set up so not much atmosphere and lots of stalls still empty, overall we did manage to get a few bargains (make sure you go half their price) and it was good fun haggling. Food didn't look appealing/hygienic enough to eat so we just had a pizza and opted for vegetarian. Had two hours here and it was more than enough time. I would suggest getting here around 7pm so you get a good feel/vibe!"
Good night out,"Good night out at the market lots of good bargains after hard bargaining just pay a 1/4 of what they are asking is most cases, great selection of food stalls something for everyone."
"Only to enjoy music, too good",Market is not good. Recommended only for western music lovers. It was good. Food quality seems average. Must go for music. Enjoyed a lot.
Night life in GOA is awsome,"Saturday night market is between Anjuna and Calangute. If you are staying in North Goa this is a must visit place. Food options could have more but not to worry. Infront of that, there is a restaurant, they open till 3 in the night and non-veg (Prawn, chicken dopiaza my fab) preparation is must try with hot tandoori roti or naan (Indian bread).Some live music with drink enhance the experience of Saturday night market."
Not recommended at all,Not upto the mark.The crowd is drunk and the clothes are cheap and second handed probably.Not very safe also
Avoid ‚Äì the local markets are MUCH BETTER,"While I have been to goa many a times ‚Äì somehow have missed being there on a Saturday night.. and so was super excited to go to the much hyped ‚Äì Saturday Night market. And what an utter disappointment it was ..  Simply because you have the same stuff and the stalls that you will see at Calngute or Anjuna beaches... with the price tag which is at least 50% marked up from what you will find elsewhere.. so even if you are good at bargaining it‚Äôs a hassle to get to that price point.. There were no Novelty or new items that were NOT available elsewhere..  And while the atmosphere is festive (with live band and food etc.), I think you don‚Äôt need more than 30 mins to experience it.. would definitely NOT recommend this for shopping.. go to the local markets and hop around if required ‚Äì you will find better variety and good pricing too."
"First visit, must visit",This was the first time i went to the saturday night market and i was surprised to see how huge it was with lots of shops to shop and eat and live musician performing. 2 bar counters in the middle. Bargain a lot if you are shopping. Food and drinks are very expensive.
Shopping !!!,"Shopping, live music, food and drinks all at one place what else could any girl ask for. You have to really bargain properly when you buy stuff from the shops. The live music entertainment is worth spending the night their."
Good Time Pass place,We have been there during new year eve. There was music & dance program organised. Lot of food stalls & good gathering. same things what you get on beaches were available at almost same price.Good time place & location is along the road with ample parking space
An Overhyped Event,"We went on 19th March 2017 , due to Holi in Goa it was held on sunday the 19th March instead of usual Saturday . We went their with lots of expectations and excitement . But when we went dere it was all nt well .. too much crowded .. d eating joints nt only expensive but also unhygienic .. d live band ws too loud and not energetic or upto d mark .. d shops selling all type of goods like household spices t shirts souveniers etc but again all overpriced may b fr foreign tourists or ppl frm small towns might enjoy d bargain or quality but nt frm metro towns like Delhi Mumbai etc"
Average,The golden ruleBargain as much as you can. You will get the items (except food) at your cost. No need to worry about parking space.
Flee market with great cheap stuff,"Awesome market , good Cheap stuff ! You can get cool stuff here for great pricesShops run by Indians bargaining level legendary and don't even try in the Russian shops"
Saturday night market was great earlier but its only average now,"We have been going to Saturday night market for many years now, it was so exciting with the vibrant colors of the bands playing to great food. This time there was a rajasthani folk singer who started well but could not keep the crowd entertained.The food stalls earlier served such delicious food now its just a matter of money making by the several stall owners.There is not much vareity and what ever is sold is over priced."
Quite disappointing ,We heard a lot about this market and we went this Saturday.  It was a huge disappointment. Very average stuff on sale.  Food options for vegetarians was also very less.
Never fails to entertain!,"I've been many times to this market in the past and it really is an icon in North Goa! Every time there's great live music and loads of food stalls serving all kinds of delicious dishes....but I was sad to see that the chicken rotisserie place doesn't exist there any more as that was definitely my favourite place to eat. It's hectic to get to and from the site in Arpora but that adds to the excitement of the experience! Everywhere inside there are different bars playing different styles of music. And the stalls? Well, the shopping experience is incredible, as is  the people-watching that makes for some amazing photos. Highly recommended!"
Very different worth experiencing,"Very different from the usual city markets , pretty interesting and certainly the experience is great , the energy , the people are simply awesome . Must experience"
"street Shopping, bargaining","There are all kinds of kitsch clothing and accessories. Some gift items and decorations too. Mostly handicrafts. The market area is big and there are food stalls, parking and game stalls too."
Don't waste your time,"Substandard goods. Really not the best of Indian goods on bargain.. anyhow it's a highlight of goa, so the tourist would do it as a ""thing to do"" for an Indian traveller o would've been happy to see authentic indian crafts being offered.. this was shabby to the best.. hippie & substandard maybe cheap but not tasteful at all! Didn't eat here.. but lots of food stalls and clothes and accessories. I brought a pair of leather hand made slippers. That's it!"
Street shopping ,My visit to aropra is good. Good for street shopping but try to avoid the kids at this place as there is so much of walking. Good for girls.
Late night trip,Thoroughly enjoyed the market. Great choice of food stalls. Fire eaters and good music while we sat and enjoyed a drink or two.
Ace,"One of the best markets I've been to. Great for all ages.  There is so much choice of food, live music and lots of bars  at reasonable prices. The market it's self it's massive, you definitely need a few hours to get round it all."
Night saterday market ,"This markets foods are very nice and it has all type of food such as chinese, italian , indian & ...The price of goods are not expensive but you have to try for discont from sellers"
A must visit for every type of visitor,"This is dream come true for Shoppoholics where you can find fashion, furniture, and accessories at a good price! (Read : you have to bargain :) )and for those who don't like shopping or reluctant company: there is a music show, a bar counter (win win), and a foodie corner.Make sure you go to the old market and not the new one (yes there are many versions popping up)"
Fabulous Sights and Sounds In a Market Place,"Enjoyed our visit to the market. Not one for doing this sort of thing, but I really enjoyed it and my wife loved all the haggling for unique gifts to take home. Live music, food and drink with 100's of stalls selling their wares. Make an effort to go along you are sure to find something to suit here."
The Saturday night fever at Arpora.,"Extremely difficult to reach if you don't start early in the evening, Arpora night market is a 'must visit' in Goa. All the approach roads are almost blocked with vehicles trying to reach the area. But one must not miss the experience. A great many number of food stalls, live music, a cosmopolitan crowd and lots of stalls offering you a variety of stuff from fancy dresses and trinkets to articles for home decoration-  the night market at Arpora seems to come out of the Arabian Nights. Food and drinks are really cheap and you can get a good bargain at the shops. Wonderful experience. The place is worth revisiting."
There are two Saturday Night Bazaars!,Both the night bazaars are around baga and arpora. Both are equally lit. The where we went was opposite the 23-restaurant. Nice place for shopping at really affordable rates. You can bargain as much as you want. There is a live music concert as well where people come and play music. Would not recommend to eat here though. Food is exorbitantly high price and the quantity is really less. But overall a good place for shopping and having fun.
Nice place to end a Sunday night,"Recently,  I visited the market on Sunday the 19th of March 2017.So best to check if the market is happening on saturday or sunday.Also there is another new night market about to start close by.One should visit one of the markets Goa is famous for, and make it either for the Anjuna flea market or the night market, as time and date permits. The feel of the place is very different and worth a short visit even if not for shopping.There is always live music, when i visted boring hindi songs by a band but a crowd loving it none the less.I did manage to buy nick kancks, artifacts, necklace, singing bowl, bottle opener, bed sheets and spent 2 hours there. would have shopped more if the pace dint shut at 2, although 2 hours after a late dinner felt like a good end to the Sunday night.Found foreigners selling their jewellery a bit rude and left their stall, but others are good to bargain and window shop.Would definitely recommend this experience to those visiting goa."
A fun night out,"Opposite the Hilton, the market is a fun way to pass several hours. There's food, cocktails and drinks available. The market has a lot of stalls selling similar goods, so shop around for the best prices; be prepared to haggle for a good deal. The place is full of 'hippies' and the live music on stage reflects that atmosphere. It starts at 4pm and continues until 3am"
Excellent Spot of North Goa,"If u r in north goa on saturday then no need to go other sites and wasted the money..this spot is excellent for party lovers.live music,live Dance Shows with 80% foreinger crowedThis spot is not for family but with friends this is ultimate spot.."
Great place to shop and party!,"It is a great place for everyone. You can shop, eat drink and party all at the same place. Great music. Happening crowd. But if you want to buy then need to bargain a lot."
Unnecessary hype ,Nothing great abt this place expect.for live performances......everything priced double you get the same stuff at candolim calangute road for much lesser price....terribly unhygienic food .... waste of time & money
"Wow, masses to look at, slightly reminded me of opening scenes of Bladerunner!","Crazy, fun, colourful, crowded.......A must visit.  Great live music, good food options, coctails and drinks....Wonderful stores with very eclectic merchandise, some very unusual and some just the kind of thing you'd want to bring back home from Goa.  Friendly people and is you like mad..... much people watching opportunities.   Fun, fun, fun.  Bargain like mad and have a blast."
Great Night out,"Great to hear there own music being played, good stalls great choice's to be madeBeer there food stalls"
Saturday market closed ,"The market was closed on 18th march 2017, we were disappointed. We have planned to visit the market and planned to shop a lot but it was not possible as it was closed without any informations."
Huge Collection.,The collection was mostly designed keeping foreigners in mind. Only open on Saturday after 6pm.  Food is very costly here. Live music was there. Lots of Shops. All bargain!!
Partayy and shop,"If you to Goa and miss this place , you might want to consider visiting Goa again. The Saturday night market offers you some great Indian shopping experience along with variety of eating options . The place is also known for the parties which have very nice music. I absolutely love the market and i can say it's a MUST SEE."
Must go,This is all night live  flea market on Saturday and have got huge variety of products to choose from. Should bargain for a deal.
Great bargains and colours of Goa,"Walked 15 min walk from our hotel to get to the market. Go after dark and enjoy what i felt was a great taste of Goa and a chance to buy some very nice local products. Make sure that you look around as this will give you an idea of best prices for what you are looking for. Dont be scared to bargain hard as they are good at their game and like a smile and haggle while doing business. Theres a bunch of hawker food stalls near a music stage where you can listen to some good tunes while enjoying a great meal washed down by a cold Kingfisher beer. You cant go wrong, enjoy!"
Good,Great place to shop for Hard bargaining skills requiredVery crowded too So much to do so little time
Must go ,"The Saturday night market is a must do, they have stalls selling handicrafts from all over India. Apart from that they have local boutique stalls which have really different stuff (all the way at the top). Grab a drink and walk around, enjoy the music. Don't miss buying some flavoured teas and incense sticks for back home. The food is amazing too, a lot of Goa's favourite restaurants like Thalassa and Bean me up have their stalls here."
Different experience of an indian bazaar!,"It's basically a makeshift market with hundreds of stalls selling local spices, clothes, hand made bags, Indian fake jems n jewellery, musical instruments, leather stuff etc. The atmosphere was relaxing with good music, food and drinks. The market is expensive; almost everything is double or triple the price. However don't shy away from a good bargaining as shop keepers would not shy away from given stuff at quarter of the price. Just put on your poker face and walk away. Good chance that you will get a call from back."
A beautiful place for shoping,Its a great place for shopping..you will get all things especially western wares musical instruments ornammnets etc.. only thingvis that u need to bargain on the price told by the sellers..at least start from the less than half the price..defnitely you can get it for less than half the price..
Saturday Night- A must.,A must visit. Visit post 9PM IST. Live band with people from different parts of the world. Market has variety of clothes and other stuff at cheap rates.
Perfect flea market place...,"Lovely collection of silver jewellery....bought lots of items üòÑ. Other then jewellery you also get semi precious stones, leather items, clothing and spices. Nice market ambience to stroll around."
Lovely visit,"We went on sat before Club Cubana and it was amazing, extremely busy but had an amazing vibe about it.. as there is a massive hippy influence there a lot of the stalls are proper hippies which is great as I wish i was one to be honest but the stalls have everything from your carved wooden elephants that are on every corner you turn in Goa üòÇto real leather and snake skin bags which where very pricey to say the least. Not to mention some amazing food from the food stall section ranging from traditional to hot dogs so caters for all. A must do if your hear it's on a Wednesday and Saturday and starts around 7 I think till the early hours. There are bars and a small club/dance floor which are excellent also:) defo worth a visit... x"
OMG Nuttier every year,"Firstly I guess its a must visit, especially first timers to Goa. Its fun, food is good, entertainment can be great and yes there are bargains. Treat the whole thing like a game if you shopping, adopt a ""I dont care if I get it or not attitude"" if you cannot get the price down walk, keeping walking and they will often tap you on the shoulder, coming down lower and lower.You may even feel insulted by now as the desperate bartering from them is possibly a third or even a quarter of the original price. Just go along with it, walk around and gather the best prices and go back round, you can get a bargain but take the time to educate yourself on the way round or you will pay too much.TOP TIP - The seller knows his cost and wants to sell so put on your Poker Face, make it fun your on Holiday afterall"
DISAPPONTING,This place is not for buyers. This place is for music lovers and people who want atmosphere to spend some time. Everything is very expensive.
